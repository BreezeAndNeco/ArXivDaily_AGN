 - **Abstract**
 The profound comprehension of the evolution and phenomenology of an Active Galactic Nucleus requires an accurate exploration of the dynamics of the magnetized gaseous disk surrounding the massive black hole in the centre. Many numerical simulations have studied this environment using elaborate grid-based codes, but in recent years, new mesh-less schemes have exhibited excellent conservation properties and good accuracy at a more moderate computational cost. Still, none implement general relativistic magnetic fields, a fundamental ingredient to model an accretion disk around a massive black hole. We present here a general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) scheme working within the mesh-less framework of the code \texttt{GIZMO}. We implement the hyperbolic divergence cleaning procedure, consistently extended to general relativistic effects, to keep the magnetic field divergence under safe levels. We benchmark the scheme against various relativistic magnetohydrodynamics stress tests, considering different dimensionalities and both a Minkowski or a Schwarzchild/Kerr background. To date, this is the first GRMHD scheme working in a mesh-free environment.

 - **Abstract**
 The mass assembly and chemical enrichment of the first galaxies provide key insights into their star-formation histories and the earliest stellar populations at cosmic dawn. Here we compile and utilize new, high-quality spectroscopic JWST/NIRSpec Prism observations from the JWST archive. We extend the wavelength coverage beyond the standard pipeline cutoff up to 5.5$\mu$m, enabling a detailed examination of the rest-frame optical emission-line properties for galaxies at $z\approx 10$. The improved calibration allows us to detect H$\beta$ and the [OIII]$\lambda\lambda 4959,5007$ doublet and resolve the auroral [OIII]$\lambda 4363$ line for the 11 galaxies in our sample ($z=9.3-10.0$) to obtain direct $T_e$-based metallicity measurements. We find that all galaxies show high ionisation fields and electron temperatures, with derived metallicities in the range $12+\log {\rm (O/H)} = 7.1 - 8.3$, consistent with previous strong-line diagnostics at high-z. We derive an empirical relation for $M_{\rm UV}$ and 12+log(O/H) at $z\approx 10$, useful for future higher-z studies, and show that the sample galaxies are `typical' star-forming galaxies though with relatively high specific star-formation rates and with evidence for bursty star formation. Combining the rest-frame optical line analysis and detailed UV to optical SED modelling, we determine the mass-metallicity relation and the fundamental-metallicity relation of the sample, pushing the redshift frontier of these measurements to $z=10$. These results, together with literature measurements, point to a gradually decreasing MZR at higher redshifts, with a break in the FMR at $z\approx 3$, decreasing to metallicities $\approx 3\times$ lower at $z=10$ than observed during the majority of cosmic time at $z=0-3$, likely caused by massive pristine gas inflows diluting the observed metal abundances during early galaxy assembly at cosmic dawn.
#### Super-Eddington Growth Ceiling: Analytic Constraints on the Rapid Growth of Light-Seed Black Holes in Massive Clumps

 - **Abstract**
 The existence of $\sim10^{7-8}{\rm M}_\odot$ supermassive black holes at $z\gtrsim 8$ challenges conventional growth channels. One attractive possibility is that light seeds ($M_{\rm BH}\lesssim10^{3}{\rm M}_\odot$) undergo short, super-Eddington episodes when they cross, and are captured by, dense massive gas clumps. We revisit this ``BH-clump-capture'' model using analytic arguments supported by toy-model simulations that follow Bondi-scale inflow, radiative feedback, gas dynamical friction and the recently discovered forward acceleration effect caused by the ionised bubble. For substantial growth the black hole must remain trapped for many dynamical times, which imposes three simultaneous constraints. The clump must be heavier than the black hole (mass doubling condition); its cooling time must exceed the super-Eddington growth time (lifetime condition); and dynamical friction must dominate shell acceleration (BH-trapping condition). These requirements confine viable clumps to a narrow density-temperature region, $n_{\rm H}\simeq10^{7-8}{\rm cm}^{-3}$ and $T\simeq(2-6)\times10^{3}{\rm K}$, for a $10^{3}{\rm M}_\odot$ seed. Even inside this sweet spot a $10^{3}{\rm M}_\odot$ seed grow up at most $4\times10^{3}{\rm M}_\odot$; the maximum growth ratio $M_{\rm BH, fin}/M_{\rm BH}$ falls approximately as $M_{\rm BH}^{-0.4}$ and is negligible once $M_{\rm BH}\gtrsim10^{4}{\rm M}_\odot$. The forward-acceleration effect is essential, expelling the black hole whenever photon trapping fails. We conclude that BH-clump-capture model, and potentially broad super-Eddington models, cannot produce the $>10^{4}{\rm M}_\odot$ seeds required for subsequent Eddington-limited growth, suggesting that alternative pathways, such as heavy seed formation, remain necessary.

 - **Abstract**
 IXPE has enabled the X-ray polarizations of many blazars to be measured. We analyze X-ray spectropolarimetric data for all high synchrotron peaked blazars observations published by the IXPE team. We find that there are no statistically significant correlations between the X-ray polarimetric properties of the blazars and their X-ray spectral properties. This implies that there is no connection between the energy distribution of the X-ray emitting electrons and the uniformity of the magnetic field in the X-ray emitting regions of these blazars. We also find that the X-ray polarizations vary significantly between blazars and observations of the same blazar, implying the level of uniformity of the magnetic field in the X-ray emitting region is highly variable. This result will inform future theoretical work and potentially help narrow down the acceleration process of the synchrotron electrons.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a study of the neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) content of spatially resolved, low-redshift galaxies in the SIMBA cosmological simulations. We create synthetic HI data cubes designed to match observations from the Apertif Medium-Deep HI imaging survey, and follow an observational approach to derive the HI size-mass relation. The HI size-mass relation for SIMBA is in broad agreement with the observed relation to within 0.1 dex, but SIMBA galaxies are slightly smaller than expected at fixed HI mass. We quantify the HI spectral ($A_{\mathrm{flux}}$) and morphological ($A_{\mathrm{mod}}$) asymmetries of the galaxies and motivate standardizing the relative spatial resolution when comparing values in a sample that spans several orders of magnitude in HI mass. Galaxies are classified into three categories (isolated, interacted, or merged) based on their dynamical histories over the preceding ~2 Gyr to contextualize disturbances in their HI reservoirs. We determine that the interacted and merged categories have higher mean asymmetries than the isolated category, with a larger separation between the categories' $A_{\mathrm{mod}}$ distributions than between their $A_{\mathrm{flux}}$ distributions. For the interacted and merged categories, we find an inverse correlation between baryonic mass and $A_{\mathrm{mod}}$ that is not observed between baryonic mass and $A_{\mathrm{flux}}$. These results, coupled with the weak correlation found between $A_{\mathrm{flux}}$ and $A_{\mathrm{mod}}$, highlight the limitations of only using $A_{\mathrm{flux}}$ to infer the HI distributions of spatially unresolved HI detections.
#### Systematic non-thermal velocity increase preceding soft X-ray flare onset

 - **Abstract**
 Non-thermal velocities, derived from spectral line broadening, can provide crucial insights into plasma dynamics before and during solar flares. To systematically study the pre-flare phase, we constructed a Hinode/Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) flare catalog of 1,449 flares from 2011-2024. This enabled a large-scale analysis of flare loop footpoint non-thermal velocity evolution across different flare magnitudes (C, M, X-classes). Analyzing Fe VIII - Fe XXIV emission lines formed at log(T/K) ~5.7-7.3 with piecewise linear fits in the pre-flare period, we find that non-thermal velocities consistently increase 4-25 minutes before GOES soft X-ray start in C and M-class flares. Onset timing patterns vary with flare magnitude: smaller flares show temperature-dependent progression, while larger flares exhibit more compressed, near-simultaneous onsets across temperatures. While our limited X-class sample (N=18) also show onset before GOES, larger statistics are needed to confirm its behavior. M-class flares show a systematic precursor non-thermal velocity onset ~30-60 minutes before GOES peak. In a subset of M-class flares (2011-2018), eruptive events show even earlier non-thermal velocity increases ($>$1 hour before GOES peak) than confined events, suggesting a link between extended pre-flare non-thermal broadening and successful eruptions. This large scale study establishes pre-flare non-thermal velocity increase at footpoints as a common precursor observable before any X-ray signature.
#### Coriolis force acting on near-surface horizontal flows during simulations of flux emergence produces a tilt angle consistent with Joy's law on the Sun

 - **Abstract**
 Joy's law describes the tilt of bipolar active regions on the Sun away from an east-west orientation, where the flux of the polarity concentrated at the prograde side tends to be closer to the equator than the polarity on the retrograde side. Joy's law is attributed to the Coriolis force because of the observed increase in tilt angle at higher latitudes. This tilt plays a crucial role in some solar dynamo models. Our goal is to model the effects of the Coriolis force on a flux tube as it rises through the near-surface convection zone. We use a three-dimensional Cartesian magnetohydrodynamic simulation of an untwisted flux tube ascending from a depth of 11 Mm. We model the Coriolis effect using the f-plane approximation, that only considers and acts on horizontal flows. On the Sun, Joy's law is weak and is only evident as an average over many active regions. To achieve a measurable effect in a single simulation, we consider a rotation rate 110 times faster than the Sun. The simulation shows that the flux tube emerges at the surface with a tilt angle consistent with Joy's law when scaled to the Sun's slower rotation, and the tilt angle does not substantially change after emergence. This shows that the Coriolis force acting on flows horizontal to the surface within the near-surface convection zone is consistent with Joy's law.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the chemical abundance distributions of the Fornax, Sculptor, Ursa Minor, and Draco dwarf galaxies using Subaru/HSC photometric data. The HSC dataset, which includes broadband g and i filters and the narrowband NB515 filter, offers sensitivity to iron and magnesium abundances as well as surface gravity, enabling the identification of giant stars and foreground dwarfs. For analysis, we selected a total of 6713 giant candidates using a Random Forest regressor trained on medium-resolution (R ~ 6000) Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopic data. Our analysis reveals the extent of radial metallicity gradients in the galaxies. Such trends, not detectable in earlier studies, are now captured owing to the substantially enlarged sample size and areal coverage provided by the HSC data. These results are also consistent with chemical abundance patterns previously observed in the central regions through spectroscopic studies. Furthermore, we infer that Fornax underwent extended star formation, whereas Sculptor formed both metal-poor and metal-rich stars over a shorter time. Ursa Minor and Draco appear to have experienced brief, intense star formation episodes leading to nearly extinguished star formation. This study underscores the critical role of the expanded HSC dataset in revealing chemical gradients that were previously inaccessible. Future work incorporating additional spectra of metal-poor stars and age-sensitive isochrone modeling will enable more accurate maps of chemical abundance distributions.

 - **Abstract**
 The observation of neutron star mergers with gravitational waves (GWs) has provided a new method to constrain the dense-matter equation of state (EOS) and to better understand its nuclear physics. However, inferring nuclear microphysics from GW observations necessitates the sampling of EOS model parameters that serve as input for each EOS used during the GW data analysis. The sampling of the EOS parameters requires solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations a large number of times -- a process that slows down each likelihood evaluation in the analysis on the order of a few seconds. Here, we employ emulators for the TOV equations built using multilayer perceptron neural networks to enable direct inference of nuclear EOS parameters from GW strain data. Our emulators allow us to rapidly solve the TOV equations, taking in EOS parameters and outputting the associated tidal deformability of a neutron star in only a few tens of milliseconds. We implement these emulators in \texttt{PyCBC} to directly infer the EOS parameters using the event GW170817, providing posteriors on these parameters informed solely by GWs. We benchmark these runs against analyses performed using the full TOV solver and find that the emulators achieve speed ups of nearly \emph{two orders of magnitude}, with negligible differences in the recovered posteriors. Additionally, we constrain the slope and curvature of the symmetry energy at the 90\% upper credible interval to be $L_{\rm sym}\lesssim106$ MeV and $K_{\rm sym}\lesssim26$ MeV.
#### Detailed analysis of multi-line molecular distributions in the Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068: Possible effect of the AGN outflow to the starburst ring

 - **Abstract**
 We apply principal component analysis (PCA) to the integrated intensity maps of 13 molecular lines of the nearby type-2 Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068 obtained by Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) to objectively visualize the features of its center, (1) within a radius of about 2 kpc ($\sim$ 27".5; hereafter the "overall region") and (2) the ring shaped starburst region between 750 pc ($\sim$ 10") and 2 kpc ($\sim$ 27".5) of the galaxy (hereafter the "SB ring region"). PCA is a powerful unsupervised machine learning technique that extracts key information through dimensionality reduction. The PCA results for the overall region have a possibility to reconstruct a map representing the approximate H$_2$ column density and difference of volume density and/or chemical composition between the circumnuclear disk (CND) and the starburst ring (SB ring). Additionally, the PCA results for the SB ring region have a possibility to reconstruct a map representing the approximate H$_2$ column density and distinction between starburst dominated region and shock dominated region. Furthermore, the PCA results for the SB ring region indicate a possible interaction between the Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) outflow and gas in the SB ring. Although further investigation is required, we suggest that the AGN outflow interacts with gas in the SB ring, as this feature is consistent with the direction of the AGN outflow and is contributed by CN, C$_2$H and HCN, which are known to be enhanced by the AGN outflow. These results demonstrate that PCA can effectively extract features even for galaxies with complex structures, such as AGN + SB ring. This study also implies that PCA has the potential to uncover previously unrecognized phenomena by visualizing latent structures in multi-line data.

 - **Abstract**
 Optical observations with high time resolution are essential for understanding the origin of sub-millisecond timescale astronomical phenomena, including giant radio pulses from the Crab Pulsar. We have developed a high-speed imaging system called the Imager of MPPC-based Optical photoN counter from Yamagata (IMONY). The system uses a customized Multi-Pixel Photon Counter (MPPC), which independently reads out signals from all $8\times8$ pixels and functions as an imager based on a Geiger-mode avalanche photodiode array. This system assigns timestamps to detected photons with a time resolution of 100 ns. We installed IMONY on the 3.8 m aperture Seimei Telescope in Okayama, Japan. We have successfully detected the 34-ms period of the Crab Pulsar and imaged stars in the sensor's field of view. However, we have also found that a small fraction of the pixels have shown double or multiple pulses that are used for photon arrival timing. This situation is likely due to circuit noise and may unfortunately result in overestimating the number of photons detected. In order to precisely estimate the photon flux of targets or the sky background, calibration of such over-counts is important. We measured the number of detected photons relative to the light intensity of each pixel in a laboratory environment. We estimated the number of spurious hit pulses caused by signal tail fluctuations exceeding the comparator threshold, based on the exponential distribution of time intervals between pulses. These are distinct from typical SiPM afterpulses and originate from electronic effects in our readout system. After applying the calibration to the observed data, we confirmed the linearity between the V-band magnitudes of stars and the number of detected photons.

 - **Abstract**
 Extragalactic carbon monoxide (CO) line emission will likely be an important signal in current and future Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) surveys on small scales. However, great uncertainty surrounds our current understanding of CO emission. We investigate the implications of this modeling uncertainty on CMB surveys. Using a range of star formation rate and luminosity relations, we generate a suite of CO simulations across cosmic time, together with the broadband cosmic infrared background (CIB). From these, we quantify the power spectrum signatures of CO that we would observe in a CMB experiment at 90, 150, and 220 GHz. We find that the resulting range of CO auto-spectra spans up to two orders of magnitude and that while CO on its own is unlikely to be detectable in current CMB experiments, its cross-correlation with the CIB will be a significant CMB foreground in future surveys. We then forecast the bias on CMB foregrounds that would result if CO were neglected in a CMB power spectrum analysis, finding shifts that can be comparable to some of the uncertainties on CMB foreground constraints from recent surveys, particularly for the thermal and kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effects and radio sources, and many times greater than the expected uncertainties expected for future data. Finally, we assess how the broad range of multifrequency CO$\times$CIB spectra we obtain is captured by a reduced parameter set by performing a principal component analysis, finding that three amplitude parameters suffice for a CMB-S4-like survey. Our results demonstrate the importance for future CMB experiments to account for a wide range of CO modeling, and that high-precision CMB experiments may help constrain extragalactic CO models.

 - **Abstract**
 The Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) survey with ASKAP is transforming our understanding of radio galaxies, AGN duty cycles, and cosmic structure. EMUCAT efficiently identifies compact radio sources, yet struggles with extended objects, requiring alternative approaches. The Radio Galaxy Zoo: EMU (RGZ EMU) project proposes a general framework that combines citizen science and machine learning to identify around 4 million extended sources in EMU. This framework is expected to enhance the EMUCAT cataloging on extended sources and can be further empowered with the introduction of cross-matched external data from surveys such as POSSUM and WALLABY.
#### Measurements of the z=4-10 X-ray Luminosity Function: the high space density of moderate-luminosity, obscured AGN

 - **Abstract**
 SMBHs are theorised to undergo significant growth in the early Universe, however, the X-ray Luminosity Function (XLF), used as a principal tracer of the SMBH accretion density, lacks observational constraints at z>6, until now. We present new measurements of the z=4-10 XLF at intermediate luminosities, taking advantage of recent deep near-IR imaging from UltraVISTA that enables us to identify galaxies and AGN at high redshifts within which we identify X-ray sources using Chandra COSMOS data. We first performed a cross-match to a deep Chandra source list, for which the X-ray sensitivity can be accurately quantified, before exploiting available X-ray data further through direct extraction of X-ray counts at the positions of COSMOS2020 galaxies. With the resulting z=4-10 X-ray AGN sample, comprised of 21 blind detections and 11 directly extracted detections, we have measured the early space density of AGN, at moderate-luminosities where the majority of early SMBH growth occurred. These measurements reveal higher space-densities than expected, based on the extrapolation of XLF models from lower redshifts. Whilst our measured space densities at z=4-5 are consistent with model predictions, at z=5-7 we find space densities of the order of 10$\times$ the extrapolated model predictions and could be as high as 220$\times$ the model extrapolations at z=7-10. In addition, we find evidence that a large fraction of the early AGN population are heavily obscured, with an obscured fraction of 0.982$^{+0.007}_{-0.008}$; correcting for this obscuration further increases the measured space densities. Comparing to recent JWST results, these measurements begin to bridge the gap between the bright-end of the quasar luminosity function and the latest JWST observations of very early, low-luminosity AGN, indicating a larger fraction of the first galaxies play host to rapidly growing SMBH than previously thought.
#### Progenitor Insights of Type IIP SN 2018pq: A Comprehensive Photometric and Spectroscopic Study

 - **Abstract**
 We present high-cadence photometric and low-resolution (R $\sim$ 400--700) optical spectroscopic observations of Type IIP supernova, SN~2018pq, which exploded on the outskirts of the galaxy IC~3896A. The optically thick phase (``plateau'') lasts approximately 97 d, the plateau duration of normal Type IIP supernovae. SN~2018pq has a {\em V}-band absolute magnitude of $-16.42 \pm 0.01$ mag at 50 d, resembles normal-luminous supernova, and the V-band decline rate of 0.42$\pm$0.06 mag 50 d$^{-1}$ during the plateau phase. A steeper decline rate of 11.87$\pm$1.68 mag 100 d$^{-1}$ was observed compared to that of typical Type IIP supernovae during the transition between plateau to nebular phase. We employ detailed radiative transfer spectra modelling, TARDIS, to reveal the photospheric temperature and velocity at two spectral epochs. The well-fitted model spectra indicate SN~2018pq is a spectroscopically normal Type IIP supernova. Semi-analytical light curve modelling suggests the progenitor as a red supergiant star with an ejecta mass of $\sim$11 $M_\odot$ and an initial radius of 424 $R_\odot$. On the contrary, hydrodynamical modelling suggests a higher mass progenitor between 14--16 $M_\odot$.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent analyses from the Pierre Auger Collaboration suggest correlations between the arrival directions of Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs) and catalogs of starburst galaxies (SGBs) and jetted active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We revisit these analyses using the same methodology as \auger , but explicitly incorporating UHECR deflections in turbulent extragalactic magnetic fields (EGMFs). We demonstrate that while for SBGs the same sources as for the generic \auger\ analysis dominate the catalog correlations, jetted AGNs are dominated by Centaurus~A when accounting for source distances and deflections. Using our framework, we derive 90\% confidence level upper limits on the local EGMF strength of 4.4~nG~Mpc$^{1/2}$ for SBGs and 6.7~nG~Mpc$^{1/2}$ for jetted AGNs. Assuming instead that the UHECR deflections predominantly arise from the Galactic magnetic field (GMF), we obtain a GMF upper limit of $1.4 \, \mu$G~kpc$^{1/2}$ for a Galactic halo size of 30~kpc.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first band-2 (120 - 250 MHz) uGMRT (upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope) observations of the bimodal galaxy cluster Abell 1644 (z = 0.0471), complemented by Chandra X-ray data. While weak lensing measurements reveal a third substructure in Abell 1644, our radio analysis reveals only two compact sources coinciding with the respective brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) of the northern (A1644N) and southern (A1644S) substructures, seen in the X-ray observations. Radio analysis yields compact active galactic nuclei (AGN) powered sources with radio power $P_{A1644S} = 1.1\times 10^{23} W/Hz$ and $P_{A1644N} = 7.3\times 10^{23} W/Hz$ at 200MHz. We find no evidence of non-thermal diffuse radio emission, such as halos or relics, within the sensitivity of our band-2 image. We measured the flux density of each radio source and performed spectral analysis. A1644N exhibits a synchrotron power law spectrum while A1644S shows spectral turnover suggestive of synchrotron self-absorption. X-ray analysis reveals two shock fronts at the southern substructure with a Mach number $M= 3.21 \pm 0.51$ and $M= 2.22 \pm 0.07$, indicating an ongoing merger. Our findings reinforce the complex dynamical nature of Abell 1644 and contribute to a deeper understanding of the cluster's thermodynamic state. Future deep radio observations with improved radio frequency interference (RFI) mitigation will be crucial for probing non-thermal phenomena in this system.

 - **Abstract**
 Studying the radio spectral energy distribution (SED) of distant galaxies is essential for understanding their assembly and evolution over cosmic time. We present rest-frame radio SEDs of a sample of 160 starburst galaxies at redshifts 1.5 to 3.5 in the COSMOS field, as part of the MeerKAT International GHz Tiered Extragalactic Exploration (MIGHTEE) project. MeerKAT observations, combined with archival VLA and GMRT data, allow us to determine the integrated mid-radio (1-10 GHz) continuum (MRC) luminosity and magnetic field strength. A Bayesian method is used to model the SEDs and separate free-free and synchrotron emission. We calibrate the star formation rate (SFR) in radio both directly through SED analysis and indirectly via the infrared-radio correlation (IRRC). With a mean synchrotron spectral index of approximately 0.7, we find that the index flattens with redshift and specific SFR, suggesting that cosmic rays are more energetic in the early universe due to higher star formation activity. The magnetic field strength increases with redshift (B is proportional to (1 + z)^0.7) and with star formation rate (B is proportional to SFR^0.3), indicating a small-scale dynamo as the dominant amplification mechanism. Accounting for SED evolution, the IRRC remains redshift-invariant and does not vary with stellar mass at 1.5 < z < 3.5, though the correlation deviates from linearity. Similarly, we show that SFR estimates based on integrated MRC luminosity are also redshift-invariant.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of transit timing variations (TTVs) in the ultra-short-period gas giant WASP-19b, which orbits a G-type main-sequence star. Our analysis is based on a dataset comprising 204 transit light curves obtained from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), the Exoplanet Transit Database (ETD), and the ExoClock project, supplemented by 18 publicly available light curves. Mid-transit times were extracted from these data, and an additional 98 mid-transit times compiled from the literature were incorporated, resulting in a combined dataset spanning approximately 14 years. After excluding light curves significantly impacted by stellar activity, such as starspot anomalies, the final dataset consisted of 252 high-quality mid-transit times. Initial inspection of the transit timing residuals using an apsidal precession model suggested the possible presence of an additional planetary companion. However, subsequent frequency analysis and sinusoidal model fitting indicate that the observed TTVs are more consistently explained by apsidal precession of WASP-19b's orbit. We also considered alternative mechanisms, including the Applegate mechanism and the Shklovskii effect. Our findings suggest that stellar magnetic activity, potentially linked to the Applegate mechanism, may also contribute to the observed timing variations. To further constrain the origin of the TTVs and assess the contributions of these mechanisms, continued high-precision photometric monitoring of the WASP-19 system is strongly recommended.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the energy-dependent pulse profile of 4U 1538-52 and its phase-dependent spectral variability, with emphasis on the behavior around the cyclotron resonant scattering feature at around 21 keV. We analyze all available NuSTAR observations of 4U 1538-52. We decompose energy-resolved pulse profiles into Fourier harmonics to study their energy dependence. Specifically, we compute pulsed fraction spectra, cross-correlation and lag spectra, identifying discontinuities and linking them to features in the phase-averaged spectra. We perform phase-averaged and phase-resolved spectral analyses to probe spectral variability and its relation to pulse profile changes. Finally, we interpret our findings via physical modeling of energy- and angle-dependent pulse profile emission, performing radiative transfer in a homogeneous slab-like atmosphere under conditions relevant to 4U 1538-52. The emission is projected onto the observer's sky plane to derive expected observables. In contrast to the dips in pulsed fraction spectra observed in other sources (e.g., Her X-1), we find a broad bump near the cyclotron resonance energy in 4U 1538-52. This increase is driven primarily by phase-dependent spectral variability, especially by strong variations in cyclotron line depth across different phase intervals. We interpret the observed contrast between dips and bumps in various sources as arising from phase-dependent variations of cyclotron line depth relative to the phase-modulated flux. We model the X-ray emission from an accreting neutron star and find that our simulations indicate high values of both the observer's inclination and the magnetic obliquity, along with a 10-15 degrees asymmetry between the locations of the magnetic poles. Assuming this geometry, we satisfactorily reproduce the observed pulse profiles and introduce general trends in the observables resulting from the system's geometry.

 - **Abstract**
 Weak lensing surveys are often summarized by constraints on the derived parameter ${S_8\equiv\sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3}}$, obscuring the rich scale and redshift information encoded in the data, and limiting our ability to identify the origin of any tensions with $\Lambda$CDM predictions from the cosmic microwave background. In this work, we introduce a fast and flexible framework to extract the scale-dependent matter power spectrum $P(k, z)$ from cosmic shear and CMB lensing measurements, parameterizing deviations from the Planck $\Lambda$CDM prediction as a free function $\alpha(k)$. Using public data from DES Y3, KiDS-1000, HSC Y3, and ACT DR6, we constrain $\alpha(k)$ with fast Hamiltonian Monte Carlo inference. Our results show a consistent 15-30\% suppression in the matter power spectrum at intermediate scales ($k \sim 0.1-1{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$) in galaxy-lensing data relative to Planck, with combined tensions reaching up to $4\sigma$ at fixed cosmology. In contrast, ACT CMB lensing is consistent with $\Lambda$CDM at ${k\lesssim 0.1 {\rm Mpc}^{-1}}$. We validate our method using mock data, quantify consistency between datasets, and demonstrate how the resulting $\alpha(k)$ likelihoods can be used to test specific models for the power spectrum. All code, data products, and derived likelihoods are publicly released. Our results highlight the importance of reporting lensing constraints on $P(k, z)$ and pave the way for model-agnostic test of growth of structure with upcoming surveys such as LSST, Euclid, and Roman.

 - **Abstract**
 While bursty star formation in low-mass galaxies has been observed in local populations and reproduced in simulations, the dormant phase of the burst cycle has not been well studied beyond the local Universe due to observational limitations. We present a unique sample of 41 JWST PRISM spectra of low-mass galaxies ($M_\star < 10^{9.5}\,M_\odot$) at cosmic noon ($1<z<3$), uniformly selected on F200W magnitude and precise photometric redshifts enabled by 20-band JWST photometry from the UNCOVER and MegaScience surveys. The spectra reveal numerous strong Balmer breaks, which are negatively correlated with the galaxies' H$\alpha$ equivalent width. By comparing these observations to synthetic samples of spectra generated using a simple parametrization of bursty star formation histories, we show that star formation in low-mass galaxies at cosmic noon is likely dominated by burst cycles with long timescales ($\gtrsim 100$ Myr) and large deviations below the star-forming main sequence ($\gtrsim 0.8$ dex). Our results suggest that galaxies in this population--at least those within our detection limits--should not be classified solely by their current star formation rates, but instead viewed as a unified population undergoing dynamic movement above and below the star-forming main sequence. The derived constraints demonstrate that long-timescale fluctuations are important for this class of galaxies, indicating that galaxy-scale gas cycles--rather than molecular-cloud-scale stochasticity--are the primary regulators of star formation variability in low-mass galaxies at cosmic noon.

 - **Abstract**
 We use global MHD galaxy simulations to investigate the effects of spiral arms on the evolution of magnetic fields and star formation within a self-regulated interstellar medium (ISM). The same galaxy is simulated twice: once with self-consistent stellar spiral arms and once more with the stellar spirals suppressed via a novel numerical approach, using the Ramses AMR code. Spiral arms continually promote star formation, with 2.6 times higher rates in the spiral galaxy. The higher rate is due to high gas columns gathered along the spiral arms, rather than increasing the star formation efficiency at a given gas column. In both cases, the magnetic field is initially amplified via a small-scale dynamo driven by turbulence due to supernova feedback. Only the spiral galaxy exhibits late-time, consistent field growth due to a large-scale dynamo (e-folding time $\sim600$ Myr). This results in volume-averaged field strengths of $\sim 1$ $\mu$G after 1 Gyr of evolution. The mean-fields tend to align themselves with the spiral arms and are coherent up to 10 kpc scales. We demonstrate a novel large-scale dynamo mechanism, whereby spiral-driven radial flows enable the mean-field amplification.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent cosmological data and astrophysical observations, such as the Hubble tension and the increasing preference from galaxy surveys for dynamical dark energy, have begun to challenge the standard $\Lambda$-cold dark matter cosmological model. Primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) offer a mechanism to alleviate these tensions within the framework of the standard model. These fields source excess small-scale baryon clumping, which can speed up recombination and shrink the comoving sound horizon at the surface of last scattering. Computing the modified recombination history requires coupling the radiative transport of Lyman-$\alpha$ photons to compressible magnetohydronamic simulations. Since doing so is generically computationally intractable, we have developed a linearized treatment which self-consistently computes the modified recombination history in the presence of PMF induced baryon clumping for fields with red-tilted spectra. The clumping factors we find are too small to alleviate outstanding cosmological tensions, but our general framework can be applied to other PMF spectra, and provides a significant theoretical step towards a complete account of recombination in the presence of small-scale baryon clumping.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate phase separation in oxygen-neon (O/Ne) ultramassive white dwarfs (UMWDs). Current stellar evolution codes, such as MESA, only account for $\mathrm{^{16}O/^{20}Ne}$ separation and do not include other minor species. To improve this, we implement ternary phase diagrams into MESA. We construct UMWD models with O/Ne/sodium (Na) and O/Ne/magnesium (Mg) cores to test our implementation. We also assess the effect of including $\mathrm{^{22}Ne}$ in the current two-species framework. Our results show that incorporating additional components into the phase separation significantly alters the chemical evolution of UMWDs. Heavier elements preferentially enrich the solid core, enhancing mixing in the overlying liquid. We compute the buoyancy flux driven by compositional instabilities during crystallization. As in previous studies, we find two convective regimes: an early, fast overturning convection, lasting less than a million years, followed by inefficient (thermohaline) convection. The fast convective regime lasts up to 100 times longer with three-species separation compared to the standard $\mathrm{^{16}O/^{20}Ne}$ case. We find that neutron-rich species can have a significant contribution to the buoyancy flux despite their small mass fraction (<10\%). We compute the amount of cooling delay induced by phase separation in UMWDs, and find that the three-species phase separation produces a delay up to $\sim10$ times larger than the simplest case of fractionation, although still less than 1 Gyr. We predict that the change in the composition profile in the liquid region when three components are included should change the frequency of gravity modes that can propagate in the interior of pulsating UMWDs.

 - **Abstract**
 We perform a systematic study of the preconditioning of the interplanetary (IP) medium due to isolated interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs). Preconditioning is highly relevant when ICMEs, ejected in close succession and direction, modify the IP medium to allow subsequent ICMEs to propagate more freely, decelerate less, and retain higher kinetic energy at larger distances. We base our study on a sample of carefully selected events. The IP medium is analyzed during time intervals of 48 hours before and after the ICMEs in order to statistically quantify their impact on the properties of the solar wind (SW) and interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). We find that the SW behind ICMEs on average exhibits reduced density (-41%) and dynamic pressure (-29%), and increased total velocity (+15%), while the trailing IMF is more intense (+14%) and more radially aligned (13 degrees). The results suggest that even relatively low speed ICMEs can significantly precondition the IP medium. The results are relevant for better understanding of CME propagation and SW interaction, and hold implications for heliospheric models and applied research of space weather.

 - **Abstract**
 Supermassive black hole (SMBH) binary systems are unavoidable outcomes of galaxy mergers. Their dynamics encode information about their formation and growth, the composition of their host galactic nuclei, the evolution of galaxies, and the nature of gravity. Many SMBH binaries with separations pc-kpc have been found, but closer (sub-parsec) binaries remain to be confirmed. Identifying these systems may elucidate how binaries evolve past the ``final parsec'' until gravitational radiation drives them to coalescence. Here we show that SMBH binaries in non-active galactic nuclei can be identified and characterized by the gravitational lensing of individual bright stars, located behind them in the host galaxy. The rotation of `caustics' -- regions where sources are hugely magnified due to the SMBH binary's orbit and inspiral -- leads to Quasi-Periodic Lensing of Starlight (QPLS). The extreme lensing magnification of individual bright stars produces a significant variation in the host galaxies' luminosity; their lightcurve traces the orbit of the SMBH binary and its evolution. QPLS probes the population of sources observable by pulsar timing arrays and space detectors (LISA, TianQin), offering advance warning triggers for merging SMBHs for coincident or follow-up GW detections. SMBH population models predict $1-50\; [190-5,000] \left({n_\star}/{\rm pc}^{-3}\right)$ QPLS binaries with period less than $10\; [40]$ yr with comparable masses and $z<0.3$, where $n_\star$ is the stellar number density. Additionally, stellar and orbital motion will lead to frequent instances of single/double flares caused by SMBHBs with longer periods. This novel signature can be searched for in a wealth of existing and upcoming time-domain photometric data: identifying quasi-periodic variability in galactic lightcurves will reveal an ensemble of binary systems and illuminate outstanding questions around them.

 - **Abstract**
 The inner circumgalactic medium (CGM) of galaxies, where disk and halo processes intersect, remains poorly characterized despite its critical role in regulating galaxy evolution. We present results from Project AMIGA Insider, mapping Andromeda's (M31) inner CGM within 0.25 R_vir (~75 kpc) using 11 QSO sightlines, bringing our total sample to 54 sightlines from the disk to 2 R_vir. We detect a clear transition between M31's thick disk and CGM at R < 30 kpc, where low/intermediate ions show thick-disk corotating components with higher column densities than the CGM ones, while high ions exhibit similar column densities in both the CGM and thick disk. Beyond this region, all ion column densities decrease with impact parameter, with steeper gradients for low ions than high ions. The inner CGM (R < 100 kpc) shows more complex gas phases and multi-component absorption compared to the predominantly single-component outer CGM. We find no significant azimuthal dependence for any observed ions, suggesting M31's CGM is shaped by radial processes (e.g., cooling flows, precipitation) rather than disk-aligned outflows. We estimate the total metal mass in M31's cool (SiII, SiIII, SiIV) CGM within R_vir to be (1.9+/-0.3_stat+/-0.7_sys)x10^7 M_sun, leading to a cool gas mass of approximately 6x10^9 (Z/0.3 Z_sun)^-1 M_sun. The warmer OVI gas may contain at least 10 times more metal and gas mass. Compared to the COS-Halos L* galaxies, M31's cool CGM shows lower Si column densities at R < 0.4 R_200 and lower cool CGM masses, possibly resulting from M31's higher halo mass or different environments.

 - **Abstract**
 We present high-resolution Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI) and MUSE IFU spectroscopy of VV 114, a local infrared-luminous merger undergoing a vigorous starburst and showing evidence of galactic-scale feedback. The high-resolution data allow for spectral deblending of the optical emission lines and reveal a broad emission line component ($\sigma_{\rm{broad}} \sim$~100--300 km s$^{-1}$) with line ratios and kinematics consistent with a mixture of ionization by stars and radiative shocks. The shock fraction (percent ionization due to shocks) in the high velocity gas is anticorrelated with projected surface number density of resolved star clusters, and we find radial density profiles around clusters are well fit by models of adiabatically expanding cluster winds driven by massive stellar winds and supernovae (SNe). The total kinetic power estimated from the cluster wind models matches the wind+SNe mechanical energy deposition rate estimated from the soft band X-ray luminosity, indicating that at least 70\% of the shock luminosity in the galaxy is driven by the star clusters. \emph{Hubble Space Telescope} narrow band near-infrared imaging reveals embedded shocks in the dust-buried infrared nucleus of VV 114E. Most of the shocked gas is blueshifted with respect to the quiescent medium, and there is a close spatial correspondence between the shock map and the \emph{Chandra} soft band X-ray image, implying the presence of a galactic superwind. The energy budget of the superwind is in close agreement with the total kinetic power of the cluster winds, confirming the superwind is driven by the starburst.
#### An unusual type-I X-ray burst from the neutron star X-ray binary IGR J17591-2342: a double-photospheric-radius-expansion burst?

 - **Abstract**
 Type-I X-ray bursts observed from neutron stars originate from intermittent unstable thermonuclear burning of accreted matter on these stars. Such bursts, particularly those reaching the Eddington luminosity and having a temporary photospheric radius-expansion due to radiation pressure, provide a testbed to study nuclear fusion processes in intense radiation, gravity, and magnetic fields. Here, we investigate time-resolved spectroscopic properties of a type-I burst from the accretion-powered millisecond X-ray pulsar IGR J17591-2342. Our basic spectral model includes an absorbed blackbody to describe the burst emission and an absorbed power law to represent the non-burst emission. The blackbody normalisation shows two consecutive humps aligned with blackbody temperature dips during the burst. Such an unusual behaviour could imply two consecutive photospheric radius-expansion events during the same burst or a systematic metallicity evolution in the neutron star atmosphere. However, our spectral analysis suggests the latter option is less likely to be happening for IGR J17591-2342. The novel former option implies that sufficient fuel survived after the first photospheric radius-expansion event to power a second similar event a few seconds later, challenging the current theoretical understanding. If confirmed, the double photospheric radius-expansion event observed in IGR J17591-2342 suggests the possibility of avoiding photospheric expansion at luminosities exceeding Eddington. Mechanisms such as temporary enhancement of the magnetic field by convection and confinement of the plasma could be invoked to explain the peculiar behaviour of the source.

 - **Abstract**
 We decomposed the G333 complex and the G331 giant molecular cloud into multi-scale hub-filament systems (HFs) using the high-resolution $^{13}$CO (3$-$2) data from LAsMA observations. We employed the filfinder algorithm to identify and characterize filaments within HFs. Compared with non-HFs, HFs have significantly higher density contrast, larger masses and lower virial ratios. Velocity gradient measurements around intensity peaks provide evidence of gas inflow within these structures. There may be an evolutionary sequence from non-HFs to HFs. Currently, non-HFs lack a distinct gravitational focusing process that would result in significant density contrast. The density contrast can effectively measure the extent of gravitational collapse and the strength of the gravitational center of the structure that definitively shape the hub-filament morphology. Combined with the kinematic evidence in our previous studies, we suggest that molecular clouds are network structures formed by the gravitational coupling of multi-scale hub-filament structures. The knots in the networks are the hubs, they are the local gravitational centers and the main star-forming sites. Actually, clumps in molecular clouds are equivalent to the hubs. The network structure of molecular clouds can naturally explain that feedback from protoclusters does not significantly change the kinematic properties of the surrounding embedded dense gas structures, as concluded in our previous studies.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze the expansion signatures of 35 HII regions mapped in [CII] 158 micron emission by the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA). The [CII] emission primarily traces photodissociation regions (PDRs) at the transition between ionized and neutral gas. The brightness and narrow linewidth of [C II] allow us to measure PDR expansion. Bubble-shaped regions often exhibit expansion, while irregular-shaped ones are less likely to. Of the 35 HII regions, 12 (~34%) exhibit clear expansion in position-velocity (PV) diagrams, making them expansion candidates (ECs), with an average expansion velocity of ~12.2 km/s. The remaining 23 regions show no clear expansion signatures, though they may still be expanding below detection limits. Blueshifted expansion is more common (eight ECs solely blueshifted; one redshifted; three both), with mean velocities of ~10.9 km/s (blueshifted) and ~13.2 km/s (redshifted). A comparison of our observations to spherical expansion models supports expansion in eight of 12 ECs. Estimated dynamical ages are 10 to 100 times shorter than the ionizing star lifetimes, in agreement with the results of previous studies. Of the 35 regions, 14 (~40%) appear as [CII] bubbles; nine of the 12 ECs are bubble-shaped. Thermal pressure likely drives expansion in M43, while stellar winds dominate in M17, M42, RCW 120, and RCW 79. For other ECs, available data do not allow a definitive conclusion. Larger samples and more information about ionizing sources are needed to refine our understanding of HII region feedback and evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 It is shown that a simple quasi-equilibrium analysis of a multi-component plasma can be harnessed to explain catastrophic energy transformations in astrophysical objects. We limit ourselves to the particular class of binary systems for which the typical plasma consists of one classical ion component, and two relativistic electron components - the bulk degenerate electron gas with a small contamination of hot electrons. We derive, analytically, the conditions conducive to such a catastrophic change. The pathway to such sudden changes is created by the slow changes in the initial parameters so that the governing equilibrium state can no longer be sustained and the system must find a new equilibrium that could have vastly different energy mix - of thermal, flow-kinetic and magnetic energies. In one such scenario, macro-scale flow kinetic, and magnetic energies abound in the final state. For the given multi-component plasma, we show that the flow (strongly Super-Alfvénic) kinetic energy is mostly carried by the small hot electron component. Under specific conditions, it is possible to generate strong macro-scale magnetic (velocity) field when all of the flow (magnetic) field energy is converted to the magnetic (velocity) field energy at the catastrophe. The analysis is applied to explain various observed characteristics of white dwarf (WD) systems, in particular, of the magnetic and dense/degenerate type.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar spectropolarimetric inversion -- inferring atmospheric conditions from the Stokes vector -- is a key diagnostic tool for understanding solar magnetism, but traditional inversion methods are computationally expensive and sensitive to local minima. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) offer faster solutions, but are often restricted to shallow models or a few spectral lines. We present a proof-of-concept study using a transformer machine learning (ML) model for multi-line, full-Stokes inversion, to infer stratified parameters from synthetic spectra produced from 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations. We synthesise a large set of Stokes vectors using forward modelling across 15 spectral lines spanning the deep photosphere towards the chromosphere. The model maps full-Stokes input to temperature, magnetic field strength, inclination, azimuth (encoded as $\sin2\phi$, $\cos2\phi$), and line-of-sight velocity as a function of optical depth. The transformer incorporates an attention mechanism that allows the model to focus on the most informative regions of the spectrum for each inferred parameter, and uses positional embedding to encode wavelength and depth order. We benchmark it against a multilayer perceptron (MLP), test robustness to noise, and assess generalisation. The transformer outperforms the MLP, especially in the higher layers and for magnetic parameters, yielding higher correlations and more regularised stratifications. The model retains strong performance across a range of noise levels typical for real observations, with magnetic parameter inference degrading predictably while temperature and velocity remain stable. We establish transformer architectures as a powerful tool for spectropolarimetric regression. This approach paves the way for analysis of large datasets from large solar telescopes.

 - **Abstract**
 During Type III solar radio bursts, electromagnetic waves are radiated at plasma frequency $\omega_p$ and its harmonics by electrostatic wave turbulence generated by electron beams ejected by Sun in randomly inhomogeneous solar wind and coronal plasmas. These emissions, detected since decades by spacecraft and radiotelescopes, are split by the plasma magnetic field into three modes $\mathcal{X}$, $\mathcal{O}$ and $\mathcal{Z}$ of different dispersion, polarization and radiation properties. This work demonstrates, using three independent and converging approaches, that only a small fraction of electromagnetic energy radiated at $\omega_p$ ($\lesssim10\%$) is escaping from beam-generated radio sources, mainly as $\mathcal{O}$-mode waves and, depending on plasma conditions, as $\mathcal{X}$-mode waves. Most energy is radiated in $\mathcal{Z}$-mode and can therefore be only observed close to sources. Results have major implications for solar radio emission and provide strong support for interpretation of observations performed up to close distances to Sun by Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter spacecraft.

 - **Abstract**
 The Magellanic Clouds are two nearby dwarf irregular galaxies whose study can help us in understanding galaxy and stellar evolution. In particular, the Large Magellanic Cloud, the larger one, contains approximately 30 billion stars at various evolutionary stages. In this work, we present an SDSS $gri$-bands photometric analysis based on multiple images acquired with DECam, the Dark Energy Camera, installed on the Blanco telescope at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (Chile). We performed a full image analysis and photometric calibration, resulting in a photometric catalog named COSMIC-L, consisting of 57,997,665 stars, of which 18,676,294 contain estimates for all three $gri$ magnitudes, resulting in a completeness magnitude of $\simeq 21$ and a limiting magnitude of $\simeq 22$ in all three bands.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The classification of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is a challenge in astrophysics. Variability features extracted from light curves offer a promising avenue for distinguishing AGNs and their subclasses. This approach would be very valuable in sight of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). Aims. Our goal is to utilize self-organizing maps (SOMs) to classify AGNs based on variability features and investigate how the use of different subsets of features impacts the purity and completeness of the resulting classifications. Methods. We derived a set of variability features from light curves, similar to those employed in previous studies, and applied SOMs to explore the distribution of AGNs subclasses. We conducted a comparative analysis of the classifications obtained with different subsets of features, focusing on the ability to identify different AGNs types. Results. Our analysis demonstrates that using SOMs with variability features yields a relatively pure AGNs sample, though completeness remains a challenge. In particular, Type 2 AGNs are the hardest to identify, as can be expected. These results represent a promising step toward the development of tools that may support AGNs selection in future large-scale surveys such as LSST.

 - **Abstract**
 The inner regions of protoplanetary discs, which encompass the putative habitable zone, are dynamically complex, featuring a well ionised, turbulent active inner region and a poorly ionised dead outer region. In this first paper, we investigate a base level model of the magnetohydrodynamic processes around this dead-active zone interface, using five three-dimensional global magnetohydrodynamic simulations in the zero-net flux regime. We employ physically motivated profiles for Ohmic resistivity and ambipolar diffusion, alongside a simplified thermodynamic model comprising a hot disc and cool corona. Our results show that, first, large-scale coherent poloidal magnetic field loops form in the magnetorotational instability active region. These loops lead to the accumulation of tightly wound magnetic flux at the disc-corona temperature transition, driving strong, localised accretion flows in the surface layers of the active region. Second, an axisymmetric pressure maximum, that extends across multiple disc scale heights, develops as a result of outward mass transport from the active region. This triggers the Rossby wave instability and leads to the development of anticyclonic vortices, though their coherence is weakened due to the turbulent dynamics at the interface. Third, the dead zone develops magnetic field with a distinct morphology, likely resulting from the outward diffusion of large-scale poloidal loops in the active zone. This self-consistently generated field exhibits a vertical structure consistent with that required to drive accretion in the inner dead zone under the weak magnetic wind paradigm. In the second paper in the series, we extend this work to the vertical-net flux regime, where global magnetic flux transport and magnetically driven outflows become dynamically significant.

 - **Abstract**
 The evolution of magnetic braking and dynamo processes in subgiant stars is essential for understanding how these stars lose angular momentum. We investigate the magnetic braking and dynamo evolution of $\beta$ Hydri, a G-type subgiant, to test the hypothesis of weakened magnetic braking and the potential rejuvenation of large-scale magnetic fields. We analyze spectropolarimetric observations from HARPS (HARPSpol; polarimetric mode of High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher), and combine them with archival X-ray data and asteroseismic properties from TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite) to estimate the current wind braking torque of $\beta$ Hydri. Despite experiencing weakened magnetic braking during the second half of its main-sequence lifetime, our results indicate that $\beta$ Hydri has regained significant magnetic activity and a large-scale magnetic field. This observation aligns with the "born-again" dynamo hypothesis. Furthermore, our estimated wind braking torque is considerably stronger than what would be expected for a star in the weakened magnetic braking regime. This suggests that subgiants with extended convective zones can temporarily re-establish large-scale dynamo action. These results provide critical constraints on stellar rotation models and improve our understanding of the interplay between magnetic field structure, stellar activity cycles, and angular momentum evolution in old solar-type stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Detecting orbital eccentricity in a stellar-mass black-hole merger would point to a non-isolated formation channel. Eccentric binaries can form in dense stellar environments such as globular clusters or active galactic nuclei, or from triple stellar systems in the Galactic field. However, confidently measuring eccentricity is challenging -- short signals from high-mass eccentric mergers can mimic spin-induced precession, making the two effects hard to disentangle. This degeneracy weakens considerably for longer-duration signals. Here, GW200208_222617 provides a rare opportunity. Originating from a relatively low-mass binary with source-frame chirp mass $\sim20$ M$_\odot$, its gravitational-wave signal spanned $\sim14$ orbital cycles in band, with no indication of data quality issues. Previous analyses for quasi-circular binaries found no evidence for spin precession and, multiple subsequent studies found the data to favour an eccentric merger despite notable technical differences. All in all, we believe GW200208_222617 is the black-hole merger event from GWTC-3 with the least ambiguous detection of eccentricity. We present a critical discussion of properties and astrophysical interpretation of GW200208_222617 as an eccentric black-hole merger using models of field triples, globular clusters, and active galactic nuclei. We find that if GW200208_222617 was indeed eccentric, its origin is consistent with a field triple or globular cluster. Formation in the inner regions of an active galactic nucleus is disfavoured. The outer regions of such a disk remain a viable origin for GW200208_222617; we demonstrate how future detections of eccentric mergers formed in such environments could be powerful tools for constraining the disk geometry.

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate atomic physics reference data are a crucial requirement for analysis and interpretation of observed spectra, even more so for observations with high spectral resolution. This document provides a curated list of atomic physics references frequently used for plasma diagnostics in X-ray spectroscopy, outside of comprehensive plasma models that typically come with their own underlying atomic databases. The list includes references to physical constants, laboratory benchmarks, transition energies, position and line shapes of neutral fluorescence lines, radiative branching ratios, and commonly used notation for prominent transitions. Quick-look tables for transition energies in H-, He-, and Li-like ions and line positions and shapes for fluorescence lines in neutrals. The main focus is on K-shell transitions. For the H- and He-like tables, we cite state-of-the art calculations that we consider currently the best available reference energies, which are considered high accuracy and thus typically used for energy scale calibration in laboratory measurements. Omissions in these tables are due to the lack of availability in the chosen references, and are not a statement about the relevance of these lines. Due to their complex and highly source-dependent line shape, the atomic data for neutrals is of lower accuracy than that for the highly charged ions, and the best reference data for these line shapes typically consist of empirical models derived from very high-resolution laboratory measurements. The table for neutrals provided here is consistent with the reference used for the energy gain scale calibration of XRISM/Resolve. This document is meant to serve as a resource to help find relevant references and conveniently formatted overview tables. When making use of the information found in these papers, credit should be given to their original authors by citing the appropriate references.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. AGNs are strong X-ray emitters shaped by disk-corona interactions. The soft excess (0.5-2.0 keV) reveals key information about the "warm corona" bridging the disk and hot corona. Yet, how this feature evolves with accretion properties remains poorly constrained, especially in large samples using spectral stacking. Aims. The eROSITA All-Sky Survey (eRASS:5) provides an unprecedented sample. We investigate how the average AGN X-ray spectra evolve with accretion parameters, and explore disk-corona connection by further combining stacked UV data. Methods. We developed Xstack, a novel tool that stacks rest-frame X-ray spectra and responses while preserving spectral shape through optimized weighting. We stack 17929 AGNs ("spec-z" sample, 23 Ms) with similar X-ray loudness alpha_ox, UV luminosity L_UV, and 4159 AGNs ("BH-mass" sample, 3 Ms) with similar Eddington ratio lambda_Edd and black hole mass M_BH. The resulting stacked X-ray spectra are analyzed with a phenomenological model. We further fit the stacked optical-UV-Xray SED with AGNSED model. Results. Soft excess strengthens strongly with alpha_ox and lambda_Edd (~5), while the hard X-ray spectral shape remains largely unchanged, supporting that soft excess is dominated by warm corona rather than reflection. AGNSED modeling reveals that warm corona radius (R_g units) generally increases with lambda_Edd and decreases with M_BH, or equivalently the disk-to-warm-corona transition consistently occurs near 1e4 K. The hot corona contracts with lambda_Edd and is unaffected by M_BH, aligning with disk evaporation predictions. Conclusions. The soft excess likely originates from a warm corona, with the disk to warm corona transition tied to hydrogen ionization near 1e4 K - supporting earlier eFEDS-HSC stacking results (Hagen et al. 2024). This study shows the strength of spectral stacking in probing AGN disk-corona physics.

 - **Abstract**
 Detecting anisotropic screening of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) holds the promise of revealing the distribution of gas in the Universe, characterizing the complex processes of galaxy formation and feedback, and studying the epoch of reionization. Estimators for inhomogeneous screening, including some recently proposed small-scale (stacked) estimators, are quadratic or higher order in the CMB temperature or polarization fields and are therefore subject to contamination from CMB lensing. We review the origin of this lensing bias and show that, when stacking on unWISE galaxies, the expected lensing bias dominates the signal if left unmitigated. Hardening techniques that null the lensing bias have been proposed for standard quadratic estimators, whereas only approximate methods have been proposed for stacked estimators. We review these techniques and apply the former to stacked estimators, presenting several strategies (including the optimal strategy) to null lensing contamination when stacking on any large-scale structure (LSS) tracer.
