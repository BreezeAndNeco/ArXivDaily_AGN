 - **Abstract**
 In the presence of a weak gravitational wave (GW) background, astrophysical binary systems act as high-quality resonators, with efficient transfer of energy and momentum between the orbit and a harmonic GW leading to potentially detectable orbital perturbations. In this work, we develop and apply a novel modeling and analysis framework that describes the imprints of GWs on binary systems in a fully time-resolved manner to study the sensitivity of lunar laser ranging, satellite laser ranging, and pulsar timing to both resonant and nonresonant GW backgrounds. We demonstrate that optimal data collection, modeling, and analysis lead to projected sensitivities which are orders of magnitude better than previously appreciated possible, opening up a new possibility for probing the physics-rich but notoriously challenging to access $\mu\mathrm{Hz}$ frequency GWs. We also discuss improved prospects for the detection of the stochastic fluctuations of ultra-light dark matter, which may analogously perturb the binary orbits.

 - **Abstract**
 The light curves of radioactive transients, such as supernovae and kilonovae, are powered by the decay of radioisotopes, which release high-energy leptons through $\beta^+$ and $\beta^-$ decays. These leptons deposit energy into the expanding ejecta. As the ejecta density decreases during expansion, the plasma becomes collisionless, with particle motion governed by electromagnetic forces. In such environments, strong or turbulent magnetic fields are thought to confine particles, though the origin of these fields and the confinement mechanism have remained unclear. Using fully kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, we demonstrate that plasma instabilities can naturally confine high-energy leptons. These leptons generate magnetic fields through plasma streaming instabilities, even in the absence of pre-existing fields. The self-generated magnetic fields slow lepton diffusion, enabling confinement and transferring energy to thermal electrons and ions. Our results naturally explain the positron trapping inferred from late-time observations of thermonuclear and core-collapse supernovae. Furthermore, they suggest potential implications for electron dynamics in the ejecta of kilonovae. We also estimate synchrotron radio luminosities from positrons for Type Ia supernovae and find that such emission could only be detectable with next-generation radio observatories from a Galactic or local-group supernova in an environment without any circumstellar material.

 - **Abstract**
 This study investigates the open clusters SAI 72 and SAI 75 using Gaia DR3 data, employing the Automated Stellar Cluster Analysis (ASteCA) tool to determine their structural and fundamental properties, including center coordinates, size, age, distance, mass, luminosity, and kinematics. Based on membership probabilities (P >= 50%), we identified 112 and 115 stars as probable members of SAI 72 and SAI 75, respectively. Radial density profile (RDP) analysis yielded cluster radii of 2.35 arcmin for SAI 72 and 2.19 arcmin for SAI 75. The spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting was performed to refine metallicity, distance, and color excess parameters, ensuring consistency within 1 sigma of isochrone-based estimates. Isochrone fitting of the color-magnitude diagram (CMD) suggests ages of 316 Myr and 302 Myr, with corresponding distances of 3160 +/- 80 pc and 3200 +/- 200 pc. We derived their Galactic positions, projected distances (X_sun, Y_sun), and vertical displacements (Z_sun). Mass function analysis estimates cluster masses of 612 +/- 174 solar masses for SAI 72 and 465 +/- 90 solar masses for SAI 75. Kinematic studies indicate that both clusters have reached dynamical equilibrium. The AD diagram method provided convergent point coordinates of (A, D)_o = (97.016 +/- 0.09, 4.573 +/- 0.05) for SAI 72 and (99.677 +/- 0.10, 1.243 +/- 0.09) for SAI 75. Orbital analysis confirms that both clusters follow nearly circular trajectories with low eccentricities and minor variations in apogalactic and perigalactic distances. Furthermore, we determine that SAI 72 and SAI 75 originated beyond the solar circle at R_Birth = 10.825 +/- 0.068 kpc and R_Birth = 9.583 +/- 0.231 kpc, respectively. Their maximum heights above the Galactic plane, Z_max, are 109 +/- 9 pc for SAI 72 and 232 +/- 24 pc for SAI 75, reinforcing their classification as part of the young stellar disc population.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of AGN activity within recently quenched massive galaxies at cosmic noon ($z\sim 2$), using deep Chandra X-ray observations of the Ultra-Deep Survey (UDS) field. Our sample includes over 4000 massive galaxies ($M_\ast > 10^{10.5}$ M$_{\odot}$) in the redshift range $1 < z < 3$, including more than 200 transitionary post-starburst (PSB) systems. We find that X-ray emitting AGN are detected in $6.2 \pm 1.5$ per cent of massive PSBs at these redshifts, a detection rate that lies between those of star-forming and passive galaxies ($8.2 \pm 0.5$ per cent and $5.7 \pm 0.8$ per cent, respectively). A stacking analysis shows that the average X-ray luminosity for PSBs is comparable to older passive galaxies, but a factor of $2.6 \pm 0.3$ below star-forming galaxies of similar redshift and stellar mass. The average X-ray luminosity in all populations appears to trace the star-formation rate, with PSBs showing low levels of AGN activity consistent with their reduced levels of star formation. We conclude that, on average, we see no evidence for excess AGN activity in the post-starburst phase. However, the low levels of AGN activity can be reconciled with the high-velocity outflows observed in many PSBs, assuming the rare X-ray detections represent short-lived bursts of black hole activity, visible $\sim$5 per cent of the time. Thus, X-ray AGN may help to maintain quiescence in massive galaxies at cosmic noon, but the evidence for a direct link to the primary quenching event remains elusive.
#### An In-depth Analysis of Photometric and Kinematic Characteristics of SAI 16, SAI 81 and SAI 86 Open Clusters Utilizing Gaia DR3

 - **Abstract**
 This study comprehensively analyzes three open star clusters: SAI 16, SAI 81, and SAI 86 using Gaia DR3 data. Based on the ASteCA code, we determined the most probable star candidates (P >= 50%) and estimated the number of star members of each cluster as 125, 158, and 138, respectively. We estimated the internal structural parameters by fitting the King model to the observed RDPs, including the core, limited, and tidal radii. The isochrone fitting to the color-magnitude diagram provided log(age) values of 9.13 +/- 0.04, 8.10 +/- 0.04, and 8.65 +/- 0.04 and distances of 3790 +/- 94 pc, 3900 +/- 200 pc, and 3120 +/- 30 pc for SAI 16, SAI 81, and SAI 86, respectively. We also calculated their projected distances from the Galactic plane (X_sun, Y_sun) as well as their vertical distances (Z_sun), Galactocentric distances (R_gc), and total masses (M_C) in solar units, which are about 142 +/- 12, 302 +/- 17, and 192 +/- 14 for SAI 16, SAI 81, and SAI 86, respectively. Examining the dynamical relaxation state indicates that all three clusters are dynamically relaxed. By undertaking a kinematic analysis of the cluster data, the space velocity was determined. We calculated the coordinates of the apex point (A_o, D_o) using the AD diagram method along with the derivation of the solar motion parameters (S_sun, l_A, b_A). Through our detailed dynamic orbit analysis, we determined that the three SAI clusters belong to the young stellar disc, confirming their membership within this component of the Galactic structure.
#### The (Limited) Effect of Viscosity in Multiphase Turbulent Mixing

 - **Abstract**
 Multiphase gas can be found in many astrophysical environments, such as galactic outflows, stellar wind bubbles, and the circumgalactic medium, where the interplay between turbulence, cooling, and viscosity can significantly influence gas dynamics and star formation processes. We investigate the role of viscosity in modulating turbulence and radiative cooling in turbulent radiative mixing layers (TRMLs). In particular, we aim to determine how different amounts of viscosity affect the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI), turbulence evolution, and the efficiency of gas mixing and cooling. Using idealized 2D numerical setups, we compute the critical viscosity required to suppress the KHI in shear flows characterized by different density contrasts and Mach numbers. These results are then used in a 3D shear layer setup to explore the impact of viscosity on cooling efficiency and turbulence across different cooling regimes. We find that the critical viscosity follows the expected dependence on overdensity and Mach number. Our viscous TRMLs simulations show different behaviors in the weak and strong cooling regimes. In the weak cooling regime, viscosity has a strong impact, resulting in laminar flows and breaking previously established inviscid relations between cooling and turbulence (albeit leaving the total luminosity unaffected). However, in the strong cooling regime, when cooling timescales are shorter than viscous timescales, key scaling relations in TRMLs remain largely intact. In this regime -- which must hold for gas to remain multiphase -- radiative losses dominate, and the system effectively behaves as non-viscous regardless of the actual level of viscosity. Our findings have direct implications for both the interpretation of observational diagnostics and the development of subgrid models in large-scale simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding gas flows between galaxies and their surrounding circum-galactic medium (CGM) is crucial to unveil the mechanisms regulating galaxy evolution, especially in the early Universe. However, observations of the CGM around massive galaxies at z>6 remain limited, particularly in the cold gas phase. In this work, we present multi-configuration ALMA observations of [CII]$\lambda158,\mu$m and millimetre continuum emission in the z~6.4 quasar PSOJ183+05, to trace the cold CGM and investigate the presence of outflows. We find clumpy [CII] emission, tracing gas up to a ~6 kpc radius, consistent with the interface region between the interstellar medium (ISM) and CGM. The [CII] kinematics shows a rotating disk and a high-velocity, biconical outflow extending up to 5 kpc. The inferred mass outflow rate is ~930 MSun/yr, among the highest at z>6, and comparable to the star-formation rate. These findings suggest that quasar-driven outflows can rapidly transfer energy and momentum to the CGM, without immediately quenching star formation in the host galaxy ISM. This supports a delayed feedback scenario, in which outflows reshape CGM conditions and regulate future gas accretion over longer timescales. Combining high-resolution and sensitive ALMA data with observations from JWST and MUSE will be crucial to map the CGM across its different phases and build a comprehensive picture of the baryon cycle in the first massive galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy mergers are pivotal events in the evolutionary history of galaxies, with their impact believed to be particularly significant in dwarf galaxies. We report the serendipitous identification of an isolated merging dwarf system with a total stellar mass of M$_{\rm \star}$$\sim$10$^{9.7}$M$_{\rm \odot}$, located in the centre of a cosmic void. This system is one of the rare examples, and possibly the first, of merging dwarf galaxy pairs studied within the central region of a cosmic void. Using CAVITY PPAK-IFU data combined with deep optical broadband imaging from the Isaac Newton Telescope, we analysed the kinematics and ionized gas properties of each dwarf galaxy in the system by employing a full spectral fitting technique. The orientation of this merging pair relative to the line of sight allowed us to determine the dynamical mass of each component, showing that both had similar dynamical masses within galactocentric distances of up to 2.9 kpc. While the gas-phase metallicity of both components is consistent with that of star-forming dwarf galaxies, the star formation rates observed in both components exceed those typically reported for equally massive star-forming dwarf galaxies. This indicates that the merger has presumably contributed to enhancing star formation. Furthermore, we found no significant difference in the optical g-r colour of this merging pair compared to other merging dwarf pairs across different environments. While most merging events occur in group-like environments with high galaxy density and the tidal influence of a host halo, and isolated mergers typically involve galaxies with significant mass differences, the identified merging pair does not follow these patterns. We speculate that the global dynamics of the void or past three-body encounters involving components of this pair and a nearby dwarf galaxy might have triggered this merging event.

 - **Abstract**
 The trans-neptunian object (58534) 1997 CQ$_{29}$ (a.k.a. Logos) is a resolved wide binary in the dynamically Cold Classical population. With Hubble Space Telescope resolved observations where the primary Logos is well separated from its secondary Zoe it can be established that Logos has a time-variable brightness. Logos' brightness varied by several tenths of a magnitude over a short timescale of hours while the brightness variability of Zoe was on a longer timescale. New unresolved ground-based observations obtained with the Lowell Discovery Telescope and the Magellan-Baade telescope confirm at least one highly variable component in this system. With our ground-based observations and photometric constraints from space-based observations, we suggest that the primary Logos is likely a close/contact binary whose rotational period is 17.43$\pm$0.06 h for a lightcurve amplitude of 0.70$\pm$0.07 mag while Zoe is potentially a (very) slow rotator with an unknown shape. Using the Candela software, we model the Logos-Zoe system and predict its upcoming mutual events season using rotational, physical, and mutual orbit parameters derived in this work or already published. Zoe's shape and rotational period are still uncertain, so we consider various options to better understand Zoe. The upcoming mutual event season for Logos-Zoe starts in 2026 and will last for four years with up to two events per year. Observations of these mutual events will allow us to significantly improve the physical and rotational properties of both Logos and Zoe.
#### Traversing the Star-Forming Main Sequence with Molecular Gas Stacks of z~1.6 Cluster Galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 The cluster environment has been shown to affect the molecular gas content of cluster members, yet a complete understanding of this often subtle effect has been hindered due to a lack of detections over the full parameter space of galaxy star formation rates and stellar masses. Here we stack CO(2-1) spectra of z~1.6 cluster galaxies to explore the average molecular gas fractions of galaxies both at lower mass (log(M/solar mass)~9.6) and further below the Star Forming Main Sequence (SFMS; DeltaMS~ -0.9) than other literature studies; this translates to a 3sigma gas mass limit of ~7x10^9 solar masses for stacked galaxies below the SFMS. We divide our sample of 54 z~1.6 cluster galaxies, derived from the Spitzer Adaptation of the Red-Sequence Cluster Survey, into 9 groupings, for which we recover detections in 8. The average gas content of the full cluster galaxy population is similar to coeval field galaxies matched in stellar mass and star formation rate. However, when further split by CO-undetected and CO-detected, we find that galaxies below the SFMS have statistically different gas fractions from the field scaling relations, spanning deficiencies to enhancements from 2sigma below to 3sigma above the expected field gas fractions, respectively. These differences between z=1.6 cluster and field galaxies below the SFMS are likely due to environmental processes, though further investigation of spatially-resolved properties and more robust field scaling relation calibration in this parameter space are required.
#### The Glow of Axion Quark Nugget Dark Matter: (III) The Mysteries of the Milky Way UV Background

 - **Abstract**
 Axion quark nuggets (AQNs) are hypothetical objects with nuclear density that would have formed during the quark-hadron transition and could make up most of the dark matter today. These objects have a mass greater than a few grams and are sub-micrometer in size. They would also help explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry and the similarity between visible and dark components of the universe, i.e. $\Omega_{\text{DM}} \sim \Omega_{\text{visible}}$. These composite objects behave as cold dark matter, interacting with ordinary matter and producing pervasive electromagnetic radiation. This work aims to calculate the FUV electromagnetic signature in a 1 kpc region surrounding the solar system, resulting from the interaction between antimatter AQNs and baryons. To this end, we use the high-resolution hydrodynamic simulation of the Milky Way, FIRE-2 Latter suite, to select solar system-like regions. From the simulated gas and dark matter distributions in these regions, we calculate the FUV background radiation generated by the AQN model. We find that the results are consistent with the FUV excess recently confirmed by the Alice spectrograph aboard New Horizons, which corroborated the FUV excess initially discovered by GALEX a decade ago. We also discuss the potential cosmological implications of our work, which suggest the existence of a new source of FUV radiation in galaxies, linked to the interaction between dark matter and baryons.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of auroras on exoplanets would provide numerous insights into planet-star systems, including potential detections of the planetary magnetic fields, constraints on host-star wind properties, and information on the thermal structures of planets. However, there have not yet been any discoveries of auroras on exoplanets. In this paper, we focus on the search for infrared auroral emission from the molecular ion H$_3^+$, which is common in the atmospheres of solar system planets Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus. Using Keck/NIRSPEC high-resolution spectroscopy, we search for H$_3^+$ emission from two hot Jupiters, WASP-80b and WASP-69b. We do not see any evidence of emission in the observed spectra when cross-correlating with an H$_3^+$ spectral model or when using an auto-correlation approach to search for any significant features. We therefore place upper limits on the total emission of $5.32 \times 10^{18}$ W for WASP-80b and $1.64 \times 10^{19}$ W for WASP-69b. These upper limits represent the most stringent limits to date and approach the regime of emission suspected from theoretical models.

 - **Abstract**
 Any attempt to understand the ubiquitous nature of the magnetic field in the present universe seems to lead us towards its primordial origin. For large-scale magnetic fields, however, their strength and length scale may not necessarily originate from a singular primordial mechanism, namely inflationary magnetogenesis, which has been a popular consideration in the literature. In this paper, we propose a minimal scenario wherein a large-scale magnetic field is generated from the inflationary perturbation without any non-conformal coupling. Due to their origin in the inflationary scalar spectrum, these primordial fields are inherently weak, with their strength suppressed by the small amplitude of scalar fluctuations. We then consider the coupling between this large-scale weak primordial magnetic field and a light axion of mass $<10^{-28}$ eV, which is assumed to be frozen in a misaligned state until the photon decoupling. After the decoupling, when the universe enters into a dark age, the light axion coherently oscillates. By appropriately tuning the axion-photon coupling parameter $\alpha$, we demonstrate that a large-scale magnetic field of sufficient strength can indeed be generated through tachyonic resonance. We further show that the produced magnetic field induces a unique spectrum with multiple peaks of secondary gravitational waves, which the upcoming CMB-S4 can probe through B-mode polarization. The strength can be sufficient enough to violate the PLANCK bound on tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \lesssim 0.036$. Such a violation leads to a constraint on $\alpha \lesssim 80$. With this limiting value of the coupling, we find that present-day magnetic field strength could be as high as $10^{-10}$ Gauss at $\Mpc$ scale, consistent with observation.

 - **Abstract**
 Inverse Compton scattering by the thermal motions of electrons is believed to produce polarized hard X-rays in active galactic nuclei and black-hole binaries. Meanwhile, plasma within the plunging region of the black hole free falls into the event horizon with a bulk relativistic speed, which could also imprint polarization on up-scattered photons but has not been discussed in detail. To examine this, we computed polarimetric signatures via general relativistic ray-tracing of a toy model consisting of an accreting, geometrically thin plasma with moderate optical depth, falling onto the black hole with a bulk relativistic speed within the plunging region. We show that the maximum spatially unresolved linear polarization could be as large as approximately $7 - 8$ percent when the black hole is viewed near edge-on, while the corresponding resolved linear polarization could be roughly $50$ percent. The large discrepancy between the two is due to 1) dilution from the radiation outside the plunging region and 2) substantial cancellations of the Stokes $Q$ and $U$ fluxes. The resultant polarization contributed by bulk Comptonization could nevertheless exceed that of thermal electron scattering in a Novikov-Thorne disk. Our results thus suggest a new model for imprinting considerable polarization on the electromagnetic observables of accreting black holes. Measurements of X-ray polarization from black-hole binaries and the central black hole of active galactic nuclei could provide direct detection of the plunging region and help constrain plasma properties in the immediate vicinity of the event horizon.
#### The Impact of Plasma Angular Momentum on Magnetically Arrested Flows and Relativistic Jets in Hot Accretion Flows Around Black Holes

 - **Abstract**
 In certain scenarios, the accreted angular momentum of plasma onto a black hole could be low; however, how the accretion dynamics depend on the angular momentum content of the plasma is still not fully understood. We present three-dimensional, general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of low angular momentum accretion flows around rapidly spinning black holes (with spin $a = +0.9$). The initial condition is a Fishbone-Moncrief (FM) torus threaded by a large amount of poloidal magnetic flux, where the angular velocity is a fraction $f$ of the standard value. For $f = 0$, the accretion flow becomes magnetically arrested and launches relativistic jets but only for a very short duration. After that, free-falling plasma breaks through the magnetic barrier, loading the jet with mass and destroying the jet-disk structure. Meanwhile, magnetic flux is lost via giant, asymmetrical magnetic bubbles that float away from the black hole. The accretion then exits the magnetically arrested state. For $f = 0.1$, the dimensionless magnetic flux threading the black hole oscillates quasi-periodically. The jet-disk structure shows concurrent revival and destruction while the gas outflow efficiency at the event horizon changes accordingly. For $f \geq 0.3$, we find that the dynamical behavior of the system starts to approach that of a standard accreting FM torus. Our results thus suggest that the accreted angular momentum is an important parameter that governs the maintenance of a magnetically arrested flow and launching of relativistic jets around black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work we examine the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in 2D angular and redshift space $\{\theta, \Delta z\}$, with $\Delta z$ denoting the redshift difference between two given angular shells. We thus work in the context of tomographic analyses of the large scale structure (LSS) where data are sliced in different redshift shells and constraints on Cosmology are extracted from the auto and cross-angular spectra of two different probes, namely the standard galaxy angular density fluctuations (ADF, or 2D clustering), and the galaxy angular redshift fluctuations (ARF). For these two observables we study by first time how the BAO peak arises in the $\{\theta, \Delta z\}$ plane. Despite being a weak feature (particularly for $\Delta z \neq 0$), a Fisher forecast analysis shows that, a priori, most of the information on cosmological and galaxy bias parameters is carried by the BAO features in shell auto- and cross-angular power spectra. The same study shows that a joint probe analysis (ADF+ARF) increases the Fisher determinant associated to cosmological parameters such as $H_0$ or the Dark Energy Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameters $\{w_0,w_a\}$ by at least an order of magnitude. We also study how the Fisher information on cosmological and galaxy bias-related parameters behaves under different redshift shell configurations: including cross-correlations to neighbour shells extending up to $(\Delta z)^{\rm tot}\sim 0.6$ ($(\Delta z)^{\rm tot}\sim 0.4$) for ADF (ARF) is required for Fisher information to converge. At the same time, configurations using narrow shell widths ($\sigma_z \leq 0.02$) preserve the cosmological information associated to peculiar velocities and typically yield Fisher determinants that are about two orders of magnitudes larger than for wider shell ($\sigma_z>0.02$) configurations.

 - **Abstract**
 This study presents a detailed timing analyses of two cataclysmic variables (CVs), [PK2008] HalphaJ115927 and IGR J14091-610, utilizing the optical data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). Periods of 7.20$\pm$0.02 h, 1161.49$\pm$0.14 s, and 1215.99$\pm$0.15 s are presented for [PK2008] HalphaJ115927, and are interpreted as the probable orbital, spin, and beat periods of the system, respectively. The presence of multiple periodic variations suggests that it likely belongs to the intermediate polar (IP) category of magnetic CVs. Interestingly, [PK2008] HalphaJ115927 exhibits a unique and strong periodic modulation at 5.66$\pm$0.29 d, which may result from the precession of an accretion disc, similar to the IP TV Col. The detection of a spin signal of 576.63$\pm$0.03 s and inferred orbital signal of $\sim$ 15.84 h supports the classification of IGR J14091-610 as an IP. The identification of such a long orbital period adds a new example to the limited population of long-period IPs. The observed dominant signal at the second harmonic of the orbital frequency also suggests ellipsoidal modulation of the secondary in this system. The observed double-peaked spin pulse profile in [PK2008] HalphaJ115927 likely results from two-pole accretion, where both poles contribute to the spin modulation, and their geometry allows equal visibility of both accreting poles. In contrast, IGR J14091-610 exhibits a single-peaked sinusoidal like spin pulse, attributed to the changing visibility of the accretion curtains due to a relatively low dipole inclination. The present observations indicate that accretion in both systems occurs predominantly through a disc.

 - **Abstract**
 Baryonic effects created by feedback processes associated with galaxy formation are an important, poorly constrained systematic effect for models of large-scale structure as probed by weak gravitational lensing. Upcoming surveys require fast methods to predict and marginalize over the potential impact of baryons on the total matter power spectrum. Here we use the FLAMINGO cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to test a recent proposal to approximate the matter power spectrum as the sum of the linear matter power spectrum and a constant multiple, $A_{\rm mod}$, of the difference between the linear and non-linear gravity-only power spectra. We show that replacing this constant multiple with a one-parameter family of sigmoid functions of the wavenumber $k$ allows to us match the predictions of simulations with different feedback strengths for $z \leq 1, k < 3~h\cdot{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, and the different cosmological models in the FLAMINGO suite. The baryonic response predicted by FLAMINGO models that use jet-like AGN feedback instead of the fiducial thermally-driven AGN feedback can also be reproduced, but at the cost of increasing the number of parameters in the sigmoid function from one to three. The assumption that $A_{\rm mod}$ depends only on $k$ breaks down for decaying dark matter models, highlighting the need for more advanced baryon response models when studying cosmological models that deviate strongly from $\Lambda$CDM.

 - **Abstract**
 The variability mechanisms from jetted AGNs are still under debate. Here the damped random walk (DRW) model, implemented through Gaussian Processe (GPs), is used to fit the $ZTF$ long-term optical light curves of 1684 $\gamma$-ray emission jetted AGNs. This analysis yields one of the largest samples with characteristic optical variability timescales for jetted AGNs. A single DRW model from GPs can fit the optical light curve of most jetted AGNs well/potentially well, while there are still some jetted AGNs whose light curve can not be fitted well by a single DRW model. After the jet power, proxied by gamma-ray luminosity, is introduced as a new parameter, new relationships among intrinsic variability time scales, black hole mass and jet power are discovered for efficient accretion AGNs ($\tau^{\rm in} \propto M_{\rm BH}^{0.29^{+0.06}_{-0.06}}P_{\rm jet}^{-0.3^{+0.03}_{-0.03}}$ with scatter of approximately 0.09~dex) and for inefficient accretion AGNs ($\tau^{\rm in} \propto M_{\rm BH}^{0.06^{+0.07}_{-0.07}}P_{\rm jet}^{0.37^{+0.11}_{-0.11}}$ with scatter of approximately 0.14~dex), respectively. Our results support that the optical variability of jetted AGNs with efficient accretion may originate within the standard accretion disk at UV emitting radii similar to non-jetted AGNs, and is directly related to the acceleration of shock in the jet and then enhanced through the beaming effect in beamed AGNs. For the jetted AGNs with inefficient accretion, the intrinsic timescale is consistent with the escape timescale of electrons.

 - **Abstract**
 X-ray observations can be used to effectively probe the galactic ecosystem, particularly its hot and energetic components. However, existing X-ray studies of nearby star-forming galaxies are limited by insufficient data statistics and a lack of suitable spectral modeling to account for X-ray emission and absorption geometry. We present results from an X-ray spectral study of M51 using 1.3-Ms Chandra data, the most extensive for such a galaxy. This allows the extraction of diffuse X-ray emission spectra from spiral arm phase-dependent regions using a logarithmic spiral coordinate system. A hierarchical Bayesian approach analyzes these spectra, testing models from simple 1-T hot plasma to those including distributed hot plasma and X-ray-absorbing cool gas. We recommend a model fitting the spectra well, featuring a galactic corona with a lognormal temperature distribution and a disk with mixed X-ray emissions and absorption. In this model, only half of the coronal emission is subject to internal absorption. The best-fit absorbing gas column density is roughly twice that inferred from optical extinction of stellar light. The temperature distribution shows a mean temperature of $\sim 0.1$ keV and an average one-dex dispersion that is enhanced on the spiral arms. The corona's radiative cooling might balance the mechanical energy input from stellar feedback. These results highlight the effectiveness of X-ray mapping of the corona and cool gas in spiral galaxies.
#### Hydrogen-poor Superluminous Supernovae with Bumpy Light Curves Powered by Precessing Magnetars

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations and statistical studies have revealed that a significant fraction of hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe-I) exhibit light curves that deviate from the smooth evolution predicted by the magnetar-powered model, instead showing one or more bumps after the primary peak. However, the formation mechanisms of these post-peak bumps remain a matter of debate. Furthermore, previous studies employing the magnetar-powered model have typically assumed a fixed magnetic inclination angle and neglected the effects of magnetar precession. However, recent research has shown that the precession of newborn magnetars forming during the collapse of massive stars causes the magnetic inclination angle to evolve over time, thereby influencing magnetic dipole radiation. In this paper, therefore, we incorporate the effects of magnetar precession into the magnetar-powered model to develop the precessing magnetar-powered model. Using this model, we successfully reproduce the multi-band light curves of 6 selected representative SLSNe-I with post-peak bumps. Moreover, the derived model parameters fall within the typical parameter range for SLSNe-I. By combining the precessing magnetars in SLSNe-I and long GRBs, we find that the ellipticity of magnetars is related to the dipole magnetic field strength, which may suggest a common origin for the two phenomena. Our work provides a potential explanation for the origin of post-peak bumps in SLSNe-I and offers evidence for the early precession of newborn magnetars formed in supernova explosions.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper reports on the detection of a likely explosive outflow in the high-mass star-forming complex G34.26+0.15, adding to the small number (six) of explosive outflows detected so far. ALMA CO(2-1) and SiO(5-4) archival observations reveal multiple outflow streamers from G34.26+0.15, which correlate well with H2 jets identified from Spitzer-IRAC 4.5 um and [4.5]/[3.6] flux ratio maps. These nearly linear outflow streamers originate from a common center within an ultracompact HII region located in the complex. The velocity spread of the outflow streamers ranges from 0 to 120 km/s. The radial velocities of these streamers follow the Hubble-Lemaître velocity law, indicating an explosive nature. From the CO emission, the total outflow mass, momentum, and outflow energy are estimated to be ~264 M_sun, 4.3*10^3 M_sun km/s, and 10^48 erg, respectively. The event triggering the outflow may have occurred about 19,000 years ago and could also be responsible for powering the expanding UC HII region, given the similar dynamical ages and positional coincidence of the UC HII region with the origin of the outflow. The magnetic field lines in the region associated with G34.26+0.15 also appear to align with the direction of the outflow streamers and jets, possibly being dragged by the explosive outflow.

 - **Abstract**
 SiO masers from AGB stars exhibit variability in intensity and polarization during a pulsation period. This variability is explained by radiative transfer and magnetic properties of the molecule. To investigate this phenomenon, a 3D maser simulation is employed to study the SiO masers based on Zeeman splitting. We demonstrate that the magnetic field direction affects maser polarization within small tubular domains with isotropic pumping, and yields results that are similar to those obtained from 1D modelling. This work also studies larger clouds with different shapes. We use finite-element domains with internal node distributions to represent the maser-supporting clouds. We calculate solutions for the population inversions in all transitions and at every node. These solutions show that saturation begins near the middle of a domain, moving towards the edges and particularly the ends of long axes, as saturation progresses, influencing polarization. When the observer's view of the domain changes, the plane of linear polarization responds to the projected shape and the projected magnetic field axis. The angle between the observer's line of sight and the magnetic field may cause jumps in the plane of polarization. Therefore, we can conclude that polarization is influenced by both the cloud's major axis orientation and magnetic field direction. We have investigated the possibility of explaining observed polarization plane rotations, apparently within a single cloud, by the mechanism of line-of-sight overlap of two magnetized maser clouds.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic rays are often modeled as charged particles. This allows their non-ballistic propagation in magnetized structures to be captured. In certain situations, a neutral cosmic ray component can arise. For example, cosmic ray neutrons are produced in considerable numbers through hadronic pp and p$\gamma$ interactions. At ultrahigh energies, the decay timescales of these neutrons is dilated, allowing them to traverse distances on the scale of galactic and cosmological structures. Unlike charged cosmic rays, neutrons are not deflected by magnetic fields. They propagate ballistically at the speed of light in straight lines. The presence of a neutral baryonic cosmic ray component formed in galaxies, clusters and cosmological filaments can facilitate the escape and leakage of cosmic rays from magnetic structures that would otherwise confine them. We show that, by allowing confinement breaking, the formation of cosmic-ray neutrons by high-energy hadronic interactions in large scale astrophysical structures can modify the exchange of ultra high-energy particles across magnetic interfaces between galaxies, clusters, cosmological filaments and voids.

 - **Abstract**
 We search for possible GeV-TeV gamma-ray imprints of ultrahigh-energy (UHE; $\gtrsim 0.1$ EeV) cosmic ray (CR) acceleration in the large-scale structures surrounding the brightest gamma-ray burst (GRB) explosion, GRB 221009A. Using 1.25 years of post-event Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) data, we construct a 1 GeV - 1 TeV test-statistic (TS) map within 15 Mpc of the burst. We identify two peaks in the TS map with TS $\geq 9$. The most significant peak, J1911.8+2044, exhibits gamma-ray emission in pre-burst LAT data. The other peak, J1913.2+1901, coincides with a 664.6 GeV photon recorded $\sim191.9$ days after the GRB trigger and located at about $0.75^{\circ}$ from the GRB localization. The per-photon 95% containment angle for the LAT is about $0.25^{\circ}$ in the 100 GeV - 1 TeV energy range. We explore two possible origins for the $\gamma$-ray emission: (1) UHECRs from GRB 221009A propagating through a magnetized cosmological volume in its vicinity, and (2) UHE or very-high-energy (VHE; $\gtrsim 100$ GeV) $\gamma$-ray emission from GRB 221009A, propagating in the same volume. In both cases, electromagnetic cascade emission is induced in the structured region embedding the burst. If any TS features are related to large-scale imprints induced by cosmic rays, it might be further evidence that GRB 221009A accelerated UHECRs. However, our results show that alternative scenarios without invoking UHECRs cannot be ruled out, and the observed high-energy photon could be unrelated to GRB 221009A.

 - **Abstract**
 (Aims) Hot Dust Obscured Galaxies (Hot DOGs) are a population of hyper-luminous, heavily obscured quasars. Although nuclear obscurations close to Compton-thick are typical, a fraction show blue UV spectral energy distributions consistent with unobscured quasar activity, albeit two orders of magnitude fainter than expected from their mid-IR luminosity. The origin of the UV emission in these Blue excess Hot DOGs (BHDs) has been linked to scattered light from the central engine. Here we study the properties of the UV emission in the BHD WISE J020446.13-050640.8 (W0204-0506). (Methods) We use imaging polarization observations in the $R_{\rm Special}$ band obtained with the FORS2 instrument at VLT. We compare these data with radiative transfer simulations to constrain the characteristics of the scattering material. (Results) We find a spatially integrated polarization fraction of $24.7\pm 0.7$%, confirming the scattered-light nature of the UV emission of W0204-0506. The source is spatially resolved in the observations and we find a gradient in polarization fraction and angle that is aligned with the extended morphology of the source found in HST/WFC3 imaging. A dusty, conical polar outflow starting at the AGN sublimation radius with a half-opening angle $\lesssim 50~\rm deg$ viewed at an inclination $\gtrsim 45~\rm deg$ can reproduce the observed polarization fraction if the dust is graphite-rich. We find that the gas mass and outflow velocity are consistent with the range of values found for [OIII] outflows through spectroscopy in other Hot DOGs, though it is unclear whether the outflow is energetic enough to affect the long-term evolution of the host galaxy. Our study highlights the unique potential for polarization imaging to study dusty quasar outflows, providing complementary constraints to those obtained through traditional spectroscopic studies.
#### Small-scale dynamic phenomena associated with interacting fan-spine topologies: quiet-Sun Ellerman bombs, UV brightenings, and chromospheric inverted-Y-shaped jets

 - **Abstract**
 QSEBs are small-scale magnetic reconnection events in lower solar atmosphere. Sometimes, they exhibit transition region counterparts, known as UV brightenings. Magnetic field extrapolations suggest that QSEBs can occur at various locations of a fan-spine topology, with UV brightening occurring at null point through a common reconnection process. We aim to understand how complex magnetic configurations like interacting fan-spine topologies can cause small-scale dynamic phenomena in lower atmosphere. QSEBs were detected using k-means clustering on Hbeta observations from Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST). Further, chromospheric inverted-Y-shaped jets were identified in the Hbeta blue wing. Magnetic field topologies were determined through potential field extrapolations from photospheric magnetograms using the Fe I 6173 A line. UV brightenings were detected in IRIS 1400 A SJI. We identify two distinct magnetic configurations associated with QSEBs, UV brightenings, and chromospheric inverted-Y-shaped jets. The first involves a nested fan-spine structure where, due to flux emergence, an inner 3D null forms inside fan surface of an outer 3D null with some overlap. QSEBs occur at two footpoints along the shared fan surface, with UV brightening located near the outer 3D null point. The jet originates close to the two QSEBs and follows the path of high squashing factor Q. We discuss a comparable scenario using a numerical simulation. In second case, two adjacent fan-spine topologies share fan footpoints at a common positive polarity patch, with the QSEB, along with a chromospheric inverted-Y-shaped jet, occurring at the intersection having high Q values. This study demonstrates through observational and modelling support that associated QSEBs, UV brightenings, and chromospheric inverted-Y-shaped jets share a common origin driven by magnetic reconnection between interacting fan-spine topologies.

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of the 244 EeV Amaterasu event by the Telescope Array, one of the most energetic ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs; $E\gtrsim0.1$ EeV) observed to date, invites scrutiny of its potential source. We investigate whether the nearby blazar PKS 1717+177, located within $2.5^\circ$ of the reconstructed arrival direction, could explain the event under a proton-primary hypothesis. Using a one-zone jet model, we fit the multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution of the source, incorporating both leptonic and hadronic cascade emission from photohadronic interactions. Our model supports a cosmic-ray origin of the very-high-energy ($E\gtrsim 100$ GeV) $\gamma$-ray flux and predicts a subdominant neutrino flux, an order of magnitude lower than from TXS 0506+056. Under Lorentz invariance violation, protons above a specific energy can propagate over hundreds of Mpc without significant energy loss for certain parameter choices. In such a scenario, our analysis indicates negligible deflection in the Galactic magnetic field, implying a strong extragalactic magnetic field, placing a lower bound on the field strength. Our findings provide a compelling multi-messenger framework linking UHECRs, $\gamma$ rays, and neutrinos and motivate targeted searches by current and future high-energy neutrino telescopes during increased $\gamma$-ray or X-ray activity of this blazar.

 - **Abstract**
 Jets and disc winds play an important role in the evolution of protoplanetary discs and the formation of planetary systems. However, there is still a lack of observational data regarding the presence and parameters of outflows, especially for close young binaries. In this study, we aim to find the HH flow near the young sub-arcsecond binary DF Tau and explore its morphology. Narrow-band H$\alpha$ and H$_2$ 2.12 $\mu$m imaging and spectroscopic observations of DF Tau and its vicinity were performed. We have discovered several emission nebulae near the binary, which likely result from the interaction of gas outflow from the binary components with the surrounding medium. The outflow appears to occur both in the form of jets, generating numerous Herbig-Haro objects (HH 1266 flow), and as a weakly collimated wind responsible for the formation of the ring-like nebula around the binary and the rim of the cometary globule. We have found that the angle between the jet and the counter-jet is $168^\circ$ and discuss the complex morphology of the HH flow.

 - **Abstract**
 Deconvolution, imaging and calibration of data from radio interferometers is a challenging computational (inverse) problem. The upcoming generation of radio telescopes poses significant challenges to existing, and well proven data reduction pipelines due to the large data sizes expected from these experiments, and the high resolution and dynamic range. In this manuscript, we deal with the deconvolution problem. A variety of multiscalar variants to the classical CLEAN algorithm (the de-facto standard) have been proposed in the past, often outperforming CLEAN at the cost of significantly increasing numerical resources. In this work, we aim to combine some of these ideas for a new algorithm, Autocorr-CLEAN, to accelerate the deconvolution and prepare the data reduction pipelines for the data sizes expected by the upcoming generation of instruments. To this end, we propose to use a cluster of CLEAN components fitted to the autocorrelation function of the residual in a subminor loop, to derive continuously changing, and potentially non-radially symmetric, basis functions for CLEANing the residual. Autocorr-CLEAN allows for the superior reconstruction fidelity achieved by modern multiscalar approaches, and their superior convergence speed. It achieves this without utilizing any substep of super-linear complexity in the minor loops, keeping the single minor loop and subminor loop iterations at an execution time comparable to CLEAN. Combining these advantages, Autocorr-CLEAN is found to be up to a magnitude faster than the classical CLEAN procedure. Autocorr-CLEAN fits well in the algorithmic framework common for radio interferometry, making it relatively straightforward to include in future data reduction pipelines. With its accelerated convergence speed, and smaller residual, Autocorr-CLEAN may be an important asset for the data analysis in the future.
