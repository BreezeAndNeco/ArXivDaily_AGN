 - **Abstract**
 The extended narrow line region (NLR) of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) provides a valuable laboratory for exploring the relationship between AGN and their host galaxies, often appearing as an ''ionization cone'' that can extend out to the very edge of the galaxy. We use new James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRCam imaging to study the morphologies and sizes of NLRs traced by [O III] at cosmic noon ($z\sim2-3$), measurements which were previously only well-studied at $z\sim0$ with IFU spectroscopy. To determine NIRCam's ability to probe the properties of the NLR in cosmic noon galaxies, we present simulated images of AGN at $z=2-3$ created with archival data cubes from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) of nine nearby ($z<0.05$) AGN host galaxies with previously confirmed extended NLRs. Our simulated images show that NIRCam is able to resolve the morphologies of NLRs at $z=2-3$ with narrow- and medium-band observations. We then search for extended NLRs with NIRCam medium-band observations targeting the [O III] emission in twenty-seven previously identified AGN at $z=2.4-3.4$ in the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey South (GOODS-S) field. We detect six galaxies in our observed sample with [O III] morphologies consistent with AGN ionization cones with characteristic NLR sizes of $1-2.5$ kpc. Thanks to our simulated data, we can predict the effects of cosmological surface brightness dimming and instrument noise on the NLR size measurements at high redshift, which has the biasing effect of lowering the NLR size-AGN Luminosity trend that is observed at low redshift by a factor of $\sim 2$.

 - **Abstract**
 Transient astronomy in the early, high-redshift (z>3) Universe is an unexplored regime that offers the possibility of probing the first stars and the Epoch of Reionization. During Cycles 1 and 2 of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) program enabled one of the first searches for transients in deep images (~ $30$ AB mag) over a relatively wide area ($25$ arcmin$^2$). One transient, AT 2023adsv, was discovered with an F200W magnitude of $28.04$ AB mag, and subsequent JWST observations revealed that the transient is a likely supernova (SN) in a host with $z_{\rm spec}=3.613\pm0.001$, a host mass of log(M$_{*}$/M$_\odot$) = $8.41^{+0.12}_{-0.12}$, and an inferred metallicity at the position of the SN of Z$_{*}$ = $0.3\pm0.1$ Z$_\odot$. At this redshift, the first detections in F115W and F150W show that AT 2023adsv had bright rest-frame ultraviolet flux at the time of discovery. The multi-band light curve of AT 2023adsv is best matched by a template of an SN IIP, with a peak absolute magnitude of $-18.3$ AB mag in the rest-frame $B$-band. We model AT 2023adsv's light curve and find a good match to a $20M_\odot$ red supergiant progenitor star with an explosion energy of $2.0\times 10^{51}$ ergs, likely higher than normally observed in the local Universe, but consistent with SNe IIP drawn from local, lower metallicity environments. AT 2023adsv is the most distant photometrically classified SN IIP yet discovered with a spectroscopic redshift measurement, and may represent a global shift in SNe IIP properties as a function of redshift. This discovery, and the ones sure to follow, demonstrate the continued need for facilities like JWST to build a statistical sample of core-collapse SNe to understand the evolution of their properties, and to constrain the poorly understood relationship between progenitor metallicity and massive star evolution.
#### XRISM reveals low non-thermal pressure in the core of the hot, relaxed galaxy cluster Abell 2029

 - **Abstract**
 We present XRISM Resolve observations of the core of the hot, relaxed galaxy cluster Abell 2029. We find that the line-of-sight bulk velocity of the intracluster medium (ICM) within the central 180 kpc is at rest with respect to the Brightest Cluster Galaxy, with a 3-sigma upper limit of |v_bulk| < 100 km/s. We robustly measure the field-integrated ICM velocity dispersion to be sigma_v = 169 +/- 10 km/s, obtaining similar results for both single-temperature and two-temperature plasma models to account for the cluster cool core. This result, if ascribed to isotropic turbulence, implies a subsonic ICM with Mach number M_3D ~ 0.21 and a non-thermal pressure fraction of 2%. The turbulent velocity is similar to what was measured in the core of the Perseus cluster by Hitomi, but here in a more massive cluster with an ICM temperature of 7 keV, the limit on non-thermal pressure fraction is even more stringent. Our result is consistent with expectations from simulations of relaxed clusters, but it is on the low end of the predicted distribution, indicating that Abell 2029 is an exceptionally relaxed cluster with no significant impacts from either a recent minor merger or AGN activity.

 - **Abstract**
 The 2017 observing campaign of the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) delivered the first very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) images at the observing frequency of 230 GHz, leading to a number of unique studies on black holes and relativistic jets from active galactic nuclei (AGN). In total, eighteen sources were observed: the main science targets, Sgr A* and M87 along with various calibrators. We investigated the morphology of the sixteen AGN in the EHT 2017 data set, focusing on the properties of the VLBI cores: size, flux density, and brightness temperature. We studied their dependence on the observing frequency in order to compare it with the Blandford-Königl (BK) jet model. We modeled the source structure of seven AGN in the EHT 2017 data set using linearly polarized circular Gaussian components and collected results for the other nine AGN from dedicated EHT publications, complemented by lower frequency data in the 2-86 GHz range. Then, we studied the dependences of the VLBI core flux density, size, and brightness temperature on the frequency measured in the AGN host frame. We compared the observations with the BK jet model and estimated the magnetic field strength dependence on the distance from the central black hole. Our results indicate a deviation from the standard BK model, particularly in the decrease of the brightness temperature with the observing frequency. Either bulk acceleration of the jet material, energy transfer from the magnetic field to the particles, or both are required to explain the observations.
#### The MeerKAT Fornax Survey IV. A close look at the cluster physics through the densest rotation measure grid

 - **Abstract**
 Using the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) mid precursor MeerKAT, we acquired broadband spectro-polarimetric data in the context of the MeerKAT Fornax Survey to study the Fornax cluster's magnetic fields in detail by building the densest rotation measure (RM) grid to date. Here, we present the survey, the analysis, and a discussion of the RM grid properties. We analyzed a circular region centered on the Fornax cluster center with a radius of $\sim1.4^\circ$; that is, $\rm\sim 0.73 R_{vir}$. The mosaics have a resolution of 13arcsec and cover the frequencies between 900\,MHz and 1.4\,GHz, reaching an average noise of 16$\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ in total intensity and 3$\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ in the Q and U Stokes images. With these data, we detected 508 polarized sources over an area of $\sim$6.35 deg$^2$ corresponding to a density of $\sim$80 polarized sources/deg$^2$. This is the densest RM grid ever built. Of the polarized sources, five are cluster sources. Excluding the cluster sources, we built the Euclidean-normalized differential source counts in polarization and we went a factor of ten deeper than previous surveys. We tentatively detect for the first time an increment in the differential source counts at low polarized flux densities; that is, $\sim$9\,$\mu$Jy at 1.4\,GHz. The average degree of polarization of about 3--4\% suggests that the sub$-\mu$Jansky population is not dominated by star-forming galaxies, typically showing a degree of polarization lower than 1\%. The majority of the polarized sources are Faraday simple; in other words, their polarization plane rotates linearly with the wavelength squared. The RM shows the typical decrement going from the center to the outskirts of the Fornax cluster. However, interesting features are observed both in the RM grid and in the RM radial profiles across different directions. A combination of the ...

 - **Abstract**
 Upon their evaporation via Hawking radiation, primordial black holes (PBHs) may deposit energy in the ambient plasma on scales smaller than the typical distance between two black holes, leading to the formation of hot spots around them. We investigate how the corresponding rise of the local temperature during the evaporation may act as a shield against the release of low-energy photons, affecting PBH's capacity to dissociate light nuclei after Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis through photo-dissociation. We study the different ways PBH hot spots affect the flux of low-energy photons expected from PBH evaporation, and we find that such effects can be particularly relevant to the physics of photo-dissociation during Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis for PBHs with masses between $10^{11}$g and $3\times 10^{12}$g. We emphasize that the magnitude of this effect is highly dependent on the specific shape of the temperature profile around PBHs and its time evolution. This underscores the necessity for a comprehensive study of PBH hot spots and their dynamics in the future.

 - **Abstract**
 Space-based experiments, either orbiting the Earth or from scientific balloon altitudes, measure high-energy cosmic rays by measuring from above the atmosphere the optical and radio signals generated by extensive air showers (EAS). These experiments are designed to have a large field-of-view (FoV) for observing EAS which translates to monitoring the atmosphere over a large, $\sim 10^6$ km$^2$ area on the ground. Ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs, $E_{CR} > ~\sim 1$ EeV) are measured by using the isotropic near-UV air fluorescence signal to finely sample the EAS development and to efficiently use the atmosphere as a vast calorimeter. At UHE, these immense EAS particle cascades have sufficient charged particle content to generate the relatively dim fluorescence light that propagates to the space-based instrument. Additionally, the beamed Cherenkov light and geomagnetic radio emission from EAS arrive with $> ~\sim 10$ ns impulse and are measured at small angles away from the cosmic ray trajectories. In particular for optical Cherenkov measurements, the energy thresholds can be $> ~\sim 1$ PeV, i.e. for very-high energy cosmic rays (VHECRs). ... In this chapter, the nature of observing the UHECR-induced shower development from orbiting and balloon-borne experiments is detailed, both for missions that have been flown and those currently in development. This will be accomplished by discussing experimental performance in terms of measuring the UHECR spectrum, UHECR nuclear composition, and UHECR arrival direction. The ability for these experiments to also perform VHECR and VHE and UHE cosmic neutrino measurements will also be discussed.
#### An Exceptionally Powerful, Radiatively Driven Ultrafast Outflow in the Rapidly Accreting AGN REJ1034+396

 - **Abstract**
 We report the analysis of ~1Ms of XMM-Newton observations of the rapidly accreting active galactic nucleus REJ1034+396. The 0.3-9 keV EPIC-pn spectra are well described by a model consisting of steep continuum emission from the corona accompanied by relativistically-blurred reflection from a highly ionized accretion disk. The source is known to exhibit strong excess soft X-ray emission, which we show is well represented by thermal disk photons Comptonized by a warm plasma spanning the inner accretion flow. Additionally, the EPIC-pn data provide compelling evidence ($\Delta C\sim60$ for 4 additional parameters) for the presence of an ultrafast outflow (UFO) with a line-of-sight velocity $v/c=0.307^{+0.001}_{-0.005}$, and an emission signature consistent with reflection of the corona from modestly ionized, outflowing gas. The simultaneous $0.5-2.5$\,keV RGS spectra show clear absorption lines. Modelling of these data confirms the presence of the UFO and constrains its equivalent hydrogen column density, log $N_\mathrm{H}/$(atom cm$^{-2}$) = $21.7^{+0.1}_{-0.2}$. The RGS data also reveal at least two warm absorber components with a modest outflow velocity ($1680^{+40}_{-50}$ km/s). The measured properties and time evolution of the UFO in REJ1034+396 suggest that it is formed from collisionally ionized plasma, launched from the disk surface and accelerated by radiation pressure. The high terminal velocity and substantial absorbing column density imply that the outflow carries sufficient momentum and energy to transform its environment, being capable of driving out essentially all dust and gas it interacts with along the line of sight, even if the AGN were initially surrounded by a Compton thick absorber.

 - **Abstract**
 The interstellar medium of galaxies is filled with holes, bubbles, and shells, typically interpreted as remnants of stellar evolution. There is growing interest in the study of their properties to investigate stellar and supernova feedback. So far, the detection of cavities in observational and numerical data is mostly done visually and, hence, is prone to biases. Therefore, we present an automated, objective method for discovering cavities in particle simulations, with demonstrations using hydrodynamical simulations of a dwarf galaxy. The suggested technique extracts holes based on the persistent homology of particle positions and identifies tight boundary points around each. With a synthetic ground-truth analysis, we investigate the relationship between data density and the detection radius, demonstrating that higher data density also allows for the robust detection of smaller cavities. By tracking the boundary points, we can measure the shape and physical properties of the cavity, such as its temperature. In this contribution, we detect 808 holes in 21 simulation snapshots. We classified the holes into supernova-blown bubbles and cavities unrelated to stellar feedback activity based on their temperature profile and expansion behaviour during the 100 million years covered by the simulation snapshots analysed for this work. Surprisingly, less than 40% of the detected cavities can unequivocally be linked to stellar evolution. Moreover, about 36% of the cavities are contracting, while 59% are expanding. The rest do not change for a few million years. Clearly, it is erroneous to interpret observational data based on the premise that all cavities are supernova-related and expanding. This study reveals that supernova-driven bubbles typically exhibit smaller diameters, larger expansion velocities, and lower kinetic ages (with a maximum of 220 million years) compared to other cavities.

 - **Abstract**
 We report our findings on a spectroscopic survey of seven unresolved DA+DB binary white dwarf candidates. We have discovered extreme spectroscopic variations in one of these candidates, SDSS J084716.21+484220.40. Previous analysis failed to reproduce the optical spectrum using a single object with a homogeneous atmosphere. Our time-resolved spectroscopy reveals a double-faced white dwarf that switches between a DBA and DA spectral type over 6.5 or 8.9 hours due to varying surface abundances. We also provide time-series spectroscopy of the magnetic DBA, SDSS J085618.94+161103.6 (LB 8915), and confirm an inhomogeneous atmosphere. We employ an atmosphere model with hydrogen caps and a helium belt that yields excellent fits to our time-resolved spectra. We use the oblique rotator model to derive the system geometry for both targets. With the addition of these two objects, the emerging class of double-faced white dwarfs now consists of seven members. We summarize the properties of this new class of objects, and discuss how magnetism impacts the convective processes and leads to the formation of double-faced white dwarfs. We identify cooler versions of white dwarfs with inhomogeneous atmospheres among the cool magnetic DA white dwarf sample, where the H$\alpha$ line is shallower than expected based on pure hydrogen atmosphere models.

 - **Abstract**
 Synthetic source injection (SSI), the insertion of sources into pixel-level on-sky images, is a powerful method for characterizing object detection and measurement in wide-field, astronomical imaging surveys. Within the Dark Energy Survey (DES), SSI plays a critical role in characterizing all necessary algorithms used in converting images to catalogs, and in deriving quantities needed for the cosmology analysis, such as object detection rates, galaxy redshift estimation, galaxy magnification, star-galaxy classification, and photometric performance. We present here a source injection catalog of $146$ million injections spanning the entire 5000 deg$^2$ DES footprint, generated using the Balrog SSI pipeline. Through this sample, we demonstrate that the DES Year 6 (Y6) image processing pipeline provides accurate estimates of the object properties, for both galaxies and stars, at the percent-level, and we highlight specific regimes where the accuracy is reduced. We then show the consistency between SSI and data catalogs, for all galaxy samples developed within the weak lensing and galaxy clustering analyses of DES Y6. The consistency between the two catalogs also extends to their correlations with survey observing properties (seeing, airmass, depth, extinction, etc.). Finally, we highlight a number of applications of this catalog to the DES Y6 cosmology analysis. This dataset is the largest SSI catalog produced at this fidelity and will serve as a key testing ground for exploring the utility of SSI catalogs in upcoming surveys such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time.

 - **Abstract**
 The intersection of art and science offers novel ways to interpret and represent complex phenomena. This project explores the convergence of high-energy astrophysics, concrete poetry, and natural language processing (NLP) by proposing a Markov chain-based algorithm that generates poetic texts from gamma-ray emission maps of the universe. Gamma rays, the most energetic form of electromagnetic radiation, arise from violent astrophysical processes such as supernovae, pulsars, and black hole accretion, observable through instruments like the \textit{Fermi Large Area Telescope} (FermiLAT). These high-energy events are mapped and processed into matrices, treated as Markov chains, where each state's transition probability is determined by the intensity of gamma-ray sources in a region of interest.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the molecular environment of the supernova remnant (SNR) Kesteven 67 (G18.8+0.3) using observations in $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, HCO$^+$,and HCN lines and possible associated $\gamma$-ray emission using 16-yr Fermi-LAT observation. We find that the SNR is closely surrounded by a molecular belt in the southeastern boundary, with the both recessed in the band-like molecular gas structure along the Galactic plane. The asymmetric molecular line profiles are widely present in the surrounding gas around local-standard-of-rest velocity +20 km s$^{-1}$. The secondary components centered at $\sim$+16km s$^{-1}$ in the belt and $\sim$+26 km s$^{-1}$ in the northern clump can be ascribed to the motion of a wind-blown molecular shell. This explanation is supported by the position-velocity diagram along a line cutting across the remnant, which shows an arc-like pattern, suggesting an expanding gas structure. With the simulation of chemical effects of shock propagation, the abundance ratios $N$(HCO$^+$)/$N$($^{12}$CO) $\sim2.6\times 10^{-5}$--$3.6\times 10^{-4}$ obtained in the belt can be more naturally interpreted by the wind-driven bubble shock than by the SNR shock. The belt and northern clump are very likely to be parts of an incomplete molecular shell of bubble driven by O-type progenitor star's wind. The analysis of 0.2--500 GeV $\gamma$-ray emission uncovers a possible point source (`Source~A') about 6.5$\sigma$ located in the north of the SNR, which essentially corresponds to northern molecular clump. Our spectral fit of the emission indicates that a hadronic origin is favored by the measured Galactic number ratio between CR electrons and protons $\sim0.01$.

We review the PSF estimation procedure using the PIFF (PSFs In the Full FOV) software package and describe the key improvements made to PIFF and modeling diagnostics since the DES year three (Y3) analysis: (i) use of external Gaia and infrared photometry catalogs to ensure higher purity of the stellar sample used for model fitting, (ii) addition of color-dependent PSF modeling, the first for any weak lensing analysis, and (iii) inclusion of model diagnostics inspecting fourth-order moments, which can bias weak lensing measurements to a similar degree as second-order modeling errors. Through a comprehensive set of diagnostic tests, we demonstrate the improved accuracy of the Y6 models evident in significantly smaller systematic errors than those of the Y3 analysis, in which all $g$ band data were excluded due to insufficiently accurate PSF models. For the Y6 weak lensing analysis, we include $g$ band photometry data in addition to the $riz$ bands, providing a fourth band for photometric redshift estimation. Looking forward to the next generation of wide-field surveys, we describe several ongoing improvements to PIFF, which will be the default PSF modeling software for weak lensing analyses for the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time.

 - **Abstract**
 We performed a detailed spectroscopic analysis of three extremely metal-poor RR Lyrae stars, exploring uncharted territories at these low metallicities for this class of stars. Using high-resolution spectra acquired with HARPS-N at TNG, UVES at VLT, and PEPSI at LBT, and employing Non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (NLTE) spectral synthesis calculations, we provide abundance measurements for Fe, Al, Mg, Ca, Ti, Mn, and Sr. Our findings indicate that the stars have metallicities of [Fe/H] = -3.40 \pm 0.05, -3.28 \pm 0.02, and -2.77 \pm 0.05 for HD 331986, DO Hya, and BPS CS 30317-056, respectively. Additionally, we derived their kinematic and dynamical properties to gain insights into their origins. Interestingly, the kinematics of one star (HD 331986) is consistent with the Galactic disc, while the others exhibit Galactic halo kinematics, albeit with distinct chemical signatures. We compared the [Al/Fe] and [Mg/Mn] ratios of the current targets with recent literature estimates to determine whether these stars were either accreted or formed in situ, finding that the adopted chemical diagnostics are ineffective at low metallicities ([Fe/H] $\lesssim -$1.5). Finally, the established horizontal branch evolutionary models, indicating that these stars arrive at hotter temperatures on the Zero-Age Horizontal Branch (ZAHB) and then transition into RR Lyrae stars as they evolve, fully support the existence of such low-metallicity RR Lyrae stars. As a consequence, we can anticipate detecting more of them when larger samples of spectra become available from upcoming extensive observational campaigns.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the statistical properties of Ly$\alpha$ emission in 586 galaxies at $z=4.5-14.2$, observed by multiple JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy projects, including JADES, GLASS, CEERS, and GO/DDT programs. We obtain Ly$\alpha$ equivalent width (EW), Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction, and ionizing photon production efficiency measurements or upper limits for these galaxies, and confirm that the Ly$\alpha$ emitting galaxy fraction decreases towards higher redshifts. We derive Ly$\alpha$ luminosity functions from $z\sim 5$ to $z\sim 10-14$ with the observed Ly$\alpha$ EW distributions and galaxy UV luminosity functions, and find a $\sim3$ dex decrease in number density at $L_\mathrm{Ly\alpha}=10^{42}-10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$ over the redshift range. We obtain the neutral hydrogen fractions of $x_\mathrm{HI}=0.17_{-0.16}^{+0.23}$, $0.63_{-0.28}^{+0.18}$, $0.79_{-0.21}^{+0.13}$, and $0.88_{-0.13}^{+0.11}$ at $z\sim6$, $7$, $8-9$, and $10-14$, respectively, via comparisons of the reionization models developed by semi-numerical simulations with 21cmFAST explaining the observations of Ly$\alpha$, UV continuum, and Planck electron optical depth. The high $x_\mathrm{HI}$ values over $z\sim 7-14$ suggest a late and sharp reionization, with the primary reionization process occurring at $z\sim 6-7$. Such a late and sharp reionization is not easily explained by either a clumpy inter-galactic medium or sources of reionization in a classical faint-galaxy or a bright-galaxy/AGN scenario, unless a very high escape fraction or AGN duty cycle is assumed at $z\sim 6-7$.

 - **Abstract**
 The accretion of material onto a black hole modifies the properties of that hole owing to the capture of both matter and radiation. Adding matter to the hole through an accretion disc generally acts to increase the hole's spin parameter, while the capture of radiation generally provides a retarding torque. The balance between the torques provided by adding matter and radiation leads to a maximum spin parameter that can be obtained by a black hole which grows by accretion, known as the Thorne limit. In the simplest theory of thin disc accretion this Thorne limit has the value $a_{\bullet, {\rm lim}} \simeq 0.998$. The purpose of this paper is to highlight that any modification to theories of accretion flows also modify this limiting value, and to compute precisely the modification arising from a particular extension of accretion theory: the inclusion of bright emission from within the plunging region which is sourced from the magnetohydrodynamic stresses ubiquitously observed in simulations. This extra emission further suppresses black hole spin-up and results in new, lower, limits on the final black hole spin. These limits depend on the details of the magnetic stresses acting within the plunging region, but typical values seen in simulations and observations would lower the limit to $a_{\bullet, {\rm lim}} \simeq 0.99$, a subtle but not negligible deviation.

 - **Abstract**
 Infrared spectroscopy, e.g., with JWST, provides a glimpse into the chemical inventory of the innermost region of protoplanetary discs, where terrestrial planets eventually form. The chemical make-up of regions inside snowlines is connected to the material drifting from the outer regions, which can be modeled with dust evolution models. However, infrared observations are limited by the high dust extinction in the inner disc, and only probes the abundances of gaseous species in the disc surface layers. As a result, the bulk mass of delivered volatiles is not directly relatable to what is measured through infrared spectra. In this paper, we investigate how the delivery of dust and ice after prolonged pebble drift affects the observable reservoir of water vapor in the inner disc. We develop a 1+1D approach based on dust evolution models to determine the delivery and distribution of vapor compared to the height of the $\tau = 1$ surface in the dust continuum. We find that the observable column density of water vapor at wavelengths probed by JWST spans many orders of magnitude over time, exhibiting different radial profiles depending on dust properties, drift rate, and local processing. In the presence of a traffic-jam effect inside the snowline, the observable vapor reservoir appears constant in time despite the ongoing delivery by pebble drift, such that water is effectively smuggled unnoticed. Differences in measured column densities then originate not only from variations in bulk vapor content, but also from differences in the properties and distribution of dust particles.

 - **Abstract**
 A common feature of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) is their random variations in brightness across the whole emission spectrum, from radio to $\gamma$-rays. Studying the nature and origin of these fluctuations is critical to characterising the underlying variability process of the accretion flow that powers AGN. Random timing fluctuations are often studied with the power spectrum; this quantifies how the amplitude of variations is distributed over temporal frequencies. Red noise variability -- when the power spectrum increases smoothly towards low frequencies -- is ubiquitous in AGN. The commonly used Fourier analysis methods, have significant challenges when applied to arbitrarily sampled light curves of red noise variability. Several time-domain methods exist to infer the power spectral shape in the case of irregular sampling but they suffer from biases which can be difficult to mitigate, or are computationally expensive. In this paper, we demonstrate a method infer the shape of broad-band power spectra for irregular time series, using a Gaussian process regression method scalable to large datasets. The power spectrum is modelled as a power-law model with one or two bends with flexible slopes. The method is fully Bayesian and we demonstrate its utility using simulated light curves. Finally, Ark 564, a well-known variable Seyfert 1 galaxy, is used as a test case and we find consistent results with the literature using independent X-ray data from XMM-Newton and Swift. We provide publicly available, documented and tested implementations in Python and Julia.
#### Modeling the Saddle-like GeV-TeV Spectrum of HESS 1809-193: Gamma-Rays Arising from Reverse-Shocked Pulsar Wind Nebula?

 - **Abstract**
 Evolution of pulsar wind nebulae (PWN) could be expected to leave imprints in gamma-rays. We suggest that intriguing GeV-TeV spectral energy distribution (SED) of HESS J1809-193 and Fermi-LAT source J1810.3-1925e is very likely to be the gamma-ray signature of PWN J1809-193 in light of the scenario that the PWN was struck by the reverse shock of the parent supernova remnant. Based on evolutionary theory of PWNe, we consider that, when the PWN was disrupted during collision by the reverse shock, some very high-energy electrons escaped impulsively. The remaining electrons stayed in the relic PWN, which was displaced from the pulsar. The very high-energy part of the remaining electrons were depleted by the strong magnetic field was enhanced by the reverse shock compression in the reverberation stage, leaving the other part of them generating GeV emission. The particles injected from the pulsar after the disruption enter the relic PWN through the newly formed tunnel called the cocoon. The {\gamma}-ray emission from the escaped electrons can account for the TeV spectrum of component A of HESS J1809-193 or the TeV halo, while the electrons remaining after disruption can account for the GeV spectrum of J1810.3-1925e. Thus, combination of contributions from these two populations of electrons naturally reproduces the saddle-like SED of HESS 1809-193 and J1810.31925e from 5 GeV to 30 TeV, together with the spectral hardening around 100 GeV. We also show that the post-disruption injection of electrons can explain the spectrum of the relatively faint gamma-ray emission of component B of HESS J1809-193.

 - **Abstract**
 X-ray emission from wind-driven bow shocks is both difficult to measure and predict, but may give important insights into the energy budget of the hot phase of the ISM by quantifying mixing at the interface between hot and warm gas phases. We investigate the effect of magnetic fields and numerical resolution on predicted X-ray emission and other observable properties of bow shocks, to study convergence properties and assess robustness of predicted observables from simulations. A suite of 2D and 3D HD and MHD simulations of bow shocks were run and analysed to generate synthetic emission maps and lightcurves in X-ray and infrared emission. Resolving the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability at the wind-ISM contact discontinuity is crucial for obtaining converged results and for predicting X-ray emission and the properties of the hot shocked wind. When sufficient spatial resolution is used, we measure time variation of X-ray emission of at least an order of magnitude on a timescale comparable to the advection timescale of the wake downstream from the bow shock. Good correspondence is found between 2D and 3D simulations with comparable resolution, and 3D simulations can achieve the required resolution with reasonable computing resources. Development of the KH instability is inhibited for shear flows parallel to the ISM magnetic field, compared with what is seen in the perpendicular direction, resulting in synthetic IR emission maps of bow shocks that are smooth when seen from one perspective but show strong distortions from another. Measuring the X-ray morphology and luminosity in bow shocks may be useful for constraining mixing and energy-transfer rates between hot and warm gas phases of the ISM. Dynamical instabilities at the wind-ISM interface are a crucial ingredient in determining the properties of the hot-gas phase in stellar bow-shocks, in particular to capture its time dependence.

 - **Abstract**
 We combine ultraviolet imaging of the 13H survey field, taken with the XMM-Newton Optical Monitor telescope (XMM-OM) and the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Ultraviolet and Optical Telescope (UVOT) in the UVM2 band, to measure rest-frame ultraviolet 1500A luminosity functions of star-forming galaxies with redshifts between 0.4 and 0.6. In total the UVM2 imaging covers a sky area of 641 square arcmin, and we detect 273 galaxies in the UVM2 image with 0.4<z<0.6. The luminosity function is fit by a Schechter function with best-fit values for the faint end slope alpha = -1.8 +0.4 -0.3 and characteristic absolute magnitude M* = -19.1 +0.3 -0.4. In common with XMM-OM based studies at higher redshifts, our best-fitting value for M* is fainter than previous measurements. We argue that the purging of active galactic nuclei from the sample, facilitated by the co-spatial X-ray survey carried out with XMM-Newton is important for the determination of M*. At the brightest absolute magnitudes (M1500<-18.5) the average UV colour of our galaxies is consistent with that of minimal-extinction local analogues, but the average UV colour is redder for galaxies at fainter absolute magnitudes, suggesting that higher levels of dust attenuation enter the sample at absolute magnitudes somewhat fainter than M*.

 - **Abstract**
 Atmospheric escape is now considered the major contributing factor in shaping the demographic of detected exoplanets. However, inferences about the exoplanet populations strongly depend on the accuracy of the models. Direct observational tests of atmospheric models are still in their infancy. Helium escape from planetary atmospheres has rapidly become the primary observational probe, already observed in $\gtrsim$20 exoplanets. Grounding our understanding in the basic physics of atmospheric escape, we present a new theoretical model to predict the excess absorption from the helium absorption line. We constrain the atmosphere properties, such as mass-loss rates and outflow temperatures, by implementing a Parker wind solution with an energy limited evaporating outflow. Importantly, we self-consistently link the mass-loss rates and outflow temperatures, which are critical to understanding helium absorption as the triplet-level population is typically exponentially sensitive to temperature. Furthermore, helium absorption is typically optically thin and the absorption is dominated far from the planet. Therefore, the absorption depth is not a measure of the size of the helium outflow. Our results indicate that for planets with a detectable signal, typically the helium triplet population in the atmosphere rapidly approaches a statistical equilibrium between populations by recombination and depopulation caused by electron collisions. We suggest that excess helium absorption can be quantified by a scaled equivalent width, which is positively correlated with the mass loss rate. We also show that the helium absorption scales with incident radiation, particularly with the XEUV to FUV flux ratios.

 - **Abstract**
 The chemistry within a protoplanetary disk is greatly affected by external radiation from the local stellar environment. Previous work has focused on extreme radiation fields, representative of the center of something like the Orion Nebula Cluster. However, even in such environments, many disks exist at the edges of a cluster where the lower stellar density leads to radiation fields weaker by orders of magnitude compared to the center. We present new chemical models of a T-Tauri disk in the presence of a moderately increased interstellar radiation field (ISRF). Such an environment has a background UV strength of 10 to 100 times higher than the galactic average ISRF. Moderate radiation fields are among the most prevalent disk-harboring environments and have interesting implications for the chemistry of the outer disk radii. We find that the external UV radiation creates an outer ionization front that impacts the cold disk chemistry to varying degrees, depending on outer disk structure. Certain molecules like C$^+$, N$_2$H$^+$, C, and CS are more strongly impacted by the ISRF in their abundance, column density, and observable emission. Other abundant species like HCO$^+$ and CO are less affected by the external UV flux in the outer disk under such moderate UV conditions. Further, we demonstrate that the chemistry occurring in the inner tens of au is relatively unchanged, which suggests that even in moderately externally irradiated disks, the inner disk chemistry may be more similar to isolated disks like those in, e.g., the Taurus and Lupus star-forming regions.

 - **Abstract**
 Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are a recently identified class of X-ray transient associated with tidal disruption events by supermassive black holes, and for which there are multiple possible explanations. In this paper we present a simple model which requires the black hole be spinning, be misaligned with the accretion flow (both conditions of which are almost certainly met) and that the accretion rate is a few times the Eddington limit. We speculate that the resulting Lense-Thirring torques force the disc and entrained outflows to precess, leading to increased X-ray flux when the wind-cone is oriented at lower inclinations to the observer. We test the range of parameters for which this model could explain the period and brightness of the QPE events discovered thus far, and make qualitative comparisons between the observed X-ray spectra and lightcurves to those extracted from GR-RMHD simulations. Overall, we find some areas of promising concordance, and identify challenges related to the details of current simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 We measure the radio continuum fluxes at the locations of all Gaia${-}$confirmed members of Taurus${-}$Auriga using Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array Sky Survey data (VLASS; 2${-}$4 GHz, $\sigma_{\rm{VLASS}}{\sim}110{-}140 \mu$Jy, $2.5''$ resolution) spanning 3 VLASS epochs (2019, 2021, and 2023). We present 35 detections coincident with young Taurus${-}$Auriga stars (29 in individual VLASS images, 6 via stacking). We find a strong dependence on spectral type, wherein the fractional detection rate of radio emission coincident with early-type young stellar objects (YSOs) is systematically higher than late-type YSOs, ranging from 25% $\pm$ 13% for B${-}$F YSOs, 21% $\pm$ 11% for G YSOs, 18.4% $\pm$ 6.3% for K0${-}$K4 YSOs, 15.5% $\pm$ 5.4% for K5${-}$K9 YSOs, 7.0% $\pm$ 2.7% for M0${-}$M2 YSOs, 2.3% $\pm$ 0.9% for M3${-}$M6 YSOs, and 1.9% $\pm$ 1.9% for YSOs with SpTs later than M7. We present cumulative density distributions of radio luminosity densities that demonstrate a significant luminosity enhancement for early- versus late-type YSOs. We find 25% of the detected sources to be significantly variable. We discuss possible interpretations of this dependence, which may reflect stellar magnetic activity, binary interactions, or stellar flaring. We find that mid-infrared YSO class is a strong indicator of radio detectability consistent with higher frequency Taurus-Auriga VLA surveys, with class III stars detected at a rate of 8.8% $\pm$ 1.6%, class IIs at 2.0% $\pm$ 1.2%, and combined class 0s, Is and Fs at 8.0% $\pm$ 5.4%.
