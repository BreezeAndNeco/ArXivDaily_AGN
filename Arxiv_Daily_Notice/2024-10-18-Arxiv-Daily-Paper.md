 - **Abstract**
 A transiting planet invites us to measure its size, mass, orbital parameters, atmospheric composition, and other characteristics. But the invitation can only be accepted if the host star is bright enough for precise measurements of its flux and spectrum. NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) is dedicated to finding such favorable systems. Operating from a 13.7-day elliptical orbit around the Earth, TESS uses four 10.5 cm telescopes to capture optical images of a 24 x 96 degree field of view. By shifting the field of view every 27 days, TESS can survey most of the sky every few years. In its first six years, TESS has identified approximately 7,000 planet candidates, with several hundred confirmed as planets. Mass measurements of these planets allow astronomers to differentiate between rocky "super-Earths" and gas-rich or volatile-rich "mini-Neptunes," while observations with the James Webb Space Telescope are revealing the secrets of their atmospheres. TESS has discovered planets orbiting a wide range of stars, including young stars, low-mass stars, binary stars, and even a white dwarf star. Beyond planet detection, TESS probes the optical variability of stars and a diverse array of other astronomical objects, including asteroids, comets, supernovae, and active galactic nuclei.
#### Prevention is better than cure? Feedback from high specific energy winds in cosmological simulations with Arkenstone

 - **Abstract**
 We deploy the new Arkenstone galactic wind model in cosmological simulations for the first time, allowing us to robustly resolve the evolution and impact of high specific energy winds. In a (25$\,h^{-1}\,$Mpc)$^3$ box we perform a set of numerical experiments that systematically vary the mass and energy loadings of such winds, finding that their energy content is the key parameter controlling the stellar to dark matter mass ratio. Increasing the mass loading, at fixed energy, actually results in mildly enhanced star formation, counter to prevailing wisdom but in agreement with recent analytic models. Of the simple parametrisations that we test, we find that an energy loading that scales inversely with halo mass best matches a wide range of observations, and can do so with mass loadings drastically lower than those in most previous cosmological simulations. In this scenario, much less material is ejected from the interstellar medium. Instead, winds both heat gas in the circumgalactic medium, slowing infall onto the galaxy, and also drive shocks beyond the virial radius, preventing accretion onto the halo in the first place. We have not yet tied the mass and energy loadings to high-resolution simulations (a key goal of the Learning the Universe collaboration); however, we can already report that a much lower fraction of the available supernova energy is needed in preventative galaxy regulation than required by ejective wind feedback models such as IllustrisTNG.
#### Resonant Capture of Stars by Black Hole Binaries: Extreme Eccentricity Excitation

 - **Abstract**
 Massive black hole (MBH) binaries in galactic nuclei are one of the leading sources of $\sim$ mHz gravitational waves (GWs) for future missions such as $\rm{\textit{LISA}}$. However, the poor sky localization of GW interferometers will make it challenging to identify the host galaxy of MBH mergers absent an electromagnetic counterpart. One such counterpart is the tidal disruption of a star that has been captured into mean motion resonance with the inspiraling binary. Here we investigate the production of tidal disruption events (TDEs) through capture into, and subsequent evolution in, orbital resonance. We examine the full nonlinear evolution of planar autoresonance for stars that lock in to autoresonance with a shrinking MBH binary. Capture into the 2:1 resonance is guaranteed for any realistic astrophysical parameters (given a relatively small MBH binary mass ratio), and the captured star eventually attains an eccentricity $e\approx 1$, leading to a TDE. Stellar disks can be produced around MBHs following an active galactic nucleus episode, and we estimate the TDE rates from resonant capture produced when a secondary MBH begins inspiralling through such a disk. In some cases, the last resonant TDE can occur within a decade of the eventual $\rm{\textit{LISA}}$ signal, helping to localize the GW event.
#### Effects of Cloud Geometry and Metallicity on Shattering and Coagulation of Cold Gas, and Implications for Cold Streams Penetrating Virial Shocks

 - **Abstract**
 Theory and observations reveal that the circumgalactic medium (CGM) and the cosmic web at high redshifts are multiphase, with small clouds of cold gas embedded in a hot, diffuse medium. A proposed mechanism is `shattering' of large, thermally unstable, pressure-confined clouds into tiny cloudlets of size $\ell_{\rm shatter}\sim {\rm min}(c_{\rm s}t_{\rm cool})$. These cloudlets can then disperse throughout the medium like a `fog', or recoagulate to form larger clouds. We study these processes using idealized numerical simulations of thermally unstable gas clouds. We expand upon previous works by exploring the effects of cloud geometry (spheres, streams, and sheets), metallicity, and the inclusion of an ionizing UV background. We find that `shattering' is triggered by clouds losing sonic contact and rapidly imploding, leading to a reflected shock which causes the cloud to re-expand and induces Richtmyer-Meshkov instabilities at its interface. In all cases, the expansion velocity of the cold gas is of order the cold gas sound speed, $c_{\rm s,c}$, slightly smaller in sheets than in streams and spheres due to geometrical effects. After fragmentation the cloudlets experience a drag force from the surrounding hot gas, dominated by condensation rather than ram pressure due to their low relative velocity, leading to recoagulation into larger clouds. We apply our results to the case of cold streams feeding massive ($M_{\rm v}\gtrsim 10^{12}M_\odot$) high-$z$ ($z\gtrsim 2$) galaxies from the cosmic web, finding that streams are likely to shatter upon entering the CGM through the virial shock. This offers a possible explanation for the large clumping factors and covering fractions of cold gas in the CGM around such galaxies, and may be related to galaxy quenching by providing a mechanism to prevent cold streams from reaching the central galaxy.
#### Thermal solutions of strongly magnetized disks and the hysteresis in X-ray binaries

 - **Abstract**
 X-ray binaries (XRBs) exhibit spectral hysteresis for luminosities in the range $10^{-2}\lesssim L/L_\mathrm{Edd}\lesssim 0.3$, with a hard X-ray spectral state that persists from quiescent luminosities up to $\gtrsim 0.3L_\mathrm{Edd}$, transitioning to a soft spectral state that survives with decreasing luminosities down to $\sim 10^{-2}L_\mathrm{Edd}$. We present a possible approach to explain this behavior based on the thermal properties of a magnetically arrested disk simulation. By post-processing the simulation to include radiative effects, we solve for all the thermal equilibrium solutions as the accretion rate, $\dot{M}$, varies along the XRB outburst. For an assumed scaling of the disk scale height and accretion speed with temperature, we find that there exists two solutions in the range of $ 10^{-3}\lesssim\dot{M}/\dot{M}_{\rm Eddington} \lesssim 0.1$ at $r=8\:r_g$ ($ 4\times10^{-2}\lesssim\dot{M}/\dot{M}_{\rm Eddington} \lesssim 0.5$ at $r=3\:r_g$) : a cold, optically thick one and a hot, optically thin one. This opens the possibility of a natural thermal hysteresis in the right range of luminosities for XRBs. We stress that our scenario for the hysteresis does not require to invoke the strong-ADAF principle nor does it require for the magnetization of the disk to change along the XRB outburst. In fact, our scenario requires a highly magnetized disk in the cold, soft state to reproduce the soft-to-hard state transition at the right luminosities. Hence, a prediction of our scenario is that there should be a jet, although possibly very weakly dissipative, in the soft state of XRBs. We also predict that if active galactic nuclei (AGN) have similar hysteresis cycles and are strongly magnetized, they should undergo a soft-to-hard state transition at much lower $L/L_\mathrm{Edd}$ than XRBs.

 - **Abstract**
 The model explaining the spectral "zebra" pattern of the high-frequency interpulse (HFIP) of the Crab pulsar radio emission is proposed. The observed emission bands are diffraction fringes in the spectral domain. The pulsar's own plasma-filled magnetosphere plays a role of a frequency-dependent "diffraction screen". The observed features such as the proportional band spacing, high polarization, constant position angle, and others are explained. The model allows one to perform "tomography" of the pulsar magnetosphere. Indeed, we have obtained the plasma density profile directly from observations, without assuming a particular magnetosphere. Our model is testable and several predictions are made. The two "high-frequency components" observed at the same frequencies as the HFIP are proposed to be related to HFIP.

 - **Abstract**
 We numerically investigate a crucial parameter for understanding particle acceleration theory via turbulence-induced magnetic reconnection: the particle acceleration time. We examine particles accelerated either during the jet's dynamic evolution or in a post-processing, nearly stationary regime. We derive the particle acceleration time and compare it with theoretical predictions for both the Fermi and drift regimes identified in the simulations. In the Fermi regime, the acceleration time is expected to be independent of the particles' energy, for constant reconnection velocity, as energy increases exponentially with time. Conversely, we expect the reconnection acceleration time to depend on the current sheet's thickness and the reconnection velocity, a dependence recently revisited by xu and lazarian 2023. They identified three conditions for \(t_{acc}\). We tested these relations using statistical distributions of the current sheets' thickness and reconnection velocities in the turbulent jet over time. The resulting average value of \(t_{acc}\) was found to be nearly constant with particle energy. We compared this acceleration time with the average acceleration time derived directly from 50,000 particles accelerated in situ in the same relativistic jet. When considering a longer time interval for particle acceleration in a nearly stationary snapshot of the turbulent jet, we find that the acceleration time during the Fermi regime remains nearly independent of particle energy and aligns with the acceleration time theoretical relations up to the threshold energy, attained when the particles Larmor radius becomes as large as the thickness of the largest current sheets. Beyond this threshold, the acceleration regime shifts to the slower drift regime, showing strong energy dependence, as predicted. The results also indicate a clear dominance of the Fermi regime of acceleration.
#### PGC 44685: A Dwarf Star-forming Lenticular Galaxy with Wolf-Rayet Population

 - **Abstract**
 Lenticular galaxies (S0s) are formed mainly from the gas stripping of spirals in the cluster. But how S0s form and evolve in the field is still untangled. Based on spatially resolved observations from the optical Hispanic Astronomical Center in Andalusia 3.5-m telescope with the PPAK Integral Field Spectroscopy instrument and NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array, we study a dwarf (M*<10^9 Msun) S0, PGC 44685, with triple star-forming regions in the central region, namely A, B, and C, respectively. In northwest region C, we clearly detect the spectral features of Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars and quantify the WR population by stacking spectra with high WR significance. Most of the molecular gas is concentrated in the region C(WR), and there is diffuse gas around regions A and B. The WR region possesses the strongest intensities of Ha, CO(1-0), and 3mm continuum, indicating its ongoing violent star formation (gas depletion timescale $\lesssim$25 Myr) with tentative hundreds (<500) km/s stellar winds accompanied by the WR phase. Most (~96%) of three star-forming regions show relatively low metallicity distributions, suggesting possible (minor) accretions of metal-poor gas that trigger the subsequent complex star formation in a field S0 galaxy. We speculate that PGC 44685 will become quiescent in less than 30 Myr if there is no new molecular gas to provide raw materials for star formation. The existence of this dwarf star-forming S0 presents an example of star formation in the low-mass/metallicity S0 galaxy.
#### The influence of the cloud virial parameter on the initial mass function

 - **Abstract**
 Crucial for star formation is the interplay between gravity and turbulence. The observed cloud virial parameter, $\alpha_{\mathrm{vir}}$, which is the ratio of twice the turbulent kinetic energy to the gravitational energy, is found to vary significantly in different environments, where the scatter among individual star-forming clouds can exceed an order of magnitude. Therefore, a strong dependence of the initial mass function (IMF) on $\alpha_{\mathrm{vir}}$ may challenge the notion of a universal IMF. To determine the role of $\alpha_{\mathrm{vir}}$ on the IMF, we compare the star-particle mass functions obtained in high-resolution magnetohydrodynamical simulations including jet and heating feedback, with $\alpha_{\mathrm{vir}}=0.0625$, $0.125$, and $0.5$. We find that varying $\alpha_{\mathrm{vir}}$ from $\alpha_{\mathrm{vir}}\sim0.5$ to $\alpha_{\mathrm{vir}}<0.1$ shifts the peak of the IMF to lower masses by a factor of $\sim2$ and increases the star formation rate by a similar factor. The dependence of the IMF and star formation rate on $\alpha_{\mathrm{vir}}$ is non-linear, with the dependence subsiding at $\alpha_{\mathrm{vir}}<0.1$. Our study shows a systematic dependence of the IMF on $\alpha_{\mathrm{vir}}$. Yet, it may not be measurable easily in observations, considering the uncertainties, and the relatively weak dependence found in this study.

 - **Abstract**
 Coupling black hole (BH) feeding and feedback involves interactions across vast spatial and temporal scales that is computationally challenging. Tracking gas inflows and outflows from kilo-parsec scales to the event horizon for non-spinning BHs in the presence of strong magnetic fields, Cho et al. (2023, 2024) report strong suppression of accretion on horizon scales and low (2%) feedback efficiency. In this letter, we explore the impact of these findings for the supermassive BHs M87* and Sgr A*, using high-resolution, non-cosmological, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations with the Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE-2) model. With no feedback, we find rapid BH growth due to "cooling flows," and for 2% efficiency feedback, while accretion is suppressed, the rates still remain higher than constraints from Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) data (Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration et al. 2021, 2022) for M87* and Sgr A*. To match EHT observations of M87*, a feedback efficiency greater than 15% is required, suggesting the need to include enhanced feedback from BH spin. Similarly, a feedback efficiency of $>15\%$ is needed for Sgr A* to match the estimated observed star formation rate of $\lesssim 2 {\rm M_\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. However, even with 100% feedback efficiency, the accretion rate onto Sgr A* matches with EHT data only on rare occasions in the simulations, suggesting that Sgr A* is likely in a temporary quiescent phase currently. Bridging accretion and feedback across scales, we conclude that higher feedback efficiency, possibly due to non-zero BH spin, is necessary to suppress "cooling flows" and match observed accretion and star formation rates in M87* and Sgr A*.

 - **Abstract**
 Origin of energetic upstream ions propagating towards the Sun from the Earth's bow shock is not understood clearly. In this letter, relationship between solar wind suprathermal and upstream ions has been investigated by analyzing fluxes of H, 4He, and CNO obtained from multidirectional in-situ measurements at the first Lagrange point of the Sun-Earth system during 2012-2014. 49 upstream events have been selected based on flux enhancements of the upstream ions in comparison with the solar wind suprathermal ions. An energy cut-off at less than 300 keV is observed for the upstream events. This is attributed to the efficacy of the particle acceleration process near the bow shock. Interestingly, spectra of upstream ions soften systematically as compared to the spectra of their solar wind counterpart with decreasing mass of elements. The degree of spectral softening increases with decreasing mass-to-charge ratio of the species. Since during most of the events the interplanetary magnetic field was radial, we argue that cross-field diffusion of upstream ions gives rise to the modulation (spectral softening) of upstream ions, which is dependent on the mass-to-charge ratio of species. Our work indicates towards a systematic change in solar wind suprathermal ions after interaction with the bow shock.
#### Lyman Continuum leakage from massive leaky starbursts: A different class of emitters?

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of Lyman Continuum (LyC) photons responsible for reionizing the universe remains a mystery, with the fraction of escaping LyC photons from galaxies at z$\sim$ 6 to 12 being highly uncertain. While direct detection of LyC photons from this epoch is hindered by absorption from the intergalactic medium, lower redshift analogs offer a promising avenue to study LyC leakage. We present Hubble Space Telescope Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (HST COS) observations of five low redshift (z$\sim$ 0.3) massive starburst galaxies, selected for their high stellar mass and weak [SII] nebular emission - an indirect tracer of LyC escape. Three of the five galaxies show LyC leakage, highlighting the reliability of weak [SII] as a tracer, especially in light of recent JWST discoveries of z $>$ 5 galaxies with similarly weak [SII] emission. The dust corrected LyC escape fractions, which represent the LyC photons that would escape in the absence of dust, range from 33% to 84%. However, the absolute escape fractions, which show the LyC photons escaping after passing through both neutral hydrogen absorption and dust attenuation, are significantly lower, ranging between 1% and 3%. This suggests that while the galaxies are nearly optically thin to HI, their high dust content significantly suppresses LyC photon escape. These [SII] weak, massive leakers are distinct from typical low-redshift LyC emitters, showing higher metallicity, lower ionization states, more dust extinction and higher star formation surface densities. This suggests that these galaxies constitute a distinct population, likely governed by a different mechanism facilitating LyC photon escape. We propose that the feedback-driven winds in these compact starbursts create ionized channels through which LyC photons escape, aligning with a picket-fence model.
#### The Milky Way Radial Metallicity Gradient as an Equilibrium Phenomenon: Why Old Stars are Metal-Rich

 - **Abstract**
 Metallicities of both gas and stars decline toward large radii in spiral galaxies, a trend known as the radial metallicity gradient. We quantify the evolution of the metallicity gradient in the Milky Way as traced by APOGEE red giants with age estimates from machine learning algorithms. Stars up to ages of $\sim$9 Gyr follow a similar relation between metallicity and Galactocentric radius. This constancy challenges current models of Galactic chemical evolution, which typically predict lower metallicities for older stellar populations. Our results favor an equilibrium scenario, in which the gas-phase gradient reaches a nearly constant normalization early in the disk lifetime. Using a fiducial choice of parameters, we demonstrate that one possible origin of this behavior is an outflow that more readily ejects gas from the interstellar medium with increasing Galactocentric radius. A direct effect of the outflow is that baryons do not remain in the interstellar medium for long, which causes the ratio of star formation to accretion, $\dot{\Sigma}_\star / \dot{\Sigma}_\text{in}$, to quickly become constant. This ratio is closely related to the local equilibrium metallicity, since its numerator and denominator set the rates of metal production by stars and hydrogen gained through accretion, respectively. Building in a merger event results in a perturbation that evolves back toward the equilibrium state on $\sim$Gyr timescales. Under the equilibrium scenario, the radial metallicity gradient is not a consequence of the inside-out growth of the disk but instead reflects a trend of declining $\dot{\Sigma}_\star / \dot{\Sigma}_\text{in}$ with increasing Galactocentric radius.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic fields (B-fields) are ubiquitous in the interstellar medium (ISM), and they play an essential role in the formation of molecular clouds and subsequent star formation. However, B-fields in interstellar environments remain challenging to measure, and their properties typically need to be inferred from dust polarization observations over multiple physical scales. In this work, we seek to use a recently proposed approach called the Velocity Gradient Technique (VGT) to study B-fields in star-forming regions and compare the results with dust polarization observations in different wavelengths. The VGT is based on the anisotropic properties of eddies in magnetized turbulence to derive B-field properties in the ISM. We investigate that this technique is synergistic with dust polarimetry when applied to a turbulent diffused medium for the purpose of measuring its magnetization. Specifically, we use the VGT on molecular line data toward the NGC~1333 star-forming region ($\rm ^{12}CO$, $\rm ^{13}CO$, $\rm C^{18}O$, and $\rm N_{2}H^{+}$), and we compare the derived B-field properties with those inferred from 214 and 850~$\mu$m dust polarization observations of the region using SOFIA/HAWC+ and JCMT/POL-2, respectively. We estimate both the inclination angle and the 3D Alfvénic Mach Number $M_A$ from the molecular line gradients. Crucially, testing this technique on gravitationally bound, dynamic, and turbulent regions, and comparing the results with those obtained from polarization observations at different wavelength, such as the plane-of-the-sky field orientation, is an important test on the applicability of the VGT in various density regimes of the ISM.

 - **Abstract**
 Can a naked singularity (NkS) be distinguished from a black hole (BH)? We have investigated it with cutting-edge general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations, followed by general relativistic radiation transfer (GRRT) calculation for magnetized accretion flow around NkS and BH. Based on our simulations, the accreting matter close enough to the singularity repels due to effective potential. This prevents matter from reaching a NkS and forms a quasi-spherical symmetric density distribution around it, unlike the accretion flows around a BH. We observe an order of magnitude higher mass flux through the jet and much stronger wind from a NkS than a BH. We found that the jet launching mechanism in a NkS differs significantly from that in a BH. In the horizon-scale images, a NKs shows a photon arc instead of a photon ring that is shown around a BH. In summary, the flow dynamics and radiative properties around an NkS are distinctly different from a BH. These properties would be useful to either confirm or rule out such exotic compact objects through future observations.

 - **Abstract**
 To investigate how the radio-identified active galactic nuclei (AGN) fraction varies with cluster-centric radius, we present the projected and de-projected distributions of a large sample of LOFAR-identified radio AGN out to $30R_{500}$ around galaxy clusters. The AGN fraction experiences a $\sim 25\%$ increase above the field fraction in the cluster outskirts at around $10R_{500}$, a $\sim 20\%$ decrease around $\sim 0.5R_{500}$, and an increase of over three times the field fraction value in the very cluster core. We label these three radial windows the outer, intermediate and inner regions respectively, and investigate how these radial trends might arise due to intrinsic properties of the AGN population. The only difference seen in host galaxy stellar mass is in the inner region, where there is a much higher fraction of massive host galaxies. Analysing AGN radio luminosity, regions with a higher AGN fraction tend to have more radio luminous AGN, and vice versa. We discuss the physical mechanisms that might be responsible for these results with reference to the literature.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of a bright pulse having a dispersion measure (DM) equal to 134.4 \pm 2 pc cm^{-3}, a peak flux density (S_p) equal to 20 \pm 4 Jy and a half-width (W_e) equal to 211 \pm 6 ms. The excessive DM of the pulse, after taking into account the Milky Way contribution, is 114 pc cm^{-3} that indicates its extragalactic origin. Such value of DM corresponds to the luminosity distance 713 Mpc. The above parameters make the pulse to be a reliable candidate to the fast radio burst (FRB) event, and then it is the second FRB detected at such a large \lambda \sim 2.7 m wavelength and the first one among non-repeating FRBs. The normalized luminosity L_\nu of the event, which we have designated as FRB 20190203, estimated under assumption that the whole excessive DM is determined by the intergalactic environment toward the host galaxy, is equal to \simeq 10^{34} erg s^{-1} Hz{-1}. In addition to the study of radio data we analyzed data from the quasi-simultaneous observations of the sky in the high energy (\ge 80 keV) band by the omnidirectional detector SPI/ACS aboard the INTEGRAL orbital observatory (in order to look for a possible gamma-ray counterpart of FRB 20190203). We did not detect any transient events exceeding the background at a statistically significant level. In the INTEGRAL archive, the FRB 20190203 localization region has been observed many times with a total exposure of \sim 73.2 days. We have analyzed the data but were unable to find any reliable short gamma-ray bursts from the FRB 20190203 position. Finally we note that the observed properties of FRB 20190203 can be reproduced well in the framework of a maser synchrotron model operating in the far reverse shock (at a distance of \sim 10^{15} cm) of a magnetar. However, triggering the burst requires a high conversion efficiency (at the level of 1%) of the shock wave energy into the radio emission.

 - **Abstract**
 Non-axisymmetric structures, such as bars and spiral arms, are known to concentrate molecular gas and star formation in galaxy centers, actively building up the pseudo-bulges. However, a direct link between the neutral (i.e., molecular and atomic) gas distribution and the exerted torque forces over a broader radial range of galactic disks still remains to be explored. In the present work, we investigate this link by carefully evaluating the torque force field using the $3.6\, \mathrm{\mu m}$ images for 17 The H I Nearby Galaxy Survey (THINGS) galaxies, and measuring neutral gas distribution on resolved atomic and molecular line maps. We find that galaxies with stronger torque forces show a more concentrated neutral gas distribution over the disk-scale, defined as half the isophotal radius at $25.5\, \mathrm{mag\, arcsec^{-2}}$. The correlation holds regardless of whether the neutral gas fraction, or the effective stellar mass surface density is controlled for. In addition, $\mathrm{kpc}$-scale neutral gas over-densities tend to be located close to the local maxima of torque forces. Most of these correlations involving the torque forces are comparatively stronger than those using the traditional Fourier amplitudes to quantify the non-axisymmetric structures. These results are consistent with the scenario that non-axisymmetric structures exert torque forces, and trigger dissipative processes to transport gas inward, not only to build the pseudo-bulges, but also fuel the inner disk growth. In this regard, non-axisymmetric structures inducing stronger torque forces appear to be more efficient in these processes.

 - **Abstract**
 Modeling of microlensing events poses computational challenges for the resolution of the lens equation and the high dimensionality of the parameter space. In particular, numerical noise represents a severe limitation to fast and efficient calculations of microlensing by multiple systems, which are of particular interest in exoplanetary searches. We present a new public code built on our previous experience on binary lenses that introduces three new algorithms for the computation of magnification and astrometry in multiple microlensing. Besides the classical polynomial resolution, we introduce a multi-polynomial approach in which each root is calculated in a frame centered on the closest lens. In addition, we propose a new algorithm based on a modified Newton-Raphson method applied to the original lens equation without any numerical manipulation. These new algorithms are more accurate and robust compared to traditional single-polynomial approaches at a modest computational cost, opening the way to massive studies of multiple lenses. The new algorithms can be used in a complementary way to optimize efficiency and robustness.

 - **Abstract**
 In recent years, nanosatellites have revolutionized the space sector due to their significant economic and time-saving advantages. As a result, they have fostered the testing of advanced instruments intended for larger space science missions. The case of MELISA is presented in this work. MELISA is a magnetic measurement instrument which aims at demonstrating the in-orbit performance of AMR sensors featuring dedicated noise reduction techniques at sub-millihertz frequencies. Such low frequency ranges are relevant for future space-borne gravitational wave detectors, where the local magnetic environment of the satellite might yield a significant contribution to the overall noise budget of the observatory. The demanding magnetic noise levels required for this bandwidth, down to 0.1 mHz, make measurements arduous. To explore sensing solutions within the H2020 European Commission Programme with the involvement of ESA, the functional performance of MELISA-III will be validated in-orbit. During operations, there is the possibility to measure the low-frequency magnetic contribution stemming from orbiting the Earth's magnetic field, impeding the characterization of the intrinsic performance of the sensor. With the objective of minimizing excess noise during the in-flight operations, the present research aims to simulate the environmental magnetic conditions in LEO to identify and subtract undesired contributions to the measurements. The in-orbit long-term magnetic fluctuations are replicated using a Helmholtz coil system. A fluxgate magnetometer allows the correlation of the generated field with the payload measurements, leading to the subsequent subtraction. Proving the effect of this approach will facilitate the noise characterization of magnetic sensors in LEO, paving the way for the in-orbit validation of MELISA-III for use in magnetically demanding missions with long integration times.

 - **Abstract**
 We report that the gas components in the N59 bubble suffered from sequential multiple cloud-cloud collision (CCC) processes. The molecular gas in the N59 bubble can be decomposed into four velocity components, namely Cloud A [95, 108] km s$^{-1}$, Cloud B [86, 95] km s$^{-1}$, Cloud C [79, 86] km s$^{-1}$ and Cloud D [65, 79] km s$^{-1}$. Four CCC processes occurred among these four velocity components, i.e., Cloud A vs. Cloud B, Cloud A vs. Cloud C, Cloud C vs. Cloud D, and Cloud A vs. Cloud D. Using Spitzer MIR and UKIDSS NIR photometric point source catalogs, we identified 514 YSO candidates clustered in 13 YSO groups, and most of them (~60$\%$) were located at the colliding interfaces, indicating that they were mainly triggered by these four CCC processes. We also found that these four collisions occurred in a time sequential order: the earliest and most violent collision occurred between Cloud A and Cloud D about 2 Myr ago, then Cloud B collided with Cloud A about 1 Myr ago, and finally, Cloud C collided with Clouds A and D simultaneously about 0.4 Myr ago.
