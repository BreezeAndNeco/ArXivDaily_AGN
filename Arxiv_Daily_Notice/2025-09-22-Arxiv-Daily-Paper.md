 - **Abstract**
 We introduce the Radio-array $uv$ Layout Engineering Strategy (RULES), an algorithm for designing radio arrays that achieve complete coverage of the $uv$ plane, defined as, at minimum, regular sampling at half the observing wavelength ($\lambda$) along the $u$ and $v$ axes within a specified range of baseline lengths. Using RULES, we generate $uv$-complete layouts that cover the range $10\lambda\leq|(u,v)|\leq 100\lambda$ with fewer than 1000 antennas of diameter $5\lambda$, comparable to current and planned arrays. We demonstrate the effectiveness of such arrays for mitigating contamination from bright astrophysical foregrounds in 21 cm Epoch of Reionization observations,particularly in the region of Fourier space known as the foreground wedge,by simulating visibilities of foreground-like sky models over the 130-150 MHz band and processing them through an image-based power spectrum estimator. We find that with complete $uv$ coverage, the wedge power is suppressed by sixteen orders of magnitude compared to an array with a compact hexagonal layout (used as a reference for a sparse $uv$ coverage). In contrast, we show that an array with the same number of antennas but in a random configuration only suppresses the wedge by three orders of magnitude, despite sampling more distinct $uv$ points over the same range. We address real-world challenges and find that our results are sensitive to small antenna position errors and missing baselines, while still performing equally or significantly better than random arrays in any case. We propose ways to mitigate those challenges such as a minimum redundancy requirement or tighter $uv$ packing density.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: With no conclusive detection to date, the search for exomoons, satellites of planets orbiting other stars, remains a formidable challenge. Detecting these objects, compiling a population-level sample and constraining their occurrence will inform planet and moon formation models and shed light on moon habitability. Aims: Here, we demonstrate the possibility of a moon search based on astrometric time series data, repeated measurements of the position of a given planet relative to its host star. The perturbing influence of an orbiting moon induces a potentially detectable planetary reflex motion. Methods: Based on an analytical description of the astrometric signal amplitude, we place the expected signatures of putative moons around real exoplanets into context with our current and future astrometric measurement precision. Modelling the orbital perturbation as a function of time, we then simulate the detection process to obtain the first astrometric exomoon sensitivity curves. Results: The astrometric technique already allows for the detection and characterisation of favourable moons around giant exoplanets and brown dwarfs. On the basis of 12 epochs obtained with VLTI/GRAVITY, it is already today possible to infer the presence of a 0.14 $\mathrm{M}_\mathrm{Jup}$ satellite at a separation of 0.39 AU around AF Lep b. Future facilities offering better precision will refine our sensitivity in both moon mass and separation from the host planet by several orders of magnitude. Conclusions: The astrometric method of exomoon detection provides a promising avenue towards making the detection of these elusive worlds a reality and efficiently building a sample of confirmed objects. With a future facility that achieves an astrometric precision of 1 mas, probing for Earth-like moons within the habitable zone of a given star will become a realistic proposition.

 - **Abstract**
 We present new VLT/MUSE mosaic observations of a 3 $\times$ 8 arcmin$^2$ area along the southern major axis of the nearby galaxy M33 at a distance of 840 kpc from the Milky Way. These data provide an unprecedented view of the galaxy interstellar medium (ISM), and allow us to resolve ionised nebulae at a spatial scale of $\approx$5 pc. We identify and catalogue 124 HII regions, down to H$\alpha$ luminosities of $\approx 5\times$10$^{35}$ erg s$^{-1}$, one order of magnitude fainter than previous surveys on local galaxies, and compare these regions with the spatial distribution of ionising stars and embedded star clusters. For each region, we extract the corresponding integrated optical spectra and measured the intensity of key optical emission lines (H$\beta$, [OIII], [NII], H$\alpha$, [SII], [SIII], other weaker optical lines when detectable, and Paschen lines) to characterize their physical properties of the ioinized gas such as density, dust attenuation, and metallicity. Our spatially resolved line ratio and flux maps reveal remarkable diversity in ionisation properties, from dust-obscured regions hosting young stellar objects to highly ionised bubbles exhibiting high [OIII]/H$\beta$ ratios (>5). Our data reveal a diversity of ionisation fronts, ranging from well-defined to partial to absent. Radial profiles indicate the presence of both optically thin (density-bounded) and optically thick (radiation-bounded) HII regions. Our study highlights the richness of this MUSE mosaic and their unparalleled view of the ISM. In particular, the ability to probe the ISM at $\approx$ 5 pc resolution opens a new window onto the complex structure of the ionised gas, enabling direct insight into how stellar feedback operates on the scales where it originates.

 - **Abstract**
 High-resolution transmission spectroscopy has become a powerful tool for detecting atomic and ionic species in the atmospheres of ultra-hot Jupiters. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that the Australian-built Veloce spectrograph on the 3.9-m Anglo-Australian Telescope can resolve atmospheric signatures from transiting exoplanets. We observed a single transit of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-189b - a favourable target given its extreme irradiation and bright host star - and applied the cross-correlation technique using standardised templates. We robustly detect ionised calcium (Ca+), and find evidence for hydrogen (H), sodium (Na), magnesium (Mg), neutral calcium (Ca), titanium (Ti), ionised titanium (Ti+), ionised iron (Fe+), neutral iron (Fe), and ionised strontium (Sr+). The strongest detection was achieved in the red arm of Veloce, consistent with expectations due to the prominent Ca+ triplet at wavelengths around 850-870 nm. Our results validate Veloce's capability for high-resolution atmospheric studies, highlighting it as an accessible, flexible facility to complement larger international telescopes. If future observations stack multiple transits, Veloce has the potential to reveal atmospheric variability, phase-dependent spectral changes, and detailed chemical compositions of highly irradiated exoplanets.
#### Kinematics of Stellar Streams from Globular Clusters Depend on Black Hole Retention and Star Mass: A Selection Effect for Dark Matter Inference

 - **Abstract**
 Velocity dispersion ($\sigma$) in stellar streams from globular clusters (GCs) is sensitive to heating by Galactic substructure, including dark matter (DM) subhalos. Recent studies have compared $\sigma$ in observed and modeled streams to probe DM properties, but have relied on stream models that neglect strong encounters, black holes (BHs), and mass segregation in GCs. Such phenomena may inflate stream $\sigma$ or introduce selection effects -- e.g., a $\sigma$ that depends on star mass ($m$). We investigate this prospect using Monte Carlo $N$-body simulations of GCs under static Galactic tides to generate mock streams with realistic mass and velocity distributions. We find $\sigma$ correlates with $m$, especially after core collapse (the GC's observable increase in central density upon ejecting its BHs), rising from $1.2$--$2.2\,{\rm km\,s}^{-1}$ between $m=0.3$--$0.8\,M_\odot$, with typical kinematic cuts on stream membership. Similar in magnitude to heating by Galactic substructure, this enhancement occurs because the GC's loss of BHs allows its most-massive stars to occupy its dense center, raising their likelihood of strong ejection via binary interactions and adding broad, exponential wings to the stream's velocity distribution. Streams' kinematics thus probe properties (density, BH retention) of their progenitor GCs. Our results also imply observations of streams from some GCs, especially those not subject to highly episodic mass loss, may select for higher $\sigma$ than predicted by models neglecting $\sigma$'s $m$-dependence. This would cause observed $\sigma$ in streams -- already on the low side of expectations for cold DM -- to further favor alternatives such as warm, ultralight, or self-interacting DM.

 - **Abstract**
 Stars form in clusters from the gravitational collapse of giant molecular clouds, which is opposed by a variety of physical processes, including stellar feedback. The interplay between these processes determines the star formation rate of the clouds. To study how feedback controls star formation, we use a numerical framework that is optimized to simulate star cluster formation and evolution. This framework, called Torch, combines the magnetohydrodynamical code FLASH with N-body and stellar evolution codes in the Astrophysical Multipurpose Software Environment (AMUSE). Torch includes stellar feedback from ionizing and non-ionizing radiation, stellar winds, and supernovae, but, until now, did not include protostellar jets. We present our implementation of protostellar jet feedback within the Torch framework and describe its free parameters. We then demonstrate our new module by comparing cluster formation simulations with and without jets. We find that the inclusion of protostellar jets slows star formation, even in clouds of up to M $= 2 \times 10^4$ M$_{\odot}$. We also find that the star formation rate of our lower mass clouds (M $= 5 \times 10^3$ M$_{\odot}$) is strongly affected by both the inclusion of protostellar jets and the chosen jet parameters, including the jet lifetime and injection velocity. We follow the energy budget for each simulation and find that the inclusion of jets systematically increases the kinetic energy of the gas at early times. The implementation of protostellar jet feedback in Torch opens new areas of investigation regarding the role of feedback in star cluster formation and evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 The transport of cosmic rays through turbulent astrophysical plasmas still constitutes an open problem. Building on recent progress, we study the combined effect of magnetic mirroring and resonant curvature scattering on parallel and perpendicular transport. We conduct test particle simulations in snapshots of an anisotropic magnetohydrodynamics simulation, and record magnetic moment variation and field line curvature around pitch angle reversals. We find for strongly magnetized particles that (i) pitch angle reversals may occur either in coherent regions of the field with small variation of the magnetic moment via magnetic mirroring, or in chaotic regions of the field with strong variation of the magnetic moment via resonant curvature scattering; (ii) parallel transport can be modeled as a Lévy walk with a truncated power-law distribution based on pitch angle reversal times; and (iii) perpendicular transport is enhanced by resonant curvature scattering in synergy with chaotic field line separation, and diminished by magnetic mirroring due to confinement in locally ordered field line bundles. While magnetic mirroring constitutes the bulk of reversal events, resonant curvature scattering additionally acts on trajectories which fall in the loss cones of typical mirroring structures and thus provides the cut-off for the reversal time distribution. Our results, which highlight the role of the magnetic field line geometry in cosmic ray transport processes, are consistent with energy-independent diffusion coefficients. We conclude by considering how energy-dependent observations could arise from an intermittently inhomogeneous interstellar medium.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the co-evolution of galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGN) requires accurate modeling of dust-obscured systems. Recent surveys using the Mid Infrared Instrument (MIRI) onboard the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have uncovered a large population of dust obscured AGN, challenging current theoretical frameworks. We present an updated version of the Simulated Infrared Extragalactic Dusty Sky (SIDES) simulation framework. Our updates include modified star-forming and starburst galaxy spectral energy distribution (SED) templates as well as quiescent and AGN templates. We also incorporate a probabilistic assignment of the fraction of the IR emission that is due to an AGN. Our simulations successfully reproduce the observed MIRI source number counts, redshift distributions, and AGN population fractions. We find that AGN dominate at bright flux densities $(S_\nu \gtrsim 20\, \mu \rm Jy$ while main sequence galaxies dominate at the faint end. We also quantify the effects of cosmic variance, showing that surveys with areas below $25\, \rm arcmin^2$ suffer from $\sim 30 \% $ uncertainty in bright AGN counts. Finally, we provide diagnostic color-color diagrams and joint Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) and MIRI flux distributions to aid interpretation of current and upcoming JWST surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 Here we investigate an infrared eruptive source, identified from the decade-long VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea survey (VVV). We named this target after a group of variable sources discovered by VVV, as VVV-WIT-13, with WIT standing for "What Is This?", due to its unique photometric variation behaviour and the mysterious origin of the outburst. This target exhibited an outburst with a 5.7 mag amplitude in the Ks-band, remained on its brightness plateau for 3.5 years, and then rapidly faded to its pre-eruptive brightness afterwards. We aim to reveal the variable nature and outburst origin of VVV-WIT-13 by presenting our follow-up photometric and spectroscopic observations along with theoretical models. We gathered photometric time series in both near- and mid-infrared wavelengths. We obtained near-infrared spectra during the outburst and decaying stages on XSHOOTER/VLT and FIRE/Magellan, and then fitted the detected molecular absorption features using models from ExoMol. We applied 2D numerical simulations to re-create the observables of the eruptive phenomenon. We observe deep AlO absorption bands in the infrared spectra of VVV-WIT-13, during the outburst stage, along with other more common absorption bands (e.g. CO). Our best-fit model suggests a 600 K temperature of the AlO absorption band. In the decaying stage, the AlO bands disappeared, whilst broad blue-shifted H2 lines arose, a common indicator of stellar wind and outflow. The observational evidence suggests that the CO and TiO features originate from an outflow or a wind environment. We find that VVV-WIT-13 is an eruptive young star with instability occurring in the accretion disk. One favoured theoretical explanation of this event is a disrupted gas clump at a distance of 3 au from the source. If confirmed, this would be the first such event observed in real time.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the discovery of three new low-latitude (|b| ~ 20$^{\circ}$) Milky Way satellites: Yasone-1, Yasone-2, and Yasone-3. They were identified in our search for compact stellar overdensities in the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System 1, supported by follow-up deep photometric imaging from the Gran Telescopio Canarias OSIRIS instrument and Gaia astrometric data. These three new Milky Way satellites are found as compact stellar overdensities that exhibit structural and photometric properties consistent with old, metal-poor populations. All three are best described by isochrone fits corresponding to an age of ~12 Gyr and subsolar metallicities: [Fe/H] ~ -1.5 for Yasone-1 and Yasone-2, and [Fe/H] ~ -2.0 for Yasone-3. Yasone-1, located at a heliocentric distance of 12 kpc, has a physical half-light radius of 1.40 pc, an absolute V-band magnitude of +2.36, and a total stellar mass of 18.2 M$_{\odot}$. Yasone-2, at a distance of 20 kpc, has a slightly larger size of 2.44 pc, a brighter V-band magnitude of +1.83, and a higher mass of 28.0 M$_{\odot}$. Yasone-3, located at 15 kpc, is the faintest and least massive of the three, with M$_{V}$ = +2.52, a stellar mass of 14.4 M$_{\odot}$, and a half-light radius of 2.09 pc. We also report a fourth (Yasone-4), lower-confidence hypercompact candidate located at Galactic latitude (b ~ 48$^{\circ}$), identified by replicating our search using the photometric catalogue of the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program Public Release. Finally, we present the discovery of sixteen (Yasone-5 to Yasone-20) new hypercompact cluster candidates in the Galactic disc. We discuss the possibility that any of the Yasone clusters may host an intermediate-mass black hole, and we advocate for follow-up spectroscopic observations to further constrain their nature.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a review of our findings on the origin, drivers, nature, and impact of kiloparsec-scale radio emission in radio-quiet (RQ) AGN. Using radio polarimetric techniques, we probe the dynamics and magnetic (B-) field geometry of outflows in Seyfert and LINER galaxies. Multi-band data from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) reveal how low-power jets interact with their environment. These interactions can slow down and disrupt the radio outflows while locally regulating star formation through AGN feedback. Several radio properties correlate strongly with the black hole mass, similar to trends observed in radio-loud (RL) AGN. Although their characteristics differ, RQ systems might not be intrinsically distinct from RL AGN, apart from lower jet powers. Our polarization measurements further suggest a composite model in which a black hole-accretion disk system drives both a collimated jet with a small-pitch-angle helical B-field and a wide-angle wind threaded by a high-pitch-angle helical field.

 - **Abstract**
 Trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) are among the most ancient bodies of the solar system. Understanding their physical properties is key to constraining their origin and the evolution of the outer regions beyond Neptune. Stellar occultations provide highly accurate size and shape information. (24835) 1995 SM55 is one of the few members of the Haumea cluster and thus of particular interest. We aimed to determine its projected size, absolute magnitude, and geometric albedo, and to compare these with Haumea. A stellar occultation on 25 February 2024 was observed from five sites, with seven positive detections and 33 negative chords. An elliptical fit to the occultation chords yields semi-axes of $(104.3 \pm 0.4) \times (83.5 \pm 0.5)$ km, giving an area-equivalent diameter of $186.7 \pm 1.8$ km, smaller than the 250 km upper limit from Herschel thermal data. Photometry provides an absolute magnitude $H_V = 4.55 \pm 0.03$, a phase slope of $0.04 \pm 0.02$ mag/deg, and a $V-R = 0.37 \pm 0.05$. The rotational variability has an amplitude $\Delta m = 0.05$ mag, but the period remains uncertain. Combining occultation and photometry, we derive a geometric albedo $p_V = 0.80 \pm 0.04$, one of the highest values measured for a TNO. This value is slightly higher than that of Haumea, consistent with the interpretation that 1995 SM55 belongs to the Haumea cluster.

 - **Abstract**
 The IceCube Neutrino Observatory has detected a flux of $\sim 1-10 \, {\rm TeV}$ neutrinos from the active galaxy, NGC 1068. The soft spectral index of these neutrinos has previously been interpreted as an indication that this source accelerates protons only up to energies of several hundred TeV. Here, we propose that this source might instead accelerate protons to significantly higher energies, but that the charged pions and muons produced in their interactions undergo significant synchrotron energy losses before they can decay, leading to a cutoff in the neutrino spectrum at TeV-scale energies. This scenario would require very strong magnetic fields to be present in the acceleration region of NGC 1068, on the order of $B \sim 10^7 \, {\rm G}$. We point out that this synchrotron cooling would impact the flavor ratios of the neutrinos from this source, providing a means to test this scenario with future very-large volume neutrino telescopes.

 - **Abstract**
 Only a handful of transiting giant exoplanets with orbital periods longer than 100 days are known. These warm exoplanets are valuable objects as their radius and mass can be measured leading to an in-depth characterisation of the planet's properties. Thanks to low levels of stellar irradiation and large orbital distances, the atmospheric properties and orbital parameters of warm exoplanets remain relatively unaltered by their host star, giving new insights into planetary formation and evolution. We aim at extending the sample of warm giant exoplanets with precise radii and masses. Our goal is to identify suitable candidates in the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) data and perform follow-up observations with ground-based instruments. We use the Next Generation Transit Survey (NGTS) to detect additional transits of planetary candidates in order to pinpoint their orbital period. We also monitored the target with several high-resolution spectrographs to measure the planetary mass and eccentricity. We report the discovery of a 106-day period Jupiter-sized planet around the G-type star TOI-2449 / NGTS-36. We jointly modelled the photometric and radial velocity data and find that the planet has a mass of 0.70 Mj and a radius of 1.002 Rj. The planetary orbit has a semi-major axis of 0.449 au and is slightly eccentric. We detect an additional 3-year signal in the radial velocity data likely due to the stellar magnetic cycle. Based on the planetary evolution models considered here, we find that TOI-2449 b / NGTS-36 b contains 11 Me of heavy elements and has a marginal planet-to-star metal enrichment of 3.3. Assuming a Jupiter-like Bond albedo, TOI-2449 b / NGTS-36 b has an equilibrium temperature of 400 K and is a good target for understanding nitrogen chemistry in cooler atmospheres.

 - **Abstract**
 High-mass stars, born in massive dense cores (MDCs), profoundly impact the cosmic ecosystem through feedback processes and metal enrichment, yet little is known about how MDCs assemble and transfer mass across scales to form high-mass young stellar objects (HMYSOs). Using multi-scale (40-2500 au) observations of an MDC hosting an HMYSO, we identify a coherent dynamical structure analogous to barred spiral galaxies: three 20,000 au spiral arms feed a 7,500 au central bar, which channels gas to a 2,000 au pseudodisk. Further accretion proceeds through the inner structures, including a Keplerian disk and an inner disk (100 au), which are thought to be driving a collimated bipolar outflow. This is the first time that these multi-scale structures (spiral arms, bar, streamers, envelope, disk, and outflow) have been simultaneously observed as a physically coherent structure within an MDC. Our discovery suggests that well-organized hierarchical structures play a crucial role during the gas accretion and angular momentum build-up of a massive disk.

 - **Abstract**
 With the release of the fourth LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA gravitational-wave catalog (GWTC-4), we are starting to gain a detailed view of the population of merging binary black holes. The formation channels of these black holes is not clearly understood, but different formation mechanisms may lead to subpopulations with different properties visible in gravitational-wave data. Adopting a phenomenological approach, we find GWTC-4 data supports the presence of at least three subpopulations, each associated with a different range of black hole mass and with sharp transition boundaries between them. Each subpopulation is characterized by different distributions for either the mass ratios, the black-hole spin magnitudes or both. Subpopulation A with primary mass $m_1 \leq 27.7^{+4.1}_{-3.4} M_{\odot}$ ($90 \%$ credibility), is characterized by a nearly flat mass ratio distribution $q=m_2/m_1$, and by small spin magnitudes ($\chi \leq 0.5^{+0.1}_{-0.1}$). Subpopulation B with $27.7^{+4.1}_{-3.4} M_{\odot} \leq m_1 \leq 40.2^{+4.7}_{-3.2} M_{\odot}$, has a much sharper preference for mass ratio $q \approx 1$. Subpopulation C, with $m_1 \geq 40.2^{+4.7}_{-3.2} M_{\odot}$, has support for large spin magnitudes, and tentative support for mass ratios $q\approx0.5$. We interpret these transitions as evidence for multiple subpopulations, each potentially associated with a different formation pathways. We suggest potential formation scenarios for each subpopulations, and suggest that Subpopulation B may be associated with chemically homogeneous evolution or population III stars. Our findings for Subpopulation C are largely consistent with recent claims of hierarchical mergers, but with some curious differences in properties.

 - **Abstract**
 Strong shocks occurring in supernova remnants (SNRs), and their interaction with an often anisotropic surrounding medium, make SNRs ideal laboratories for studying the production and acceleration of cosmic rays (CRs). Due to their complex morphology and phenomenology, different CR populations are expected to exist throughout the remnants, each characterized by its own energy spectrum. A comprehensive understanding of particle acceleration mechanisms and energetics in SNRs requires spatially resolved spectral and morphological studies. We want to highlight the crucial role of high-resolution radio images at high frequencies (> 10 GHz) for studying the spectral properties of different remnant regions and better constraining the models that describe their non-thermal emission from radio to $\gamma$-ray wavelengths. We studied the integrated radio spectrum of the SNR Kes 73 using single-dish observations performed with the Sardinia Radio Telescope (SRT) between 6.9 and 24.8 GHz, complemented by published data. The high-resolution map at 24.8 GHz was used to search for spatial variations in the spectral index across the remnant. We present the SRT images of Kes 73, providing the highest-frequency morphological and spectral characterization ever obtained for this source. By combining our 18.7 and 24.8 GHz maps with previously published interferometric images at 1.4 and 5 GHz, we identify a flatter spectrum in the western bright region compared to the rest of the shell. In the same region, we detect overlapping $^12$CO molecular emission and $\gamma$-ray radiation, providing strong evidence of SNR-molecular cloud interaction and enhanced CR production. We modelled the non-thermal radio to $\gamma$-ray emission from this region, favouring a lepto-hadronic scenario with a maximum electron energy of 1.1 TeV and a magnetic field strength of 25 $\mu$G.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy clusters are the most massive gravitationally bound structures in the Universe. Even if clusters are nearly virialized structures, they undergo merging processes, creating merging shocks, and suffer from feedback from galaxies and Active Galactic Nuclei; causing complex turbulent motions and amplifying their magnetic fields. These processes act as acceleration mechanisms for the plasma of the intracluster medium (ICM), originating a population of cosmic rays (CRs). Leptonic CRs have long been detected, but we should also expect a CR hadronic population that, through interactions with the ICM, should produce neutral pions that decay into gamma-rays. The detection of diffuse gamma-ray emission from galaxy clusters is one of the long-awaited milestones for the high-energy astroparticle physics community. Still, no unambiguous detection has yet been obtained. In this talk, we will present the results of a combined cluster analysis searching for CR-induced gamma-ray signals, using 16 years of Fermi-LAT data. In our previous work (di Mauro et al. 2023) we obtained from the combined analysis of 49 local galaxy clusters (12 years of data) a hint of signal between 2.5-3 sigma. These results are consistent with other works as well, which consistently find a non-vanishing hint of signal, around the detection threshold. In this new work, we use a sample of near, well-known galaxy clusters and develop CR-induced emission templates using well-established X-ray measurements for calibration, assuming self similarity for the members of our sample. To strengthen the robustness of our analysis, we define benchmark models to encapsulate the uncertainties in the spectral and spatial profiles for the CR-induced emission and perform the standard template-fitting analysis using the likelihood ratio test.

 - **Abstract**
 Stars like the Sun expel their outer layers and form planetary nebulae (PNe) as they evolve into white dwarfs. PNe exhibit diverse morphologies, the origins of which are not fully understood. PNe with OH (OHPNe) and H$_{2}$O (H$_{2}$OPNe) masers are thought to be nascent PNe. However, the number of known OHPNe and H$_{2}$OPNe remains small, and only in eight cases the position of the maser emission has been found to coincide with the PN, using the high astrometric accuracy of interferometric observations. In order to identify more OHPNe and H$_{2}$OPNe, we used public databases and our own ATCA/VLA observations to match the positions of OH and H$_{2}$O masers with known PNe and radio continuum emitters, considering radio continuum emission as a possible tracer of the photoionized gas that characterizes PNe. Here we report the confirmation of positional coincidence of maser emission with one more PN, and 12 PN candidates. Moreover, we have confirmed three evolved stars as `water fountains' (WFs) hosting H$_2$O masers. These WFs are associated with radio continuum emission, but their possible nature as PNe has not yet been confirmed. Although a final characterization of maser-emitting PNe as a group still requires confirmation of more objects, their distribution in the infrared color-color diagrams suggests that they are a heterogeneous group of PNe. In particular, the new OHPN IRAS 07027$-$7934 has been reported to contain a late [WC]-type central star, while the maser emission implies an O-rich envelope. This property is found in only one other known maser-emitting PN, although we found evidence that other confirmed and candidate OHPNe may also have mixed chemistry, since they show emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The new WF IRAS 18443$-$0231 shows radio continuum that is dominated by strong and variable non-thermal emission, as in magnetized outflows.
#### Absence of Radio Emission Reveals an Exceptionally Weak Explosion of the Putative Historical Supernova Pa 30

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first deep radio continuum observations of Pa 30, a nebula hosting a unique optical source driven by an ultrafast outflow with a velocity of 16,000 km s$^{-1}$. The nebula was proposed to be the remnant of a white dwarf merger that occurred in 1181CE. We report no detection of the radio diffuse emission from Pa 30 or radio emission from the central source, setting $3\sigma$ upper limit flux densities of $0.84\,\rm mJy$ and $0.29\,\rm mJy$ at 1.5 GHz and 6 GHz, respectively, for Pa 30. The radio surface brightness of Pa 30 is $\sim 3$ orders of magnitude smaller than that of typical supernova remnants (SNRs) with comparable angular size. If Pa 30 is an SNR, our observations show it to be the faintest known in the radio band. Considering that 10\% of the supernova (SN) kinetic energy is transferred to cosmic rays (CRs), the absence of radio synchrotron emission suggests that the SN kinetic energy $\lesssim3\times 10^{47}(B/10 \mu\rm G)^{-1.65}$ erg, which is 3 to 4 orders of magnitude lower than that of typical SNRs and the lowest measured among Galactic SNRs. There is also an indication of inefficient CR acceleration for this source. The low SN kinetic energy either implies the potential existence of many more radio-faint, sub-energetic SNRs in our Galaxy or challenges the SNR interpretation of Pa 30.
#### Evidence for a brief appearance of gamma-ray periodicity after a compact star merger

 - **Abstract**
 The product of a compact star merger is usually hypothesized to be a hyperaccreting black hole, typically resulting in a gamma-ray burst (GRB) with a duration shorter than 2~s. However, recent observations of GRB~211211A and GRB~230307A, both arising from compact star mergers, challenge this model due to their minute-long durations. The data from both events are consistent with having a nascent, rapidly spinning highly magnetized neutron star (a millisecond magnetar) as the merger product and GRB engine, but a smoking gun signature is still missing. Here we report strong but not yet conclusive evidence for the detection of a 909-Hz gamma-ray periodic signal during a brief time window of GRB~230307A, which is consistent with the rotation frequency of such a millisecond magnetar. Notably, the periodic signal appeared for only 160~ms at an epoch coinciding with the transition epoch when the jet emission from the GRB central engine ceased and when the delayed emission from high latitudes started. If this signal is real, the temporal and spectral features of this gamma-ray periodicity can be consistently interpreted as asymmetric mini-jet emission from a dissipating Poynting-flux-dominated jet, as revealed by the energy-dependent light curve data of this burst.

 - **Abstract**
 We offer a simple explanation for the small number of black holes observed in pairs with massive stars. In detached massive binaries, spherically symmetric accretion takes place. This accretion could result in effective energy release in the hard band only if the equipartition of the gravitational and magnetic energy of plasma is established (Shvartsmans theorem). However, we show that due to the magnetic exhaust effect this equilibrium is virtually never established for the actual magnetic fields observed on massive stars: Shvartsmans theorem does not work. As a result, it is virtually impossible to detect black holes in detached massive binaries by currently available means (mainly, through X-ray observations).

 - **Abstract**
 Disks around very low-mass stars (VLMS) provide environments for the formation of Earth-like planets. Mid-infrared observations have revealed that these disks exhibit weak silicate features and strong hydrocarbon emissions. This study characterizes the dust properties and geometrical structures of VLMS and brown dwarf (BD) disks, observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)/Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI), and connects these to gas column density and potential evolutionary stages. We analyze mid-infrared spectra of ten VLMS and BD disks as a part of the MIRI mid-Infrared Disk Survey (MINDS) program. Spectral slopes and silicate band strengths are compared with hydrocarbon emission line ratios, which probe the gas column density. Moreover, the Dust Continuum Kit with Line emission from Gas is used to quantify grain sizes, dust compositions, and crystallinity in the disk surface. The disks are classified into less, more, and fully settled geometries based on their mid-infrared spectral slopes and silicate band strengths. Less-settled disks show a relatively strong silicate band, high spectral slopes, and low crystallinity, and are dominated by 5 $\mu$m-sized grains. More-settled disks have weaker silicate band, low spectral slope, enhanced crystallinity, and higher mass fractions of smaller grains. Fully-settled disks exhibit little or no silicate emission and negative spectral slopes. An overall trend of increasing gas column density with decreasing spectral slope suggests that more molecular gas is exposed when the dust opacity decreases due to dust settling. Our findings may reflect possible evolutionary pathways with dust settling and thermal processing or may point to inner-disk clearing or a collisional cascade. These results highlight the need for broader samples to understand the link between dust and gas appearance in regions where Earth-like planets form.

 - **Abstract**
 The extreme conditions in the early stages of planetary evolution are thought to shape its subsequent development. High internal temperatures from giant impacts can provide sufficient energy to drive extreme volatile loss, with hydrogen being most readily lost. However, the conditions required for maintaining a primordial atmosphere over geological timescales remain enigmatic. This paper revisits the core powered mass loss model for hydrogen removal from planetary atmospheres. One popular approach is to combine mass continuity at the sonic point with an energy-based constraint. We demonstrate that the so-called ``energy limited'' component of this model is unnecessary because atmospheric loss following giant impacts is governed solely by conditions at the sonic point. By simulating a broad range of synthetic exoplanets, varying in planetary mass, atmospheric mass fraction, and temperature, we find that the ``energy limited'' model can underestimate the mass loss rates by up to eight orders of magnitude. Our findings suggest that, for sufficiently hot post-impact surface conditions, hydrogen rich atmospheres can be removed on dynamical timescales that are far shorter than one million years.

 - **Abstract**
 We present new ALMA [OIII]$_{88}$ observations of eight previously [CII]$_{158}$-detected galaxies at $6.8 \lesssim z \lesssim 7.7$. Six of our targets -- the primary sample -- are massive, UV-luminous galaxies drawn from the REBELS survey, while the remaining two are UV-fainter galaxies that were previously serendipitously detected through their luminous [CII] lines in the REBELS fields. We detect [OIII]$_{88}$ emission in all eight galaxies at $6.2 - 17.7\sigma$ significance, and find them to be consistent with the local dwarf galaxy relation between $L_\mathrm{[OIII]}$ and star formation rate. Our sample spans [OIII]/[CII] $\approx 1.9 - 9.6$, which is typical for the high-redshift galaxy population. Five of the primary targets benefit from JWST/NIRSpec observations, enabling a direct comparison of the [OIII]/[CII] ratio against rest-optical ISM diagnostics. We supplement our high-redshift sample with eleven $z\approx6-14$ galaxies in the literature for which similar ALMA and JWST observations are available, and furthermore compare to the [OIII]/[CII] ratios measured for local dwarf galaxies. We find that, at fixed metallicity and ionization parameter, $z>6$ galaxies show elevated [OIII]/[CII] ratios compared to local dwarfs. Instead, we find that a large [OIII]$_{4959,5007}$+H$\beta$ equivalent width -- a proxy for burstiness -- is the main driver of the high [OIII]/[CII] ratios seen in the early Universe, which is primarily due to [CII] being suppressed in bursty galaxies. Given the apparent validity of the [OIII]$_{88}$-SFR relation across most of cosmic time, as well as the abundance of young, bursty galaxies at high redshift, [OIII]$_{88}$ is set to remain a powerful ISM tracer at the cosmic dawn.

 - **Abstract**
 The InterGalactic Magnetic Field (IGMF), which could permeate the cosmic voids but was never detected so far, is considered a relic of the early Universe. Constraints on its strength $B$ can be derived from its influence on time-delayed very-high-energy photons from Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) in the electromagnetic cascades along their path to the Earth. The present lower limit achieved on its intensity is $10^{-18}\;\mathrm{G}$. In this work, we simulate data from the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), accounting for realistic observational constraints, and we apply a joint spectral and temporal fit to characterize the IGMF. GRBs 190114C and 221009A are used as test cases to assess the sensitivity of CTAO. They demonstrate that a broad range of IGMF strengths can be probed with a lower bound as high as $10^{-15}\;\mathrm{G}$. Notably, we show that observations by the CTAO first large telescope, LST-1, already allow us to exclude field strengths up to $3\times 10^{-17}\;\mathrm{G}$.

 - **Abstract**
 The study of the chemical composition of star-forming regions is key to understand the chemical ingredients available during the formation of planetary systems. Given that the chemical inventory on interstellar dust grains in the prestellar phases might be altered due to the prostostellar warm-up, an alternative to infer the chemical composition on the grains could be to observe regions affected by shocks associated with molecular outflows. Such shocks can desorb the molecules, and might produce less chemical processing due to shorter timescales. We present here a detailed study of the chemical reservoir of a shocked region located in the G31.41+0.31 protocluster using GUAPOS data (G31.41+0.31 Unbiased ALMA sPectral Observational Survey). We report here the detection of 30 molecular species (plus 18 isotopologues). We performed a comparison of the molecular ratios in the shocked region with those derived towards the hot core of G31.41+0.31, finding that they are poorly correlated, excepting N-bearing species. Our results confirm observationally that a different level of chemical alteration is present in hot cores and in shocks. While the former likely alter the molecular ratios due to thermal processing during longer timescales, the latter might represent freshly desorbed material that constitutes a better proxy of the icy mantle composition. The similarity of molecular ratios between the N-bearing species in the G31.41 shock and the hot core suggests that these species are desorbed at early evolutionary stages. Interestingly, we have found that the abundances in the G31.41 shock show better correlations with other shock-dominated regions (two protostellar outflows and a Galactic Center molecular cloud). This suggests a negligible gas-phase chemistry after shock-induced ejection from grains, and that the ice-mantle composition is similar regardless of the Galactic environment.

 - **Abstract**
 RUBIES-UDS-QG-z7 (RQG) is the earliest massive quiescent galaxy identified to date, inferred to have formed its abundant stellar mass in a single burst that ceases rapidly before $z \sim 8$. An object of such extreme nature challenges our understanding of galaxy formation, requiring rapid growth and quenching mechanisms only 0.6 Gyr after the Big Bang and implying number densities 2 dex higher than currently predicted by simulations. We use synthetic observables to identify analogous systems within the First Light And Reionisation Epoch Simulations (FLARES) and find two massive galaxies dominated by rapidly quenched bursts. Beyond demonstrating that the current FLARES model is capable of producing RQG-like systems, these analogues provide a laboratory within which to study the underlying physics. Their active galactic nuclei (AGN) heat and expel gas, inducing rapid quenching and preventing timely rejuvenation. This causes above-average chemical enrichment at a given stellar mass, with super solar levels predicted for RQG. These metallicities are underestimated by spectral energy distribution fitting and we show that $\alpha$-enhancement cannot be solely responsible. Degeneracies with age and dust attenuation appear the more likely causes. Tensions between observed and simulated number densities can be alleviated in part by considering systematics, but adjustments to AGN feedback, such as allowing super-Eddington accretion rates, may be required for full agreement.

 We introduce SpectraPyle, a versatile spectral stacking pipeline developed for the Euclid mission's NISP spectroscopic surveys, aimed at extracting faint emission lines and spectral features from large galaxy samples in the Wide and Deep Surveys. Designed for computational efficiency and flexible configuration, SpectraPyle supports the processing of extensive datasets critical to Euclid's non-cosmological science goals. We validate the pipeline using simulated spectra processed to match Euclid's expected final data quality. Stacking enables robust recovery of key emission lines, including Halpha, Hbeta, [O III], and [N II], below individual detection limits. However, the measurement of galaxy properties such as star formation rate, dust attenuation, and gas-phase metallicity are biased at stellar mass below log10(M*/Msol) ~ 9 due to the flux-limited nature of Euclid spectroscopic samples, which cannot be overcome by stacking. The SFR-stellar mass relation of the parent sample is recovered reliably only in the Deep survey for log10(M*/Msol) > 10, whereas the metallicity-mass relation is recovered more accurately over a wider mass range. These limitations are caused by the increased fraction of redshift measurement errors at lower masses and fluxes. We examine the impact of residual redshift contaminants that arises from misidentified emission lines and noise spikes, on stacked spectra. Even after stringent quality selections, low-level contamination (< 6%) has minimal impact on line fluxes due to the systematically weaker emission of contaminants. Percentile-based analysis of stacked spectra provides a sensitive diagnostic for detecting contamination via coherent spurious features at characteristic wavelengths. While our simulations include most instrumental effects, real Euclid data will require further refinement of contamination mitigation strategies.

 - **Abstract**
 We use FIRE-2 cosmological zoom-in hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the co-evolution between Milky Way-size galaxies and their host dark matter halos. We find that the formation of these galaxies follows a two-phase pattern, with an early phase featured by hot dynamics, bulge-dominated structure and bursty star formation, and a later phase featured by cold dynamics, disk-dominated structure and steady star formation. The transition times of these galaxy properties are tightly correlated with the time when the host halo transits from fast to slow accretion, suggesting that the two-phase assembly of halos drive the two-phase formation of galaxies. The physical origin of dynamical hotness can be summarized into two modes of star formation: a scattered mode in which stars form at large radii within cold gas streams associated with fast assembly of halos, and a concentrated mode in which stars form at small radii through violent fragmentation from globally self-gravitated gas when halo assembly is about to slow down. Cold gaseous and stellar disks can form only when the conditions of the two modes are removed by the stall of halo assembly and the reduction of gas by feedback processes. The two modes of star formation leave distinct imprints on the structural properties of high-redshift galaxies, providing implications to be tested by JWST and future observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Many questions must be answered before understanding the relationship between the emerging magnetic flux through the solar surface and the extreme geoeffective events. The main ingredients for getting X-ray class flares and large interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) are the build-up of electric current in the corona, the existence of magnetic free energy, magnetic energy/helicity ratio, twist, and magnetic stress in active regions (ARs). The upper limit of solar energy in the space research era, as well as the potential for experiencing superflares and extreme solar events, can be predicted using MHD simulations of CMEs. To address this problem, we consider the recent events of May 2024 and use three MHD models: 1) OHM ("Observationally driven High order scheme Magnetohydrodynamic code") for investigating the magnetic evolutions at a synthetic dipole structure. 2) TMF (time-dependent magneto-friction) for setting up an initial non-potential magnetic field in the active region. A zero-beta MHD model for tracing the magnetic evolution of active regions. 3) EUHFORIA (''European heliospheric forecasting information asset'') for interplanetary CME propagations. For the eruptive flares with CMEs, magnetic solar energy is computed along with data-constrained MHD simulations for the May 2024 events. We show the consistency between the data-initiated realistic simulation of the May 2024 big event and energy scalings from an idealised simulation of a bipolar eruption using OHM. The estimated free magnetic energy did not surpass $5.2 \times 10^{32}\;$erg. Good arrival time predictions ($<3$ hours) are achieved with the EUHFORIA simulation with the cone model. We note the interest in coupling all the chains of codes from the Sun to the Earth and developing different approaches to test the results.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore for the first time the possibility of detecting lensed star transients in galaxy-galaxy strong lensing systems upon repeated, deep imaging using the {\it James-Webb Space Telescope} ({\it JWST}). Our calculation predicts that the extremely high recent star formation rate of $\sim 100\,M_{\odot}\textrm{yr}^{-1}$ over the last 50 Myr (not accounting for image multiplicity) in the ``Cosmic Horseshoe'' lensed system ($z = 2.381$) generates many young, bright stars, of which their large abundance is expected to lead to a detection rate of $\sim 60$ transients per pointing in {\it JWST} observations with a $5\sigma$ limiting magnitude of $\sim 29\,m_{AB}$. With the high expected detection rate and little room for uncertainty for the lens model compared with cluster lenses, our result suggests that the Cosmic Horseshoe could be an excellent tool to test the nature of Dark Matter based on the spatial distribution of transients, and can be used to constrain axion mass if Dark Matter is constituted of ultra-light axions. We also argue that the large distance modulus of $\sim46.5\,$mag at $z \approx 2.4$ can act as a filter to screen out less massive stars as transients and allow one to better constrain the high-mass end of the stellar initial mass function based on the transient detection rate. Follow-up {\it JWST} observations of the Cosmic Horseshoe with would allow one to better probe the nature of Dark Matter and the star formation properties, such as the initial mass function at the cosmic noon, via lensed star transients.

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce a novel cosmographic framework to trace the late-time kinematics of the Universe without assuming any underlying dynamics. The method relies on generalized Padé-$(2,1)$ expansions around arbitrary pivot redshifts, which, compared to state-of-the-art calculations, reduce truncation errors by up to two orders of magnitude at high redshift and yield more precise constraints by defining cosmographic parameters exactly where the data lie. This avoids extrapolations, mitigates degeneracies, and enables a clean disentangling of their effects. Using the latest low-redshift datasets, we center the generalized expansion in multiple bins across $z\in[0,1]$ and obtain precise constraints on the redshift evolution of cosmographic parameters. We find that all key parameters deviate from their $\Lambda$CDM predictions in a redshift-dependent way that can be naturally explained within dynamical Dark Energy scenarios. The deceleration parameter $q(z)$ follows a redshift evolution consistent with the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameterization, while the generalized $Om(z)$ diagnostic shows deviations of up to $\sim4\sigma$ from the constant $\Lambda$CDM expectation, closely matching the CPL predictions. Taken together, these results point to footprints of dynamical Dark Energy in the kinematics of the Universe at $z\lesssim 1$.
#### Sound-Horizon-Agnostic Inference of the Hubble Constant and Neutrino Mass from BAO, CMB Lensing, and Galaxy Weak Lensing and Clustering

 - **Abstract**
 We present a sound-horizon-agnostic determination of the Hubble constant, $H_0$, by combining DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data with the latest cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing measurements from Planck, ACT, and SPT-3G, the angular size of the CMB acoustic scale, Dark Energy Survey Year-3 ($3\times2$-pt) galaxy weak lensing and clustering correlations, and the Pantheon+ supernova sample. In this analysis, the sound horizon at the drag epoch, $r_d$, is treated as a free parameter, avoiding assumptions about early-Universe physics. By combining uncalibrated comoving distances from BAO and supernovae with constraints on the matter density $\Omega_m h^2$ from CMB and galaxy lensing/clustering, we break the $r_d$-$H_0$ degeneracy and obtain $H_0 = 70.0 \pm 1.7$ km/s/Mpc when the sum of the neutrino masses is fixed at $\Sigma m_\nu = 0.06$ eV. With a conservative prior on the amplitude of primordial fluctuations, $A_s$, we find $H_0 = 70.03 \pm 0.97$ km/s/Mpc and $r_d = 144.8 \pm 1.6$ Mpc. Allowing $\Sigma m_\nu$ to vary yields $H_0 = 75.3^{+3.3}_{-4.0}$ km/s/Mpc and $\Sigma m_\nu = 0.55^{+0.23}_{-0.37}$ ($<1.11$ eV) at 68% (95%) CL, and $H_0 = 73.9 \pm 2.2$ km/s/Mpc with $\Sigma m_\nu = 0.46^{+0.21}_{-0.25}$ ($=0.46^{+0.40}_{-0.45}$ eV) at 68% (95%) CL when a prior on $A_s$ is applied. Forecasts for the completed DESI BAO program, combined with Simons-Observatory-like CMB lensing, next-generation $3\times2$-pt data, and expanded supernova samples predict $\sigma(H_0) \simeq 0.67$ km/s/Mpc with fixed $\Sigma m_\nu$, and $\sigma(H_0) \simeq 1.1$ km/s/Mpc with $\Sigma m_\nu < 0.133$ ($<0.263$) eV at 68% (95%) CL when the neutrino mass is varied. As the precision of BAO, CMB lensing, and galaxy lensing/clustering improve, this $r_d$-agnostic framework will provide an independent test of the need for new physics at recombination.
