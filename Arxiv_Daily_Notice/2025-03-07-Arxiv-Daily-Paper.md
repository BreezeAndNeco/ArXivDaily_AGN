#### Much Ado About Nothing: Galaxy Formation and Galactic Outflows in Cosmic Voids

 - **Abstract**
 We present a theoretical framework for calculating the volume filling fraction of galactic outflows in cosmic voids by integrating analytical models for the halo mass function (HMF), the halo occupation fraction, the stellar mass-halo mass relation, and outflow sizes. Using RAMSES, we perform a hydrodynamical zoom-in simulation of the central 25 cMpc/h region of a spherical void, identified as the lowest-density region among 1,000 random spheres in a parent 1 Gpc box simulation. This void has a diameter of 120 cMpc/h and a density contrast of $\delta \simeq -0.8$. We find that the properties of void galaxies remain stable when expanding the zoom-in region to 50 cMpc/h, though our relatively low mass resolution impacts the results. Our higher-resolution simulation aligns with the analytical HMF that accounts for the void's underdensity and size. While higher resolution improves stellar mass estimates for low-mass halos, computational constraints necessitate a theoretical framework that enables extrapolation to infinite resolution. Our analytical model, calibrated to our simulations, enables extrapolation down to the filtering mass of star-forming halos. To compare galaxy properties in this void with those in the field, we conduct a companion field simulation of the same box size. At infinite resolution, we predict wind volume filling fractions of $18.6\%$ in the field and $3.1\%$ in our void, with values dependent on cosmic variance, void size, and underdensity. Dwarf galaxies contribute minimally, and resolving halos to $M_{\rm h}=10^{10} M_\odot$ suffices for robust estimates. Applying our framework to the Local Group void ($\delta \simeq -0.5$, $R=20\ \mathrm{cMpc}$), we predict a wind volume filling fraction of $9.6\%\pm3.3\%$.

 - **Abstract**
 With the advent of GRAVITY+, the upgrade to the beam combiner GRAVITY at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI), fainter and higher redshift active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are becoming observable, opening an unprecedented opportunity to further our understanding of the cosmic coevolution of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies. To identify an initial sample of high-redshift type~1 AGNs that can be observed with GRAVITY+, we have obtained spectroscopic data with NTT/SOFI of the most promising candidates. Our goal is to measure their broad line region (BLR) fluxes and assess their physical geometries by analysing the spectral profiles of their Balmer lines. We present 29 $z$ $\sim$ 2 targets with strong H$\alpha$ emission in the $K$-band. Their line profiles are strongly non-Gaussian, with a narrow core and broad wings. This can be explained as a combination of rotation and turbulence contributing to the total profile or two physically distinct inner and outer regions. We find small H$\alpha$ virial factors, which we attribute to the low full-width-half-maximum (FWHM)/$\sigma$ ratios of their non-Gaussian profiles, noting that this can lead to discrepancies in black hole masses derived from scaling relations. We also find two targets that show tentative evidence of BLRs dominated by radial motions. Lastly, we estimate the expected differential phase signals that will be seen with GRAVITY+, which will provide guidance for the observing strategy that will be adopted.

 - **Abstract**
 We present new Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations that, for the first time, detect hydrogen and helium radio recombination lines from a protoplanetary disk. We imaged the Orion Nebula Cluster at 3.1 mm with a spectral setup that covered the $n=42 \rightarrow 41$ transitions of hydrogen (H41$\alpha$) and helium (He41$\alpha$). The unprecedented sensitivity of these observations enables us to search for radio recombination lines toward the positions of ${\sim}200$ protoplanetary disks. We detect H41$\alpha$ from 17 disks, all of which are HST-identified `proplyds.' The detected H41$\alpha$ emission is spatially coincident with the locations of proplyd ionization fronts, indicating that proplyd H41$\alpha$ emission is produced by gas that has been photoevaporated off the disk and ionized by UV radiation from massive stars. We measure the fluxes and widths of the detected H41$\alpha$ lines and find line fluxes of ${\sim}30-800$ mJy km s$^{-1}$ and line widths of ${\sim}30-90$ km s$^{-1}$. The derived line widths indicate that the broadening of proplyd H41$\alpha$ emission is dominated by outflowing gas motions associated with external photoevaporation. The derived line fluxes, when compared with measurements of 3.1 mm free-free flux, imply that the ionization fronts of H41$\alpha$-detected proplyds have electron temperatures of ${\sim}6,000-11,000$ K and electron densities of ${\sim}10^6-10^7$ cm$^{-3}$. Finally, we detect He41$\alpha$ towards one H41$\alpha$-detected source and find evidence that this system is helium-rich. Our study demonstrates that radio recombination lines are readily detectable in ionized photoevaporating disks, providing a new way to measure disk properties in clustered star-forming regions.

 - **Abstract**
 While molecular outflows have been studied in details with radio interferometry, observations of the hotter gas in protostellar outflows at a comparable physical scale is often challenging. Combined with ALMA, JWST allows us to investigate the cold and hot gas with unprecedented spatial resolution and sensitivity. We present a detailed comparison between the gas distributions probed with ALMA and JWST in the primary outflow of IRAS 15398$-$3359. At 2000 au scale, the southwestern outflow shows four shell structures in 5--10 micron continuum, whereas the submillimeter H$_2$CO emission traces two of the four shells closest to the protostar. Submillimeter emission from CS, CCH, c-C$_3$H$_2$, and CH$_3$OH shows the same two shells, and the $^{12}$CO emission covers most of the outflow region. SO and SiO only trace a condensation at the edge of the shell closest to the protostar. None of these lines observed with ALMA show the outermost shell. At 500 au scale, we find hot H$_2$ gas inside the outflow cavity with JWST. The derived temperature of H$_2$ is 1147$\pm$198 K within a 0\farcs5 aperture at the protostar. The foreground mass column density of dust is (1.4--2.0)$\times$10$^{-3}$ g$\cdot$cm$^{-2}$ (A$_{\rm v}$ = 47--66 mag) in the outflow, using the dust model from Weingartner & Draine (2001). We also find an 8$^{\circ}$ difference between the directions toward the [Fe II] knot and the outermost shell in the MIRI image, which may be interpreted as the precession of the [Fe II] jet. The dynamical timescale of the [Fe II] knot is 10 yrs, suggesting a current event.

 - **Abstract**
 Studying the gas content of post-starburst (PSB) galaxies can provide valuable clues regarding the process of fast quenching. Although previous works have studied the molecular gas content of PSBs, only a handful of HI measurements exist. Here, we present new Five hundred metre Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST) 21cm observations of 44 PSBs, leading to 42 detections or sensitive upper limits of HI, which we combine with 26 archival measurements, for a total sample of 68 PSB MHI measurements. HI is detected in 57/68 galaxies, with HI masses ranging from MHI ~10^8.5 up to 10^10 Msun and gas fractions (fHI = MHI/M*) from a few percent up to almost 30 percent. Post-starbursts therefore retain ample atomic gas reservoirs, despite no longer forming stars. By comparing with a stellar mass-matched sample of star-forming galaxies in xGASS, we find that PSBs have, on average, gas fractions lower by ~0.2-0.4 dex, consistent with a mild reduction compared with their progenitor population. However, PSBs show a diversity of HI properties; about half have HI gas masses within the expected scatter of the star-forming population with the remaining 50 per cent up to a factor of 10 more gas-poor. Compared with galaxies in the green valley, about two thirds of PSBs have gas fractions within the expected range, with the remaining third up to a factor of 10 more gas-rich. Our results demonstrate that quenching in PSBs is not the result of wholesale removal of the atomic gas reservoir and that the population has atomic gas fractions that span the range from star-forming to green valley galaxies. We find no correlation between HI gas mass and time since burst; even galaxies a Gyr past their burst can remain HI-normal. The significant gas reservoirs remaining in many PSBs leaves open the possibility for future rekindling of star formation.
#### Insight-HXMT, NICER and NuSTAR views to the newly discovered black hole X-ray binary Swift J151857.0--572147

 - **Abstract**
 The systematic properties are largely unknown for the black hole X-ray binary Swift J151857.0--572147 newly discovered in the 2024 outburst. The nature of a black hole can be completely defined by specifying the mass and dimensionless spin parameter. Therefore, accurate measurement of the two fundamental parameters is important for understanding the nature of black holes. The joint spectral fitting of a reflection component with simultaneous observations from Insight-HXMT, NICER and NuSTAR reveals for the first time a black hole dimensionless spin of $0.84^{+0.17}_{-0.26}$ and an inclination angle of $21.1^{+4.5}_{-3.6}$ degree for this system. Monitoring of the soft state by NICER results in disk flux and temperature following $F_{\rm disk} \propto T_{\rm in}^{3.83\pm 0.17}$. For the standard thin disk, $L_{\rm disk}\approx 4\pi R_{\rm in}^{2}\sigma T_{\rm in}^{4}$, so the relationship between the flux and temperature of the disk we measured indicates that the inner radius of the disk is stable and the disk is in the Innermost Stable Circular Orbit. With an empirical relation built previously between the black hole outburst profile and the intrinsic power output, the source distance is estimated as $5.8\pm 2.5$ kpc according to the outburst profile and peak flux observed by Insight-HXMT and NICER. Finally, a black hole mass of $3.67\pm1.79-8.07\pm 4.20 M_\odot$ can be inferred from a joint diagnostic of the aforementioned parameters measured for this system. This system is also consistent with most black hole X-ray binaries with high spin and a mass in the range of 5--20 $M_\odot$
#### The peculiar disk evolution of 4U 1630--472 observed by Insight-HXMT during the 2022 and 2023 outbursts

 - **Abstract**
 We study the spectral properties of the black hole X-ray transient binary 4U 1630--472 during the 2022 and 2023 outbursts with Insight-HXMT observations. We find that the outbursts are in peculiar soft states. The effect of the hardening factor on the disk temperature is taken into account by kerrbb, and the flux and temperature of the disk are found to follow $F \propto T_{\rm eff}^{3.92\pm 0.13}$ and $F \propto T_{\rm eff}^{4.91\pm 1.00}$, for the two outbursts respectively. The flux-temperature relation is roughly consistent with holding a standard disk, By fitting with the p-free model, the p-value is found to have anti-correlation with disk temperature. Combined a joint diagnostic in a diagram of the relation between the non-thermal fraction and luminosity, by enclosing as well the previous outbursts, reveals a possible pattern for the disk evolution toward a slim one, and such an evolution may depend on the fraction of the non-thermal emission in the high soft state.

 - **Abstract**
 One of the most important open questions in planet formation is how dust grains in a protoplanetary disk manage to overcome growth barriers and form the $\sim$100km planet building blocks that we call planetesimals. There appears to be a gap between the largest grains that can be produce by coagulation, and the smallest grains that are needed for the streaming instability (SI) to form planetesimals. Here we explore a novel hypothesis: That dust coagulation and the SI work in tandem. That they form a feedback loop where each one boosts the action of the other to bridge the gap between dust grains and planetesimals. We develop a semi-analytical model of dust concentration due to the SI, and an analytic model of how the SI affects the fragmentation and radial drift barriers. We then combine those to model our proposed feedback loop. In the fragmentation-limited regime, we find a powerful synergy between the SI and dust growth that drastically increases both grain sizes and densities. We find that a midplane dust-to-gas ratio of $\epsilon \ge 0.3$ is a sufficient condition for the feedback loop to reach the planetesimal-forming region for turbulence values $10^{-4} \le \alpha \le 10^{-3}$ and grain sizes $0.01 \le {\rm St} \le 0.1$. In contrast, the drift-limited regime only shows grain growth, without significant dust accumulation. Planet formation in the drift-limited portion of the disk may require other processes (particle traps) to halt radial drift.

 - **Abstract**
 In the era of time-domain, multi-messenger astronomy, the detection of transient events on the high-energy electromagnetic sky has become more important than ever. The Gravitational wave high-energy Electromagnetic Counterpart All-sky Monitor (GECAM) is a dedicated mission to monitor gamma-ray transients, launched in December, 2020. A real-time on-board trigger and location software, using the traditional signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) method for blind search, is constrained to relatively bright signals due to the limitations in on-board computing resources and the need for real-time search. In this work, we developed a ground-based pipeline for GECAM to search for various transients, especially for weak bursts missed by on-board software. This pipeline includes both automatic and manual mode, offering options for blind search and targeted search. The targeted search is specifically designed to search for interesting weak bursts, such as gravitational wave-associated gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). From the ground search of the data in the first year, GECAM has been triggered by 54 GRBs and other transients, including soft gamma-ray repeaters, X-ray binaries, solar flares, terrestrial gamma-ray flashes. We report the properties of each type of triggers,such as trigger time and light curves. With this search pipeline and assuming a soft Band spectrum, the GRB detection sensitivity of GECAM is increased to about 1.1E-08 erg cm-2 s-1 (10 keV - 1000 keV, burst duration of 20 s). These results demonstrate that the GECAM ground search system (both blind search and targeted search) is a versatile pipeline to recover true astrophysical signals which were too weak to be found in the on-board search.

 - **Abstract**
 MAXI J1348-630 as a low-mass black hole binary system in the Galaxy showed an X-ray outburst in 2019. We analyzed the Insight-HXMT spectral data in the low hard state (LHS) and intermediate state (IS) during the outburst from MJD 58510 to 58519 at the energy band from 2 keV to 100 keV. During the entire process, a thin disk extending to the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) from a large truncated disk (truncated radius $> 5$ ISCO) suggests the corona geometry evolution. There exist time lags between radio and hard X-ray flux peaks: the 30 - 100 keV flux about 5 days ahead of radio flux, 11-30 keV flux about 4 days ahead, and reflection fraction about 2 days ahead, the accretion disk approaching the ISCO about 1 day before radio peak. This disk-corona-jet coupling and evolution suggest the corona containing two phases of cold dense material and hot gas, with high temperature region of corona cooling fast. The strong radio emission accompanying with a thin accretion disk of a relatively high accretion rate favors magnetic tower jet mechanism.
#### The Impact of Expanding HII Regions on Filament G37:Curved Magnetic Field and Multiple Direction Material Flows

 - **Abstract**
 Filament G37 exhibits a distinctive "caterpillar" shape, characterized by two semicircular structures within its 40\,pc-long body, providing an ideal target to investigate the formation and evolution of filaments. By analyzing multiple observational data, such as CO spectral line, the H$\alpha$\,RRL, and multi-wavelength continuum, we find that the expanding H\,{\scriptsize II} regions surrounding filament G37 exert pressure on the structure of the filament body, which kinetic process present as the gas flows in multiple directions along its skeleton. The curved magnetic field structure of filament G37 derived by employing the Velocity Gradient Technique with CO is found to be parallel to the filament body and keeps against the pressure from expanded H\,{\scriptsize II} regions. The multi-directional flows in the filament G37 could cause the accumulation and subsequent collapse of gas, resulting in the formation of massive clumps. The curved structure and star formation observed in filament G37 are likely a result of the filament body being squeezed by the expanding H\,{\scriptsize II} region. This physical process occurs over a timescale of approximately 5\,Myr. The filament G37 provides a potential candidate for end-dominated collapse.

 - **Abstract**
 Both theoretical models and observational evidence indicate that jets and/or outflows driven by central active supermassive black holes exert a significant feedback effect on the overall properties of their host galaxies. Theoretical models suggest that the spin of supermassive black holes drives relativistic jets. Therefore, we investigate the relationship between black hole spin, star formation rate, and black hole mass using a sample of 48 low-redshift supermassive black holes. By performing multiband fitting of spectral energy distribution, we derive the star formation rates and stellar masses of the host galaxies harbouring these supermassive black holes. Our main results are as follows: (i) For black holes with masses \(M_{\rm BH} \lesssim 10^{6.5} M_{\odot}\), the spin increases with increasing black hole mass, suggesting that black hole growth is primarily driven by gas accretion, particularly in the coherent gas accretion regime. Conversely, for black holes with masses \(M_{\rm BH} \gtrsim 10^{7.5} M_{\odot}\), the spin decreases with increasing black hole mass, indicating that growth occurs mainly through mergers, inducing chaotic accretion. (ii) At low star formation rates, black hole spin increases with increasing star formation rates, consistent with gas accretion. However, at high star formation rates, black hole spin decreases with increasing star formation rates, suggesting black hole mergers. The value of the black hole spin may be used to diagnose the star formation rate of the host galaxies through active galactic nuclei activities. (iii) Our data and analysis confirm the well-known relation between stellar mass and black hole mass, with the fitting function $\log M_{\rm BH}=0.57\log M_{*}+1.94$.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a transformer model, named DeepHalo, to predict the occurrence of halo coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Our model takes as input an active region (AR) and a profile, where the profile contains a time series of data samples in the AR that are collected 24 hours before the beginning of a day, and predicts whether the AR would produce a halo CME during that day. Each data sample contains physical parameters, or features, derived from photospheric vector magnetic field data taken by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). We survey and match CME events in the Space Weather Database Of Notification, Knowledge, Information (DONKI) and Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) CME Catalog, and compile a list of CMEs including halo CMEs and non-halo CMEs associated with ARs in the period between November 2010 and August 2023. We use the information gathered above to build the labels (positive versus negative) of the data samples and profiles at hand, where the labels are needed for machine learning. Experimental results show that DeepHalo with a true skill statistics (TSS) score of 0.907 outperforms a closely related long short-term memory network with a TSS score of 0.821. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the transformer model has been used for halo CME prediction.

 - **Abstract**
 Integral field unit (IFU) spectroscopic observations of resolved galaxies provide an optimal experimental setting for determination of stellar population properties, in particular - age, metallicity and $\alpha$-enhancement, which are key to understanding evolution of galaxies across diverse physical environments. We determine these properties for the edge-on disc galaxy IC 1553, through stellar population models fitted to MUSE IFU observations. From our determined spatial distributions of metallicity and [$\alpha$/Fe], we serendipitiously identify the unique chemical signature of a dwarf galaxy that is co-spatial with the luminous disc of IC 1553. The dwarf galaxy is characterized by the presence of higher [$\alpha$/Fe] and metal-poor stellar populations relative to the disc of IC 1553. The identified dwarf is dynamically cold from its determined kinematics, consistent with being a satellite of IC 1553. From modeling the Spitzer IRAC 3.6 $\mu m$ image of IC 1553, we confirmed the presence of the dwarf galaxy and calculated its stellar mass to be $\sim1.28\times 10^{9} \rm M_{\odot}$. This is the first such identification of a dwarf galaxy from its unique chemical signature in such integrated light IFU observations, even though its hidden by the luminous body of its massive host.
#### CO Emission and Absorption-line Survey of the M87 Nucleus Using Archival ALMA Imaging

 - **Abstract**
 We present an M87 molecular line search from archival Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) imaging, covering the circumnuclear disk (CND) as well as ionized gas filaments and dusty cloud regions. We find no evidence for CO emission in the central ~kpc and place an upper limit of $M_{H_2} < 2.3\times 10^5$ $M_\odot$ in the atomic gas CND, a factor of 20$\times$ lower than previous surveys. During this search, we discovered extragalactic CO absorption lines in the J = 1-0, 2-1, and 3-2 transitions against the bright (Jy-scale) active nucleus. These CO lines are narrow (~5 km s$^{-1}$) and blueshifted with respect to the galaxy's systemic velocity by -75 to -84 km s$^{-1}$. This CO absorber appears to be kinematically distinct from outflowing atomic gas seen in absorption. Assuming a diffuse molecular phase, low integrated opacities ranging from $\tau_{CO} \sim 0.02-0.06$ km s$^{-1}$ and column density $N_{CO} = 1.16\times 10^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$ translate to $N_{H_2} \sim (1-2) \times 10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$. CO excitation temperatures spanning $T_{ex} \sim 8$ K to ~30 K do not follow local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) expectations, and non-LTE radex radiative transfer modeling suggests the CO absorber has a number density $n_{H_2} \sim 5000$ cm$^{-3}$. Taken together, the observed CO absorption lines are most consistent with a thin, pressure-confined filament seen slightly off-center from the M87 nucleus. We also use these ALMA data to explore the impact of residual telluric lines and atmospheric variability on the identification and classification of narrow extragalactic lines. Additionally, we demonstrate how bandpass calibration limitations may introduce broad but very low S/N absorption and emission signatures near such a bright continuum source.

 The signature of Baryon Acoustic Oscillation in the clustering of dark-matter tracers allows us to measure $(D_A(z), H(z))$ independently. Treating these as conjugate variables, we are motivated to study cosmological evolution in the phase space of dimensionless variables $x = H_o D_A/c$ and $p = dx/dz$. The dynamical system $(x(z),p(z))$ can be integrated for a known set of equation of state parameters for different matter/energy components. However, to avoid any preference for specific dark energy models, we adopt a cosmographic approach. We consider two scenarios where the Luminosity distance is expanded as Padé rational approximants using expansion in terms of $z$ and $(1+z)^{1/2}$ respectively. However, instead of directly using the Padé ratios to fit kinematic quantities with data, we adopt an alternative approach where the evolution of the cold dark matter sector is incorporated in our analysis through a semi-cosmographic equation of state, which is then, used to solve the dynamical problem in the phase space. The semi-cosmographic $(D_A(z), H(z))$, thus obtained, is fitted with BAO and SNIa data from DESI DR1, eBOSS and Pantheon+ respectively. We also consider a futuristic 21-cm intensity mapping experiment. We further use the semi-cosmographic fitting to reconstruct some diagnostics of background cosmology and compare our results for the two scenarios of Padé expansions.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we explore the link between star formation, turbulence and the thermal state of the multi-phase interstellar medium (ISM). We analyse a suite of stratified box simulations modelling a realistic ISM that aims to probe environments similar to those found in the Milky Way. Turbulence is injected through stellar feedback and an external large-scale driving force. We find that star formation can be either boosted or reduced when increasing the external driving strength, depending on the environment. When the density is sufficiently high, warm neutral gas naturally transitions to the cold phase, leading to high cold neutral medium (CNM) fractions of around 40\%. Under these conditions, excessive large-scale driving leads to a slight reduction of the CNM fraction and an increase in the amount of gas that is thermally unstable. What limits the star formation in this regime is a reduced fraction of dense gas due to additional turbulent support against collapse. For low density regions, overdensities in which cooling is efficient are much rarer and we find that star formation is regulated by the formation of cold gas. In such cases, turbulence can significantly boost star formation by compressing gas in shocks and increasing the CNM fraction dramatically. In our simulations we see an increase from almost no CNM to up to a fraction of 15 \% when including external turbulence driving; leading to an associated increase in the star formation rate. We provide a model to quantify this behaviour and predict the CNM fraction by combining the standard ISM cooling/heating model with the density PDF generated by turbulence. The change in the dominant limiting process for star formation between low- and intermediate-density environments provides a natural explanation for the observed break in the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation around column densities of 9\,\Msun\, pc$^{-2}$.

 - **Abstract**
 We measure the luminosity functions (LFs) and stellar mass functions (SMFs) of photometric satellite galaxies around spectroscopically identified isolated central galaxies (ICGs). The photometric satellites are from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys (DR9), while the spectroscopic ICGs are selected from the DESI Year-1 BGS sample. We can measure satellite LFs down to $r$-band absolute magnitudes of $M_{r,\mathrm{sat}}\sim-7$, around ICGs as small as $7.1<\log_{10}M_{\ast,\mathrm{ICG}}/\mathrm{M_\odot}<7.8$, with the stellar mass of ICGs measured by the DESI Fastspecfit pipeline. The satellite SMF can be measured down to $\log_{10}M_{\ast,\mathrm{sat}}/\mathrm{M_\odot}\sim 5.5$. Interestingly, we discover that the faint/low-mass end slopes of satellite LFs/SMFs become steeper with the decrease in the stellar masses of host ICGs, with smaller and nearby host ICGs capable of being used to probe their fainter satellites.. The steepest slopes are $-2.298\pm0.656$ and $-$2.888$\pm$0.916 for satellite LF and SMF, respectively. Detailed comparisons are performed between the satellite LFs around ICGs selected from DESI BGS or from the SDSS NYU-VAGC spectroscopic Main galaxies over $7.1<\log_{10}M_{\ast,\mathrm{ICG}}/\mathrm{M_\odot}<11.7$, showing reasonable agreements, but we show that the differences between DESI and SDSS stellar masses for ICGs play a role to affect the results. We also compare measurements based on DESI Fastspecfit and Cigale stellar masses used to bin ICGs, with the latter including the modeling of AGN based on WISE photometry, and we find good agreements in the measured satellite LFs by using either of the DESI stellar mass catalogs.

 - **Abstract**
 Previous studies have used magnetic energy and helicity spectra, the latter computed using the two-scale method, to search for signatures of mean-field dynamos. In this study, we compare cotemporal HMI and SOLIS magnetograms to illustrate the instrument-dependence of even qualitative features of the energy and helicity spectra. Around the minimum between solar cycles 24 and 25, we find that the magnetic energy spectrum computed from HMI observations exhibits two distinct peaks. One of these peaks is only present near the cycle minimum, and corresponds to large-scale magnetic fields at high latitudes. Nevertheless, such magnetic fields are not present in contemporaneous synoptic vector magnetograms from SOLIS. Further, even when magnetograms from both the instruments are apodized, the helicity spectra calculated using the two-scale method disagree (on both the sign and the value of the fractional helicity). This suggests that currently available synoptic magnetograms are not reliable enough for such studies.

 - **Abstract**
 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are some of the most luminous and extreme environments in the Universe. The central engines of AGN, believed to be super-massive black-holes, are fed by accretion discs threaded by magnetic fields within a dense magneto-ionic medium. We report our findings from polarimetric Very-long-baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations of quasar NRAO150 taken in October 2022 using a combined network of the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) and Effelsberg 100-m Radio Telescope. These observations are the first co-temporal multi-frequency polarimetric VLBI observations of NRAO150 at frequencies above 15GHz. We use the new VLBI polarization calibration procedure, GPCAL, with polarization observations of frequencies of 12GHz, 15GHz, 24GHz, and 43GHz of NRAO150. From these observations, we measure Faraday rotation. Using our measurement of Faraday rotation, we also derive the intrinsic electric vector position angle (EVPA0) for the source. As a complementary measurement we determine the behavior of polarization as a function of observed frequency. The polarization from NRAO150 only comes from the core region, with a peak polarization intensity occurring at 24GHz. Across the core region of NRAO150 we see clear gradients in Faraday rotation and EVPA0 values that are aligned with the direction of the jet curving around the core region. We find that for the majority of the polarized region the polarization fraction is greater at higher frequencies, with intrinsic polarization fractions in the core 3%. The Faraday rotation gradients and circular patterns in EVPA0 are strong evidence for a helical/toroidal magnetic field, and the presence of low intrinsic polarization fractions indicate that the polarized emission and hence the helical/toroidal magnetic field, occur within the innermost jet.

 - **Abstract**
 Utilizing Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) data and existing RR Lyrae stars (RRLs) catalogs, this study achieves the first calibration of the $P - \phi_{31} - R_{21} - \text{[Fe/H]}$ and $P-\phi_{31}-A_{2}-A_{1}-\text{[Fe/H]}$ relations in the ZTF photometric system for RRab and RRc stars. We also re-calibrate the period-absolute magnitude-metallicity (PMZ) and period-Wesenheit-metallicity (PWZ) relations in the ZTF $gri$-bands for RRab and RRc stars. Based on nearly 4100 stars with precise measurements of $P$, $\phi_{31}$, $A_{2}$, and $A_{1}$, and available spectroscopic-metallicity estimates, the photometric-metallicity relations exhibit strong internal consistency across different bands, supporting the use of a weighted averaging method for the final estimates. The photometric-metallicity estimates of globular clusters based on RR Lyrae members also show excellent agreement with high-resolution spectroscopic measurements, with typical scatter of 0.15 dex for RRab stars and 0.14 dex for RRc stars, respectively. Using hundreds of local RRLs with newly derived photometric metallicities and precise Gaia Data Release 3 parallaxes, we establish the PMZ and PWZ relations in multiple bands. Validation with globular cluster RR Lyrae members reveals typical distance errors of 3.1% and 3.0% for the PMZ relations, and 3.1% and 2.6% for the PWZ relations for RRab and RRc stars, respectively. Compared to PMZ relations, the PWZ relations are tighter and almost unbiased, making them the recommended choice for distance calculations. We present a catalog of 73,795 RRLs with precise photometric metallicities; over 95% of them have accurate distance measurements. Compared to Gaia DR3, approximately 25,000 RRLs have precise photometric metallicities and distances derived for the first time.

 - **Abstract**
 We employ a new way to measure the distance to NGC1052-DF2 via internal stellar velocity dispersions ($\sigma$) of its globular clusters (GCs). We obtained deep (15.1h), R=18,200, Ca Triplet integrated-light spectra for 10 GCs in NGC1052-DF2 using FLAMES GIRAFFE on VLT. For five GCs we measure $\sigma$, along with precision velocities for the whole sample. We also present a new photometric analysis based on 40 orbits of archival Hubble Space Telescope imaging for 16 spectroscopically confirmed GCs. Assuming that the NGC1052-DF2 GCs obey the $M_V$ -- log($\sigma$) relation followed by the Milky Way and M31 GCs, the NGC1052-DF2 GCs give a distance, $d=16.2\pm1.3$ (stat.) $\pm1.7$ (sys.) Mpc. By contrast, using a literature distance of $d=21.7$ Mpc from forward modelling of the TRGB, the GCs lie above the Milky Way + M31 relation by $\sim0.6$ magnitudes. For a shorter literature distance of 13 Mpc, the GCs fall below the relation by $\sim0.4$ mag. At $d = 16.2$ Mpc, we obtain mean dynamical $M/L_V = 1.61\pm0.44 M_\odot/L_\odot$, and median half-light radii, $r_h =3.0\pm0.5$ pc. This is entirely consistent with Milky Way GCs, with mean $M/L_V = 1.77\pm0.10 M_\odot/L_\odot$, median $r_h =3.2\pm0.6$ pc. For the further distance of 21.7 Mpc, we obtain low $M/L_V$ ratios ($M/L_V = 1.19\pm0.33 M_\odot/L_\odot$) which could suggest ages of $\sim6$ Gyr.. Such young ages are inconsistent with our MUSE stellar population (companion paper, Fahrion et al.) analysis of the NGC1052-DF2 GCs which indicates they are $\sim10$ Gyr old. For $d = 16.2$ Mpc, coupled with our new photometry, we find that the properties of the GCs in NGC1052-DF2 appear entirely consistent with those in the Milky Way and other Local Group galaxies. In order to reconcile the further distance with our results, a mass function more dwarf-depleted than the Milky Way GCs must be invoked for the GCs of NGC1052-DF2.

 - **Abstract**
 The ultra-diffuse galaxy (UDG) NGC1052-DF2 has captured the interest of astronomers ever since the low velocity dispersion measured from ten globular clusters (GCs) suggested a low dark matter fraction. Also, its GC system was found to be unusually bright, with a peak of the GC luminosity function at least one magnitude brighter than expected for a galaxy at a distance of 20 Mpc. In this work, we present an updated view of the GC system of NGC1052-DF2. We analysed archival MUSE data of NGC1052-DF2 to confirm the membership of four additional GCs based on their radial velocities, thereby raising the number of spectroscopically confirmed GCs to 16. We measured the ages and metallicities of eleven individual GCs, finding them to be old ($> 9$ Gyr) with a range of metallicities from [M/H] = $-0.7$ to $-1.8$ dex. The majority of GCs are found to be more metal-poor than the host galaxy, with some metal-rich GCs sharing the metallicity of the host ([M/H] = $-$1.09$^{+0.09}_{-0.07}$ dex). The host galaxy shows a flat age and metallicity gradient out to 1 $R_\text{e}$. Using a distance measurement based on the internal GC velocity dispersions ($D = 16.2$ Mpc; Beasley et al. 2025), we derived photometric GC masses and found that the peak of the GC mass function compares well with that of the Milky Way. From updated GC velocities, we estimated the GC system velocity dispersion of NGC1052-DF2 with a simple kinematic model and found $\sigma_\text{GCS} = 14.86^{+3.89}_{-2.83}$ km s$^{-1}$. However, this value is reduced to $\sigma_\text{GCS} = 8.63^{+2.88}_{-2.14}$ km s$^{-1}$, when the one GC that has the highest relative velocity based on a low S/N spectrum is considered as an interloper. We discuss the possible origin of NGC1502-DF2 considering the lower distance, spread of GC metallicities, flat stellar population profiles, and dynamical mass estimate.

 - **Abstract**
 The cosmic star formation history (CSFH) and cosmic active galactic nuclei (AGN) luminosity history (CAGNH) are self consistently presented at $z = 5.5-13.5$. This is achieved by analyzing galaxies detected by the James Webb Space Telescope from $\approx 400 \, \mathrm{arcmin^{2}}$ fields from the PEARLS, CEERS, NGDEEP, JADES and PRIMER surveys. In particular, the combination of spectral energy distribution fitting codes, EAZY and ProSpect, are employed to estimate the photometric redshifts and astrophysical quantities of 3947 distant galaxies, from which we compute the stellar mass, star formation rate and AGN luminosity distribution functions in four redshift bins. Integrating the distribution functions, we find that the CAGNH tentatively rises by $\approx 2.2$ dex over $z = 5.5-13.5$ compared to $\approx 1.8$ dex for the CSFH, indicating that the growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) tends to outpace the assembly of stellar mass. We connect our results of the CSFH and CAGNH at $z=5.5-13.5$ to that from $z= 0-5$ to determine the summary of $\gtrsim 13$ Gyr of star formation and AGN activity, from the very onset of galaxy formation to the present day.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents a quantitative analysis of the stellar content in the Local Group dwarf irregular galaxy NGC 6822 by comparing stellar evolution models and observations in color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) and color-color diagrams (CC-Ds). Our analysis is based on optical ground-based g,r,i photometry, and deep archive HST photometry of two fields in the galaxy disk. We compared young, intermediate-age, and old stellar populations with isochrones from the BaSTI-IAC library and found that NGC 6822 hosts a quite metal-rich ([Fe/H] = -0.7 to -0.4) young component with an age ranging from 20 to 100 Myr. The intermediate-age population experienced a modest chemical enrichment between 4 and 8 Gyr ago while stars older than 11 Gyr have a low metal abundance ([Fe/H] ~ -1.70). We also identified the AGB clump population with a luminosity peak at i ~ 23.35 mag. Our analysis of both the CMD and the optical-NIR-MIR CC-Ds of AGB oxygen- and carbon-rich stars, using the PARSEC+COLIBRI isochrones with and without circumstellar dust, reveal that this stellar component exhibits a spread in age from 1 to 2 Gyr and in metallicity between [Fe/H]=-1.30 and -1.70. The stellar models we used reproduce very well the two distinct color sequences defined by AGB O- and C-rich stars in the various optical-NIR-MIR CC-Ds, suggesting that they are reliable diagnostics to identify and characterise intermediate-age stellar populations. However, we also find that evolutionary prescriptions in the optical i-(r-i) CMDs predict, at fixed color, systematically lower luminosities than observed AGB stars.

 - **Abstract**
 We use the neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) observations of the edge-on galaxy UGCA 250, taken as part of the MeerKAT HI Observations of Nearby Galactic Objects - Observing Southern Emitters (MHONGOOSE) survey to investigate the amount, morphology, and kinematics of extraplanar gas. The combination of high column density sensitivity and high spatial resolution of the survey over a large field of view is ideal for studying the underlying physics governing the extraplanar gas. These data reveal 9 additional detections within the field of view along with UGCA 250, with 8 of them being within $\sim$ 200 km s$^{-1}$ of the galaxy's systemic velocity. The galaxy seems to have a tail-like feature extending away from it in the southern direction up to $\sim$ 41 kpc (in projection). We also detect a cloud at anomalous velocities, but we did not find any optical counterpart. We construct a detailed tilted ring model for this edge-on galaxy to gain a deeper understanding of the vertical structure of its neutral hydrogen. The model that best matches the data features a thick disc with a scale height of $\sim$ 3$\pm$1 kpc and an HI mass of about 15$\%$ of the total HI mass. This extraplanar gas is detected for the first time in UGCA 250. Our analysis favours a mixed origin for the extraplanar gas in UGCA 250, likely arising from a combination of internal stellar feedback and external tidal interactions.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic fields have an impact on galaxy evolution at multiple scales. They are particularly important for starburst galaxies, where they play a crucial role in shaping the interstellar medium (ISM), influencing star formation processes and interacting with galactic outflows. The primary aim of this study is to obtain a parsec scale map of dust polarisation and B-field structure within the central starburst region of NGC253. This includes examining the relationship between the morphology of B-fields, galactic outflows and the spatial distribution of super star clusters (SSC), to understand their combined effects on the galaxy's star formation and ISM. We used ALMA full polarisation data in Bands 4 (145 GHz) and 7 (345 GHz) with resolution of 25 and 5 pc scale, respectively. According to our SED fitting analysis, the observed Band 4 emission is a combination of dust, synchrotron and free-free, while Band 7 traces only dust. The polarisation fraction (PF) of the synchrotron component is 2%, while that of the dust component is 0.3%. The B-fields orientation maps in both bands at common resolution show that the same B-fields structure is traced by dust and synchrotron emission at scales of 25 pc. The B-field morphology suggests a coupling with the multiphase outflow, while the distribution of PF in Band 7 showed to be correlated with the presence of SSC. We observed a significant anti-correlation between polarisation fraction and column density in both Bands 4 and 7. A negative correlation between PF and dispersion angle function was observed in Band 4 but was nearly absent in Band 7 at native resolution, suggesting that the tangling of B-field geometry along the plane of the sky is the main cause of depolarisation at 25 pc scales, while other factors play a role at 5 pc scales.

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of He II emission in galaxies remains a debated topic, requiring ionizing photons with energies exceeding 54 eV. While massive stars, such as Wolf-Rayet stars, have been considered potential sources, their UV flux often fails to fully explain the observed He II emission. Recent studies suggest that X-ray binaries (XRBs) might contribute significantly to this ionization. We explore the relationship between X-ray and $\rm He~II \lambda4686$ emission in a statistically significant sample of galaxies, investigating whether X-ray sources, including active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and XRBs, serve as the primary mechanism for He II ionization across different galactic environments. We cross-matched a sample of known well-detected He II galaxies with the Chandra Source Catalog, yielding 165 galaxies with X-ray and $\rm He~II \lambda4686$ detections. The sources were classified into star-forming galaxies (SFGs) and AGNs based on the BPT diagram and a classification scheme defined for He II galaxies. We find a strong, linear correlation between X-ray and He II luminosity across AGNs and SFGs spanning over seven orders of magnitude. AGNs generally exhibit higher He II\H$\beta$ flux ratios, stronger extinction, and harder X-ray spectra. The O32 ratio of SFGs is tightly correlated with the H$\beta$ equivalent width ($\rm EW_{H\beta}$) but not with the He II/H$\beta$ ratio, suggesting a different excitation mechanism. We derive an O32--$\rm EW_{H\beta}$ line above which only AGNs of our sample reside. The tight correlation between X-ray and He II luminosity supports X-rays as the primary driver of He II excitation. While AGNs have one common ionization source, the central black hole, in SFGs low-energy species are mainly excited by UV emission related to star-forming activity, however, high-energy species like He II require the presence of XRBs.

 - **Abstract**
 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) significantly influence galaxy evolution. Specific sources such as obscured AGNs, especially Type II quasars (QSO2), still remain understudied. We characterise 366 QSO2 candidates in the redshift desert (median z~1.1) identified via machine learning from SDSS/WISE photometry, analysing their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and deriving their physical properties. Using CIGALE, we estimated star formation rate (SFR), stellar mass (M), AGN luminosity, and AGN fraction. We compared these with SPRITZ simulations and the literature, placing results in the galaxy evolution context. Our QSO2 candidates show diverse evolutionary stages. The SFR-M diagram reveals high-SFR sources above the main sequence, linking AGN activity to enhanced star formation. Quenched galaxies may indicate obscured star formation or AGN feedback. Additionally, the physical properties align with SPRITZ composite systems and AGN2, endorsing our obscured AGN classification. This study validates machine learning for identifying AGN-host galaxies, beyond traditional colour-colour selections. Diverse candidate properties highlight this method's ability to identify complex AGN systems. This advances our understanding of AGN-driven galaxy evolution with new target selection.

Here, we show that one of these objects, 2005 VL1, was at closest approach to Earth in November 1965 when the Venera 2 spacecraft was launched to explore Venus. The observed H magnitude of 2005 VL1 is consistent with a high reflectance from the full surface of Venera 2 including its Solar panels. As known for Venera 2, 2005 VL1 arrived within a short distance from Venus in February 1966, a highly improbable coincidence (< 1%) for the orbital phase of a near-Earth object that does not target a close approach to Venus. Indeed, 2005 VL1's orbital parameters are very similar to the reported values for Venera 2. Given the area-to-mass ratio of Venera 2, we show that 2005 VL1's non-gravitational acceleration and negligible transverse acceleration match the values expected from Solar radiation pressure.

 - **Abstract**
 Accretion from protoplanetary or debris disks can contaminate the stellar photosphere, which is detectable in stars with radiative envelopes due to relatively slower photospheric mixing. The contaminated photosphere reflects ongoing disk processes, detectable through stellar spectroscopy. We investigate the composition of six gas-rich debris disk-hosting A-type stars to understand possible links with their debris disk or earlier accretion stages. We used archival spectra to estimate the stellar parameters and abundances of our sample. We also estimated the stellar photospheric accretion contamination parameter, fph which indicates the fraction of accreting material on the stellar photosphere. The oxygen abundance in intermediate-mass stars decreases with age until the debris disk stage (< 20 Myr). The downward trend could result from H2O ice accumulating in dust traps or the formation of hydrated asteroids in the protoplanetary disk, locking oxygen in solids and reducing its accretion onto the star. All stars have similar volatile abundances (C, O), but HD 110058 and HD 32297 show refractory depleted abundances. The near-zero fph values in the six stars suggest that any currently accreted gas would not overwhelm mixing in the photosphere and would not impact the observed composition. The refractory depleted abundances in HD 110058 and HD 32297 suggest residual, or even chronic, accretion contamination from their earlier protoplanetary stages when the accretion rates were about five orders of magnitude higher. For HD 110058, with the highest refractory depletion, we estimated a lower limit on its earlier protoplanetary accretion rate of 9 x 10^(-8) Msun/yr, similar to other Herbig stars and equal to the Herbig star - HD 100546. This supports our hypothesis that refractory depletion in HD 110058 originates from a prior phase of higher accretion of dust-poor material.

 - **Abstract**
 The scale invariance of accretion processes (SIAP) is crucial for understanding the physical processes of black hole accretion systems at different scales. When applying this rule to high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (HFQPOs), there is an observation-theory confrontation in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). By compiling an updated X-ray HFQPO catalog, we found that the ultraluminous X-ray sources support the HFQPO models, similar to black hole X-ray binaries. More importantly, we identified two supermassive black hole (SMBH) sources (Sgr A and NGC 1365) with possible advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) configurations that support existing HFQPO models, even though many AGNs still do not. Furthermore, we report a new HFQPO candidate in NGC 5506. This source exhibits an accretion state similar to that of Sgr A* and NGC 1365, and it also supports the HFQPO models. Our results are consistent with previous numerical simulations and suggest that the accretion state of HFQPOs in SMBHs may differ from that of stellar-mass black holes (SBHs). To reconcile the sources that do not support the models, either a global general-relativistic HFQPO model based on magnetohydrodynamics needs to be considered, or the HFQPOs in these sources may originate from entirely different physical processes. This discovery significantly extends the SIAP rule to a broader scale, confirming that the paradigm of accretion scale invariance remains consistent from SBHs to SMBHs.

 - **Abstract**
 Prominences are cool overdensities of plasma supported by magnetic fields that levitate in the solar corona. The physical characterization of these structures is key for understanding the magnetic field in the corona. Our work attempts to shed light on the properties of prominences by using observations at high polarimetric sensitivity in the He I D3 multiplet taken with the Zurich Imaging Polarimeter-3 instrument at the Istituto ricerche solari Aldo e Cele Dacco observatory. We used the HAZEL inversion code to infer the thermodynamic and magnetic properties of an active region prominence, assuming one- and two-component models. Our observations unveil a great diversity of physical conditions in the prominence. The observed Stokes profiles are usually broad and show interesting features, which can be described assuming a two-component model. The contribution of each component and the trends inferred for some parameters vary with the distance to the solar limb. While both components have analogous properties and contribute similarly close to the limb, a major component mainly describes the properties inferred at 10-40 arcsecs away from the limb. Moreover, both components usually show significant differences in thermal broadening, which is essential for ensuring a good fit quality between observations and synthetic profiles. Summarizing, the observed region of the prominence shows line-of-sight velocities of 1-3 km/s and rather horizontal fields of 20-80 gauss. We also report hints of a twist close to a prominence foot and changes in the magnetic configuration at specific locations. Our results indicate a mainly horizontal magnetic field of a few tens of gauss in the prominence. A model of two components with different thermal broadenings and filling factors, depending on the limb distance, is crucial for providing a consistent solution across most of the observed prominence.
#### MaNGA AGN dwarf galaxies (MAD) -- III. The role of mergers and environment in AGN activity in dwarf galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 Investigating whether and how galaxy mergers affect black hole growth can be determinant for black hole-galaxy evolution models and, in particular, for understanding how early Universe seed black holes grew to become supermassive. However, while mergers have been observed to enhance the active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity, and thus black hole growth in massive galaxies, it is yet not known how this relation and the role of the environment translates to dwarf galaxies (the most likely hosts of the early seed black holes), since there are scarce and mixed results in the literature. We want to assess the impact of galaxy mergers and the environment on AGN triggering in dwarf galaxies. We use a sample of 3280 dwarf galaxies with integral-field spectroscopic data from the MaNGA survey to study the AGN fraction throughout the merger process and how it is affected by the environment (characterized by galaxy isolation, being in a void, and group richness). We also compare the fraction of interacting galaxies in AGN and non-AGN dwarf galaxies. We find that dwarf galaxy mergers can ignite AGNs at separations below 20 kpc. The AGN fraction increases notoriously after the first pass and remains enhanced until the final stage. Despite this, mergers are not the dominant AGN triggering mechanism. We also find that the environment has a non-negligible impact on AGN activity in dwarf galaxies, as the AGN fraction increases when moving to lower density environments. These findings provide the most statistically robust constraints to date on the effects of dwarf galaxy mergers and environment on AGN activity and black hole growth.
