#### Accretion-disk reflection in the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 3783 as viewed by Chandra grating spectroscopy

 - **Abstract**
 In active galactic nuclei, X-ray illumination of the accretion disk around a supermassive black hole (SMBH) results in the production of the K$\alpha$ fluorescent line of iron, which provides insights into accretion physics and SMBH spins. In this work, we studied X-ray reflection from the accretion disk in the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 3783 using all the data collected by the Chandra High Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer. We used hardness-ratio diagrams to distinguish between different spectral states and conducted spectral analysis of all the multi-epoch datasets, as well as the source in the observed spectral states. Our hardness analysis indicates that the source gradually evolved into a harder state (2013-2016) compared to the previous epochs (2000-2001). Our spectral modeling implies that the relativistically broadened iron emission from the innermost accretion disk is associated with a near-maximal SMBH spin ($a=0.98^{+0.02}_{-0.12}$) in all the datasets, even though the hard state was present in 17% of them, and a consistent spin is also found in different spectral states. In addition, the narrow, bright Fe K$\alpha$ line from distant regions has an excess velocity of $620^{+80}_{-70}$ km s$^{-1}$ relative to the rest frame, implying that some distant layers of the disk could be twisted. Our results suggest that, despite long-term changes in the X-ray brightness of NGC 3783, likely caused by eclipsing material, the relativistic reflection can be constrained thanks to the substantial counts provided by multi-epoch observations, while a warped disk structure may be present.

 - **Abstract**
 Weakly-collisional plasmas, such as the solar wind or the intra-cluster medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters, evolve in the presence of dynamically strong magnetic fields. The turbulent dynamo can amplify magnetic fields to such levels by converting turbulent kinetic energy into magnetic energy. While extensively studied in collisional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations, the weakly-collisional regime has only been explored recently. Here, we determine the properties of the weakly-collisional turbulent dynamo in the exponential ``kinematic" growth phase in both the subsonic and the previously unexplored supersonic regime of turbulence, using hybrid particle-in-cell (HPIC) and MHD simulations. We conduct a large parameter study, fixing the magnetic Reynolds number, Rm = 500, and the initial ratio of the magnetic to kinetic energy, $(E_{\rm{mag}}/E_{\rm{kin}})_{0} = 10^{-10}$, and then vary the kinetic Reynolds number, Re = 500, 50, and 5, for the MHD simulations. In the HPIC runs, only Rm = 500 is controlled, while Re emerges self-consistently from wave-particle interactions. We find that the velocity and magnetic field structures, probability distribution functions, and power spectra of the HPIC runs are similar to that of the MHD dynamo with Re ~ 50-500 and Re ~ 500 in the subsonic and supersonic regimes, respectively. Using MHD scaling relations, we infer $\text{Re}_{\rm inferred}=480^{+170}_{-250}$ and $690^{+360}_{-360}$ in the subsonic and supersonic weakly-collisional plasma, respectively. Overall, we find that the turbulent dynamo shares similar physical properties in both weakly-collisional and collisional plasmas. Our results of the weakly-collisional turbulent dynamo may have relevant applications to the solar wind, weakly-collisional shocks, and the hot ICM.

 - **Abstract**
 We report that the neutral hydrogen (HI) mass density of the Universe ($\rho_{HI}$) increases with cosmic time since $z \sim 5$, peaks at $z \sim 3$, and then decreases toward $z \sim 0$. This is the first result of Qz5, our spectroscopic survey of 63 quasars at $z \gtrsim 5$ with VLT/X-SHOOTER and Keck/ESI aimed at characterizing intervening HI gas absorbers at $z \sim 5$. The main feature of Qz5 is the high resolution ($R \sim 7000 - 9000$) of the spectra, which allows us to (1) accurately detect high column density HI gas absorbers in an increasingly neutral intergalactic medium at $z \sim 5$ and (2) determine the reliability of previous $\rho_{HI}$ measurements derived with lower resolution spectroscopy. We find 5 intervening Damped Ly$\alpha$ absorbers (DLAs) at $z > 4.5$, which corresponds to the lowest DLA incidence rate ($0.034^{0.05}_{0.02}$) at $z \gtrsim 2$. We also measure the lowest $\rho_{HI}$ at $z \gtrsim 2$ from our sample of DLAs and subDLAs, corresponding to $\rho_{HI} = 0.56^{0.82}_{0.31} \times 10^8~$M$_{\odot}~$Mpc$^{-3}$ at $z \sim 5$. Taking into account our measurements at $z \sim 5$ and systematic biases in the DLA detection rate at lower spectral resolutions, we conclude that $\rho_{HI}$ doubles from $z \sim 5$ to $z \sim 3$. From these results emerges a qualitative agreement between how the cosmic densities of HI gas mass, molecular gas mass, and star-formation rate build up with cosmic time.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic Voids are a promising probe of cosmology for spectroscopic galaxy surveys due to their unique response to cosmological parameters. Their combination with other probes promises to break parameter degeneracies. Due to simplifying assumptions, analytical models for void statistics are only representative of a subset of the full void population. We present a set of neural-based emulators for void summary statistics of watershed voids, which retain more information about the full void population than simplified analytical models. We build emulators for the void size function and void density profiles traced by the halo number density using the Quijote suite of simulations for a broad range of the $\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$ parameter space. The emulators replace the computation of these statistics from computationally expensive cosmological simulations. We demonstrate the cosmological constraining power of voids using our emulators, which offer orders-of-magnitude acceleration in parameter estimation, capture more cosmological information compared to analytic models, and produce more realistic posteriors compared to Fisher forecasts. We find that the parameters $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$ in this Quijote setup can be recovered to $14.4\%$ and $8.4\%$ accuracy respectively using void density profiles; including the additional information in the void size function improves the accuracy on $\sigma_8$ to $6.8\%$. We demonstrate the robustness of our approach to two important variables in the underlying simulations, the resolution, and the inclusion of baryons. We find that our pipeline is robust to variations in resolution, and we show that the posteriors derived from the emulated void statistics are unaffected by the inclusion of baryons with the Magneticum hydrodynamic simulations. This opens up the possibility of a baryon-independent probe of the large-scale structure.

 - **Abstract**
 High-velocity stellar collisions in galactic nuclei produce ejecta that generate potentially observable electromagnetic radiation, making them promising nuclear transients. However, the photometric and spectroscopic properties of these collisions, which would more frequently involve main-sequence stars, remain largely unexplored. Here, using 3D hydrodynamics and 1D radiation-transfer simulations, we investigate the properties and observables of the debris produced in high-velocity collisions between terminal-age main-sequence stars, covering a wide range of collision configurations. The ejecta produce bright UV flares with bolometric luminosities typically peaking at $\gtrsim10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$, declining steeply as $t^{-2}-t^{-4}$ to reach $\gtrsim10^{41}-10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at 0.5\,d, and leveling off on a plateau at $10^{39}-10^{41.5}$ erg s$^{-1}$ ($M_V$ between $-$10 to $-$15\,mag) after a few days. Their spectra evolve considerably during the first few days, morphing from UV- to optical-dominated. The UV range shows numerous resonance transitions from metals like C, N, and O, whereas the optical primarily shows H{\,\sc i}\ Balmer lines. These properties are qualitatively similar to those observed, as well as obtained in models of Type II supernovae. Observables from these events exhibit clear correlations with collision configurations, including impact parameter, relative velocity, and stellar masses. We provide fitting formulae to describe these correlations. Detecting these flares requires sub-day cadence surveys such as ULTRASAT, combined with spectroscopic observations to disentangle degeneracies and infer collision characteristics.

 - **Abstract**
 Synergies between the {\em James Webb Space Telescope} ({\em JWST}) and the {\em Chandra} X-ray observatory have advanced the observational frontier by detecting a handful of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) beyond $z \sim$ 10. In particular, the recent discovery of a candidate $\rm 8 \times 10^7~M_{\odot}$ black hole (BH) in the galaxy GHZ9 at $z =$ 10.4 favors massive seed formation channels for these objects. Motivated by prospects for their detection in radio by recent studies, we estimate radio fluxes for GHZ9 and explore the possibility of their detection with the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) and next-generation Very Large Array (ngVLA). We find that ngVLA should be able to detect radio emission from GHZ9 for integration times as short as 1 hr while SKA will require integration times of up to 100 hr. We also find that radio emission from the BH can be distinguished from that due to H II regions and supernovae in its host galaxy. The detection of a few hundred nJy radio signal at frequencies $> 2$ GHz will be a smoking gun for the presence of a BH in GHZ9.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent radiation-thermochemical-magnetohydrodynamic simulations resolved formation of quasar accretion disks from cosmological scales down to ~300 gravitational radii $R_{g}$, arguing they were 'hyper-magnetized' (plasma $\beta\ll1$ supported by toroidal magnetic fields) and distinct from traditional $\alpha$-disks. We extend these, refining to $\approx 3\,R_{g}$ around a $10^{7}\,{\rm M_{\odot}}$ BH with multi-channel radiation and thermochemistry, and exploring a factor of 1000 range of accretion rates ($\dot{m}\sim0.01-20$). At smaller scales, we see the disks maintain steady accretion, thermalize and self-ionize, and radiation pressure grows in importance, but large deviations from local thermodynamic equilibrium and single-phase equations of state are always present. Trans-Alfvenic and highly-supersonic turbulence persists in all cases, and leads to efficient vertical mixing, so radiation pressure saturates at levels comparable to fluctuating magnetic and turbulent pressures even for $\dot{m}\gg1$. The disks also become radiatively inefficient in the inner regions at high $\dot{m}$. The midplane magnetic field remains primarily toroidal at large radii, but at super-Eddington $\dot{m}$ we see occasional transitions to a poloidal-field dominated state associated with outflows and flares. Large-scale magnetocentrifugal and continuum radiation-pressure-driven outflows are weak at $\dot{m}<1$, but can be strong at $\dot{m}\gtrsim1$. In all cases there is a scattering photosphere above the disk extending to $\gtrsim 1000\,R_{g}$ at large $\dot{m}$, and the disk is thick and flared owing to magnetic support (with $H/R$ nearly independent of $\dot{m}$), so the outer disk is strongly illuminated by the inner disk and most of the inner disk continuum scatters or is reprocessed at larger scales, giving apparent emission region sizes as large as $\gtrsim 10^{16}\,{\rm cm}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Galactic outflows driven by rapidly-accreting quasars at high redshift are widely expected to play a key role in the short- and long-term future evolution of their host galaxies. Using new and archival ALMA data, we observed the OH 119um doublet lines in order to search for cold molecular outflows in a sample of 11 unobscured, IR-luminous quasars at z>6. This represents the first survey for molecular winds in reionization-era quasars, and we detect unambiguous outflows in 8/11 (73%) of the quasars. The outflows we find are substantially faster, by ~300km/s on average, than outflows observed in a roughly co-eval sample of non-quasar IR-luminous galaxies, suggesting that the AGN drive the winds to higher velocities. On the other hand, the implied molecular outflow rates are relatively modest given the high luminosities, suggesting typical mass loading factors ~0.5 in the cold gas. The outflows are consistent with expectations for momentum-driven winds regardless of the driving source, but the kinetic energy in the outflows suggests that the AGN must be at least partially responsible for driving the winds. Accordingly, we find trends between the outflow properties and the Eddington ratio of the black hole accretion, though this may be linked to the underlying trend with AGN luminosity. We find that the kinetic power carried in the cold outflow phase is typically only ~0.1% of the total AGN luminosity. Our study provides evidence in favor of AGN feedback on the cold molecular gas in $z>6$ quasar host galaxies, demonstrating that cold outflows are very common and powerful in the most extreme reionization-era quasars.

 - **Abstract**
 In galaxy mergers, dual quasars - two actively accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) - provide a unique opportunity to study the interplay between galaxy dynamics and quasar activity. However, very little is known about their molecular gas, which fuels star formation and quasar activity. In this study, we map the kinematics of the cold molecular gas in J0749+2255, a 3.8 kpc separation dual quasar at z=2.17 using the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) Band 4. We detect CO(4-3)650um, which shows remarkably complex morphological and kinematic structures. While the integrated CO map suggested a lens-like ring, this feature disappears with kinematic decomposition. The kinematic analysis with ALMA resolves the ambiguities introduced by previous observations, further supporting the dual quasar interpretation of J0749+2255. We find two kinematically distinct molecular gas components: spatially extended, yet dynamically complex slow-moving gas (FWHM~130 km/s), and a compact, blueshifted, fast-moving, turbulent gas (FWHM~300 km/s). The disturbed kinematics, likely driven by the merger, show hints of rotation but no molecular outflows, suggesting circumnuclear flows. We estimate a large molecular gas reservoir ($M_{H2}\sim10^{10} M_{\odot}$), yet the starburst activity appears to exceed the available fuel. We detect an extended continuum in excess at rest-frame 455 GHz. The kinematic complexity of CO implicates the connection of mergers on the starburst and quasar activity in J0749+2255, yet whether J0749+2255 represents the dual quasar population remains unclear. Targeted kinematic studies of larger dual quasar samples will be essential to disentangling the nature of dual quasars.
#### The Type Ia Supernova and AGB-Regulated Interstellar Medium of Massive Galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 Observations and theory suggest that Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) heating and mass loss from asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars play a crucial role in the interstellar medium (ISM) of massive galaxies. We perform 3D hydrodynamic simulations of the central few kiloparsecs of massive galaxies, including radiative cooling and mass and energy injection from AGB winds and SNIa (resolving each SNIa remnant, a few $\times10~\mathrm{pc}$ in size), excluding black hole feedback. We study systems with different initial core thermodynamic profiles, focusing on NGC 1399. Our simulations reproduce its observed density and entropy profiles well. Over $100~\mathrm{Myr}$, two steady-state profiles emerge, depending on the inner circumgalactic medium (CGM) pressure and the ratio of Ia heating to cooling: (i) if SNIa heating is less than cooling, a cooling flow develops; (ii) if SNIa heating is comparable to or exceeds cooling, SNIa heating drives a slow subsonic outflow of AGB ejecta, with black hole accretion at small radii. This outflow, pressure-confined by the CGM, adapts the ISM to the CGM properties: a low entropy CGM results in a dense, low entropy ISM with higher black hole accretion, while a high entropy CGM leads to a less dense, high entropy ISM with lower accretion. This suggests that the AGB-SNIa regulated ISM connects CGM and galaxy scales, potentially influencing black hole feedback in massive halos. Approximate methods of modeling Ia heating, such as clustered SNIa and smoothly distributed heating, produce unrealistic ISM profiles over $100~\mathrm{Myr}$, highlighting the importance of resolving SNIa in simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 Deep generative models have shown immense potential in generating unseen data that has properties of real data. These models learn complex data-generating distributions starting from a smaller set of latent dimensions. However, generative models have encountered great skepticism in scientific domains due to the disconnection between generative latent vectors and scientifically relevant quantities. In this study, we integrate three types of machine learning models to generate solar magnetic patches in a physically interpretable manner and use those as a query to find matching patches in real observations. We use the magnetic field measurements from Space-weather HMI Active Region Patches (SHARPs) to train a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). We connect the physical properties of GAN-generated images with their latent vectors to train Support Vector Machines (SVMs) that do mapping between physical and latent spaces. These produce directions in the GAN latent space along which known physical parameters of the SHARPs change. We train a self-supervised learner (SSL) to make queries with generated images and find matches from real data. We find that the GAN-SVM combination enables users to produce high-quality patches that change smoothly only with a prescribed physical quantity, making generative models physically interpretable. We also show that GAN outputs can be used to retrieve real data that shares the same physical properties as the generated query. This elevates Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) from a means-to-produce artificial data to a novel tool for scientific data interrogation, supporting its applicability beyond the domain of heliophysics.
#### Neutrinos from Carbon-Burning Red Supergiants and Their Detectability

 - **Abstract**
 Stars emit MeV neutrinos during their evolution via nuclear syntheses and thermal processes, and detecting them could provide insights into stellar structure beyond what is accessible through electromagnetic wave observations. So far, MeV neutrinos have been observed from the Sun and SN 1987A. It has been suggested that pre-supernova stars in the oxygen and silicon burning stages would emit enough MeV neutrinos to be detectable on Earth, provided they are in the local universe. In this study, we investigate the prospect of detecting neutrinos from red supergiants (RSGs) in the carbon-burning phase. In our Galaxy, around a thousand RSGs have been cataloged, and several are expected to be in the carbon-burning phase. We first calculate the luminosity and energy spectrum of neutrinos emitted during the post-main-sequence evolution of massive stars. For a nearby carbon-burning RSG located $\sim200$ pc away, we estimate the neutrino flux reaching Earth to be as large as $\sim10^5$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ with a spectrum peaking $\sim0.6$ MeV. We then assess the feasibility of detecting these neutrinos in underground facilities, particularly in hybrid detectors equipped with water-based liquid scintillator and ultra-fast photodetectors. In detectors with a volume comparable to Super-Kamiokande, for the above flux, we anticipate up to $\sim50$ neutrino events per year with directional information. Although this is a fair number, the number of events from radioactive backgrounds would be much larger. Our results indicate that studying neutrinos from carbon-burning RSGs and predicting supernovae well in advance before their explosion would be challenging with currently available detector technologies.
#### A new class of dark matter-free dwarf galaxies? I. Clues from FCC 224, NGC 1052-DF2 and NGC 1052-DF4

 - **Abstract**
 The discovery of quiescent, dark matter (DM)-deficient ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) with overluminous globular clusters (GCs) has challenged galaxy formation models within the Lambda Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmological paradigm. Previously, such galaxies were only identified in the NGC 1052 group, raising the possibility that they are the result of unique, group-specific processes, and limiting their broader significance. The recent identification of FCC 224, a putative DM-deficient UDG on the outskirts of the Fornax Cluster, suggests that such galaxies are not confined to the NGC 1052 group but rather represent a broader phenomenon. We aim to investigate the DM content of FCC 224 and to explore its similarities to the DM-free dwarfs in the NGC 1052 group, DF2 and DF4, to determine whether or not it belongs to the same class of DM-deficient UDGs. We use high-resolution Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI) spectroscopy to study the kinematics, stellar populations, and GC system of FCC 224, enabling direct comparisons with DF2 and DF4. We find that FCC 224 is also DM-deficient and exhibits a distinct set of traits shared with DF2 and DF4, including slow and prolate rotation, quiescence in low-density environments, coeval formation of stars and GCs, flat stellar population gradients, a top-heavy GC luminosity function, and monochromatic GCs. These shared characteristics signal the existence of a previously unrecognized class of DM-deficient dwarf galaxies. This diagnostic framework provides a means of identifying additional examples and raises new questions for galaxy formation models within $\Lambda$CDM cosmology.

 - **Abstract**
 The filamentary nebula encompassing the central galaxy of the Perseus Cluster, NGC 1275, is a complex structure extending dozens of kiloparsecs from NGC 1275. Decades of previous works have focused on establishing the primary formation and ionization mechanisms in different filaments. These studies have pointed to a lack of star formation in the majority of the filaments, the importance of magnetic fields and turbulence in several regions, and the role of interactions between the intercluster medium (ICM) and the cool gas in the filaments, as well as the role of interaction between the central radio source, 3C84, and the filaments. In this paper, we present multi-filter observations of the entire filamentary system that cover the optical bandpass, using the SITELLE instrument at the Canada-France-Hawai'i Telescope. Here, we use the data analysis software, \href{this https URL}{\texttt{LUCI}}, to produce flux maps of the prominent emission lines present in the filters: \oii{}$\lambda$3726/3729, \oiii{}$\lambda$5007, H$\beta$, \nii{}$\lambda$6548, \nii{}$\lambda$6583, and H$\alpha$. We use these maps to produce BPT and WHAN diagrams to study the ionization mechanisms at play in each distinct region of the filamentary nebula. First, we confirm the absence of \oiii{}$\lambda$5007 in the extended filaments, although we detect this line in the central core, revealing a compact region where photoionization by the AGN might affect local conditions. Our findings corroborate previous claims that the ionization in the extended filaments could be caused by the cooling ICM via collisional excitation and/or mixing. Moreover, they support the conclusion that magnetic fields play an important role in the formation and continued existence of the filaments.
#### Testing the cosmic distance duality relation using Type Ia supernovae and BAO observations

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we propose to utilize the observed ratio of spherically-averaged distance to the sound horizon scale from Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data to test the cosmic distance duality relation (CDDR) by comparing the luminosity distances (LDs) obtained from Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) observations with angular diameter distances (ADDs) derived from these ratio measurements, using a cosmological-model-independent method. To match the LDs with the ADDs at the identical redshifts, we employ two methods: a compressed form of the Pantheon sample and a hybrid approach that combines the binning method with an artificial neural network (ANN). The Hubble parameter $H(z)$ at any redshift is reconstructed from the observed Hubble parameter data with the ANN to derive the ADD. To avoid potential biases resulted from the specific prior values of the absolute magnitude $M_{\rm B}$ of SNIa and the sound horizon scale $r_{\rm d}$ from BAO measurements, we introduce the fiducial parameter $\kappa\equiv10^{M_{\rm B} \over 5}\, r_{\rm d}^{3 \over 2} $ and marginalize their impacts by treating them as nuisance parameters with flat prior distributions in our statistical analysis. Subsequently, we update the measurements of ratio of the transverse comoving distance to the sound horizon scale from the latest BAO data released by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration for CDDR testing. Our results indicate that BAO observation provides a powerful tool for testing the CDDR, independent of both the absolute magnitude $M_{\rm B}$ and sound horizon scale $r_{\rm d}$, as well as any cosmological model.

 - **Abstract**
 Quasars behind the Galactic plane (GPQs) are excellent tracers to probe the chemistry and kinematics of the interstellar/intergalactic medium (ISM/IGM) of the Milky Way along sight lines via absorption line spectroscopy. Moreover, the quasars located at low Galactic latitudes will fill the gap in the spatial distribution of known quasars near the Galactic plane, and can be used to construct an astrometric reference frame for accurate measurements of proper motions (PMs) of stars, and substructures of the Milky Way. We started a survey of background quasars in the low Galactic latitude region since the LAMOST phase II survey in 2017. Quasar candidates have been selected from the optical and infrared photometric data of Pan-STARRS1 and WISE surveys based on their variability and color properties. In this paper, we present a sample of 1982 spectroscopically confirmed GPQs with |b| <= 20 degree based on LAMOST Data Release 10 (DR10). Among them, 1338 are newly discovered. Most GPQs are located around 240<l<90 degree, and the spatial distributions are non-uniform. These GPQs have a magnitude distribution with a peak at i-mag 19.0, and mostly around 18.0-19.5mag. The peak of redshift distributions is around ~1.5, and most GPQs have redshifts between 0.3 and 2.5. Our finding demonstrates the potential discovery space for the GPQs from the spectroscopic surveys and the promising applications for future research.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: 3C 273, a well-studied active galactic nucleus (AGN), displays characteristics of both jetted-AGN and Seyfert galaxies, making it an excellent source to study the disc-jet connection in AGN. Aims: To investigate the disk-jet scenario in 3C 273 using broadband (0.3--78 keV) X-ray spectra from {\it XMM-Newton} and {\it NuSTAR}. Methods: We used simultaneous {\it XMM-Newton} and {\it NuSTAR} observations of 3C 273 carried out between 2012 and 2024. The 0.3--78 keV X-ray spectra were first fit with a simple power-law (PL) and then with the accretion-ejection-based JeTCAF model. The JeTCAF model accounts for emission from the jet, extending up to the sonic surface. In this framework, a reflection hump above 10 keV can also arise due to the bulk motion Comptonization of coronal photons by the jet. Results: We found that the simple PL did not provide a good fit, leaving significant residuals at energies below 1.5 keV. All the spectra were fitted well by the JeTCAF model. The weighted-averaged black hole mass of (7.77$\pm$0.30) $\times 10^8 M_\odot$ obtained from the JeTCAF model is comparable with the previous estimates based on reverberation mapping observations and accretion disk models. Conclusions: The 0.3--78 keV X-ray emission of 3C 273 can be fit by the accretion-ejection-based model in which the corona and the jet on top of it make significant contributions to the X-ray flux. The Doppler boosting factor estimated from the jet flux ranges from 1.6 to 2.2, consistent with the lower limit from the literature.

 - **Abstract**
 The selection of candidate high-redshift galaxies using the dropout technique targeting the Lyman-break signature sometimes results in very bright objects, which would be too luminous to be easily explained if they are indeed at the expected redshifts. Here we present a systematic study of very bright dropouts selected through successive bands of the NIRCam instrument onboard the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Using the public NIRCam data in four blank fields over 500~arcmin$^2$, 300 such objects were found. They have magnitudes in F356W $<25.1$~mag or $<26.0$~mag depending on the dropout passband, and the vast majority of them ($>80\%$) have very red F115W$-$F356W colors $> 2.0$~mag, which make them qualify as ``extremely red objects'' (EROs). We focus on the 137 objects that also have mid-IR observations from the JWST MIRI instrument. The analysis of their spectral energy distributions shows that these very bright dropouts are dominated by low-redshift ($z\sim 1$--4) galaxies ($\gtrsim 67\%$). However, a non-negligible fraction ($\gtrsim 7\%$) could be at high redshifts. Seven of our objects have secure spectroscopic redshifts from the JWST NIRSpec identifications, and the results confirm this picture: while six are low-redshift galaxies at $z\approx 3$, one is a known galaxy at $z=8.679$ recovered in our sample. If more objects from our sample are confirmed to be at high redshifts, they could pose a severe challenge in explaining their properties, such as the extremely high star formation rates and stellar masses.

 - **Abstract**
 The Milky Way's disk-halo interface mediates energy and mass exchange between the interstellar thin disk and the halo. In the first detailed study of the Perseus arm's disk-halo interface, we combine HST/STIS and COS absorption spectra toward 6 stars and 23 AGNs projected behind a narrow section (95 degree < l <145 degree, -46 degree < b <0 degree), providing a unique dataset that bridges the disk and its extended vertical structure in these directions. We detect S II, Si IV, and C IV absorption, along with HI 21 cm emission, within -70 pc to -3.3 kpc from the mid-plane. The arm's southern vertical structure exhibits complexity beyond simple exponential scaling: HI and S II column densities sharply decline with height up to 1.5 kpc before flattening, while high ion (Si IV and C IV) column densities remain relatively constant. In this region, where warm neutral medium (WNM) dominates, S II and the high ions show similar kinematics, and we find a remarkably uniform CIV/SiIV ratio (<C IV/Si IV> = 2.5 pm 0.5) within -0.9 to -3.25 kpc. Both the kinematic correspondence and high-ion ratio are consistent with the high ions probing turbulent mixing layers at the interfaces between warm/cool and hot gas phases. AGN sightlines reveal minimal circumgalactic medium (CGM) contribution in the low-velocity gas at |v_{LSR}|< 100 km/s, suggesting the observed properties may be attributed to previous fountain activity.

 - **Abstract**
 We report ALMA and ACA observations of atomic carbon ([\ion{C}{1}]$(1-0)$) and dust continuum in 10 Enormous Ly$\alpha$ Nebulae hosting ultra-luminous Type-I QSOs at $z=2.2-2.5$, as part of the SUrvey of Protocluster ELANe Revealing CO/CI in the Ly$\alpha$ Detected CGM (SUPERCOLD-CGM). We detect [\ion{C}{1}]$(1-0)$ and dust in all ten QSOs and five companion galaxies. We find that the QSOs and companions have higher gas densities and more intense radiation fields than Luminous Infrared galaxies and high-$z$ main sequence galaxies, with the highest values found in the QSOs. By comparing molecular gas masses derived from [\ion{C}{1}]$(1-0)$, CO(4$-$3) and dust continuum, we find that the QSOs and companions display a similar low CO conversion factor of $\alpha_{\rm CO}$\,$\sim$\,0.8 $\rm M_{\sun}$${[\rm K\,km/s\,pc^2]}^{-1}$. After tapering our data to low resolution, the [\ion{C}{1}]$(1-0)$ flux increases for nine QSOs, hinting at the possibility of [\ion{C}{1}]$(1-0)$ in the circum-galactic medium (CGM) on a scale of 16$-$40 kpc. However, the [\ion{C}{1}]$(1-0)$ sensitivity is too low to confirm this for individual targets, except for a tentative (2.7$\sigma$) CGM detection in Q0050+0051{} with M$_{\rm H_2}$\,=\, ($1.0 - 2.8$)$\times 10^{10}$ $\rm M_{\sun}$. The 3$\sigma$ mass limits of molecular CGM for the remaining QSO fields are ($0.2-1.4$)\,$\times$\,10$^{10}$ $\rm M_{\sun}$. This translates into a baryon fraction of $<$0.4-3$\% $ in the molecular CGM relative to the total baryonic halo mass. Our sample also includes a radio-detected AGN, Q1416+2649{}, which shows [\ion{C}{1}]$(1-0)$ and CO(4$-$3) luminosities an order of magnitude fainter for its far-infrared luminosity than other QSOs in our sample, possibly due to a lower molecular gas mass.

 - **Abstract**
 Hot Dust-Obscured Galaxies (Hot DOGs), discovered by the "W1W2 dropout" selection at high redshifts ($z\sim$ 2-4), are a rare population of hyper-luminous obscured quasars. Their number density is comparable to similarly luminous type 1 quasars in the same redshift range, potentially representing a short, yet critical stage in galaxy evolution. The evolution in their number density towards low redshift, however, remains unclear as their selection function is heavily biased against objects at $z\lesssim2$. We combine data from the WISE and Herschel archives to search for Hot DOGs at $z<0.5$ based on their unique spectral energy distributions. We find 68 candidates, and spectroscopic observations confirm that 3 of them are at $z<0.5$. For those 3 we find their black hole accretion is close to the Eddington limit, with lower bolometric luminosities and black hole masses than those of higher-$z$ Hot DOGs. Compared to high-$z$ systems, these low-$z$ systems are closer to the local relation between host galaxy stellar mass and black hole mass but still lie above it, and we discuss several possible scenarios for it. Finally, we also find the surface number density of $z<$0.5 Hot DOGs is $\rm 2.4 \times 10^{-3}$ deg$^{-2}$, about an order of magnitude lower than high-$z$ Hot DOGs but comparable to hyper-luminous unobscured quasars in the same redshift range. These results further support the idea that Hot DOGs may be a transitional phase of galaxy evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 [abridged] The $\eta$CDM framework is a new cosmological model aimed to cure some drawbacks of the standard $\Lambda$CDM scenario, such as the origin of the accelerated expansion at late times, the cosmic tensions, and the violation of the cosmological principle due to the progressive development of inhomogeneous/anisotropic conditions in the Universe during structure formation. To this purpose, the model adopts a statistical perspective envisaging a stochastic evolution of large-scale patches in the Universe with typical sizes $10-50\, h^{-1}$ Mpc, which is meant to describe the complex gravitational processes leading to the formation of the cosmic web. The stochasticity among different patches is technically rendered via the diverse realizations of a multiplicative noise term (`a little ado') in the cosmological equations, and the overall background evolution of the Universe is then operationally defined as an average over the patch ensemble. In this paper we show that such an ensemble-averaged evolution in $\eta$CDM can be described in terms of a spatially flat cosmology and of an `emergent' dark energy with a time-dependent equation of state, able to originate the cosmic acceleration with the right timing and to solve the coincidence problem. Then we test the $\eta$CDM model against the most recent supernova type-I$a$, baryon acoustic oscillations and structure growth rate datasets, finding an excellent agreement. Remarkably, we demonstrate that $\eta$CDM is able to alleviate simultaneously both the $H_0$ and the $f\sigma_8$ tensions. Finally, we discuss that the Linders' diagnostic test could be helpful to better distinguish $\eta$CDM from the standard scenario in the near future via upcoming galaxy redshift surveys at intermediate redshifts such as those being conducted by the Euclid mission.

 We present a dedicated automated pipeline to construct spatially resolved emission H$\alpha$+[NII] maps and to derive the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) in 12 optical filters (five broad and seven narrow/medium) of H$\alpha$ emission line regions in nearby galaxies (z $<$ 0.0165) observed by the Javalambre Photometric Local Universe Survey (J-PLUS). We used the $J0660$ filter of $140$Å width centered at $6600$Å to trace H$\alpha$ + [NII] emission and $r$ and $i$ broad bands were used to estimate the stellar continuum. We create pure emission line images after the continnum subtraction, where the H$\alpha$ emission line regions were detected. This method was also applied to Integral Field Unit (IFU) spectroscopic data from PHANGS-MUSE, CALIFA and MaNGA surveys by building synthetic narrow-bands based on J-PLUS filters. The studied sample includes the cross-matched catalog of these IFU surveys with J-PLUS third data release (DR3), amounting to $2$ PHANGS-MUSE, $78$ CALIFA, and $78$ MaNGA galaxies at $z < 0.0165$, respectively. We compared the H$\alpha$+[NII] radial profiles from J-PLUS and the IFU surveys, finding good agreement within the expected uncertainties. We also compared the SEDs from the emission line regions detected in J-PLUS images, reproducing the main spectral features present in the spectroscopic data. Finally, we compared the emission fluxes from the J-PLUS and IFU surveys accounting for scale differences, finding a difference of only 2% with a dispersion of 7% in the measurements. The J-PLUS data provides reliable spatially resolved H$\alpha$+[NII] emission maps for nearby galaxies. We provide the J-PLUS DR3 catalog for the $158$ galaxies with IFU data, including emission maps, SEDs of star-forming clumps, and radial profiles.

 GDL, a free interpreter for the IDL language, continues to develop smoothly, driven by feedback and requests from an increasingly active and growing user base, especially since GDL was made available on GitHub. Among the most notable features introduced in recent years are stable Widgets; extensive testing on M1, M2, and M3 processors; excellent computational performance (including OpenMP support) demonstrated across a comprehensive benchmark; simplified compilation and installation processes; and the availability of SHMMAP and Bridge functions, which enable concurrent GDL runs on shared RAM in HPC environments. As developers of GDL, we believe this language holds a valuable place in today's world, where efficiency and low-power computing are essential. GDL (not to mention IDL), written in C/C++, demonstrates exceptional efficiency in "real-world" benchmarks, making it one of the few interpreted languages that can truly be considered "green." Moreover, it is likely the only interpreter accompanied by a vast collection of free, well-tested, and proven astronomical procedures developed by colleagues over the years. GDL also stands out for its suitability for long-term projects, thanks to its stable and reliable syntax.

 - **Abstract**
 In protoplanetary disks around young stars, magnetic fields play an important role for disk evolution and planet formation. Polarized thermal emission from magnetically aligned grains is one of the reliable methods to trace magnetic fields. However, it has been difficult to observe magnetic fields from dust polarization in protoplanetary disks because other polarization mechanisms involving grown dust grains become efficient. Here, we report multi-wavelength (0.87 mm, 1.3 mm, 2.1 mm, and 2.7 mm) observations of polarized thermal emission in the protoplanetary disk around HD 142527, showing the lopsided dust distribution. We revealed that the smaller dust still exhibits magnetic alignment in the southern part of the disk. Furthermore, angular offsets between the observed magnetic field and the disk azimuthal direction were discovered, which can be used as a method to measure the relative strengths of each component (radial ($B_r$), azimuthal ($B_\phi$), and vertical ($B_z$)) of 3D magnetic field. Applying this method, we derived the magnetic field around a 200-au radius from the protostar as $|B_r |:|B_\phi |:|B_z | \sim 0.26:1:0.23$ and a strength of $\sim 0.3$ milli-Gauss. Our observations provide some key parameters of magnetic activities including the plasma beta, which have only been assumed in theoretical studies. In addition, the radial and vertical angular momentum transfer are found to be comparable, which poses a challenge to theoretical studies of protoplanetary disks.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the generation and development of the continuous outflow from the Sun requires tracing the physical conditions from deep in the corona to the heliosphere. Detailed global observations of plasma state variables and the magnetic field are needed to provide critical constraints to the underlying physics driving models of the corona and solar wind. Key diagnostics of the solar wind require measurements at its formation site and during its outflow to continuously track it across rapidly changing regions of space. A unified view of the solar wind is only possible through coordinated remote and in situ observations that probe these different regions. Here, we discuss current observational coverage and gaps of different plasma properties and review recent coordinated studies. We highlight how these efforts may become more routine with the launch of upcoming and planned missions.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of spectroscopic observations of host galaxies of eleven candidate giant radio galaxies (GRGs), powered by active galactic nuclei (AGNs), conducted with the 2-m Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT). The primary aim of these observations, performed with the Hanle Faint Object Spectrograph Camera (HFOSC), was to secure accurate spectroscopic redshifts, enabling precise calculations of their projected linear sizes. Based on these measurements, we confirm all eleven sources as giants, with linear sizes ranging from 0.7 to 2.9 Mpc, including ten GRGs and one giant radio quasar (GRQ). One of the GRGs shows evidence of a potential AGN jet-driven ionized outflow, extending up to $\sim$12 kpc, which, if confirmed, would represent a rarely observed feature. Two of the confirmed GRGs exceed 2 Mpc in size, which are relatively rare examples of GRG. The redshifts of the host galaxies span 0.09323 $\leq$ z $\leq$ 0.41134. Using the obtained spectroscopic data, we characterised their AGN states based on the optical emission line properties. To complement these observations, archival radio and optical survey data were utilised to characterise their large-scale radio morphology and estimate projected linear sizes, arm-length ratios, flux densities, luminosities, and core dominance factors. These results provide new insights into the properties of GRSs and form a critical foundation for further detailed studies of their environments, AGN activity, and evolution using future high-sensitivity optical and radio datasets.
#### Exploring the link between galaxy assembly and dark matter halo assembly in IllustrisTNG: Insights from the Mutual Information

 - **Abstract**
 We employed Mutual Information (MI) analysis to investigate the relationship between galaxy properties and the assembly history of their host dark matter (DM) haloes from the IllustrisTNG simulations. Focusing on central and satellite galaxies with stellar masses between $10^{9} \, - \, 10^{11.5}\, h^{-1} M_\odot$, we examined the correlation between halo assembly time and galaxy assembly time, specific star formation rate (sSFR), color $(g-i)$, and galaxy formation efficiency $F_\star$. Our results indicate a strong correlation between $F_\star$ and the halo assembly time for low-mass central galaxies, suggesting a co-evolutionary relationship. In contrast, sSFR and color $(g-i)$ exhibit weaker correlations with halo assembly time, indicating that additional factors should influence these galaxy properties. Satellite galaxies show negligible correlation between their properties and halo assembly time, highlighting the impact of environmental processes on their evolution. We further extended our analysis to cluster observables, including the magnitude gap, the satellite richness, and the distances to the satellites. Although these cluster properties display weak overall correlations with halo assembly time, the richness consistently increases with stellar mass. This trend suggests that richness is more closely linked to formation history in more massive haloes, where satellite accretion dominates the growth of their host DM haloes. These findings establish $F_\star$ as a more sensitive indicator of halo assembly history than colour $(g-i)$, sSFR, or cluster observables, offering new insights into the complex interplay between galaxy evolution and the hierarchical growth of their host dark matter haloes.

 - **Abstract**
 Extreme mass ratio inspiral (EMRI) systems composed of low-mass white dwarfs (WDs, $0.1 - 0.3$ $\mathrm{M}_{\odot } $) and intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs, $10^{3} - 10^{5}$ $\mathrm{M}_{\odot } $) are ideal objects for multi-messenger astronomy because they produce both gravitational wave (GW) and electromagnetic (EM) signals. Both relativistic effects and the mass transfer (MT) process are important for determining orbital dynamics, but the current model has not taken these ingredients fully into account. Here we use a perturbed Keplerian framework and the post-Newtonian (PN) formalism to model the relativistic orbit of a WD around a spinning IMBH. We pay special attention to the dynamical evolution during a narrow phase near the orbital pericenter where the WD fills the Roche lobe and starts MT. We find that gravitational radiation and MT have opposing effects on orbital evolution. When MT predominates, the orbital period and eccentricity could may increase, sometimes enabling the WD to escape and avoid tidal disruption. Additionally, we estimate the time required for the GW phase to shift by one radian due to the MT process and identify cases where this phase shift will be detectable by future GW observations. The temporal expansion of the orbit during MT offers a potential explanation for the disappearance of quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) found in several X-ray transients, highlighting the importance of including both the relativistic and MT processes in the WD-IMBH model.
#### Different physical and numerical sources of scatter in the $M_{\star}$-$M_{\mathrm{BH}}$ relation and their connection to galaxy evolution

 - **Abstract**
 Observations have established that the masses of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) correlate tightly with the stellar masses of their host galaxies, albeit with substantial scatter. The size of this scatter as a function of galaxy mass and redshift contains valuable information about the origin of SMBHs and the physical nature of their co-evolution with galaxies. In this work, we highlight this connection by studying the scatter in the $M_{\mathrm{BH}} - M_{\star}$ relation for massive galaxies in the Illustris, IllustrisTNG (TNG), and EAGLE cosmological simulations. We find that the scatter in TNG is significantly lower than in Illustris and EAGLE, reflecting their different BH feedback models. By performing various numerical experiments, we quantify different contributions to the scatter in the simulations, and also identify a suitably defined intrinsic scatter. The intrinsic scatter in Illustris and EAGLE is $\sim0.3$ dex at $z=0$, and is dominated by variations from BH accretion, whereas the smaller scatter of TNG is rather dominated by hierarchical merging, suggesting that the massive galaxies in TNG are more tightly quenched. Variations in the BH seed mass can contribute to the scatter of the $M_{\rm BH}-M_{\star}$ relation as well, but whether this still plays a role at $z=0$ depends on the feedback model. Simulations with disabled AGN feedback produce much higher scatter for low-mass galaxies than seen in our cosmological simulations, demonstrating the crucial influence of feedback for determining the co-evolution of SMBHs and their host galaxies in this regime. In contrast, an important factor in reducing the scatter for massive galaxies is hierarchical merging of mostly quenched systems. Based on our results, we expect that the scatter in the $M_{\mathrm{BH}} - M_{\star}$ relation at high redshift could be particularly powerful in providing clues to the origin of SMBHs.

 - **Abstract**
 On 13 March 2023, when the Parker Solar Probe was situated on the far side of the Sun as seen from Earth, a large solar eruption took place creating a strong solar energetic particle (SEP) event observed by multiple spacecraft (S/C). The energetic event was observed at six well-separated locations: Parker Solar Probe, Solar Orbiter, BepiColombo, STEREO~A, near-Earth S/C, and MAVEN. An in-situ shock crossing and a related energetic storm particle (ESP) event were observed at all inner-heliospheric S/C, suggesting that the interplanetary coronal mass ejection (CME)-driven shock extended all around the Sun. However, the solar event was accompanied by a series of pre-event CMEs. We aim to characterize this extreme widespread SEP event and to provide an explanation for the unusual observation of a circumsolar interplanetary shock and corresponding circumsolar ESP event. We analyse data from seven space missions to characterize the solar eruption at the Sun, the energetic particle event, and the interplanetary context at each observer location as well as the magnetic connectivity of each observer to the Sun. We employ magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the solar wind in which we inject various CMEs that were launched before as well as contemporaneously with the solar eruption under study. In particular, we test two different scenarios that could have produced the observed global ESP event: 1) a single circumsolar blast-wave-like shock launched by the associated solar eruption, and 2) the combination of multiple CMEs driving shocks into different directions. By comparing the simulations of the two scenarios with observations we find that both settings are able to explain the observations. However, the blast-wave scenario performs slightly better in terms of the predicted shock arrival times at the various observers.

 - **Abstract**
 Accreting supermassive black hole binaries are powerful multimessenger sources emitting both gravitational and electromagnetic (EM) radiation. Understanding the accretion dynamics of these systems and predicting their distinctive EM signals is crucial to informing and guiding upcoming efforts aimed at detecting gravitational waves produced by these binaries. To this end, accurate numerical modeling is required to describe both the spacetime and the magnetized gas around the black holes. In this paper, we present two key advances in this field of research. First, we have developed a novel 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) framework that combines multiple numerical codes to simulate the inspiral and merger of supermassive black hole binaries starting from realistic initial data and running all the way through merger. Throughout the evolution, we adopt a simple but functional prescription to account for gas cooling through the emission of photons. Next, we have applied our new computational method to follow the time evolution of a circular, equal-mass, non-spinning black hole binary for ${\sim\!200}$ orbits starting from a separation of ${20\,r_g}$ and reaching the post-merger evolutionary stage of the system. We have identified how and when the minidisks dissolve as the binary compresses. We also show that even when the binary ``decouples'' from its surrounding disk, its luminosity decreases by only a factor of a few and abruptly increases by ${\sim\!50\%}$ at the time of merger, accompanied by an equally abrupt change in spectrum. Finally, the magnetic flux brought to the spin-parameter ${\sim\!0.68}$ merger remnant is able to drive a relativistic, Poynting-flux-dominated jet.

 - **Abstract**
 As a major interstellar medium, the atomic neutral hydrogen (HI) plays an important role in the galaxy evolution. It provides the ingredient for star formation, and sensitively traces the internal processes and external perturbations influencing the galaxy. With the beginning of many new radio telescopes and surveys, HI may make a more significant contribution to the understanding of galaxies in the near future. This review discusses the major development of the $21\,\text{cm}$ emission-line HI observations and studies in the past few years, including its scaling relations with other galaxy properties, its kinematics and structures, its role in environmental studies, and its constraints on hydrodynamical simulations. The local-Universe HI scaling relations of stellar-mass--selected samples extend smoothly to $10^9\,\text{M}_\odot$ stellar mass, with a tentative evolution to the redshift of ${\sim}0.1$. The development of measurement techniques enables better estimations of HI non-circular motion, dispersion, and thickness, and new observations revealed extended or extra-planar HI structures, both helpfully constraining the gas accretion, stellar feedback, and star formation processes of galaxy evolution models. HI is very useful for tracing the on-going satellite evolution in dense environments, the studies of which would benefit from ongoing blind HI surveys. Though simulations still cannot fully reproduce HI gas properties, they help to understand the role of possible factors in regulating HI properties. We also discuss possible future progress with new observations at FAST.

 - **Abstract**
 Forbidden coronal lines has traditionally called the attention due to the high-energy photons required for their production (IP $>$100~eV, where IP is the ionisation potential of the transitions that originate the line). As such, they are regarded as the most highly ionised component of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). For decades, it was thought that they were only formed in the inner portions of the narrow line region (NLR). Nowadays, due to the larger sensitivity of the detectors and the availability of integral field unit (IFU) spectrographs, that emission in addition to the nuclear component is found to be extended up to a few kiloparsecs away from the active centre. In this review, we highlight the most important aspects of the coronal emission and discuss the recent developments in the field. In particular, we emphasize the discovery that they can be used to determine the mass of the central supermassive black hole, to reconstruct the SED, as well as to trace the most energetic feedback component of the ionised gas in AGN.

 - **Abstract**
 We review the existing distance estimates to the black hole X-ray binary Swift J1727.8$-$1613 with a discussion of the accuracies and caveats of the associated methodologies. As part of this, we present new line-of-sight HI absorption spectra captured using the MeerKAT radio telescope. We estimate a maximum radial velocity with respect to the local standard of rest of $24.8 \pm 2.8$ km s$^{-1}$, which is significantly lower than that found towards an extragalactic reference source. Given the location of Swift J1727.8$-$1613 at Galactic longitude and latitude $(l, b) \approx (8.6°, 10.3°)$, we explore the feasibility of the HI absorption method. From this we derive a near kinematic distance of $d_{\rm{near}} = 3.6 \pm 0.3\ (stat) \pm 2.3\ (sys)$ kpc as lower bound for the distance to Swift J1727.8$-$1613. We compare our results with those derived from different distance determination methods including the use of colour excess or reddening along the line of sight, which we constrain to $E(B-V) = 0.37 \pm 0.01\ (stat) \pm 0.025\ (sys)$ using near-UV spectra. By combining this with donor star magnitudes reported by Mata Sánchez et al. (2024b), we suggest an increased distance of $5.5^{+1.4}_{-1.1}$ kpc, which would imply a natal kick velocity of $190 \pm 30$ km s$^{-1}$.

 - **Abstract**
 In July 2024, Sunrise completed its third successful science flight. The Sunrise III observatory had been upgraded significantly after the two previous successful flights in 2009 and 2013. Three completely new instruments focus on the small-scale physical processes and their complex interaction from the deepest observable layers in the photosphere up to chromospheric heights. Previously poorly explored spectral regions and lines are exploited to paint a three-dimensional picture of the solar atmosphere with unprecedented completeness and level of detail. The full polarimetric information is captured by all three instruments to reveal the interaction between the magnetic fields and the hydrodynamic processes. Two slit- based spectropolarimeters, the Sunrise UV Spectropolarimeter and Imager (SUSI) and the Sunrise Chromospheric Infrared spectro-Polarimeter (SCIP), focus on the near-ultraviolet and the near-infrared regions respectively, and the imaging spectropolarimeter Tunable Magnetograph (TuMag) simultaneously obtains maps of the full field-of-view of $46 \times 46$ Mm$^2$ in the photosphere and the chromosphere in the visible. The instruments are operated in an orchestrated mode, benefiting from a new Image Stabilization and Light Distribution unit (ISLiD), with the Correlating Wavefront Sensor (CWS) providing the autofocus control and an image stability with a root-mean-square value smaller than 0.005''. A new gondola was constructed to significantly improve the telescope pointing stability, required to achieve uninterrupted observations over many hours. Sunrise III was launched successfully on July 10, 2024, from the Esrange Space Center near Kiruna (Sweden). It reached the landing site between the Mackenzie River and the Great Bear Lake in Canada after a flight duration of 6.5 days. In this paper, we give an overview of the Sunrise III observatory and its instruments.

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate determinations of metallicity for large, complete stellar samples are essential for advancing various studies of the Milky Way. In this paper, we present a data-driven algorithm that leverages photometric data from the KiDS and the VIKING surveys to estimate stellar absolute magnitude, effective temperature and metallicities. The algorithm is trained and validated using spectroscopic data from LAMOST, SEGUE, APOGEE, and GALAH, as well as a catalog of very metal-poor stars from the literature, and Gaia EDR3 data. This approach enables us to estimate metallicities, effective temperatures, and g-band absolute magnitudes for approximately 0.8 million stars in the KiDS dataset. The photometric metallicity estimates exhibit an uncertainty of around 0.28 dex when compared to spectroscopic studies, within the metallicity range of -2 dex to 0.5 dex. The photometric effective temperature estimates have an uncertainty of around 149 K, while the uncertainty in the absolute magnitude is approximately 0.36 mag. The metallicity estimates are reliable for values down to about -2 dex. This catalog represents a valuable resource for studying the structure and chemical properties of the Milky Way, offering an extensive dataset for future investigations into Galactic formation and evolution.
#### ADF22-WEB: Detection of a molecular gas reservoir in a massive quiescent galaxy located in a $z\approx3$ proto-cluster core

 - **Abstract**
 We present a study of the molecular gas reservoirs and dust contents in three quiescent galaxies (QGs) located in the core of the $z=3.09$ SSA22 proto-cluster. Using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), we detect CO(3--2) emission in one galaxy, ADF22-QG1, marking the first direct detection of molecular gas in a quiescent galaxy from the early universe. The detected galaxy, ADF22-QG1, has a molecular gas mass of log$M_{\rm H_2}$/M$_\odot = 10.26 \pm 0.07$ assuming a CO-to-H$2$ conversion factor $\alpha_{\rm CO} = 4.4$ (log$M_{\rm H_2}$/M$_\odot = 9.52 \pm 0.07$ for $\alpha_{\rm CO} = 0.8$), corresponding to a gas mass fraction of $f_{\rm gas} \approx 14\%$ (2.5\%). The gas-to-dust ratio $\delta _{\rm gdr}\gtrsim170$ ($\delta_{\rm gdr}\gtrsim30$) for $\alpha_{\rm CO} = 4.4$ ($\alpha_{\rm CO} =0.8$) is also derived for the first time for a QG at the epoch. For the other two galaxies, ADF22-QG2 and ADF22-QG3, non detections of CO(3--2) emission provide upper limits, $f_{\rm gas} \approx 17\%$ (3.1\%) and $f_{\rm gas} \approx 13\%$ (2.4\%), respectively. The inferred gas-consumption history of ADF22-QG1, based on its star-formation history, suggests that (i) dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) at $z = 4$--$6$ are plausible progenitors, and (ii) the cessation of gas accretion from cosmic web filaments plays an important role in their evolution to quenched systems. Furthermore, the presence of a detectable molecular gas reservoir in ADF22-QG1 indicates that additional mechanisms, such as morphological quenching, may be required to fully explain its quiescent nature.
#### MAD accretion and AGN jets - an observational perspective

 - **Abstract**
 One of the major open questions related to the production of jets by accreting black holes is: why do sources with similar accretion powers produce so vastly different jet powers? What conditions are required to make a powerful jet? If jets are powered by the Blandford-Zjanek mechanism, two further parameters control the jet power besides the black hole mass - black hole spin and the magnetic flux threading it. Since highly spinning black holes without jets appear to exist, the jet production efficiency may depend on whether the black hole managed to accrete high enough magnetic flux in the past. The highest-efficiency jets in this picture are launched from magnetically arrested disks (MADs). Here we discuss a method to test this hypothesis using VLBI core-shift measurements to estimate the jet magnetic flux.

 - **Abstract**
 We present first results from James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec), Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI), and Keck Cosmic Webb Imager (KCWI) integral field spectroscopy of the powerful but highly obscured host-galaxy of the jetted radio source Cygnus A. We detect 169 infrared emission lines at 1.7--27 micron and explore the kinematics and physical properties of the extended narrow-line region (NLR) in unprecedented detail. The density-stratified NLR appears to be shaped by the initial blow-out and ongoing interaction of the radio jet with the interstellar medium, creating a multi-phase bicone with a layered structure composed of molecular and ionized gas. The NLR spectrum, with strong coronal emission at kpc-scale, is well-modeled by AGN photoionization. We find evidence that the NLR is rotating around the radio axis, perhaps mediated by magnetic fields and driven by angular momentum transfer from the radio jet. The overall velocity field of the NLR is well described by 250 km/s outflow along biconical spiral flow lines, combining both rotation and outflow signatures. There is particularly bright [Fe II] 1.644 micron emission from a dense, high-velocity dispersion, photoionized clump of clouds found near the projected radio axis. Outflows of 600--2000 km/s are found in bullets and streamers of ionized gas that may be ablated by the radio jet from these clouds, driving a local outflow rate of 40 Msun/yr.

 - **Abstract**
 The Voyager spacecrafts have been measuring since 2012 the rates of electron and nuclei of the cosmic radiation beyond the solar cavity at a distance of more than $10^{13}$ $meters$ from the Earth. A record of unique and notable findings have been reported and, among them, the electron-to-proton flux ratio of 50 to 100 below energies of $50$ $MeV$. This ratio is thoroughly opposite of that of 0.01 measured at higher energies in the range 10 $GeV$ to 10 $TeV$. The difference amounts to four orders of magnitude. Arguments and calculations to show how this surprising and fundamental ratio lends support to the empirical evidence of the ubiquitous electrostatic field in the Milky Way Galaxy are presented. In other respects this paper examines and calculates, for the first time, the electric charge balance in the solar system delimited by the $termination$ $shock$ of the solar wind.
#### Reconstructing the shape of the non-linear matter power spectrum using CMB lensing and cosmic shear

 - **Abstract**
 We reconstruct the non-linear matter power spectrum $P(k)$ using a joint analysis of gravitational lensing of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and lensing of galaxies. This reconstruction is motivated by the $S_8$ tension between early-universe CMB predictions and late-time observables. We use CMB lensing data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope DR6 and cosmic shear data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Y3 release to perform a gravity-only (i.e. no baryonic feedback) fit to $P(k)$ in bins of wave-number, within $\rm{\Lambda CDM}$. We find that with DES cosmic shear data alone, $P(k)$ departs from the early-universe CMB prediction on all scales. The joint fit with CMB lensing is consistent on large scales $k<0.2 \;{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ but shows a $\sim 2 \sigma$ deviation from scale-independence when extending to $k = 10 \;h/\mathrm{Mpc}$. We compare our agnostic $P(k)$ reconstruction to baryonic feedback models and non-standard dark matter models: reasonable variations of both scenarios can recover the shape and amplitude of the suppression. We discuss the advances needed to disentangle these physical effects with a full mapping of $P(k,z)$.

 - **Abstract**
 Cold molecular gas, largely traced by CO emission, is the primary fuel for star formation, making it essential for understanding galaxy evolution. ALMA has made significant progress in the study of the cosmic evolution of cold molecular gas. Here, we exploit the ALMACAL survey to address issues relating to small sample sizes and cosmic variance, utilising calibration data from ALMA to compile a statistically significant and essentially unbiased sample of CO-selected galaxies. By employing a novel statistical approach to emission-line classification using semi-analytical models, we place strong constraints on the CO luminosity function and the cosmic evolution of molecular gas mass density ($\rho_{H_2}$) back to $z \sim 6$. The cosmic molecular gas mass density increases with redshift, peaking around $z \sim 1.5$, then slowly declines towards higher redshifts by $\sim 1$ dex. Our findings confirm the key role of molecular gas in fuelling star formation. The new $\rho_{H_2}$ estimates allow us to revisit the cosmic baryon cycle, showing that the ratio of molecular gas-to-stellar mass density is consistent with the so-called 'bathtub model' of baryons, which implies a continuous replenishment of gas. The cosmic gas depletion timescale, estimated on a global scale, is shown to be fairly constant at all redshifts. We emphasise the importance of surveys using multiple small fields rather than a single contiguous area to mitigate the effects of cosmic variance.
