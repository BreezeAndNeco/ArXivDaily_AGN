 - **Abstract**
 Direct detection experiments require information about the local dark matter speed distribution to produce constraints on dark matter candidates, or infer their properties in the event of a discovery. In this paper, we analyze how the uncertainty in the dark matter speed distribution near the Sun is affected by baryonic feedback, halo-to-halo variance, and halo mass. To do so, we harness the statistical power of the new DREAMS Cold Dark Matter simulation suite, which is comprised of 1024 zoom-in Milky Way-mass halos with varied initial conditions as well as cosmological and astrophysical parameters. Applying a normalizing flows emulator to these simulations, we find that the uncertainty in the local DM speed distribution is dominated by halo-to-halo variance and, to a lesser extent, uncertainty in host halo mass. Uncertainties in supernova and black hole feedback (from the IllustrisTNG model in this case) are negligible in comparison. Using the DREAMS suite, we present a state-of-the-art prediction for the DM speed distribution in the Milky Way. Although the Standard Halo Model is contained within the uncertainty of this prediction, individual galaxies may have distributions that differ from it. Lastly, we apply our DREAMS results to the XENON1T experiment and demonstrate that the astrophysical uncertainties are comparable to the experimental ones, solidifying previous results in the literature obtained with a smaller sample of simulated Milky Way-mass halos.

 - **Abstract**
 We aim to study the atmospheric properties of the warm Neptune GJ 436 b by combining a set of five transit events observed with the CARMENES spectrograph with one transit from CRIRES$^+$ so as to provide the most constrained results possible at high resolution. We removed telluric and stellar signals from the data using SysRem and potential planetary signals were investigated using the cross-correlation technique. Following standard procedures for undetected species, we performed injection recovery tests and Bayesian retrievals to place constraints on the detectability of the main near-infrared absorbers. In addition, we simulated ELT/ANDES observations by computing end-to-end in silico datasets with EXoPLORE. No molecular signals were detected in the atmosphere of GJ 436 b, which is consistent with previous studies. Combined CARMENES-CRIRES$^+$ injection-recovery and Bayesian retrieval analyses show that the atmosphere is likely covered by high-altitude clouds ($\sim$ $1$ mbar) at low and intermediate metallicities or, alternatively, is very metal-rich ($\gtrsim$ $900\times$ solar), which would suppress spectral features without invoking clouds. Simulations of ELT/ANDES observations suggest a boost by nearly an order of magnitude to the upper limit in the photon-limited regime, reaching $0.1$ mbar at $10$-$300\times$ solar metallicities. The joint analysis of all useful transit observations from CARMENES and CRIRES$^+$ provides the most stringent constraints to date on the atmospheric properties of GJ 436 b. Complementary CCF-based and retrieval approaches consistently indicate that the atmosphere is either cloudy or highly metal enriched. Any weak near-infrared absorption lines, if present, are likely to be below current detection limits. However, according to our simulations, these features may be revealed with ELT/ANDES even in single-transit observations.

 - **Abstract**
 We present JWST/NIRSpec IFU observations of a candidate runaway supermassive black hole at the tip of a 62 kpc-long linear feature at z=0.96. The JWST data show a sharp kinematic discontinuity at the tip, with a radial velocity change of $\approx 600$ km/s across 0.1'' (1 kpc). The velocity gradient, together with the projected post-shock flow velocity of $\approx 300$ km/s, is well described by a simple shock-compression model of a supersonic object, with a velocity of $v_{BH} = 954^{+110}_{-126}$ km/s and an inclination $i=29^{+6}_{-3}$ deg. The previously puzzling kinematics along the linear feature, with the observed radial velocity decreasing from $\approx 300$ km/s near the tip to $\approx 100$ km/s closer to the former host galaxy, are naturally explained as gradual downstream mixing of shocked gas with the circumgalactic medium through turbulent entrainment. The runaway black hole interpretation is further supported by the morphology of the gas at the tip of the wake and an analysis of the [OIII]/H$\alpha$, [NII]/H$\alpha$, [SII]/H$\alpha$, and [SIII]/[SII] line ratios. The line ratios are consistent with fast radiative shocks and rapid cooling, with best-fit shock velocities that are in good agreement with expectations from the black hole velocity and the shock geometry. Energy conservation over the lifetime of the wake suggests a SMBH mass of $M_{BH} \gtrsim 10^7$ M$_{\odot}$. These results confirm that the wake is powered by a supersonic runaway supermassive black hole, a long-predicted consequence of gravitational-wave recoil or multi-body ejection from galactic nuclei.

 - **Abstract**
 The observational efficiency of pulsars, defined as the ratio of the observationally derived isotropic-equivalent luminosity, $4\pi d_{obs}^2 F_{obs}$, where $F_{obs}$ is the average pulsed energy flux of a pulsar and $d_{obs}$ is its estimated distance, to its energy budget, shows a wide range of values. This dispersion is believed to be a combination of beaming effects, different geometries, and case-by-case variability of the emission mechanism efficiency, but it is not clear in what proportion. In this work we focused on the gamma-ray range and analysed the four main ingredients that likely contribute to this dispersion: the geometrical term arising from the anisotropic emission (beaming), viewing and inclination angles, the uncertainty on the pulsar distance, the uncertainty on the moment of inertia, and the intrinsic efficiency of the mechanism producing the gamma-ray emission. Estimating the expected ranges of the moment of inertia and the distance errors, and considering a geometrical and spectral model that we have recently used to fit the light curves and spectra of the entire gamma-ray pulsar population, we estimate the a priori distribution of the first three ingredients in order to obtain the a posteriori distribution of the intrinsic efficiency of the mechanism. We found the latter to peak at $\sim 5-15 \%$ and to have a dispersion of around one order of magnitude. That is, we found the intrinsic efficiency of the mechanism to be the leading factor in the observed dispersion. In addition, we found little sensitivity of these results on different distributions of the estimated pulsar distance errors, and saw that the weak, alleged correlation with the spin-down power can only explain part of the observed dispersion. This methodology can be easily applied to other geometrical models of the emission, to test the sensitivity of these results on the beaming distribution.

 - **Abstract**
 Using a high-resolution simulation of a dwarf galaxy, we quantify the energetic importance of magnetic fields within the different phases of its interstellar medium (ISM) on parsec scales. We show that, whilst overall the magnetic field is only energetically dominant for a small fraction of the ISM, it becomes important in the thermally unstable regime (45.2% of the mass is magnetically dominated), and in the majority of the cold neutral medium (66.1% of the mass). In the molecular gas, the magnetic field dominates more of the total mass budget (39.8%) than thermal energy, turbulent kinetic energy, or gas self-gravitating potential energy. However, much of this gas will be CO-dark. This suggests that magnetic forces are non-negligible during the formation of cold dense gas, which will slow its collapse and lead to an increase in the fraction of cold atomic, and molecular gas in the ISM. Consequently, star-forming clouds may be surrounded by a larger reservoir of cold gas than would otherwise be expected.

 - **Abstract**
 The Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC) are the Milky Way's nearest interacting galaxy pair, offering a unique laboratory for studying tidal effects on galactic disks. Despite extensive survey efforts, the three-dimensional geometry of the Clouds, particularly the putative warp of the LMC, remains poorly constrained due to incompleteness in their crowded centers and the low stellar density of their peripheries, which demand wide-field coverage. Using red-clump (RC) stars as standard candles, corrected for age- and metallicity-dependent population effects with empirically calibrated color-magnitude relations and spatially resolved star-formation histories, we construct the most detailed distance map of the Magellanic System to date. Based on $\sim$2.3 million RC stars from \textit{Gaia} DR3 combined with modern reddening maps, we measure median heliocentric distances of $50.62 \pm 2.32$~kpc for the LMC (to $\sim$23$^{\circ}$) and $60.75 \pm 2.85$~kpc for the SMC (to $\sim$12$^{\circ}$). The maps reveal substructures including the LMC Northern Arm, southern hooks, the Magellanic Bridge, and SMC peripheral over-densities, with refreshed distance estimates. Fitting the LMC disk within $7^{\circ}$ yields a global inclination of $i = 25.32^{\circ} \pm 0.10^{\circ}$ and line-of-nodes position angle of $\theta = 142.34^{\circ} \pm 0.21^{\circ}$. Most strikingly, we find the LMC periphery is warped azimuthally into a U-shaped structure reaching vertical amplitudes of $\sim$7~kpc at radii of $\sim$15~kpc. We interpret this warp as a tidal response to the most recent close passage of the SMC $\sim$300 Myr ago, providing new constraints on the orbital history and dynamical evolution of the Magellanic Clouds.

 - **Abstract**
 Feedback from active supermassive black holes alters the distribution of matter in the Universe by injecting energy in the neighbouring hot gaseous medium, which leads to ejection of gas from the halos of galaxy groups and massive galaxies. Recent cosmological simulations such as FLAMINGO calibrate their feedback model on the baryon fractions of galaxy groups to tune the efficiency of gas ejection. However, recent observational constraints from optically selected groups and the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect yield lower baryon fractions than previous studies, which indicates that feedback may be more ejective than previously thought. Here we show that models involving highly ejective feedback are inconsistent with the scaling relations of local galaxy groups in the mass range $10^{13}-10^{14}M_\odot$. We study the X-ray luminosity-temperature relation in a sample of 44 galaxy groups with high-quality XMM-Newton observations. We show that highly ejective models under-predict the luminosity of galaxy groups at fixed mass at high significance ($5.7\sigma$). This conclusion is robust against selection effects and is obtained from directly measurable and minimally correlated quantities. We point out that turning observable quantities into gas fraction estimates is challenging, especially in the context of stacking large samples of heterogeneous systems. We argue that calibrating feedback models on baryon fractions is prone to systematic uncertainties and that observable scaling relations are better suited for this task.

 - **Abstract**
 Little red dots (LRDs) newly discovered with JWST are active galactic nuclei (AGN) that may represent black hole (BH) growth at the earliest cosmic epochs. These sources show puzzling features unlike typical AGNs, including red optical continua, weak hot-dust emission, and a lack of detectable X-rays. Previously, LRDs have often been interpreted as dust-reddened AGNs, leading to severe inconsistencies with the luminosity and BH mass densities inferred for previously known AGNs over $0<z<5$. The BH-envelope (BHE) model has been proposed to explain these characteristics, in which an accreting BH is enshrouded by a dense, optically thick gaseous envelope. In this Letter, we reanalyze the SEDs of $\sim 400$ photometric LRDs in the COSMOS-Web survey using the BHE model and reassess their implications for cosmological BH evolution. We find that the optical-NIR spectra of LRDs are well reproduced by blackbody emission with an effective temperatures of $4000-6000~\K$. Within the BHE framework, the inferred bolometric luminosities decrease by $\gtrsim1-2$ orders of magnitude compared to dust-reddened AGN assumptions. As a result, the revised luminosity function, BH accretion density, and BH mass function become consistent with those of AGNs at $z<5$. The stellar masses of LRD hosts are estimated by attributing the UV excesses to star formation. Although the resulting $M_{\rm BH}/M_\star$ ratio remains higher than the local empirical value, the excess is modest. Overall, the BHE model not only resolves the spectral features of LRDs but also brings their statistical properties into agreement with the broader cosmological BH population.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmology from weak gravitational lensing has been limited by astrophysical uncertainties in baryonic feedback and intrinsic alignments. By calibrating these effects using external data, we recover non-linear information, achieving a 2% constraint on the clustering amplitude, $S_8$, resulting in a factor of two improvement on the $\Lambda$CDM constraints relative to the fiducial Dark Energy Survey Year 3 model. The posterior, $S_8=0.832^{+0.013}_{-0.017}$, shifts by $1.5\sigma$ to higher values, in closer agreement with the cosmic microwave background result for the standard six-parameter $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Our approach uses a star-forming 'blue' galaxy sample with intrinsic alignment model parameters calibrated by direct spectroscopic measurements, together with a baryonic feedback model informed by observations of X-ray gas fractions and kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect profiles that span a wide range in halo mass and redshift. Our results provide a blueprint for next-generation surveys: leveraging galaxy properties to control intrinsic alignments and external gas probes to calibrate feedback, unlocking a substantial improvement in the precision of weak lensing surveys.
#### Asymptotic constraints for 1D planar grey photon diffusion from linear transport with special-relativistic effects

 - **Abstract**
 We derive a grey linear diffusion equation for photons with respect to inertial (or lab-frame) space and time, using asymptotic analysis in 1D planar geometry. The solution of the equation is the comoving radiation energy density. Our analysis does not make use of assumptions about the magnitude of velocity; instead we derive an asymptotic scaling in the lab frame such that we avoid apparent non-physical pathologies that are encountered with the standard static-matter scaling. We permit the photon direction to be continuous (as opposed to constraining the analysis to discrete ordinates). The result is a drift-diffusion equation in the lab frame for comoving radiation energy density, with an adiabatic term that matches the standard semi-relativistic diffusion equation. Following a recent study for discrete directions, this equation reduces to a pure advection equation as the velocity approaches the speed of light. We perform preliminary numerical experiments comparing solutions to relativistic lab-frame Monte Carlo transport and to the well-known semi-relativistic diffusion equation.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigated the occurrence rate of the sustained gamma ray emission (SGRE) events from the Sun using Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) data covering solar cycle (SC) 24 and the rising and maximum phases of SC 25. Due to a solar array drive assembly malfunction starting in March 2018, only small number (15) of SGRE events were observed during SC 25. Over the first 61 months, the average sunspot number (SSN) increased from 56.9 in SC 24 to 79.0 in SC 25. Fast and wide (FW) CMEs and decameter-hectometric (DH) type II bursts also increased significantly in SC 25 by 29% and 33%, respectively when normalized to SSN. Therefore, the increase in solar activity should result in a higher number of SGREs in SC 25. We estimated the number of SGREs in SC 25 using three methods. (i) If the SGRE number varies commensurate FW CMEs and DH type II bursts, SC 25 should have 45-47 SGRE events. (ii) In SC 24, ~17% of FW CMEs and 25% of DH type II bursts were associated with SGRE events. At this rate, SC 25 should have 46 SGRE events. (iii) Since SGRE events are invariably associated with >100 keV hard X-ray (HXR) bursts, we identified DH type II bursts associated with >100 keV HXR bursts from Fermi gamma ray burst monitor (GBM) during LAT data gaps. Based on our finding that SGRE events in SCs 24 and 25 were all associated with HXR bursts of duration > ~5 min, we found only 27 of the 79 LAT-gap type II bursts had >100 keV HXR bursts with duration > ~5 min. These DH type II bursts are likely to indicate SGRE, bringing the total number of SGRE events to 42 (15 observed + 27 inferred). Thus, the three methods provide similar estimates of the number of SGRE events in SC 25. We, therefore, conclude that that SC 25 is stronger than SC 24 based on the estimated number SGRE events. Halo CMEs, ground level enhancement (GLE) events, and intense geomagnetic storms are also consistent with a stronger SC 25.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the clustering and halo occupation distribution (HOD) of DESI Y1 emission-line (ELGs) and luminous red (LRGs) galaxies at $0.8<z<1.1$, including their cross-correlation (ELG$\times$LRG), using the AbacusSummit suite and a new Halo Occupation Model (HOMe) for galaxy multi-tracers. This integrates intra-halo dynamics, halo exclusion, and quenching, bridging insights from hydrodynamical, HOD, abundance-matching, and semi-analytic studies. Leveraging full phase-space information from the Uchuu N-body simulation, and sampling satellites from dark-matter particle positions via physically motivated prescriptions, HOMe reproduces the anisotropic clustering down to $s=200\,h^{-1}$kpc with unprecedented accuracy. Model parameters are inferred solely from two-point statistics using a two-level Bayesian framework, yielding high-fidelity ELG, LRG and cross-reference catalogs. We find that satellite ELGs behave as incoherent flows within their parent halos, dominating the clustering below $4\,h^{-1}$Mpc. The HOD from the best-fit HOMe has the following properties: (i) 90.50% (85.91%) of ELGs (LRGs) are central galaxies without satellites, residing in halos of $M_{\rm vir}\sim6.6\times10^{11}\,(1.2\times10^{13})\,h^{-1}{\rm M}_\odot$; (ii) the ELG$\times$LRG cross-correlation is governed by central-central pairs and shaped by halo exclusion on $2-5\,h^{-1}$Mpc scales; (iii) 9.50% (14.09%) of ELGs (LRGs) are satellites, of which 1.09% (3.52%) inhabit halos with a central galaxy of the same species in a maximally conformal configuration, 7.02% (0.005%) orbit complementary hosts in a minimally conformal state, and 0.58% (10.57%) are orphans. HOMe high sensitivity precisely captures the dynamics of satellites in different host environments, opening a promising avenue for understanding systematics, the dynamical nature of dark matter, potentially distinguishing gravity models.

 - **Abstract**
 Unstable mass transfer may occur during white dwarf-neutron star (WD-NS) mergers, in which the WD can be tidally disrupted and form an accretion disk around the NS. Such an accretion disk can produce unbound wind ejecta, with synthesized $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$ mixed in. Numerical simulations reveal that this unbound ejecta should be strongly polar-dominated, which may cause the following radioactive-powered thermal transient to be viewing-angle-dependent. This issue has so far received limited investigation. We investigate how the intrinsically non-spherical geometry of WD-NS wind ejecta affects the viewing-angle dependence of the thermal transients. Using a two-dimensional axisymmetric ejecta configuration and incorporating heating from the radioactive decay of $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$, we employ a semi-analytical discretization scheme to simulate the observed viewing-angle-dependent photospheric evolution, as well as the resulting spectra and lightcurves. The observed photosphere evolves over time and depends strongly on the viewing angle: off-axis observers can see deeper, hotter inner layers of the ejecta and larger projected photospheric areas compared to on-axis observers. For a fiducial WD-NS merger producing 0.3 solar mass of ejecta and 0.01 solar mass of synthesized $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$, the resulting peak optical absolute magnitudes of the transient span from ~ -12 mag along the polar direction to ~ -16 mag along the equatorial direction, corresponding to luminosities of $10^{40}$-$10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The typical peak timescales are expected to be 3-10 d. We for the first time explore the viewing-angle effect on WD-NS merger transients. Since their ejecta composition and energy sources resemble those of supernovae, yet WD-NS merger transients are dimmer and evolve more rapidly, we propose using "mini-supernovae" to describe the thermal emission following WD-NS mergers.

 - **Abstract**
 The elements in the universe are synthesized primarily in stars and supernovae, where nuclear fusion favors the production of even-Z elements. In contrast, odd-Z elements are less abundant and their yields are highly dependent on detailed stellar physics, making theoretical predictions of their cosmic abundance uncertain. In particular, the origin of odd-Z elements such as phosphorus (P), chlorine (Cl), and potassium (K), which are important for planet formation and life, is poorly understood. While the abundances of these elements in Milky Way stars are close to solar values, supernova explosion models systematically underestimate their production by up to an order of magnitude, indicating that key mechanisms for odd-Z nucleosynthesis are currently missing from theoretical models. Here we report the observation of P, Cl, and K in the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A using high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy with XRISM, with the detection of K at above the 6$\sigma$ level being the most significant finding. Supernova explosion models of normal massive stars cannot explain the element abundance pattern, especially the high abundances of Cl and K, while models that include stellar rotation, binary interactions or shell mergers agree closely with the observations. Our observations suggest that such stellar activity plays a significant role in supplying these elements to the universe.

 - **Abstract**
 We report detailed analyses of deep, high-resolution spectra of three Galactic planetary nebulae (PNe) with high abundance discrepancy factors (ADFs), Hf2-2, M1-42 and NGC6153, obtained with the Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph (UVES) on the 8.2m Very Large Telescope (VLT). These spectra were carefully reduced, including rigorous absolute flux calibration, yielding detections of ~410-800 emission lines in each PN. Plasma diagnostics and abundance calculations were critically performed using nebular lines. In all three PNe, the electron temperatures derived using the collisionally excited lines (CELs) are higher than those yielded by the HI Balmer and Paschen jumps, while the temperatures yielded by the OII and NII optical recombination lines (ORLs) are very low, <2000 K, indicating that the heavy-element ORLs probe cold nebular regions. The ORL abundances of N, O and Ne are systematically higher than the corresponding CEL values, confirming high ADFs in the three objects. Position-velocity (PV) diagrams were created, and spatio-kinematical studies show that CELs come from the outer nebular regions, while the ORL-emitting regions are close to nebular center. Additionally, the velocity indicated by CEL line-splitting decreases with ionization potential, which was not obvious in ORLs. These spatial and kinematic differences support two distinct components of ionized gas: a cold, metal-rich component and a warmer component with normal metallicity. Heavy elements are strongly enriched in the cold gas, while its H^+ fraction is low but still produces significant HI emission, affecting CEL abundance estimates.

 - **Abstract**
 Observational studies have established a remarkably tight power-law relationship between the H I masses and sizes of late-type galaxies, known as the H I mass-size relation. This relation has been shown to persist across various models of a galaxy's H I surface density profile. Using the Simba cosmological simulations, we investigate the robustness of this relation under different feedback prescriptions, including cases where specific feedback mechanisms are absent. While the global properties of galaxies are significantly affected by changes in feedback, the H I mass-size relation remains intact. Moreover, its parameters consistently align with the best available empirical measurements. We analyze the H I mass distributions of galaxies and demonstrate that, regardless of the feedback scenario, galaxies within a given H I mass bin exhibit outer H I radial profiles well approximated by an exponential function. Furthermore, the exponential decline rate remains remarkably similar across different physical prescriptions. We attribute the persistence of the H I mass-size relation to this inherent self-similarity in the H I mass distributions.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the stellar velocity dispersion functions (VDFs) of pressure-supported galaxies in the EAGLE cosmological simulations. The central stellar velocity dispersion is one of the fundamental dynamical tracers of the total mass of galaxy subhalos, alongside luminosity and stellar mass. Because it reflects the gravitational potential, the stellar velocity dispersion is expected to be relatively insensitive to feedback from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), a critical process that regulates the connection between other galaxy observables and subhalo mass. To examine the impact of AGN feedback, we analyze the VDFs from five EAGLE simulation runs, each adopting a different AGN feedback model: one "standard", two "enhanced", one "reduced", and one with no AGN feedback. We compute the stellar velocity dispersions of pressure-supported galaxies using member stellar particles, mimicking fiber spectroscopy. The VDFs from the standard and enhanced AGN feedback models show little difference. However, contrary to our initial expectation that the VDF shape would be largely insensitive to AGN feedback, the simulations with reduced and no AGN feedback show a significant excess of high velocity dispersion galaxies ($\sigma_{*}$ > 200 km s$^{-1}$) and a deficit of low dispersion galaxies (100 < $\sigma_{*}$ (km s$^{-1}$) < 200), compared to those with standard or enhanced AGN feedback. The presence of high velocity dispersion galaxies in the no-AGN model arises from enhanced central star formation, due to the absence of AGN-driven gas heating or expulsion. Our results demonstrate that the shape of the theoretical VDF is sensitive to the strength of AGN feedback. These predictions offer a theoretical benchmark for future observational studies of the galaxy velocity dispersion function using large-scale spectroscopic surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 A central question for understanding interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) physics and improving space weather forecasting is how ICMEs evolve in interplanetary space. We have updated one of the most comprehensive in situ ICME catalogs to date, which now includes 1976 events from 11 space missions covering over 34 years, from December 1990 to August 2025. We have combined existing catalogs including magnetic obstacles and identified and added boundaries of an additional 807 (40.8%) events ourselves. With this catalog, we demonstrate the most extensive analysis to date of total ICME magnetic field values as a function of heliocentric distance. Parker Solar Probe has observed 6 ICMEs at $< 0.23$ au (until April 2025), and Solar Orbiter and BepiColombo have added more events near 0.3~au, bridging the major observational gap towards the solar corona. Our main result is that a single power law can describe the evolution of the mean total magnetic field (exponent value of $k=-1.57$) and maximum field ($k=-1.53$) in the magnetic obstacle (MO), from 0.07 to 5.4 au. Extending the power law to the solar photosphere reveals a strong inconsistency with magnetic field magnitudes observed in the quiet Sun and active regions by 2 and 4 orders of magnitude, respectively. We introduce a multipole-type power law with two exponents, $k_1=-1.57$, and $k_2=-6$, relating the ICME magnetic field magnitude to an average solar active region field strength. These results present important observational constraints for the evolution of ICMEs from the Sun to the heliosphere.

 - **Abstract**
 The kinematic evolution of hypercompact H II (HC H II) regions around young high-mass stars remains poorly understood due to complex interactions with parental environs. We present ALMA QUARKS/ATOMS 1.3 mm/3 mm observations (the highest resolution $\sim0.01$ pc) of a deeply embedded HC H II region (diameter $\sim0.015$ pc, electron density $\sim2\times10^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$) exhibiting a striking $\gtrsim20$ km s$^{-1}$ global redshift seen in optically thin H30$\alpha$/H40$\alpha$ recombination lines relative to its parental hot molecular core within a hub-filament system. The 1.3 mm continuum data reveal a distinct 0.1-pc arc and a perpendicular 0.04-pc tail. We propose that this morphology arises from a dynamic champagne flow: the slow expansion of HC H II region into a pre-existing filament forms the arc and associated low-velocity (few km s$^{-1}$) SiO shocks. Meanwhile, in the opposite direction ionized gas escapes along a steep density gradient traced by the tail and high-velocity (20 km s$^{-1}$) SiO emission. We reject the bow shock scenario in which ionized gas co-moves with a runaway high-mass star because shocked gas in the arc aligns with the hub velocity, contradicting the bow shock prediction. Non-LTE radiative transfer modeling further rules out infall of ionized gas as the velocity shift origin. We conclude that this exceptional HC H II region is undergoing a few-thousand-year transition phase of "hatching out of the egg": the ionized gas of HC H II region has just broken out of its parental hot core and now is flowing outward supersonically. This work highlights how anisotropic density distributions induce supersonically anisotropic ionized flows that govern HC H II region evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, a class of dormant black hole binaries with luminous companions (dBH-LC) has been observed, such as $Gaia$ BH1, BH2, and BH3. Unlike previously discovered X-ray BH binaries, this type of dBH-LC has relatively long orbital periods (typically more than several tens to a few hundred days) and shows very weak X-ray emission. Therefore, studying the formation and evolution of the whole dBH-LC population is also a very interesting problem. Our aim is to study the contribution of massive stars to the dBH-LC population under different evolutionary models (isolated binary evolution (IBE) and hierarchical triple evolution), and different formation channels (such as mass transfer, common envelope evolution). Using the Massive Objects in Binary Stellar Evolution (MOBSE) code, the Triple Stellar Evolution (TSE) code, and the latest initial multiple-star distributions, we model the populations of massive stars. Finally, we calculate the orbital properties, mass distributions, and birthrates of the BH-LC populations formed under these different conditions. In the Milky Way, we calculate that the birthrate of dBH-LC formed through IBE is about 4.35$\times$$10^{-5}$ ${\rm yr}^{-1}$, while the birthrate through triple evolution is about 1.47$\times$$10^{-3}$ ${\rm yr}^{-1}$. This means that the birthrate from triple evolution is one to two orders of magnitude higher than that from IBE. We find that in triple evolution, the main formation channel of dBH-LC is post-merger binaries formed from inner binary mergers triggered by von Zeipel$-$Lidov$-$Kozai oscillations.

 - **Abstract**
 We aim to investigate the interplay between dense molecular gas, star formation, and active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback in the luminous infrared galaxy (LIRG) NGC 1068 at sub-kiloparsec scales. We present the HCN (4-3) and HCO$^+$ (4-3) maps of NGC 1068, obtained with JCMT as part of the Mapping the dense molecular gas in the strongest star-forming galaxies (MALATANG) project, and perform spatially resolved analyses of their correlations with infrared luminosity and soft X-ray emission. Spatially resolved relations between the luminosities of infrared dust emission and dense molecular gas tracers ($L_{\rm IR}-L'_{\rm dense}$) are found to be nearly linear, without clear evidence of excess contributions from AGN activity. The spatially resolved X-ray emission ($L^{\rm gas}_{0.5-2\,\mathrm{keV}}$) displays a radially-dependent twofold correlation with the star formation rate (SFR), suggesting distinct gas-heating mechanisms between the galaxy center and the outer regions. A super-linear scaling is obtained in galactic center regions with SFR surface density ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$) $>$ 8.2 $\times$ 10$^{-6}$ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$: log($L^{\rm gas}_{0.5-2\,\mathrm{keV}}$/erg s$^{-1}$) = 2.2 log(SFR/$M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$) + 39.1. We further found a statistically significant super-linear correlation ($\beta = 1.34$ $\pm$ 0.86) between $L^{\rm gas}_{0.5-2\,\mathrm{keV}}$/SFR and HCN(4-3)/CO(1-0) intensity ratio, whereas no such trend is seen for HCO$^+$(4-3)/CO(1-0) or CO(3-2)/CO(1-0). These findings indicate that AGN feedback does not dominate star formation regulation on sub-kiloparsec scales, and that the excitation of dense gas traced by HCN (4-3) may be more directly influenced by high-energy feedback processes compared to HCO$^+$ (4-3) and CO (3-2).

 - **Abstract**
 Recent detections of very high energy (VHE; GeV-TeV) photons from gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows, most notably the extreme event GRB 221009A, require refined models that include realistic jet structures and complex circumburst environments. The jet's angular structure is crucial for shaping afterglow emission. Our recent work demonstrates that Gaussian jets, with their smooth angular decline, naturally produce early bright peaks for on-axis observers and delayed, softer, dimmer peaks at higher inclinations. The gradual decline suppresses excessive lateral expansion, unlike the sharp edge in top-hat jets, making Gaussian jets a compelling alternative to both top-hat and other structured-jet models. Here we implement a Gaussian structured-jet model to explain TeV afterglows from adiabatic forward shocks propagating in a wind-driven medium. We show that the TeV peak time and flux depend sensitively on jet geometry, kinetic energy, wind density, and on microphysical parameter ratios that scale the SSC component. We identify the afterglow parameter space that is favourable for detecting sub-TeV photons with the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), finding that only about ten per cent of simulated TeV events exceed CTA sensitivity in a wind medium. These detections arise from near core-aligned views, with high kinetic energy and wind density, moderate initial Lorentz factor and downstream magnetic field, and a relatively large fraction of energy in nonthermal electrons. Applying this model to GRB 221009A, we perform multi-band fits including wind-modified dynamics, Klein-Nishina effects, and EBL attenuation, and find that a mildly off-axis geometry reproduces the observed X-ray and GeV-TeV light curves.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a systematic investigation of long-term mid-infrared (MIR) color variability in 1,718 Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLSy1s) using 14-year \textit{WISE}/NEOWISE monitoring data. Through Pearson correlation analysis between photometric magnitude and color, we identify: (1) a radio-quiet NLSy1 (RQ-NLSy1) population comprising 230 bluer-when-brighter (BWB) sources, 131 redder-when-brighter (RWB) sources, and 1,323 objects showing weak or statistically insignificant color variations; and (2) a radio-loud NLSy1 (RL-NLSy1) population containing 5 BWBs, 2 RWBs, and 27 sources with weak/no color variations. Our analysis reveals that the BWB tendency strengthens significantly in galaxies with redder mean MIR colors $\rm \left<W1-W2\right>$ and lower starlight contamination. Furthermore, this color-change pattern demonstrates that the most bolometric luminous sources exhibit the most pronounced BWB behavior. While similar trends exist for black hole mass and Eddington ratio, bolometric luminosity appears to be the primary physical driver. Potential origins of these variations (e.g., host galaxy contribution, accretion disk variability, and dust reprocessing) are discussed. We conclude that temperature-dependent dust reprocessing dominates the observed BWB, RWB, and no/weak variation patterns. This interpretation may also apply to similar MIR color variations observed in other extragalactic MIR transients, such as tidal disruption events, ambiguous nuclear transients, and changing-look AGNs. In addition, we find no significant difference in long-term MIR color variations between RL-NLSy1s and RQ-NLSy1s, however, RL-NLSy1s show significantly greater dispersion in intrinsic variability amplitude compared to RQ-NLSy1s due to jet-induced complexity, where non-thermal synchrotron emission from relativistic jets obscures thermal dust signatures.

 - **Abstract**
 The Vera C. Rubin Observatory's 10-Year Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) is expected to produce a hundredfold increase in the number of transients we observe. However, there are insufficient spectroscopic resources to follow up on all of the wealth of targets that LSST will provide. As such it is necessary to be able to prioritise objects for followup observations or inclusion in sample studies based purely on their LSST photometry. We are particularly keen to identify tidal disruption events (TDEs) with LSST. TDEs are immensely useful for determining black hole parameters and probing our understanding of accretion physics. To assist in these efforts, we present the Many Artificial LSST Lightcurves based on the Observations of Real Nuclear transients (MALLORN) data set and the corresponding classifier challenge for identifying TDEs. MALLORN comprises 10178 simulated LSST light curves, constructed from real Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) observations of 64 TDEs, 727 nuclear supernovae and 1407 AGN with spectroscopic labels using Gaussian process fitting, empirically-motivated spectral energy distributions from SNCosmo and the baseline from the Rubin Survey Simulator. Our novel approach can be easily adapted to simulate transients for any photometric survey using observations from another, requiring only the limiting magnitudes and an estimate of the cadence of observations. The MALLORN Astronomical Classification Challenge, launched on Kaggle on 15/10/2025, will allow competitors to test their photometric classifiers on simulated LSST data to find TDEs and improve upon their capabilities prior to the start of LSST.

 - **Abstract**
 The distance to the Vela Junior supernova remnant (RX J0852.0-4622 or G266.2-1.2) has long remained uncertain, limiting our understanding of its physical properties. Using VLT/MUSE integral field spectroscopy, we uncover chemical and kinematic connections between the nebula surrounding its Central Compact Object (CXOU J085201.4-461753) and the nearby Herbig-Haro outflow of Ve 7-27 (Wray 16-30), indicating a shared nitrogen-rich, Fe-peak-enhanced environment. This link ties stellar birth and death, with the young star Ve 7-27 embedded in material expelled by Vela Junior's massive progenitor, and the remnant's blast wave is expanding through the same medium. Adopting the Gaia-based distance to Ve 7-27, we revise Vela Junior's distance to $1.41\pm0.14$ kpc. At this distance, the remnant's physical radius is $23.3\pm2.3$ pc, and X-ray proper motions of the northwestern rim correspond to shock speeds of $(2.8\pm0.7)\times10^3$ to $(5.6\pm1.5)\times10^3$ km s$^{-1}$. These imply an age of $\sim$1.6-3.3 kyr and a very low ambient density, indicating that Vela Junior is expanding within a highly rarefied wind-blown cavity carved by a massive progenitor -- consistent with the non-detection of strong thermal X-ray emission. This distance update also resolves long-standing inconsistencies, with major implications for its energy budget, particle acceleration efficiency, and compact object evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Radiation pressure on spectral lines is a promising mechanism for powering disc winds from accreting white dwarfs (AWDs) and active galactic nuclei (AGN). However, in radiation-hydrodynamic simulations, overionization reduces line opacity and quenches the line force, which suppresses outflows. Here, we show that small-scale clumping can resolve this problem. Adopting the microclumping approximation, our new simulations demonstrate that even modest volume filling factors ($f_V \sim 0.1-0.01$) can dramatically increase the wind mass-loss rate by lowering its ionization state -- raising $\dot{M}_{\rm wind}$ and yielding $\dot{M}_{\rm wind}/\dot{M}_{\rm acc}\!\gtrsim\!10^{-4}$ for such modest filling factors. Clumpy wind models produce the UV resonance lines that are absent from smooth wind models. They can also reprocess a significant fraction of the disc luminosity and thus dramatically modify the broad-band optical/UV SED. Given that theory and observations indicate that disc winds are intrinsically inhomogeneous, clumping offers a physically motivated solution. Together, these results provide the first robust, self-consistent demonstration that clumping can reconcile line-driven wind theory with observations across AWDs and AGNs.

 - **Abstract**
 Much has been learned about Galactic cosmic rays in the past decade: On the observational side, the spectra of cosmic ray nuclei have been directly measured with high precision, resolving chemical composition up to TV rigidities. At even higher rigidities, direct detection is making contact with indirect observations from air shower arrays. A number of breaks have been found in the nuclear spectrum, which was previously thought to be a pure power law up to the knee. Data from air shower arrays also show interesting features in the arrival directions of cosmic-ray nuclei. On the theoretical side, more sophisticated models are able to explain the various spectral breaks either with transitions between different classes of sources or with changes in the transport regime. Yet, it has become clear that our ignorance of the structure of the Galactic magnetic fields, both on large and small scales, is limiting precision predictions. Turning this problem into an opportunity though, we can use Galactic cosmic rays as a laboratory for the study of Galactic magnetic fields. In this review talk, delivered at the 39th International Cosmic Ray Conference (ICRC2025), I have summarised what is known about the spectrum and anisotropies of Galactic cosmic rays, what is not known yet and what can be learnt in the future.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first spatially resolved investigation of near-infrared coronal lines in dwarf galaxies hosting active galactic nuclei (AGN), using JWST/NIRSpec integral field spectroscopy. Coronal lines (CLs), which are forbidden transitions from highly ionized species with ionization potentials up to 450 eV, act as sensitive tracers of the AGN ionizing continuum and feedback processes. Across four dwarf galaxies with ionized gas outflows traced by the optical [O III] lines, we report the detection of 16 unique species of near-infrared CLs. Line ratio diagnostics indicate that photoionization from the AGN dominates the excitation of CLs. We find that the coronal line region in dwarf galaxies, traced by the various CLs, extends up to 0.5 kpc, and can constitute up to 10% of their host galaxy size. Correlations between CL luminosities and [O III] ionized gas outflow properties are consistent with a scenario in which AGN-driven outflows likely facilitate the detection of CLs and contribute to their extent. Several CLs, including [Si VI], [Si VII], and [Mg VIII], exhibit a secondary broad component (W$_{80}$ > 300 km/s). If we interpret this spatially compact gas as part of an outflow, this would indicate that the outflowing gas includes a wide range of ionizations. The estimated energetics imply this highly ionized component is compact yet powerful enough to perturb gas in the central regions of the host dwarfs. These results indicate that AGN in low-mass galaxies may produce outflows capable of influencing their structure and evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. While supernova remnants (SNRs) are observed to produce up to 1 M$_\odot$ of dust, the amount of dust destroyed by the forward shock (FS) is poorly constrained, raising the question whether they are net dust producers or destroyers. Aims. We aim to estimate the dust destruction efficiency of SNR FSs in a realistically turbulent interstellar medium (ISM) during their most destructive phase, and assess dust shielding by high density filaments during this period. Methods. We run 3D turbulence simulations for different turbulent Mach numbers (0-3) and average ISM densities (1-100 cm$^{-3}$) to resemble observations of the turbulent ISM. We then set off a supernova to trace its 3D magnetohydrodynamical evolution for 10 kyr. Finally, we run post-processing simulations to study the dust transport and destruction by the SNR FS, considering gas and plasma drag, kinetic and thermal sputtering, and grain-grain collisions, and either silicate or carbonaceous dust. Results. The dust destruction rate of the FS strongly depends on the average ISM density and turbulence strength, varying between 27-92% (0.85-11.0 M$_\odot$) in the studied 10 kyr. Overall, dust is less efficiently destroyed in a low density medium (1 cm$^{-3}$, 27-57%) than in intermediate (10 cm$^{-3}$, 46-92%) and high densities (100 cm$^{-3}$, 73-87%). The FS destroys 8-34% less dust in high Mach turbulence compared to a homogeneous medium. Furthermore, carbonaceous grains are more robust (up to 21% more) than silicates. Conclusions. Filaments can partly shield dust from destruction in the first 10 kyr, however, always more than 0.85 M$_\odot$ of dust is destroyed, making most SNRs dust sinks under the conditions explored in this work. The destruction efficiency of the SNRs with less than 1 M$_\odot$ of destroyed dust has not yet plateaued so that they are most likely also net dust destroyers by the end of their lifetime.

 - **Abstract**
 Strong gravitational lensing images are subject to shape distortions due to inhomogeneities along the line of sight. The leading order shape distortion is shear, which, if measurable, will be a complementary cosmological probe to traditional cosmic shear. In Hogg et al. (2025a), we modelled 23 of the SLACS strong lenses, studying the line-of-sight (LOS) shear under a variety of shear and mass model parametrisations. In this work, we model 27 additional lenses, extending our sample of LOS shear constraints to 45 in total. We find a mean shear magnitude of $0.11\pm 0.024$, showing that a significant fraction of the lenses modelled in this work possess LOS shears with unexpectedly large magnitudes, $|\gamma_{\rm LOS}| > 0.1$, even when an octupolar distortion is included in the lens mass. We further investigate if factors such as lens and source redshift, filter and PSF, or flux and signal-to-noise ratio in the lensed arcs correlate with shear. We find that none of these features play a statistically significant role in the production of unusually large shear magnitudes.

 - **Abstract**
 The comoving cosmic star formation rate density peaks at z~2-3, with dusty star-forming galaxies being significant contributors to this peak. These galaxies are characterized by their high star formation rates and substantial infrared luminosities. The formation mechanisms remain an open question for these galaxies, particularly with respect to how such intense levels of star formation are triggered and maintained. We aim to resolve CO(3-2) emission toward two strongly lensed galaxies, SPT0125-47 and SPT2134-50, at z~2.5-2.8 to determine their morphology and physical properties. We used high-resolution ALMA band 3 observations of CO(3-2) emission toward both sources to investigate their properties. We performed parametric and nonparametric lens modeling using the publicly available lens modeling software PyAutoLens. We divided the CO(3-2) emission line into two bins corresponding to the red and blue portions of the emission line and nonparametrically modeled the source plane emission for both bins. We performed a basic analysis of the morphology and kinematics in the source plane using nonparametric lens modeling of the red and blue bins. We found tentative evidence of a velocity gradient across both sources and no evidence of any clumpy structure, companions, or ongoing mergers. The previously calculated high star formation rates and low depletion times of both SPT0125-47 and SPT2134-50 suggest that these galaxies are undergoing a dramatic phase in their evolution. Given the lack of evidence of ongoing interactions or mergers in our source plane models, we suggest that the intense star formation was triggered by a recent interaction and/or merger. We also consider the possibility that these galaxies might be in the process of settling into disks.

 - **Abstract**
 Determining the physical properties of galaxies during the first billion years after the big bang is key to understanding both early galaxy evolution and how galaxies contributed to the epoch of reionization. We present deep ALMA observations of the redshifted [OIII] 88um line for the gravitationally lensed ($\mu = 11.4\pm1.9$) galaxy A383-5.1 (z=6.027) that has previously been detected in [CII] 158um. Recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) imaging identified this sub-L* galaxy as a ''Little Red Dot'' (LRD). With a line luminosity of $L_{\rm [OIII]} = (1.29\pm0.24)\times10^8$ L$_\odot$ (corrected for lensing magnification) A383-5.1 is one of the faintest galaxies with combined [CII] and [OIII] detections. The ALMA data reveal no dust continuum emission, consistent with previous observations. The high line luminosity ratio of [OIII]/[CII] $\sim 14\pm5$ is consistent with A383-5.1 being low-metallicity and dust-poor. The non-detection of dust continuum in bands 6 and 8 is consistent with the high [OIII]/[CII] ratio and suggests a presence of a strong ultraviolet radiation field, which would be less affect by dust attenuation, implying that galaxies of this type could contribute significantly to the ionization of the intergalactic medium. The presence of strong ionizing field could provide an important piece of information for understanding the nature of LRDs and their role in cosmic reionization.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on new orbit-minimum photometry and revised radial-velocity fitting that provide an improved measurement of the mass of the neutron star (NS) in pulsar PSR~J0952$-$0607 at $M_NS = 2.35\pm 0.11 M_\odot$. With its fast spin and unusually low magnetic field, this NS has evidently experienced unusual evolution, likely connected with its high mass, which is now $2.5\sigma$ above that of the heaviest pulsar with a white dwarf companion, as measured by Shapiro delay techniques. By tightening the mass measurement, we also raise the maximum (commonly called Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff) NS mass to $M_{\rm TOV} > 2.27\,M_\odot$$(2.12\,M_\odot)$ at $1\sigma$$(3\sigma)$ confidence, which improves bounds on the dense-matter equation of state. While the statistical error decreases and systematic issues should be modest, uncertainties remain; we comment briefly on these factors and prospects for further improvement.
