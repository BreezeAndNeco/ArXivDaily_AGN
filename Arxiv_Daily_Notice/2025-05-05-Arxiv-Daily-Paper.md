 - **Abstract**
 Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) have recently found strong evidence for low-frequency gravitational waves (GWs) in the nanohertz frequency regime. As GWs pass, they produce deviations in measured lengths and light-travel times. PTA experiments utilize the highly-consistent radio bursts from millisecond pulsars, distributed throughout the local galaxy, to identify miniscule timing deviations indicative of GWs. To distinguish GWs from noise, PTAs search for a particular correlation pattern between different pulsars called Hellings & Downs correlations. The type of GW signal that has recently been identified is a stochastic GW background (GWB), which is observed to have more power at lower GW frequencies. A GWB matching these observations has long been predicted from super-massive black-hole (SMBH) binaries. SMBHs are known to exist in the centers of galaxies, which can then form binaries when two SMBHs are brought together following the merger of galaxies. No example of an SMBH binary has confidently been identified to date, and tremendous uncertainties about their formation and evolution remain. Alternative sources of the GWB have also been proposed, based on models for new fundamental physics, particularly in the early Universe. Improved sensitivity of PTAs will eventual lead to the characterization of GWB anisotropy and constraints on GWs from individual SMBH binaries, either of which could definitively demonstrate the true origin of the GWB. If the source is SMBH binaries, a variety of electromagnetic counterparts are possible, allowing for multimessenger astrophysics with low-frequency GWs.

 - **Abstract**
 The convectively driven, weakly magnetized regions of the solar photosphere dominate the Sun's surface at any given time, but the temporal variations of these quiet regions of the photosphere throughout the solar cycle are still not well known. To look for cycle-dependent changes in the convective properties of quiet Sun photosphere, we use high spatial and spectral resolution spectropolarimetric observations obtained by the Hinode Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) and apply the Spectropolarimetric Inversions Based on Response Functions (SIR) code to infer physical conditions in the lower solar photosphere. Using a homogeneous set of 49 datasets, all taken at disk center, we analyze the temperature stratification and the line-of-sight velocities of the granules and intergranules over a period of 15 years. We use a k-means clustering technique applied to the spectral profiles to segment the granules and intergranules based on both intensity and velocity. We also examine the profile bisectors of these different structures and compare these to past analyses. Our results show fairly constant properties over this period with no clear dependence on the solar cycle. We do, however, find a slight increase in the photospheric temperature gradient during the declining phase of the solar cycle. Our findings could have significant implications for understanding the coupling between the quiet Sun atmosphere and the global solar dynamo.

 - **Abstract**
 Faraday rotation measurements of extragalactic radio sources occulted by the solar corona serve as a powerful complementary tool for probing the pre-eruption electron density and magnetic field structure. These measurements thereby allow us to refine predictions from global MHD models. In this paper, we discuss our recent study of the morphological evolution of a CME-driven shock event that occurred on August 3, 2012. Our analysis used white-light coronagraphic observations from three different vantage points in space (SOHO and STEREO A and B). Obtaining data from these spacecraft, we derived key parameters such as the radius of curvature of the driving flux rope, the shock speed, and the standoff distance from the CMEs' leading edge. A notable feature of this event was the availability of rare Faraday rotation measurements of a group of extragalactic radio sources occulted by the solar corona, which were obtained a few hours before the eruption. These observations from the VLA radio interferometer provide independent information on the integrated product of the line-of-sight magnetic field component and electron density. By modeling the shock standoff distance and using constraints from the Faraday rotation measurements, we achieve a high level of agreement between the fast-mode Mach number predicted by the Magnetohydrodynamic Algorithm outside a Sphere (MAS) code in its thermodynamic mode and the value deduced from the analysis of the 3D reconstruction of coronagraphic data, provided that appropriate correction factors (f_b = 2.4 and f_n = 0.5) are applied in advance to scale the simulated magnetic field and electron density, respectively. Our results are consistent with previous estimates and provide critical information for fine-tuning future MHD simulations.
#### Meteoroid rotation and quasi-periodic brightness variation of meteor light curves

 - **Abstract**
 Meteor light curves are sometimes known to display flickering: rapid, quasi-periodic variations in brightness. This effect is generally attributed to the rotational modulation of the ablation rate, which is caused by the time-varying cross section area presented by a nonspherical rotating meteoroid to the oncoming airflow. In this work we investigate the effects that the rotation of a meteoroid of given shape (spherical, cubic, or cylindrical) has on the meteor's light curve, given state-of-the-art experimental laboratory estimates of the drag and lift coefficients of hypersonic flow (Mach number > 5) around various shaped objects. The meteoroid's shape is important in determining these two forces, due to the different response of the drag and lift coefficients according to the angle of attack. As a case study, the model was applied to a fireball observed on 2018 April 17 by the PRISMA network, a system of all-sky cameras that achieves a systematic monitoring of meteors and fireballs in the skies over the Italian territory. The results show that this methodology is potentially able to yield a powerful diagnostic of the rotation rate of meteoroids prior to their encounter with the atmosphere, while also providing essential information on their pre-fall actual shapes.

 - **Abstract**
 In the recent sixth data release (DR6) of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) collaboration, the value of $n_{\rm s}=0.9743 \pm 0.0034$ for the scalar spectral index is reported, which excludes the Starobinsky and Higgs inflationary models at $2\sigma$ level. In this paper, we perform a Bayesian inference of the parameters of the Starobinsky or Higgs inflationary model with non-instantaneous reheating using the Markov chain Monte Carlo method. For the analysis, we use observational data on the cosmic microwave background collected by the Planck and ACT collaborations and on baryonic acoustic oscillations from the DESI collaboration. The reheating stage is modelled by a single parameter $R_{\rm reh}$. Using the modified Boltzmann code CLASS and the cobaya software with the GetDist package, we perform a direct inference of the model parameter space and obtain their posterior distributions. Using the Kullback--Leibler divergence, we estimate the information gain from the data, yielding $2.52$ bits for the reheating parameter. Inclusion of the ACT DR6 data provides $75\%$ more information about the reheating stage compared to analysis without ACT data. We draw constraints on the reheating temperature and the average equation of state. While the former can vary within $10$ orders of magnitude, values in the $95\,\%$ credible interval indicate a sufficiently low reheating temperature; for the latter there is a clear preference for values greater than $0.5$, which means that the conventional equations of state for dust $\omega=0$ and relativistic matter $\omega=1/3$ are excluded with more than $2\sigma$ level of significance. However, there still is a big part of parameter space where Starobinsky and Higgs inflationary models exhibit a high degree of consistency with the latest observational data, particularly from ACT DR6. Therefore, it is premature to reject these models.

 - **Abstract**
 The magneto-rotational instability (MRI) is widely believed to play a central role in generating large-scale, poloidal magnetic fields during binary neutron star mergers. However, the few simulations that begin with a weak seed magnetic field and capture its growth until saturation predominantly show the effects of small-scale turbulence and winding, but lack convincing evidence of MRI activity. In this work, we investigate how the MRI is affected by the complex magnetic field topologies characteristic of the post-merger phase, aiming to assess the actual feasibility of MRI in such environments. We first derive the MRI instability criterion, as well as expressions for the characteristic wavelength and growth timescale of the fastest-growing modes, under conditions that include significant magnetic field gradients. Our analysis reveals that strong radial magnetic field gradients can impact significantly on the MRI, slowing its growth or suppressing it entirely if large enough. We then apply this extended framework to both idealized analytical disk models and data from a numerical relativity simulation of a long-lived neutron star merger remnant. We find that conditions favourable to MRI growth on astrophysically relevant timescales may occur only in limited regions of the post-merger disk, and only at late times $t\gtrsim 100$ ms after the merger. These results suggest that the MRI plays a limited role in amplifying poloidal magnetic fields in post-merger environments during the first $\mathcal{O}(100)$ms.
