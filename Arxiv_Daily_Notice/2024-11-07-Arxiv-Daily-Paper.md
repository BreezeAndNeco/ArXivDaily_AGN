 - **Abstract**
 Both detailed and rapid population studies alike predict that binary black hole (BHBH) formation is orders of magnitude more efficient at low metallicity than high metallicity, while binary neutron star (NSNS) formation remains mostly flat with metallicity, and black hole-neutron star (BHNS) mergers show intermediate behavior. This finding is a key input to employ double compact objects as tracers of low-metallicity star formation, as spectral sirens, and for merger rate calculations. Yet, the literature offers various (sometimes contradicting) explanations for these trends. We investigate the dominant cause for the metallicity dependence of double compact object formation. We find that the BHBH formation efficiency at low metallicity is set by initial condition distributions, and conventional simulations suggest that about one in eight interacting binary systems with sufficient mass to form black holes will lead to a merging BHBH. We further find that the significance of metallicities in double compact object formation is a question of formation channel. The stable mass transfer and chemically homogeneous evolution channels mainly diminish at high metallicities due to changes in stellar radii, while the common envelope channel is primarily impacted by the combined effects of stellar winds and mass-scaled natal kicks. Outdated giant wind prescriptions exacerbate the latter effect, suggesting BHBH formation may be much less metallicity dependent than previously assumed. NSNS formation efficiency remains metallicity independent as they form exclusively through the common envelope channel, with natal kicks that are uncorrelated with mass. Forthcoming GW observations will provide valuable constraints on these findings

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of the tight scaling relation between the mass of supermassive black holes (SMBHs; $M_{\rm BH}$) and their host-galaxy properties remains unclear. Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) probe phases of ongoing SMBH growth and offer the only opportunity to measure $M_{\rm BH}$ beyond the local Universe. However, determining AGN host galaxy stellar velocity dispersion $\sigma_\star$, and their galaxy dynamical masses $M_{\rm dyn}$, is complicated by AGN contamination, aperture effects and different host galaxy morphologies. We select a sample of AGNs for which $M_{\rm BH}$ has been independently determined to high accuracy by state-of-the-art techniques: dynamical modeling of the reverberation signal and spatially resolving the broad-line region with VLTI/GRAVITY. Using IFU observations, we spatially map the host galaxy stellar kinematics across the galaxy and bulge effective radii. We find that that the dynamically hot component of galaxy disks correlates with $M_{\rm BH}$; however, the correlations are tightest for aperture-integrated $\sigma_\star$ measured across the bulge. Accounting for the different $M_{\rm BH}$ distributions, we demonstrate - for the first time - that AGNs follow the same $M_{\rm BH}$-$\sigma_\star$ and $M_{\rm BH}$-$M_{\rm bulge, dyn}$ relations as quiescent galaxies. We confirm that the classical approach of determining the virial factor as sample-average, yielding ${\rm log }f= 0.65 \pm 0.18$, is consistent with the average $f$ from individual measurements. The similarity between the underlying scaling relations of AGNs and quiescent galaxies implies that the current AGN phase is too short to have altered BH masses on a population level. These results strengthen the local calibration of $f$ for measuring single-epoch $M_{\rm BH}$ in the distant Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Multi-messenger (MM) observations of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers provide a promising approach to trace the distance-redshift relation, crucial for understanding the expansion history of the Universe and, consequently, testing the nature of Dark Energy (DE). While the gravitational wave (GW) signal offers a direct measure of the distance to the source, high-energy observatories can detect the electromagnetic counterpart and drive the optical follow-up providing the redshift of the host galaxy. In this work, we exploit up-to-date catalogs of $\gamma$-ray bursts (GRBs) supposedly coming from BNS mergers observed by the Fermi $\gamma$-ray Space Telescope and the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, to construct a large set of mock MM data. We explore how combinations of current and future generations of GW observatories operating under various underlying cosmological models would be able to detect GW signals from these GRBs. We achieve the reconstruction of the GW parameters by means of a novel prior-informed Fisher matrix approach. We then use these mock data to perform an agnostic reconstruction of the DE phenomenology, thanks to a machine learning method based on forward modeling and Gaussian Processes (GP). Our study highlights the paramount importance of observatories capable of detecting GRBs and identifying their redshift. In the best-case scenario, the GP constraints are 1.5 times more precise than those produced by classical parametrizations of the DE evolution. We show that, in combination with forthcoming cosmological surveys, fewer than 40 GW-GRB detections will enable unprecedented precision on $H_\mathrm{0}$ and $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$, and accurately reconstruct the DE density evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 We present supernova (SN) 2023ufx, a unique Type IIP SN with the shortest known plateau duration ($t_\mathrm{PT}$ $\sim$47 days), a luminous V-band peak ($M_{V}$ = $-$18.42 $\pm$ 0.08 mag), and a rapid early decline rate ($s1$ = 3.47 $\pm$ 0.09 mag (50 days)$^{-1}$). By comparing observed photometry to a hydrodynamic MESA+STELLA model grid, we constrain the progenitor to be a massive red supergiant with M$_\mathrm{ZAMS}$ $\simeq$19 - 25 M$_{\odot}$. Independent comparisons with nebular spectral models also suggest an initial He-core mass of $\sim$6 M$_{\odot}$, and thus a massive progenitor. For a Type IIP, SN 2023ufx produced an unusually high amount of nickel ($^{56}$Ni) $\sim$0.14 $\pm$ 0.02 M$_{\odot}$, during the explosion. We find that the short plateau duration in SN 2023ufx can be explained with the presence of a small hydrogen envelope (M$_\mathrm{H_\mathrm{env}}$ $\simeq$1.2 M$_{\odot}$), suggesting partial stripping of the progenitor. About $\simeq$0.09 M$_{\odot}$ of CSM through mass loss from late-time stellar evolution of the progenitor is needed to fit the early time ($\lesssim$10 days) pseudo-bolometric light curve. Nebular line diagnostics of broad and multi-peak components of [O I] $\lambda\lambda$6300, 6364, H$\alpha$, and [Ca II] $\lambda \lambda$7291, 7323 suggest that the explosion of SN 2023ufx could be inherently asymmetric, preferentially ejecting material along our line-of-sight.

 - **Abstract**
 Next-generation gravitational wave detectors are expected to detect millions of compact binary mergers across cosmological distances. The features of the mass distribution of these mergers, combined with gravitational wave distance measurements, will enable precise cosmological inferences, even without the need for electromagnetic counterparts. However, achieving accurate results requires modeling the mass spectrum, particularly considering possible redshift evolution. Binary neutron star (BNS) mergers are thought to be less influenced by changes in metallicity compared to binary black holes (BBH) or neutron star-black hole (NSBH) mergers. This stability in their mass spectrum over cosmic time reduces the chances of introducing biases in cosmological parameters caused by redshift evolution. In this study, we use the population synthesis code COMPAS to generate astrophysically motivated catalogs of BNS mergers and explore whether assuming a non-evolving BNS mass distribution with redshift could introduce biases in cosmological parameter inference. Our findings demonstrate that, despite large variations in the BNS mass distribution across binary physics assumptions and initial conditions in COMPAS, the mass function remains redshift-independent, allowing a 2% unbiased constraint on the Hubble constant - sufficient to address the Hubble tension. Additionally, we show that in the fiducial COMPAS setup, the bias from a non-evolving BNS mass model is less than 0.5% for the Hubble parameter measured at redshift 0.4. These results establish BNS mergers as strong candidates for spectral siren cosmology in the era of next-generation gravitational wave detectors.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxies obey a set of strict dynamical laws, which imply a close coupling between the visible matter (stars and gas) and the observed dynamics (set by dark matter in the standard cosmological context). Here we review recent results from weak gravitational lensing, which allows studying the empirical laws of galaxy dynamics out to exceedingly large radii in both late-type galaxies (LTGs) and early-type galaxies (ETGs). We focus on three laws: (1) the circular velocity curves of both LTGs and ETGs remain indefinitely flat out to several hundreds of kpc; (2) the same baryonic Tully-Fisher relation is followed by LTGs and ETGs; (3) the same radial acceleration relation (RAR) is followed by LTGs and ETGs. Combining galaxy data with Solar System data, the RAR covers about 16 orders of magnitude in the Newtonian baryonic acceleration. Remarkably, these empirical facts were predicted a priori by MOND.

 - **Abstract**
 Star clusters stand at the crossroads between galaxies and single stars. Resolving the formation of star clusters in cosmological simulations represents an ambitious and challenging goal, since modelling their internal properties requires very high resolution. This paper is the third of a series within the SImulating the Environment where Globular clusters Emerged (SIEGE) project, where we conduct zoom-in cosmological simulations with sub-parsec resolution that include the feedback of individual stars, aimed to model the formation of star clusters in high-redshift proto-galaxies. We investigate the role of three fundamental quantities in shaping the intrinsic properties of star clusters, i. e., i) pre-supernova stellar feedback (continuous or instantaneous ejection of mass and energy through stellar winds); ii) star formation efficiency, defined as the fraction of gas converted into stars per freefall time, for which we test 2 different values (epsi_ff=0.1 and 1), and iii) stellar initial mass function (IMF, standard vs top-heavy). All our simulations are run down to z=10.5, which is sufficient for investigating some structural properties of the emerging clumps and clusters. [Abridged] The prescription for a continuous, low-intensity feedback, along with the adoption of epsi_ff=1, produces star clusters with maximum stellar density values up to 10^4 M_sun pc^(-2), in good agreement with the surface density-size relation observed in local young star clusters (YSCs). Therefore, a realistic stellar wind description and a high star formation effiency are the key ingredients that allow us to achieve realistic star clusters characterised by properties comparable to those of local YSCs. In contrast, the other models produce too diffuse clusters, in particular the one with a top-heavy IMF.

 - **Abstract**
 Radio-to-$\gamma$-ray signals, recently found narrowly confined near the characteristic $2.4R_{500}$ scaled radii of galaxy clusters and groups, have been associated with their virial (structure-formation accretion) shocks based on spectro-spatial characteristics. By stacking high-latitude GMIMS radio data around MCXC galaxy clusters, we identify ($3\sigma$-$4\sigma$) excess radially-polarized emission at the exact same scaled radius, providing directional support, and indicating tangential magnetic fields induced by the shocked inflow. The results suggest a strong mass dependence, a flat energy spectrum, and a high polarization fraction, consistent with synchrotron emission from electrons accelerated by strong virial shocks. The narrow radial range of such stacked virial-shock signals suggests that although the shocks are theorized to have diverse, irregular morphologies, they share similar $\sim 2.4R_{500}$ minimal radii.

 - **Abstract**
 Nearly all star clusters younger than ~600 Myr exhibit extended main sequence turn offs and split main sequences (MSs) in their color-magnitude diagrams. Works based on both photometry and spectroscopy have firmly demonstrated that the red MS is composed of fast-rotating stars, whereas blue MS stars are slow rotators. Nevertheless, the mechanism responsible for the formation of stellar populations with varying rotation rates remains a topic of debate. Potential mechanisms proposed for the split MS include binary interactions, early evolution of pre-main sequence stars, and the merging of binary systems, but a general consensus has yet to be reached. These formation scenarios predict different fractions of binaries among blue- and red-MS stars. Therefore, studying the binary populations can provide valuable constraints that may help clarify the origins of the split MSs. We use high-precision photometry from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) to study the binaries of three young Magellanic star clusters exhibiting split MS, namely NGC 1818, NGC 1850, and NGC 2164. By analyzing the photometry in the F225W, F275W, F336W, and F814W filters for observed binaries and comparing it to a large sample of simulated binaries, we determine the fractions of binaries within the red and the blue MS. We find that the fractions of binaries among the blue MS are higher than those of red-MS stars by a factor of ~1.5, 4.6, and ~1.9 for NGC 1818, NGC 1850, and NGC 2164, respectively. We discuss these results in the context of the formation scenarios of the split MS.

 - **Abstract**
 The presence of a strong, large-scale magnetic field in an accretion flow leads to extraction of the rotational energy of the black hole (BH) through the Blandford-Znajek (BZ) process, believed to power relativistic jets in various astrophysical sources. We study rotational energy extraction from a BH surrounded by a highly magnetized thin disk by performing a set of 3D global GRMHD simulations. We find that the saturated flux threading the BH has a weaker dependence on BH spin, compared to highly magnetized hot (geometrically thick) accretion flows. Also, we find that only a fraction ($10-70$ per cent) of the extracted BZ power is channeled into the jet, depending on the spin parameter. The remaining energy is potentially used to launch winds or contribute to the radiative output of the disk or corona. Our simulations reveal that the presence of a strong magnetic field enhances the radiative efficiency of the disk, making it more luminous than its weakly magnetized counterpart or the standard disk model. We attribute this excess luminosity primarily to the enhanced magnetic dissipation in the intra-ISCO region. Our findings have implications for understanding X-ray corona formation and black hole spin measurements, and interpreting black hole transient phenomena.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyse the energy spectral density properties of Gravitational waves from Galactic binary populations in the~\text{mHz} band targeted by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna mission. Our analysis is based on combining BPASS with a Milky Way analogue galaxy from the Feedback In Realistic Environment (FIRE) simulations and the GWs these populations emit. Our investigation compares different functional forms of gravitational wave (GW) ESDs, namely the single power-law, broken power-law, and single-peak models, revealing disparities within and among Galactic binary populations. We estimate the ESDs for six different Galactic binary populations and the ESD of the total Galactic binary population for LISA. Employing a single power-law model, we predict a total Galactic binary GW signal amplitude $\alpha$ = $2.0^{+0.2}_{-0.2} \times 10^{-8}$ and a slope $\beta$ = $-2.64 ^{+0.03}_{-0.04}$ and the ESD $\rm h^2 \Omega_{GW}$ = $1.1 ^{+0.1}_{-0.1} \times 10^{-9}$ at 3~\text{mHz}. For the Galactic WDB binary GW signal $\alpha = 1^{+0.02}_{-0.02} \times 10^{-10}$, $\beta = -1.56 ^{+0.03}_{-0.03}$ and $\rm h^2 \Omega_{GW} = 18 ^{+1}_{-1} \times 10^{-12}$. Our analysis underscores the importance of accurate noise parameter estimation and highlights the complexities of modelling realistic observations, prompting future exploration into more flexible models.

 - **Abstract**
 We present simultaneous X-ray and spectral ultraviolet (UV) observations of strikingly-coherent oscillations in emission from a coronal looptop and fan structure, during the impulsive phase of a long-duration M-class solar flare. The 50 s oscillations are observed near in-phase by Solar Orbiter/STIX, GOES, and IRIS Fe XXI intensity, Doppler and non-thermal velocity. For over 5 minutes of their approximate 35 minute duration, the oscillations are so periodic (2-sigma above the power law background), that they are better described as 'periodic pulsations' than the more-widely documented 'quasi-periodic pulsations' often observed during solar flares. By combining time-series analysis of the the multi-instrument datasets with comparison to MHD simulations, we attribute the oscillations to the magnetic tuning fork in the flare looptop-fan region, and betatron acceleration within the lower-altitude flare loops. These interpretations are possible due to the introduced 'Sliding Raster Method' (SliRM) for analysis of slit spectrometer (e.g. IRIS) raster data, to increase the temporal cadence of the observations at the expense of spatial information.

 - **Abstract**
 Surface temperature distribution is crucial for thermal property-based studies about irregular asteroids in our Solar System. While direct numerical simulations could model surface temperatures with high fidelity, they often take a significant amount of computational time, especially for problems where temperature distributions are required to be repeatedly calculated. To this end, deep operator neural network (DeepONet) provides a powerful tool due to its high computational efficiency and generalization ability. In this work, we applied DeepONet to the modelling of asteroid surface temperatures. Results show that the trained network is able to predict temperature with an accuracy of ~1% on average, while the computational cost is five orders of magnitude lower, hence enabling thermal property analysis in a multidimensional parameter space. As a preliminary application, we analyzed the orbital evolution of asteroids through direct N-body simulations embedded with instantaneous Yarkovsky effect inferred by DeepONet-based thermophysical this http URL asteroids (3200) Phaethon and (89433) 2001 WM41 as examples, we show the efficacy and efficiency of our AI-based approach.

 - **Abstract**
 James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed a population of red and compact sources at $z \gtrsim 5$ known as "Little Red Dots" (LRDs) that are likely active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Here we present a comprehensive study of the variability of 314 LRDs with multi-epoch JWST observations in five deep fields: UDS, GOODS-S, GOODS-N, Abell 2744, and COSMOS. Our analyses use all publicly available JWST NIRCam imaging data in these fields, together with multi-epoch JWST MIRI images available. We measure the significance of the variabilities (signal-to-noise ratio or ${\rm SNR}_{\rm var}$) for all LRDs and statistically evaluate their variabilities using the ${\rm SNR}_{\rm var}$ distributions. We pay particular attention to the systematic offsets of photometric zero points among different epochs that seem to commonly exist. The derived ${\rm SNR}_{\rm var}$ distributions of the LRDs, including those with broad H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ emission lines, follow the standard Gaussian distribution, and are generally consistent with those of the comparison samples of objects detected in the same images. This finding suggests that the LRD population on average does not show strong variability, which can be due to super-Eddington accretion of the black holes in AGNs. Alternatively, they are dominated by galaxies. We also find eight strongly variable LRD candidates with variability amplitudes of 0.24 - 0.82 mag. The rest-frame optical SEDs of these variable LRDs should have significant AGN contribution. Future JWST observations will provide more variability information of LRDs.

 - **Abstract**
 The time lag between soft and hard X-ray photons has been observed in many active galactic nuclei (AGN) and can reveal the accretion process and geometry around supermassive black holes (SMBHs). High-frequency Fe K and soft lags are considered to originate from the light-travel distances between the corona and the accretion disk, while the propagation of the inward mass accretion fluctuation usually explains the low-frequency hard lags. Ultra-fast outflows (UFOs), with a velocity range of 0.03-0.3c, have also been discovered in numerous AGN and are believed to be launched from the inner accretion disk. However, it remains unclear whether UFOs can affect the X-ray time lags. As a pilot work, we aim to investigate the potential influence of UFOs on X-ray time lags of AGN in a small sample. By performing the UFO-resolved Fourier spectral timing analysis of archival XMM-Newton observations of three AGN with transient UFOs: PG 1448+273, IRAS 13224-3809, and PG 1211+143, we compare their X-ray timing products, such as lag-frequency and lag-energy spectra, of observations with and without UFO obscuration. Our results find that in each AGN, low-frequency hard lags become weak or even disappear when they are accompanied by UFOs. In the high-frequency domain, soft lags remain unchanged while the Fe K reverberation lags tentatively disappear. The comparison between timing products of low- and high-flux observations on another three AGN without UFOs (Ark 564, NGC 7469, and Mrk 335) suggests that the disappearance of low-frequency hard lags is likely related to the emergence of UFOs, not necessarily related to the source flux. We conclude that the presence of UFOs can affect X-ray time lags of AGN by suppressing the low-frequency hard lags, which can be explained by an additional time delay introduced by UFOs or disk accretion energy carried away by UFOs.

 - **Abstract**
 The UV-optical variability of quasars appears to depend on black-hole mass $M_{\rm BH}$ through physical timescales in the accretion disc. Here, we calculate mean emission radii, $R_{\rm mean}$, and orbital timescales, $t_{\rm orb}$, of thin accretion disc models as a function of emission wavelength from 1000 to 10000 Angstrom, $M_{\rm BH}$ from $10^6$ to $10^{11}$ solar masses, and Eddington ratios from 0.01 to 1. At low $M_{\rm BH}$, we find the textbook behaviour of $t_{\rm orb}\propto M_{\rm BH}^{-1/2}$ alongside $R_{\rm mean} \approx$ const, while towards higher masses the growing event horizon imposes $R_{\rm mean} \propto M_{\rm BH}$ and thus a turnover into $t_{\rm orb}\propto M_{\rm BH}$. We fit smoothly broken power laws to the numerical results and provide analytic convenience functions for $R_{\rm mean}(\lambda,M_{\rm BH},L_{3000})$ and $t_{\rm orb}(\lambda,M_{\rm BH},L_{3000})$ in terms of the observables $\lambda$, $M_{\rm BH}$, and the monochromatic luminosity $L_{3000}$. We then calculate variability structure functions for the ~2200 brightest quasars in the sky with estimates for $M_{\rm BH}$ and $L_{3000}$, using lightcurves from NASA/ATLAS orange passband spanning more than 7 years. The median luminosity of the accretion disc sample is $\log L_{\rm bol}/(\mathrm{erg\,s}^{-1})\approx 47$ and the median $\log M_{\rm BH}/M_\odot\approx 9.35$. At this high mass, the theoretical mass dependence of disc timescales levels off and turns over. The data show a weak dependence of variability on $M_{\rm BH}$ consistent with the turnover and a model where disc timescale drives variability amplitudes in the form $\log A/A_0=1/2\times\Delta t/t_{\rm orb}$, as suggested before. In the future, if the black-hole mass is known, observations of variability might be used as diagnostics of the physical luminosity in accretion discs, and therefore constrain inclination or dust extinction.

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce NEOviz, an interactive visualization system designed to assist planetary defense experts in the visual analysis of the movements of near-Earth objects in the Solar System that might prove hazardous to Earth. Asteroids are often discovered using optical telescopes and their trajectories are calculated from images, resulting in an inherent asymmetric uncertainty in their position and velocity. Consequently, we typically cannot determine the exact trajectory of an asteroid, and an ensemble of trajectories must be generated to estimate an asteroid's movement over time. When propagating these ensembles over decades, it is challenging to visualize the varying paths and determine their potential impact on Earth, which could cause catastrophic damage. NEOviz equips experts with the necessary tools to effectively analyze the existing catalog of asteroid observations. In particular, we present a novel approach for visualizing the 3D uncertainty region through which an asteroid travels, while providing accurate spatial context in relation to system-critical infrastructure such as Earth, the Moon, and artificial satellites. Furthermore, we use NEOviz to visualize the divergence of asteroid trajectories, capturing high-variance events in an asteroid's orbital properties. For potential impactors, we combine the 3D visualization with an uncertainty-aware impact map to illustrate the potential risks to human populations. NEOviz was developed with continuous input from members of the planetary defense community through a participatory design process. It is exemplified in three real-world use cases and evaluated via expert feedback interviews.

 - **Abstract**
 Measurement of a jet geometry transition region is an important instrument of assessing the jet ambient medium properties, plasma bulk motion acceleration, parameters of a black hole and location of a jet launching radius. In this work we explore the possibility of a presence of a core shift break, associated with the geometry and jet physical properties transition. We obtain the relations on the core shift offset jump due to a change in a core shift exponent. The condition of a proper frame magnetic field continuity and the core shift break can be used as an instrument to refine the magnetic field estimates upstream the break. This method is applied to the jet in NGC 315. We speculate that the localised in a flow plasma heating either by reconnection or due to particles acceleration at the shock will also lead to a core shift break, but of a different type, than the one observed in NGC 315. We propose to use the multi-frequency core shift measurements to increase the number of sources with a detected jet shape break and to boost the accuracy of assessing the properties of a jet geometry transition region.

 - **Abstract**
 We combine new and archival MUSE observations with data from the MeerKAT Fornax Survey and the ALMA Fornax Cluster Survey to study the ionised, atomic, and molecular gas in six gas-rich dwarf galaxies in the Fornax cluster in detail. We compare the distributions and velocity fields of the three gas phases with each other, with MUSE white-light images, and with the stellar velocity fields. Additionally, we derive the resolved molecular Kennicutt-Schmidt relation for each object, and compare these with existing relations for field galaxies and for the Fornax and Virgo clusters. Finally, we explore global measurements such as gas deficiencies and star formation rates to paint as complete a picture of their evolutionary state as possible. We find that all six gas-rich dwarf galaxies have very disturbed ISM, with all three gas phases being irregular both in terms of spatial distribution and velocity field. Most objects lie well below the Kennicutt-Schmidt relations from the literature. Furthermore, they are quite deficient in HI (with def_HI between ~1 and ~2 dex), and moderately deficient in H2 (with def_H2 between ~0 and ~1), suggesting that, while both cold gas phases are affected simultaneously, HI is removed in significant quantities before H2. We suggest that these dwarfs are on their first infall into the cluster, and are in the process of transitioning from star-forming to passive. A combination of tidal interactions, mergers/pre-processing, and ram pressure stripping is likely responsible for these transformations.

 - **Abstract**
 The eXTP mission is a major project of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), with a large involvement of Europe. Its scientific payload includes four instruments: SFA, PFA, LAD and WFM. They offer an unprecedented simultaneous wide-band Xray timing and polarimetry sensitivity. A large European consortium is contributing to the eXTP study, both for the science and the instrumentation. Europe is expected to provide two of the four instruments: LAD and WFM; the LAD is led by Italy and the WFM by Spain. The WFM for eXTP is based on the design originally proposed for the LOFT ESA M3 mission, that underwent a Phase A feasibility study. It will be a wide field of view X-ray monitor instrument working in the 2-50 keV energy range, achieved with large-area Silicon Drift Detectors (SDDs), similar to the ones used for the LAD but with better spatial resolution. The WFM will consist of 3 pairs of coded mask cameras with a total combined field of view (FoV) of 90x180 degrees at zero response and a source localisation accuracy of ~1 arc min. The main goal of the WFM is to provide triggers for the target of opportunity observations of the SFA, PFA and LAD, in order to perform the core science programme, dedicated to the study of matter under extreme conditions of density, gravity and magnetism. In addition, the unprecedented combination of large field of view and imaging capability, down to 2 keV, of the WFM will allow eXTP to make important discoveries of the variable and transient X-ray sky, and provide X-ray coverage of a broad range of astrophysical objects covered under 'observatory science', such as gamma-ray bursts, fast radio bursts, gravitational wave electromagnetic counterparts. In this paper we provide an overview of the WFM instrument, explaining its design, configuration, and anticipated performance.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents near-infrared spectropolarimetric and velocimetric observations of the young planet-hosting T Tauri star PDS 70, collected with SPIRou at the 3.6m Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope from 2020 to 2024. Clear Zeeman signatures from magnetic fields at the surface of PDS 70 are detected in our data set of 40 circularly polarized spectra. Longitudinal fields inferred from Zeeman signatures, ranging from -116 to 176 G, are modulated on a timescale of 3.008$\pm$0.006 d, confirming that this is the rotation period of PDS 70. Applying Zeeman-Doppler imaging to subsets of unpolarized and circularly polarised line profiles, we show that PDS 70 hosts low-contrast brightness spots and a large-scale magnetic field in its photosphere, featuring in particular a dipole component of strength 200-420 G that evolves on a timescale of months. From the broadening of spectral lines, we also infer that PDS 70 hosts a small-scale field of 2.51$\pm$0.12 kG. Radial velocities derived from unpolarized line profiles are rotationally modulated as well, and exhibit additional longer-term chromatic variability, most likely attributable to magnetic activity rather than to a close-in giant planet (with a 3sigma upper limit on its minimum mass of ~4 Mjup at a distance of ~0.2 au). We finally confirm that accretion occurs at the surface of PDS 70, generating modulated red-shifted absorption in the 1083.3-nm He i triplet, and show that the large-scale magnetic field, often strong enough to disrupt the inner accretion disc up to the corotation radius, weakens as the star gets fainter and redder (as in 2022), suggesting that dust from the disc more easily penetrates the stellar magnetosphere in such phases.

 - **Abstract**
 Gigahertz Peaked Spectrum (GPS) and Compact Steep Spectrum (CSS) sources are compact radio galaxies (RGs), with jets extending up to 20 kpc and ages <10^3 years. They are considered to have evolved into Fanaroff-Riley RGs, but the real scenario to explain the compact sources remains unsolved. The young compact jets make GPS/CSS ideal for studying feedback in the nuclear region of AGNs because the jets are just starting to leave this region. Numerical simulations and jet power estimates suggest that compact sources can drive outflows on scales several times larger than the radio source itself, but the lack of suitable data limits comparisons between theory and observation. We carried out an optical spectroscopic study of 82 CSS/GPS with SDSS-DR12 data to investigate the influence of compact jets in the gas. We found outflowing gas components in the [OIII]\lambda5007 emission lines in half of our sample. The kinetic energy of the outflowing gas in compact sources is comparable to that observed in extended RGs, indicating that the compact jets can drive powerful outflows similar to those in FR RGs. The observed anti-correlation between the kinetic power of the outflow and the radio luminosity suggests an interaction between the young jet and the interstellar medium (ISM). This finding provides significant observational support for previous simulations of jet-ISM interactions and supports the evolutionary scenario for RGs. However, the lack of sources with high kinetic efficiency indicates that some compact galaxies may be frustrated sources.

 - **Abstract**
 Due to the importance of a reference atmospheric radiative transfer model for both planning and calibrating ground-based observations at millimetre and submillimetre wavelengths, we have undertaken a validation campaign consisting of acquiring atmospheric spectra under different weather conditions, in different diurnal moments and seasons, with the Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX), due to the excellent stability of its receivers and the very high frequency resolution of its backends. As a result, a data set consisting of 56 spectra within the 157.3-742.1 GHz frequency range, at kHz resolution (smoothed to $\sim$2-10 MHz for analysis), and spanning one order of magnitude ($\sim$ 0.35-3.5 mm) in precipitable water vapour columns, has been gathered from October 2020 to September 2022. These data are unique for their quality and completeness and, due to the proximity of APEX to the Atacama Large Millimetre/Submillimetre Array (ALMA), they provide an excellent opportunity to validate the atmospheric radiative transfer model currently installed in the ALMA software. The main issues addressed in the study are possible missing lines in the model, line shapes, vertical profiles of atmospheric physical parameters and molecular abundances, seasonal and diurnal variations and collision induced absorption (CIA), to which this paper is devoted, in its N$_2$-N$_2$ + N$_2$-O$_2$ + O$_2$-O$_2$ (dry), and N$_2$-H$_2$O + O$_2$-H$_2$O (``foreign'' wet) mechanisms. All these CIA terms should remain unchanged in the above mentioned ALMA atmospheric model as a result of this work.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic ray measurements have inspired numerous interesting applications over several decades worldwide. These applications encompass non-invasive cosmic ray muon tomography, which enables the imaging of concealed dense objects or structures, the monitoring of area-averaged soil moisture with cosmic ray neutrons in agriculture and climate studies, real-time monitoring of the dynamical changes of the space and earth weather, etc. The demand for a quantitative characterization of cosmic ray shower particles near the Earth's surface is substantial, as it provides realistic particle spectra and rates for these diverse applications. In this study, we introduce Earth Cosmic Ray Shower (ECRS), a GEANT4-based software designed to simulate cosmic ray particle interactions in the atmosphere. ECRS incorporates the U.S. Standard Atmospheric Model and integrates a time-dependent geomagnetic field based on the Tsyganenko and IGRF models. Additionally, we present two case studies illustrating variations in the location-dependent average particle energy for muons, electrons, neutrons, and gammas at sea level. An outlook of this project is provided toward the conclusion.

 - **Abstract**
 A next-generation medium-energy (100 keV to 100 MeV) gamma-ray observatory will greatly enhance the identification and characterization of multimessenger sources in the coming decade. Coupling gamma-ray spectroscopy, imaging, and polarization to neutrino and gravitational wave detections will develop our understanding of various astrophysical phenomena including compact object mergers, supernovae remnants, active galactic nuclei and gamma-ray bursts. An observatory operating in the MeV energy regime requires technologies that are capable of measuring Compton scattered photons and photons interacting via pair production. AstroPix is a monolithic high voltage CMOS active pixel sensor which enables future gamma-ray telescopes in this energy range. AstroPix's design is iterating towards low-power (~1.5 mW/cm$^{2}$), high spatial (500 microns pixel pitch) and spectral (<5 keV at 122 keV) tracking of photon and charged particle interactions. Stacking planar arrays of AstroPix sensors in three dimensions creates an instrument capable of reconstructing the trajectories and energies of incident gamma rays over large fields of view. A prototype multi-layered AstroPix instrument, called the AstroPix Sounding rocket Technology dEmonstration Payload (A-STEP), will test three layers of AstroPix quad chips in a suborbital rocket flight. These quad chips (2x2 joined AstroPix sensors) form the 4x4 cm$^{2}$ building block of future large area AstroPix instruments, such as ComPair-2 and AMEGO-X. This payload will be the first demonstration of AstroPix detectors operated in a space environment and will demonstrate the technology's readiness for future astrophysical and nuclear physics applications. In this work, we overview the design and state of development of the ASTEP payload.

 - **Abstract**
 The magneto-hydrodynamic decay of primordial magnetic fields can distort the black-body spectrum of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) by draining magnetic energy into thermal plasmas and photons. The current limits on CMB distortion place constraints on small-scale primordial magnetic fields. The constraints crucially depend on the decay laws of primordial magnetic fields. Recent numerical simulations reveal that non-linear effects play a significant role in the magnetic field decay although these effects are neglected in previous works. In this paper, by adopting a reconnection-driven turbulent decay as a non-linear evolution model, we demonstrate the potential impact of non-linear effects on CMB spectral distortions. The reconnection-driven turbulent decay model is an analytical description which provides the consistent results with numerical simulation. Our results rule out magnetic fields with shorter coherence lengths. While the result is independent of the spectral index of the magnetic energy spectrum, it is influenced by the magnetic helicity fraction.
#### The Soltan argument at $z=6$: UV-luminous quasars contribute less than 10% to early black hole mass growth

 - **Abstract**
 We combine stellar mass functions and the recent first JWST-based galaxy-black hole scaling relations at $z=6$ to for the first time compute the supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass volume density at this epoch, and compare this to the integrated SMBH mass growth from the population of UV-luminous quasars at $z>6$. We show that even under very conservative assumptions almost all growth of SMBH mass at $z>6$ does not take place in these UV-luminous quasars, but must occur in systems obscured through dust and/or with lower radiative efficiency than standard thin accretion disks. The `Soltan argument' is not fulfilled by the known population of bright quasars at $z>6$: the integrated SMBH mass growth inferred from these largely unobscured active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the early Universe is by a factor $\ge$10 smaller than the total SMBH mass volume density at $z=6$. This is valid under a large range of assumption about luminosity, mass functions, and accretion modes, and is likely still a factor >2 smaller when accounting for known obscuration fractions at this epoch. The resulting consequences are: >90%, possibly substantially more, of SMBH-buildup in the early Universe does not take place in luminous unobscured quasar phases, but has to occur in obscured systems, with dust absorbing most of the emitted UV-visible AGN emission, potentially with accretion modes with super-Eddington specific accretion rates. This is consistent with short lifetimes for luminous quasar phases from quasar proximity zone studies and clustering. This would remove the empirical need for slow SMBH growth and hence exotic `high-mass seed' black holes at early cosmic time. It also predicts a large population of luminous but very obscured lower-mass quasars at $z>6$, possibly the JWST `Little Red Dots'. This finding might severe impact on how we will diagnose SMBH growth at $z=7$ to 15 in the future.

 - **Abstract**
 It is common practice, both in dynamical modelling and in idealised numerical simulations, to assume that galaxies and/or dark matter haloes are spherical and have isotropic velocity distributions, such that their distribution functions are ergodic. However, there is no good reason to assume that this assumption is accurate. In this paper we use idealised $N$-body simulations to study the tidal evolution of subhaloes that are anisotropic at infall. We show that the detailed velocity anisotropy has a large impact on the subhalo's mass loss rate. In particular, subhaloes that are radially anisotropic experience much more mass loss than their tangentially anisotropic counterparts. In fact, in the former case, the stripping of highly radial orbits can cause a rapid cusp-to-core transformation, without having to resort to any baryonic feedback processes. Once the tidal radius becomes comparable to the radius of the core thus formed, the subhalo is tidally disrupted. Subhaloes that at infall are tangentially anisotropic are far more resilient to tidal stripping, and are never disrupted when simulated with sufficient resolution. We show that the preferential stripping of more radial orbits, combined with re-virialisation post stripping, causes an isotropisation of the subhalo's velocity distributions. This implies that subhaloes that have experienced significant mass loss are expected to be close to isotropic, which may alleviate the mass-anisotropy degeneracies that hamper the dynamical modelling of Milky Way satellites.
#### Galaxy Formation and Evolution via Phase-temporal Clustering with FuzzyCat $\circ$ AstroLink

 - **Abstract**
 We demonstrate how the composition of two unsupervised clustering algorithms, $\texttt{AstroLink}$ and $\texttt{FuzzyCat}$, makes for a powerful tool when studying galaxy formation and evolution. $\texttt{AstroLink}$ is a general-purpose astrophysical clustering algorithm built for extracting meaningful hierarchical structure from point-cloud data defined over any feature space, while $\texttt{FuzzyCat}$ is a generalised soft-clustering algorithm that propagates the dynamical effects of underlying data processes into a fuzzy hierarchy of stable fuzzy clusters. Their composition, $\texttt{FuzzyCat}$ $\circ$ $\texttt{AstroLink}$, can therefore identify a fuzzy hierarchy of astrophysically- and statistically-significant fuzzy clusters within any point-based data set whose representation is subject to changes caused by some underlying process. Furthermore, the pipeline achieves this without relying upon strong assumptions about the data, the change process, the number/importance of specific structure types, or much user input -- thereby making itself applicable to a wide range of fields in the physical sciences. We find that for the task of structurally decomposing simulated galaxies into their constituents, our context-agnostic approach has a substantial impact on the diversity and completeness of the structures extracted as well as on their relationship within the broader galactic structural hierarchy -- revealing dwarf galaxies, infalling groups, stellar streams (and their progenitors), stellar shells, galactic bulges, and star-forming regions.
#### INTEGRAL search for magnetar giant flares from the Virgo Cluster and in nearby galaxies with high star formation rate

 - **Abstract**
 Giant flares from magnetars can reach, for a fraction of a second, luminosities greater than 10$^{47}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in the hard X-ray/soft $\gamma$-ray range. This makes them visible at distances of several megaparsecs. However, at extragalactic distances (farther than the Magellanic Clouds) they are difficult to distinguish from the short $\gamma$-ray bursts, which occur much more frequently. Since magnetars are young neutron stars, nearby galaxies with a high rate of star formation are optimal targets to search for magnetar giant flares (MGFs). Here we report the results of a search for MGFs in observations of the Virgo cluster and in a small sample of nearby galaxies obtained with the IBIS instrument on the INTEGRAL satellite. From the currently known MGF sample we find that their energy distribution is well described by a power law with slope $\gamma$=2 (with 90% c.l. interval [1.7-2.2]). From the lack of detections in this extensive data set (besides 231115A in M82) we derive a 90% c.l. upper limit on the rate of MGF with $E>3\times10^{45}$ erg of $\sim2\times10^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ per magnetar and a lower limit of $R(E)>\sim4\times10^{-4}$ yr$^{-1}$ magnetar$^{-1}$ for $E<10^{45}$ erg.

 - **Abstract**
 Radio interferometric observations of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) jets reveal the significant linear polarization of their synchrotron radiation that changes with frequency due to the Faraday rotation. It is generally assumed that such depolarization could be a powerful tool for studying the magnetized plasma in the vicinity of the jet. However, depolarization could also occur within the jet if the emitting and rotating plasma are co-spatial (i.e. the internal Faraday rotation). Burn obtained very simple dependence of the polarization on the wavelength squared for the discrete source and resolved slab that is widely used for interpreting the depolarization of AGN jets. However it ignores the influence of the non-uniform large scale magnetic field of the jet on the depolarization. Under the simple assumptions about the possible jet magnetic field structures we obtain the corresponding generalizations of Burn's relation widely used for galaxies analysis. We show that the frequency dependencies of the Faraday rotation measure and polarization angle in some cases allow to estimate the structures of the jets magnetic fields.

 The number of type Ia supernova (SNe Ia) observations will grow significantly within the next decade, mainly thanks to the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) undertaken by the Vera Rubin Observatory in Chile. With this improvement, statistical uncertainties will decrease, and flux calibration will become the main uncertainty for the characterization of dark energy. Currently, the astronomical flux scale is anchored on the numerical models of white dwarf atmospheres from the CALSPEC catalog, and every error on the model can induce a bias over cosmological parameters inference. The StarDICE experiment proposes a new calibration reference that only relies on observations from the optical watt defined by the NIST towards the magnitude of standard stars. It is currently operating at l'Observatoire de Haute-Provence and has been collecting data since the beginning of 2023. To overcome the photometric calibration uncertainty and reach a sub-percent precision, the instrument throughput has been calibrated with a Collimated Beam Projector. It will be monitored on-site with a LED-based artificial star source calibrated with NIST photodiodes. In this proceeding, we will first illustrate how an error in the photometric calibration can impact the SNe Ia distance moduli and thus bias the measurement of cosmological parameters. Then we will present the StarDICE experiment and how we can recalibrate the CALSPEC catalog at the millimagnitude level on the NIST scale with photometric analysis.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the analysis of optical data of a bright and extremely-rapidly evolving transient, AT2024wpp, whose properties are similar to the enigmatic AT2018cow (aka the Cow). AT2024wpp rose to a peak brightness of c=-21.9mag in 4.3d and remained above the half-maximum brightness for only 6.7d. The blackbody fits to the multi-band photometry show that the event remained persistently hot (T>20000K) with a rapidly receding photosphere (v~11500km/s) until the end of the photometric dataset at +16.1d post-discovery. This behaviour mimics that of AT2018cow, albeit with a several times larger photosphere. The spectra are consistent with blackbody emission throughout our spectral sequence ending at +21.9d, showing a tentative, very broad emission feature at 5500Å -- implying that the optical photosphere is likely within a near-relativistic outflow. Furthermore, reports of strong X-ray and radio emission cement the nature of AT2024wpp as a likely Cow-like transient. AT2024wpp is only the second event of the class with optical polarimetry. Our BVRI observations obtained from +6.1 to +14.4d show a low polarisation of P<0.5% across all bands, similar to AT2018cow that was consistent with P~0% during the same outflow-driven phase. In the absence of evidence for a preferential viewing angle, it is unlikely that both events would have shown low polarisation in the case that their photospheres were aspherical. As such, we conclude that the near-relativistic outflows launched in these events are likely highly spherical, but polarimetric observations of further events are crucial to constrain their ejecta geometry and stratification in detail.
