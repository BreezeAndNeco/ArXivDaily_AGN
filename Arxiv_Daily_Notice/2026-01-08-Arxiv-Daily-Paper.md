#### Non-thermal particle acceleration in multi-species kinetic plasmas: universal power-law distribution functions and temperature inversion in the solar corona

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of non-thermal power-law distribution functions ubiquitously observed in astrophysical/space (e.g., the solar wind) and laboratory kinetic plasmas, is not well understood. Another puzzling phenomenon is temperature inversion in the solar corona. These two issues are deeply connected. We develop a self-consistent quasilinear theory (QLT) for electromagnetically driven kinetic plasmas, deriving a Fokker-Planck equation for the simultaneous relaxation of multiple species, with (i) a drive diffusion coefficient for the heating of dressed particles directly by the drive and indirectly by waves, and (ii) Balescu-Lenard diffusion and drag coefficients for internal turbulence and Coulomb collisions. Both electron and ion distributions relax towards a universal attractor with a $v^{-5}$ $(E^{-2})$ tail, akin to a $\kappa = 1.5$ distribution, under a super-Debye (but sub-Larmor) drive with a steep power-spectrum. This is an outcome of Debye screening: large-scale fields accelerate the unscreened, fast particles but not the screened, slow ones. The universality may be broken by shallow power-spectra and incomplete relaxation. Collisions cannot decelerate suprathermal particles, rendering a high $v$ tail immune to Maxwellianization. Such a tail may be generated in the solar corona by chromospheric convection despite collisional losses. The suprathermal particles escape sun's gravity (velocity filtration), inverting the temperature profile and raising it to $10^6$ K. A proper analysis of velocity filtration with a $\kappa \approx 1.5-2$ distribution inspired by QLT provides a reasonable fit to the spectroscopic data of heavy ions and explains the abrupt temperature rise, a consequence of the divergence of pressure in the $\kappa \to 1.5$ limit.

 - **Abstract**
 It has long been thought that black hole accretion flows are driven by magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, and there are now many general relativistic global simulations illustrating the dynamics of this process. However, many challenges must be overcome in order to predict observed spectra from luminous systems. Ensuring energy conservation, local thermal balance, and local ionization equilibrium, our post-processing method incorporates all the most relevant radiation mechanisms: relativistic Compton scattering, bremsstrahlung, and lines and edges for 30 elements and all their ions. Previous work with this method was restricted to black holes of $10 M_\odot$; here, for the first time, we extend it to $10^8 M_\odot$ and present results for two sub-Eddington accretion rates and black hole spin parameter 0.9. The spectral shape predicted for stellar-mass black holes matches the low-hard state for the lower accretion rate and the steep power law state for the higher accretion rate. For high black hole mass, both accretion rates yield power-law continua from $\sim 0.5 - 50$~keV whose X-ray slopes agree well with observations. For intermediate mass black holes, we find a soft X-ray excess created by inverse Compton scattering of low-energy photons produced in the thermal part of the disk; this mechanism may be relevant to the soft X-ray excess commonly seen in massive black holes. Thus, our results show that standard radiation physics applied to GRMHD simulation data can yield spectra reproducing a number of the observed properties of accreting black holes across the mass spectrum.

 - **Abstract**
 Detection and characterization of small-scale energetic events such as nanoflares and nanojets remain challenging owing to their short lifetimes, small spatial extent, and relatively low energy release, despite their potential role in coronal heating. Recent observations have identified nanojets as small-scale (length $\lesssim 6.6$~Mm, width $\lesssim 1$~Mm), fast ($\sim$~few 100 km s$^{-1}$), and short-lived ($\lesssim 30$~s) ejections associated with nanoflare-scale energies, providing evidence of magnetic reconnection at small spatial scales. However, the lack of synthetic diagnostics has limited the connection between magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models and observations. In this Letter, we present synthetic observations of the coalescence of two flux ropes, leading to nanojet-like signatures from a numerical model obtained with the \texttt{MPI-AMRVAC} code. We report synthetic observables in Extreme-ultraviolet lines compatible with existing instruments such as SDO/AIA, and upcoming MUSE mission, and compare the synthetic observables with an existing observation of nanojets. The synthetic diagnostics of the emissivity maps, Doppler velocity, thermal, and non-thermal line broadening produce key observational properties, suggesting a plausible 3D scenario for nanojet generation where tiny flux ropes reconnect within loops. Our results provide predictions for the detectability of nanojets with current and future spectroscopic facilities, and establish a bridge between MHD modeling and observations.

 - **Abstract**
 A central magnetar engine is commonly invoked to explain energetic supernovae, which should have multiple signals in multiwavelength emission. Photoionization from the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) can create distinct spectroscopic signals in the nebular phase. Recent models suggest infrared emission, particularly from Ne II, can be prominent at late times. This work examines the cooling power of optical and infrared transitions to determine which lines contribute strongly to cooling and on what timescale. The models show infrared cooling becomes strong at $\sim$ 3 years post-explosion and dominates by 6 years, with [Ne II] 12.8$\mu$m being the strongest coolant. The fraction of total cooling in the infrared increases sharply once the PWN luminosity decreases below 10$^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$, and this fraction also increases with increasing ejecta mass and decreasing average PWN photon energy. However, the emission from [Ne II] 12.8$\mu$m increases with increasing PWN luminosity and increasing ejecta mass. Cooling at 1 year is dominated by optical O and S lines, with infrared Ar, Ni, and Ne lines becoming strong at 3 years. Optical cooling is almost negligible at 6 years, with the supernova cooling almost entirely through mid- and far-infrared transitions. JWST spectroscopy with MIRI should be able to detect these lines out to $z \sim 0.1$. Supernovae with higher magnetic fields transition to infrared cooling on earlier timescales, while infrared-dominated supernovae should have strong emission from neutral atoms and emit strongly in radio at sub-decade timescales.
#### Integral field spectroscopy and numerical simulations of the NGC 2207/IC 2163 system

 - **Abstract**
 We present integral field spectroscopy of the interacting galaxy system NGC 2207/IC 2163 obtained with the imaging Fourier Transform Spectrometer SITELLE. Approximately 1000 HII region complexes are detected in both galaxies and analyzed using their strong optical emission lines. Their properties were studied via BPT diagrams and their luminosity function. We conducted a detailed study of the distribution of oxygen abundance across the system using a series of strong-line O/H indicators and calibrations. Both galaxies exhibit negative galactocentric abundance gradients with a slope -0.015 dex kpc$^{-1}$. There are marginal signs of discontinuities in the O/H gradients with some indicators while no significant azimuthal variations are seen. A shallower slope in the HII region luminosity function between the arm and inter-arm regions in IC 2163 is observed, supporting previous conclusion that the star formation process in this galaxy eyelids has been altered during the interaction. The kinematics of the ionised gas reveal disturbed velocity fields, AGN-like features in the nucleus of NGC 2207, and elevated velocity dispersion in turbulent or feedback-driven regions. To interpret these findings, we modeled the collision using the numerical algorithm GCD+. The simulation reproduces key features of the system and demonstrates how close passages drive enhanced star formation and localized chemical enrichment. Finally, two dwarf galaxies in the field are found to have very similar systemic velocities as their larger counterparts, and could well play a minor role in the global interaction based on their morphology and position.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the chemical evolution of a forming molecular cloud behind an interstellar shock wave. We conduct three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics simulations of the converging flow of atomic gas, including a simple chemical network and tracer particles that move along the local velocity field. Then we perform detailed chemical network calculations along the trajectory of each tracer particle. The diffuse part of forming molecular clouds is CO-poor; i.e., H$_2$ and CO abundances do not correlate. In diffuse regions of $n_\mathrm{H}\lesssim 10^{3}\,\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$, we find that the abundances of hydrocarbons and oxygen-bearing molecules are determined by steady-state chemistry reflecting the local H$_2$ abundance, which is determined by the gas density along the trajectory. In denser regions, the abundances are affected by water ice formation, which changes the elemental abundance of carbon and oxygen (i.e., C/O ratio) in the gas phase. Assuming quasi-steady-state chemistry given the abundances of major molecules (e.g., H$_2$) from the simple network, we derive analytic solutions for molecular abundances, which reproduce the calculation results. We also calculate the molecular column densities based on the spatial distribution of tracer particles and their molecular abundances, and compare them with observations of diffuse molecular clouds. We find that the column densities of CH, CCH, and OH are linearly correlated with those of H$_2$, which supports the empirical relation used in the observations. On the other hand, the column density of HCO$^+$ shows non-linear dependence on the H$_2$ column density, reflecting the difference in HCO$^+$ formation paths in CO-poor and CO-rich regions.

 - **Abstract**
 There is growing evidence from gravitational-wave observations that some merging black holes are created from previous mergers. Using the prediction that these hierarchically-merged black holes have dimensionless spin magnitudes of $\chi \approx 0.69$, we identify a subpopulation in the gravitational-wave data consistent with a hierarchical-merger origin in dense star clusters. This subpopulation's primary mass distribution peaks at $16.7^{+3.1}_{-4.6},\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, which is approximately twice as large as its secondary mass distribution's mode ($8.0^{+29.7}_{-2.3},\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$), and its spin tilt distribution is consistent with isotropy. Our inferred secondary mass distributions imply that isolated binary evolution may still be needed to explain the entirety of the $9\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ peak. Surprisingly, we find that the rate of hierarchical mergers may evolve more steeply with redshift than the rest of the population ($98.5\%$ credibility): the fraction of all binary black holes that are hierarchically formed at $z=0.1$ is $0.05^{+0.05}_{-0.04}$, compared to $0.17^{+0.13}_{-0.12}$ at $z=1$. This provides an explanation for the previously-discovered broadening of the effective spin distribution with redshift. Our results have implications for star cluster formation histories, as they suggest the potential existence of a high-redshift population of massive, compact clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate a possible origin for bursty radio emission observed on the active M dwarf V374 Peg, combining data-driven magnetic field modelling with archival radio light curves. We examine whether stellar prominence ejection can plausibly account for the observed radio bursts that have been attributed to electron cyclotron maser (ECM) emission. Our analysis shows that ejected prominences can produce the required energy range to drive the emission, and that modelled ECM visibility exhibits a rotational phase dependence consistent with the limited observational data (four observed bursts). The results support prominence ejection as a viable mechanism for ECM generation on V374 Peg and motivate further observational campaigns to constrain this process.

 - **Abstract**
 Linearly polarized emission is a powerful tracer of magnetic field geometry and particle acceleration in protostellar jets. We present a polarimetric study of the HH objects HH 80 and HH 81 from where non-thermal emission has been confirmed through spectral index measurements at low frequencies. We carried out observations of HH 80 and HH 81 with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array in 4-6 GHz. Unlike the inner jet knots, no linear polarization is detected towards the knots HH 80 and HH 81. We place a $3\sigma$ upper limit of $30~\mu$Jy on the polarization intensity, corresponding to fractional polarization limits of $\Pi_{\max}\approx0.02$ and $0.01$ for HH 80 and HH 81, respectively. To interpret this non-detection, we assess the conditions for synchrotron polarization and the impact of depolarization mechanisms. The shock cooling parameter $\chi_\mathrm{s}$ is lower in these outermost HH objects than in the inner knots, indicating that the reverse shocks in HH 80-81 are less efficient at accelerating relativistic electrons compared with the inner knots. Moreover, Faraday depolarization appears severe: the dispersion in the estimated rotation measure $\sigma_{\rm RM}\sim400~\mathrm{rad~m^{-2}}$ is comparable to or larger than observed RM values themselves. This is consistent with strong fluctuations and turbulence. Together with beam depolarization, these effects can suppress the observable fractional polarization flux densities below the detectable thresholds. We conclude that reduced acceleration efficiency (when compared to inner knots) and strong depolarization account for the absence of polarized emission towards HH 80 and HH 81.

 - **Abstract**
 Uranus and Neptune are characterized by anomalously tilted and multi-dipole magnetic fields, which poses substantial challenges for elucidating the internal mechanisms generating magnetic fields. Recent investigations confirmed that superionic H2O is thermodynamically stable and constitutes the dominant H2O phase within their icy mantles. In this study, we demonstrate that the superionic H2O ice exhibits a pronounced protonic thermoelectric effect, in which the maximum Seebeck coefficient within the interior of Uranus can reach approximately 620 uV/K, whereas that of Neptune is lower, within the range of 570-585 uV/K. Consequently, temperature gradients in the icy mantles can induce proton convection, which in turn drives magnetic field generation. Based on this novel mechanism, the disparities in magnetic field strength between Uranus and Neptune can be accounted for exclusively by their differing internal temperature gradients, and the predicted values are in agreement with observations.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a multiband (UBVRI) time-series photometric study of RR Lyrae (RRL) stars in the globular cluster Messier 53 (NGC 5024) to refine their pulsation properties and determine a precise cluster distance. The archival photometric data includes images taken over 22 years and 3 months using different optical telescopes, providing an excellent time baseline to investigate light curves of variable stars. Using Lomb-Scargle periodogram, we derived accurate periods for 29 fundamental-mode (RRab) and 35 first-overtone (RRc) RRLs. Template-fitting to phase-folded light curves provided robust mean magnitudes and amplitudes. The refined periods confirm M53 as an Oosterhoff II cluster, with a mean period of 0.649 days for RRab and 0.346 days for RRc, and a high RRc fraction (54.7\%). Most RRLs align with the horizontal branch in the color-magnitude diagram, while a few outliers result from blending effects. Period-amplitude diagrams show RRab stars following the Oosterhoff II locus. We derived I-band period-luminosity and multi-band period-Wesenheit relations, comparing them with theoretical predictions. A weighted mean distance modulus of 16.242 $\pm$ 0.05 mag yields a cluster distance of 17.717 $\pm$ 0.408 kpc, in agreement with recent estimates based on parallaxes from Gaia data.
#### Filtering interlopers with photometry and diagnostic features: A machine learning framework validated with CSST slitless spectroscopy

 - **Abstract**
 The slitless spectroscopic method employed by missions such as Euclid and the Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST) faces a fundamental challenge: spectroscopic redshifts derived from their data are susceptible to emission line misidentification due to the limited spectral resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. This effect systematically introduces interloper galaxies into the sample. Conventional strict selection not only struggles to secure high redshift purity but also drastically reduces completeness by discarding valuable data. To overcome this limitation, we develop an XGBoost classifier that leverages photometric properties and spectroscopic diagnostics to construct a high-purity redshift catalog while maximizing completeness. We validate this method on a simulated sample with spectra generated by the CSST emulator for slitless spectroscopy. Of the $\sim$62 million galaxies that obtain valid redshifts (parent sample), approximately 43% achieve accurate measurements, defined as $|\Delta z| \leq 0.002(1+z)$. From this parent sample, the XGBoost classifier selects galaxies with a selection efficiency of 42.3% on the test set and 42.2% when deployed on the entire parent sample. Crucially, among the retained galaxies, 96.6% (parent sample: 96.5%) achieve accurate measurements, while the outlier fraction ($|\Delta z|>0.01(1+z)$) is constrained to 0.13% (0.11%). We verified that simplified configurations which exclude either spectroscopic diagnostics (except the measured redshift) or photometric data yield significantly higher outlier fractions, increasing by factors of approximately 3.5 and 6.3 respectively, with the latter case also introducing notable catastrophic interloper contamination. This framework effectively resolves the purity-completeness trade-off, enabling robust large-scale cosmological studies with CSST and similar surveys.
#### HST+IGRINS synergy to characterise the newly discovered metal-rich bulge globular cluster Patchick 126

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first comprehensive spectroscopic and deep photometric study of the globular cluster (GC) candidate Patchick~126. The spectroscopic analysis is based on high-resolution near-infrared data obtained with the IGRINS spectrograph, while the photometric analysis relies on HST observations from the Hubble Missing Globular Cluster Survey (MGCS). We derived abundances for $\alpha$-(O, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti), light-(C, N), odd-Z (Na, Al), iron-peak (Fe, Co, Cr, Ni, Mn, V), and s-process elements (Ce) for four red giant stars observed in the H and K bands. Our results yield a mean metallicity of $\langle\mathrm{[Fe/H]}\rangle = -0.30\pm0.03$, with no evidence of intrinsic variation, and an $\alpha$-enhancement of $\langle\mathrm{[\alpha/Fe]}\rangle =+0.19\pm0.02$, consistent with the trends of metal-rich Galactic GCs. We detect an intrinsic C-N anti-correlation, but no Na-O or Al-Mg anti-correlations, in agreement with expectations for low-mass, metal-rich clusters. From the HST photometry, we constructed deep CMDs extending $\sim 2-3$ magnitudes below the MSTO. This depth allowed us to provide the first robust age estimate for the cluster. Applying the methods developed within the CARMA project, we derive an age of $11.9^{+0.3}_{-0.4}$~Gyr. We obtain a photometric metallicity of [Fe/H]$=-0.28$, in agreement with the spectroscopic results. The colour excess we derived, E(B-V) = 1.08, confirms that Patchick~126 is a heavily reddened cluster, located at a heliocentric distance of 7.8 kpc. From the orbital parameters, including energy, vertical angular momentum, circularity, and maximum vertical height, we find that Patchick~126 closely follows a disc-like orbit. Taken together, these results confirm that Patchick 126 is an in situ, low-mass globular cluster of the Milky Way, exhibiting properties that lie at the boundary between old-OCs and GCs.

 - **Abstract**
 Optical polarimetry provides information on the geometry of the emitting region, the magnetic field configuration and the properties of dust in astrophysical sources. Current state-of-the-art instruments typically have a small field of view (FoV), which poses a challenge for conducting wide surveys. We propose the construction of the Large Array Survey Telescope Polarization Node (LAST-P), a wide-field array of optical polarimeters. LAST-P is designed for high-cadence ($\lesssim 1$ day) polarization monitoring of numerous astrophysical transients, such as the early phases of gamma-ray bursts, supernovae, and novae. Furthermore, LAST-P will facilitate the creation of extensive polarization catalogs for X-ray binaries and white dwarfs, alongside a large FoV study of the interstellar medium. In survey mode, LAST-P will cover a FoV of 88.8 deg$^2$. With a 15 x 1-minute exposure, the instrument will be capable of measuring polarization of sources as faint as Gaia Bp-magnitude $\sim$20.9. The precision on the linear polarization degree (PD) will reach 0.7\%, 1.5\%, and 3.5\% for sources with magnitudes 17, 18, and 19, respectively, for a seeing of 2.7 arcsec, air mass of about 1 for observations in dark locations. We propose three distinct non-simultaneous survey strategies, among them an active galactic nuclei (AGN) strategy for long-term monitoring of $\sim$200 AGN with $<$1-day cadence. In this paper, we present the predicted sensitivity of the instrument and outline the various science cases it is designed to explore.

 - **Abstract**
 We identify a polarization rotation systematic in the far field beams of refractive cosmic microwave background (CMB) telescopes caused by differential transmission in anti-reflection (AR) coatings of optical elements. This systematic was identified following the development of a hybrid physical optics method that incorporates full-wave electromagnetic simulations of AR coatings to model the full polarization response of refractive systems. Applying this method to a two-lens CMB telescope with non-ideal AR coating, we show that polarization-dependent transmission can produce a rotation of the far-field polarization angle that varies across the focal plane with a typical amplitude of 0.05-0.5 degrees. If ignored in analysis, this effect can produce temperature to polarization leakage and Stokes Q/U mixing.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration transients of unknown origin, likely associated with compact astrophysical objects. We report evidence for a damped millisecond quasi-periodic structure in a non-repeat FRB~20190122C. The burst consists of eight closely spaced radio pulses separated by $\sim$1 ms, with pulse amplitudes exhibiting an exponential decay starting from the brightest component. Combined Gaussian fitting and time-series analysis reveal a quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) at $\sim$1 kHz. The observed QPO is consistent with damped magnetospheric oscillations. Assuming an Alfvén wave origin, we estimate a surface magnetic field of $\sim 10^{12}$ G and a characteristic spin period of $\sim$1 s, favoring a low-field magnetar or young neutron star scenario. The absence of frequency drift and the presence of exponential damping disfavor a merger-driven origin. These results suggest the first detection of an exponentially decaying QPO in any FRB, marking a rare detection of coherent oscillatory behavior in FRBs.

 - **Abstract**
 Dynamic Spectrum Sharing (DSS) is increasingly promoted as a key element of modern spectrum policy, driven by the rising demand from commercial wireless systems and advances in spectrum access technologies. Passive radio sciences, including radio astronomy, Earth remote sensing, and meteorology, operate under fundamentally different constraints. They rely on exceptionally low interference spectrum and are highly vulnerable to even brief radio frequency interference. We examine whether DSS can benefit passive services or whether it introduces new failure modes and enforcement challenges. We propose just-in-time quiet zones (JITQZ) as a mechanism for protecting high value observations and assess hybrid frameworks that preserve static protection for core passive bands while allowing constrained dynamic access in adjacent frequencies. We analyze the roles of propagation uncertainty, electromagnetic compatibility constraints, and limited spectrum awareness. Using a game theoretic framework, we show why non-cooperative sharing fails, identify conditions for sustained cooperation, and examine incentive mechanisms including pseudonymetry-enabled attribution that promote compliance. We conclude that DSS can support passive radio sciences only as a high-reliability, safety-critical system. Static allocations remain essential, and dynamic access is viable only with conservative safeguards and enforceable accountability.

 - **Abstract**
 Temperature and luminosity are the two key diagnostics of a star, yet these cannot come directly from survey data, but must be imputed by comparing those data to models. SED fitting offers a high-precision method to obtain both parameters for stars where both their distance and extinction are well known. The recent publication of many all-sky or large-area surveys coincides the publication of parallaxes and 3D extinction cubes from the Gaia satellite, making it possible to perform SED fitting of truly large ($>10^8$) numbers of Galactic stars for the first time. The analysis of this data requires a high level of automation. Here, we describe the ongoing Gaia All-Sky Stellar Parameters Service (GASPS): the fitting of 240 million SEDs from Gaia DR3 and the extraction of temperatures and luminosities for the corresponding stars using the PySSED code. We demonstrate the quality of the initial results, and the promise that these data show, from wavelength-specific information such as the ultraviolet and infrared excess of each star, to stellar classification, to expansion of the project beyond our own Galaxy, and mineralogical mapping of the Milky Way's interstellar medium.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent work revealed the existence of a galaxy "millimetre fundamental plane of black hole accretion", a tight correlation between nuclear $1$mm luminosity, intrinsic $2$ - $10$keV X-ray luminosity and supermassive black hole mass, originally discovered for nearby low- and high-luminosity active galactic nuclei. Here we use mm and X-ray data of $5$ X-ray binaries (XRBs) to demonstrate that these stellar-mass black holes also lie on the mm fundamental plane, as they do at radio wavelengths. One source for which we have multi-epoch observations shows evidence of deviations from the plane after a state change, suggesting that the plane only applies to XRBs in the hard state, as is true again at radio wavelengths. We show that both advection-dominated accretion flows and compact jet models predict the existence of the plane across the entire range of black hole masses, although these models vary in their ability to accurately predict the XRB black hole masses.

 - **Abstract**
 Dark galaxies are small, DM-dominated halos whose gas remains in hydrostatic and thermal equilibrium and has never formed stars. They are of particular interest because they represent a strong prediction of the LCDM model. As of today, only a handful of candidates have been observed, the most intriguing of which being Cloud-9. Using several state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations, we aim to predict the abundance of dark galaxies expected within our Local Group (LG), characterise their properties and provide guidance for their potential detection. We analyse LG simulations with constrained initial conditions, run with different codes, implementing different baryonic physics, feedback prescriptions, and employing two distinct values of SF density threshold, n_th=0.13 and 10 cm^-3, to select samples of dark and bright galaxies harboured in haloes of similar mass. We demonstrate that dark galaxies exist in such simulations, though their number is larger in simulations that use a higher, more realistic n_th. These galaxies, whose gas remains diffuse and never forms stars, predominantly inhabit less-concentrated, higher-spin DM halos than their luminous counterparts. Dark galaxies are typically found in low-density regions at the outskirts of the LG, and their evolution across z indicate that both the DM and gas densities in their surroundings were consistently lower than those found around bright galaxies, making them less susceptible to interactions, mergers, or gas inflows. We estimate that up to 8 dark galaxies should be detectable in HI emission within 2.5 Mpc of the LG, with the FAST telescope, accounting for its sky coverage and minimum M_HI and N_HI. Current hydrodynamical simulations of galaxies, combined with upcoming HI surveys, will offer a direct and powerful test of LCDM through their ability to predict and measure properties of dark galaxies within and beyond the LG.

 - **Abstract**
 The models that most successfully reproduce the orbital architecture of the Solar System terrestrial planets start from a narrow annulus of material that grows into embryos and then planets. However, it is not clear how this ring model can be made consistent with the chemical structure of the inner Solar System, which shows a reduced-to-oxidized gradient from Mercury to Mars and a parallel gradient in the asteroid belt. We propose that there were two primary reservoirs in the early inner Solar System: a narrow, refractory enriched ring inside of 1 au, and a less massive, extended planetesimal disk outside of 1 au with oxidation states ranging from enstatite chondrites to ordinary chondrites. We show through a suite of N-body simulations that an inwardly sweeping secular resonance, caused by aerodynamic drag and perturbations from a mean-motion resonant Jupiter and Saturn, gathers the outer planetesimal disk into a narrow ring that migrates radially, forms Mars, and contributes oxidized material to proto-Earth. Remaining unaccreted planetesimals can be implanted into the asteroid belt as the parent bodies of aubrites and non-carbonaceous iron meteorites, while the most reduced material is not implanted and thus unsampled in the meteorite collection. This model explains the oxidation and isotopic gradients within the inner Solar System within the context of a low-viscosity, magnetic wind-driven disk.

 - **Abstract**
 The earliest stages of disk formation and dust evolution during the protostellar phase remain poorly constrained. Millimeter dust emission and its polarization provide key insights into the physical processes and material distribution at the envelope-disk interface. We present ALMA polarimetric observations at 1.4 mm and 3 mm of two young stellar objects in Taurus, IRAS 04166+2706 (K04166) and IRAS 04169+2702 (K04169), probing scales from 25 au to 3000 au. We model the Stokes I emission to separate disk and envelope contributions and analyze the polarization properties to identify the dominant polarization mechanisms. K04166 shows extended Stokes I and polarized emission tracing a tentative hourglass magnetic field morphology in its envelope. In the inner envelope and disk (< 100 au), the properties of the polarized emission change, suggesting either a toroidal magnetic field or the presence of large grains. In contrast, K04169 exhibits compact Stokes I and polarized emission consistent with self-scattering from the disk. Both disks are extremely compact, but only K04166 retains a substantial envelope. Our multiscale ALMA polarimetric observations reveal a transition from magnetically aligned grains in envelopes to self-scattering in disks within the transition region of 20-50 au. These results provide important clues on dust grain growth and magnetic field morphology at the disk-envelope scales. Despite being embedded in the same filament, the two sources display striking differences, indicating that K04166 is a young embedded object with a substantial envelope threaded by relatively organized magnetic fields. Meanwhile, K04169 is more evolved, likely to be a young T-Tauri star. However, in both disks, the presence of large grains already suggests a scenario of early dust evolution in disks of the Class 0 stage.
#### Characterizing the physical and chemical properties of the Class I protostellar system Oph-IRS 44. Binarity, infalling streamers, and accretion shocks

 - **Abstract**
 (Abridged) In the low-mass star formation process, theoretical models predict that material from the infalling envelope could be shocked as it encounters the outer regions of the disk. Nevertheless, only a few protostars show evidence of these shocks at the disk-envelope interface, and the main formation path of shocked-related species is still unclear. We present new ALMA observations of IRS 44, a Class I source that has previously been associated with accretion shocks, taken at high angular resolution (0.1"). We target multiple molecular transitions of CO, H2CO, and simple sulfur-bearing species. In continuum emission, the binary nature of IRS 44 is observed for the first time at sub-millimeter wavelengths. Infalling signatures are seen for the CO line and the emission peaks at the edges of the continuum emission around IRS 44 B, the same region where bright SO and SO2 emission is seen. Weak CS and H2CO emission is observed, while OCS, H2S, and H2CS transitions are not detected. IRS 44 B seems to be more embedded than IRS 44 A, indicating a non-coeval formation scenario or the rejuvenation of source B due to late infall. CO emission is tracing the outflow component at large scales, infalling envelope material at intermediate scales, and two infalling streamer candidates are identified at disk scales. Infalling streamers might produce accretion shocks when they encounter the outer regions of the infalling-rotating envelope. These shocks heat the dust and release S-bearing species as well as promoting a lukewarm chemistry in the gas phase. With the majority of carbon locked in CO, there is little free C available to form CS and H2CS in the gas, leaving an oxygen-rich environment. The high column densities of SO and SO2 might be a consequence of two processes: direct thermal desorption from dust grains and gas-phase formation due to the availability of O and S.

 - **Abstract**
 We present new and archival Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of two strongly lensed dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) selected from the South Pole Telescope survey, SPT0418-47 $(z = 4.225)$ and SPT2147-50 $(z = 3.760)$. We study the [C II], CO(7-6), [C I](2-1), and, in SPT0418-47, $p$-H$_2$O emission, which along with the underlying continuum (rest-frame 160 $\mu$m and 380 $\mu$m) are routinely used as tracers of gas mass and/or star-formation rate (SFR). We perform a pixel-by-pixel analysis of both sources in the image plane to study the resolved Kennicutt-Schmidt relation, finding generally good agreement between the slopes of the SFR versus gas mass surface density using the different tracers. Using lens modeling methods, we find that the dust emission is more compact than the line emission in both sources, with CO(7-6) and [C I](2-1) similar in extent and [C II] the most extended, reminiscent of recent findings of extended [C II] spatial distributions in galaxies at similar cosmic epochs. We develop the [C I](2-1) / CO(7-6) flux density ratio as an observable proxy for gas depletion timescale ($\tau_{\rm dep}$), which can be applied to large samples of DSFGs, in lieu of more detailed inferences of this timescale which require analysis of observations at multiple wavelengths. Furthermore, the extended [C II] emission in both sources, compared to the total continuum and line emission, suggests that [C II], used in recent years as a molecular gas mass and SFR tracer in high-$z$ galaxies, may not always be a suitable tracer of these physical quantities.

 - **Abstract**
 Motivated by a number of X-ray observations of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) that exhibit a potential signature of ultra-fast inflows (UFIs), we consider in this work a scenario that UFIs can be physically identified as weakly-magnetized hydrodynamic accretion flows that is guided and channeled by poloidal magnetic field into low-to-mid latitude above the equatorial disk. In the context of general relativistic hydrodynamics (GRHD) under a weak-field limit in Kerr spacetime, we present a set of preliminary results by numerically calculating the physical property of GRHD flows (e.g. kinematics and density distribution) in an effort to simulate redshifted absorption line spectra. Our model demonstrates that such GRHD accretion off the equatorial plane (i.e. $v \gsim 0.1c$ where $c$ is the speed of light in the vicinity of AGN closer than $\sim 100$ \sw radii) can manifest itself as UFIs in the form of redshifted absorption signature assuming the observed characteristics such as column density of $N_H \sim 10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$ and ionization parameter of $\log (\xi \rm{[erg~cm~s^{-1}])} \sim 3$ as also seen in recent multi-epoch {\it NuSTAR} observations among other data.

 Observing supernovae (SNe) in the early Universe (z > 3) provides a window into how both galaxies and individual stars have evolved over cosmic time, yet a detailed study of high-redshift stars and SNe has remained difficult due to their extreme distances and cosmological redshifting. To overcome the former, searches for gravitationally lensed sources allow for the discovery of magnified SNe that appear as multiple images - further providing the opportunity for efficient follow-up. Here we present the discovery of "SN Eos": a strongly lensed, multiply-imaged, SN II at a spectroscopic redshift of z = 5.133 +/- 0.001. SN Eos exploded in a Lyman-{\alpha} emitting galaxy when the Universe was only ~1 billion years old, shortly after it reionized and became transparent to ultraviolet radiation. A year prior to our discovery in JWST data, archival HST imaging of SN Eos reveals rest-frame far ultraviolet (~1,300Å) emission, indicative of shock breakout or interaction with circumstellar material in the first few (rest-frame) days after explosion. The JWST spectroscopy of SN Eos, now the farthest spectroscopically confirmed SN ever discovered, shows that SN Eos's progenitor star likely formed in a metal-poor environment (<= 0.1 Z_{\odot}), providing the first direct evidence of massive star formation in the metal-poor, early Universe. SN Eos would not have been detectable without the extreme lensing magnification of the system, highlighting the potential of such discoveries to eventually place constraints on the faint end of the cosmic star-formation rate density in the very early Universe.

 We present the detection of 2MASS J22282889-4310262 (2M2228), a T6/T6.5 brown dwarf, using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) archival data observed at C band (4-8 GHz) over two observing epochs ($2\times96$ minutes). 2M2228 is detected at time and frequency averaged Stokes I and V peak flux densities of $67.3\pm4.9\ \mu\ \rm{Jy beam}^{-1}$ and $14.4\pm3.0\ \mu\text{Jy beam}^{-1}$ in the first epoch and $107.2\pm5.2\ \mu\rm{Jy\ beam}^{-1}$ and $-20.7\pm1.2\ \mu\text{Jy beam}^{-1}$ in the second epoch. This discovery constitutes the eighth and, notably, the most rapidly rotating T dwarf detected to date at radio wavelengths. Our observations reveal highly polarised bursts at fractional polarisation ratios $f_\text{c}>50$%. Using Stokes I light curves, we measure occurrence intervals of $\sim47$ and $\sim58$ minutes in the two observing epochs respectively with the first burst aligning within a half period timescale of the the previously measured mid infrared photometric period of $85.8\pm0.32$ minutes. We attribute the emission to the electron cyclotron maser emission (ECME) and constrain the magnetic field strength to $B\gtrsim1.4$ kG. We emphasise that the periods inferred are provisional considering the short observing durations. The combination of previously demonstrated atmospheric stability and newly detected radio emission in 2M2228 makes it a promising laboratory for testing magnetospheric currents-driven auroral models and for guiding future coordinated James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and radio observations to probe the link between auroral activity and atmospheric dynamics in T-type brown dwarfs.

 - **Abstract**
 Common envelope evolution (CEE) is a crucial phase in binary stellar evolution. Current global three-dimensional simulations lack the resolution to capture the small-scale dynamics around the embedded companion, while local wind-tunnel simulations always approximate the companion's orbital motion as linear rather than as rotation around the center of mass. We investigate how rotation, accretion, and stratification influence small-scale gas dynamics, gravitational drag and lift forces, and the spin-up rate of the companion. We perform three-dimensional local hydrodynamic simulations of a $0.2\, M_\odot$ compact companion plunging into the envelope of a $2\, M_\odot$ red giant in a reference frame rotating at the companion's orbital angular velocity, using the Athena++ code. The presence of stratification generates an inward-directed force, partially opposed by a rotation-induced outward lift force. Both the resulting inward directed force and the drag force, strongly influenced by stratification, would affect the evolution of the binary separation. We propose revised semi-analytical prescriptions for both drag and lift forces. Without accretion and for sufficiently small gravitational softening radii, a quasi-hydrostatic bubble forms around the companion, while accretion prevents its formation and converts kinetic energy into heat that could contribute to the envelope ejection. Drag and lift forces are only marginally affected by accretion. The companion spin-up rate varies non-monotonically in time, first increasing and then decreasing as it plunges deeper into the envelope. These results motivate future magnetohydrodynamic simulations to investigate how accretion, rotation, and stratification affect magnetic amplification, and how magnetic fields, in turn, influence mass and angular momentum accretion rates, as well as the drag and lift force exerted on the companion.
