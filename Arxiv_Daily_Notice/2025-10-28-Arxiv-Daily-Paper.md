#### Definition of Exoplanets and Brown Dwarfs

 - **Abstract**
 This chapter reviews the definition of exoplanets and of brown dwarfs. Emphasis is given to the separation of these two populations. A traditional view is to declare « planet » objects with a mass < 13 M Jup and « brown dwarf » objects with a mass > 13 M Jup . By analogy with Solar System planets, a better definition is to call « planets » objects formed by accretion of dust and planetesimals in a disk. An by extension of the primitive introduction of the word « brown dwarf » for failed stars by Jill Tarter, this term must be reserved to objects formed by gravitational collapse in a molecular gas cloud. The two definitions do not coincide since a « brown dwarf » can have a mass down to about 6 Jupiter mass. And there is no physical reason to assert that a 20 Jupiter mass object has not been formed by accretion. From there, the difficulty is to decide if an object of say 20 Jupiter mass is formed by dust accretion or by gravitational collapse. A future observational test to solve this difficulty is presented.

 - **Abstract**
 The LIGO/Virgo/Kagra (LVK) Collaboration has detected numerous binary black hole mergers with properties that challenge standard binary evolution scenarios, such as component masses above the pair-instability gap and high spin magnitudes. Dense stellar environments such as globular clusters provide a natural channel for producing such systems through hierarchical mergers, where black hole remnants formed in earlier mergers are retained in the cluster and undergo successive mergers. However, gravitational-wave recoil kicks often eject merger remnants from typical globular clusters, which limits hierarchical growth. Massive clusters with deeper potential wells, such as those found in giant elliptical galaxies like M87, may overcome this barrier, but direct simulations of such massive globular clusters remains computationally challenging. In this study, we present a 10-million-body cluster simulation performed with the $\texttt{Cluster Monte Carlo}$ ($\texttt{CMC}$) code, referred to as $\texttt{colossus}$, which serves as a proxy for the most massive low-metallicity globular clusters observed in the local Universe. This simulation demonstrates that extended chains of hierarchical mergers can occur in massive globular clusters, producing black holes up to fifth generation with masses approaching $250\,M_\odot$, comparable to the most massive LVK events observed to date (e.g., GW231123). Combining the $\texttt{colossus}$ simulation with the previous $\texttt{CMC Cluster Catalog}$, we develop a framework to extrapolate binary black hole merger predictions for the thousands of globular clusters seen in the Virgo Supercluster.

 - **Abstract**
 The velocity field of intracluster gas in galaxy clusters contains key information on the virialization of infalling material, the dissipation of AGN energy into the surrounding medium, and the validity of the hydrostatic hypothesis. The statistical properties of the velocity field are characterized by its fluctuation power spectrum, which is usually expected to be well described by an injection scale and a turbulent cascade. Here we propose a simulation-based inference technique to retrieve the properties of the velocity power spectrum from X-ray micro-calorimeter data by generating simulations of Gaussian random fields from a parametric power spectrum model. We forward model the measured bulk velocities and velocity dispersions by including the most relevant observational effects (projection, emissivity weighting, PSF smearing). We then train a neural network to learn the mapping between the power spectrum parameters and the generated data vectors. Considering a three-parameter model describing turbulent energy injection on large scales and a power-law cascade, we found that two XRISM/Resolve pointings are sufficient to accurately determine the turbulent Mach number and set interesting constraints on the injection scale. Applying our method to the Coma cluster data, we obtain a model that is characterized by a large injection scale that rivals the size of the cluster ($\ell_{inj}=2.2_{-1.0}^{+2.0}$ Mpc). When this power spectrum model is integrated over the cluster scales ($0<\ell<R_{500}=1.4 $Mpc), the Mach number of the gas motions is $\mathcal{M}_{3D,500}=0.45_{-0.13}^{+0.18}$, which exceeds the value derived from the velocity dispersions only. Further observations covering a wider area are required to decrease the cosmic variance and constrain the slope of the turbulent cascade.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the impact of radiation pressure on electromagnetic signatures of accreting massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) at milli-parsec separations, using 3D hyper-Lagrangian resolution hydrodynamical simulations. We model binaries embedded in a self-gravitating circumbinary disc that evolves following an adiabatic equation of state, including viscous heating and black-body cooling. Focusing on binaries with a total mass of $10^6 \, M_{\odot}$, eccentricities $e=0,0.45,0.9$ and mass ratios $q=1, 0.7$, we find that radiation pressure significantly affects both the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and the light curves (LCs). The emission from the mini-discs shifts from the optical towards UV frequencies and with a peak luminosity orders of magnitude higher, while the circumbinary disc becomes colder and dimmer as a result of its geometrically thinner configuration. Temporal variability is affected as well: near UV and soft-X ray fluxes are higher and more variable. Crucially, radiation pressure suppresses the characteristic "lump" formation in equal-mass circular systems, while a lump is formed for higher eccentricities without imprinting any modulation on the flux. In the circular case we still find a modulation on the cavity edge timescale at a frequency $0.36 \, f_{\rm K}$, while in eccentric binaries, only robust orbital period modulations ($f=1,2 \, f_{\rm K}$) are observed, with no modulation associated with the cavity orbital motion. Moreover, the enhanced emission from the mini-discs and streams due to radiation pressure, one redshifted, results in brighter flux in the optical G band, proving detectability of MBHBs signatures even at higher redshift ($z=0.6-1.0$). Our results reveal that radiation pressure plays a crucial role in shaping MBHBs spectral and time-domain features, with implications for their identification in time-domain surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 Low-latency analyses of gravitational-wave (GW) data from LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA enable rapid detection of compact binary coalescences (CBC) and prompt sky localization, essential for electromagnetic follow-up in multi-messenger astronomy. We evaluate the performance and limitations of low-latency sky localization using BAYESTAR algorithm, and investigate the impact of low-significance Virgo triggers. We inject simulated CBC signals into Gaussian-stationary noise and into Virgo data from the second part of the third LIGO-Virgo observing run (O3b), then reconstruct skymaps across multiple detector network configurations. Localization accuracy is assessed using Percentile-Percentile plots, the Jaccard index, and the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Binary neutron star mergers are statistically consistent with ideal calibration, showing deviations below 3$\sigma$, particularly when Virgo is included in the network, whereas skymaps for neutron star--black hole and binary black hole mergers tend to be overconfident. Adding a third detector generally improves accuracy, but the searched area can degrade when Virgo's signal-to-noise ratio is low (SNR $\leq$ 5). For high-SNR events, relying on two detectors can mislocalize the source. Excluding Virgo can therefore cause the HL skymap to miss the true location when Virgo has strong antenna response, in such cases a three-detector configuration is required to recover the correct position and avoid misleading multi-messenger follow-up. We introduce diagnostics to flag problematic skymaps and apply them to O3 public alerts, recovering simulation-predicted trends and flagging a few anomalous morphologies. The results are relevant for improving rapid vetting of GW alerts and guiding observational strategies in multi-messenger astronomy.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent JWST observations have uncovered a population of compact, high-redshift ($z>6$) galaxies exhibiting extreme nebular conditions and enhanced nitrogen abundances that challenge standard chemical evolution paradigms. We present a joint UV and optical abundance analysis using a new suite of $\texttt{Cloudy}$ photoionization models covering a wide density range ($n_e=10^2-10^9$ cm$^{-3}$), combined with HST and JWST spectroscopy for a sample of star-forming galaxies across $0.0\lesssim z \lesssim10.6$. We find that assuming uniform, low-density conditions ($n_e\sim10^2$ cm$^{-3}$) in high-density environments ($n_e\sim10^5$ cm$^{-3}$) can bias nebular diagnostics by overestimating $T_e$ (up to 1800 K), overpredicting $\log U$ (by $>1$ dex), and underestimating O/H (up to 0.67 dex), while only modestly inflating N/O. Therefore, robust abundance determinations at high-$z$ require a multi-phase density model. Using this model, we recalculate O/H and N/O abundances for our sample and present the first $\log U$ diagnostics and ICFs for high-ionization UV N lines. We find that the UV tracers systematically overestimate N/O by $\sim0.3-0.4$ dex relative to the optical benchmark. We find that N/O increases with redshift, correlating with both $n_e$ and star formation rate surface density ($\rm\Sigma_{SFR}$), suggesting that N/O is temporarily enhanced in compact, high-pressure environments. However, the $n_e$ evolution with $z$ is more gradual than the $(1+z)^3$ scaling of virial halo densities, suggesting that $n_e$evolution is shaped by both cosmological structure growth and baryonic processes. These trends point to prompt N/O enrichment potentially driven by very massive stars, with key implications for interpreting UV emission and determining reliable chemical abundances from JWST observations of the early universe.

 - **Abstract**
 This thesis investigates the Epoch of Cosmic Reionization (EoR), a key period in the early Universe when the first luminous sources formed and their radiation transformed the intergalactic medium (IGM) from neutral to ionized. Understanding this process reveals how the first stars and galaxies formed, influenced their surroundings, and shaped large-scale structures. The work traces both hydrogen and helium reionization by identifying the sources that produced ionizing radiation and examining how this radiation affected the thermal and ionization history of the IGM. Using the SPICE cosmological radiation-hydrodynamics simulations, the first part analyzes the ultraviolet luminosity function (UVLF) of high-redshift galaxies. It shows that different supernova feedback models drive distinct UVLF variability across mass and redshift, potentially alleviating the bright-galaxy tension seen by JWST. The second part explores how spectra from ionizing sources i.e. single and binary stars, X-ray binaries, emission from the interstellar medium, and active galactic nuclei impact the timing, topology, and thermal history of hydrogen reionization and the Lyman-alpha forest. At lower redshifts, radiative-transfer simulations reveal how helium reionization driven by quasars progressed and how the timing and temperature of the IGM relate to quasar luminosity functions and He II Ly-alpha observations. Finally, predictions for the 3.5 cm hyperfine transition of singly ionized helium-3 offer a novel probe of the post-reionization IGM. Together, these studies combine galaxy formation, radiative processes, and IGM evolution to provide a coherent picture of cosmic reionization and its observable signatures.

 - **Abstract**
 The Sun's magnetic field shows the 11-year solar cycle and shorter periodicities, popularly known as the quasi-biennial oscillations (QBOs) and Rieger-type periods, or ``season of the Sun." Although several theories have been proposed to explain the origin of QBOs and Rieger-type periods, no single theory has widespread acceptance. We explore whether the \bl\ dynamo can produce Rieger-type periodicity and QBOs and investigate their underlying physical mechanisms. We use the observationally guided three-dimensional kinematic \bl\ dynamo model, which has emerged as a successful model for reproducing many characteristic features of the solar cycle. We use Morlet wavelet and global wavelet power spectrum techniques to analyze the data obtained from the model. In our model, we report QBOs and Rieger-type periods for the first time. Further, we investigate the individual \bl\ parameters (fluctuations in flux, latitude, time delay and tilt scatter) role in the occurrence of QBOs and Rieger-type periods. We find that while fluctuations in the individual parameters of the \bl\ process can produce QBOs and Rieger-type periodicity, their occurrence probability is enhanced when we consider combined fluctuations of all parameters in the \bl\ process. Finally, we find that with the increase of dynamo supercriticality, the model tends to suppress the generation of Rieger-type periodicity. Thus, this result supports earlier studies that suggest the solar dynamo is not highly supercritical.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. It has recently been suggested that angular diameter distances derived from comparing the variability timescales of blazars to angular size measurements with very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) may provide an alternative method to study the cosmological evolution of the Universe. Once the intrinsic brightness temperature ($T_{\rm int}$) is known, the angular diameter distance may be found without knowledge of the relativistic Doppler factor, opening up the possibility of a single rung distance measurement method from low $(z_{\rm cos}\ll1)$ to high $(z_{\rm cos}>4)$ redshifts. Aims. We aim to verify whether the variability-based estimates of the intrinsic brightness temperature of multiple active galactic nuclei (AGNs) converges to a common value. We also investigate whether the intrinsic brightness temperature changes as a function of frequency. Methods. We estimated the $T_{\rm int}$ of AGNs based on the flux variability of the radio cores of their jets. We utilized radio core light curves and size measurements of 75 sources at 15 GHz and of 37 sources at 43 GHz. We also derived $T_{\rm int}$ from a population study of the brightness temperatures of VLBI cores using VLBI survey data of more than $100$ sources at 24, 43, and 86 GHz. Results. Radio core variability-based estimates of $T_{\rm int}$ constrain upper limits of $\log_{10}T_{\rm int}$ [K]$<11.56$ at 15~GHz and $\log_{10}T_{\rm int}$ [K]$<11.65$ at 43 GHz under a certain set of geometric assumptions. The population analysis suggests lower limits of $\log_{10}T_{\rm int}$ [K]$>9.7$, $9.1$, and $9.3$ respectively at 24, 43, and 86 GHz. Even with monthly observations, variability-based estimates of $T_{\rm int}$ appear to be cadence-limited. Conclusions. Methods used to constrain $T_{\rm int}$ are more uncertain than previously thought. However, with improved datasets, the estimates should converge.

 - **Abstract**
 Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) on the early Sun may have profoundly influenced the planetary atmospheres of early Solar System planets. Flaring young solar analogues serve as excellent proxies for probing the plasma environment of the young Sun, yet their CMEs remain poorly understood. Here we report the detection of multi-wavelength Doppler shifts in Far-Ultraviolet (FUV) and optical lines during a flare on the young solar analog EK Draconis. During and before a Carrington-class ($\sim$10$^{32}$ erg) flare, warm FUV lines ($\sim$10$^5$ K) exhibit blueshifted emission at 300-550 km s$^{-1}$, indicative of a warm eruption. 10 minutes later, the H$\alpha$ line shows slow (70 km s$^{-1}$), long-lasting ($\gtrsim$2 hrs) blueshifted absorptions, suggesting a cool ($\sim$10$^4$ K) filament eruption. This provides evidence of multi-temperature and multi-component nature of a stellar CME. If Carrington-class flares/CMEs occurred frequently on the young Sun, they may have cumulatively impacted the early Earth's magnetosphere and atmosphere.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent discoveries have revealed exoplanets orbiting young Sun-like stars, offering a window into the early solar system. These young stars frequently produce extreme magnetic explosions known as superflares, roughly once a day, potentially leading to fast and massive coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Recent research have highlighted the importance of stellar CMEs, as these events and associated particles can trigger atmospheric loss and initiate chemical reactions in planetary atmospheres. However, the observation of these associated CMEs remains largely unexplored, marking a crucial first step in assessing the particle environment. Here we present the results of 5-years multi-wavelength observations of young Sun-like stars, providing the critical clues to the common picture of solar and stellar CMEs. First, through optical spectroscopic observations, we found four of fifteen superflares are associated with fast prominence eruptions, precursors to CMEs. The stellar data greatly resemble solar counterparts, indicating a common picture of solar/stellar eruptions. Second, one of the eruptions is associated with potential coronal dimming in X-rays, indicating that the prominence eruptions evolved into stellar CMEs propagating through interplanetary space. Furthermore, the extension of solar MHD model supports the above indication and suggests that the eruption originates from the active region inferred by Zeeman Doppler Imaging and TESS light curve modeling. This comprehensive study suggests that further advancing the use of solar model could provide the first empirical inputs into calculations of atmospheric escape/chemical reactions for young planets.

 - **Abstract**
 Wide-angle tail (WAT) and narrow-angle tail (NAT) radio active galactic nuclei (RAGNs) are key tracers of dense environments in galaxy groups and clusters, yet no machine-learning classifier of bent RAGNs has been trained using both unlabeled data and purely visually inspected labels. We release the RGC Python package, which includes two newly preprocessed labeled datasets of 639 WATs and NATs derived from a publicly available catalog of visually inspected sources, along with a semi-supervised RGC model that leverages 20,000 unlabeled RAGNs. The two labeled datasets in RGC were preprocessed using PyBDSF which retains spurious sources, and Photutils which removes them. The RGC model integrates the self-supervised framework BYOL (Bootstrap YOur Latent) with the supervised E2CNN (E2-equivariant Convolutional Neural Network) to form a semi-supervised binary classifier. The RGC model, when trained and evaluated on a dataset devoid of spurious sources, reaches peak performance, attaining an accuracy of 88.88% along with F1-scores of 0.90 for WATs and 0.85 for NATs. The model's attention patterns amid class imbalance suggest that this work can serve as a stepping stone toward developing physics-informed foundation models capable of identifying a broad range of AGN physical properties.
#### Ultraviolet Spectral Evidence for Ansky as a Slowly Evolving Featureless Tidal Disruption Event with Quasi-periodic Eruptions

 - **Abstract**
 X-ray quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are rare and enigmatic phenomena that increasingly show a connection to tidal disruption events (TDEs). However, the recently discovered QPEs in ZTF19acnskyy ("Ansky") appear to be linked to an active galactic nucleus (AGN) rather than a TDE, as their slow decay and AGN-like variability differ markedly from that of typical TDEs. This finding may imply broader formation channels for QPEs. To further investigate Ansky's nature, we obtained a timely ultraviolet (UV) spectrum, which reveals a featureless, TDE-like spectrum devoid of broad optical or UV emission lines. Additionally, the steep UV continuum, fitted by a power law with an index of -2.6, aligns more closely with TDEs than with AGNs. Compared to other featureless TDEs, Ansky exhibits a significantly lower blackbody luminosity (10^43 erg s^-1) and much longer rise and decay timescales, suggesting a distinct TDE subclass. An offset TDE involving an intermediate-mass black hole is unlikely, given its position consistent with the galactic center with a 3 sigma upper limit of 54 pc. Instead, we propose that Ansky may result from the tidal disruption of a post-main-sequence star by a typical supermassive black hole. Our findings strengthen the growing evidence for TDE-QPE associations, although other formation channels for QPEs remain plausible and await future observational efforts.

 - **Abstract**
 Photometric and spectroscopic studies of four long-period low mass-ratio contact binaries, V0508 And, V0844 Aur, V0699 Cep, and NSVS 6259046, are performed. V0508 And, V0844 Aur, and V0699 Cep are found to be A-type low-mass-ratio medium-contact binaries, while NSVS 6259046 is found to be an A-type deep-contact binary. O - C analysis indicates no long-term variation in V0844 Aur. However, the orbital periods of the other three targets are increasing. We conclude that V0844 Aur, V0699 Cep and NSVS 6259046 are magnetically active, as evidenced by the presence and variable nature of the O'Connell effect in these systems. By analyzing the LAMOST spectroscopic data, we find out that NSVS 6259046 and V0508 And exhibit no chromospheric activity on the dates the LAMOST spectra were taken, while the low signal-to-noise ratio in LAMOST data for V0844 Aur prevents us from obtaining reliable results. We discover that V0699 Cep is an early-type contact binary with chromospheric activity. Their initial masses and ages are calculated. All four systems are determined to be currently stable. We collect 217 contact binaries with both spectroscopic and photometric observations, and compare the differences between short-period and long-period systems in terms of mass-luminosity relation and mass-radius relation, using 0.7 days as the period boundary.
#### SHELLQs-JWST: Revealing the Spectra of Extended Emission in 12 z > 6 Quasar Host Galaxies using the JWST NIRSpec Fixed Slit

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of the rest frame optical JWST NIRSpec Fixed Slit spectra of extended host galaxy emission in 12 quasars from the Subaru High-z Exploration of Low-Luminosity Quasars (SHELLQs) sample at redshifts 6.0 < z < 6.4. The spatial point spread function is modeled primarily by a sum of two Gaussians as a function of wavelength and is used to fit and subtract the quasar from the 2D spectra, leaving only extended galaxy emission which we analyze. Ten of 12 systems show spatially extended line emission and five of 12 systems show an extended stellar continuum. From the extended [OIII]5008 emission line, we measure a 132 ${\pm}$ 19 km/s ionized outflow in one system and 52 ${\pm}$ 12 km/s rotation, suggesting a coherent disk, in another. From the extended narrow H${\alpha}$ emission, which we hypothesize is ionized by star-forming regions rather than the quasar, we measure star formation rates ranging from ${\sim}$ 7 to 111 M${_\odot}$/yr, the majority of which are consistent with the star-forming main sequence at z ${\approx}$ 6. The positions of our host galaxies on the log10[OIII]5008/H${\beta}$ vs. log10[NII]6584/H${\alpha}$ (R3N2) Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) diagram indicate ionization rates typical of AGN activity in the low-redshift universe, but are consistent with the placement of similar z ${\approx}$ 6 quasar host galaxies, suggesting that the R3N2 line ratios cannot distinguish AGN and star-formation powered line emission at high redshifts. We conclude from the consistency between our quasar host sample with z ${\sim}$ 6 galaxies that the presence of a low-luminosity AGN causes little significant change in the properties of galaxies at z ${\approx}$ 6 on 10 Myr timescales.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed, spatially resolved Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) analysis of ESO 137-G034, a Compton-thick Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN), based on narrowband {\it HST} imaging in [O III], [S II], H$\alpha$, and H$\beta$ emission lines. We dissect the Interstellar Medium (ISM) into Seyfert-, LINER-, and H II-dominated regions with a resolution of $\sim0.1^{\prime\prime}$ ($\sim20$ pc at $z=0.009$). To characterize the fine spatial structure of the { different excitation mechanism}, we introduce a new parameter: the Seyfert/LINER Index (SLI), defined as the perpendicular distance of each point in the BPT diagram from the Seyfert/LINER division line. The narrowband optical emission exhibits a bi-conical morphology and traces the diffuse X-ray emission observed with \textit{Chandra}. Most of the emission within the bi-cones is Seyfert-like, with SLI values consistent with AGN photoionization. The North-West Seyfert cone is surrounded by a $\sim100$--$200$ pc thick LINER cocoon with a smooth, monotonic SLI profile, shaped by either AGN wind-ISM interactions, and/or obscured AGN radiation; three radial SLI peaks suggest episodic nuclear outbursts, with estimated timescales of a few $10^3$ yrs and $<100$ yrs duration. The South-East cone shows inhomogeneous excitation, with a higher SLI region in its inner part, coinciding with a wider region of enhanced soft emission and the radio lobe inner edge. This region is characterized by line ratios consistent with fast shocks ($>1000$ km s$^{-1}$) induced excitation. The LINER cocoon in the SE cone appears more irregular, with inter-cone LINER points likely shaped by both local ISM structure and shocks. Our findings highlight the complex interplay of different AGN feedback mechanisms in the ISM.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed analysis of the X-ray emission of the Compton-thick (CT) AGN ESO 137-G034 based on deep ($\sim230$ ks) Chandra observations. As in other CT AGNs, the morphology of the emission is elongated, approximately following the [O III] ionization bicone. With spatially resolved spectral modeling, we show that the extended emission within the bi-cone regions { is most readily explained} as from a mixture of photo-ionized gas and shock-heated plasma, reflecting the combined effects of radiative and kinematic AGN feedback. By comparing the morphology of the { X-ray emission in narrow spectral bands and that of the 3 cm radio jet, we find suggestive evidence of thermal, possibly shocked emission associated with the SE termination of the radio jet. This interpretation is also supported by the lack of [O III] relative to the $0.3-3.0$ keV flux in the inner $3^{\prime\prime}$ ($\sim600$ pc) of the SE cone, which would be consistent with an additional thermal X-ray component on top of the photonized emission of an outflowing wind. A similar effect is only seen within the inner $1^{\prime\prime}$ ($200$ pc) of the NW cone. In the radial profile of the [OIII]/X-ray flux ratio and the X-ray hardness ratio within the inner $\sim3^{\prime\prime}$ ($\sim600$ pc) of the SE cone we see an asymmetry, with no counterpart in the NW cone. We detect soft extended X-ray emission in the cross-cones which may originate from the interaction of an embedded radio jet with a clumpy interstellar medium (ISM). }These results highlight the { importance of both} radiative and mechanical feedback in shaping the circumnuclear environment of ESO 137-G034.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnesium (Mg) isotopic ratios offer valuable insights into stellar nucleosynthesis and Galactic chemical evolution, particularly in distinguishing contributions from supernovae and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. These isotopes are accessible via MgH molecular features in cool stellar atmospheres, though their measurement remains challenging across spectral types. We assess the reliability of MgH spectral regions for extracting magnesium isotopic ratios ($^{24}$Mg, $^{25}$Mg, $^{26}$Mg) in stars from M to G types and evaluate consistency with nucleosynthetic expectations. Using spectrum synthesis, we applied an analysis pipeline, validated by three well-studied reference stars, to a sample of five additional dwarf and giant stars. Individual MgH band regions were analysed for sensitivity to isotopic variation. Europium (Eu) and barium (Ba) abundances were also measured to explore correlations with Mg isotopic ratios as r- and s-process proxies. Of ten previously studied MgH wavelength regions, we identify seven as most reliable for isotopic analysis; others showed limited sensitivity across stellar types. Derived Mg isotope ratios ($^{24}$Mg, $^{25}$Mg, $^{26}$Mg) include: HD 11695-81:7:12; HD 18884-81:7:12; HD 18907-69:9:23; HD 22049-71:16:13; HD 23249-66:13:22; HD 128621-67:17:16; HD 10700-78:10:12; HD 100407-65:10:25. Comparison of Eu abundances with Mg isotopes reveals strong correlations, particularly with ($^{24}$Mg, which is predominantly produced by hydrostatic $\alpha$-capture in massive stars, a process preceding the r-process responsible for Eu. In contrast, Ba shows no significant correlation with $^{25}$Mg or $^{26}$Mg, despite their shared s-process origin. Our results demonstrate that selected MgH regions can reliably measure Mg isotopes in cool stars, providing a reproducible framework for future studies of stellar nucleosynthesis and Galactic chemical evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 In the presence of a background magnetic field, axions or axion-like particles (ALPs) can be resonantly converted to photons when their mass is nearly equal to the effective photon mass. In this paper, we propose a novel method to constrain the parameter space of ALPs by investigating the resulting imprints of axion-photon conversion in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations. We show that a helical magnetic field existing prior to the CMB epoch can generate an excess population of photons carrying net circular polarization due to the axion-photon conversion mechanism. Consequently, current measurements of the angular power spectrum of circular polarization ($V$-mode) in the CMB can be used to constrain the parameter space of ALP mass and its coupling to photons. In the optimistic scenario of a maximally helical magnetic field with strength $\sim {\rm nG}$, we find that CLASS observations at $40 \, {\rm GHz}$ can probe the previously unconstrained regions of axion-photon coupling corresponding to ALP masses in the range $10^{-10}-10^{-8} \, {\rm eV}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Weak lensing magnification probes the correlation between galaxies and the underlying matter field in a similar fashion to galaxy-galaxy lensing shear. Although it has long been sidelined in favor of the latter on the grounds of a poorer performance in terms of statistical significance, the provision of a large sample of high-redshift submillimeter galaxies by the \emph{Herschel} observatory has transformed the landscape of cosmic magnification due to their optimal physical properties for magnification analyses. This review aims to summarize the core principles and unique advantages of cosmic magnification on high-redshift submillimeter galaxies and discuss recent results applied for cosmological inference. The outlook and challenges of this observable are also outlined, with a focus on the ample scope for exploration and its potential to emerge as a competitive independent cosmological probe.

 - **Abstract**
 SDSSJ1539+3954 ($z\approx 1.935$), a radio-quiet weak-line quasar (WLQ), exhibited exceptional X-ray variability in 2019$-$2020, with its X-ray flux increasing by over 20 times from 2013 to 2019 and subsequently dropping by at least a factor of nine in 2020. Motivated by the empirical correlations between X-ray and radio emission in AGN cores, we carried out a follow-up radio study in the 0.3$-$10 GHz range using GMRT (2020, 2022, 2024) and VLA (2022), and analyzed archival VLASS 3 GHz data (2017-2023) to investigate the source's radio properties and potential connection with the X-ray behavior. Our observations reveal a compact radio source with a spectral index of -0.65$\pm$0.15 in the frequency range of 0.3$-$1.4 GHz and -1.09$\pm$0.16 in 3$-$10 GHz. While the source was undetected in VLA-FIRST (1994) and VLASS epochs, the GMRT and VLA observations show no statistically significant variability over the monitored period. The absence of detectable changes in the radio flux, despite strong X-ray variability, suggests no direct connection between the X-ray variability and the radio emission, consistent with the Thick-Disk plus Outflow (TDO) model for WLQs. However, the sensitivity limit of the surveys prevents us from drawing definitive conclusions regarding longer timescale variability between the VLA-FIRST and GMRT epochs. We further explore possible mechanisms driving the radio emission from this source. Our analysis rules out small-scale jets and coronal emission as the primary drivers of the radio emission, suggesting that extended emission from AGN winds and star formation is the more plausible mechanism.

 - **Abstract**
 We presented the multi-wavelength afterglow fitting results for three events that exhibit late afterglow re-brightening behavior: EP240414a ($z=0.402$), GRB 240529A ($z=2.695$), and GRB 240218A ($z=6.782$), which span a broad range of redshifts, from the local to the high-redshift universe. We prove that the peculiar afterglow light curves of three bursts can be well fitted by structured jets propagated in free-to-shocked stellar wind environment of stellar wind blown bubbles. This scenario offers a self-consistent explanation for the observed subclass of afterglows that exhibit rebrightening that characterized by steep rises and rapid decays. It also provides a unified solution for such events and offers pathways to study both the jet generation mechanism and the propagation process of jets through the envelope of progenitor. This study reveals that the structured jets produced by such events exhibit a narrow jet core and a steep angle-dependent energy decay index, suggesting highly magnetized jets. The derived transition radii from free stellar winds to shocked stellar winds for all three events are smaller than 0.5 pc, with statistical analysis of similar events indicating a median value of 0.1 pc, which conflicts with numerical simulation results. We anticipate that future observations by EP/SVOM missions will enhance the understanding of analogous events and further reveil information about progenitors and the circum-environments.

 - **Abstract**
 The Mittelman-di Cicco-Walker (MDW) H$\alpha$ Sky Survey is an autonomously-operated all-sky narrow-band (3nm) H$\alpha$ imaging survey. The survey was founded by amateur astronomers and the northern sky (Decl. $\geq$ 0$^\circ$) is presented here in its second stage of refinement for academic use. Each 3.6$\times$3.6 sq. deg MDW field has 12 20-minute individual exposures with a pixel scale of 3.6", a typical PSF of 6", and a stack point source depth of 16-17 magnitudes. The northern MDW Survey Data Release 1 (DR1) includes: calibrated and raw mean and individual images, star-removed mean fields, and point source catalogs for all images matched to Data Release 1 of the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS1) and the INT Galactic Plane Survey (IGAPS). Our initial study of H$\alpha$ filament widths finds a typical FWHM of 30-45" in the Lyra region. The matched catalogs (with a median match distance of ~0.5"), combined with our distinctive narrow-band photometry, are used to identify H$\alpha$ variable and excess sources. These initial studies highlight some of the many scientific uses of the MDW H$\alpha$ survey.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigated the possibility of determining the mechanism of the FU Orionis-type outburst based on molecular line observations of protoplanetary disks with synthetic observations of distinct numerical burst models. The morphology of the synthetic $\mathrm{C^{18}O}$ emission is sensitive to gas temperature and does not coincide with the actual gas disk structures, particularly in the magnetorotational instability (MRI) and clump-infall models, which exhibit peculiar temperature distributions. This highlights the need for careful interpretation of morphologies of line emission from disks under accretion outbursts. The synthetic $\mathrm{C^{18}O}$ emission of each model exhibits distinct kinematic features that can be used to distinguish outburst scenarios. In the MRI model, kinematic features of the gravitational instability (GI), which fuels MRI-driven accretion bursts, are small in both amplitude and spatial extent, resulting in no prominent local features in the residual velocity map at a typical distance for FU Orionis-type objects. In contrast, the clump-infall model shows a clear sign of gas expansion along a spiral, which is caused by exchange of angular momentum between an infalling clump and surrounding gas. The intruder model exhibits a highly asymmetric velocity structure with respect to the systemic velocity of the primary protostar in velocity channel maps. These distinct kinematic features may serve as promising diagnostics for distinguishing the physical mechanisms responsible for FU Orionis-type outbursts.
#### Revisiting the 150 MHz Radio Luminosity Function of Star-Forming Galaxies with LOFAR Deep Fields through a Refined Statistical Framework

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive analysis of the 150~MHz radio luminosity function (LF) of star-forming galaxies (SFGs) using deep observations from the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey in the ELAIS-N1, Boötes, and Lockman Hole fields. Our sample comprises $\sim$56,000 SFGs over $0 < z < 5.7$. We first analyze the deepest field (ELAIS-N1), then jointly model all three fields while accounting for their distinct flux limits and selection functions. Using adaptive kernel density estimation (KDE), we reconstruct the LF continuously across redshift and luminosity without binning or parametric assumptions. The KDE results reveal clear signatures of joint luminosity and density evolution (LADE). Motivated by this, we construct and fit three parametric models--pure luminosity evolution (PLE) and two LADE variants--using a full maximum-likelihood method that includes completeness corrections and constraints from the local radio LF and Euclidean-normalized source counts (SCs). Model selection using Akaike and Bayesian Information Criteria strongly favors LADE over PLE. For ELAIS-N1, the more flexible LADE model (Model C) provides the best fit, while for the combined fields, the simpler Model B balances fit quality and complexity more effectively. Both LADE models reproduce the observed LFs and SCs across luminosity and flux density ranges, whereas PLE underperforms. We also identify a mild excess at the bright end of the LF, likely due to residual AGN contamination. This study demonstrates that combining KDE with parametric modeling offers a robust framework for quantifying the evolving radio LF of SFGs, paving the way for future work with next-generation surveys like the SKA.

 - **Abstract**
 Newly emerging flux (NEF) has been widely studied as a trigger of solar filament eruptions, but its influence on the subsequent dynamics remains poorly explored. Because NEF typically emerges adjacent to filaments, it imposes magnetic asymmetry that can drive non-radial eruptions and complicate space-weather forecasting. We bridge analytic catastrophe theory with 2D resistive MHD simulations: analytic solutions provide magnetic configurations containing a flux rope at the loss-of-equilibrium point, which are then used as initial conditions for simulations to examine the following dynamics. We find that NEF governs the kinematics of filament eruptions in two ways. First, by reshaping coronal stability, NEF can create or eliminate a higher equilibrium in corona, thereby producing failed eruptions or CMEs. In the transitional situation where a metastable equilibrium appears, the rising filament decelerates and stalls before re-accelerating into a CME, consistent with observed two-step eruptions. Second, by breaking symmetry, NEF deflects eruptions away from the radial direction: depending on its polarity, it acts as a repulsor or an attractor on eruptive filaments, and the deflection magnitude increases with the degree of asymmetry. Our theory yields two characteristic angles that predict the deflection directions of CMEs and failed eruptions, and simulations closely aligns with these predictors. These results highlight the NEF not only as a trigger but also as a key factor that governs both the acceleration and deflection of eruptions during their propagation in the low corona.

 - **Abstract**
 The morphology of ionized gas velocity maps provides a direct probe of the internal gas kinematics of galaxies. Using integral field spectroscopy from SDSS-IV MaNGA, we analyze a sample of 528 low-inclination, regular disk galaxies to investigate the correlations between velocity map morphology, star formation rate, and gas-phase metallicity. We quantify velocity map morphology using harmonic expansion and adopt two complementary diagnostics: the global kinematic asymmetry, which traces non-axisymmetric perturbations, and the first-order term ratio, which captures axisymmetric radial motions. We find that galaxies with higher kinematic asymmetry are more likely to deviate from the scaling relations, typically lying either above or below the star formation main sequence and systematically below the mass-metallicity relation. In contrast, the first-order term ratio shows only a correlation with gas-phase metallicity in the low-mass range and no significant dependence on star formation rate. Moreover, galaxies below the mass-metallicity relation generally exhibit higher HI gas fractions. These results suggest that external gas accretion is the primary driver of the observed phenomena: inflowing metal-poor gas increases velocity map asymmetry in disk galaxies, dilutes the metallicity, and triggers enhanced star formation. Feedback-driven outflows, bar- and spiral-driven inflows, and galaxy mergers may also contribute, but likely play a secondary role.

 - **Abstract**
 We present optical observations of the Type IIb supernova (SN) 2017ckj, covering approximately 180 days after the explosion. Its early-time multi-band light curves display no clear evidence of a shock-cooling tail, resembling the behavior of SN2008ax. The $V$-band light curve exhibits a short rise time of about 5 days and reaches an absolute peak magnitude of $M_{\rm V}=-18.58\pm0.17\mathrm{mag}$. The late-time multi-band light curves reveal a linear decline. We modelled the bolometric light curve of SN2017ckj to constrain the progenitor and the explosion parameters. We estimated a total mass of $\rm ^{56}Ni$ synthesized by SN2017ckj of $M_{\rm Ni} = 0.21^{+0.05}_{-0.03}\ M_\odot$, with a massive H-rich envelope of $M_{\rm env} = 0.4^{+0.1}_{-0.1}\ M_\odot$. Both the $\rm ^{56}Ni$ mass and the envelope mass of SN2017ckj are higher than those of typical SNe IIb, in agreement with its peculiar light curve evolution. The early-time spectra of SN2017ckj are dominated by a blue continuum, accompanied by narrow $\rm H_\alpha$ and \Heii emission lines. The earliest spectrum exhibits flash ionization features, from which we estimated a progenitor mass-loss rate of $\sim 3.4\times10^{-4}M_\odot \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. At later epochs, the spectra develop broad P-Cygni profiles and become increasingly similar to those of SNe IIb, especially SN2018gk. The late-time spectrum at around 139 days does not show a distinct decline in the strength of $\rm H_\alpha$ emission profile, also indicating a relatively massive envelope of its progenitor. Aside from the $\rm H_\alpha$ feature, the nebular spectrum exhibits prominent emission lines of \Oi, \Caii, [\Caii], and \Mgi], which are consistent with the prototypical SN1993J.

 - **Abstract**
 We present spatially resolved mass outflow rates of the ionized and molecular gas in the narrow line region of the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 3227. Using long-slit spectroscopy and [O III] imaging from from Hubble Space Telescope's Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph and Apache Point Observatory's Kitt Peak Ohio State Multi-Object Spectrograph, in conjunction with Cloudy photoionization models and emission line diagnostics, we find a peak ionized mass outflow rate of $\dot M_{\text{ion}} =$ $19.9\pm9.2$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ at a distance of $47\pm6$ pc from the supermassive black hole (SMBH). Using archival data from the Gemini-North Near-infrared Field Spectrograph measuring H$_2$ $\lambda2.1218$ $\mu$m emission, we find a maximum peak warm molecular outflow rate of $\dot M_{\mathrm{H_2}} \le 9 \times 10^{-4}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ at a distance of $36\pm6$ pc from the SMBH. Using archival data from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array measuring CO(2-1) emission, we find a maximum peak cold molecular gas mass outflow rate of $\dot M_{\mathrm{CO}} \le$ $23.1$ M$_\odot$ year$^{-1}$ at a distance of $57\pm6$ pc from the SMBH. For the first time, we calculate spatially resolved gas evacuation timescales for the cold molecular gas reservoirs ostensibly sourcing the outflows, and find that evacuating gas to $\sim$400 pc from the SMBH occurs on timescales of $10^{6.0} - 10^{7.6}$ years. These results indicate that the multi-phase AGN outflows are effective in clearing the inner few hundred parsecs of NGC 3227's gas content on timescales that may set the AGN duty cycle of $10^5 - 10^8$ years.

 - **Abstract**
 Sunspots or active regions (ARs) with a delta-magnetic configuration are known to be associated with strong eruptions such as flares and mass ejections. This article investigates the relationship between delta-ARs and flares over the course of three solar cycles (SCs), from 1996 to 2024, with respect to the former's area, lifetime, latitudinal distribution, and phase of its magnetic complexity. Solar cycle 25 has produced the least number of delta-ARs in comparison to the previous two solar cycles, yet the number of M- and X-class flares exceed that of cycle 24 by 25%. Flare occurrence is higher in C-, M-, and X-class events during the presence of the delta-configuration which is seen in all 3 SCs. The total number of flares produced by delta- and non-delta-ARs were 15875 and 17033, respectively across all 3 SCs. The latter are dominated by B- and C-class flares, while the number of M- and X-class flares across all 3 SCs was significantly less than compared to delta-ARs. The median lifetime of an AR in the delta- and non-delta phase is about 5 and 8 days, respectively. The typical number of flares produced by a delta-AR is 20, with maximum values ranging from 80-156 for lifetimes between 6-13 days. However, about 30% of delta-ARs do not produce flares when their lifetimes are between 6-12 days. The latitudinal distribution of delta-ARs across the northern and southern hemispheres is nearly symmetric on either side of the equator for SCs 23 and 24, peaking around +/-10 deg-20 deg. For solar cycles 23 and 24, about 30% of the host delta-ARs have an area exceeding the mean value over the above latitudinal belt while for SC 25, there is a large scatter possibly due to the cycle still being in progress. It remains to be seen if the latter phase of SC 25 will be as active as its earlier phase and whether the number of delta-ARs emerging during that period scale with the total sunspot number.

 Context. The interplay between surface magnetic topology and chromospheric heating in active M dwarfs remains poorly constrained, limiting our understanding of their magnetic cycles and high-energy environments. Aims. We aim to test whether detailed Zeeman-Doppler imaging (ZDI) maps of AD Leo can be used to spatially anchor a multi-component chromospheric model and validate the link between magnetic flux distribution and emission-line formation. Methods. We analyze high-resolution CARMENES spectra of H-alpha and the Ca II infrared triplet, together with ZDI maps. Synthetic profiles are computed using the RH1.5D non-LTE radiative transfer code with two active atmospheric components (low-latitude near the equator and polar near the pole) and a quiet background. Their relative filling factors and temperature structures are optimized per epoch. The ZDI maps serve as qualitative references for the large-scale magnetic topology but are not used as input to the optimization. Results. Our model reproduces the spectral line profiles across multiple epochs. The low-latitude active region shows notable variability, accounting for approximately 55-86% of the emission, while the polar region remains relatively constant in area (12-17%) but exhibits temperature variations over time, particularly during periods of increased activity. The spatial locations of the active regions derived from spectroscopy agree well with the radial magnetic field distribution from ZDI. Conclusions. Combining spectroscopic modeling with magnetic field maps is an effective approach for mapping magneto-chromospheric structures in M dwarfs. This framework deepens our understanding of stellar magnetic cycles and chromospheric dynamics, paving the way for detailed time-resolved studies in active low-mass stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Very high energy (VHE) gama rays above 100 GeV are expected to undergo significant attenuation during cosmic propagation due to pair production with thr extralactic background light (EBL). However, recent observations - particulary the tentative detection of gamma ray burst GRB 221009A up to 18 TeV by LHASSO and up to 251 TeV by Carpet-2, challenge the predictions of classical EBL absorption models. These exceptionally high-energy photons suggest the possibility of new physics affecting photon propagation over cosmological distances. In this context, the gamma-ray spectrum in the tens to hundreds of TeV range serves as a valuable probe for potential Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) effects or for modifications to photon attenuation due to axion-like particles (ALPs) mixing with photons in cosmic magnetic fields. However, both LIV and ALPs explanations, when considered separately, face certain limitations in fully accounting for the observed transparency. In this paper, we propose a unified framework that combines the effects of ALPs and LIV to explain the unexpectedly high survival probability of VHE photons. Specifically, we investigate the multi-wavelength spectrum of GRB 221009A under this synergistic scenario, demonstrating that for photons at 18 TeV and 251 TeV, the combined influence of ALPs with coupling $g_{a\gamma} = 13.353 \times 10^{-11}\ \mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ and mass $m_a = 9.492 \times 10^{-7}\ \mathrm{eV}$, together with LIV characterized by energy scales $E_1 = 2.4~E_{\rm Planck}$ for $n = 1$ , can substantially enhance the photon survival probability. This synergy offers a compelling explanation for the observed VHE gamma-ray transparency in extreme astrophysical environments.

 - **Abstract**
 With the rapid advancements in next-generation ground-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors, it is anticipated that $10^3$-$10^5$ binary neutron star (BNS) mergers per year will be detected, with a significant fraction accompanied by observable merger-nova signals through future sky surveys. Merger-novae are typically powered by the radioactive decay of heavy elements synthesized via the r-process. If the post-merger remnant is a long-lived rapid-rotating neutron star, the merger-nova can be significantly enhanced due to strong magnetized winds. In this paper, we generate mock BNS merger samples using binary population synthesis model and classify their post-merger remnants--black hole (BH) and magnetar, (i.e., long-lived supramassive NS and stable NS), based on results from numerical simulations. We then construct merger-nova radiation models to estimate their luminosity function. We find that the luminosity function may exhibit a distinctive triple-peak structure, with the relative positions and heights of these peaks depending on the equation of state (EOS) of the BNS. Furthermore, we estimate the average Target-of-Opportunity (ToO) detection efficiency $\langle f_{\rm eff} \rangle$ with the Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST) and find that due to possible enhanced luminosity, the largest source redshift with $\langle f_{\rm eff} \rangle>0.1$ can be enlarged from $z_{\rm s}\sim 0.5$ to $z_{\rm s}\sim 1-1.5$. Besides, we also generate the detectable mass spectrum for merger-novae by $\langle f_{\rm eff}\rangle$, which may provide insights to the ToO searching strategy.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a phenomenological study demonstrating the feasibility of using olivine xenoliths from the Chaîne des Puys as a time-resolved paleo-detector array to probe the cosmic-ray flux over the last 40,000 years. This volcanic region provides a unique chronosequence of samples brought to the surface by well-dated eruptions. By modeling the expected density of nuclear recoil tracks induced by cosmic-ray muons in olivine, we show that the signal is detectable and above backgrounds from natural radioactivity. We demonstrate that by analyzing samples with different exposure ages, it is possible to construct a time-differential measurement of the cosmic-ray flux. This method shows sensitivity to historical variations, such as the enhanced flux expected during the Laschamp geomagnetic excursion ($\sim$41~kyr) and the potential contribution from nearby supernovae, for which we use the Antlia supernova remnant precursor as a benchmark. This work establishes a new application of the paleo-detector technique for long-scale time-domain high-energy astrophysics and provides the direct scientific motivation for experimental efforts to measure these track records.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic winds are a key mechanism for angular momentum removal in young stars. In this work, we aim at characterizing the multi-component outflow of RU Lup. The unprecedented high resolution of the Echelle SPectrograph for Rocky Exoplanets and Stable Spectroscopic Observations (ESPRESSO) enabled a detailed study of the forbidden emission lines and the blueshifted absorption in the lines of the Na I and Ca II doublets, which we resolved in three discrete absorption components at low, medium, and high velocities. We developed a method that disentangles vertical and toroidal velocities in the absorption components and infers the wind launching radius, magnetic lever arm, and mass-loss rate. We identified a low-velocity broad component in the [O I] 5577 line, consistent with a rotating magnetohydrodynamic disk wind launched near the disk truncation radius. We showed that the discrete absorption components trace spatially and physically distinct regions of the outflow. The medium and low velocity components are launched from the inner disk (< 6.76 stellar radii) with low lever arms indicative of warm, highly mass-loaded streamlines. However, the two components differ mainly in vertical velocity. The low velocity absorption is consistent with an outer absorbing shell, while the medium velocity absorption forms near the disk truncation radius. Its higher vertical velocity is compatible with either a slightly larger lever arm, or additional heating at the base of the flow. For plausible ionization levels in the inner disk, this outflow component removes a substantial fraction of the accretion spin-up torque. In conclusion, our work shows that RU Lup hosts a stratified, rotating, warm disk wind launched across a narrow annulus near the disk truncation radius, which is sufficiently mass-loaded to extract a large amount of the stellar spin-up torque. The observations disfavor an X-wind scenario.

 - **Abstract**
 BEBOP-3 is detached eclipsing binary star that shows total eclipses of a faint M~dwarf every 13.2 days by a 9$^{\rm th}$-magnitude F9V star. High precision radial velocity measurements have recently shown that this binary star is orbited by a planet with an orbital period $\approx 550$ days. The extensive spectroscopy used to detect this circumbinary planet has also been used to directly measure the masses of the stars in the eclipsing binary. We have used light curves from the TESS mission combined with these mass measurements to directly measure the following radii and surface gravities for the stars in this system: $R_1 = 1.386 \pm 0.010\,R_{\odot}$, $\log g_1 = 4.190 \pm 0.004$, $R_2 = 0.274 \pm 0.002\,R_{\odot}$, $\log g_2 = 4.979 \pm 0.002$. We describe an improved version of our method to measure the effective temperatures (T$_{\rm eff}$) of stars in binary systems directly from their angular diameters and bolometric fluxes. We measure T$_{\rm eff,1} = 6065{\rm\,K} \pm 44\,{\rm K}$ and T$_{\rm eff,2} = 3191{\rm\,K} \pm 40\,{\rm K}$ for the stars in BEBOP-3 using this method. BEBOP-3 can be added to our growing sample of stars that can be used test the accuracy of spectroscopic and photometric methods to estimate T$_{\rm eff}$ and $\log g$ for solar-type stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Flare ribbons serve as chromospheric footprints of energy deposition resulting from particle acceleration during magnetic reconnection. Their fine-scale structure provides a valuable tool for probing the dynamics of the flare reconnection process. Our goal is to investigate the fine-scale structure of flare ribbons through multiple observations of flares, utilising data obtained from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) and the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST). The aligned AIA and SST datasets for the three solar flares were used to examine their overall morphology. The SST datasets were specifically used to identify fine-scale structures within the flare ribbons. For spectroscopic analysis of these fine structures, we applied machine-learning methods (k-means clustering) and Gaussian fitting. Using k-means, we identified elongated features in the flare ribbons, termed as "riblets", which are short-lived and jet-like small-scale structures that extend as plasma columns from the flare ribbons. Riblets are more prominent near the solar limb and represent the ribbon front. Riblet widths are consistent across observations, ranging from 110-310 km (0".15-0".41), while vertical lengths span 620-1220 km (0".83-1".66), with a potential maximum of 2000 km (2".67), after accounting for projection effects. Detailed H-beta spectral analysis reveals that riblets exhibit a single, redshifted emission component, with velocities of 16-21 km s^1, independent of viewing angle. Our high-resolution observations of the three flare ribbons show that they are not continuous structures, but are composed of vertically extended, fine-scale substructures. These irregular features indicate that the reconnection region is not a smooth, laminar current sheet, but rather a fragmented zone filled with magnetic islands, consistent with the theory of patchy reconnection within the coronal current sheet.
#### Energetics of star-planet magnetic interactions: Novel insights from 3D modelling

 - **Abstract**
 Star-planet magnetic interactions (SPMI) occurring in the sub-Alfvenic regime can, in principle, induce stellar chromospheric hotspots. Currently, estimates of the power generated by SPMI primarily rely on analytical scaling laws that relate stellar and planetary parameters to the interaction energetics. The existing scaling laws published in the literature so far do not agree with each other by at least an order of magnitude. Our aim is to quantify an absolute upper limit on the power that a planet can channel back to its host star during such interactions, which in turn lead to the formation of stellar hotspots. By performing a series of 3D MHD simulations with varied parameters known to influence the energetics of SPMI, we derive a numerically supported scaling law that can be used to reliably estimate the energy channeled from the planet back to the star. Our results suggest that existing analytical scaling laws may not fully capture the power transferred from the planet to the star through SPMI. The scaling law derived from our numerical simulations appears to provide a more comprehensive estimate, reflecting dependencies on common stellar and planetary parameters also considered in earlier models. Moreover, our findings indicate that power generation involves not only the planetary obstacle itself but also the extended magnetic structure of the Alfven wings interacting with the streaming stellar wind. This study suggests that care should be taken when applying analogies directly from jovian sub-Alfvenic interactions to SPMI, as the underlying physical conditions (specifically the value of the Alfvenic Mach number) may not be directly comparable. Our numerically derived scaling law offers a potentially improved approach for estimating SPMI power, capturing some of the interaction's complexities exclusive to SPMI.

 - **Abstract**
 We measure and analyze the inflows and outflows of mass, energy, and metals through the interstellar medium (ISM) and circumgalactic medium (CGM) of galaxies in the IllustrisTNG100 simulations. We identify the dominant feedback mechanism in bins of halo virial mass and redshift by computing the integrated energy input from SNe and the ``kinetic'' and ``thermal'' mode of AGN feedback. We measure all quantities in a shell at the virial radius (``halo scale'') and one chosen to be approximately at the interface of the CGM and the interstellar medium (ISM; ``ISM scale''). We find that galaxies have strong net positive inflows on halo scales, and weaker but still net positive inflows on ISM scales, at $z\gtrsim 2$. At later times, partially due to the onset of kinetic AGN feedback in massive halos, inflows and outflows nearly balance one another, leading to the familiar effects of the slow-down of galaxy growth and the onset of quenching. Halos dominated by SN feedback show only weak evidence of preventative feedback on halo scales, and we see excess ISM scale accretion indicative of rapid gas recycling. Wind mass loadings decrease with increasing halo mass, and with increasing redshift, while energy loadings are nearly independent of both mass and redshift. The detailed catalogs of these mass, metal, and energy inflow and outflow rates on galaxy and halo scales can be used to guide empirical and semi-analytic models, and provide deeper insight into how galaxy growth and quenching is regulated in the IllustrisTNG simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 Evidence from seismic studies, mineral physics, thermal evolution models and geomagnetic observations is inconclusive about the presence of a stably stratified layer at the top of the Earth's fluid outer core. Such a convectively stable layer could have a strong influence on the internal fluid waves propagating underneath the core-mantle boundary (CMB) that are used to probe the outermost region of the core through the wave interaction with the geomagnetic field and the rotation of the mantle. Here, we numerically investigate the effect of a top stable layer on the outer core fluid waves by calculating the eigenmodes in a neutrally stratified sphere permeated by a magnetic field with and without a top stable layer. We use a numerical model, assuming a flow with an m-fold azimuthal symmetry, that allows for radial motions across the lower boundary of the stable layer and angular momentum exchanges across the CMB through viscous and electromagnetic coupling. On interannual time-scales, we find torsional Alfvén waves that are only marginally affected by weak to moderate stratification strength in the outer layer. At decadal time-scales similarly weak stable layers promote the appearance of waves that propagate primarily within the stable layer itself and resemble Magneto-Archimedes-Coriolis (MAC) waves, even though they interact with the adiabatic fluid core below. These waves can exert viscous and electromagnetic torques on the mantle that are several orders of magnitude larger than those in the neutrally stratified case.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetar giant flares (MGFs) are rare, extremely bright bursts of gamma-rays from highly magnetized neutron stars. These events are challenging to identify because, at extragalactic distances, they can appear similar to other astrophysical phenomena. Only a handful have been confidently identified to date, limiting our understanding of their origin and physical properties. This study focuses on expanding the sample of known events and enabling a more detailed characterization of their observational features and intrinsic properties, while introducing significant improvements in the methods used to identify and analyze them. When applied to archival data from the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) on the \Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, this approach added four previously unidentified events the known sample, expanding the total to 13 MGFs. This demonstrates both the effectiveness of the method and the likelihood that additional MGFs remain hidden in existing gamma-ray burst catalogs. We utilize this expanded sample to gain a deeper understanding of the broader population of MGFs. We develop a statistical modeling framework that combines previously considered data with modern observations from Fermi/GBM. The model accounts for instrumental sensitivity and the expected diversity in event characteristics. We infer a volumetric rate of events above $1.2\times10^{44}\,\rm{erg}$ of $R_{MGF}=5.5^{+4.5}_{-2.7}\times10^5\rm{Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}}$. The results show that individual magnetars must produce multiple flares throughout their lifetimes, reinforcing the idea that these are recurring phenomena rather than singular explosive events. Expanding the sample of known MGFs improves our understanding of magnetars and their role in other astrophysical phenomena, including possible links to fast radio bursts, gravitational waves, and the creation of heavy elements in extreme astrophysical environments.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a homogeneous catalog of 1,232 open clusters with precisely determined ages, metallicities, distances, extinctions, and stellar mass function (MF) slopes, derived from Gaia DR3 data. The parameters are inferred using the Mixture Model for Open clusters (MiMO), a novel Bayesian framework for modeling clusters in the color-magnitude diagram. By explicitly accounting for field-star contamination as a model component, MiMO removes the conventional need for stringent membership preselection, allowing for a more complete inclusion of member stars and thereby enhancing both precision and robustness. Our results broadly agree with existing catalogs but offer improved precision. For each cluster, we provide the best-fit age, metallicity, distance, extinction, and MF slope, along with their full likelihood chains and photometric membership probabilities for individual stars. We further identify an ``MF Prime'' subsample of 163 clusters with high-quality data, for which the MF estimates are considered most reliable. The catalog and an open-source implementation of MiMO are made publicly available to the community.

 - **Abstract**
 The thousands of open cluster (OC) candidates identified by the Gaia mission are significantly contaminated by false positives from field star fluctuations, posing a major validation challenge. Based on the Mixture Model for OCs (MiMO), we present a Bayesian framework for validating OC candidates in the color--magnitude diagram. The method compares the Bayesian evidence of two competing models: a single stellar population with field contamination versus a pure field population. Their ratio, the Bayes factor (BF), quantifies the statistical support for cluster existence. Tests on confirmed clusters and random fields show that a threshold of BF > 100 effectively distinguishes genuine clusters from chance field overdensities. This approach provides a robust, quantitative tool for OC validation and catalog refinement. The framework is extendable to multi-dimensional validation incorporating kinematics and is broadly applicable to other resolved stellar systems, including candidate moving groups, stellar streams, and dwarf satellites.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comparative study of transformer-based architectures for solar flare forecasting using heterogeneous data modalities, including images, video sequences, and time-series observations. Our analysis evaluates three recent foundational models - SigLIP2 for image encoding, VideoMAE for spatio-temporal video representation, and Moirai2 for multivariate time-series forecasting - applied to publicly available datasets of solar magnetograms from the SDO/HMI mission and soft X-ray fluxes acquired by GOES satellites. All models are trained and validated under consistent data splits and evaluation criteria, with the goal of assessing the strengths and limitations of transformer backbones across spatial and temporal representations of solar activity. We investigate multiple loss formulations (weighted BCE, focal, and score-oriented) and training balance strategies to mitigate class imbalance typical of flare datasets. Results show that while both SigLIP2 and VideoMAE achieve typical performance on image and video data (True Skill Statistic TSS~0.60-0.65), the time-series model Moirai2 reaches superior forecasting skill (TSS~0.74) using irradiance-based temporal evolution alone. These findings highlight the potential of pretrained transformer architectures and cross-modal learning for advancing operational space weather forecasting, paving the way toward unified multimodal models that integrate visual and temporal information.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the role of galactic bars in fuelling and triggering Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) in disc galaxies up to $z\sim 0.8$. We utilise a Deep Learning model, fine-tuned on Galaxy Zoo volunteer classifications, to identify (strongly and weakly) barred and unbarred disc galaxies in Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program $i$-band images. We select AGN using three independent diagnostics: mid-infrared colours, X-ray detections, and spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting. The SED analysis, performed using CIGALE, quantifies the relative AGN contribution to the total galaxy luminosity ($f_{\rm AGN}$) and the AGN luminosity ($L_{\rm disc}$). We assess the impact of bars by comparing AGN incidence and properties in barred galaxies against carefully constructed redshift-, stellar mass-, and colour-matched unbarred control samples. Our binary AGN classification experiment demonstrates that barred disc galaxies host a statistically detectable higher fraction of AGN compared to their unbarred counterparts, suggesting a contributing role for bars in the global AGN budget. The contribution of bars to AGN fuelling appears confined to systems where the AGN has a lower relative contribution to the host galaxy's emission ($f_{\rm AGN} < 0.75$). Crucially, we find a significant dearth of barred disc galaxies hosting AGN with $f_{\rm AGN} > 0.75$, independent of bar strength. Consistent with this, the fraction of barred galaxies among AGN hosts decreases with increasing $L_{\rm disc}$. Combined with previous results, we suggest that bars contribute to fuelling the population of low-to-moderate luminosity AGN, but major mergers are the principal mechanism for triggering the most powerful and dominant accretion events.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an unexplored scenario for interpreting the outflows in the EGO G338.92+0.55 (b) region (hereafter, EGO G338). Within this framework, we investigate the hypothesis that the interaction between two outflows is responsible for the observed morphology and kinematics of this astrophysical object. To explore this possibility, we reanalyse the region using observational molecular line data. We base our analysis on maps of moments 0, 1, and 2 of the CO emission associated with the molecular outflows. Additionally, we conduct three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations to examine the presence or absence of a collision between two jets. From our numerical results, we produce synthetic CO images to facilitate a direct comparison with observations. The findings of this study provide compelling evidence that the observed morphology and kinematics in the EGO G338 region are the result of a likely collision between two molecular outflows.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the discovery of SN 2025wny (ZTF25abnjznp/GOTO25gtq) and spectroscopic classification of this event as the first gravitationally lensed Type I superluminous supernovae (SLSN-I). Deep ground-based follow-up observations resolves four images of the supernova with ~1.7" angular separation from the main lens galaxy, each coincident with the lensed images of a background galaxy seen in archival imaging of the field. Spectroscopy of the brightest point image shows narrow features matching absorption lines at a redshift of z = 2.011 and broad features matching those seen in superluminous SNe with Far-UV coverage. We infer a magnification factor of 20 to 50 for the brightest image in the system, based on photometric and spectroscopic comparisons to other SLSNe-I. SN 2025wny demonstrates that gravitationally-lensed SNe are in reach of ground-based facilities out to redshifts far higher than what has been previously assumed, and provide a unique window into studying distant supernovae, internal properties of dwarf galaxies, as well as for time-delay cosmography.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a suite of high-resolution simulations to study how different stellar feedback channels regulate the growth of central intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) in dwarf galaxies hosting nuclear star clusters (NSCs). We employ a super-Lagrangian refinement scheme to resolve the self-gravity radius of the $\alpha$-accretion disc ($<0.01$~pc) and follow the gas inflows from the interstellar medium (ISM) to the black hole (BH), allowing for the self-consistent emergence of circumnuclear discs (CNDs). In the absence of stellar feedback, as expected, the galactic disc fragments excessively, producing a massive CND. When radiative stellar feedback is included, fragmentation is suppressed, with even more massive CNDs forming and feeding the IMBH. With supernova (SN) feedback only, clustered SNe strongly heat the ISM, yielding both the lowest CND masses and BH accretion rates. When both radiative stellar feedback and SNe are included, the CND becomes intermittent: it survives for $10$--$100$~Myr, and is then destroyed by feedback before being replenished by fresh galactic inflows, while substantial BH growth still takes place. These results highlight the critical importance of accurately modelling the combined effects of key stellar feedback processes to understand IMBH growth. Our simulation suite brackets the likely range of CND states, with IMBHs exhibiting significant growth and systematic spin-up in all dwarf galaxy models explored. These findings bode well for the detection of IMBHs with future observational facilities such as SKA, the Rubin Observatory, and LISA, and make them highly relevant progenitor candidates of the high-redshift supermassive BHs observed by JWST.

 - **Abstract**
 The Cosmic Vine is a massive protocluster at z=3.44 in the JWST CEERS field, offering an ideal laboratory for studying the early phases of cluster formation. Using the data from the DAWN JWST Archive, we conduct a comprehensive study on the large-scale structure, stellar mass function (SMF), quiescent members, and dark matter halos in the Cosmic Vine. First, we spectroscopically confirm 136 galaxies in the Vine at z=3.44, and an additional 47 galaxies belonging to a diffuse foreground structure at z=3.34 which we dub the Leaf. We identify four subgroups comprising the Cosmic Vine and two subgroups within the Leaf. Second, we identified 11 quiescent members with log(M*/Msun)=9.5-11.0, the largest sample of quiescent galaxies in overdense environments at z>3, which gives an enhanced quiescent galaxy number density 2x10^(-4)cMpc^(-3) that is three times above the field level at log(M*/Msun) > 10. Notably, these quiescent members form a tight red sequence on the color-magnitude diagram, making it one of the earliest red sequences known to date. Third, by constructing the SMFs for both star-forming and quiescent members, we find that both SMFs are top-heavy, with a significantly enhanced quiescent fraction at log(M*/Msun)>10.5 compared to field counterparts. The stellar mass-size analysis reveals that star-forming members are more compact at higher masses than their field counterparts. Finally, we estimate a halo mass of log(Mh/Msun)=13.2+-0.3 for the protocluster core, and log(Mh/Msun)=11.9-12.4 for satellite subgroups. The phase-space analysis indicates that three subgroups are likely infalling to the core. This work reveals a high abundance of massive galaxies and dark matter halos in a forming cluster, demonstrating the accelerated assembly of massive galaxies in massive halos when the Universe was less than 2 billion years old.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a stack of data from the second season of the CO Mapping Array Project (COMAP) Pathfinder on the positions of quasars from eBOSS and DESI. COMAP is a Line Intensity Mapping (LIM) experiment targeting dense molecular gas via CO(1--0) emission at $z\sim3$. COMAP's Season 2 represents a $3\times$ increase in map-level sensitivity over the previous Early Science data release. We do not detect any CO emission in the stack, instead finding an upper limit of $10.0\times 10^{10}\ \mathrm{K\ km\ s^{-1}\ pc^2}$ at 95\% confidence within an $\sim 18\ \mathrm{cMpc}$ box. We compare this upper limit to models of the CO emission stacked on quasars and find a tentative ($\sim 3 \sigma$) tension between the limit and the brightest stack models after accounting for a suite of additional sources of experimental attenuation and uncertainty, including quasar velocity uncertainty, pipeline signal loss, cosmic variance, and interloper emission in the LIM data. The COMAP-eBOSS/DESI stack is primarily a measurement of the CO luminosity in the quasars' wider environment and is therefore potentially subject to environmental effects such as feedback. With our current simple models of the galaxy-halo connection, we are thus unable to confidently rule out any models of cosmic CO with the stack alone. Conversely, the stack's sensitivity to these large-scale environmental effects has the potential to make it a powerful tool for galaxy formation science, once we are able to constrain the average CO luminosity via the auto power spectrum (a key goal of COMAP).
#### Cosmic magnification on multi-catalogue Herschel submillimetre galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 {Submillimetre galaxies (SMGs) are excellent background sources for magnification-bias studies, but the limited sky coverage in the submillimetre (sub-mm) band constrains their statistical power. Beyond H-ATLAS, Herschel produced additional sub-mm catalogues, though not optimised for spatial statistical lensing analyses.} {Our goal is to refine cosmological constraints from SMG magnification bias by exploiting the full sub-mm sky surveyed by Herschel.} {We expanded the SMG sample by incorporating other Herschel catalogues overlapping SDSS spectroscopic lenses. Random catalogues were generated via kernel density estimation to compute cross-correlations, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods were applied to infer astrophysical and cosmological parameters for each catalogue and for the combined dataset.} {We report the first detection of magnification bias in SMGs beyond H-ATLAS, reinforcing the robustness of this observable. Individual Herschel catalogues yield reasonable central values for $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$, although with large uncertainties. The combined analysis, dominated by the more powerful H-ATLAS sample, gives results consistent with $\Lambda$CDM: $\Omega_m = 0.30^{+0.05}_{-0.07}$, $\sigma_8 = 0.80 (+/- 0.07)$, and $h < 0.80$, in better agreement with \textit{Planck} 2018 than previous non-tomographic studies.} {SMGs are promising tracers for magnification bias, but the narrow sub-mm coverage remains a major limitation. Wider surveys optimised for lensing would enable cross-correlations on larger scales, yielding tighter cosmological constraints.}
