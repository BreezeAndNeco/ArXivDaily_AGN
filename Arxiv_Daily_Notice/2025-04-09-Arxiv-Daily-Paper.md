 - **Abstract**
 The Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope is discovering hundreds of new pulsars, including a slowly spinning compact binary millisecond pulsar (spin period $P_{\rm spin}=14.2$ ms) which showed radio eclipses and evidence of ablation of its companion: PSR J1932+2121. Its orbital period is $P_{\rm orb}=0.08$ d and the minimum companion mass is estimated as 0.12 $M_{\odot}$. Hence, this pulsar is classified as part of the Galactic-field spider (redback) population. However, it spins almost an order of magnitude slower than other Galactic-field spiders. Using detailed evolutionary calculations with MESA, we model the formation, mass-transfer and radio-pulsar phases, in order to explain the observed properties of PSR J1932+2121. We find that PSR J1932+2121 is a redback that has experienced an inefficient mass-transfer phase resulting in a lower accretion efficiency (in the range of 0.3 to 0.5) and subsequently slower spin compared to other spiders. We narrow down the initial range of $P_{\rm orb}$ that best reproduces its properties, to 2.0 to 2.6\,d. Current models of accretion-induced magnetic field decay are not able to explain its unusually high surface magnetic field of $2\times 10^{9}$ G. Hence, PSR J1932+2121 provides a unique opportunity to study inefficient accretion-induced spin up and surface magnetic field decay of pulsars.

 - **Abstract**
 Spicules are elongated, jet-like structures that populate the solar chromosphere and are rooted in the photosphere. In recent years, high-resolution observations and advanced numerical simulations have provided insights into their properties, structures, and dynamics. However, the formation mechanism of spicules, particularly the more dynamic type II spicules, which are primarily found in the quiet Sun and coronal holes, remains elusive. This study explores whether quiet Sun Ellerman bombs (QSEBs), which are ubiquitous small-scale magnetic reconnection events in the lower atmosphere, are linked to the formation of type II spicules. We analysed a high-quality 40-minute time sequence acquired with the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope. H-beta data were used to observe QSEBs and spicules, while spectropolarimetric measurements in the photospheric Fe i 6173 A line provided line-of-sight magnetic field information. We employed k-means clustering to automatically detect QSEBs and explored their potential association with spicules. We identified 80 clear cases where spicules occurred soon after the QSEB and not later than 30 s after the ending of the QSEBs. All events involved type II spicules, rapidly fading from the images. The footpoints of the spicules seemed to be rooted in QSEBs, where the onset of QSEBs often preceded the formation of the associated spicules. Additionally, we found around 500 other events that hinted at a connection but with some ambiguities. The combined clear and ambiguous cases constitute 34% of the total detected QSEBs and a smaller percentage of the spicules in our dataset. Our findings suggest that a fraction of type II spicules originate from QSEBs, supporting magnetic reconnection as a potential driving mechanism. In this context, QSEBs and spicules represent the conversion of magnetic energy into thermal and kinetic energy, respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar rotation and magnetic activity have a complex evolution that reveals multiple regimes. One of the related transitions that is seen in the rotation distribution for main-sequence (MS) solar-like stars has been attributed to core-envelope coupling and the consequent angular-momentum transfer between a fast core and a slow envelope. This feature is known as spin-down stalling and is related to the intermediate-rotation gap seen in field stars. Beyond this rotation signature, we search for evidence of it in stellar magnetic activity. We investigated the magnetic activity of the 1 Gyr old NGC 6811, a Kepler-field cluster, and Kepler MS stars of different ages. The magnetic activity was measured through the photometric magnetic activity proxy, Sph. To characterize the evolution of the magnetic activity for the Kepler sample, we split it according to the relative rotation and computed the respective activity sequences. We found the signature of core-envelope coupling in the magnetic activity of NGC 6811 and in the Kepler MS sample. In NGC 6811, we found enhanced magnetic activity for a range of effective temperatures that remained for significant timescales. In the Kepler sample, the magnetic activity sequences pile up in two distinct regions: at high activity levels that coincide with stars near the stalling mentioned above, where a behavior inversion is observed (slowly rotating stars have higher activity levels than fast-rotating stars, which is opposite to the overall behavior); and at low activity levels corresponding to slow rotators close to the detection limit, potentially facing a weakening of the magnetic braking. These results support the recent proposition that the strong shear experienced by stars during the core-envelope coupling phase can cause enhanced activity. This study helps us to shed light on the interplay between rotation, magnetic activity, and their evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the environmental impact of cluster regions on the evolution of nearby S0 galaxies, focusing on their distinct quiescent and star-forming (SF) subpopulations. We select a sample of clusters by crossmatching optical and X-ray data and extract a subset of 14 systems with maximally relaxed cores by applying strict virialization and substructure tests. A projected phase space (PPS) diagram is generated from the stack of relaxed clusters up to 3 virial radii to assess the locations of quiescent and SF S0s and their cluster infall histories. Additionally, we compare the radial line-of-sight velocity dispersion (VDLOS) and specific star-formation rate (SSFR) profiles for the different S0 subpopulations, using other Hubble types as benchmarks. Our study shows that quiescent S0s, the dominant class in the entire cluster region, concentrate preferentially at low radii in the PPS diagram, while SF S0s are more abundant in the outskirts. Despite this segregation, both subpopulations show similar VDLOS profiles in the cluster core -indicating an advanced stage of dynamical relaxation-, but that resemble those of late-type galaxies beyond the virial radius. This finding, combined with the distinct PPS distributions of both S0 subpopulations, which lead to mean infall times $\sim 1$ Gyr longer for quiescent S0s but that are shorter than those expected for ancient infallers, suggests that a substantial fraction of S0s present in the core region arrive via secondary infall. We also find evidence in the SSFR profiles that star formation in S0s begins to decline beyond the virialized core, likely due to preprocessing in infalling groups. Our results support a delayed-then-rapid quenching scenario for SF S0s in cluster regions, where their centrally concentrated star formation persists for an extended period before abruptly ending ($\lesssim 0.1$ Gyr) after their first pericenter passage.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyzed the incidence and properties of RR Lyrae stars that show evidence for amplitude and phase modulation (the so-called Blazhko Effect) in a sample of $\sim$3,000 stars with LINEAR and ZTF light curve data collected during the periods of 2002-2008 and 2018-2023, respectively. A preliminary subsample of about $\sim$500 stars was algorithmically pre-selected using various data quality and light curve statistics, and then 228 stars were confirmed visually as displaying the Blazhko effect. This sample increases the number of field RR Lyrae stars displaying the Blazhko effect by more than 50\% and places a lower limit of (11.4$\pm$0.8)\% for their incidence rate. We find that ab type RR Lyrae that show the Blazhko effect have about 5\% (0.030 day) shorter periods than starting sample, a 7.1$\sigma$ statistically significant difference. We find no significant differences in their light curve amplitudes and apparent magnitude (essentially, signal-to-noise ratio) distributions. No period or other differences are found for c type RR Lyrae. We find convincing examples of stars where the Blazhko effect can appear and disappear on time scales of several years. With time-resolved photometry expected from LSST, a similar analysis will be performed for even larger samples of field RR Lyrae stars in the southern sky and we anticipate a higher fraction of discovered Blazhko stars due to better sampling and superior photometric quality.

 - **Abstract**
 The evolution of young stars and planet-forming environments is intrinsically linked to their nascent surroundings. This is particularly evident for FU Orionis (FUor) objects$-$a class of young protostars known for dramatic outbursts resulting in significant increases in brightness. We present a case study of V960 Mon, an FUor that has recently been found to show signs of a fragmenting spiral arm, potentially connected to planet formation. Our study explores the large-scale environment ($10^3-10^4$ au) and incorporates ALMA band 3, band 4 and band 6 continuum data, molecular emissions from $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, C$^{18}$O, SiO, DCO$^+$, N$_2$D$^+$ and DCN, alongside optical and near-infrared observations from VLT/MUSE and VLT/SPHERE. We map a region of 20" across where we find tantalizing emissions that provide a unique view of a young group of protostars, including the discovery of a class-0 protostar to the east of the FUor. The $^{12}$CO and SiO tracers suggest that this object is at the base of an outflow, potentially impacting the surrounding medium. The MUSE and SPHERE observations indicate the presence of an elongated feature towards a prominent source to the southeast that may represent interaction between V960 Mon and its surrounding. Moreover, the C$^{18}$O emission overlaps with the clumps of the detected fragmenting spiral arm. These findings provide the strongest evidence to date for a connection between infalling material, fragmentation, and the intensity outburst of a protostar. Our case study highlights the complex interactions between young stars and their surroundings that drive the evolution of the planet forming environment.

 - **Abstract**
 Specifically selected to leverage the unique ultraviolet capabilities of the Hubble Space Telescope, the Hubble Ultraviolet Legacy Library of Young Stars as Essential Standards (ULLYSES) is a Director's Discretionary program of approximately 1000 orbits - the largest ever executed - that produced a UV spectroscopic library of O and B stars in nearby low metallicity galaxies and accreting low mass stars in the Milky Way. Observations from ULLYSES combined with archival spectra uniformly sample the fundamental astrophysical parameter space for each mass regime, including spectral type, luminosity class, and metallicity for massive stars, and the mass, age, and disk accretion rate for low-mass stars. The ULLYSES spectral library of massive stars will be critical to characterize how massive stars evolve at different metallicities; to advance our understanding of the production of ionizing photons, and thus of galaxy evolution and the re-ionization of the Universe; and to provide the templates necessary for the synthesis of integrated stellar populations. The massive star spectra are also transforming our understanding of the interstellar and circumgalactic media of low metallicity galaxies. On the low-mass end, UV spectra of T Tauri stars contain a plethora of diagnostics of accretion, winds, and the warm disk surface. These diagnostics are crucial for evaluating disk evolution and provide important input to assess atmospheric escape of planets and to interpret powerful probes of disk chemistry, as observed with ALMA and JWST. In this paper we motivate the design of the program, describe the observing strategy and target selection, and present initial results.

 - **Abstract**
 In low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), accretion flows are often associated with either jet outflows or disk winds. Studies of LMXBs with luminosities up to roughly 20% of the Eddington limit indicate that these outflows generally do not co-occur, suggesting that disk winds might inhibit jets. However, previous observations of LMXBs accreting near or above the Eddington limit show that jets and winds can potentially coexist. To investigate this phenomenon, we carried out a comprehensive multi-wavelength campaign (using VLA, Chandra/HETG, and NICER) on the near-Eddington neutron-star Z source LMXB GX 13+1. NICER and Chandra/HETG observations tracked GX 13+1 across the entire Z-track during high Eddington rates, detecting substantial resonance absorption features originating from the accretion disk wind in all X-ray spectra, which implies a persistent wind presence. Simultaneous VLA observations captured a variable radio jet, with radio emission notably strong during all flaring branch observations-contrary to typical behavior in Z-sources-and weaker when the source was on the normal branch. Interestingly, no clear correlation was found between the radio emission and the wind features. Analysis of VLA radio light curves and simultaneous Chandra/HETG spectra demonstrates that an ionized disk wind and jet outflow can indeed coexist in GX 13+1, suggesting that their launching mechanisms are not necessarily linked in this system.

 - **Abstract**
 Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of M87* provide a means of constraining parameters of both the black hole and its surrounding plasma. However, intrinsic variability of the emitting material introduces a major source of systematic uncertainty, complicating parameter inference. The precise origin and structure of this variability remain uncertain, and previous studies have largely relied on general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations to estimate its effects. Here, we fit a semi-analytic, dual-cone model of the emitting plasma to multiple years of EHT observations to empirically assess the impact of intrinsic variability and improved array coverage on key measurements including the black hole mass-to-distance ratio, spin, and viewing inclination. Despite substantial differences in the images of the two epochs, we find that the inferred mass-to-distance ratio remains stable and mutually consistent. The black hole spin is unconstrained for both observations, despite the improved baseline coverage in 2018. The inferred position angle and inclination of the black hole spin axis are discrepant between the two years, suggesting that variability and model misspecification contribute significantly to the total error budget for these quantities. Our findings highlight both the promise and challenges of multi-epoch EHT observations: while they can refine parameter constraints, they also reveal the limitations of simple parametric models in capturing the full complexity of the source. Our analysis -- the first to fit semi-analytic emission models to 2018 EHT observations -- underscores the importance of systematic uncertainty quantification from intrinsic variability in future high-resolution imaging studies of black hole environments and the role of repeated observations in quantifying these uncertainties.
#### A targeted search for Planet Nine in the CNEOS14 field

 - **Abstract**
 The hypothesized Planet Nine is thought to reside in the distant outer solar system, potentially explaining various anomalies in the orbits of extreme trans-Neptunian objects (ETNOs). In this work, we present a targeted observational search for Planet Nine, motivated by a possible gravitational interaction with the interstellar meteoroid responsible for the CNEOS14 bolide. Our observations span two campaigns over 2022 and 2023, covering a 98-square-degree region where Planet Nine's position is most likely if the messenger hypothesis holds. Our data and search methodology, based on the detection of parallax position shifts between consecutive nights, provide 85% confidence exclusion limits for objects with Sloan r-band magnitudes brighter than between 21.0 and 21.4, with an average sensitivity limit of 21.3. No credible Planet Nine candidates were identified within this field and magnitude limits. A caveat to our approach is that it would miss a candidate if its position were affected by scattered light from bright stars in at least one of the nights. However, we estimate that the probability for this is very low, around 0.4%. We discuss several possible reasons for our Planet Nine non-detection. Our study complements prior searches, particularly those using archival survey data that are limited in the Galactic plane or at fainter brightness limits. While our consecutive-night observation approach offers high sensitivity to minimal motion, extending the search for Planet Nine to fainter magnitudes (which may be crucial, according to recent predictions), will require higher sensitivity instrumentation.

 - **Abstract**
 Broad emission line regions (BLRs) lying into central accretion disks has been widely accepted to explain the unique double-peaked broad emission lines in Active Galactic Nuclei (double-peaked BLAGNs). Here, accepted the accretion disk origin, periodic variations of central wavelength $\lambda_{0}$ (the first moment) and line width $\sigma$ (the second moment) of double-peaked broad emission lines are theoretically simulated and determined. Furthermore, through theoretically simulated periodicities of $T_{\lambda0}$ and $T_{\sigma}$ for variations of $\lambda_0$ and $\sigma$, periodicity ratio $R_{fs}$ of $T_{\lambda0}$ to $T_{\sigma}$ to be around 2 can be applied to support the spiral arms to be more preferred in BLRs lying into central accretion disks. Then, periodic variations of $\lambda_0$ and $\sigma$ are determined and shown in the known double-peaked BLAGN NGC1097, leading to the parameter $R_{fs}\sim2$, which can be applied as clues to support that the structure of spiral arms in disk-like BLRs in central accretion disk should be the most compelling interpretation to the variability of double-peaked broad H$\alpha$ in NGC1097. The results provide clean criteria to test accretion disk origins of double-peaked broad emission lines in AGN.

 - **Abstract**
 Red Giant Branch (RGB) stars are overwhelmingly observed to rotate very slowly compared to main-sequence stars, but a few percent of them show rapid rotation and high activity, often as a result of tidal synchronizationn or other angular momentum transfer events. In this paper we build upon previous work using a sample of 7,286 RGB stars from APOGEE DR17 with measurable rotation. We derive an updated NUV excess vs $v \sin{i}$ rotation-activity relation that is consistent with our previous published version, but reduces uncertainty through the inclusion of a linear [M/H] correction term. We find that both single stars and binary stars generally follow our rotation-activity relation, but single stars seemingly saturate at $P_{\text{rot}}$/$\sin{i}$ $\sim$10 days while binary stars show no sign of saturation, suggesting they are able to carry substantially stronger magnetic fields. Our analysis reveals Sub-subgiant stars (SSGs) to be the most active giant binaries, with rotation synchronized to orbits with periods $\lesssim$ 20 days. Given their unusually high level of activity compared to other short-period synchronized giants we suspect the SSGs are most commonly overactive RS CVn stars. Using estimates of critical rotation we identify a handful giants rotating near break-up and determine tidal spin up to this level of rotation is highly unlikely and instead suggest planetary engulfment or stellar mergers in a fashion generally proposed for FK Comae stars.
#### A universal natal spin in stellar-mass black holes

 - **Abstract**
 A stellar mass black hole (BH) is believed to be formed as the result of the core collapse of a massive star at the end of its evolution. For a class of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), it is widely believed that their centre engines are just these stellar-mass BHs, which accrete the collapsing matter in hyper-accretion mode. In such systems, a popular scenario is that the magnetic field supported in the accretion disk extracts the rotational energy of the spinning BH and launch a jet on one hand, and the accretion of the infalling matter of the collapse will increase the BH's rotational energy on the other hand. However, the detailed physical processes of the above scenario are still not well understood. Here we report that when the accretion process is dominated by a Magnetically-Arrested-Disk (MAD), the above mentioned two competing processes link to each other, so that the spin evolution of the BH can be written in a simple form. Most interestingly, when the total accreted mass is enough, the BH spin will always reach to an equilibrium value peaked at $\chi\sim0.88$. This value does not depend on the initial mass and spin of the BH, as well as the history of accretion. This model predicts that there is a population of stellar-mass BH which possess a universal spin at the end of the collapsing accretion. We test this prediction against the 3rd gravitational wave (GW) catalogue (GWTC-3) and found that the distribution of the spin of the secondary BH is centred narrowly around $0.85\pm 0.05$ as predicted. Applying this model to the parameters of observed parameters in GWTC-3 and further GW catalogues, it is possible to infer the initial mass and spin distributions of the binary BHs detected with GW.
#### A Redshift Survey of the Coma Cluster (A1656): Understanding the Nature of Subhalos in the Weak-lensing Map

 - **Abstract**
 We study the physical properties of weak-lensing subhalos in the Coma cluster of galaxies using data from galaxy redshift surveys. The data include 12989 galaxies with measured spectroscopic redshifts (2184 from our MMT/Hectospec observation and 10807 from the literature). The $r$-band magnitude limit at which the differential spectroscopic completeness drops below 50% is 20.2 mag, which is spatially uniform in a region of 4.5 deg$^{2}$ where the weak-lensing map of Okabe et al. (2014) exists. We identify 1337 member galaxies in this field and use them to understand the nature of 32 subhalos detected in the weak-lensing analysis. We use Gaussian Mixture Modeling (GMM) in the line-of-sight velocity domain to measure the mean velocity, the velocity dispersion, and the number of subhalo galaxies by mitigating the contamination from the interloping galaxies. Using subhalo properties calculated with GMM, we find no significant difference in the redshift space distribution between the cluster member galaxies and subhalos. We find that the weak-lensing mass shows strong correlations with the number of subhalo member galaxies, velocity dispersion, and dynamical mass of subhalos with power-law slopes of $0.54^{+0.16}_{-0.15}$, $0.93^{+0.35}_{-0.32}$, and $0.50^{+0.31}_{-0.18}$, respectively. The slope of the mass--velocity dispersion relation of the weak-lensing subhalos appears shallower than that of the galaxy clusters, galaxy groups, and individual galaxies. These results suggest that the combination of redshift surveys with weak-lensing maps can be a powerful tool for better understanding the nature of subhalos in clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 Investigating the processes by which galaxies rapidly build up their stellar mass during the peak of their star formation ($z=2$--$3$) is crucial to advancing our understanding of the assembly of large-scale structures. We report the discovery of one of the most gas- and dust-rich protocluster core candidates, PJ0846+15 (J0846), from the Planck All-Sky Survey to Analyze Gravitationally lensed Extreme Starbursts (PASSAGES) sample. The exceedingly high total apparent star formation rate of up to ($\mu$SFR) $\sim 93600\,\mathrm{M}_\odot\,\text{yr}^{-1}$ is a result of a foreground cluster lens magnifying at least 11 dusty star-forming galaxies between $z=2.660$--$2.669$. Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observations revealed 18 CO(3--2) emission-line detections, some of which are multiply-imaged systems, lensed by a foreground cluster at $z=0.77$. We present the first multi-wavelength characterization of this field, constructing a lens model that predicts that these 11 systems (magnification factor, $\mu\simeq1.5$--$25$) are contained within a projected physical extent of $280\times150$ kpc, with a velocity dispersion of $\sigma_{v}=246\pm72$ km s$^{-1}$ and a total intrinsic star formation rate of up to (SFR) $\sim10400\,\mathrm{M}_\odot\,\text{yr}^{-1}$. J0846 is one of the most unique, lensed, protocluster core candidates ever reported, and offers a magnified glimpse into the rapid buildup of massive local galaxy clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of the neutrino magnetic moment (NMM,$\mu_v$) is one of the most significant challenges in physics. The additional energy loss due to NMM can significantly influence the He flash evolution in low-mass stars. Using the MESA code, we investigated the impact of NMM on the He flash evolution in low-mass stars. We found that NMM leads to an increase in both the critical He core mass required for the He flash and the luminosity of TRGB. For a typical $Z = 1 Z_{\odot}$ , $M$ = 1.0 $M_{\odot}$, and $\mu_v = 3 \times 10^{-12} \mu_{\mathrm{B}}$ model, the He core mass increases by $\sim 5\%$, and the TRGB luminosity increases by $\sim 35\%$ compared to the model without NMM. However, contrary to previous conclusions, our model indicates that the He flash occurs earlier, rather than delayed, with increasing NMM values. This is because the additional energy loss from NMM accelerates the contraction of the He core, releases more gravitational energy that heats the H shell and increases the hydrogen burning rate, thereby causing the He core to reach the critical mass faster and advancing the He flash. An increase in NMM results in a higher peak luminosity for the first He flash, a more off-center ignition position, and sub-flashes with higher luminosities, shorter intervals, and higher frequency. We found that the internal gravity wave (IGW) mixing generated by the He flash can induce sufficient mixing in the radiative zone, turning the overshoot region into a low-Dmix bottleneck within the stellar interior. The increase in NMM in the model narrows the overshoot bottleneck region, enabling Li to enter the surface convection zone more quickly, thereby enhancing the enrichment effect of IGW mixing on surface Li. For models incorporating both NMM and IGW mixing, the reduction in the overshoot bottleneck region allows them to effectively produce super Li-rich red clump star samples.

 - **Abstract**
 We carry out an unprecedented high-resolution simulation for the solar convection zone. Our calculation reproduces the fast equator and near-surface shear layer (NSSL) of differential rotation and the near-surface poleward meridional flow simultaneously. The NSSL is located in a complex layer where the spatial and time scales of thermal convection are significantly small compared with the deep convection zone. While there have been several attempts to reproduce the NSSL in numerical simulation, the results are still far from reality. In this study, we succeed in reproducing an NSSL in our new calculation. Our analyses lead to a deeper understanding of the construction mechanism of the NSSL, which is summarized as: 1) rotationally unconstrained convection in the near-surface layer transports the angular momentum radially inward; 2) sheared poleward meridional flow around the top boundary is constructed; 3) the shear causes a positive kinetic $\langle v'_r v'_\theta\rangle$ and negative magnetic $\langle B_r B_\theta\rangle$ correlations; and 4) the turbulent viscosity and magnetic tension are latitudinally balanced with the Coriolis force in the NSSL. We emphasize the importance of the magnetic field in the solar convection zone.

 - **Abstract**
 The interplay between radiative diffusion, rotation, convection, and magnetism in metallic-line chemically peculiar stars is still not fully understood. Recently, evidence has emerged that these effects can work together. Our goal is to study the bright binary system 50 Dra, describe its orbit and components, and study additional variability. We conducted our analysis using TESS short-cadence data and new high-resolution spectroscopic observations. We disentangled the spectra using Korel and performed spectral synthesis with Atlas9 and Synthe codes. The system was modelled using Korel and Phoebe2.4. We also employed SED fitting in Ariadne and isochrone fitting using Param1.5 codes. Our findings indicate that the non-eclipsing system (with an inclination of 49.9(8) deg) 50 Dra, displaying ellipsoidal brightness variations, consists of two nearly equal A-type stars with masses of $M_{1}=2.08(8)$ and $M_{2}=1.97(8)$ M$_{\odot}$ and temperatures of 9800(100) and 9200(200) K, respectively. Our analysis also suggests that the system, with an orbital period of $P_{\rm orb}=4.117719(2)$ days, is tidally relaxed with a circular orbit and synchronous rotation of the components. Furthermore, we discovered that both stars are metallic-line Am chemically peculiar stars with an underabundance of Sc and an overabundance of iron-peak and rare-earth elements. We identified additional variations with slightly higher frequency than the rotational frequency of the components that we interpret as prograde g-mode pulsations. The system 50 Dra exhibits numerous exciting phenomena that co-exist together and may have an impact on our understanding of chemical peculiarity and pulsations.

 - **Abstract**
 One of hot topics in the solar physics are the so-called 'stealth' coronal mass ejections (CME), which are not associated with any appreciable energy release events in the lower corona, such as the solar flares. It is sometimes assumed that these phenomena might be produced by some specific physical mechanism, but no particular suggestions were put forward. It is the aim of the present paper to show that a promising explanation of the stealth CMEs can be based on the so-called 'topological' ignition of the magnetic reconnection. As a theoretical basis, we employ the Gorbachev-Kel'ner-Somov-Shvarts (GKSS) model of formation of the magnetic null point, which is produced by a specific superposition of the remote sources (sunspots) rather than by the local current systems. As follows from our numerical simulations, the topological model explains very well all basic features of the stealth CMEs: (i) the plasma eruption develops without an appreciable heat release from the spot of reconnection, i.e., without the solar flare; (ii) the spot of reconnection (magnetic null point) can be formed far away from the location of the magnetic field sources; (iii) the trajectories of eruption are strongly curved, which can explain observability of CMEs generated behind the solar limb. Therefore, the topological ignition of magnetic reconnection should be interesting both by itself, as a novel physical phenomenon, and as a prognostic tool for forecasting the stealth CMEs and the resulting unexpected geomagnetic storms.

 - **Abstract**
 It is well-known that the global acoustic oscillations of the Sun's atmosphere can excite resonance modes within large-scale magnetic concentrations. These structures are conduits of energy between the different layers of the solar atmosphere, and understanding their dynamics can explain the processes behind coronal heating and solar wind acceleration. In this work, we studied the Doppler velocity spectrum of more than a thousand large-scale magnetic structures (i.e., sunspots) in the solar photosphere that crossed near the disk centre of the Sun. We exploited the excellent stability and seeing-free conditions of the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) instrument onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) to cover nearly seven years of observations, providing the most comprehensive statistical analysis of its kind. Here, we show that the power spectra of the umbra of sunspots in the photosphere is remarkably different from the one of quiet-Sun regions, with both exhibiting a primary peak at 3.3 mHz, but the sunspot umbrae also displaying a closely packed series of secondary peaks in the $4-6$~mHz band. Understanding the origin of such peaks is a challenging task. Here, we explore several possible explanations for the observed oscillations, all pointing toward a potential resonant interaction within these structures and an unknown driver. Our observational result provides further insight into the magnetic connectivity between the different layers of the dynamic atmosphere of the Sun.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the analysis of Ly$\alpha$ haloes around faint quasars at $z\sim4$ and $z\sim6$. We use 20 and 162 quasars at $z\sim4$ and $z\sim6$, taken by slit spectroscopy, and detect Ly$\alpha$ haloes around 12 and 26 of these quasars, respectively. The average absolute magnitudes of the detected quasars are $\langle M_{1450} \rangle = -23.84$ mag at $z\sim4$ and $\langle M_{1450} \rangle = -23.68$ mag at $z\sim6$, which are comparable at $z\sim4$ and 3 mag fainter at $z\sim6$ than those of previous studies. The median surface brightness profiles are found to be consistent with an exponential curve, showing a hint of flattening within a radius of 5 kpc. The Ly$\alpha$ haloes around these faint quasars are systematically fainter than those around bright quasars in the previous studies. We confirm the previous results that the Ly$\alpha$ halo luminosity depends on both the ionizing and Ly$\alpha$ peak luminosities of quasars at $z\sim4$, and also find that a similar correlation holds even at $z\sim6$. While the observed Ly$\alpha$ halo luminosity is overall attributed to recombination emission from the optically thin gas clouds in the CGM, its luminosity dependences can be consistently explained by the partial contributions of recombination radiation from the optically thick clouds, which is thought to originate from the CGM centre, and the scattered Ly$\alpha$ photons, which is resonantly trapped at the CGM centre and escaping outside of the haloes.

 - **Abstract**
 Starobinsky inflation and non-minimally coupled Higgs inflation have been among the most favored models of the early universe, as their predictions for the scalar spectral index $n_s$ and tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ fall comfortably within the constraints set by Planck and BICEP/Keck. However, new results from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) suggest a preference for higher values of $n_s$, introducing tension with the simplest realizations of these models. In this work, being agnostic about the nature of the inflaton, we show that incorporating one-loop corrections to a Higgs-like inflationary scenario leads to a shift in the predicted value of $n_s$, which brings Higgs-like inflation into better agreement with ACT observations. Remarkably, we find that this can be achieved with non-minimal couplings $\xi < 1$, in contrast to the large values typically required in conventional Higgs inflation, thereby pushing any unitarity-violation scale above the Planck scale. The effect is even more significant when the model is formulated in the Palatini approach, where the modified field-space structure naturally enhances deviations from the metric case. These findings highlight the importance of quantum corrections and gravitational degrees of freedom in refining inflationary predictions in light of new data.

 - **Abstract**
 Complex Organic Molecules (COMs) in the form of prebiotic molecules are potentially building blocks of life. Using Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band 7 observations in spectral scanning mode, we carried out a deep search for COMs within the disk of V883 Ori, covering frequency ranges of $\sim$ 348 - 366 GHz. V883 Ori is an FUor object currently undergoing an accretion burst, which increases its luminosity and consequently increases the temperature of the surrounding protoplanetary disk, facilitating the detection of COMs in the gas phase. We identified 26 molecules, including 14 COMs and 12 other molecules, with first detection in this source of the molecules: CH3OD, H2C17O, and H213CO. We searched for multiple nitrogen-bearing COMs, as CH3CN had been the only nitrogen-bearing COM that has been identified so far in this source. We also detected CH3CN, and tentatively detect CH3CH2CN, CH2CHCN, CH3OCN, CH3NCO, and NH2CHO. We compared the abundances relative to CH3OH with those in the handful of objects with previous detections of these species: the Class 0 protostars IRAS 16293-2422 A, IRAS 16293-2422 B and B1-c, the high-mass star-forming region Sagittarius B2 (North), the Solar System comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, and the protoplanetary disk of Oph-IRS 48. We report $\sim$ 1 to 3 orders of magnitude higher abundances compared to Class 0 protostars and $\sim$ 1 to 3 orders of magnitude lower abundances compared to the protoplanetary disk, Sagittarius B2 (North), and 67P/C-G. These results indicate that the protoplanetary disk phase could contribute to build up of COMs.

 We performed simultaneous V band photometry and spectroscopic observations of the recurrent nova T CrB and estimate the V band magnitude of the red giant. We find for the red giant of T CrB apparent and absolute V-band magnitudes m_V = 10.17 +/- 0.06 and M_V = +0.14 +/- 0.08, respectively. At the maximum of the ellipsoidal variation when these values are obtained, its absolute V-band magnitude is similar but fainter than the typical M4/5III giants.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigated the initiation and the evolution of an X7.1-class solar flare observed in solar active region NOAA 13842 on October 1, 2024, based on a data-constrained magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation. The nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF) extrapolated from the photospheric magnetic field about 1 hour before the flare was used as the initial condition for the MHD simulations. The NLFFF reproduces highly sheared field lines that undergo tether-cutting reconnection in the MHD simulation, leading to the formation of a highly twisted magnetic flux rope (MFR), which then erupts rapidly driven by both torus instability and magnetic reconnection. This paper focuses on the dynamics of the MFR and its role in eruptions. We find that magnetic reconnection in the pre-eruption phase is crucial in the subsequent eruption driven by the torus instability. Furthermore, our simulation indicates that magnetic reconnection also directly enhances the torus instability. These results suggest that magnetic reconnection is not just a byproduct of the eruption due to reconnecting of post-flare arcade, but also plays a significant role in accelerating the MFR during the eruption.

 - **Abstract**
 We present direct metric-decimetric radio imaging observations of a fascinating quiescent filament eruption on 2024 March 17 using data from the DAocheng Radio Telescope (DART), with a combination of the Solar Dynamics Observatory and the Chinese Ha Solar Explorer. At the radio band, even though the filament is difficult to identify in its early phase, it rapidly became distinct and formed a continuous loop-like dark structure during the eruption, i.e., so-called radio depression. Compared with the fragmentation of the erupting filament observed at the Ha and EUV bands, the radio depression appeared more coherently. Based on synthetic radio images from a three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulation of a flux-rope-filament eruption, it is suggested that the radio depression originates from the absorption of cold and dense materials within the erupting flux rope to the background emission. The absorption seems to be stronger than that at the Ha and EUV bands, thus leading to their apparent discrepancies. Moreover, the radio depression is also found to occupy the lower part but not the whole body of the flux rope.

 - **Abstract**
 Fossil magnetic fields of early-type stars are typically characterised by symmetric or slightly distorted oblique dipolar surface geometries. Contrary to this trend, the late-B magnetic chemically peculiar star HD 57372 exhibits an unusually large rotational variation of its mean magnetic field modulus, suggesting a highly atypical field configuration. In this study, we present a Zeeman Doppler imaging analysis of HD 57372, revealing an exceptionally asymmetric bipolar magnetic topology, rarely observed in early-type stars. According to our magnetic field maps, reconstructed from the intensity and circular polarisation profiles of Fe, Cr, and Ti lines, approximately 66 per cent of the stellar surface is covered by a diffuse outward-directed radial field, with local field strengths reaching 11.6 kG, while the remaining 34 per cent hosts a highly concentrated inward-directed field with a strong horizontal component and a peak strength of 17.8 kG. These unusual surface magnetic field characteristics make HD 57372 a notable object for testing fossil-field theories and interpreting phase-resolved spectropolarimetric observations of early-type stars.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyse the transport of cosmic rays (CR) in magnetic fields that are structured on scales greater than the CR Larmor radius. We solve the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck (VFP) equation for various mixes of mirroring and small-angle scattering and show that relatively small deviations from a uniform magnetic field can induce mirroring and inhibit CR transport to levels that mimic Bohm diffusion in which the CR mean free path is comparable with the CR Larmor radius. Our calculations suggest that shocks may accelerate CR to the Hillas (1984) energy without the need for magnetic field amplification on the Larmor scale. This re-opens the possibility, subject to more comprehensive simulations, that young supernova remnants may be accelerating CR to PeV energies, and maybe even to higher energies beyond the knee in the energy spectrum. We limit our discussion of CR acceleration to shocks that are non-relativistic.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a multi-wavelength study of an extended area hosting the bubble N59-North to explore the physical processes driving massive star formation (MSF). The Spitzer 8 $\mu$m image reveals an elongated/filamentary infrared-dark cloud (length $\sim$28 pc) associated with N59-North, which contains several protostars and seven ATLASGAL dust clumps at the same distance. The existence of this filament is confirmed through $^{13}$CO and NH$_3$ molecular line data in a velocity range of [95, 106] km s$^{-1}$. All dust clumps satisfy Kauffmann & Pillai's condition for MSF. Using Spitzer 8 $\mu$m image, a new embedded hub-filament system candidate (C-HFS) is investigated toward the ATLASGAL clump, located near the filament's central region. MeerKAT 1.3 GHz continuum emission, detected for the first time toward C-HFS, reveals an ultracompact HII region driven by a B2-type star, suggesting an early stage of HFS with minimal feedback from the young massive star. The comparison of the position-velocity (PV) and position-position-velocity (PPV) diagrams with existing theoretical models suggests that rotation, central collapse, and end-dominated collapse are not responsible for the observed gas motion in the filament. The PPV diagram indicates the expansion of N59-North by revealing blue- and red-shifted gas velocities at the edge of the bubble. Based on comparisons with magnetohydrodynamic simulations, this study suggests that cloud-cloud collision (CCC) led to the formation of the filament, likely giving it a conical structure with gas converging toward its central region, where C-HFS is located. Overall, the study supports multi-scale filamentary mass accretion for MSF, likely triggered by CCC.

 - **Abstract**
 Radio transients, such as pulsars and Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), are primarily detected at centimetre radio wavelengths, where higher luminosities are found. However, observations of sources in dense environments are heavily affected by propagation effects which may hinder a detection. Millimetre wave observations bypass this complication but require the largest radio telescopes to compensate for the lower flux densities. When used in phased mode, the ALMA radio telescope provides an equivalent dish size of 84m, being the most sensitive instrument at mm/sub mm. With its high time resolution it offers a unique opportunity to study radio transients in an unexplored window. We study the Galactic Centre (GC) magnetar, PSR J1745$-$2900, as a laboratory for magnetars in complex magneto-turbulent environments and to link with FRBs. We showcase the potential of ALMA in phased mode to observe radio transients and to achieve, for some sources, the first ever detections outside the cm wave range. We studied the GC magnetar using ALMA archival data of Sgr A* at Band 3 from the 2017 GMVA campaign. We searched in intensity and classified the pulses based on their circular and linear polarisation properties and arrival phase. We detected eight pulses with energies in the range of 10$^{29}$ erg. We constructed its cumulative energy distribution and we fit a power law, where the event rate scales with energy as $R \propto E^{\gamma}$. The result is an exponent of $\gamma = -2.4 \pm 0.1$. With the $\gamma -$value and the system properties of phased ALMA, we estimate that over 160 known pulsars could be detected by ALMA. For repeating FRBs, observing during their peak activity window could lead to several detections. We expect that ALMA's lower frequency bands with polarisation capabilities, will serve as a pioneer on mm wave searches for pulsars and to study complex environments involving radio transients.

 - **Abstract**
 Photodissociation Regions (PDRs) are key to understanding the feedback processes that shape interstellar matter in galaxies. One important type of PDR is the interface between HII regions and molecular clouds, where far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation from massive stars heats gas and dissociates molecules. Photochemical models predict that the C/CO transition occurs deeper in the PDR compared to the H/H2 transition in low-metallicity environments, increasing the extent of CO-dark H2 gas. This prediction has been difficult to test outside the Milky Way due to the lack of high spatial resolution observations tracing H2 and CO. This study examines a low-metallicity PDR in the N13 region of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) where we spatially resolve the ionization front, the H2 dissociation front, and the C/CO transition using 12CO J=2-1, 3-2 and [CI] (1-0) observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-mm Array (ALMA) and near-infrared spectroscopy of H2 vibrational lines from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Our analysis shows that the separation between the H/H2 and C/CO boundaries is approximately 0.043 +- 0.013(stat.) +- 0.0036(syst.) pc (equivalent to 0."146 +- 0."042 (stat.) +- 0."012 (syst.) at the SMC's distance of 62 kpc), defining the spatial extent of the CO-dark H2 region. Compared to our plane-parallel PDR models, we find that a constant pressure model matches the observed structure better than a constant density one. Overall, we find that the PDR model does well at predicting the extent of the CO-dark H2 layer in N13. This study represents the first resolved benchmark for low metallicity PDRs.
