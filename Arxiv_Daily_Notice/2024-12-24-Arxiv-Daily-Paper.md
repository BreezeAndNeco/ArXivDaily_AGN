 - **Abstract**
 Stellar flares are powerful bursts of electromagnetic radiation triggered by magnetic reconnection in the chromosphere of stars, occurring frequently and intensely on active M dwarfs. While missions like TESS and Kepler have studied regular and super-flares, their detection of flares with energies below $10^{30}$ erg remains incomplete. Extending flare studies to include these low-energy events could enhance flare formation models and provide insight into their impacts on exoplanetary atmospheres. This study investigates CHEOPS's capacity to detect low-energy flares in M dwarf light curves. Using CHEOPS's high photometric precision and observing cadence, along with a tailored wavelet-based denoising algorithm, we aim to improve detection completeness and refine flare statistics for low-energy events. We conducted a flare injection and recovery process to optimise denoising parameters, applied it to CHEOPS light curves to maximise detection rates, and used a flare breakdown algorithm to analyse complex structures. Our analysis recovered 349 flares with energies ranging from $2.2\times10^{26}$ to $8.1\times10^{30}$ erg across 63 M dwarfs, with $\sim$40% exhibiting complex, multi-peaked structures. The denoising algorithm improved flare recovery by $\sim$34%, though it marginally extended the lower boundary of detectable energies. For the full sample, the power-law index $\alpha$ was $1.92\pm0.07$, but a log-normal distribution fit better, suggesting multiple flare formation scenarios. While CHEOPS's observing mode is not ideal for large-scale surveys, it captures weaker flares than TESS or Kepler, expanding the observed energy range. Wavelet-based denoising enhances low-energy event recovery, enabling exploration of the micro-flaring regime. Expanding low-energy flare observations could refine flare generation models and improve the understanding of their role in star-planet interactions.
#### Observational Signatures of Disk Winds in Protoplanetary Disks: Differentiating Magnetized and Photoevaporative Outflows With Fully Coupled Thermochemistry

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetized winds and photoevaporative winds are critical in shaping protoplanetary disk evolution. Using 2D axisymmetric (magneto-)hydrodynamic simulations with Athena++ implementing fully coupled thermochemistry, we investigate the signatures of the two winds in CO and [C~I] ALMA observations, and examine the potential to distinguish the origins. Our simulations reveal fundamental differences between the two winds: magnetized winds are colder and denser, exhibiting super-Keplerian rotation with small poloidal velocities of $\lesssim 1~{\rm km~s}^{-1}$ in the atmosphere ($z/R\gtrsim0.45$), while photoevaporative winds are hotter and less dense, exhibiting sub-Keplerian rotation with higher poloidal velocity of several ${\rm km~s}^{-1}$. In addition to previously identified factors like thermal pressure gradient and disk's self-gravity, we demonstrate that magnetic tension/pressure and advection significantly influence rotational velocities of the gas in the wind, which lead to emission patterns that are distinct from Keplerian rotation in synthetic ALMA observations. Magnetized winds are visible in CO channel maps when wind loss rates are $\gtrsim10^{-8}~M_\odot~{\rm yr}^{-1}$. When wind loss rates are lower, magnetized winds produce subtle perturbations in channel maps, which resemble the so-called ``velocity kinks'' produced by protoplanets. While photoevaporative winds dissociate CO through strong XUV radiation and thus are weaker in CO, they can create observable ring-like substructures. [C~I] emission is optically thin and could be most effective at detecting both winds in disks with high gas mass and/or high [C~I] abundance. Due to the spatially extended nature of the winds, using a large beam ($\simeq0.4$" for disks in nearby star-forming regions) will be helpful regardless of the tracer used.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we study how absorption-line systems affect the spectra and redshifts of quasars (QSOs), using catalogs of Mg II absorbers from the early data release (EDR) and first data release (DR1) of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We determine the reddening effect of an absorption system by fitting an un-reddened template spectrum to a sample of 50,674 QSO spectra that contain Mg II absorbers. We find that reddening caused by intervening absorbers (voff > 3500 km/s) has an average color excess of E(B-V) = 0.04 magnitudes. We find that the E(B-V) tends to be greater for absorbers at low redshifts, or those having Mg II absorption lines with higher equivalent widths, but shows no clear trend with voff for intervening systems. However, the E(B-V) of associated absorbers, those at voff < 3500 km/s, shows a strong trend with voff , increasing rapidly with decreasing voff and peaking (approximately 0.15 magnitudes) around voff = 0 km/s. We demonstrate that Mg II absorbers impact redshift estimation for QSOs by investigating the distributions of voff for associated absorbers. We find that at z > 1.5 these distributions broaden and bifurcate in a nonphysical manner. In an effort to mitigate this effect, we mask pixels associated with the Mg II absorption lines and recalculate the QSO redshifts. We find that we can recover voff populations in better agreement with those for z < 1.5 absorbers and in doing so typically shift background QSO redshifts by delta_z approximately equal to plus or minus 0.005.
#### Optical QPOs with 550 day periodicity in the reverberation mapped broad line quasar PG 1411+442

 - **Abstract**
 In this manuscript, optical quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) with 550 day periodicity related to a candidate of sub-pc binary black hole (BBH) system are reported in the reverberation mapped broad line quasar PG 1411+442 but with different line profile of broad H$\alpha$ from that of broad H$\beta$ in its rms spectrum. First, considering sine function to describe the 18.8years-long light curves from the CSS, ASAS-SN and ZTF, 550days periodicity can be confirmed with confidence level higher than 5$\sigma$. Second, the stable 550days optical QPOs can be re-confirmed with confidence levels higher than 5$\sigma$ by the Generalized Lomb-Scargle periodogram, the sine-like phase-folded light curves and the WWZ technique determined power maps. Third, based on simulated light curves by CAR process, confidence level higher than $3.5\sigma$ can be confirmed for the optical QPOs not related to intrinsic AGN variability. Moreover, considering spatial separation of central two BH accreting systems smaller than expected sizes of broad emission line regions (BLRs), central total BH mass higher than $10^6{\rm M_\odot}$ could lead to few effects of supposed BBH systems on estimated virial BH masses. Meanwhile, disk precession is not preferred due to the similar estimated sizes of optical and NUV emission regions, and jet precession can be ruled out due to PG 1411+442 as a radio quiet quasar. The results strongly indicate it would be practicable by applying very different line profiles of broad Balmer emission lines to detect candidates of BBH systems in normal broad line AGN in the near future.

 - **Abstract**
 Binaries harboring a millisecond pulsar (MSP) and a black hole (BH) are a key observing target for current and upcoming pulsar surveys. We model the formation and evolution of such binaries in isolation at solar metallicity using the next-generation binary population synthesis code POSYDON. We examine neutron star (NS)-BH binaries where the NS forms first (labeled NSBH), as the NS must be able to spin-up to MSP rotation periods before the BH forms in these systems. We find that NSBHs are very rare and have a birth rate < 1 Myr$^{-1}$ for a Milky Way-like galaxy in our typical models. The NSBH birth rate is 2-3 orders of magnitude smaller than that for NS-BHs where the BH forms first (labeled BHNS). These rates are also sensitive to model assumptions about the supernova (SN) remnant masses, natal kicks, and common-envelope efficiency. We find that 100% of NSBHs undergo a mass ratio reversal before the first SN and up to 64% of NSBHs undergo a double common envelope phase after the mass ratio reversal occurs. Most importantly, no NSBH binaries in our populations undergo a mass transfer phase, either stable or unstable, after the first SN. This implies that there is no possibility of pulsar spin-up via accretion, and thus MSP-BH binaries cannot form. Thus, dynamical environments and processes may provide the only formation channels for such MSP-BH binaries.
#### Radio filaments as Z-pinched Galactic center wind

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15575

 - **Abstract**
 In this brief note, we tentatively investigate the possibility that the radio filaments are produced when the Galactic center wind washes over magnetic field structures. The electrons and ions, with their disparate charge-to-mass ratios, are deflected differently by the magnetic field, and a current results. The current is subsequently Z-pinched into filaments, creating an electron-accelerating electric field along the way, because the magnetic field necessarily rearranges during the dynamic constriction process. An axial magnetic field also arises, possibly via the diocotron channel, to eventually quench the pinching and stabilize the filaments against a variety of instabilities.

 - **Abstract**
 Most previous efforts for hydrodynamic studies on detonation in the context of Type Ia supernovae did not take into account the scale of the cellular structure for a criterion in initiation, propagation, quenching, and the resolution requirement of detonation, whereas it is quite common to consider cell sizes in the discussion on terrestrial detonation in chemically reactive systems. In our recent study, the terrestrial cell-based theories, which incorporates the cell-size data acquired in 2D simulations of helium detonation in the double-detonation model, were demonstrated to be a powerful diagnostics in reproducing the thresholds in the initiation and quenching provided by previous studies. In the present study, 2D simulation results of the cellular detonation in the base of white-dwarf (WD) envelope are described in detail, in terms of the dynamic wave morphology and chemical abundance structure. The cellular structure is observed at a range of upstream density and envelope composition explored in the present work. C/O contamination by the WD core material reduces the cell width rapidly, as accelerated by the {\alpha}-capture reaction. It is also indicated that nickel production could be significantly delayed for the C/O-rich composition. The small cell width makes it extremely demanding to resolve the detonation structure in full-star simulations of SNe Ia; this could raise a concern on the robustness of the outcomes of some numerical simulations in terms of the success and failure of detonation. This issue may be overcome by sub-grid modeling that incorporates the cellular dynamics acquired in resolved simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 We have studied the accreting black hole binary GX 339-4 using two highly accurate broad-band X-ray data sets in very soft spectral states from simultaneous NICER and NuSTAR observations. Simultaneous fitting of both data sets with relativistic models of the disk, its Comptonization and reflection allows us to relatively accurately determine the black-hole mass and spin, and the distance and inclination. However, we find the measured values strongly depend on the used disk model. With the widely used thin-disk Kerr models kerrbb and kerrbb2 (which employ color corrections), we find relatively low masses and strongly negative spins. Then, the models utilizing detailed disk atmospheric spectra, bhspec and slimbh, predict moderately positive spins and high masses. When adding a warm corona above the disk (as proposed before for both AGNs and accreting binaries), we find the spin is weakly constrained, but consistent with zero. In all cases, the fitted inclination is low, $\approx$30-$34^\circ$. For the spin aligned with the binary orbit, the mass function for this binary implies large values of the mass, consistent only with those obtained with either slimbh or warm corona. We also test the disk models for an assumed set of mass, distance and inclination. We find that, e.g., kerrbb yields values of the spin parameter lower than bhspec or slimbh by $\sim$0.2-0.3. Our results confirm previously found strong disk-model dependencies of the measured black-hole spin, now for a low-mass X-ray binary.

 - **Abstract**
 A gravitational wave (GW) passing through an astrometric observer causes periodic shifts of the apparent star positions measured by the observer. For a GW of sufficient amplitude and duration, and of suitable frequency, these shifts might be detected with a Gaia-like astrometric telescope. This paper aims to analyse in detail the effects of GWs on an astrometric solution based on Gaia-like observations, which are one-dimensional, strictly differential between two widely separated fields of view and following a prescribed scanning law. We present a simple geometric model for the astrometric effects of a plane GW in terms of the time-dependent positional shifts. Using this model, the general interaction between the GW and a Gaia-like observation is discussed. Numerous Gaia-like astrometric solutions are made, taking as input simulated observations that include the effects of a continuous plain GW with constant parameters and periods ranging from ~50 days to 100 years. The resulting solutions are analysed in terms of the systematic errors on astrometric and attitude parameters, as well as the observational residuals. It is found that a significant part of the GW signal is absorbed by the astrometric parameters, leading to astrometric errors of a magnitude (in radians) comparable to the strain parameters. These astrometric errors are in general not possible to detect, because the true (unperturbed) astrometric parameters are not known to corresponding accuracy. The astrometric errors are especially large for specific GW frequencies that are linear combinations of two characteristic frequencies of the scanning law. Nevertheless, for all GW periods smaller than the time span covered by the observations, significant parts of the GW signal also go into the astrometric residuals. This fosters the hope for a GW detection algorithm based on the residuals of standard astrometric solutions.

 - **Abstract**
 The Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) observed for the first time highly polarized X-ray emission from the magnetar 1E 1841-045, targeted after a burst-active phase in August 2024. To date, IXPE has observed four other magnetars during quiescent periods, highlighting substantially different polarization properties. 1E 1841-045 exhibits a high, energy-dependent polarization degree, which increases monotonically from ~15% at 2-3 keV up to ~55% at 5.5-8 keV, while the polarization angle, aligned with the celestial North, remains fairly constant. The broadband spectrum (2-79 keV) obtained by combining simultaneous IXPE and NuSTAR data is well modeled by a blackbody and two power-law components. The unabsorbed 2-8 keV flux (~2E-11 erg/cm2/s) is about 10% higher than that obtained from archival XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations. The polarization of the soft, thermal component does not exceed ~25%, and may be produced by a condensed surface or a bombarded atmosphere. The intermediate power law is polarized at around 30%, consistent with predictions for resonant Compton scattering in the star magnetosphere; while, the hard power law exhibits a polarization degree exceeding 65%, pointing to a synchrotron/curvature origin.

 - **Abstract**
 Parker Solar Probe's (PSP) discovery of the prevalence of switchbacks (SBs), localised magnetic deflections in the nascent solar wind, has sparked interest in uncovering their origins. A prominent theory suggests these SBs originate in the lower corona through magnetic reconnection processes, closely linked to solar jet phenomena. Jets are impulsive events, observed across scales and solar atmosphere layers, associated with the release of magnetic twist and helicity. This study examines whether self-consistent jets can form and propagate into the super-Alfvénic wind, assesses the impact of distinct Parker solar wind profiles on jet dynamics, and determines if jet-induced magnetic untwisting waves display signatures typical of SBs. We employed parametric 3D numerical MHD simulations using the ARMS code to model the self-consistent generation of solar jets. Our study focuses on the propagation of solar jets in distinct atmospheric plasma $\beta$ and Alfvén velocity profiles, including a Parker solar wind. Our findings show that self-consistent coronal jets can form and propagate into the super-Alfvénic wind. Notable structures such as the leading Alfvénic wave and trailing dense-jet region were consistently observed across diverse plasma $\beta$ atmospheres. The jet propagation dynamics are significantly influenced by atmospheric variations, with changes in Alfvén velocity profiles affecting the group velocity and propagation ratio of the leading and trailing structures. U-loops, prevalent at jet onset, do not persist in the low-$\beta$ corona, but magnetic untwisting waves associated with jets show SB-like signatures. However, full-reversal SBs were not observed. These findings may explain the absence of full reversal SBs in the sub-Alfvénic wind and illustrate the propagation of magnetic deflections through jet-like events, shedding light on possible SB formation processes.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on IXPE and NuSTAR observations that began forty days following the onset of the 2024 outburst of the magnetar 1E 1841-045, marking the first ever IXPE observation of a magnetar in an enhanced state. Our spectropolarimetric analysis indicates that a non-thermal double power-law (PL) spectral model can fit the phase-averaged intensity data well, with the soft and hard components dominating below and above around 5 keV, respectively. We find that the soft PL exhibits a polarization degree (PD) of about 20% while the hard X-ray PL displays a PD of about 50%; both components have a polarization angle (PA) compatible with 0 degree. These results are supported through model-independent polarization analysis which shows an increasing PD from about 15% to 70% in the 2-3 keV and 6-8 keV ranges, respectively, while the PA remains consistent with 0 degree. We find marginal evidence for variability in the polarization properties with pulse phase, namely a higher PD at spin phases coinciding with the peak in the hard X-ray pulse. We compare the hard X-ray PL to the expectation from direct resonant inverse Compton scattering (RICS) and secondary pair cascade synchrotron radiation from primary high-energy RICS photons, finding that both can provide reasonable spectropolarimetric agreement with the data, yet, the latter more naturally. Finally, we suggest that the soft power law X-ray component may be emission emanating from a Comptonized corona in the inner magnetosphere.
#### Self-organized critical characteristics of TeV-photons from GRB 221009A

 - **Abstract**
 The very high-energy afterglow in GRB 221009A, known as the `Brightest Of All Time' (B.O.A.T.), has been thoroughly analyzed in previous studies. In this paper, we conducted a statistical analysis of the waiting time behavior of 172 TeV photons from the B.O.A.T. observed by LHAASO-KM2A. The following results were obtained: (I) The waiting time distribution (WTD) of these photons deviates from the exponential distribution. (II) The behavior of these photons exhibits characteristics resembling those of a self-organized critical system, such as power-law distribution and scale-invariance features in the waiting time distribution. The power-law distribution of waiting times is consistent with the prediction of a non-stationary process. (III) The relationship between the power-law slopes of the WTD and the scale-invariant characteristics of the Tsallis q-Gaussian distribution deviates from existing theory. We suggest that this deviation is due to the photons not being completely independent of each other. In summary, the power-law and scale-free characteristics observed in these photons imply a self-organized critical process in the generation of TeV photons from GRB 221009A. Based on other relevant research, we propose that the involvement of a partially magnetically dominated component and the continuous energy injection from the central engine can lead to deviations in the generation of TeV afterglow from the simple external shock-dominated process, thereby exhibiting the self-organized critical characteristics mentioned above.

 - **Abstract**
 From a spectroscopic survey of candidate H II regions in the Andromeda galaxy (M31) with MMT/Hectospec, we have identified 294 H II regions using emission line ratios and calculated elemental abundances from strong-line diagnostics (values ranging from sub-solar to super-solar) producing both Oxygen and Nitrogen radial abundance gradients. The Oxygen gradient is relatively flat, while the Nitrogen gradient is significantly steeper, indicating a higher N/O ratio in M31's inner regions, consistent with recent simulations of galaxy chemical evolution. No strong evidence was found of systematic galaxy-scale trends beyond the radial gradient. After subtracting the radial gradient from abundance values, we find an apparently stochastic and statistically significant scatter of standard deviation 0.06 dex, which exceeds measurement uncertainties. One explanation includes a possible collision with M32 200 - 800 Myrs ago. Using the two-point correlation function of the Oxygen abundance, we find that, similar to other spiral galaxies, M31 is well-mixed on sub-kpc scales but less so on larger (kpc) scales, which could be a result of an exponential decrease in mixing speed with spatial scale, and the aforementioned recent merger. Finally, the MMT spectroscopy is complemented by a dust continuum and CO survey of individual Giant Molecular Clouds, conducted with the Submillimeter Array. By combining the MMT and SMA observations, we obtain a unique direct test of the Oxygen abundance dependence of the $\alpha^{\prime}(^{12}\mathrm{CO})$ factor which is crucial to convert CO emission to dust mass. Our results suggest that within our sample there is no trend of the $\alpha^{\prime}(^{12}\mathrm{CO})$ with Oxygen abundance.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations from the James Webb Space Telescope revealed a surprisingly large number of galaxies formed at high redshift. Along with strong lensing studies and nearby galaxy observations, these could challenge the standard Lambda Cold Dark Matter cosmology with a power-law primordial power spectrum. In this study, we conduct high-resolution cosmological zoom-in dark matter-only simulations of Milky Way host size halos with a blue, tilted primordial power spectrum ($P(k)\propto k^{m_s}$ with $m_s>1$ at small scales $>1~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$). We find that the blue-tilted subhalo mass functions can be enhanced by more than a factor of two for subhalo masses $M_{\rm sub} \lesssim 10^{10}~ M_{\odot}$, whereas the subhalo $V_{\rm max}$ functions can be enhanced by a factor of four for maximum circular velocities $V_{\rm max}\lesssim 30 ~{\rm km/s}$. The blue-tilted scaled cumulative substructure fraction can be an order of magnitude higher at $\sim$10\% of the virial radius. The blue-tilted subhalos also have higher central densities, since the blue-tilted subhalos reach the same $V_{\rm max}$ at a smaller distance $R_{\rm max}$ from the center. We have also verified these findings with higher-resolution simulations.
