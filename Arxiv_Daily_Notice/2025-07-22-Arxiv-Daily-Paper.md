 - **Abstract**
 The Milky Way is surrounded by large amounts of hot gas at temperatures T>10^6 K, which represents a major baryon reservoir. We here explore the prospects of studying the hot coronal gas in Milky Way halo by analyzing the highly forbidden optical coronal lines of [FeX] and [FeXIV] in absorption against bright extragalactic background sources. We use a semi-analytic model of the Milky Way's coronal gas distribution together wih HESTIA simulations of the Local Group and observational constraints to predict the expected FeX and FeXIV column densities as well as the line shapes and strengths. We predict column densities of log N(FeX)=15.40 and log N(FeXIV)=15.23 in the Milky Way's hot halo and estimate that a minimum S/N of 50,000 (25,000) is required to detect [FeX] l6374.5 ([FeXIV] l5302.9) absorption at a 3sigma level. Using archical optical data from an original sample of 739 high resolution AGN spectra from VLT/UVES and KECK/HIRES, we generate a stacked composite spectrum to measure an upper limit for the column densities of FeX and FeXIV in the Milky Way's coronal gas. No [FeX] and [FeXIV] is detected in our composite spectrum, which achieves a maximum S/N= 1,240 near 5300 A. We derive 3sigma upper column-density limits of log N(FeX)<16.27 and log N(FeXIV)<15.85, in line with the above-mentioned predictions. While [FeX] and [FexIX] absorption is too weak to be detected with current optical data, we outline how up-coming extragalactic spectral surveys with millions of medium- to high-resolution optical spectra will provide the necessary sensitivity and spectral resolution to measure velocity-resolved [FeX] and [FeXIV] absorption in the Milky Way's coronal gas (and beyond). This gives the prospect of opening a new window for studying the dominant baryonic mass component of the Milky Way in the form of hot coronal gas via optical spectroscopy.

 - **Abstract**
 A popular model for Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) is the detonation of a CO white dwarf (WD) that is triggered by the prior detonation of a thin surface layer of helium, known as a double detonation (DD). We explore the unique early electromagnetic signatures that are expected from collision of the CO detonation with the He detonation. The three features are (1) a shock breakout flash, (2) a stage of planar shock breakout cooling, and finally (3) shock cooling emission from the thermal energy released by the collision. The planar phase is unique to the unusual density profile of the He-detonated layer in comparison to the steep profile at a stellar edge as is usually considered for shock breakout. The shock cooling emission can be modified by recombination, and we explore these effects. All together, we expect an initial flash dominated by the planar phase of $\sim6\times10^{43}\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$, which lasts ~5 s in the soft X-rays. This is followed by ~12-24 hrs of shock cooling at a luminosity of $3-10\times10^{40}\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$ in the optical/UV. We discuss prospects for detection of this early DD emission with current and upcoming surveys.
#### Modeling the Reverberation Response of the Broad Line Region in Active Galactic Nuclei II: Incorporating Photoionization Models

 - **Abstract**
 The broad emission lines (BELs) emitted by Active Galactic Nuclei respond to variations in the ionizing continuum emission from the accretion disk surrounding the central supermassive black hole (SMBH). This reverberation response provides insights into the structure and dynamics of the Broad Line Region (BLR). In Rosborough et al., 2024, we introduced a new forward-modeling tool, the Broad Emission Line MApping Code (BELMAC), which simulates the velocity-resolved reverberation response of the BLR to an input light curve. In this work, we describe a new version of BELMAC, which uses photoionization models to calculate the cloud luminosities for selected BELs. We investigated the reverberation responses of H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, MgII$\lambda$2800 and CIV$\lambda$1550 for models representing a disk-like BLR with Keplerian rotation, radiatively driven outflows, and inflows. The line responses generally provide a good indication of the respective luminosity-weighted radii. However, there are situations when the BLR exhibits a negative response to the driving continuum, causing overestimates of the luminosity-weighted radius. The virial mass derived from the models can differ dramatically from the actual SMBH mass, depending mainly on the disk inclination and velocity field. In single zone models, the BELs exhibit similar responses and profile shapes; two-zone models, such as a Keplerian disk and a biconical outflow, can reproduce observed differences between high- and low-ionization lines. Radial flows produce asymmetric line profile shapes due to both anisotropic cloud emission and electron scattering in an inter-cloud medium. These competing attenuation effects complicate the interpretation of profile asymmetries.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Galaxy clusters provide key insights into cosmic structure formation, galaxy formation and are essential for cosmological studies. Aims. We present a catalog of galaxy clusters detected in the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS-DR4) optimized for cosmological analyses and investigations of cluster properties. Each detection includes probabilistic membership assignments for the KiDS-DR4 galaxies within the magnitude range 15<r'<24. Methods. Using the Adaptive Matched Identifier of Clustered Objects (AMICO) algorithm, we identified 23965 clusters over an effective area of about 839 deg2 in the redshift range $0.1\le z \le0.9$, with a signal-to-noise ratio $S/N>3.5$. The sample is highly homogeneous across the entire survey thanks to the restrictive galaxy selection criteria we adopted. Spectroscopic data from the GAMA survey were used to calibrate the clusters photometric redshift and assess their uncertainties. We introduced algorithmic enhancements to AMICO to mitigate border effects among neighbor tiles. Quality flags are also provided for each cluster detection. The sample purity and completeness assessments have been estimated using the SinFoniA data driven approach, thus avoiding strong assumptions embedded in numerical simulations. We introduced a blinding scheme of the selection function meant to support the cosmological analyses. Results. Our cluster sample includes 321 cross-matches with the X-ray eRASS1 "primary" sample and 235 matches with the ACT-DR5 cluster sample. We derived a mass-proxy scaling relation based on intrinsic richness, $\lambda_*$, using masses from the eRASS1 catalog. Conclusions. The KiDS-DR4 cluster catalog provides a valuable data set for investigating galaxy cluster properties and contributes to cosmological studies by offering a large, well-characterized cluster sample.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a crossmatch between a combined catalog of X-ray sources and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Data Preview 1 (DP1) to identify optical counterparts. The six fields targeted as part of DP1 include the Extended Chandra Deep Field South (E-CDF-S), the Euclid Deep Field South (EDF-S), the Fornax Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy (Fornax dSph), 47 Tucanae (47 Tuc) and science validation fields with low galactic and ecliptic latitude (SV\_95\_-25 and SV\_38\_7, respectively). We find matches to 2314 of 3830 X-ray sources. We also compare our crossmatch to DP1 in the E-CDF-S field to previous efforts to identify optical counterparts. The probability of a chance coincidence match varies across each DP1 field, with overall high reliability in the E-CDF-S field, and lower proportion of high-reliability matches in the other fields. The majority of previously known sources that we detect are, unsurprisingly, active galaxies. We plot the X-ray-to-optical flux ratio against optical magnitude and color in an effort to identify Galactic accreting compact objects using a {\em Gaia} color threshold transformed to LSST $g$--$i$, but do not find any strong candidates in these primarily extragalactic counterparts. The DP1 dataset contains high-cadence photometry collected over a number of nights. We calculate the Stetson \( J \) variability index for each object under the hypothesis that X-ray counterparts tend to exhibit higher optical variability; however, the evidence is inconclusive whether our sample is more variable over DP1 timescales when compared to field objects.
#### Double tidal disruption events in the changing-look AGN Mrk1018

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal disruption events (TDEs) as excellent beacons to black hole (BH) accreting systems have been studied for more than five decades with a single star tidally disrupted by a central massive BH. However, if considering two stars passing through a central BH and being tidally disrupted in a short period, so-called double TDEs could be expected and lead to unique variability features very different from features from standard TDEs. Here, we report such oversimplified double TDEs in the known changing-look AGN Mrk1018, of which 15years-long light curve with plateau features can be described by two main-sequence stars tidally disrupted by the central supermassive BH. Meanwhile, the BH mass determined by the double TDEs is consistent with the M-sigma relation determined value by the measured stellar velocity dispersions in Mrk1018. The results indicate tight connections between the TDEs and the changing-look properties in Mrk1018.

 - **Abstract**
 High-mass stars are notable for several reasons: they are characterized by strong winds, which inject momentum and enriched material into their surroundings, and die spectacularly as supernovae, leaving behind compact remnants and heavy elements (such as those that make life on Earth possible). Despite their relative rarity, they play a disproportionate role in the evolution of the galaxies that host them, and likely also played a significant role in the early days of the Universe. A subset ($\sim$10\%) of these stars was also found to host magnetic fields on their surface. These fields impact their evolution, and may lead to exotic physics (e.g., heavy stellar-mass black holes, pair-instability supernovae, magnetars, etc.). However, the detection and measurement of magnetic fields is limited, due to current instrumentation, to nearby massive stars in the Milky Way. To truly understand how magnetism arises in massive stars, and what role it might have played in earlier stages of our Universe, we require next-generation hardware, such as the proposed near-infrared-to-ultraviolet spectropolarimeter Pollux, on the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). In this contribution, we detail how Pollux @ HWO will enable new frontiers in the study of magnetic massive stars, delivering results that will profoundly impact the fields of stellar formation, stellar evolution, compact objects, and stellar feedback.

 - **Abstract**
 Carbon-rich Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars are significant contributors of carbonaceous dust to the galactic environment, however the mechanisms and conditions for formation and subsequent evolution of dust around these stars remain open questions. Here we present JWST observations of the WR+WR colliding-wind binary Apep which reveal an intricate series of nested concentric dust shells that are abundant in detailed substructure. The striking regularity in these substructures between successive shells suggests an exactly repeating formation mechanism combined with a highly stable outflow that maintains a consistent morphology even after reaching 0.6 pc (assuming a distance of 2.4 kpc) into the interstellar medium. The concentric dust shells show subtle deviations from spherical outflow, which could reflect orbital modulation along the eccentric binary orbit or some mild degree of non-sphericity in the stellar wind. Tracking the evolution of dust across the multi-tiered structure, we measure the dust temperature evolution that can broadly be described with an amorphous carbon composition in radiative thermal equilibrium with the central stars. The temperature profile and orbital period place new distance constraints that support Apep being at a greater distance than previously estimated, reducing the line-of-sight and sky-plane wind speed discrepancy previously thought to characterise the system.
#### The ALMA Survey of 70 $μ$m Dark High-mass Clumps in Early Stages (ASHES). XII. Unanchored Forked Stream in the Propogating Path of a Protostellar Outflow

 - **Abstract**
 Outflows are key indicators of ongoing star formation. We report the discovery of an unanchored forked stream within the propagating path of an extremely young protostellar outflow in the 70 $\mu$m-dark clump G34.74-0.12, based on ALMA 1.3 mm observations with an angular resolution of 1''.6 (~ 5000 au). This outflow originate from a 9.7 $M_{\odot}$ core, exhibits a fork-shaped stream structure in its red-shifted lobe, which is traced by CO (2-1), SiO (5-4), and H$_2$CO (3$_{0,3}$-2$_{0,2}$). It has a momentum of 13 $M_{\odot}$ km s$^{-1}$, an energy of 107 $M_{\odot}$ km$^{2}$ s$^{-2}$, and a dynamical timescale of ~10$^{4}$ yr. Significantly, the enhanced relative abundances of SiO, H$_2$CO, and CH$_3$OH with respect to CO, along with the increased temperature at the forked point, indicate a collisional origin. The forked point does not coincide with any dust continuum core > 0.1 $M_{\odot}$. Moreover, CO (2-1) emission also traces three other outflows in this region, characterized by their masses (0.40, 0.02 and 0.15 $M_{\odot}$) and momenta (5.2, 0.2, 1.8 $M_{\odot}$ km s$^{-1}$), as part of the ALMA Survey of 70 $\mu$m dark High-mass clumps in Early Stages (ASHES) project. All the newly discovered morphological and kinematic features associated with these extremely young protostellar outflows (with timescales of 10$^3$ - 10$^4$ years) suggest that the initial stages of star formation are more complicated than previously understood.

 - **Abstract**
 The Calcium-K line profiles as functions of solar latitude and time were obtained through our observations from the Kodaikanal Solar Observatory using the solar tunnel telescope and spectrograph with a CCD detector. Observations were conducted on all days with favourable sky conditions. We analysed the data collected over a period of about ten years to study the variations in the Ca II K line profiles recorded between 2015 and 2024, of which 709 days of data were found useful. The temporal and time-averaged latitudinal variations of the K$_{1}$ width, K$_{2}$ width, K$_{3}$ intensity and the intensity ratios of K$_{2v}$/K$_{2r}$ and K$_{2v}$/K$_{3}$ were computed using a semi-automated program. The parameters showed asymmetric increases towards the higher latitudes, with the rates of increase being higher in the southern hemisphere. The temporal plots for K$_{1}$ width and K$_{3}$ intensity showed positive correlations with the plage and spot filling factors, whereas the temporal plots for K$_{2}$ width, K$_{2v}$/K$_{2r}$ and K$_{2v}$/K$_{3}$ intensity ratios showed negative correlations. The time-averaged latitudinal plot for K$_{1}$ width has small peaks near 25°N and 20°S. The K$_{2}$ width has a small peak at 0°. The K$_{3}$ intensity has peaks at 20°N and 15°S. The K$_{2v}$/K$_{2r}$ intensity ratio shows peaks at 50$\degree$N, 0° and 40°S. The K$_{2v}$/K$_{3}$ intensity ratio shows peaks at 60°N, 0° and 60°S. Slope profiles show spectral response to magnetic activity peaks near K$_{3}$ with north-south asymmetries. Such variations in the line profiles are important in the studies of solar irradiance, surface flux transport and solar dynamo.

 - **Abstract**
 Much of the carbonaceous dust observed in the early universe may originate from colliding wind binaries (CWBs) hosting hot, luminous Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. Downstream of the shock between the stellar winds there exists a suitable environment for dust grain formation, and the orbital motion of the stars wraps this dust into richly structured spiral geometries. The Apep system is the most extreme WR-CWB in our Milky Way: two WR stars produce a complex spiral dust nebula, whose slow expansion has been linked to a gamma-ray burst progenitor. It has been unclear whether the O-type supergiant 0.7" distant from the WR+WR binary is physically associated with the system, and whether it affects the dusty nebula. Multi-epoch VLT/VISIR and JWST/MIRI observations show that this northern companion star routinely carves a cavity in the dust nebula - the first time such an effect has been observed in a CWB - which unambiguously associates the O star as a bound component to the Apep system. These observations are used together with a new geometric model to infer the cavity geometry and the orbit of the WR+WR binary, yielding the first strong constraints on wind and orbital parameters. We confirm an orbital period of over 190 years for the inner binary - nearly an order of magnitude longer than the next longest period dust-producing WR-CWB. This, together with the confirmed classification as a hierarchical triple, cements Apep as a singular astrophysical laboratory for studying colliding winds and the terminal life stages of the most massive star systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Dwarf galaxies dominate the galaxy population across all redshifts, and majority of mergers are expected to occur between them. However, the impact of dwarf-dwarf mergers on star formation (SF) is less understood. In this context, we study SF in 6,155 isolated dwarf galaxies (no massive galaxy, $M_{*} > 10^{10} M_{\odot}$, within 1 Mpc$^3$), including 194 post-mergers and 5,961 non-interacting galaxies, spanning stellar masses of $10^7$ - $10^{9.6}$ M$_{\odot}$ and redshifts of 0.01 - 0.12. Post-mergers sample is from a previous study, which used deep optical images to identify dwarf galaxies with merger signatures. Using GALEX FUV data, we estimate star formation rates (SFRs) and find difference in log(SFR) between a post-merger galaxy and the median of its corresponding control sample, matched in stellar mass and redshift. SFR offsets range from -2 to +2 dex, indicating both enhancement and suppression of SF in our sample with 67% of post-mergers showing enhancement. The median SFR is found to be elevated by 0.24 dex ($\sim$1.73 times) in post-mergers, comparable to enhancements seen in massive galaxies. SF is found to be similarly enhanced in both the central (6" diameter region) and outer regions of post-mergers with respect to their non-interacting counterparts. This is in contrast to what is observed in massive galaxies, where the merger-triggered SF is more significant in the central regions. In the given small range of redshift, post-merger dwarfs exhibit a higher median specific SFR compared to their non-interacting counterparts. About 33% of post-mergers are quenched, possibly reflecting a later stage of the post-merger regime, where quenching can happen as observed in massive galaxies. This study suggests that dwarf-dwarf mergers can affect SF in the local universe. A more comprehensive study of post-merger dwarfs is required to understand their evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetars are widely considered to be the central engine of fast radio bursts (FRBs), capable of driving coherent radio emission through magnetic energy release. The accumulation of burst energy can be employed as a probe to reveal the nature of FRB energy engine. Current observations of repeaters have not yet provided sufficient constraints on the magnetic energy budget for magnetar models. Here we report 11,553 bursts detected from the hyper-active repeating source FRB 20240114A over 214 days during a recent active episode, with a peak burst rate as high as 729 hr$^{-1}$, above the detection threshold of the monitoring observations using Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). This represents the largest recorded burst sample from a single FRB source, comprising more than four times as many bursts as any previously known repeater and exceeding the cumulative total of all published bursts to date. Assuming a typical value of radio efficiency of $10^{-4}$ and a beaming factor of 0.1, the estimated total isotropic burst energy of this source exceeds 86\% of the dipolar magnetic energy of a typical magnetar with a polar surface magnetic field of $10^{15}$ G and a radius of $10^6$ cm. The total energy release of this source is about one and a half orders of magnitude higher than that of other known repeaters. We further provide the most stringent lower limit of $\bf{4.7\times10^{32}}$ G cm$^3$ on the magnetic moment of the underlying magnetar. The findings suggest that either the central engine emits with exceptionally high radio efficiency, possesses a small beaming factor, or it should be a more powerful compact object than typically considered in current magnetar models.
#### Searching for periodic signals and quasi-periodic oscillations from an extremely active cycle of FRB 20240114A

 - **Abstract**
 Possible periodic features in fast radio bursts (FRBs) may provide insights into their astrophysical origins. Using extensive observations from the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), we conduct a search for periodicity across multiple timescales in the exceptionally active repeater source FRB 20240114A. A detailed analysis of 11,553 bursts reveals three candidate periodic signals (3.4-6$\sigma$), with frequencies of approximately 1.486 Hz, 1.576 Hz, and 1.865 Hz. This finding offers tentative evidence for a potential association with magnetar spin, although further studies are necessary for definitive confirmation. On longer timescales, a 67.5-69.2 day activity cycle is identified using two independent methods, with a significance exceeding $3.5\sigma$. In the burst time series, quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in the range of a few hundred Hz are identified, with a significance exceeding 5$\sigma$, and a strong correlation is found between their central frequencies and widths (Pearson $R=0.97$). The decomposed temporal profiles of these QPOs suggest an amplitude-modulated quasi-periodic signal. The burst clusters manifest periodic burst trains ranging from a few milliseconds to several tens of milliseconds, revealing transient periodic characteristics. Despite the unprecedentedly large sample size from a single repeating FRB source during a time-continuous active period, no stable periodic signals are detected. Instead, there are multiple QPOs that dynamically evolve over time. These results clarify the bias of previous studies that occasionally detected QPOs believed to be potentially related to the spin of compact objects.

 - **Abstract**
 A primary objective in contemporary low background physics is the search for rare and novel phenomena beyond the Standard Model of particle physics, e.g. the scattering off of a potential Dark Matter particle or the neutrinoless double beta decay. The success of such searches depends on a reliable background prediction via Monte Carlo simulations. A widely used toolkit to construct these simulations is Geant4, which offers the user a wide choice of how to model the physics of particle interactions. For example, for electromagnetic interactions, Geant4 provides pre-defined sets of models: physics constructors. As decay products of radioactive contaminants contribute to the background mainly via electromagnetic interactions, the physics constructor used in a Geant4 simulation may have an impact on the total energy deposition inside the detector target. To facilitate the selection of physics constructors for simulations of experiments that are using CaWO$_\mathrm{4}$ and Ge targets, we quantify their impact on the total energy deposition for several test cases. These cases consist of radioactive contaminants commonly encountered, covering energy depositions via $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$ particles, as well as two examples for the target thickness: thin and bulky. We also consider the computing performance of the studied physics constructors.

 This work describes new dynamical simulations of terrestrial planet formation. The simulations started at the protoplanetary disk stage, when planetesimals formed and accreted into protoplanets, and continued past the late stage of giant impacts. We explored the effect of different parameters, such as the initial radial distribution of planetesimals and Type-I migration of protoplanets, on the final results. In each case, a thousand simulations were completed to characterize the stochastic nature of the accretion process. In the model best able to satisfy various constraints, Mercury, Venus, and Earth accreted from planetesimals that formed early near the silicate sublimation line near 0.5 au and migrated by disk torques. For Venus and Earth to end up at 0.7-1 au, Type-I migration had to be directed outward, for example as the magnetically driven winds reduced the surface gas density in the inner part of the disk. Mercury was left behind near the original ring location. We suggest that Mars and multiple Mars-sized protoplanets grew from a distinct outer source of planetesimals at 1.5-2 au. While many migrated inwards to accrete onto the proto-Earth, our Mars was the lone survivor. This model explains: (1) the masses and orbits of the terrestrial planets, (2) the chemical composition of the Earth, where ~70% and ~30% come from reduced inner-ring and more-oxidized outer-ring materials, and (3) the isotopic differences of the Earth and Mars. It suggests that the Moon-forming impactor Theia plausibly shared a similar isotopic composition and accretion history with that of the proto-Earth.

 - **Abstract**
 The landmark detection of both gravitational waves (GWs) and electromagnetic (EM) radiation from the binary neutron star merger GW170817 has spurred efforts to streamline the follow-up of GW alerts in current and future observing runs of ground-based GW detectors. Within this context, the radio band of the EM spectrum presents unique challenges. Sensitive radio facilities capable of detecting the faint radio afterglow seen in GW170817, and with sufficient angular resolution, have small fields of view compared to typical GW localization areas. Additionally, theoretical models predict that the radio emission from binary neutron star mergers can evolve over weeks to years, necessitating long-term monitoring to probe the physics of the various post-merger ejecta components. These constraints, combined with limited radio observing resources, make the development of more coordinated follow-up strategies essential -- especially as the next generation of GW detectors promise a dramatic increase in detection rates. Here, we present RADAR, a framework designed to address these challenges by promoting community-driven information sharing, federated data analysis, and system resilience, while integrating AI methods for both GW signal identification and radio data aggregation. We show that it is possible to preserve data rights while sharing models that can help design and/or update follow-up strategies. We demonstrate our approach through a case study of GW170817, and discuss future directions for refinement and broader application.

 - **Abstract**
 Moreton waves are widely regarded as the chromospheric counterpart of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) waves propagating in the corona. However, direct observational evidence confirming their simultaneous propagation across multiple atmospheric layers from the corona through the transition region to the chromosphere has been lacking. In this study, we present comprehensive observational evidence of a three-dimensional (3D) fast-mode wave propagating from the corona through the transition region into the chromosphere, exhibiting a gradual deceleration. Additionally, this wave interacts with three filaments (F1, F2, and F3) along its path, inducing oscillation with multiple amplitudes: Filaments F1 and F2 exhibit simultaneous horizontal and vertical large-scale oscillations ($\sim$\speed{20}), while Filament F3 only exhibits vertical small-scale oscillation ($\sim$\speed{4}). Interestingly, F1 displays a similar oscillation period of about 500\,s in both horizontal and vertical directions, whereas F2 shows significantly different periods in these two dimensions (1100\,s and 750\,s), and F3 exhibits only a vertical oscillation with a period of about 450\,s. Based on this kinematic behavior, we propose that their oscillations were likely triggered by compression from the flanks of the dome-shaped wavefront. We further estimate the magnetic fields of the filaments. The radial (axial) magnetic fields for F1 and F2 are estimated to be 14.9\,G (28.6\,G) and 9.9\,G (18.6\,G), respectively. For F3, we estimate its radial magnetic field to be 16.6\,G.

 - **Abstract**
 Planets orbiting young, solar-type stars are embedded in a more energetic environment than that of the solar neighbourhood. They experience harsher conditions due to enhanced stellar magnetic activity and wind shaping the secular evolution of a planetary atmosphere. This study is dedicated to the characterisation of the magnetic activity of eleven Sun-like stars, with ages between 0.2 and 6.1 Gyr and rotation periods between 4.6 and 28.7 d. Based on a sub-sample of six stars, we aim to study the large-scale magnetic field, which we then use to simulate the associated stellar wind and environment. Finally, we want to determine the conditions during the early evolution of planetary habitability. We analysed high-resolution spectropolarimetric data collected in 2018 and 2019 with Narval. We computed activity diagnostics from chromospheric lines such as CaII H&K, H$\alpha$, and the CaII infrared triplet, as well as the longitudinal magnetic field from circularly polarised least-squares deconvolution profiles. For six stars exhibiting detectable circular polarisation signals, we reconstructed the large-scale magnetic field at the photospheric level by means of Zeeman-Doppler imaging (ZDI). In agreement with previous studies, we found a global decrease in the activity indices and longitudinal field with increasing age and rotation period. The large-scale magnetic field of the six sub-sample stars displays a strength between 1 and 25 G and reveals substantial contributions from different components such as poloidal (40-90 %), toroidal (10-60 %), dipolar (30-80 %), and quadrupolar (10-40 %), with distinct levels of axisymmetry (6-84 %) and short-term variability of the order of months. Ultimately, this implies that exoplanets tend to experience a broad variety of stellar magnetic environments after their formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultraluminous and hyperluminous X-ray sources (ULXs and HLXs) are among the brightest astrophysical objects in the X-ray sky. While ULXs most likely host stellar-mass compact objects accreting at super-Eddington rates, HLXs are compelling candidates for accreting intermediate-mass black holes. Our goal is to produce a clean sample of HLXs by removing possible contaminants and characterise the spectral properties of the remaining population. Starting with a set of 115 HLXs detected by XMM-Newton, we identified and removed contaminants (AGNs, X-ray diffuse emission detected as point-like, and tidal disruption event candidates) and retrieved 40 sources for which XMM-Newton spectra are available. We fitted them with an absorbed power law model and determined their unabsorbed luminosities and hardness ratios. We constructed the hardness-luminosity diagram, compared the results with the spectral properties of the HLX prototype, ESO 243-49 HLX-1, and conducted a deeper analysis on a few promising candidates. The resulting HLX population spans a luminosity range from $1\times10^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$ to nearly $10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and is homogeneously spread in hardness between 0.5 and 5. Half of the population has hardness ratios higher than a typical AGN, and could be considered the extension of the ULX population at higher energies. We found four very soft outliers, which are characterised by steep power law spectra and no X-ray emission above 1$-$2 keV, similarly to ESO 243-49 HLX-1. Those with multi-epoch archival data show changes in luminosity up to almost two orders of magnitudes. We show that sources currently identified as HLXs can be more diverse than ULXs and disentangling between different types of objects is not trivial with currently available data. New observations would be beneficial to expand the current sample and uncover the true nature of many objects of this class.

 - **Abstract**
 We present optical and near-infrared spectroscopy of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, obtained with Gemini-S/GMOS and NASA IRTF/SpeX on 2025 July 5 and July 14. The optical spectrum shows a red slope of approximately 10% per 1000 angstroms between 0.5 and 0.8 microns, closely resembling that of typical D-type asteroids. At longer wavelengths, the near-infrared spectrum flattens significantly to approximately 3% per 1000 angstroms from 0.9 to 1.5 microns, consistent with the spectral behavior of large water ice grains in the coma. Spectral modeling with an areal mixture of 70% Tagish Lake meteorite and 30% 10-micron-sized water ice successfully reproduces both the overall continuum and the broad absorption feature near 2.0 microns. The 1.5-micron water ice band, however, is not detected, likely due to the limited signal-to-noise of the IRTF data and dilution by refractory materials. The ~30% ice fraction should be interpreted as an approximate, order-of-magnitude estimate of the coma composition. The agreement between the GMOS and SpeX spectra, taken nine days apart, suggests short-term stability in the coma's optical properties. Our observations reveal that 3I/ATLAS is an active interstellar comet containing abundant water ice, with a dust composition more similar to D-type asteroids than to ultrared trans-Neptunian objects.

 - **Abstract**
 A majority of JWST/NIRSpec/IFU studies at high redshifts to date have focused on UV-bright or massive objects, while our understanding of low-mass galaxies at early cosmic times remains limited. In this work, we present NIRSpec/IFS high-resolution observations of two low-mass ($M_* < 10^9 \ M_\odot$), low-metallicity ($[12 + \log(\text{O/H})] < 8$) galaxies at $z \sim 7.66$ with evidence of hosting AGN. Using spatially-resolved maps of rest-frame optical emission lines, we find flat metallicity profiles, indicative of ISM redistribution by outflows or past merging. We identify kinematical components decoupled from galactic rotation with velocities of $\sim 250 - 500 \ \text{km} \ \text{s}^{-1}$. We argue that these components are likely tracing outflows, possibly AGN-driven, for which we infer outflow rates of $\sim 21 - 40 \ M_\odot \ \text{yr}^{-1}$, suggesting they may suppress future star formation. We compare our observational results to those from the new large-volume AESOPICA simulations, which fully incorporate different models of black hole growth and AGN feedback. We find that our observational results of $v_\text{out}/v_\text{esc}$ and $\dot{M}_\text{out}$/SFR are consistent with the AGN population in these simulations, hinting that AGN-driven feedback may contribute to quenching both in our systems and in a wider population of low-mass galaxies in the early Universe. This novel study demonstrates the necessity of deep IFU observations to decompose the complex kinematics and morphology of high-$z$ galaxies, trace outflows, and constrain the effect of feedback in these low-mass systems.

 Gamma-ray bursts observed in high-energies allow the investigation of the emission processes of these still puzzling events. In this study, we perform general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations to investigate GRB 090510, a peculiar short GRB detected by Fermi-LAT. Our primary goal is to model the energetics, jet structure, variability, and opening angle of the burst to understand its underlying physical conditions. We tested the 2D and 3D models and estimated the time scale of variability. The predicted energetics and the jet opening angle reconcile with the observed ones with 1$\sigma$ when considering that the jet opening angles also evolve with redshift. Furthermore, we extend our analysis by incorporating dynamical ejecta into selected models to study its impact on jet collimation at smaller distances. In addition, we investigated a suite of models exhibiting a broad range of observable GRB properties, thereby extending our understanding beyond this specific event.

 - **Abstract**
 Thin and thick discs are prominent components in the Milky Way and other spiral galaxies, but their formation histories are not yet understood, which is particularly true for thick discs. This is partially due to the fact that we lack sufficient understanding of thin and thick discs in other galaxies to determine how common features of the Milky Way's discs are. Here, we conduct an integral field spectroscopy study of the thin and thick discs in the edge-on Milky Way analogue IC 2531, using observational data from the WiFeS IFU spectrograph on the ANU 2.3m telescope. We provide spectral analysis of IC 2531's kinematics and stellar populations in the thin and thick disc regions by conducting pPXF fitting with Vazdekis models. We found that IC 2531's disc above the dust plane generally has chemical properties between the Milky Way's chemical thin and thick disc. IC 2531's thick disc is somewhat similar to the Milky Way's in terms of stellar populations: on average, it is older, more metal-poor than its corresponding thin disc, but similarly alpha-enhanced in general. But we do find a clearly alpha-rich thick disc bin though one of our "thick disc" bins may be dominated by a warped thin disc. These results may help to constrain formation theories of thick discs.

 - **Abstract**
 Blazars, including BL Lacs and FSRQs, are the most luminous extragalactic {\gamma}-ray sources. They account for about 56% of the sources listed in the recent Fermi-LAT catalog (4FGL-DR4). The optical and UV spectra of BL Lacs are nearly featureless, making it difficult to precisely determine their redshifts. Consequently, nearly half of the {\gamma}-ray BL Lacs lack reliable redshift measurements. This poses a major challenge, since redshift is crucial for studying the cosmic evolution of the blazar population and {\gamma}-ray propagation studies such as indirect evidence of EBL, placing constraints on IGMF and searches for LIV and ALPs. This paper is the fourth in a series dedicated to determining the redshift of a sample of blazars identified as key targets for future observations with the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO). We performed Monte Carlo simulations to select {\gamma}-ray blazars detected by Fermi-LAT with hard spectra, that lack redshift measurements. These blazars are expected to be detectable by CTAO within 30 hours or less of exposure assuming an average flux state. In this fourth paper, we report the results of detailed spectroscopic observations of 29 blazars using the ESO/VLT, Keck II, and SALT telescopes. Our analysis involved a thorough search for spectral lines in the spectra of each blazar, and when features of the host galaxy were identified, we modeled its properties. We also compared the magnitudes of the targets during the observations to their long-term light curves. In the sample studied, 9 of 29 sources were observed with a high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N > 100), while the remaining 20 were observed with a moderate or low S/N. We successfully determined firm redshifts for 12 blazars, ranging from 0.1636 to 1.1427, and identified two lower limit redshifts at z > 1.0196 and z > 1.4454. The remaining 15 BL Lac objects exhibited featureless spectra.

This software encompasses several critical requirements, including control of the filter wheel, calibration half-wave plate, calibration polarizer, guider positioning, focusers, and 4 concurrent CCD cameras. It also manages the host telescope and dome operations while logging operational parameters, user commands, and environmental conditions for troubleshooting and stability. It provides a user-friendly graphical user interface, secure access control, a notification system for errors, and a modular configuration for troubleshooting are integral to the software's architecture. It is accessible over the internet with the backend developed using NodeJS and ExpressJS, featuring a RESTful API that interacts with a MongoDB database, facilitating real-time status updates and data logging. The frontend utilizes the this http URL framework, with Redux for state management and Material UI for the graphical components. The system also allows for automatic observations based on user-defined schedules. A Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI CD) pipeline ensures the software's reliability through automated testing and streamlined deployment. The WALOPControl software is a key component of the PASIPHAE (Polar-Areas Stellar Imaging in Polarimetry High Accuracy Experiment) project, which aims to study the dust and magnetic field of the Milky Way by observing the polarization of starlight.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the Type I migration of planets in low-density cavities and inner discs of strongly magnetized young stars using global three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations, where the strong magnetic field carves the low-density cavity. Simulations show that a planet in the cavity migrates inwards up to the radius at which the outer Lindblad resonances are inside the cavity. At smaller radii, the migration stalls. The migration is faster if a star accretes in the unstable regime where the temporary tongues penetrate the magnetosphere. If a planet is in a highly inclined orbit, it interacts with the disc, and the eccentricity increases due to the Kozai-Lydov mechanism. A planet may stop or reverse its migration in the inner disc before entering the cavity. The magnetosphere interacts with the inner disc, changing its density distribution such that migration slows down or is even reversed. A tilted magnetosphere also excites density and bending waves in the disc, which may slow down migration and also increase the inclination and eccentricity of the planet. When a planet reaches the disc-cavity boundary, it is typically trapped at the boundary by asymmetric corotation torque. A planet moves together with the boundary when the cavity expands. Overall, a magnetized star provides an environment for slow or reverse migration.

 - **Abstract**
 The prompt $\gamma$-rays of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) may originate from the photosphere of a relativistic jet. However, only a few GRBs have been observed with evident blackbody-like emission, for example, GRB~090902B. It has been demonstrated that internal dissipation processes, such as magnetic reconnection, can occur within the relativistic jet and thereby drive violent turbulence in the dissipation region. In this paper, we study the photospheric emission of a jet with turbulence below its photosphere. Here, the turbulence is modeled phenomenological under the assumption that the four-velocity of its eddies follows a Gaussian distribution in the jet's co-moving frame. It is found that the turbulence scatters photons to high energies and thus intensifies the emission in the high-energy regime. The corresponding distortion of the radiation field can be preserved if and only if the turbulence occurs in a region with incomplete photon-electron coupling. Consequently, the observed radiation spectrum can be reshaped into a Band-like spectrum.

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray bursts are expected to be generated by structured jets, whose profiles significantly impact their afterglow emission. Previously, we developed a numerical code jetsimpy, to model the afterglow of jets with arbitrary angular profiles. In this study, we extend the code to incorporate a stratified radial profile, enabling it to model jets with arbitrary axisymmetric two-dimensional structures. The radial profile leads to the formation of a reverse shock. We modeled the shock system using an energy conservation prescription, which differs from the pressure balance approach. This leads to remarkably different predictions for reverse shock emission. In particular, we find that the reverse shock emission in the thin shell case is significantly overestimated in analytic models. We also explore the off-axis reverse shock emission from structured jets, where the cores belong to thick shell cases and the wings belong to thin shell cases. We have confirmed the prediction that off-axis observers may see a thin-to-thick transition, but we find that the light curve morphology is hard to distinguish from pure thin or thick shell cases. A radial profile also introduces hydrodynamic energy injection. As such, our code can naturally apply to refreshed shock cases, where the modeling of kilonova afterglows is demonstrated as an example. To validate our method, we fit the optical flash of GRB 990123, showing good agreement with the data. The upgraded jetsimpy provides unprecedented flexibility in modeling the afterglow emission of jets with various profiles, including those derived from general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 Long-period radio transients (LPTs) represent a recently uncovered class of Galactic radio sources exhibiting minute-to-hour periodicities and highly polarised pulses of second-to-minute duration. Their phenomenology does not fit exactly in any other class, although it might resemble that of radio magnetars or of white dwarf (WD) radio emitting binary systems. Notably, two LPTs with confirmed multi-wavelength counterparts have been identified as synchronised white dwarf-M dwarf binaries (polars). Meanwhile, systems such as AR Scorpii and J1912-44 exhibit short-period pulsations in a hr-tight orbit, with polarized radio emission proposed to be generated by the interaction of the WD magnetosphere with the low-mass companion wind. Here we demonstrate that both LPTs and WD binary pulsars can be explained within a single geometric model in which radio emission is triggered when the magnetic pole of a rotating white dwarf intersects its companion's wind in the binary orbital plane. We use a 36-year timing baseline to infer the orbital period and binary geometry solely from radio data of GPM J1839-10, the longest-active LPT known. The model naturally predicts its intermittent emission and double-pulse structure. Crucially, we show that the beat period between the spin and the orbit matches the observed pulse substructure and polarisation signatures, providing strong support for the model. Applying this model to the WD binary pulsar J1912-44, it can also reproduce the system emission and geometry. Our results place GPM J1839-10, and other LPTs in general and radio emitting WD binaries, at different stages of a continuum between intermediate and synchronised polars, suggesting a unified population of magnetic WD binaries driving coherent radio emission.

 - **Abstract**
 To understand the chemical origin of the Solar system, the chemical evolution along the star/planet formation is a key issue. Extensive observational studies have demonstrated a chemical diversity in young low-mass protostellar sources so far. Furthermore, chemical differentiations in the vicinity of the protostars have recently been reported. This suggests that molecular distribution is sensitive to a change in the physical conditions associated with disk formation. Some kinds of molecular lines, especially Sulfur-bearing species, are therefore prospected to work as molecular markers to highlight particular structures of disk-forming regions. Conversely, detailed physical characterization is essential for elucidating the chemical evolution occurring there. Machine learnings may help us to disentangle the observed structures. Angular momentum of the gas is the key topic to understand the structure formation, which is also essential to the integration of the chemical and physical characterization.

 - **Abstract**
 The launch of the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE), the first space-based polarimeter since 1978, offers a two order of magnitude improvement to the measurement of X-ray polarisation than its predecessor OSO-8, offering unprecedented precision for the measurement of polarisation degree and polarisation angle of X-ray sources. This advancement lends itself to the birth of a number of contemporary techniques to study Galactic compact objects, including X-ray polarimetry-timing, the study of how polarisation properties evolve over short timescales. However, the statistical nature of polarisation measurements poses a challenge for studies on arbitrarily short timescales, as a large number of photons are required to achieve statistically significant measurements of polarisation degree and angle for time-resolved analyses. Furthermore, if the polarisation variability is stochastic, then phase-folding techniques introduce systematic errors in the phase assignment of photons. Ingram and Maccarone presented a model independent Fourier-based technique that circumvents these issues. It can be used on arbitrarily short timescales for any kind of variability, whether aperiodic, quasi-periodic or purely periodic. Here we implement this method on real IXPE data. We address several instrumental effects and test the technique on X-ray pulsars, RX-J0440.9+4431 and Hercules X-1 . We verify that our technique recovers the polarisation variability signal that we already know to be there from typical phase-folding techniques. It will now be possible to study fast stochastic polarisation variability of X-ray sources, with applications including quasi-periodic oscillations, mass accretion rate fluctuations, and reverberation mapping.

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray emission in the GeV-TeV range from the solar disk is likely to arise from collisions of galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) with solar atmospheric plasma. In a previous study, we demonstrated that closed turbulent magnetic arcades trap efficiently GCRs leading to a gamma-ray flux consistent with the Fermi-HAWC observations (from $\sim 0.1$ GeV to $\sim 1$ TeV). Here, we model a synthetic magnetic field with a static, laminar structure of open field lines in the chromosphere increasingly braiding near the solar surface, with a scale height of $\sim 10^{-2} R_\odot$. The height-dependent increase in magnetic field line braiding is modulated by an exponential scalar function, mimicking the bending of the photo- and chromo-spheric magnetic field revealed by polarimetric observations and reproduced by MHD simulations. Employing 3D test-particle numerical simulations, we investigate how distorted magnetic field lines affect the gamma-rays production by injecting GeV-TeV protons into both magnetically laminar and braided regions. We find that with the chosen spatial resolution this synthetic magnetic field can account for the $> 10$ GeV gamma-ray spectrum observed by Fermi-LAT/HAWC. A rebrightening between approximately $30$ and $100$ GeV (following a $\sim 30$ GeV spectral dip), suggests an enhanced confinement within the photo-/chromospheric layer by a stronger braiding.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the detection and characterization of ultrafast outflows (UFOs) in the X-ray spectra of the tidal disruption event (TDE) AT2020afhd, based on observations from NICER, Swift, and XMM. Prominent blueshifted absorption features were detected exclusively during the intermediate phase of the event, occurring between days 172 and 212 within the first 300 days post-discovery. During this period, the UFO appeared no earlier than day 74, strengthened between days 172 and 194, and disappeared after day 215. This marks the first time that the full evolutionary sequence of X-ray outflows has been observed in a TDE. Moreover, the outflows exhibited a dramatic deceleration from ~0.19c to ~0.0097c over a span of approximately 10 days. Photoionization spectral analysis reveals an inverse correlation between outflow velocity and ionization parameter, in contradiction to the predictions from radiation pressure-driven wind. Eventually, we propose that the delayed onset of the outflows may result from an increase in the wind opening angle and/or metal enrichment, particularly iron and oxygen, during the disk formation phase.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the observational signatures of outflow rotation in protostellar systems using magnetohydrodynamics simulations of protostellar evolution with radiative transfer and synthetic observation. The velocity gradient perpendicular to the outflow axis indicates outflow rotation. The rotation signature is clearly seen in the moment 1 map and a position-velocity (PV) diagram across an outflow lobe made from our model with an inclination angle of i>~85{degree sign}, as in observational studies of protostellar outflows. Velocity projection with lower inclinations distorts the moment 1 map because the outflow vertical (propagation) velocity contributes more to the line-of-sight velocity, leading to an incorrect outflow axis direction. The PV diagram adopting the incorrect outflow axis shows no clear velocity gradient. These effects may prevent us from identifying outflow rotation. Our analysis implies that rotational signatures can be obscured in ~2/3 to ~4/5 of the total outflow population (i<70{degree sign}-80{degree sign}), regardless of the evolutionary stage. Complicated structures in observed outflows make it difficult to determine the outflow, which may result in the apparent non-detection of outflow rotation.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently discovered supermassive black holes with masses of $\sim10^8\,M_\odot$ at redshifts $z\sim9$-$11$ in active galactic nuclei (AGN) pose severe challenges to our understanding of supermassive black hole formation. One proposed channel are rapidly accreting supermassive PopIII stars (SMSs) that form in large primordial gas halos and grow up to $<10^6\,M_\odot$. They eventually collapse due to the general relativistic instability and could lead to supernova-like explosions. This releases massive and energetic ejecta that then interact with the halo medium via an optically thick shock. We develop a semi-analytic model to compute the shock properties, bolometric luminosity, emission spectrum and photometry over time. The initial data is informed by stellar evolution and general relativistic SMS collapse simulations. We find that SMS explosion light curves reach a brightness $\sim10^{45\mathrm{-}47}\,\mathrm{erg/s}$ and last $10$-$200$ years in the source frame - up to $250$-$3000$ years with cosmic time dilation. This makes them quasi-persistent sources which vary indistinguishably to little red dots and AGN within $0.5$-$9\,(1+z)$ yrs. Bright SMS explosions are observable in long-wavelength JWST filters up to $z\leq20$ ($24$-$26$ mag) and pulsating SMSs up to $z\leq15$. EUCLID and the Roman space telescope (RST) can detect SMS explosions at $z<11$-$12$. Their deep fields could constrain the SMS rate down to $10^{-11}$Mpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$, which is much deeper than JWST bounds. Based on cosmological simulations and observed star formation rates, we expect to image up to several hundred SMS explosions with EUCLID and dozens with RST deep fields.

 - **Abstract**
 The ASTRI Mini-Array is an international collaboration led by the Italian National Institute for Astrophysics. The project aims to construct and operate an array of nine Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes to study gamma-ray sources at very high energy (TeV) and perform stellar intensity interferometry observations. We describe the updated Online Observation Quality System (OOQS) software architecture. The OOQS is one of the subsystems of the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system. It aims to execute real-time data quality checks on the data acquired by the Cherenkov cameras and intensity interferometry instruments and provide feedback to both SCADA and the Operator about abnormal conditions detected. The data quality results are stored in the Quality Archive for further investigation and sent to the Operator Human Machine Interface (HMI) through Kafka.
#### The Probable Direct-Imaging Detection of the Stellar Companion to Betelgeuse

 - **Abstract**
 Betelgeuse -- the closest M-supergiant to the Sun -- has recently been predicted to host a lower-mass stellar companion that orbits the primary with a period of $\sim 6$ years. The putative stellar companion is thought to cause the long photometric modulation observed in Betelgeuse, which cannot be explained by stellar pulsations. Additionally, radial velocity and astrometric data also point to a stellar companion. Here we present diffraction-limited optical speckle imaging observations obtained on the 8.1-meter Gemini North telescope in 2020 and 2024. The 2020 observations were taken during the Great Dimming event, and at a time when the stellar companion was predicted to be unobservable because it was directly in-line with Betelgeuse itself. The 2024 observations were taken three days after the predicted time of greatest elongation for the companion. A comparison of the 2020 and 2024 data reveal no companion in 2020 (as expected) and the probable detection of a companion in 2024. The presumed stellar companion has an angular separation and position angle of 52 mas and $115^\circ$ east of north, respectively, which is in excellent agreement with predictions from dynamical considerations. The detected companion is roughly six magnitudes fainter than Betelgeuse at 466 nm.\bf{While this is only a 1.5$\sigma$ detection, the results are in reasonable agreement with the predictions: the appearance of the companion at quadrature; the angular separation from Betelgeuse; the position angle with respect to Betelgeuse; the magnitude difference; and the estimated mass of the companion.

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of fast radio bursts (FRBs), the brightest cosmic radio explosions, is still unknown. Bearing critical clues to FRBs' origin, the long-term evolution of FRBs has yet to be confirmed, since the field is still young and most FRBs were seen only once. Here we report clear evidence of decadal evolution of FRB~20121102A, the first precisely localized repeater. In conjunction with archival data, our FAST and GBT monitoring campaign since 2020 reveals a significant 7% decline of local dispersion measure (DM). The rotation measure (RM) of 30,755$\pm$16 $\mathrm{rad\,m^{-2}}$ detected in the last epoch represents a 70% decrease compared to that from December 2016. The $\sigma_{RM}$ parameter, which describes the complexity of the magneto-ionic environment surrounding the source, was shown to have decreased by 13%. These general trends reveal an evolving FRB environment, which could originate from an early-phase supernova associated with an enhanced pair wind from the FRB central engine.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent developments in the study of pulsar radio emission revealed that the microphysics of quantum electrodynamic (QED) pair cascades at pulsar polar caps may be responsible for generating the observed coherent radio waves. However, modeling the pair cascades in the polar cap region poses significant challenges, particularly under conditions of high plasma multiplicity. Traditional Particle-in-Cell (PIC) methods often face rapidly increasing computational costs as the multiplicity grows exponentially. To address this issue, we present a new simulation code using the Vlasov method, which efficiently simulates the evolution of charged particle distribution functions in phase space without a proportional increase in computational expense at high multiplicities. We apply this code to study $e^\pm$ pair cascades in 1D, incorporating key physical processes such as curvature radiation, radiative cooling, and magnetic pair production. We study both the Ruderman-Sutherland (RS) and the Space-charge-limited Flow (SCLF) regimes, and find quasiperiodic gap formation and pair production bursts in both cases. These features produce strong electric field oscillations, potentially enabling coherent low-frequency radio emission. We construct a unified analytic model that describes the key features of the polar cap cascade, which can be used to estimate the return current heating rate that can be used to inform X-ray hotspot models. Spectral analysis shows that a significant amount of energy is carried in superluminal modes -- collective excitations that could connect to observed radio features. Our results align with previous PIC studies while offering enhanced fidelity in both dense and rarefied regions.
#### SDSO1 is a Ghost Planetary Nebula Bow Shock in Front of M31

 - **Abstract**
 We present new, deep narrow band imagery and discuss the nature of SDSO1, the large [O III]-emitting nebula centered 1.5 degrees SE of M31. We find strong evidence to support the hypothesis that SDSO1 is unrelated to M31 and is instead a bow shock driven by a faded, giant (D = 20 pc), 400 kyr-old, ghost planetary nebula (GPN) expelled by the symbiotic WD binary star EG Andromedae. Because EG And lags the rotation of the Milky Way, its hypersonic velocity of 107 km/s drives a shock into the local interstellar medium. SDSO1 also sports a 45-pc long turbulent tail that crosses M31. We establish the shock-powered GPN phase as a new phase of PN evolution, and identify seven more candidate GPNe by their large size and shock-tail morphology. This includes several giant halos of younger planetary nebulae, possibly expelled by now degenerate binary companions. The interaction of an old, fast-moving GPN with the ISM generates a shock that remains visible long after the photoionized PN shell has faded below the limit of detectability. The SDSO1 GPN has reached a phase in its evolution where its outward expansion has been slowed considerably by the work it has done on the interstellar medium. Once the GPN outflow expends the rest of its kinetic energy, it will be stripped from EG And and mix into the surrounding ISM.

 - **Abstract**
 The intracluster medium (ICM), composed of hot plasma, dominates the baryonic content of galaxy clusters and is primarily observable in X-rays. Its thermodynamic properties, pressure, temperature, entropy, and electron density, offer crucial insight into the physical processes shaping clusters, from accretion and mergers to radiative cooling and feedback. We investigate the thermodynamic properties of galaxy clusters in the Simulating the LOcal Web (SLOW) constrained simulations, which reproduce the observed large-scale structure of the local Universe. We assess how well these simulations reproduce observed ICM profiles and explore the connection between cluster formation history and core classification. Three-dimensional thermodynamic profiles are extracted and compared to deprojected X-ray and Sunyaev - Zel'dovich (SZ) data for local clusters classified as solid cool-core (SCC), weakly cool-core (WCC), and non-cool-core (NCC) systems. We also examine the mass assembly history of the simulated counterparts to link their formation to present-day ICM properties. The simulations reproduce global thermodynamic profiles for clusters such as Perseus, Coma, A85, A119, A1644, A2029, A3158, and A3266. Moreover, they show that CC clusters typically assemble their mass earlier, while NCC systems grow through more extended, late-time merger-driven histories. WCC clusters show intermediate behavior, suggesting an evolutionary transition. Our results demonstrate that constrained simulations provide a powerful tool for linking cluster formation history to present-day ICM properties and point to possible refinements in subgrid physics as well as in resolution that could improve the agreement in cluster core regions.
