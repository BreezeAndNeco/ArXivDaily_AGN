 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the effect of dynamically coupling gas torques with gravitational wave (GW) emission during the orbital evolution of an equal-mass massive black hole binary (MBHB). We perform hydrodynamical simulations of eccentric MBHBs with total mass $M=10^6~{\rm M}_\odot$ embedded in a prograde locally isothermal circumbinary disk (CBD). We evolve the binary from $53$ to $30$ Schwarzschild radii separations using up to 2.5 post-Newtonian (PN) corrections to the binary dynamics, which allow us to follow the GW-driven in-spiral. For the first time, we report the measurement of gas torques onto a live binary a few years before the merger, with and without concurrent GW radiation. We also identify and measure a novel GW-gas coupling term in the in-spiral rate that makes gas effects an order of magnitude stronger than the gas-only contribution. We show that the evolution rate ($\dot a$) of the MBHB can be neatly expressed as the sum of the GW rate ($\dot a_{\rm GW}$), the pure gas-driven rate ($\dot a_{\rm gas}$), and their cross-term $\propto\dot a_{\rm GW}\dot a_{\rm gas}$. The source-frame gas-induced dephasing in the GW waveform is equivalent to losing $\sim0.5$ GW cycles over the expected $\sim1700$ cycles in a vacuum, which LISA should detect at redshift $z=1$. We also propose a phenomenological model that captures the essence of simulations and can be used to perform Bayesian inference. Our results show how GWs alone can be used to probe the astrophysical properties of CBDs and have important implications on multi-messenger strategies aimed at studying the environments of MBHBs.

 - **Abstract**
 The Milky Way's Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) is the largest concentration of dense molecular gas in the Galaxy, the structure of which is shaped by the complex interplay between Galactic-scale dynamics and extreme physical conditions. Understanding the 3-D geometry of this gas is crucial as it determines the locations of star formation and subsequent feedback. We present a catalogue of clouds in the CMZ using Herschel data. Using archival data from the APEX and MOPRA CMZ surveys, we measure averaged kinematic properties of the clouds at 1mm and 3mm. We use archival ATCA data of the H$_{2}$CO (1$_{1,0}$ - 1$_{1,1}$) 4.8 GHz line to search for absorption towards the clouds, and 4.85 GHz GBT C-band data to measure the radio continuum emission. We measure the absorption against the continuum to provide new constraints for the line-of-sight positions of the clouds relative to the Galactic centre, and find a highly asymmetric distribution, with most clouds residing in front of the Galactic centre. The results are compared with different orbital models, and we introduce a revised toy model of a vertically-oscillating closed elliptical orbit. We find that most models describe the PPV structure of the gas reasonably well, but find significant inconsistencies in all cases regarding the near vs. far placement of individual clouds. Our results highlight that the CMZ is likely more complex than can be captured by these simple geometric models, along with the need for new data to provide further constraints on the true 3-D structure of the CMZ.
#### 3-D CMZ IV: Distinguishing Near vs. Far Distances in the Galactic Center Using Spitzer and Herschel

 - **Abstract**
 A comprehensive 3-D model of the central 300 pc of the Milky Way, the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) is of fundamental importance in understanding energy cycles in galactic nuclei, since the 3-D structure influences the location and intensity of star formation, feedback, and black hole accretion. Current observational constraints are insufficient to distinguish between existing 3-D models. Dust extinction is one diagnostic tool that can help determine the location of dark molecular clouds relative to the bright Galactic Center emission. By combining Herschel and Spitzer observations, we developed three new dust extinction techniques to estimate the likely near/far locations for each cloud in the CMZ. We compare our results to four geometric CMZ orbital models. Our extinction methods show good agreement with each other, and with results from spectral line absorption analysis from Walker et al. (submitted). Our near/far results for CMZ clouds are inconsistent with a projected version of the Sofue (1995) two spiral arms model, and show disagreement in position-velocity space with the Molinari et al. (2011) closed elliptical orbit. Our results are in reasonable agreement with the Kruijssen et al. (2015) open streams. We find that a simplified toy-model elliptical orbit which conserves angular momentum shows promising fits in both position-position and position-velocity space. We conclude that all current CMZ orbital models lack the complexity needed to describe the motion of gas in the CMZ, and further work is needed to construct a complex orbital model to accurately describe gas flows in the CMZ.

 - **Abstract**
 Third-generation gravitational-wave detectors will observe up to millions of merging binary black holes. With such a vast dataset, stacking events into population analyses will arguably be more important than analyzing single sources. We present the first application of population-level Fisher-matrix forecasts tailored to third-generation gravitational-wave interferometers. We implement the formalism first derived by Gair et al. and explore how future experiments such as Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer will constrain the distributions of black-hole masses, spins, and redshift. Third-generation detectors will be transformative, improving constraints on the population hyperparameters by several orders of magnitude compared to current data. At the same time, we highlight that a single third-generation observatory and a network of detectors will deliver qualitatively similar performances. Obtaining precise measurements of some population features (e.g. peaks in the mass spectrum) will require only a few months of observations while others (e.g. the fraction of binaries with aligned spins) will instead require years if not decades. We argue population forecasts of this kind should be featured in white papers and feasibility studies aimed at developing the science case of future gravitational-wave interferometers.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a study of the abundance of calcium in the innermost disk of 70 T Tauri stars in the star-forming regions of Chamaeleon I, Lupus and Orion OB1b. We use calcium as a proxy for the refractory material that reaches the inner disk. We used magnetospheric accretion models to analyze the Ca II emission lines and estimate abundances in the accretion flows of the stars, which feed from the inner disks. We find Ca depletion in disks of all three star-forming regions, with 57% of the sample having [Ca/H] < -0.30 relative to the solar abundance. All disks with cavities and/or substructures show depletion, consistent with trapping of refractories in pressure bumps. Significant Ca depletion ([Ca/H] < -0.30) is also measured in 60% of full disks, although some of those disks may have hidden substructures or cavities. We find no correlation between Ca abundance and stellar or disk parameters except for the mass accretion rate onto the star. This could suggest that the inner and outer disks are decoupled, and that the mass accretion rate is related to a mass reservoir in the inner disk, while refractory depletion reflects phenomena in the outer disk related to the presence of structure and forming planets. Our results of refractory depletion and timescales for depletion are qualitatively consistent with expectations of dust growth and radial drift including partitioning of elements and constitute direct evidence that radial drift of solids locked in pebbles takes place in disks.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The Fred Young Submillimeter Telescope (FYST) line intensity mapping (LIM) survey will measure the power spectrum (PS) of the singly ionized carbon 158 $\rm \mu$m fine-structure line, [CII], to trace the appearance of the first galaxies that emerged during and right after the epoch of reionization (EoR, $6<z<9$). Aims. We aim to quantify the contamination of the (post-)EoR [CII] LIM signal by foreground carbon monoxide (CO) line emission ($3 < J_{ \rm up} < 12$) and assess the efficiency to retrieve this [CII] LIM signal by the targeted masking of bright CO emitters. Methods. Using the IllustrisTNG300 simulation, we produced mock CO intensity tomographies based on empirical star formation rate-to-CO luminosity relations. Combining these predictions with the [CII] PS predictions of the first paper of this series, we evaluated a masking technique where the interlopers are identified and masked using an external catalog whose properties are equivalent to those of a deep Euclid survey. Results. Prior to masking, our [CII] PS forecast is an order of magnitude lower than the predicted CO contamination in the 225 GHz ([CII] emitted at $z=6.8-8.3$) band of the FYST LIM survey, at the same level in its 280 GHz ([CII] emitted at $z=5.3-6.3$) and 350 GHz ([CII] emitted at $z=4.1-4.8$) bands, and an order of magnitude higher in its 410 GHz ([CII] emitted at $z=3.4-3.9$) band. For our fiducial model, the optimal masking depth is reached when less than 10\% of the survey volume is masked at 350 and 410 GHz but around 40\% at 280 GHz and 60 \% at 225 GHz. At these masking depths we anticipate a detection of the [CII] PS at 350 and 410 GHz, a tentative detection at 280 GHz, whereas at 225 GHz the CO signal still dominates our model. In the last case, alternative decontamination techniques will be needed.

 - **Abstract**
 The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) is the largest reservoir of dense molecular gas in the Galaxy and is heavily obscured in the optical and near-IR. We present an overview of the far-IR dust continuum, where the molecular clouds are revealed, provided by Herschel in the inner 40°($|l| <$ 20°) of the Milky Way with a particular focus on the CMZ. We report a total dense gas ($N$(H$_2$) $> 10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$) CMZ mass of M=$2\substack{+2 \\ -1} \times 10^7$ M$_{\odot}$ and confirm that there is a highly asymmetric distribution of dense gas, with about 70-75% at positive longitudes. We create and publicly release complete fore/background-subtracted column density and dust temperature maps in the inner 40°($|l| <$ 20°) of the Galaxy. We find that the CMZ clearly stands out as a distinct structure, with an average mass per longitude that is at least $3\times$ higher than the rest of the inner Galaxy contiguously from 1.8°$> \ell >$ -1.3°. This CMZ extent is larger than previously assumed, but is consistent with constraints from velocity information. The inner Galaxy's column density peaks towards the SgrB2 complex with a value of about 2 $\times$ 10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$, and typical CMZ molecular clouds are about N(H$_2$)=10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$. Typical CMZ dust temperatures range from about $12-35$ K with relatively little variation. We identify a ridge of warm dust in the inner CMZ that potentially traces the base of the northern Galactic outflow seen with MEERKAT.

 - **Abstract**
 Clustered stellar feedback creates expanding voids in the magnetized interstellar medium known as superbubbles. Although theory suggests that superbubble expansion is influenced by interstellar magnetic fields, direct observational data on 3D superbubble magnetic field geometry is limited. The Sun's location inside the Local Bubble provides a unique opportunity to infer a superbubble's 3D magnetic field orientation, under the assumptions that: $\mathrm{I}$) the Local Bubble's surface is the primary contributor to plane-of-the-sky polarization observations across much of the sky, and $\mathrm{II}$) the Local Bubble's magnetic field is tangent to its dust-traced shell. In this work, we validate these assumptions and construct a model of the Local Bubble's 3D B-field orientation from $\textit{Planck}$ 353 GHz polarization observations and a 3D-dust-derived model of the Local Bubble's shell. We test Assumption $\mathrm{I}$ by examining correlations between the Local Bubble's 3D geometry, dust polarization, and starlight polarization. We find that the Local Bubble likely dominates the polarized signal in the majority of lines of sight. We jointly test Assumptions $\mathrm{I}$ and $\mathrm{II}$ by applying our reconstruction method to a simulated superbubble, where we successfully reconstruct the 3D magnetic field orientation over the bulk of its surface. Finally, we use our 3D B-field model to infer the initial magnetic field orientation in the solar neighborhood prior to the Local Bubble's formation, and derive an orientation parallel to the present-day Local Arm of the galaxy. These findings provide new insights into the co-evolution of superbubbles and the magnetized interstellar medium.

 - **Abstract**
 The Canadian Automated Meteor Observatory (CAMO) mirror tracking system has been in operation since 2009 and has, to date, produced more than 20,000 two-station meteor observations at meter-level spatial and 10 ms temporal resolution. In 2020, a spectral tracking camera was added in parallel at one of the CAMO stations. To date, it has recorded the spectra of hundreds of faint meteors. Engineering testing from 2020-2023 resulted in the selection of a 150 lpmm grating and an EMCCD camera to achieve a spectral resolution of about 1 nm/pixel in the final configuration. The CAMO spectral system can resolve spectra from individual meteoroid fragments, record spectra for meteors of +2 peak magnitude to as faint as +4 in parts of the lightcurve and produce relative abundance estimates for Mg, Fe and Na. Our preliminary results also show identification of the H and K lines of CA(II). Meteors with strong iron lines were found to have unusual fragmentation behaviour, involving gross fragmentation rather than continuously shedding small particles. The spectra of individual fragments can be resolved in some cases, showing that these Fe-rich objects do not differ in composition among fragments. Our calibration procedure and hardware configuration are discussed together with preliminary results.
#### Sealing Europa's vents by vapor deposition: An order of magnitude study

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.17362

 - **Abstract**
 Fractures and vents in the ice crust of Europa, exposing the sub-surface ocean to the vacuum, might be responsible for the generation of planetary-scale water-vapor plumes. During its passage through the ice, the plume vapor is expected to partially condense on the walls, depositing until the vent is sealed. We develop a lumped-parameter model to analyze the sealing time scales. Neglecting all other possible mechanisms (water spillage, compression forces, etc.), we find shutting-off times compatible with the 7-hour plume observed in 2012 by the Hubble Space Telescope, suggesting that vapor deposition alone could have been responsible for sealing the vent. A map of sealing times vs. plume density, mass flow rate and aperture areas is given. Plume quantities from the literature are analyzed and compared to our results. For a given plume density/mass flow rate, small apertures would be sealed quickly by molecular deposition and are thus incompatible with observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Many modern radio telescopes employ an observational strategy that involves maximizing the use of their available spaces (cabins), outfitting them with various receivers at different frequencies to detect incoming signals from the sky simultaneously or individually. The Large Latin American Millimeter Array (LLAMA), is a joint venture between Argentina and Brazil consisting of the installation and operation of a 12-meter aperture Cassegrain telescope. It features three available cabins for instrumentation and plans to install six single-pixel heterodyne receivers, covering different bandwidths in the 30 to 950 GHz window of the electromagnetic spectrum, in its two lateral Nasmyth cabins at different phases of the project. Therefore, it is crucial not only to design a tertiary optical system that couples the antenna beam to those receivers, but also to do it in a scalable way. The primary goal for the design is to simultaneously maximize the antenna efficiency while minimizing optical aberrations for all receivers, both fundamental aspects for the optimal functioning of cutting-edge astronomical instruments. In this paper, we present the entire design process, starting from the quasi-optical approach based on the propagation of a fundamental Gaussian beam mode, continuing with the validation of the design based on physical optics simulations, and ending with a tolerance analysis of the system. As a result of this process, a frequency independent tertiary optical system has been achieved for almost all the receivers, which is expected to provide high optical performance for the radio telescope.
#### ATOMS: ALMA three-millimeter observations of massive star-forming regions -- XVIII. On the origin and evolution of dense gas fragments in molecular shells of compact HII regions

 - **Abstract**
 Fragmentation and evolution for the molecular shells of the compact HII regions are less explored compared to their evolved counterparts. We map nine compact HII regions with a typical diameter of 0.4 pc that are surrounded by molecular shells traced by CCH. Several to a dozen dense gas fragments probed by H13CO+ are embedded in these molecular shells. These gas fragments, strongly affected by the HII region, have a higher surface density, mass, and turbulence than those outside the shells but within the same pc-scale natal clump. These features suggest that the shells swept up by the early HII regions can enhance the formation of massive dense structures that may host the birth of higher-mass stars. We examine the formation of fragments and find that fragmentation of the swept-up shell is unlikely to occur in these early HII regions, by comparing the expected time scale of shell fragmentation with the age of HII region. We propose that the appearance of gas fragments in these shells is probably the result of sweeping up pre-existing fragments into the molecular shell that has not yet fragmented. Taken together, this work provides a basis for understanding the interplay of star-forming sites with an intricate environment containing ionization feedback such as those observed in starburst regions.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a series of 9 Doppler images of the magnetically active K component of the RS CVn-type binary SZ Psc, based on the high-resolution spectroscopic data collected from 2014 to 2018. We apply least-squares deconvolution to all spectra to extract the average profiles with high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) for Doppler imaging. The surface maps of the K subgiant show starspots widely distributed along latitude and longitude. A prominent, non-axisymmetric polar spot around phase 0 is revealed by all images with sufficient phase coverage, which may be a stable feature on the K component. The starspots evolve in a time scale of one month. We have determined the surface shear rate of the K component from the starspot maps reconstructed 10 days apart in 2017 Nov--Dec, through the cross-correlation method. The surface differential rotation parameters are $\Omega_{eq} = 1.591 \pm 0.002$ rad d$^{-1}$ and $\Delta \Omega = 0.035 \pm 0.003$ rad d$^{-1}$. The absorption lines contributed from the tertiary component are detected in all LSD profiles of SZ Psc, and we measure the radial velocity of the binary system and the tertiary component to derive an elliptical orbit with a period of $1530 \pm 3$ days and a mass of $0.75 \pm 0.06$ M$\odot$ for the tertiary component.

 - **Abstract**
 The recently detected extended, very-high-energy gamma-ray emission from the microquasar V4641 Sgr reveals a puzzling 200-parsec-long jet-like structure significantly misaligned with its radio jet. We propose that this gamma-ray structure is produced by high-energy cosmic-ray particles escaping from the microquasar along ordered field lines of the Galactic Magnetic Field and interacting with the interstellar medium. We show that if the gamma-ray emission is produced by interactions of high-energy cosmic ray nuclei, the system is detectable by future multi-km3 neutrino detectors. We argue that gamma-ray observations of jet-like features adjacent to high-energy sources in the Milky Way provide a new method to measure the regular and turbulent components of the Galactic magnetic field at different locations in the Milky Way.

#### Constraining the CSM structure and progenitor mass-loss history of interacting supernovae through 3D hydrodynamic modeling: The case of SN 2014C

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate SN 2014C using three-dimensional hydrodynamic modeling, focusing on its early interaction with dense circumstellar medium (CSM). Our objective is to uncover the pre-supernova (SN) CSM structure and constrain the progenitor star's mass-loss history prior to core collapse. Our comprehensive model traces the evolution from the progenitor star through the SN event and into the SN remnant (SNR) phase. We simulate the remnant's expansion over approximately 15 years, incorporating a CSM derived from the progenitor star's outflows through dedicated hydrodynamic simulations. Analysis reveals that the remnant interacted with a dense toroidal nebula extending from $4.3\times 10^{16}\,$cm to $1.5\times 10^{17}$ cm in the equatorial plane, with a thickness of approximately $1.2\times 10^{17}$ cm. The nebula's density peaks at approximately $3\times 10^6\,$cm$^{-3}$ at the inner boundary, gradually decreasing as $\approx r^{-2}$ at greater distances. This nebula formed due to intense mass-loss from the progenitor star between approximately 5000 and 1000 years before collapse. During this period, the maximum mass-loss rate reached about $8\times 10^{-4}\,M_{\odot}\,$yr$^{-1}$, ejecting $\approx 2.5\,M_{\odot}$ of stellar material into the CSM. Our model accurately reproduces Chandra and NuSTAR spectra, including the Fe K line, throughout the remnant's evolution. Notably, the Fe line is self-consistently reproduced, originating from shocked ejecta, with $\approx 0.05\,M_{\odot}$ of pure-Fe ejecta shocked during the remnant-nebula interaction. These findings suggest that the 3D geometry and density distribution of the CSM, as well as the progenitor star's mass-loss history, align with a scenario where the star was stripped through binary interaction, specifically common envelope evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Although ultraluminous X-ray pulsars (ULXPs) are believed to be powered by super-Eddington accretion onto a magnetized neutron star (NS), the detailed structures of the inflow-outflow and magnetic fields are still not well understood. We perform general relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamics (GR-RMHD) simulations of super-Eddington accretion flows onto a magnetized NS with dipole and/or quadrupole magnetic fields. Our results show that an accretion disk and optically thick outflows form outside the magnetospheric radius, while inflows aligned with magnetic field lines appear inside. When the dipole field is more prominent than the quadrupole field at the magnetospheric radius, accretion columns form near the magnetic poles, whereas a quadrupole magnetic field stronger than the dipole field results in the formation of a belt-like accretion flow near the equatorial plane. The NS spins up as the angular momentum of the accreting gas is converted into the angular momentum of the electromagnetic field, which then flows into the NS. Even if an accretion column forms near one of the magnetic poles, the observed luminosity is almost the same on both sides with the accretion column and the side without it because the radiation energy is transported to both sides through scattering. Our model suggests that galactic ULXP, Swift J0243.6+6124, has a quadrupole magnetic field of $2\times10^{13}~{\rm G}$ and a dipole magnetic field of less than $4\times10^{12}~{\rm G}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Warm Saturn type exoplanets orbiting M-dwarfs are particularly suitable for in-depth cloud characterisation through transmission spectroscopy due to their favourable stellar to planetary radius contrast. However, modelling cloud formation consistently within the 3D atmosphere remains computationally challenging. The aim is to explore the combined atmospheric and micro-physical cloud structure, and the kinetic gas-phase chemistry for the warm Saturn HATS0-6b orbiting an M-dwarf. A combined 3D cloudy atmosphere model is constructed by iteratively executing the 3D General Circulation Model (GCM) expeRT/MITgcm and a kinetic cloud formation model, each in its full complexity. Resulting cloud particle number densities, sizes, and compositions are used to derive the local cloud opacity which is then utilised in the next GCM iteration. The disequilibrium H/C/O/N gas-phase chemistry is calculated for each iteration to assess the resulting transmission spectrum in post-processing. The cloud opacity feedback causes a temperature inversion at the sub-stellar point and at the evening terminator at gas pressures higher than 0.01 bar. Furthermore, clouds cool the atmosphere between 0.01 bar and 10 bar, and narrow the equatorial wind jet. The transmission spectrum shows muted gas-phase absorption and a cloud particle silicate feature at approximately 10 micron. The combined atmosphere-cloud model retains the full physical complexity of each component and therefore enables a detailed physical interpretation with JWST NIRSpec and MIRI LRS observational accuracy. The model shows that warm Saturn type exoplanets around M-dwarfs are ideal candidates to search for limb asymmetries in clouds and chemistry, identify cloud particle composition by observing their spectral features, and identify the cloud-induced strong thermal inversion that arises on these planets specifically.

 - **Abstract**
 II Zw 40 is a starburst dwarf and merger product, and holds a radio-infrared supernebula excited by thousands of embedded OB stars. We present here observations of three aspects of the supernebula: maps of the K and KU radio continuum that trace dense ionized gas with spatial resolution $\sim0.1^{\prime\prime}$, a spectral data cube of the [S IV]$10.5\mu$m emission line that measures the kinematics of the ionized gas with velocity resolution $4.5$ km s$^{-1}$, and an ALMA spectral cube of the CO(3-2) line that probes the dense warm molecular gas with spatial and velocity resolution comparable to the ionized gas. The observations suggest that the supernebula is the overlap,collision or merger of two star clusters, each associated with an elongated molecular cloud. We accordingly modelled the supernebula with simulations of colliding clusters. The model that best agrees with the data is a grazing collision that has distorted the gas and stars to create the distinctive structures observed. These models may have wide applicability in the cluster-rich regions of young starbursts.

 - **Abstract**
 We develop a parametrised model to describe the formation and evolution of massive black holes, designed for comparisons with both electromagnetic and gravitational wave observations. Using an extended Press-Schechter formalism, we generate dark matter halo merger trees. We then seed and evolve massive black holes through parameterised prescriptions. This approach, which avoids solving differential equations, is computationally efficient, enabling us to analyse observational data and infer the parameters of our model in a fully Bayesian framework. We find that observations of the black hole luminosity function are compatible with the nHz gravitational wave signal (likely) measured by PTAs, provided we allow for an increased luminosity function at high redshift ($4-7$), as recently suggested by JWST observations. Our model can simultaneously reproduce the bulk of the $M_*-M_{\rm BH}$ relation at $z-0$, as well as its outliers, something cosmological simulations struggle to do. The inferred model parameters are consistent with expectations from observations and more complex simulations: They favour heavier black hole seeds and short delays between halo and black hole mergers, while requiring supper-Edington accretion episodes lasting a few tens of million years, which in our model are linked to galaxy mergers. We find accretion to be suppressed in the most massive black holes below $z\simeq 2.5$, consistently with the anti-hierarchical growth hypothesis. Finally, our predictions for LISA, although fairly broad, are in agreement with previous models. Our model offers a new perspective on the apparent tensions between the black hole luminosity function and the latest JWST and PTA results. Its flexibility makes it ideal to fully exploit the potential of future gravitational wave observations of massive black hole binaries with LISA.

 - **Abstract**
 At the sub-stellar boundary, signatures of magnetic fields begin to manifest at radio wavelengths, analogous to the auroral emission of the magnetised solar system planets. This emission provides a singular avenue for measuring magnetic fields at planetary scales in extrasolar systems. So far, exoplanets have eluded detection at radio wavelengths. However, ultracool dwarfs (UCDs), their higher mass counterparts, have been detected for over two decades in the radio. Given their similar characteristics to massive exoplanets, UCDs are ideal targets to bridge our understanding of magnetic field generation from stars to planets. In this work, we develop a new tomographic technique for inverting both the viewing angle and large-scale magnetic field structure of UCDs from observations of coherent radio bursts. We apply our methodology to the nearby T8 dwarf WISE J062309.94-045624.6 (J0623) which was recently detected at radio wavelengths, and show that it is likely viewed pole-on. We also find that J0623's rotation and magnetic axes are misaligned significantly, reminiscent of Uranus and Neptune, and show that it may be undergoing a magnetic cycle with a period exceeding 6 months in duration. These findings demonstrate that our method is a robust new tool for studying magnetic fields on planetary-mass objects. With the advent of next-generation low-frequency radio facilities, the methods presented here could facilitate the characterisation of exoplanetary magnetospheres for the first time.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic voids, distinguished by their low-density environment, provide a unique opportunity to explore the interplay between the cosmic environment and the processes of galaxy formation and evolution. Data on the molecular gas has been scarce so far. In this paper, we continue previous research done in the CO-CAVITY pilot project to study the molecular gas content and properties in void galaxies to search for possible differences compared to galaxies that inhabit denser structures. We observed at the IRAM 30 m telescope the CO(1-0) and CO(2-1) emission of 106 void galaxies selected from the CAVITY survey. Together with data from the literature, we obtained a sample of 200 void galaxies with CO data. We conducted a comprehensive comparison of the specific star formation rate (sSFR = SFR/M$_*$), the molecular gas fraction (MH$_2$/M$_*$), and the star formation efficiency (SFE = SFR/MH$_2$) between the void galaxies and a comparison sample of galaxies in filaments and walls, selected from the xCOLD GASS survey. We found no statistically significant difference between void galaxies and the comparison sample in the molecular gas fraction as a function of stellar mass for galaxies on the star-forming main sequence (SFMS). However, for void galaxies, the SFE was found to be constant across all stellar mass bins, while there is a decreasing trend with M$_*$ for the comparison sample. Finally, we found some indications for a smaller dynamical range in the molecular gas fraction as a function of distance to the SFMS in void galaxies. Overall, our analysis finds that the molecular gas properties of void galaxies are not very different from denser environments. The physical origin of the most significant difference that we found - a constant SFE as a function of stellar mass in void galaxies - is unclear and requires further investigation and higher-resolution data.
#### The physical properties of Cluster Chains

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the kinematics and star formation history of the Scorpius Centaurus (Sco-Cen) OB association following the initial identification of sequential, linearly aligned chains of clusters. Building upon our characterization of the Corona Australis (CrA) chain, we now analyze two additional major cluster chains that exhibit similar characteristics: the Lower Centaurus Crux (LCC) and Upper Scorpius (Upper Sco) chains. All three cluster chains display distinct sequential patterns in 1) the 3D spatial distribution, 2) age, 3) velocity, and 4) mass. The Upper-Sco chain is the most massive and complex cluster chain, possibly consisting of two or more overlapping subchains. We discuss the possible formation of cluster chains and argue for a scenario where feedback from the most massive star formation episode 15 Myr ago initiated the formation of these spatio-temporal cluster sequences. Our results identify cluster chains as a distinct type of stellar structure with well-defined physical properties, formed in environments capable of sustaining stellar feedback over timescales of 5-10 Myr. We find that around 40% of the stellar population in Sco-Cen formed due to triggered star formation, with 35% forming along the three cluster chains. We conclude that cluster chains could be common structures in OB associations, particularly in regions that have similar natal environments as Sco-Cen. Beyond their significance for star formation and stellar feedback, they appear to be promising laboratories for chemical enrichment and the transport of elements from one generation to the next in the same star-forming region.
