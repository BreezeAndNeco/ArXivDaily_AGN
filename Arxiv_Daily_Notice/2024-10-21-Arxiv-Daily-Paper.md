 - **Abstract**
 Fast, massive winds are ubiquitously observed in the UV and X-ray spectra of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and other accreting sources. Theoretical and observational evidences suggest they are launched at accretion disc scales, carrying significant mass and angular momentum. Thanks to such high energy output, they may play an important role in transferring the accretion energy to the surrounding environment. In the case of AGNs, this process can help setting the so-called coevolution between the AGN and its host galaxy. To precisely assess the effective role of these winds, it is necessary to accurately measure their properties, including mass and energy rates. We aim to maximise the scientific return of current and future observations by improving the theoretical modelling of these winds through our Winds in the Ionised Nuclear Environment (WINE) model. WINE is a spectroscopic model designed for disc winds in AGNs and compact accreting sources, which couples photoionisation and radiative transfer with special relativistic effects and a three-dimensional model of the emission profiles. We explore with WINE the main spectral features associated to AGN disc winds, with particular emphasis on the detectability of the wind emission. We simulate observations with the X-ray microcalorimeters Resolve on board the XRISM satellite and the future Athena's X-IFU for the typical properties and exposure times of the sources in the XRISM Performance Verification phase. The wind kinematic, geometry, ionisation and column density deeply affect shape and strength of the spectral features. Thanks to this, both Resolve and X-IFU will be able to accurately constrain the main properties of disc winds in a broad range of parameters. We also find a dramatic difference in the gas opacity when using a soft, Narrow Line Seyfert 1-like SED compared to a canonical powerlaw SED with spectral index Gamma=2.

 - **Abstract**
 We study stellar core growth in simulations of merging massive ($M_\star>10^{11}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$) elliptical galaxies by a supermassive black hole (SMBH) displaced by gravitational wave induced recoil velocity. With controlled, dense sampling of the SMBH recoil velocity, we find the core radius originally formed by SMBH binary scouring can grow by a factor of 2-3 when the recoil velocity exceeds $\sim50$ per cent of the central escape velocity, and the mass deficit grows by up to a factor of $\sim4$. Using Bayesian inference we predict the distribution of stellar core sizes formed through this process to peak at $\sim1\,\mathrm{kpc}$. An orbital decomposition of stellar particles within the core reveals that radial orbits dominate over tube orbits when the recoil velocity exceeds the velocity dispersion of the core, whereas tube orbits dominate for the lowest recoil kicks. A change in orbital structure is reflected in the anisotropy parameter, with a central tangential bias present only for recoil velocities less than the local stellar velocity dispersion. Emulating current integral field unit observations of the stellar line-of-sight velocity distribution, we uncover a distinct signature in the Gauss-Hermite symmetric deviation coefficient $h_4$ that uniquely constrains the core size due to binary scouring. This signature is insensitive to the later evolution of the stellar mass distribution due to SMBH recoil. Our results provide a novel method to estimate the SMBH recoil magnitude from observations of local elliptical galaxies, and implies these galaxies primarily experienced recoil velocities less than the stellar velocity dispersion of the core.
#### The redshift evolution of the $M_{\rm BH}-M_*$ scaling relation: new insights from cosmological simulations and semi-analytic models

 - **Abstract**
 We study the co-evolution of black holes (BHs) and their host galaxies in the ASTRID and Illustris-TNG300 cosmological simulations and the Dark Sage Semi-Analytic Model (SAM), focusing on the evolution of the BH mass - stellar mass ($M_{\rm BH}-M_*$) relation. Due to differences in the adopted sub-grid modeling of BH seeding, dynamics, and feedback, the models differ in their predicted redshift evolution of the $M_{\rm BH}-M_*$ relation. We find that it is the interplay between the star formation rate (SFR) and the black hole accretion rate (BHAR) which drives the evolution of the mean relation. We define a quantity $\mathcal{R}$, the ratio between the specific BHAR and SFR (i.e. $\mathcal{R} \equiv\ $sBHAR/sSFR), and demonstrate that it is $\mathcal{R}$ that governs the evolution of individual sources in the $M_{\rm BH}-M_*$ plane. The efficiency of BH growth versus stellar mass growth in the sSFR-sBHAR plane reflects the partitioning of gas between fueling star formation versus BH accretion. This partitioning depends on the implementation of BH dynamics and the nature of how AGN feedback quenches galaxies. In the cosmological simulations (ASTRID and Illustris-TNG300), the BHAR and SFR are intrinsically linked, resulting in a tight $M_{\rm BH}-M_*$ correlation, while the Dark Sage SAM produces a significantly larger scatter. We discuss these results in the context of recently discovered over-massive BHs and massive quenched galaxies at high redshift by the James Webb Space Telescope.

 - **Abstract**
 The emission lines from ionized nebulae allow us to determine their physical and chemical properties, along with the interstellar extinction. "pyEQUIB" is a pure Python open-source package including several application programming interface (API) functions that can be employed for plasma diagnostics, abundance analysis of collisionally excited lines (CEL) and recombination lines (RL) in nebular astrophysics, and extinction analysis of Balmer lines. This package implements the IDL library "proEQUIB" in Python and couples it with the "AtomNeb" Python package. This package relies on the Python packages NumPy and SciPy. The API functions of this package can be used for studies of ionized nebulae by astronomers who are familiar with the high-level, general-purpose programming language Python.
#### Atomic and molecular gas as traced by [C II] emission

 - **Abstract**
 The latest ALMA and JWST observations provide new information on the birth and evolution of galaxies in the early Universe, at the epoch of reionization. Of particular importance are measurements at redshift $ z > 5$ of their cold-gas budget, which is known to be the main fuel for star formation. A powerful tool for probing the physics characterising galaxies at high redshift is the \CII\ $158\,\rm \mu m$ emission line. Due to its low excitation potential, \CII\ emission can be produced in photodissociation regions, neutral atomic gas and molecular clouds. To properly capture the cold-gas processes taking place in such environments (molecule formation, self-shielding, dust grain catalysis, photoelectric and cosmic-ray heating), we make use of a new set of state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations (\coldsim) including time-dependent non-equilibrium chemistry, star formation, stellar evolution, metal spreading and feedback mechanisms. We are able to accurately track the evolution of \HI, \HII\ and H$_2$ in a cosmological context and predict the contribution of each gas phase to \CII\ luminosity. We provide formulas that can be used to estimate the mass of molecular and atomic gas from \CII\ detections. Furthermore, we analyse how conversion factors evolve with galactic properties, such as stellar metallicity, star formation rate and stellar mass. We demonstrate that \CII\ emission is dominated by \HI\ gas and most of the \CII\ luminosity is generated in warm, dense star-forming regions. Importantly, we conclude that, despite \CII\ tracing predominantly atomic rather than molecular gas, the \CII\ luminosity remains a robust indicator of the H$_2$ mass.

 - **Abstract**
 Quasar feedback may play a key role in the evolution of massive galaxies. The dust-reddened quasar, F2M110648.35$+$480712 at $z = 0.4352$ is one of the few cases at its redshift that exhibits powerful quasar feedback through bipolar outflows. Our new observation with the integral field unit mode of Near-infrared Spectrograph onboard JWST opens a new window to examine this spectacular outflow through Pa$\alpha$ emission line with $\sim$3$\times$ better spatial resolution than previous work. The morphology and kinematics of the Pa$\alpha$ nebula confirm the existence of a bipolar outflow extending on a scale of $\sim$17$\times$14 kpc and with a velocity reaching $\sim$1100 km s$^{-1}$. The higher spatial resolution of our new observation leads to more reliable measurements of outflow kinematics. Considering only the spatially resolved outflow and assuming an electron density of 100 cm$^{-2}$, the mass, momentum and kinetic energy outflow rates are $\sim$50-210 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, $\sim$0.3-1.7$\times$10$^{36}$ dynes ($\sim$14-78\% of the quasar photon momentum flux) and $\sim$0.16-1.27$\times$10$^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ ($\sim$0.02-0.20\% of the quasar bolometric luminosity), respectively. The local instantaneous outflow rates generally decrease radially. We infer that the quasar is powerful enough to drive the outflow, while stellar processes cannot be overlooked as a contributing energy source. The mass outflow rate is $\sim$0.4-1.5 times the star formation rate, and the ratio of kinetic energy outflow rate to the quasar bolometric luminosity is comparable to the minimum value required for negative quasar feedback in simulations. This outflow may help regulate the star formation activity within the system to some extent.

 - **Abstract**
 Gaia is an astrometric space experiment that is measuring positions, proper motions as well as parallaxes for a huge number of stars. It operates a medium-dispersion spectrometer, the RVS, that provides spectra and thus radial velocity time-series. The paper is centred on the analysis of the RV time-series. We try to fit orbital and trend models and restrict ourselves to the objects of spectral types F-G-K brighter than magnitude 12 presenting only one single spectrum (SB1). Suitable time-series are processed and analysed object per object, providing orbital or trend solutions. The results of the various fits are further filtered on the basis of several quality measures in order to discard spurious solutions. The objects only having a spectroscopic solution are classified in one of the three classes SB1 (eccentric model), SB1C (circular model) or TrendSB1 (mere trend model). We detail the methods used and describe the derived parameters and results. After a description of the models considered, and of the related quality tests of the fit, we detail the internal filtering that is intended to reject bad solutions. We also present a full validation of the pipeline. A description of the current content of the catalogue is provided. We present the SB1, SB1C and the TrendSB1 spectroscopic solutions contained in the SB-subcatalogue which is part of the DR3 catalogue. We delivered some 181327 orbital solutions in the class SB1, 202 in the class SB1C and 56808 in the associated class TrendSB1. This is a first release and the delivered SB-subcatalogue could be tuned and refined. However the majority of the entries are correct; this data set constitutes by far the largest set of spectroscopic orbital solutions ever constituted.
#### Quokka-based understanding of outflows (QED) -- II. X-ray metallicity gradients as a signature of galactic wind metal loading

 - **Abstract**
 Supernova-driven galactic outflows play a vital but still poorly-understood role in galactic chemical evolution, and one of the largest uncertainties about them is the extent to which they consist of supernova ejecta that are unmixed, or only poorly-mixed, with the remainder of the interstellar medium (ISM). Simulations of wind launching make a range of predictions about the extent of mixing between the wind and the ISM, but thus far these have proven challenging to test observationally. In this study, we post-process high-resolution simulations of outflows from the QED simulation suite to generate synthetic X-ray spectra from galactic winds, which we then analyse using standard observational procedures, in order to search for detectable markers of wind mixing. Our synthetic observations reveal that partially-mixed winds show significant and detectable metallicity gradients when viewed edge-on, with metallicity decreasing away from the central galactic disc. We explore how this signature results from imperfect mixing and the extent to which measurements of it can be used to diagnose the level of mixing in winds. We determine the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) requirements for such measurements to be reliable, and provide a simple quantitative model that can be used to connect metallicity gradients to mixing between the hot ($T>10^{6}$ K) and cold ($T<10^{4}$ K) phases in observations that reach the required SNR, providing a framework to interpret current and future observations.

 - **Abstract**
 According to CMB measurements, baryonic matter constitutes about $5\%$ of the mass-energy density of the universe. A significant population of these baryons, for a long time referred to as `missing', resides in a low density, warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) outside galaxy clusters, tracing the ``cosmic web'', a network of large scale dark matter filaments. Various studies have detected this inter-cluster gas, both by stacking and by observing individual filaments in compact, massive systems. In this paper, we study short filaments (< 10 Mpc) connecting massive clusters ($M_{500} \approx 3\times 10^{14} M_{\odot}$) detected by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) using the scattering of CMB light off the ionised gas, a phenomenon known as the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) effect. The first part of this work is a search for suitable candidates for high resolution follow-up tSZ observations. We identify four cluster pairs with an intercluster signal above the noise floor (S/N $>$ 2), including two with a tentative $>2\sigma$ statistical significance for an intercluster bridge from the ACT data alone. In the second part of this work, starting from the same cluster sample, we directly stack on ${\sim}100$ cluster pairs and observe an excess SZ signal between the stacked clusters of $y=(7.2^{+2.3}_{-2.5})\times 10^{-7}$ with a significance of $3.3\sigma$. It is the first tSZ measurement of hot gas between clusters in this range of masses at moderate redshift ($\langle z\rangle\approx 0.5$). We compare this to the signal from simulated cluster pairs with similar redshifts and separations in the THE300 and MAGNETICUM Pathfinder cosmological simulations and find broad consistency. Additionally, we show that our measurement is consistent with scaling relations between filament parameters and mass of the embedded halos identified in simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 Planet formation encompasses processes that span a remarkable 40 magnitudes in mass, ranging from collisions between micron-sized grains inherit from the ISM to accretion of gas by giant planets. The planet formation process takes place in the interior of dusty disks, which offer us only limited observational constraints. Historically, the two main paradigms describing planet formation are the disk instability and core accretion models. In the former giant planets condense directly form a disk massive enough to fragments under its self-gravity. In contrast, the core accretion model follows a bottom-up approach driven by solids. This model includes the direct growth phase, where pebble and possibly planetesimal sized bodies form by surface-driven processes. Alternatively, planetesimal bodies can emerge from instabilities in the solid population, leading to the formation of clumps that ultimately collapse. The later growth phases of the core accretion model involve the creation of a protoplanet out of the planetesimal population, which then accrete smaller bodies|planetesimals or pebbles|before ultimately accreting freely the gas of the disk. In this Chapter I will review these formation mechanisms, aiming, where possible, to build an intuitive understanding from elementary physical principles.
#### Reversals of toroidal magnetic field in local shearing box simulations of accretion disc with a hot corona

 - **Abstract**
 Presence of a hot corona above the accretion disc can have important consequences for the evolution of magnetic fields and the Shakura-Sunyaev (SS) viscosity parameter $\alpha$ in such a strongly coupled system. In this work, we have performed three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical shearing-box numerical simulations of accretion disc with a hot corona above the cool disc. Such a two-layer, piece-wise isothermal system is vertically stratified under linear gravity and initial conditions here include a strong azimuthal magnetic field with a ratio between the thermal and magnetic pressures being of order unity in the disc region. Instabilities in this magnetized system lead to the generation of turbulence, which, in turn, governs the further evolution of magnetic fields in a self-sustaining manner. Remarkably, the mean toroidal magnetic field undergoes a complete reversal in time by changing its sign, and it is predominantly confined within the disc. This is a rather unique class of evolution of the magnetic field which has not been reported earlier. Solutions of mean magnetic fields here are thus qualitatively different from the vertically migrating dynamo waves that are commonly seen in previous works which model a single layer of an isothermal gas. Effective $\alpha$ is found to have values between 0.01 and 0.03. We have also made a comparison between models with Smagorinsky and explicit schemes for the kinematic viscosity ($\nu$). In some cases with an explicit $\nu$ we find a burst-like temporal behavior in $\alpha$.
#### X-ray Spectroscopy of the Dwarf Nova Z Chamaeleontis in Quiescence and Outburst Using the XMM-Newton Observatory

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.14526

 - **Abstract**
 We present X-ray spectroscopy of the SU UMa-type dwarf nova (DN) Z Cha using the EPIC and RGS instruments onboard the XMM-Newton Observatory. The quiescent system can be modeled by collisional equilibrium or nonequilibrium plasma models, yielding a kT of 8.2-13.0 keV at a luminosity of (5.0-6.0)$\times$10$^{30}$ erg/s. The spectra yield better reduced $\chi^{2}$ using partial covering absorbers of cold and photoionized nature. The ionized absorber has an equivalent N$_H$=(3.4-5.9)$\times$10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ and a log($\xi$)=3.5-3.7 with (50-60)% covering fraction when VNEI model (XSPEC) is used. The line diagnosis in quiescence shows no resonance lines with only detected forbidden lines of Ne, Mg, Si. The H-like C, O, Ne, and Mg are detected. The strongest line is O VIII with (2.7-4.6)$\times$10$^{-14}$ erg/s/cm$^2$. The quiescent X-ray emitting plasma is not collisional and not in ionization equilibrium which is consistent with hot ADAF-like accretion flows. The line diagnosis in outburst shows He-like O, and Ne with intercombination lines being the strongest along with weaker resonance lines. This indicates the plasma is more collisional and denser, but yet not in a collisional equilibrium, revealing ionization timescales of (0.97-1.4)$\times$10$^{11}$ s cm$^{-3}$. The R-ratios in outburst yield electron densities of (7-90)$\times$10$^{11}$ cm$^{-3}$ and the G-ratios yield electron temperatures of (2-3)$\times$10$^{6}$ K. The outburst luminosity is (1.4-2.5)$\times$10$^{30}$ erg/s. The flow is inhomogeneous in density. All detected lines are narrow with widths limited by the resolution of RGS yielding Keplerian rotational velocities $<$1000 km/s. This is too low for boundary layers, consistent with the nature of ADAF-like hot flows.
#### Galaxy-galaxy strong lensing cross-section with fuzzy dark matter model

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.14543

 - **Abstract**
 The galaxy-galaxy strong lensing (GGSL) cross-section in observed galaxy clusters has been reported to be more than an order of magnitude higher than the theoretical prediction by the standard cold dark matter (CDM) model. In this study, we focus on the fuzzy dark matter (FDM) model and study the GGSL cross-section numerically and analytically. We find that FDM subhalos can produce larger cross-sections than the CDM subhalos due to the presence of the soliton core. The maximum cross-section is obtained when the core radius is about the same as the size of the critical curve. The peak ratio of the cross-sections between the FDM subhalos and the CDM subhalos is about two when including the baryon distribution, indicating that the FDM with any masses might not produce the expected observed cross-section.

 - **Abstract**
 It is shown that the data from the orbital period decay of binary pulsars give strong constraints on the dark matter-nucleons cross section. The limits are robust and competitive because this new method for testing dark matter interactions with standard model particles has a minimal number of assumptions combined with the extremely high accuracy on the measurement of the decay rate of the orbital period of binary systems. Our results exclude (with 95% confidence) spin independent interactions with cross sections greater that 3.1x10-31 cm2 for a dark matter particle with mass mc2 = 1 keV and 3.7x10-31 cm2 for mc2= 1 TeV which improves by several orders of magnitude previous constraints.

 - **Abstract**
 Quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) are often observed in flare emissions. While these may reveal much about the time-dependent reconnection involved in flare energy release, the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. In this paper, we use 2D magnetohydrodynamic simulations to investigate the magnetic reconnection in two merging flux ropes, focusing on the effects of the resistivity on the time variation of the reconnection. We consider both uniform resistivity and current-dependent anomalous resistivity profiles. Our findings reveal that resistivity plays a critical role in controlling the reconnection dynamics, including reconnection rate oscillations and the rate of decay of the reconnection rate. Resistivity also influences the oscillations in emitted gyrosynchrotron radiation. However, in contrast to this strong influence of resistivity on reconnection rates, we observed a different behaviour for the emitted waves, whose frequencies are almost independent of resistivity variations.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutron star properties depend on both nuclear physics and astrophysical processes, and thus observations of neutron stars offer constraints on both large-scale astrophysics and the behavior of cold, dense matter. In this study, we use astronomical data to jointly infer the universal equation of state of dense matter along with two distinct astrophysical populations: Galactic neutron stars observed electromagnetically and merging neutron stars in binaries observed with gravitational waves. We place constraints on neutron star properties and quantify the extent to which they are attributable to macrophysics or microphysics. We confirm previous results indicating that the Galactic and merging neutron stars have distinct mass distributions. The inferred maximum mass of both Galactic neutron stars, $M_{\rm pop, EM}=2.05^{+0.11}_{-0.06}\,M_{\odot}$ (median and 90\% symmetric credible interval), and merging neutron star binaries, $M_{\rm pop, GW}=1.85^{+0.39}_{-0.16}\,M_{\odot}$, are consistent with the maximum mass of nonrotating neutron stars set by nuclear physics, $M_{\rm TOV} =2.28^{+0.41}_{-0.21}\,M_\odot$. The radius of a $1.4\,M_{\odot}$ neutron star is $12.2^{+0.8}_{-0.9}\,$km, consistent with, though $\sim 20\%$ tighter than, previous results using an identical equation of state model. Even though observed Galactic and merging neutron stars originate from populations with distinct properties, there is currently no evidence that astrophysical processes cannot produce neutron stars up to the maximum value imposed by nuclear physics.
#### syren-new: Precise formulae for the linear and nonlinear matter power spectra with massive neutrinos and dynamical dark energy

 - **Abstract**
 Current and future large scale structure surveys aim to constrain the neutrino mass and the equation of state of dark energy. We aim to construct accurate and interpretable symbolic approximations to the linear and nonlinear matter power spectra as a function of cosmological parameters in extended $\Lambda$CDM models which contain massive neutrinos and non-constant equations of state for dark energy. This constitutes an extension of the syren-halofit emulators to incorporate these two effects, which we call syren-new (SYmbolic-Regression-ENhanced power spectrum emulator with NEutrinos and $W_0-w_a$). We also obtain a simple approximation to the derived parameter $\sigma_8$ as a function of the cosmological parameters for these models. Our results for the linear power spectrum are designed to emulate CLASS, whereas for the nonlinear case we aim to match the results of EuclidEmulator2. We compare our results to existing emulators and $N$-body simulations. Our analytic emulators for $\sigma_8$, the linear and nonlinear power spectra achieve root mean squared errors of 0.1%, 0.3% and 1.3%, respectively, across a wide range of cosmological parameters, redshifts and wavenumbers. We verify that emulator-related discrepancies are subdominant compared to observational errors and other modelling uncertainties when computing shear power spectra for LSST-like surveys. Our expressions have similar accuracy to existing (numerical) emulators, but are at least an order of magnitude faster, both on a CPU and GPU. Our work greatly improves the accuracy, speed and range of applicability of current symbolic approximations to the linear and nonlinear matter power spectra. We provide publicly available code for all symbolic approximations found.

 - **Abstract**
 Interstellar dust links the formation of the first stars to the rocky planet we inhabit by playing a pivotal role in the cooling and fragmentation of molecular clouds, and catalyzing the formation of water and organic molecules. Despite its central role, the origin of dust and its formation timescale remain unknown. Some models favor rapid production in supernova ejecta as the primary origin of dust, while others invoke slower production by evolved asymptotic giant branch stars or grain growth in the interstellar medium (ISM). The dust content of young early-universe galaxies is highly sensitive to the dust formation timescales. Here, we evaluate the dust content of 631 galaxies at $3 < z_{\rm spec} < 14$ based on rest-UV to optical spectroscopy obtained with JWST NIRSpec. We find that dust appears rapidly. Attenuation immediately follows star formation on timescales shorter than $\sim 30$ Myr, favoring dust production by supernovae. The degree of attenuation is $\sim 30$ times lower than expected if the entire supernova dust yield were preserved in the ISM, and had Milky Way-like grain properties. This can be reconciled if the early-universe dust is composed mostly of silicate or grains much larger than those in the Milky Way, and if significant dust destruction or ejection by outflows takes place.
