#### Tension of toroidal magnetic field in reconnection plasmoids and relativistic jets

 - **Abstract**
 Toroidal magnetic field is a key ingredient of relativistic jets launched by certain accreting astrophysical black holes, and of plasmoids emerging from the tearing instability during magnetic reconnection, a candidate dissipation mechanism in jets. Tension of toroidal field is an anisotropic force that can compress local energy and momentum densities. We investigate this effect in plasmoids produced during relativistic reconnection initiated from a Harris layer by means of kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) numerical simulations, varying the system size (including 3D cases), magnetisation, or guide field. We find that: (1) plasmoid cores are dominated by plasma energy density for guide fields up to B_z ~ B_0; (2) relaxed 'monster' plasmoids compress plasma energy density only modestly (by factor ~3 above the initial level for drifting particle population); (3) energy density compressions by factors >~10 are achieved during plasmoid mergers, especially with the emergence of secondary plasmoids. This kinetic-scale effect can be combined with a global focusing of the jet Poynting flux along the quasi-cylindrical bunched spine (a proposed jet layer adjacent to the cylindrical core) due to poloidal line bunching (a prolonged effect of tension of the jet toroidal field) to enhance the luminosity of rapid radiation flares from blazars. The case of M87 as a misaligned blazar is discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 Very massive stars with masses over 100 Msun are key objects in the Universe for our understanding of chemical and energetic feedback in the Universe, but their evolution and fate are almost entirely determined by their wind mass loss. We aim to determine the mass of the most massive star known in the Local Group R136a1. For this we compute the first hydrodynamically consistent non-local thermodynamical equilibrium atmosphere models for both R136a1 (WN5h) as well as the binary system R144 (WN5/6h+WN6/7h) in the Tarantula nebula. Using the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet code, we simultaneously empirically derive and theoretically predict mass-loss rates and wind velocities. By fitting synthetic spectra derived from these models to multi-wavelength observations, we constrain the stellar and wind properties of R144 and R136a1. We first determine the clumping stratification required by our hydro-models to fit the spectra of R144 by using the available dynamical mass estimates for the two components. We then utilise this clumping stratification in hydrodynamic models of R136a1 and estimate a mass of $M_\mathrm{Hydro}$ of 233 Msun. Remarkably, the estimated mass is close to and entirely consistent with chemical homogeneous mass relations. This present-day mass of 233 Msun provides a lower limit to the initial stellar mass, that could be far higher due to previous wind mass loss.
#### 3D Adiabatic Simulations of Binary Black Hole Formation in AGN

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate close encounters between initially unbound black holes (BHs) in the gaseous discs of active galactic nuclei (AGN), performing the first 3D non-isothermal hydrodynamical simulations of gas-assisted binary BH formation. We discuss a suite of 135 simulations, considering 9 AGN disc environments and 15 BH impact parameters. We find that the gas distribution within the Hill sphere about an isolated embedded BH is akin to a spherically symmetric star with a low-mass convective envelope and a BH core, with large convective currents driving strong outflows away from the midplane. We find that Coriolis force acting on the outflow results in winds, analogous to cyclones, that counter-rotate with respect to the midplane flow within the Hill sphere. We confirm the existence of strong thermal blasts due to minidisc collisions during BH close encounters, as predicted in our previous 2D studies. We document binary formation across a wide range of environments, finding formation likelihood is increased when the gas mass in the Hill sphere is large, allowing for easier binary formation in the outer AGN disc. We provide a comprehensive overview of the SMBH's role in binary formation, investigating how binary formation in intermediate density environments is biased towards certain binary orientations. We offer two models for predicting dissipation by gas during close encounters, as a function of the ambient Hill mass alone, or with the periapsis depth. We use these models to motivate a prescription for binary formation likelihood that can be readily applied to Monte-Carlo simulations of AGN evolution.
#### SOFIA/HAWC+ Far-Infrared Polarimetric Large Area CMZ Exploration Survey. V. The Magnetic Field Strength and Morphology in the Sagittarius C Complex

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of the magnetic field strength and morphology in the Sagittarius C complex (Sgr C; G359.43-0.09) in the Milky Way Galaxy's Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) using the 214 $\mu$m polarimetry data acquired with the High-Angular-Resolution Wideband Camera+ (HAWC+) instrument aboard the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA). We use several hundred magnetic field pseudovectors in the Sgr C region to trace the projected magnetic field orientation within cold molecular gas clouds, and as is the trend throughout the CMZ, they show a higher polarization fraction toward the periphery of the clouds. We conduct a modified Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi (DCF) analysis of individual clouds and find that the sky-plane magnetic field strength varies from highly turbulent regions having inferred strengths of $\sim30~\mu{\rm G}$ to regions of relatively uniform field orientation having strengths of $\sim 1~{\rm mG}$. The magnetic field orientations suggest that outflows from active star-forming regions, such as the extended green object (EGO) G359.43-0.10 and the protostellar source FIR-4 (G359.43+0.02), cause high turbulence in their vicinity. The magnetic field direction is found to be tangential to the surface of the Sgr C HII region, as well as two [CII] emission cavities around this region. Several other features in the vicinity of Sgr C, especially numerous non-thermal filaments (NTFs) and a diffuse source of X-ray emission towards the southwest of the \hii{} region, are discussed with regard to the observed magnetic field pseudovectors.
#### Long-term impact of the magnetic-field strength on the evolution and electromagnetic emission by neutron-star merger remnants

 - **Abstract**
 Numerical simulations are essential to understand the complex physics accompanying the merger of binary systems of neutron stars. However, these simulations become computationally challenging when they have to model the merger remnants on timescales over which secular phenomena, such as the launching of magnetically driven outflows, develop. To tackle these challenges, we have recently developed a hybrid approach that combines, via a hand-off transition, a fully general-relativistic code (FIL) with a more efficient code making use of the conformally flat approximation (BHAC+). We here report important additional developments of BHAC+ consisting of the inclusion of gravitational-wave radiation-reaction contributions and of higher-order formulations of the equations of general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics. Both improvements have allowed us to explore BNS merger remnants with high accuracy and over timescales that would have been computationally prohibitive otherwise. More specifically, we have investigated the impact of the magnetic-field strength on the long-term (\ie $\sim 200\,{\rm ms}$) and high-resolution (\ie $150\,{\rm m}$) evolutions of the ``magnetar'' resulting from the merger of two neutron stars with a realistic equation of state. In this way, and for sufficiently large magnetic fields, we observe the weakening or suppression of differential rotation and the generation of magnetic flares in the outer layers of the remnant. These flares, driven mostly by the Parker instability, are responsible for intense and collimated Poynting flux outbursts and mass ejections. This novel phenomenology offers the possibility of seeking corresponding signatures from the observations of short gamma-ray bursts and hence revealing the existence of a long-lived strongly magnetized remnant.
#### A New Framework for AGN Accretion and Jet Feedback in Numerical Simulations

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate modeling of active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback, especially due to relativistic jets, is crucial for understanding the cool-core problem in galaxy clusters. We present a new subgrid method to model accretion onto and feedback from AGN in hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters. Instead of applying the traditional Bondi formalism, we use a sink particle algorithm in which the accretion flux is measured directly through a control surface. A weighting kernel is used to reset the gas properties within the accretion radius at the end of each timestep. We implement feedback in the form of bipolar jets whose properties are tied to the accretion rate. The method is tested with a spherically symmetric Bondi gas flow problem and a Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton wind problem, with and without jet feedback. We discuss the reliability of this model by comparing our jet simulations with those in the literature, and we examine the dependence of test results on parameters such as the resolution and size of the jet injection region. We find that the sink particle model can account for the $\alpha$ factor in accretion measurement, and the accretion radius must be resolved with at least two zones to produce realistic black hole accretion. We also show how under-resolving the AGN feedback region in simulations can impact the feedback energy deposited and the jet dynamics. The code described here is the framework for a feedback model, described in a companion paper, that will use accretion disk modeling to more self-consistently determine the feedback efficiency.
#### An Increase in the Prevalence of Ionized Outflows in Galaxies with Coronal Line Emission: Feedback in Action?

 - **Abstract**
 Coronal lines (CLs), which arise from collisionally excited forbidden transitions from highly ionized species, are a powerful diagnostic tool in uncovering active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and constraining their properties. However, recent optical surveys are finding that coronal lines are rarely detected in the majority of local AGNs, possibly as a result of the depletion of elements from the interstellar gas onto dust grains. Prominent CL emission may therefore only arise when dust is being destroyed in the highly ionized gas in AGNs. To explore the possibility that dust destruction may be caused by ionized gas outflows in galaxies with prominent CLs, we present the first large-scale systematic study of ionized outflows, as traced by the [O III] $\lambda$5007 emission, in galaxies displaying CL emission relative to a robust control sample of non-CL-emitting galaxies. We find: 1) galaxies that display CL emission have a significantly elevated outflow incidence rate compared to their matched controls, 2) the outflow luminosity is significantly higher in the CL-emitters, 3) the CL-emitters have systematically lower intrinsic extinction toward the ionized gas compared with the controls, 4) there are significant correlations between the CL luminosity and outflow velocity for the iron CLs, with similar relationships found between the CL FWHM and outflow luminosity. These observations are consistent with dust destruction in an outflowing wind from a dusty torus causing efficient CL emission.

 - **Abstract**
 Dense gas in molecular clouds is an important signature of ongoing and future star formation. We identify and track dense cores in the STARFORGE simulations, following the core evolution from birth through dispersal by stellar feedback for typical Milky Way cloud conditions. Only $\sim$8% of cores host protostars, and most disperse before forming stars. The median starless and protostellar core lifetimes are $\sim 0.5-0.6$ Myr and $\sim0.8-1.1$ Myr, respectively, where the protostellar phase lasts $\sim 0.1^{+0.1}_{-0.05}$ Myr. While core evolution is stochastic, we find that virial ratios and linewidths decline in prestellar cores, coincident with turbulent decay. Collapse occurs over $\sim 0.1$ Myr, once the central density exceeds $\gtrsim 10^6$cm$^{-3}$. Starless cores, only, follow linewidth-size and mass-size relations, $\sigma \propto R^{0.3}$ and $M \propto R^1$. The core median mass, radius, and velocity dispersion scale weakly with the cloud magnetic field strength. We cluster the core properties and find that protostellar cores have $>80$% likelihood of belonging to three particular groups that are characterized by high central densities, compact radii, and lower virial parameters. Overall, core evolution appears to be universally set by the interplay of gravity and magnetized turbulence, while stellar feedback dictates protostellar core properties and sets the protostellar phase lifetime.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar flares are defined as outbursts on the surface of the Sun. They occur when energy accumulated in magnetic fields enclosing solar active regions (ARs) is abruptly expelled. Solar flares and associated coronal mass ejections are sources of space weather that adversely impact devices at or near Earth, including the obstruction of high-frequency radio waves utilized for communication and the deterioration of power grid operations. Tracking and delivering early and precise predictions of solar flares is essential for readiness and catastrophe risk mitigation. This paper employs the random forest (RF) model to address the binary classification task, analyzing the links between solar flares and their originating ARs with observational data gathered from 2011 to 2021 by this http URL and the XRT flare database. We seek to identify the physical features of a source AR that significantly influence its potential to trigger >=C-class flares. We found that the features of AR_Type_Today, Hale_Class_Yesterday are the most and the least prepotent features, respectively. NoS_Difference has a remarkable effect in decision-making in both global and local interpretations.

 - **Abstract**
 Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations bring broadband internet and cellular service to the most remote locations on the planet. Unfortunately, many of these locations also host some of the world's best optical and radio astronomy (RA) observatories. With the number of LEO satellites expected to increase by an order of magnitude in the upcoming decade, satellite downlink radio frequency interference (RFI) is a growing concern in protected radio-quiet areas like the United States National Radio Quiet Zone. When these satellites transmit in the spectrum near protected RA bands, undesired out-of-band emission can leak into these protected bands and impact scientific observations. In this paper, we present a self-reporting system - Operational Data Sharing (ODS) - which enables mutual awareness by publishing radio telescopes' operational information to a protected database that is available to satellite operators through a representational state transfer application programming interface (REST API). Satellite operators can use the ODS data to adapt their downlink tasking algorithms in real time to avoid overwhelming sensitive RA facilities, particularly, through the novel Telescope Boresight Avoidance (TBA) technique. Preliminary results from recent experiments between the NRAO and the SpaceX Starlink teams demonstrate the effectiveness of the ODS and TBA in reducing downlink RFI in the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array's observations in the 1990-1995 MHz and 10.7-12.7 GHz bands. This automated ODS system is beginning to be implemented by other RA facilities and could be utilized by other satellite operators in the near future.
#### 3D Simulations of Semiconvection in Spheres: Turbulent Mixing and Layer Formation

 - **Abstract**
 Semiconvection occurs in regions of stars and planets that are unstable to overturning convection according to the Schwarzschild criterion, yet stable according to the Ledoux criterion. Previous simulations in Cartesian boxes have advanced our understanding of the semiconvective instability, layer formation, and transport properties. However, much less is known about semiconvection in spherical geometry and under the influence of rotation or magnetic fields. We present 3D simulations of semiconvection in the full sphere (including $r=0$), and accounting for rotation. We find that the formation and evolution of semiconvective layers in nonrotating spheres occurs in a similar way to nonrotating Cartesian boxes, in the sense that the critical density ratio at which layers are expected to form is approximately the same in both geometries. Layers rapidly merge once they form, ultimately leading to a fully mixed convective sphere. The transport properties measured through the Nusselt numbers and the buoyancy flux ratio are also similar to results from previous studies in boxes. When rotation is added to the system, layer formation and evolution proceeds in a similar fashion to the nonrotating runs. However, rotation hampers the radial transport of heat and composition, and, as a result, the time required for the sphere to become fully mixed gets longer as the flow becomes more rotationally constrained. We also find that semiconvective layers exhibit spherical mixing in nonrotating cases, whereas in rotating cases, the mixing becomes more cylindrical. We discuss what is needed for future work to build more realistic models.
#### Multifrequency Radio Observations of the Magnetar Swift J1818.0--1607

 - **Abstract**
 We report on Green Bank Telescope observations of the radio magnetar Swift J1818.0--1607 between 820 MHz and 35 GHz, taken from six to nine months after its 2020 March outburst. We obtained multi-hour observations at six frequencies, recording polarimetric, spectral, and single-pulse information. The spectrum peaks at a frequency of $5.4 \pm 0.6$ GHz, making Swift J1818.0--1607 one of many radio magnetars which exhibit a gigahertz-peaked spectrum (GPS). The radio flux decays steeply above the peak frequency, with in-band spectral indices $\alpha < -2.3 $ above 9 GHz. The emission is highly ($> 50\%$) linearly polarized, with a lower degree ($< 30\%$) of circular polarization which can change handedness between single pulses. Across the frequency range of our observations, the time-integrated radio profiles share a common shape: a narrow ``pulsar-like'' central component flanked by ``magnetar-like'' components comprised of bright, spiky subpulses. The outer profile components exhibit larger degrees of flux modulation and flatter spectral indices when compared to the central pulse component.
#### Hierarchical Bayesian estimation of population-level torque law parameters from anomalous pulsar braking indices

 - **Abstract**
 Abridged. Stochastic fluctuations in the spin frequency $\nu$ of a rotation-powered pulsar affect how accurately one measures the power-law braking index, $n_{\rm pl}$, defined through $\dot{\nu}=K\nu^{n_{\rm pl}}$, and can lead to measurements of anomalous braking indices, with $\vert n \vert = \vert \nu \ddot{\nu}/ \dot{\nu}^{2} \vert \gg1$, where the overdot symbolizes a derivative with respect to time. Previous studies show that the variance of the measured $n$ obeys the predictive, falsifiable formula $\langle n^{2} \rangle = n_{\rm pl}^{2}+\sigma^{2}_{\ddot{\nu}}\nu^{2}\gamma_{\ddot{\nu}}^{-2}\dot{\nu}^{-4}T_{\rm obs}^{-1}$ for $\dot{K}=0$, where $\sigma_{\ddot{\nu}}$ is the timing noise amplitude, $\gamma_{\ddot{\nu}}^{-1}$ is a stellar damping time-scale, and $T_{\rm obs}$ is the total observing time. Here we combine this formula with a hierarchical Bayesian scheme to infer the population-level distribution of $n_{\rm pl}$ for a pulsar population of size $M$. The scheme is validated using synthetic data. For a plausible test population with $M=100$ and injected $n_{\rm pl}$ values drawn from a population-level Gaussian with mean $\mu_{\rm pl}=4$ and standard deviation $\sigma_{\rm pl}=0.5$, intermediate between electromagnetic braking and mass quadrupole gravitational radiation reaction, the Bayesian scheme infers $\mu_{\rm pl}=3.89^{+0.24}_{-0.23}$ and $\sigma_{\rm pl}=0.43^{+0.21}_{-0.14}$. The $M=100$ per-pulsar posteriors for $n_{\rm pl}$ and $\sigma^{2}_{\ddot{\nu}}\gamma_{\ddot{\nu}}^{-2}$ contain $87\%$ and $69\%$, respectively, of the injected values within their $90\%$ credible intervals. Comparable accuracy is achieved for (i) population sizes spanning the range $50 \leq M \leq 300$, and (ii) wide priors satisfying $\mu_{\rm pl} \leq 10^{3}$ and $\sigma_{\rm pl} \leq 10^{2}$, which accommodate plausible spin-down mechanisms with $\dot{K}\neq0$.

 - **Abstract**
 We report a statistically significant detection of cumulative $\gamma$-ray emission from a stacked sample of SPT-SZ selected galaxy clusters using 16.4 years of data from the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope's Large Area Telescope (LAT). By analyzing a population of clusters with individual Test Statistic (TS) values $<$ 9.0, we identify a robust cumulative signal with a TS of 75.2, corresponding to approximately 8.4$\sigma$ significance. In contrast, clusters with TS $<$ 4.0 yield a weaker cumulative signal of TS = 9.65, consistent with background fluctuations. The derived $\gamma$-ray spectrum is well characterized by a power law model with a best-fit spectral index of $-2.59 \pm 0.20$ and an integrated flux of $1.67^{+1.35}_{-1.07} \times 10^{-11}$ ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. The spectral index matches hadronic cosmic-ray interaction predictions but may also include contributions from AGNs within the galaxy clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy clusters are the largest self-gravitational systems in the Universe. They are valuable probes of the structure growth of the Universe when we estimate their peculiar velocities with the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effects. We investigate whether there is a systematic offset between the peculiar velocities ($v_{\rm z,kSZ}$) estimated with the kSZ effect and the true velocities of halos. We first created mocks of the 2D maps of SZ effects in seven frequency bands for galaxy clusters spanning a broad range of masses in TNG 300-3. We then derived the line-of-sight (LOS) peculiar velocities of galaxy clusters by applying an analytical formula to fit the spectra of the SZ effect. We find that the analytical formula-fitting method tends to overestimate the peculiar velocities of galaxy clusters, regardless of whether they approach us or recede from us. However, when galaxy clusters larger than 500 km/s were excluded, the slopes of the relations between $v_{\rm z,kSZ}$ and the real LOS velocities of galaxy clusters ($v_{\rm z,halo}$) were consistent with unity within the errors. Additionally, we further accounted for observational noise for different-aperture telescopes under different precipitable water vapor. The slopes for most cases are consistent with unity within the errors, and the errors of the slopes slightly increase with higher observation noise. The $|v_{\rm z,kSZ}-v_{\rm z,halo}|$ exhibits no obvious trend with increasing concentration and $M_{\rm 200}$. It is noteworthy that the $|v_{\rm z,kSZ}-v_{\rm z,halo}|$ is relatively high for galaxy clusters with strong active galactic nucleus feedback and high star formation rates. This indicates that these physical processes affect the cluster dynamic state and may reflect on the peculiar velocity estimated from the kSZ effect.

 - **Abstract**
 In the case of Type-2 AGNs, estimating the mass of the black hole is challenging. Understanding how galaxies form and evolve requires considerable insight into the mass of black holes. This work compared different classical and quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms for black hole mass estimation, wherein the classical algorithms are Linear Regression, XGBoost Regression, Random Forest Regressor, Support Vector Regressor (SVR), Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, Elastic Net Regression, Bayesian Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Gradient Booster Regressor, Classical Neural Networks, Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), LSTM, Deep Residual Networks (ResNets) and Transformer-Based Regression. On the other hand, quantum algorithms including Hybrid Quantum Neural Networks (QNN), Quantum Long Short-Term Memory (Q-LSTM), Sampler-QNN, Estimator-QNN, Variational Quantum Regressor (VQR), Quantum Linear Regression(Q-LR), QML with JAX optimization were also tested. The results revealed that classical algorithms gave better R^2, MAE, MSE, and RMSE results than the quantum models. Among the classical models, LSTM has the best result with an accuracy of 99.77%. Estimator-QNN has the highest accuracy for quantum algorithms with an MSE of 0.0124 and an accuracy of 99.75%. This study ascertains both the strengths and weaknesses of the classical and the quantum approaches. As far as our knowledge goes, this work could pave the way for the future application of quantum algorithms in astrophysical data analysis.

 - **Abstract**
 Double-peaked narrow emission lines (DPNELs) might be evidence for the existence of kpc-scale dual AGNs. There are so far large samples of objects with DPNELs in narrow emission line galaxies. Here, a systematic search is made to build a sample of type 1 AGNs with double-peaked [O~{\sc~iii}] from Data Release 16 of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Through visually inspecting and fitting [O~{\sc~iii}], fitting broad H$\alpha$ emission lines, performing F-test for [O~{\sc~iii}] profiles, and checking broad H$\beta$ and [O~{\sc~iii}] emission lines, we select 62 type 1 AGNs with reliable double-peaked [O~{\sc~iii}] from 11557 QSOs with z < 0.3. After visually checking the 62 SDSS multi-color images, we find only seven objects with signs of merging. Four possible models for the double-peaked [O~{\sc~iii}] observed in our sample are discussed: the superposition model, AGN outflow model, dual AGN model, and rotating disk model. However, the current results can not provide any one explanation conclusively, and additional observational data are needed to provide the details of narrow line regions. But at least 22 objects with different velocity offsets between double-peaked [O~{\sc~iii}] and narrow H$\alpha$ emission lines could be excluded as dual AGN candidates. The relative velocity offsets of the [O~{\sc~iii}] blue-shifted/red-shifted components are negative to their line flux ratios, which is consistent with dual AGN model. This work provides a new sample of 62 type 1 AGNs with double-peaked [O~{\sc~iii}] for further study.

 - **Abstract**
 Machine learning (ML) has become a key tool in astronomy, driving advancements in the analysis and interpretation of complex datasets from observations. This article reviews the application of ML techniques in the identification and classification of stellar objects, alongside the inference of their key astrophysical properties. We highlight the role of both supervised and unsupervised ML algorithms, particularly deep learning models, in classifying stars and enhancing our understanding of essential stellar parameters, such as mass, age, and chemical composition. We discuss ML applications in the study of various stellar objects, including binaries, supernovae, dwarfs, young stellar objects, variables, metal-poor, and chemically peculiar stars. Additionally, we examine the role of ML in investigating star-related interstellar medium objects, such as protoplanetary disks, planetary nebulae, cold neutral medium, feedback bubbles, and molecular clouds.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Magnetic fields exhibit a wide variety of behaviours in low mass stars and further characterization is required to understand these observations. Stellar photometry from space missions such as MOST, CoRoT, Kepler, and, in future PLATO, provide thousands of highly precise light curves (LC) that can shed new light upon stellar activity, in particular through the signature of transiting spots. Aims. We study the impact of star spots on light curves in the Fourier domain, reducing the degeneracies encountered by direct spot modelling in the temporal domain, and use this new formulation to explore the spot properties from the available data. Methods. We propose a model of LC power spectra at low frequency based on a description of spot transits that allows us to retrieve information about the amplitude of their photometric impact $\mathcal{H}$, and about the spot mean lifetime over the observation $\tau_{\rm life}$ when the power spectrum exibits rotation peaks. We first validate this method with simulated LCs and then apply it to the Kepler data to extract global trends over a set of more than 37 755 stars. Results. This analysis leads to a classification of the sample into "peakless" or "with peaks" spectra, and enables the identification of different activity regimes based on $\mathcal{H}$ and $\tau_{\rm life}$ for different ranges of Rossby number. More specifically, we observe an intense regime of activity between Ro = 0.7 and Ro = 1, for stars with masses under 1$M_\odot$. Conclusions. This new systematic method can be used to provide new observational constraints on stellar activity (and possibly a link with stellar magnetism) when applied to large photometric datasets, such as those from the future PLATO mission.

 - **Abstract**
 High redshift active galactic nuclei (AGN) provide key insights into early supermassive black hole growth and cosmic evolution. This study investigates the parsec-scale properties of 86 radio-loud quasars at z $\geq$ 3 using very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations. Our results show predominantly compact core and core-jet morphologies, with 35\% unresolved cores, 59\% core-jet structures, and only 6\% core-double jet morphology. Brightness temperatures are generally lower than expected for highly radiative sources. The jet proper motions are surprisingly slow compared to lower-redshift samples. We observe a high fraction of young and/or confined peak-spectrum sources, providing insights into early AGN evolution in dense environments during early cosmic epochs. The observed trends may reflect genuine evolutionary changes in AGN structure over cosmic time, or selection effects favoring more compact sources at higher redshifts. These results stress the complexity of high-redshift radio-loud AGN populations and emphasize the need for multi-wavelength, high-resolution observations to fully characterize their properties and evolution through cosmic history.

 The background galaxies in Euclid Early Release Observations images of the Perseus cluster make up a remarkable sample in its combination of 0.57 deg$^2$ area, 25.3 and 23.2 AB mag depth, as well as 0.1" and 0.3" angular resolutions, in optical and near-IR bands, respectively. Towards characterising the history of the Hubble sequence, we perform a preliminary morphological analysis of 2445 and 12,786 galaxies with $I_E < 21$ and $I_E < 23$, respectively. We use single-Sérsic profiles and the sums of a Sérsic bulge and an exponential disc to model these galaxies with SourceXtractor++ and analyse their parameters in order to assess their consistencies and biases. The fitted galaxies to $I_E < 21$ span the various Hubble types with ubiquitous bulge and disc components, and a bulge-to-total light ratio B/T taking all values from 0 to 1. The median effective radius of the single-Sérsic profile is a biased estimate of galaxy size, intermediate between the bulge and disc effective radii, depending on B/T. The axis ratio of the single-Sérsic profile overestimates that of the disc, increasingly so with B/T. The model impacts the photometry with -0.08 to 0.01 mag median systematic $I_E$ offsets between single-Sérsic and bulge+disc total magnitudes, and a 0.05 to 0.15 mag dispersion, from low to high B/T. We measure a median 0.4 mag bulge-disc colour difference in $I_E - J_E$ that originates from the disc-dominated galaxies, whereas bulge-dominated galaxies have similar median colours of their components. Remarkably, we also measure redder-inside disc colour gradients, based on 5 to 10% systematic variations of disc effective radii between the optical and near-IR bands. This analysis demonstrates the usefulness and limits of single-Sérsic profile modelling, and the power of bulge-disc decomposition for reliably characterising the morphology of lenticulars and spirals in Euclid images.

 - **Abstract**
 The Multiple Amplifier Sensing Charge-Coupled Device (MAS-CCD) has emerged as a promising technology for astronomical observation, quantum imaging, and low-energy particle detection due to its ability to reduce the readout noise without increasing the readout time as in its predecessor, the Skipper-CCD, by reading out the same charge packet through multiple inline amplifiers. Previous works identified a new parameter in this sensor, called the Node Removal Inefficiency (NRI), related to inefficiencies in charge transfer and residual charge removal from the output gates after readout. These inefficiencies can lead to distortions in the measured signals similar to those produced by the charge transfer inefficiencies in standard CCDs. This work introduces more details in the mathematical description of the NRI mechanism and provides techniques to quantify its magnitude from the measured data. It also proposes a new operation strategy that significantly reduces its effect with minimal alterations of the timing sequences or voltage settings for the other components of the sensor. The proposed technique is corroborated by experimental results on a sixteen-amplifier MAS-CCD. At the same time, the experimental data demonstrate that this approach minimizes the NRI effect to levels comparable to other sources of distortion the charge transfer inefficiency in scientific devices.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar streams are remnants of globular clusters or dwarf galaxies that have been tidally disrupted by the gravitational potential of their host galaxy. Streams originating from dwarfs can be particularly compelling targets for indirect dark matter (DM) searches, as dwarfs are believed to be highly DM-dominated systems. Although these streams are expected to lose most of their DM during the tidal stretching process, a significant amount may still remain in their core. If DM is composed of WIMPs, their annihilation within the streams' cores could produce a detectable gamma-ray signal. In this study, we analyze nearly 15 years of data from the Large Area Telescope aboard NASA's Fermi satellite (Fermi-LAT) to search for potential WIMP annihilation signals from the direction of 11 stellar streams selected using DM-motivated criteria. No gamma-ray emission is detected from any of the streams in our sample. In the absence of a signal, we place the first constraints on the WIMP parameter space based on these objects for two representative annihilation channels. Individual DM limits are first computed and then combined across all streams. The most reliable combined constraints, derived from a golden sample and using a benchmark description of their DM content, are $O(10)$ times above the thermal relic cross-section for the $bb$ and $\tau^+\tau^-$ annihilation channels. We also explore how these constraints vary under more conservative or optimistic yet realistic assumptions, finding variations of up to a few orders of magnitude. This large systematic uncertainty stems from key model limitations, which can and should be addressed in future observations and simulations to produce more robust DM limits from streams. Despite uncertainties, this study demonstrates the feasibility of using stellar streams for DM searches and highlights their significant potential to uncover the properties of DM particles.
