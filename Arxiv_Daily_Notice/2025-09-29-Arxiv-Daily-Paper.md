 - **Abstract**
 We use astrometric data on 3I/ATLAS compiled by the Minor Planet Center from May 15 to September 23, 2025, and derive an upper limit on any statistically significant deviation from the best-fit gravity-based trajectory. The residuals imply that the non-gravitational acceleration is smaller than $\sim 3 \times 10^{-10}\,{\rm au\,d^{-2}}$. Based on the total mass-loss rate and outflow speed inferred from JWST data on August 6, 2025, we derive lower limits on the mass and diameter of 3I/ATLAS of $3.3 \times 10^{16}\,{\rm g}$ and $5\,{\rm km}$, respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 Inertial waves transport energy and momentum in rotating fluids and are a major contributor to mixing and tidal dissipation in Earth's oceans, gaseous planets, and stellar interiors. However, their stability and breakdown mechanisms are not fully understood. We examine the linear stability and nonlinear breakdown of finite-amplitude propagating plane inertial waves using Floquet theory and direct numerical simulations. The Floquet analysis generalizes previous studies as it is valid for arbitrary perturbation wavelengths and primary wave amplitudes. We find that the wavenumber orientation of the most unstable perturbations depends strongly on the wave frequency and weakly on the wave amplitude. The most unstable perturbations have wavelengths that are small relative to the primary wave wavelength for low wave amplitudes, but become comparable for large wave amplitudes. We then use direct numerical simulations to follow the nonlinear breakdown of the wave and examine how the wave energy is either dissipated in a forward cascade or accumulated into long-lived geostrophic modes. Simulations reveal that the conversion efficiency into geostrophic modes increases with increasing wave amplitude, as expected for pumping of geostrophic modes by nearly-resonant triadic interactions. We also find that the conversion efficiency increases with decreasing primary wave frequency, which may be due to the more efficient coupling of quasi-2D waves to geostrophic modes. These results on the stability and breakdown of single plane inertial waves provides additional foundation for understanding the role of inertial waves in rotating turbulence, transport properties of inertial wave beams, and inertial wave propagation in more complex environments such as those with magnetic fields or shear flows.

 - **Abstract**
 GRAVITY+ improves by orders of magnitude the sensitivity, sky-coverage and contrast of the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI). A central part of this project is the development of Gravity Plus Adaptive Optics (GPAO), a dedicated high-order and laser-guide star Adaptive Optics (AO) system for VLTI. GPAO consists of four state-of-the-art AO systems equipping all 8m-class Unit Telescopes (UTs) for the wavefront correction of the VLTI instruments. It offers both visible and infrared Natural Guide Star (NGS) and Laser Guide Star (LGS) operations. The paper presents the design, operations and performances of GPAO. We illustrate the improvement brought by GPAO with interferometric observations obtained during the commissioning of the NGS mode end-2024. These science results include the first optical interferometry observations of a redshift $z\sim4$ quasar, the spectroscopy of a cool brown-dwarf with magnitude $K\sim 21.0$, the first observations of a Class I young star with GRAVITY, and the first sub-micro arcsecond differential astrometry in the optical. Together with the entire GRAVITY+ project, the implementation of GPAO is a true paradigm shift for observing the optical Universe at very high angular resolution.
#### Characterizing Temperatures of Flares on the M Dwarf Wolf 359 from Simultaneous Multiband Optical Observations

 - **Abstract**
 We present a flare temperature study of the highly active M~dwarf Wolf~359 using simultaneous multiband ($u$, $g$, $r$, $i$, and $z$) photometric observations from the Lulin 1-m and 41-cm telescopes. Twelve flares were detected over five nights, with significant brightness increases in the $u$, $g$, and $r$~bands; only three were seen in $i$, and none in $z$. From broadband SED fitting and $g$/$r$ color ratio, we derive an average flare temperature of $5500 \pm 1600$~K, significantly cooler than the canonical 10000~K. We obtained a power-law relation between FWHM flare temperature and energy in the solar-class flare regime and extrapolated it to higher energies, superflare regime. This power-law is consistent with the trends reported for M-dwarf superflares in previous studies, suggesting a common temperature-energy scaling across several orders of magnitude. However, the scatter in the superflare regime increases, indicating that such energetic events may involve more complex physical mechanisms and limiting the applicability of simple blackbody models at the high energy flares. Using our FWHM flare temperature--TRIPOL~$g$ energy relation and the reported flare energy frequency distribution of Wolf~359, we evaluated the potential flare contribution to photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) in the habitable zone. We find that typical solar-class giant flares ($E_{\mathrm{fl,bol}} \sim 9\times10^{31}$~erg, $T_{\mathrm{fl,fwhm}} \sim 6800$~K) are {not frequent enough} to sustain Earth-like net primary productivity. Even under the extreme superflare condition ($\sim$$10^{36}$~erg, $\sim$16500~K), flare activity remains far from meeting the PAR threshold.

 - **Abstract**
 Heavily obscured Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), especially Compton-thick sources with line-of-sight column density ($N_{\rm H,los}$) $>$ 10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$, are critical to understanding supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth and the origin of the Cosmic X-ray Background (CXB). However, their observed fraction remains significantly below model predictions, due to strong absorption bias, even in the hard X-ray (i.e., above 10 keV) band. We analyze a sample of 26 nearby ($z < 0.1$) AGN from the Swift-BAT 150-month catalog, selected via mid-IR to X-ray diagnostics and observed with NuSTAR and soft X-ray telescopes (Xmm-Newton, Chandra, or Swift-xrt). Using self-consistent torus models (MyTorus, Borus02, and UXCLUMPY), we aim to constrain $N_{\rm H,los}$, the average torus column density, and other geometrical parameters of the obscuring medium. A comparative analysis among the three torus models showed that while estimates of $N_{\rm{H,los}}$ were generally in agreement, Borus02 tended to classify a slightly larger number of sources as Compton-thick AGN (CT-AGN). Building on this comparison, we benchmark two prediction schemes -- a mid-IR/X-ray relation and a machine-learning model -- against our broadband best-fit $N_{\rm H,los}$ measurements to assess which approach more effectively bridges the gap between predicted and measured obscuration, finding that while the former works effectively in the heavily obscured region (log$\rm{N_H} \gtrsim$ 23.5 $\rm{cm^{-2}}$), the latter provides improved accuracy, particularly for Compton-thin to moderately thick regimes (log$\rm{N_H} \lesssim$ 23.5 $\rm{cm^{-2}}$).

 - **Abstract**
 We present observational evidence for three massive, accreting black holes in the $z=5.0167$ galaxy J0148-4214 from JWST/NIRSpec-IFU spectroscopy. The black holes are revealed through broad H$\alpha$ emission (FWHM = 430-2920 km/s) without a forbidden-line counterpart in the bright [O III] doublet. Channel maps of the asymmetric central H$\alpha$ profile isolate two spatially distinct broad line regions (BLRs), separated by $190\pm40$ pc, while a third BLR is found in the galaxy outskirts with a projected separation of 1.7 kpc. Using single-epoch virial relations, we estimate black hole masses of $\log(M_\bullet/M_\odot)=7.9\pm0.4$ (primary central), $5.8\pm0.5$ (secondary central) and $6.3\pm0.5$ (third off-nuclear). We argue that the two central black holes will likely rapidly merge, with a simple dynamical friction time estimate of the order of 700 Myr. Assuming that also the off-nuclear black hole is in the process of sinking towards the centre, it will likely lead to a second merger, and we investigate the detection probability of such mergers with LISA. Alternatively, the third black hole may be the result of previous three-body interaction or a gravitational recoil, where our observations would provide evidence that such black holes may retain their accretion discs and BLRs even in the aftermath of such extreme dynamical interactions. The discovery of a black hole triplet at high redshift, together with other recent results on distant black hole pairs, indicates that multiple massive black hole systems were common in the early Universe. Our results highlight the importance of IFU observations for the detection of massive black hole multiplets in distant galaxies, the progenitors of massive black hole mergers that may be detected with next-generation gravitational wave observatories.

 - **Abstract**
 With JWST, observing separate spectra of the morning and evening limbs of hot Jupiters has finally become a reality. The first such observation was reported for WASP-39b, where the evening terminator was observed to have a larger transit radius by about 400 ppm and a stronger 4.3 $\mu$m CO$_2$ feature than the morning terminator. Multiple factors, including temperature differences, photo/thermochemistry, clouds and hazes, could cause such limb asymmetries. To interpret these new limb asymmetry observations, a detailed understanding of how the relevant processes affect morning and evening spectra grounded in forward models is needed. Focusing on WASP-39b, we compare simulations from five different general circulation models (GCMs), including one simulating disequilibrium thermochemistry and one with cloud radiative feedback, to the recent WASP-39b limb asymmetry observations. We also post-process the temperature structures of all simulations with a 2D photochemical model and one simulation with a cloud microphysics model. Although the temperatures predicted by the different models vary considerably, the models are remarkably consistent in their predicted morning--evening temperature differences. Several equilibrium-chemistry simulations predict strong methane features in the morning spectrum, not seen in the observations. When including disequilibrium processes, horizontal transport homogenizes methane, and these methane features disappear. However, even after including photochemistry and clouds, our models still cannot reproduce the observed ${\sim}2000$ ppm asymmetry in the CO$_2$ feature. A combination of factors, such as varying metallicity and unexplored parameters in cloud models, may explain the discrepancy, emphasizing the need for future models integrating cloud microphysics and feedback across a broader parameter space.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent multiwavelength observations of young solar analogs suggest that the young Sun in the first 600 Myr was a magnetically active star that produced an X-ray and Extreme-UV (EUV) bright corona, fast, massive stellar wind, and energetic eruptive events. These outputs affected magnetospheric environments of early Earth and young rocky exoplanets. The interaction of the fast solar wind with the slow wind produced strong shocks from Corotating Interaction Regions (CIRs) that provided high dynamic pressure on the magnetospheres of early Venus, Earth, and Mars. Here, we apply the Space Weather Modeling Framework (SWMF), coupled with the Rice Convection Model (RCM) to simulate the response of the magnetospheric environments and associated Joule heating deposited in the upper atmosphere of early Earth as it passed through a CIR shock from the young Sun. The model suggests ~ 40% closer dayside magnetopause standoff distance, and higher negative SYMH, Cross Polar Cap Potentials (CPCP), atmospheric Joule heating, Field Aligned Currents (FAC), electron precipitations, and equatorward polar cap expansions, comparable or exceeding those of recent intense and super geomagnetic storms. The magnetic storm produces dawn-dusk asymmetries in the polar cap boundary arising from the stellar magnetic field By. The proton density enhancements during the CIR event are the dominant factor in the overall dynamic pressure for resulting electron precipitation and Joule heating deposited into the Earth's ionosphere. We discuss implications for the magnetospheric states and associated habitability conditions on early Earth and young rocky exoplanets around magnetically active solar-like stars.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first results from the ALMA Perseus Polarization Survey (ALPPS), focusing on the magnetic field in the SVS13A circumbinary disk. The dataset includes full-Stokes dust continuum observations at $\sim0\farcs3$ and 870 $\mu$m, as well as molecular line emission from C$^{17}$O$(J=3 \rightarrow 2)$ at $\sim0\farcs3$, C$^{18}$O$(J=2 \rightarrow 1)$ at $\sim0\farcs2$, and DCN$(J=3 \rightarrow 2)$ at $\sim0\farcs1$ angular resolution. Our observations resolve both a previously identified dust spiral and an infalling streamer, capturing their spatial and kinematic structures. The streamer is traced from scales $>300$ au down to the circumbinary disk. Using alignment measure (AM) maps and histograms that compare the orientations of the plane-of-sky magnetic field with local intensity and velocity gradients, we find that the AM distribution peaks at a value of 1. This AM peak strongly suggests alignment between the field and the dust total intensity emission, as well as between the field and the gas velocity, which in turn suggests grain alignment by magnetic fields. From our data, we derive a magnetic field strength, B$_{\mathrm{pos}} \sim 1.1 \pm 0.6$\, mG, and a kinetic to magnetic energy ratio of $0.5 \pm 0.4$, suggesting magnetic dominance. We also produced a map of the Alfvénic Mach number, finding $\mathcal{M}_{\rm A} < 1$ along the streamer, consistent with sub-Alfvénic infalling motions. Therefore, the field is likely facilitating the inflow of material from the envelope onto the disk by constraining movement across the field lines. This represents the first detection of a magnetically sub-Alfvénic infalling streamer in a protostellar system.

 - **Abstract**
 Blue Large-Amplitude Pulsators (BLAPs) are a class of radially pulsating stars with effective temperatures ranging from 20,000 to 35,000 K and pulsation periods between 7 and 75 minutes. This study utilizes the Binary Population and Spectral Synthesis (BPASS) code to investigate helium-burning stars as a formation channel for BLAPs in the Milky Way. The progenitor stars have initial masses of 3-6 $M_{\odot}$, resulting in BLAPs with final masses of 0.5-1.2 $M_{\odot}$. Based on a constant star formation rate of 3 $ M_{\odot}\text{yr}^{-1}$ and solar metallicity (Z = 0.020), population synthesis predicts approximately 14,351 helium-burning BLAPs in the Milky Way: 12,799 with Main Sequence (MS) companions and 1,551 with evolved/compact-object companions. Helium-burning BLAPs show prolonged lifetimes in the pulsation region and a narrow stellar age range for entering this regime (log(t/yr) = 8.0-8.6), unlike pre-white dwarf models. BLAPs with MS companions typically form via Roche lobe overflow, leading to longer orbital periods ($\sim$100 days). Those with evolved/compact-object companions form through common envelope evolution, resulting in shorter periods. While Galactic extinction makes most BLAPs faint (apparent magnitudes $>$ 25), future surveys like WFST and VRO LSST are expected to detect approximately 500-900. This research establishes helium-burning stars as a significant BLAP contributor and offers testable predictions regarding their binary properties and Galactic distribution.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we investigate how the merging process influences the radial variations of the specific Star Formation Rate (sSFR), Star Formation Efficiency (SFE), and molecular gas fraction (fmol ) in galaxies. We analyse 33 isolated galaxies and 34 galaxies in four different merger stages from pairs, merging galaxies, post-mergers, and merger remnants. Our sample is included in the EDGE-CALIFA survey, which provides spatially resolved optical integral-field unit and CO spectroscopy data. We show that, in comparison with the isolated sample, the mergers increase the molecular gas fraction non-uniformly across different galactocentric distances. Also, we find that the main driver (efficiency or molecular gas) of both enhanced and suppressed star formation changes independently of galactocentric radius and merger stage. However, efficiency appears to be the primary driver of variations in star formation (except during the merging stage), where we find an enhancement in star formation driven by the available fuel. Our results suggest that in interacting and merging galaxies, the efficiency plays a crucial role in the star formation variations throughout the galaxy, regardless of the available molecular gas content.
#### Baseline-Aware Dependence fitting for DAmping Timescales (BADDAT): A Nearly Unbiased Approach to Constraining Optical Variability Dependence on Physical Properties of Active Galactic Nuclei

 - **Abstract**
 Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) exhibit stochastic optical variability, commonly characterized by a damped random walk. The damping timescale is of particular interest because it is related to fundamental properties of the central black hole, such as its mass and accretion rate. However, the systematic underestimation of damping timescales caused by limited observational baselines makes it difficult to exhaustively utilize all available data. Many previous efforts have relied on strict selection criteria to avoid biased measurements, and such criteria inevitably constrain the range of AGN physical parameter space and therefore hinder robust inference of the underlying dependencies of damping timescale on AGN properties. In contrast, we introduce a novel forward modeling approach, Baseline-Aware Dependence fitting for DAmping Timescales (BADDAT), which explicitly accounts for these biases and leverages the information contained in underestimated timescale measurements. Rather than attempting to correct individual timescale measurements, BADDAT robustly constrains the population-level dependence of damping timescale on AGN physical properties. We demonstrate its effectiveness using mock light curves and show that it successfully reconciles previous inconsistent results based on two independent AGN samples. Our BADDAT method will have broad applications in AGN variability studies during the era of time-domain astronomy.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy formation and evolution is hierarchical. The most massive galaxies are thought to form their central regions early through violent dissipational processes, then grow inside-out by accreting smaller satellites. While widely supported, direct observational confirmation of this process in individual galaxies remains lacking, except for the Milky Way. We present a detailed analysis of globular cluster (GC) candidates within a $70^\prime$ ($\sim190$ kpc) radius around the nearest S0 galaxy, NGC 3115, using images in \textit{g,r,z} bands from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys and data from Gaia. We report the discovery of mass stratification in the GC system (GCS), evident in two ways: first, the effective radius of the GCS increases monotonically from the bright to faint end, up to the detection limit near the turnover magnitude of the GC luminosity function (GCLF); second, the GCLF shows fainter turnover magnitudes and smaller standard deviations at larger galactocentric radii. This stratification cannot be readily explained by radial migration or tidal dissolution, but most likely reflects the hierarchical assembly of NGC 3115's stellar halo, with later-accreted satellites deposited across broader galactocentric distances. This interpretation is supported by cosmological simulations of subhalos with comparable mass and bulge-to-total mass ratios and is consistent with the negative color gradients observed in the GCS. Additionally, we identify several substructures within the GCS, indicating ongoing assembly of NGC 3115. This work highlights the power of GCS as tracers of galaxy assembly and sets the stage for upcoming space-based wide-field imaging surveys to constrain the assembly of massive galaxies.
#### Revisiting 3C 279 jet morphology with space VLBI at 26 microarcsecond resolution

 - **Abstract**
 We present observations of the blazar 3C 279 at 22 GHz using the space VLBI mission RadioAstron on 2018 January 15. Images in both total intensity and fractional polarization are reconstructed using RML method implemented in the eht-imaging library. The electric vector position angles are found to be mostly aligned with the general jet direction, suggesting a predominantly toroidal magnetic field, in agreement with the presence of a helical magnetic field. Ground-space fringes were detected up to a projected baseline length of $\sim 8$G$\lambda$, achieving the angular resolution of around 26$\mu$as. The fine-scale structure of the relativistic jet is found in our study extending to a projected distance of $\sim 180$ parsec from the radio core. However, the filamentary structure reported by previous RadioAstron observations of 2014 is not detected in our current study. We discuss potential causes for this phenomenon, together with a comparison using public 43 GHz data from the BEAM-ME program, showing a significant drop in the jet's total intensity. The optically thick core is observed with a brightness temperature of $ 1.6 \times 10^{12}$ K, consistent with equipartition between the energy densities of the relativistic particles and the magnetic field. This yields an estimated magnetic field strength of 0.2 G.

 - **Abstract**
 The impact of cosmic web environments on galaxy properties plays a critical role in understanding galaxy formation. Using the state-of-the-art cosmological simulation IllustrisTNG, we investigate how satellite galaxy abundance differs between filaments and the field, with filaments identified using the DisPerSE algorithm. When filaments are identified using galaxies as tracers, we find that, across all magnitude bins, central galaxies in filaments tend to host more satellite galaxies than their counterparts in the field, in qualitative agreement with observational results from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The average ratios between satellite luminosity functions in filaments and the field are $3.49$, $2.61$, and $1.90$ in the central galaxy $r$-band magnitude bins of $M_{r, {\rm cen}} \sim -22$, $-21$, and $-20$, respectively. We show that much of this excess can be attributed to the higher host halo masses of galaxies in filaments. After resampling central galaxies in both environments to match the halo mass distributions within each magnitude bin, the satellite abundance enhancement in filaments is reduced by up to $79 \%$. Additionally, the choice of tracers used to identify filaments introduces a significant bias: when filaments are identified using the dark matter density field, the environmental difference in satellite abundance is reduced by more than $70 \%$; after further resampling in both magnitude and halo mass, the difference is further suppressed by another $\sim 60$--$95 \%$. Our results highlight the importance of halo mass differences and tracer choice biases when interpreting and understanding the impact of environment on satellite galaxy properties.

 Context. Recent Monte Carlo simulations and laboratory studies of interstellar ices have proposed an alternative pathway involving the radical-molecule H-atom abstraction reaction in the overall mechanism of methanol (CH3OH) formation in dark molecular clouds. Aims. A computational study was conducted to investigate the contribution of the radical-molecule H-atom abstraction route in CH3OH formation in interstellar ices, both in non-shocked and shocked environments, and to examine how the physical conditions of the interstellar medium (ISM) affect the overall CH3OH synthesis pathway. Methods. A set of chemical models were ran using the gas-grain chemical code UCLCHEM to systematically explore methanol synthesis in various physical scenarios, including non-shock and low- and high-velocity C-shocks. Results. This work demonstrated for the first time that, under non-shock and shocked-influenced environments, the primary reaction leading to the formation of methanol in the inner layers of interstellar ices is indeed the radical-molecule H-atom abstraction route. However, such route is dependent on the gas kinetic temperature (Tk), gas volume density (nH2 ), velocity of the C-shock wave (vshock), and cosmic ray ionisation rate ({\zeta}). Furthermore, gaseous formaldehyde may trace C-type shocks and serve to differentiate methanol formation pathways in low-velocity C-shocked environments, as its abundance varies more significantly than that of CH3OH with the inclusion of the H-atom abstraction reaction in UCLCHEM. The H2CO/CH3OH ratio thus represents a potential diagnostic tool for this purpose.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the acceleration and transport of electrons in the highly fine-structured current sheet that develops during magnetic flux rope (MFR) eruptions. Our work combines ultra-resolved MHD simulations of MFR eruption, with test-particle studies performed using the guiding center approximation. Our grid-adaptive, fully three-dimensional, high-resolution magnetohydrodynamic simulations model MFR eruptions that form complex current sheet topologies, serving as background electromagnetic fields for particle acceleration. Within the current sheet, tearing-mode instabilities give rise to mini flux ropes. Electrons become temporarily trapped within these elongated structures, undergoing acceleration and transport processes that significantly differ from those observed in two-dimensional or two-and-a-half-dimensional simulations. Our findings reveal that these fine-scale structures act as efficient particle accelerators, surpassing the acceleration efficiency of single X-line reconnection events, and are capable of energizing electrons to energies exceeding 100 keV. High-energy electrons accelerated in different mini flux ropes follow distinct trajectories due to spatially varying magnetic field connectivity, ultimately precipitating onto opposite sides of flare ribbons. Remarkably, double electron sources at the flare ribbons originate from different small flux rope acceleration regions, rather than from the same reconnecting field line as previously suggested. Distinct small flux ropes possess opposite magnetic helicity to accelerate electrons to source regions with different magnetic polarities, establishing a novel conjugate double source configuration. Furthermore, electrons escaping from the lower regions exhibit a broken power-law energy spectrum.

 - **Abstract**
 RR Lyrae stars have long been considered unequivocal tracers of old (>10 Gyr) and metal-poor ($\mathrm{[Fe/H]}<-0.5$) stellar populations. First, because these populations are where they are readily found and because, according to canonical stellar evolution models for isolated stars, these are the only populations where RR Lyrae should exist. Recent independent results, however, are challenging this view and pointing at the existence of intermediate-age RR Lyrae, only a few (2--5) Gyrs old. Our goal in this work is to provide direct evidence of the existence of intermediate-age RR Lyrae by searching for these stars in Milky Way open clusters, where the age association will be direct and robust. We searched over 3,000 open clusters with published kinematically associated member stars from the Hunt & Reffert database by crossmatching against a compilation of the largest publicly available RR Lyrae surveys (\Gaia, ASAS-SN, PanStarrs1, Zwicky Transient Factory and OGLE-IV). We identified a star as a bona fide RR~Lyrae variable and robust member of the 2--4 Gyr old Trumpler 5 cluster, based on its parallax and proper motions and their agreement with confirmed cluster members. We derived an extremely low probability ($0.049\pm 0.013$%) that the star is a background field RR~Lyrae and provide initial constraints on a possible binary companion based on its position in the colour-absolute magnitude diagram. Currently a source of debate, the Trumpler~5 RR Lyrae provides the most direct evidence to date of the existence of RR Lyrae stars at much younger ages than traditionally expected and adds to the mounting evidence supporting their existence.

 - **Abstract**
 Axion-like particles (ALPs) are compelling candidates for dark matter and potential portals to new physics beyond the Standard Model. Photons traversing magnetized regions can convert into ALPs, producing characteristic, energy-dependent absorption features in astrophysical spectra. The probability of such conversions depends sensitively on both the photon energy and the properties of the intervening magnetic fields. Most existing searches have focused on individual astrophysical sources, but uncertainties in the structure and strength of cosmic magnetic fields have limited their reach. Recently, we have demonstrated that active galactic nuclei (AGNs) observed through galaxy clusters provide especially promising targets for ALP searches. By stacking multiple AGN-cluster sightlines, one can average over poorly known magnetic field configurations in galaxy clusters and recover a distinctive ALP-induced spectral suppression, thereby significantly enhancing sensitivity. In this work, we investigate a possible systematic uncertainty in such analyses: the intrinsic time-variability of AGN spectra. We demonstrate that AGN flux variability is correlated with spectral hardness, and that time-averaging over flaring and quiescent states can potentially mimic the suppression features imprinted by ALP-photon mixing. Our findings imply that the recent constraints remain conservative, and that incorporating detailed spectral variability into stacking analyses can further sharpen the search for axion-like particles.

 - **Abstract**
 Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) are organic molecules responsible for the Aromatic Infrared Bands (AIBs), observed across a multitude of astrophysical environments. Despite their ubiquity, the precise formation mechanisms of PAHs remain unclear. One of the possible way for PAHs to form is in the outflows of evolved stars, such as HD 44179, which produces the Red Rectangle nebula - a known emitter of AIBs. However, no specific PAH molecules have been detected in such environments, complicating the understanding of PAH formation and evolution. This study aimed to detect the PAH molecule corannulene C20H10, a viable candidate for radio detection due to its large dipole moment of 2.07D. We analyzed high-resolution band 4 ALMA observations of the Red Rectangle nebula, collected over almost 9 hrs. Although corannulene emission was not detected, we estimated a firm upper limit on its abundance compared to hydrogen (5x10^-13) and we discuss the lack of detection in the context of our current understanding of PAH formation and destruction mechanisms. Additionally, we report tentative detection of signals at 139.612 GHz, 139.617 GHz, and 139.621 GHz, potentially originating from cyclopropenyledine c-C3H2 and the 140 GHz H2O maser.

 - **Abstract**
 The death of massive stars is accompanied by the formation of central and accreting compact objects and the subsequent launch of relativistic jets. However, not all jets successfully drill their way out of the stellar envelope. Unsuccessful jets, also known as choked jets, may still produce radiation at lower frequencies by dissipating the jet energy into a pressurized cocoon. This cocoon expands within the stellar envelope and eventually breaks out as a mildly relativistic outflow. We investigate the plasma physics in the surroundings of massive collapsing stars harboring choked jets via relativistic, non-resistive MHD simulations. As a result, we define the parameter space allowing for jets to remain choked, and we quantify the acceleration rate and efficiency for charged particles in the strong shocks of such astrophysical environments. Preliminary results show that high Mach numbers ($\sim 100$) after 5-10 seconds of constant energy injection characterize the forward shock, possibly allowing for efficient particle acceleration and high-energy neutrino production. Our results are presented for blue supergiant progenitors.

 - **Abstract**
 The "Diamond Ring" in Cygnus X, southwest of the DR21 ridge, is a nearly circular structure of $\sim$6 pc in diameter, prominent in FIR emission and enclosed by clumpy molecular clouds traced in CO. It hosts an HII region, visible in cm emission, and resembles a classical expanding HII bubble routinely seen in the 158 $\mu$m [CII] line. However, SOFIA FEEDBACK observations in the spectrally resolved [CII] line reveal instead a slightly tilted ring of $\sim$10$^3$ M$_\odot$ expanding slowly at $\sim$1.3 km s$^{-1}$, with a bulk line-of-sight (LOS) velocity near $-2$ km s$^{-1}$. The central "Diamond" is an unrelated dense clump at $\sim$7 km s$^{-1}$. The driving source, classified from IR spectroscopy, is a B0.5e star that powers the HII region. Unlike typical 3D shells, this marks the first case where we detect only a slowly expanding CII ring. We suggest the HII region and CII bubble, initially formed by a massive star, expanded outward from a flat slab of molecular gas nearly in the plane of the sky. The ring is now confined by swept-up material of the slab, while shell components moving perpendicular to the LOS have dissipated, leading to a reduction in expansion. Dedicated simulations tracing the evolution of the CII bubble support this geometry, consistent with previous reports of HII region evolution in flat molecular clouds. We propose that the "Diamond Ring" represents the terminal phase of an expanding CII bubble driven by stellar winds and thermal pressure.

 - **Abstract**
 SDSS-C4 3028 is a galaxy cluster at $z=0.061$, notable for its unusually high fraction of star-forming galaxies with 19 star-forming and 11 quiescent spectroscopically-confirmed member galaxies. From Subaru/HSC imaging, we derived a weak lensing mass of $M_{200} = (1.3 \pm 0.9) \times 10^{14} \rm M_\odot$, indicating a low-mass cluster. This is in excellent agreement with its dynamical mass of $M_{200} = (1.0\pm0.4)\times10^{14} \rm M_\odot$, derived from SDSS spectroscopic data. XMM-Newton observations reveal that its X-ray emission is uniform and fully consistent with the astrophysical X-ray background, with no evidence for an intracluster medium (ICM). The 3$\sigma$ upper limit of $L_{\rm X}(0.1-2.4\rm keV)=7.7\times10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ on the cluster's X-ray luminosity falls below the value expected from the $L_{\rm X}-M_{\rm halo}$ scaling relation of nearby galaxy clusters. We derived star-formation histories for its member galaxies using the photometric spectral energy distribution from SDSS, 2MASS, and WISE data. Most of its quiescent galaxies reside within the central 300 kpc, while star-forming ones dominate the outer region (300 kpc - 1 Mpc). The core region has formed the bulk of its stellar mass approximately 1.5 Gyr earlier than the outskirts. We infer a long quenching time of $>3$ Gyr for its quiescent galaxies, consistent with slow quenching mechanisms such as galaxy-galaxy interaction or strangulation. These findings suggest that SDSS-C4 3028 may have undergone an "inside-out" formation and quenching process. Its ICM may have been expelled by intense AGN feedback after core formation but before full cluster assembly. The high fraction ($\sim$0.63) of star-forming members likely results from the absence of ram pressure stripping in this blue cluster, supporting the important role of ram pressure stripping in quenching galaxies in clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 We used the third data release of the UKIRT Hemisphere Survey to locate previously unrecognized high proper motion objects. We identify a total of 127 new discoveries with total proper motions $\gtrsim$300 mas yr$^{-1}$. A significant fraction of these sources with counterparts in the Gaia DR3 catalog are found to be distant ($>$100 pc) low-mass stars, where their large tangential velocities and placement on color-magnitude diagrams suggest that they are likely low-metallicity M-type subdwarfs. Optical spectroscopy is used to confirm the low-mass and low-metallicity for two such sources. Using available optical and infrared photometry, we estimate the spectral type for all non-Gaia sources and find 10 likely late-M dwarfs, 15 objects with colors most consistent with L-type dwarfs, and 9 possible T-type dwarfs. Follow-up spectroscopy is needed to confirm spectral types and further characterize these new discoveries.

 - **Abstract**
 We study synchrotron polarization in spatially resolved horizon-scale images, such as those produced by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). In both general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations as well as simplified models of the black hole magnetosphere, the polarization angle, quantified by the complex observable arg(beta_2), depends strongly and systematically on the black hole spin. This relationship arises from the coupling between spin and the structure of the magnetic field in the emission region, and it can be computed analytically in the force-free limit. To explore this connection further, we develop a semi-analytic inflow framework that solves the time stationary axisymmetric equations of GRMHD in the black hole's equatorial plane; this model can interpolate between the force-free and inertial regimes by varying the magnetization of the inflow. Our model demonstrates how finite inertia modifies the structure of the electromagnetic field and can be used to quantitatively predict the observed polarization pattern. By comparing reduced models, GRMHD simulations, and analytic limits, we show that the observed synchrotron polarization can serve as a robust diagnostic of spin under assumptions about Faraday rotation and the emission geometry. Applied to EHT data, the model disfavors high-spin configurations for both M87* and Sgr A*, highlighting the potential of polarimetric imaging as a probe of both black hole spin and near-horizon plasma physics.
