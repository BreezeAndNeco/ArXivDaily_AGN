 - **Abstract**
 The Rayleigh Taylor instability (RTI) occurs at the interface between two fluids of different densities, notably when a heavier fluid sits above a lighter one in an effective gravitational field. This instability is relevant to many astrophysical systems where relativistic effects are significant. We examine the linear theory of relativistic Rayleigh Taylor instability (RRTI) in a magnetized medium, allowing for relativistic fluid motion parallel to the interface. To simplify our derivations, we use an "intermediate frame" where fluids on both sides have the same Lorentz factor. Our analysis yields the dispersion relation for RRTI. We find that the instability occurs when the Atwood number $\mathcal{A}$ = $(\rho_1 h_1 - \rho_2 h_2) / (\rho_1 h_1 + \rho_2 h_2) >0$, without requiring relativistic correction. Relativistic motion increases the effective inertia ($\rho \rightarrow \gamma_*^2 \rho$), weakening the magnetic field's suppression of the instability. In the laboratory frame, the instability growth rate is reduced due to time dilation. These analytical results may inform studies of instabilities in systems such as microquasars, active galactic nuclei, gamma-ray bursts, and radio pulsars.

 - **Abstract**
 The Daisy World model has long served as a foundational framework for understanding the self-regulation of planetary biospheres, providing insights into the feedback mechanisms that may govern inhabited exoplanets. In this study, we extend the classic Daisy World model through the lens of Semantic Information Theory (SIT), aiming to characterize the information flow between the biosphere and planetary environment -- what we term the \emph{information architecture} of Daisy World systems. Our objective is to develop novel methodologies for analyzing the evolution of coupled planetary systems, including biospheres and geospheres, with implications for astrobiological observations and the identification of agnostic biosignatures. To operationalize SIT in this context, we introduce a version of the Daisy World model tailored to reflect potential conditions on M-dwarf exoplanets, formulating a system of stochastic differential equations that describe the co-evolution of the daisies and their planetary environment. Analysis of this Exo-Daisy World model reveals how correlations between the biosphere and environment intensify with rising stellar luminosity, and how these correlations correspond to distinct phases of information exchange between the coupled systems. This \emph{rein control} provides a quantitative description of the informational feedback between the biosphere and its host planet. Finally, we discuss the broader implications of our approach for developing detailed ExoGaia models of inhabited exoplanetary systems, proposing new avenues for interpreting astrobiological data and exploring biosignature candidates.
#### Little Red Dots at an Inflection Point: Ubiquitous "V-Shaped" Turnover Consistently Occurs at the Balmer Limit

 - **Abstract**
 Among the most puzzling early discoveries of JWST are "Little Red Dots" -- compact red sources that host broad Balmer emission lines and, in many cases, exhibit a "V shaped" change in slope in the rest-optical. The physical properties of Little Red Dots currently have order-of-magnitude uncertainties, because models to explain the continuum of these sources differ immensely. Here, we leverage the complete selection of red sources in the RUBIES program, supplemented with public PRISM spectra, to study the origin of this "V shape". By fitting a broken power law with a flexible inflection point, we find that a large fraction (20/44, nearly all spatially unresolved) of extremely red H$\alpha$ emitters at $2<z<6$ exhibit a strong change in slope, and that all strong inflections appear associated with the Balmer limit ($0.3645$ $\mu$m). Using a simple model of a reddened AGN with an unobscured scattered light component, we demonstrate that the observed "V shape" in Little Red Dots is unlikely to occur at any specific wavelength if the entire continuum is dominated by light from a power law AGN continuum. In contrast, models with an intrinsic feature at the Balmer limit, such as those that are dominated by evolved stellar populations in the rest-UV-to-optical, can produce the observed spectral shapes, provided that a reddened component picks up sufficiently redward of the break. While no model can comfortably explain the full Little Red Dot spectral energy distribution, the common inflection location suggests that it is most likely a single component that consistently dominates the rest-UV-to-optical in Little Red Dots, and that this component is associated with $T\sim10^4$ K hydrogen due to the clear preference for a break at H$_\infty$.

 - **Abstract**
 The time until black hole formation in a binary neutron-star (NS) merger contains invaluable information about the nuclear equation of state (EoS) but has thus far been difficult to measure. We propose a new way to constrain the merger remnant's NS lifetime, which is based on the tendency of the NS remnant neutrino-driven winds to enrich the ejected material with helium. Based on the He I $\lambda 1083.3$ nm line, we show that the feature around 800-1200 nm in AT2017gfo at 4.4 days seems inconsistent with a helium mass fraction of $X_{\mathrm{He}} \gtrsim 0.05$ in the polar ejecta. Recent neutrino-hydrodynamic simulations of merger remnants are only compatible with this limit if the NS remnant collapses within 20-30 ms. Such a short lifetime implies that the total binary mass of GW170817, $M_\mathrm{\rm tot}$, lay close to the threshold binary mass for direct gravitational collapse, $M_\mathrm{thres}$, for which we estimate $M_{\mathrm{thres}}\lesssim 2.93 M_\odot$. This upper bound on $M_\mathrm{thres}$ yields upper limits on the radii and maximum mass of cold, non-rotating NSs, which rule out simultaneously large values for both quantities. In combination with causality arguments, this result implies a maximum NS mass of $M_\mathrm{max}\lesssim2.3 M_\odot$. The combination of all limits constrains the radii of 1.6 M$_\odot$ NSs to about 12$\pm$1 km for $M_\mathrm{max}$ = 2.0 M$_\odot$ and 11.5$\pm$1 km for $M_\mathrm{max}$ = 2.15 M$_\odot$. This $\sim2$ km allowable range then tightens significantly for $M_\mathrm{max}$ above $\approx2.15$ M$_\odot$. This rules out a significant number of current EoS models. The short NS lifetime also implies that a black-hole torus, not a highly magnetized NS, was the central engine powering the relativistic jet of GRB170817A. Our work motivates future developments...

 - **Abstract**
 The advancement of the Event Horizon Telescope has enabled the study of relativistic jets in active galactic nuclei down to sub-parsec linear scales even at high redshift. Quasi-simultaneous multifrequency observations provide insights into the physical conditions in compact regions and allow testing accretion theories. Initially we aimed at measuring the magnetic field strength close to the central supermassive black hole in NRAO 530 (1730-130) by studying frequency-dependent opacity of the jet matter, Faraday rotation and the spectral index in the mm-radio bands. NRAO 530 was observed quasi-simultaneously at 15, 22, 43, 86, and 227 GHz at four different very long baseline interferometer (VLBI) networks. By the means of imaging and model-fitting, we aligned the images, taken at different frequencies. We explored opacity along the jet and distribution of the linearly polarized emission in it. Our findings reveal that the jet of NRAO 530 at 86 and 227 GHz is transparent down to its origin, with 70 mJy emission detected at 227 GHz potentially originating from the accretion disk. The magnetic field strength near the black hole, estimated at $5r_\mathrm{g}$, is $3\times10^3-3\times10^4$ G (depending on the central black hole mass). These values represent some of the highest magnetic field strengths reported for active galaxies. We also report the first ever VLBI measurement of the Faraday rotation at 43-227 GHz, which reveals rotation measure values as high as -48000 rad/m2 consistent with higher particle density and stronger magnetic fields at the jet's outset. The complex shape of the jet in NRAO 530 is in line with the expected behavior of a precessing jet, with a period estimated to be around $6\pm4$~years.

 - **Abstract**
 The presence of supermassive black holes (SMBHs, $M_{\bullet}\sim 10^{6-10}~M_{\odot}$) in the first cosmic Gyr ($z\gtrsim 6$) challenges current models of BH formation and evolution. We propose a novel mechanism for the formation of early SMBH seeds based on primordial black holes (PBHs). We assume a non-Gaussian primordial power spectrum as expected in inflationary models; these scenarios predict that PBHs are initially clustered and preferentially formed in the high-$\sigma$ fluctuations of the large-scale density field, out of which dark matter (DM) halos are originated. Our model accounts for (i) PBH accretion and feedback, (ii) DM halo growth, and (iii) gas dynamical friction. PBHs lose angular momentum due to gas dynamical friction, sink into a dense core, where BH binaries form and undergo a runaway merger, eventually leading to the formation of a single, massive seed. This mechanism starts at $z\sim 20-40$ in rare halos ($M_h\sim 10^7\ M_\odot$ corresponding to $\sim 5-7\sigma$ fluctuations), and provides massive ($\sim 10^{4-5}~ M_{\odot}$) seeds by $z\sim 10-30$. We derive a physically-motivated seeding prescription that provides the mass of the seed, $ M_{\rm seed}(z)=3.1\times 10^{5}\ { M_{\odot}}[(1+z)/10]^{-1.2}$, and seeded halo, $ M_{h}(z)=2\times 10^{9}\ {M_{\odot}}[(1+z)/10]^{-2}e^{-0.05z}$ as a function of redshift. This seeding mechanism requires that only a small fraction of DM is constituted by PBHs, namely $f_{\rm PBH}\sim 3 \times 10^{-6}$. We find that $z\sim 6-7$ quasars can be explained with $6\times 10^4 M_{\rm \odot}$ seeds planted at $z\sim 32$, and growing at sub-Eddington rates, $\langle\lambda_{\rm E}\rangle\sim 0.55$. The same scenario reproduces the BH mass of GNz11 at $z=10.6$, while UHZ1 ($z=10.1$) and GHZ9 ($z=10$) data favour instead slightly later ($z\sim 20-25$), more massive ($10^5~M_{\rm \odot}$) seeds.

 - **Abstract**
 Planets form from the same cloud of molecular gas and dust as their host stars. Confirming if planetary bodies acquire the same refractory element composition as their natal disc during formation, and how efficiently volatile elements are incorporated into growing planets, is key to linking the poorly constrained interior composition of rocky exoplanets to the observationally-constrained composition of their host star. Such comparisons also afford insight into the planet formation process. This work compares planetary composition with host-star composition using observations of a white dwarf that has accreted planetary material and its F-type star wide binary companion as a reference for the composition of the natal molecular gas and dust. Spectroscopic analysis reveals abundances of Fe, Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti in both stars. We use the white dwarf measurements to estimate the composition of the exoplanetary material and the F-type companion to constrain the composition of the material the planet formed from. Comparing planetary material to the composition of its natal cloud, our results reveal that the planetary material is depleted in moderate refractories (Mg, Si, Fe) relative to the refractory material (Ca, Ti). Grouping elements based on their condensation temperatures is key to linking stellar and planetary compositions. Fractionation during formation or subsequent planetary evolution leads to the depletion of moderate refractories from the planetary material accreted by the white dwarf. This signature, as seen for bulk Earth, will likely be present in the composition of many exoplanets relative to their host-stars.
#### Evolution of X-ray and optical rapid variability during the low/hard state in the 2018 outburst of MAXI J1820+070 = ASASSN-18ey

 - **Abstract**
 We performed shot analyses of X-ray and optical sub-second flares observed during the low/hard state of the 2018 outburst in MAXI J1820$+$070. Optical shots were less spread than X-ray shots. The amplitude of X-ray shots was the highest at the onset of the outburst, and they faded at the transition to the intermediate state. The timescale of shots was $\sim$0.2 s, and we detected the abrupt spectral hardening synchronized with this steep flaring event. The time evolution of optical shots was not similar to that of X-ray shots. These results suggest that accreting gas blobs triggered a series of magnetic reconnections at the hot inner accretion flow in the vicinity of the black hole, which enhanced X-ray emission and generated flaring events. The rapid X-ray spectral hardening would be caused by this kind of magnetic activity. Also, the synchrotron emission not only at the hot flow but also at the jet plasma would contribute to the optical rapid variability. We also found that the low/hard state exhibited six different phases in the hardness-intensity diagram and the correlation plot between the optical flux and the X-ray hardness. The amplitude and duration of X-ray shots varied in synchrony with these phases. This time variation may provide key information about the evolution of the hot flow, the low-temperature outer disk, and the jet-emitting plasma.

 - **Abstract**
 We present interferometric observations at 1 and 3\,mm with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) of the free-free continuum and mm-wavelength recombination line (mRRL) emission of the ionized core (within $\lsim$130\,au) of the young Planetary Nebula (PN) candidate M\,this http URL inner regions are concealed in the vast majority of similar objects. A spectral index for the mm-to-cm continuum of $\sim$0.9 indicates predominantly free-free emission from an ionized wind, with a minor contribution from warm dust. The mm-continuum emission in M\,2-9 reveals an elongated structure along the main symmetry axis of the large-scale bipolar nebula with a C-shaped curvature surrounded by a broad-waisted component. This structure is consistent with an ionized bent jet and a perpendicular compact dusty disk. The presence of a compact equatorial disk (of radius $\sim$50\,au) is also supported by red-shifted CO and \trecem\ absorption profiles observed from the base of the receding north lobe against the compact background continuum. The redshift observed in the CO absorption profiles likely signifies gas infall movements from the disk toward a central source. The mRRLs exhibit velocity gradients along the axis, implying systematic expansion in the C-shaped bipolar outflow. The highest expansion velocities ($\sim$80\,\kms) are found in two diagonally opposed compact regions along the axis, referred to as the high-velocity spots/shells (HVS), indicating either rapid wind acceleration or shocks at radial distances of $\sim$0\farc02-0\farc04 ($\sim$15-25\,au) from the center. A subtle velocity gradient perpendicular to the lobes is also found, suggestive of rotation. Our ALMA observations detect increased brightness and broadness in the mRRLs... (abridged).

 - **Abstract**
 The radiative cooling time of hot gas in the cool cores of many galaxy clusters and massive elliptical galaxies drops in the centre to below 100 million years. The mass cooling rates inferred from simple modelling of X-ray observations of these objects are very low, indicating that either AGN feedback is tightly balanced or that soft X-rays from cooling gas are somehow hidden from view. An intrinsic absorption model developed for application to galaxy clusters is used here to search for hidden cooling flows (HCFs) in seven nearby elliptical galaxies. Mass cooling rates of 0.5-8 solar masses per year are found in each galaxy. The absorbed cooling flow luminosity is in agreement with the observed Far Infrared (FIR) luminosity in each case, indicating absorbed emission is energetically capable of emerging in the FIR band. An observed lack of agreement between HCF rates and normal star formation rates suggests the cooled material must have an alternative fate, with low-mass star formation considered as the primary outcome.
#### Components of star formation in NGC 253 : Non-negative Matrix Factorization Analysis with the ALCHEMI integrated intensity images

 - **Abstract**
 It is essential to examine the physical or chemical properties of molecular gas in starburst galaxies to reveal the underlying mechanisms characterizing starbursts. We used non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to extract individual molecular or physical components involved in the star formation process in NGC\,253. We used images of 148 transitions from 44 different species of the ALMA large program ALCHEMI. Additionally, we included the continuum images at ALMA Bands 3 and 7 from the same dataset. For the five NMF components (NF1--5), we obtained that their distributions correspond to various basic phenomena related to star formation: i) low-density gas extended through the galactic central molecular zone (NF2), ii) shocks (NF3), iii) starburst regions (NF4), and iv) young star-forming regions (NF5). The other component (NF1) is related to excitation; three components obtained by NMF (NF3, 1, and 5) show a strong dependence upon the upper state energies of transitions, and represent low-, intermediate-, and high-excitation, respectively. We also compared our results using principal component analysis (PCA) previously applied to the same dataset. Molecular components extracted from NMF are similar to the ones obtained from PCA. However, NMF is better at extracting components associated with a single physical component, while a single component in PCA usually contains information on multiple physical components. This is especially true for features with weak intensities like emission from outflows. Our results suggest that NMF can be one of promising methods interpreting molecular line survey data, especially in the upcoming era of wide-band receivers.

 The paper presents a theoretical model describing the full power spectra of synchrotron radiation generated by relativistic electrons in a turbulent magnetic field. Using the theoretical model, numerical calculations of the complete power spectra of synchrotron radiation were performed for a turbulent field generated by the harmonic method. Additionally, a model sky map was constructed, demonstrating the structure of the spatial inhomogeneity of the synchrotron radiation power distribution as seen by an observer.
#### A GMRT 610 MHz radio survey of the North Ecliptic Pole (NEP, ADF-N) / Euclid Deep Field North

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents a 610 MHz radio survey covering 1.94 square degrees around the North Ecliptic Pole (NEP), which includes parts of the AKARI (ADF-N) and Euclid, Deep Fields North. The median 5-sigma sensitivity is 28 microJy beam per beam, reaching as low as 19 microJy per beam, with a synthesised beam of 3.6 x 4.1 arcsec. The catalogue contains 1675 radio components, with 339 grouped into multi-component sources and 284 isolated components likely part of double radio sources. Imaging, cataloguing, and source identification are presented, along with preliminary scientific results. From a non-statistical sub-set of 169 objects with multi-wavelength AKARI and other detections, luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) represent 66 percent of the sample, ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) 4 percent, and sources with L_IR < 1011 L_sun 30 percent. In total, 56 percent of sources show some AGN presence, though only seven are AGN-dominated. ULIRGs require three times higher AGN contribution to produce high-quality SED fits compared to lower luminosity galaxies, and AGN presence increases with AGN fraction. The PAH mass fraction is insignificant, although ULIRGs have about half the PAH strength of lower IR-luminosity galaxies. Higher luminosity galaxies show gas and stellar masses an order of magnitude larger, suggesting higher star formation rates. For LIRGs, AGN presence increases with redshift, indicating that part of the total luminosity could be contributed by AGN activity rather than star formation. Simple cross-matching revealed 13 ROSAT QSOs, 45 X-ray sources, and 61 sub-mm galaxies coincident with GMRT radio sources.

 - **Abstract**
 Building the radio sky template are crucial for detecting the 21 cm emission line signal from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), as well as for other cosmological research endeavors. Utilizing data from the LOFAR Two-meter Sky Survey (LoTSS) at 150 MHz, we recalibrated the luminosity function for various types of radio sources, including High Excitation Radio Galaxies (HERGs), Low Excitation Radio Galaxies (LERGs), Radio-Quiet Active Galactic Nuclei (RQ-AGNs), and Star-Forming Galaxies (SFGs). We subsequently updated the Tiered Radio Extragalactic Continuum Simulation (T-RECS) code to generate refined mock radio source catalogues. The simulated source counts from this work align more closely with observed data at redshifts greater than $z>4$. Additionally, the differential source counts in total intensity within the flux density range of $0.1-1~\mathrm{mJy}$ closely mirror actual observations. Due to our model incorporating a lower number of faint sources compared to T-RECS, it predicts a reduced power spectrum for point sources, suggesting a potential advantage in studies in low frequency band.
#### Rotation curves of disk galaxies and General Relativity

 - **Abstract**
 It has been proposed that the flat rotation curves observed at large radii in disk galaxies can be interpreted as an effect of General Relativity (GR) instead of the presence of dark matter (DM) halos in Newtonian gravity. In Ciotti (2022) the problem is rigorously explored in the special setting of the weak-field, low-velocity gravitomagnetic limit of GR. The rotation curves are obtained for purely baryonic disk models with realistic density profiles, and compared with the predictions of Newtonian gravity for the same disks, in absence of DM. The rotation curves are indistinguishable, with percentual GR corrections at all radii of the order of $\approx 10^{-6}$ or less, so that DM halos are required in gravitomagnetism as in Newtonian gravity. From a more general point of view, a list of the most urgent problems that must be addressed by any proposed GR-based alternative to the existence of DM, is given.
#### Simulation of solar energetic particle events originated from coronal mass ejection shocks with a data-driven physics-based transport model

 - **Abstract**
 Solar energetic particle (SEP) events are associated with coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and/or solar flares. SEPs travel through the corona and interplanetary space to reach Earth, posing a radiation hazard to spacecraft and astronauts working in space and the electronics on spacecraft. Due to the distinct magnetic field configuration and solar eruption kinematic properties associated with each event, the utilization of a data-driven model becomes essential for predicting SEP hazards. In this study, we use a developed model that utilizes photospheric magnetic field measurements and CME shock observations as inputs to simulate several historical SEP events associated with fast CME speeds (>700 km/s). The model includes an SEP source term aligned with the theory of diffusive shock acceleration by the CME shock. The performance of the model is accessed by comparing simulations and observations of SEP intensity time profiles at SOHO, ACE, STEREO-A and STEREO-B. The results generally matched observations well, particularly for protons below 40.0 MeV. However, discrepancies arose for higher-energy protons, notably for the events on 2011 March 7 and 2014 February 25, where the simulation tended to overestimate the proton flux . At STEREO-A, the modeled proton intensities for the SEP events on 2013 April 11 and 2011 March 7 display a very different behavior compared to observations because of the efficient transport in longitude caused by the weak magnetic field.

 - **Abstract**
 Gas metallicity, ionization parameter, and gas pressure can affect the observed ratios of specific strong emission lines within galaxies. While the theoretical strong lines diagnostics for gas metallicity, ionization parameters, and gas pressure in star-forming regions are well-established, theoretical diagnostics for active galactic nuclei (AGNs) narrow line regions are still lacking. In Zhu et al. (2023), we presented a new AGN model that provides the best predictions for observations spanning the UV, optical, and infrared wavelengths. This paper presents a suite of theoretical diagnostics for the gas metallicity, ionization parameter, gas pressure, and the peak energy in AGN ionizing radiation field $E_{peak}$ for AGN narrow-line regions spanning the UV and optical wavelengths. We investigate the model dependency on the ionization parameter, gas pressure, $E_{peak}$, and the nitrogen scaling relation and make recommendations on metallicity diagnostics that are most robust against these parameters. We test our new AGN metallicity diagnostics using optical galaxy spectra from Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR16. These tests show that the metallicities measured from different diagnostics in this paper are consistent within $\sim0.3$ dex. We compare consistent HII and AGN diagnostics and demonstrate that HII and AGN diagnostics should not be used interchangeably. With a wide wavelength coverage, we anticipate that these AGN diagnostics will enable new metallicity studies of galaxies dominated by AGN.
