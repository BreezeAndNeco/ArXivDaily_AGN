#### Evidence that pre-processing in filaments drives the anisotropic quenching of satellite galaxies in massive clusters
 - **Authors:** Harry Stephenson (Lancaster), John Stott, Joseph Butler, Molly Webster, Jonathan Head

 - **Abstract**
 We use a sample of 11 $z\approx0.2-0.5$ ($z_{\text{med.}} = 0.36$) galaxy clusters from the Cluster Lensing And Supernovae survey with Hubble (CLASH) to analyse the angular dependence of satellite galaxy colour $(B-R)$ and passive galaxy fractions ($f_{\text{pass.}}$) with respect to the major axis of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG). This phenomenon has been dubbed as \say{anisotropic quenching}, \say{angular conformity} or \say{angular segregation}, and it describes how satellite galaxies along the major axis of the BCG are more likely to be quenched than those along the minor axis. We are the first to measure anisotropic quenching out to $3R_{200}$ ($R_{200\text{, med.}} \approx 933$ \si{\kilo\parsec}) from the cluster centre. A highly significant anisotropic quenching signal is found for satellites with a peak in $(B-R)$ and $f_{\text{pass.}}$ along the major axis. We find that the anisotropic quenching signal is significant out to at least $2.5R_{200}$, and the amplitude of the sinusoidal fit peaks at $\approx1.25R_{200}$. This is the first time the radial peak of the anisotropic quenching signal has been measured directly. Finally, we find that $f_{\text{pass.}}$ is significantly higher along the major axis for fixed values of local surface density. The density drops less rapidly along the major axis and so satellites spend more time being pre-processed here compared to the minor axis. We therefore conclude that pre-processing in large-scale structure, and not active galactic nuclei (AGN) outflows, is the likely cause of the anisotropic quenching signal in massive galaxy clusters, however this may not be the cause in lower mass halos.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the galaxies hosting ultra-strong MgII (USMgII) absorbers at small impact parameters of $\sim$2" (5 - 20 kpc), spanning a redshift range of $0.4 \le z \le 1.7$, using deep, high-resolution images from Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Survey and spectra from SDSS survey. From a total of 418 USMgII absorbers with $W_{2796}\ \ge 3 \mathring{A}$, along 412 quasar sightlines, we detect 50 galaxies based on [O II] $\lambda\lambda$3727,3729 nebular emission detected at $\ge 2\sigma$ level. Utilizing the [O II] emission from the stacked spectrum and employing the best-fit galaxy SED template, we further identify 86 galaxies, leading to a total of 136 bona fide USMgII galaxies. With a prerequisite of having a minimum of four HSC passbands available, we find a detection rate of $\sim$38% at an average impact parameter of 11.4 kpc. We find that galaxies hosting USMgII systems are typically star-forming main sequence galaxies, with 21% exhibiting a starburst nature. The non-zero [O II] emission along the `clear' sightlines, with no stellar counterpart, hints that the USMgII absorbers may likely emanate from the unseen faint galaxies near the quasar. The USMgII absorbers preferentially align along the major and minor axes of the galaxy, which suggests that they originate in the disk or large-scale wind. We show that the distribution of $W_{2796}$ as a function of impact parameter indicates a discernible radial dependence for the `disk' and `wind' subsets, with the observed large scatter in $W_{2796}$ potentially attributed to large-scale outflows. The quasar sightline hosting USMgII systems show a factor three higher galaxy surface density at impact parameters of $\lesssim 50$kpc, highlights the multiple pathways giving rise to USMgII absorption.
#### Connecting GRBs from Binary Neutron Star Mergers to Nuclear Properties of Neutron Stars

 - **Abstract**
 The fate of the binary neutron star (NS) merger remnants hinges sensitively upon the NS equation of state and the threshold mass, $M_{\rm ls}$, that separates a long-lived from a short-lived NS remnant. The nature of the electromagnetic counterparts is also influenced by the remnant type, particularly in determining whether a gamma-ray burst from a compact binary merger (cbGRB) is of short or long duration. We propose a novel approach to probe the threshold mass by linking it to the estimated observed ratio of long to short cbGRBs. We find that current observations broadly favour a relatively high value for this transition, $M_{\rm ls}\simeq 1.3 M_{\rm TOV}$, for which $ M_{\rm TOV} \lesssim 2.6\,M_\odot $, consistent with numerical simulations, as also shown here. Our results disfavour nuclear physics scenarios that would lead to catastrophic pressure loss at a few times nuclear density and temperatures of tens of MeV, leading to a rapid gravitational collapse of binaries with total mass $M \lesssim 1.3 M_{\rm TOV}$. Future individual gravitational wave events with on-axis cbGRBs can further bound $M_{\rm ls}$.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a catalogue of filamentary structures identified in the SARAO (South African Radio Astronomy Observatory) MeerKAT 1.3 GHz Galactic Plane Survey (SMGPS). We extract 933 filaments across the survey area, 803 of which (~86%) are associated with extended radio structures (e.g. supernova remnants and HII regions), whilst 130 (~14%) are largely isolated. We classify filaments as thermal or non-thermal via their associated mid-infrared emission and find 77/130 (~59%) of the isolated sources are likely to be non-thermal, and are therefore excellent candidates for the first isolated, non-thermal radio filaments observed outside of the Galactic Centre (GC). Comparing the morphological properties of these non-thermal candidates to the non-thermal filaments observed towards the GC we find the GC filaments are on the whole angularly narrower and shorter than those across the SMGPS, potentially an effect of distance. The SMGPS filaments have flux densities similar to those of the GC, however the distribution of the latter extends to higher flux densities. If the SMGPS filaments were closer than the GC population, it would imply a more energetic population of cosmic ray electrons in the GC. We find the filament position angles in the SMGPS are uniformly distributed, implying that the local magnetic field traced by the filaments does not follow the large-scale Galactic field. Finally, although we have clearly shown that filaments are not unique to the GC, the GC nevertheless has the highest density of filaments in the Milky Way.

 - **Abstract**
 Models of blazar jets, that explain observations of their photon spectra, typically predict too few neutrinos to be possibly seen by existing telescopes. In particular, they fall short in reproducing the first neutrino ever detected from a blazar, TXS 0506+056, by IceCube in 2017. We predict larger neutrino fluxes by using the same jet models, extended to include deep inelastic scatterings between protons within the jet and sub-GeV dark matter (DM) around the central black holes of blazars. In this way we succeed in explaining neutrino observations of TXS 0506+056, for DM parameters allowed by all laboratory, direct and indirect searches. Our proposal will be tested by DM searches as well as by the observation of more neutrinos from blazars. Our findings motivate to implement DM-nuclei interactions in jet models and to improve our knowledge of DM spikes around active galactic nuclei.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we considered the optical wavelength of Gaia DR3 to analyze poorly studied three newly open star clusters namely OCSN 203, OCSN 213, and OCSN 244 clusters with ASTECA code. Here, we identified candidates of 227, 200, and 551 with highly probable ($P \geq 50\%$) members. Fitting King's profile within RDPs allows us to estimate inner stellar structures like core (0.190 $\le r_{\rm c}$ (pc) $\le$ 1.284) and the limiting (0.327 $\le r_{\rm cl}$ (pc) $\le 1.302$) radii. Constructing CMDs fitted with suitable log age (yr) between (log t; 6.52 - 7.05) and metallicities (Z; 0.01308-0.01413) isochrones. Therefore, the estimated photometric parameters with CMDs, reflect the heliocentric distances are 332 $\pm$ 18, 529 $\pm$ 23, and 506 $\pm$ 23 (pc) for OCSN 203, OCSN 213, and OCSN 244, respectively. Furthermore, the collective mass ($M_{\rm C}$) in solar mass units calculated with MLR as 67 $\pm$ 8.19, 91 $\pm$ 9.54, and 353 $\pm$ 18.79. Additionally, LF determined that the mean absolute magnitudes are 9.54 $\pm$ 3.09, 8.52 $\pm$ 2.92, and 7.60 $\pm$ 2.76 for these clusters, respectively. The overall mass function reflects the slopes ($\alpha$) for Salpeter within the uncertainty are ($\alpha_{OCSN203}$ = 2.41 $\pm$ 0.06), ($\alpha_{OCSN213}$ = 2.13 $\pm$ 0.07), and ($\alpha_{OCSN244}$ = 2.28 $\pm$ 0.07). The results of this study which employed a dynamical analysis over varying timescales indicate that OCSN 203 and OCSN 244 are clusters that have undergone significant relaxation, with a dynamical evolution parameter ($\tau$) that is much greater than one. In contrast, OCSN 213 exhibits characteristics of a non-relaxed cluster. A kinematic analysis of these open clusters was carried out, encompassing aspects of their apex position ($A_o,D_o$) using the AD diagrams. At the end, we found that the three OCSN clusters are young stellar disc members using dynamic orbit parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 The interactions between jets from active galactic nuclei (AGN) and their stellar environments significantly influence jet dynamics and emission characteristics. In low-power jets, such as those in Fanaroff-Riley I (FR I) galaxies, the jet-star interactions can notably affect jet deceleration and energy dissipation. Recent numerical studies suggest that mass loading from stellar winds is a key factor in decelerating jets, accounting for many observed characteristics in FR I jets. Additionally, a radio-optical positional offset has been observed, with optical emission detected further down the jet than radio emission. This observation may challenge traditional explanations based solely on recollimation shocks and instabilities. This work utilizes the radiative transfer code RIPTIDE to generate synthetic synchrotron maps, from a population of re-accelerated electrons, in both radio and optical bands from jet simulations incorporating various mass-loading profiles and distributions of gas and stars within the ambient medium. Our findings emphasize the importance of mass entrainment in replicating the extended and diffuse radio/optical emissions observed in FR I jets and explaining the radio-optical offsets. These offsets are influenced by the galaxy's physical properties, the surrounding stellar populations, and observational biases. We successfully reproduce typical radio-optical offsets by considering a mass-load equivalent to $10^{-9}~M_\odot \cdot \rm{yr}^{-1} \cdot \rm{pc}^{-3}$. Overall, our results demonstrate that positive offset measurements are a promising tool for revealing the fundamental properties of galaxies and potentially their stellar populations, particularly in the context of FR I jets.
#### An Obliquity Measurement of the Hot Neptune TOI-1694b

 - **Abstract**
 We present spectral observations of the multiplanet host TOI-1694 during the transit of TOI-1694b, a 26.1 $M_\oplus$ hot Neptune with a 3.77-day orbit. By analyzing radial velocities obtained from the Keck Planet Finder, we modeled the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect and constrained the sky-projected obliquity to ${9\degree}^{+22\degree}_{-18\degree}$, which is strong evidence for a nearly aligned orbit. TOI-1694b is one of fewer than ten small planets accompanied by confirmed outer giant planets for which the obliquity has been measured. We consider the significance of the outer planet TOI-1694c, a Jupiter-mass planet with a 1-year orbit, and its potential role in influencing the orbit of TOI-1694b to its current state. Incorporating our measurement, we discuss the bifurcation in hot Neptune obliquities and present evidence for an independent polar population. The observed polar planets nearly ubiquitously have periods of $\le 6$ days and mass ratios of $10^{-4}$. Early perturbations by outer companions from resonance crossings in the disk-dispersal stage provide the most compelling explanation for this population. Systems which lack the necessary configuration will retain their primordial obliquity, since hot Neptunes lack the angular momentum needed to realign their hosts on relevant timescales.
#### Extended red wings and the visibility of reionization-epoch Lyman-$\alpha$ emitters

 - **Abstract**
 The visibility of the Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) emission from reionization-epoch galaxies depends sensitively on the extent of the intrinsic \lya emission redwards of 1215.67~Å. The prominent red peak resulting from resonant radiative transfer in the interstellar medium is often modelled as a single Gaussian. We use the \textsc{Azahar} simulation suite of a massive-reionization epoch galaxy to show that a significantly larger fraction of the \lya emission extends to $400$-$800$~km~s$^{-1}$, and thus significantly further to the red than predicted by a Gaussian line profile. A cycle of frequent galaxy mergers strongly modulates the \lya luminosity, the red peak velocity and its extended red wing emerging from the galaxy, which all also strongly vary with viewing angle. The \lya emission also depends sensitively on the implemented feedback, dust and star formation physics. Our simulations including cosmic rays reproduce the observed spectral properties of reionization epoch \lya emitters (LAEs) well if we assume that the \lya emission is affected by very little dust. The visibility of LAEs can be strongly underestimated if the extended red wings of the intrinsic \lya emission are not accounted for. We discuss implications for using the visibility of LAEs to constrain the evolution of the volume-averaged neutral fraction during reionization.

 - **Abstract**
 The molecular Kennicutt-Schmidt (mK-S) Law has been key for understanding star formation (SF) in galaxies across all redshifts. However, recent sub-kpc observations of nearby galaxies reveal deviations from the nearly unity slope (N) obtained with disk-averaged measurements. We study SF and molecular gas (MG) distribution in the early-stage luminous infrared galaxy merger Arp240 (NGC5257-8). Using VLA radio continuum (RC) and ALMA CO(2-1) observations with a uniform grid analysis, we estimate SF rates and MG surface densities ($\Sigma_{\mathrm{SFR}}$ and $\Sigma_{\mathrm{H_2}}$, respectively). In Arp 240, N is sub-linear at 0.52 $\pm$ 0.17. For NGC 5257 and NGC 5258, N is 0.52 $\pm$ 0.16 and 0.75 $\pm$ 0.15, respectively. We identify two SF regimes: high surface brightness (HSB) regions in RC with N $\sim$1, and low surface brightness (LSB) regions with shallow N (ranging 0.15 $\pm$ 0.09 to 0.48 $\pm$ 0.04). Median CO(2-1) linewidth and MG turbulent pressure (P$_{\mathrm{turb}}$) are 25 km s$^{-1}$ and 9 $\times$10$^{5}$ K cm$^{-3}$. No significant correlation was found between $\Sigma_{\mathrm{SFR}}$ and CO(2-1) linewidth. However, $\Sigma_{\mathrm{SFR}}$ correlates with P$_{\mathrm{turb}}$, particularly in HSB regions ($\rho >$0.60). In contrast, SF efficiency moderately anti-correlates with P$_{\mathrm{turb}}$ in LSB regions but shows no correlation in HSB regions. Additionally, we identify regions where peaks in SF and MG are decoupled, yielding a shallow N ($\leq$ 0.28 $\pm$ 0.18). Overall, the range of N reflects distinct physical properties and distribution of both the SF and MG, which can be masked by disk-averaged measurements.

 We present here a study of the broadband spectral properties of 33 sources detected in HI absorption as part of the ASKAP-FLASH Pilot Surveys. We outline our approach to spectral classification and discuss the correlation seen between spectral shape and the detection of HI absorption. We further consider the implications of the observed correlation on the spatial distribution of the neutral gas, and on the jet-gas interactions. Our results are evaluated in the context of the forthcoming, full ASKAP-FLASH survey and other large, untargeted searches of the radio sky.

 - **Abstract**
 A recent report on the detection of very-high-energy gamma rays from V4641 Sagittarii (V4641 Sgr) up to ~0.8 peta-electronvolt has made it the second confirmed "PeVatron" microquasar. Here we report on the observation of V4641 Sgr with X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM) in September 2024. Thanks to the large field of view and low background, the CCD imager Xtend successfully detected for the first time X-ray extended emission around V4641 Sgr with a significance of > 4.5 sigma and > 10 sigma based on our imaging and spectral analysis, respectively. The spatial extent is estimated to have a radius of $7 \pm 3$ arcmin ($13 \pm 5$ pc at a distance of 6.2 kpc) assuming a Gaussian-like radial distribution, which suggests that the particle acceleration site is within ~10 pc of the microquasar. If the X-ray morphology traces the diffusion of accelerated electrons, this spatial extent can be explained by either an enhanced magnetic field (~80 uG) or a suppressed diffusion coefficient (~$10^{27}$ cm$^2$ s$^{-1}$ at 100 TeV). The integrated X-ray flux, (4-6)$\times 10^{-12}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ (2-10 keV), would require a magnetic field strength higher than the galactic mean (> 8 uG) if the diffuse X-ray emission originates from synchrotron radiation and the gamma-ray emission is predominantly hadronic. If the X-rays are of thermal origin, the measured extension, temperature, and plasma density can be explained by a jet with a luminosity of ~$2\times 10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$, which is comparable to the Eddington luminosity of this system.

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of PeV cosmic rays is a long-standing mystery, and ultrahigh-energy gamma-ray observations would play a crucial role in identifying it. Recently, LHAASO reported the discovery of ``dark'' gamma-ray sources that were detected above 100 TeV without any GeV--TeV gamma-ray counterparts. The origins of these dark gamma-ray sources are unknown. We propose isolated black holes (IBHs) wandering in molecular clouds as the origins of PeV cosmic rays and LHAASO dark sources. An IBH accretes surrounding dense gas, which forms a magnetically arrested disk (MAD) around the IBH. Magnetic reconnection in the MAD can accelerate cosmic-ray protons up to PeV energies. Cosmic-ray protons of GeV-TeV energies fall to the IBH, whereas cosmic-ray protons at sub-PeV energies can escape from the MAD, providing PeV CRs into the interstellar medium. The sub-PeV cosmic-ray protons interact with the surrounding molecular clouds, producing TeV-PeV gamma rays without emitting GeV-TeV gamma rays. This scenario can explain the dark sources detected by LHAASO. Taking into account the IBH and molecular cloud distributions in our Galaxy, we demonstrate that IBHs can provide a significant contribution to the PeV cosmic rays observed on Earth. Future gamma-ray detectors in the southern sky and neutrino detectors would provide a concrete test to our scenario.

 - **Abstract**
 Low-mass X-ray binaries with a neutron star as the primary object show a complex array of phenomenology during outbursts. The observed variability in X-ray emission primarily arises from changes in the innermost regions of the accretion disk, neutron star surface, and corona. In this work, we present the results of a comprehensive X-ray spectral and timing analysis of the neutron star transient MAXI J1807+132 during its 2023 outburst using data from the NICER observatory. The outburst is marked by a very rapid rise in the count rate by about a factor of 20 in a day. The source undergoes full state transitions and displays hysteresis effect in the hardness and rms intensity diagrams. Spectral analysis with a three-component model is consistent with disk truncation during the hard states and reaching the last stable orbit during the intermediate and soft states. We discuss the different values of the last stable radius in the context of possible distance of the source and magnetic field strength. The characteristic frequencies throughout the hard and intermediate states are found to be strongly correlated with the inner radius of the disk. Together with the spectral and fast variability properties, we attempt to trace the evolution of the size of the corona along the outburst. Following the main outburst, the source undergoes a high amplitude reflare wherein it shows a complex behavior with relatively high variability (10 %), but low hardness.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of analysing the long-term radio variability of active galactic nuclei at 37 GHz using data of 123 sources observed in the Aalto University Metsähovi Radio Observatory. Our aim was to constrain the characteristic timescales of the studied sources and to analyse whether up to 42 years of monitoring was enough to describe their variability behaviour. We used a periodogram to estimate the power spectral density of each source. The power spectral density is used to analyse the power content of a time series in the frequency domain, and it is a powerful tool in describing the variability of active galactic nuclei. We were interested in finding a bend frequency in the power spectrum, that is, a frequency at which the slope $\beta$ of the spectrum changes from a non-zero value to zero. We fitted two models to the periodograms of each source, namely the bending power law and the simple power law. The bend frequency in the bending power law corresponds to a characteristic timescale. We were able to constrain a timescale for 11 out of 123 sources, with an average characteristic timescale x_b = 1300 days and an average power-law slope $\beta$ = 2.3. The results suggest that up to 42 years of observations may not always be enough for obtaining a characteristic timescale in the radio domain. This is likely caused by a combination of both slow variability as well as sampling induced effects. We also compared the obtained timescales to 43 GHz very long baseline interferometry images. The maximum length of time a knot was visible was often close to the obtained characteristic timescale. This suggests a connection between the characteristic timescale and the jet structure.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we demonstrate some of the caveats in common statistical methods used for analysing astronomical variability timescales. We consider these issues specifically in the context of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and use a more practical approach compared to mathematics literature, where the number of formulae may sometimes be overwhelming. We conducted a thorough literature review both on the statistical properties of light-curve data, specifically in the context of sampling effects, as well as on the methods used to analyse them. We simulated a wide range of data to test some of the known issues in AGN variability analysis as well as to investigate previously unknown or undocumented caveats. We discovered problems with some commonly used methods and confirmed how challenging it is to identify timescales from observed data. We find that interpolation of a light curve with biased sampling, specifically with bias towards flaring events, affects its measured power spectral density in a different manner than those of simulated light curves. We also find that an algorithm aiming to match the probability density function of a light curve has often been used incorrectly. These new issues appear to have been mostly overlooked and not necessarily addressed before, especially in astronomy literature.

 - **Abstract**
 The advancement of observational technologies and software for processing and visualizing spectro-polarimetric microwave data obtained with the RATAN-600 radio telescope opens new opportunities for studying the physical characteristics of solar plasma at the levels of the chromosphere and corona. These levels remain some difficult to detect in the ultraviolet and X-ray ranges. The development of such methods allows for more precise investigation of the fine structure and dynamics of the solar atmosphere, thereby deepening our understanding of the processes occurring in these layers. The obtained data also can be utilized for diagnosing solar plasma and forecasting solar activity. However, using RATAN-600 data requires extensive data processing and familiarity with the RATAN-600. This paper introduces RatanSunPy, an open-source Python package developed for accessing, visualizing, and analyzing multi-band radio observations of the Sun from the RATAN-600 solar complex. The package offers comprehensive data processing functionalities, including direct access to raw data, essential processing steps such as calibration and quiet Sun normalization, and tools for analyzing solar activity. This includes automatic detection of local sources, identifying them with NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) active regions, and further determining parameters for local sources and active regions. By streamlining data processing workflows, RatanSunPy enables researchers to investigate the fine structure and dynamics of the solar atmosphere more efficiently, contributing to advancements in solar physics and space weather forecasting.

 - **Abstract**
 We present RUBIX, a fully tested, well-documented, and modular Open Source tool developed in JAX, designed to forward model IFU cubes of galaxies from cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. The code automatically parallelizes computations across multiple GPUs, demonstrating performance improvements over state-of-the-art codes by a factor of 600. This optimization reduces compute times from hours to only seconds. RUBIX leverages JAX's auto-differentiation capabilities to enable not only forward modeling but also gradient computations through the entire pipeline paving the way for new methodological approaches such as e.g. gradient-based optimization of astrophysics model parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 Polarimetric images of accreting black holes encode important information about laws of strong gravity and relativistic motions of matter. Recent advancements in instrumentation enabled such studies in two objects: supermassive black holes M87* and Sagittarius A*. Light coming from these sources is produced by synchrotron mechanism whose polarization is directly linked to magnetic field lines, and propagates towards the observer in a curved spacetime. We study the distortions of the gas image by the analytical ray-tracing technique for polarized light artpol, that is adapted for the case of synchrotron emission. We derive analytical expressions for fast conversion of intensity/flux, polarization degree and polarization angle from the local to observer's coordinates. We put emphasis on the non-zero matter elevation above the equatorial plane and non-circular matter motions. Applications of the developed formalism include static polarimetric imaging of the black hole vicinity and dynamic polarimetric signatures of matter close to the compact object.

 - **Abstract**
 The electron density (${n_{\rm e}}$) of the interstellar medium (ISM) in star-forming galaxies is intimately linked to star formation and ionization condition. Using the high-resolution spectra obtained from the JWST NIRSpec micro shutter assembly (MSA) as part of the GLASS-JWST program, we have assembled the largest sample to date (34 galaxies) with individual ${n_{\rm e}}$ measurements derived from the [OII] $\lambda\lambda$3726,29 and/or [SII] $\lambda\lambda$6718,32 doublets at $0.7\lesssim z\lesssim 9.3$. The gravitational lensing magnification by the foreground Abell~2744 cluster allows us to probe ${n_{\rm e}}$ in galaxies with stellar masses ($M_{*}$) down to $\simeq 10^{7.5} M_\odot$ across the entire redshift range. Our analysis reveals that the [OII] flux ratios are marginally anti-correlated with specific star formation rate (sSFR) within a 1-$\sigma$ confidence interval, whereas the [SII] flux ratios show no significant correlation with sSFR. Despite clear correlation between sSFR and redshift within our sample, we find no apparent redshift evolution of ${n_{\rm e}}$ at $z \simeq 1-9$. Our dataset also includes 13 galaxies where ${n_{\rm e}}$ can be measured from both [OII] and [SII]. Contrary to findings at lower redshifts, we observe considerable scatter in ${n_{\rm e}}$ measurements from [OII] and [SII], indicating a complex gaseous environment with significant variations in ${n_{\rm e}}$ in high-redshift galaxies. This work highlights the unique capability of JWST NIRSpec/MSA high-resolution spectroscopy to characterize the detailed physical properties of the ISM in individual high-redshift galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed a new class of high redshift (high-$z$, $z>4$) compact galaxies which are red in the rest-frame optical and blue in the rest-frame UV as V-shaped spectral energy distributions (SEDs), referred to as "Little Red Dots" (LRDs). It is very likely that LRDs host obscured broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs). In the meanwhile, Green pea galaxies (GPs), which are compact dwarf galaxies at low redshift, share various similar properties with high redshift star-forming galaxies. Here we aim to find the connection between the LRDs and GPs hosting broad-line AGNs (BLGPs). With a sample of 19 BLGPs obtained from our previous work, we further identify 7 GPs with V-shaped rest-frame UV-to-optical SEDs that are likely local analogs to LRDs. These V-shaped BLGPs exhibit faint UV absolute magnitudes and sub-Eddington rates similar to those of LRDs. Three of them occupy a similar region as LRDs in the BPT diagram, suggesting they have similar ionization conditions and gas-phase metallicities to LRDs. These similarities suggest that V-shaped BLGPs can be taken as local analogs of high-redshift LRDs. In addition, most (16/19) BLGPs, including 6 V-shaped BLGPs, host over-massive black holes above the local $M_{\rm BH}$-$M_{*}$ relation, making it the first sample of galaxies hosting over-massive black holes at $z<0.4$. These findings will help us learn more about the formation and co-evolution of early galaxies and black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 Dual and lensed quasars are valuable astrophysical targets in many aspects. Dual quasars, considered as the precursors of supermassive black hole binaries, can provide crucial insights into how black hole mergers drive the growth of supermassive black holes and influence the evolution of galaxies. Lensed quasars, formed by the gravitational deflection of a background quasar's light by a massive foreground object, can address key cosmological questions, particularly in refining measurements of the Hubble constant. Despite their significance, the number of confirmed dual and lensed quasars remains limited. Here in this work, we propose a systematic search for dual/lensed quasars using broad emission line profile diagnostics. Our parent sample consists of spectroscopic quasars from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Early Data Release (DESI EDR) and the SDSS DR17 catalog. We identify 30 lensed quasar candidates with similar broad emission line profiles, as well as 36 dual quasar candidates with different profiles. Cross-matching these 66 targets with the HST archival database, we find four overlapping targets, including three previously reported lensed quasars and one newly identified dual quasar candidate. We estimate the black hole masses for the two cores in the same system. The mass ratios are similar in the lensed quasar scenario but vary widely for dual quasars, consistent with the physical nature of these two types. In particular, we identified a dual quasar candidate with the mass ratio exceeding 100 times. We aim to discover more dual/lensed quasar candidates using our method with the upcoming future spectroscopic surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 The high speeds seen in rapidly rotating pulsars after supernova explosions present a longstanding puzzle in astrophysics. Numerous theories have been suggested over the years to explain this sudden "kick" imparted to the neutron star, yet each comes with its own set of challenges and limitations. Key explanations for pulsar kicks include hydrodynamic instabilities in supernovae, anisotropic neutrino emission, asymmetries in the magnetic field, binary system disruption, and physics beyond the Standard Model. Unraveling the origins of pulsar kicks not only enhances our understanding of supernova mechanisms but also opens up possibilities for exploring new physics. In this brief review, we will introduce pulsar kicks, examine the leading hypotheses, and explore future directions for this intriguing phenomenon.
#### The mystery of extremely HI rich galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 The properties of galaxies follow scaling relations related to the physics that govern galaxy evolution. Based on these, we can identify galaxies undergoing specific evolutionary processes such as HI-excess galaxies, which have relatively high HI mass compared to their stellar mass. The possible reasons for this could be either recent gas accretion or an inefficient conversion of the HI to molecular gas. Since recent gas accretion is difficult to prove conclusively, we investigated gas conversion by analysing the molecular gas content of five extremely HI rich galaxies from the HIX galaxy sample. For this, we obtained CO observations of the sample galaxies with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). While we find that our sample galaxies have relatively regularly rotating molecular gas disks, their molecular gas fraction is significantly lower than what is expected from scaling relations and the CO gas has relatively high velocity dispersion.

 Currently, data-intensive scientific applications require vast amounts of compute resources to deliver world-leading science. The climate emergency has made it clear that unlimited use of resources (e.g., energy) for scientific discovery is no longer acceptable. Future computing hardware promises to be much more energy efficient, but without better optimized software this cannot reach its full potential. In this vision paper, we propose a generic AI-driven co-design methodology, using specialized Large Language Models (like ChatGPT), to effectively generate efficient code for emerging computing hardware. We describe how we will validate our methodology with two radio astronomy applications, with sustainability as the key performance indicator. This paper is a modified version of our accepted SuperCode project proposal. We present it here in this form to introduce the vision behind this project and to disseminate the work in the spirit of Open Science and transparency. An additional aim is to collect feedback, invite potential collaboration partners and use-cases to join the project.

 Connecting numerical simulations to observations is essential to understanding the physics of galactic winds. Our Galaxy hosts a large-scale, multi-phase nuclear wind, whose dense gas has been detected using HI and molecular line observations. In this paper, we summarise our recent numerical work devoted to producing synthetic HI observables and measuring the properties of HI gas in galactic wind simulations. We discuss the evolution of radiative cloud systems embedded in star formation-driven galactic winds. Our shock-multicloud models show that multicloud gas streams are able to produce significant fractions of HI gas via recondensation. Our wind-cloud models show that magnetic fields have significant effects on the morphology and spectral signatures of HI gas. Cooling-driven recondensation, hydrodynamic shielding, and magnetic draping promote the survival of dense gas and the development of filamentary outflows. The orientation of magnetic fields also has an effect on synthetic observables, particularly on HI spectral lines. Transverse magnetic fields produce broader spectral lines of HI than aligned magnetic fields. Our models and analysis suggest that the fast-moving HI gas observed in the nuclear wind of our Galaxy may arise from multi-phase flows via recondensation.

 - **Abstract**
 Supernovae (SNe) come in various flavors and are classified into different types based on emission and absorption lines in their spectra. SN candidates are now abundant with the advent of large systematic dynamic sky surveys like the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), however, the identification bottleneck lies in their spectroscopic confirmation and classification. Fully robotic telescopes with dedicated spectrographs optimized for SN follow-up have eased the burden of data acquisition. However, the task of classifying the spectra still largely rests with the astronomers. Automating this classification step reduces human effort, and can make the SN type available sooner to the public. For this purpose, we have developed a deep-learning based program for classifying core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) with ultra-low resolution spectra obtained with the SED-Machine IFU spectrograph on the Palomar 60-inch telescope. The program consists of hierarchical classification task layers, with each layer composed of multiple binary classifiers which are run in parallel to produce a reliable classification. The binary classifiers utilize RNN and CNN architecture and are designed to take multiple inputs, to supplement spectra with g- and r-band photometry from ZTF. On non-host-contaminated and good quality SEDM spectra ("gold" test set), CCSNscore is ~94% accurate (correct classifications) in distinguishing between hydrogen-rich (Type II) and hydrogen-poor (Type Ibc) CCSNe. With the help of light curve input, CCSNscore classifies ~83% of the gold set with high confidence (score >= 0.8 and score-error < 0.05), with ~98% accuracy.

 - **Abstract**
 Bridging theory and observations is a key task to understand galaxy formation and evolution. With the advent of state-of-the-art observational facilities, an accurate modelling of galaxy observables through radiative transfer simulations coupled to hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy formation must be performed. We present a novel pipeline, dubbed RTGen, based on the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code RADMC-3D , and explore the impact of the physical assumptions and modelling of dust and gas phases on the resulting galaxy observables. In particular, we address the impact of the dust abundance, composition, and grain size, as well as model the atomic-to-molecular transition and study the resulting emission from molecular gas. We apply Monte Carlo radiative transfer a posteriori to determine the dust temperature in six different hydrodynamic simulations of isolated galaxies. Afterwards, we apply ray tracing to compute the spectral energy distribution, as well as continuum images and spectral line profiles. We find our pipeline to predict accurate spectral energy distribution distributions of the studied galaxies, as well as continuum and CO luminosity images, in good agreement with literature results from both observations and theoretical studies. In particular, we find the dust modelling to have an important impact on the convergence of the resulting predicted galaxy observables, and that an adequate modelling of dust grains composition and size is required. We conclude that our novel framework is ready to perform high-accuracy studies of the observables of the ISM, reaching few tens percent convergence under the studied baseline configuration. This will enable robust studies of galaxy formation, and in particular of the nature of massive clumps in high-redshift galaxies, through the generation of mock images mimicking observations from state-of-the-art facilities such as JWST and ALMA.
