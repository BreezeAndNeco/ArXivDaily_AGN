 - **Abstract**
 Observations suggest an SMBH-host coevolution. We consider the mass and energy flow in a bulge suffused by gases of varying temperatures. By assuming the rate of energy flow independent of the distance from the bulge center and the local virial equilibrium for permeated gases, a key parameter $\varepsilon_b$ was identified that quantifies the rate of mass and energy flow in gases and the efficiency of gas cooling and thus regulates the coevolution of SMBHs and hosts. Using Illustris simulations, we found $\varepsilon_b\propto (1+z)^{5/2}$. A higher $\varepsilon_b$ in the early Universe means a more efficient gas cooling that allows initial rapid growth of SMBHs and hosts. This simple theory, characterized by $\varepsilon_b$, provides the dominant mean cosmic evolution of SMBHs and hosts. All other transient phenomena may only contribute to the dispersion around mean evolution. Relevant scaling laws involving $\varepsilon_b$ were identified. For host galaxies, the mass-size relation $M_b\propto \varepsilon_b^{2/3}r_b^{5/3}G^{-1}$, dispersion-size relation $\sigma_b^2\propto(\varepsilon_b r_b)^{2/3}\propto (1+z)$, or the mass-dispersion relation $M_b\propto \varepsilon_b^{-1}G^{-1}\sigma_b^5$ were identified, where size $r_b\propto (1+z)^{-1}$. For SMBHs, three evolution phases were found involving an initial rapid growth stage with a rising luminosity $L_B\propto (\varepsilon_b M_{BH})^{4/5}$, a transition stage with a declining $L_B\propto \varepsilon_b^2 M_{BH} \propto (1+z)^5$, and a dormant stage with $L_B\propto (\varepsilon_b M_{BH})^{4/3}$. Results suggest a rapid initial super-Eddington growth with a new redshift-dependent luminosity limit $L_X\propto\varepsilon_b^{4/5}M_{BH}^{4/5}G^{-1/5}c$, in contrast to the Eddington limit. Analytical solutions are formulated for the BH and AGN mass functions and AGN duty cycle and predict a slope of -1/5 for the faint-end luminosity function.

 - **Abstract**
 Highly collimated outflows (jets) are observed across a wide range of astrophysical systems involving the accretion of material onto central objects, from supermassive black holes in active galaxies to proto-brown dwarfs and stellar-mass black holes. Despite the diversity of their driving sources, it is believed that all jets are different manifestations of a single universal phenomenon. However, a unified explanation for their ejection and collimation remains elusive. In this study we present the first rotation measure analysis of the polarized synchrotron emission ever performed in a protostellar radio jet, which allows us to reveal its true 3D magnetic structure. Unlike extragalactic radio jets, which often exhibit faint counterjets, protostellar radio jets allow both the jet and the counterjet to be analyzed. This exceptional circumstance allows us to unveil the magnetic field structure of both components. Our findings provide the first solid evidence for a helical magnetic field within a protostellar jet, supporting the universality of the jet collimation mechanism.

 - **Abstract**
 The early evolution of protostellar, star-forming discs, including their density structure, turbulence, magnetic dynamics, and accretion variability, remains poorly understood. We present high-resolution magnetohydrodynamic simulations, using adaptive mesh refinement to capture detailed disc dynamics down to sub-AU scales. Starting from initial conditions derived from a molecular cloud simulation, we model the collapse of a dense core into a protostellar disc over 10,000 yr following sink particle (star) formation, achieving a maximum effective resolution of 0.63 AU. This simulation traces the evolution of the disc density, accretion rates, turbulence, and magnetic field structures. We find that the protostellar disc grows to a diameter of approximately 100 AU, with mass accretion occurring in episodic bursts influenced by the turbulence of the core from which the disc builds up. The disc is highly turbulent with a sonic Mach number of $\sim2$. The magnetic field is wound up by rotational motions, generating a magneto-centrifugal outflow, while episodic accretion events within the disc cause intermittent increases in mass and magnetic energy density, resulting in an equipartition of the thermal and magnetic pressure and an Alfvén Mach number of ~ 2. The disc density profiles steepen over time, following a power law consistent with observed young stellar discs and the minimum mass solar nebula. These results underscore the role of turbulence in early accretion variability and offer new insights into the physical and magnetic structure of young protostellar discs.
#### A novel Bayesian approach for decomposing the radio emission of quasars: II. Link between quasar radio emission and black hole mass

 - **Abstract**
 Whether the mass of supermassive black hole ($M_\mathrm{BH}$) is directly linked to the quasar radio luminosity remains a long-debated issue, and understanding the role of $M_\mathrm{BH}$ in the evolution of quasars is pivotal to unveiling the mechanism of AGN feedback. In this work, based on a two-component Bayesian model, we examine how $M_\mathrm{BH}$ affects the radio emission from quasars, separating the contributions from host galaxy star formation (SF) and AGN activity. By modelling the radio flux density distribution of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) quasars from the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey Data Release 2, we find no correlation between $M_\mathrm{BH}$ and SF rate (SFR) at any mass for quasars at a given redshift and bolometric luminosity. The same holds for AGN activity across most $M_\mathrm{BH}$ values; however, quasars with the top 20\% most massive SMBHs are 2 to 3 times more likely to host strong radio jets than those with lower-mass SMBHs at similar redshift and luminosity. We suggest defining radio quasar populations by their AGN and SF contributions instead of radio loudness; our new definition unifies previously divergent observational results on the role of $M_\mathrm{BH}$ in quasar radio emissions. We further demonstrate that this radio enhancement in quasars with the 20\% most massive SMBHs affects only the $\sim5\%$ most radio bright quasars at a given redshift and bolometric luminosity. We discuss possible physical origins of this radio excess in the most massive and radio-bright quasar population, which remains an interest for future study.

 - **Abstract**
 The dynamic properties of molecular clouds are set by the interplay of their self-gravity, turbulence, external pressure and magnetic fields. Extended surveys of Galactic molecular clouds typically find that their kinetic energy ($E_{\rm k}$) counterbalances their self-gravitational energy ($E_{\rm g}$), setting their virial parameter $\alpha_{\rm vir}=2E_{\rm k}/|E_{\rm g}|\approx1$. However, past studies either have been biased by the use of optically-thick lines or have been limited within the solar neighborhood and the inner Galaxy (Galactocentric radius $R_{\rm gc}<R_{\rm gc,\odot} \approx 8$ kpc). Here we present sensitive mapping observations of optically thin $^{13}$CO lines towards molecular clouds in the low-metallicity Galactic outer disk ($R_{\rm gc}\sim9-24$ kpc). By combining archival data from the inner Galaxy and four nearby metal-poor dwarf galaxies, we reveal a systematic trend of $\alpha_{\rm vir}$, which declines from supervirial dynamic states in metal-rich clouds to extremely subvirial dynamic states in metal-poor clouds. In these metal-poor environments, turbulence alone is insufficient to counterbalance the self-gravity of a cloud. A cloud-volumetric magnetic field may replace turbulence as the dominant cloud-supporting mechanism in low-metallicity conditions, for example, the outermost galactic disks, dwarf galaxies and galaxies in the early Universe, which would then inevitably impact the initial conditions for star formation in such environments.

 - **Abstract**
 X-ray observations collected over the last decades have revealed a strongly variable X-ray signal within the Milky Way's Galactic center, interpreted as X-ray echoes from its supermassive black hole, Sgr A*. These echoes are traced by the strong Fe K$\alpha$ fluorescent line at 6.4 keV of which its intensity is proportional to the density of the illuminated molecular gas. Over time, the echo scans through molecular clouds (MCs) in our Galactic center, revealing their 3D structure and highlighting their densest parts. While previous studies have utilized spectral line doppler shifts along with kinematic models to constrain the geometry of the CMZ or to study the structure of individual clouds, these methods have limitations, particularly in the turbulent region of the CMZ. We use archival Chandra X-ray data to construct one of the first 3D representations of one prominent MC, the Stone Cloud, located at (l = 0.068°, b = -0.076°) at a distance of ~20pc from Sgr A* in projection. Using the Chandra X-ray Observatory, we followed the X-ray echo in this cloud from 2008 to 2017. We combine this data with 1.3 mm dust continuum emission observed with the Submillimeter Array (SMA) and the Herschel Space Observatory to re-construct the 3D structure of the cloud and estimate the column densities for each year's observed slice. The analysis of the X-ray echoes along with velocities from SMA molecular line data indicate that the structure of the Stone cloud can be described as a very diffuse background with multiple dense clumps throughout.

 - **Abstract**
 Astronomers have used observations of the Galactic gas and dust via infrared, microwave, and radio to study molecular clouds in extreme environments such as the Galactic center. More recently, X- ray telescopes have opened up a new wavelength range in which to study these molecular clouds. Previous flaring events from SgrA* propagate X-rays outwards in all directions, and these X-rays interact with the surrounding molecular gas, illuminating different parts of the clouds over time. We use a combination of X-ray observations from Chandra and molecular gas tracers (line data from Herschel and the Submillimeter Array) to analyze specific features in the Sticks cloud, one of three clouds in the Three Little Pigs system in the Central Molecular Zone (Galactic longitude and latitude of 0.106 and -0.082 degrees respectively). We also present a novel X-ray tomography method we used to create 3-D map of the Sticks cloud. By combining X-ray and molecular tracer observations, we are able to learn more about the environment inside the Sticks cloud.

 - **Abstract**
 This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of weak gravitational lensing and its current applications in cosmology. We begin by introducing the fundamental concepts of gravitational lensing and derive the key equations for the deflection angle, lensing potential, convergence, and shear. We explore how weak lensing can be used as a cosmological probe, discussing cosmic shear, galaxy-galaxy lensing, and their combination with galaxy clustering in the 3$\times$2pt analysis. The chapter covers the theoretical framework for modeling lensing observables, shear estimation techniques, and major systematic effects such as intrinsic alignments and baryonic feedback. We review the current results of weak lensing cosmology from major surveys and outline prospects for future advancements in the field.

 - **Abstract**
 The discovery of the solar activity cycle was linked from the outset to the observation of the temporal variability of sunspots, which we know to be the result of complex processes associated with the dynamics of inner layers. Numerous recent studies have highlighted changes in the Sun's Near-Surface Shear Layer (NSSL), pointing to the role of the leptocline, a shallow and sharp rotational shear layer in the top around 8 Mm. The leptocline, mainly characterized by a strong radial rotational gradient at middle latitudes and self-organized meridional flows, is the cradle of numerous phenomena: opacity, superadiabaticity, and turbulent pressure changes; the hydrogen and helium ionization processes; a sharp decrease in the sound speed; and, probably, variations of the seismic radius associated with a nonmonotonic expansion of subsurface layers with depth. In addition, the leptocline may play a key role in forming the magnetic butterfly diagram. Such results are a starting point for further systematic investigations of the structure and dynamics of this layer, which will lead to a better understanding of solar activity.

 - **Abstract**
 The work investigates the features of galactic cosmic ray density and anisotropy behavior and their relation to solar sources, interplanetary and geomagnetic disturbances from May 8 to May 13, 2024. During this time, powerful solar flares and fast CMEs were recorded, leading to registration of an extreme geomagnetic storm along with one of the most significant Forbush effects for the entire observation period. All the calculations of cosmic ray characteristics are made using the data of global neutron monitor network and unique methods maintained at IZMIRAN: the Global Survey Method and the Ring of Stations Method. It is determined that the magnitude of Forbush effect under study was 15.7% (for particles with 10 GV rigidity) and as an extreme geomagnetic storm was recorded there was a significant magnetospheric effect observed in the data of neutron monitors (~4%).

 - **Abstract**
 After the first multi-messenger observation of a binary neutron star (BNS) merger powering a short-duration gamma-ray burst (GRB), GW170817-GRB 170817A, remarkable effort is ongoing to unravel the evolution of the collimated, relativistic outflow (or jet) that was launched during the merger and fed the GRB event, imprinting its angular structure onto the follow-up afterglow signal. Current theoretical models, based on relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic (RMHD) simulations, offer detailed insights into the launch and propagation processes that govern jet evolution. Notably, these simulations point out that jet injection parameters, such as luminosity, magnetization, power decay time scale, and launch time relative to merger, play a crucial role. However, the impact of these parameters is typically investigated within simplified jet propagation environments, lacking a direct connection with a realistic BNS merger aftermath. In this work, we present the first suite of 3D RMHD simulations exploring the influence of such parameters on the propagation of magnetized incipient GRB jets injected into magnetized environments directly imported from the outcome of a general-relativistic MHD BNS merger simulation. Our results demonstrate that, alongside the injection parameters, the BNS merger environment has a central role in shaping the overall jet evolution. Specifically, under identical jet parameters, the fate of an incipient jet (whether it successfully breaks out or becomes choked) depends strongly on the properties of such environment. Further quantitative comparison between realistic and simplified environments reveals major differences, emphasizing the importance of incorporating the former for accurate modeling.
#### Probing Spectral Evolution and Intrinsic Variability of Mkn\,421: A Multi-Epoch AstroSat Study of X-ray Spectra

 - **Abstract**
 Our study presents a time-resolved X-ray spectral analysis of Mkn 421, using AstroSat observations taken during different epochs between 2016 and 2019. The variability of the source in X-rays is utilized to investigate the evolution of its spectral properties. Each observation period was divided into segments of about 10 ks, and we employed three forms of particle distributions: broken-power law (BPL), log-parabola (LP), and power-law with maximum electron energy (xi-max model) undergoing synchrotron losses to fit the broad X-ray spectrum in each segment. We observed that all of these models provided good fits to the spectra. In the case of the broken-power law model, we investigated the relationship between normalized particle density at an energy less than the break energy and the index before the break. The results revealed an inverse correlation between the index and particle density with no time delay. Additionally, correlations between spectral parameters were used to determine the pivot energy. We observed that the pivot energy remained the same across the observations. For xi-max and LP models, we define analogous pivot energies and show that they also do not vary, indicating the model-independent nature of the result. The constant pivot energy suggests that the source's variability arises from index variations and not due to changes in the normalization. Consequently, parameters such as magnetic field strength, Doppler factor, etc., do not contribute to the source's variability. Instead, variations are primarily associated with the acceleration or escape timescales of emitted particles within the source.
#### Reflection-dominated Compton-thick AGN Candidates in the SRG/eROSITA Lockman Hole Survey

 - **Abstract**
 We search for reflection-dominated Compton-thick active galactic nuclei (CT AGN) candidates in the Lockman Hole region using the data of SRG/eROSITA Lockman Hole survey. We selected sources with anomalously hard photon indices in the $0.3 - 8.0$ keV band, untypical for type I AGN. In particular, we required that the upper end of the $90\%$ error interval did not exceed a fiducial boundary of $\Gamma=1.3$. We found 291 sources which constitute a rare subpopulation among extragalactic X-ray sources detected by eROSITA in the Lockman Hole field, $\approx 5\%$. These sources constitute the eROSITA sample of CT AGN candidates in the Lockman Hole field. We further divide the sources into three categories depending on the availability of reliable redshift and statistically significant detection of intrinsic absorption. We present two catalogues: the bright sample (37 sources) and the faint one (254). We estimate the fraction and sky density of reflection-dominated CT AGN candidates. We show examples of individual spectra and use stacking analysis to search for possible redshift evolution of their properties with redshift. We analyse combined eROSITA spectra of bright sources of different categories with a physically motivated spectral model UXCLUMPY and find them fully consistent with the fits to the about $\sim 1$ Msec XMM-Newton data for one of our reflection-dominated CT candidates, Type 2 galaxy $\text{SRGe J105348.6+573032}$. The catalogues of CT AGN candidates could be a good starting point for planning future studies and follow-ups at all wavelengths.
#### Global 3-D Simulations of Magnetospheric Accretion: II. Hot Spots, Equilibrium Torque, Episodic Wind, and Midplane Outflow

 - **Abstract**
 Global 3-D magnetohydrodynamical simulations have been conducted to study magnetospheric accretion around stars with various spin rates. For slow rotators, characterized by a fastness parameter $\omega_s\lesssim 0.78$, the disk's inner edge at the magnetospheric truncation radius becomes unstable to the interchange instability, leading to intruding filaments which produce hot spots closer to the stellar equator. Depending on spin rate, slow rotators can be in ``chaotic'' or ``ordered'' unstable regimes. For fast rotators, the interchange instability is suppressed by the super-Keplerian rotation beyond the corotation radius, and hot spots are generated only through polar accretion. Low- and mid-energy flux hot spots cover $\lesssim20\%$ and $\lesssim3\%$ of the surface, with faster rotators tending to produce hotter spots. Beyond the truncation radius, angular momentum transfers from the disk surface to the midplane, resulting in surface accretion and midplane outflow. The midplane outflow may transport thermally processed materials (e.g. those in chondrites) to the outer disk. Field inflation generates episodic winds with mass-loss rates $\sim 1\%-40\%$ of the accretion rate, depending on stellar spin. Frequent magnetic reconnections lead to efficient star-disk coupling. We derive the torque exerted by the disk on the star as a function of stellar spin. For fast rotators/propellers, both spin-down torque and disk wind rate increase dramatically with stellar spin. The equilibrium spin state occurs at $\omega_s\sim0.7$, with wind/jet speeds ($\sim$500 km/s) and mass loss rates ($\sim10\%$ accretion rate) aligning with observations. Most results are insensitive to disk thickness. Finally, we present testable predictions for how observables vary with stellar spin.
#### Exploring Multiple Stellar Populations in Globular Clusters with Euclid: A Theoretical Overview and Insights from NGC 6397

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the behavior of multiple stellar populations in globular clusters (GCs) using photometric diagrams constructed with Euclid photometry. By employing synthetic spectra and isochrones that incorporate the chemical differences between first-population (1P) stars, resembling field stars, and second-population (2P) stars, enriched in helium and nitrogen but depleted in carbon and oxygen, we identify, from a theoretical perspective, the color-magnitude diagrams and the chromosome maps most effective at distinguishing these populations within GCs. Euclid photometry proves to be a powerful tool for identifying multiple populations among M-dwarfs, as 1P and 2P stars form distinct sequences in well-chosen photometric diagrams, driven by differences in the strength of oxygen-based molecular features, such as water vapor. To validate our theoretical findings, we analyzed Euclid photometry and astrometry of the GC NGC 6397, complemented by photometric and astrometric data from the Hubble Space Telescope and James Webb Space Telescope, enabling a comprehensive study of its stellar populations across a wide field of view. We find that the 1P constitutes about 30% of the M-dwarfs in NGC 6397, with the fraction of 1P stars remaining consistent across different stellar masses and throughout the entire field of view. 2P stars exhibit an [O/Fe] depletion of about 0.3 dex relative to 1P stars, and both populations display isotropic proper motions. This study represents the first comprehensive analysis of multiple populations among M-dwarfs across a wide field of view, demonstrating that Euclid photometry is a powerful instrument for investigating multiple populations in GCs.

 - **Abstract**
 We present radio polarimetric images of 12 Seyfert and Low-Ionization Nuclear Emission-line Region (LINER) galaxies belonging to the Centre for Astrophysics (CfA)+12 micron sample exhibiting kiloparsec-scale radio outflows (KSRs). These observations have been carried out at 10 GHz with Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) in D-array and at 1.4 GHz with the BnA$\rightarrow$A array configurations. We find signatures of organized magnetic (B-) field structures in the cores, jets and lobes of these galaxies. The linear polarization fraction varies from a few per cent in the cores to $47\pm18$ per cent in the lobes. The inferred B-fields are toroidal in the cores of several sources making them consistent with the presence of either a sheath-like or a wind-like component surrounding the jet. The in-band spectral index images typically show the presence of flat/inverted spectrum cores and steep spectrum lobes. Radio cores with flatter spectra are found to have lower Eddington ratios while the steeper ones have higher. A strong correlation is observed between the Seyfert/LINER radio outflow properties and the mass of the supermassive black holes (SMBHs); correlations with Eddington ratios are weaker. We find signatures of jet-medium interaction and both positive and negative AGN feedback in these sources. Overall, our study indicates that radio-quiet (RQ) AGN with KSRs possess radio outflows driven by magnetic fields anchored to their black holes - accretion disks, which significantly impact their environments.

 - **Abstract**
 We used a supervised machine learning algorithm (probabilistic random forest) to classify ~130 million sources in the VISTA Survey of the Magellanic Clouds (VMC). We used multi-wavelength photometry from optical to far-infrared as features to be trained on, and spectra of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), galaxies and a range of stellar classes including from new observations with the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) and SAAO 1.9m telescope. We also retain a label for sources that remain unknown. This yielded average classifier accuracies of ~79% (SMC) and ~87% (LMC). Restricting to the 56,696,719 sources with class probabilities (P$_{class}$) > 80% yields accuracies of ~90% (SMC) and ~98% (LMC). After removing sources classed as 'Unknown', we classify a total of 707,939 (SMC) and 397,899 (LMC) sources, including > 77,600 extragalactic sources behind the Magellanic Clouds. The extragalactic sources are distributed evenly across the field, whereas the Magellanic sources concentrate at the centres of the Clouds, and both concentrate in optical/IR colour-colour/magnitude diagrams as expected. We also test these classifications using independent datasets, finding that, as expected, the majority of X-ray sources are classified as AGN (554/883) and the majority of radio sources are classed as AGN (1756/2694) or galaxies (659/2694), where the relative AGN-galaxy proportions vary substantially with radio flux density. We have found: > 49,500 hitherto unknown AGN candidates, likely including more AGN dust dominated sources which are in a critical phase of their evolution; > 26,500 new galaxy candidates and > 2800 new Young Stellar Object (YSO) candidates.

 - **Abstract**
 Radio searches for single pulses provide the opportunity to discover one-off events, fast transients and some pulsars that might otherwise be missed by conventional periodicity searches. The MeerTRAP real-time search pipeline operates commensally to observations with the MeerKAT telescope. Here, we report on 26 new Galactic radio transients, mostly rotating radio transients (RRATs) and also the detection of one RRAT and two pulsars that were independently discovered by other surveys. The dispersion measures of two of the new sources marginally exceed the Galactic contribution depending on the electron density model used. Using a simple method of fitting a Gaussian function to individual pulses, and obtaining positions of arcsecond accuracy from image-based localisations using channelised voltage data from our transient buffer, we have derived timing solutions spanning multiple years for five sources. The timing parameters imply ages of several Myr and low surface magnetic field strengths which is characteristic of RRATs. We were able to measure spin periods for eight more transients, including one source which appears to rotate every 17.5 seconds. A majority of the sources have only been seen in one observation, sometimes despite multiple return visits to the field. Some sources exhibit complex emission features like component switching and periodic microstructure.

 - **Abstract**
 Compact, star-forming galaxies with high star formation rate surface densities ($\Sigma_{\text{SFR}}$) are often efficient Lyman continuum (LyC) emitters at $z\leq 4.5$, likely as intense stellar feedback creates low-density channels that allow photons to escape. Irregular or disturbed morphologies, such as those resulting from mergers, can also facilitate LyC escape by creating anisotropic gas distributions. We investigate the influence of galaxy morphology on LyC production and escape at redshifts $5 \leq z \leq 7$ using observations from various \textit{James Webb Space Telescope} (JWST) surveys. Our sample consists of 436 sources, which are predominantly low-mass ($\sim 10^{8.15} M_\odot$), star-forming galaxies with ionizing photon efficiency ($\xi_{\rm ion}$) values consistent with canonical expectations. Since direct measurements of $f_{\rm esc}$ are not possible during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), we predict $f_{\rm esc}$ for high-redshift galaxies by applying survival analysis to a subsample of LyC emitters from the Low-Redshift Lyman Continuum Survey (LzLCS), selected to be direct analogs of reionization-era galaxies. We find that these galaxies exhibit on average modest predicted escape fractions ($\sim 0.04$). Additionally, we assess the correlation between morphological features and LyC emission. Our findings indicate that neither $\xi_{\rm ion}$ nor the predicted $f_{\rm esc}$ values show a significant correlation with the presence of merger signatures. This suggests that in low-mass galaxies at $z \geq 5$, strong morphological disturbances are not the primary mechanism driving LyC emission and leakage. Instead, compactness and star formation activity likely play a more pivotal role in regulating LyC escape.

 - **Abstract**
 The disintegrating ultra-short period rocky exoplanet K2-22b periodically emits dusty clouds in a dynamically chaotic process resulting in a variable transit depth from 0-1.3%. The effluents that sublimate off the surface and condense out in space are probably representative of the formerly interior layers convectively transported to the molten surface. Transmission spectroscopy of these transiting clouds reveal spectral fingerprints of the interior composition of this rocky world. We used JWST's Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) as a low-resolution slitless spectrograph to observe four predicted transit windows for K2-22b. For each observation, we extracted a transmission spectrum over the spectral range of 4.3-11.8 $\mu$m. We detect one transit at high significance and two at low significance. We find that the data 1) disfavor featureless, iron-dominated core material, 2) are consistent with some form of magnesium silicate minerals, likely from mantle material, and 3) show a distinct and unexpected feature at $\sim$5 $\mu$m. The unexpected feature, also seen weakly in the low-significance transits, is consistent with some gas features, possibly NO and/or CO$_2$. These findings warrant further study to improve the constraints on the composition of this disintegrating rocky world.

 - **Abstract**
 The largest electric fields between 18 and 30 solar radii are in narrow band waves simultaneously observed at a few Hz (somewhat above the local proton gyrofrequency) and a few hundred Hz (far below the lower hybrid frequency), with the higher frequency wave triggered at specific phases of the lower frequency wave. This wave pair, called triggered ion acoustic waves (TIAW), has been shown to both be physical and to occur at times of electron heating. A theory of electron heating and acceleration by the low frequency wave has been presented. While this theory and the TIAW results strongly suggest the presence of low frequency electric fields that are parallel to the local magnetic field, such fields have not been directly observed. In this paper, such parallel electric field observations are reported and TIAW are further described to conclude that they occur during about 75 percent of the Parker Solar Probe passes through 18 to 30 solar radii and, when present, they are the dominant wave signal, lasting for hours. In the presence of these parallel electric fields, electrons are heated while, in their absence, there is no electron heating. That there is no heating between 18 and 30 solar radii in the absence of TIAW is a most significant result because it invalidates other proposed mechanisms that predict heating in this radial range all of the time.
