 - **Abstract**
 Intensity Mapping (IM) of the 21-cm line of the neutral hydrogen (\textsc{Hi}) has become a compelling new technique to map the large-scale structure of the Universe. One of the main challenges is the presence of strong foreground emissions of several orders of magnitude larger than the \textsc{Hi}~signal. Here, we implement a version of the Principal Component Analysis, a blind component-separation technique, based on a kind of spherical wavelets called needlets. These functions exploit double localization both in real and in harmonic space. We test Need-PCA performances on a set of maps that simulates the SKA MID radio telescope in the AA4 configuration. We compare our results with other component separation methods such as Generalised Morphological Component Analysis (GMCA) and Generalized Needlet Internal Linear Combination (GNILC). All the methods have comparable results, recovering the \textsc{Hi}~signal within 10\% accuracy across the frequency channels, in the multipole range 30 $\lesssim \ell \lesssim$ 136. We also test our pipeline in the presence of systematics such as polarization leakage. We find that the cleaning methods are insensitive to the presence of such systematic, yielding the same results as in the leakage-free case.

 - **Abstract**
 A generic prediction of particle dark matter theories is that a large population of dark matter substructures should reside inside the host haloes of galaxies. In gravitational imaging, strong gravitational lens observations are used to detect individual objects from this population, if they are large enough to perturb the strongly lensed images. We show here that low-mass haloes, below the individually detectable mass limit, have a detectable effect on the lensed images when in large numbers, which is the case in cold dark matter (CDM). We find that, in CDM, this population causes an excess of 40 per cent in the number of detected subhaloes for HST-like strong lens observations. We propose a pseudo-mass function to describe this population, and fit for its parameters from the detection data. We find that it mostly consists of objects two orders of magnitude in mass below the detection limit of individual objects. We show that including this modification, so that the effect of the population is correctly predicted, can dramatically improve the available constraints on dark matter from strong lens observations. We repeat our experiments using models that contain varying amounts of angular structure in the lens galaxy. We find that these multipole perturbations are strongly degenerate with the population signal, to an even greater extent than with individual subhaloes. This further highlights the need for better understanding of the angular mass structure of lens galaxies, so that the maximum information can be extracted from strong lens observations for dark matter inference.
#### No Luminous Little Red Dots: A Sharp Cutoff in Their Luminosity Function

 - **Abstract**
 One of the most surprising results of early James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations is the discovery of an abundance of red, compact, broad-line objects dubbed "little red dots" (LRDs) at $z>4$. Their spatial density ($\sim10^{-4}$-$10^{-5}\,\mathrm{cMpc^{-3}}$) is 100 times more abundant than UV-selected quasars at those redshift if one extrapolates the quasar luminosity function (QLF) down to the LRD regime. However, whether LRDs dominate black hole accretion at quasar-like luminosities ($L_\mathrm{bol}\gtrsim 10^{45-46}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$) remains unanswered, as probing the bright end of the LRD luminosity function requires a much larger area than those able to be surveyed by JWST. In this work, we present our search for the brightest LRDs ($K<23.7$) at $4.5<z<4.9$ using wide-area multiwavelength imaging surveys from the near-UV to the infrared bands. With over 15 square degrees of sky coverage, we only identify one single LRD candidate at $z_\mathrm{phot}\approx4.6$, which translates into a spatial density of $n(M_{5100}<-23.5)\approx10^{-8}\,\mathrm{cMpc^{-3}}$ -- this is nearly 10 times less abundant than the UV-selected quasars at similar optical luminosity. When combined with the LRD sample identified by JWST at the same redshift range, we find a sharp cutoff in the optical luminosity function at $\lambda L_{5100}\approx2.5\times10^{44}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$, while the QLF turnover occurs at $\gtrsim20$ times higher luminosity. We therefore confirm the exclusively low-luminosity nature of LRDs, ruling out that LRDs are the counter parts of quasars. Furthermore, we speculate that, if the shape of the luminosity function holds up, it points to LRDs being powered by low-mass black holes with a narrow range of Eddington-level accretion rates.

 - **Abstract**
 The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed a previously unknown population of compact, red galaxies at $z \sim 5$, known as "Little Red Dots" (LRDs). With effective radii of $\sim 100$ pc and stellar masses of $10^9-10^{11} \, \rm M_\odot$, a purely stellar interpretation implies extreme central densities, $\rho_\star\sim10^4-10^5 \, \rm M_\odot \, pc^{-3}$ and in some cases up to $\sim 10^9 \, \rm M_\odot \, pc^{-3}$, far exceeding those of globular clusters. At such densities, the dynamical friction time for $10 \, \rm M_\odot$ stars in the central $0.1$ pc is $< 0.1$ Myr, driving rapid mass segregation. We investigate the dynamical consequences of such an environment using: (i) a Fokker-Planck analysis of long-term core evolution, (ii) an analytical model for the collisional growth of a very massive star (VMS), and (iii) direct $N$-body simulations. All approaches show that runaway collisions produce a VMS with mass $9\times10^3 < M_{\rm VMS} \, [\rm M_\odot] < 5\times10^4$ within $<1$ Myr. Once the supply of massive stars is depleted, the VMS contracts on a $\sim 8000$ yr Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale and undergoes a general relativistic collapse, leaving a massive black hole of mass $M_\bullet \sim 10^4 \, \rm M_\odot$. We conclude that LRDs are natural nurseries for the formation of heavy black hole seeds via stellar-dynamical processes. This pathway produces seed number densities that far exceed those expected from direct collapse models, and, owing to the dense residual stellar core, can sustain high rates of tidal disruption events.
#### Migration and Evolution of giant ExoPlanets (MEEP) II: Super-Jupiters and Lithium-rich Host Stars

 - **Abstract**
 Although hot Jupiters were the first exoplanets discovered orbiting main sequence stars, the dominant mechanisms through which they form and evolve are not known. To address the questions surrounding their origins, the Migration and Evolution of giant ExoPlanets (MEEP) survey aims to create a complete, magnitude-limited ($G<$12.5) sample of hot Jupiters that can be used to constrain the frequency of different migration pathways. NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite provides the unique combination of sky-coverage and photometric precision to achieve this goal, which will likely be a key result of the mission. In this second installment of the MEEP survey, we reanalyze one benchmark hot Jupiter system, TOI-4138, and discover four additional super-Jupiters which are each more than five times as massive as Jupiter: TOI-4773 b, TOI-5261 b, TOI-5350 b, and TOI-6420 b. One of these planets, TOI-5261 b, is 11.49 times the mass of Jupiter, nearly massive enough to ignite deuterium fusion, and has an eccentric ($e = 0.1585$) orbit. TOI-4138, TOI-4773, TOI-5350, and TOI-6420 each have lithium absorption features in their spectra. TOI-4138 is an F-type subgiant with a lithium equivalent width of $120. \pm 13$ mÅ, which is $\sim 4.5\sigma$ larger than the median lithium equivalent width of a control sample of 1381 similar stars, making TOI-4138 a compelling candidate for planetary engulfment.

 - **Abstract**
 Mass loss is a key physical process in the evolution of massive stars, the impact of which propagates into galactic evolution, population synthesis models, the interpretation of high-redshift galaxies, and explosive events such as supernovae. However, there are currently substantial uncertainties in the low-metallicity, low-luminosity thin wind regime where classical diagnostics (H-alpha and ultraviolet, UV, P Cygni profiles) yield wind momenta that are 1 to 2 orders of magnitude below prescriptions implemented by default in most evolutionary models. Here, we present spectra of the mass-loss diagnostic line Br-alpha in 15 OB-type stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud obtained using the Near Infrared Spectrograph on the James Webb Space Telescope. The line profile morphology, recovered by virtue of the outstanding signal-to-noise ratio of the data and the avoidance of regions with nebular emission, is consistent with predictions based on previous mass-loss rate estimates from optical and UV spectroscopy. Moreover, an initial spectroscopic analysis of sources covering the thin wind regime confirms the low mass-loss rates, indicates a change of slope in the wind-momentum-luminosity relation in this regime with respect to high-luminosity objects, and strengthens the abovementioned discrepancies with commonly used wind-momentum prescriptions.
#### Double-faced white dwarfs and the magnetic inhibition of convection

 - **Abstract**
 About one in five white dwarfs undergoes spectral evolution from a helium atmosphere to hydrogen and then back to helium. These short-lived hydrogen envelopes - the result of residual hydrogen diffusion - are eventually destroyed by either hydrogen or helium convection. An emerging class of double-faced white dwarfs seems to catch this process in the act, with varying amounts of hydrogen across regions of the stellar surface. Here, we quantitatively test the hypothesis that these inhomogeneities are the result of the magnetic inhibition of convection. We compute the critical magnetic field $B_{\rm crit}(M,T_{\rm eff})\sim\sqrt{8\pi P}$ required to inhibit convection in both hydrogen and helium for $0.6-1.2\,M_\odot$ white dwarfs, where $P$ is the pressure at the base of the convection zone. When incorporating the magnetic field consistently into the stellar structure even at high pressures $P>B^2/(8\pi)$, we find that most of the measured magnetic fields $B$ of observed double-faced white dwarfs satisfy $B_{\rm crit}^{\rm H}\lesssim B\lesssim B_{\rm crit}^{\rm He}$, such that the magnetic inhibition of either hydrogen or helium convection could potentially explain the observations. Specifically, order of unity variations in the magnetic field's strength or orientation across the surface could account for the double-faced nature of these stars.
#### Gas in Globular Clusters I: Gas Retention and Its Possible Consequences

 - **Abstract**
 Globular clusters (GCs) host complex stellar populations whose chemical signatures imply early retention and reprocessing of stellar ejecta, yet direct evidence for intracluster gas is lacking. Here we present a unified theoretical framework for the accumulation, fate, and eventual removal of gas released by evolved stars in young GCs, and their implications for the production of multiple stellar populations. Using MIST stellar evolution tracks, we show that low-velocity (< 20 km/s) AGB winds, each released over 10^4 yr, are gravitationally retained in >10^5 MSun clusters. In addition, AGB winds in such clusters collide with each other and the previously retained winds, triggering a rapid `switch' to efficient gas retention. Expected gas retention fractions, mapped across cluster initial mass and size, agree well with the observed second population fractions in Milky Way GCs. We then show that the accumulated gas cannot form new stars because protostellar cores are disrupted by encounters with pre-existing stars over 1 - 10 kyr. Instead, the gas is accreted onto pre-existing main-sequence stars and compact objects. Bondi-Hoyle accretion and time-dependent core-halo models indicate that both white dwarfs and neutron stars can grow and collapse within a few 100 Myr, and that lower-mass main-sequence stars can be `rejuvenated' into the 4 - 6 MSun range required to reproduce key abundance patterns. Therefore, in our model, the multiple populations will be found in sufficiently massive clusters, with the second-population stars being formed from the inner subset of first-population stars that accreted large fractions of their mass from the AGB-processed retained gas. Finally, we argue that a combination of feedback processes will clear the gas by 10^9 yr, thus reproducing the gas-poor conditions observed for present-day clusters.
#### Explosive Dispersal Outflows as a New Class of Fermi Gamma-Ray Sources: The Case of DR21

 - **Abstract**
 We report the first detection of gamma-ray emission from an explosive dispersal outflow in the Milky Way, revealing a new source class of high-energy emission. Using 15 years of Fermi-LAT data in the 0.2 $-$ 500 GeV range, we detect a significant ($ > 35\sigma $) $\gamma$-ray emission spatially coincident with the DR21 outflow, located at a distance of 1.5 kpc in the Cygnus-X star-forming region. The spectrum follows a power-law plus an exponential cutoff model with a spectral index $\Gamma = 2.08\pm0.02$ and $E_{\rm c} = 10089 \pm 2963$~MeV, integrating which we estimate a total $\gamma$-ray luminosity $L_{\gamma} \simeq (2.17\pm 0.15) \times 10^{35}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in the $0.1-500$ GeV band. This $\gamma$-ray emission is spatially coincident with additional multiwavelength data, including allWISE mid-IR and regions of dense gas. By comparing the observed $\gamma$-ray luminosity to the estimated kinetic energy of the outflow inferred from prior studies of DR21, we find that $\leq 15\%$ of the kinetic power of the outflow goes into particle acceleration. Our findings demonstrate that explosive dispersal outflows can contribute significantly to the diffuse $\gamma$-ray background of the Galaxy, highlighting their importance as particle accelerators in star-forming environments.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic ray (CR) feedback in galaxy evolution has seen a theoretical resurgence in the past decade, but significant uncertainties remain in CR transport through the interstellar and circum-galactic media (ISM and CGM). While several works indicate CR effects may be notable in both star-forming and quenched massive galaxies, modeling the vast CR transport parameter space currently allowed by observations is computationally restrictive to survey. Analytic treatments of CR feedback have provided useful insights to potential ramifications in different regimes, but have relied on time-steady assumptions which may not well characterize CR effects at different cosmic epochs and galaxy mass scales. We present semi-analytic and numerical solutions describing the time-dependent evolution of CR pressure in the CGM under simplified assumptions, which allow for quick evaluation of the vast allowable CR transport parameter space. We demonstrate that time-dependent injection from bursty star formation and/or episodic black hole accretion can substantially alter CR pressure profiles, particularly in the outer halos of massive galaxies ($\gtrsim R_{vir}$). Our work further suggests that CR feedback may play a significant role in shaping the matter distribution around massive galaxies ($\gtrsim M_{\textrm{halo}} \sim 10^{13} M_\odot$), and we speculate that these time-dependent effects may connect to observed phenomena like ``Odd Radio Circles". Finally, we benchmark our semi-analytic formalism against a cosmic ray-magnetohydrodynamic (CR-MHD) cosmological zoom-in galaxy simulation directly modeling the CR scattering rate and emergent transport in full generality, highlighting the validity of our approach. We conclude by motivating careful consideration of time-dependent ``softening" effects in sub-grid routines for CR feedback, particularly for use in large cosmological volumes.
#### Hierarchical assembly impedes the inference of stellar mass growth histories for individual galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 Some massive, quiescent galaxies at z>3 appear to contain considerable numbers of old stars (forming at z>7). Works inferring the star formation histories of at least one such galaxy observed with JWST have suggested that the assembly of so much stellar mass so early may challenge the well-established Cold Dark Matter (CDM) cosmological framework, or else indicate extraordinarily high past star formation efficiencies. However, these studies implicitly assume that all the stars in place at the epoch of observation assembled in-situ, i.e. in a single galaxy. In hierarchical models like CDM, massive galaxies assemble following successive mergers of smaller galaxies. Thus, inferences of the growth of stellar mass using the ages of stars within a descendant massive galaxy will be biased. In this paper, I use the TNG100 simulation to quantify this bias across a range of descendant galaxy masses and redshifts, for inferences made for different past epochs. I demonstrate that the assumption of in-situ stellar mass assembly can lead to significant biases in inferred stellar mass histories, with historic (i.e. looking back from the epoch of observation) stellar masses overestimated by over an order of magnitude in some cases. The bias increases with increasing halo mass, for inferences made further from the epoch of observation, and with decreasing descendant galaxy redshift. I derive corrections that can be applied to inferred stellar mass histories for more robust comparisons with dark matter halo mass functions at high redshift.

 - **Abstract**
 Not all galaxies at Cosmic Noon evolve in the same way. It remains unclear how the local environment -- especially the extreme overdensities of protoclusters -- affects stellar mass assembly at high redshift. The stellar mass function (SMF) encodes these processes; comparing SMFs across environments reveals differences in evolutionary history. We present the SMF of the Hyperion proto-supercluster at $z\sim2.5$, one of the largest and most massive protostructures known. This dataset provides the most statistically robust SMF of a single protostructure at $z>2$. By comparing the SMF of overdense peaks within Hyperion to the coeval field, we ask: how early, and how strongly, does a dense environment favor massive galaxies? Using COSMOS2020 photometry with ground-based and new HST grism spectroscopy, we construct a 3D overdensity map that assigns galaxies to peaks, outskirts, or the field. We perform 100 Monte Carlo realizations to propagate redshift and mass uncertainties, and derive SMFs normalized to the field. The peaks show a clear excess of massive galaxies: number densities at $\log(M_*/M_\odot)\sim 11$ are ~10x higher than the field, while those at $\log(M_*/M_\odot)\sim 9.5$ are enhanced by only ~3.5x. By contrast, the outskirts and Hyperion as a whole mirror the field. Environmental effects on stellar mass growth are thus evident by $z\sim 2.5$. The densest regions already host galaxies with accelerated growth, while the global SMF masks this signal. Protostructures therefore begin shaping the high-mass end of the SMF well before cluster quenching, and may drive the elevated star formation at Cosmic Noon.
#### Dust stripping in cluster galaxies: a PRIMA perspective

 - **Abstract**
 The evolution of galaxies in rich environments such as clusters and groups can be significantly perturbed during their interaction with nearby companions (tidal interactions) or with the hot intracluster medium (ICM) trapped within the gravitational potential well of the massive host halo (ram pressure stripping). Both gravitational perturbations and the external pressure exerted by the hot ICM on the galaxy ISM during its high velocity journey within the cluster are able to remove most, if not all of it, producing extended tails of stripped material. Along with the different gas phases (cold atomic and molecular, ionised, hot), these perturbations can remove also dust, thus contributing to the pollution of the ICM. Probe Infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA) is offering a unique opportunity to observe this dust component, a crucial ingredient in the energetic balance of the stripped gas. We analyse how the two instruments onboard of PRIMA, PRIMAger (in imaging and polarimetric mode) and far-IR enhanced survey spectrometer (FIRESS), can be used to observe a selected sample of ram pressure stripped tails detected at other frequencies (HI, CO, Halpha, X-rays). These data can be used to determine the relative distribution of the dust component with respect to that of the other gas phases, derive its temperature, calculate different gas physical parameters (electron density, photoelectric heating efficiency, gas metallicity), and quantify the strength of the turbulent magnetic fields, all fundamental parameters used to constrain the most recent hydrodynamic simulations of gas stripping in clusters. The ultimate aim of this research is that of understanding the fate of the cold stripped material once mixed with the surrounding hot medium and study under which condition it can collapse into giant molecular clouds (GMC) to form new stars.
#### Updated bounds on ultra-light dark matter from the tiniest galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 The particle mass of dark matter (DM) was previously constrained using kinematics of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies to $m > 3 \times 10^{-19}\,\mathrm{eV}$. This constraint, which excludes the "fuzzy" range of ultra-light dark matter from comprising all of the DM, relies on an estimate of the heating rate from fuzzy dark matter (FDM) wave interference using linear perturbation theory. Here, we compare the results of this perturbative calculation to full Schrödinger-Poisson simulations of the evolution of star particles in FDM halos. This comparison confirms theoretical expectations that FDM heating is stronger in fully nonlinear simulations due to the formation of a dense central soliton whose fluctuations enhance gravitational perturbations, and that bounds on the DM particle mass using this perturbative method are indeed conservative. We also show that these bounds are not affected by possible tidal stripping, since for dwarf satellites like Segue 1, the tidal radius is much larger than the observed size of the galaxy. We further show that the constraints on the mass cannot be evaded by invoking DM self-interactions, due to constraints on the self-interaction from large-scale structure. Lastly, we show that if the recently discovered system Ursa Major III/UNIONS I is a galaxy, the observed properties of this object strengthen the lower bound on the DM mass by over an order of magnitude, to $m > 8 \times 10^{-18}\,\mathrm{eV}$, at 95% confidence. This constraint could further be strengthened considerably by more precise measurements of the size and velocity dispersion of this and other similar galaxies, and by using full Schrödinger-Poisson simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 3I/ATLAS was discovered on UT 2025 July 1 and joins a limited but growing population of detected $\sim10^2-10^3$ m scale interstellar objects. In this paper we report photometric observations of 3I/ATLAS from the nights of UT 2025 July 3, UT 2025 July 9, and UT 2025 July 10 obtained with the Southern Astrophysical Research Telescope (SOAR). The photometric observations are taken with the Goodman High Throughput Spectrograph (HTS) in the $r'$-band. These data provide 28 photometric data points to the rapidly growing composite light curve of 3I/ATLAS. They reveal that the object did not exhibit obvious long-term variability in its brightness when these observations were taken. These observations appear to have captured two moderate and independent brightening events on UT 2025 July 9, and UT 2025 July 10. However, we perform a series of stellar contamination, stacking, and aperture experiments that demonstrate that the increases in brightness by $\sim0.8$ magnitudes appear to be a result of poor seeing and stellar contamination by close-proximity field stars. We report the mean brightnesses of 3I/ATLAS on each night of magnitude 18.14, 17.55, and 17.54 for UT 2025 July 3, 9, and 10, respectively. Moreover, the presence of cometary activity in extant images obtained contemporaneously with these data precludes them from revealing insights into the rotation of the nucleus. We conclude that the activity of 3I/ATLAS on UT 2025 July 9 and UT July 10 was consistent with the near-discovery activity levels, with no obvious outburst activity.

 [abridged] Accurately accounting for the AGN phase in galaxy evolution requires a large, clean AGN sample. This is now possible with SRG/eROSITA. The public Data Release 1 (DR1, Jan 31, 2024) includes 930,203 sources from the Western Galactic Hemisphere. The data enable the selection of a large AGN sample and the discovery of rare sources. However, scientific return depends on accurate characterisation of the X-ray emitters, requiring high-quality multiwavelength data. This paper presents the identification and classification of optical and infrared counterparts to eRASS1 sources using Gaia DR3, CatWISE2020, and Legacy Survey DR10 (LS10) with the Bayesian NWAY algorithm and trained priors. Sources were classified as Galactic or extragalactic via a Machine Learning model combining optical/IR and X-ray properties, trained on a reference sample. For extragalactic LS10 sources, photometric redshifts were computed using Circlez. Within the LS10 footprint, all 656,614 eROSITA/DR1 sources have at least one possible optical counterpart; about 570,000 are extragalactic and likely AGN. Half are new detections compared to AllWISE, Gaia, and Quaia AGN catalogues. Gaia and CatWISE2020 counterparts are less reliable, due to the surveys shallowness and the limited amount of features available to assess the probability of being an X-ray emitter. In the Galactic Plane, where the overdensity of stellar sources also increases the chance of associations, using conservative reliability cuts, we identify approximately 18,000 Gaia and 55,000 CatWISE2020 extragalactic sources. We release three high-quality counterpart catalogues, plus the training and validation sets, as a benchmark for the field. These datasets have many applications, but in particular empower researchers to build AGN samples tailored for completeness and purity, accelerating the hunt for the Universe most energetic engines.

 - **Abstract**
 The habitable zone is defined as the orbital region around a star where planetary feedback cycles buffer atmospheric greenhouse gases that, in combination with solar luminosity, maintain surface temperatures suitable for liquid water. Evidence supports the existence of buffering feedbacks on Earth, but whether these same feedbacks are active on other Earth-like planets remains untested, as does the habitable zone hypothesis. While feedbacks are central to the habitable zone concept, one does not guarantee the other-i.e., it is possible that a planet may maintain stable surface conditions at a given solar luminosity without following the predicted $CO_2$ trend across the entire habitable zone. Forthcoming exoplanet observations will provide an opportunity to test both ideas. In anticipation of this and to avoid premature conclusions based on insufficient data, we develop statistical tests to determine how many observations are needed to detect and quantify planetary-scale feedbacks. Our model-agnostic approach assumes only the most generic prediction that holds for any buffering feedback, allowing the observations to constrain feedback behavior. That can then inform next-level questions about what specific physical, chemical, and/or biological feedback processes may be consistent with observational data. We find that [23, 74](95% CI) observations are required to detect feedback behavior within a given solar luminosity range, depending on the sampling order of planets. These results are from tests using conservative error tolerance-a measure used to capture the risk of false positives. Reducing error tolerance lowers the chance of false positives but requires more observations; increasing it reduces the required sample size but raises uncertainty in estimating population characteristics. We discuss these trade-offs and their implications for testing the habitable zone hypothesis.

 - **Abstract**
 Blueshifted absorption is the classic spectroscopic signature of an accretion disc wind in X-ray binaries and cataclysmic variables (CVs). However, outflows can also create pure emission lines, especially at optical wavelengths. Therefore, developing other outflow diagnostics for these types of lines is worthwhile. With this in mind, we construct a systematic grid of 3645 synthetic wind-formed H-alpha line profiles for CVs with the radiative transfer code SIROCCO. Our grid yields a variety of line shapes: symmetric, asymmetric, single- to quadruple-peaked, and even P-Cygni profiles. About 20% of these lines -- our `Gold' sample -- have strengths and widths consistent with observations. We use this grid to test a recently proposed method for identifying wind-formed emission lines based on deviations in the wing profile shape: the `excess equivalent width diagnostic diagram'. We find that our `Gold' sample can preferentially populate the suggested `wind regions' of this diagram. However, the method is highly sensitive to the adopted definition of the line profile `wing'. Hence, we propose a refined definition based on the full-width at half maximum to improve the interpretability of the diagnostic diagram. Furthermore, we define an approximate scaling relation for the strengths of wind-formed CV emission lines in terms of the outflow parameters. This relation provides a fast way to assess whether -- and what kind of -- outflow can produce an observed emission line. All our wind-based models are open-source and we provide an easy-to-use web-based tool to browse our full set of H-alpha spectral profiles.

 - **Abstract**
 The Sun's atmosphere hosts swirling plasma structures, known as solar vortices, which have long been thought to channel wave energy into higher layers. Until now, no direct observations have confirmed their role in the heating of the atmosphere. Here, we present the first direct evidence that solar vortices act as structured waveguides, carrying magnetoacoustic modes (waves that behave like sound waves but travel through magnetized plasma) that leave clear wave-heating signatures. By mapping vortex regions at multiple heights and analysing the waves they contain, we show that magnetoacoustic waves efficiently transfer energy, offset losses from radiation, and dominate energy transport in the lower chromosphere. These results challenge the long-standing assumption that vortices primarily support twisting disturbances traveling along magnetic field lines (Alfven waves), revealing instead that magnetoacoustic modes play the leading role in the lower atmosphere. This redefines the role of vortices in magnetized plasmas and has broader implications for wave-plasma interactions in regions of strong magnetic fields.

 The corona is a crucial region that connects the solar surface to the solar wind and serves as the primary site of solar activity. The 2024 total solar eclipse (TSE) provides a unique opportunity to investigate the large-scale coronal structure. Combined with TSE observations, we study the impact of the magnetic structure of the far-side active region, located in the eastern hemisphere of the Sun that has not yet rotated into the Earth Field-of-View (FoV), on a global Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation. To address the limitation of single-view measurements in the routine synoptic map, we correct the magnetic field in the far-side region by incorporating full-disk magnetograms measured several days after the TSE, allowing us to capture the temporal evolution of the photospheric magnetic field in near real-time. Simulation results demonstrate that the local magnetic field in the far-side active region can significantly influence the global coronal structure by altering the position of the heliospheric current sheet (HCS), and further affect the global distribution of plasma parameters, even in polar regions. A comparison of the simulation results with white-light (WL) TSE + LASCO C2 observations and in situ measurements by the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) reveals that the composite synoptic map improves the accuracy of coronal modeling. This work provides robust support for advancing our understanding of coronal evolution, as well as deepens the link between the photosphere and large-scale coronal structure. Furthermore, it establishes a theoretical foundation for the future development of multi-view, stereoscopic measurements of the photospheric magnetic field.

 - **Abstract**
 Image-based searches have become a complementary approach for identifying pulsars, particularly at MHz frequencies where scattering and high dispersion measures affect high-time resolution observations. In this work, we searched the Galactic Plane (GP) data release from the GaLactic and Extragalactic All-Sky Murchison Widefield Array eXtended (GLEAM-X) survey, a widefield continuum radio survey covering the 72 - 231 MHz frequency range, at the positions of known pulsars in the ATNF catalogue (version 2.6.2) that lie within its sky coverage. We present the spectral energy distribution for 193 known pulsars located at |b| < 11deg. Notably, 106 of these represent the first detections below 400 MHz. We also cross-match the GLEAM-X: GP compact source catalogue with unassociated sources in the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) catalogue, filtering for gamma-ray spectral and variability properties, as well as coincidence with Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). We have identified 106 possible pulsar candidates. This work demonstrates the importance of sensitive, low-frequency Galactic plane surveys for detecting emission from known pulsars and presents a potential way of searching for new pulsar candidates that would otherwise be missed by traditional time-domain searches.

 - **Abstract**
 We derive a relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) theory for a dilute electron-ion gas governed by the Boltzmann-Vlasov equation, using the method of moments. This yields an extended MHD framework beyond standard astrophysical formulations, which typically include only the shear-stress component parllel to the magnetic field. We analyze our framework in the linear regime and show that it leads to the firehose instability when the bakground longitudinal pressure becomes large. In these extreme scenario, the transverse and semi-transverse shear-stress components become large and may play a role in accretion disk dynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 We present our dynamical mass constraints on the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the early-type galaxy NGC 7052 using high spatial-resolution observations of $^{12}$CO(2-1) emission from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The data were obtained during ALMA Cycle 7 and have a synthesized beam size of 0''.29 $\times$ 0''.22 (97 $\times$ 73 pc$^2$). The dynamical model yielded an SMBH mass of $\approx (2.50 \pm 0.37 \, [{\rm statistical}] \pm 0.8 \, [{\rm systematic}]) \times 10^9$ M$_{\odot}$ and a stellar-$I$ band mass-to-light ratio of $\approx 4.08 \pm 0.23\, [{\rm statistical}] \pm 0.4 \, [{\rm systematic}]$ M$_{\odot}$/L$_{\odot}$ ($3\sigma$ confidence intervals). Although our new ALMA observation has three times lower spatial resolution than previous ALMA data, it still resolves the SMBH's sphere of influence with a spatial resolution that is 1.5 times smaller than this sphere radius. While our $M_{\rm BH}$ estimate is fully consistent with the previous determination, the $I$-band mass-to-light ratio is lower by 10%. This difference arises from our improved galaxy mass model, which incorporates both the molecular gas distribution and the extended stellar mass in the outer regions of the galaxy, components that were previously neglected.

 - **Abstract**
 To fulfill the requirements of space object cataloging and enable automated intelligent responses to anomalous events, we designed a novel observation scheduling system named Sky Survey Schedule (SSS). This framework facilitates coordinated operations across multi-site observational networks comprising dozens of instruments, while simultaneously supporting asteroid monitoring and time-domain astronomy studies. The system implements two principal observation modes: fixed sky regions and target-centered tracking. The former is used for sidereal or static observation, while the latter provides dedicated follow-up capabilities for transient targets. The sky regions are divided into latitude bands, each of which is subdivided into sectors to ensure minimal overlap and comprehensive coverage. These sectors are mapped to high-level HEALPix sky grids, enabling rapid cross-referencing and correlation between instruments. At the core of SSS lies an adaptive weighting architecture that integrates multiple parameters. Initial target priorities are determined from orbital catalogs containing both known and uncorrelated objects according to cataloging requirements. The system implements dynamic weight adjustments through feedback mechanisms: confirmed stable objects receive decaying weights, long-unobserved targets experience weight recovery, while anomalies (e.g., newly detected or lost objects) trigger priority escalation. These target-specific weights combine with observational factors - including phase angle constraints, lunar interference, Earth shadowing, and elevation limits - to generate space-time priority matrices. This quantitative framework systematically incorporates operator-defined priorities for specific regions/targets through configurable weight modifiers. Observation plans are dynamically optimized considering:....

 - **Abstract**
 Accurately distinguishing between quiescent and star-forming galaxies is essential for understanding galaxy evolution. Traditional methods, such as spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, can be computationally expensive and may struggle to capture complex galaxy properties. This study aims to develop a robust and efficient machine learning (ML) classification method to identify quiescent and star-forming galaxies within the Farmer COSMOS2020 catalog. We utilized JWST wide-field light cones from the Santa Cruz semi-analytical modeling framework to train a supervised ML model, the CatBoostClassifier, using 28 color features derived from 8 mutual photometric bands within the COSMOS catalog. The model was validated against a testing set and compared to the SED-fitting method in terms of precision, recall, F1-score, and execution time. Preprocessing steps included addressing missing data, injecting observational noise, and applying a magnitude cut (ch1 < 26 AB) along with a redshift range of 0.2 < z < 3.5 to align the simulated and observational datasets. The ML method achieved an F1-score of 89\% for quiescent galaxies, significantly outperforming the SED-fitting method, which achieved 54%. The ML model demonstrated superior recall (88% vs. 38%) while maintaining comparable precision. When applied to the COSMOS2020 catalog, the ML model predicted a systematically higher fraction of quiescent galaxies across all redshift bins within 0.2 < z < 3.5 compared to traditional methods like NUVrJ and SED-fitting. This study shows that ML, combined with multi-wavelength data, can effectively identify quiescent and star-forming galaxies, providing valuable insights into galaxy evolution. The trained classifier and full classification catalog are publicly available.

 - **Abstract**
 Thermal and magneto-thermal simulations are an important tool for advancing understanding of neutron stars, as they allow us to compare models of their internal structure and physical processes against observations constraining macroscopic properties such as the surface temperature. A major challenge in the simulations is in modelling of the outermost layers, known as the envelope, exhibiting a drop of many orders of magnitude in temperature and density in a geometrically thin shell. This is often addressed by constructing a separate envelope model in plane-parallel approximation that produces a relation between the temperature at the bottom of the envelope, $T_b$, and the surface temperature, $T_s$. Our aim is to construct a general framework for approximating the $T_b$-$T_s$ relation that is able to include the dependencies from the strength and orientation of the magnetic field. We used standard prescriptions to calculate a large number of magnetised envelope models to be used as a training sample and employed single-hidden-layer feedforward neural networks as approximators, providing the flexibility, high accuracy, and fast evaluation necessary in neutron star simulations. We explored the optimal network architecture and hyperparameter choices and used a special holdout set designed to avoid overfitting to the structure of the input data. We find that relatively simple neural networks are sufficient for the approximation of the $T_b$-$T_s$ relation with an accuracy $\sim 3\%$. The presented workflow can be used in a wide range of problems where simulations are used to construct approximating formulae.

 - **Abstract**
 Local distance indicators such as standard sirens, in combination with spectroscopic redshift measurements of their host galaxies, allow us to estimate the present-day expansion rate of the Universe parameterised by Hubble's constant, H_0. However, these observed redshifts are systematically modified by the effect of galaxy peculiar velocities. Although these velocities may be estimated from the local density field by the process of velocity-field reconstruction, the intrinsic errors and covariance in these estimates contribute to the error in the H_0 determination. In this paper we demonstrate how the impact of peculiar velocities can be propagated into H_0 measurements from local distance indicators with observed redshifts, incorporating the full covariance of the velocity field induced by bulk flows. We apply our methods to cosmological simulations, testing the importance of this effect in the context of future analyses of gravitational wave sources with electromagnetic counterparts used as bright sirens. We conclude that H_0 errors may be increased by up to a factor of 2 in comparison with neglecting peculiar velocity covariance, with the highest impacts expected for sources at nearby distances or with small distance errors. Our analytical methods may also be applied to other local distance indicators, such as Type Ia supernovae.

 We present a new catalogue of 578 OB cluster (OBC) candidates in the Andromeda galaxy (M31), identified using a MeanShift-based algorithm on HST's F275W-band imaging from the PHAT (Dalcanton et al. 2012) and PHAST (Chen et al. 2025) Hubble surveys. These clusters exhibit typical half-light radii of 1-2 pc and strong ultraviolet luminosities indicative of recent massive star formation. Spatial analysis reveals a pronounced north-south asymmetry: clusters in the northern disc show tight associations with giant molecular clouds (GMCs), while southern clusters appear more compact and luminous but less correlated with molecular gas. Two-point correlation functions demonstrate significant clustering of OBC candidates on scales 100 pc and a strong spatial association with GMCs, consistent with hierarchical star formation in dense gas-rich environments. These findings offer new constraints on the early evolution and feedback-driven dispersal of young stellar clusters across galactic discs.

 - **Abstract**
 Over the past decade, a significant amount of effort has been put into investigating the ultraviolet (UV) and optical variability of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Comprehensive studies of intensive multi-wavelength monitoring and surveys of local and high-redshift AGNs have shown that X-ray illumination of AGN accretion discs is a potential explanation for the observed variability. Our main objective is to study the UV/optical power spectra of AGNs under the assumption of X-ray reverberation and to test whether this model can explain the observed power spectra of distant quasars. To do this, we computed the disc transfer function in the case of X-ray reverberation using a recent physical model and studied its dependence on the parameters of the model. This model allows us to explore the variability of X-ray illuminated discs under the scenario in which the X-ray corona is powered by the accretion process or by an external source. We then calculated UV/optical power spectra using the disc transfer function and assuming a bending power law for the X-ray power spectrum. We fitted our models to the observed power spectra of quasars determined by a recent power spectrum analysis of the SDSS Stripe-82 light curves. We demonstrate that X-ray reverberation can fit the power spectra of quasars in our sample well at all wavelengths, from $\sim 1300$Å up to $4000$Å. Our best-fit models imply that the X-ray corona is powered by the accretion disc, and that the black hole spin is probably lower than 0.7, while the X-ray corona height is in the range of $20 - 60 R_{g}$. This is in agreement with previous findings from the application of the X-ray reverberation model to the quasar micro-lensing disc size problem, as well as recent time-lag measurements.

 - **Abstract**
 The MAG payload onboard India's first solar mission, Aditya-L1, is a dual-senssor fluxgate magnetometer designed to measure th interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) while operating in a halo orbit around the first Sun-Earth Lagrangian point (l1). Since becoming operational in January 2024, MAG has continuously recorded local magnetic field data and has captured several solar transient events over the past one year. During these events, the IMF, typically around 5 nT, exhibited significant enhancements in magnitude. This study focuses on three such solar events observed in March, May, and October 2024. Analysis of the magnetic field power spectra during these events reveals fluctuations consistent with Kolmogorov type turbulence, characterized by a spectral slope close to -5/3. To emphasize changes in spectral behavior, the event-day spectra are compared with those from a day when the quiet solar wind conditions prevail. A marked contrast is observed: while the quiet periods exhibit anisotropic turbulence, the extreme events display quasi-isotropic behavior, with spectral slopes closely following the Kolmogorov spectrum across all three IMF components. The results, including detailed variations in spectral slope and turbulence characteristics, are presented and discussed in this paper.

 - **Abstract**
 Double degenerate white dwarf (WD) mergers can exhibit extreme magnetic fields exceeding $10^{8}$ G and rapid rotation, but their spectral-energy distributions and high-energy emission mechanisms remain poorly characterised. ZTF J1901+1458 stands out as the most compact and strongly magnetised object discovered in this class to date. Recent Chandra observations have revealed that the white dwarf is also a source of soft X-ray emission, inconsistent with a photospheric origin. We analyse new phase resolved UV spectroscopy from the HST combined with optical and near-infrared photometry and spectroscopy, with newly developed magnetic atmosphere models to determine its effective temperature, radius, mass, average surface magnetic field strength, and cooling age. Our results demonstrate that the spectral break at $\approx$3000 Å, observed in several highly magnetised WDs, is well-reproduced by our new models, which take into account the effect of magnetic opacities on the structure of the atmosphere. Our best-fit parameters for the WD yield an effective temperature ($T_{\rm{eff}}=28,015\pm 20$ K) and larger radius ($2630\pm10$ km) than previously reported. Furthermore, the near-infrared data exclude the presence of a stellar or brown dwarf companion hotter than $\approx$700 K. We also jointly analyse the previously published Chandra data and new XMM-Newton X-ray spectra. The faint X-ray emission, $L_X =(1.3\pm0.2)\times10^{27}$ erg/s is very soft and highly pulsed on the rotation period of the WD. We suggest that the X-rays are powered by accretion or via the interaction of the WD magnetosphere with CSM. If the rapidly rotating magnetic field could power a weak wind along open field lines, material could be extracted directly from the surface of the WD. Alternatively, accretion of fallback material from the merger or the tidal disruption of a planetary body are possible sources of CSM.

 - **Abstract**
 A combined effect of the density-stratified turbulence and a large-scale shear for arbitrary Mach numbers causes the alpha effect and the effective pumping velocity of a large-scale magnetic field. This results in generation of the large-scale magnetic field in colliding protogalactic clouds, merging protostellar clouds and protoplanetary discs. Compressibility of the turbulent velocity field (i.e., finite Mach number effects) does not affect the contributions caused by the inhomogeneity of turbulence to the $\alpha$ tensor and effective pumping velocity. The isotropic part of the alpha tensor is independent of the exponent of the turbulent kinetic energy spectrum. There is also an additional contribution to the effective pumping velocity of the mean magnetic field caused by product of the fluid density stratification and the divergence of the mean fluid velocity due to collapsing (or expanding) astrophysical clouds. However, the alpha tensor is independent of the effects of collapsing or expanding of clouds.

 - **Abstract**
 (abridged) The acceleration of particles at the Sun and their propagation through interplanetary space are key topics in heliophysics. Specifically, solar energetic electrons (SEEs) measured in situ can be linked to solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which can be observed remotely in radio, optical, UV and X-rays. Solar Orbiter, equipped with a wide range of remote-sensing and in situ detectors, provides an excellent opportunity to investigate SEEs and their solar origin from the inner heliosphere. The Comprehensive Solar Energetic Electron event Catalogue (CoSEE-Cat) provides details for all SEE events measured in situ by Solar Orbiter, as well as associated flares, CMEs, and radio bursts. The catalogue contains key parameters of the SEEs, as derived from the Energetic Particle Detector (EPD), complemented with basic parameters of associated X-ray flares provided by STIX, information on eruptive phenomena seen by EUI, characteristics of type III radio bursts observed by RPW, and indications of CME observed by Metis and SoloHI. The conditions in interplanetary space were characterised using SWA and MAG measurements. Finally, data-driven modelling with the Magnetic Connectivity Tool provided an independent estimate of the solar source position of the SEEs. The first data release contains 303 SEE events observed from November 2020 until the end of 2022. In this paper, we describe the catalogue and provide a first statistical analysis. Preliminary results support the flare-related origin of events with an impulsive ion composition and the association of gradual events with extended structures such as CME-driven shocks or erupting flux ropes. We also show that the commonly observed delays of the solar release times of the SEEs relative to the associated X-ray flares and type III radio bursts are at least partially due to propagation effects.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a theoretical framework for seeding and growing supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in dark-matter halos along their assembly histories. Seeds are bred out of Pop-III stars formed during the first collapse of pristine gas in mini-halos that have reached the ${\rm H}_2$-cooling limit, modulated by UV radiation from star formation and dynamical heating from fast halo assembly. Such breeding persists until the enrichment of the intergalactic medium (IGM) enables Pop-II stars to form. Post-seeding growth of black holes (BHs) is driven by distinct channels, starting with episodic super-Eddington accretion associated with nuclear bursts induced by global disturbances of galaxies, followed by sustained sub-Eddington accretion via capturing sub-clouds formed in self-gravitating gas clouds (SGCs) in halos of fast assembly, and ending with merger-dominated, quiescent growth. We implement the model in subhalo merger trees to build a coherent framework to follow the SMBH-galaxy-halo co-evolution over their full lives in the full structure hierarchy. BH seeds are bred with a broad mass spectrum of $M_{\rm BH} = 10$--$10^5\,{\rm M}_\odot$ at $z \approx 20$--$30$ in mini-halos with masses of $10^5$--$10^8\,{\rm M}_\odot$. Nuclear bursts provide the key condition for seeds to grow into SMBHs. The $M_{\rm BH}$-$M_*$ relation is a multi-piece, redshift-dependent function shaped by the interplay among different growth channels. Our model predictions are broadly consistent with existing observations; especially, a population of BHs reminiscent of `little red dots' (LRDs) discovered by JWST naturally results from the seeding and growing processes. Potential future tests of the model are discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 The real nature of little red dots (LRDs), a class of very compact galaxies in the early Universe recently discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope, is still poorly understood. The most popular theories competing to interpret the phenomena include active galactic nuclei and enhanced star formation in dusty galaxies. To date, however, neither model gives a completely satisfactory explanation to the population as a whole; thus, alternative theories have arisen, including tidal disruption events (TDEs). By considering observational constraints on the radio emission of LRDs, we discuss whether TDEs are adequate alternatives solving these high-redshift enigmas. We utilise radio flux density upper limits from LRD stacking analyses, TDE peak radio luminosities, and volumetric density estimates. We find that the characteristic values of flux densities and luminosities allow radio-quiet TDEs as the underlying process of LRDs in any case, while the less common radio-loud TDEs are compatible with the model under special constraints only. Considering other factors, such as volumetric density estimates, delayed and long-term radio flares of TDEs, and cosmological time dilation, TDEs appear to be a plausible explanation for LRDs from the radio point of view.

 - **Abstract**
 Numerical modeling of galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) penetration through the heliosphere to the vicinity of the Sun is considered. Galactic cosmic rays are charged particles with energies exceeding 10 MeV/nucl., originating from far beyond the boundaries of our Solar System. As they penetrate through the heliosphere - the region of space filled by the solar wind - they interact strongly with the interplanetary magnetic field. In this paper, we present numerical approaches to solving the so-called Parker transport equation for the isotropic velocity distribution function of GCRs. This equation includes a convective term, anisotropic diffusion, adiabatic cooling, and drifts. Additionally, the diffusion coefficient is spatially and energy-dependent, varying by several orders of magnitude. Our numerical approaches are based on the finite-difference method (Crank-Nicolson scheme) and the stochastic differential equations (SDE) method. The numerical methods were validated against a known analytical solution under simplified conditions. For the general problem formulation, which involves anisotropic diffusion and the Parker spiral interplanetary magnetic field configuration, we used the most efficient and flexible SDE method and compared the numerical results with the data from the works of Kota & Jokipii (1983) and Burger (2012). Special attention was devoted to incorporating drift along the heliospheric current sheet in the model.

 - **Abstract**
 Nanohertz gravitational waves (GWs) from supermassive binary black holes (SMBBHs), detectable via pulsar timing arrays (PTAs), offer a novel avenue to constrain dark energy. Based on cosmological simulations and semi-analytic galaxy formation models, this study explores the detectability of individual nanohertz SMBBH sources using next-generation PTAs and their potential for constraining dark energy under an optimistic scenario considering only the presence of white noise. By constructing light-cone SMBBH populations across hardening timescales ($\tau_H = 0.1/5/10$Gyr) and computing signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), we find advanced PTAs can resolve $10^2$--$10^3$ sources with SNR $> 8$ (primarily at $z < 1$ with chirp masses of $10^8$--$10^{10}M_{\odot}$). If electromagnetic counterparts can be identified, optimal configurations ($\sigma_t = 50$ns, $N_p = 1000$, $T_{\text{obs}} = 30$yr with$ \tau_H \leq 5$Gyr) could constrain the dark energy equation-of-state (EoS) parameter $w$ to $\Delta w \sim 0.023$--$0.048$, where the constraints only exhibit weak dependence on $\tau_H$ within $0.1$--$5$Gyr. If only $10\%$ of GW sources have detectable electromagnetic counterparts, constraints weaken to $\Delta w = 0.075$ ($\tau_H = 0.1$Gyr) and $\Delta w = 0.162$ ($\tau_H = 5$Gyr) under the most optimal parameter configuration. What's more, conservative PTAs ($N_p = 500$, $\sigma_t = 100$--$200$ns) with additional $30$-year data accumulation could double resolvable source counts and improve $\Delta w$ precision by $\sim 40\%$.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we characterize the environments of massive ($\log(M_\odot/M_\star)\sim11.2$) $z\sim0.7$ post-starburst galaxies (PSBs) by studying serendipitously-detected CO(2-1) emitters found in targeted observations of the SQuIGG$\vec{L}$E sample. We report $31\pm6\%$ of the galaxies from this survey host nearby gas-rich ``buddies'' with stellar masses $\geq 10^{10},M_\odot$ and molecular gas comparable to their central PSBs ($M_{H_{2}} \sim 10^{10} M_\odot$), but $\sim0.8$ dex lower stellar mass ($\sim 10^{10.4} M_\odot$). Based on their location in position-velocity space, each buddy is consistent with being bound to the haloes of their SQuIGG$\vec{L}$E host galaxies. We compare to the UniverseMachine model and find that SQuIGG$\vec{L}$E galaxies host a typical number of neighbors for their stellar mass, suggesting that PSBs live in environments typical of co-eval similarly-massive galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 T Coronae Borealis (T CrB) is a symbiotic recurrent nova system expected to undergo its next outburst within the next two years. Recent hydrodynamic simulations have predicted the nucleosynthetic yields for both carbon-oxygen (CO) and oxygen-neon (ONe) white-dwarf models, but without accounting for thermonuclear reaction-rate uncertainties. We perform detailed Monte Carlo post-processing nucleosynthesis calculations based on updated thermonuclear reaction rates and uncertainties from the 2025 evaluation. We quantify the resulting abundance uncertainties and identify the key nuclear reactions that dominate them. Our results show that both the CO and ONe nova models robustly produce characteristic CNO isotopes. More pronounced abundance differences emerge for elements with A $\ge$ 20. Sulfur is the most robust observational discriminator between the CO and ONe nova models, with a model-to-model difference of a factor of $\approx$30 and minimal sensitivity to reaction rate uncertainties. Neon, silicon, and phosphorus exhibit even larger abundance differences (factors of $\approx$150-250), providing strong diagnostic potential. While their predicted yields are subject to larger uncertainties, these remain smaller than the model-to-model differences, allowing these elements to serve as useful, though less precise, tracers of white-dwarf composition. Chlorine, argon, and potassium also differ between models, but the 1$\sigma$-abundance ranges for the CO and ONe models overlap, reducing their present usefulness as composition tracers. We find that only nine nuclear reactions dominate the abundance uncertainties of the most diagnostically important isotopes, and their influence is largely independent of the underlying white-dwarf composition. These results provide guidance for future experimental efforts and for interpreting ejecta compositions in the next eruption of T CrB.
#### Hydrogen-deficient binary stars with magnetic braking

 - **Abstract**
 Hydrogen-deficient binary stars comprise one star which has been stripped of its hydrogen through mass transfer to a binary companion. Observations show that the companion is able to accrete several solar masses without spinning up to critical rotation, and so there must be a mechanism to drain spin angular momentum from the accretor. We test magnetically coupled winds and magnetic star-disc coupling as possible mechanisms and find that, while the disc coupling is negligible, the winds are sufficient to allow the accretor to gain mass without spinning up to critical rotation. However, in order to fully replicate observations, time-dependent scalings of the dynamo-generated magnetic field are needed.
#### Comparison of Halo Model and Simulation Predictions for Projected-Field Kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Cross-Correlations

 - **Abstract**
 The kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) is a powerful probe of gas physics and large-scale structure (LSS) in our universe. We consider the "projected-field" kSZ estimator, which involves cross-correlating a foreground-cleaned, filtered, squared CMB temperature map with an LSS tracer, and requires no individual tracer redshifts. We compare $\verb|class_sz|$ halo model calculations of projected-field kSZ cross-correlations with measurements of these signals from the Websky numerical simulations. We cross-correlate halo density maps from Websky with various CMB secondary signals. We first validate our halo model by comparing its predictions for thermal SZ (tSZ) and patchy screening ($\tau$) cross-correlations to measurements of these signals from Websky. We consider three different halo redshift ranges in our comparisons. We also construct our own kSZ, tSZ, and $\tau$ maps to validate the form of the relevant profiles. Following the tSZ and $\tau$ validation, we compare projected-field kSZ calculations between the halo model and the simulations. We use filters constructed for $\textit{Planck}$ and the Simons Observatory (SO) to assess the accuracy of the halo-model kSZ predictions for experiments of differing sensitivity. Overall, we find good agreement, particularly at $\textit{Planck}$ sensitivity. However, we find an $\approx$ 20$\%$ difference between our halo model and the simulations for SO, which significantly exceeds the predicted error bars. We note that our halo model includes only the dominant expected term in the projected-field kSZ signal; the magnitude of the difference between our model and the simulations is consistent with previous predictions for terms arising from other contractions in the theory calculation. These terms will need to be included to obtain unbiased inference from upcoming projected-field kSZ measurements.

 - **Abstract**
 Despite being only 85 pc away, the open cluster Coma Berenices (Coma Ber) has not been extensively studied. This is due in part to its sparseness and low proper motion, which together made Coma Ber's membership challenging to establish. Gaia data for $\approx$400 previously cataloged candidate cluster stars allowed us to identify $\approx$300 as members. With [Fe/H] measurements for nine members, we found that Coma Ber has a solar metallicity, and then fit isochrones to its color--magnitude diagram to determine that it is 675$\pm$100 Myr old. With photometry obtained by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), we measured rotation periods for 137 of Coma Ber's low-mass stars, increasing the sample of members with measured periods by a factor of six, and extending the rotational census for the cluster from its late F stars through to its fully convective M dwarfs. By measuring the equivalent width of the H$\alpha$ line for $\approx$250 stars and collecting X-ray detections for $\approx$100 ($\approx$85% and $\approx$33% of the cluster's members, respectively), we characterized magnetic activity in Coma Ber and examined the dependence of chromospheric and of coronal activity on rotation in these stars. Despite having a metallicity that is 0.2 dex below that of their coeval cousins in Praesepe and the Hyades, low-mass stars in Coma Ber seem to follow a similar rotation--activity relation. In detail, however, there are differences that may provide further insight into the impact of metallicity on this still poorly understood relation.

 - **Abstract**
 We present Stokes I continuum analysis for a volume-limited sample ($<40~\rm{Mpc}$) of hard X-ray selected active galactic nuclei (AGNs) using $4-12$ GHz observations with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA). All of the 25 sources analyzed here have previously been observed with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) to probe their subparsec projected physical scales, but detected emission has only been measured for 12 of the sources at $C$ band (4.4 GHz), despite expectations. We determined that coronal emission is unlikely to be a dominant emission mechanism for the sources not detected by the VLBA, and the emission measured with the VLA is likely produced beyond parsec spatial scales. We also explore potential radiation mechanisms for the circumnuclear radio emission that is produced beyond the observable ~parsec physical scales probed with the VLBA but within the $\leq30-110$ parsec spatial scales observed with the VLA. From an energetics perspective, we find that all targets have extranuclear radio emission that is compatible with AGN winds, assuming a maximum of 10% of the bolometric output can supply the mechanical energy observed. We also find that the excess emission is likely too strong for star formation alone when compared to results from optical spectroscopy, but may contribute in smaller capacities.

 - **Abstract**
 We study transport of GeV cosmic rays (CRs) in a set of high-resolution TIGRESS magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the star-forming interstellar medium (ISM). Our local disk patch models sample a wide range of gas surface densities, gravitational potentials, and star formation rates (SFRs), and include a spiral arm simulation. Our approach incorporates CR advection by the background gas, streaming along the magnetic field limited by the local ion Alfvén speed, and diffusion relative to the Alfvén wave frame, with the diffusion coefficient set by the balance between streaming-driven Alfvén wave excitation and damping mediated by local gas properties. We find that dynamical transport mechanisms (streaming and advection) are almost solely responsible for GeV CR transport in the extra-planar regions of galaxies, while diffusion along the magnetic field dominates within the primarily-neutral ISM of galactic disks. We develop a simple 1D predictive model for the CR pressure $P_\mathrm{c}$, dependent only on injected CR flux and gas parameters. We demonstrate that the CR transport efficiency increases with increasing SFR, and provide a fit for the CR feedback yield $\Upsilon_\mathrm{c}~\equiv~P_\mathrm{c}/\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR}$ as a function of $\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR}$, the SFR surface density. We analyze lateral CR transport within the galactic disk, showing that CRs propagate away from feedback regions in spiral arms into interarm regions by a combination of gas advection and field-aligned transport. Lastly, we develop an empirical subgrid model for the CR scattering rate that captures the impacts of the multiphase ISM on CR transport without the numerical burden of full simulations.
