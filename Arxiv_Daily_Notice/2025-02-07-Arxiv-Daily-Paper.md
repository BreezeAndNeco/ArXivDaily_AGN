 - **Abstract**
 The field of the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) searches for ``technosignatures'' that could provide the first detection of life beyond Earth through the technology that an extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI) may have created. Any given SETI survey, if no technosignatures are detected, should set upper limits based on the kinds of technosignatures it should have been able to detect; the sensitivity of many SETI searches requires that their target sources (e.g., Dyson spheres or Kardashev II/III level radio transmitters) emit with power far exceeding the kinds of technology humans have developed. In this paper, we instead turn our gaze Earthward, minimizing the axis of extrapolation by only considering transmission and detection methods commensurate with an Earth-2024 level. We evaluate the maximum distance of detectability for various present-day Earth technosignatures -- radio transmissions, atmospheric technosignatures, optical and infrared signatures, and objects in space or on planetary surfaces -- using only present-day Earth instruments, providing one of the first fully cross-wavelength comparisons of the growing toolbox of SETI techniques. In this framework, we find that Earth's space-detectable signatures span 13 orders of magnitude in detectability, with intermittent, celestially-targeted radio transmission (i.e., planetary radar) beating out its nearest non-radio competitor by a factor of $10^3$ in detection distance. This work highlights the growing range of ways that exoplanet technosignatures may be expressed, the growing complexity and visibility of the human impact upon our planet, and the continued importance of the radio frequencies in SETI.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmological simulations provide much of the theoretical framework within which we interpret extragalactic observations. However, even if a given simulation reproduces the integrated properties of galaxies well, it may not reproduce the detailed structures of individual galaxies. Comparisons between the 2D light distributions of simulated and observed galaxies -- particularly in the dwarf regime, where key processes like tidal perturbations and baryonic feedback most strongly influence galaxy structure -- thus provide an additional valuable test of the simulation's efficacy. We compare scaling relations derived from mock observations of simulated galaxies, drawn from the two largest halos in the high-resolution NewHorizon cosmological simulation, with galaxies in the Fornax cluster. While Fornax is significantly more massive than either group, it is the lowest-mass cluster in the local Universe, and contains a well-studied population of spatially resolved dwarfs, hence serves as a useful benchmark. Per unit stellar mass, NewHorizon dwarfs are systematically larger in half-light radius, much fainter in surface brightness, and bluer in colour than their Fornax counterparts, albeit with similar light profile shapes. We discuss potential reasons for these discrepancies, including environmental effects, baryonic feedback, resolution, or couplings of these factors. As observations of dwarfs outside of the local Universe become more plentiful through on-going or up-coming surveys such as Euclid and LSST, 2D comparisons such as these, where properties are measured in the same way across both simulations and observations, can place strong constraints on processes that alter the spatial distribution of baryons in galaxies.
#### The dynamical impact of cosmic rays in the Rhea magnetohydrodynamics simulations

 - **Abstract**
 This study explores the dynamical impact of cosmic rays (CRs) in Milky Way-like galaxies using the Rhea simulation suite. Cosmic rays, with their substantial energy density, influence the interstellar medium (ISM) by supporting galactic winds, modulating star formation, and shaping ISM energetics. The simulations incorporate a multi-phase ISM, self-consistent CR transport in the advection-diffusion approximation, and interactions with magnetic fields to study their effect on galaxy evolution. Key findings reveal that CRs reduce star formation rates, and drive weak but sustained outflows with mass loading factors of $\sim0.2$, transporting a substantial fraction (20%-60%) of the injected CR energy. These CR-driven outflows are launched not just from the galactic center but across the entire disk, illustrating their pervasive dynamical influence. Galactic disks supported by CRs exhibit broader vertical structures compared to magnetic-field-dominated setups, though the scale heights are similar. CR feedback enhances magnetic flux transport to the circumgalactic medium (CGM), leading to a magnetically enriched CGM with field strengths of $\sim0.5\mu\mathrm{G}$ while reducing gas temperatures to $\lesssim10^5\,\mathrm{K}$. The CR energy is relatively smoothly distributed in the disk, with gradient lengths exceeding the typical size of molecular clouds, indicating that the CR behavior is not adiabatic.
#### Introducing the Rhea simulations of Milky-Way-like galaxies I: Effect of gravitational potential on morphology and star formation

 - **Abstract**
 The Milky Way is a complex ecosystem, for which we can obtain detailed observations probing the physical mechanisms determining the interstellar medium. For a detailed comparison with observations, and to provide theories for missing observables, we need to model the Milky Way as closely as possible. However, details of the Galactic structure are not fully defined by observations, raising the need for more generalized models. With the Rhea simulations we present a set of Milky Way like simulations, containing detailed physics of the interstellar medium, as well as star formation and stellar feedback. We conduct two simulations that differ in the gravitational potential: one fitted to several structural details derived from observations, the other just reproducing the most basic quantities. We find little difference in the overall morphology except for the bar region, which funnels gas towards the Galactic inner region and therefore prevents quenching in the center. Despite differences with galacto-centric radius, the global star formation rate is almost identical in both setups. A spiral arm potential does not influence properties of groups of formed stars. A bar potential, however, lowers size and formation time of those groups. We therefore conclude for a spiral arm potential to have little influence on star formation in the Galaxy, except for producing long-lived spiral structures instead of transient ones. A Galactic bar potential has noticeable influence on star formation mainly within the innermost 2.5kpc.

 - **Abstract**
 Dwarf galaxies dominate the galaxy number density, making them critical to our understanding of galaxy evolution. However, typical dwarfs are too faint to be visible outside the very local Universe in past surveys like the SDSS, which offer large footprints but are shallow. Dwarfs in such surveys have relatively high star formation rates, which boost their luminosity, making them detectable in shallow surveys, but also biased and potentially unrepresentative of dwarfs as a whole. Here, we use deep data to perform an unbiased statistical study of ~7,000 nearby (z<0.25) dwarfs (10^8 MSun < M < 10^9.5 MSun) in the COSMOS field which, at these redshifts, is a relatively low-density field. At z~0.05, ~40 per cent of dwarfs in low-density environments are red/quenched, falling to ~30 per cent by z~0.25. Red dwarfs reside closer to nodes, filaments and massive galaxies. Proximity to a massive galaxy appears to be more important in determining whether a dwarf is red, rather than simply its distance from nodes and filaments or the mean density of its local environment. Interestingly, around half of the red dwarfs reside outside the virial radii of massive galaxies and around a third of those also inhabit regions in the lower 50 per cent in density percentile (i.e. regions of very low ambient density). Around half of the red dwarf population is, therefore, quenched by mechanisms unrelated to environment, which are likely to be internal processes such as stellar and AGN feedback.

 - **Abstract**
 Three uniquely powerful solar and heliospheric facilities are now operational at the same time. The US National Science Foundation's Daniel K Inouye Solar Telescope, NASA's Parker Solar Probe, and ESA's Solar Orbiter each represent frontiers in space science, and each pursue richly tailored science missions. At the intersection of these missions, though, lie unparalleled opportunities for multi-vantage point science. This symbiotic relationship is especially pronounced during PSP's perihelia and Solar Orbiter remote science windows. As the most advanced solar polarimeter ever built, DKIST strengthens many of the multi-facility use cases by opening new diagnostic windows into solar magnetism -- spanning the photosphere, chromosphere, and corona -- at unprecedented spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution. In this article, we report recent efforts to maximize the scientific potential of coordinated DKIST, PSP, and Solar Orbiter observations. Existing DKIST data from coordinated observations with Solar Orbiter and PSP are highlighted alongside some first investigations of these data.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze Hubble Space Telescope (HST) optical imaging of eight low-mass galaxies hosting active galactic nuclei (AGN) identified via their photometric variability in \cite{baldassare_search_2020}. We use GALFIT to model the 2D galaxy light profiles, and find a diversity of morphologies. The galaxies with regular morphologies are best fit with pseudo-bulges and disks, rather than classical bulges. We estimate black hole masses using scaling relations and find black hole masses of 10$^{3.7-6.6}$ M$_\odot$. We compare this sample to dwarf galaxies with AGN selected via optical spectroscopy. On average, the variable host galaxies have lower mass black holes. We analyze the brightest point source in each galaxy and find their properties are not entirely consistent with star clusters, indicating that they are likely AGN. These point sources are found to have lower luminosities than spectroscopically selected dwarf AGN, but brighter than the point sources in dwarf galaxies not identified as AGN. Our detailed imaging analysis shows that variability selection has the potential to find lower mass black holes and lower luminosity AGN than optical spectroscopy. These active dwarfs may have been missed by spectroscopic searches due to star formation dilution or low gas content.

 - **Abstract**
 Coherent radio emission mechanism of solar radio bursts is one of the most complicated and controversial topics in solar physics. To clarify the mechanism(s) of different types of solar radio bursts, (radio) wave excitation by energetic electrons in homogeneous plasmas has been widely studied via particle-in-cell (PIC) code numerical simulations. The solar corona is, however, inhomogeneous over almost all spatial scales. Inhomogeneities of the plasma could influence the emission properties of solar radio bursts. In this paper, we, hence, investigate effects of inhomogeneity (in the magnetic field, plasma density and temperature) of plasmas in the solar corona on radio wave emission by ring-beam distributed energetic electrons utilizing 2.5-dimensional PIC simulations. Both the beam and electron cyclotron maser (ECM) instabilities could be triggered with the presence of the energetic ring-beam electrons. The resultant spectrum of the excited electromagnetic waves presents a zebra-stripe pattern in the frequency space. The inhomogeneous density or temperature in plasmas influences the frequency bandwidth and location of these excited waves. Our results can, hence, help to diagnose the plasma properties at the emission sites of solar radio bursts. Applications of our results to the solar radio bursts with zebra-stripe pattern are discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will soon detect gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by massive black hole (MBH) mergers. Some theoretical models have predicted transient electromagnetic (EM) emission from these mergers, enabling the association of LISA GW sources with their EM counterparts via telescope follow-up. However, the number of unrelated EM transients that might contaminate telescope searches for the true transient counterparts of LISA MBH mergers is unknown. We investigate the expected numbers of unrelated EM transients that will coincide with simulated LISA localization volumes of MBH mergers, as a function of the merger total mass and redshift. We find that the number of potential contaminants in LISA localization volumes drops to unity for mergers at $z \lesssim 0.8$ and at 1 hour before coalescence. After coalescence, the parameter space corresponding to a maximum of one potential contaminant expands to $z \lesssim 1.5$. In contrast, if the redshifts for all transients detected in LISA sky localization regions are not available, the number of potential contaminants increases by an average factor of $\sim100$, and never drops below unity. Overall, we expect the average number of contaminating transients in telescope follow-up of LISA MBH mergers to be non-negligible, especially without redshift information for the detected transients. We recommend that endeavors designing follow-up strategies of LISA events should focus on: (1) building large redshift catalogs for host galaxies, (2) developing robust real-time transient classification algorithms, (3) and coordinating telescope resources to obtain redshifts for candidate transient EM counterparts in a timely manner.

 - **Abstract**
 Frequency-dependent polarization properties provide crucial insights into the radiation mechanisms and magnetic environments of fast radio bursts (FRBs). We explore an analytical solution of radiative transfer of the polarization properties of FRBs as a strong incoming wave propagates in a homogeneous magnetized plasma. The case of a thermal plasma is studied in more detail. The rotational axis of the polarization spectrum undergoes precession with frequency on the Poincaré sphere when the medium has both strong Faraday rotation and conversion. Such precession on the Poincaré sphere could occur in hot or cold plasma with a strong magnetic field component perpendicular to the line of sight. The analytical solution with the mixing Faraday case offers a more physical description of the physical properties of the magnetic environment of FRBs than the empirical ``generalized Faraday rotation'' method commonly adopted in the literature. Significant absorption can exist in a dense plasma medium, which may give rise to a highly circularly polarized outgoing wave. The frequency-dependent Stokes parameters may be associated with reversing rotation measures or the presence of a persistent radio source around an FRB.

 - **Abstract**
 Before a binary system enters into a common envelope (CE) phase, accretion from the primary star onto the companion star through Roche Lobe overflow (RLOF) will lead to the formation of an accretion disk, which may generate jets. Accretion before and during the CE may alter the outcome of the interaction. Previous studies have considered different aspects of this physical mechanism. Here we study the properties of an accretion disk formed via 3D hydrodynamic simulations of the RLOF mass transfer between a 7 M$_\odot$, red supergiant star and a 1.4 M$_\odot$, neutron star companion. We simulate only the volume around the companion for improved resolution. We use a 1D implicit MESA simulation of the evolution of the system during 30,000 years between the on-set of the RLOF and the CE to guide the binary parameters and the mass-transfer rate, while we simulate only 21 years of the last part of the RLOF in 3D using an ideal gas isothermal equation of state. We expect that a pre-CE disk under these parameters will have a mass of $\sim 5\times 10^{-3}$ M$_\odot$ and a radius of $\sim$40 R$_\odot$ with a scale height of $\sim$5 R$_\odot$. The temperature profile of the disk is shallower than that predicted by the formalism of Shakura and Sunyaev, but more reasonable cooling physics would need to be included. We stress test these results with respect to a number of physical and numerical parameters, as well as simulation choices, and we expect them to be reasonable within a factor of a few for the mass and 15% for the radius. We also contextualize our results within those presented in the literature, in particular with respect to the dimensionality of simulations and the adiabatic index. We consider what properties of magnetic fields and jets may be supported by our disk and discuss prospects for future work.

 - **Abstract**
 The flare ribbon and an associated filament eruption are diagnosed using O iv 1401.16 A, Si iv 1402.77 A, and Mg ii k 2796.35 A spectral lines provided by IRIS. The flare ribbons have downflow (redshifts) in all these lines, and this redshift decreases from the transition region to the chromosphere. While the overlapping region (flare-ribbon+filament rise/eruption is dominated by upflows(blueshifts) in all three spectral lines. We found an extremely blueshifted Si iv profile (i.e., blueshift around -180 km/s) in the overlapping region. The mean non-thermal velocity (v_nt) in the flare ribbons is higher in O iv than Si iv. While, in the overlapping region, O iv have lower v_nt than Si iv. Note that very high v_nt around 80 km/s (in Si iv) exists in this weak B-class flare. The Mg ii k line widths are almost the same in the flare ribbon and overlapping region but, they are extremely broad than previously reported. We found double peak profiles of Si iv and O iv in the overlapping region. Most probably, one peak is due to downflow (flare ribbon) and another due to upflow (filament rise/eruption). We report a high redshift of more than 150 km/s in the weak B-class flare. In some cases, both peaks show upflows which might be the result of the superposition of two different sources, i.e., overlapping of two different velocity distributions in the line of sight.

 - **Abstract**
 Turbulent, relativistic nonthermal plasmas are ubiquitous in high-energy astrophysical systems, as inferred from broadband nonthermal emission spectra. The underlying turbulent nonthermal particle acceleration (NTPA) processes have traditionally been modelled with a Fokker-Planck (FP) diffusion-advection equation for the particle energy distribution. We test FP-type NTPA theories by performing and analysing particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of turbulence in collisionless relativistic pair plasma. By tracking large numbers of particles in simulations with different initial magnetisation and system size, we first test and confirm the applicability of the FP framework. We then measure the FP energy diffusion ($D$) and advection ($A$) coefficients as functions of particle energy $\gamma m c^2$, and compare their dependence to theoretical predictions. At high energies, we robustly find $D \sim \gamma^2$ for all cases. Hence, we fit $D = D_0 \gamma^2$ and find a scaling consistent with $D_0 \sim \sigma^{3/2}$ at low instantaneous magnetisation $\sigma(t)$, flattening to $D_0 \sim \sigma$ at higher $\sigma \sim 1$. We also find that the power-law index $\alpha(t)$ of the particle energy distribution converges exponentially in time. We build and test an analytic model connecting the FP coefficients and $\alpha(t)$, predicting $A(\gamma) \sim \gamma \log \gamma$. We confirm this functional form in our measurements of $A(\gamma,t)$, which allows us to predict $\alpha(t)$ through the model relations. Our results suggest that the basic second-order Fermi acceleration model, which predicts $D_0 \sim \sigma$, may not be a complete description of NTPA in turbulent plasmas. These findings encourage further application of tracked particles and FP coefficients as a diagnostic in kinetic simulations of various astrophysically relevant plasma processes like collisionless shocks and magnetic reconnection.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently Usov's mechanism of pair creation on the surface of compact astrophysical objects has been revisited [1] with a conclusion that the pair creation rate was previously underestimated in the literature by nearly two orders of magnitude. Here we consider an alternative hypothesis of pair creation due to a perturbation of the surface of a compact object. Radial perturbation is induced in hydrodynamic velocity resulting in a microscopic displacement of the negatively charged component with respect to the positively charged one. The result depends on the ratio between the spatial scale of the perturbation $\lambda$ and the mean free path $l$. When $\lambda\sim l$ the perturbation energy is converted into a burst of electron-positron pairs which are created in collisionless plasma oscillations at the surface; after energy excess is dissipated electrosphere returns to its electrostatic configuration. When instead $\lambda\gg l$, the perturbation is thermalized, its energy is transformed into heat, and pairs are created continuously by the heated electrosphere. We discuss the relevant astrophysical scenarios.

 - **Abstract**
 Radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN) with their jets pointed close to our line of sight constitute the majority of extragalactic $\gamma$-ray sources and significantly contribute to the radiation observed in the even higher energy regime. The upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) is expected to detect fainter TeV objects, leading to an anticipated increase in the proportion of non-blazar extragalactic high-energy sources. Here we present the results of our dual-frequency (1.7 and 5~GHz) European VLBI Network (EVN) and enhanced Multi Element Remotely Linked Interferometer Network (e-MERLIN) observations of two faint radio sources from the list of TeV candidate sources. They do not show signs of nuclear activity in their optical spectra, but they were hypothesized to contain faint AGN that is outshone by the host galaxy. We used the mas-scale resolution radio data to try to pinpoint the location of the compact radio emitting feature, determine its spectral index, radio power, brightness temperature and radio-X-ray luminosity ratio and thus identify the origin of the radio emission. Our results suggest that both optically passive-looking galaxies host faint compact radio-emitting AGN with steep spectra.

 - **Abstract**
 Knowledge of the primordial matter density field from which the large-scale structure of the Universe emerged over cosmic time is of fundamental importance for cosmology. However, reconstructing these cosmological initial conditions from late-time observations is a notoriously difficult task, which requires advanced cosmological simulators and sophisticated statistical methods to explore a multi-million-dimensional parameter space. We show how simulation-based inference (SBI) can be used to tackle this problem and to obtain data-constrained realisations of the primordial dark matter density field in a simulation-efficient way with general non-differentiable simulators. Our method is applicable to full high-resolution dark matter $N$-body simulations and is based on modelling the posterior distribution of the constrained initial conditions to be Gaussian with a diagonal covariance matrix in Fourier space. As a result, we can generate thousands of posterior samples within seconds on a single GPU, orders of magnitude faster than existing methods, paving the way for sequential SBI for cosmological fields. Furthermore, we perform an analytical fit of the estimated dependence of the covariance on the wavenumber, effectively transforming any point-estimator of initial conditions into a fast sampler. We test the validity of our obtained samples by comparing them to the true values with summary statistics and performing a Bayesian consistency test.

 - **Abstract**
 Low surface brightness galaxies (LSBGs) are important for understanding galaxy evolution and cosmological models. The upcoming large-scale surveys are expected to uncover a large number of LSBGs, requiring accurate automated or machine learning-based methods for their detection. We study the scope of transfer learning for the identification of LSBGs. We use transformer models divided into two categories: LSBG Detection Transformer (LSBG DETR) and LSBG Vision Transformer (LSBG ViT), trained on Dark Energy Survey (DES) data, to identify LSBGs from dedicated Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) observations of the Abell 194 cluster, which are two magnitudes deeper than DES. The data from DES and HSC were standardized based on pixel-level surface brightness. We used two transformer ensembles to detect LSBGs. This was followed by a single-component Sérsic model fit and a final visual inspection to filter out potential false positives and improve sample purity. We present a sample of 171 low surface brightness galaxies (LSBGs) in the Abell 194 cluster using HSC data, including 87 new discoveries. Of these, 159 were identified using transformer models, and 12 additional LSBGs were found through visual inspection. The transformer model achieved a true positive rate (TPR) of 93% in HSC data without any fine-tuning. Among the LSBGs, 28 were classified as ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs). The number of UDGs and the radial UDG number density suggest a linear relationship between UDG numbers and cluster mass on a log scale. UDGs share similar Sérsic parameters with dwarf galaxies and occupy the extended end of the $R_{\mathrm{eff}}-M_g$ plane, suggesting they might be an extended subpopulation of dwarf galaxies. We have demonstrated that transformer models trained on shallower surveys can be successfully applied to deeper surveys with appropriate data normalization.

 As demonstrated with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), Pan-STARRS, and most recently with Gaia data, broadband near-UV to near-IR stellar photometry can be used to estimate distance, metallicity, and interstellar dust extinction along the line of sight for stars in the Galaxy. Anticipating photometric catalogs with tens of billions of stars from Rubin's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), we present a Bayesian model and pipeline that build on previous work and can handle LSST-sized datasets. Likelihood computations utilize MIST/Dartmouth isochrones and priors are derived from TRILEGAL-based simulated LSST catalogs from P. Dal Tio et al. The computation speed is about 10 ms per star on a single core for both optimized grid search and Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods; we show in a companion paper by K. Mrakovčić et al. how to utilize neural networks to accelerate this performance by up to an order of magnitude. We validate our pipeline, named PhotoD (in analogy with photo-z, photometric redshifts of galaxies) using both simulated catalogs and SDSS, DECam, and Gaia photometry. We intend to make LSST-based value-added PhotoD catalogs publicly available via the Rubin Science Platform with every LSST data release.

 - **Abstract**
 Interstellar material has been discovered in our Solar System, yet its origins and details of its transport are unknown. Here we present $\alpha$ Centauri as a case study of the delivery of interstellar material to our Solar System. $\alpha$ Centauri is a mature triple star system that likely harbours planets and is moving towards us with the point of closest approach approximately 28,000 years in the future. Assuming a current ejection model for the system, we find that such material can reach our Solar System and may currently be present here. The material that does reach us is mostly a product of low ($<2$ km/s) ejection velocities, and the rate at which it enters our Solar System is expected to peak around the time of $\alpha$ Centauri 's closest approach. If $\alpha$ Centauri ejects material at a rate comparable to our own Solar System, we estimate the current number of $\alpha$ Centauri particles larger than 100 m in diameter within our Oort Cloud to be $10^{6}$, and during $\alpha$ Centauri 's closest approach, this will increase by an order of magnitude. However, the observable fraction of such objects remains low as there is only a probability of $10^{-6}$ that one of them is within 10 au of the Sun. A small number ($\sim 10$) meteors greater than 100 micrometers from $\alpha$ Centauri may currently be entering Earth's atmosphere every year: this number is very sensitive to the assumed ejected mass distribution, but the flux is expected to increase as $\alpha$ Centauri approaches.

 - **Abstract**
 NASA's New Horizon observations yielded the most accurate measurement of the cosmic optical background (COB) intensity. The reported COB flux is $16.37\pm 1.47$ $\mathrm{nW/m^2/sr}$ at a pivot wavelength $ \lambda_{piv} = 0.608~ \mu\mathrm{m}$ observed in the range $( 0.4 ~ \mu\mathrm{m} \lesssim \lambda \lesssim 0.9 \, \mu\mathrm{m})$. After subtracting the measured intensity from the deep Hubble space telescope count, an anomalous excess flux $8.06 \pm 1.92~\mathrm{nW/m^2/sr}$ has been found. This observation could hint toward decaying dark matter producing photons. In this work, we have considered sterile neutrinos of the keV scale as well as the eV scale decaying via sterile-to-sterile transition magnetic dipole moment and active-to-sterile transition magnetic dipole moment, respectively, to explain anomalous flux. The sterile neutrinos with a mass of $\mathcal{O}(\rm keV)$ with transition magnetic moment in the range $3\times 10^{-14}\,\mu_{B} - 10^{-13}\,\mu_{B}$, and mass of $\mathcal{O}(\rm eV)$ with transition magnetic moment in the range $3.33\times 10^{-13}\,\mu_{B} - 10^{-12}\,\mu_{B}$ can successfully account for the observed anomalous intensity.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The combination between non-thermal and thermal emission in $\gamma$-ray blazars pushes them to a specific region of the mid-infrared three-dimensional color diagram, the so-called blazar locus, built based on observations performed with the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer. The selection of blazar candidates based on these mid-infrared colors has been extensively used in the past decade in the hunt for the counterparts of unassociated $\gamma$-ray sources observed with the Fermi Large Area Telescope and in the search for new blazars in optical spectroscopic campaigns. Aims. In this work, we provide a theoretical description of the origin of the blazar locus and show how we can reasonably reproduce it with a model consisting of only three spectral components: a log-parabola accounting for the non-thermal emission, and an elliptical host and dust torus accounting for the thermal emission. Methods. We simulate spectral energy distributions for blazars, starting with a pure log-parabola model and then increasing its complexity by adding a template elliptical galaxy and dust torus. From these simulations, we compute the mid-infrared magnitudes and corresponding colors to create our own version of the blazar locus. Results. Our modeling allows for the selection of spectral parameters that better characterize the mid-infrared emission of $\gamma$-ray blazars, such as the log-parabola curvature ($\beta < 0.04$ for 50\% of our sample) and an average spectral peak around $E_p \approx 1.5 \times 10^{-13}$ erg. We also find that the log-parabola is the main spectral component behind the observed mid-infrared blazar colors, although additional components such as a host galaxy and a dust torus are crucial to obtain a precise reconstruction of the blazar locus.
