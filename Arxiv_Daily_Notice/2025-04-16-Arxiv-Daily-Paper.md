 - **Abstract**
 Low-mass quiescent galaxies are thought to predominantly reside in overdense regions, as environmental effects are often invoked to explain their shutdown of star formation. These longer-timescale quenching mechanisms - such as interactions with hot gas in the intracluster medium and dynamical encounters with other cluster galaxies - leave imprints on galaxy morphologies, emphasizing the importance of quantifying the structures of low-mass quiescent galaxies in galaxy clusters at $z<0.5$. Using spectrophotometric data from the UNCOVER and MegaScience programs, we present the first measurement of the quiescent size-mass relation between $7<\log(M_\star/M_\odot)<10$ using JWST imaging, based on a sample of 1100 galaxies in the $z=0.308$ Abell 2744 galaxy cluster. The resulting size-mass relation is systematically larger and flatter than samples of dwarf galaxies in less-rich environments (low-mass clusters and groups), and has a higher scatter than similar-redshift field samples. Both "progenitor bias," where larger, diskier low-mass galaxies enter the cluster at later epochs, and a general expansion of galaxy structure from dynamical interactions could be at play. This evolutionary framework is further supported by the tentative evidence that older low-mass quiescent galaxies in the cluster are more spheroidal. The star-formation histories derived for our cluster sample imply their formation and quenching occurs relatively late, at $z<1.5$. In this scenario, the progenitor population would have disky axis-ratio distributions at cosmic noon, in agreement with recent observations. While this leaves ample time for dynamical interactions to maintain quiescence and drive the observed subsequent morphological evolution post-quenching, the data disfavors an onset of quenching due to the environment.

 - **Abstract**
 Direct collapse of pristine gas in early galaxies is a promissing pathway for forming supermassive black holes (BHs) powering active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at the epoch of reionization (EoR). This seeding mechanism requires suppression of molecular hydrogen (H$_2$) cooling during primordial star formation via intense far-ultraviolet radiation from nearby starburst galaxies clustered in overdense regions. However, non-detection of 21 cm signals from the EoR reported by the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) experiment suggests that such galaxies may also emit X-rays more efficiently than in the local universe, promoting H$_2$ production and thereby potentially quenching massive BH seed formation. In this study, we examine the thermal and chemical evolution of collapsing gas in dark matter halos using a semi-analytic model incorporating observationally calibrated X-ray intensities. We find that strong X-ray irradiation, as suggested by HERA, significantly suppresses direct collapse and leads most halos to experience H$_2$ cooling. Nevertheless, massive BH seeds with $M_\mathrm{BH} \gtrsim 10^4~M_\odot$ still form by $z\simeq 15$, particularly in regions with baryonic streaming motion, and their abundance reaches $\sim 10^{-4}~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-3}$ sufficient to explain the SMBHs identified by JWST spectroscopy at $3<z<6$. While the formation of highly overmassive BHs with masses comparable to their host galaxies is prohibited by X-ray ionization, our model predicts that BH-to-stellar mass ratios of $\simeq 0.01-0.1$ were already established at seeding.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the 4MOST IR AGN survey, the first large-scale optical spectroscopic survey characterizing mid-infrared (MIR) selected obscured active galactic nuclei (AGN). The survey targets $\approx 212,000$ obscured infrared (IR) AGN candidates over $\approx 10,000 \rm \: deg^2$ down to a magnitude limit of $r_{\rm AB}=22.8 \, \rm mag$ and will be $\approx 100 \times$ larger than any existing obscured IR AGN spectroscopic sample. We select the targets using a MIR colour criterion applied to the unWISE catalogue from the WISE all-sky survey, and then apply a $r-W2\geq 5.9 \rm \: mag$ cut; we demonstrate that this selection will mostly identify sources obscured by $N_{\rm H}>10^{22} \rm \: cm^{-2}$. The survey complements the 4MOST X-ray survey, which will follow up $\sim 1\rm M$ eROSITA-selected (typically unobscured) AGN. We perform simulations to predict the quality of the spectra that we will obtain and validate our MIR-optical colour-selection method using X-ray spectral constraints and UV-to-far IR spectral energy distribution (SED) modelling in four well-observed deep-sky fields. We find that: (1) $\approx 80-87\%$ of the WISE-selected targets are AGN down to $r_{\rm AB}=22.1-22.8 \: \rm mag$ of which $\approx 70\%$ are obscured by $N_{\rm H}>10^{22} \: \rm cm^{-2}$, and (2) $\approx 80\%$ of the 4MOST IR AGN sample will remain undetected by the deepest eROSITA observations due to extreme absorption. Our SED fitting results show that the 4MOST IR AGN survey will primarily identify obscured AGN and quasars ($\approx 55\%$ of the sample is expected to have $L_{\rm AGN,IR}>10^{45} \rm \: erg \: s^{-1}$) residing in massive galaxies ($M_{\star}\approx 10^{10}-10^{12} \rm \: M_{\odot}$) at $z\approx 0.5-3.5$ with $ \approx 33\%$ expected to be hosted by starburst galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the launching of magnetized jets from a resistive circumstellar disk within a binary system, employing a unique combination of 3D MHD jet launching simulations (PLUTO code) and post-processed 3D radiative transfer modeling (RADMC-3D code). Our findings reveal a well-defined jet originating from the inner region of the disk, extending to a larger disk area. While the model attains steady states for a single star, a binary system leads to the emergence of tidal effects such as the formation of ``spiral arms'' in the disk and inside the jet. Here we have consistently implemented a time-dependent Roche potential for the gravity of the binary. As a major step forward, we further present the first 3D radiation maps of the dust continuum for the disk-jet structure. In principle, this allows us to compare MHD simulation results to observed disk-outflow features. We, therefore, present convolved images of the dust continuum emission, employing exemplary point spread functions of the MIRI instrument (5~$\mu m$ band) and the ALMA array (320~$\mu m$ band). In these bands, we identify distinguishable features of the disk-jet structure, such as "spiral arms," which we have also seen in the MHD this http URL gas density increased by an order of magnitude, the disk become optically thick at 5~$\mu m$, but remains bright at 320~$\mu$m. At this wavelength, 320~$\mu$m, enhanced structural features in the disk and the base of the wind become more pronounced and are well resolved in the convolved image.

 - **Abstract**
 The dynamics of a binary neutron stars merger is governed by physics under the most extreme conditions, including strong spacetime curvature, ultra-high matter densities, luminous neutrino emission and the rapid amplification of the initial neutron star magnetic fields. Here we systematically explore how sensitive the magnetic field evolution is to the total mass of the merging binary, to the mass ratio of its components, the stellar spins and to the equation of state. For this purpose, we analyze 16 state-of-the-art GRMHD simulations that employ a subgrid-scale model to account for the unresolved small-scale turbulence. We find that strong and rapid amplification of the magnetic field to volume-averaged values of $\sim 10^{16}$~G in the high-density regions is a very robust outcome of a neutron star merger and this result is only marginally impacted by either mass, mass ratio, spin or equation of state.

 - **Abstract**
 Enstatite chondrites (EC) are potential source material for the accretion of Mercury due to their reduced nature and enrichment in volatile elements. Understanding their melting properties is therefore important to better assess a scenario where Mercury formed from these chondrites. Here, we present experimental data on the partial melting of a modified EH4 Indarch EC, which was adjusted to have 18\% more metallic Si than SiO$_2$ in mass, yielding an oxygen fugacity of 3.7 below the iron--wüstite redox buffer and 12 wt\% Si in the metal. Experiments were performed from 0.5 to 5 GPa. Results indicate that the stability field of enstatite expands relative to olivine. This expansion is likely due to the presence of Ca--S and Mg--S complexes in the silicate melt, which enhance SiO$_2$ activity and promote enstatite crystallization. Additionally, sulfides show enrichment in Mg and Ca, up to 22 and 13 wt\% respectively, the main remaining cations being Fe, Cr, and Mn. These high Mg and Ca contents are observed at low temperatures and high silica content in the silicate melt, respectively. High-pressure melts (2 to 5 GPa, 160--400 km depth in Mercury) are Mg-rich, similar to those in Mercury's high-magnesium region (HMR), while low-pressure melts (0.5 to 1 GPa, 40--80 km depth) are Si-rich, comparable to the northern volcanic plains (NVP). Results suggest that a large fraction of Mercury's surface aligns compositionally with these melts, implying that Mercury's mantle could predominantly have a pyroxenitic composition. However, regions with differing compositions, such as aluminum-rich areas like the Caloris basin, suggest local variability in mantle geochemistry. Overall, our results show that if Mercury formed from materials similar to EC, batch melting of its primitive pyroxenite mantle would yield magmas with compositions resembling those of most rocks observed on the surface.
#### Spectroscopic r-Process Abundance Retrieval for Kilonovae III: Self-Consistent Spectral and Light Curve Modeling of the GW170817 Kilonova

 - **Abstract**
 The observed spectra and light curves of the kilonova produced by the GW170817 binary neutron star merger provide complementary insights, but self-consistently modeling both the spectral- and time-domain has proven challenging. Here, we model the optical/infrared light curves of the GW170817 kilonova, using the properties and physical conditions of the ejecta as inferred from detailed modeling of its spectra. Using our software tool SPARK, we first infer the $r$-process abundance pattern of the kilonova ejecta from spectra obtained at 1.4, 2.4, 3.4, and 4.4 days post-merger. From these abundances, we compute time-dependent radioactive heating rates and the wavelength-, time-, and velocity-dependent opacities of the ejecta. We use these inferred heating rates and opacities to inform a kilonova light curve model, to self-consistently reproduce the observed early-time light curves and to infer a total ejecta mass of $M_{\mathrm{ej}} = {0.11}~M_{\odot}$, towards the higher end of that inferred from previous studies. The combination of a large ejecta mass from our light curve modeling and the presence of both red and blue ejecta from our spectral modeling suggests the existence of a highly magnetized hypermassive neutron star remnant that survives for $\sim$$0.01 - 0.5$ s and launches a blue wind, followed by fast, red neutron-rich winds launched from a magnetized accretion disk. By modeling both spectra and light curves together, we demonstrate how combining information from both the spectral and time domains can more robustly determine the physical origins of the ejected material.

 - **Abstract**
 Thermodynamics of solar wind bulk plasma have been routinely measured and quantified, unlike those of solar energetic particles (SEPs), whose thermodynamic properties have remained elusive until recently. The thermodynamic kappa (\(\kappa_{\rm EP}\)) that parameterizes the statistical distribution of SEP kinetic energy contains information regarding the population's level of correlation and effective degrees of freedom (\({\rm d_{eff}}\)). At the same time, the intermittent kappa (\(\kappa_{\Delta B}\)) that parameterizes the statistical distribution of magnetic field increments contains information about the correlation and \({\rm d_{eff}}\) involved in magnetic field fluctuations. Correlations between particles can be affected by magnetic field fluctuations, leading to a relationship between \(\kappa_{\rm EP}\) and \(\kappa_{\Delta B}\). In this paper, we examine the relationship of \({\rm d_{eff}}\) and entropy between energetic particles and the magnetic field via the spatial variation of their corresponding parameter kappa values. We compare directly the values of \(\kappa_{\rm EP}\) and \(\kappa_{\Delta B}\) using Parker Solar Probe IS\(\odot\)IS and FIELDS measurements during an SEP event associated with an interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME). Remarkably, we find that \(\kappa_{\rm EP}\) and \(\kappa_{\Delta B}\) are anti-correlated via a linear relationship throughout the passing of the ICME, indicating a proportional exchange of \({\rm d_{eff}}\) from the magnetic field to energetic particles, i.e., \(\kappa_{\Delta B} \sim (-0.15 \pm 0.03)\kappa_{\rm EP}\), interpreted as an effective coupling ratio. This finding is crucial for improving our understanding of ICMEs and suggests that they help to produce an environment that enables the transfer of entropy from the magnetic field to energetic particles due to changes in intermittency of the magnetic field.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations expanded our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution, yet key challenges persist in the X-ray regime, crucial for studying Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). These limitations drive the development of next-generation observatories such as ESA's NewAthena. Now in phase B (preliminary design), the mission requires extensive testing to ensure compliance with its scientific goals, particularly given the uncertainties surrounding high redshift AGN. This work leverages the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulation to build an X-ray AGN mock catalogue and assess the performance of NewAthena's WFI. We created a Super Massive Black Hole (SMBH) light cone, spanning 10 deg2, with corrections to account for the limited resolution of the simulation and X-ray properties derived in post-processing. The resulting catalogue reveals a 5* overabundance of faint AGN compared to current X-ray constraints, an inconsistency potentially resolved by invoking a higher Compton-thick (CTK) fraction and intrinsic X-ray weakness, as suggested by recent JWST findings. An end-to-end survey simulation using SIXTE predicts 250000 AGN detections, including 20,000 at z > 3 and 35 in the Epoch of Reionization (z > 6); notably, only AGN with LX > 43.5 erg/s are detectable at z > 6. The analysis also forecasts a significant population of detectable CTK AGN, even beyond z > 4. These findings suggest X-ray observations will, for the first time, probe a significant AGN population in the EoR, offering new insights into SMBH growth. They also provide key input for refining NewAthena's mission design and optimizing its survey strategy.
#### The origin of X-ray intra-day variability in HBL PKS 2155-304

 - **Abstract**
 The origin and physics of X-ray intra-day variability (IDV) in blazars, which is a long-standing issue, is studied by modelling the broad-band X-ray spectrum, the light curves (LCs), and the Fourier time lags. We present the timing analysis of three archived XMM-Newton observations with a total exposure of $>80$ ks of PKS 2155-304, which is one of the brightest and most studied HBLs in the X-ray band. For each observation, we constructed averaged X-ray spectra in 0.5-10 keV band, as well as 100 s binned LCs in various sub-bands. We performed the Bayesian power spectral density (PSD) analysis and Fourier time-lag analyses of the variable LCs. The results are carefully modelled in the context of a multi-zone jet model. PSD analysis reveals that the X-ray variability can be characterised by red noise. The lag-frequency spectra measured in two observations show only the soft or negative lags, with the magnitude of the lags increasing as the frequency decreases. For another observation, the lag-frequency spectra are characterised by small positive or zero time lags at the lowest frequencies, which drops to negative values at higher frequencies. The magnitude of the soft lags ranges from $\sim5$ to $\sim40$ minutes, and increases with the energy difference of two compared LCs. The observed X-ray spectra and lag-frequency spectra can both be successfully described by our proposed two-zone model, with the physical parameters constrained in a fully acceptable space. Moreover, the LC profiles at different energy bands can be satisfactorily reproduced by only varying the injection rate of the energetic electrons. The IDV of PKS 2155-304 should be caused by the injection of energetic electrons, and accelerated by shocks formed in a weakly magnetised jet.
#### Cosmic-Ray Constraints on the Flux of Ultra-High-Energy Neutrino Event KM3-230213A

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of a $\simeq220$~PeV muon neutrino by the KM3NeT neutrino telescope offers an unprecedented opportunity to probe the Universe at extreme energies. We analyze the origin of this event under three scenarios, viz., a transient point source, a diffuse astrophysical emission, and line-of-sight interaction of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECR; $E \gtrsim 0.1$~EeV). Our analysis includes the flux from both a KM3NeT-only fit and a joint fit, incorporating data from KM3NeT, IceCube, and Pierre Auger Observatory. If the neutrino event originates from transients, it requires a new population of transient that is energetic, gamma-ray dark, and more abundant than known ones. In the framework of diffuse astrophysical emission, we compare the required local UHECR energy injection rate at $\gtrsim4$ EeV, assuming a proton primary, with the rate derived from the flux measurements by Auger. This disfavors the KM3NeT-only fit at all redshifts, while the joint fit remains viable for $z\gtrsim 1$, based on redshift evolution models of known source populations. For cosmogenic origin from point sources, our results suggest that the luminosity obtained at redshifts $z \lesssim 1$ from the joint fit is compatible with the Eddington luminosity of supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei.
#### Evidence for GeV Gamma-Ray Emission from Intense GRB 240529A During the Afterglow's Shallow Decay Phase

 - **Abstract**
 X-ray light curves of gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows exhibit various features, with the shallow decay phase being particularly puzzling. While some studies report absence of the X-ray shallow decay for hyper-energetic GRBs, recently discovered GRB 240529A shows a clear shallow decay phase with an isotropic gamma-ray energy of \SI{2.2e54}{erg}, making it a highly unusual case compared to typical GRBs. In order to investigate the physical mechanism of the shallow decay, we perform the \textit{Fermi}-LAT analysis of GRB 240529A along with \textit{Swift}-XRT analysis. We find no jet break feature in the X-ray light curve and then give the lower bound of the collimation-corrected jet energy of $>10^{52}$~erg, which is close to the maximum rotational energy of a magnetar. Our LAT data analysis reveals evidence of GeV emission with a statistical significance of $4.5\sigma$ during the shallow decay phase, which can be interpreted as the first case for hyper-energetic GRBs with a typical shallow decay phase. The GeV to keV flux ratio is calculated to be $4.2\pm2.3$. Together with X-ray spectral index, this indicates an inverse Compton origin of the GeV emission. Multiwavelength modeling based on time-dependent simulations tested two promising models, the energy injection and wind models. Both models can explain the X-ray and gamma-ray data, while our modeling demonstrates that gamma-ray observations, along with future GeV--TeV observations by CTAO, will distinguish between them.

 - **Abstract**
 Radio-emitting active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are common in elliptical galaxies and AGN feedback is one of the possible mechanisms for regulating star formation in massive galaxies. It is unclear if all passive galaxy populations host radio AGNs and if AGN feedback is a plausible mechanism for truncating or regulating star formation in these galaxies. To determine if radio AGNs are common in passive spiral galaxies, we have measured the radio emission of 38 low-redshift passive spiral galaxies using RACS-low at 887.5 MHz and VLASS at 3 GHz. We selected a subset of 2MRS galaxies with negligible WISE 12 $\mu$m emission from warm dust, and spiral morphologies from HyperLeda, RC3, 2MRS and manual inspection. In contrast to comparable early-type galaxies, our sample has no significant radio detections, with radio flux densities below 1 mJy, implying that radio AGNs are rare or non-existent in passive spirals. Using the combined radio images and assuming radio luminosity is proportional to $K$-band luminosity, we find ${\rm log}~L_\nu \lesssim 9.01-0.4~M_K$. This falls below the radio luminosities of passive elliptical galaxies, implying radio luminosity in passive galaxies is correlated with host galaxy morphology and kinematics.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we present a comprehensive and systematic study of the statistical complexity, originally introduced by López-Ruiz, Mancini, and Calbet [Phys. Lett. A 209, 321-326 (1995)], across a broad range of compact star models. We explore how complexity correlates not only with macroscopic observables such as mass and radius, but also with the microscopic characteristics of the underlying equation of state. By incorporating both realistic equations of state and analytical solutions to Einstein's field equations, we demonstrate that gravitational mass plays a dominant role in determining the behavior of complexity. Furthermore, we show that strong phase transitions within the stellar interior, such as those hypothesized in hybrid stars, can manifest as distinct features in the complexity profile, offering a potential informational signature of such transitions. This work offers new insights into the link between information theory and compact object physics, highlighting complexity's potential as a diagnostic tool in astrophysics.

 - **Abstract**
 High-energy physics often motivates multi-field inflationary scenarios where stochastic effects play a crucial role. Peculiar to multi-field models, the noise-induced centrifugal force results in a longer duration of inflation depending on the number of fields, even when the stochastic noises themselves are small. We show that, in such small-noise regimes, the number of fields generically discriminates whether inflation successfully terminates or lasts forever. Our results indicate that inflation with an extremely large number of fields may fail to realise our observable Universe.
#### Bright bursts with sub-millisecond structures of FRB 20230607A in a highly magnetized environment

 - **Abstract**
 We report the observations of a repeating FRB 20230607A for 15.6 hours spanning 16 months using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST) with the detection of 565 bursts. We present three bright bursts with detailed temporal/spectral structures. We also report that one burst carries a narrow component with a width of only 0.3 ms, which is surrounded by broader components. This suggests that repeaters can make both narrow and broad components in one burst. With the narrow spike, we precisely measure the dispersion measure (DM) of $362.85 \pm 0.15 \;{\rm pc\,cm^{-3}}$ and the Faraday rotation measures (RMs) of and $-12249.0\pm 1.5 \; {\rm rad\,m^{-2}}$. We also analyze the statistical distribution of the burst parameters, including waiting times, temporal widths, central frequencies and frequency widths, fluences and energies, all showing typical distributions of known active repeaters. In particular, most bursts show narrow spectra with $\Delta\nu/\nu_0 = 0.125\pm 0.001$. This fact, together with the narrow 0.3 ms spike, strongly suggests a magnetospheric origin of the FRB emission. Based on a predicted correlation between RM and the luminosity of a persistent radio source (PRS) by Yang et al., we predict that PRS should have a specific luminosity of the order of $10^{29} \ {\rm erg \ s^{-1} \ Hz^{-1}}$ and encourage a search for such a PRS.

 - **Abstract**
 We observed three recurrent blowout jets in an active regio with Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) aboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). Using Helioseismic Magnetic Imager (HMI) data. We found that the magnetic flux of an emerging negative pole increases steadily before declining just as the jets erupt. Certain physical quantities, like the total unsigned vertical current, align with the periodicity of the jets. The differential affine velocity of the vector magnetograms reveals strong shear around the negative pole. The Doppler velocity map, calculated from the H$\alpha$ spectra observed by the Chinese H$\alpha$ Solar Explorer (CHASE), shows upflows with large initial velocity before it can be observed by AIA. The magnetic field derived from the nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF) model suggests a topology akin to fan-spine structure, consistent with AIA images. We calculated the evolution of volumetric helicity ratio using the NLFFF model and found its phase aligns with the jet flux in AIA 171 Å. These results suggest that recurrent jets may be triggered by the accumulation and release of energy and helicity, driven by emergence, shearing and cancellation of photospheric magnetic field.

 - **Abstract**
 Over the past decade, there has been a significant increase in the reporting of extensive and luminous star-forming regions associated with explosive outflows. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of understanding of the possible physical mechanisms that produce such energetic and isotropic events. Then, we propose a gravitational interaction as a likely mechanism that could trigger explosive outflows in dense star-forming regions. This could constrain the physical conditions that generate an explosive outflow produced by the close dynamical encounter of a runaway star with a clump cluster in dynamical equilibrium. Then, we have produced a set of $N$-body simulations that account for the collision of a 10M$_\odot$ stellar object with a cluster of particles with a mass that ranges from 0 to 50 \msun. We propose a parameter to describe the interaction, the evaporation parameter, that represents the fraction of stars that become unbound. The main result is that, when the cluster mass is less than, or up to a few times the stellar mass, the collision will produce an explosive outflow, ejecting a significant fraction of the cluster members with velocities larger than the impact velocity. All of our models produce an explosive outflow, with different characteristics, which increases the probability that a close encounter could be responsible for producing the observed flows.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive analysis of 2RXP J130159.6-635806, a persistent low-luminosity Be/X-ray pulsar, focusing on its transition to a spin equilibrium state and the discovery of a bimodal luminosity distribution revealing possibly a new accretion regime. Using data from NuSTAR, Swift, XMM-Newton, and Chandra observatories, we investigate changes in the pulsar's timing and spectral properties. After more than 20 years of continuous spin-up, the pulsar's spin period stabilized, marking the onset of spin equilibrium. This transition was accompanied by the emergence of a previously unobserved accretion regime at $L_{\rm bol} = (2.0_{-1.0}^{+2.3})\times 10^{34}$ erg s$^{-1}$, an order of magnitude lower than its earlier quiescent state. After that, the source occasionally switched between these regimes, remaining in each state for extended periods, with the transition time from a luminosity of $10^{35}$ erg s$^{-1}$ to $10^{34}$ erg s$^{-1}$ taking less than 2.3 day. The analysis of the spectral data collected during this new low-luminosity state revealed a two-hump shape which is different from the cutoff power-law spectra observed at higher luminosities. The discovery of pulsations in this state, together with the hard spectral shape, demonstrates ongoing accretion. We estimate the magnetic field strength to be $\sim 10^{13}$ G based on indirect methods. Additionally, we report a hint of a previously undetected $\sim$90-day orbital period in the system.

 - **Abstract**
 Asteroseismic modelling is crucial for upcoming missions like PLATO, CubeSpec, and Roman. Despite significant progress, discrepancies between observations and theoretical predictions introduce biases in stellar characterisation at the precision required by PLATO. Current models typically ignore magnetic activity, assuming its effects are hidden within surface effects. However, recent studies have shown significant impacts of magnetic activity on the Sun's asteroseismic characterisation using forward modelling. Using GOLF and BiSON observations of two full solar activity cycles, we quantified the impact of magnetic activity on solar mean density and acoustic radius inversions. Observations were segmented into yearly overlapping snapshots, each offset by 91.25 days. Inversions were performed for each snapshot to determine mean density and acoustic radius, tracking their temporal evolution and estimating systematic uncertainty due to magnetic activity. We observed a clear imprint of the magnetic activity cycle on solar mean density and acoustic radius through helioseismic inversions, consistent across GOLF and BiSON datasets. This imprint is the largest source of systematic uncertainty in solar asteroseismic characterisation. Including low radial-order modes mitigates these effects more significantly than previously measured for other stellar variables. We recommend asteroseismic values for solar mean density (1.4104 \pm 0.0051 g/cm3) and acoustic radius (3722.0 \pm 4.1 s), averaged over two activity cycles. These values account for major systematic errors, achieving high precision (0.36% for mean density and 0.11% for acoustic radius). These results are promising for high-precision characterisation of Sun-like stars, a better-constrained mean density being able to enhance the precision of stellar radius estimate, which is crucial for exoplanetary system characterisation.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore SN 2023pel, the most recent event associated with gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), specifically GRB 230812B. SN 2023pel has a high luminosity and low expansion velocities compared to other GRB-SNe. These properties seem difficult to reconcile with a single nickel power source. We searched for models that can explain the properties of this event. We calculated a grid of hydrodynamic models based on pre-SN structures derived from evolutionary calculations. We compared our models with observations of SN~2023pel and selected our preferred model using statistical analysis, taking both light curves and expansion velocities into account. This allowed us to derive a set of physical properties for SN~2023pel. Our models suggest that the most probable scenario involves a millisecond magnetar as the primary power source, supplemented by energy from radioactive decay. Our preferred model has a spin period of P = 3.2 ms, a magnetic field of B = 28 x 10^14 G, an explosion energy of 2.3 foe, a nickel mass of M_Ni= 0.24 solar masses, and an ejected mass of 3.4 solar masses. Alternatively, we find that a purely nickel-powered model also provides a good match with the observations, though M_Ni > 0.8 solar masses are always required. However, the combination of such high values of M_Ni and low M_ej is difficult to reconcile, indicating that this scenario is less probable. We have also identified a specific region within the peak luminosity-velocity plane where an additional energy source beyond nickel may be necessary to power SNe with characteristics similar to SN~2023pel. Our study indicates that an additional energy source beyond radioactive decay is essential to explain the high brightness and relatively low expansion velocities of SN 2023pel. A magnetar-powered model, similar to the models proposed for the very luminous GRB-SN 2011kl, aligns well with these characteristics.

 2MASS J04381486+2611399 (or J0438) is one of the few young brown dwarfs (BD) with a highly inclined ($i\!\sim\!70^\circ$) disk. Here we report results from JWST-MIRI MRS, HST-ACS and ALMA Band 7 observations. Despite its late spectral type (M7.25), the spectrum of J0438 resembles those of inner disks around earlier-type stars (K1-M5, T Tauri stars), with a volatile reservoir lacking hydrocarbons (except for acetylene, C$_2$H$_2$) and dominated by water. Other identified species are H$_2$, CO$_2$, HCN, [Ar$^{+}$], and [Ne$^{+}$]. The dominance of water over hydrocarbons is driven by multiple factors such as disk dynamics, young disk age, low accretion rate and possible inner disk clearing. J0438 appears highly dynamic, showing a seesaw-like variability and extended emission in H$_2 \,\,\, S$(1), $S$(3), $S$(5), [Ne$^{+}$] and CO ($J=3-2$). Interestingly, the CO emission reaches up to 400 au from the brown dwarf, suggesting ongoing infalling/outflowing activity impacting the disk chemistry. These observations underscore the combined power of JWST, HST and ALMA in characterizing the chemical diversity and dynamics of brown dwarf disks.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first high-precision model for the group-scale strong lensing system CASSOWARY 19 (CSWA19), utilising images from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Sixteen member galaxies identified via the red-sequence method, and the main halo, all modelled as the dual Pseudo Isothermal Elliptical profile (dPIE), are incorporated into a parametric lens model alongside an external shear field. To model the system, we adopt the PyAutoLens software package, employing a progressive search chain strategy for realizing the transition of source model from multiple Sérsic profiles to a brightness-adaptive pixelization, which uses 1000 pixels in the source plane to reconstruct the background source corresponding to 177,144 image pixels in the image plane. Our results indicate that the total mass within the Einstein radius is $M_{\theta_\mathrm{E}}$ $\approx 1.41\times10^{13}$M$_{\odot}$ and the average slope of the total mass density $\rho (r)\propto r^{-\gamma}$ is $\tilde{\gamma}=1.33$ within the effective radius. This slope is shallower than those measured in galaxies and groups but is closer to those of galaxy clusters. In addition, our approach successfully resolves the two merging galaxies in the background source and yields a total magnification of $\mu=103.18^{+0.23}_{-0.19}$, which is significantly higher than the outcomes from previous studies of CSWA19. In summary, our research demonstrates the effectiveness of the brightness-adaptive pixelization source reconstruction technique for modelling group-scale strong lensing systems. It can serve as a technical reference for future investigations into pixel-level modelling of the group- and cluster-scale strong lensing systems.
