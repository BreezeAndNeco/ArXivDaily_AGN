 - **Abstract**
 Pulsar timing, i.e. the analysis of the arrival times of pulses from a pulsar, is a powerful tool in modern astrophysics. It allows us to measure the time delays of an electromagnetic signal caused by a number of physical processes as the signal propagates from the source to the observer. Joint analysis of an ensemble of pulsars (Pulsar Timing Arrays, PTAs) can be used to address a variety of astrophysical challenges, including the problem of direct detection of space-time metric perturbations, in particular those induced by gravitational waves. Here we present a comprehensive review of the current state of research in the field of pulsar timing, with particular emphasis on recent advancements in the detection of stochastic background of nHz gravitational waves, reported by a number of international collaborations such as NANOGrav (North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves), European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA), Chinese Pulsar Timing Array (CPTA) and Indian Pulsar Timing Array (InPTA), which are joining their efforts within the International PTA (IPTA). Additionally, this paper reviews contemporary constraints on scalar ultralight matter (pseudoscalar bosons), obtained from timing and polarimetry data of pulsars. The prospects for applying these tools to other problems in fundamental physics and cosmology are explored.

 - **Abstract**
 Hyperluminous supersoft X-ray sources, such as bright extragalactic sources characterized by particularly soft X-ray spectra, offer a unique opportunity to study accretion onto supermassive black holes in extreme conditions. Examples of hyperluminous supersoft sources are tidal disruption events, systems exhibiting quasi-periodic eruptions, changing-look AGN, and anomalous nuclear transients. Although these objects are rare phenomena amongst the population of X-ray sources, we developed an efficient algorithm to identify promising candidates exploiting archival observations. In this work, we present the results of a search for hyperluminous supersoft X-ray sources in the recently released Chandra catalog of serendipitous X-ray sources. This archival search has been performed via both a manual implementation of the algorithm we developed and a novel machine-learning-based approach. This search identified a new tidal disruption event, which might have occurred in an intermediate-mass black hole. This event occurred between 2001 and 2002, making it one of the first tidal disruption events ever observed by Chandra.

 - **Abstract**
 Brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) lie deep within the largest gravitationally bound structures in existence. Though some cluster finding techniques identify the position of the BCG and use it as the cluster center, other techniques may not automatically include these coordinates. This can make studying BCGs in such surveys difficult, forcing researchers to either adopt oversimplified algorithms or perform cumbersome visual identification. For large surveys, there is a need for a fast and reliable way of obtaining BCG coordinates. We propose machine learning to accomplish this task and train a neural network to identify positions of candidate BCGs given no more information than multiband photometric images. We use both mock observations from The Three Hundred project and real ones from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), and we quantify the performance. Training on simulations yields a squared correlation coefficient, R$^2$, between predictions and ground truth of R$^2 \approx 0.94$ when testing on simulations, which decreases to R$^2 \approx 0.60$ when testing on real data due to discrepancies between datasets. Limiting the application of this method to real clusters more representative of the training data, such those with a BCG r-band magnitude $r_{\text{BCG}} \leq 16.5$, yields R$^2 \approx 0.99$. The method performs well up to a redshift of at least $z\approx 0.6$. We find this technique to be a promising method to automate and accelerate the identification of BCGs in large datasets.
#### New constraints on the evolution of the MHI-M* scaling relation combining CHILES and MIGHTEE-HI data

 - **Abstract**
 The improved sensitivity of interferometric facilities to the 21-cm line of atomic hydrogen (HI) enables studies of its properties in galaxies beyond the local Universe. In this work, we perform a 21 cm line spectral stacking analysis combining the MIGHTEE and CHILES surveys in the COSMOS field to derive a robust HI-stellar mass relation at z=0.36. In particular, by stacking thousands of star-forming galaxies subdivided into stellar mass bins, we optimize the signal-to-noise ratio of targets and derive mean HI masses in the different stellar mass intervals for the investigated galaxy population. We combine spectra from the two surveys, estimate HI masses, and derive the scaling relation log10(MHI) = (0.32 +- 0.04)log10(M*) + (6.65 +- 0.36). Our findings indicate that galaxies at z=0.36 are HI richer than those at z=0, but HI poorer than those at z=1, with a slope consistent across redshift, suggesting that stellar mass does not significantly affect HI exchange mechanisms. We also observe a slower growth rate HI relative to the molecular gas, supporting the idea that the accretion of cold gas is slower than the rate of consumption of molecular gas to form stars. This study contributes to understanding the role of atomic gas in galaxy evolution and sets the stage for future development of the field in the upcoming SKA era.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar mergers and common-envelope evolution are fast (dynamical-timescale) interactions in binary stars that drastically alter their evolution. They are key to understanding a plethora of astrophysical phenomena. Stellar mergers are thought to produce blue straggler stars, blue supergiants, and stars with peculiar rotation and surface chemical abundances. Common-envelope evolution is proposed as a key stage in the formation of gravitational wave sources, X-ray binaries, type Ia supernovae, cataclysmic variables, and other systems. A significant fraction (tens of percent) of binary stars undergo such a phase during their evolution. In this chapter, we first discuss processes leading to a stellar merger or common-envelope phase. We then explain these complex interactions, starting from underlying physical principles like entropy sorting in stellar mergers and the energy formalism in common envelopes. This is followed by a more complete picture revealed by three-dimensional (magneto)hydrodynamical simulations. The outcomes of these interactions are discussed comprehensively and special emphasis is given to the role of magnetic fields. Both stellar mergers and common-envelope evolution remain far from fully understood, and we conclude by highlighting open questions in their study.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of post-starburst ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs), identified through spectroscopic analysis with KCWI at the Keck II Telescope. Our analysis is based on a sample of 44 candidate UDGs selected from the Systematically Measuring Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies (SMUDGes) program. Our measured spectroscopic redshifts reveal $\sim 80\%$ of the entire KCWI sample exhibit large physical sizes ($R_{e} \gtrsim 1~{\rm kpc}$) and low surface brightnesses ($24 \lesssim \mu_{0,g} \lesssim 25$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$) which categorize them as UDGs. We find $20\%$ of the confirmed UDG population contain post-starburst (or K+A) features, characterized by minimal to no emission in H$\beta$ indicative of quenched star formation and a predominant presence of spectral A-type stars. Studying the local environments of the post-starburst UDGs, we find that half are isolated systems, including two systems that reside $2-3~R_{\rm vir}$ away from potential nearby massive hosts ($M_{\star} >10^{10}~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$). Without the influence of external environmental mechanisms, these post-starburst UDGs may represent systems experiencing star formation feedback such that a recent burst may lead to (at least temporary) quenching. Overall, our results highlight the potentially diverse quenching pathways of UDGs in the local Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Canonically, a protoplanetary disk is thought to undergo (gravito-)viscous evolution, wherein the angular momentum of the accreting material is transported outwards. However, several lines of reasoning suggest that the turbulent viscosity in a typical protoplanetary disk is insufficient to drive the observed accretion rates. An emerging paradigm suggests that radially extended magnetic disk winds may play a crucial role in the disk evolution. We propose a global model of magnetic wind-driven accretion for evolution of protoplanetary disks, based on the insights gained from local shearing box simulations. Here we develop this model and constrain its parameters with the help of theoretical expectations and comparison with observations. The magnetic wind is characterized with the associated loss of angular momentum and mass, which depend on the local disk conditions and stellar properties. We incorporate the disk winds self-consistently in the code FEOSAD and study formation and long-term evolution of protoplanetary disks. We include disk self-gravity and an adaptive turbulent alpha, while the co-evolution of dust is also considered. Synthetic observations are obtained via radiation thermo-chemical code ProDiMo. The models with inclusion of disk winds satisfy general expectations from both theory and observations. The disk wind parameters can be guided by observational constraints and the synthetic observations resulting from such a model compare favorably with the selected ALMA survey data of Class II disks. The proposed magnetic disk wind model is a significant step forward in the direction of representing a more complete disk evolution, wherein the disk experiences concurrent torques from viscous, gravitational, and magnetic wind processes.

 - **Abstract**
 Radiation pressure is a key mechanism by which stellar feedback disrupts molecular clouds and drives HII region expansion. This includes direct radiation pressure exerted by UV photons on dust grains, pressure associated with photoionization, and infrared (IR) radiation pressure on grains due to dust-reprocessed IR photons. We present a new method that combines high resolution mid-IR luminosities from JWST-MIRI, optical attenuation and nebular line measurements from VLT-MUSE, and HST H$\alpha$-based region sizes to estimate the strength of radiation pressure in $\approx 18,000$ HII regions across 19 nearby star-forming galaxies. This is the most extensive and direct estimate of these terms beyond the Local Group to date. In the disks of galaxies, we find that the total reprocessed IR pressure is on average 5% of the direct UV radiation pressure. This fraction rises to 10% in galaxy centers. We expect reprocessed IR radiation pressure to dominate over UV radiation pressure in regions where $L_{\rm F2100W}/L_{\rm H\alpha}^{\rm corr} \gtrsim 75$. Radiation pressure due to H ionizations is lower than pressure on dust in our sample, but appears likely to dominate the radiation pressure budget in dwarf galaxies similar to the Small Magellanic Cloud. The contribution from all radiation pressure terms appears to be subdominant compared to thermal pressure from ionized gas, reinforcing the view that radiation pressure is most important in compact, heavily embedded, and young regions.

 - **Abstract**
 Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections (ICMEs) are the primary sources of geomagnetic storms at Earth. Negative out-of-ecliptic component (Bz) of magnetic field in the ICME or its associated sheath region is necessary for it to be geo-effective. For this reason, magnetohydrodynamic simulations of CMEs containing data-constrained flux ropes are more suitable for forecasting their geo-effectiveness as compared to hydrodynamic models of the CME. ICMEs observed in situ by radially aligned spacecraft can provide an important setup to validate the physics-based heliospheric modeling of CMEs. In this work, we use the constant-turn flux rope (CTFR) model to study an ICME that was observed in situ by Solar Orbiter (SolO) and at Earth, when they were in a near-radial alignment. This was a stealth CME that erupted on 2020 April 14 and reached Earth on 2020 April 20 with a weak shock and a smoothly rotating magnetic field signature. We found that the CTFR model was able to reproduce the rotating magnetic field signature at both SolO and Earth with very good accuracy. The simulated ICME arrived 5 hours late at SolO and 5 hours ahead at Earth, when compared to the observed ICME. We compare the propagation of the CME front through the inner heliosphere using synthetic J-maps and those observed in the heliospheric imager data and discuss the role of incorrect ambient SW background on kinematics of the simulated CME. This study supports the choice of the CTFR model for reproducing the magnetic field of ICMEs.
#### Using Polar Faculae to Determine the Sun's High-Latitude Rotation Rate. II: Simulations and New Measurements

 - **Abstract**
 In a previous paper, I described a new way of determining the high-latitude solar rotation rate statistically from space-time maps of polar faculae observed in the 6767 Å continuum by the Michelson Doppler Interferometer (MDI) on the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) Sheeley (2024). Now, I have tested the technique by applying it to simulated images whose faculae have known speeds, and I have been able to recover those speeds with an accuracy better than 0.01 km s$^{-1}$. Repeated measurements of the Sun's polar faculae gave the same high-latitude profile as before, but with a slightly faster synodic rotation rate of 9.$^{\circ}$10 day$^{-1}$ and a rotation period of 39.6 days. Applying this space-time tracking procedure to magnetic flux elements observed with the Helioseismic Magnetic Imager (HMI) on the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), I obtained a similar rotation profile with a speed of 9.$^{\circ}$55 day$^{-1}$ and a synodic rotation period of 37.7 days. These rates are comparable to polar rotation rates, obtained by other techniques, but the new latitude profiles are noticeably flatter than the quartic fits to those prior measurements.

 - **Abstract**
 Since their first detection in 2015, gravitational wave observations have enabled a variety of studies, ranging from stellar evolution to fundamental physics. In this chapter, we focus on their use as "standard sirens", describing the different methodologies that can be adopted to measure cosmological parameters with compact object binaries from ground-based gravitational wave detectors. We cover the three main classes of standard siren measurements, showing how the expansion of the Universe can be constrained through Bayesian statistics both with gravitational wave observations alone and with the aid of electromagnetic emission from the electromagnetic counterpart of gravitational wave events and from galaxies. Finally, we summarize the existing measurements and prospects for future constraints on cosmological parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 A reexamination of period finding algorithms is prompted by new large area astronomical sky surveys that can identify billions of individual sources having a thousand or more observations per source. This large increase in data necessitates fast and efficient period detection algorithms. In this paper, we provide an initial description of an algorithm that is being used for detection of periodic behavior in a sample of 1.5 billion objects using light curves generated from Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) data (Bellm et al. 2019; Masci et al. 2018). We call this algorithm "Fast Periodicity Weighting" (FPW), derived using a Gaussian Process (GP) formalism. A major advantage of the FPW algorithm for ZTF analysis is that it is agnostic to the details of the phase-folded waveform. Periodic sources in ZTF show a wide variety of waveforms, some quite complex, including eclipsing objects, sinusoidally varying objects also exhibiting eclipses, objects with cyclotron emission at various phases, and accreting objects with complex waveforms. We describe the FPW algorithm and its application to ZTF, and provide efficient code for both CPU and GPU.

 - **Abstract**
 The Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) is a coded aperture gamma-ray instrument with a large field of view that was designed to detect and localize transient events. When a transient is detected, either on-board or externally, the BAT saves time-tagged event (TTE) data which provides the highest quality information of the locations of the photons on the detector plane and their energies. This data can be used to produce spectra, lightcurves, and sky images of a transient event. While these data products are produced by the Swift Data Center and can be produced by current software, they are often preset to certain time and energy intervals which has limited their use in the current time domain and multi-messenger environment. Here, we introduce a new capability for the BatAnalysis python package to download and process TTE data under an open-source pythonic framework that allows for easy interfacing with other python packages. The new capabilities of the BatAnalysis software allows for TTE data to be used by the community in a variety of advanced customized analyses of astrophysical sources which BAT may have TTE data for, such as Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs), Low Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXB), Soft Gamma-ray Repeaters, magnetars, and many other sources. We highlight the usefulness of the BatAnalysis package in analyzing TTE data produced by an on-board GRB trigger, a FRB external trigger, a sub-threshold detection of the LMXB EXO 0748-676, and an external trigger of a GRB that BAT detected during a slew.

 - **Abstract**
 Multi-messenger observations of gravitational waves and electromagnetic emission from compact object mergers offer unique insights into the structure of neutron stars, the formation of heavy elements, and the expansion rate of the Universe. With the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) gravitational-wave detectors currently in their fourth observing run (O4), it is an exciting time for detecting these mergers. However, assessing whether to follow up a candidate gravitational-wave event given limited telescope time and resources is challenging; the candidate can be a false alert due to detector glitches, or may not have any detectable electromagnetic counterpart even if it is real. GWSkyNet-Multi is a deep learning model developed to facilitate follow-up decisions by providing real-time classification of candidate events, using localization information released in LVK rapid public alerts. Here we introduce GWSkyNet-Multi II, an updated model targeted towards providing more robust and informative predictions during O4 and beyond. Specifically, the model now provides normalized probability scores and associated uncertainties for each of the four corresponding source categories released by the LVK: glitch, binary black hole, neutron star-black hole, and binary neutron star. Informed by explainability studies of the original model, the updated model architecture is also significantly simplified, including replacing input images with intuitive summary values, making it more interpretable. For significant O4 event alerts issued between May 2023 and December 2024, GWSkyNet-Multi II produces a prediction that is consistent with the updated LVK classification for 93% of events. The updated model can be used by the community to help make time-critical follow-up decisions.
#### An embedded Disk (eDisk) in the IceAge: Investigating the jet and outflow from CED 110 IRS4

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive study of the large-scale structure, jet and outflow morphology, and kinematics of the Class 0/I protostellar binary Ced 110 IRS4, using JWST NIRCam (F150W and F410M) and MIRI MRS observations from the JWST ERC program IceAge, along with ALMA data from the Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk) program. NIRCam images, combined with ALMA continuum and CO data, reveal arc-like structures ($\sim$1100 au), suggesting a dense envelope around the protostars. We detect disk shadows from both protostars in F150W. The MIRI MRS IFU data reveal a jet from both protostars in multiple [Fe II] lines, [Ar II] 6.99 $\mu$m and [Ne II] 12.81 $\mu$m, marking the first detection of a jet from the system. The [Fe II] (5.34 $\mu$m) jet from Ced 110 IRS4A has a width of $\leq$ 51~au at the protostellar location, with a large opening angle of 23\arcdeg{} $\pm$ 4\arcdeg. After inclination correction, the jet velocity is 124 km s$^{-1}$, corresponding to a dynamical timescale of 25 years. The molecular H$_2$ outflow displays a distinct morphology resembling two hemispheres placed back-to-back. The consistent H$_2$ emission extent across transitions, differing from previous observations of protostellar outflows detected with JWST, suggests that MHD disk winds may not drive the observed outflow. We find that the upper limit to the width of the outflow at the protostellar location is 130 $\pm$ 10 au which is smaller than the disk diameter of 183.4 {$\pm$ 0.4 au} but much larger than the width of the [Fe II] jet.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, Syderenko et al. (JCAP, 10: 018, 2016) investigated magnetogenesis and chiral asymmetry in the early hot universe. This study explores the impact of minimally coupling a constant torsion in their cosmological model, suggesting new chiral physics. Physically, this means that if torsion is right chiral, the difference between the number of right and left chiralities does not change. Moreover, the decay of chiral asymmetry depends on torsion chirality. We solve the chiral torsionful dynamo equation for magnetic field seeds. Magnetic helical fields are considered important for chiral fermion asymmetry. Even in $(3+1)$ dimensional spacetime, torsion is highly suppressed beyond inflation (Eur Phys J C 82: 291, 2022). However, torsion of $1\,\mathrm{MeV}$ appears in the early universe. Equations for correlated magnetic field coefficients are solved in terms of torsion. Weak magnetic fields of the order of $10^{-42}$ Gauss are boosted by powerful torsionful dynamo amplification, generating a much stronger magnetic field of the order of $10^{-9}$ Gauss in the present universe. A galactic magnetic field of $10^{-6}$ Gauss in the present universe, with torsion of $10^{-15}$ Gauss, leads us to a galactic dynamo seed of $10^{-9}$ Gauss. We also discuss reheating dynamo regeneration of decaying cosmic magnetic fields during the hadronization era. The relation between the reheating contribution to e-folds and the connection between CMF and temperature squared allows us to obtain dynamo amplification in terms of N-folds of inflation. The main innovation of this work is the exploration of constant torsion in a cosmological model, revealing new chiral physics. This study offers a new perspective on the origin and evolution of magnetic fields in the early universe.
#### Sun-as-a-star analysis of simulated solar flares

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Stellar flares have an impact on habitable planets. To relate the observations of the Sun with those of stars, one needs to use a Sun-as-a-star analysis, that is, to degrade the resolution of the Sun to a single point. With the data of the Sun-as-a-star observations, a simulation of solar flares is required to provide a systemic clue for the Sun-as-a-star study. Aims: We aim to explore how the Sun-as-a-star spectrum varies with the flare magnitude and location based on a grid of solar flare models. Methods: Using 1D radiative hydrodynamics modeling and multi-thread flare assumption, we obtained the spectrum of a typical flare with an enhancement of chromospheric lines. Result: The Sun-as-a-star spectrum of the H$\alpha$ line shows enhanced and shifted components, which are highly dependent on the flare magnitude and location. The equivalent width $\Delta\mathrm{EW}$ is a good indicator of energy release. The bisector method can be used to diagnose the sign of the line-of-sight velocity in the flaring atmosphere. For both H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ lines, the Sun-as-a-star spectrum of a limb flare tends to be wider and shows a dip in the line center. In particular, we propose two quantities to diagnose the magnitude and location of the stellar flares. Besides this, caution must be taken when calculating the radiation energy, since the astrophysical flux-to-energy conversion ratio is dependent on the flare location.

 - **Abstract**
 This work attempts to provide a new interpretation for the hot corona in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). A thin parabolic magnetic reconnection layer, anchored at the innermost disk and extending along the boundary of the magnetic tower for a few tens of gravitational radii, serves as a hard-X-ray source above the disk. Within this reconnection layer, the tearing instability leads to the formation of a chain of plasmoids, which contain relativistic electrons that generate X-ray radiation through inverse-Compton (IC) scattering of soft photons emitted by the accretion disk. Based on previous theoretical works and numerical simulations, we develop a heuristic framework to parameterize the geometry and magnetization of the reconnection layer, as well as to compute both the power of the IC-scattering radiation and the height of the reconnection layer. Our model allows for a quantitative investigation of the relation between the height of the corona and the X-ray radiation luminosity, which can be directly compared against the observed relation from X-ray reverberation mapping of individual AGNs. The theoretical results are in good agreement with the observations of IRAS 13224-3809, indicating the validation of our model.

 - **Abstract**
 Formaldehyde is a key precursor in the formation routes of many complex organic molecules (COMs) in space. It is also an intermediate step in CO hydrogenation sequence that leads to methanol formation on the surface of interstellar grains in cold dense prestellar cores where pristine ices are formed. Various chemical models successfully reproduce the COMs abundances in cold cores, however, they consistently overpredict the abundance of formaldehyde by an order of magnitude. This results in an inverse H2CO:CH3OH abundance ratios obtained in the astrochemical simulations as compared to the observed values. In this work, we present a homogeneous data set of formaldehyde observational maps obtained towards seven dense cores in the L1495 filament with the IRAM 30 m telescope. Resolving the spatial distribution of the molecules is essential to test the chemical models. We carefully estimate the formaldehyde column densities and abundances to put reliable observational constraints on the chemical models of cold cores. Through numerous tests, we aim to constrain the updated chemical model MONACO to better align with the observed formaldehyde abundance and its ratio to methanol. In particular, we elaborate on the branching ratio of the CH3 + O reaction at low temperatures. The revised MONACO model reproduces abundances of both methanol and formaldehyde within an order of magnitude. However the model tends to overproduce formaldehyde and underpredict methanol. Consequently, the model systematically overestimates the H2CO:CH3OH ratio, although it remains within an order of magnitude of the values derived from observations.

 - **Abstract**
 A main source of bias in transmission spectroscopy of exoplanet atmospheres is magnetic activity of the host star in the form of stellar spots, faculae or flares. However, the fact that main-sequence stars have a chromosphere and a corona, and that these optically thin layers are dominated by line emission may alter the global interpretation of the planetary spectrum, has largely been neglected. Using a JWST NIRISS/SOSS data set of hot Jupiter HAT-P-18 b, we show that even at near-IR and IR wavelengths, the presence of these layers leads to significant changes in the transmission spectrum of the planetary atmosphere. Accounting for these stellar outer layers thus improves the atmospheric fit of HAT-P-18 b, and increases its best-fit atmospheric temperature from 536 K to 736 K, a value much closer to the predicted equilibrium temperature of 852 K. Our analysis also decreases the best-fit abundance of CO2 by almost an order of magnitude. The approach provides a new window to the properties of chromospheres/corona in stars other than our Sun.

 - **Abstract**
 The International Liquid Mirror Telescope (ILMT) is a 4-m aperture, zenith-pointing telescope with a field-of-view of 22', situated in the foothills of the Himalayas. The telescope operates in continuous survey mode, making it a useful instrument for time-domain astronomy, particularly for detecting transients, variable stars, active galactic nuclei variability, and asteroids. This paper presents the PyLMT transient detection pipeline to detect such transient/varying sources in the ILMT images. The pipeline utilises the image subtraction technique to compare a pair of images from the same field, identifying such sources in subtracted images with the help of convolutional neural networks (CNN) based real/bogus classifiers. The test accuracies determined for the real/bogus classifiers ranged from 94% to 98%. The resulting precision of the pipeline calculated over candidate alerts in the ILMT frames is 0.91. It also houses a CNN-aided transient candidate classifier that classifies the transient/variable candidates based on host morphology. The test accuracy of the candidate classifier is 98.6%. It has the provision to identify catalogued asteroids and other solar system objects using public databases. The median execution time of the pipeline is approximately 29 minutes per image of 17 minutes exposure. Relevant CNNs have been trained on data acquired with the ILMT during the cycle of October-November 2022. Subsequent tests on those images have confirmed the detection of numerous catalogued asteroids, variable stars, and other uncatalogued sources. The pipeline has been operational and has detected 12 extragalactic transients, including 2 new discoveries in the November 2023-May 2024 observation cycle.

 - **Abstract**
 The recent detections of a large number of candidate active galactic nuclei at high redshift (i.e. $z \gtrsim 4$) has increased speculation that heavy seed massive black hole formation may be a required pathway. Here we re-implement the so-called Lyman-Werner (LW) channel model of Dijkstra et al. (2014) to calculate the expected number density of massive black holes formed through this channel. We further enhance this model by extracting information relevant to the model from the $\texttt{Renaissance}$ simulation suite. $\texttt{Renaissance}$ is a high-resolution suite of simulations ideally positioned to probe the high-$z$ universe. Finally, we compare the LW-only channel against other models in the literature. We find that the LW-only channel results in a peak number density of massive black holes of approximately $\rm{10^{-4} \ cMpc^{-3}}$ at $z \sim 10$. Given the growth requirements and the duty cycle of active galactic nuclei, this means that the LW-only is likely incompatible with recent JWST measurements and can, at most, be responsible for only a small subset of high-$z$ active galactic nuclei. Other models from the literature seem therefore better positioned, at present, to explain the high frequency of massive black holes at high $z$.

 - **Abstract**
 We perform an MMT/Hectospec redshift survey of the North Ecliptic Pole Wide (NEPW) field covering 5.4 square degrees, and use it to estimate the photometric redshifts for the sources without spectroscopic redshifts. By combining 2572 newly measured redshifts from our survey with existing data from the literature, we create a large sample of 4421 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts in the NEPW field. Using this sample, we estimate photometric redshifts of 77755 sources in the band-merged catalog of the NEPW field with a random forest model. The estimated photometric redshifts are generally consistent with the spectroscopic redshifts, with a dispersion of 0.028, an outlier fraction of 7.3%, and a bias of -0.01. We find that the standard deviation of the prediction from each decision tree in the random forest model can be used to infer the fraction of catastrophic outliers and the measurement uncertainties. We test various combinations of input observables, including colors and magnitude uncertainties, and find that the details of these various combinations do not change the prediction accuracy much. As a result, we provide a catalog of 77755 sources in the NEPW field, which includes both spectroscopic and photometric redshifts up to z~2. This dataset has significant legacy value for studies in the NEPW region, especially with upcoming space missions such as JWST, Euclid, and SPHEREx.

 - **Abstract**
 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) feedback is a key physical mechanism proposed to regulate star formation, primarily in massive galaxies. In particular, cosmic rays associated with AGN jets have the potential to efficiently suppress cooling flows and quench star formation. The locus of cosmic ray production and their coupling to gas play a crucial role in the overall self-regulation process. To investigate this in detail, we conduct high-resolution, non-cosmological MHD simulations of a massive $10^{14} {\rm M_\odot}$ halo using the FIRE-2 (Feedback In Realistic Environments) stellar feedback model. We explore a variety of AGN jet feedback scenarios with cosmic rays, examining different values for the cosmic ray energy fraction in jets, cosmic ray coupling sites (in the black hole vicinity versus at the large-scale jet-driven shock front), and jet precession parameters. Our findings indicate that when cosmic rays are injected near the black hole, they efficiently inhibit black hole accretion by suppressing the density before the jet propagates out to large radii. As a result, this leads to episodic black hole accretion, with the jet not having sufficient energy flux to reach large radii and impact cooling flows. Conversely, if the cosmic rays are injected at the jet-driven shock front, not only does the jet sustain a higher overall energy flux for an extended period, but it also disperses cosmic rays out to larger radii, more effectively suppressing the cooling flow. Furthermore, the period and angle of jet precession can influence the position of shock fronts. We identify an optimal range of jet precession periods ($\sim$ tens of Myr) that generates shocks at the inner circumgalactic medium, where cooling flows are most severe. We report that this specific configuration offers the most effective scenario for cosmic rays at the shock front to suppress the cooling flow and star formation.

 - **Abstract**
 We present results from a suite of 3D high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations of supernova-driven outflows from galactic disc regions with a range of gas surface density, metallicity, and supernova scale height. We use this suite to quantify how outflow properties -- particularly the loading factors for mass, metallicity, and energy -- vary with these parameters. We find that the winds fall into three broad categories: steady and hot, multiphase and moderately bursty, and cool and highly bursty. The first of these is characterised by efficient metal and energy loading but weak mass loading, the second by moderate loading of mass, metals, and energy, and the third by negligible metal and energy loading but substantial mass loading. The most important factor in determining the kind of wind a galaxy will produce is the ratio of supernova to gas gas scale heights, with the latter set by a combination of supernova rate, metallicity-dependent cooling rate, and the gravitational potential. These often combine in counterintuitive ways -- for example increased cooling causes cold clouds to sink into the galactic midplane more rapidly, lowering the volume-filling factor of dense gas and making the environment more favourable for strong winds. Our findings suggest that the nature of galactic winds is likely highly sensitive to phenomena such as runaway stars occuring at a large height and dense gas and are poorly captured in most simulations, and that metal loading factors for type Ia supernovae may be substantially larger than those for type II, with important implications for galactic chemical evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first asteroseismic analysis of the K3\,V planet host HD~219134, based on four consecutive nights of radial velocities collected with the Keck Planet Finder. We applied Gold deconvolution to the power spectrum to disentangle modes from sidelobes in the spectral window, and extracted 25 mode frequencies with spherical degrees $0\leq\ell\leq3$. We derive the fundamental properties using five different evolutionary-modeling pipelines and report a mass of 0.763 $\pm$ 0.020 (stat) $\pm$ 0.007 (sys) M$_\odot$, a radius of 0.748 $\pm$ 0.007 (stat) $\pm$ 0.002 (sys) R$_\odot$, and an age of 10.151 $\pm$ 1.520 (stat) $\pm$ 0.810 (sys) Gyr. Compared to the interferometric radius 0.783 $\pm$ 0.005~R$_\odot$, the asteroseismic radius is 4\% smaller at the 4-$\sigma$ level -- a discrepancy not easily explained by known interferometric systematics, modeling assumptions on atmospheric boundary conditions and mixing lengths, magnetic fields, or tidal heating. HD~219134 is the first main-sequence star cooler than 5000~K with an asteroseismic age estimate and will serve as a critical calibration point for stellar spin-down relations. We show that existing calibrated prescriptions for angular momentum loss, incorporating weakened magnetic braking with asteroseismically constrained stellar parameters, accurately reproduce the observed rotation period. Additionally, we revised the masses and radii of the super-Earths in the system, which support their having Earth-like compositions. Finally, we confirm that the oscillation amplitude in radial velocity scales as $(L/M)^{1.5}$ in K dwarfs, in contrast to the $(L/M)^{0.7}$ relation observed in G dwarfs. These findings provide significant insights into the structure and angular momentum loss of K-type stars.

 The solar magnetic field, thought to be generated by the motion of plasma within the Sun, alternates on the order of 11-year cycles and is incompletely understood. Industries rely on accurate forecasts of solar activity, but can solar cycles be predicted? And how well did predictions perform for the current cycle? The answer is less-than-stellar... Of more than 100 predictions, most underestimated the amplitude (peak sunspot number) of cycle 25, some massively so. Fewer predictions were made for the timing of solar maximum, but timing predictions seem to have performed better than amplitude predictions. Reasons for inaccurate prediction are suggested, and perspectives are given on how future studies might improve upon the extant literature.

 We investigate the time delay incurred during ultra-high energy cosmic ray (UHECR) propagation over cosmological distances and its potential impact on the correlation between UHECR directions of arrival and sources such as Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), the UHECR chemical composition, and extragalactic magnetic field constraints. We propagate particles in different magnetic field configurations, spanning over an extended range of particle Larmor radii and magnetic field coherence lengths, also including attenuation losses. We find that UHECR delays could easily be comparable to (and longer than) AGN duty cycles, effectively erasing the correlation between known AGNs and UHECR anisotropies. We finally consider how strong constraints on the chemical composition of the heaviest UHECRs could enable a better characterization of extragalactic magnetic fields.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent pulsar timing array (PTA) observations have detected nanohertz gravitational waves, likely originating from massive black hole binaries (MBHBs). The detected amplitude is unexpectedly higher than inferred from the electromagnetic measurements. We present new gravitational wave background (GWB) results from the ASTRID simulation. Its large volume and on-the-fly dynamical friction for MBHs provide new insights into the MBHB population, offering a more accurate assessment of its contribution to the observed GWB. ASTRID predicts a GWB from MBHBs of $h_c=2.8\times10^{-15}$, or $\sim45\%$ of the observed amplitude at $\sim 4\,{\rm nHz}$ and $h_c=2.5\times10^{-16}$ ($5\%$) with $h_c\propto f^{-1.6}$ at $\sim 30\,{\rm nHz}$. These predictions remain below current PTA constraints but align with previous empirical models based on the observed MBH mass functions. By comparison, TNG300 with post-processed MBH dynamics yields a range between $70-90\%$ ($20\% - 30\%$) of the observed levels at low (high) frequencies. At low frequencies, ASTRID predicts that the bulk of the GWB originates from MBHB with masses $M_{\rm tot}=1-3\times 10^9\,M_\odot$ peaking at $z\approx 0.3$, consistent with TNG300. Notably, both simulations predict significant GWB contribution from minor mergers ($q<0.2$) by up to $\sim 40\%$. By tracing the full merger trees of local MBHs in ASTRID, we show that they generate GWs at $\sim 10\%-80\%$ of the maximum signal assuming no accretion and recent equal-mass mergers. Finally, we demonstrate the importance of on-the-fly MBH dynamics, the lack of which leads to $3- 5$ times excessive mass growth by merger, and a similar boost to the GWB prediction.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive analysis of the X-ray observations obtained from \xmm\, and \chandra\, for a sample of bona-fide Compact Symmetric Objects (CSOs) to investigate their X-ray emission properties. Ultimately, we obtain 32 effective X-ray observational spectra from 17 CSOs. Most spectra can be well described by an absorbed single power-law model, with the exception of 6 spectra requiring an additional component in the soft X-ray band and 2 spectra exhibiting an iron emission line component. The data analysis results unveil the diverse characteristics of X-ray emission from CSOs. The sample covers X-ray luminosity ranging within $10^{40}-10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$, intrinsic absorbing column density ($N_{\rm H}^{\rm int}$) ranging within $10^{20}-10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$, and photon spectral index ($\Gamma_{\rm X}$) ranging within 0.75--3.0. None of the CSOs in our sample have $N_{\rm H}^{\rm int}$ > $10^{23}\rm~cm^{-2}$, indicating that the X-ray emission in these CSOs is not highly obscured. The distribution of $\Gamma_{\rm X}$ for these CSOs closely resembles that observed in a sample of radio-loud quasars and low-excitation radio galaxies (RGs). In the radio--X-ray luminosity panel, these CSOs exhibit a distribution more akin to FR I RGs than FR II RGs, characterized by higher luminosities. The positive correlation between $\Gamma_{\rm X}$ and the Eddington ratio, which has been noted in radio-quiet active galactic nuclei, is not observed in these CSOs. These findings suggest that although the contribution of the disk-corona system cannot be completely ruled out, jet/lobe radiation likely plays a dominant role in the X-ray emission of these CSOs.

 - **Abstract**
 The central regions of the globular cluster Omega Centauri ($\omega$ Cen) have been extensively studied, but its outer regions and tidal structure have been less so. Gaia's astrometry uncovered substantial tidal substructure associated with $\omega$ Cen, yet the lack of chemical tagging makes these associations tenuous. In this paper, we utilise the Gaia-Synthetic CaHK-band photometry, metallicities from the Pristine survey and Gaia's astrometry to explore up to a clustercentric radius of 5 degrees from $\omega$ Cen. We identify $\omega$ Cen-like stars based on proper motion, colour-magnitude and colour-colour space, exploring the morphology, and stellar populations of the outer regions. Our probabilistic approach recovers the tidal tails of $\omega$ Cen, and we investigate the metallicity distribution of $\omega$ Cen ranging from a radius of 15 arcmin to the tidal radius, and beyond into the tidal tails. We present (1) two components between 15 arcmin and tidal radius at -1.83 and -1.45 dex which are also the dominant populations within 15 arcmin, and (2) the first evidence that the same two populations in the outer regions of the cluster are present outside the tidal radius and into the tidal tails. These populations are mixed about the stream, and are typically amongst the faintest stars in our sample; all indicating that the tidal tails are made of tidally stripped $\omega$ Cen stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The HI distribution at high Galactic latitudes is found to be filamentary and closely related to the far infrared (FIR) in caustics with coherent velocity structures. These structures trace the orientation of the magnetic field lines. Aims. Recent absorption observations with the Australian SKA Pathfinder Telescope have led to major improvements in our understanding of the physical properties of the cold neutral medium (CNM) at high Galactic latitudes. We use these results to explore how far the physical state of the CNM may be related with caustics in HI and FIR. Methods. We trace filamentary FIR and HI structures and probe the absorption data for coincidences in position and velocity. Results. 57 percent of the absorption positions are associated with known FIR/HI caustics, filamentary dusty structures with a coherent velocity field. The remaining part of the absorption sample is coincident in position and velocity with genuine HI filaments that are closely related to the FIR counterparts. Thus, within the current sensitivity limitations, all of the positions with HI absorption lines are associated with filamentary structures in FIR and/or HI. We summarize physical parameters for then CNM along filaments in the framework of filament velocities that have been determined from a Hessian analysis of FIR and HI emission data. Velocity deviations between absorption components and filament velocities are due to local turbulence and we determine for the observed CNM an average turbulent velocity dispersion of 2.48 < delta_vturb < 3.9 km/s. The CNM has a mean turbulent Mach number of Mt = 3.4 +/- 1.6 km/s. Conclusions. Most, if not all, of the CNM in the diffuse ISM at high Galactic latitudes is located in filaments, identified as caustics with the Hessian operator.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic reconnection is one of the fundamental dynamical processes in the solar corona. The method of studying reconnection in active region-scale magnetic fields generally depends on non-local methods (i.e. requiring information across the magnetic field under study) of magnetic topology, such as separatrix skeletons and quasi-separatrix layers. The theory of General Magnetic Reconnection is also non-local, in that its measure of the reconnection rate depends on determining the maxima of integrals along field lines. In this work, we complement the above approaches by introducing a local theory of magnetic reconnection, that is one in which information about reconnection at a particular location depends only on quantities at that location. The theory connects the concept of the field line slippage rate, relative to ideal motion, to the underlying local geometry of the magnetic field characterized in terms of the Lorentz force and field-aligned current density. It is argued that the dominant non-ideal term for the solar corona, discussed in relation to this new theory, is mathematically equivalent to the anomalous resistivity employed by many magnetohrdrodynamic simulations. However, the general application of the theory is adaptable to the inclusion of other non-ideal terms, which may arise from turbulence modelling or the inclusion of a generalized Ohm's law. The theory is illustrated with two examples of coronal magnetic fields related to flux ropes: an analytical model and a nonlinear force-free extrapolation. In terms of the latter, the slippage rate corresponds to the reconnection which would happen if the given (static) force-free equilibrium were the instantaneous form of the magnetic field governed by an Ohm's law with non-ideal terms.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Protostellar jets driven by massive protostars are collimated outflows producing high-speed shocks through dense interstellar medium. Fast shocks can accelerate particles up to relativistic energies via diffusive shock acceleration, producing non-thermal emission that can originate ${\gamma}$-ray photons. HH 80-81 is one of the most powerful collimated protostellar jets in our galaxy, with non-thermal emission detected in radio, X-ray, and ${\gamma}$-ray bands. Characterize the ${\gamma}$-ray emission originated by the accelerated particles of the region is crucial for demonstrating the capability of protostars to accelerate cosmic rays. Aims. Our goal is to determine the particle distribution that is producing the ${\gamma}$-ray spectrum of HH 80-81 in order to ascertain the leptonic/hadronic origin of the ${\gamma}$-ray emission. We aim at associating the high-energy emission in the region with the HH 80-81 system, characterize its spectrum, and elaborate emission models based on what we expect from the diffusive shock acceleration. Methods. We use the 15 yr database provided by the Fermi-LAT satellite to study the high-energy emission of the jet, spanning from 300 MeV to 100 GeV. In addition, we perform a source association based on positional arguments. Then, we employ the naima and Gamera softwares to analyze the possible mechanisms that are producing ${\gamma}$-rays considering the ambient conditions. We perform a radiative fitting and study the nature of the particles behind the ${\gamma}$-ray emission. Results. By analyzing all the candidates to produce the ${\gamma}$-ray emission that we detect, we conclude that HH 80-81 is the most probable candidate to explain the ${\gamma}$-ray emission in the region. The detected spectrum can be explained by both hadronic and leptonic particle components.

 - **Abstract**
 Pulsar Wind Nebulae (PWNe) dominate the galactic gamma-ray sky at very high energies, and are major contributors to the leptonic cosmic ray flux. However, whether or not pulsars also accelerate ions to comparable energies is not yet experimentally confirmed. We aim to constrain the birth period and pair-production multiplicity for a set of pulsars. In doing so, we aim to constrain the proportion of ions in the pulsar magnetosphere and hence the proportion of ions that could enter the pulsar wind. We estimate possible ranges of the value of the average pair production multiplicity for a sample of 26 pulsars in the Australia Telescope National Facility (ATNF) catalogue, which have also been observed by the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) telescopes. We then derive lower limits for the pulsar birth periods and average pair production multiplicities for a subset of these sources where the extent of the pulsar wind nebula and surrounding supernova shell have been measured in the radio. We also derive curves for the average pair production multiplicities as a function of birth period for sources recently observed by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). We show that there is a potential for hadrons entering the pulsar wind for most of the H.E.S.S. and LHAASO sources we consider, dependent upon the efficiency of luminosity conversion into particles. We also present estimates of the pulsar birth period for six of these sources, which all fall into the range of $\simeq$10-50 ms.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent studies have focused on how spinning black holes (BHs) within a binary system containing a strongly magnetized neutron star, then immersed in external magnetic fields, can acquire charge through mechanisms like the Wald process and how this charge could power pulsar-like electromagnetic radiation. Those objects called ``Black hole pulsar'' mimic the behaviour of a traditional pulsar, and they can generate electromagnetic fields, such as magnetic dipoles. Charged particles within an accretion disk around the black hole would then be influenced not only by the gravitational forces but also by electromagnetic forces, leading to different geometries and dynamics. In this context, we focus here on the interplay of the magnetic dipole and the accretion disk. We construct the equilibrium structures of non-conducting charged perfect fluids orbiting Kerr black holes under the influence of a dipole magnetic field aligned with the rotation axis of the BH. The dynamics of the accretion disk in such a system are shaped by a complex interplay between the non-uniform, non-Keplerian angular momentum distribution, the black hole's induced magnetic dipole, and the fluid's charge. We show how these factors jointly influence key properties of the disk, such as its geometry, aspect ratio, size, and rest mass density.

 - **Abstract**
 The Sun's polar magnetic field is pivotal in understanding solar dynamo processes and forecasting future solar cycles. However, direct measurements of the polar field is only available since the 1970s. The chromospheric Ca II K polar network index (PNI; the fractional area of the chromospheric network regions above a certain latitude) has recently emerged as a reliable proxy for polar magnetic fields. In this study, we derive PNI estimates from newly calibrated, rotation-corrected Ca II K observations from the Kodaikanal Solar Observatory (1904-2007) and modern data from the Rome Precision Solar Photometric Telescope (2000-2022). We use both of those Ca II K archives to identify polar network regions with an automatic adaptive threshold segmentation technique and calculate the PNI. The PNI obtained from both the archives shows a significant correlation with the measured polar field from WSO (Pearson correlation coefficient r > 0.93) and the derived polar field based on an Advective Flux Transport Model (r > 0.91). The PNI series also shows a significant correlation with faculae counts derived from Mount Wilson Observatory observations (r > 0.87) for both KoSO and Rome-PSPT data. Finally, we use the PNI series from both archives to reconstruct the polar magnetic field over a 119-year-long period, which includes last 11 solar cycles (Cycle 14-24). We also obtain a relationship between the amplitude of solar cycles (in 13-month smoothed sunspot number) and the strength of the reconstructed polar field at the preceding solar cycle minimum to validate the prediction of the ongoing solar cycle, Cycle 25.

 - **Abstract**
 We present MauveSim, the instrument simulator software for Mauve, the latest mission from Blue Skies Space dedicated to time-domain stellar astronomy. The tool is designed to generate simulated stellar spectra, enabling the assessment of various scientific objectives, as well as determining limiting magnitudes and conducting signal-to-noise (S/N) analyses. MauveSim functions as an end-to-end simulator that takes an input stellar spectrum-either observed or synthetic-and produces a simulated observation based on the instrument's performance and characteristics. The results of MauveSim have been validated against instrument performance data from extensive ground testing campaigns, ensuring that the software reflects the most up-to-date understanding of the payload performance. Accessible to all scientists involved in the mission, MauveSim serves as a crucial tool for target selection and observation planning.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new model for the TeV afterglow of GRB 221009A. The rapid increase of the TeV flux in the very early phase is reproduced by the magnetic acceleration. We consider the change in the radial structure of the circumstellar medium from homogeneous to wind-like to describe the breaks in the TeV light curve. Our results imply a highly magnetized ejecta with a significantly thick width, making the deceleration time around 400 s for observers. In our model, no early jet break is required.
#### Can the dynamo of spiral-arm galaxies be explained by anisotropic conductivity ?

 - **Abstract**
 The possibility of generating a magnetic field by dynamo effect with anisotropic electrical conductivity rather than turbulent flow has been demonstrated theoretically (Plunian & Alboussière 2020) and experimentally (Alboussière et al. 2022). If the electrical conductivity is anisotropic, the electrical currents will flow preferentially in certain directions rather than others, and a simple differential rotation will suffice to generate a magnetic field. In a galaxy with spiral arms, it is reasonable to assume that the electrical conductivity will be twice larger along the arms than in the perpendicular direction, suggesting the possibility of an anisotropic dynamo. However, a further geometrical criterion must be satisfied to obtain a dynamo (Plunian & Alboussière 2022). It is given by $\Omega' \cdot\sin p > 0$, where $p$ is the pitch angle of the spiral arms, with $p \in[-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}]$, and $\Omega'$ is the radial shear of the angular velocity. We find that the usual spiral arms galaxies, which satisfy $|\Omega'|<0$, do not satisfy this dynamo condition because they have trailing arms instead of leading arms. Even the galaxy NGC 4622, which has both trailing and leading arms, does not satisfy this dynamo condition either. This is confirmed by numerical simulations of the induction equation. Thus, for all the spiral arms galaxies known to date, the anisotropy of the spiral arms cannot explain the existence of galactic magnetic fields until further notice.
#### The effect of thermal misbalance on magnetohydrodynamic modes in coronal magnetic cylinders

 - **Abstract**
 This study investigates the dispersion of magnetohydrodynamic waves influenced by thermal misbalance in a cylindrical configuration with a finite axial magnetic field within solar coronal plasmas. Specifically, it examines how thermal misbalance, characterized by two distinct timescales directly linked to the cooling and heating functions, influences the dispersion relation. This investigation is a key approach for understanding non-adiabatic effects on the behaviour of these waves. Our findings reveal that the effect of thermal misbalance on fast sausage and kink modes, consistent with previous studies on slabs, is small but slightly more pronounced than previously thought. The impact is smaller at long-wavelength limits but increases at shorter wavelengths, leading to higher damping rates. This minor effect on fast modes occurs despite the complex interaction of thermal misbalance terms within the dispersion relation, even at low-frequency limits defined by the characteristic timescales. Additionally, a very small amplification is observed, indicating a suppressed damping state for the long-wavelength fundamental fast kink mode. In contrast, slow magnetoacoustic modes are significantly affected by thermal misbalance, with the cusp frequency shifting slightly to lower values, which is significant for smaller longitudinal wavenumbers. This thermal misbalance likely accounts for the substantial attenuation observed in the propagation of slow magnetoacoustic waves within the solar atmosphere. The long-wavelength limit leads to an analytical expression that accurately describes the frequency shifts in slow modes due to misbalance, closely aligning with both numerical and observational results.

 - **Abstract**
 Type Ia supernovae are the established `standard candle' in the construction of the Hubble diagram out to high luminosity distances. Since the Hubble constant that best fits observations of these supernovae often turns out to be high compared to fits to other data, they are currently being investigated for possible systematic effects, with many studies focusing on the calibration of the distance ladder in the local Universe. Here we present a simulation-based assessment of another type of systematic effect, related to the chance that the line of sight to a distant supernova passes close to a foreground galaxy. We consider two cases separately: First, the foreground galaxy may block the line of sight so that the supernova is not observed. Since foreground galaxies are correlated with overdensities that typically magnify the flux of background sources, this effect leads to a systematic removal of lensed supernovae from the sample, biasing the high-redshift Hubble diagram towards demagnified (fainter) supernovae. Second, if the supernova can be observed, its proximity to the foreground galaxy can lead to an incorrect host assignment, especially if the true host has a low surface brightness. Since foreground galaxies are typically found at lower redshifts, this effect introduces another systematic bias. The probability of line-of-sight alignments with foreground galaxies increases with redshift and therefore affects distant supernovae more strongly. We find that both effects are small, but the effect of host misidentification should be included in the systematic error budget at current levels of measurement precision.
#### Deep Constraints on [CII]158$\mu$m in JADES-GS-z14-0: Further Evidence for a Galaxy with Low Gas Content at z=14.2

 - **Abstract**
 We present deep ALMA observations targeting the [CII]$_{158\mu m}\,$ line in JADES-GS-z14-0, the most distant known galaxy at z=14.1793. We do not detect the [CII]$_{158\mu m}\,$ line in our deep observations, implying a luminosity of $<$6$\times10^7$ L$_{\odot}$ (3$\sigma$) for the target. Comparing this with the detected [OIII]$_{88\mu m}\,$ line, we constrain the [OIII]/[CII] ratio to be $>$3.5, significantly improving our probe of the ionization parameter $U$. The observed ratio is higher than analogues in the local universe, but consistent with galaxies at $z\approx6$-9. Through ISM modeling, we infer extreme ionizing conditions with log(U)$>-$2.0, likely requiring a young stellar population. Our modeling also indicates a relatively low gas density ($51_{-32}^{+116}$ cm$^{-3}$), significantly lower than expected from lower redshift trends. We infer a relatively high gas-phase metallicity (16$\pm$6\% solar) consistent with previous results and implying a rapid build-up of metals. Finally, using [CII]$_{158\mu m}\,$ as a molecular/cold gas mass tracer, we infer a low gas fraction ($f_\mathrm{gas} < 0.77$), consistent with previous estimates of the dynamical mass from [OIII]$_{88\mu m}\,$. Combined with the low observed gas density, lack of dust and high ionization parameter, this suggests strong feedback processes are playing an important role in the evolution of this galaxy. Our observations show that JADES-GS-z14-0 is a rapidly evolving galaxy with extreme ISM conditions, shedding light on the earliest phases of galaxy formation.

 - **Abstract**
 X-ray observing facilities, such as the Chandra X-ray Observatory and the eROSITA, have detected millions of astronomical sources associated with high-energy phenomena. The arrival of photons as a function of time follows a Poisson process and can vary by orders-of-magnitude, presenting obstacles for common tasks such as source classification, physical property derivation, and anomaly detection. Previous work has either failed to directly capture the Poisson nature of the data or only focuses on Poisson rate function reconstruction. In this work, we present Poisson Process AutoDecoder (PPAD). PPAD is a neural field decoder that maps fixed-length latent features to continuous Poisson rate functions across energy band and time via unsupervised learning. PPAD reconstructs the rate function and yields a representation at the same time. We demonstrate the efficacy of PPAD via reconstruction, regression, classification and anomaly detection experiments using the Chandra Source Catalog.

 - **Abstract**
 Nearby extremely metal-poor galaxies (XMPs) allow us to study primitive galaxy formation and evolution in greater detail than is possible at high redshift. This work, for the first time, promotes the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to efficiently search for XMPs in multi-band imaging data based on their predicted N2 index (N2\,$\equiv\log$\{\rNii/\Ha\}). We developed a sequential characterisation pipeline, composed of three CNN procedures: (i) a classifier for metal-poor galaxies, (ii) a classifier for XMPs, and (iii) an N2 predictor. The pipeline is applied to over 7.7 million SDSS DR17 imaging data without SDSS spectroscopy. The predicted N2 values are used to select promising candidates for observations. This approach was validated by new observations of 45 candidates with redshifts less than 0.065 using the 2.54~m Isaac Newton Telescope (INT) and the 4.1~m Southern Astrophysical Research (SOAR) Telescope between 2023 and 2024. All 45 candidates are confirmed to be metal-poor, including 28 new discoveries. There are 18/45 galaxies lacking detectable \rNii\ lines ($S/N<2$); for these, we report $2\sigma$ upper limits on their oxygen abundance. Our XMPs have estimated oxygen abundances of $7.1\leq$\OH$\leq8.7$ ($2\sigma$ upper limit), based on the N2 index, and 21 of them with estimated metallicity $<0.1~Z_{\odot}$. Additionally, we identified 4 potential candidates of low-metallicity AGNs at $\lesssim0.1Z_{\odot}$. Finally, we found that our observed samples are mostly brighter in the $g-$band compared to other filters, similar to blueberry (BB) galaxies, resembling green pea galaxies and high-redshift Ly$\alpha$ emitters.
