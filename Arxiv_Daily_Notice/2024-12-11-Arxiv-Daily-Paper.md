 - **Abstract**
 Using high-precision astrometric data from Gaia DR3 and updated systemic velocities from the literature, kinematical properties of cataclysmic variables (CVs) were investigated. By constraining the data according to the total space velocity error and Galactic population class, a reliable sample of data was obtained. Non-magnetic CVs located in the thin disk have been found to have a total space velocity dispersion of $\sigma_{\nu} = 46.33\pm4.23$ km s$^{-1}$, indicating that the thin disk CVs with a mean kinematical age of $\tau = 3.95\pm0.75$ Gyr are much younger than the local thin disk of the Galaxy with $\tau\sim$6-9 Gyr. Total space velocity dispersions of non-magnetic CVs belonging to the thin disk component of the Galaxy were found to be $\sigma_{\nu}=47.67\pm3.94$ and $\sigma_{\nu}=44.43\pm4.33$ km s$^{-1}$ for the systems below and above the orbital period gap, respectively, corresponding to kinematical ages of $\tau=4.19\pm0.71$ and $\tau=3.61\pm0.74$ Gyr. $\gamma$ velocity dispersions of the thin disk CVs below and above the gap were obtained $\sigma_{\gamma} = 27.52\pm2.28$ and $\sigma_{\gamma} = 25.65\pm2.44$ km s$^{-1}$, respectively. This study also shows that the orbital period is decreasing with increasing age, as expected from the standard theory. The age-orbital period relation for non-magnetic thin disk CVs was obtained as $dP/dt=-2.09\pm0.22\times10^{-5}$ sec yr$^{-1}$. However, a significant difference could not be found between the $\gamma$ velocity dispersions of the systems below and above the gap, which were calculated to be $\sigma_{\gamma} = 27.52\pm2.28$ and $\sigma_{\gamma} = 25.65\pm2.44$ km s$^{-1}$, respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of supermassive black holes at high redshift challenge our understanding of the evolution of the first generation of black holes (BHs) in proto-galactic environments. One possibility is that they grow much more rapidly than current estimates of feedback and accretion efficiency permit. Following our previous analysis of super-Eddington accretion onto stellar-mass black holes in mini-haloes under no-feedback conditions, we now investigate whether this can be sustained when thermal feedback is included. We use four sets of cosmological simulations at sub-pc resolution with initial black hole masses varying from $1 \times 10^3 - 6 \times 10^4 M_\odot$, exploring a range of feedback efficiencies. We also vary the feedback injection radius to probe the threshold of numerical overcooling. We find that super-Eddington growth sustained on the order of $\sim$$100 \, \rm kyr$ is possible with very weak thermal feedback efficiency in all environments and moderate efficiency for the $6 \times 10^4 M_\odot$ BH. Trans-Eddington growth is possible for a $3 \times 10^3 - 6 \times 10^6 M_\odot$ BH at moderate feedback efficiencies. We discuss the effectiveness of thermal feedback in heating the gas, suppressing accretion, and driving outflows at these parameter configurations. Our results suggest that super-Eddington growth may be possible in the presence of thermal feedback for black holes formed from the first stars.

 - **Abstract**
 We detect Ly$\alpha$ emission from a ~5 Mpc-long (comoving) portion of the cosmic web hosting an overdensity ($\delta \approx 25$) of 19 Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) at $z\approx 4$ within the MUSE Ultra Deep Field (MUDF), reaching an average surface brightness (SB) of $5\times 10^{-20}~\rm{erg~s^{-1}~ cm^{-2}~arcsec^{-2}}$. This large-scale structure has an average SB similar to the filament across the two MUDF quasars at $z\approx 3.22$. However, deep multiwavelength data do not show a clear presence of active galactic nuclei, suggesting that the emission is mainly regulated by the underlying gas density. We find $\approx 0.2$ dex higher star formation compared to control samples and a remarkable predominance (5/7) of blue-peaked emission lines in the spectra of the embedded LAEs, indicative of favorable conditions for gas accretion. Lastly, we quantify the contribution of intragalactic gas to the Ly$\alpha$ SB profile at large distances from LAEs. By studying samples of filaments detected in emission within diverse environments, we are finally gaining new insight into the physics of gas accretion within the cosmic web.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the interaction between a shock-driven hot wind and a cold multi-cloud layer, for conditions commonly found in interstellar and circumgalactic gas. We present a method for identifying distinct clouds using a Friends-of-Friends algorithm. This approach unveils novel detailed information about individual clouds and their collective behaviour. By tracing the evolution of individual clouds, our method provides comprehensive descriptions of cloud morphology, including measures of the elongation and fractal dimension. Combining the kinematics and morphology of clouds, we refine previous models for drag and entrainment processes. Our by-cloud analysis allows to discern the dominant entrainment processes at different times. We find that after the initial shock passage, momentum transfer due to condensation becomes increasingly important, compared to ram pressure, which dominates at early times. We also find that internal motions within clouds act as an effective dynamic pressure that exceeds the thermal pressure by an order of magnitude. Our analysis shows how the highly efficient cooling of the warm mixed gas at temperatures $\sim 10^{5}$ K is effectively balanced by the kinetic energy injected by the hot wind into the warm and cold phases via shocks and shear motions. Compression-driven condensation and turbulence dissipation maintain a multi-phase outflow and can help explain the presence of dense gas in galaxy-scale winds. Finally, we show that applying our Friends-of-Friends analysis to $\rm{H}_\rm{I}$-emitting gas and correcting for beam size and telescope sensitivity can explain two populations of $\rm{H}_\rm{I}$ clouds within the Milky-Way nuclear wind as structures pertaining to the same outflow.

 - **Abstract**
 While the subclass of interacting supernovae with narrow hydrogen emission lines (SNe IIn) consists of some of the longest-lasting and brightest SNe ever discovered, their progenitors are still not well understood. Investigating SNe IIn as they emit across the electromagnetic spectrum is the most robust way to understand the progenitor evolution before the explosion. This work presents X-Ray, optical, infrared, and radio observations of the strongly interacting Type IIn SN 2020ywx covering a period $>1200$ days after discovery. Through multiwavelength modeling, we find that the progenitor of 2020ywx was losing mass at $\sim10^{-2}$--$10^{-3} \mathrm{\,M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}}$ for at least 100 yr pre-explosion using the circumstellar medium (CSM) speed of $120$ km/s measured from our optical and NIR spectra. Despite the similar magnitude of mass-loss measured in different wavelength ranges, we find discrepancies between the X-ray and optical/radio-derived mass-loss evolution, which suggest asymmetries in the CSM. Furthermore, we find evidence for dust formation due to the combination of a growing blueshift in optical emission lines and near-infrared continuum emission which we fit with blackbodies at $\sim$ 1000 K. Based on the observed elevated mass loss over more than 100 years and the configuration of the CSM inferred from the multiwavelength observations, we invoke binary interaction as the most plausible mechanism to explain the overall mass-loss evolution. SN 2020ywx is thus a case that may support the growing observational consensus that SNe IIn mass loss is explained by binary interaction.

 - **Abstract**
 The B2 star $\epsilon$ CMa, at parallax distance $d = 124\pm2$~pc, dominates the H I photoionization of the local interstellar cloud (LIC). At its closer parallax distance compared to previous estimates, $\epsilon$ CMa has a 0.9 mag fainter absolute magnitude $M_V =-3.97\pm0.04$. We combine measurements of distance with the integrated flux $f = (41.5\pm3.3) \times 10^{-6}~{\rm erg~cm}^{-2}~{\rm s}^{-1}$ and angular diameter $\theta_d = 0.80\pm0.05$~mas to produce a consistent set of stellar parameters: radius $R = 10.7\pm0.7~R_{\odot}$, mass $M = 13.1\pm2.3~M_{\odot}$, gravity $\log g = 3.50\pm0.05$, effective temperature $T_{\rm eff} \approx 21,000$~K, and luminosity $L \approx 20,000~L_{\odot}$. These parameters place Epsilon CMa outside the $\beta$ Cephei instability strip, consistent with its observed lack of pulsations. The observed EUV spectrum yields a hydrogen photoionization rate $\Gamma_{\rm HI} \approx 10^{-15}$ s$^{-1}$ (at Earth). The total flux decrement factor at the Lyman limit ($\Delta_{\rm LL} = 5000\pm500$) is a combination of attenuation in the stellar atmosphere ($\Delta_{\rm star} = 110\pm10$) and interstellar medium ($\Delta_{\rm ISM} = 45\pm5$) with optical depth $\tau_{\rm LL} = 3.8\pm0.1$. After correcting for interstellar HI column density $N_{\rm HI} = (6\pm1)\times10^{17}~{\rm cm}^{-2}$, we find a stellar LyC photon flux $\Phi_{\rm LyC} \approx 3000~{\rm cm}^{-2}~{\rm s}^{-1}$ and ionizing luminosity $Q_{\rm LyC} = 10^{45.7\pm0.3}$ photons s$^{-1}$. The photoionization rate $\Gamma_{\rm H} \approx$ (1-2)$\times 10^{-14}~{\rm s}^{-1}$ at the cloud surface produces an ionization fraction (30-40\%) for total hydrogen density $n_{\rm H} = 0.2$ cm$^{-3}$. With its $27.3\pm0.4$ km/s heliocentric radial velocity and small proper motion, $\epsilon$ CMa passed within $9.3\pm0.5$ pc of the Sun 4.4 Myr ago, with a 180 times higher photoionization rate.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: The study of quasar outflows is essential in understanding the connection between active galactic nuclei (AGN) and their host galaxies. We analyze the VLT/UVES spectrum of quasar SDSS J0932+0840 and identify several narrow and broad outflow components in absorption, with multiple ionization species including Fe II, which puts it among a rare class of outflows known as FeLoBALs. Aims: We study one of the outflow components to determine its physical characteristics by determining the total hydrogen column density, ionization parameter and the hydrogen number density. Through these parameters, we aim to obtain the distance of the outflow from the central source, its mass outflow rate and kinetic luminosity, and to constrain the contribution of the outflow to AGN feedback. Methods: We obtain the ionic column densities from the absorption troughs in the spectrum, and use photoionization modeling to extract the physical parameters of the outflow, including the total hydrogen column density and ionization parameter. The relative population of the observed excited states of Fe II is used to model the hydrogen number density of the outflow. Results: We use the Fe II excited states to model the electron number density ($n_e$) and hydrogen number density ($n_H$) independently and obtain $n_e$ $\simeq$ $10^{3.4}$ cm$^{-3}$ and $n_H$ $\simeq$ $10^{4.8}$ cm$^{-3}$. Our analysis of the physical structure of the cloud shows that these two results are consistent with each other. This places the outflow system at a distance of $0.7_{-0.4}^{+0.9}$ kpc from the central source, with mass flow rate ($\dot{M}$) of $43^{+65}_{-26}$ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ and kinetic luminosity ($\dot{E_k}$) of $0.7^{+1.1}_{-0.4}$ $\times$ $10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Bending waves are perhaps the most fundamental and analytically tractable phenomena in warped disc dynamics. In this work we conduct 3D grid-based, numerical experiments of bending waves in laminar, viscous hydrodynamic and turbulent, weakly magnetised discs, capturing their behaviour in unprecedented detail. We clearly elucidate the theory from first principles, wherein the general Fourier-Hermite formalism can be simplified to a reduced framework which extends previous results towards locally isothermal discs. We obtain remarkable agreement with our laminar simulations wherein the tilt evolution is well described by the reduced theory, whilst higher order vertical modes should be retained for capturing the detailed disc twisting and internal velocity profiles. We then relax this laminar assumption and instead launch bending waves atop a magnetorotationally turbulent disc. Although the turbulence can be quantified with an effective $\alpha$ parameter, the bending waves behave distinctly from a classical viscous evolution and are readily disrupted when the turbulent velocity is comparable to the induced warping flows. This may have implications for the inclination damping rates induced by planet-disc interactions, the capture rate of black holes in AGN discs or the warped shapes assumed by discs in misaligned systems.

 - **Abstract**
 The presence, distribution and kinematics of atomic neutral hydrogen in the central regions of galaxies can be traced by the HI 21~cm line observed in absorption. Depending only on the strength of the radio continuum, the associated absorption can trace the gas down to pc scale, which is ideal for exploring the HI in the nuclear regions of radio AGN. This paper gives a brief overview of the main recent findings with particular focus on the AGN-driven HI outflows. Absorption has made possible the discovery of fast and massive HI outflows and their clumpy structure on pc scales. The similarities with the predictions of numerical simulations confirm the impact of young radio jets in the feedback cycle and galaxy evolution. The field of HI absorption is rapidly expanding thanks to new ``blind" surveys and the increased spectral capabilities of the radio telescopes. This opens many possibilities for future discoveries and complements the studies of HI emission.

 - **Abstract**
 The theory of jet emitting disks (JEDs) provides a mathematical framework for a self-consistent treatment of steady-state accretion and ejection. A large-scale vertical magnetic field threads the accretion disk where magnetic turbulence occurs in a strongly magnetized plasma. A fraction of mass leaves the disk and feeds the two laminar super-Alfénic jets. In previous treatments of JEDs, the disk turbulence has been considered to provide only anomalous transport coefficients, namely magnetic diffusivities and viscosity. However, 3D numerical experiments show that turbulent magnetic pressure also sets in. We included this additional pressure term using a prescription that is consistent with the latest 3D global (and local) simulations. We then solved the complete system of self-similar magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations, accounting for all dynamical terms. The disk becomes puffier and less electrically conductive, causing radial and toroidal electric currents to flow at the disk surface. Field lines within the disk become straighter, with their bending and shearing occurring mainly at the surface. Accretion remains supersonic, but becomes faster at the disk surface. Large values of both turbulent pressure and magnetic diffusivities allow powerful jets to be driven, and their combined effects have a constructive influence. Nevertheless, cold outflows do not seem to be able to reproduce mass-loss rates as large as those observed in numerical simulations. Our results are a major upgrade of the JED theory, allowing a direct comparison with full 3D global numerical simulations. We argue that JEDs provide a state-of-the-art mathematical description of the disk configurations observed in numerical simulations, commonly referred to as magnetically arrested disks (MADs). However, further efforts from both theoretical and numerical perspectives are needed to firmly establish this point.

 - **Abstract**
 We present spatially resolved measurements of SO$_2$ and NaCl winds on Io at several unique points in its orbit: before and after eclipse, and at maximum eastern and western elongation. The derived wind fields represent a unique case of meteorology in a rarified, volcanic atmosphere. Through the use of Doppler shift measurements in emission spectra obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) between $\sim346$-430GHz ($\sim0.70$-0.87 mm), line-of-sight winds up to $\sim-100$ m s$^{-1}$ in the approaching direction and >250 m s$^{-1}$ in the receding direction were derived for SO$_2$ at altitudes of $\sim10$-50 km, while NaCl winds consistently reached $\sim$|150-200| m s$^{-1}$ in localized regions up to $\sim30$ km above the surface. The wind distributions measured at maximum east and west Jovian elongations, and on the subJovian hemisphere pre- and post-eclipse, were found to be significantly different and complex, corroborating the results of simulations that include surface temperature and frost distribution, volcanic activity, and interactions with the Jovian magnetosphere. Further, the wind speeds of SO$_2$ and NaCl are often inconsistent in direction and magnitude, indicating that the processes that drive the winds for the two molecular species are different and potentially uncoupled; while the SO$_2$ wind field can be explained through a combination of sublimation-driven winds, plasma torus interactions, and plume activity, the NaCl winds appear to be primarily driven by the plasma torus.
#### Not just PAH$_{3.3}$: why galaxies turn red in the Near-Infrared

 - **Abstract**
 We measure the spectral properties of a sample of 20 galaxies at z~0.35 selected for having surprisingly red JWST/NIRCAM F200W-F444W colors. 19 galaxies were observed with JWST/NIRSpec in the PRISM configuration, while one galaxy was observed with the high resolution gratings. 17/20 galaxies in our sample exhibit strong 3.3 $\mu m$ polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH$_{3.3}$) emission (equivalent width EW(PAH$_{3.3}$)$>0.03\mu m$). In these galaxies, the strength of the color excess does not depend on environment and it correlates with EW(PAH$_{3.3}$). Nonetheless, the presence of the PAH$_{3.3}$ alone can not fully explain the color excess, as an equivalent width of ~0.1$\mu m$ is able to increase the color of galaxies by only 0.13 mag. A contribution from a hot dust component is required to explain the excess. Both the EW(PAH$_{3.3}$) and flux correlate with the H$\alpha$ equivalent width and flux, suggesting that they are produced by the same mechanism. 5/20 galaxies showing PAH would be classified as passive based on broad band rest frame colors ((B-V) and/or UVJ diagrams) and are hence "faux-passive". Of these, 3 galaxies have a significantly lower EW(PAH$_{3.3}$) given their color and also have low EW(H$\alpha$) and we tentatively conclude this behaviour is due to the presence of an AGN. The three galaxies with no PAH$_{3.3}$ in emission have passive spectra, as do the 8 galaxies in our sample with normal F200W-F444W colors. We therefore conclude that the PAH$_{3.3}$ feature is linked to dust-enshrouded star formation. The dust corrected SFR from PAH$_{3.3}$ is a factor of 3.5 higher than the SFR obtained from H$\alpha$, suggesting that these galaxies are characterized by significant amounts of dust.

 - **Abstract**
 Over the past decades, there has been significant progress in our understanding of accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) that drive active galactic nuclei (AGNs), both from observational and theoretical perspectives. As an iconic target for this area of study, the nearby giant elliptical galaxy M87 has received special attention thanks to its proximity, large mass of the central black hole and bright emission across the entire electromagnetic spectrum from radio to very-high-energy gamma rays. In particular, recent global millimeter-very-long-baseline-interferometer observations towards this nucleus have provided the first-ever opportunity to image the event-horizon-scale structure of an AGN, opening a new era of black hole astrophysics. On large scales, M87 exhibits a spectacular jet propagating far beyond the host galaxy, maintaining its narrowly collimated shape over seven orders of magnitude in distance. Elucidating the generation and propagation, as well as the internal structure, of powerful relativistic jets remains a longstanding challenge in radio-loud AGNs. M87 offers a privileged opportunity to examine such a jet with unprecedented detail. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the observational knowledge accumulated about the M87 black hole across various wavelengths. We cover both accretion and ejection processes at spatial scales ranging from outside the Bondi radius down to the event horizon. By compiling these observations and relevant theoretical studies, we aim to highlight our current understanding of accretion and jet physics for this specific object.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the analysis of a comprehensive sample of 352 early-type galaxies using public data, to investigate the correlations between CO luminosities and mid-infrared luminosities observed by \textit{Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer} (\textit{WISE}). We find strong correlations between both CO (1-0) and CO (2-1) luminosities and 12 \micron\ luminosity, boasting a correlation coefficient greater than 0.9 and an intrinsic scatter smaller than 0.1 dex. The consistent slopes observed for the relationships of CO (1-0) and CO (2-1) suggest that the line ratio R21 lacks correlation with mid-infrared emission in early-type galaxies, which is significantly different from star-forming galaxies. Moreover, the slopes of $L_{\rm CO (1-0)}$--$L_{\mbox{12\micron}}$ and $L_{\rm CO (2-1)}$--$L_{\mbox{12\micron}}$ relations in early-type galaxies are steeper than those observed in star-forming galaxies. Given the absence of correlation with color, morphology or sSFR, the correlation between deviations and the molecular gas mass surface density could be eliminated by correcting the possible 12 \micron\ emission from old stars or adopting a systematically different $\alpha_{\rm CO}$. The latter, on average, is equivalent to adding an constant CO brightness density, specifically ${2.8{_{-0.6}}\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!^{+0.8}}~[\mathrm{K~km~s^{-1}}]$ and ${4.4{_{-1.4}}\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!^{+2.2}}~[\mathrm{K~km~s^{-1}}]$ for CO (1-0) and (2-1) respectively. These explorations will serve as useful tools for estimating the molecular gas content in gas-poor galaxies and understanding associated quenching processes.
#### Early Solar System Turbulence Constrained by High Oxidation States of the Oldest Non-Carbonaceous Planetesimals

 - **Abstract**
 Early Solar System (SS) planetesimals constitute the parent bodies of most meteorites investigated today. Nucleosynthetic isotope anomalies of bulk meteorites have revealed a dichotomy between non-carbonaceous (NC) and carbonaceous (CC) groups. Planetesimals sampling NC and CC isotopic signatures are conventionally thought to originate from the "dry" inner disk, and volatile-rich outer disk, respectively, with their segregation enforced by a pressure bump close to the water-ice sublimation line, possibly tied to Jupiter's formation. This framework is challenged by emerging evidence that the oldest NC planetesimals (i.e., the iron meteorites parent bodies; IMPBs) were characterized by far higher oxidation states than previously imagined, suggesting abundant ($\gtrsim$ few wt.%) liquid water in their interiors prior to core differentiation. In this paper, we employ a model for a degassing icy planetesimal (heated by $^{26}$Al decay) to map the conditions for liquid water production therein. Our work culminates in threshold characteristic sizes for pebbles composing the said planetesimal, under which water-ice melting occurs. Adopting a model for a disk evolving under both turbulence and magnetohydrodynamic disk winds, and assuming pebble growth is fragmentation-limited, we self-consistently translate the threshold pebble size to lower limits on early SS turbulence. We find that if NC IMPBs were "wet," their constituent pebbles must have been smaller than a few centimeters, corresponding to typical values of the Shakura-Sunyaev $\alpha_{\nu}$ turbulence parameter in excess of $10^{-3}$. These findings argue against a quiescent SS disk (for <10 AU), are concordant with astronomical constraints on protoplanetary disk turbulence, and suggest pebble accretion played a secondary role in building our rocky planets.

 In the solar corona, magnetically sheared structures are unstable to both tearing and thermal instabilities in a coupled fashion. However, how the choice of linear perturbation modes influences the time-scale to achieve the thermal runaway in a coupled tearing-thermal coronal current sheet is not well understood to date. Here, we model a force-free Harris current sheet under solar coronal conditions to investigate this coupling in the linear and non-linear regimes. In the linear regime, we adopt the magnetohydrodynamic spectroscopy code Legolas to compare the current sheet under thermal and thermoresistive conditions, after which we initialise non-linear simulations (with MPI-AMRVAC) with the unstable, linear tearing and thermal perturbations obtained with Legolas. It is shown that part of the unstable thermal quasi-continuum adopts tearing properties in the linear stage, but that it is not until the non-linear stage is reached that a true thermal 'runaway' effect leads to condensations inside tearing-induced flux ropes. Hence, the linear stage is governed by the dominant tearing instability whilst condensations form due to tearing-thermal coupling in the non-linear stage. Our results imply that perturbing an equilibrium current sheet with the fastest growing linear mode skips the mode mixing phase in which the dominant instability traditionally emerges, and significantly reduces the time-scale to enter into the non-linear stage and thermal runaway process from its equilibrium configuration.

 - **Abstract**
 We present near- and mid-infrared (IR) broadband imaging observations of the edge-on protoplanetary disk around HH 30 with the James Webb Space Telescope/Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) and the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI). We combine these observations with archival optical/near-IR scattered light images obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and a millimeter-wavelength dust continuum image obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) with the highest spatial resolution ever obtained for this target. Our multiwavelength images clearly reveal the vertical and radial segregation of micron-sized and sub-mm-sized grains in the disk. In the near- and mid-IR, the images capture not only bi-reflection nebulae separated by a dark lane but also diverse dynamical processes occurring in the HH 30 disk, such as spiral- and tail-like structures, a conical outflow, and a collimated jet. In contrast, the ALMA image reveals a flat dust disk in the disk midplane. By performing radiative transfer simulations, we show that grains of about 3 $\mu$m in radius or larger are fully vertically mixed to explain the observed mid-IR scattered light flux and its morphology, whereas millimeter-sized grains are settled into a layer with a scale height of $\gtrsim1$ au at $100$ au from the central star. We also find a tension in the disk inclination angle inferred from optical/near-IR and mm observations with the latter being closer to an exactly edge-on. Finally, we report the first detection of the proper motion of an emission knot associated with the mid-IR collimated jet detected by combining two epochs of our MIRI 12.8-$\mu$m observations.

 Magnetic fields remain one of the least understood aspects of exoplanetary systems. A deeper understanding of planetary dynamos and the evolution of surface magnetic properties throughout a planet's lifetime is a key scientific purpose, with implications for planetary evolution, habitability, and atmospheric dynamics. This study models the evolution of magnetic fields generated by dynamo action in cold giant gaseous planets. We solve the resistive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations under anelastic approximation with a 3D pseudo-spectral spherical shell MHD code. We employ 1D thermodynamical hydrostatic profiles taken from gas giant evolutionary models as the background states of our MHD models. Numerical integration leads to saturated dynamo solutions. Such calculations are performed with radial profiles corresponding to different planetary ages so that we can interpret them as different snapshots of the magnetoconvection evolution during the long-term planetary evolution. We characterize magnetic fields across different evolutionary stages of a cold gaseous planet in terms of topology and strength. We find the occurrence of a transition from multipolar to dipolar-dominated dynamo regime throughout the life of a Jovian planet. During the planetary evolution and the cooling down phase, we observe a decrease in the average magnetic field strength near the dynamo surface as $\sim t^{-0.2}-t^{-0.3}$, a trend compatible with previously proposed scaling laws. We also find that some dimensionless parameters evolve differently for the multipolar to dipolar branch, possibly reflecting a force balance change. This approach can be extended to study hot gaseous planets, offering a versatile tool for interpreting the magnetic properties of giant planets.

 - **Abstract**
 The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has discovered an overabundance of UV-bright ($M_{\rm UV} \lesssim -20$), massive galaxies at $z \gtrsim 10$ in comparison to pre-JWST theoretical predictions. Among the proposed interpretations, such excess has been explained by negligible dust attenuation conditions following radiation-driven outflows developing when a galaxy goes through a super-Eddington phase. Dust opacity decreases the classical Eddington luminosity by a (boost) factor $A$, thus favoring the driving of outflows by stellar radiation in compact, initially dusty galaxies. Here, we compute $A$ as a function of the galaxy stellar mass, gas fraction, galaxy size, and metallicity (a total of 8 parameters). We find that the main dependence is on metallicity and, for the fiducial model, $A \sim 1800(Z/Z_\odot)/(1+N_{\rm H}/10^{23.5}\, {\rm cm^2})$. We apply such results to 20 spectroscopically confirmed galaxies at $z \gtrsim 10$ and evaluate their modified Eddington ratio. We predict that three galaxies are in the outflow phase. Their outflows have relatively low velocities ($60 -100 \,{\rm km\ s^{-1}}$), implying that they are unlikely to escape from the system. For the remaining 17 galaxies that are not currently in the outflow phase, we calculate the past evolution of the modified Eddington ratio from their star formation history. We find that 15 of them experienced an outflow phase prior to observation during which they effectively displaced their dust to larger radii. Thus, radiation-driven outflows appear to be a common phenomenon among early galaxies, strongly affecting their visibility.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a spectral and timing analysis of NICER observations of the black hole X-ray binary 4U 1630-47 from 2018 to 2024. We find relativistic reflection features in the hard and soft intermediate states, and disk wind absorption features in the soft intermediate state and soft state. We fit the reflection features with RELXILLCP and find a stable and untruncated disk in the intermediate states; we fit the wind features with ZXIPCF and find a stable, highly ionized wind with high column density across different outbursts. Specifically, the heartbeat state is seen in two observations in 2021 and 2023 respectively. Through the phase-resolved spectral fitting, we find the flux to be correlated with the disk parameters while no strong correlation with the coronal parameters is observed, consistent with the scenario given by the inner disk radiation instability. A significant hard lag on the time scale of a second and high coherence is observed near the characteristic frequency of the heartbeat, which can be explained by the viscous propagation of mass accretion fluctuations in the disk. The positive relationship between the heartbeat fractional rms and energy can possibly be explained by a disk-originated oscillation which is then magnified by the corona scattering.

 - **Abstract**
 There is increasing evidence for the presence and variability of circumstellar dust and gas around white dwarfs that are polluted with exoplanetary material, although the origin of this dust and gas remains debated. This paper presents the first near-simultaneous observations of both circumstellar dust (via broadband emission) and gas (via emission lines) around a polluted white dwarf. From the optical spectra the gaseous emission lines, notably the calcium infrared triplet and magnesium lines, show significant increases and decreases in their strength over timescales of weeks, while the oxygen and iron lines remain relatively stable. Near-infrared JHKs photometry reveals dust emission changes of up to 0.2 magnitudes in the Ks band over similar timescales, marking the shortest variability timescales observed to date. The two epochs with the strongest emission were correlated between the dust (Ks band brightening) and gas (strengthened calcium and magnesium lines), showing for the first time that the dust and gas must be produced near-simultaneously with a common origin, likely in collisions.

 - **Abstract**
 Radial velocity (RV) jitter represents an intrinsic limitation on the precision of Doppler searches for exoplanets that can originate from both instrumental and astrophysical sources. We aim to determine the RV jitter floor in M dwarfs and investigate the stellar properties that lead to RV jitter induced by stellar activity. We determined the RV jitter in 239 M dwarfs from the CARMENES survey that are predominantly of mid to late spectral type and solar metallicity. We also investigated the correlation between stellar rotation and magnetic fields with RV jitter. The median jitter in the CARMENES sample is 3.1 m/s, and it is 2.3 m/s for stars with an upper limit of 2 km/s on their projected rotation velocities. We provide a relation between the stellar equatorial rotation velocity and RV jitter in M dwarfs based on a subsample of 129 well-characterized CARMENES stars. RV jitter induced by stellar rotation dominates for stars with equatorial rotation velocities greater than 1 km/s. A jitter floor of 2 m/s dominates in stars with equatorial rotation velocities below 1 km/s. This jitter floor likely contains contributions from stellar jitter, instrumental jitter, and undetected companions. We study the impact of the average magnetic field and the distributions of magnetic filling factors on the RV jitter. We find a series of stars with excess RV jitter and distinctive distributions of magnetic filling factors. These stars are characterized by a dominant magnetic field component between 2-4 kG. An RV jitter floor can be distinguished from RV jitter induced by activity and rotation based on the stellar equatorial rotation velocity. RV jitter induced by activity and rotation primarily depends on the equatorial rotation velocity. This RV jitter is also related to the distribution of magnetic filling factors, and this emphasizes the role of the magnetic field in the generation of RV jitter.

 - **Abstract**
 We present multi-frequency and high-resolution studies of a sample of 24 radio transients sources discovered by comparing the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) and Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) surveys. All of them are characterized by a significant increase in radio flux density over the last two this http URL convex spectra, small sizes and high brightness temperatures are typical for young gigahertz-peaked spectrum (GPS) radio sources and indicative of an AGN buried in the host galaxy. On the other hand, they are much weaker than the archetypical GPS objects and their parsec-scale radio structures, although indicating the presence of young radio jets, are similar to radio-quiet AGNs like Seyfert and low-ionization nuclear emission-line region (LINER) galaxies. Based on the distribution of these objects in power$-$size ($P - D$) and peak frequency$-$size ($\nu_p - D$) diagrams, we suggest that after stabilizing their radio activity, some of the GHz-peaked radio transients (galaxies and quasars) will develop into radio-intermediate and radio-quiet (RI/RQ) quasars and low-frequency peaked-spectrum (PS) objects. We discuss several possible origins for the transient radio emission in our sources and conclude that changes in the accretion rate combined with low-power radio ejecta are the most probable cause. This is the scenario we also propose for one of our sources, 101841$-$13, which was independently identified as a candidate tidal disruption event (TDE) based on its infrared variability. However, we cannot exclude that 101841$-$13 or other sources in our sample are TDEs.

 - **Abstract**
 Global stability of differentially rotating plasma is investigated using a generalized effective potential. We first, for a current-free system, obtain a general form of an effective potential in terms of the free energies of global curvature and gradients of rotation for non-axisymmetric disturbances. We then examine the stability of differentially rotating disks for several rotation profiles and present the associated effective potential for the onset of these instabilities in the MHD regime. In particular, results for global axisymmetric magnetorotational instability (MRI) as well as local and global non-axisymmetric modes are presented. The latter constitute two distinct non-axisymmetric modes, a high frequency local MRI and a global low-frequency non-axisymmetric mode (the magneto-curvature mode, introduced in Ebrahimi&Pharr, ApJ 2022), confined either between two Alfvénic resonances or an Alfvénic resonance and a boundary.
