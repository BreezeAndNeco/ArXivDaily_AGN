 - **Abstract**
 We present SOFIA/HAWC+ continuum polarisation data on the magnetic fields threading 17 pc-scale massive molecular clumps at the western end of the $\eta$ Car GMC (Region 9 of CHaMP, representing all stages of star formation from pre-stellar to dispersing via feedback), revealing important details about the field morphology and role in the gas structures of this clump sample. We performed Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi and Histogram of Relative Orientation analyses tracing column densities 25.0 $<$ log($N$/m$^{-2}$) $<$ 27.2. With HRO, magnetic fields change from mostly parallel to column density structures to mostly perpendicular at a threshold $N_{\rm crit}$ = (3.7$\pm$0.6)$\times$10$^{26}$ m$^{-2}$, indicating that gravitational forces exceed magnetic forces above this value. The same analysis in 10 individual clumps gives similar results, with the same clear trend in field alignments and a threshold $N_{\rm crit}$ = (1.9$^{+1.5}_{-0.8}$)$\times$10$^{26}$ m$^{-2}$. In the other 7 clumps, the alignment trend with $N$ is much flatter or even reversed, inconsistent with the usual HRO pattern. Instead, these clumps' fields reflect external environmental forces, such as from the nearby HII region NGC 3324. DCF analysis reveals field strengths somewhat higher than typical of nearby clouds, with the $Bn$ data lying mostly above the Crutcher (2012) relation. The mass:flux ratio $\lambda$ across all clumps has a gaussian distribution, with log$\lambda_{\rm DCF}$ = -0.75$\pm$0.45 (mean$\pm\sigma$): only small areas are dominated by gravity. However, a significant trend of rising log$\lambda$ with falling $T_{\rm dust}$ parallels Pitts et al's (2019) result: $T_{\rm dust}$ falls as $N_{\rm H_2}$ rises towards clump centres. Thus, in this massive clump sample, magnetic fields provide enough support against gravity to explain their overall low star formation rate.

 - **Abstract**
 A longstanding prediction in interstellar theory posits that significant quantities of molecular gas, crucial for star formation, may be undetected due to being ``dark" in commonly used molecular gas tracers, such as carbon monoxide. We report the discovery of Eos, the closest dark molecular cloud, located just 94 parsecs from the Sun. This cloud is the first molecular cloud ever to be identified using H$_2$ far ultra-violet (FUV) fluorescent line emission, which traces molecular gas at the boundary layers of star-forming and supernova remnant regions. The cloud edge is outlined along the high-latitude side of the North Polar Spur, a prominent x-ray/radio structure. Our distance estimate utilizes 3D dust maps, the absorption of the soft X-ray background, and hot gas tracers such as O\,{\sc vi}; these place the cloud at a distance consistent with the Local Bubble's surface. Using high-latitude CO maps we note a small amount (M$_{\rm{H}_2}\approx$20-40\,M$_\odot$) of CO-bright cold molecular gas, in contrast with the much larger estimate of the cloud's true molecular mass (M$_{\rm{H}_2}\approx3.4\times 10^3$\,M$_\odot$), indicating most of the cloud is CO-dark. Combining observational data with novel analytical models and simulations, we predict this cloud will photoevaporate in 5.7 million years, placing key constraints on the role of stellar feedback in shaping the closest star-forming regions to the Sun.

 - **Abstract**
 The recently-discovered Eos molecular cloud, is a CO-dark, low-density cloud located at a distance of approximately 94 pc from the Sun which does not appear to have formed stars at any point in its history. In this paper we investigate the magnetic fields in the Eos cloud, near the interface between the atomic Cold Neutral Medium (CNM) and molecular gas, using dust emission and extinction polarimetry. A Histogram of Relative Orientation analysis shows that the magnetic field is preferentially parallel to the density structure of the cloud, while a Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi analysis finds magnetic field strengths of 8$\pm$4 $\mu$G across the Eos cloud and 12$\pm$4 $\mu$G in the somewhat denser MBM 40 sub-region. These results are consistent with a previous estimate of magnetic field strength in the Local Bubble and suggest that the fields in the Eos cloud are dynamically important compared to both gravity and turbulence. Our findings are fully consistent with the expected behavior of magnetized, non-self-gravitating gas near the CNM/molecular cloud boundary.

 - **Abstract**
 The Cosmic Dawn Survey Pre-launch (PL) catalogues cover an effective 10.13 deg$^{2}$ area with uniform deep Spitzer/IRAC data ($m\sim25$ mag, 5$\sigma$), the largest area covered to these depths in the infrared. These data are used to gain new insight into the growth of stellar mass across cosmic history by characterising the evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) through $0.2 < z \leq 6.5$. The total volume (0.62 Gpc$^{3}$) represents a tenfold increase compared to previous works that have explored $z > 3$ and significantly reduces cosmic variance, yielding strong constraints on the abundance of massive galaxies. Results are generally consistent with the literature but now provide firm estimates of number density where only upper limits were previously available. Contrasting the GSMF with the dark matter halo mass function suggests that massive galaxies ($M \gtrsim10^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$) at $z > 3.5$ required integrated star-formation efficiencies of $M/(M_{\rm h}f_{\rm b}) \gtrsim$ 0.25--0.5, in excess of the commonly-held view of ``universal peak efficiency" from studies on the stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR). Such increased efficiencies imply an evolving peak in the SHMR at $z > 3.5$ which can be maintained if feedback mechanisms from active galactic nuclei and stellar processes are ineffective at early times. In addition, a significant fraction of the most massive quiescent galaxies are observed to be in place already by $z\sim 2.5$--3. The apparent lack in change of their number density by $z\sim 0.2$ is consistent with relatively little mass growth from mergers. Utilising the unique volume, evidence for an environmental dependence of the galaxy stellar mass function is found all the way through $z\sim 3.5$ for the first time, though a more careful characterisation of the density field is ultimately required for confirmation.

 - **Abstract**
 There is a broad consensus from theory that stellar feedback in galaxies at high redshifts is essential to their evolution, alongside conflicting evidence in the observational literature about its prevalence and efficacy. To this end, we utilize deep, high-resolution [CII] emission line data taken as part of the [CII] resolved ISM in star-forming galaxies with ALMA (CRISTAL) survey. Excluding sources with kinematic evidence for gravitational interactions, we perform a rigorous stacking analysis of the remaining 15 galaxies to search for broad emission features that are too weak to detect in the individual spectra, finding only weak evidence that a broad component is needed to explain the composite spectrum. Additionally, such evidence is mostly driven by CRISTAL-02, which is already known to exhibit strong outflows in multiple ISM phases. Interpreting modest residuals in the stack at $v\sim300$kms$^{-1}$ as an outflow, we derive a mass outflow rate of $\dot{M}_{\rm out}=26\pm11$M$_\odot$yr$^{-1}$ and a cold outflow mass-loading factor of $\eta_m=0.49\pm0.20$. This result holds for the subsample with the highest star-formation rate surface density $(\Sigma_{\rm{SFR}}>1.93$M$_\odot$yr$^{-1}$kpc$^{-2}$) but no such broad component is present in the composite of the lower-star-formation rate density subsample. Our results imply that the process of star-formation-driven feedback may already be in place in typical galaxies at $z=5$, but on average not strong enough to completely quench ongoing star formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Core-collapse supernova feedback models in hydrodynamical simulations typically assume that all stars evolve as single stars. However, the majority of massive stars are formed in binaries and multiple systems, where interactions with a companion can affect stars' subsequent evolution and kinematics. We assess the impact of binary interactions on the timing and spatial distribution of core-collapse supernovae, using `cogsworth` simulations to evolve binary star populations, and their subsequent galactic orbits, within state-of-the-art hydrodynamical zoom-in galaxy simulations. We show that binary interactions: (a) displace supernovae, with ~13% of all supernovae occurring more than 0.1 kpc from their parent cluster; and (b) produce delayed supernovae, such that ~25% of all supernovae occur after the final supernova from a single star population. Delays are largest for low-mass merger products, which can explode more than 200 Myr after a star formation event. We characterize our results as a function of: (1) initial binary population distributions, (2) binary physics parameters and evolutionary pathways, (3) birth cluster dissolution assumptions, and (4) galaxy models (which vary metallicity, star formation history, gravitational potential and simulation codes), and show that the overall timing and spatial distributions of supernovae are surprisingly insensitive to most of these variations. We provide metallicity-dependent analytic fits that can be substituted for single-star subgrid feedback prescriptions in hydrodynamical simulations, and discuss some of the possible implications for binary-driven feedback in galaxies, which may become particularly important at high redshift.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic reconnection is an explosive energy release event. It plays an important role in accelerating particles to high non-thermal energies. These particles often exhibit energy spectra characterized by a power-law distribution. However, the partitioning of energy between thermal and non-thermal components, and between ions and electrons, remains unclear. This study provides estimates of energy partition based on a statistical analysis of magnetic reconnection events in Earth's magnetotail using data from the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission. Ions are up to ten times more energetic than electrons but have softer spectra. We found for both ions and electrons that, as the average energy of particles (temperature) increases, their energy spectra become \textit{softer} (steeper) and thus, the fraction of energy carried by the non-thermal components decreases. These results challenge existing theories of particle acceleration through magnetotail reconnection.

 - **Abstract**
 Recurrent chromospheric fan-shaped jets highlight the highly dynamic nature of the solar atmosphere. They have been named as ''light walls'' or ''peacock jets'' in high-resolution observations. In this study, we examined the underlying mechanisms responsible for the generation of recurrent chromospheric fan-shaped jets utilizing data from the Goode Solar Telescope (GST) at Big Bear Solar Observatory, along with data from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) and the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard the Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO). These jets appear as dark elongated structures in H$\alpha$ wing images, persist for over an hour, and are located in the intergranular lanes between a pair of same-polarity sunspots. Our analysis reveals that magnetic flux cancellation at the jet base plays a crucial role in their formation. HMI line-of-sight magnetograms show a gradual decrease in opposite-polarity fluxes spanning the sequence of jets in H$\alpha$ - 0.8 angstrom images, suggesting that recurrent magnetic reconnection, likely driven by recurrent miniature flux-rope eruptions that are built up and triggered by flux cancellation, powers these jets. Additionally, magnetic field extrapolations reveal a 3D magnetic null-point topology at the jet formation site $\sim$1.25 Mm height. Furthermore, we observed strong brightening in AIA 304 angstrom channel above the neutral line. Based on our observations and extrapolation results, we propose that these recurrent chromospheric fan-shaped jets align with the minifilament eruption model previously proposed for coronal jets. Though our study focuses on fan-shaped jets in between same-polarity sunspots, similar mechanism might be responsible for light bridge-associated fan-shaped jets.

 - **Abstract**
 Early-type galaxies (ETGs) are known to harbour dense spheroids of stars with scarce star formation (SF). Approximately a quarter of these galaxies have rich molecular gas reservoirs yet do not form stars efficiently. These gas-rich ETGs have properties similar to those of bulges at the centres of spiral galaxies. We use spatially-resolved observations (~ 100 pc resolution) of warm ionised-gas emission lines (Hbeta, [O III], [N II], Halpha and [S II]) from the imaging Fourier transform spectrograph SITELLE at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope and cold molecular gas (12CO(2-1) or 12CO(3-2)) from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) to study the SF properties of 8 ETGs and bulges. We use the ionised-gas emission lines to classify the ionisation mechanisms and demonstrate a complete absence of regions dominated by SF ionisation in these ETGs and bulges, despite abundant cold molecular gas. The ionisation classifications also show that our ETGs and bulges are dominated by old stellar populations. We use the molecular gas surface densities and Halpha-derived SF rates (in spiral galaxies outside of the bulges) or upper limits (in ETGs and bulges) to constrain the depletion times (inverse of the SF efficiencies), suggesting again suppressed SF in our ETGs and bulges. Finally, we use the molecular gas velocity fields to measure the gas kinematics, and show that bulge dynamics, particularly the strong shear due to the deep and steep gravitational potential wells, is an important SF-regulation mechanism for at least half of our sample galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 This work examines the plausibility of a lunar origin of natural objects that have a negative total energy (ET) with respect to the geocenter while within 3 Earth Hill radii (RH), a population that we will refer to as 'bound'. They are a super-set of the population of 'minimoons' which require that the object make at least one orbit around Earth in a synodic frame rotating with Earth and that its geocentric distance be <RH at some point while ET<0. Only two minimoons have been discovered to date, 2006 RH120 and 2020 CD3, while 2024 PT5 and 2022 NX1 meet our condition for 'bound'. The likely source region of co-orbital objects is either the main belt, lunar ejecta, or a combination of both. Earlier works found that dynamical evolution of asteroids from the MB could explain the observed minimoon population, but spectra of 2020 CD3 and 2024 PT5 and Earth co-orbital (469219) Kamo'oalewa are more consistent with lunar basalts than any MB asteroid spectra. This work calculates the steady-state size-frequency distribution of the bound population given our understanding of the lunar impact rate, the energy of the impactors, crater-scaling relations, and the relationship between the ejecta mass and speed. We integrate the trajectory of lunar ejecta and calculate the statistics of 'prompt' bounding that take place immediately after ejection, and 'delayed' bounding that occurs after the objects have spent time on heliocentric orbits. A sub-set of the delayed bound population composes the minimoon population. We find that lunar ejecta can account for the observed population of bound objects but uncertainties in the crater formation and lunar ejecta properties induce a many orders of magnitude range on the predicted population. If the bound objects can be distinguished as lunar or asteroidal based on their spectra it may be possible to constrain crater formation processes.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the impact of inhomogeneous inflaton perturbations on primordial magnetic fields within the framework of generalized inflationary magnetogenesis models. Extending the Ratra model to general spacetime backgrounds, we analyze the constraint structure of the electromagnetic field and demonstrate that the standard Coulomb gauge must be generalized to accommodate spatial inhomogeneities. Instead of the vector potential, we solve the conjugate momentum with the modified initial conditions introduced by the coupling function, which become dominant during the late stages of inflation. These change the conditions under which scale-invariant electromagnetic spectra are achieved. Furthermore, we address the challenge of evaluating convolutions between vector potentials and inflaton perturbations by employing separate large- and small-scale approximations. The resulting influence to the electric and magnetic power spectra are quantified using $\Delta_E$ and $\Delta_B$, revealing a scale-dependent influence of inhomogeneities. We also find that the spectrum index evolution is sensitive to the sign of $V_{\phi}$, with distinctive behaviors for electric and magnetic fields under different scale-invariance conditions. Notably, for nearly scale-invariant magnetic fields, the perturbative effects shift the spectral index towards the red and migrate toward smaller scales as inflation progresses, offering a potential observational probe to differentiate between large-field and small-field inflation scenarios.

 - **Abstract**
 The equivalence of the Jordan and Einstein frames has been a subject of considerable interest in the field. In this paper, within the context of $f(R)$ gravity, we explore the inflationary magnetogenesis model, focusing on the magnetic field energy density and its spectrum in both the Jordan and Einstein frames to elucidate the equivalence between these two reference frames. Our analysis reveals that during the inflationary epoch, while the magnetic field exhibits a scale-invariant spectrum in the Einstein frame, it demonstrates a blue spectrum in the Jordan frame. Additionally, we investigate the post-inflationary evolution of the magnetic field's energy density in both frames, uncovering that for scale-invariant spectra in the Einstein frame during inflation, the magnetic field transitions to a blue spectrum, whereas in the Jordan frame, it evolves into a red spectrum. We also establish the conditions under which both frames may exhibit scale-invariant spectra simultaneously during the inflationary period.

 - **Abstract**
 Using over 170,000 red clump stars selected from LAMOST and APOGEE, we conduct a detailed analysis of the stellar $V_{Z}$ as a function of $L_{Z}$ (or $R_{g}$) across different $\phi$ bins for various disk populations. The $V_{Z}$ of the whole RC sample stars exhibits a wave-like pattern superimposed on an exponentially increasing trend, indicating the contribution from disk warp, disk flare and disk waves. Our results across various populations suggest that the thin disk is similar to the whole RC sample behavior, while the thick disk displays a wave-like pattern superimposed on a linearly increasing trend, meaning that the features of disk warp and waves are present in both thin and thick disks, and the disk flare feature is only present in the thin disk. These results indicate that the disk warp is potentially driven by secular processes like disk perturbations from intergalactic magnetic fields and a misaligned dark halo. The line-of-node (LON) of the disk warp of various populations displays a slight difference, with $\phi_{0}$ = 5.68 $\pm$ 2.91 degree for the whole RC sample stars, $\phi_{0}$ = 5.78 $\pm$ 2.89 degree for the thin disk stars, and $\phi_{0}$ = 4.10 $\pm$ 3.43 degree for the thick disk stars.

 - **Abstract**
 When observed at 1 AU, slow solar wind is typically considered to have originated in source regions with magnetic topologies that are intermittently open to the heliosphere. Fast wind is typically considered to have originated in source regions that are continuously open to the heliosphere eg coronal holes. The evolution of the solar wind helium abundance (AHe) with solar activity is likely driven by the evolution of different solar wind source regions. Separating the solar wind into fast and slow for each element based on its characteristic speed derived in Alterman et al. (2025) we quantify the evolution of helium and heavy element abundances $(X/H):(X/H)_\mathrm{photo}$ with solar activity. We show that AHe strongly correlates with sunspot number; in slow and fast wind the average non-transient solar wind AHe is limited to 51% of its photospheric value; slow wind heavy element abundances evolve significantly with solar activity; fast wind heavy element abundances do not; the correlation coefficient with sunspot number of elemental abundances for species heavier than He monotonically increases with increasing mass; and the correlation coefficients between the in situ observations and the normalized sunspot number are stronger than those using the unnormalized sunspot number. We infer that the sunspot number is a clock timing the solar cycle but not the driver of the physical process underlying the evolution of these abundances with solar activity; this underlying process is likely related to the energy available to accelerate the solar plasma from the chromosphere and transition region or low corona into the solar wind; and differences between the evolution of slow and fast solar wind abundances are similarly related to the energy available to accelerate the elements at these heights above the Suns surface.

 - **Abstract**
 The discovery of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at high redshifts has intensified efforts to understand their early formation and rapid growth during the cosmic dawn. Using a semi-analytical cosmological framework, we investigate the role of tidal disruption events (TDEs) involving Population III (Pop-III) stars in driving the growth of heavy seed black holes (10^4-10^6 solar mass). Our results indicate that Pop-III TDEs significantly accelerate the growth of relatively lighter massive black holes (~ 10^4-10^5 solar mass), allowing them to increase their mass by roughly an order of magnitude within the first 10 Myr. Cosmological evolution modeling further supports that such Pop-III TDE-driven growth scenarios are consistent with the formation pathways of observed luminous high-redshift quasars originating from seed black holes at 10<z<15. We also discuss the future observational probes of these early-stage growth processes that future facilities, including space-based gravitational wave observatories and infrared telescopes like JWST, could potentially detect. These findings provide a clear observational framework to test the critical role of Pop-III star interactions in the rapid buildup of SMBHs during the earliest epochs.

 - **Abstract**
 One of the potential sources of repeating Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) is a rotating magnetosphere of a compact object, as suggested by the similarities in the polarization properties of FRBs and radio pulsars. Attempts to measure an underlying period in the times of arrival of repeating FRBs have nevertheless been unsuccessful. To explain this lack of observed periodicity, it is often suggested that the line of sight towards the source must be sampling active parts of the emitting magnetosphere throughout the rotation of the compact object, i.e. has a large duty cycle, as can be the case in a neutron star with near-aligned magnetic and rotation axes. This may lead to apparently aperiodic bursts, however the polarization angle of the bursts should be tied to the rotational phase from which they occur. This is true for radio pulsars. We therefore propose a new test to identify a possible stable rotation period under the assumptions above, based on a periodogram of the measured polarization angle timeseries for repeating FRBs. We show that this test is highly sensitive when the duty cycle is large, where standard time-of-arrival periodicity searches fail. Therefore, we can directly test the hypothesis of repeating FRBs of magnetospheric origin with a stable rotation period. Both positive and negative results of the test applied to FRB data will provide important information.

 - **Abstract**
 The study of morphology in galaxies offers a convenient and quantitative method to measure the shapes and characteristics of galaxy light distribution that reflect the evolutionary history. For AGN-host dwarf galaxies, however, there is a lack of detailed studies on their morphologies. In this work, we compile a relatively large sample ($\sim$400 members) of local AGN-host dwarf ($M_{\star}\leq10^{9.5} M_{\odot}$ and $z<0.055$) galaxies selected via various methods. We use the $grz$ bands images from DESI DR10 and the Python package statmorph to measure non-parametric coefficients. We also carry out visual inspection with the assistance of deep learning to classify these galaxies into early-type (ETGs), late-type (LTGs) galaxies, and mergers, and find that about 37%, 44%, and 13% of the total sample sources are ETGs, LTGs, and mergers, respectively. In comparison to normal dwarf galaxies, AGN-host dwarfs have a higher probability to be LTGs, and a lower merger rate, indicating that mergers/interactions are not the primary driver of AGN activities. Among the subsamples selected with different methods, the BPT sample has the highest fraction of ETGs, the variability sample consists of the largest fraction of LTGs, and the mid-IR sample contains the most mergers.

 Uranus and Neptune, the so-called "ice giants", represent a fascinating class of planets. They are the outermost planets in the solar system with intermediate masses/sizes, complex non-polar magnetic fields, strong atmospheric winds, and not well-understood internal structures. Studying the interiors of Uranus and Neptune is vital for advancing our understanding of planetary formation and evolution as well as for the characterization of planets around other stars. In this review, we summarize our current knowledge of the interior and formation of Uranus and Neptune. Both planets are expected to be composed of rocks and ices and have H-He atmospheres of the order of 10% of their total masses. The rock-to-water ratios in Uranus and Neptune, however, are very uncertain. It is also unclear how the different materials are distributed within the interiors and whether distinct layers exist. While often Uranus and Neptune are viewed as being "twin planets" it is in fact unclear how different the two planets are from each other, and whether they are indeed "icy" (water-dominated) planets. After summarizing the current-knowledge of the interiors of Uranus and Neptune, we briefly discuss their magnetic fields and atmosphere dynamics. We next introduce the challenges in constraining the formation paths of Uranus and Neptune: it is still unclear whether the planets formed at their current locations, and what the dominating processes that led to their formation (accretion rates, size of solids, etc.) were. We also mention the possible role of giant impacts shortly after their formation. Finally, we suggest that advanced modeling, future observations from space and the ground, lab experiments, and links with exoplanetary science can improve our understanding of Uranus and Neptune as a class of astronomical objects which seems to be very common in our galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 Radio detection is now an established technique for the study of ultra-high-energy (UHE) cosmic rays with energies above $\sim10^{17}$ eV. The next-generation of radio experiments aims to extend this technique to the observation of UHE earth-skimming neutrinos, which requires the detection of very inclined extensive air showers (EAS). In this article we present a new reconstruction method for the arrival direction and the energy of EAS. It combines a point-source-like description of the radio wavefront with a phenomenological model: the Angular Distribution Function (ADF). The ADF describes the angular distribution of the radio signal amplitude in the 50-200 MHz frequency range, with a particular focus on the Cherenkov angle, a crucial feature of the radio amplitude pattern. The method is applicable to showers with zenith angles larger than $60^\circ$, and in principle up to neutrino-induced showers with up-going trajectories. It is tested here on a simulated data set of EAS induced by cosmic rays. A resolution better than 4 arc-minutes ($0.07^\circ$) is achieved on arrival direction, as well as an intrinsic resolution of 5% on the electromagnetic energy, and around 15% on the primary energy.

 - **Abstract**
 Lithium is predicted, and observed, to be depleted in contracting, low-mass pre main sequence (PMS) stars. Yet these stars reach the zero age main sequence (ZAMS) with a spread in lithium abundance at a given effective temperature that is not predicted by standard stellar evolutionary models and which appears to be correlated with rotation. Using a homogeneous dataset provided by the Gaia-ESO spectroscopic survey, we have followed the evolving photospheric lithium content of cohorts of stars destined to be ZAMS late G-, K- and M-dwarfs, in clusters at ages of 2-300 Myr. We show that a dispersion in the LiI 6708A line strength develops in the lower mass stars after 10-20 Myr on the PMS, as soon as Li depletion begins, even in fully convective stars. A model based on a surface starspot coverage varying from star-to-star, leading to a differential Li-burning rate, can explain this temporal behaviour and its mass dependence. However, to fully explain the magnitude of the Li dispersion and its correlation with rotation, the spot coverage during Li-burning would need to be a factor of two larger on average than measured in ZAMS clusters like the Pleiades and continue increasing with rotation in PMS stars beyond the usual "saturation limit" observed for other magnetic activity indicators.
#### Dust-driven vortex cascades originating at water snow region: A pathway to planetesimal formation

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of observed planetary systems, including our solar system, as well as their diversity is still an open question. Streaming instability (SI) is an important mechanism for the formation of gravitationally bound planetesimals, which can grow to form planetary embryos and eventually planets. Snow lines in a protoplanetary disk can assist this process, as they can form pressure maxima and promote both dust accumulation and growth. Since the sublimation of a volatile is gradual due to opacity changes, a snow line in a protoplanetary disk is in fact a radially extended "snow region" of constant temperature. Regály et al. (2021) showed that the dust can affect the disk viscosity by adsorption of charged particles and a small perturbation in gas can lead to excitation of multiple small-scale Rossby vortices. Here we investigate the possibility of excitation of Rossby vortices and rapid planetesimal formation at temperature substructures associated with the snow regions, with the help of global, two dimensional, gas-dust coupled hydrodynamic simulations, which include dust feedback and self-gravity. We find that an initial temperature substructure in a protoplanetary disk can seed a rapid cascade of long-lived, self-sustaining Rossby vortices. The vortices accumulate significant amount of dust and the local conditions are favorable for streaming instability as well as gravitational collapse. However, the vortex formation via this mechanism requires sufficient decoupling between dust and gas, and such conditions may not be satisfied at early time when the disk is dense in gas, resulting in a delayed onset of vortex formation. The self-sustaining Rossby vortices offer exceptionally favorable conditions for dust growth and formation of planetesimals, as well as a possible pathway for rapid formation of planetary cores.
#### A Multi-Spacecraft Analysis of Type III Radio Burst Electron Beam Deceleration and electron deceleration model in the inhomegeneous plasma

 - **Abstract**
 Electron beams accelerated in solar flares and escaping from the Sun along open magnetic field lines can trigger intense radio emissions known as type III solar radio bursts. Utilizing observations by Parker Solar Probe (PSP), STEREO-A (STA), Solar Orbiter (SolO), and Wind spacecrafts, the speeds and accelerations of type III exciters are derived for simple and isolated type III solar bursts. For the first time, simultaneous four spacecraft observations allow to determine positions, and correct the resulting velocities and accelerations for the location between the spacecraft and the apparent source. We observe velocities and acceleration to change as $u(r) \propto r^{-0.37 \pm 0.14}$ and $a(r) \propto r^{-1.71 \pm 0.20}$ with radial distance from the Sun $r$. To explain the electron beam deceleration, we develop a simple gas-dynamic description of the electron beam moving through plasma with monotonically decreasing density. The model predicts that the beam velocity decreases as $u(f)\propto f^{1/4}(r)$, so the acceleration changes $\propto r^{-1.58}$ (and speed as $\propto r^{-0.29}$) for the plasma density profile $n(r)\propto r^{-2.3}$. The deceleration is consistent with the average observation values corrected for the type III source locations. Intriguingly, the observations also show differences in velocity and acceleration of the same type III observed by different spacecrafts. We suggest the difference could be related to the additional time delay caused by radio-wave scattering between the spacecraft and the source.
#### Characterizing the Impact of Alfvén Wave Forcing in Interplanetary Space on the Distribution of near-Earth Solar Wind Speeds

 - **Abstract**
 Broadly, solar wind source regions can be classified by their magnetic topology as intermittently and continuously open to the heliosphere. Early models of solar wind acceleration do not account for the fastest, non-transient solar wind speeds observed near-Earth and energy must be deposited into the solar wind after it leaves the Sun. Alfvén wave energy deposition and thermal pressure gradients are likely candidates and the relative contribution of each acceleration mechanism likely depends on the source region. Although solar wind speed is a rough proxy for solar wind source region, it cannot unambiguously identify source region topology. Using near-Sun observations of the solar wind's kinetic energy flux, we predict the expected kinetic energy flux near-Earth. This predicted kinetic energy flux corresponds to the range of solar wind speeds observed in the fast solar wind and infer that the solar wind's near-Sun kinetic energy flux is sufficient to predict the distribution of fastest, non-transient speeds observed near Earth. Applying a recently developed model of solar wind evolution in the inner heliosphere, we suggest that the acceleration required to generate this distribution of fastest, non-transient speeds is likely due to the continuous deposition of energy by Alfvén wave forcing during the solar wind's propagation through interplanetary space. We infer that the solar wind's Alfvénicity can statistically map near-Earth observations to their source regions because the Alfvén wave forcing that the solar wind experiences in transit is a consequence of the source region topology.
#### Complex morphology and precession indicators of AGN jets in LoTSS DR2

 - **Abstract**
 The LOw Frequency ARray Two-metre Sky Survey second data release (LoTSS DR2) covers 27\% of the northern sky and contains around four million radio sources. The development of this catalogue involved a large citizen science project (Radio Galaxy Zoo: LOFAR) with more than 116,000 resolved sources going through visual inspection. We took a subset of sources with flux density above 75 mJy and an angular size of $90''$ or greater, giving a total of $9,985$ sources or $\sim 10\%$ of the visually inspected sources. We classified these by visual inspection in terms of broad source type (e.g., Fanaroff-Riley class I or II, narrow or wide-angle tail, relaxed double), noticeable features (wings, visible jets, banding, filaments etc), environmental features (cluster environment, merger, diffuse emission). Our specific aim was to search for features linked to jet precession, such as a misaligned jet axis, curvature and multiple hotspots. This combination of features and morphology allowed us to detect increasingly fine-grained sub-populations of interesting or unusual sources. We found that $28\%$ of sources showed evidence of one or more precession indicators, which could make them candidates for hosting close binary supermassive black holes. Potential precession signatures occur in sources of all sizes and luminosities in our sample but appear to favour more massive host galaxies. Our work greatly expands the sample size and parameter space of searches for precession signatures in powerful jetted sources. This work also showcases the diversity of large bright radio sources in the LOFAR surveys, whether or not precession indicators are present.
