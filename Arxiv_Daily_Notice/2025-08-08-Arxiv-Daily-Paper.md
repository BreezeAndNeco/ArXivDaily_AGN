#### Unified understanding of Alfvénic superradiance and the Blandford-Znajek process in a force-free black hole magnetosphere
 - **Authors:** Sousuke Noda, Masaaki Takahashi

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the extraction of energy from a Kerr black hole via Alfvén waves (i.e., Alfvénic superradiance) in a force-free magnetosphere, in which the plasma inertia effects are ignored. We analyze the Poynting flux generated by Alfvén waves that propagate toward the event horizon across the inner light surface, the causal boundary for the waves. We find the relationship between the energy flux associated with Alfvén waves and that of the Blandford-Znajek (BZ) process. That is, both mechanisms can be described within a unified formulation of the Poynting flux, where the BZ process can be regarded as the long wavelength limit of the Alfvénic superradiance, and depending on the wave's frequency, Alfvén waves enhance or suppress the Poynting flux in the BZ process. This unified framework for the BZ process and the Alfvénic superradiance would offer a valuable perspective for understanding the energy sources of high-energy astrophysical phenomena, such as relativistic jets.

 - **Abstract**
 Cold Classical Kuiper belt objects (CCKBOs) are considered first-generation planetesimals that formed 42-47 au from the Sun and remained untouched since. Formation is thought to proceed by clumping of dust particles in protoplanetary disk gas by the streaming instability, followed by gravitational collapse. Previous calculations along these lines are inconsistent with the CCKB's supposedly pristine nature, because they assume orders of magnitude more solid mass than is actually present in the CCKB (a few thousandths of an Earth mass) and do not explain how to expel the >99% extra mass. Here we show from 3D numerical simulations of dust and gas that the total mass in CCKBOs, their characteristic sizes of ~100 km, and the preponderance of prograde binaries can all be reproduced at the tail end of the solar nebula's life, when it contained just 2-5% of its original (minimum-mass) gas. As a solar metallicity's worth of mm-sized solids drains out from 42-47 au from nebular headwinds, about 1% of the dust collapses into planetesimals that remain behind in the CCKB region. Binarity is guaranteed from a simple analytic estimate, confirmed numerically, of the spin angular momentum in clumps seeded by the streaming instability. We show that other formation scenarios, including trapping of dust within a gas pressure bump, fail to reproduce the low-mass CCKB. Outstanding problems are identified.
#### JVLA and VLBA study of the merging cool core CHIPS 1911+4455 at z~0.5: radio emission from an infant AGN and from a rapidly star-forming BCG

 - **Abstract**
 Recent studies of galaxy clusters found peculiar cases at the boundary between non-cool core and cool core systems. While unusual, these objects can help us understand the evolution of the most massive clusters. We investigated the role of active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback in the starburst brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) of the merging cool core cluster CHIPS 1911+4455 (z = 0.485). We conducted new multifrequency (0.3 - 5 GHz) Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) and Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA) observations of CHIPS 1911+4455 across a wide range of scales (0.01 to 20 kpc). Our analysis reveals that the AGN in the BCG has recently awakened, showing a compact core with symmetric, ~30 pc long jets in VLBA data. The onset of the AGN may be linked to the enhanced cooling of the hot gas found in a previous study. At larger scales (10 kpc), faint radio whiskers extending to the south show a striking alignment with star-forming knots and are thus interpreted as synchrotron-emitting regions associated with the starburst BCG. The implied radio star formation rate of 100 - 155 M$_{\odot}$/yr agrees with the optical/infrared one (140 - 190 M$_{\odot}$/yr). Our JVLA and VLBA radio study, informed by previous X-ray/optical/millimeter works, indicates that CHIPS 1911+4455 represents a transitional phase in cluster evolution, where the AGN in the central galaxy has just begun to respond to copious hot gas cooling.
#### Flares on TRAPPIST-1 reveal the spectrum of magnetic features on its surface

 - **Abstract**
 TRAPPIST-1 is an M8 dwarf hosting seven known exoplanets and is currently one of the most frequently observed targets of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). However, it is notoriously active, and its surface is believed to be covered by magnetic features that contaminate the planetary transmission spectra. The radiative spectra of these magnetic features are needed to clean transmission spectra, but they currently remain unknown. Here, we develop a new approach for measuring these spectra using time-resolved JWST/NIRISS observations. We detect a persistent post-flare enhancement in the spectral flux of TRAPPIST-1. Our analysis rules out lingering flare decay as the cause of the flux enhancement and, thus, points to structural changes on the stellar surface induced by flares. We suggest that the flaring event triggers the disappearance of (part of) a dark magnetic feature, producing a net brightening. This suggestion is motivated by solar data: flare-induced disappearance of magnetic features on the solar surface has been directly detected in high spatial resolution images, and our analysis shows that this process produces changes in solar brightness very similar to those we observe on TRAPPIST-1. The proposed explanation for the flux enhancement enables, to our knowledge, the first measurement of the spectrum of a magnetic feature on an M8 dwarf. Our analysis indicates that the disappearing magnetic feature is cooler than the TRAPPIST-1 photosphere, but by at most a few hundred kelvins.
#### Detection of New Auroral Emissions at Io and Implications for Its Interaction with the Plasma Torus

 - **Abstract**
 We observed Io's optical aurora in eclipse on six nights between 2022 and 2024 using Keck I/HIRES. Spectra revealed 13 new auroral emissions not identified previously, tripling the total number of optical emissions lines detected at Io. These included the O I lines at 777.4 and 844.6 nm, the Na I lines at 818.3 and 819.5 nm, the [S I] lines at 458.9 and 772.5 nm, the S I triplet at 922.3 nm, the [O II] lines at 732.0 and 733.0 nm and the [S II] lines at 406.9, 407.6, 671.6 and 673.1 nm. We leveraged these new detections by comparing with imaging data from the 2001 Cassini flyby to better understand the distribution of atmospheric species and their contribution to the observed auroral brightnesses. Our auroral emission model showed that the observed 557.7, 777.4 and 844.6 nm oxygen emission line brightnesses could be explained by excitation by electron impact of canonical 5 eV torus electrons on an atmosphere composed of O, SO2 and an isoelectronic proxy for SO. The SO2 emission did not decrease immediately after eclipse ingress, suggesting the emitting column may be restricted to higher altitudes. The derived O/SO2 mixing ratio was typically about 10%, but it also exhibited order-of-magnitude variance during some observations. Io's 630.0 nm [O I] brightness did not strongly vary with plasma sheet distance, suggesting electron flux at Io varies substantially beyond model predictions.
#### Evaluating the Accuracy of Reionization Prescriptions in Semi-analytic Models of the First Stars and Galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 Semi-analytic models are a valuable tool to study the first stars and galaxies. Their numerical efficiency makes it possible to survey broad regions of astrophysical parameter space across large volumes and redshift ranges. Following reionization in these models is necessary since star formation is suppressed in ionized regions due to photoheating of the gas. Here we evaluate the accuracy of three semi-analytic reionization prescriptions (two previously developed and one new model) by comparing their three-dimensional distribution of ionized bubbles to the Renaissance hydrodynamical cosmological radiative transfer simulations. We find that the previously existing models accurately determine the distribution of the larger bubbles within our ${\sim}6$ comoving Mpc simulation box, but that these models fail to take into account self-shielded neutral gas in dense filaments. Thus, these prescriptions overestimate the fraction of halos in HII regions impacted by reionization feedback by up to an order of magnitude (depending on halo mass and redshift). This leads to an unrealistically large effect of reionization feedback on Pop III stars and low-mass metal-enriched galaxies. Our newly developed model takes into account the density structure of the cosmic web, leading to good agreement with Renaissance in the fraction of halos found in ionized regions.
#### North-South Asymmetry of the Solar Activity at Different Spatial Scales

 - **Abstract**
 Solar activity seems quite understandable when considered on the scales comparable with a solar cycle, i.e. about 11 years, and on a short time scale of about a year. A solar cycle looks basically (anti)symmetric with respect to the solar equator, while the sunspot distribution is more or less random. We investigated the difference in the spatial distribution of magnetic structures on both time scales in terms of sunspots and the surface large-scale magnetic field and arrived at the conclusion that the structures of each type are created by a specific mechanism. For long-term structures, it is the mean-field dynamo. For the short-term ones, it is the spot production considered as a separate physical mechanism. The relationship between the mean-field dynamo mechanism and the processes of sunspot formation is a complex problem of current interest. The 11-year cycle itself is created by the mean-field dynamo and is most likely determined by processes in the convection zone. However, the transformation of magnetic flux into spots and active regions occurs, apparently, on significantly shorter time scales and probably develops directly in the subsurface layers, i.e., Near-Surface Shear Layer (NSSL) or leptocline.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first application of semi-coherent strategies in the search for optical pulsations from binary systems, which resulted in the tightest constraints on pulsations from Sco X-1. We analysed observations from the SiFAP2 fast photometer mounted at the TNG spread across four years, for a total of $\sim$56 ks divided in two datasets. The great efficiency of semi-coherent techniques when only limited knowledge on the orbital parameters is available allowed us to set an upper limit at $9.23 \cdot 10^{-5}$ in pulsed amplitude for this source, improving on previous results by a factor of 4. Reaching the same upper limit with fully coherent searches would have required a number of trials more than two orders of magnitude larger. We also applied the same algorithm to an optical observation of a system containing a known pulsar, PSR J1023+0038, ignoring the refined knowledge of the orbital parameters that was allowed by the identification of the pulsar itself in the radio band: through this analysis, we proved that detection of the pulsar would have followed even with data in the optical band alone.
#### AGN Feedback Models and AGN Demographics I: Radio-Mode AGN in EAGLE, SIMBA and TNG100 are Inconsistent with Observations

 - **Abstract**
 We compare predictions of how Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) populate host galaxies at low redshifts to observations, finding large discrepancies between cosmological simulation predictions and observed patterns. Modern cosmological simulations include AGN feedback models tuned to reproduce the observed galaxy stellar mass function. However, due to a lack of real understanding of the physics of AGN feedback, these models vary significantly across simulations. To distinguish between the models and potentially test the underlying physics, we carry out independent tests of these models. In an earlier study, we found that $F_{\rm AGN}$ -- the observed completeness-corrected fraction of galaxies hosting radio AGN with an Eddington ratio $\lambda > 10^{-3}$ -- to be a strong function of host galaxy stellar mass ($M_\star$) but nearly independent of host specific star formation rates (sSFR) at fixed $M_\star$. In this study, we test the radio mode AGN feedback models of the EAGLE, SIMBA, and TNG100 simulations by comparing their predictions of $F_{\rm AGN} \left(M_\star \right)$ to our observational constraint. We find that none of these simulations even qualitatively reproduce the observed dependencies of $F_{\rm AGN}$ on $M_\star$ and sSFR. Finally, we find that although the given TNG100 model could be modified in order to better reproduce the observed $F_{\rm AGN}$ trend, this modification would likely also change its prediction for the local stellar mass function and star formation rates -- key observations used for calibrating the simulation in the first place. Our findings highlight a pressing need to revisit the AGN feedback prescriptions in EAGLE, SIMBA, TNG100 and other similar models.

 - **Abstract**
 We present $\sim$500 ks XRISM observations covering the central and two northern regions of the Abell 2029 galaxy cluster. Resolve enables us to distinguish multiple emission lines from hydrogen-like and helium-like iron (Fe) ions. This study focuses on the multi-temperature structure of Abell 2029 using line-ratio diagnostics. Using a single-temperature collisionally ionized equilibrium model, we measure average plasma temperatures of 6.73 keV, 7.61 keV, and 8.14 keV in the central, inner northern, and outer northern regions, respectively, spanning a radial range up to 700 kpc. To further investigate thermal structure, we derive excitation and ionization temperatures by comparing observed emission-line flux ratios with atomic database predictions. Significant deviations from the single-temperature CIE model in the central and inner northern regions indicate the presence of multi-phase gas. The excitation and ionization temperatures range from 2.85 keV to 8.5 keV in the central region, 4.3 keV to 9.8 keV in the inner northern region, and 8.3 keV to 10.4 keV in the outer northern region. These temperature distributions are largely consistent with the previously observed temperature gradient of A2029. However, Resolve detects two notably cooler components--3.42 keV in the central region and $\sim$4.3 keV in the inner northern region--likely associated with displaced cool gas due to gas sloshing. Additionally, we thermally resolve a 2.85 keV gas component at the core of A2029--potentially a significant development in our understanding of gas cooling. We propose that this cooler gas is a direct product of ongoing cooling processes in A2029, having already cooled to its present temperature. If this temperature structure is stable and no heating mechanism is present, this reservoir is likely to cool to even lower temperatures and form stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Theoretical models of star formation consistently underestimate the rates observed in astronomical surveys. Stars form within giant molecular clouds, which fragment into dense clumps under the combined influences of turbulence, magnetic fields, radiation and gravity. While some of these clumps collapse spontaneously, others require an external trigger, a mechanism estimated to account for 14-25% of star formation in regions such as the Elephant Trunk Nebula. Laboratory astrophysics has emerged as a powerful approach for investigating such triggering processes, particularly those involving supernova remnants (SNRs). Recent experiments, guided by well-established scaling laws, have successfully replicated the dynamics of SNRs and their interactions with dense clumps or other SNRs. In this work, we present a comprehensive numerical study of these experimental configurations using the 3D radiation-hydrodynamics code TROLL. The simulations provide enhanced insight into the underlying physical mechanisms, accurately reproduce key experimental phenomena and offer valuable comparisons with analytical models. This study underscores the strong synergy between laboratory experiments and numerical simulations, laying a robust foundation for future advancements in laboratory astrophysics. Furthermore, we propose a new experimental setup that offers improved scaling for the asymmetric collision observed in the DEM L316 system. Our findings also show that SNR collisions in dense environments can decrease the gravitational stability of dense clumps, thereby promoting their collapse and potentially triggering star formation.
#### The IACOB project XV. Updated calibrations of fundamental parameters of Galactic O-type stars

 - **Abstract**
 Modern spectroscopic surveys combined with Gaia distances are enabling reliable estimates of fundamental parameters for hundreds of Galactic O-type stars and the full range of spectral types and luminosity classes. Here we provide updated, statistically robust empirical calibrations of the fundamental parameters of Galactic O-type stars, as well as of their absolute visual magnitudes (Mv) and bolometric corrections (BC), based on high-quality observational data. We perform a homogeneous analysis of a sample of 358 Galactic O-type stars, combining high-resolution spectroscopy and Gaia distances. A subset of 234 stars meeting strict quality criteria involving parallax, extinction, and multi-band photometry was used to derive empirical calibrations of fundamental parameters. For those same stars, calibrated parameters were estimated from their measured Mv using the derived relations, allowing us to assess the internal consistency and predictive power of the calibrations. We present updated spectral-type-based calibrations of fundamental parameters for luminosity classes V, III, and I. Compared to previous works, we find systematic shifts, particularly in effective temperature for dwarfs and in Mv across all classes, which propagate into derived quantities. Applying the Mv calibrations to the full sample yields consistent estimates of radius and luminosity, while spectroscopic mass (Msp) shows significant scatter. We also evaluate the FW3414 parameter (from the Hbeta line) as a calibrator for Mv, useful in large surveys lacking reliable spectral classification. Excluding SB1 systems has a noticeable impact only on the Msp calibration for LC V. These updated empirical calibrations offer a robust reference for Galactic O-type stars and will support studies of massive star populations in both Galactic and extragalactic contexts, particularly in the era of large spectroscopic surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Simulating stellar dynamics in a molecular cloud environment is numerically challenging due to the strong coupling between young stars and their surrounding gas, and the large range of length and time scales. Aims. This paper is the first of a suite aimed at investigating the complex early stellar dynamics in star-forming regions. We present a new simulation framework which is the key to generating a larger set of simulations, enabling statistical analysis. Methods. Methods originating from the stellar dynamics community, including regularisation and slowdown methods (SDAR), have been added to the hydrodynamical code Phantom to produce simulations of embedded cluster early dynamics. This is completed by a novel prescription of star formation to initialise stars with a low numerical cost, but in a way that is consistent with the gas distribution. Finally, a prescription for H ii region expansion has been added to model the gas removal. Results. We have run testcase simulations following the dynamical evolution of stellar clusters from the cloud collapse to a few Myr. Our new numerical methods fulfil their function by speeding up the calculation. The N-body dynamics with our novel implementation never appear as a bottleneck. Our first simulations show that massive stars largely impact the star formation process and shape the dynamics of the resulting cluster. Depending on the position of these massive stars and the strength of their feedback, they can prematurely dismantle part of the cloud or trigger a second event of cloud collapse, preferentially forming low-mass stars. This stochastic behaviour confirms the need for statistical studies. Conclusions. Our new Phantom N-Body framework enables efficient simulation of the formation and evolution of star clusters. It enables the statistical analysis needed to build models of the dynamical evolution of embedded star clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 Spatially resolved gas-phase metallicity maps are a crucial element in understanding the chemical evolution of galaxies. We present spatially resolved metallicity maps obtained from NIRISS/WFSS observations. This is the first such work presenting multiple individual galaxies. We investigate the source of ionisation, metallicity and its relation to star-formation in a spatially-resolved sense for a sample of eight galaxies -- four from JWST-PASSAGE and four from GLASS-JWST ERS. All but one galaxy are in the redshift range $1.9 \leq z \leq 2$, the outlier being at $z = 3.1$. Our sample covers a range of $8.0 <$ \logM $< 9.5$ in stellar mass, $0.2 <$ $\log{\rm{(SFR}}$/\Msunpyr) $< 1.1$ in star-formation rate (SFR) and $7.8 <$ \logOH $< 9.0$ in global metallicity. As a solution to the challenge of SF-AGN demarcation in absence of resolved \halpha, we present a new SF-demarcation line in the \textit{OHNO} parameter space based on MAPPINGS v5.1 publicly available \hii region model grids. We present the mass-metallicity gradient relation for our sample, which showed no clear trend with stellar mass, perhaps hinting at the fact that the high-$z$ galaxies have not yet started their accretion dominated phase. By interpreting the correlation between spatially resolved metallicity and SFR maps as a proxy for effective timescales of metal-transport in galaxies, we find a weak trend such that this timescale increases with stellar mass, implying a more effective feedback in lower mass galaxies.
#### Metallicity of Active Galactic Nuclei from ultraviolet and optical emission lines-II. Revisiting the $C43$ metallicity calibration and its implications

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, a new semi-empirical calibration is proposed between ultraviolet emission lines (\ion{C}{iii}]$\lambda1909$, \ion{C}{iv}$\lambda1549$, \ion{He}{ii}]$\lambda1640$) of type~2 AGNs and their metallicity ($Z$). This calibration is derived by comparing a large sample of 106 objects (data taken from the literature) located over a wide range of redshifts ($0 \: \lesssim \: z \: \lesssim \: 4.0$) with predictions from photoionization models that adopt a recent C/O-O/H relation derived via estimates using the $T_{\rm e}$ method, which is considered the most reliable method. We found that the new calibration produces $Z$ values in agreement (within an uncertainty of $\pm 0.1$ dex) with those from other calibrations and from estimates via the $T_{\rm e}$-method. We find also that AGN metallicities are already high at early epochs, with no evidence for monotonic evolution across the redshift range $0 \: \lesssim \: z \: \lesssim \: 12$. Notably, the highest metallicities in our sample, reaching up to $\rm 4\: Z_{\odot}$, are found in objects at $2 \lesssim z \lesssim 3$. This redshift range coincides with the peak of the cosmic star formation rate history, suggesting a strong connection between the major epoch of star formation, black hole growth, and rapid metal enrichment in the host galaxies of AGNs. Furthermore, our analysis reveals no significant correlation between AGN metallicity and radio properties (radio spectral index or radio luminosity) or host galaxy stellar mass. The lack of a clear mass-metallicity relation, consistent with findings for local AGNs, suggests that the chemical evolution of the nuclear gas is decoupled from the global properties of the host galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the first detection of circular polarization in 4.7 GHz excited OH masers in star-forming regions made using full Stokes measurements with the Green Bank 100m telescope. The Zeeman shift between the two circular components provides a measure of the magnetic field pervading these maser spots. Three different methods are used to determine the shift in velocity between the Right Circular Polarization and Left Circular Polarization components. We find fields with $B \sim 100$ mG using archival molecular parameters that have limited precision and uncertain values. Reservations of using 1.7 and 6.0 GHz OH masers to estimate magnetic fields in star-forming regions are discussed.
#### A plasmoid-model for mass loss from stars on the upper red giant branch: The mass loss rate is controlled by the number of density scale heights in the convection zone

 - **Abstract**
 Recent asteroseismic determinations of {\Delta}M, the integrated mass loss on the red giant branch (RGB), for fields stars show a trend of {\Delta}M decreasing as metallicity increases. This trend among field stars is inconsistent with many existing models of RGB mass loss. The present paper is motivated by a 'plasmoid' model of RGB mass loss in which magnetic flux loops, generated by a shear dynamo operating below the convection zone, are buoyed up to the stellar surface starting at the evolutionary stage right after the RGB 'kink'. This model leads us to examine correlations between, on the one hand, the average post-kink RGB mass loss rate, determined from {\Delta}M and the post-kink RGB lifetime, and on the other hand, stellar properties which exist just after the end of the kink. For three distinct stellar samples, we find strong anti-correlations between the average post-kink RGB mass loss rate and the number of density scale heights in the convection zone. This leads us to propose that the number of density scale heights in the convection zone is a dominant factor in determining the rate of the mass loss process which sets in after the RGB kink.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast Radio Burst (FRB) 20250316A, detected by CHIME on 2025 March 16 with a fluence of $1.7\pm0.1~\mathrm{Jy\,ms}$ and a dispersion measure of $161.3\pm0.4~\mathrm{pc\,cm^{-3}}$, ranks among the brightest extragalactic FRBs at $\sim 40$ Mpc. We obtained deep Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array follow-up at 15~GHz on 2025 April 5 and 9 and find no persistent radio source (PRS). Our best image reaches an rms of $2.8~\mu\mathrm{Jy\,beam^{-1}}$, yielding a $3\sigma$ upper limit of $<8.4~\mu\mathrm{Jy}$ at the FRB position, corresponding to $\nu L_\nu < 2.4\times10^{35}~\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$. These results represent among the most stringent constraints for a non-repeating FRB, lying $\gtrsim 3$ orders of magnitude below the $\nu L_\nu$ of compact persistent radio sources around well-studied repeaters, thereby disfavoring bright magnetar-nebula scenarios and pointing to low-density, weakly magnetized environments. Interpreting our limit through pulsar-/magnetar-wind synchrotron frameworks places joint constraints on ambient density and engine power. If the empirical PRS--rotation-measure trend reported for repeaters extends to one-off sources, our limit implies $\vert \mathrm{RM} \vert \lesssim 30~\mathrm{rad\,m^{-2}}$, consistent with a clean magneto-ionic sight line and progenitor channels such as neutron-star mergers or giant flares from older magnetars.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Magnetic reconnection events are frequently observed in the solar wind. Understanding the patterns and structures within the solar wind is crucial to put observed magnetic reconnection events into context, since their occurrence rate and properties are likely influenced by solar wind conditions. Aims. We employed unsupervised learning techniques such as self-organizing maps (SOM) and K-Means to cluster and interpret solar wind data at 1 AU for an improved understanding of the conditions that lead to magnetic reconnection in the solar wind. Methods. We collected magnetic field data and proton density, proton temperature, and solar wind speed measurements taken by the Wind spacecraft. After preprocessing the data, we trained a SOM to visualize the high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional space and applied K-Means clustering to identify distinct clusters within the solar wind data. Results. Our analysis revealed that the reconnection events are distributed across five different clusters: a) slow solar wind, b) compressed slow wind, c) highly Alfvénic wind, d) compressed fast wind, and e) ejecta. Compressed slow and fast wind and ejecta are clusters associated with solar wind transients such as stream interaction regions and interplanetary coronal mass ejections. The majority of the reconnection events are associated with the slow solar wind, followed by the highly Alfvénic wind, compressed slow wind, and compressed fast wind, and a small fraction of the reconnection events are associated with ejecta. Conclusions. Unsupervised learning approaches with SOM and K-Means lead to physically interpretable solar wind clusters based on their transients and allow for the contextualization of magnetic reconnection exhausts' occurrence in the solar wind.

 - **Abstract**
 This study presents a comparative analysis of mass-loss and dust-production rates in the dwarf galaxies NGC 147 and NGC 185, focusing on long-period variables (LPVs) and pulsating asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars as primary indicators of dust feedback into the interstellar medium. For NGC 147, the total mass-loss rate is calculated as $(9.44 \pm 3.78) \times 10^{-4} M_{sun} yr^{-1}$, with LPV luminosities ranging from $(6.20 \pm 0.25) \times 10^{2} L_\odot$ to $( 7.87 \pm 0.32) \times 10^{3} L_\odot $. In NGC 185, the total mass-loss rate is higher, at $(1.58 \pm 0.63) \times 10^{-3} M_{sun} yr^{-1}$, with LPV luminosities spanning $ (5.68 \pm 0.23) \times 10^{2} L_\odot $ to $(1.54 \pm 0.66) \times 10^{4} L_\odot$. A positive correlation is observed between stellar luminosity, intrinsic reddening due to circumstellar dust self-extinction, and elevated mass-loss rates. Additionally, comparisons of calculated dust injection rates, two-dimensional dust distribution maps, and observed dust masses provide evidence for a gravitational interaction between NGC 147 and the Andromeda galaxy, which influences the dust distribution within the system.
