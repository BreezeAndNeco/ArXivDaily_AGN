#### Turbulence Inhibits Planetesimal Formation in Class 0/I Disks Subject to Infall

 - **Abstract**
 There is growing evidence that planet formation begins early, within the $\lesssim 1$Myr Class 0/I phase, when infall dominates disk dynamics. Our goal is to determine if Class 0/I disks reach the conditions needed to form planetesimals ($\sim 100$km planet building blocks) by the streaming instability (SI). We focus on a recent suggestion that early infall causes an ``inflationary'' phase in which dust grains are advected outward. We modified the \texttt{DustPy} code to build a 1D disk that includes dust evolution, infall, and heating and cooling sources. We ran six models and examined the implications for the SI, taking into account recent works on how the SI responds to external turbulence. In line with other works, we find that grains are advected outward, which leads to ``advection-condensation-drift'' loop that greatly enhances the dust density at the water snowline. However, we do not see this process at the silicate line. Instead, we find a new pile up at the edge of the expanding disk. However, despite these localized enhancements, even a modest amount of turbulence ($\alpha = 10^{-3}$) leaves planetesimal formation far out of reach. The midplane dust-to-gas ratio is at least an order of magnitude below the SI threshold, even taking into account recent results on how dust coagulation boosts the SI. For planetesimals to form in the Class 0/I phase may require a way to transport angular momentum without turbulence (e.g., disk winds) or a non-SI mechanism to form planetesimals.

 - **Abstract**
 The rates and properties of tidal disruption events (TDEs) provide valuable insights into their host galaxy central stellar densities and the demographics of their central supermassive black holes (SMBHs). TDEs have been observed only at low redshifts ($z \lesssim 1$), due to the difficulty in conducting deep time-domain surveys. In this work, we present the discovery of a high-redshift TDE candidate, HZTDE-1, in the COSMOS-Web survey with JWST's NIRCam, using a novel selection technique based on color and morphology. We first outline a methodology for identifying high-z TDEs in deep infrared imaging surveys, leveraging their unique spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and morphologies of these transients. We apply this technique to COSMOS-Web in filters F115W, F150W, F277W, and F444W, and identify HZTDE-1, a transient point source relative to archival UltraVISTA infrared observations. If we assume it is a TDE, we estimate its photometric redshift to be $z=5.02^{+1.32}_{-1.11}$. HZTDE-1 cannot be explained by reasonable supernova or AGN models. However, we cannot rule out a superluminous supernova at $z\gtrsim3$. If confirmed with follow-up observations, HZTDE-1 would represent the highest-redshift TDE discovery to date, and would suggest an enhancement of the TDE rate in the high-redshift universe. Our method, which can be applied to future deep surveys with JWST and Roman, offers a pathway to identify TDEs at $z>4$ and probe black hole demographics at early cosmic times.

 - **Abstract**
 The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has provided stellar rotation periods across much of the sky through high-precision light curves, but the reliability and completeness of these measurements require careful evaluation. We assess the accuracy of TESS-derived rotation periods by leveraging a cross-matched sample of ~23,000 stars observed by both TESS and the K2 mission, treating K2 periods as a benchmark. Using causal pixel models to extract light curves and the Lomb-Scargle (LS) periodogram to identify rotation signals, we quantify the empirical uncertainties, reliability, and completeness of TESS rotation period measurements. We find that uncertainties on TESS-derived rotation periods are typically below 3% for stars with periods < 10 days. Rotation periods are generally reliable out to 10 days, with >80% of measurements matching the K2 benchmark. Completeness and reliability drop dramatically for periods beyond ~12 days due to the 27-day sector limitation. Stricter cuts on TESS magnitude and LS power improve reliability; the highest LS power tested (>0.2) ensures >90% reliability below 10 days but removes over half of potential detections. Stitching consecutive-sector light curves reduces period uncertainties but does not improve overall reliability or completeness due to persistent systematics. Our findings and code provide a framework for interpreting TESS-derived rotation periods and inform the selection of quality cuts to optimize studies of stellar rotation, young associations, and gyrochronology.
#### Revealing the Accretion Flow in M87*: Insights from Faraday Rotation

 - **Abstract**
 The Faraday rotation measure (RM) is a commonly used tool to trace electron number density and magnetic fields in hot accretion flows, particularly in low-luminosity accreting supermassive black holes. We focus on the nuclear region of M87, which was observed at 230 GHz (1.3 mm) by the Event Horizon Telescope in 2019. It remains unclear whether this emission originates from the accretion flow, the jet base, or both. To probe the presence of an accretion flow, we explore the scenario where the linearly polarized emission from the counter-jet, visible at 43 GHz (7 mm), is Faraday-rotated by the accretion flow. We calculate theoretical predictions for counter-jet polarization using analytical and numerical models. In all cases, we find a Faraday-thick flow at 43 GHz (7 mm), with $\mathrm{RM} \sim 10^6$ rad m$^{-2}$, and a polarization angle that follows a linear relationship with wavelength squared, consistent with external Faraday rotation. The more realistic model, which includes turbulence and magnetic field fluctuations, predicts that the polarization pattern should be time-dependent, and that the counter-jet emission is depolarized due to Faraday depth fluctuations across the accretion flow. Despite the Faraday thick regime and strong depolarization, the linear relationship persists, enabling us to constrain the flow's physical properties. Comparing the counter-jet and forward-jet linear polarization states should enable detection of M87's accretion flow and provide lower limits on electron density, magnetic field strength, and mass accretion rate.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy clusters provide a unique environment to study galaxy evolution. The role of cluster dynamical states in shaping the physical and morphological properties of member galaxies remains an open question. We aim to assess the impact of the dynamical state of massive ($M_{500} \geq 1.5 \times 10^{14} M_{\odot}$) galaxy clusters on the physical and structural properties of their member galaxies, and also in their fundamental relations in the redshift range $0.10 < z < 0.35$. We use a mass-matched sample of galaxies from relaxed and disturbed clusters. Morphological types are assigned using both parametric and non-parametric methods, while physical properties are derived through SED fitting. Galaxies are further divided into subpopulations to investigate trends with cluster dynamical states. The dynamical state of galaxy clusters does not alter their fundamental relations at low redshift (such as color-magnitude, mass-size, morphology-density, and SF-density relations), nor does it significantly affect the mean or dispersion of galaxy properties. However, it does impact the distributions at the level of third and fourth order moments, introducing asymmetries and heavier tails in the properties of galaxies. The greatest effects are observed in low-mass and red sequence galaxies. These findings suggest that, at low redshift, the fundamental relations of massive galaxy clusters are already well-established and resilient to recent dynamical activity. Nonetheless, the influence of the dynamical state on the higher-order moments of galaxy properties indicates that environmental processes associated with disturbed clusters still leave measurable imprints, particularly on low-mass and red sequence galaxies. This is consistent with the idea that galaxy evolution is shaped both by early pre-processing and by subsequent interactions within dynamically active environments.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the cosmological evolution of the luminosity and redshift of FRBs. As is the case for all extragalactic sources, we are dealing with data that are truncated by observational selection effects, the most important being the flux limit, which introduces the so-called Eddington-Malmquist bias. In addition, for FRBs, there is a significant uncertainty in the redshifts obtained from the observed dispersion measures. To correct for the truncation we use the non-parametric, non-binning Efron- Petrosian and Lynden-Bell methods, which give unbiased distributions of luminosities and redshifts and their cosmological evolution. To quantify the redshift uncertainty, we use a data set, which in addition to a mean redshift, gives the one-sigma errors. We construct three samples with lower, mean, and upper redshifts and apply the above methods to each. For the three samples, we find similar (1) > 2.5{\sigma} evidence for luminosity evolution, (2) a luminosity function that can be fit by a simple broken power law, and (3) a comoving density formation rate that decreases rapidly with redshift unlike the cosmic star formation rate (SFR). This rate is similar to that of short gamma-ray bursts, which are believed to result from compact star mergers with a formation rate delayed relative to the SFR. This may further support the hypothesis that magnetars are the progenitors of FRBs.

 - **Abstract**
 Nowadays, one of the well-known serious challenges in cosmology is the Hubble tension, namely the discrepancy between the Hubble constants from the local observation of Type Ia supernova (SNIa) and the high-$z$ observation of cosmic microwave background (CMB). Here, we are interested in alleviating the Hubble tension with a local void. The key idea is assuming that we live in a locally underdense void, where one will feel a faster expansion rate compared to the cosmic average. In the literature, it was found that a local void cannot satisfyingly alleviate the Hubble tension, since it is not preferred over the $\Lambda$CDM model by the observations such as the Pantheon SNIa sample, especially in terms of the information criteria AIC and BIC. In the present work, we try to alleviate the Hubble tension with a local void and transitions of the absolute magnitude $M$, by using the Pantheon+ SNIa sample alone or jointly with the CMB data of Planck 2018. We find that the Hubble tension can be satisfyingly alleviated, while the $\Lambda$LTB void models are strongly preferred by the observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Large-amplitude inversions of the solar wind's interplanetary magnetic field have long been documented; however, observations from the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) mission have renewed interest in this phenomenon as such features, often termed switchbacks, may constrain both the sources of the solar wind as well as in-situ nonlinear dynamics and turbulent heating. Aims. We aim to show that magnetic field fluctuations in the solar wind are consistent with Alfvénic fluctuations that naturally form switchback inversions in the magnetic field through expansion effects. Methods. We examine PSP observations of the evolution of a single stream of solar wind in a radial scan from PSP's tenth perihelion encounter from approximately 15-50 solar radii. We study the growth and radial scaling of normalized fluctuation amplitudes in the magnetic field, $\delta B/B$, within the framework of spherical polarization. We compare heating rates computed via outer-scale decay from consideration of wave-action to proton heating rates empirically observed through considering adiabatic expansion. Results. We find that the magnetic field fluctuations are largely spherically polarized and that the normalized amplitudes of the magnetic field, $\delta B/B$, increases with amplitude. The growth of the magnetic field amplitude leads to switchback inversions in the magnetic field. While the amplitudes do not grow as fast as predicted by the conservation of wave action, the deviation from the expected scaling yields an effective heating rate, which is close to the empirically observed proton heating rate. Conclusions. The observed scaling of fluctuation amplitudes is largely consistent with a picture of expanding Alfvén waves that seed turbulence leading to dissipation. The expansion of the waves leads to the growth of wave-amplitudes, resulting in the formation of switchbacks.

 - **Abstract**
 Surface brightness-colour relations (SBCRs) are widely used to determine the angular diameters of stars. They are in particular used in the Baade-Wesselink (BW) method of distance determination of Cepheids. However, the impact of the SBCR on the BW distance of Cepheids is about 8%, depending on the choice of SBCR considered in the literature. We aim to calibrate a precise SBCR dedicated to Cepheids using the best quality interferometric measurements available as well as different photometric bands, including the Gaia bands. We selected interferometric and photometric data in the literature for seven Cepheids covering different pulsation periods. From the phased photometry in the different bands (VJHKG$\mathrm{G_{BP}G_{RP}}$) corrected from extinction and the interferometric limb-darkened angular diameters, we calculated the SBCR associated with each combination of colours. We first find that the seven Cepheids have consistent SBCRs as long as the two magnitudes considered are not too close in wavelengths. For the SBCR ($\mathrm{F_{V},V-K}$): $\mathrm{F_{V} = -0.1336_{\pm 0.0009}(V-K)_{0}+3.9572_{\pm 0.0015}}$, we obtain a root mean square (RMS) of 0.0040 mag, which is three times lower than the latest estimate from 2004. Also, for the first time, we present an SBCR dedicated to Cepheids based on Gaia bands only: $\mathrm{F_{G_{BP}} = -0.3001_{\pm 0.0030}(G_{BP}-G_{RP})_{0}+3.9977_{\pm 0.0029}}$, with an excellent RMS of 0.0061 mag. However, using theoretical models, we show that this SBCR is highly sensitive to metallicity. From this empirical multi-wavelength approach, we also show that the impact of the CircumStellar Environment (CSE) of Cepheids emission is not negligible and should be taken into account in the future.

 - **Abstract**
 Redshift drift effect, an observational probe that indenpendent of cosmological models, presents unique applications in specific cosmological epoch. By quantifying redshift drift signal , researchers can determine the rate of the Universe's accelerated expansion and impose constraints on cosmological models and parameters. This study evaluates the precision in cosmological parameters estimation derived from this signal via HI 21cm signal, that observed by the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) telescope, with spectral resolutions of 0.001 Hz and 0.002 Hz over an observational period of $\Delta T = 0.5$ year, utilizing two established techniques: the canonical redshift drift and the differential redshift drift method. The primary objective of this project is to ascertain the rate of cosmic acceleration and establish a solid foundation for real-time cosmology. The results reveal that both the two methods impose highly precise constraints on cosmological parameters, with accuracy reaching the level of millimeter per second (mm/s) or better. However, the canonical method provides relatively less stringent compared to the differential approach. Furthermore, when solely constraining the matter density parameter $\Omega_m$, the strategy can be adapted to the canonical method. Nonetheless, the differential method exhibits clear advantages when simultaneously constraining the matter density parameter $\Omega_m$ and the equation of state of dark energy. These findings validate SKA's capability in detecting redshift drift and refining observational cosmology and indicates the effect can offer superior diagnostic capabilities compared to other techniques, provided that appropriate observational equipment or sufficient observational time is employed.

 - **Abstract**
 Supermassive black hole mergers with spin-flips accelerate energetic particles through their precessing relativistic jets, producing high energy neutrinos and finally gravitational waves. In star formation massive stars come in pairs, triplets and quadruplets, allowing second generation mergers of the remnants with discrepant spin directions. The Gravitational Wave (GW) data support such a scenario. Earlier we suggested that stellar mass black hole mergers (visible in M82) with an associated spin-flip analogously allow the acceleration of energetic particles, with ensuing high energy neutrinos and high energy photons, and finally producing gravitational waves. At cosmic distances only the gravitational waves and the neutrinos remain detectable. Here we generalize the argument to starburst and normal galaxies throughout their cosmic evolution, and show that these galaxies may dominate over Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in the flux of ultra-high energy particles observed at Earth. All these sources contribute to the cosmic neutrino background, as well as the gravitational wave background (they detected the lower frequencies). We outline a search strategy to find such episodic sources, which requires to include both luminosity and flux density.
#### Study of Solar Energetic Particles: their Source Regions, Flares and CMEs during Solar Cycles 23-24

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we examine the association between solar active regions and 152 solar flares, coronal mass ejections, and solar energetic particle (SEP) events over solar cycles 23-24 (1997-2017). The CDAW center's GOES data in the energy channel >10 MeV (Major SEPs; solar proton events) with flux >= 10 pfu was used for our investigation. For the associated activities, we have analyzed the data from space born satellites namely: SOHO/LASCO and SDO/AIA. We found a moderate correlation (55 %) between SXR flux and sunspot area i.e., active regions with larger sunspot areas generally generate larger flares. We found that most of the SEPs are originated from the magnetically complex active regions i.e., hale class beta-gamma-delta and beta. Very few events were associated with unipolar active regions. Stronger GOES X-ray is linked to more impulsive events, as evidenced by the negative correlation (-0.40) between X-ray flux and SEP duration. In the active region beta-gamma-delta, the highest average SEP intensity (2051 pfu) was detected. In the data set used, only 10 % SEPs are found impulsive in nature, while the remaining 90 % are gradual in nature. All the impulsive events had SEP intensity less than 100 pfu and most of the CMEs associated with these events were decelerated CMEs. We discovered that the majority of faster CMEs are linked to the most complex magnetic active regions. This indicates that high speed CMEs are produced by magnetically complex active regions. We discovered that 58 SEP events in our data set are linked to accelerated CMEs, while 82 are linked to decelerated CMEs. The highest average CME width is found corresponding to magnetically most complex active regions beta-delta, gamma-delta, alpha-gamma-delta and beta-gamma-delta, which shows that large CMEs are the consequences of magnetically complex active regions.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on a detailed study of a luminous, heavily obscured ($N_{\rm H} \sim 2 \times 10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$), radio-loud quasar SRGAJ230631.0+155633, discovered in the 4--12 keV energy band by the Mikhail Pavlinsky ART-XC telescope aboard the SRG observatory during the first two years of its all-sky X-ray survey in 2020--2021. The object is located at $z=0.4389$ and is a type 2 AGN according to optical spectroscopy (SDSS, confirmed by DESI). Our analysis combines data from the radio to the X-ray energy range, including quasi-simultaneous pointed observations with the SRG/ART-XC and Swift/XRT telescopes, conducted in June 2023. During these follow-up observations, the source was found in a significantly fainter but still very luminous state ($L_{\rm X}=1.0^{+0.8}_{-0.3} \times 10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$, absorption corrected, 2--10 keV) compared to its discovery during the all-sky survey ($L_{\rm X}=6^{+6}_{-3}\times10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$), which indicates significant intrinsic variability on a rest-frame time scale of $\sim 1$ year. The radio data show a complex morphology with a core and two extended radio lobes, indicating a giant FRII radio galaxy. Using multiwavelength photometry and the black hole--bulge mass scaling relation, we estimate the bolometric luminosity of the quasar at $\sim 6\times 10^{46}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and the mass of its central black hole at $\sim 1.4 \times 10^9$ $M_\odot$. This implies that the black hole is accreting at $\sim 30$ of the Eddington limit. Overall, SRGAJ230631.0+155633 proves to be one of the most luminous obscured quasars in the observable Universe out to $z=0.5$ (i.e. over the last 5 billion years of cosmic time). As such, it can serve as a valuable testbed for in-depth exploration of the physics of such objects, which were much more abundant in the younger Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent studies suggest that numerous intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) may wander undetected across the Universe, emitting little radiation. These IMBHs largely preserve their birth masses, offering critical insights into the formation of heavy black hole seeds and the dynamical processes driving their evolution. We propose that such IMBHs could produce detectable microlensing effects on quasars. Their Einstein radii, comparable to the scale of quasar broad-line regions, magnify radiation from the accretion disk and broad emission lines, making these quasars outliers in flux scaling relations. Meanwhile, the microlensing causes long-term, quasi-linear variability that is distinguishable from the stochastic variability of quasars through its coherent multi-wavelength behavior. We develop a matched-filtering technique that effectively separates the long-term lensing signal from the intrinsic quasar variability, with sensitivity tripling each time the observational time span doubles. Moreover, as IMBHs are often surrounded by dense star clusters, their combined gravitational field produces substantial extended, concentric caustics. These caustics induce significant variability in optical, ultraviolet, and X-ray bands over decade timescales, alongside hour-to-day-scale flux fluctuations in broad emission lines. We predict a substantial number of detectable events in the upcoming surveys by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, considering recent IMBH mass density estimates. Even in the absence of positive detections, searches for these microlensing signals will place meaningful constraints on the cosmological mass density of IMBHs, advancing our understanding of their role in cosmic evolution.
#### Molecular Clouds at the Edge of the Galaxy I. Variation of CO J=2-1/1-0 Line Ratio

 - **Abstract**
 The Galactic edge at Galactocentric distances of 14\,--\,22\,kpc provides an ideal laboratory to study molecular clouds in an environment that is different from the solar neighborhood, due to its lower gas density, lower metallicity, and little or no perturbation from the spiral arms. Observations of CO\,($J$\,=\,2--1) spectral lines were carried out towards 72 molecular clouds located at the Galactic edge using the IRAM\,30\,m telescope. Combined with CO\,($J$\,=\,1--0) data from the MWISP project, we investigate the variations of $R_{21}$ across these Galactic edge clouds, with $R_{21}$ representing CO(2-1)/CO(1-0) integrated intensity ratios. These are found to range from 0.3 to 3.0 with a mean of 1.0\,$\pm$\,0.1 in the Galactic edge clouds. The proportions of very low ratio gas (VLRG; $R_{21}$\,<\,0.4), low ratio gas (LRG; 0.4\,$\le$\,$R_{21}$\,<\,0.7), high ratio gas (HRG; 0.7\,$\le$\,$R_{21}$\,<\,1.0), and very high ratio gas (VHRG; $R_{21}$\,$\ge$\,1.0) are 6.9\%, 29.2\%, 26.4\%, and 37.5\%, respectively, indicating a significant presence of high $R_{21}$ ratio molecular gas within these regions. In our Galaxy, the $R_{21}$ ratio exhibits a gradient of initial radial decline followed by a high dispersion with increasing Galacticentric distance and a prevalence for high ratio gas. There is no apparent systematic variation within the Galactocentric distance range of 14 to 22\,kpc. A substantial proportion of HRG and VHRG is found to be associated with compact clouds and regions displaying star-forming activity, suggesting that the high $R_{21}$ ratios may stem from dense gas concentrations and recent episodes of star formation.
