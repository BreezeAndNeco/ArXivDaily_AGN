 - **Abstract**
 Sunspots are areas of strong magnetic fields driven by a convective dynamo. Rudolf Wolf devised his Sunspot Number (SN) series to describe its variation with time. Most other solar phenomena vary in concert with SN, in particular the microwave radiation. During the interval 2014-Jul to 2015-Dec, the variation of the SN with the microwave flux (e.g. F10.7) was anomalous, although microwave flux did not exhibit any anomaly with respect to the solar magnetic field measured by the HMI instrument on the SDO spacecraft. This points to a possible problem with the derivation of the SN using the 148,714 reports of sunspot observations received by the World Data Center Solar Influences (SIDC/SILSO at ROB) since 2011 (when the last public raw data was released). The unavailability of the raw data since then, contrary to avowed open data policy of ROB, prevents independent assessment and possible correction of the anomaly. We urge ROB to make the raw data available.

 - **Abstract**
 X-ray binaries (XRBs) display spectral state transitions that are accompanied by substantial changes in the hardness, luminosity, and structure of the accretion flow. We developed a GPU-accelerated cooling toolkit for general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of accreting black holes that uses texture memory for fast retrieval of pre-computed values. The toolkit incorporates bremsstrahlung, synchrotron, inverse Compton radiation and Coulomb collision processes. We implemented our toolkit into a GRMHD code and used it to simulate a magnetically arrested disk in the context of the XRB low/hard state around a Kerr black hole. We explored the mass accretion rate in the $\sim (10^{-6}-0.3) \dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$ range, where $\dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$ is the Eddington accretion rate. Our simulations reveal that for low accretion rates ($\dot{M} \lesssim 0.01 \dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$), the flow settles into a geometrically thick, low-density, two-temperature hot accretion flow. At higher accretion rates, the flow turns into a cold single-temperature thin disk at $r_{\rm in} \gtrsim 50 r_g$. Inside, the disk breaks up into single-temperature thin filaments embedded into a two-temperature hot thick flow. Our GPU texture memory accelerated cooling prescription is $3-5$ times faster than the standard radiation M1 closure methods, and $\sim5$ times faster than storing the lookup table in global memory.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we report on three of the largest (in terms of simulation domain size) and longest (in terms of duration) 3D general relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations of super-critical accretion onto black holes. The simulations are all set for a rapidly rotating ($a_* = 0.9$), stellar-mass ($M_\mathrm{BH} = 6.62 M_\odot$) black hole. The simulations vary in their initial target mass accretion rates (assumed measured at large radius), with values sampled in the range $\dot{m}=\dot{M}/\dot{M}_\mathrm{Edd} = 1-10$. We find in practice, though, that all of our simulations settle close to a net accretion rate of $\dot{m}_\mathrm{net} = \dot{m}_\mathrm{in}-\dot{m}_\mathrm{out} \approx 1$ (over the radii where our simulations have reached equilibrium), even though the inward mass flux (measured at large radii) $\dot{m}_\mathrm{in}$ can exceed 1,000 in some cases. This is possible because the outflowing mass flux $\dot{m}_\mathrm{out}$ adjusts itself to very nearly cancel out $\dot{m}_\mathrm{in}$, so that at all radii $\dot{M}_\mathrm{net} \approx \dot{M}_\mathrm{Edd}$. In other words, these simulated discs obey the Eddington limit. We compare our results with the predictions of the slim disc (advection-dominated) and critical disc (wind/outflow-dominated) models, finding that they agree quite well with the critical disc model both qualitatively and quantitatively. We also speculate as to why our results appear to contradict most previous numerical studies of super-critical accretion.
#### A fundamental limit to how close binary systems can get via stable mass transfer shapes the properties of binary black hole mergers

 - **Abstract**
 Mass transfer in binary systems is the key process in the formation of various classes of objects, including merging binary black holes (BBHs) and neutron stars. Orbital evolution during mass transfer depends on how much mass is accreted and how much angular momentum is lost $-$ two of the main uncertainties in binary evolution. Here, we demonstrate that there is a fundamental limit to how close binary systems can get via stable mass transfer (SMT), that is robust against uncertainties in orbital evolution. Based on detailed evolutionary models of interacting systems with a BH accretor and a massive star companion, we show that the post-interaction orbit is always wider than $\sim10R_{\odot}$, even when extreme shrinkage due to L2 outflows is assumed. Systems evolving towards tighter orbits become dynamically unstable and result in stellar mergers. This separation limit has direct implications for the properties of BBH mergers: long delay times ($\gtrsim1 \rm Gyr$), and no high BH spins from the tidal spin-up of helium stars. At high metallicity, the SMT channel may be severely quenched due to Wolf-Rayet winds. The reason for the separation limit lies in the stellar structure, not in binary physics. If the orbit gets too narrow during mass transfer, a dynamical instability is triggered by a rapid expansion of the remaining donor envelope due to its near-flat entropy profile. The closest separations can be achieved from core-He burning ($\sim8-15R_{\odot}$) and Main Sequence donors ($\sim15-30R_{\odot}$), while Hertzsprung Gap donors lead to wider orbits ($\gtrsim30-50R_{\odot}$) and non-merging BBHs. These outcomes and mass transfer stability are determined by the entropy structures, which are governed by internal composition profiles. The formation of compact binaries is thus sensitive to chemical mixing in stars and may relate to the blue-supergiant problem.

 - **Abstract**
 Dwarf galaxies are uniquely sensitive to energetic feedback processes and are known to experience substantial mass and metal loss from their disk. Here, we investigate the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of 64 isolated dwarf galaxies ($6.0<$log(M$_*/M_{\odot}$)$<9.5$) at $z=0$ from the Marvel-ous Dwarfs and Marvelous Massive Dwarfs hydrodynamic simulations. Our galaxies produce column densities broadly consistent with current observations. We investigate these column densities in the context of mass and metal retention rates and the physical properties of the CGM. We find $48\pm11\%$ of all baryons within $R_{200c}$ reside in the CGM, with $\sim70\%$ of CGM mass existing in a warm gas phase, $10^{4.5}<T<10^{5.5}$ K that dominates beyond $r/R_{200c}\sim0.5$. Further, the warm and cool ($10^{4.0}<T<10^{4.5}$ K) gas phases each retain $5-10\%$ of metals formed by the dwarf galaxy. The significant fraction of mass and metals residing in the warm CGM phase provides an interpretation for the lack of observed low ion detections beyond $b/R_{200c}\sim0.5$ at $z\sim0$. We find a weak correlation between galaxy mass and total CGM metal retention despite the fraction of metals lost from the halo increasing from $\sim10\%$ to $>40\%$ towards lower masses. Our findings highlight the CGM (primarily its warm component) as a key reservoir of mass and metals for dwarf galaxies across stellar masses and underscore its importance in understanding the baryon cycle in the low-mass regime. Finally, we provide individual galaxy properties of our full sample and quantify the fraction of ultraviolet observable mass to support future observational programs, particularly those aimed at performing a metal budget around dwarf galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are a key ingredient in galaxy evolution, possibly shaping galaxy growth through the generation of powerful outflows. Little is known regarding AGN-driven ionized outflows in moderate-luminosity AGN (logLbol[erg/s]<47) beyond cosmic noon (z>3). We present the first systematic analysis of the ionized outflow properties of a sample of X-ray-selected AGN (logLx[erg/s]>44) from the COSMOS-Legacy field at z~3.5 and with logLbol[erg/s]=45.2-46.7, by using JWST NIRSpec/IFU spectroscopic observations as part of the GA-NIFS program. We spectrally isolate and spatially resolve the ionized outflows, by performing a multi-component kinematic decomposition of the rest-frame optical emission lines. JWST/NIRSpec IFU data also revealed a wealth of close-by companions, of both non-AGN and AGN nature, and ionized gas streams likely tracing tidal structures and large-scale ionized gas nebulae, extending up to the circum-galactic medium. Ionized outflows are detected in all COS-AGN targets, which we compare with previous results from the literature up to z~3, opportunely (re-)computed for a coherent comparison. We normalize outflow energetics ($\dot{M}_{out}$, $\dot{E}_{out}$) to the outflow density to standardize the various assumptions that were made in the literature. Our choice is equal to assuming that each outflow has the same gas density. We find GA-NIFS AGN to show outflows consistent with literature results, within the large scatter shown by the collected measurements, suggesting no strong evolution with redshift in terms of total mass outflow rate, energy budget and outflow velocity for fixed bolometric luminosity. Moreover, we find no clear redshift evolution of the ratio of mass outflow rate and kinetic power over AGN bolometric luminosity beyond z>1. In general, our results indicate no significant evolution of the physics driving outflows beyond z~3. [abridged]

 - **Abstract**
 Bright-rimmed, cometary-shaped star-forming globules, associated with HII regions, are remnants of compressed molecular shells exposed to ultraviolet radiation from central OB-type stars. The interplay between dense molecular gas and ionizing radiation, analysed through gas kinematics, provides significant insights into the nature and dynamic evolution of these globules. This study presents the results of a kinematic analysis of the cometary globule, Lynds Bright Nebula (LBN) 437, focusing on the first rotational transition of 12CO and C18O molecular lines observed using the Taeduk Radio Astronomy Observatory (TRAO). The averaged 12CO spectrum shows a slightly skewed profile, suggesting the possibility of a contracting cloud. The molecular gas kinematics reveals signatures of infalling gas in the cometary head of LBN 437, indicating the initial stages of star formation. The mean infall velocity and mass infall rate towards the cometary head of LBN 437 are 0.25 km s^-1 and 5.08 * 10^-1 Msun yr^-1 respectively, which align well with the previous studies on intermediate or high-mass star formation.
#### Dynamically-Driven Evolution of Molecular Gas in M83 Traced by CO 2-1/1-0 Line Ratio Variations

 - **Abstract**
 We show the variations of the CO J=2-1/1-0 line ratio (R21) across the barred spiral galaxy M83, using the 46 pc resolution data from ALMA. The R21 map clearly evidences the systematic large-scale variations as a function of galactic structures. Azimuthally, it starts from low R21<~0.7 in the interarm regions and becomes high ~>0.7 in the bar and spiral arms, suggesting that the density and/or kinetic temperature of molecular gas increase by about a factor of 2-3. This evolution is seen even in the parts of spiral arms without star formation, and R21 is often elevated even higher to ~0.8-1.0 when HII regions exist in the vicinity. Radially, R21 starts very high >~1.0 at the galactic center, remains low <~0.7 in the bar region, increases to >~0.7 around the bar end, and again decreases to <~0.7 in the rest of disk where the spiral arms dominate. The evolutionary sequence is synchronized with galactic rotation, and therefore, it is determined largely by the galactic structures and dynamics and is governed by the galactic rotation timescales. The R21 map also shows that the influence of stellar feedback is localized and limited. Massive, large, and non-star forming molecular structures have low R21, which also suggests that the bulk molecular gas in the disk is not regulated by stellar feedback, but more likely by galactic structures and dynamics. These results are consistent with suggestions by the earlier studies of the Milky Way and other barred spiral galaxies, and thus, are likely general among barred spiral galaxies in the local Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Green Pea galaxies are a class of compact, low-mass, low-metallicity star-forming galaxies in the relatively local universe. They are believed to be analogues of high-redshift galaxies that re-ionised the universe and, indeed, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is now uncovering such populations at record redshifts. Intriguingly, JWST finds evidence suggestive of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in many of these distant galaxies, including the elusive Little Red Dots, that broadly lack any detectable X-ray counterparts. Intuitively, one would expect to detect an AGN in their low-redshift analogues with X-rays, yet no study to date has conclusively identified an X-ray AGN within a Green Pea galaxy. Here we present the deepest X-ray campaign of a Green Pea galaxy performed to date, obtained with the goal of discerning the presence of a (potentially low-luminosity) AGN. The target $-$ SDSS J082247.66 +224144.0 (J0822+2241 hereafter) $-$ was previously found to display a comparable X-ray spectral shape to more local AGN ($\Gamma$ $\sim$ 2) and a high luminosity ($L_{2-10\,{\rm keV}}$ $\sim$ 10$^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$). We show that over 6.2 years (rest-frame), the 2$-$10 keV luminosity of J0822+2241 is constant, whereas the soft 0.5$-$2 keV flux has decreased significantly by $\sim$60%. We discuss possible scenarios to explain the X-ray properties of J0822+2241, finding transient low-column density obscuration surrounding an AGN to be the only plausible scenario. J0822+2241 thus provides further evidence that low-luminosity AGN activity could have contributed to the epoch of reionisation, and that local analogues are useful to derive a complete multi-wavelength picture of black hole growth in high redshift low luminosity AGN.
#### Suppression of Shock X-ray Emission in Novae from Turbulent Mixing with Cool Gas

 - **Abstract**
 Shock interaction in classical novae occurs when a fast outflow from the white dwarf > 1000 km s/s collides with a slower, cooler shell of gas released earlier in the outburst. The shocks radiate across the electromagnetic spectrum, from radio synchrotron to GeV gamma-rays. The hot shocked gas also emits >~ keV thermal X-rays, typically peaking weeks after the eruption, once the ejecta becomes transparent to photoelectric absorption. However, the observed hard X-ray luminosities are typically >4 orders of magnitude smaller than would be naively expected given the powerful shocks implied by the gamma-rays. We argue that a key missing piece to this puzzle is turbulence behind the shock, driven, e.g., by thin-shell and/or thermal instabilities. Turbulence efficiently mixes the hot X-ray emitting gas with cooler gas, sapping the hot gas of energy faster than it can directly radiate. Using analytic arguments motivated by numerical simulations, we show that energy losses due to turbulent mixing can easily balance shock heating, greatly reducing the volume of the hot gas and suppressing the X-ray luminosity. Equating the characteristic thickness of the X-ray emitting region to the minimum outer length scale of the turbulence capable of cooling the hot gas through mixing, we obtain X-ray luminosities consistent with nova observations if only ~1% of the shock's kinetic power goes into turbulent motions. A similar process may act to suppress thermal X-rays from other shock powered transients, such as interacting supernovae.

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of extensive air showers (EAS) induced by cosmic rays via radio signals has undergone significant advancements in the last two decades. Numerous ultra-high energy cosmic ray experiments routinely capture radio pulses in the MHz to GHz frequency range emitted by EAS. The Monte Carlo simulation of these radio pulses is crucial to enable an accurate reconstruction of the primary cosmic ray energy and to infer the composition of the primary particles. In this work, a comprehensive comparison of the predicted electric field in EAS simulated with CoREAS and ZHAireS was conducted to estimate the systematic uncertainties arising from the use of different simulation packages in the determination of two key shower observables namely, the electromagnetic energy of the EAS and the depth of maximum development ($X_{\rm max}$). For this comparison, input parameters and settings as similar as possible were used in both simulations, along with the same realistic atmospheric refractive index depending on altitude, which is crucial for the prediction of radio emission properties of EAS. In addition, simulated EAS with very similar values of depth of maximum development were selected. Good agreement was found between CoREAS and ZHAireS, with discrepancies in the dominant electric field components generally remaining below $10\%$ across the frequency range of a few MHz to hundreds of MHz, relevant for most radio detection experiments, translating into uncertainties in the determination of energy below $5\%$ and $\simeq 10\,\mathrm{g/cm^2}$ in $X_{\rm max}$.

 - **Abstract**
 High-resolution spectroscopy (HRS) has grown into one of the main techniques to characterise the atmospheres of extrasolar planets. High spectral resolving power allows for the efficient removal of telluric and host-star contamination. Combined with the large collecting area of ground-based telescopes it enables detailed studies of atmospheric species, temperature structure, atmospheric loss, and global winds and circulation patterns. In this review, the wide range of HRS observation and data-analysis techniques are described and literature results discussed. Key findings include: * The highest irradiated planets show a rich spectrum of atomic and ionic species, just like stars. * Retrieval analyses of Hot Jupiters and directly imaged Super- Jupiters point to Solar metallicities and chemistry, but observed samples are still heterogeneous and incomplete. * There appears to be a clear dichotomy between Hot Jupiters with and without atmospheric inversions, depending on their equilibrium temperature. * Some highly irradiated planets exhibit enormous leading and/or trailing tails of helium gas, providing unique insights into planet evolution and atmospheric escape processes. * Minor isotopes of carbon and oxygen are now being detected in gas giant planets and brown dwarfs with the interesting potential to shed light on formation pathways. A list of potential pitfalls is provided for those new to the field, and synergies with JWST are discussed. HRS has a great future ahead with the advent of the extremely large telescopes, promising to bring temperate rocky exoplanets into view with their increase in HRS detection speed of up to three orders of magnitude.
#### On the X-ray Emission From Supernovae, and Implications for the Mass-Loss Rates of their Progenitor Stars

 - **Abstract**
 We summarize the X-ray emission from young SNe. Having accumulated data on most observed X-ray SNe, we display the X-ray lightcurves of young SNe. We also explore the X-ray spectra of various SN types. The X-ray emission from Type Ib/c SNe is non-thermal. It is also likely that the emission from Type IIP SNe with low mass-loss rates (around 10$^{-7} \, Msun \,$ yr$^{-1}$) is non-thermal. As the mass-loss rate increases, thermal emission begins to dominate. Type IIn SNe have the highest X-ray luminosities, and are clearly thermal. We do not find evidence of non-thermal emission from Type IIb SNe. The aggregated data are used to obtain approximate mass-loss rates of the progenitor stars of these SNe. Type IIP's have progenitors with mass-loss rates $< 10^{-5}\, Msun \,$ yr$^{-1}$, while Type IIn progenitors generally have mass-loss rates $> 10^{-3}\, Msun $ yr$^{-1}$. However, we emphasize that the density of the ambient medium is the important parameter, and if it is due to a non-steady outflow solution, it can not be translated into a mass-loss rate.
#### Investigation of possible precursors of solar flares in the active region 12230 On December 9, 2014

 - **Abstract**
 The question of the nature of precursors of solar flares, as well as their relationship with subsequent flares, still has no unambiguous answer. This is due, in particular, to the lack of systematic statistical work, the relative incompleteness (in isolation from the context of the development of the entire active region) of studies of individual events and the ambiguity of the term 'precursor' itself. In this paper, we consider the dynamics of the NOAA 12230 active region (AR), in which a series of homologous flares (C5-C9) occurred on December 9, 2014 within 12 hours, with an average frequency of about 2 hours. This AR was characterized by a rapid increase in flare activity followed by a rapid decay, which can be considered as a good example for studying potential precursors of flare series. We investigated the evolution of AR 12230 over a relatively long period (several days) and its transition from the 'no-flare' state to the flare-active regime. For this purpose, we study the magnetic field dynamics using SDO/HMI vector magnetograms, UV-EUV images based on SDO/AIA data, and X-ray observations from GOES/XRS and RHESSI data. We conclude that the significant increase in the chromospheric radiation variations against the background of a small flux of soft X-ray and UV emission from the corona observed on December 8, 2014, together with the magnetic flux emergence, can be considered as a precursor to a series of flares. The results show the importance and prospects of applying new methods of synoptic observations of the Sun in the context of collecting statistics ("history") of the AR energy release in different ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum.
#### Observational study of the formation of homologous confined circular-ribbon flares

 - **Abstract**
 When several solar flares with comparable classes occur successively at the same location and exhibit similar morphological features, they are called homologous flares. During 2012 May 8-10, five M-class homologous circular-ribbon flares associated with no coronal mass ejection occurred in active region (AR) 11476. The formation process of these homologous confined flares, particularly the homologous aspect, is unclear and inconclusive. This paper is dedicated to studying how the energy for this series of flares was accumulated and whether there existed null points responsible for the flare energy release. Before and during the five flares, the sunspots with opposite polarities sheared against each other and also rotated individually. Before each flare, the magnetic fields at the polarity inversion line were highly sheared and there existed a magnetic flux rope overlain by arch-shaped loops. For the first four flares, we find magnetic null points in the fan-spine topology, situated at about 3.8 Mm, 5.7 Mm, 3.4 Mm, and 2.6 Mm above the photosphere, respectively. For the fifth flare, no null point is detected. However, in the (extreme-)ultraviolet images, the evolution behaviors of all the flares were almost identical. Therefore, we speculate that a null point responsible for the occurrence of the fifth flare may have existed. These results reveal that, for these homologous flares in AR 11476, the sunspot rotation and shearing motion play important roles in energy accumulation, the null point of the fan-spine topology is crucial for energy release through magnetic reconnection therein, and large-scale magnetic loops prevent the erupting material from escaping the Sun, thus forming the observed homologous confined major circular-ribbon flares. This study provides clear evidence for the drivers of successive, homologous flares as well as the nature of confined events.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic massive stars are stars of spectral types O, B and A that harbour $\sim$ kG strength (mostly dipolar) surface magnetic fields. Their non-thermal radio emission has been demonstrated to be an important magnetospheric probe, provided the emission is fully characterised. A necessary step for that is to build a statistically significant sample of radio-bright magnetic massive stars. In this paper, we present the `VAST project to study Magnetic Massive Stars' or VAST-MeMeS that aims to achieve that by taking advantage of survey data acquired with the Australian SKA Pathfinder telescope. VAST-MeMeS is defined under the `VAriable and Slow Transient' (VAST) survey, although it also uses data from other ASKAP surveys. We found radio detections from 48 magnetic massive stars, out of which, 14 do not have any prior radio detections. We also identified 9 `Main-sequence Radio Pulse Emitter' candidates based on variability and circular polarisation of flux densities. The expanded sample suggests a lower efficiency in the radio production than that reported in earlier work. In addition to significantly expanding the sample of radio-bright magnetic massive stars, the addition of flux density measurements at $\lesssim 1$ GHz revealed that the spectra of incoherent radio emission can extend to much lower frequencies than that assumed in the past. In the future, radio observations spanning wide frequency and rotational phase ranges should be conducted so as to reduce the uncertainties in the incoherent radio luminosities. The results from these campaigns, supplemented with precise estimations of stellar parameters, will allow us to fully understand particle acceleration and non-thermal radio production in large-scale stellar magnetospheres.

 - **Abstract**
 Evidence indicates that supermassive black holes exist at the centers of most galaxies. Their mass correlates with the galactic bulge mass, suggesting a co-evolution with their host galaxies, most likely through powerful winds. X-ray observations have detected highly ionized winds outflowing at sub-relativistic speeds from the accretion disks around supermassive black holes. However, the limited spectral resolution of current X-ray instruments has left the physical structure and location of the winds poorly understood, hindering accurate estimates of their kinetic power. Here, the first XRISM observation of the luminous quasar, PDS 456, is reported. The high-resolution spectrometer Resolve onboard XRISM enabled the discovery of five discrete velocity components outflowing at 20-30% of the speed of light. This demonstrates that the wind structure is highly inhomogeneous, which likely consists of up to a million clumps. The mass outflow rate is estimated to be 60-300 solar masses per year, with the wind kinetic power exceeding the Eddington luminosity limit. Compared to the galaxy-scale outflows, the kinetic power is more than 3 orders of magnitude larger, while the momentum flux is 10 times larger. These estimates disfavor both energy- and momentum-driven outflow models. It suggests that such wind activity occurs in less than 10% of the quasar phase and/or that its energy/momentum is not efficiently transferred to the galaxy-scale outflows due to the clumpiness of the wind and the interstellar medium.

 - **Abstract**
 The $S_8$ value inferred from the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Year 3 cosmic shear data, under the assumption of the flat $\Lambda$CDM model, is 2-3$\sigma$ lower than that inferred from observations of the early-time universe, such as cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy data. Resolving the $S_8$ tension requires a scenario in which structure formation on small scales is suppressed in the late universe. As potential solutions, we consider extended models both within and beyond the $\Lambda$CDM model -- models that incorporate parameterized baryonic feedback effects, the effect of varying neutrino mass, and modified structure growth, each of which can lead to a suppression of structure growth at lower redshifts, with its own distinct scale- and redshift-dependencies. In particular, we consider phenomenological modified gravity models in which the suppression of structure growth is triggered at lower redshifts, as dark energy ($\Lambda$) begins to dominate the background expansion. We show that the modified growth factor models -- especially those featuring more rapid growth suppression at lower redshifts -- provide an improved fit to the combined datasets of the HSC-Y3 cosmic shear correlation functions, the Planck CMB, and the ACT DR6 CMB lensing, compared to the fiducial $\Lambda$CDM model and the models including the baryonic effects or the massive neutrino effect within the the $\Lambda$CDM framework.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a JWST and ALMA detailed study of the ISM properties of high-redshift galaxies. Our JWST/NIRSpec IFU spectroscopy targeting three galaxies at $z=6-7$ detects key rest-frame optical emission lines, allowing us to derive [OII]$\lambda\lambda$3726,3729-based electron densities of $n_\mathrm{e,optical}\sim1000$ cm$^{-3}$ on average and [OIII]$\lambda$4363-based metallicities of $\mathrm{12+log(O/H)}=8.0-8.2$ in two galaxies. New ALMA Band 9/10 observations detect the [OIII]52$\mu$m line in one galaxy but do not in the others, resulting in FIR-based densities of $n_\mathrm{e,FIR}\lesssim500$ cm$^{-3}$ from the [OIII]52$\mu$m/[OIII]88$\mu$m ratios, systematically lower than the optical [OII]-based measurements. These low FIR-based densities are comparable to those at both $z\sim0$ and $z>6$ in the literature, including JADES-GS-z14-0 at $z=14.18$, suggesting little evolution up to $z\sim14$, in contrast to the increasing trend of optical-based densities with redshift. By conducting a JWST and ALMA joint analysis using emission lines detected with both telescopes, we find that the observed FIR [OIII]52,88$\mu$m luminosities are too high to be explained by the optical-based densities at which they would be significantly collisionally de-excited. Instead, a 2-zone model with distinct high- and low-density regions is required to reproduce all observed lines, indicating that FIR [OIII] emission arises predominantly from low-density gas, while optical [OIII] and [OII] lines trace both regions. We further demonstrate that the direct-$T_\mathrm{e}$ method can sometimes significantly underestimate metallicities up to 0.8 dex due to the presence of the low-density gas not fully traced by optical lines alone, highlighting the importance of combining optical and FIR lines to accurately determine gas-phase metallicities in the early universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Angular momentum transport by magnetic fields is important for formation and evolution of protoplanetary disks. The effects of magnetic fields are suppressed due to non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effects such as ambipolar diffusion and Ohmic dissipation, which depend on the degree of ionization. Cosmic rays (CRs) are the primary source of ionization in star-forming clouds, and their distribution is nonuniform as it is affected by gas density and magnetic fields. Therefore, CRs, magnetic fields, and gas interact with each other. In this work, we develop a new fully implicit cosmic ray transport module in Athena++ and perform three-dimensional simulations of disk formation from collapse of molecular cloud cores. Since CRs are strongly attenuated in the dense gas at the disk scale, distribution of magnetic fields is considerably altered compared to conventional models assuming a uniform ionization rate. While the total magnetic fluxes accreted onto the disks remain similar as the gas outside the disks remain sufficiently ionized and well coupled, the magnetic fields in the disks are less twisted due to the stronger non-ideal MHD effects. As a consequence, magnetic angular momentum transport is strongly suppressed at the disk scale, resulting in more gravitationally unstable disks with more prominent spiral arms. Our simulations demonstrate influence of non-uniform ionization resulting from CR transport and attenuation on the disk formation and evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Accretion disks around black holes host extreme conditions where general relativity and magnetohydrodynamics dominate. These disks exhibit two distinct dynamical regimes -- Standard and Normal Evolution (SANE) and Magnetically Arrested Disk (MAD). In the MAD regime, these systems exhibit magnetic fields up to $10^8$ G and variability on gravitational timescales $t_g \sim 10^{-4}$ s for stellar-mass black holes. While classical magnetohydrodynamics has been extensively applied, quantum effects in these high-energy environments remain unexplored. Here, we employ quantum field theory in background gauge fields (QFTBGF) to demonstrate that the dynamic magnetic fields of MADs drive significant pair production via the Schwinger mechanism. The resulting pairs emit non-thermal (synchrotron) radiation with a peak frequency tunable across $ \sim 1 - 3000$ MHz, depending on the magnetic field strength (peaking at higher frequencies for stronger fields). For $ B \sim 10^8 $ G, our model predicts a peak spectral flux density of $ \sim 1 - 100$ mJy, detectable with next-generation radio telescopes (e.g., SKA, ngVLA). This work provides a direct and observable signatures of quantum effects in black hole accretion disks.

 - **Abstract**
 The Lyman-$\alpha$ forest opacity fluctuations observed from high redshift quasar spectra have been proven to be extremely successful in order to probe the late phase of the reionization epoch. For ideal modeling of these opacity fluctuations, one of the main challenges is to satisfy the extremely high dynamic range requirements of the simulation box, resolving the Lyman alpha forest while probing the large cosmological scales. In this study, we adopt an efficient approach to model Lyman-$\alpha$ opacity fluctuations in coarse simulation volume, utilizing the semi-numerical reionization model SCRIPT (including inhomogeneous recombination and radiative feedback) integrated with a realistic photoionization background fluctuation generating model. Our model crucially incorporates ionization and temperature fluctuations, which are consistent with the reionization model. After calibrating our method with respect to high-resolution full hydrodynamic simulation, Nyx, we compare the models with available observational data at the redshift range, $z=5.0-6.1$. With a fiducial reionization model (reionization end at $z=5.8$), we demonstrate that the observed scatter in the effective optical depth can be matched reasonably well by tuning the free parameters of our model i.e. the effective ionizing photon mean free path and mean photoionization rate. We further pursue an MCMC-based parameter space exploration utilizing the available data to put constraints on the above free parameters. Our estimation prefers a slightly higher photoionization rate and slightly lower mean free path than the previous studies which is also a consequence of temperature fluctuations. This study holds significant promise for efficiently extracting important physical information about the Epoch of Reionization, utilizing the wealth of available and upcoming observational data.
#### Simulating jet launching in binary neutron star mergers with no artificial atmosphere limitations

 - **Abstract**
 We present general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers, exploring the conditions to launch relativistic outflows compatible with gamma-ray burst (GRB) jets. Employing an unprecedentedly low numerical density floor decreasing as the sixth power of radial distance, we obtain for the first time an evolution where such a floor has no effect on any outflow produced during and after merger. In models forming an accreting black hole (BH) 25 ms after merger, incipient jets are launched with terminal Lorentz factors and Poynting-flux luminosities compatible with GRBs. The rather high jet velocities reached in a few tens of ms, when compared to previous simulations adopting a much higher and uniform density floor, show the importance of removing any influence of the latter as the jet evolves toward increasingly large time and spatial scales. In absence of collapse, we find the emergence of much heavier and slower polar outflows, incapable of producing a GRB. We thus favor a BH origin for GRB jets.

 - **Abstract**
 The abundant population of "Little Red Dots" (LRDs)-compact objects with red UV to optical colors and broad Balmer lines at high redshift-is unveiling new insights into the properties of early active galactic nuclei (AGN). Perhaps the most surprising features of this population are the presence of Balmer absorption and ubiquitous strong Balmer breaks. Recent models link these features to an active supermassive black hole (SMBH) cocooned in very dense gas ($N_{\rm H}\sim10^{24}\,\rm cm^{-2}$). We present a stringent test of such models using VLT/MUSE observations of A2744-45924, the most luminous LRD known to date ($L_{\rm H\alpha}\approx10^{44}~\rm erg\,s^{-1}$), located behind the Abell-2744 lensing cluster at $z=4.464$ ($\mu=1.8$). We detect a moderately extended Ly$\alpha$ nebula ($h\approx5.7$ pkpc), spatially offset from the point-like H$\alpha$ seen by JWST. The Ly$\alpha$ emission is narrow ($\rm FWHM=270\pm 15~km\,s^{-1}$), spatially offset to H$\alpha$, and faint ($\rm Ly\alpha=0.07H\alpha$) compared to Ly$\alpha$ nebulae typically observed around quasars of similar luminosity. We detect compact N$\,$IV]$\lambda$1486 emission, spatially aligned with H$\alpha$, and a spatial shift in the far-UV continuum matching the Ly$\alpha$ offset. We discuss that H$\alpha$ and Ly$\alpha$ have distinct physical origins: H$\alpha$ originates from the AGN, while Ly$\alpha$ is powered by star formation. In the environment of A2744-45924, we identify four extended Ly$\alpha$ halos ($\Delta z<0.02$, $\Delta r<100$ pkpc). Their Ly$\alpha$ luminosities match expectations based on H$\alpha$ emission, indicating no evidence for radiation from A2744-45924 affecting its surroundings. The lack of strong, compact, and broad Ly$\alpha$ and the absence of a luminous extended halo, suggest that the UV AGN light is obscured by dense gas cloaking the SMBH with covering factor close to unity.
