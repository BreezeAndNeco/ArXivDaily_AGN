#### Technosignatures of Self-Replicating Probes in the Solar System

 - **Abstract**
 We explore a much-neglected area of SETI: solar system techno-signatures. As our cursory solar system exploration consolidates into commercial industrialisation, it is crucial that we determine what to look for and where. We first consider the rationale for interstellar self-replicating probes and their implications for the Fermi paradox. Whether for defensive or exploratory reasons, self-replicating probes are a rational strategy for Galactic investigation. We determine that self-replicating probes will systematically explore the Galaxy by tracking resources of sufficient metallicity. We focus on the resource requirements of a self-replicating interstellar probe that may have visited our solar system. After considering asteroid resources, we suggest that evidence of asteroidal processing will be difficult to discern from natural processes given the constraints imposed by self-replication. We further determine that the Moon is an ideal base of manufacturing operations. We suggest that nuclear reactors, such as the Magnox reactor model, can feasibly be constructed from lunar resources which will have left isotopic ratio signatures of Th-232/Nd-144 and/or Th-232/Ba-137. We further suggest that in anticipatory economic trade for resources, a self-replicating probe may have left artefacts buried with asteroidal resources on the Moon. Such gifts would be detectable and accessible only once a threshold of technological sophistication has been achieved. An obvious gift in trade for the resources utilised would be a universal constructor.
#### Irony at z=6.68: a bright AGN with forbidden Fe emission and multi-component Balmer absorption

 - **Abstract**
 We present the deepest medium-resolution JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy to date of a bright Little Red Dot (LRD) AGN, Irony at z=6.68. The data reveal broad Balmer emission from H$\alpha$-H$\delta$ and Balmer absorption in H$\alpha$-H$\epsilon$. The absorption lines are kinematically split: H$\alpha$ is blueshifted while higher-order lines are redshifted suggesting complex gas kinematics; their relative ratios are inconsistent with a single, passive absorbing screen. The line depths require absorption of both the BLR and the continuum, ruling out a stellar origin, consistent with the smooth Balmer break. We fit the broad H$\gamma$-H$\alpha$ lines and find the data favor a double-Gaussian effective profile, although exponential wings are evident. Depending on the adopted profile, single-epoch virial estimates give log(M$_\bullet$/M$_\odot$)=7.86-8.39 and $\lambda_{\rm Edd}$=1.7-0.4. The dynamical mass implied by the narrow lines is low log(Mdyn/M$_\odot$)=9.1, suggesting an overmassive black hole. The narrow lines display little attenuation, A$_V<0.5$ mag; while broad H$\alpha$/H$\beta\sim9$ and the broad Balmer decrements are inconsistent with standard dust attenuation curves, suggesting collisional processes. The forbidden-line spectrum includes auroral [S II] and [N II], and a forest of [Fe II] lines. Line ratios and kinematics indicate a stratified narrow-line region with both low (n$_{\rm e}$=420 cm$^{-3}$) and high densities (n$_{\rm e}\gtrsim 6.3\times10^5$ cm$^{-3}$). We detect metal absorption lines in both the optical (Ca II and Na I) and UV range (Fe II UV1-UV3). Our results support a picture of a compact AGN embedded in a dense, high covering-factor and stratified cocoon, with complex neutral-gas kinematics. While the choice of broad-line profile affects the virial estimates of M$_\bullet$, we find the effect to be of order 0.6 dex between the different approaches.
#### The warm outer layer of a Little Red Dot as the source of [Fe II] and collisional Balmer lines with scattering wings

 - **Abstract**
 The population of the Little Red Dots (LRDs) may represent a key phase of supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth. A cocoon of dense excited gas is emerging as key component to explain the most striking properties of LRDs, such as strong Balmer breaks and Balmer absorption, as well as the weak IR emission. To dissect the structure of LRDs, we analyze new deep JWST/NIRSpec PRISM and G395H spectra of FRESCO-GN-9771, one of the most luminous known LRDs at $z=5.5$. These reveal a strong Balmer break, broad Balmer lines and very narrow [O III] emission. We unveil a forest of optical [Fe II] lines, which we argue is emerging from a dense ($n_{\rm H}=10^{9-10}$ cm$^{-3}$) warm layer with electron temperature $T_{\rm e}\approx7000$ K. The broad wings of H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ have an exponential profile due to electron scattering in this same layer. The high $\rm H\alpha:H\beta:H\gamma$ flux ratio of $\approx10.4:1:0.14$ is an indicator of collisional excitation and resonant scattering dominating the Balmer line emission. A narrow H$\gamma$ component, unseen in the other two Balmer lines due to outshining by the broad components, could trace the ISM of a normal host galaxy with a star formation rate $\sim5$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. The warm layer is mostly opaque to Balmer transitions, producing a characteristic P-Cygni profile in the line centers suggesting outflowing motions. This same layer is responsible for shaping the Balmer break. The broad-band spectrum can be reasonably matched by a simple photoionized slab model that dominates the $\lambda>1500$ Å continuum and a low mass ($\sim10^8$ M$_{\odot}$) galaxy that could explain the narrow [O III], with only subdominant contribution to the UV continuum. Our findings indicate that Balmer lines are not directly tracing gas kinematics near the SMBH and that the BH mass scale is likely much lower than virial indicators suggest.

 - **Abstract**
 One of the most puzzling properties of the high-redshift AGN population recently discovered by JWST, including both broad-line and narrow-line sources, is their X-ray weakness. With very few exceptions, and regardless of the optical classification, they are undetected at the limits of the deepest Chandra fields, even when stacking signals from tens of sources in standard observed-frame energy intervals (soft, hard, and full bands). It has been proposed that their elusive nature in the X-ray band is due to heavy absorption by dust-free gas or intrinsic weakness, possibly due to high, super-Eddington accretion. In this work, we perform X-ray stacking in three customized rest-frame energy ranges (1-4, 4-7.25, and 10-30 keV) of a sample of 50 Type 1 and 38 Type 2 AGN identified by JWST in the CDFS and CDFN fields. For the Type 2 sub-sample, we reach a total of about 210 Ms exposure, and we report a significant ($\sim 3\sigma$) detection in the hardest (10-30 keV rest frame) band, along with relatively tight upper limits in the rest frame softer energy bands. The most straightforward interpretation is in terms of heavy obscuration due to gas column densities well within the Compton thick regime ($> 2 \times 10^{24} $cm$^{-2}$) with a large covering factor, approaching 4$\pi$. The same procedure applied to the Type 1 sub-sample returns no evidence for a significant signal in about 140 Ms stacked data in any of the adopted bands, confirming their surprisingly elusive nature in the X-ray band obtained with previous stacking experiments. A brief comparison with the current observations and the implications for the evolution of AGN are discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) provides the highest-resolution radio intensity maps, crucial for detailed studies of compact sources like active galactic nuclei (AGN) and their relativistic jets. Analyzing jet components in these maps traditionally involves manual Gaussian fitting, a time-consuming bottleneck for large datasets. To address this, we present an automated batch-processing tool, based on the Gaussian fitting capabilities of CASA, designed to streamline VLBI jet component characterization (AAP-Imfit). Our algorithm sets a detection limit, performs automatic 2D Gaussian fitting, and removes model artifacts, efficiently extracting component flux densities and positions. This method enables systematic and reproducible analysis, significantly reducing the time required for fitting extensive VLBI datasets. We validated AAP-Imfit by using VLBI observations of the blazars 3C 279 and 3C 454.3, comparing our results with published fits. The close agreement in residual root mean square (RMS) values and model/residual-to-map RMS ratios confirms the accuracy of our automated approach in reproducing original flux distributions. While visual inspection remains important for complex or faint features, this routine significantly accelerates VLBI component fitting, paving the way for large-scale statistical studies of jet dynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 Interpreting the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of astrophysical objects with physically motivated models is computationally expensive. These models require solving coupled differential equations in high-dimensional parameter spaces, making traditional fitting techniques such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo or nested sampling prohibitive. A key example is modeling non-thermal emission from blazar jets - relativistic outflows from supermassive black holes in Active Galactic Nuclei that are among the most powerful emitters in the Universe. To address this challenge, we employ machine learning to accelerate SED evaluations, enabling efficient Bayesian inference. We generate a large sample of lepto-hadronic blazar emission models and train a neural network (NN) to predict the photon spectrum with strongly reduced run time while preserving accuracy. As a proof of concept, we present an NN-based tool for blazar SED modeling, laying the groundwork for future extensions and for providing an open-access resource for the astrophysics community.
#### Semianalytical Accretion-Tracer Emission: Forming Planets Are Intrinsically Faint

 - **Abstract**
 Direct-imaging surveys have looked for accreting planets through their accretion tracers such as H alpha but have been less fruitful than expected. However, up to now, hydrogen-line emission at accreting planets has been estimated primarily with extrapolations of stellar-scaling relationships or with theoretical spherically-symmetric computations. To predict the line emission intensity during the formation phase, we wish to follow the consequences of angular momentum conservation of the material accreting onto a gas giant in a protoplanetary disc. We focus on the limiting case that magnetospheric accretion does not occur, which yields a conservative estimate of the line emission and might correspond to certain epochs during formation. We extend but simplify an existing analytical description of the multidimensional gas flow onto an accreting gas giant, the ballistic infall model, and combine this with detailed shock emission models. Applying this to data from a global planet formation model, we confirm that the line-emitting accretion rate is a minuscule fraction of the gas inflow into the Hill sphere. Also, forming planets are mostly fainter than PDS 70 b and c or WISPIT 2 b, with a maximum H alpha line luminosity Lline near 1e-7 Lsol, roughly independent of planet mass. Most surveys have not been sensitive to such faint planets. Other hydrogen lines in the NIR are fainter by 1--2 dex. This implies that accreting planets are fainter than from past estimates, such that the non-detections are not as constraining as thought. Accreting super-Jupiters may well be present, and a deeper look and closer in to the host stars could well reveal many forming planets.

 - **Abstract**
 ADARI (Astronomical DAta Reporting Infrastructure) is a system designed for creating graphical reports of astronomical data so that the quality of these products can be assessed. It has been designed from the ground up to be backend-agnostic, meaning the same ADARI code can be sent to a web plotting API, or a code-based plotting API, with no alteration. Quick data inspection is an important feature in data reduction systems. The use cases range from quality control at the telescope, advance quality checks prior to delivering data to the scientists as well as data inspection for users running the pipelines at their home institutes. The goal of ADARI is to deliver the same experience and code for data visualization for all the environments, either running automatically in the Paranal Observatory environment or at the PI premises. ADARI contains a library that can be used to develop the creation of reports as well as a command line tool (genreport) to execute such reports. Most of the time the reports are generated as part of the execution of a data reduction workflow implemented with EDPS, the new ESO system for automatically organising data from ESO instruments and for running the reduction pipelines on them.
#### Icy or Rocky? Convective or Stable? New interior models of Uranus and Neptune

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new framework for constructing agnostic and yet physical models for planetary interiors and apply it to Uranus and Neptune. Unlike previous research that either impose rigid assumptions or rely on simplified empirical profiles, our approach bridges both paradigms. Starting from randomly generated density profiles, we apply an iterative algorithm that converges toward models that simultaneously satisfy hydrostatic equilibrium, match the observed gravitational moments, and remain thermodynamically and compositionally consistent. The inferred interior models for Uranus and Neptune span a wide range of possible interior structures, in particular encompassing both water-dominated and rock-dominated configurations (rock-to-water mass ratios between 0.04-3.92 for Uranus and 0.20-1.78 for Neptune). All models contain convective regions with ionic water and have temperature-pressure profiles that remain above the demixing curves for hydrogen-helium-water mixtures. This offers both a plausible explanation for the observed non-dipolar magnetic fields and indicates that no hydrogen-helium-water demixing occurs. We find a higher H-He mass fraction in the outermost convection zones for Uranus (0.62-0.73) compared to Neptune (0.25-0.49) and that Uranus' magnetic field is likely generated deeper in the interior compared to Neptune. We infer upper limits of 0.69-0.74 (Uranus) vs. 0.78-0.92 (Neptune) for the outer edges of the dynamo regions in units of normalised radii. Overall, our findings challenge the conventional classification of Uranus and Neptune as "ice giants" and underscore the need for improved observational data or formation constraints to break compositional degeneracy.

 - **Abstract**
 The rapid appearance of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at $z\gtrsim7$ requires efficient pathways to form massive black hole seeds. We investigate whether annihilation of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) can alter primordial (Pop III.1) protostellar evolution sufficiently to enable formation of such `heavy'' seeds. Using the one-dimensional Geneva stellar-evolution code (GENEC) with an implemented Gould single-scatter capture module, we compute a grid of protostellar evolution models covering ambient WIMP mass densities $\rho_\chi=10^{12}$-$10^{16}\ \mathrm{GeV\,cm^{-3}}$, WIMP masses $m_\chi=30$-$3000\ \mathrm{GeV}$, spin-dependent cross sections $\sigma_{\rm SD}=10^{-42}$-$10^{-40}\ \mathrm{cm^2}$, and baryonic accretion rates $\dot{M_*}=(1-3)\times10^{-3}\, M_\odot \,{\rm yr}^{-1}$. We find a robust bifurcation of outcomes. For sufficiently high ambient dark matter density ($\rho_\chi\gtrsim5\times10^{14}\ \mathrm{GeV\,cm^{-3}}$) and capture efficiency ($\sigma_{\rm SD}\gtrsim10^{-41}\ \mathrm{cm^2}$) WIMP annihilation supplies enough energy to inflate protostars onto extended, cool (Hayashi-track) configurations that dramatically suppress ionizing feedback and permit uninterrupted growth to $\sim10^{5}\,M_\odot$. Lighter WIMPs and larger $\sigma_{\rm SD}$ favour earlier and stronger annihilation support; heavier WIMPs delay the effect. For our fiducial case, WIMP masses $<$3 TeV are essential for allowing growth to the supermassive regime, otherwise the protostar evolves to the compact, feedback-limited regime that results in `light'' seeds. These results indicate that, under plausible halo conditions, DM annihilation provides a viable channel for forming heavy black hole seeds.
#### Effects of Primordial Black Holes on IGM History

 - **Abstract**
 Currently the asteroid mass window (mass $\sim 10^{17}- 10^{21}$ grams) remains unconstrained for Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) to make up all of the dark matter content of the universe. Given these PBHs have very small masses, their Hawking temperature can be up to hundreds of keV. This study investigates the potential impacts of PBH Hawking radiation on the intergalactic medium from $z\sim 800-25$, namely studying the ionization history, kinetic gas temperature, and ultimately the 21 cm signature. We find that for masses on the low edge of the asteroid mass window, there are up two orders of magnitude increases in the ionization fraction and kinetic gas temperature by redshift 25, and the 21 cm spin temperature can differ from non-PBH cosmology by factors of a few. This analysis results in maximum differential brightness temperatures of +17 mK for our lightest PBH masses of $2.12\times 10^{16}$g. We also show maximal $53$ mK discrepancies in differential brightness temperatures between our PBH and non-PBH cosmologies for our lightest PBH mass, while our heaviest PBH mass of $1.65 \times 10^{17}$g shows only $0.5$ mK variations. We find the Hawking-radiated electrons and positrons are instrumental in driving these IGM modifications. This study shows the necessity for a rigorous treatment of Hawking radiation in PBH cosmological observables from the dark ages through cosmic dawn.
#### Late-afterglow Emission from a Quasi-spherical Outflow in a stratified environment

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are cosmic events occurring at large distances beyond our galaxy. They provide a unique opportunity to study electromagnetic patterns not seen elsewhere. When the collimated GRB outflow interacts with the outer layers of a star or the wind generated by a binary neutron star merger, it releases energy, forming a quasi-spherical outflow around it. This broad outflow begins to radiate once it has transferred enough energy to the surrounding medium. We have developed a new analytical model that describes the synchrotron afterglow scenario of the quasi-spherical outflow, including factors such as stratified density, self-absorption regime, and the fraction of electrons accelerated by the shock front. We also successfully describe the multiwavelength observations of a sample of llGRB afterglows (GRB 980425, 031203, 060218, 100316D, 130603B, 150101B and 171205A) that exhibited a late component, analyzed in both stellar wind and constant-density environments. Our analysis shows that a constant-density environment is favored. Additionally, we consider the multiwavelength upper limits of the short bursts reported in the Swift-BAT database.
#### Exotic PeVatrons as sources of ultra-high-energy gamma rays

 - **Abstract**
 We explore novel classes of exotic astrophysical sources capable of producing ultra-high-energy gamma rays extending beyond the PeV scale, motivated by quantum gravity scenarios and dark matter phenomenology. These sources include: ultra-spinning black hole vortex-string systems; exotic compact objects such as boson star, axion star and Q-ball. Such Exotica generate powerful magnetic fields through interactions with millicharged dark matter, enabling particle acceleration mechanisms that surpass the energy limits of conventional astrophysical sources like pulsar wind nebulae and supernova remnants. We demonstrate that such exotic PeVatrons could be distributed throughout our Galaxy and may be detectable by current (LHAASO, HAWC) and next-generation (CTA) gamma-ray observatories.
#### Solar limb faculae: intensity contrast from two vantage points

 - **Abstract**
 Small-scale magnetic flux concentrations contribute significantly to the brightness variations of the Sun, yet observing them - particularly their magnetic field - near the solar limb remains challenging. Solar Orbiter offers an unprecedented second vantage point for observing the Sun. When combined with observations from the perspective of Earth, this enables simultaneous dual-viewpoint measurements of these magnetic structures, thereby helping to mitigate observational limitations. Using such a dual-viewpoint geometry, we characterise the brightness contrast of faculae near the limb as a function of both their associated magnetic field strength and the observation angle. We analyse data from Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager on board Solar Orbiter (SO/PHI), obtained during an observation program conducted in near-quadrature configuration with Earth, in combination with data from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO/HMI). The High Resolution Telescope of SO/PHI observed a facular region located near disc centre as seen from its vantage point, while the same region was simultaneously observed near the solar limb by SDO/HMI. We identify faculae and determine their magnetic field strength from the disc-centre observations, and combine these with continuum intensity measurements at the limb to derive dual-viewpoint contrast curves. We then compare these with contrast curves derived from SDO/HMI alone. Using two viewpoints, we consistently find higher facular contrast near the limb than from a single-viewpoint.

 - **Abstract**
 Particle acceleration in relativistic shocks of electron-positron plasmas with proton admixture is investigated through two-dimensional (2D) particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations. The upstream plasma, with a bulk Lorentz factor of $10$ and a magnetization parameter of 0.02, includes a small fraction of protons ($\sim 5\%$ by number). A relativistic perpendicular shock is formed by reflecting the flow off a conducting wall. The shock structure, electromagnetic fields, and particle energy spectra are analyzed. The particle density and the magnetic field have fluctuations. In the far-downstream region of the shock, positrons are accelerated to energies comparable to protons and develop a hard nonthermal component with a spectral index of $\sim 2$ in their energy spectrum, while electrons remain confined to lower energies. This asymmetry is attributed to the polarization properties of proton-driven electromagnetic waves, which favor positron acceleration. The results highlight the importance of plasma composition in shaping particle acceleration and nonthermal emission in relativistic shocks. These findings provide new insights into the microphysics of particle acceleration in astrophysical sources containing relativistic shocks.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze nebular dust attenuation and its correlation with stellar mass ($M_{*}$) and UV spectral slope ($\beta$) in 33 lensed, low-mass star-forming galaxies at $1.4\leq z \leq 2.6$, using Keck/MOSFIRE rest-frame optical spectroscopy. Located behind three massive lensing galaxy clusters Abell 1689, MACS J1149.5+2223, and MACS J0717.5+3745, galaxies in our sample have a median stellar mass of $\log(M_{*}/M_{\odot})=8.3$ and an intrinsic UV absolute magnitude range of $-20.9<M_{UV}<-13$. We measure nebular dust attenuation via Balmer optical depth ($\tau_{B}$) defined as the H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ ratio. We also derive physical properties from Hubble Space Telescope multi-wavelength photometry and construct composite spectra using median stacking in bins of $M_{*}$ and $\beta$. We find that the $\tau_{B}-\beta$ relation for the dwarf galaxies in this study is best represented by SMC dust curve. This is consistent with previous studies of low-metallicity galaxies at similar redshifts, which show a steep attenuation curve similar to the SMC curve, in contrast to high-metallicity and more massive galaxies that exhibit a much shallower dust attenuation curve. We also investigate the relationship between nebular dust attenuation and stellar mass, $E(B-V)_{nebular}-M_{*}$, down to $\log(M_{*}/M_{\odot})\sim 7$. We demonstrate that this relation does not notably evolve with redshift and is consistent with what has been observed for local SDSS galaxies at similar low stellar masses.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed depolarization analysis of a radio galaxy ILTJ012215.21+254334.8, utilizing polarimetric data from the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) Data Release 2 (DR2) catalogue. The selected source exhibits a rotation measure (RM) of ~ - 47 rad/m^2 and a projected linear size of 335 kpc at a redshift z ~ 0.05. Depolarization model fitting was performed on LOFAR High Band Antenna data (120 - 168 MHz), with fractional polarization detected at 3.0%. Five depolarization models were tested, and Bayesian qu-fitting revealed that the three-component model (1T+2ED) best describes the data, with a reduced chi-squared value of 2.12 and a logarithmic Bayesian evidence of 1384.82. This model includes a Faraday-thin component at RM ~ - 0.3 rad/m^2 (instrumental leakage) and two external Faraday dispersion astrophysical emission at RM ~ - 47 rad/m^2. The results demonstrate that depolarization in low-frequency radio galaxies requires multi-component modelling and is driven by turbulence and inhomogeneity in the magneto-ionic medium. Our findings highlight the potential of LOFAR polarization studies for probing galactic and intergalactic magnetic fields with high precision.

 - **Abstract**
 Periodic oscillations at 338 nHz in the Earth frame are observed at high latitudes in direct Doppler velocity measurements. These oscillations correspond to the $m=1$ high-latitude global mode of inertial oscillation. In this study, we investigate the signature of this mode in the photospheric magnetic field using long-term series of line-of-sight magnetograms from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) and the Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG). Through direct observations and spectral analysis, we detect periodic magnetic field oscillations at high latitudes ($65^\circ$--$70^\circ$) with a frequency of 338 nHz in the Earth frame, matching the known frequency of the $m = 1$ high-latitude inertial mode. The observed line-of-sight magnetic field oscillations are predominantly symmetric across the equator. We find a peak magnetic oscillation amplitude of up to $0.2$~gauss and a distinct spatial pattern, both consistent with simplified model calculations in which the radial component of the magnetic field is advected by the mode's horizontal flow field.

 - **Abstract**
 To model the structure and dynamics of the heliosphere well enough for high-quality forecasting, it is essential to accurately estimate the global solar magnetic field used as inner boundary condition in solar wind models. However, our understanding of the photospheric magnetic field topology is inherently constrained by the limitation of systematically observing the Sun from only one vantage point, Earth. To address this challenge, we introduce global magnetic field maps that assimilate far-side active regions derived from helioseismology into solar wind modeling. Through a comparative analysis between the combined surface flux transport and helioseismic Far-side Active Region Model (FARM) magnetic maps and the base surface flux transport model without far-side active regions (SFTM), we assess the feasibility and efficacy of incorporating helio- seismic far-side information in space weather forecasting. We are employing the Wang-Sheeley-Arge Solar Wind (WSA) model for statistical evaluation and leveraging the three-dimensional heliospheric MHD model, EUHFORIA, to analyze a case study. Using the WSA model, we show that including far-side magnetic data improves solar wind forecasts for 2013-2014 by up to 50% in correlation and 3% in Root Mean Square Error and Mean Absolute Error, especially near Earth and STEREO-A. Additionally, our 3D modeling shows significant localized differences in heliospheric structure that can be attributed to the presence or absence of active regions in the magnetic maps used as input boundaries. This highlights the importance of including far-side information to more accurately model and predict space weather effects caused by solar wind, solar transients, and geomagnetic disturbances.

 - **Abstract**
 Blazars are active galactic nuclei known for their extreme variability, offering unique opportunities to study jet physics and high-energy emission mechanisms. In 2024, the Flat Spectrum Radio Quasar (FSRQ) OP313 underwent a remarkable flare event, during which the gamma-ray flux observed by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi/LAT) increased by a factor of 60 over its average value. The flare peak lasted less than two days. Using optical telescopes, we conducted 100-day time-scale observations. Multi-wavelength data revealed that OP313 entered an active state 50 days prior to the flare and remained active for at least 50 days afterward. We propose that this prolonged activity results from variations in electron density within the shock front due to changes in the accretion rate. Concurrently, OP313's spectrum transitioned from an FSRQ-like state to a BL Lac-like state, characterized by a significant increase in the synchrotron peak frequency and the disappearance of broad-line region emission lines. In the post-flare phase, we observed a decoupling between synchrotron radiation and inverse Compton scattering, along with a possible decrease in the magnetic field strength within the shock front.

 - **Abstract**
 Non-jetted AGN exhibit hard X-ray emission with a power law spectrum above $\sim$2 keV, which is thought to be produced through Comptonization of soft photons by electrons and positrons (pairs) in the vicinity of the black hole. The origin and composition of this plasma source, known as the corona, is a matter open for debate. Our study focuses on the role of relativistic protons accelerated in black-hole magnetospheric current sheets in the neutrino production of AGN coronae. We present a model that has two free parameters, namely the proton plasma magnetization $\sigma_{\rm p}$, which controls the peak energy of the neutrino spectrum, and the Eddington ratio $\lambda_{\rm Edd}$ (defined as the ratio between X-ray luminosity $L_{\rm X}$ and Eddington luminosity $L_{\rm Edd}$), which controls the amount of energy transferred to secondary particles. Furthermore, we combine our coronal model with an AGN population in order to provide a prediction for the diffuse neutrino flux measured on Earth. We compare our results with the observational data by IceCube and we find a satisfactory agreement on both the flux value and the slope of the neutrino distribution when we assume a $\sigma_{\rm p}$ value of $10^5$ for all the sources in our sample.

 Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are among the most energetic events in the universe, offering insights into stellar collapse, extreme matter behavior, and cosmic evolution. The advent of multi-messenger astronomy, combining electromagnetic, gravitational wave, and neutrino observations, alongside advances in high-energy polarimetry, is revolutionizing GRB research, enabling deeper exploration of their physical mechanisms. This manuscript summarizes how upcoming and proposed space-based missions will tackle key challenges in GRB science, focusing on four areas: (i) identifying high-redshift GRBs to probe the early universe, (ii) enhancing multi-messenger detection and localization, (iii) improving multi-wavelength follow-up of GRB afterglows, and (iv) studying prompt emission polarization to understand jet dynamics and magnetic fields. Highlighting planned missions and their advancements, this work provides a snapshot of current GRB research frontiers, with updates on the evolving status of these missions.

 - **Abstract**
 GRB~160821B is the only short GRB detected to date at very high energy (VHE, $\gtrsim 100$ GeV). At a redshift $z=0.161$, it was detected by MAGIC telescopes approximately four hours since the trigger. VHE dataset was complied with the datasets of other wavelengths in between the timescale of 1.7 to 4 hours to construct the broadband spectral energy distribution (SED). In previous studies of GRB~160821B, synchrotron and external Compton (EC) model could explain the VHE emission better than the synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) model. Although, these fits were mostly eyeballing data without any optimisation. Our model includes the combination of synchrotron, SSC, and EC models with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. Our analysis reveals that the EC contribution is negligible in comparison with the SSC and our model explains the VHE data well for the wind medium. We found that GRB~160821B is the least energetic VHE GRB and it occurred in high density wind medium which is quiet unusual for a short GRB. But like other long-duration VHE GRBs, GRB~160821B occurred in a poorly magnetised medium. As there is no statistical study on afterglow modelling of short GRB sample, we compare the inferred properties of GRB~160821B with other VHE GRBs. It stands out distinctively in the $E_{k, \rm iso}$ - $\epsilon_B$ parameter space and lies outside the 3-$\sigma$ region of the correlation. In future, more VHE detections of short GRBs, in the CTA era, will provide crucial insights into the emission sites, radiation mechanisms, and particle acceleration, as well as their connection to long GRBs.

 - **Abstract**
 The atomic hydrogen HI content of galaxies is intimately related to star formation and galaxy evolution through the baryon cycle, which involves processes such as accretion, feedback, outflows, and gas recycling. While probing the HI gas over cosmic time has improved our understanding, direct HI detection is essentially limited to $z \lesssim 0.42$ due to the faintness of the 21cm line. Detections beyond this redshift have made use of the stacking technique to obtain average quantities of galaxy populations. Gravitational lensing by the cluster lenses enhances the HI signal and can extend the redshift limit further. In this work, we describe simulations of HI lensing in cluster lenses. We explore the feasibility of detecting strongly lensed HI emission from background galaxies using known 50 cluster lenses within the uGMRT sky coverage. We demonstrate that certain clusters offer a strong likelihood of HI detection. We also investigate how strong lensing distorts the HI spectral line profile. The shape of the HI signal in these lensing models provides useful information and can be used in optimising signal extraction in blind and targeted HI surveys. We find that blind detection of HI signal from galaxies in the redshift range up to 1.58 requires more than a few hundred hours of observations of individual clusters with the uGMRT. Detection of HI emission in galaxies where strong lensing has been observed in the optical appears to be more promising with potential for a $5\sigma$ detection in $<50$ hours of on-source observations for Abell 370 and in $<75$ hours for Abell 1703 with the uGMRT.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive study of the X-ray binary system XTE~J1550-564, with the primary objective of analyzing the evolution of the black hole's spin parameter. To achieve this objective, we embarked on the necessary step of identifying a plausible progenitor for the system. Using a set of models covering various parameter combinations, we were able to replicate the system's observed characteristics within acceptable error margins, including fundamental parameters such as component masses, orbital period, donor luminosity, and effective temperature. The model results indicate the possibility of diverse evolutionary pathways for the system, highlighting the significant role played by the initial mass of the donor star and the efficiency of mass transfer episodes. While some models are well-aligned with estimates of the mass transfer rate, they all fall short of explaining the black hole's observed moderate spin ($a^* = 0.49$). We also explored alternative magnetic braking prescriptions, finding that only an extreme and fully conservative scenario, based on the convection and rotation boosted prescription, can reproduce the observed spin and only in a marginal way. Our study attempts to shed light on the complex dynamics of black hole X-ray binaries and the challenges of explaining their observed properties with theoretical models.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. We present a deep XMM-Newton observation of the massive, edge-on galaxy NGC 5746. The total exposure time of 250 ks provides unprecedented sensitivity to study the diffuse hot gas in the halo, significantly surpassing the depth of previous observations. Aims. While the presence of hot, circumgalactic gas is well tested for starburst galaxies, detections in normal galaxies remain scarce. By studying the diffuse X-ray emission in NGC 5746, we aim to provide new insights into the evolution of star-forming galaxies and their surroundings. Methods. We create X-ray images and surface brightness profiles to quantify the distribution of extraplanar gas in the halo of NGC 5746. In addition, we isolate the diffuse emission component from point source- and background-contamination and study the spectral characteristics of the hot plasma. Results. We detect soft X-ray emission out to 40 kpc from the galactic disc. The gas distribution is reminiscent of a stellar outflow, with two bubbles extending perpendicular to the disc in a biconical shape. The spectral analysis of the halo emission yields a plasma temperature of 0.56 keV, higher than the typical values observed in spiral galaxies (0.2 keV). The disc has an even higher plasma temperature of 0.7 keV, and is dominated by non-thermal emission from unresolved X-ray binaries. The signs of a stellar outflow, bright X-ray emission, and high plasma temperatures indicate that the star-forming activity in NGC 5746 might be higher than previously thought. Conclusions. Our results demonstrate that massive spiral galaxies can host luminous X-ray halos, and support theoretical models that predict their existence. Earlier claims of a lack of hot gas around quiescent spirals might be attributed to the detection thresholds in shallower observations, stressing the need for more, deeper observations of non-starburst galaxies.

 We present a search for $z\simeq7$ Lyman-break galaxies using the $1.72 \, \rm{deg}^2$ near-infrared UltraVISTA survey in the COSMOS field, reaching $5\,\sigma$ depths in $Y$ of 26.2. We incorporate deep optical and Spitzer imaging for a full spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting analysis. We find 289 candidate galaxies at $6.5\leq z \leq 7.5$ covering $-22.6 \leq M_{\rm UV} \leq -20.2$, faint enough to overlap with Hubble Space Telescope studies. We conduct a separate selection by including complementary Euclid performance verification imaging (reaching $5\,\sigma$ depths of $26.3$), yielding 140 galaxies in $0.65 \, \rm{deg}^2$, with 38 sources unique to this sample. We compute the rest-frame UV luminosity function (UV LF) from our samples, extending below the knee ($M^*=-21.14^{+0.28}_{-0.25}$). We find that the shape of the UV LF is consistent with both a Schechter function and double-power law (DPL) at the magnitudes probed by this sample, with a DPL preferred at $M_{\rm UV}<-22.5$ when bright-end results are included. The UltraVISTA+Euclid sample provides a clean measurement of the LF due to the overlapping near-infrared filters identifying molecular absorption features in the SEDs of ultra-cool dwarf interlopers, and additional faint galaxies are recovered. A comparison with JWST LFs at $z>7$ suggests a gentle evolution in the bright-end slope, although this is limited by a lack of robust bright-end measurements at $z>9$. We forecast that in the Euclid Deep Fields, the removal of contaminant ultra-cool dwarfs as point sources will be possible at $J_{\rm E} < 24.5$. Finally, we present a high-equivalent-width Lyman-$\alpha$ emitter candidate identified by combining HSC, VISTA, and Euclid broadband photometry, highlighting the synergistic power these instruments will have in the Euclid Auxiliary Fields for identifying extreme sources in the Epoch of Reionisation.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a sub-grid model for star formation in galaxy simulations, incorporating molecular hydrogen ($\mathrm{H}_2$) production via dust grain condensation and its destruction through star formation and photodissociation. Implemented within the magnetohydrodynamical code AREPO, our model tracks the non-equilibrium mass fractions of molecular, ionised, and atomic hydrogen, as well as a stellar component, by solving a system of differential equations governing mass exchange between these phases. Star formation is treated with a variable rate dependent on the local $\mathrm{H}_2$ abundance, which itself varies in a complex way with key quantities such as gas density and metallicity. Testing the model in a cosmological simulation of a Milky Way-mass galaxy, we obtain a well-defined spiral structure at $z = 0$, including a gas disc twice the size of the stellar one, alongside a realistic star formation history. Our results show a broad range of star formation efficiencies per free-fall time, from as low as $0.001\%$ at high redshift to values between $0.1\%$ and $10\%$ for ages $\gtrsim 3-4 \, \mathrm{Gyr}$. These findings align well with observational estimates and simulations of a turbulent interstellar medium. Notably, our model reproduces a star formation rate versus molecular hydrogen surface densities relation akin to the molecular Kennicutt-Schmidt law. Furthermore, we find that the star formation efficiency varies with density and metallicity, providing an alternative to fixed-efficiency assumptions and enabling comparisons with more detailed star formation models. Comparing different star formation prescriptions, we find that in models that link star formation to $\mathrm{H}_2$, star formation onset is $\sim \! 500 \, \mathrm{Myr}$ later than those relying solely on total or cold gas density.

 - **Abstract**
 Radio synchrotron emission originates from both massive star formation and black hole accretion, two processes that drive galaxy evolution. Efficient classification of sources dominated by either process is therefore essential for fully exploiting deep, wide-field extragalactic radio continuum surveys. In this study, we implement, optimize, and compare five widely used supervised machine-learning (ML) algorithms to classify radio sources detected in the MeerKAT International GHz Tiered Extragalactic Exploration (MIGHTEE)-COSMOS survey as star-forming galaxies (SFGs) and active galactic nuclei (AGN). Training and test sets are constructed from conventionally classified MIGHTEE-COSMOS sources, and 18 physical parameters of the MIGHTEE-detected sources are evaluated as input features. As anticipated, our feature analyses rank the five parameters used in conventional classification as the most effective: the infrared-radio correlation parameter ($q_\mathrm{IR}$), the optical compactness morphology parameter (class$\_$star), stellar mass, and two combined mid-infrared colors. By optimizing the ML models with these selected features and testing classifiers across various feature combinations, we find that model performance generally improves as additional features are incorporated. Overall, all five algorithms yield an $F1$-score (the harmonic mean of precision and recall) $>90\%$ even when trained on only $20\%$ of the dataset. Among them, the distance-based $k$-nearest neighbors classifier demonstrates the highest accuracy and stability, establishing it as a robust and effective method for classifying SFGs and AGN in upcoming large radio continuum surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 Using deep observations across three of the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey Deep Fields, this work measures the angular clustering of star forming galaxies (SFGs) and low-excitation radio galaxies (LERGs) to $z$$\lesssim$1.5 for faint sources, $S_{\textrm{144 MHz}}$$\geq$200 $\mu$Jy. We measure the angular auto-correlation of LOFAR sources in redshift bins and their cross-correlation with multi-wavelength sources {to} measure the evolving galaxy bias for SFGs and LERGs. Our work shows the bias of the radio-selected SFGs increases from $b=0.90^{+0.11}_{-0.10}$ at $z \sim 0.2$ to $b = 2.94^{+0.36}_{-0.36}$ at $z \sim 1.2$; faster than the assumed $b(z)$$\propto$$1/D(z)$ models adopted in previous LOFAR cosmology studies (at sensitivities where AGN dominate), but in broad agreement with previous work. We further study the luminosity dependence of bias for SFGs and find little evidence for any luminosity dependence at fixed redshift, although uncertainties remain large for the sample sizes available. The LERG population instead shows a weaker redshift evolution with $b=2.33^{+0.28}_{-0.27}$ at $z \sim 0.7$ to $b=2.65^{+0.57}_{-0.55}$ at $z \sim 1.2$, though it is also consistent with the assumed bias evolution model ($b(z)$$\propto$$1/D(z)$) within the measured uncertainties. For those LERGs which reside in quiescent galaxies (QLERGs), there is weak evidence that they are more biased than the general LERG population and evolve from $b = 2.62^{+0.33}_{-0.33}$ at $z \sim 0.7$ to $b = 3.08^{+0.85}_{-0.84}$ at $z \sim 1.2$. This suggests the halo environment of radio sources may be related to their properties. These measurements can help constrain models for the bias evolution of these source populations, and can help inform multi-tracer analyses.

 - **Abstract**
 The quasar main sequence (QMS), characterized by the Eigenvector 1 (EV1), serves as a unifying framework for classifying type-1 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) based on their diverse spectral properties. Although a fully self-consistent physical interpretation has long been lacking, our physically motivated 2.5D FRADO (Failed Radiatively Accelerated Dusty Outflow) model naturally predicts that the Eddington ratio ($\dot{m}$) is the primary physical driver of the QMS, with black hole mass ($M_{\rm BH}$) and inclination ($i$) acting as secondary contributors. We employed a dense grid of FRADO simulations of the geometry and dynamics of the broad-line region (BLR), covering a representative range of $M_{\rm BH}$ and $\dot{m}$. For each simulation, we computed the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the H$\beta$ line under different $i$. The resulting FWHM--$\dot{m}$ diagram closely resembles the characteristic trend observed in the EV1 parameter space. This establishes the role of $\dot{m}$ as the true proxy for the Fe II strength parameter ($R_{\rm Fe}$), and vice versa. Our results suggest that $\dot{m}$ can be regarded as the sole underlying physical tracer of $R_{\rm Fe}$ and should therefore scale directly with it. The $M_{\rm BH}$ accounts for the virial mass-related scatter in FWHM, while $i$ acts as a secondary driver modulating $R_{\rm Fe}$ and FWHM for a given $\dot{m}$ and $M_{\rm BH}$.

 - **Abstract**
 The magnification resulting from strong gravitational lensing is a powerful tool to add new constraints to the cosmic evolution of supernova progenitors by enabling the study of distant supernovae that would otherwise not be observable. iPTF16geu is the most well-observed gravitationally lensed supernova (glSN) to date. At a redshift of $z = 0.409$ and magnified by a factor of $\sim$68, extensive photometric and spectroscopic observations have been obtained. The explosion mechanism producing this rare event and differences compared to lower redshift supernovae however have not been explored in detail. Here we compare observations of iPTF16geu to existing radiative transfer simulations of type Ia supernova explosion models selected from the literature. We find that overall the DDC6 and PDDEL1 models, specific variations of the delayed detonation explosion scenario, produce the closest match to the light curves and many absorption features, but struggle to replicate the observed colours and in particular the rest-frame UV. We also investigate the magnification and reddening values required to improve agreement with the selected models. We find some evidence in favour of a UV flux excess that may be intrinsic to iPTF16geu or due to external factors such as host galaxy subtraction and uncertainties in the reddening law. Upcoming surveys will significantly increase the samples of SNe discovered at high redshifts due to strong gravitational lensing. These glSNe will enable tighter constraints on the explosion physics of type Ia supernovae and how this has evolved throughout the Universe.
