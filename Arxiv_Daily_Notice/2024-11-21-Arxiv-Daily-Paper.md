 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of three ultracompact binary white dwarf systems hosting accretion disks, with orbital periods of 7.95, 8.68, and 13.15 minutes. This significantly augments the population of mass-transferring binaries at the shortest periods, and provides the first evidence that accretors in ultracompacts can be dense enough to host accretion disks even below 10 minutes (where previously only direct-impact accretors were known). In the two shortest-period systems, we measured changes in the orbital periods driven by the combined effect of gravitational wave emission and mass transfer; we find $\dot{P}$ is negative in one case, and positive in the other. This is only the second system measured with a positive $\dot{P}$, and it the most compact binary known that has survived a period minimum. Using these systems as examples, we show how the measurement of $\dot{P}$ is a powerful tool in constraining the physical properties of binaries, e.g. the mass and mass-radius relation of the donor stars. We find that the chirp masses of ultracompact binaries at these periods seem to cluster around $\mathcal{M}_c \sim 0.3 M_\odot$, perhaps suggesting a common origin for these systems or a selection bias in electromagnetic discoveries. Our new systems are among the highest-amplitude known gravitational wave sources in the millihertz regime, providing exquisite opportunity for multi-messenger study with future space-based observatories such as \textit{LISA} and TianQin; we discuss how such systems provide fascinating laboratories to study the unique regime where the accretion process is mediated by gravitational waves.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy mergers represent the most transformative and dramatic avenue for galaxy and supermassive black hole (SMBH) evolution. Multi-active galactic nuclei (multi-AGNs) are expected to ignite, grow, and evolve alongside the host galaxies, and these represent different evolutionary stages of the SMBHs over the merger sequence. However, no comprehensive census exists of observed multi-AGN systems. Here we present The Big Multi-AGN Catalog (The Big MAC), the first literature-complete catalog of all known (confirmed and candidate) multi-AGN systems, which includes dual AGNs (separations $\sim0.03-110$ kpc), binary AGNs (gravitationally bound, $\lesssim30$ pc), recoiling AGNs, and N-tuple AGNs (involving three or more AGNs), gleaned from hundreds of literature articles spanning the years 1970-2020. The Big MAC is the first archive to assemble all multi-AGN systems and candidates across all selection methods, redshifts, and galaxy mass ratios, and this catalog offers a solid foundation for archival and targeted multiwavelength follow-up investigations. In this work, we provide an overview of the creation of the multi-AGN literature library and the catalog itself, present definitions for different multi-AGN classes (including new definitions for dual AGNs derived from galaxy pairs in Illustris-TNG100), describe the general properties of the catalog as a function of redshift space and separation, and we provide a thorough examination of selection and confirmation method usage within the literature. We also discuss best practices for the multi-AGN literature, and we emphasize that a diverse, multiwavelength array of selection approaches is crucial for a complete understanding of multi-AGNs and - by extension - answering long-standing, open questions regarding the importance of AGNs and galaxy mergers.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutral hydrogen (HI) emission closely traces the dust column density at high Galactic latitudes and is thus a powerful tool for predicting dust extinction. However, the relation between HI column density $N_{\rm HI}$ and high-latitude dust emission observed by Planck has large-scale residuals at the level of $\lesssim 20\%$ on tens of degree scales. In this work, we improve HI-based dust templates in the North/South Galactic poles covering a sky fraction of $f_{\rm sky}=13.5\%/11.0\%$ (5,577/4,555 deg$^2$) by incorporating data from ionized (HII) and molecular (H$_2$) gas phases. We make further improvements by employing a clustering analysis on the HI spectral data to identify discrete clouds with distinct dust properties. However, only a modest reduction in fitting residuals is achieved. We quantify the contributions to these residuals from variations in the dust-to-gas ratio, dust temperature and opacity, and magnetic field orientation using ancillary datasets. Although residuals in a few particular regions can be attributed to these factors, no single explanation accounts for the majority. We derive an upper limit on the high-latitude dust temperature variation of $\sigma_T<1.28$ K, lower than the temperature variation reported in previous studies. Joint analysis of multiple existing and upcoming datasets that trace Galactic gas and dust properties is needed to clarify the origins of the variation of gas and dust properties found here and to significantly improve gas-based extinction maps.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed analysis of jet activity in the radio galaxy 3C348 at the center of the galaxy cluster Hercules A. We use archival Chandra data to investigate the jet-driven shock front, the radio-faint X-ray cavities, the eastern jet, and the presence of extended Inverse Compton (IC) X-ray emission from the radio lobes. We detect two pairs of shocks: one in the north-south direction at 150 kpc from the center, and another in the east-west direction at 280 kpc. These shocks have Mach numbers of $\mathcal{M} = 1.65\pm0.05$ and $\mathcal{M} = 1.9\pm0.3$, respectively. Together, they form a complete cocoon around the large radio lobes. Based on the distance of the shocks from the center, we estimate that the corresponding jet outburst is 90-150 Myr old. We confirm the presence of two radio-faint cavities within the cocoon, misaligned from the lobes, each $\sim$100 kpc wide and 40-60 Myr old. A backflow from the radio lobes might explain why the cavities are dynamically younger than the cocoon shock front. We also detect non-thermal X-ray emission from the eastern jet and from the large radio lobes. The X-ray emission from the jet is visible at 80 kpc from the AGN and can be accounted for by an IC model with a mild Doppler boosting ($\delta\sim2.7$). A synchrotron model could explain the radio-to-X-ray spectrum only for very high Lorentz factors $\gamma\geq10^{8}$ of the electrons in the jet. For the large radio lobes, we argue that the X-ray emission has an IC origin, with a 1 keV flux density of $21.7\pm1.4\text{(statistical)}\pm1.3\text{(systematic)}$ nJy. A thermal model is unlikely, as it would require unrealistically high gas temperature, density, and pressure, along with a strong depolarization of the radio lobes, which are instead highly polarized. The IC detection, combined with the synchrotron flux density, suggests a magnetic field of $12\pm3\mu$G in the lobes.

 - **Abstract**
 Shock-generated transients, such as hot flow anomalies (HFAs), upstream of planetary bow shocks, play a critical role in electron acceleration. Using multi-mission data from NASA's Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) and ESA's Cluster missions, we demonstrate the transmission of HFAs through Earth's quasi-parallel bow shock, associated with acceleration of electrons up to relativistic energies. Energetic electrons, initially accelerated upstream, are shown to remain broadly confined within the transmitted transient structures downstream, where betatron acceleration further boosts their energy due to elevated compression levels. Additionally, high-speed jets form at the compressive edges of HFAs, exhibiting a significant increase in dynamic pressure and potentially contributing to driving further localized compression. Our findings emphasize the efficiency of quasi-parallel shocks in driving particle acceleration far beyond the immediate shock transition region, expanding the acceleration region to a larger spatial domain. Finally, this study underscores the importance of multi-scale observational approach in understanding the convoluted processes behind collisionless shock physics and their broader implications.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on an international scientific conference, where we brought together the African and European academic astronomy communities. This conference aimed to bridge the gap between those in position of privilege, with ease of access to international networking events (i.e., the typical experience of those affiliated with Western institutions), with those who have been historically excluded (affecting the majority of African scientists/institutions). We describe how we designed the conference around cutting-edge problems in the research field, but with a large focus on building networking and professional relationships. Significant effort went into: (1) ensuring a diverse representation of participants; (2) practically and financially supporting those who may have never attended an international conference and; (3) creating an inclusive and supportive environment through a careful programme of activities, both before and during the event. Throughout this process maintaining scientific integrity was a core commitment. We summarise some of the successes, challenges, and lessons learnt from organising this conference. We also present feedback obtained from participants, which demonstrates an overall achievement of our objectives. This is all combined to provide some key recommendations for any groups, from any research field, who wishes to lead similar initiatives.

This work is based on the post-processing of 3-D (magneto)hydrodynamical this http URL data set consists of 22 simulations. The supernovae are placed at a distance of either 25 pc or 50 pc from the molecular cloud centre of mass. First, we calculate optical synthetic emission maps (taking into account dust attenuation within the simulation sub-cube). Second, we analyse the data set of synthetic observations using principle component analysis to identify clusters with the k-means algorithm. We find that the presence or absence of magnetic fields has no statistically significant effect on the optical line emission. However, the ambient density distribution at the site of the supernova changes the entire evolution and morphology of the supernova remnant. Due to the different ambient densities in the 25 pc and 50 pc simulations, we are able to distinguish them in a statistically significant manner. Although, optical line attenuation within the supernova remnant can mimic this result depending on the attenuation model that is used. That is why, multi-dimensional analysis of optical emission line ratios in this work does not give extra information about the environmental conditions (ambient density and ambient magnetic field) of the SNR.

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are among the most energetic events in the universe, driven by relativistic jets launched from black holes (BHs) formed during the collapse of massive stars or after the merger of two neutron stars (NSs). The jet power depends on the BH spin and the magnetic flux accreted onto it. In the standard thin disk model, jet power is limited by insufficient magnetic flux, even when the spin approaches maximum possible value. In contrast, the magnetically arrested disk (MAD) state limits jet energy by extracting significant angular momentum, braking BH rotation. We propose a unified model incorporating both standard thin disk and MAD states, identifying a universal curve for jet power per accretion rate as a function of the magnetic flux ratio, $\Delta_\mathrm{eq} = (\Phi_\mathrm{BH}/\Phi_\mathrm{MAD})_\mathrm{eq}$, at spin equilibrium. For long GRBs (lGRBs), the model predicts a maximum jet energy of $\sim 1.5\%$ of the accretion energy, occurring at $\Delta_\mathrm{eq} \sim 0.4$ where the BH equilibrium spin is $a \sim 0.5$. Both long and short GRBs are unlikely to be produced by a MAD: for short GRBs (sGRBs), this requires an accreted mass orders of magnitude smaller than that available, while for lGRBs, the narrow progenitor mass distribution challenges the ability to produce the observed broad distribution of jet energies. This framework provides a consistent explanation for both standard and luminous GRBs, emphasizing the critical role of magnetic flux. Both long and short GRBs require magnetic flux distributions that peak around $10^{27}\,\mathrm{G\,cm}^2$.

 - **Abstract**
 Planets lose mass to atmospheric outflows, and this mass loss is thought to be central in shaping the bimodal population of gaseous giant and rocky terrestrial exoplanets in close orbits. We model the escape of planetary atmospheres in three dimensional gas dynamic simulations in order to study their emergent morphology. Planetary outflows show a range of shapes from fast, isotropic outflows bounded by bow shocks to slower motion confined to thin streams. We show that a crucial factor is the role of the tidal gravity and orbiting reference frame in which planets lose mass. Flows can be characterized by the dimensionless Rossby number evaluated at the scale of the Hill sphere. Flows with a low Rossby number are significantly deviated and shaped by the stellar gravity, while those with a high Rossby number are comparatively unaffected. Rossby number alone is sufficient to predict outflow morphology as well as kinematic gradients across transit. The known exoplanet population should span a range of outflow Rossby numbers and thus shapes. We can use this information to constrain outflow physics and to inform observing strategies.

 - **Abstract**
 Star-forming regions host a large and evolving suite of molecular species. Molecular transition lines, particularly of complex molecules, can reveal the physical and dynamical environment of star formation. We aim to study the large-scale structure and environment of high-mass star formation through single-dish observations of CH$_3$CCH, CH$_3$OH, and H$_2$CO. We have conducted a wide-band spectral survey with the IRAM 30-m telescope and the 100-m GBT towards the high-mass star-forming region DR21(OH)/N44. We use a multi-component local thermodynamic equilibrium model to determine the large-scale physical environment near DR21(OH) and the surrounding dense clumps. We follow up with a radiative transfer code for CH$_3$OH to look at non-LTE behaviour. We then use a gas-grain chemical model to understand the formation routes of these molecules in their observed environments. We disentangle multiple components of DR21(OH) in each of the three molecules. We find a warm and cold component each towards the dusty condensations MM1 and MM2, and a fifth broad, outflow component. We also reveal warm and cold components towards other dense clumps in our maps: N40, N36, N41, N38, and N48. We find thermal mechanisms are adequate to produce the observed abundances of H$_2$CO and CH$_3$CCH while non-thermal mechanisms are needed to produce CH$_3$OH. Through a combination of wide-band mapping observations, LTE and non-LTE model analysis, and chemical modelling, we disentangle the different velocity and temperature components within our clump-scale beam, a scale that links a star-forming core to its parent cloud. We find numerous warm, 20-80 K components corresponding to known cores and outflows in the region. We determine the production routes of these species to be dominated by grain chemistry.
#### Understanding the UV/Optical Variability of AGNs through Quasi-Periodic Large-scale Magnetic Dynamos

 - **Abstract**
 The UV/optical light curves observed in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are well-characterized by damped random walk (DRW) process, with the damping time $\tau_d$ exhibiting correlations with both the black hole mass ($M_{BH}$) and the photon wavelength ($\lambda$). However, the underlying physical origins for the DRW process and the scaling laws remain unclear. We aim to understand the AGN variability induced by a quasi-periodic large-scale dynamo in an accretion disk, and examine whether it reproduces the observed variability features in AGN UV/optical light curves. Using a one-dimensional, optically thick, geometrically thin disk model, we introduce variability into the viscosity parameter $\alpha$ by incorporating quasi-periodic large-scale magnetic fields. With reasonable dynamo parameters, our model successfully reproduces both the linear relation between the root-mean-square and the mean values of the radiation flux, and the log-normal distribution of the flux variability. The PSDs of accretion rates and radiation fluxes align well with DRW models, and yield consistent values of $\tau_d$ with AGN observations. Analytical arguments, supported by numerical evidence, suggest that the flattening of flux PSDs at low frequencies is governed by the timescale at the inner boundary of the emission region for a given wavelength. For $M_{BH} \gtrsim 10^6 M_\odot$, variations in the Eddington ratio flatten the $\tau_d$-$M_{BH}$ scaling, resulting in $\tau_d \propto M_{BH}^{0.5-1}$. For $M_{BH} \lesssim 10^6 M_\odot$, we find a steeper scaling, $\tau_d \propto M_{BH}$. Including further refinements, such as the dependence of dynamo properties on $M_{BH}$ and AGN luminosity, and accounting for X-ray reprocessing, would further enhance the accuracy of the model compared to observations.

 - **Abstract**
 The Fe K$\alpha$ fluorescence line emission in X-ray spectra is a powerful diagnostic tool for various astrophysical objects to reveal the distribution of cold matter around photo-ionizing sources. The advent of the X-ray microcalorimeter onboard the \textit{XRISM} satellite will bring new constraints on the emission line. We present one of the first such results for the high-mass X-ray binary Centaurus X-3, which is composed of an O-type star and a neutron star (NS). We conducted a 155 ks observation covering an entire binary orbit. A weak Fe K$\alpha$ line was detected in all orbital phases at an equivalent width (EW) of 10--20 eV. We found for the first time that its radial velocity (RV) is sinusoidally modulated by the orbital phase. The RV amplitude is 248 $\pm$ 13 km s$^{-1}$, which is significantly smaller than the value (391 km s$^{-1}$) expected if the emission is from the NS surface, but is consistent if the emission takes place at the O star surface. We discuss several possibilities of the line production site, including the NS surface, O star surface, O star wind, and accretion stream from the O star to the NS. We ran radiative transfer calculation for some of them assuming spherically-symmetric density and velocity profiles and an isotropic distribution of X-ray emission from the NS. None of them explains the observed EW and velocity dispersion dependence on the orbital phase, suggesting that more elaborated modeling is needed. In other words, the present observational results have capability to constrain deviations from these assumptions.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent literature reports a color deviation between observed Gaia color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) and theoretical model isochrone predictions, particularly in the very low-mass regime. To assess its impact on cluster age determination via isochrone fitting, we quantified the color deviations for three benchmark clusters, Hyades, Pleiades, and Praesepe, both for the Gaia color (BP-RP) and (G-RP). In general, the (G-RP) color deviations are smaller than the (BP-RP) ones. Empirical color correction functions based on these benchmarks are derived for the currently available MIST and PARSEC 1.2S isochrone models. Applying the correction functions to 31 additional open clusters and 3 moving groups results in a significantly improved alignment between the isochrones and observed CMDs. With our empirical corrections, isochrones provide age estimates consistent with literature values obtained through the spectral Lithium Depletion Boundary method, validating the effectiveness of our approach. The corresponding metallicities with PARSEC 1.2S also show a good agreement with the spectroscopic results. The empirical color correction function we present in this work offers a tool for a consistent age determination within the full mass range of stellar clusters using the isochrone fitting method.

 - **Abstract**
 The magnetic dynamo mechanism of giant stars remains an open question, which can be explored by investigating their activity-rotation relations with multiple proxies. By using the data from the LAMOST and \emph{GALEX} surveys, we carried out a comprehensive study of activity-rotation relations of evolved stars based on \cahk lines, $\rm{H\alpha}$ lines and near ultraviolet (NUV) emissions. Our results show that evolved stars and dwarfs obey a similar power-law in the unsaturated region of the activity-rotation relation, indicating a common dynamo mechanism in both giant and dwarfs. There is no clear difference in the activity levels between red giant branch stars and red clump stars, nor between single giants and those in binaries. Additionally, our results show that the NUV activity levels of giants are comparable to those of G- and K-type dwarfs and are higher than those of M dwarfs.

 - **Abstract**
 The typically large distances, extinction, and crowding of Galactic supermassive star clusters have so far hampered the identification of their very low mass members, required to extend our understanding of star and planet formation, and early stellar evolution, to starburst. This situation has now evolved thanks to the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), and its unmatched resolution and sensitivity in the infrared. In this paper, the third of the series of the Extended Westerlund 1 and 2 Open Clusters Survey (EWOCS), we present JWST/NIRCam and JWST/MIRI observations of the supermassive star cluster Westerlund 1. These observations are specifically designed to unveil the cluster members down to the BD mass regime, and to allow us to select and study the protoplanetary disks and to study the mutual feedback between the cluster members and the surrounding environment. Westerlund 1 was observed as part of JWST GO-1905 for 23.6 hours. The data have been reduced using the JWST calibration pipeline, together with specific tools necessary to remove artifacts. Source identification and photometry were performed with DOLPHOT. The MIRI images show a plethora of different features. Diffuse nebular emission is observed around the cluster, which is typically composed of myriads of droplet-like features pointing toward the cluster center or the group of massive stars surrounding the WR star W72/A. A long pillar is also observed in the NW. The MIRI images also show resolved shells and outflows surrounding the M-type RSG W20, W26, W75, and W237, the sgB[e] star W9 and the YHG W4. The color-magnitude diagrams built using the NIRCam photometry show a clear cluster sequence, which is marked in its upper part by the 1828 NIRCam stars with X-ray counterparts. NIRCam observations using the F115W filter have reached the 23.8 mag limit with 50\% completeness (roughly corresponding to a 0.06 Msol brown dwarf).

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Magnetic batteries are potential sources that may drive the generation of a seed magnetic field, even if this field is initially zero. These batteries can be the result of non-aligned thermodynamic gradients in a plasma, as well as of special and general relativistic effects. So far, magnetic batteries have only been studied in ideal magnetized fluids. Aims. We study the non-ideal fluid effects introduced by the energy flux in the vortical dynamics of a magnetized plasma in curved spacetime. We propose a novel mechanism for generating a heat flux-driven magnetic seed within a simple accretion disk model around a Schwarzschild black hole. Methods. We use the 3+1 formalism for the splitting of the space-time metric into space-like and time-like components. We study the vortical dynamics of a magnetized fluid with a heat flux in the Schwarzschild geometry in which thermodynamic and hydrodynamic quantities are only dependent on the radial coordinate. Assuming that the magnetic field is initially zero, we estimate linear time evolution of the magnetic field due to the inclusion of non-ideal fluid effects. Results. When the thermodynamic and hydrodynamic quantities vary only radially, the effect of the coupling between the heat flux, spacetime curvature and fluid velocity acts as the primary driver for an initial linearly time growing magnetic field. The plasma heat flux completely dominates the magnetic field generation at an specific distance from the black hole, where the fluid vorticity vanishes. This distance depends on the thermodynamical properties of the Keplerian plasma accretion disk. These properties control the strength of the non-ideal effects in the generation of seed magnetic fields.

 - **Abstract**
 This study aims to investigate whether the environment and the nuclear activity of a particular galaxy influence the ageing and quenching at the transition stage of the galaxy evolution using the volume-limited sample constructed from the twelve release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. To this end, the galaxies were classified into isolated and non-isolated environments and then each subsample was further classified according to their nuclear activity using the WHAN diagnostic diagram, and ageing diagram to obtain ageing and quenching galaxies. The ageing and quenching galaxies at the transition stage were selected for the rest of the analysis. Using the star formation rate and the $u-r$ colour-stellar mass diagrams, the study revealed a significant change of $0.03$ dex in slope and $0.30$ dex in intercept for ageing galaxies and an insignificant change of $0.02$ dex in slope and $0.12$ dex in intercept of the star formation main sequence between isolated and non-isolated quenching galaxies. Further, a more significant change in the number of ageing galaxies above, within and below the main sequence and the green valley was observed. On the other hand, an insignificant change in the number of quenching galaxies above, within and below the main sequence and the green valley was observed. The study concludes that ageing depends on the environment and the dependence is influenced by the nuclear activity of a particular galaxy while quenching does not depend on the environment and this independence is not influenced by the nuclear activity.

 - **Abstract**
 A rapidly spinning, millisecond magnetar is widely considered one of the most plausible power sources for gamma-ray burst-associated supernovae (GRB-SNe). Recent studies have demonstrated that the magnetar model can effectively explain the bolometric light curves of most GRB-SNe. In this work, we investigate the bolometric light curves of 13 GRB-SNe, focusing on key observational parameters such as peak luminosity, rise time, and decay time, estimated using Gaussian Process (GP) regression for light curve fitting. We also apply Principal Component Analysis to all the light curve parameters to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and visualize the distribution of SNe in lower-dimensional space. Our findings indicate that while most GRB-SNe share common physical characteristics, a few outliers, notably SNe 2010ma and 2011kl, exhibit distinct features. These events suggest potential differences in progenitor properties or explosion mechanisms, offering deeper insight into the diversity of GRB-SNe and their central engines.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new iterative deblending method to separate the host galaxy (HG) and their Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) emission with the use of Integral Field spectroscopic (IFS) data. The method decomposes the resolved HG emission from the unresolved AGN emission by modelling the two-dimensional surface brightness (SB) profile of the point-spread function (PSF) and the two-dimensional SB HG continuum simultaneously per each monochromatic slide. Our method does not require any prior information about the observed SB profile or a detailed fitting of the PSF, making it ideal for the automatic analysis of large galaxy samples. In this work, we test the quality of our method, its advantages, and its disadvantages. We test our method by using a set of IFS mock data cubes to quantify the reliability of our deblending process and further compare our method with the {\sc QDeblend3D} analysis tool. Furthermore, we applied our method to three data cubes selected from the MaNGA survey according to the dominance of either its HG or its AGN. We show that our deblending method is capable of disengaging the bright, nonresolved AGN emission from the HG continuum and its narrow emission lines. However, the decoupling depends on how well the IFS spatially resolves the PSF, and on the relative flux intensity of the HG-AGN. Therefore, the method is ideal for disentangling the bright-flux contribution from AGN-dominated spectra.

 - **Abstract**
 While WISE is the largest, best quality infrared all-sky survey to date, a smaller coverage mission, Spitzer, was designed to have better sensitivity and spatial resolution at similar wavelengths. Confusion and contamination in WISE data result in discrepancies between them. We present a novel approach to work with WISE measurements with the goal of maintaining both its high coverage and vast amount of data while taking full advantage of the higher sensitivity and spatial resolution of Spitzer. We have applied machine learning (ML) techniques to a complete WISE data sample of open cluster members, using a training set of paired data from high-quality Spitzer Enhanced Imaging Products (SEIP), MIPS and IRAC, and allWISE catalogs, W1 (3.4 {\mu}m) to W4 (22 {\mu}m) bands. We have tested several ML regression models with the aim of predicting mid-infrared fluxes at MIPS1 (24 {\mu}m) and IRAC4 (8 {\mu}m) bands from WISE fluxes and quality flags. In addition, to improve the prediction quality, we have implemented feature selection techniques to remove irrelevant WISE variables. We have notably enhanced WISE detection capabilities, mostly at lowest magnitudes, which previously showed the largest discrepancies with Spitzer. In our particular case, extremely randomized trees was found to be the best algorithm to predict mid-infrared fluxes from WISE variables. We have tested our results in the SED of members of IC 348. We show discrepancies in the measurements of Spitzer and WISE and demonstrate the good concordance of our predicted fluxes with the real ones. ML is a fast and powerful tool that can be used to find hidden relationships between datasets, as the ones that exist between WISE and Spitzer fluxes. We believe this approach could be employed for other samples from the allWISE catalog with SEIP positional counterparts, and in other astrophysical studies with analogous discrepancies.

 - **Abstract**
 The Surface Photometry and Accurate Rotation Curves (SPARC) database has provided the community with mass models for 175 nearby galaxies, allowing different research teams to test different dark matter models, galaxy evolution models, and modified gravity theories. Extensive tests, however, are hampered by the somewhat heterogeneous nature of the HI rotation curves and the limited sample size of SPARC. To overcome these limitations, we are working on BIG-SPARC, a new database that consists of about 4000 galaxies with HI datacubes from public telescope archives (APERTIF, ASKAP, ATCA, GMRT, MeerKAT, VLA, and WSRT) and near infrared photometry from WISE. For these galaxies, we will provide homogeneously derived HI rotation curves, surface brightness profiles, and mass models. BIG-SPARC is expected to increase the size of its predecessor by a factor of more than 20. This is a necessary step to prepare for the additional order of magnitude increase in sample size expected from ongoing and future HI surveys with the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) and its pathfinders

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the influence of interactions between dark matter (DM) and dark energy (DE) on the cosmic evolution of the Universe within a viscous dark energy (VDE) framework. Moving beyond traditional interacting dark energy (IDE) models, we propose a generalized IDE model adaptable to diverse IDE scenarios via IDE coupling parameters. In order to investigate deviations from $\Lambda$CDM across cosmic epochs by highlighting how viscous and the interactions between DM and DE impact cosmic density and expansion rates, we consider a model agnostic form of VDE. Eventually we perform a Bayesian analysis using the Union 2.1 Supernova Ia dataset and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to obtain optimal values of model parameters. This comprehensive analysis provides insights about the interplay between viscous and IDE in shaping the Universe's expansion history.
#### Eppur si muove: Evidence of disc precession or a sub-milliparsec SMBH binary in the QPE-emitting galaxy GSN 069

 - **Abstract**
 X-ray quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are intense soft X-ray bursts from the nuclei of nearby low-mass galaxies typically lasting about one hour and repeating every few. Their physical origin remains debated, although so-called impacts models in which a secondary orbiting body pierces through the accretion disc around the primary supermassive black hole (SMBH) in an extreme mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI) system are considered promising. In this work, we study the QPE timing properties of GSN 069, the first galactic nucleus in which QPEs were identified, primarily focusing on Observed minus Calculated (O-C) diagrams. The O-C data in GSN 069 are consistent with a super-orbital modulation on tens of days whose properties do not comply with the impacts model. We suggest that rigid precession of a misaligned accretion disc or, alternatively, the presence of a second SMBH forming a sub-milliparsec binary with the inner EMRI is needed to reconcile the model with the data. In both cases, the quiescent accretion disc emission should also be modulated on similar timescales. Current X-ray monitoring indicates that this might be the case, although a longer baseline of higher-cadence observations is needed to confirm the tentative X-ray flux periodicity on firm statistical grounds. Future dedicated monitoring campaigns will be crucial to test the overall impacts plus modulation model in GSN 069, and to distinguish between the two proposed modulating scenarios. If our interpretation is correct, QPEs in GSN 069 represent the first electromagnetic detection of a short-period EMRI system in an external galaxy, opening the way to future multi-messenger astronomical observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Pulsar timing array observations have found evidence for an isotropic gravitational wave background with the Hellings-Downs angular correlations, expected from general relativity. This interpretation hinges on the measured shape of the angular correlations, which is predominately quadrupolar under general relativity. Here we explore a more flexible parameterization: we expand the angular correlations into a sum of Legendre polynomials and use a Bayesian analysis to constrain their coefficients with the 15-year pulsar timing data set collected by the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav). When including Legendre polynomials with multipoles $\ell \geq 2$, we only find a significant signal in the quadrupole with an amplitude consistent with general relativity and non-zero at the $\sim 95\%$ confidence level and a Bayes factor of 200. When we include multipoles $\ell \leq 1$, the Bayes factor evidence for quadrupole correlations decreases by more than an order of magnitude due to evidence for a monopolar signal at approximately 4 nHz which has also been noted in previous analyses of the NANOGrav 15-year data. Further work needs to be done in order to better characterize the properties of this monopolar signal and its effect on the evidence for quadrupolar angular correlations.
#### On the nature of LOFAR RMs and new constraints on magnetic fields in cosmic filaments and on magnetogenesis scenarios

 - **Abstract**
 The measurement of magnetic fields in cosmic web filaments can be used to reveal the magnetogenesis of the Universe. In previous work, we produced first estimates of the field strength and its redshift evolution using the Faraday Rotation Measure (RM) catalogue of extragalactic background sources at low frequency obtained with LOFAR observations. Here we refine our analysis by selecting sources with low Galactic RM, which reduces its residual contamination. We also conduct a comprehensive analysis of the different contributions to the extragalactic RMs along the line of sight, and confirm that they are dominated by the cosmic filaments component, with only 21 percent originating in galaxy clusters and the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of galaxies. We find a possible hint of a shock at the virial radius of massive galaxies. We also find that the fractional polarization of background sources might be a valuable CGM tracer. The newly selected RMs have a steeper evolution with redshift than previously found. The field strength in filaments ($B_f$) and its evolution are estimated assuming $B_f$ evolves as a power-law $B_f=B_{f,0}\,(1+z)^\alpha$. Our analysis finds an average strength at $z=0$ of $B_{f,0} =11$--15~nG, with an error of 4 nG, and a slope $\alpha=2.3$--$2.6 \pm 0.5$, which is steeper than what we previously found. The comoving field has a slope of $\beta=$ [0.3, 0.6$]\pm 0.5$ that is consistent with being invariant with redshift. Primordial magnetogenesis scenarios are favoured by our data, together with a sub-dominant astrophysical-origin RM component increasing with redshift.
#### Comet 289P/Blanpain: Near-Perihelion Activity and the Phoenicids

 - **Abstract**
 We present NEOWISE observations of Jupiter family comet 289P/Blanpain, the parent body of the Phoenicid meteoroid stream. Near-infrared images at 3.4$\mu$m ($W1$) and 4.6$\mu$m ($W2$) were obtained near perihelion on two occasions: UT 2019-10-30 (inbound, heliocentric distance $R_{\rm h}$ = 1.20 au) and UT 2020-01-11/12 (outbound, $R_{\rm h}$ = 1.01 au). To assess faint activity, we establish constraints on dust production driven by the limited sublimating area of water ice, based on studies of the 1956 Phoenicids. The ejected dust mass is $M_{\rm d}$ = 4100 $\pm$ 200 kg (inbound) and 1700 $\pm$ 200 kg (outbound), respectively. The dust production rates are $Q_{\rm dust}$ = 0.01$-$0.02 kg s$^{-1}$, corresponding to dust-to-gas production ratio 2 $\leqslant\,f_{\rm dg}\,\leqslant$ 6. The resulting fractional active area, $f_{\rm A}$ = 3.8 $\pm$ 1.9 $\times 10^{-5}$, is the smallest yet reported. The absence of 4.6$\mu$m ($W2$) excess suggests that 289P contains negligible amounts of CO$_2$ and CO. Time-resolved analysis of weighted mean of $W1$ and $W2$ magnitudes finds a distinctive peak amplitude in the light curve having a rotational period $P_{\rm rot}$ = 8.8536 $\pm$ 0.3860 hr, however, further verification is needed. The perihelion-normalized nongravitational acceleration, $\alpha_{\rm NG}^\prime$ = 3.1 $\times$ 10$^{-6}$, is approximately an order of magnitude smaller than the trend observed for well-studied comets, consistent with weak outgassing. Current dust production from 289P, regardless of plausible assumptions for particle size and distribution, is an order of magnitude too small to produce the Phoenicid stream within its $\sim$300 yr dynamical lifetime. This suggests another mass supply, probably in 1743$-$1819, rapid rotational destruction of a sub-km precursor body, resulting in fragments equaling the mass of an object with radius $\sim$ 100 m.

 - **Abstract**
 Green Peas (GPs) and blueberry galaxies (BBs) are thought to be local analogs ($z<$0.1) of high redshift Ly$\alpha$ emitters. H I study of these can help us understand the star formation in the primordial Universe. In this Letter, we present the results of H I 21 cm study of 28 high specific star formation rate (sSFR $\gtrsim$10$^{-8}$ yr$^{-1}$) BBs at $z\lesssim$0.05 with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope. We report significant H I detection towards two BBs namely J1026+0426 and J1132+0809, and discuss possible H I contribution from neighboring galaxies. The median 3$\sigma$ upper limit of $\sim$2.0$\times$10$^{8}$ M$_{\odot}$ was obtained on H I mass for galaxies with nondetections. We find BBs tend to have lower H I-to-stellar mass ratio or gas fraction ($f_{\rm HI}$) than expected from $f_{\rm HI}$-sSFR and $f_{\rm HI}$-$M_{\ast}$ relations for main-sequence galaxies. The BBs also have a median 3$\sigma$ upper limit on H I gas depletion time scale ($\tau_{\rm HI}$) $\sim$0.5 Gyr, about 1 order of magnitude lower than $\tau_{\rm HI}$ for local main-sequence galaxies. We find a significantly low H I detection rate of 2/28 (7.1$^{+9.4}_{-4.6}$ \%) towards these galaxies, which is similar to previous H I studies of low redshift GPs of high ionization parameter indicator, O32 $\equiv$O[{\sc iii}]$\lambda$5007/O[{\sc ii}]$\lambda$3727 ratios $\gtrsim$10.
