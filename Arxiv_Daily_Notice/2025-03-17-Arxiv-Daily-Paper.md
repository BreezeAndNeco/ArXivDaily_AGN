#### Insights into the Long-term behavior of the optical polarization from the blazar 1ES 1959+650

 - **Abstract**
 A high degree of linear polarization measured in the optical emission is an important observational feature of blazars. It provides strong evidence of the presence of relativistic particles and magnetic field ordering in the non-thermal emission regions of blazars owing to the synchrotron nature of low energy radiation. Thus, the polarization studies of blazars are emerging as a promising approach to probe the particle acceleration and the physical processes involved in their broadband emission. In this work, we investigate the behavior of the optical polarization of the blazar 1ES 1959+650 measured over a decade using the spectropolarimetry (SPOL) at the Steward Observatory. We use measurements of the degree of linear polarization and angle of polarization in the wavelength range 500 - 700 nm available during the period October 1, 2008 and June 30, 2018 (MJD 54739 - 58299) from the SPOL observations. Near simultaneous photometry data in the R and V bands are also used to study the optical emission from the source. The maximum degree of linear polarization, measured as $\sim$ 8.5$\%$, is significantly larger than the long term average value of $\sim$ 4.6$\%$. Analysis of the light curves indicates that the optical emission from the blazar 1ES 1959+650 is highly variable and variability in the degree of linear polarization can be quantified by a fractional variability amplitude of $\sim$ 39$\%$ over the period of about ten years. Long term optical emission in the R and V bands is very weakly anti-correlated with the degree of linear polarization. Modelling of the polarization due to the synchrotron emission suggests that the observed degree of linear polarization can be broadly reproduced by a power law distribution of relativistic electrons gyrating in a spherical emission region permeated with chaotic and ordered magnetic fields.

 - **Abstract**
 The most powerful cosmic engines in our universe are fueled by compact objects. These objects accrete large amounts of material and eject matter in the form of jets. Recent groundbreaking discoveries of gravitational waves from merging compact objects and the direct imaging of the black hole shadows with the Event Horizon Telescope represent major steps forward in our understanding of such systems. However, there exists a large population of stellar-mass compact objects in our own Galaxy, present in X-ray binaries (XRBs), which provide better laboratories with which to study the processes of accretion and ejection. XRBs produce highly variable emissions on timescales ranging from milliseconds (for light-travel time in the region close to the compact object) to weeks (governing the mass-inflow process). Therefore, high-time resolution observations can be a powerful tool to study these systems. However, as XRBs emit across the electromagnetic spectrum, a suite of facilities is needed to take full advantage of these techniques. The PRIMA Observatory (PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics) will provide unique access to a wavelength range that has not been sampled in XRBs, representing an exciting new possibility for characterizing rapid time-domain phenomena of XRBs (and potentially other transient sources) in the far-infrared regime.
#### Lévy Flights and Leaky Boxes: Anomalous Diffusion of Cosmic Rays

 - **Abstract**
 In classical diffusion, particle step-sizes have a Gaussian distribution. However, in superdiffusion, they have power-law tails, with transport dominated by rare, long Lévy flights. Similarly, if the time interval between scattering events has power-law tails, subdiffusion occurs. Both forms of anomalous diffusion are seen in cosmic ray (CR) particle tracking simulations in turbulent magnetic fields. They also likely occur if CRs are scattered by discrete intermittent structures. Anomalous diffusion mimics a scale-dependent diffusion coefficient, with potentially wide-ranging consequences. However, the finite size of galaxies implies an upper bound on step-sizes before CRs escape. This truncation results in eventual convergence to Gaussian statistics by the central limit theorem. Using Monte-Carlo simulations, we show that this occurs in both standard finite-thickness halo models, or when CR diffusion transitions to advection or streaming-dominated regimes. While optically thick intermittent structures produce power-law trapping times and thus subdiffusion, gaussianization also eventually occurs on timescales longer than the maximum trapping time. Anomalous diffusion is a transient, and converges to standard diffusion on the (usually short) timescale of particle escape, either from confining structures (subdiffusion), or the system as a whole (superdiffusion). Thus, standard assumptions of classical diffusion are physically justified in most applications, despite growing simulation evidence for anomalous diffusion. However, if escape times are long, this is no longer true. For instance, anomalous diffusion in the CGM or ICM would change CR pressure profiles. Finally, we show the standard diagnostic for anomalous diffusion, $\langle d^2 \rangle \propto t^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha \neq 1$, is not justified for truncated Lévy flights, and propose an alternative robust measure.

 - **Abstract**
 Collisionless electron-ion shocks are fundamental to astrophysical plasmas, yet their behavior in strong magnetic fields remains poorly understood. Using Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations with the SHARP-1D3V code, we investigate the role of the ion magnetization parameter $\sigma_i$ in parallel shock transitions. Strongly magnetized converging flows ($\sigma_i > 1$) exhibit lower density compression ratios ($R \sim 2$), smaller entropy jumps, and suppressed particle acceleration, while maintaining pressure anisotropy stability due to conserved perpendicular temperatures across the shock, alongside increased parallel temperatures. In contrast, weakly magnetized shocks drive downstream mirror and firehose instabilities due to ion temperature anisotropy, which are suppressed in strongly magnetized cases. Additionally, weakly magnetized shocks exhibit the onset of a supra-thermal population induced by shock-drift acceleration, with most of the upstream kinetic energy thermalized for both electrons and ions in the downstream region. Our results demonstrate that perpendicular temperatures for both species are conserved in strongly magnetized cases and highlight deviations from standard ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) behavior. These findings provide critical insights into the role of magnetic fields in parallel collisionless astrophysical shocks.

 - **Abstract**
 We propose that a hierarchical shock model$\unicode{x2014}$including supernova remnant shocks, galactic wind termination shocks, and accretion shocks around cosmic filaments and galaxy clusters$\unicode{x2014}$can naturally explain the cosmic ray spectrum from ~1 GeV up to ~200 EeV. While this framework applies to the entire cosmic ray spectrum, in this work, we focus on its implications for ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). We perform a hydrodynamic cosmological simulation to investigate the power processed at shocks around clusters and filaments. The downstream flux from nearby shocks around the local filament accounts for the softer, lower-energy extragalactic component around the ankle, and the upstream escaping flux from nearby clusters accounts for the transition to a hard spectral component at the highest energies. This interpretation is in agreement with UHECR observations. We suggest that a combination of early-Universe galactic outflows, cosmic ray streaming instabilities, and a small-scale turbulent dynamo can increase magnetic fields enough to attain the required rigidities. Our simulation suggests that the available volume-averaged power density of accretion shocks exceeds the required UHECR luminosity density by three orders of magnitude. We show that microgauss magnetic fields at these shocks could explain both the origin of UHECRs and the as-yet unidentified source of the diffuse radio synchrotron background below 10 GHz. The shock-accelerated electrons produce a hard radio background without overproducing diffuse inverse Compton emission. These results motivate further observational tests with upcoming facilities to help distinguish accretion shocks from other UHECR sources.
#### Exploring the Relationship Between Stellar Mass, Metallicity, and Star Formation Rate at $z \sim 2.3$ in KBSS-MOSFIRE

 - **Abstract**
 The metal enrichment of a galaxy is determined by the cycle of baryons in outflows, inflows, and star formation. The relative contribution and timescale of each process sets the relationship between stellar mass, metallicity, and the star formation rate (SFR). In the local universe, galaxies evolve in an equilibrium state where the timescales on which SFR and metallicity vary are comparable, and define a surface in mass-metallicity-SFR space known as the Fundamental Metallicity Relation (FMR). However, high-redshift observations suggest that this state of equilibrium may not persist throughout cosmic time. Using galaxies from the Keck Baryonic Structure Survey (KBSS) observed with MOSFIRE, we explore the relationship between stellar mass, gas-phase oxygen abundance, and SFR at $z \sim 2.3$. Across strong-line calibrations and SFR calculation methods, KBSS galaxies are inconsistent with the locally-defined FMR. We use both parametric and non-parametric methods of exploring a mass-metallicity-SFR relation. When using a parametric approach, we find no significant reduction mass-metallicity relation scatter when folding in SFR as a third parameter, although a non-parametric approach reveals that there could be a weak, redshift-dependent anticorrelation between residual gas-phase oxygen abundance, and SFR. Injection-recovery tests show that a significant reduction in scatter requires a stronger anticorrelation between SFR and residual metallicity. Our results suggest that the local FMR may not persist to $z \sim 2.3$, implying that $z \sim 2.3$ galaxies may not be in the equilibrium state described by the FMR and are more similar to higher redshift galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 Blast wave models are commonly used to model relativistic outflows from ultra-relativistic gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), but are also applied to lower Lorentz factor ejections from X-ray binaries (XRBs). Here we revisit the physics of blast waves and reverse shocks in these systems and explore the similarities and differences between the ultra-relativistic ($\Gamma \gg 1$) and moderately relativistic ($\Gamma \sim$ a few) regimes. We first demonstrate that the evolution of the blast wave radius as a function of the observer frame time is recovered in the on-axis ultra-relativistic limit from a general energy and radius blast wave evolution, emphasizing that XRB ejections are off-axis, moderately relativistic cousins of GRB afterglows. We show that, for fixed blast wave or ejecta energy, reverse shocks cross the ejecta much later (earlier) on in the evolution for less (more) relativistic systems, and find that reverse shocks are much longer-lived in XRBs and off-axis GRBs compared to on-axis GRBs. Reverse shock crossing should thus typically finish after $\sim10-100$ days (in the observer frame) in XRB ejections. This characteristic, together with their moderate Lorentz factors and resolvable core separations, makes XRB ejections unique laboratories for shock and particle acceleration physics. We discuss the impact of geometry and lateral spreading on our results, explore how to distinguish between different shock components, and comment on the implications for GRB and XRB environments. Additionally, we argue that identification of reverse shock signatures in XRBs could provide an independent constraint on the ejecta Lorentz factor.

 - **Abstract**
 This work investigates the multi-wavelength properties of 165 4FGL blazars from the Fermi-LAT fourth source catalogue, looking for with counterparts in the Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) First Large Absorption Survey in HI (FLASH) continuum. Using high-resolution data from FLASH and complementary radio datasets, combined with archival Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observations, we perform detailed spectral energy distribution (SED) analyses across cm-to-mm wavelengths. Our findings reveal that most blazars exhibit re-triggered peaked spectra, indicative of emission dominated by a single emitting region. Additionally, we identify strong correlations between radio and gamma-ray luminosities, highlighting the significant role of relativistic jets in these active galactic nuclei. The inclusion of spectroscopic redshifts from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and Gaia enables a comprehensive analysis of the evolutionary trends and physical characteristics of the sources. Furthermore, we report a tight Radio-X-ray Correlation for Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars, contrasting with the more scattered behaviour observed in BL-Lacs, reflecting their distinct accretion and jet-driving mechanisms. These results provide critical insights into the physics of blazars and their environments, paving the way for future studies with next-generation facilities like the SKA Observatory (SKAO) for radio observations and Cherenkov Telescope Array for gamma-ray studies.
#### LiDO: Exploring the Stable Plutino Parameter Space

 - **Abstract**
 We present a publicly available, high-resolution, filled-parameter-space synthetic distribution of the Plutinos, trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs) librating in the 3:2 mean-motion resonance with Neptune, with particular focus on the Plutinos simultaneously Kozai-librating. This synthetic distribution was built in preparation for results from the Large inclination Distant Objects (LiDO) Survey, which pointed at locations on the sky where Kozai Plutinos are predicted to come to pericenter and are thus most easily detected in magnitude-limited surveys. Although we do not expect the full stable parameter-space presented here to be populated with real TNOs, it provides a useful starting point for comparison with Neptune migration simulations and debiased observational results. Our new stable parameter space synthetic distribution of fictitious Plutinos is consistent with previous works, and we build on past results by focusing on the behavior of Kozai Plutinos over 4Gyr integrations. We find that 95% of 4Gyr stable Kozai Plutinos remain in the same omega-libration island for the entire integration. This provides an interesting diagnostic opportunity: any asymmetry in the true number of 4Gyr stable Kozai Plutinos in the two omega-libration islands must be caused by the details of emplacement during giant planet migration. Through analysis of previously published Neptune migration models, we show that the intrinsic fraction of Plutinos captured into Kozai depends on Neptune's migration speed and mode. Combining the filled-parameter-space synthetic distribution with future migration simulations and the results of the carefully characterized LiDO survey will enable interpretation of the intrinsic orbital distribution of the Kozai and non-Kozai Plutinos.

 - **Abstract**
 We present particle-in-cell simulations of one dimensional relativistic electromagnetic shocks in a uniform magnetic field, for a range of magnetic field strengths, plasma temperatures and numerical initial conditions. We show that the particle energy distributions of these shocks can develop a state of population inversion in the precursor and shock regions, which may allow for synchrotron maser (or maser-like, coherent) emission. Our set-up is applicable to conditions expected in models of fast radio bursts and therefore lends credence to the synchrotron maser model for these transients. We also show, for the first time, how a newly developed ``analytic particle pusher'' for kinetic simulations gives similar results to the commonly-used Boris pusher, but for larger timesteps and without the need to resolve the gyro-radius and gyro-period of the system. This has important implications for modeling astrophysical plasmas in extreme magnetic fields as well as for bridging scales between kinetic and fluid regimes.

 - **Abstract**
 Freshly injected interstellar Pickup Ions (PUIs) are expected to exhibit a simple, torus-shaped velocity distribution function. The PUI velocity in the solar wind frame depends on the velocity of the interstellar neutral (ISN) population at the pick-up position. In this study, we compare PUI velocity distributions measured by the PLasma And SupraThermal Ion Composition (PLASTIC) instrument over the full orbit of Solar TErestrial RElations Observatory-Ahead (STEREO-A) directly. We define a new position-independent velocity measure for PUIs that takes the local direction of the interstellar neutral inflow into account. The resulting new PUI velocity measure corrects thereby for the position-dependent contribution of the ISN velocity. Pitch-angle distributions are then analysed depending on the magnetic-field azimuthal angle for different orbital positions and different values of the PUI velocity measure. The new PUI velocity measure shows an approximately constant cut-off over the complete orbit of STEREO-A. A torus signature is visible everywhere. Therein, a broadening of the torus signature outside the focusing cone and crescent regions and for lower velocity measure observed. In addition, we illustrate the symmetry between the primary and secondary ISN trajectory in the vicinity of the focusing cone. A torus signature associated with freshly injected PUIs is visible over the complete orbit of STEREO-A with increased density in the focusing cone. At least remnants of a torus signature remain for smaller values of the PUI velocity measure. The new velocity measure also prepares for PUI studies with Solar Orbiter.
#### Near-infrared Spectral Properties of Type Ib/Ic Supernova Progenitors and Implications for JWST and NGRST Observations

 - **Abstract**
 While about 20 Type II supernova progenitors have been identified using optical data from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), direct detection of type Ib/Ic supernova (SN Ib/Ic) progenitors remains challenging due to their faint optical brightness and highly obscured environments. This study aims to investigate the detection limits and advantages of near-infrared (near-IR) observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (NGRST) for the detection of SN Ib/Ic progenitors. The spectral energy distributions of SN Ib/Ic progenitor models with various masses, chemical compositions, and mass-loss rates are calculated with the non-LTE radiative transfer code CMFGEN. We then assess the detectability of SN Ib/Ic progenitors using near-IR filters from the JWST and the NGRST, comparing the results to the capabilities of the HST. Our analysis indicates that near-IR observations significantly outperform the HST in detecting SN Ib/Ic progenitors when considering the effect of extinction. Near-IR magnitudes also provide better constraints on the mass-loss rates of progenitors because of the free-free emission from the wind matter. Additionally, near-IR magnitudes and color-color diagrams are effective in distinguishing SN Ib/Ic progenitors from possible companion and/or background objects. This study suggests that the JWST and the NGRST can play a crucial role in advancing our understanding of SN Ib/Ic progenitors by improving detectability and offering better constraints on progenitor properties. We emphasize that observations with exposure times exceeding 1 hour would be needed to detect typical SNe Ib/Ic progenitors at distances greater than 10 Mpc.
#### Dot to dot: high-$z$ little red dots in $M_{\rm bh}$-$M_{\rm \star}$ diagrams with galaxy-morphology-specific scaling relations and nuclear star clusters

 - **Abstract**
 High-redshift little red dots (LRDs) detected with the James Webb Space Telescope are considered the cores of emerging galaxies. For the first time, we compare LRDs in $M_{\rm bh}$-$M_{\star}$ diagrams with an array of $z=0$ galaxy-morphology-dependent scaling relations, along with the $M_{\rm bh}$-$M_{\rm \star,nsc}$ relation for nuclear star clusters. The $M_{\rm bh}$-$M_{\rm \star,sph}$ relations for spheroidal stellar systems are characterised by a nearly parallel set of quasi-quadratic (or steeper) distributions that are known to trace the `punctuated equilibrium' of galaxies, reflecting their stepwise growth in black hole mass and merger-built bulge/spheroid mass. We show that LRDs are not equivalent to nuclear star clusters, with the latter having higher $M_{\rm bh}/M_{\star}$ ratios. However, the least massive LRDs exhibit similar $M_{\rm bh}$ and $M_{\rm \star,gal}$ values as ultracompact dwarf (UCD) galaxies. We show that the LRDs span the $M_{\rm bh}$-$M_{\rm \star,gal}$ diagram from UCD galaxies to primaeval lenticular galaxies. In contrast, spiral galaxies and the subset of major-merger-built early-type galaxies define offset relations. Additionally, we observe that low-$z$ galaxies with active galactic nuclei align with the steep black hole scaling relations for disc galaxies defined by primarily inactive galaxies with directly measured black hole masses. Collectively, this highlights the benefits of considering galaxy morphology, which reflects their accretion and merger history, to understand the coevolution of galaxies and their black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 The 8 April 2024 total solar eclipse (TSE) provides a unique opportunity to study the solar corona. This work presents our prediction of the solar corona at the time of the eclipse based on magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modeling performed with the Alfvén Wave Solar Model-Realtime (AWSoM-R) in the Space Weather Modeling Framework, developed at the University of Michigan. We performed multiple simulations made with data input in the form of synchronic magnetograms from four sources, i.e., ADAPT-GONG, Lockheed Martin ESFAM, HipFT and NSO-NRT magnetograms. Simulations also include a higher-resolution model and a post-eclipse model incorporating newly emerged active regions. Our study fundamentally focuses on the limitations imposed by the lack of global solar observations, particularly on how these limitations affect coronal simulations. Specifically, we examine how differences among the magnetograms and the absence of observations from the east limb, due to the Sun's rotation, impact the accuracy of the predicted coronal structures. We synthesized a variety of representative observables, including the white-light and extreme-ultraviolet images from each model, and compared them with observations. The synthesized observables show remarkable differences because of the distinct magnetic coronal topologies, which stem from the varied magnetic flux distributions and the gaps in observational coverage. Our findings emphasize the need for comprehensive and multi-satellite magnetic field observations to improve future solar corona predictions.
#### ChemicalUniverseMachine I: Uncovering the Cosmic Evolution of Metals in the Galaxy-ISM-CGM Ecosystem

 - **Abstract**
 We present an empirical chemical evolution model that explains the distribution of metals in the interstellar medium (ISM) and the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of galaxies based on the UniverseMachine and NeutralUniverseMachine models in the framework of $\Lambda$CDM structure formation. We parameterize the fractions of outflowing metals returned and mixed into the multi-phase ISM of the star-forming regions ($f_{\rm H2}$) and into the neutral gas regions ($f_{\rm HI}$); metal production, transfer, and dilution are caused by star formation, galaxy mergers, and gas inflow from the inter-galactic medium, respectively, with rates determined by the (Neutral)UniverseMachine models. Using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm, we explore the posterior distributions of metal return and mixing consistent with observed mass-metallicity relations in HII regions (at $0<z<5$), HI damped Lyman-alpha systems (at $1<z<4$), and the CGM (at $z=0$). We find that the fraction of metals present in the ISM, $f_{\rm H2}+f_{\rm HI}$, increases with halo mass from $\sim20$\% at $10^{10}M_\odot$ to $\sim80$\% at $10^{13}M_\odot$. These fractions increase mildly at higher redshifts, to $\sim30$\% at $10^{10}M_\odot$ and $\sim80$\% at $10^{13}M_\odot$ at $z=5$. Interestingly, there is no significant redshift evolution of $f_{\rm H2}+f_{\rm HI}$ at fixed circular velocity, suggesting that metal distribution between the ISM and CGM is universally determined by the halo potential well depth. CGM metal enrichment is thus slow in high-$z$ halos with deep potential wells. While $f_{\rm H2}$ monotonically increases with halo mass, $f_{\rm HI}$ peaks at $\sim10^{12}-10^{13} M_\odot$, suggesting that reinfall may be inefficient in larger-mass halos.

 - **Abstract**
 Radiative transfer effects need to be taken into account when analysing spectral line observations. When the data are not sufficient for detailed modelling, simpler methods are needed. The escape probability formalism (EPF) is one such tool. We wish to quantify the model errors in the EPF analysis of interstellar clouds and cores. We introduce PEP, a parallel program for calculating fast EPF parameters quickly. We model full radiative transfer to generate synthetic observations for various cloud models. These are examined with the PEP program, and their results are compared to the actual beam-averaged kinetic temperatures, column densities, and volume densities. PEP enables the calculations of even millions of parameter combinations in a matter of seconds. However, the simple assumptions of EPF can lead to significant errors. In the tests the errors were typically within a factor of two, but could in some cases reach an order of magnitude. The model errors are thus similar or even larger than the statistical errors caused by the typical observational noise. Due to degeneracies, parameter combinations are better constrained than the individual parameters. The model errors could be reduced by using full radiative transfer modelling. However, in the absence of full knowledge of the source structure, the errors are difficult to quantify. We also present a method for approximate handling of hyperfine structure lines in EPF calculations. Both the observational statistical errors and the model errors need to be considered when estimating the reliability of EPF results. Full radiative transfer modelling is needed to better understand the true uncertainties.

 We investigate the relationships between the properties of the cool circumgalactic medium (CGM), traced by Ca II absorption lines, and those of galaxies at $z<0.4$ by utilizing a galaxy-quasar pair sample compiled from the Year 1 data of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). This large dataset, containing $\sim 900,000$ galaxy-quasar pairs within $200\,\rm kpc$, enables us to obtain composite spectra with sensitivity reaching to $\text{mÅ}$ level and to explore the Ca II absorption as a function of stellar mass, SFR, redshift, and galaxy types, including AGNs. Our results show a positive correlation between the absorption strength and stellar mass of star-forming galaxies with $\langle W_{0}^{\rm Ca\ II}\rangle \propto M_{*}^{0.5}$ over three orders of magnitude in stellar mass from $\sim 10^{8}$ to $10^{11} \, M_{\odot}$, while such a mass dependence is weaker for quiescent galaxies. For galaxies with similar mass, we find that Ca II absorption is stronger around star-forming galaxies than around quiescent galaxies especially within the inner regions ($<30\,\rm kpc$) of the halos. Among star-forming galaxies, the Ca II absorption further correlates with SFR, following $\propto \mathrm{SFR^{0.3}}$. However, in contrast to the results at higher redshifts, we find that stronger absorption around star-forming galaxies is not preferentially observed along the minor axis of galaxies, indicating a possible redshift evolution of CGM dynamics resulting from galactic feedback. Moreover, no significant difference between the properties of the cool gas around AGNs and galaxies is detected. Finally, we measure the absorption profiles with respect to the virial radius of dark matter halos and estimate the total Ca II mass in the CGM. The results show that the CGM contains a metal mass comparable to the metal mass in the ISM of galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a new method for extracting bulk motion gases in the disk of a galaxy from HI data cubes, offering improvements over classical techniques like moment analysis and line profile fitting. Our approach decomposes the line-of-sight velocity profiles into multiple Gaussian components, which are then classified into (underlying and dominant) bulk and non-bulk motion gases based on criteria such as HI surface density, velocity dispersion, kinetic energy, and rotation velocity. A 2D tilted-ring analysis is employed to refine the kinematical parametres of the galaxy disk, ensuring robust extraction of the bulk motion gases. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method using the HI data cubes of NGC 4559 from the WSRT-HALOGAS survey, distinguishing between bulk and non-bulk gas components. From this, we find that approximately 50% of the HI gas in NGC 4559 is classified as non-bulk, possibly linked to processes such as stellar feedback. This work provides a robust framework for analysing HI kinematics of galaxies from high sensitivity HI observations of galaxies like MeerKAT-MHONGOOSE and FAST-FEASTS and allows us to best exploit the kinematic information of the complex gas dynamics within galaxy disks.

 - **Abstract**
 Coronal lines are forbidden emission lines with a ionisation potential $\chi\gtrsim100\,{\rm eV}$. They are linked to energetic phenomena triggered by AGNs in the circumnuclear medium. We present the first high-angular-resolution integral-field analysis of the $[{\rm Fe\,VII}]\,\lambda6087$ coronal line in a sample of four nearby low-inclination Seyfert galaxies (three of Type 1 and one of Type 2). The data were obtained with the adaptive-optics-assisted mode of MUSE, and have angular resolutions of $0.06-0.18\,{\rm arcsec}$, allowing us to probe regions down to a few tens of parsecs in size. In three of the objects, we find a resolved coronal emission in a relatively compact configuration ($\lesssim200\,{\rm pc}$ in radius). The coronal emission is smooth and symmetric with respect to the centre of the galaxy, except for one object where an off-nucleus clump of emission is detected. Through the use of spectroastrometry we find that the $[{\rm Fe\,VII}]$ outflow of the Type 2 AGN host has a redshifted and a blueshifted component whose centroids are separated by $\sim20\,{\rm pc}$. We interpret this as evidence that some of the coronal emission comes from the inner part of a biconic outflow, also seen in low-ionisation lines. Similar $[{\rm Fe\,VII}]$ properties are found in two of the Type 1 AGN hosts, but with a much smaller separation between the centroids of the lobes of the outflow ($<7\,{\rm pc}$). This could be due to the foreshortening of the axis of the bicone in Type 1 objects. We also studied the spectrum of the unresolved nuclear source and found that in three out of four galaxies a fraction of at least $\sim60\%$ of the $[\textrm{Fe VII}]$ emission has kinematics similar to those of $[{\rm O\,III}]$. We conclude that part of the coronal emission within the inner few tens of parsecs is co-spatial and shares kinematics with the outflows as traced by lower-ionisation lines.

 - **Abstract**
 The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Galactic Center (GC) region of the Milky Way contains a substantial fraction of the molecular mass of the Galaxy >10e7 solar masses yet exhibits an order of magnitude lower star formation efficiency (SFE) than expected given the high densities found in this region. There are multiple possible explanations for the depressed SFE in the CMZ, like feedback, strong turbulence, longer free-fall timescales, and high magnetic field strengths. It is currently unclear which of these mechanisms is the dominant inhibitor of star formation in the CMZ. It is important to understand the star formation process in the extreme environment of the CMZ because it is the only Galactic nuclear region we are able to study at high spatial resolutions with current observatories. One way to determine the relative importance of the different SFE inhibiting mechanisms is through multi-spatial and multi-frequency polarimetric observations of the CMZ. Such observations will provide insight into the behavior of the magnetic field in this unique environment. These observations will complement radio observations of non-thermal structures revealing the magnetic field morphology and polarization. The PRobe far--Infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA) will be uniquely capable of contributing to such explorations by providing unique resolutions and frequencies for polarimetric observations. The PRIMAger instrument will yield polarimetric observations covering the wavelength range 80 -- 261 um with beam sizes ranging from 11 -- 28'', capabilities that complement existing and upcoming observatories.

 - **Abstract**
 Astrophysical masers are widely used in star formation studies. In particular, they are valuable in investigations of high-mass star-forming regions that are difficult to observe at optical frequencies. We used multi-transition data to derive physical conditions in the immediate environment of forming high-mass stars. Simultaneous observations of two maser transitions, excited OH at 6.035 GHz and methanol at 6.668 GHz, were made using e-Merlin. Both transitions are radiatively pumped but prefer diverse physical conditions. We imaged ten high-mass star-forming sites with milliarcsecond angular resolution, identifying regions where excited OH and methanol masers coexist and where they avoid each other. Moreover, we identified circularly polarized Zeeman splitting pairs of the OH transition, estimating magnetic field strengths in the range from 0.2 to 10.6~mG. The detection of linearly polarized components enabled us to compare the directions of magnetic field vectors with the outflows coming from the young star-forming objects. We found that the two maser lines appeared to coexist in six high-mass star-forming regions, in cloudlets separated by up to 205~au. Where the lines show avoidance, this can be related to changes in dust and gas temperatures; we also found a few examples suggestive of a high gas density. In seven sources, Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests show the nonrandom relationship between the position angles of distribution of the two maser transitions. We did not obtain consistent results regarding the direction of the magnetic field and outflow.

 - **Abstract**
 Spiral jets are impulsive plasma ejections that typically show an apparent rotation motion. Their generation, however, is still nont understood thoroughly. Based on a high-resolution vector magnetogram form the Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager onboard Solar Orbiter, we constrcut a data-constrained three-dimensional (3D) MHD model, aiming to disclose the eruption mechanism of a tiny spiral jet at a moss region observed on March 3 2022. The initial configuration of the simulation consists of an extrapolated coronal magnetic field based on the vector magnetogram and an inserted unstable flux rope constructed by the Regularized Biot-Savart Laws method. Our results highlight the critical role of the fan-spine configuration in forming the spiral jet and confirm the collapse of the pre-existing magnetic null to a curved 3D current sheet where external reconnection takes places. It is further disclosed that the flux rope quickly moves upward, reconnecting with the field lines near the outer spine, thereby enabling the transfer of twist and cool material from the flux rope to the open field, giving rise to the tiny spiral jet we observed. The notable similarities between these characteristics and those for larger-scale jets suggest that spiral jets, regardless of their scale, essentially share the same eruption mechanism.

 - **Abstract**
 The high-mass X-ray binary Cygnus X-3 has been suggested for a long time to be a source of high-energy photons and neutrinos. In view of the increased sensitivity of current experiments, we examine the acceleration and interactions of high-energy cosmic rays (CRs) in this binary system, assuming that the compact object is a black hole. Using a test-particle approach in a Monte-Carlo framework, we employ as the basic CR acceleration mechanisms magnetic reconnection or this http URL order Fermi acceleration and diffusive shock acceleration. We find that in all three scenarios CRs can be accelerated beyond PeV energies. High-energy photons and neutrinos are produced as secondaries in photo-hadronic interactions of CRs on X-ray photons and in the scattering on gas from the wind of the companion star. Normalising the predicted photon flux to the excess flux observed by LHAASO at energies above PeV in the direction of Cygnus X-3, a CR acceleration efficiency of $10^{-3}$ is sufficient to power the required CR luminosity. Our results suggest that the PeV photon flux from Cygnus X-3 could be in a bright phase significantly increased relative to the average flux of the last years.

 - **Abstract**
 Strong magnetic fields in the core of red-giant branch stars are expected to suppress the amplitudes of the multipole modes. This occurs when the strength of the internal magnetic field approaches the critical field strength, at which the magnetic forces become comparable to the buoyancy. We performed Hamiltonian ray tracing simulations of magneto-gravity waves to investigate the suppression of the multipole modes in the presence of an internal dipole-like magnetic field. We took into account different stellar masses, metallicities, and ages, as well as various oscillation frequencies and spherical degrees. In particular, we estimated the trapped fraction, a measure of multipole mode suppression, which quantifies the fraction of mode energy in the core that is dissipated by the interaction with the magnetic field. Our results indicate that the trapped fraction can be described by a simple expression, which smoothly connects the regime without multipole mode suppression with the regime with complete suppression of the multipole modes. Crucially, the trapped fraction depends only on the ratio between the strength of the internal magnetic field and the critical field strength. Therefore, our expression for the trapped fraction provides a flexible tool that can be used, for example, to estimate the amount of multipole mode suppression as a star ascends the red-giant branch or to investigate the onset of the suppression in observed power spectral densities.

 - **Abstract**
 We derive Fe-abundance ratios of 6 galaxies at $z=9-12$ with $-22<M_{\mathrm{UV}}<-19$ whose JWST/NIRSpec spectra achieve very high signal-to-noise ratios, $\mathrm{SNR}=40-230$, at the rest-frame UV wavelength. We fit stellar synthesis model spectra to these JWST spectra, carefully masking out nebular emission, interstellar absorption, and non-iron stellar absorption lines, and obtain Fe-abundance ratios of $\mathrm{[Fe/H]}=-2-0$ for 4 galaxies and upper limits of $\mathrm{[Fe/H]}\sim-1$ for 2 galaxies. We compare these [Fe/H] values with the oxygen abundances of these galaxies ($7.2<12+\log{\mathrm{(O/H)}}<7.9$) in the same manner as previous studies of low-$z$ galaxies, and derive oxygen-to-iron abundance ratios [O/Fe]. We find that majority of (4 out of 6) galaxies are consistent with iron-poor abundance ratios ($\mathrm{[O/Fe]}\gtrsim0$) while that 2 out of 6 galaxies, GS-z11-0 and GN-z11, show Fe enhancements ($\mathrm{[O/Fe]}<0$), especially GS-z11-0 ($z=11.12$) with a Fe enhancement ($\mathrm{[O/Fe]}=-0.91_{-0.42}^{+0.35}$) beyond the solar-abundance ratio at $\sim3\sigma$. Because, unlike GS-z11-0, GN-z11 ($z=10.60$) may be an AGN, we constrain [O/Fe] via FeII emission under the assumption of AGN and confirm that the Fe enhancement is consistent even in the case of AGN. While [O/Fe] values of the majority of the galaxies are explained by the chemical enrichment of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), the Fe enhancements of GS-z11-0 and GN-z11 are puzzling. We develop chemical evolution models, and find that the iron enhancements against oxygen in GS-z11-0 and GN-z11 can be explained by 1) pair-instability supernovae/bright hypernovae with little contribution of CCSNe or 2) Type-Ia supernovae with short delay time ($\sim30-50$ Myr) with a top-light initial mass function.
#### Moving Plasma Structures and Possible Driving Mechanisms of Solar Microflares Observed with High-Resolution Coronal Imaging

 - **Abstract**
 Solar microflares are ubiquitous in the solar corona, yet their driving mechanisms remain a subject of ongoing debate. Using high-resolution coronal observations from the Solar Orbiter's Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI), we identified about a dozen distinct moving plasma structures (hereafter, `` tiny ejections'') originating from the centers of three homologous microflares out of four successive events. These tiny ejections propagate roughly perpendicular to the flaring loops. They often originate as dot-like structures with a length scale of approximately $10^{3}$ km. While these initial dot-like shapes are observable in EUI images, they remain undetectable in the images captured by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory. As they propagate, these dot-like structures consistently evolve into loop-like formations, possibly due to the heating of the surrounding magnetic field. Rather than being generated by a series of flux rope eruptions, the tiny ejections appear to result from small-angle magnetic reconnections within a bipolar field. Thus, the microflares associated with these ejections may be driven by magnetic reconnection within braided fields, a process similar to the proposed nanoflare mechanism and distinct from the standard large-scale flare model.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The solar corona maintains temperatures of a million Kelvin or more. The plasma heating mechanisms responsible for these extreme temperatures are still unclear. Large regions of magnetic activity in the photosphere cause extreme ultraviolet (EUV) emission in the corona. Even smaller regions with bipolar and multipolar magnetic fields can generate coronal bright points (CBPs). Aims. We performed a statistical analysis of 346 CBPs. We used Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) images to track CBPs on a continuous basis. Therefore, we were able to collect a database of information on the CPB's lifetime, shape, polarity, flux emergence, and merging behavior, as well as their magnetic evolution, using the SDO Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (SDO-HMI) instrument. Methods. We searched the SDO data archive for the longest continuous interval of uninterrupted observations in 2015. The longest such interval contains 12 consecutive days of full-disk images from the EUV channels of the SDO-AIA instrument. To analyze the properties of CBPs, we employed an automated tracking algorithm to follow the evolution of the CBPs. Furthermore, we manually checked the shape, underlying magnetic polarities, and merging behavior of each CBP. Results. We provide statistics on the magnetic polarity, emergence, and merging of CBPs. We established a relationship between the CBP's merging behavior and both its shape and magnetic polarities. Brighter CBPs are visible in all SDO-AIA channels and exhibit strong radiative energy losses. The category of CBPs with a bipolar field has the highest probability of being emissive in all SDO-AIA channels. The majority of CBPs have two opposite polarities below them. Conclusions. The merging of two CBPs is an unusual phenomenon that is related to complex multipolar magnetic regions. Moreover, loop-shaped CBPs usually appear above bipolar fields... (see full abstract in pdf)

 - **Abstract**
 This paper addresses the evolution of an axially symmetric magnetic field in the core of a neutron star. The matter in the core is modeled as a system of two fluids, namely neutrons and charged particles, with slightly different velocity fields, controlled by their mutual collisional friction. This problem was addressed in our previous work through the so-called ``fictitious friction'' approach. We study the validity of our previous work and improve it by comparing the fictitious friction approach to alternatives, making approximations that allow it to be applied to arbitrary magnetic field strengths and using realistic equations of state. We assume the neutron star crust to be perfectly resistive, so its magnetic field reacts instantaneously to changes in the core, in which we neglect the effects of Cooper pairing. We explore different approaches to solve the equations to obtain the velocities and chemical potential perturbations induced by a given, fixed magnetic field configuration in the core. We also present a new version of our code to perform time-evolving simulations and discuss the results obtained with it. Our calculations without fictitious friction further confirm that bulk velocity is generally much greater than ambipolar velocity, leading to faster evolution. These findings align with those with fictitious friction, validating this approach. We also find that, in the long term, the star evolves towards a barotropic ``Grad-Shafranov equilibrium,'' where the magnetic force is fully balanced by charged particle fluid forces. Qualitatively, the evolution and the final equilibrium are independent of the magnetic field strength $B$ and the equation of state considered. The timescale to reach this equilibrium is proportional to $B^{-2}$ and becomes shorter for equations of state with a smaller gradient of the ratio between the densities of protons and neutrons.

 VERITAS began full-scale operations in 2007 and it remains one of the world's most sensitive very-high-energy (VHE; E >100 GeV) gamma-ray observatories. More than 8,300 hours (~50%) of its good-weather data were targeted on active galactic nuclei (AGN). Many of these observations were taken as part of an ongoing comprehensive program to discover new VHE AGN. Upon discovery, the VERITAS collaboration leverages VHE spectral and variability measurements, and accompanying broadband observations to probe the underlying jet-powered processes in AGN. Recent scientific highlights from the VERITAS AGN discovery program, including the VHE discoveries of B2 0912+29, 1ES 1028+511, 1ES 1118+424 and RBS 1366, are presented.

 - **Abstract**
 Characterizing the growth of supermassive Black Holes (SMBHs) is critical to the evolution of galaxies, however the majority of this activity is obscured, rendering traditional tracers of active SMBHs, such as in the restframe optical/UV, ineffective. The mid-infrared has been particularly successful in revealing obscured AGN activity however much of this work is confined to the local universe due to the lack of a far-IR telescope with the required sensitivity and wavelength coverage. In this work we demonstrate the effectiveness of PRIMA (PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics), a concept 1.8m far-IR observatory, to detect and characterize deeply obscured galaxy nuclei over cosmic time. With the PRIMAger instrument covering 25 - 235 $\mu$m, we find that we can accurately detect obscured nuclei via the deep silicate absorption at restframe $9.8 \mu$m between $z=2-7$. Additionally, the FIRESS spectrograph can produce R$\sim$100 spectra of obscured nuclei out to $z\sim7$, detecting Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs), ices, ionized and molecular gas. With the large number of deeply obscured nuclei PRIMA can detect and characterize, such a mission is critical to understanding the growth of SMBHs.

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce a novel, fast, and efficient generative model built upon scattering covariances, the most recent iteration of the scattering transforms statistics. This model is designed to augment by several orders of magnitude the number of map simulations in datasets of computationally expensive CMB instrumental systematics simulations, including their non-Gaussian and inhomogeneous features. Unlike conventional neural network-based algorithms, this generative model requires only a minimal number of training samples, making it highly compatible with the computational constraints of typical CMB simulation campaigns. We validate the method using realistic simulations of CMB systematics, which are particularly challenging to emulate, and perform extensive statistical tests to confirm its ability to produce new statistically independent approximate realizations. Remarkably, even when trained on as few as 10 simulations, the emulator closely reproduces key summary statistics -- including the angular power spectrum, scattering coefficients, and Minkowski functionals -- and provides pixel-to-pixel covariance estimates with substantially reduced sample noise compared to those obtained without augmentation. The proposed approach has the potential to shift the paradigm in simulation campaign design. Instead of producing large numbers of low- or medium-accuracy simulations, future pipelines can focus on generating a few high-accuracy simulations that are then efficiently augmented using such generative model. This promises significant benefits for current and forthcoming cosmological surveys such as $Planck$, $LiteBIRD$, Simons Observatory, CMB-S4, Euclid and Rubin-LSST. We make both the general framework for scattering transform statistics available at this https URL and the emulator available at this https URL.

 - **Abstract**
 X-ray polarimetry offers a unique window into neutron star physics and can provide answers to questions that cannot otherwise be probed. The up-and-coming REDSoX sounding rocket mission will be the first experiment equipped with a detector able to explore polarized X-rays below 1 keV, observing in the 0.2-0.4 keV range. Although REDSoX will only be capable of short, one-off observations, it will crucially test the instrument performance. In this paper we investigate how a fully-fledged orbital mission with longer lifetime, based on an instrument design similar to REDSoX, will allow us to study thermal emission from the X-ray dim isolated neutron stars (XDINSs) and magnetars, probing their magnetic field and the physics of their outer surface layers, including vacuum effects and QED mode conversion at the vacuum resonance. We discuss the potentially observable features for promising values of the star's surface temperature, magnetic field, and viewing geometry. Assuming emission from the whole surface, we find that, for a source with a magnetic field B=5x10^{13} G and surface temperature T~10^7 K, the instrument can resolve a proton-cyclotron absorption feature in the spectrum with high significance when collecting ~25,000 counts across a single observation. Similarly, for a source with B=10^{14} G and T~10^7 K, a switch in the dominant polarization mode, caused by mode conversion at the vacuum resonance, can be detected by collecting ~25,000 counts, allowing for a long-sought observational test of the presence of QED effects. We then present two case studies for XDINS targets: RX J1856.5-3754 and RX J0720.4-3125.
