 - **Abstract**
 As observations have yet to constrain the ionizing properties of the faintest (M$_{\rm UV}$ > -16) galaxies, their contribution to cosmic reionization remains unclear. The rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) continuum slope ($\beta$) is a powerful diagnostic of stellar populations and one of the few feasible indicators of the escape fraction of ionizing photons (f$_{\rm esc}$) for such faint galaxies at high-redshift. Leveraging ultra-deep JWST/NIRCam GLIMPSE imaging of strong lensing field Abell S1063, we estimate UV continuum slopes of 555 galaxies at z $>$ 6 with absolute magnitudes down to M$_{\rm UV}$ $\simeq -$12.5. We find a modest evolution of $\beta$ with redshift and a flattening in the $\beta$-M$_{\rm UV}$ relation such that galaxies fainter than M$_{\rm UV}$ $\sim -$16.5 no longer exhibit the bluest UV slopes. The 138 ultra-faint galaxies with M$_{\rm UV}$ $> -$16 are a diverse population encompassing dusty (30\%), old (15\%), and low-mass (50\%) galaxies. We apply the empirical $\beta$-f$_{\rm esc}$ relation from local Lyman continuum leakers, finding the mean f$_{\rm esc}$ peaks at $\sim 20\%$ at M$_{\rm UV}=-$16.5 and declines towards fainter galaxies, while remaining consistent with f$_{\rm esc}$ = 14\% within uncertainties, in agreement with recent radiative transfer simulations. Incorporating GLIMPSE constraints on the UV luminosity function, ionizing photon production efficiency, and escape fractions produces a reionization history consistent with independent observational constraints. Our results indicate galaxies with M$_{\rm UV}$ between $-18$ and $-14$ supplied $\sim 60\%$ of the ionizing photons to cosmic reionization, while the lower f$_{\rm esc}$ of fainter galaxies produces a natural cutoff in the ionizing photon production rate density.

 - **Abstract**
 We used more than $10^5$ Gaia DR3 line broadening vbroad measurements to examine stellar rotation as a function of stellar temperature, mass and age. The large sample clearly displays the Kraft break at $\sim 6{,}500$\,K, or mass of $\sim1.3\,M_{\odot}$-while vbroad are small, on the order of $10$-$20$ km/s, for stars cooler than the Kraft break, they sharply rise above the break, reaching up $\sim100$ km/s with temperature of $7{,}000$ K. To follow the stellar rotation as a function of age, we consider vbroad as a function of scaled age-stellar age divided by the relevant Terminal Age Main Sequence (MS), for four narrow mass bins. We find that stellar rotation deceleration is slow during the MS phase and fast afterwards for stars hotter than the break, whereas deceleration rate is relatively high and does not vary much for the cool stars. Our findings are consistent with the theory that stellar rotation slowing is due to magnetic breaking, emanating from magnetic fields that are anchored to the stellar convective envelopes. Therefore, deceleration is high in cool stars, but in hot stars only after they leave the MS and develop convective outer layers
#### GLIMPSE-DDT spectroscopic properties of faint-end galaxies at $z\sim6$: Towards first metal enrichment, dust production, and ionizing photon production

 - **Abstract**
 Ultra-faint galaxies at high-$z$ are fundamental elements of the early galaxy assembly, and spectroscopic characterization of this population is essential to understand the earliest galaxy evolution. Leveraging the ultra-deep JWST/NIRCam and NIRSpec observations of a gravitational lensing field of Abell S1063, taken as part of the GLIMPSE survey, we present spectroscopic properties of 16 galaxies fainter than $M_{\rm UV}=-17$ mag, including the metallicity, dust attenuation, and the ionizing photon production efficiency. The emission lines are generally quite strong, roughly half of which cannot be replicated with standard stellar populations and require an extreme ionizing source. We also identify relatively strong [OIII] emission lines from all sample galaxies, which indicates that the low-mass end of the mass-metallicity relation is extended down to $M_\star\sim10^6\ M_\odot$ at $z\sim6$. The strong [OIII] line detection from the lowest-mass galaxy among the sample ($M_\star\sim10^{5.6}\ M_\odot$) stands in contrast to recent reports of extremely metal-poor galaxy candidates at similar mass and redshift, suggesting that there could be two distinct pathways of the earliest metal enrichment as simulations have predicted. Interestingly, we detect both dust attenuation and galactic outflow in one of the sample galaxies with $M_\star=10^{6.6}\ M_\odot$ at $z=5.5$. All the dust, metal, and outflow contents in this galaxy can be consistently explained by supernovae (SNe), indicative of the key roles of SNe in the earliest galaxy assembly such as dust production, metal enrichment, stellar feedback, and baryon cycle.

 - **Abstract**
 A leading theory of sunquake generation involves flare-accelerated particles depositing energy into the photosphere. Simulations of sunquake excitation suggest co-excitation with wavefronts propagating in the corona and chromosphere, similar to Moreton-Ramsey waves, and large-scale coronal propagating fronts (LCPFs). To investigate observational evidence for the particle-driven mechanism in LCPFs, we compare populations of events associated with and without coronal mass ejections (CMEs). CMEs are known to generate similar EUV shock waves. We employ a visual inspection of flare events that generate LCPFs using Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) and Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) coronagraph images to find that coronal waves associated with CMEs propagate noticeably faster. Then we examine GOES soft X-ray (SXR) data of standalone flare events (those that generate coronal waves without CMEs), focusing on soft X-ray (SXR) characteristics related to magnetic energy release rate. This reveals that such standalone or confined flares differ from sunquake flares: they are less impulsive and energetic than sunquake flares. However, they are more impulsive but less energetic than LCPF-associated flares with a CME. In particular, coronal waves accompanied by CMEs exhibit significantly higher volume emission measures, suggesting a different generation mechanism.
#### Accretion Properties of the Young Brown Dwarf 2MASS J08440915-7833457

 - **Abstract**
 We present HST-COS FUV and -STIS optical observations towards the young accreting brown dwarf 2MASS-J08440915-7833457 (J0844) from the ULLYSES DDT Program. We analyse hot FUV lines such C IV, Si IV, and N V, as well as fluorescent emission from H2. Despite evidence for accretion, the C IV line profiles are narrower than in typical classical T Tauri stars (CTTSs), resembling weak-lined T Tauri stars more closely. Additionally, the C IV integrated line flux does not follow the level expected of an accreting object in the magnetically saturated regime. However, comparing J0844 to appropriate low mass analogs, J0844 does show excess C IV emission characteristic of accretion, suggesting the magnetic saturation level may need to be redefined for the lowest mass objects. The C IV/Si IV emission line ratio is found to be 20, which is higher than most CTTSs, with a few exceptions (e.g., TW Hya). We fit the STIS optical spectrum to calculate an accretion rate, which we find to be 4.2 x 10-11 Msol/yr. The accretion rate found based on the empirical LCIV-Macc relationship is twoorders of magnitude higher, suggesting this relationship may not hold at the lowest masses. We find the H2 emission appears to originate within the co-rotation radius, pointing to either disc truncation well inside the co-rotation radius or additional sources of H2 emission that we do not consider (e.g., from the accretion flow itself). These data provide an extension of our current understanding of accretion and inner disc conditions to the relatively unexplored lowest mass regime.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a physically-grounded population model for optical tidal disruption events (TDEs) that combines first-principles hydrodynamic simulations of stellar disruption with statistical inference of the underlying stellar and black hole populations. The model's prediction of peak luminosity is based directly on recent global simulations that follow the disruption self-consistently and contains no tunable parameters related to the emission physics. We construct the predicted joint distribution of peak luminosity and black hole mass, including both full and partial disruptions, and compare it to a sample of observed TDEs using Bayesian inference and Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. We find that the model reproduces the distribution in the ($M_{BH},L_{peak}$) plane for the bulk of the observed TDE population with good statistical consistency. The data strongly favor an old stellar population, with a sharp suppression of stars above $M_* \simeq 1.5 - 2 M_\odot$. They also indicate that, at fixed stellar mass, the volumetric TDE rate is nearly independent of black hole mass. Partial disruptions contribute a substantial fraction ($\sim 30\%$) of detected events in flux-limited samples and are essential for reproducing the observed distribution. The inferred population properties are robust to different approximations to the stellar mass-radius relation, although the event rate at high luminosity is sensitive to the form of this relation for massive stars. We predict a large population of difficult to detect low luminosity TDEs, implying that the true volumetric TDE rate may exceed that inferred from present samples by up to an order of magnitude.

 - **Abstract**
 We study a string-inspired dilaton cosmology in the Damour--Polyakov (DP) regime using dynamical-systems methods, aiming to make explicit how cosmological relaxation controls deviations from the equivalence principle. Working in the Einstein frame, we consider a spatially flat FLRW universe filled with pressureless matter and a universally coupled dilaton. Expanding the conformal coupling function and the scalar potential around the least-coupling point, we obtain a closed and self-consistent autonomous system governing the late-time evolution of the scalar-matter sector. The resulting phase space contains a stable fixed point associated with least coupling, approached only asymptotically along cosmological trajectories. Therefore, at any finite epoch the solution typically retains a small displacement from the fixed point. In the DP regime this finite-epoch displacement sets the ambient coupling, and thus determines the magnitude of fifth-force effects and deviations from the equivalence principle in the nonrelativistic limit. By linearising the system around a finite-epoch reference state, we show that the damping of the displacement is controlled by the Jacobian eigenvalues of the DP fixed point. This yields a direct dynamical estimate of how rapidly deviations from the equivalence principle are reduced during cosmological evolution. The mechanism is global and cosmological in origin, and is conceptually distinct from local environmental screening as in chameleon or symmetron scenarios. Overall, our results illustrate how phase-space techniques provide a clear bridge between cosmological dynamics and weak-field departures from General Relativity.

 - **Abstract**
 Observational surveys show that at least ~ 30% of short-period multiplanetary systems host tightly packed planets, some of which are locked in stable chains of mean-motion resonances. Despite recent progress, the dynamical stability of these systems remains only partially understood. Numerical simulations have established a general exponential increase in system lifetime with orbital separation, with mean-motion resonances playing a key role in regulating stability. Tightly packed three-planet systems exhibit a distinctive behavior not seen in higher-multiplicity systems: a small yet significant region of phase space is anomalously stable. This study investigates the dynamics of extremely compact three-planet systems, focusing on anomalously long-lived configurations and their connection to resonant chains observed in exoplanetary systems. We perform numerical integrations of coplanar, initially circular, equal-mass three-planet systems over stellar-lifetime timescales and at high resolution in orbital separation, and interpret the results in the context of recent analytical work. We identify regions of phase space hosting anomalously stable orbits, including systems surviving multiple orders of magnitude longer than predicted by the exponential trend. We demonstrate a clear link between stability and isolated three-body mean-motion resonances, showing that extremely compact systems can remain stable when captured into a small subset of isolated zeroth-order resonances. Stability further depends on the initial orbital longitudes and on the interplay between the three-body and two-body resonance networks.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate longitude-velocity ($\ell$-$v$) diagrams as a diagnostic tool to study the metallicity structure of the Milky Way (MW) disk. The present-day metallicity structure encodes the imprint of the Galaxy's formation, assembly, and secular evolution. Using oxygen abundances from HII regions across the MW disk, together with MW-mass galaxies from the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE-2) cosmological simulations, we show that $\ell$-$v$ diagrams trace radial metallicity gradients and non-axisymmetric azimuthal metallicity variations. Because they do not rely on distance measurements, $\ell$-$v$ diagrams complement face-on maps for studying metallicity structure. In the MW, we detect the radial metallicity gradient in $\ell$-$v$ space, but current HII region oxygen abundance errors are too high to reveal azimuthal variations. In the FIRE-2 MW-mass galaxies, the radial gradient is evident in $\ell$-$v$ diagrams regardless of observer location, but anomalous gas kinematics can mimic azimuthal metallicity variations. We term these "anomalous motions", which have an excess local standard of rest (LSR) velocity tail 3 times larger in the FIRE-2 simulations compared to the MW. Our results highlight $\ell$-$v$ diagrams as a largely unexplored tool for probing metallicity structure without requiring distances, and underscore discrepancies between the gas kinematics in the FIRE-2 simulations and those in the MW.

 - **Abstract**
 We perform a data-driven test of the FLRW metric and the flatness of the Universe, independently of any Dark Energy model, and in light of the latest DESI DR2 results. We use Pantheon+ and DESY5 SNIa data to reconstruct the distance modulus, dimensionless comoving distance and Hubble parameter, using an iterative smoothing algorithm. Then, combining the various reconstructions with the recent BAO measurements from DESI DR2, we perform the $\mathcal{O}_k$ diagnostic, a litmus test of the FLRW metric and the flatness of the Universe. We obtain robust results that do not depend on Dark Energy models and test some of the underlying hypotheses of the concordance model. We find that when the reconstructed $\mathcal{O}_k$ diagnostic is consistent with the FLRW metric, then the median value of $\Oko$ over all reconstructions that provide an improved fit relative to the flat $\Lambda$CDM model are: ${\Omega}_{k,0}^\text{med} = 0.035 ^{+0.046}_{-0.079}\pm 0.037$ for the Pantheon+ \& DESI DR2 data combination, ${\Omega}_{k,0}^\text{med} = 0.092 ^{+0.055}_{-0.132} \pm 0.064$ for the same data but with the Pantheon+ SNIa cut at redshift $z=1.13$, which is the maximum redshift of the DES~Y5 data, and ${\Omega}_{k,0}^\text{med} = -0.119^{+0.113}_{-0.047}\pm 0.043$ for DES~Y5 \& DESI DR2. The first uncertainties correspond to the spread in $\Oko$ over all reconstructions, followed by the median 1$\sigma$ error.
#### Observations of the temporal evolution of Saturn's stratosphere following the Great Storm of 2010-2011. II. Latitudinal distribution of CO and stratospheric winds

 - **Abstract**
 Saturn's Great Storm of 2010-2011 has produced two stratospheric hot spots, the "beacons," that eventually merged to produce a gigantic one in April and May 2011. This beacon perturbed stratospheric temperatures, hydrocarbon, and water abundances for several years. We aim to assess whether the beacon induced any perturbation in another oxygen species, namely CO. A second goal is to measure how the vortex perturbed the stratospheric wind regime. We conducted interferometric observations of Saturn in the submillimeter range with SMA and ALMA to spatially resolve the CO (J=3-2) and (J=2-1) emissions, respectively. We used a previously determined CO vertical profile as a template, to search for (i) the meridional distribution of CO and (ii) variations of the CO abundance associated with the storm. The high spatial and spectral resolutions of the ALMA observations enabled us to retrieve the winds from the Doppler shifts induced by the winds on the lines. Despite limitations resulting from the removal of baseline ripples, we find a relatively constant meridional distribution of CO. The average CO mole fraction implied by the adopted and rescaled 220-year-old-comet-impact vertical profile is (1.7$\pm$0.7)$\times10^{-7}$ at 0.3\,mbar, i.e., where the contribution functions peak. We also find that the CO abundance has not been noticeably altered in the beacon. The winds measured at 1\,mbar show striking differences with those measured in 2018, after the demise of the beacon. We find the signature of the vortex as an anticyclonic feature. The equatorial prograde jet is 100 to 200 m.s$^{-1}$ slower, and broader in latitude, than in quiescent conditions. We also detect several prograde jets in the southern hemisphere. Finally, we detect a retrograde jet at 74$^\circ$N which could be a polar jet caused by the interaction of the Saturn magnetosphere with its atmosphere.
#### Probing the Diversity of Type Ia Supernova Remnants in 3-D Hydrodynamic Simulations with X-ray Spectral Synthesis

 - **Abstract**
 Type Ia supernovae (SNe), thermonuclear explosions of white dwarfs in binary systems, are widely used as standard candles owing to the empirical width-luminosity relation of their light curves. Recent theoretical and observational studies indicate a diversity of progenitor systems and explosion mechanisms. In the supernova remnant (SNR) phase, the diversity in Fe-K$\alpha$ centroid energies and line luminosities suggests variations in the underlying explosion mechanisms. X-ray spectra of SNRs, which trace shocked ejecta and the surrounding medium, are crucial diagnostics of progenitor systems and explosion physics. Thanks to recent advances in spectroscopy with XRISM, high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy enables 3-D diagnostics, including line-of-sight velocities. In this study, we perform 3-D hydrodynamic simulations of SNRs from six Type Ia explosion models: two each of pure deflagration, delayed detonation, and double detonation. Each model is evolved for 1000 years in a uniform medium, consistently accounting for non-equilibrium ionization. Our efficient numerical scheme enables systematic parameter surveys in full 3-D. From these models, we synthesize X-ray spectra with $\sim$1 eV resolution, exceeding XRISM/Resolve's spectral resolution. This work presents the first calculation of X-ray spectra for Type Ia SNRs derived from 3-D hydrodynamic simulations that follow the evolution self-consistently from the SN phase into the SNR phase. Our results show inter-model diversity in the X-ray spectra. Asymmetric, red- and blueshifted line profiles arise from the 3-D ejecta distributions. These findings demonstrate that 3-D SNR modeling can reproduce the observed diversity of Type Ia SNRs and provide qualitative constraints on progenitor systems and explosion mechanisms.
#### A multi-technique search for year-scale $γ$-ray quasi-periodic modulation in the high-redshift FSRQ PKS~2052$-$47

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate year-scale quasi-periodic oscillations in the $\gamma$-ray emission of the high-redshift flat-spectrum radio quasar PKS~2052$-$47 using monthly binned \emph{Fermi}-LAT data spanning MJD~54727.99--58507.99. To assess the statistical significance of periodic features embedded in red-noise-dominated variability, we apply several complementary timing techniques, including the Lomb--Scargle periodogram, weighted wavelet $Z$-transform, date-compensated discrete Fourier transform, REDFIT assuming an AR(1) process, and damped random walk modelling. The analyses reveal a dominant quasi-periodic modulation on a timescale of $\sim600$--630~d, together with a secondary longer-timescale feature near $\sim1050$--1110~d. Monte Carlo simulations show that the shorter-period signal exceeds the highest local confidence levels, while the longer modulation reaches $\gtrsim99$ per cent local significance in several tests; independent DRW-based simulations place both peaks above the $4\sigma$ envelope in the Lomb--Scargle analysis. Spectral-window diagnostics indicate that the detected periodicities are not artefacts of uneven sampling, and a sliding-window analysis shows that the QPO power is episodic across the $\sim11$~yr baseline. We discuss possible physical interpretations in terms of geometric Doppler modulation associated with jet precession or helical motion, accretion-driven instabilities, and SMBBH-induced dynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic fields play a central role in black hole astrophysics, powering relativistic jets and other energetic phenomena. While near-horizon magnetic field is usually assumed to originate from the accretion flow, additional large-scale magnetic fields - such as those supplied by a companion neutron star in stellar-mass binaries or by galactic fields around supermassive black holes - may also affect the horizon-threading flux. In this work, we study the superposition of a weak arbitrarily inclined external uniform magnetic field with the internal Blandford-Znajek split-monopole field around a Schwarzschild black hole. This setup generically gives rise to magnetic null points, where the total field vanishes. We compute the magnetic flux through an arbitrarily tilted hemisphere of the event horizon and show that the flux can be substantially suppressed by the external field. In the axisymmetric case, the flux can even vanish completely. However, with nonzero inclination, complete cancellation becomes impossible, despite significant reduction. We further explore the ionization and subsequent particle acceleration from a Keplerian accretion disk, finding that efficient collimated outflows persist even under significant field inclination. We show that the acceleration is critically dependent on the external field orientation, with the escape fraction maximized at non-zero inclinations due to the destabilization of trapping zones and minimized in the anti-aligned configuration, where closed magnetic loops effectively suppress the outflow. We discuss the astrophysical implications of these findings, proposing that geometric flux cancellation can serve as a mechanism for jet quenching in compact binaries and offering an explanation for the lack of a prominent large-scale jet in Sgr A*.
#### A Quiescent Galaxy in a Gas-Rich Cosmic Web Node at z~3

 - **Abstract**
 Recent JWST observations have unveiled a large number of quiescent galaxies at $z\gtrsim3$, bringing potential challenges to current galaxy formation models. Since star formation is expected to be fed by external gas accretion, the knowledge about the circumgalactic media (CGM) of these galaxies is essential to understanding how they quench. In this work, we present the discovery of a massive and passive galaxy ($M_\star\simeq10^{11}\,M_\odot$) within the MQN01 structure at z~3.25, containing one of the largest overdensities of galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGN) found so far at $z\gtrsim3$. The passive galaxy has a star-formation rate of $4^{+6}_{-2}~M_\odot$/yr, placing it more than 1 dex below the star-forming main sequence, and has no detectable molecular gas ($M_\mathrm{H2}<7\times10^{9}\,M_\odot$). Surprisingly, it is located at the center of a large cool gas reservoir, as traced by bright Ly$\alpha$ and H$\alpha$ emission. By taking advantage of deep multi-wavelength information unique to this field, including deep Chandra X-ray data, we argue that the inefficient gas accretion from the CGM onto this galaxy over the last few hundreds of Myr, as suggested by the observations, could be caused by an AGN jet of a nearby star-forming galaxy located at a projected distance of 48 kpc. In particular, we argue that the jet feedback may have maintained a high level of CGM turbulence around the passive galaxy and thus caused a reduced gas accretion over the required time-scales. In addition, the elevated ionizing field provided by the AGN overdensity, including the nearby AGN, can illuminate the passive galaxy's cool CGM and make it visible through fluorescent emission. Our study demonstrates that the star formation rates of high-redshift galaxies could be substantially reduced and maintained at a low level even within gas-rich and overdense environments in particular situations.

 - **Abstract**
 We use ALMA CO(1-0) observations and VLT/MUSE rest-frame optical data of the ultraluminous infrared galaxy (ULIRG) IRAS20100-4156 at $z=0.1297$ to characterize its powerful outflow in multiple phases using tracers of cold molecular, ionized, and neutral atomic gas and dust as well. Our analysis uses the correspondence with the stellar velocity field to split the complex emission line profiles of the CO(1-0) line into components in gravitational and non-gravitational motion. We find a massive ($8\times10^{9}\,M_\odot$) molecular outflow containing about 40% of the total molecular gas mass in the system. The outflow shows a bi-conical morphology centered on the brightest galaxy in the merger, oriented along its minor axis and extending to $\sim5\,\mathrm{kpc}$. This outflow has a characteristic velocity of $170\,\mathrm{km/s}$, an outflow mass rate of $700\,M_\odot/\mathrm{yr}$, a depletion time of $16\,\mathrm{Myr}$, and energetics consistent with star formation as a driver. The neutral atomic and ionized gas phases traced by NaI absorption and H$\alpha$ emission show counterparts to the blueshifted cold molecular outflow but are only 15% and 3% as massive. None of the three gas phases show any signs of slowing down over the extent at which we detected the outflow, suggesting an acceleration mechanism acting on the outflowing gas at kiloparsec scales. We also detect $3.5\times 10^7\,M_\odot$ of dust, traced by optical extinction in the MUSE data, in the blueshifted outflowing cold molecular gas. The ionization state of the non-outflowing gas is consistent with star formation, while the outflowing component shows shock-like ionization. We conclude that the multiphase outflow in IRAS20100-4156 originates in the southeast nucleus of the merger and is driven by the starburst activity there, with radiation pressure likely playing a significant role in its acceleration.

 - **Abstract**
 Restricted by event horizon suppression, tidal disruption events (TDEs) provide a unique window into otherwise hidden supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the lower end of the mass spectrum, allowing the connection between star formation and SMBH mass to be explored across a broad stellar mass range. We derive stellar masses and specific star formation rates using Prospector fits to UV-MIR broadband spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for 42 TDE hosts, together with a high-mass comparison sample, and combine these with SMBH mass estimates from the literature. We first verify our approach by reproducing the established result that quenched galaxies host more massive SMBHs than star-forming systems at fixed stellar mass, a result widely interpreted as evidence for SMBH growth driving the blue-to-red sequence transition. However, examining the TDE sample in isolation reveals a trend reversal at lower masses, uncovering a surprising population of low-mass ($10^{9.6} \lesssim M_{\rm gal} \lesssim 10^{10.5}$ M$_\odot$), quenched galaxies hosting SMBHs systematically less massive ($M_{\rm BH} \lesssim 10^{6.5}$ M$_\odot$) than those in star-forming galaxies of comparable stellar mass. After ruling out degeneracies in our SED fits, we conclude that this reflects a physical difference in the quenching mechanism between these TDE hosts and the more massive galaxies. This is unlikely to be driven by AGN feedback, and could instead result from environmental processes, which can end star formation and hinder SMBH growth. We also show that the quenched and post-starburst population within the TDE sample is likely under-represented due to selection biases, suggesting the true fraction could be even higher than observed.

 - **Abstract**
 Earth-like planets orbiting in the habitable zone of K- to G-type stars create an RV effect in amplitude of less than 1 \si{\meter\per\second} and have orbital periods of hundreds of days. Only long-term RV surveys with sub-meter per second precision instruments can explore the outer regions of Sun-like stars and look for Earth-like planets and super-Earths. We present the analysis of the K-type star HD 176986. It has a brightness of V=8.45 mag and a distance from the Sun of d = 27.88 pc. This star hosts a known planetary system of two super-Earths. We joined historical datasets with new data collected in an ongoing blind search program. We took advantage of recently developed tools for RV extraction and stellar activity filtering. The analysis of activity indicators permits us to determine the period of the magnetic cycle of the star alongside its rotation period. We performed a joint analysis of RVs and activity indicators through multidimensional GPs to better constrain the activity model in RVs and avoid overfitting. We detected a new planet orbiting the star and retrieved the two known planets. HD 176986 b has an orbital period of 6.49164$^{+0.00030}_{-0.00029}$ d and a minimum mass of 5.36 $\pm$ 0.44 M$\oplus$. HD 176986 c has an orbital period of P$_c$ = 16.8124 $\pm$ 0.0015 d and a minimum mass of 9.75$_{-0.64}^{+0.65}$ M$\oplus$. HD 176986 d has an orbital period of 61.376$^{+0.051}_{-0.049}$ d and a minimum mass of 6.76$_{-0.92}^{+0.91}$ M$\oplus$. From the analysis of activity indicators, we find evidence of a magnetic cycle with a period of 2432$_{-59}^{+64}$ d, along with a rotation period of 36.05 $_{-0.71}^{+0.67}$ d. We discover a new planet in the multi-planet system orbiting the K-type star HD 176986. All the planets have minimum masses compatible with super-Earths or mini-Neptunes.
#### Revealing the link between halo mass and radio jet activities in quasars

 - **Abstract**
 There is a fundamental lack of understanding as to why quasars that are otherwise very similar can have such a wide range of radio jet powers, and the large-scale environment is thought to play an important role. We investigate the spatial clustering properties of 225,382 quasars from the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) within the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) Data Release 2 footprint, split by the statistically-calculated fraction of their radio flux densities contributed by jets (relative to the contribution from star formation). We find a positive correlation between the clustering strengths of quasars and their jet fraction, where quasars with a higher jet fraction have a higher clustering amplitude measured by their two-point correlation functions. We show that this correlation is unlikely related to differences in BH masses or bolometric luminosities. Quasars dominated by powerful jet activities generally reside in dark matter haloes $10-100$ times more massive than those without strong jets, with typical halo masses of $10^{13-14}\ h^{-1}M_\odot$, establishing a robust link between powerful AGN jets and rich cluster environments. Our results demonstrate that halo mass is important for determining the power of radio jets, but suggest that there is no minimum dark matter halo mass or BH mass required for the triggering of jets. The observed correlation suggests that BH spin is likely to play a minor role in jet production; instead, the key driver could be the presence of a strong magnetic flux.

 - **Abstract**
 A mildly inhomogeneous universe with a cosmological constant may look like it contains evolving dark energy. We show that could be the case by modelling the inhomogeneities and their effects in three different ways: as clumped matter surrounded by voids, as back-reaction of small-scale structure on the overall expansion of the Universe, and, finally, as a large-scale curvature inhomogeneity. In all of these cases, the propagation of light is affected, and differs from that in a homogeneous and isotropic universe. The net result is that cosmological observables, such as angular diameter and luminosity distances, become distorted. We find, in all three models, that the inclusion of these effects pushes the distance-redshift relation towards closer agreement with recent data from both supernovae Ia from the Dark Energy Survey, and from baryon acoustic oscillations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument. The amount of inhomogeneity in these models might not be enough to explain the entirety of the deviation from a cosmological constant, but is found to be of a similar order of magnitude, hinting that these data may be consistent with a universe dominated by a cosmological constant.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new comprehensive study of HD81809, a nearby binary system of two solar-like stars showing high-amplitude X-ray emission and a well-defined 8-year solar-like magnetic cycle. By analyzing high-resolution spectroscopy, alongside DR3 Gaia astrometry, and bolometric fluxes, we derive updated fundamental parameters for both components. In particular, we uncover a significant chemical difference: the primary is metal-poor ([Fe/H]$ \simeq - 0.57$), while the secondary shows solar-like metallicity ([Fe/H]$=0.00$). This suggests that the system originated in a mildly metal-poor environment, consistent with the Galactic thick disk population, and that the secondary's surface composition has been altered by a recent accretion event. Using multi-sector TESS photometry, we detected solar-like oscillations in both components, deriving global asteroseismic parameters $\Delta\nu = 43.32 \pm 3.91 \mu$Hz, $\nu_{\rm max} = 708.74^{+3.23}_{-3.74} \mu$Hz for HD81809 A, and $\Delta\nu = 97.75 \pm 4.49~\mu$Hz, $\nu_{\rm max} = 2098.07^{+3.07}_{-2.83} \mu$Hz for HD81809 B. By combining all the observational constraints with stellar evolutionary models computed using CLES and MESA codes, we reconstructed the evolutionary scenario of the system. Our results indicate that HD 81809 is an old system with an age of $\sim 10 \mathrm{Gyr}$, composed of a subgiant primary with mass $\sim 0.87M_{\odot}$ and radius $\sim1.96R_{\odot}$ - likely responsible for the reactivated dynamo cycle - and a main sequence secondary with mass $ M=0.85M_{\odot}$ and radius $R=1.10R_{\odot}$. This system represents a benchmark for studying stellar evolution, magnetic activity, and the physics of old, metal-poor stars in the Galactic thick disk.

 - **Abstract**
 The presence of massive O-type stars with surfaces enriched by CNO-cycle products has been known since the early 1980s. For many years, internal rotational mixing was assumed to be the dominant mechanism responsible for this chemical contamination. However, accumulating evidence now suggests that binary interaction -- particularly mass-transfer episodes -- may play an equally important, if not dominant, role. We aim to carry out a large-scale investigation of surface helium (He) abundances in Galactic O-type stars, based on the results from the analysis of high-quality spectroscopic data from the IACOB project. We perform a homogeneous spectroscopic analysis of 318 Galactic O-type stars with the IACOB-BROAD and FASTWIND/IACOB-GBAT tools, deriving rotational velocities, atmospheric parameters, and He abundances. We also account for the influence of binarity, runaway status, and parameter degeneracies (e.g., microturbulence, wind properties, diagnostic lines, and companion contamination) on the abundance determinations. We present homogeneously determined surface He abundances (YHe=N(He)/N(H)) for the so far largest, statistically significant sample of Galactic O-type stars. About 78% of the stars show He abundances consistent with the previously proposed cosmic abundance standard of YHe=0.098$\pm$0.002. The remaining 22% display clear He enrichment (YHe>0.13). We also provide observational evidence indicating that most of these He-enriched stars are likely the products of binary interaction. Our study highlights how large spectroscopic surveys are gradually opening robust observational avenues to identify the products of massive binary interaction. It also emphasizes the need for caution when interpreting the spectroscopic properties of apparently single O-type stars. A significant fraction may in fact be the outcome of binary evolution rather than isolated stellar birth.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper discusses the broad science case for obtaining milliarcsecond to microarcsecond astronomical imaging resolution in the soft to medium-energy X-ray band (~0.5 to ~8 keV). Astronomy across much of the electromagnetic spectrum has been fundamentally transformed with a rapid increase in ground-based and space-based capabilities to examine celestial objects on small scales that relate directly to their relevant physical processes. X-ray imaging capabilities, however, have fallen far behind observations at longer wavelengths. As such, without decisive advances in X-ray imaging, we will be unable to uncover key phenomena on the smallest astrophysical scales, leaving entire classes of high-energy discoveries beyond our reach. Here we describe several science goals for which high quality X-ray imaging is crucial and the status of some current technologies or mission concepts that would be required for these advances. In particular, we discuss the Accretion Explorer, a mission architecture under current study for a dispersed aperture X-ray interferometer.
#### Molecular Gas Detections in Eight Faint DSFGs with Red NIR Colors at z = 1.2-2.5

 - **Abstract**
 We present a NOEMA survey of CO(3-2), CO(4-3), and [C I]($^3$P$_1$-$^3$P$_0$) in eight faint (average $S_{\rm 850 \mu m} = 2.3$ mJy) dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) at $z = 1.2-2.5$. We used a NIR flux-color cut to match faint SCUBA-2 sources to red stellar counterparts with existing spectroscopic redshifts, allowing us to target CO lines at known frequencies. We obtained seven new CO detections and a serendipitous [C I] detection in an off-axis source, and measured molecular gas masses of $M_{\rm mol} = (6-22)\times10^{10}~(\alpha_{\rm CO}/3.6)~{\rm M}_\odot$ from these lines. We performed UV-to-mm SED fits to measure the SFRs and stellar masses of our sample, and compared these with two other $z = 1-3$ CO samples from the literature. The CO detections have constant depletion times of $t_{\rm dep} \sim 500$ Myr, with no evidence for correlation between $t_{\rm dep}$ and redshift or main-sequence offset. We find that low-mass ($M_\star \lesssim 10^{11}~{\rm M}_\odot$), starbursting galaxies have gas fractions and depletion times twice as high as predicted by molecular gas scaling relations, which may indicate that $M_{\rm mol}$ is systematically over-estimated in this population, possibly due to decreased $\alpha_{\rm CO}$ or increased CO excitation compared to the well-studied massive and/or main-sequence DSFG population.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the variability of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) requires coordinated, multi-wavelength observations that span the electromagnetic spectrum. In this work, we focus on data from four key observatories: Chandra in the X-ray (2-8 keV), GRAVITY on the Very Large Telescope in the near-infrared (2.2 microns), Spitzer in the infrared (4.5 microns), and ALMA in the submillimeter (340 GHz). These multi-band observations are essential for probing the physics of accretion and emission near the black hole's event horizon, yet they suffer from irregular sampling, band-dependent noise, and substantial data gaps. These limitations complicate efforts to robustly identify flares and measure cross-band time lags, key diagnostics of the physical processes driving variability. To address this challenge, we introduce a diffusion-based generative model, for interpolating sparse, multivariate astrophysical time series. This represents the first application of score-based diffusion models to astronomical time series. We also present the first transformer-based model for light curve reconstruction that includes calibrated uncertainty estimates. The models are trained on simulated light curves constructed to match the statistical and observational characteristics of real Sgr A* data. These simulations capture correlated multi-band variability, realistic observation cadences, and wavelength-specific noise. We compare our models against a multi-output Gaussian Process. The diffusion model achieves superior accuracy and competitive calibration across both simulated and real datasets, demonstrating the promise of diffusion models for high-fidelity, uncertainty-aware reconstruction of multi-wavelength variability in Sgr A*.
