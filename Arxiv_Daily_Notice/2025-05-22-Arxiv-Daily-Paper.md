#### X-ray properties of compact elliptical galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 We present the X-ray analysis of seven local compact elliptical galaxies (cEGs), selected for their morphological resemblance to high-redshift red nuggets. As likely descendants of the red nugget population, cEGs offer a unique window into the early Universe, enabling the study of early galaxy evolution and the interplay between black holes, stellar bulges, and dark matter halos. Using data from Chandra and XMM-Newton, we investigate the properties of the hot gaseous halos in cEGs. Two galaxies - MRK 1216 and PGC 32873 - host luminous, spatially extended X-ray atmospheres, allowing us to derive radial thermodynamic profiles. For MRK 1216, we performed high-resolution spectral modeling with RGS data, which hints at super-solar $\alpha/\rm{Fe}$ abundance ratios. The remaining galaxies show either faint or undetected X-ray halos, though several display AGN-like (active galactic nucleus) power-law emission. In the context of local scaling relations, cEGs show only mild deviations from the general galaxy population, exhibiting a slightly steeper $M_{\star}-L_{X}$ relation and occupying the lower boundary of the $M_{\star}$-$M_{\rm vir}$ relation. These trends suggest that high-redshift red nuggets may also host a diverse range of X-ray atmospheres. We speculate that the compactness of cEGs may trace back to the population of `little red dots' (LRDs), hinting at a potential link between LRDs, red nuggets, and compact relic galaxies in the local Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 The nature of magnetic fields in the voids of the large-scale structure of the Universe has been a multifaceted open puzzle for decades. On one hand, their origin is not clear with most of the magnetogenesis models using physics beyond the standard model in the early Universe, and on the other hand, their existence and potential role in explaining the spectra of TeV blazars have been intensely debated in the past decade. Here, we show that void fields must exist and can be generated using classical electrodynamics in the late Universe. Specifically, we use the dipole component of the galactic fields, decaying as $r^{-3}$, and show that this generates space-filling magnetic fields in voids with sufficient amplitude to explain the blazar spectra and the lack of GeV halos observed by Fermi-LAT. Our results also show that the void fields might be too strong even for Cherenkov Telescope Array to observe the GeV halos. While primordial magnetic fields could still have been generated through some non-standard physics in the early Universe, our results show that the need for primordial magnetic fields is not strengthened by the presence of void magnetic fields.

 - **Abstract**
 We have analyzed publicly available optical spectra of PMN J0948+0022 obtained with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, X-Shooter, and the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE). Initially, PMN J0948+0022 was classified as a jetted narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy, but X-Shooter and MUSE observations, which have better spectral resolution, revealed a different profile for the H$\beta$ line, from Lorentzian to a composite one (a combination of a broad and a narrow Gaussian), more typical of intermediate Seyfert galaxies. According to the unified model, intermediate Seyferts are viewed at larger angles. However, we show that, in this case, the composite line profile results from the interaction of the powerful relativistic jet with the narrow-line region. The jet transfers part of its kinetic energy to the narrow-line region, producing flux changes in the H$\beta$ narrow component (drop by a factor of 3.4 from SDSS to X-Shooter), [O III]$\lambda$5007 core component (which nearly doubled from X-Shooter to MUSE), and its blue wing ($\Delta$v$\sim$200 km s$^{-1}$), which we interpret as evidence of an outflow. We also recalculated the physical parameters of this AGN, obtaining a black hole mass of $10^{7.8}$ M$_{\odot}$ and an Eddington ratio of $\sim$0.21 (weighted mean).

 - **Abstract**
 Binary stars and their interactions shape the formation of compact binaries, supernovae, and gravitational wave sources. The efficiency of mass transfer - the fraction of mass retained by the accretor during binary interaction - is a critical parameter that significantly impacts the final fate of these systems. However, this parameter is observationally poorly constrained due to a scarcity of well-characterized post-mass-transfer binaries. Be+sdOB binaries, consisting of a rapidly rotating Be star and a stripped hot subdwarf companion, are particularly valuable for studying mass transfer since they represent clear examples of past binary interaction. Recently, a significantly expanded observational sample of 16 Be+sdOB binaries with well-constrained masses was obtained through combined spectroscopic and interferometric observations. In this work, we compile and analyze this sample to provide robust constraints on the mass transfer efficiency in binaries that underwent stable mass transfer during the donor's hydrogen-shell burning phase. Our analysis reveals that mass transfer was predominantly conservative: half of the systems require mass transfer efficiencies above 50%. This challenges commonly adopted assumptions of highly non-conservative mass transfer in binary evolution modeling. Our findings are inconsistent with models that account for spin-up and limit accretion due to a centrifugal barrier. We also find tension with a commonly used mass transfer model in rapid population synthesis that limits accretion based on the thermal timescale of the accretor. These results have strong implications for almost all products of binary evolution including the variety of supernovae, white dwarfs, blue stragglers, runaway stars, X-ray binaries, and gravitational-wave sources.
#### Optimising the analysis of emission lines in galaxies: the case of the MUSE TIMER galaxy NGC 613

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy evolution is driven by spatially distributed processes with varying timescales. Integral field spectroscopy provides spatially-resolved information about these processes. Nevertheless, disentangling these processes, which are related to both the underlying stellar populations and the interstellar medium can be challenging. We present a case study on NGC~613, observed with MUSE (Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer) for the TIMER (Time Inference with MUSE in Extragalactic Rings) project, a local barred galaxy, which shows several gas ionisation mechanisms and is rich in both large and inner-scale stellar structures. We develop a set of steps to overcome fundamental problems in the modelling of emission lines with multiple components, together with the characterisation of the stellar populations. That results in the disentanglement of the gas ionisation mechanisms and kinematics, along with an optimal parametrisation for star formation history recovery. Our analysis reveals evidence of gas inflows, which are associated with the bar dust lanes traced with \textit{Hubble} Space Telescope (HST). In addition, we show the gas kinematics in a central biconical outflow, which is aligned with a radio jet observed with Very Large Array (VLA). The emission line provides estimates of electron density, gas-phase metallicity, and the mass outflow rate, allowing us to distinguish intertwined ionisation mechanisms and to identify a part of the multiphase gas cycle in NGC 613. It traces the gas kinematics from the bar lanes to inner scale gas reservoirs, where it can eventually trigger star formation or AGN activity, as observed in the outflow.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper we present the stellar Value-Added Catalogue (VAC) based on the DESI Data Release 1. This VAC contains stellar parameter, abundance and radial velocity measurements for more than 4 million stars. It also contains, for the first time, measurements from individual epochs for more than a million stars with at least two observations. The main contribution to the catalogue comes from the bright program of the main survey, which includes $\sim $2.5 million stars, and the backup program, which includes $\sim $ 1 million stars. The combined magnitude range for the stars in the catalogue extends from Gaia G $\sim 12$ to G $\sim 21$. For the magnitude range $17.5<G<21$ this catalogue represents a factor of 10 increase in the number of stars with radial velocity and abundance measurements compared to existing surveys. Despite DESI's resolution (R $\sim 2500-5000$), the median radial velocity random error for stars in the catalogue is better than 1 km s$^{-1}$. The stellar parameters and abundances of stars in DESI are measured by two independent pipelines, and after applying a temperature-dependent calibration, [Fe/H] abundances of high signal-to-noise stars are accurate to better than $\sim$ 0.1 dex when compared to high-resolution surveys. The catalogue probes different Galactic components including a particularly large number of distant stars: tens of thousands of stars further than 10 kpc, and thousands further than 50 kpc. The catalogue also contains several thousand extremely metal-poor stars with ${\rm [Fe/H]}<-3$. The released sample of stars includes measurements for thousands of stars that are members of dwarf galaxies, open and globular clusters as well as members of several dozen stellar streams. The next public DESI data release is expected in two years and will contain three times as many stars as DR1.

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal deformability of a 1.4 $M_\odot$ neutron star provides a pivotal window into the physics of dense nuclear matter, bridging gravitational-wave(GW), electromagnetic observations and nuclear physics. In this work, we present a novel, data-driven approach to constrain $\Lambda_{1.4}$ without invoking specific equation-of-state(EOS) models. By interpolating directly over the mass--tidal-deformability posteriors from GW170817, we obtain an EOS-independent constraint of $ \Lambda_{1.4} \;=\; 222.89_{-98.85}^{+420.33}. $ We further combine these GW-based results with the X-ray EOS-independent constraint from \cite{Huang_2025}, deriving a multimessenger limit of $ \Lambda_{1.4} \;=\; 265.18_{-104.38}^{+237.88}, $ which remains largely EOS agnostic. This framework demonstrates that higher-order terms neglected in linear expansion methods do not significantly affect $\Lambda_{1.4}$ estimates under current observational uncertainties. As gravitational-wave detectors improve in sensitivity and more binary neutron-star mergers are discovered, our purely data-driven strategy can serve as a robust standard baseline for extracting neutron-star interior properties without relying on unverified EOS models.

 - **Abstract**
 Accretion disks surrounding supermassive black holes can potentially form stars within the self-gravitating region. These stars undergo high accretion rates because of the dense environment of the active galactic nuclei (AGN) accretion disk. The vorticity of the AGN disk may influence the ultimate mass feeding rate toward the star. In our study, we simulate mass feeding rates onto stars at different AGN disk thicknesses through 3D numerical models to explore the relationship between feeding rates and the thermal mass of the star ($q_{\rm th}$), defined as the ratio of the star's Bondi radius to the AGN disk thickness. Our findings indicate that disk shearing with angular momentum can notably decrease the feeding rate, and we provide an approximate formula that links the feeding rate based on the angular momentum of the surrounding gas and the thermal mass $q_{\rm th}$. Lastly, we examine the potential feedback of the rapidly accreting stars on the AGN disk and their subsequent evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of the molecular and atomic gas properties of 10 spatially resolved galaxies in the A2626 cluster (z = 0.055), observed as part of the SYMPHANY project. Using CO(2-1) observations from ALMA and SMA, together with HI data from MeerKAT, we examine the interplay between gas phases and environmental influences. A joint morphological and kinematic analysis reveals that while the kinematic behavior of HI and CO are often similar, morphologically the atomic gas is more extended compared to centrally concentrated CO distributions, making it more susceptible to environmental stripping. However, we also find evidence for molecular gas asymmetries, disturbed velocity fields, and H2 deficiencies in some galaxies, indicating that H2 reservoirs can also be disrupted in dense environments. Compared to Virgo-a dynamically unrelaxed, non-cool-core cluster-A2626's relaxed, cool-core structure likely results in less intense ram-pressure stripping. This may allow galaxies to retain more atomic gas, while local interactions or pre-processing may still affect the molecular phase, causing relatively low HI deficiencies but high H2 deficiencies in A2626 galaxies. This is also reflected in the higher gas fractions, slightly elevated SFRs, along with shorter depletion timescales (0.3-3 Gyr), implying moderately enhanced star formation efficiency A2626 galaxies. Moreover, the lack of correlation between H2 deficiency and cluster-centric distance or velocity suggests that molecular gas evolution in A2626 may be shaped more by early infall or local interactions than by current cluster location.
#### Star formation at different stages of ram-pressure stripping as observed through far-ultraviolet imaging of 13 GASP galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxies undergoing ram-pressure stripping develop gaseous tails that can extend several kiloparsecs outside the galaxy disc. We used far-ultraviolet and H$\alpha$ imaging from the GASP survey to investigate how different stages of stripping affect star formation properties in the tail and disc of 13 galaxies undergoing stripping. These galaxies have different stripping strengths, as identified from the MUSE integral field spectroscopy. The star-forming knots in the disc and tails show a good correspondence between the measured FUV and H$\alpha$ flux. This is especially true for strong and extreme cases of stripping, which have developed extended ionized gaseous tails featuring clumpy structures. The mechanism behind the H$\alpha$ emission on the tails of these regions, which correlates well with FUV emission, is photoionization caused by young massive stars. The optical emission line ratio maps enable us to understand the emission mechanism, which can be attributed to star formation, LINER activity, or a combination of both phenomena and AGN. The star-forming regions in the emission line maps correspond well to the areas with significant FUV flux in these galaxies. Six galaxies exhibit minimal star formation in their tails, with two cases star formation is limited to the central regions and their discs are truncated. In galaxies with truncated discs, star formation is confined to a smaller region on the disc, as indicated by the FUV flux, compared to H$\alpha$. Galaxies with strong stripping are undergoing recent star formation and are likely recent infalls. Galaxies with truncated discs confine star formation to the center, likely because they have completed a cluster crossing that depleted most of their outer gaseous disc. Galaxies with minimal FUV flux along their tails exhibit unresolved H$\alpha$ emission which may be attributed to processes other than star formation.
#### Seoul National University AGN Monitoring Project. V. Velocity-resolved H-beta Reverberation Mapping and Evidence of Kinematics Evolution

 - **Abstract**
 We present velocity-resolved reverberation lags of H-beta for 20 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) from the Seoul National University AGN Monitoring Project. We detect unambiguous velocity-resolved structures in 12 AGNs, among which eight objects exhibit symmetric structures, two objects show inflow-like characteristics, and two objects display outflow-like signatures. For two AGNs, we successfully measure the velocity-resolved lags in different years, revealing evidence of evolving broad-line region (BLR) kinematics. By combining our sample with the literature velocity-resolved lags, we find that the symmetric velocity-resolved lags are the most common (40%) type among this sample. The frequency of inflow kinematics is also notable (20%), while outflow kinematics are less common (11%). Our sample significantly expands the previous velocity-resolved reverberation mapping sample in the high-luminosity regime, enabling us to constrain BLR kinematics across a large dynamic range of luminosity.
#### Extreme Fluctuations in the Sun's Activity over the Modern Maximum: Understanding the Enigmatic Solar Cycles 19-20

 - **Abstract**
 Over the past century, the Sun's activity -- which exhibits significant variations -- went through a phase known as the Modern Maximum. Notably, the strongest sunspot cycle on record during this period, and indeed since direct sunspot observations began, was cycle 19; this was followed by a significantly weaker cycle 20. Understanding and reconstructing this extreme variability has remained elusive. Utilizing data-driven, coupled models of magnetic field evolution on the Sun's surface and within its convection zone, here we show that random deviations in the tilt angle and polarity orientation of bipolar sunspot pairs is sufficient to explain these observed, extreme fluctuations during the modern maximum in solar activity. Our results support the theory that perturbation in the poloidal field source of the dynamo mechanism -- mediated via the emergence of anomalously tilted solar active regions - is the primary driver of extreme variations in the Sun's activity. This study has implications for understanding how the Sun may switch from a phase of extreme activity to quiescent, low activity phases -- such as the Maunder Minimum.
#### Impact of general relativistic accretion on primordial black holes

 - **Abstract**
 We demonstrate that general relativistic corrections to the accretion of relativistic matter onto primordial black holes (PBHs) can significantly enhance their mass growth during the early Universe. Contrary to previous Newtonian treatments, our analysis reveals that PBH masses can increase by an order of magnitude before evaporation, leading to substantial modifications of their lifetime and cosmological imprints. We quantify the resulting shifts in the minimum PBH mass constrained by Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), the revised lower bound for PBHs surviving today, and the dark matter parameter space allowed by PBH evaporation. Furthermore, we show that the enhanced accretion alters the high-frequency gravitational wave spectrum from PBH evaporation, potentially within the reach of future detectors. Our results provide a comprehensive, relativistically consistent framework to delineate the role of PBHs in early-universe cosmology and dark matter phenomenology.

 - **Abstract**
 A detailed understanding of cosmic-ray transport in galactic halos is essential for explaining various observations, such as the radio continuum measurements of synchrotron radiation from energetic electrons. Of central importance is the spatial diffusion tensor of cosmic rays, which can be computed in an ab initio manner if the turbulence in the background medium is known. The study aimed to establish a suitable framework to compute the evolution of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence and, hence, the diffusion tensor in the dynamical halos of galaxies. The Reynolds-averaged single-fluid MHD equation were solved numerically on a cylindrical grid, assuming axial symmetry and fixed boundary conditions on a central ellipsoid representing the galaxy. The physical properties of both large-scale MHD and small-scale turbulent quantities, including the coefficients of parallel and perpendicular diffusion, were extracted from the resulting steady state. Hydrodynamic validation revealed a persistent instability of the near-axis flow, which could be traced to the galaxy's gravitating mass. The results for the evolution of MHD turbulence in a galactic halo - using parameters approximating those of NGC4631 - enabled an ab initio computation of the spatial diffusion tensor of cosmic rays through the application of a state-of-the-art nonlinear theory. The simulation results reveal variation in turbulence quantities, (i.e., fluctuation energy, correlation scale, and cross helicity) in a dynamical halo. Furthermore, the corresponding diffusion tensor of cosmic rays exhibits significant variation throughout such a halo.
#### The PAU Survey: Measuring intrinsic galaxy alignments in deep wide fields as a function of colour, luminosity, stellar mass and redshift

 - **Abstract**
 We present the measurements and constraints of intrinsic alignments (IA) in the Physics of the Accelerating Universe Survey (PAUS) deep wide fields, which include the W1 and W3 fields from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS) and the G09 field from the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS). Our analyses cover 51deg$^{2}$, in the photometric redshift (photo-$z$) range $0.1 < z_{\mathrm{b}} < 1$ and a magnitude limit $i_{\mathrm{AB}}<22$. The precise photo-$z$s and the luminosity coverage of PAUS enable robust IA measurements, which are key for setting informative priors for upcoming stage-IV surveys. For red galaxies, we detect an increase in IA amplitude with both luminosity and stellar mass, extending previous results towards fainter and less massive regimes. As a function of redshift, we observe strong IA signals at intermediate ($z_{\mathrm{b}}\sim0.55$) and high ($z_{\mathrm{b}}\sim0.75$) redshift bins. However, we find no significant trend of IA evolution with redshift after accounting for the varying luminosities across redshift bins, consistent with the literature. For blue galaxies, no significant IA signal is detected, with $A_{1}=0.68_{-0.51}^{+0.53}$ when splitting only by galaxy colour, yielding some of the tightest constraints to date for the blue population and constraining a regime of very faint and low-mass galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Integrating the motion of stars in a smoothed potential is necessary in many stellar and galactic studies. Previous works have often used numerical integrators that alternate between linear drifts and velocity kicks (such as the Leapfrog scheme). This approach contrasts with the sophisticated methods developed in planetary dynamics, for which integrators alternate between Keplerian drifts and velocity kicks. Aims. Inspired by the splitting methods used in planetary dynamics, we aim to build an integration scheme dedicated to stellar and galactic dynamics. Methods. We took advantage of the properties of Hénon's isochrone potential to design a symplectic splitting scheme that can be used to integrate the motion of stars in any gravitational potential. This scheme alternates between isochrone drifts and velocity kicks. As a first application, we consider the motion of a star in a Plummer potential -- an essential constituent of galactic potentials -- and determine integration parameters that provide the best efficiency (i.e. best conservation of energy for lowest computational cost). Results. We derive the analytical solution for all kinds of orbits in Hénon's isochrone potential (bound and unbound trajectories) as needed in our integration scheme. Our experiments for stars in a Plummer potential show excellent performances in the inner and outer parts of the gravity field, that is, where the motion of stars is well approximated by isochrone trajectories (with perturbations of order $10^{-3}$ or less). For highly elongated orbits that cross the characteristic length of the Plummer potential, the performance is equivalent to that of previous methods. Conclusions. The splitting scheme presented here is a good alternative to previous methods: it performs at least as well, and up to orders of magnitude better, depending on the dynamical regime of the star.

 - **Abstract**
 Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) represent the most extreme solar products, showing complex and dynamic structures when detected in situ. They are often preceded by a shock and carry a magnetic cloud organised as a flux rope, surrounded and permeated by turbulent fluctuations, and whose radial size expands during propagation. We investigate the internal dynamics of the 2D section of a cylindrical flux rope propagating at constant velocity in the spherically expanding solar wind, employing the expanding box model, which allows for high spatial resolution. Our setting is simplified, with uniform and non-magnetised solar wind, to which we superpose turbulent fluctuations. We find that the spherically expanding geometry alone perturbs the flux rope equilibrium, producing a radial head-tail velocity profile and a radial size increase. The ratio between the expansion and Alfvén timescales, associated respectively to propagation and internal crossing time, controls the resistance to transverse stretching and the increase of the flux rope radial extent; the plasma beta controls the overall size of the structure. Turbulent fluctuations mainly affect the flux rope transverse structure, spreading its axial field at distances comparable to its size; on the contrary, dynamics along the radial direction remains coherent and the increase in radial size is still consistently observed. We validate our results by comparison with statistical observations and dimensionless estimates, such as the expansion parameter and the radial size scaling exponent, suggesting that the ratio between internal and propagation timescales might help in better classifying different kinds of radial expansions for flux ropes.

 - **Abstract**
 We developed a new model for the production and propagation of spectrally resolved primary and secondary Cosmic Ray (CR) nuclei elements within the framework of the Cosmic Ray Energy Spectrum (CRESP) module of the PIERNIK MHD code. We extend the algorithm to several CR nuclei and demonstrate our code's capability to model primary and secondary CR species simultaneously. Primary C, N, and O are accelerated in supernova (SN) remnants. In contrast, the spallation collisions of the primary nuclei against the thermal ISM protons lead to secondary Li, Be, and B products. All the CR species evolve according to the momentum-dependent Fokker-Planck equations that are dynamically coupled to the MHD system of equations governing the evolution of the ISM. We demonstrate the operation of this system in the gravity-stratified box, reproducing the Milky Way conditions in the Sun's local environment. We perform a parameter study by investigating the impact of the SN rate, CR parallel diffusion coefficient $D_\parallel$, and the rigidity-dependent diffusion coefficient power index $\delta$. A novel result of our investigation is that the Secondary to Primary flux ratio \BtoC grows when the diffusion coefficient grows, due to the weaker vertical magnetic field resulting from CR buoyancy effects. Moreover, a higher SN rate leads to lower values of \BtoC because of stronger winds and the shorter residence of primary CR particles in dense disk regions.

 - **Abstract**
 Future third-generation gravitational wave detectors like the Einstein Telescope (ET) and Cosmic Explorer (CE) are expected to detect millions of binary black hole (BBH) mergers. Alongside these advances, upcoming radio surveys, such as the Square Kilometer Array Observatory (SKAO) will provide new sets of cosmological tracers. These include mapping the large-scale distribution of neutral hydrogen (HI) using intensity mapping (IM), HI galaxies and radio continuum galaxies. In this work, we will investigate synergies between gravitational waves (GW) and radio tracers through a multi-tracer approach. We first forecast the precision on the clustering bias of GWs by cross-correlating data from an ET-like detector with an SKAO IM survey. Our results indicate that this approach can constrain the GW clustering bias to within $2\%$ up to $z = 2.5$. Additionally, we explore the potential of a triple cross-correlation using GWs, IM, and photometric galaxies from a survey like LSST. This multi-tracer method enhances constraints on the magnification lensing effect, achieving percent-level precision, and allows for a measurement of the Doppler effect with approximately $15\%$ uncertainty. Furthermore we show for the first time that this method could achieve the precision required to measure subdominant gravitational potential contributions to the relativistic corrections, which had thought to be below cosmic variance. Our analysis highlights the potential of cross-correlations between GWs and radio tracers to improve constraints on astrophysical properties of BBHs, measure relativistic effects, and perform null tests of GR in cosmological scales.

 - **Abstract**
 We update our stellar population models for the time evolution of the number and mass of massive remnants - neutron stars and black holes - with a new initial mass-remnant mass relation for core collapse supernovae. The calculations are based on hydrodynamical simulations and induced explosions of a subset of previously published pre-supernovae models spanning a wide range of stellar mass, metallicity and different values for rotation velocity. The resulting stellar population models predict lower numbers of neutron stars (by up to 0.3 dex) and higher numbers of black holes (by up to 0.8 dex), especially when stellar rotation is considered. The mass fraction locked in neutron stars and black holes is lowest in high-metallicity populations, with the largest number of remnants found at about half-solar metallicity. This mirrors the amount of available gas, ranging from 35 per cent to 45 per cent. We then apply our new models to IFU spectra for ~10,000 galaxies from the SDSS-IV/MaNGA survey for which we previously published spatially-resolved star formation histories. This allows us to probe spatially-resolved graveyards in galaxies of different types. The number and radial distribution of remnants depend on a galaxy's mass, star formation history and metal content. More massive and hence more metal-rich galaxies are found to host fewer remnants. Radial gradients in the number of remnants depend on galaxy mass mostly because of the mass-dependent profiles in mass density: the gradients are flat in low-mass galaxies, and negative in high-mass galaxies, particularly in Milky Way analogues.

 - **Abstract**
 We present high-resolution near-ultraviolet (NUV) and far-ultraviolet (FUV) deep imaging of the field around the Seyfert galaxy IC~4329A based on five observations performed with the Ultra-Violet Imaging Telescope (UVIT), onboard AstroSat. The long exposures of 82.9 ks in NUV (N245M; $\lambda_{mean}=2447$Å ; $\Delta\lambda = 270$Å) and 92.2~ks in FUV (F154W; $\lambda_{mean} = 1541$Å; $\Delta\lambda=380$Å) bands constitute the deepest observations with $5\sigma$ detection limits of AB magnitudes $m_{NUV}= 26.2$ and $m_{FUV} = 25.7$. Leveraging UVIT's excellent angular resolution (FWHM $\sim 1.2-1.8^{\prime \prime}$), we performed a detailed analysis of the IC~4329A field and detected (above 5$\sigma$ significance level) a total of 4437 and 456 sources in the NUV and FUV bands, respectively. A large number of these detected sources were unknown previously. We performed astrometry and photometry on all detected sources. By cross-matching our catalogue with Gaia-DR3 and XMM-Newton DR12 catalogues, we found 651 optical and 97 X-ray counterparts of our sources. Additionally, we explored UV variability of point sources, identifying 28 NUV sources as variable with a significance above the $2.5\sigma$ level. Of these, only three sources exhibited variability in the FUV band. Utilising the NUV and Gaia fluxes, we determined that two previously catalogued white dwarf candidates are misclassified. Furthermore, we highlight galaxies with atypical morphology, including ring-like structures, multiple compact central sources, bifurcating spiral arms, etc. Follow-up optical spectroscopy and multi-wavelength observations are imperative to further investigate the nature of the sources within this field.

 - **Abstract**
 Quasars, powered by gas accretion onto supermassive black holes, rank among the most energetic objects of the Universe. While they are thought to be ignited by galaxy mergers and affect the surrounding gas, observational constraints on both processes remain scarce. Here we unveil a major merging system at redshift $z \approx 2.7$, and demonstrate that radiation from the quasar in one galaxy directly alters the gas properties in the other galaxy. Our findings reveal that the galaxies, with centroids separated by only a few kiloparsecs and approaching each other at speed $\approx550\,$km$\,$s$^{-1}$, are massive, form stars, and contain a substantial molecular mass. Yet, dusty molecular gas seen in absorption against the quasar nucleus is highly excited and confined within cloudlets with densities $\sim 10^5$ - $10^6$ cm$^{-3}$ and sizes $<$0.02 pc, several orders of magnitude more compact than those observed in intervening (non-quasar) environments. This is also approximately 10$^5$ times smaller than currently resolvable through molecular-line emission at high redshifts. We infer that, wherever exposed to the quasar radiation, molecular gas is disrupted, leaving behind surviving dense clouds too small to give birth to new stars. Our results not only underscore the role of major galaxy mergers in triggering quasar activity, but also reveal localized negative feedback as a profound alteration of internal gas structure which likely hampers star formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. A defining characteristic of active galactic nuclei (AGN) that distinguishes them from other astronomical sources is their stochastic variability, which is observable across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Upcoming optical wide-field surveys, such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time, are set to transform astronomy by delivering unprecedented volumes of data for time domain studies. This data influx will require the development of the expertise and methodologies necessary to manage and analyze it effectively. Aims. This project focuses on optimizing AGN selection through optical variability in wide-field surveys and aims to reduce the bias against obscured AGN. We tested a random forest (RF) algorithm trained on various feature sets to select AGN. The initial dataset consisted of 54 observations in the r-band and 25 in the g-band of the COSMOS field, captured with the VLT Survey Telescope over a 3.3-year baseline. Methods. Our analysis relies on feature sets derived separately from either band plus a set of features combining data from both bands, mostly characterizing AGN on the basis of their variability properties and obtained from their light curves. We trained multiple RF classifiers using different subsets of selected features and assessed their performance via targeted metrics. Results. Our tests provide valuable insights into the use of multiband and multivisit data for AGN identification. We compared our findings with previous studies and dedicated part of the analysis to potential enhancements in selecting obscured AGN. The expertise gained and the methodologies developed here are readily applicable to datasets from other ground- and space-based missions.
