 - **Abstract**
 In data-driven scientific discovery, a challenge lies in classifying well-characterized phenomena while identifying novel anomalies. Current semi-supervised clustering algorithms do not always fully address this duality, often assuming that supervisory signals are globally representative. Consequently, methods often enforce rigid constraints that suppress unanticipated patterns or require a pre-specified number of clusters, rendering them ineffective for genuine novelty detection. To bridge this gap, we introduce CLiMB (CLustering in Multiphase Boundaries), a domain-informed framework decoupling the exploitation of prior knowledge from the exploration of unknown structures. Using a sequential two-phase approach, CLiMB first anchors known clusters using constrained partitioning, and subsequently applies density-based clustering to residual data to reveal arbitrary topologies. We demonstrate this framework on RR Lyrae stars data from the Gaia Data Release 3. CLiMB attains an Adjusted Rand Index of 0.829 with 90% seed coverage in recovering known Milky Way substructures, drastically outperforming heuristic and constraint-based baselines, which stagnate below 0.20. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis confirms CLiMB's superior data efficiency, showing monotonic improvement as knowledge increases. Finally, the framework successfully isolates three dynamical features (Shiva, Shakti, and the Galactic Disk) in the unlabelled field, validating its potential for scientific discovery.

 - **Abstract**
 JWST's "Little Red Dots" (LRDs) are increasingly interpreted as active galactic nuclei (AGN) obscured by dense thermalized gas rather than dust as evidenced by their X-ray weakness, blackbody-like continua, and Balmer line profiles. A key question is how LRDs connect to standard UV-luminous AGN and whether transitional phases exist and if they are observable. We present the "X-Ray Dot" (XRD), a compact source at $z=3.28$ observed by the NIRSpec WIDE GTO survey. The XRD exhibits LRD hallmarks: a blackbody-like ($T_{\rm eff} \simeq 6400\,$K) red continuum, a faint but blue rest-UV excess, falling mid-IR emission, and broad Balmer lines ($\rm FWHM \sim 2700-3200\,km\,s^{-1}$). Unlike LRDs, however, it is remarkably X-ray luminous ($L_\textrm{2$-$10$\,$keV} = 10^{44.18}\,$erg$\,$s$^{-1}$) and has a continuum inflection that is bluewards of the Balmer limit. We find that the red rest-optical and blue mid-IR continuum cannot be reproduced by standard dust-attenuated AGN models without invoking extremely steep extinction curves, nor can the weak mid-IR emission be reconciled with well-established X-ray--torus scaling relations. We therefore consider an alternative scenario: the XRD may be an LRD in transition, where the gas envelope dominates the optical continuum but optically thin sightlines allow X-rays to escape. The XRD may thus provide a physical link between LRDs and standard AGN, offering direct evidence that LRDs are powered by supermassive black holes and providing insight into their accretion properties.
#### Breathless BEARS: [O$_{\rm \,III}$] 88$μ$m Emission of Dusty Star-Forming Galaxies at $z = 3-4$

 - **Abstract**
 We present [O$_{\rm \,III}$] 88$\mu$m observations towards four ${\it Herschel}$-selected dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs; log$_{10}$ $\mu$L$_{\rm IR}$/L$_{\odot}$ = 13.5 - 14 at $z = 2.9 - 4$) using the Atacama Compact Array (ACA) in Bands 9 and 10. We detect [O$_{\rm \,III}$] emission in all four targets at >3$\sigma$, finding line luminosity ratios ($L_{\rm [O_{\rm \,III}]}$ / L$_{\rm IR}$ = 10$^{-4.2}$ to 10$^{-3}$) similar to local spiral galaxies, and an order of magnitude lower when compared with local dwarf galaxies as well as high-redshift Lyman-break galaxies. Using the short-wavelength capabilities of the ACA, these observations bridge the populations of galaxies with [O$_{\rm \,III}$] emission at low redshift from space missions and at high redshift from ground-based studies. The difference in [O$_{\rm \,III}$] emission between these DSFGs and other high-redshift galaxies reflects their more evolved stellar populations (> 10 Myr), larger dust reservoirs (M$_{\rm dust}$ $\sim$ 10$^{9 - 11}$ M$_{\odot}$), metal-rich interstellar medium ($Z \sim 0.5 - 2$ Z$_{\odot}$), and likely weaker ionization radiation fields. Ancillary [C$_{\rm \,II}$] emission on two targets provide $L_{[{\rm O}_{\rm \,III}]} / L_{[{\rm C}_{\rm \,II}]}$ ratios at 0.3 - 0.9, suggesting that ionized gas represents a smaller fraction of the total gas reservoir in DSFGs, consistent with theoretical models of DSFGs as transitional systems between gas-rich, turbulent disks and more evolved, gas-poor galaxies. Expanding samples of DSFGs with [O$_{\rm \,III}$] emission will be key to place this heterogeneous, poorly-understood galactic phase in its astrophysical context.
#### New Hard X-Ray and Multiwavelength Study of the PeVatron Candidate PWN G0.9+0.1 in the Galactic Center Region

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new X-ray study and multiwavelength spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling of the young pulsar wind nebula (PWN) powered by the energetic pulsar PSR J1747-2809, inside the composite supernova remnant (SNR) G0.9+0.1, located in the Galactic Center region. The source is detected by NuSTAR up to 30 keV with evidence for the synchrotron burnoff effect in the changing spatial morphology with increasing energy. The broadband 2-30 keV spectrum of PWN G0.9+0.1 is modeled by a single power law with photon index $\Gamma=2.11\pm0.07$. We combined the new X-ray data with the multiwavelength observations in radio, GeV, and TeV gamma rays and modeled the SED, applying a one-zone and a multi-zone leptonic model. The comparison of the models is successful, as we obtained physically compatible results in the two cases. Through the one-zone model, we constrain the age of the system to $\sim2.2$ kyr, as well as reproduce the observed PWN and SNR radio sizes. In both the one-zone and multi-zone leptonic models, the electron injection spectrum is well-described by a single power law with spectral index $p \sim 2.6$ and a maximum electron energy of $\sim2$ PeV, suggesting the source could be a leptonic PeVatron candidate. We estimate the average magnetic field to be $B_{\rm PWN} \sim 20\ \mu$G. We also report the serendipitous NuSTAR detection of renewed X-ray activity from the very faint X-ray transient XMMU J174716.1-281048 and characterize its spectrum.
#### Growing in number, passive in nature: tracing the evolution of the most massive quiescent galaxies since z ~ 0.8 with BOSS and DESI

 - **Abstract**
 Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) are among the most massive galaxies at any epoch, and lack ongoing star formation. As systems hosting most of the baryonic mass in the local Universe, they preserve imprints of the quenching mechanisms in the early Universe. We exploited the large BOSS and DESI spectroscopic datasets to perform the first homogeneous and continuous mapping of the evolution of stellar population properties of a complete sample of the most massive LRGs ($\log (M_*/\mathrm{M_\odot})> 11.5$) at 0.15 < z < 0.8. By consistently fitting the same spectral indices at all redshifts, we measured trends of [Fe/H], [alpha/Fe], and light-weighted age as a function of redshift. These galaxies exhibit a passive light-weighted age evolution and flat [Fe/H] and [alpha/Fe] trends towards lower redshift, indicating genuinely passive evolution. These trends are robust against the choice of stellar population models and analysis assumptions, and they support the predictions from IllustrisTNG, which predict negligible chemical evolution for the most massive quenched systems at z < 0.8. Our results suggest that, despite nearly 5 Gyr of cosmic time and a 3-4x increase in number density, the stellar population properties of massive quiescent galaxies remain essentially unchanged since z ~ 0.8. This shows a negligible progenitor bias below z ~ 0.8, and a genuinely passive evolution. Newly added systems after $z \sim 0.8$ were already largely quenched and chemically mature, while subsequent evolution was dominated by dry mergers without altering the bulk of the stellar populations.
#### The influence of magnetic fields in Cloud-Cloud Collisions

 - **Abstract**
 Cloud-cloud collisions are expected to trigger star formation by compressing gas into dense, gravitationally unstable regions. However, the role of magnetic fields in this process is unclear. We use SPH to model head-on collisions between two uniform density clouds, each with mass $500 \,$M$_{\odot}$, initial radius 2 pc, and embedded in a uniform magnetic field parallel to the collision velocity. As in the nonmagnetic case, the resulting shock-compressed layer fragments into a network of filaments. If the collision is sufficiently slow, the filaments are dragged into radial orientations by non-homologous gravitational contraction, resulting in a $\textit{Hub Filament}$ morphology, which spawns a centrally concentrated monolithic cluster with a broad mass function shaped by competitive accretion and dynamical ejections. If the collision is faster, a $\textit{Spiders Web}$ of intersecting filaments forms, and star-systems condense out in small subclusters, often at the filament intersections; due to their smaller mass reservoirs, and the lower probability of dynamical ejection, the mass function of star-systems formed in these subclusters is narrower. Magnetic fields affect this dichotomy quantitatively by delaying collapse and fragmentation. As a result, the velocity threshold separating $\textit{Hub Filament}$ and $\textit{Spiders Web}$ morphologies is shifted upward in magnetised runs, thereby enlarging the parameter space in which $\textit{Hub Filament}$ morphologies form, and enhancing the likelihood of producing centrally concentrated clusters. Consequently, magnetic fields regulate both the morphology and timing of star formation in cloud-cloud collisions: they broaden filaments, delay the onset of star formation, and promote the formation of $\textit{Hub Filament}$ morphologies, monolithic clusters and high-mass star-systems.

 - **Abstract**
 The Milky Way's Galactic Center hosts the black hole Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), which provides us with a close-up view into supermassive black hole accretion and feedback. Recent works have shown that the winds from $\sim 30$ Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars orbiting Sgr A* at about 4 arcsec are important contributors to feeding the supermassive black hole. A nuclear star cluster (NSC) with a mass of several $10^6 \, \text{M}_\odot$, of which $10^6 \, \text{M}_\odot$ is within 1 pc, also surrounds Sgr A*. The NSC contributes to the gravitational potential in the Galactic Center, affecting the orbits of the WR stars and their stellar winds. In this work, we examine the effects that the NSC has on the accretion of these stellar winds onto Sgr A* which have previously been neglected. We find that, on the parsec scale, the effect from the gravitational potential of the NSC is negligible on the wind-fed accretion flow, validating the existing simulations used in the literature.
#### Simulating the photospheric to coronal plasma using magnetohydrodynamic characteristics III: validation including gravity, flux emergence, and an eruption

 - **Abstract**
 Solar eruptions arise from instabilities or loss of equilibria in the solar atmosphere, but routinely inferring the precise magnetic and plasma properties that lead to eruptions is not currently practical using synoptic solar observations. Data driven simulations offer an appealing alternative. We test our boundary data-driven magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) approach, based on the method of characteristics, on a simulation that includes full MHD, a stratified atmosphere, and the emergence of a model solar magnetic active region, from the photosphere upwards. The driven simulation is tested against a larger, ab initio ``Ground Truth'' simulation that extends downward into the convection zone. Our driven simulation accurately reproduces the dynamic emergence of the active region above the photosphere, the formation of key topological features throughout the corona, and the subsequent eruption of mass and magnetic field. The total emerged energy matches to better than one percent, the ratio of emerged to eruptive energy is $\approx2\%$, and the actual values of each energy term agree to within $10\%$ between the two cases. Crucially, the data injection cadence, when properly scaled, matches the cadence of synoptic observations of the Sun's surface magnetic field, and is three to four orders of magnitude longer than the inherent CFL time step of the simulations. The stability of the code and fidelity of the results over an entire active region lifetime, from emergence to eruption, strongly suggests that our method will produce reliable results when driven using solar synoptic observations from existing and anticipated ground and spaced based observatories.
#### Magnetic Pumping: Plasma Heating to Particle Acceleration

 - **Abstract**
 One of the earliest mechanisms proposed for plasma heating was magnetic pumping (MP). However, its significance for astrophysical phenomena, including particle acceleration, has yet to be appreciated. MP-energized particles tap energy from magnetic-field oscillations. A particle's momentum component perpendicular to the local B-field increases during field growth by virtue of the adiabatic invariant $p_{\perp}^{2}/B=const$. The gained $p_{\perp}$ is then partially scattered elastically into the parallel momentum, $p_{\parallel}$, with $p^{2}=p_{\parallel}^{2}+p_{\perp}^{2}=const$, thereby retaining some fraction of the gained energy before the field decreases to its minimum. This scattering breaks the reversibility of energy exchange between particles and oscillating magnetic fields, thereby increasing the particle energy after each MP cycle. Field oscillations are often assumed to be sinusoidal, and the resulting MP is treated perturbatively. These simplifications restrict astrophysical applications, leaving objects with strong magnetic perturbations outside the scope of adequate treatment. We develop a nonperturbative approach to MP that is suitable for a broad spectrum of magnetic turbulence. The treatment comprises two steps. The first step is common: converting a kinetic equation into an infinite hierarchy of moments of the particle distribution function. The second step is new in MP treatments: we find an exact closure at an arbitrary level of the moment system. The heating is treated exactly at the second-moment closure. Particle acceleration generally requires a higher-level closure to determine the power-law index and the maximum energy of accelerated particles. We propose a method for extracting these crucial acceleration data from the second moment for a broadband random field.

 - **Abstract**
 Luminous infrared galaxies are key sites of obscured stellar mass assembly at z > 0.5. Their star formation rates (SFRs) are often estimated using the luminosities of the 6.2 micron and 11.2 micron polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) features, or those of the [Ne II] and [Ne III] fine-structure lines, as they are minimally affected by obscuration. It is uncertain whether the calibration of these features as SFR tracers depends on the starburst bolometric luminosity or the level of Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) activity. We here investigate the relationship between the luminosities of PAH and Neon lines with star formation rate for highly luminous objects using radiative transfer modeling and archival observations of 42 local Ultraluminous (>= 10^12 L_sun) Infrared Galaxies (ULIRGs). We find that PAH and [Ne II] features arise mainly in star-forming regions, with small contributions from the AGN or host, but that the [Ne III] line has a mixed contribution from both star formation and AGN activity. We present relations between L_PAH and L_NeII, and both starburst luminosity and SFR. We find relations for lower luminosity (L_IR ~= 10^10-10^12 L_sun) systems underestimate the SFRs in local ULIRGs by up to ~1 dex. The 6.2 micron and 11.2 micron PAH features, and the [Ne II] line, are thus good tracers of SFR in ULIRGs. We do not find that a more luminous AGN affects the relationship between SFR and PAH or Neon luminosity, but that it can make PAH emission harder to discern. Our results and derived relations are relevant to studies of star-forming and composite galaxies at z < 3 with the James Webb Space Telescope.
#### Are Recently Quenched Ellipticals Truly Isolated Centrals?

 - **Abstract**
 Recently Quenched Ellipticals (RQEs) provide a valuable test case for disentangling intrinsic and environmental quenching, particularly because they are commonly classified as isolated central galaxies in low-mass halos. However, central/satellite assignments and isolation labels can vary across group catalogs, and such misclassifications can strongly bias physical interpretations. We present a uniform, physically motivated reassessment of the environments of 155 RQEs previously identified as centrals in an SDSS-based group catalog. We construct value-added neighbor catalogs via KD-tree searches and apply consistent thresholds in projected separation and line-of-sight velocity to (i) verify centrality, (ii) quantify isolation using a mass-ratio-based companion criterion, and (iii) identify potential pseudo-centrals via proximity to massive clusters. We find that 132/155 (85.2\%) RQEs remain true centrals, while 23/155 (14.8\%) are better interpreted as misidentified centrals with a more massive neighbor within $R_{\rm proj}\leq0.8$~Mpc and $\Delta V\leq250$~km~s$^{-1}$. Among the true centrals, 110/132 (83.3\%) satisfy our isolation criterion, and only one system meets our pseudo-central definition, indicating that direct cluster-scale preprocessing is rare for RQE centrals. Using projected number density and surface stellar mass density, we show that misidentified and non-isolated systems occupy systematically denser regimes than isolated true centrals. These results imply that while most RQEs ($\sim$71\%) are consistent with predominantly internal quenching in genuinely isolated centrals, a non-negligible minority ($\sim$29\%) likely experienced environmentally influenced pathways at group scales.
#### Beyond UV: Rest-frame B-band and Apparent Luminosity Functions of z=5-9 Galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 We present new measurements of galaxy luminosity functions (LFs) from JWST/NIRCam imaging over the redshift range z=4.5-9.7, using photometric catalogs from JADES and public extragalactic fields. Our analysis includes rest-frame UV and B-band LFs, as well as apparent LFs in F090W, F115W, F200W, F356W, and F444W. We present the first constraints on the rest-frame B-band LF at z~7-8 and extend existing measurements at z~5 to M(B) = -18 mag. The B-band LFs evolve more strongly with redshift than UV LFs, though both decline more gradually than predicted by simulations at z>5. No single existing simulation reproduces all observed trends, with discrepancies likely driven by assumptions about binary evolution and stellar population synthesis models. The apparent LFs in F356W and F444W show hints of a bright-end excess at all redshifts, extending to fainter magnitudes at higher redshift. While extreme emission line galaxies may partially account for it, the excess may also indicate a population of moderately red, optically bright sources - potentially dusty star-forming galaxies or obscured AGNs. Finally, we find that rest-frame B-band luminosity correlates more tightly with stellar mass than UV, making it a powerful tracer of mass assembly and reinforcing the diagnostic value of rest-frame optical LFs in uncovering the physical processes that drive early galaxy formation.
#### Caught in Swallowtails: Discovery of Two Swallowtail Image Formations in MS 0451.6-0305

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of two swallowtail image formations at $z=2.91$ and $z=6.70$ behind the galaxy cluster MS 0451.6-0305 in JWST-NIRCam imaging. We find that in both of the above lensed systems, the complex image morphology cannot be reproduced by simple fold/cusp caustics, and detailed lens modeling reveals higher-order swallowtail caustic configurations. In the $z=2.91$ lens system, a small part of the source galaxy (which itself is part of a galaxy group) containing atleast two compact knots sits inside the swallowtail caustic, producing a quadruply imaged arc. At two of the image positions of these knots, we infer point source magnifications of $\gtrsim 300$, implying lensing-corrected effective radii of $\lesssim 0.8-1.5$ pc. The $z=6.70$ system exhibits even more complex image formation. We therefore only use the most confidently identified counter-images of knots in this system as constraints in our lens modeling. The resulting model predicts magnifications $\sim20-200$ and lensing-corrected effective radii of $\lesssim 0.8-18.5$ pc for various knots. Together, these two systems represent the first example of observations of multiple swallowtail image formations in a single galaxy cluster and demonstrate the ability of swallowtail caustics to magnify individual substructures at sub-parsec scales, from intermediate redshifts to the first billion years of the Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 A central goal in supernova (SN) research is to identify and characterize their progenitors. However, this is very difficult due to the limited archival images with sufficient depth and spatial resolution required for direct progenitor detection and due to the circumstellar dust which often biases the estimate of their intrinsic parameters. This field will be revolutionized by Euclid and the upcoming Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST), which conduct deep, wide-field, high-resolution and multi-band imaging surveys. We analyze their detection capability by comparing the model magnitudes of red supergiant (RSG) progenitors with the detection limits under different conditions, and we estimate the annual detection rates with Monte-Carlo simulations. We explore how to recover the intrinsic properties of SN progenitors with the help of radiation transfer calculations in circumstellar dust. We find the optical and near-infrared filters of the Euclid and CSST are highly effective for detecting RSG progenitors. We predict that archival images from the completed 2 surveys will enable $\lesssim13$ (or 24) progenitor detections per year within the mass range of 8--16 (or 8--25)M_\odot, an order of magnitude higher than the current detection rate of $\sim1$ detection per year. In the presence of circumstellar dust, the emerging spectral energy distribution (SED) of the progenitor is mainly affected by the optical depth and is almost independent of dust temperature in the Euclid and CSST filters. Our mock tests demonstrate that one can derive the progenitor mass and dust optical depth simultaneously by fitting the observed SED over the 11 filters of the 2 surveys while fixing the dust temperature to a typical value. Euclid and CSST will significantly enlarge the sample of direct progenitor detections with accurate mass measurements, which is crucial to resolve the long-standing RSG problem.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a physical characterization of TMTS J00063798+3104160 (J0006), a rapidly rotating,ultra-massive white dwarf (WD) identified in high-cadence light curves from the Tsinghua University-Ma Huateng Telescope for Survey (TMTS). A coherent 23-minute periodicity is detected in TMTS, TESS, and ZTF photometry. A time series of low-resolution spectra with the Keck-I 10 m telescope reveals broad, shallow hydrogen absorption features indicative of an extreme magnetic field and shows no evidence for radial-velocity variations. Atmospheric modeling yields a magnetic field strength of $\sim$ 250 MG, while Gaia astrometry and photometry imply a mass of 1.06 $\pm$ 0.01 M$_{\odot}$. A significant infrared excess is detected in the WISE W1 band and is well fitted by a 550 K blackbody, likely arising from residual material of a merger. We interpret the 23-minute photometric modulation as the rotation period of an isolated, massive WD formed likely through the merger of a double WD binary. With one of the shortest rotation periods known among candidate merger remnants and with constraints from a deep Einstein Probe X-ray nondetection, J0006 provides a rare and important observational window into the poorly explored intermediate stages of post-merger evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Helioseismic and recent asteroseismic observations reveal fine structure in the power spectrum with alternating peaks and troughs above the acoustic cut-off frequency. This structure is interpreted as the interference patterns of high-frequency acoustic waves excited in the solar interior and propagating into the atmosphere, known as pseudomodes. Pseudomodes exhibit clear solar-cycle variability, with frequency shifts that occur predominantly in anti-phase with the activity cycle, although the underlying mechanism remains uncertain. This work investigates how the subsurface excitation source location and the photospheric acoustic cut-off frequency influence the formation, frequency distribution, and solar-cycle variability of pseudomodes. We employ an analytical Klein-Gordon subsurface cavity model, which is shown to act as an effective Fabry-Pérot interferometer for high-frequency waves that experience constructive and destructive interference between the source location and the lower turning point. We derive an effective dispersion relation isolating the effects of the source location and photospheric cut-off on the pseudomode frequency. The model reproduces the observed peak-trough pseudomode spectrum for reasonable parameter values constrained by Bayesian MCMC best-fitting to GONG observations. We also find that solar-cycle-associated 11-year modulations of the source location result in anti-phase pseudomode frequency shifts, whereas similar cyclic variations in the cut-off frequency produce harmonic-dependent behaviour, yielding both in-phase and anti-phase shifts. As the acoustic cut-off and mode excitation relate to stratification and flows in the solar interior, the results highlight pseudomodes as a powerful diagnostic tool for changes in subsurface solar and stellar structure through the solar cycle.

 - **Abstract**
 The 21-cm global signal, a treasure trove of information about the nature of the first luminous sources of the Universe, has traditionally been modelled assuming that these early sources were predominantly star-forming galaxies. However, recent observations by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have revealed several AGNs as early as z ~ 10 - 10.4 . In light of this, it is important to investigate the contribution of such AGNs to the 21-cm signal. Assuming that these AGNs are seeded by Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) and employing an analytical PBH model, consistent with existing cosmological and astrophysical constraints, we show that these exotic objects can have a significant impact on the redshift evolution of the global signal.

 - **Abstract**
 Low--luminosity gamma-ray bursts (LLGRBs) are promising candidates for high-energy neutrinos, yet no coincident neutrino events have been detected so far. Recent advances in X-ray time-domain astronomy, together with the development of next-generation neutrino telescopes, open new opportunities for joint X-ray and neutrino observations of these transients. We calculate the jet dynamical evolution and the associated neutrino production for both non-magnetized and magnetized outflows. For individual events, joint X-ray and neutrino detection is generally limited to nearby LLGRBs or sources with high luminosities. Thus, we consider a next-generation neutrino telescope with an effective area enhanced by a factor of $\sim30$ relative to IceCube. In the non-magnetized scenario, joint detection of individual events is enabled for sources with typical isotropic luminosities of $L_{\mathrm{iso}}\sim10^{47}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$ out to luminosity distances of $D_L\sim1.6\times10^{2}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$, corresponding to an expected detection rate of order $1$ per year. In contrast, for the magnetized scenario at the same luminosity, the accessible distance is significantly reduced, with joint observations confined to sources within $D_L\sim6.5\times10^{1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$ and an expected detection rate of order $0.5$ per year. For stacked samples of $\sim100$ magnetized LLGRBs, stacking substantially enlarges the accessible distance range, enabling joint observations for sources with representative luminosities of $L_{\mathrm{iso}}\sim1\times10^{47}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$ out to $D_L\lesssim7.0\times10^{2}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$ and corresponding to an expected detection rate of order $2$ per year. These results demonstrate that joint X-ray and next-generation neutrino observations enable a practical multimessenger probe of LLGRBs.

 - **Abstract**
 The bending of radio galaxies in galaxy clusters is expected to be caused by interactions with the local environment. The physical processes responsible for jet bending, and their influence on the polarization properties of radio galaxies, remain poorly understood, leading to the question of whether jet properties in bent radio galaxies differ from those in linear radio galaxies. Using a sample of 24 polarized bent radio galaxies, observed with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array at 1--2 GHz, we test for correlation of bending angle with polarization parameters measuring Faraday rotation, intrinsic fractional polarization, and Faraday rotation dispersion, used here as a measure of turbulence along the line of sight. We find no statistically significant correlations. At the spatial resolution of our dataset (3--46 kpc, median 18.4 kpc), our results indicate that we are primarily probing larger-scale intracluster medium effects not related to bending angle. The absence of a statistically significant correlation suggests that bent radio galaxies are reliable probes of intracluster magnetic fields, because their intrinsic properties do not appear to introduce systematic biases into measured polarization parameters. We do detect a preference for source magnetic field vectors to align with the direction of jet bending. Finally, we estimate that the POSSUM and SKA surveys will contain $\gtrsim$300 and $\gtrsim$1000 polarized radio galaxies, respectively, providing large future samples with a range of bending angles and similar redshift distribution and number of beams per source as in our sample, enabling our results to be tested with greater statistical power.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the correlation between ionized gas outflows, jets, and star formation in a sample of 42 local type-I active galactic nuclei (AGNs) exhibiting significant [O III] outflows. This study uses both new submillimeter (sub-mm) observations and archival data from the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope. Our analysis, which includes a correction for jet emission in the sub-mm bands, fitting spectral energy distribution, and analyzing spectra, enables us to derive star-formation rates (SFRs) through various methods. By comparing radio power and SFRs, we select a sub-sample of jetted AGNs of which radio emission is mostly from the jets. We find that jetted AGNs predominantly lie above the main sequence of star-forming galaxies, suggesting a correlation between jet activity and star formation. By comparing dust extinction, we demonstrate that jetted AGNs do not have more dust which is the fuel of both star formation and AGN activity. Therefore, this correlation is more likely to arise from AGN feedback. We also find that the Eddington ratio does not impact the specific SFRs (sSFRs) of our sample. Additionally, for jetted AGNs, stronger radio emission corresponds to higher sSFRs, suggesting that jet emission may promote star formation, i.e., positive feedback. Our results not only shed light on the feedback mechanisms of AGNs but also underscore the complex interplay between black hole activity and star formation in galaxy evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Long Period Transients (LPTs) are a recently identified class of sources characterized by periodic radio bursts lasting seconds to minutes, with flux densities that might reach several tens of Jy. These radio bursts repeat with periodicity from minutes to hours, and they exhibit strong polarization and transient activity periods. To date, about 12 such sources have been identified, which might encompass the same or different physical scenarios. Proposed explanations include binary systems with a white dwarf and a low-mass star companion, slow-spinning magnetars, highly magnetized isolated white dwarfs, and other exotic objects. In a few cases the optical counterpart indeed points toward a white dwarf with a low-mass companion, while in other cases, transient X-ray emission was detected, very common in magnetars. However, despite being able to reproduce partially some of the characteristics of LPTs, all the proposed scenarios find difficulty in explaining the exact physical origin of their bright, highly polarized and periodic radio emission. We review here the state-of-the-art in the observations and interpretation of this puzzling class of radio transients.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyzed optical/near-IR Large Binocular Telescope spectra of 16 sources alerted by Gaia between 2021 and 2024 due to significant photometric variability. Half of the spectra were taken during quiescence and the rest during a burst or at intermediate brightness. Our analysis of their ten-year light curves and photometric/spectroscopic features provide evidence that all 16 sources are accreting Young Stellar Objects (YSOs). One object, Gaia23bab, is a known EXor source. Other light curves either have peaks over a stable baseline, or significant variability throughout the entire observation period, suggesting multiple contributing processes. All spectra exhibit emission lines from accretion columns, and over half of them show atomic forbidden lines as signatures of outflowing gas. We determined stellar parameters, accretion luminosity (Lacc) and mass accretion rate (Macc) at different brightness phases. Only two sources showed variability primarily due to extinction. During quiescence, our sources exhibit Lacc and Macc values typical of T Tauri and Herbig Ae/Be (HAEBE) sources, supporting the hypothesis that any YSO may undergo episodic accretion. In bursts, the Lacc and Macc of sources with photometric variations exceeding 2 mag follow a shallower relation with stellar luminosity and mass, typical of known EXor sources. This group includes one Class I, one flat-spectrum, and two Class II sources. Notably, the other Class I source, Gaia24beh, shows an Lacc value about ten times higher than typical EXor bursts of the same mass. In the other cases, Lacc and Macc align with variability seen in T Tauri and HAEBE sources.

 - **Abstract**
 Planet population synthesis is an integral tool for linking exoplanets to their formation environments. Most planet population synthesis studies have focused on the carbon-to-oxygen ratio (C/O) in gas or solids, yet more insight into planet formation may be afforded by considering a wider suite of elements. Sulfur is one such key element. It has been assumed to be entirely refractory in population synthesis models, restricting it to being a tracer of accreted rocky solids. However, sulfur also has a volatile reservoir dominant at the onset of star and planet formation. We investigate sulfur's wider potential as a formation history tracer by implementing the first multi-phase treatment of S in a planet population synthesis model. We present the planet formation module of \textsc{sponchpop} and its first predicted planet growth tracks and populations. We explore the diversity of planet compositions in terms of their sulfur budget, including both refractory and volatile components, and apply a novel gas-grain conversion of sulfur to study how formation trajectories of giant planets relate to final core and envelope compositions. We show that planets inherit a wide range of core and envelope sulfur content related to accretion history while considering late-stage planetesimal infall, providing a new diagnostic tool for planet formation. The diverse sulfur content of planet cores suggests some rocky planets may be born sulfur-poor, with implications for their geochemistry and habitability. Enhanced sulfur abundances in gas-giant atmospheres can be attributed to formation beyond the H2S iceline, such as the giants in our Solar System.
#### Origins of the UV continuum and Balmer emission lines in Little Red Dots: observational validation of dense gas envelope models enshrouding the AGN

 - **Abstract**
 We present a statistical study on the origins of the UV continuum and narrow/broad emission lines in little red dots (LRDs), a newly discovered class of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Leveraging all archived JWST/NIRSpec data, we build a sample of 28 spectroscopically-confirmed LRDs at $5<z_{\rm spec}<7.2$, by requiring broad H$\alpha$ emission, blue UV colors, V-shaped continua, and compact morphologies. We define a control sample of 9 blue, compact, broad-line AGNs without red optical continua (hereafter little blue dots; LBDs), and examine correlations between rest UV and the narrow/broad H$\alpha$ luminosities in these populations. In LRDs, both narrow and broad H$\alpha$ components are tightly correlated with the UV continuum, and the luminosity ratios are consistent with those in young starburst galaxies. In contrast, the UV to broad H$\alpha$ ratios in LBDs closely match local unobscured AGNs and are statistically different from LRDs. The Ly$\alpha$ occurrence rates and strengths do not differ between LRDs and LBDs and are comparable to normal star-forming galaxies. These results are consistent with a scenario where the central BH in LRDs is enshrouded by a dense opaque gas envelope -- in this model, the UV continuum as well as narrow and even broad H$\alpha$ emissions are not powered by AGNs but predominantly by young massive stars surrounding the envelope, while the envelope radiates as a $\sim 5000$ K blackbody. As the envelope dissipates, direct AGN emission can emerge, potentially transforming LRDs into LBDs and marking the end of a short-lived phase of rapid black hole growth.

 - **Abstract**
 We present new Hubble Space Telescope (HST) UV spectra of the K2 V star HD 166620, the first star clearly recognized to be in a "magnetic grand minimum" state analogous to the Sun's "Maunder Minimum" in the late 1600's. The stellar H I Lyman-alpha surface fluxes are extremely low, about a factor of two below fluxes observed during solar minimum, and also significantly lower than those of Tau Ceti (G8 V) and HD 191408 (K2.5 V), two stars more similar to HD 166620 in spectral type and age (~10 Gyr) than the Sun. The Tau Ceti data that are compared with HD 166620 include both old archival data and a new HST observation as well. The Lyman alpha data are used to confirm a nondetection of astrospheric Lyman-alpha absorption for this star, suggesting a very weak wind with Mdot<0.1 Mdot_sun. The very compact astrosphere inferred for Tau Ceti indicates that the star's debris disk is at least partly exposed to the ISM, and we discuss possible consequences.

 - **Abstract**
 The scarcity of high-fidelity extinction measurements remains a bottleneck in deriving accurate stellar properties from Gaia parallaxes. In this work, we aim to derive precision extinction estimates for APOGEE DR19 stars, establishing a new benchmark for Galactic stellar population studies. We first determine reddening by comparing observed colorsr, etrieved from photometric surveys or standardized synthetic magnitudes from Gaia BP/RP spectra, to intrinsic colors predicted via an XGBoost model. The model is trained on minimally reddened stars to infer intrinsic colors and their associated uncertainties, using APOGEE stellar parameters (Teff, logg, [Fe/H], and [alpha/Fe]). The derived reddening values are then converted into extinctions using an anchor ratio of A_BP / A_RP = 1.694 +/- 0.004, derived from red-clump-like stars. Here, we provide extinction measurements in 39 filters across 10 photometric systems and introduce a new empirical extinction curve optimized for broadband passbands. Our extinction estimates (Av) outperform existing results (Bayestar19, StarHorse, SEDEX), achieving a typical precision of 0.03 mag in Av. Notably, we identify systematic deviations of up to 30% between monochromatic and passband-integrated extinction ratios at wavelengths greater than 700 nm. This result highlights the necessity of adopting passband-specific coefficients when correcting extinction to derive stellar parameters. As the foundation for a forthcoming series of papers, these benchmark measurements will be used to (1) revise asteroseismic scaling relations, (2) calibrate differential reddening in open clusters, and (3) reconcile heterogeneous dust maps into a unified, all-sky extinction scheme.

 - **Abstract**
 The Galaxy's most common known planetary systems have several Earth-to-Neptune-size planets in compact orbits. At small orbital separations, larger planets are less common than their smaller counterparts by an order of magnitude. The young star V1298 Tau hosts one such compact planetary system, albeit with four planets that are uncommonly large (5 to 10 Earth radii). The planets form a chain of near-resonances that result in transit-timing variations of several hours. Here we present a multi-year campaign to characterize this system with transit-timing variations, a method insensitive to the intense magnetic activity of the star. Through targeted observations, we first resolved the previously unknown orbital period of the outermost planet. The full 9-year baseline from these and archival data then enabled robust determination of the masses and orbital parameters for all four planets. We find the planets have low, sub-Neptune masses and nearly circular orbits, implying a dynamically tranquil history. Their low masses and large radii indicate that the inner planets underwent a period of rapid cooling immediately after dispersal of the protoplanetary disk. Still, they are much less dense than mature planets of comparable size. We predict the planets will contract to 1.5-4.0 Earth radii and join the population of super-Earths and sub-Neptunes that nature produces in abundance.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of active galactic nuclei have revealed a correlation between millimeter luminosity, X-ray luminosity, and mass, suggesting the emission in each of these bands is powered by a common source. Starting with a set of five general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations with dynamically important magnetic fields, we perform ray-tracing calculations to produce spectra including synchrotron emission, bremsstrahlung emission, and Compton scattering. Our models with similar Eddington ratios to the objects for which the relationship was inferred naturally reproduce observations without tuning. Our lower Eddington ratio models depart from this relationship, likely attributable to an observational bias against extremely low accretion rates. We find that inverse Compton scattering dominates the production of X-rays over bremsstrahlung radiation in almost all models, and in all models consistent with the observed correlation. We find only a modest spin dependence in this relationship. This study demonstrates that a compact, hot accretion flow with dynamically important magnetic fields can naturally explain observed millimeter and X-ray properties in low-luminosity active galactic nuclei. Future work should explore the impacts of non-thermal electron populations, weaker magnetic fields, and radiative cooling.

 - **Abstract**
 We present spatially resolved spectroscopic observations of the planetary nebula NGC 6720, the Ring Nebula, taken during the science verification phase of WEAVE, a new instrument mounted on the William Herschel Telescope on La Palma. We use the instrument's Large Integral Field Unit (LIFU) to obtain spectra of the Ring Nebula, covering its entire optically bright inner regions as well as parts of its much fainter outer molecular halo. We report the discovery of emission from [Fe~{\sc v}] and [Fe~{\sc vi}] confined to a narrow ``bar'' extending across the central regions of the nebula. No lines of other elements share this morphology or, at the spectral resolving power used ($R \sim 2500$), the same radial velocity. The extent to which iron in this bar is depleted is presently unclear; comparison with JWST-detected dust continuum emission suggests that some dust grain destruction may be occurring in the region, but there is currently no observational evidence for the $>$ 50~km\,s$^{-1}$ shock waves or $T > 10^6$~K X-ray emitting gas needed to enable this. Where the bar is located along the line of sight through the nebula, and how it was created, are new puzzles to be solved for this iconic planetary nebula.

 - **Abstract**
 In recent years, a two-dimensional (2D) coronal seismology technique applied to spectral-imaging data from the Coronal Multi-channel Polarimeter (CoMP) and UCoMP has enabled routine measurement of the global coronal magnetic field. The technique combines coronal transverse wave phase speed from Doppler measurements with electron densities from the Fe \sc{xiii}\rm{} 10798/10747 Å intensity ratio to infer the magnetic field strength, while the wave propagation directions from Doppler measurements trace the magnetic field direction. To validate the accuracy and robustness of this method, we use forward modeling of a MURaM simulation that produces open and closed magnetic structures with excited waves. From the synthetic Doppler velocity, Fe \sc{xiii}\rm{} infrared line intensities, and linear polarization signals, we apply the 2D coronal seismology technique to estimate the magnetic field strength and direction. A comparison with the simulation ground truth shows close agreement, indicating that the technique can recover the line-of-sight emissivity-weighted magnetic field direction and strength with high accuracy. We also perform a parameter-space analysis to quantify sensitivities of the method to parameter choice. These findings provide practical guidance for CoMP/UCoMP-like analysis and demonstrate that 2D coronal seismology can deliver reliable, LOS emissivity-weighted measurements of the coronal magnetic field from coronal wave observations.

 - **Abstract**
 The near-Earth asteroid 2024 YR4 -- a $\sim$60 m rocky object that was once considered a potential Earth impactor -- has since been ruled out for Earth but retained a $\sim$4.3% probability of striking the Moon in 2032. Such an impact, with equivalent kinetic energy of $\sim$6.5 Mt TNT, is expected to produce a $\sim$1 km crater on the Moon, and will be the most energetic lunar impact event ever recorded in human history. Despite the associated risk, this scenario offers a rare and valuable scientific opportunity. Using a hybrid framework combining Monte Carlo orbital propagation, smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) impact modeling, and N-body ejecta dynamics, we evaluate the physical outcomes and propose the observation timelines of this rare event. Our results suggest an optical flash of visual magnitude from -2.5 to -3 lasting several minutes directly after the impact, followed by hours of infrared afterglow from $\sim$2000 K molten rock cooling to a few hundred K. The associated seismic energy release would lead to a global-scale lunar reverberation (magnitude $\sim$5.0) that can be detectable by modern seismometers. Furthermore, the impact would eject $\sim$10$^8$ kg of debris that escapes the lunar gravity, with a small fraction reaching Earth to produce a lunar meteor outburst within 100 years. Finally, we integrate these results into a coordinated observation timeline, identifying the best detection windows for ground-based telescopes, lunar orbiters, and surface stations.

 - **Abstract**
 To evaluate impact of temporal evolution and commonly used harmonic filtering of magnetograms, and the empirically defined oversimplified heating source terms on open-field distributions, we use a series of hourly-updated magnetograms, preprocessed by the 10th- and 50th-order filtered PF solvers, to drive COCONUT, configured with different heating prescriptions, to mimic coronal evolutions during CRs 2282 and 2283. We evaluate the simulated open magnetic flux at 1.01~$R_s$, 3~$R_s$, and 0.1~AU, and compare them with interplanetary observations. The results show that the simulated unsigned open flux evaluated near the solar surface can be comparable to that derived from interplanetary in situ observations. However, in low corona, numerous small-scale closed-field magnetic structures introduce magnetic polarity inversion interfaces within the open field, cancelling part of the open field near these interfaces during the volume-integration procedure of the finite-volume method. Consequently, the simulated unsigned open flux can be reduced by up to 45% at 0.1~AU and decreases more rapidly in the low corona. The results also indicate that moderate adjustments to the heating source term can effectively regulate the magnitude of the unsigned open magnetic flux. Preprocessing the initial magnetogram by a PF solver with limited spherical harmonics can reduce the open flux in the low corona and alter the distribution of open-field regions, but has little effect on the total unsigned open flux at larger heliocentric distances. The ratio of the maximum to minimum open unsigned magnetic flux can reach 1.4 within a single solar maximum CR. These findings highlight the necessity of considering finer grid resolution around magnetic polarity inversion interfaces, more realistic heating mechanisms, and the time-evolving regime of MHD coronal modelling when further addressing the ``open flux problem".

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate late-time cosmic acceleration in $f(R,L_m)$ gravity driven by nonlinear matter contributions, focusing on the class $f(R,L_m)=R/2+c_1 L_m+c_n L_m^{n}+c_0$ with the explicit choice $L_m=\rho_m$ and an uncoupled radiation sector. We analyze two realizations: (i) Case A: $f(R,L_m)=R/2+\beta \rho_m^{n}+\gamma$, where $\gamma$ acts as a vacuum term, and (ii) Case B: $f(R,L_m)=R/2+\beta \rho_m+\gamma \rho_m^{n}$, where the nonlinear sector can mimic dark energy without an explicit cosmological constant. For each case, we construct a bounded autonomous system, classify all critical points and their stability, and compute cosmographic diagnostics. The phase-space analysis shows that Case A reproduces the standard radiation$\to$matter$\to$de~Sitter sequence only for $n\gtrsim 4/5$, with acceleration essentially enforced by the vacuum term. In contrast, Case~B admits a qualitatively distinct and phenomenologically appealing branch: for $0<n<1/2$ the system possesses a physical \emph{scaling} de~Sitter future attractor inside the bounded simplex, yielding radiation$\to$matter$\to$acceleration with $q=-1$ and $\omega_{\rm eff}=-1$ and without introducing $c_0$. We confront both models with background data (CC, Union3, DESI BAO, plus a BBN prior on $\Omega_b h^2$) using nested sampling and perform model comparison via Bayesian evidence and AIC/BIC. The full data combination constrains $n=1.08\pm0.05$ in Case A and $n=0.05\pm0.10$ in Case B (68\% CL), the latter lying within the accelerating window while remaining statistically consistent with $\Lambda$CDM kinematics at the background level. We also record minimal consistency conditions for stability (tensor no-ghost and luminal propagation) and motivate a dedicated perturbation-level analysis as the next step to test growth and lensing observables.
