 - **Abstract**
 The Mars Life Explorer (MLE) mission concept offers a critical opportunity to investigate whether extant life exists within the mid-latitude ice deposits of Mars. However, MLE's current science traceability matrix emphasizes habitability assessment and organic chemistry over direct life detection. As crewed missions to Mars may occur as early as 2040, the window for uncontaminated robotic exploration is rapidly closing. A high-confidence determination of Martian life must be achieved before irreversible anthropogenic contamination compromises scientific integrity. This paper evaluates the scientific, technical, and policy limitations of the current MLE architecture and recommends specific instrumentation upgrades and governance measures necessary to enable definitive and agnostic life detection while safeguarding planetary protection.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent surveys show that $z>2$ quasars are surrounded by Hydrogen Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) glows with diverse emission levels and extents. These seem to depend on the activity of embedded quasars, the number of active galactic nucleus (AGN) photons able to reach the halo gas or circumgalactic medium (CGM) and the physical properties of the CGM. In this framework, we present VLT/MUSE snapshot observations (45 min/source) of 59 $z\sim3$ quasars extending the long-term QSO MUSEUM campaign to fainter SDSS sources. The whole survey now targets 120 quasars with a median redshift of $z$=3.13, and bolometric luminosities, black hole masses and Eddington ratios of $45.1<\log(L_{\rm bol}/[{\rm erg\,s^{-1}]})<48.7$, $7.9<\log(M_{\rm BH}/[{\rm M_{\odot}]})<10.3 $ and $0.01<\lambda_{\rm Edd}<1.8$, respectively. We detect extended Ly$\alpha$ emission in 110/120 systems, with all non-detections in the new fainter sample. Stacking non-detections unveils emission below our individual detection limit. The Ly$\alpha$ surface brightness (SB$_{\rm Ly\alpha}$) of the CGM increases with quasar luminosity. Moreover, the Ly$\alpha$ linewidth increases in the central regions (projected radius $R<40$ kpc or $\sim$40% $R_{\rm vir}$) of the CGM around brighter quasars. These trends indicate that we are witnessing the instantaneous AGN feedback in action on CGM scales. Assuming that all targeted quasars sit in halos of $M_{\rm DM}\sim10^{12.5}\,M_\odot$, as found in clustering studies, the trend in SB$_{\rm Ly\alpha}$ can be explained by larger fractions of cool gas mass illuminated, implying that brighter quasars have larger ionization cone opening angles. Similarly, brighter AGNs seem to perturb the cool ($T\sim10^4$ K) gas more strongly. We show that QSO MUSEUM now has enough statistics to study the instantaneous AGN feedback while controlling for black hole properties, which are key to constraining AGN models.
#### Variable X-ray reverberation in the rapidly accreting AGN Ark 564: the response of the soft excess to the changing geometry of the inner accretion flow

 - **Abstract**
 X-ray reverberation, which exploits the time delays between variability in different energy bands as a function of Fourier frequency, probes the structure of the inner accretion disks and X-ray coronae of active galactic nuclei. We present a systematic X-ray spectroscopic and reverberation study of the high-Eddington-ratio narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy Ark 564, using over 900 ks of \textit{XMM-Newton} and \textit{NuSTAR} observations spanning 13 years. The time-averaged spectra can be well described by the a model consisting of a coronal continuum, relativistic disk reflection, warm Comptonization, and three warm absorbers. Leveraging the high X-ray brightness of Ark 564, we are able to resolve the time evolution of the spectra and contemporaneous reverberation lags. The soft-band lag relative to the continuum increases with the X-ray flux, while Fe K$\alpha$ lags are detected in only a subset of epochs and do not correlate with soft lags. Models based on a lamppost corona and reflection from a standard thin disk can broadly reproduce the observed lag-energy spectra of low-flux epochs; however, additional reverberation from the warm Comptonized atmosphere is required to explain the soft lags observed in high-flux epochs. A vertically puffed-up inner disk and a variable, vertically extended corona can better explain the observed evolution of the lags and covariance spectra. Our study underscores the importance of multi-epoch, multi-band analyses for a comprehensive understanding the inner accretion disk and corona.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational waves emitted from core-collapse supernova explosions are critical observables for extracting information about the dynamics and properties of both the progenitor and the post-bounce~evolution of the system. They are prime targets for current interferometric searches and represent a key milestone for the capabilities of next-generation interferometers. This study aims to characterize how the gravitational waveform associated with prompt stellar convection depends on the rotational rate and magnetic field topology of the progenitor star. We carry out a series of axisymmetric simulations of a $16.5\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ red supergiant with five configurations of initial magnetic fields and varying degrees of initial rotation. We then analyze the contribution of early-time convection and the proto-neutron star core to the waveform using ensemble empirical mode decomposition, alongside spectral and Fourier analyses, to facilitate comparison and interpretation of the results. Our simulations reveal that early post-bounce gravitational waves signals are dominated by the first six intrinsic mode functions, with variations due to rotation and magnetic fields influencing the signal strength. Strong magnetic fields decelerate core rotation, affecting mode excitation. Regardless of the initial rotation, convection consistently drives a low-frequency mode that lasts throughout the evolution. Additionally, our results show that the bounce signal is not consistently the strongest component of the waveform. Instead, we find that prompt convection generates a post-bounce signal of comparable or even greater amplitude.
#### Premature Ignition: Why the Single-Degenerate Channel Leads to Type Iax and Not Type Ia Supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are pivotal for the origins of the elements, the understanding of galactic chemical evolution, and serve as crucial cosmological distance indicators, yet their progenitor systems remain a central enigma in astrophysics. While both the growth of white dwarfs to near-Chandrasekhar mass and their explosion (the single-degenerate; SD) and mergers of two WDs leading to explosions (double-degenerate; DD) scenarios have been proposed, neither explains the observed diversity of thermonuclear transients and their properties, including the fainter Type Iax supernovae (SNe Iax). Here we show, through comprehensive three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations, that as accreting WDs grow towards the Chandrasekhar mass (the SD channel), premature carbon ignition at sub-Chandrasekhar densities can trigger partial deflagrations that eject substantial mass in low-energy Iax outbursts. Such a process effectively serves as a self-limiting feedback loop, which stalls further mass growth. It naturally explains why the SD channel is precluded from producing standard, normal SNe Ia, and instead predominantly yields SNe Iax. Our findings significantly reframe the SD versus DD debate, with important implications for supernova rates, galactic chemical enrichment, and cosmological measurements.

 - **Abstract**
 Coronal plumes are narrow, collimated structures that are primarily viewed above the solar poles and in coronal holes in the extreme ultraviolet, but also in sunspots. Open questions remain about plume formation, including the role of small-scale transients and whether plumes embedded in different magnetic field configurations have similar formation mechanisms. We report on coordinated Solar Orbiter/Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI), Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph, and Solar Dynamics Observatory observations of the formation of a plume in sunspot penumbra in 2022 March. During this observation, Solar Orbiter was positioned near the Earth-Sun line and EUI observed at a 5 s cadence with a spatial scale of 185 km pixel$^{-1}$ in the solar corona. We observe fine-scale dots at various locations in the sunspot, but the brightest and highest density of dots is at the plume base. Space-time maps along the plume axis show parabolic and V-shaped patterns, and we conclude that some of these dots are possible signatures of magneto-acoustic shocks. Compared to other radial cuts around the sunspot, along the plume shows the longest periods (~7 minutes) and the most distinct tracks. Bright dots at the plume base are mostly circular and do not show elongations from a fixed origin, in contrast to jetlets and previously reported penumbral dots. We do not find high-speed, repeated downflows along the plume, and the plume appears to brighten coherently along its length. Our analysis suggests that jetlets and downflows are not a necessary component of this plume's formation, and that mechanisms for plume formation could be dependent on magnetic topology and the chromospheric wave field.

 - **Abstract**
 Tracking the cold molecular gas contents of galaxies is critical to understand the interplay between star formation and galaxy growth across cosmic time. Observations of the long-wavelength dust continuum, a proxy for the cold gas, are widely used in the high-redshift community because of their ease and efficiency. These measurements rely on the assumption of a molecular gas-to-dust mass ratio, typically taken to be GDR ~ 100 in massive, metal-rich systems. We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of the 870um dust continuum in a sample of five massive quiescent galaxies at z ~ 1 with existing detections of CO(2-1). We find surprisingly weak dust emission, falling a factor of >~0.4-0.8 dex below the typical correlation between CO and continuum luminosity. We interpret this dust deficiency as evidence for unusually high GDR in these galaxies, which we calculate to range from 300 to at least 1200. Our results and other observations from the literature are generally compatible with predictions from the SIMBA cosmological simulation that dust is preferentially destroyed in quiescent galaxies. Ultimately, we conclude that the dust continuum is a highly unreliable tracer of the molecular gas in high-redshift quiescent galaxies. As a consequence we may know much less about the cold gas contents of this population than previously thought.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Based on Local Universe observations, quiescent galaxies (QGs) host lower to no HI compared to star-forming galaxies (SFGs), but no constraints have been derived so far at higher redshift (z>0.1). Understanding whether QGs can retain significant HI reservoirs at higher z is crucial to refine quenching and gas accretion models and to constrain overall star formation efficiency at different epochs. Aims. We aim to probe HI in candidate QGs at intermediate redshifts (z=0.36) and to understand whether there exists a class of QGs retaining consistent HI reservoirs and which parameters (dust content, stellar mass, Dn4000, morphology, environment) effectively capture HI-rich QGs. Methods. We perform 21-cm spectral line stacking on MIGHTEE-HI data at z=0.36, targeting two different samples of QGs, defined by means of a color-selection criterion and a spectroscopic criterion based on Dn4000, respectively. We also perform stacking on subsamples of the spectroscopically-selected quiescent sample to investigate the correlation between the HI content and other galaxy properties. Results. We find that QGs with an IR counterpart (i.e., dusty galaxies) are found to host a substantial HI content, on average just 40% lower than SFGs. In contrast, color-selected QGs still hold HI, but lower than SFGs by a factor 3. Among dusty objects, we find morphology to have a mild impact on the atomic gas content, with spirals hosting approximately 15-30% more HI than spheroids. Environmental effects are also present, with low-density regions hosting galaxies that are HI-richer than in high-density ones, by approximately 30% for spirals and 60% for spheroids. We suggest that, in general, HI content is driven by several factors, including quenching mechanisms and ISM enrichment processes. Also, quiescent galaxies - and especially dusty systems - seem to yield HI more consistently than in the Local Universe.
#### ALMA survey of a massive node of the Cosmic Web at $z\sim 3$. II. A dynamically cold and massive disk galaxy in the proximity of a hyperluminous quasar

 - **Abstract**
 Advancing our understanding of the formation and evolution of early massive galaxies and black holes requires detailed studies of dense structures in the high-redshift Universe. In this work, we present high-angular resolution ($\simeq0.3''$) ALMA observations targeting the CO(4--3) line and the underlying 3-mm dust continuum toward the Cosmic Web node MQN01, a region identified through deep multiwavelength surveys as one of the densest concentrations of galaxies and AGN at cosmic noon. At the center of this structure, we identify a massive, rotationally supported disk galaxy located approximately at $\sim10\,{\rm kpc}$ projected-distance and $\sim-300\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$ from a hyperluminous quasar at $z=3.2510$. By accurately modeling the cold gas kinematics, we determine a galaxy dynamical mass of $2.5\times10^{11}\,{M_{\odot}}$ within the inner $\simeq 4\,{\rm kpc}$, and a high degree of rotational support of $V_{\rm rot}/\sigma \approx 11$. This makes it the first quasar companion galaxy confirmed as a massive, dynamically cold rotating disk at such an early cosmic epoch. Despite the small projected separation from the quasar host, we find no clear evidence of strong tidal interactions affecting the galaxy disk. This might suggest that the quasar is a satellite galaxy in the early stages of a merger. Furthermore, our spectroscopic analysis reveals a broad, blueshifted component in the CO(4--3) line profile of the quasar host, which may trace a powerful molecular outflow or kinematic disturbances induced by its interaction with the massive companion galaxy. Our findings show that rotationally supported cold disks are able to survive even in high-density environments of the early Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Astrochemical modeling requires, as input, the effective column density of gas (or extinction) that attenuates an external, isotropic, far-ultraviolet radiation field. In three-dimensional simulations, this can be calculated through ray-tracing schemes, while in 0D chemical models it is often treated as a free parameter. Aims. We aim to produce an analytic, physically motivated formalism to predict the average relationship between the effective hydrogen-nuclei column density, $N_{\rm eff}({\rm H})$, and the local hydrogen-nuclei number density, $n_{\rm H}$. Methods. We construct an analytic model utilizing characteristic length scales that connects the turbulence-dominated regime and the gravitational-dominated regime at high-density. Results. The model well-reproduces a previous analytic fit to simulation results and is consistent with the high-density power-law indices, e.g., $N_{\rm eff}(H) \propto n^{\gamma}$, of $\gamma \approx 0.4 - 0.5$ found in previous numerical simulations utilizing ray-tracing. Conclusions. We present an analytic model relating the average effective column density, $N_{\rm eff}$, to the local number density, $n_{\rm H}$, which reproduces the behaviors found in three-dimensional simulations. The analytic model can be utilized as a sub-grid prescription for shielded molecular gas or in astrochemical models for a physically motivated estimation of the attenuating column density.

 - **Abstract**
 Measuring properties of young stellar objects (YSOs) is necessary for probing the pre-main-sequence evolution of stars. As YSOs exhibit complex geometry, measurement generally entails comparing observed radiation to template populations of radiative-transfer model YSO spectral energy distributions (SEDs). Due to uncertainty on the precise mechanics of star formation, the properties inferred for YSOs using these models often depend strongly on the assumed accretion history. We develop a framework for predicting observable properties of YSOs that is agnostic to the underlying accretion history, enabling comparison between theories. This framework links a set of radiative-transfer SEDs with protostellar evolutionary tracks to create models of evolving YSOs. Unlike previous works, we directly relate evolution models to observables through theoretical physical parameters rather than through intermediate, observationally derived analogues. We make flux predictions for YSOs corresponding to stars with birth masses from 0.2 to 50 $M_\odot$ during their accretion phase following isothermal-sphere, turbulent-core, and competitive accretion histories, showing that these histories may be observationally distinguished by examining the 100-$\mu$m and 3-mm fluxes of a YSO. We discuss the impact of dust models and parameter ranges on the output of radiative transfer simulations through a comparison to another SED model grid. We quantify the degree of confusion between YSO Stages and Classes across a wide range of physical scenarios; for each, we calculate confusion matrices that enable inference of the number of objects of a given Stage from an observed population. Finally, we critically examine the physical significance of various literature Stage and Class definitions.
#### Impact of 3D macro physics and nuclear physics on the p nuclei in O-C shell mergers

 - **Abstract**
 O-C shell mergers in massive stars are a site for producing the p nuclei by the $\gamma$ process, but 1D stellar models rely on mixing length theory, which does not match the radial velocity profiles of 3D hydrodynamic simulations. We investigate how 3D macro physics informed mixing impacts the nucleosynthesis of p nuclei. We post-process the O-shell of the $M_\mathrm{ZAMS} = 15~\mathrm{M}_\odot$, $Z = 0.02$ model from the NuGrid stellar data set. Applying a downturn to velocities at the boundary and increasing velocities across the shell as obtained in previous results, we find non-linear, non-monotonic increase in p-nuclei production with a spread of 0.96 dex, and find that isotopic ratios can change. Reducing C-shell ingestion rates as found in 3D simulations suppresses production, with spreads of 1.22-1.84 dex across MLT and downturn scenarios. Applying dips to the diffusion profile to mimic quenching events also suppresses production, with a 0.51 dex spread. We analyze the impact of varying all photo-disintegration rates of unstable n-deficient isotopes from Se-Po by a factor of 10 up and down. The nuclear physics variations for the MLT and downturn cases have a spread of 0.56-0.78 dex. We also provide which reaction rates are correlated with the p nuclei, and find few correlations shared between mixing scenarios. Our results demonstrate that uncertainties in mixing arising from uncertain 3D macro physics are as significant as nuclear physics and are crucial for understanding p-nuclei production during O-C shell mergers quantitatively.

 - **Abstract**
 The evolution of the magnetism, winds and rotation of low-mass stars are all linked. One of the most common ways to probe the magnetic properties of low-mass stars is with the Zeeman-Doppler imaging (ZDI) technique. The magnetic properties of partially convective stars has been relatively well explored with the ZDI technique, but the same is not true of fully convective stars. In this work, we analyse a sample of stars that have been mapped with ZDI. Notably, this sample contains a number of slowly rotating fully convective M dwarfs whose magnetic fields were recently reconstructed with ZDI. We find that the dipolar, quadrupolar and octupolar field strengths of the slowly rotating fully convective stars do not follow the same Rossby number scaling in the unsaturated regime as partially convective stars. Based on these field strengths, we demonstrate that previous estimates of spin-down torques for slowly rotating fully convective stars could have been underestimated by an order of magnitude or more. Additionally, we also find that fully convective and partially convective stars fall into distinct sequences when comparing their poloidal and toroidal magnetic energies.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) events are critical for understanding particle acceleration and transport in the heliosphere. While most SEP events involve outward streaming particles along open magnetic field lines, bidirectional events characterized by simultaneous sunward and anti-sunward particle flows offer unique insights into magnetic field topology and the interplay of multiple acceleration sources. We aim to investigate the origin and transport of energetic particles in two rare bidirectional anisotropic SEP events observed by Solar Orbiter. Both events showed two clear velocity dispersion signatures with opposite particle anisotropies during their onset phase. The sunward streaming protons, characterized by delayed release time, harder spectral index, and higher intensities, may be attributed to coronal mass ejection-driven shock acceleration, while the promptly released anti-sunward streaming protons are likely linked to flare acceleration. Notably, in both cases, small-scale flux ropes were identified in situ during the time intervals corresponding to the bidirectional particle streaming. Path lengths derived for sunward and anti-sunward injections were substantially greater than nominal values of the Parker field lines, further supporting the role of the flux rope in shaping particle trajectories. These observations demonstrate that magnetic flux rope could significantly affect magnetic connectivity to the source region and SEP propagation in the inner heliosphere, while simultaneous velocity dispersion from two distinct particle sources allows for direct constraints on the topology of the flux rope. Our results highlight the value of combining particle anisotropy, release time, source spectra, and magnetic structure diagnostics to unravel SEP transport in complex transient magnetic structures, and also present new challenges for the current SEP transport model.
#### Comprehensive analysis of CM Draconis: eclipse timing variations driven by either a third body or stellar magnetic activity

 - **Abstract**
 The CM Draconis system is a well-studied, double-lined spectroscopic binary that is totally eclipsing and exhibits strong magnetic activity. Nearly one million photometric measurements have been collected across multiple wavelengths over more than half a century. In addition to showing frequent flare activity and apsidal motion, CM Dra also hosts a distant white dwarf and has been proposed to harbor a Jupiter-sized circumbinary companion. At only 47 light-years from Earth, it remains one of the most observationally rich and dynamically intriguing low-mass binary systems. We present a comprehensive photometric and spectroscopic analysis of the system using new ground-based observations and data from 19 sectors of the \textit{TESS} mission. We derive precise fundamental parameters for both components: $M_1 = 0.2307 \pm 0.0008\,M_\odot$, $M_2 = 0.2136 \pm 0.0008\,M_\odot$, $R_1 = 0.2638 \pm 0.0011\,R_\odot$, $R_2 = 0.2458 \pm 0.0010\,R_\odot$, $L_1 = 0.0060 \pm 0.0005\,L_\odot$, and $L_2 = 0.0050 \pm 0.0004\,L_\odot$. The derived distance ($14.4 \pm 0.6$ pc) is consistent with \textit{Gaia} DR3 measurements. Eclipse timing variations (ETVs) spanning over five decades were analyzed in detail. A long-period ($\sim$56 yr) modulation was identified, which may be attributed either to the light-time effect of a possible circumbinary companion or to magnetic activity cycles. While the Bayesian Information Criterion statistically favors the model involving a light-time effect from a planetary companion, stellar activity remains a viable alternative that cannot yet be ruled out. Our results demonstrate that CM Dra is a valuable test case for studying both stellar activity and the potential presence of circumbinary companions in multiple-star systems. Continued long-term monitoring will be essential to distinguish between these competing scenarios.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first robust helium (He) abundance measurements in star-forming galaxies at redshifts $1.6\lesssim z\lesssim 3.3$ using deep, moderate-resolution JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy from the AURORA survey. We establish a High$-z$ HeI Sample consisting of 20 galaxies with multiple high-S/N ($>5\sigma$) HeI emission-line detections, including the critical near-infrared $\lambda$10833 line. This is the first study at high redshift leveraging $\lambda$10833 to break degeneracies between temperature, electron density, optical depth, and He$^+$/H$^+$, enabling reliable He abundance determinations in the early universe. We use a custom MCMC framework incorporating direct-method electron temperature priors, extended optical depth ($\tau_{\lambda3890}$) model grids up to densities of $10^6$~cm$^{-3}$, and simultaneous fits of the physical conditions and HeI/HI line ratios to derive ionic He$^+$/H$^+$ abundances. Most of the AURORA galaxies follow the extrapolated $z\sim0$ He/H-O/H trend, indicating modest He enrichment by $z\sim2-3$. However, we identify a subpopulation of four galaxies that exhibit elevated He mass fractions ($\Delta Y>0.03$) without corresponding enhancements in N/O or $\alpha$-elements ($\sim20$% of the sample). This abundance pattern is inconsistent with enrichment from asymptotic giant branch stars, but favors early He enrichment from very massive stars (VMSs; $M\gtrsim100\ M_\odot$), which can eject He-rich, N-poor material via stellar winds and binary stripping in young stellar populations. We speculate that these elevated-He systems may represent an early phase of globular cluster (GC) formation where N enrichment is still lagging behind He production. This work demonstrates the power of JWST multi-line HeI spectroscopy for tracing early stellar feedback, enrichment pathways, and GC progenitor signatures in the high-z universe.

 - **Abstract**
 The photometric solutions of NW Aps reveal that it is a low mass ratio ($q = 0.086$) contact binary system. Investigation of orbital period shows that its orbital period is increasing continuously at a rate of $dP/dt=+1.117(\pm0.005)\times{10^{-6}}day\cdot year^{-1}$, which may be caused by mass transfer from the less massive component to the more massive one at a rate of $\frac{dM_{2}}{dt}=-3.36(\pm0.02)\times{10^{-8}}M_\odot/year$. A cyclic variation of $P_3 = 22.9(\pm0.1)$ is also found in the O - C curve. There may be a potential compact object orbiting around NW Aps, with its minimum mass to be $M_3 = 0.436(\pm0.007)M_\odot$. However, the magnetic activity of the primary star may also account for the cyclic change. NW Aps is a stellar merger candidate with the longest orbital period among all stellar merge candidates with mass ratio $q < 0.1$. It is still in a stable state since the ratio of orbital angular momentum ($J_{orb}$) to spin angular momentum ($J_{spin}$) is $\frac{J_{orb}}{J_{spin}}$ = 3.257. Both of its primary and secondary star are oversized to main sequence stars, and the surface gravity of the primary and secondary stars are significant lower than main sequence stars. The P - log g relationship is fitted with parabola for low mass ratio contact binary systems. More targets laid in the gap are needed to confirm the P - log g relationship and reveal the final evolutionary state of low mass ratio contact binary system.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutrons are the only neutral hadrons that remain stable over the timescale of an air-shower development. Their energy is lost only through hadronic interactions and quasi-elastic scattering, which results in their high abundance at the ground. The signals from the electromagnetic and muonic components in scintillation detectors typically span only a few microseconds. In contrast, the neutrons can cause delayed pulses in scintillation detectors up to and beyond several milliseconds after the passage of the shower front. Selection of an appropriate time window allows us to isolate and characterize the neutron component of air showers, which may provide a new, direct method to probe hadronic interactions during the shower development. We report the measurement of a neutron component at ultra-high energies using the Surface-Scintillator Detectors (SSD) from the AugerPrime upgrade of the Pierre Auger Observatory. We provide a first look at the pulse-amplitude spectrum together with our measured rate and lateral distribution of the neutron component.
#### Discovery of 146.8 s pulsations from EP J005146.9-730930, a new transient Be/X-ray binary in the SMC

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) with Einstein Probe (EP) revealed a new transient X-ray source, most likely identified as Be/X-ray binary. To characterise the X-ray properties of EP J005146.9-730930 and in particular to look for pulsations in the X-ray flux, we triggered an XMM-Newton anticipated target of opportunity observation. To follow the flux evolution during the outburst we monitored the source for about three months with the Follow-up X-ray Telescope of EP. The XMM-Newton observation was performed on 2024 September 15 and we used the data from the European Photon Imaging Camera (EPIC) for detailed spectral and timing analyses. The EPIC X-ray spectrum is well described by an absorbed power law with photon index of 1.25 +/- 0.04 and the timing analysis revealed pulsations with 146.79 +\- 0.03 s. The source flux had decreased by a factor of about 10 since the observed maximum about one month before the XMM-Newton observation. EP J005146.9-730930 was never detected significantly during serendipitous observations before September 2024. The characteristics of the X-ray brightening suggest the source was discovered during a type II outburst reaching an X-ray peak luminosity of ~2 x 10^37 erg/s. The trend of spectral hardening towards higher luminosities observed by EP suggests that the source is accreting below the critical luminosity, yielding an estimated lower limit for the pulsar magnetic field strength of 3.3 x 10^12 G. The improved X-ray position confirms the candidate Be star OGLE J005147.58-730924.7 as optical counterpart. We conclude that EP J005146.9-730930 = SXP 146.8 is a new Be/X-ray binary pulsar in the SMC.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: The post-quenching evolution process of early-type galaxies (ETGs) is still not fully understood. The amount of growth in stellar mass and size incurred after quenching is still under debate. Aims: In this work we aim to investigate the late evolution of ETGs, both observationally and theoretically, by focusing on the stellar mass density profile inside a fixed aperture, within $10$~kpc from the galaxy center. Methods: We first studied the stellar mass and mass-weighted density slope within $10 ~\rm{kpc}$, respectively $M_{*,10}$ and $\mathit{\Gamma_{*,10}}$, of a sample of early-type galaxies from the GAMA survey. We measured the \gmr~and its evolution over the redshift range $0.17\leq z \leq 0.37$. We then built a toy model for the merger evolution of galaxies, based on N-body simulations, to explore to what extent the observed growth in \gmr~is consistent with a dry-merger evolution scenario. Results: From the observations, we do not detect evidence for an evolution of the \gmr relation. We put an upper limit on $~(\mu)$ and $~(\beta)$ of the \gmr: $|\partial \mu/\partial \log (1+z)| \leq 0.13$ and $\left|\partial \beta/\partial \log (1+z)\right| \leq 1.10$, respectively. Simulations show that most mergers induce a decrease in $\mathit{\Gamma_{*,10}}$ and an increase in $M_{*,10}$, although some show a decrease in $M_{*,10}$, particularly for the most extended galaxies and smaller merger mass ratios. By combining the observations with our merger toy model, we placed an upper limit on $f_M = 11.2 \%$ in the redshift range $0.17 \leq z \leq 0.37$. Conclusions: While our measurement is limited by systematics, the application of our approach to samples with a larger redshift baseline, particularly with a time interval $\Delta t \geq 3.2~\mathrm{Gyr}$, should enable us to detect a signal and help us better understand the late growth of ETGs.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we propose a model of warm inflation driven by axion-like particles interacting with $U(1)$ gauge fields, with implications for the early universe's thermal evolution. By extending traditional warm inflation models, we introduce a dissipation mechanism through the thermal fluctuations of electromagnetic fields, leading to a non-trivial backreaction on the inflaton's dynamics. Our results are consistent with CMB observations, even for a natural sub-Plankian axion decay constant $f<M_{\rm Pl}$. We present precise constraints on the model's free parameters, using CAMB and CosmoMC codes. These findings offer new insights into the thermal history of the universe and the nature of inflationary dynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 The thermodynamics of interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) is often described using a polytropic process. Estimating the polytopic index ($\gamma$) allows us to quantify the expansion or compression of the ICME plasma arising from changes in the plasma temperature. In this study, we estimate $\gamma$ for protons inside the magnetic clouds (MCs), their associated sheaths, and ambient solar wind for a large sample of well-observed events observed by the Wind spacecraft at 1 AU. We find that $\gamma$ shows a high ($\approx 1.6$) - low ($\approx 1.05$) - high ($\approx 1.2$) behavior inside the ambient solar wind, sheath, and MCs, respectively. We also find that the proton polytropic index is independent of small-scale density fluctuations. Furthermore, our results show that the stored energy inside MC plasma is not expended in expanding its cross-section at 1 AU. The sub-adiabatic nature of MC plasma implies external heating - possibly due to thermal conduction from the corona. We find that the heating gradient per unit mass from the corona to the protons of MC at 1 AU is $\approx 0.21$ erg cm$^{-1}$ g$^{-1}$ which is in agreement with the required proton heating budget.

 The Aditya-L1 mission, India's first dedicated solar observatory positioned at the first Lagrange point (L1) of the Sun-Earth system, carries the Solar Wind Ion Spectrometer (SWIS) as part of the ASPEX payload suite. Even before settling into its Halo orbit, SWIS has been providing nearly continuous in-situ measurements of solar wind ion spectra. Moments of the velocity distribution functions (VDFs) have been calculated to derive key solar wind parameters such as density, bulk speed, and temperature. In this study, we assess the performance of SWIS (hereafter referred to as AL1-ASPEX-SWIS) by comparing its measurements with contemporaneous data from the Wind and DSCOVR missions. In this study, we assess the performance of SWIS (hereafter referred to as AL1-ASPEX-SWIS) by comparing its measurements with contemporaneous data from the Wind and DSCOVR missions. A detailed case study of the interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) event on August 7, 2024, is presented, where sharp changes in bulk speed, thermal speed, and number density were found to be well-aligned with independent observations-confirming the instrument's ability to capture dynamic solar wind features. Spectral analysis of kinetic fluctuations revealed a well-defined inertial range with a spectral slope consistent with magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence. Furthermore, a 17-month statistical comparison (from January 2024 to May 2025) shows a strong correlation in bulk velocity (R2 = 0.94 with Wind), with expected variations in thermal speed and density arising from differences between instruments. These findings demonstrate the scientific value of AL1-ASPEX-SWIS for monitoring both transient solar events and long-term solar wind conditions.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding galaxy classification depends on our interpretation of their spectra. To date, the hydrogen Balmer lines remain the most consistent way to classify galaxies, but at 'intermediate' redshifts ($1.5 < z < 2.5$), galaxies are hard to parse in the BPT diagram (and its siblings) because the crucial H$\alpha$ emission line is out of range of ground-based optical spectographs. In this work, we re-explore a known diagram, which we call the OB-I diagram, that compares the equivalent width of H$\beta$ with the emission line ratio of [OIII]$\lambda$5007/H$\beta$, and breathe new life into it, as it has the potential to 'illuminate the fog' that permeates galaxy classification in the restframe optical spectra. Using data from SDSS, LEGA-C, VANDELS, JADES, 3D-HST and MOSDEF, we explore galaxy classification in the OB-I diagram at a wide range of redshifts ($0 < z < 2.7$). We find that, at $z < 0.4$, the OB-I diagram clearly separates galaxies between two distinct types, which we divide with an empirical fit: one dominated by AGN and a second made up of a mixed population of SF galaxies and AGN activity. This mixed population can be partially separated from a pure SF population, with a simple semi-empirical fit derived from a comparison with theoretical models and the BPT diagrams. At higher redshifts, we find that the majority of AGNs identified by other classification schemes are correctly recovered by the OB-I diagram, potentially making this diagram resistant to the 'cosmic shift' that plagues most optical classification schemes. Overall, the OB-I diagram, which only requires two emission lines to be implemented, is a useful tool at separating galaxies that possess a dominating AGN component in their emission from others, from the Local Universe ($z < 0.1$) to the Cosmic Noon ($z \sim 2$), without any need for significant adjustments in our empirical fit.
#### VERTICO IX: Signatures of environmental processing of the gas in Virgo cluster spiral galaxies through mapping of CO isotopologues

 - **Abstract**
 In this work we study CO isotopologue emission in the largest cluster galaxy sample to date: 48 VERTICO spiral galaxies in Virgo. We show for the first time in a significant sample that the physical conditions within the molecular gas appear to change as a galaxy's ISM is affected by environmental processes. 13CO is detected across the sample, both directly and via stacking, while C18O is detected in a smaller number of systems. We use these data to study trends with global and radial galaxy properties. We show that the CO/13CO line ratio changes systematically with a variety of galaxy properties, including mean gas surface density, HI-deficiency and galaxy morphology. 13CO/C18O line ratios vary significantly, both radially and between galaxies, suggesting real variations in abundances are present. Such abundance changes may be due to star formation history differences, or speculatively even stellar initial mass function variations. We present a model where the optical depth of the molecular gas appears to change as a galaxy's ISM is affected by environmental processes. The molecular gas appears to become more transparent as the molecular medium is stripped, and then more opaque as the tightly bound remnant gas settles deep in the galaxy core. This explains the variations we see, and also helps explain similar observations in cluster early-type galaxies. Next generation simulations and dedicated observations of additional isotopologues could thus provide a powerful tool to help us understand the impact of environment on the ISM, and thus the quenching of galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 Grain-surface chemistry plays a crucial role in the formation of molecules of astrobiological interest, including H$_{2}$S and complex organic molecules (COMs). They are commonly observed in the gas phase toward star-forming regions, but their detection in ices remains limited. Combining gas-phase observations with chemical modeling is therefore essential for advancing our understanding of their chemistry. In this paper we investigate the factors that promote or hinder molecular complexity combining gas-phase observations of CH$_{3}$OH, H$_{2}$S, OCS, N$_{2}$H$^{+}$, and C$^{18}$O with chemical modeling in two dense cores: Barnard-1b and IC348. We observed millimeter emission lines of CH$_{3}$OH, H$_{2}$S, OCS, N$_{2}$H$^{+}$, and C$^{18}$O along strips using the IRAM 30m and Yebes 40m telescopes. We used the gas-grain chemical model \texttt{Nautilus} to reproduce the observed abundance profiles adjusting parameters such as initial sulfur abundances and binding energies. H$_{2}$S, N$_{2}$H$^{+}$ and C$^{18}$O gas-phase abundances vary up to one order of magnitude towards the extinction peak. CH$_{3}$OH abundance remains quite uniform. These abundances can only be reproduced assuming a decreasing sulfur budget, which lowers H$_{2}$S and enhances CH$_{3}$OH abundances. Decreasing binding energies, which are expected in CO-rich apolar ices, are also required. The sulfur depletion required by H$_2$S is generally higher than that required by CH$_3$OH, suggesting unknown sulfur sinks. These findings highlight the intricate relationship between sulfur chemistry and COM formation, driven by the competition between sulfur and CO for hydrogen atoms. Our study emphasizes that the growth of CO ice and the progressive sequestration of hydrogen atoms by sulfur are critical in determining whether chemical complexity can develop, providing key insights into the early stages of star and planet formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Using our rich observations within the Milky Way to better understand galaxy evolution requires understanding what the Milky Way looks like "as a galaxy" -- that is, its "true" shape and abundance profiles (unskewed by observational biases), signatures of past mergers and significant accretion events, and even its total stellar mass and integrated SED, which have historically been difficult to constrain. We present a new approach to determining the Milky Way's integrated mass and colors, using recent measurements of the intrinsic density profiles of stellar populations spanning nearly 13 Gyr in time and 1.5 dex in metallicity (representing nearly all of the Galaxy's stars). We trace the evolution of the Milky Way in various diagnostic spaces, explore the impact of specific events on the present-day Milky Way's integrated properties, and use TNG50 simulations to identify "young" Galactic analogs and their eventual fates, compared to the real Milky Way's path. From the simulation comparisons, we find strong evidence for an earlier-than-average stellar mass assembly of the MW, and that present-day MW analogs follow a similar growth history, albeit at slightly later times; we also find that analogs of the early MW are in no way guaranteed to follow the MW's subsequent path. This empirical study offers new constraints on our "Galaxy as a galaxy" -- today and across cosmic time -- and on its place in the general galactic population.

 - **Abstract**
 Little Red Dots (LRDs) are compact, red sources discovered by JWST at high redshift ($z \gtrsim 4$), marked by distinctive "V-shaped" spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and often interpreted as rapidly accreting AGNs. Their evolution remains unclear, as identifying counterparts at lower redshifts is challenging. We present WISEA J123635.56+621424.2 (here dubbed {\it the Saguaro}), a $z=2.0145$ galaxy in GOODS-North, as a possible analog of high-redshift LRDs and a potential missing link in their evolutionary path toward lower-redshift systems. It features a compact LRD-like nucleus surrounded by a face-on spiral host. Its connection to LRDs includes that: (1) its nuclear spectrum shows a clear "V-shaped" SED; and (2) when redshifted to $z=7$, surface brightness dimming makes the host undetectable, thus mimicking an LRD. This suggests that high-redshift LRDs may be embedded in extended hosts. To test this, we stack rest-frame UV images of 99 photometrically selected LRDs, revealing faint, diffuse emission. Stacking in redshift bins reveals mild radial growth, consistent with the expected galaxy size evolution. A simple analytic model confirms that surface brightness dimming alone can explain their compact appearance. Lastly, we show that {\it the Saguaro} is not unique by describing similar objects from the literature at $z\lesssim3.5$. Taken together, our results support a scenario in which LRDs may not be a distinct population, but could be the visible nuclei of galaxies undergoing a short-lived, AGN-dominated evolutionary phase, with their compact, red appearance driven largely by observational biases.
#### A first measurement of baryonic feedback with Fast Radio Bursts

 - **Abstract**
 Baryonic feedback fundamentally alters the total matter distribution on small to intermediate cosmological scales, posing a significant challenge for contemporary cosmological analyses. Direct tracers of the baryon distribution are therefore key for unearthing cosmological information buried under astrophysical effects. Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) have emerged as a novel and direct probe of baryons, tracing the integrated ionised electron density along the line-of-sight, quantified by the dispersion measure (DM). The scatter of the DM as a function of redshift provides insight into the lumpiness of the electron distribution and, consequently, baryonic feedback processes. Using a model calibrated to the \texttt{BAHAMAS} hydrodynamical simulation suite, we forward-model the statistical properties of the DM with redshift. Applying this model to approximately 100 localised FRBs, we constrain the governing feedback parameter, $\log T_\mathrm{AGN}$. Our findings represent the first measurement of baryonic feedback using FRBs, demonstrating a strong rejection of no-feedback scenarios at greater than $99.7\,\%$ confidence ($3\sigma$), depending on the FRB sample. We find that FRBs prefer fairly strong feedback, similar to other measurements of the baryon distribution, via the thermal and kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect. The results are robust against sightline correlations and modelling assumptions. We emphasise the importance of accurate calibration of the host galaxy and Milky Way contributions to the DM. Furthermore, we discuss implications for future FRB surveys and necessary improvements to current models to ensure accurate fitting of upcoming data, particularly that from low-redshift FRBs.
