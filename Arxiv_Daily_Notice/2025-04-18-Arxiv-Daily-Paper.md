 - **Abstract**
 We perform simulations of magnetohydrodynamic accretion onto equal-mass, non-spinning binary black holes in 3+1 full general relativity addressing the effects of orbital eccentricity. We find that binary black holes with non-negligible eccentricity accrete matter with periodicity that matches the binary orbital period, whereas quasi-circular binaries exhibit accretion rate modulation at approximately $\sim 0.7\times$ their binary orbital period. Additionally, we find that the total jet luminosity is modulated at the orbital period for eccentric binaries, while quasi-circular binaries only exhibit long-term modulations. We perform a radiative transfer calculation of the dual jet synchrotron emission and demonstrate that the optically thin synchrotron emission varies on the binary orbital period for eccentric binaries. Moreover, eccentric binaries spend more time in a low state, where the synchrotron emission is minimum, than in a high state, where the synchrotron emission peaks. The quasi-circular binary also exhibits variability in its optically thin synchrotron emission but the exact frequency of variability does not appear robust against different parameters. Our suite of simulations is an essential step towards providing a comprehensive catalog of multi-messenger theoretical models that will enable studies of supermassive binary black holes detectable across the electromagnetic and gravitational wave spectra.

 - **Abstract**
 The IRAS Vela Shell (IVS) is a structure of enhanced FIR emission located towards the Gum Nebula, a prominent region of $\rm H\alpha$ emission in the local Milky Way shaped by various galactic stellar feedback over the past several million years. We constrain the 3D spatial geometry of the IVS using a parsec-resolution 3D dust map and contextualize it within the broader Gum Nebula. Our analysis reveals a dense, bowl-like IVS structure below the Galactic plane, with a more diffuse component above. We obtain a total shell mass of $5.1_{-2.4}^{+2.4}\times 10^{4}\;\rm M_{\odot}$ and, incorporating previous studies on shell expansion, a momentum of $6.0_{-3.4}^{+4.7}\times 10^{5}\;\rm M_{\odot}\;km\; s^{-1}$. We find a spatial correlation between the morphology of the dust-traced IVS and the Gum Nebula's $\rm H\alpha$ emission when projected onto the sky. We quantify contributions of feedback from stellar winds, an expanding HII region, and supernovae to the IVS formation, finding that stellar winds are subdominant. Our momentum analysis shows that both an HII region and supernova feedback could drive the shell's expansion. Using astrometric constraints from Gaia and Hipparcos, we trace back nearby feedback sources and find that the massive stars $\gamma2$ Velorum and $\zeta$ Puppis are currently within the IVS, producing enough ionizing luminosity to form an HII region of comparable size. Alternatively, if the IVS' momentum is primarily driven by supernovae, $1-2$ events would be required. We also identify several young massive clusters that could have hosted supernovae within the past 3 Myr.
#### WINTER on S250206dm: A near-infrared search for an electromagnetic counterpart

 - **Abstract**
 We present near-infrared follow-up observations of the International Gravitational Wave Network (IGWN) event S250206dm with the Wide-Field Infrared Transient Explorer (WINTER). WINTER is a near-infrared time-domain survey designed for electromagnetic follow-up of gravitational-wave sources localized to $\leq$300 deg$^{2}$. The instrument's wide field of view (1.2 deg$^2$), dedicated 1-m robotic telescope, and near-infrared coverage (0.9-1.7 microns) are optimized for searching for kilonovae, which are expected to exhibit a relatively long-lived near-infrared component. S250206dm is the only neutron star merger in the fourth observing run (to date) localized to $\leq$300 deg$^{2}$ with a False Alarm Rate below one per year. It has a $55\%$ probability of being a neutron star-black hole (NSBH) merger and a $37\%$ probability of being a binary neutron star (BNS) merger, with a $50\%$ credible region spanning 38 deg$^2$, an estimated distance of 373 Mpc, and an overall false alarm rate of approximately one in 25 years. WINTER covered $43\%$ of the probability area at least once and $35\%$ at least three times. Through automated and human candidate vetting, all transient candidates found in WINTER coverage were rejected as kilonova candidates. Unsurprisingly, given the large estimated distance of 373 Mpc, the WINTER upper limits do not constrain kilonova models. This study highlights the promise of systematic infrared searches and the need for future wider and deeper infrared surveys.
#### Insights into environmental quenching at $z\sim1$: an enhancement of faint, low-mass passive galaxies in clusters

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the processes that transform star-forming galaxies into quiescent ones is key to unraveling the role of environment in galaxy evolution. We present measurements of the luminosity functions (LFs) and stellar mass functions (SMFs) of passive red-sequence galaxies in four galaxy clusters at $0.8 < z < 1.3$, selected using deep VLT observations complemented with data from the GCLASS and GOGREEN surveys. We find a significant enhancement in the abundance of faint/low-mass passive galaxies in both the LFs and SMFs of all four clusters compared to the field. This is further evidenced by a shallower low-mass slope in the composite passive cluster SMF, which yields a Schechter parameter $\alpha = -0.54^{+\,0.03}_{-0.03}$, compared to $\alpha = 0.12^{+\,0.01}_{-0.01}$ for the field. Our findings indicate that quenching processes that act in clusters are enhanced compared to the field, suggesting that environmental quenching mechanisms may already be active by $z\sim1$. To reproduce the observed passive cluster SMF, we estimate that $25\pm5\%$ of the star-forming field population that falls into the cluster must have been quenched. Our results largely support traditional quenching models but highlight the need for deeper studies of larger cluster samples to better understand the role of environmental quenching in the distant Universe.
#### Evolving Atmospheric Ion Escape from Kepler-1649 b and c: Power-Law Trends in Atmospheric Loss

 - **Abstract**
 Rocky planets orbiting M-dwarf stars are prime targets for characterizing terrestrial atmospheres, yet their long-term evolution under intense stellar winds and high-energy radiation remains poorly understood. The Kepler-1649 system, which hosts two terrestrial exoplanets orbiting an M5V star, presents a valuable opportunity to explore atmospheric evolution in the extreme environments characteristic of M-dwarf stellar systems. In this Letter we show that both planets could have retained atmospheres over gigayear timescales. Using a multi-species magnetohydrodynamic model, we simulate atmospheric ion escape driven by stellar winds and extreme ultraviolet radiation from 0.7 to 4.8 Gyrs. The results show that total ion escape rates follow a power-law decline ($\propto \tau^{-1.6}$ for Kepler-1649 b, $\propto \tau^{-1.5}$ for Kepler-1649 c$\,$), with O$^{+}$ dominating atmospheric loss (76.8%-98.7%). The escape rates at 4.8 Gyrs are two orders of magnitude lower than those during the early epochs ($1.9\times10^{27}$ s$^{-1}$ at 0.7 Gyr vs. $3.0\times10^{25}$ s$^{-1}$ at 4.8 Gyrs for planet b$\,$), while planet b consistently exhibits 1.1-1.9$\times$ higher O$^{+}$ escape rates than planet c due to its closer orbit (0.051 AU vs. 0.088 AU). Despite substantial early atmospheric erosion, both planets may still retain significant atmospheres, suggesting the potential for long-term habitability. These findings offer predictive insight into atmospheric retention in M-dwarf systems and inform future JWST observations aimed at refining habitability assessments.
#### JADES NIRSpec Spectroscopy of GN-z11: Evidence for Wolf-Rayet contribution to stellar populations at 430 Myr after Big Bang?

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.12584

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the unusual emission line luminosity ratios observed in the JADES NIRSpec spectroscopy of GN-z11, which reveal exceptionally strong emission lines and a significant detection of the rarely observed N III] $\lambda1748-1753$Å multiplet. These features suggest an elevated N/O abundance, challenging existing models of stellar populations and nebular emission. To assess whether Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars can account for the observed line ratios, we construct a suite of stellar and nebular models incorporating high-resolution stellar spectral libraries, enabling a more accurate treatment of WR evolution and its influence on the ionising radiation field. We find that the inclusion of WR stars is essential for reproducing the observed position of GN-z11 in the C III]/He II versus C III]/C iv diagnostic plane, resolving discrepancies from previous studies. The model-derived metallicity (0.07$\lesssim$Z/Z$_{\odot}\lesssim$0.15), ionisation parameter ($\log\,U$$\approx$-2) and stellar ages are consistent with the literature estimates. However, our models under-predict the N III/O III] ratio, suggesting that WR stars alone cannot fully explain the nitrogen enrichment. This suggests that additional mechanisms, such as rapid chemical enrichment in a young, metal-poor environment, may be necessary to explain the nitrogen excess. While our models successfully reproduce most observed line ratios, further refinements to the models are needed to fully characterise the stellar populations and the enrichment processes of high-redshift galaxies like GN-z11.

 - **Abstract**
 Metric radio bursts are often said to be valuable diagnostic tools for studying the near-sun kinematics and energetics of the Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections (ICMEs). Radio observations also serve as an indirect tool to estimate the coronal magnetic fields. However, how these estimated coronal magnetic fields are related to the magnetic field strength in the ICME at 1 AU has rarely been explored. We aim to establish a relation between the coronal magnetic fields obtained from the radio observations very close to the Sun and the magnetic field measured at 1 AU when the ICME arrives at the Earth. We performed statistical analysis of all metric type II radio bursts in solar cycles 23 and 24, which were found to be associated with ICMEs. We estimated the coronal magnetic field associated with the corresponding CME near the Sun (middle corona) using a split-band radio technique and compared those with the magnetic fields recorded at 1 AU with in-situ observations. We found that the estimated magnetic fields near the Sun using radio techniques are not well correlated with the magnetic fields measured at 1 AU using in-situ observations. This could be due to the complex evolution of the magnetic field as it propagates through the heliosphere. Our results suggest that while metric radio observations can serve as effective proxies for estimating magnetic fields near the Sun, they may not be as effective close to the Earth. At least, no linear relation could be established using metric radio emissions to estimate the magnetic fields at 1 AU with acceptable error margins.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic flux tubes in the presence of background rotational flows are abundant throughout the solar atmosphere and may act as conduits for MHD waves to transport energy throughout the solar atmosphere. Here we investigate the contribution from MHD waves to the Poynting flux in a 3D numerical simulation of a realistic solar atmosphere, modelling a structure resembling a solar vortex tube, using the PLUTO code in the presence of different plasma flow configurations. These simulations feature a closed magnetic loop system where a rotational flow is imposed at one foot-point in addition to photospheric perturbations acting as a wave driver mimicking those of p-modes. We find that a variety of MHD waves exist within the vortex tube, including sausage, kink and torsional Alfvén waves, owing to the photospheric wave driver and the nature of the rotational flow itself. We demonstrate how the visual interpretation of different MHD modes becomes non-trivial when a background rotational flow is present compared to a static flux tube. By conducting a simulation both with and without the rotational plasma flow, we demonstrate how the perturbed Poynting flux increases in the presence of the rotational flow as the waves transport increased magnetic energy. We attribute this increase to the dynamical pressure from the rotational flow increasing the plasma density at the tube boundary, which acts to trap the wave energy more effectively inside the vortex. Moreover, we demonstrate how the Poynting flux is always directed upwards in weakly twisted magnetic flux tubes.

 - **Abstract**
 Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs), the repeated outbursts observed in soft X-ray bands, have attracted broad interest, but their physical origin is under debate. One of the popular models, the star-disk collision model, suggests that QPEs can be produced through periodic collisions of an orbiting star with the accretion disk of a central black hole (BH). However, previous tests of the star-disk collision model mainly focus on the timing analysis. Other observed properties, such as peak luminosities $L_{\rm{p}}$, durations $t_{\rm{e}}$, and radiation temperatures $T_{\rm{p}}$ of the eruptions, are not systematically investigated. For a sample of six QPE sources and two QPE-like sources, we test the star-disk collision model by using these observables to derive the constraints on the stellar radius $R_*$. We find that, except for two sources (eRo-QPE3 and eRo-QPE4), the rest of the sample either has no allowed $R_*$ to simultaneously reproduce the observed $L_{\rm{p}}$ and $t_{\rm{e}}$, or the required $R_*$ is too large to avoid being disrupted by the central BH. For the two exceptions, a stellar radius of the order of $1\ R_{\rm{\odot}}$ is necessary to satisfy all the constraints. Another issue with the simplest version of this model is that it predicts $k T_{\rm{p}} \sim 10\ \rm{eV}$, one order of magnitude lower than the observed value.

 - **Abstract**
 We carry out a numerical calculation of magnetar-powered shock break-outs (SBOs) and supernova (SN) light-curves. In particular, we investigate the impact of gravitational wave (GW) emission by the magnetar central engine on its electromagnetic (EM) counterparts in the ULTRASAT band. Our results show that GW emission by the magnetar has only a minor effect on the SBO light-curve. However, we find that SN light-curves can carry a direct signature of GW emission, which becomes more evident at late times (> 20-30 days).~Our results demonstrate that future ULTRASAT observations will provide crucial insights into the magnetar formation process, and unique information for direct searches of long-transient signals with current and future generation GW detectors. In particular, we estimate a rate of multi-messenger (UV+GW) detections of newly formed magnetars $>$ 1 every two years with ULTRASAT and the Einstein Telescope.

 - **Abstract**
 Nanoflares, which are consequences of braids in tangled magnetic fields, are an important candidate to heat the solar corona to million degrees. However, their observational evidence is sparse and many of their observational characteristics are yet to be discovered. With the high-resolution observations taken by the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager onboard the Solar Orbiter, here we study a series of ejections of plasma blobs resulted from a braided magnetic loops in the upper transition region and reveal some critical characteristics of such processes. The cores of these ejections have a size of about 700\,km, a duration less than 1 minute and a speed of about 90\,\kms. An important characteristic is that these plasma blobs are apparently constrained by the post-reconnection magnetic loops, along which they show an extension of up to about 2\,000\,km. The propagation of unbraiding nodes along the main axis of the tangled loops has a speed of about 45\,\kms. The separation angles between the post-reconnection loops and the main axis of the tangled loops are about 30\degree. The observations from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly reveal that the braiding loops are upper transition region structures. Based on these observations, the typical magnetic free energy producing a blob is estimated to be about $3.4\times10^{23}$\,erg, well in the nano-flare regime, while the kinematic energy of a blob is about $2.3\times10^{23}$\,erg, suggesting that a majority of magnetic free energy in a magnetic braid is likely transferred into kinematic energy.
#### The RESOLVE and ECO G3 Initiative: Drivers of HI Content and X-ray Emission in Galaxy Groups

 - **Abstract**
 Adding to the RESOLVE and ECO Gas in Galaxy Groups (G3) initiative, we examine possible drivers of group-integrated HI-to-halo mass ratios ($M_{\rm HI,grp}/M_{\rm halo}$) and group X-ray emission, including group halo mass ($M_{\rm halo}$), virialization as probed by crossing time ($t_{\rm cross}$), presence of active galactic nuclei (AGN), and group-integrated fractional stellar mass growth rate (FSMGR$_{\rm grp}$). G3 groups span $M_{\rm halo}=10^{11-14.5}\,M_\odot$ with comprehensive HI and AGN information, which we combine with X-ray stacking of ROSAT All-Sky data. We detect hot gas emission exceeding AGN and X-ray binary backgrounds confidently for $M_{\rm halo}=10^{12.6-14}\,M_\odot$ and unambiguously for $M_{\rm halo}>10^{14}\,M_\odot$, reflecting an inverse dependence of $M_{\rm\,HI,grp}/M_{\rm halo}$ and hot gas emission on halo mass. At fixed halo mass, $M_{\rm\,HI,grp}/M_{\rm halo}$ transitions to greater spread below $t_{\rm cross}\sim2$ Gyr. Dividing groups across this transition, lower-$t_{\rm cross}$ groups show elevated X-ray emission compared to higher-$t_{\rm cross}$ groups for $M_{\rm halo}>10^{13.3}\,M_\odot$, but this trend reverses for $M_{\rm halo}=10^{12.6-13.3}\,M_\odot$. Additionally, AGN-hosting halos below $M_{\rm halo}\sim10^{12.1}\,M_\odot$ exhibit a broad, $\sim$0.25 dex deep valley in $M_{\rm HI,grp}/M_{\rm halo}$ compared to non-AGN-hosting halos with correspondingly reduced FSMGR$_{\rm grp}$. When diluted by non-AGN-hosting halos, this valley becomes shallower and narrower, falling roughly between $M_{\rm halo}=10^{11.5}\,M_\odot$ and $M_{\rm halo}=10^{12.1}\,M_\odot$ in the overall $M_{\rm\,HI,grp}/M_{\rm\,halo}$ vs. $M_{\rm halo}$ relation. We may also detect a second, less easily interpreted valley at $M_{\rm halo}\sim10^{13}\,M_\odot$. Neither valley matches theoretical predictions of a deeper valley at or above $M_{\rm halo}=10^{12.1}\,M_\odot$.

 - **Abstract**
 Electromagnetic waves (EMWs) can be generated by gravitational waves (GWs) within magnetic field via the Gertsenshtein effect. The conversion probability between GWs and EMWs can be enhanced by inhomogeneities in the electron density and magnetic field within the magnetized plasma of both the Milky Way (MW) and the intergalactic medium (IGM) in the expanding universe. Polarized GWs can induce polarized EMWs, and the polarization properties of these EMWs can be altered by Faraday rotation as they propagate through magnetized plasma. Additionally, the polarization intensity of the EMWs may be weakened due to depolarization effects. In this study, we calculate the enhanced GW-EMW conversion in inhomogeneous magnetized plasma during the propagation of GWs through the universe and our galaxy. We analyze the polarization states of the EMWs generated by polarized GWs and discuss the depolarization effects induced by the medium's irregularities, as well as the differential Faraday rotation occurring in multi-layer polarized radiation. Our work provides alternative methods for detecting GWs and exploring their polarization states, and potentially constrain the parameters of the possible GW sources, especially the primordial black hole (PBH), contributing to the advancement of very-high-frequency GW detection and research.

 - **Abstract**
 Forming giant planets are accompanied by circumplanetary disks, as indicated by considerations of angular momentum conservation, observations of candidate protoplanets, and the satellite systems of planets in our Solar System. This paper derives surface density distributions for circumplanetary disks during the final stage of evolution when most of the mass is accreted. This approach generalizes previous treatments to include the angular momentum bias for the infalling material, more accurate solutions for the incoming trajectories, corrections to the outer boundary condition of the circumplanetary disk, and the adjustment of newly added material as it becomes incorporated into the Keplerian flow of the pre-existing disk. These generalizations lead to smaller centrifugal radii, higher column density for the surrounding envelopes, and higher disk accretion efficiency. In addition, we explore the consequences of different angular distributions for the incoming material at the outer boundary, with the concentration of the incoming flow varying from polar to isotropic to equatorial. These geometric variations modestly affect the disk surface density, but also lead to substantial modification to the location in the disk where the mass accretion rate changes sign. This paper finds analytic solutions for the orbits, source functions, surface density distributions, and the corresponding disk temperature profiles over the expanded parameter space outlined above.
