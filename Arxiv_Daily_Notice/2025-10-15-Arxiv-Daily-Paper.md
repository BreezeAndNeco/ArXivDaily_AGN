 - **Abstract**
 The origin of the first supermassive black holes (SMBHs) observed at redshifts $z\geq 9$ remains one of the most challenging open questions in astrophysics. Their rapid emergence suggests that massive ``heavy seeds'' must have formed early, possibly through the direct collapse of pristine gas clouds in the first galaxies. We present MESA-QUEST, a new framework built upon the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) code, designed to model the structure and evolution of quasi-stars -- massive, radiation-supported envelopes hosting accreting black holes at their cores -- believed to be the progenitors of direct-collapse black hole (DCBH) seeds. Our implementation introduces flexible boundary conditions representing both Bondi accretion and saturated-convection regimes, and explores the impact of several stellar wind and mass-loss prescriptions, including Reimers, Dutch, and super-Eddington radiation-driven winds. We find that quasi-stars can grow central black holes to $\geq 10^3\,M_{\odot}$ under favorable conditions, with saturated-convection models yielding BH-to-total mass ratios up to 0.55$M_*$ -- five times higher than Bondi-limited cases. However, strong radiation-driven winds can dramatically curtail growth, potentially quenching heavy-seed formation unless balanced by sustained envelope accretion. Our results delineate the physical limits under which quasi-stars can remain stable and produce heavy seeds capable of evolving into the earliest SMBHs detected by JWST and Chandra. Future extensions will incorporate rotation, magnetic fields, and GR-radiation hydrodynamics to refine accretion physics and constrain the viability of the quasi-star pathway for early SMBH formation.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the PHANGS-MUSE/HST-Halpha nebulae catalogue, comprising 5177 spatially resolved nebulae across 19 nearby star-forming galaxies (< 20 Mpc), based on high-resolution Halpha imaging from HST, homogenised to a fixed 10 pc resolution and sensitivity. Combined with MUSE spectroscopy, this enables robust classification of 4882 H II regions and separation of planetary nebulae and supernova remnants. Electron densities for 2544 H II regions are derived using [S II] diagnostics, and nebular sizes measured via circularised radii and second moments yield a median of 20 pc, extending to sub-parsec scales. A structural complexity score traces substructure, showing that about a third of regions are H II complexes, with a higher fraction in galaxy centres. A luminosity-size relation calibrated from the HST sample is applied to 30,790 MUSE nebulae, recovering sizes down to 1 pc. Observed sizes exceed classical Stromgren radii, implying typical volume filling factors of 0.22. We associate 3349 H II regions with stellar populations from PHANGS-HST, finding median ages of 3 Myr and masses of 4-5 log(Msun). The dataset provides a detailed, spatially resolved link between nebular structure and ionising sources, serving as a benchmark for future studies of feedback, diffuse ionised gas, and star formation regulation in the interstellar medium. The full catalogue is made publicly available in machine-readable format.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the dark matter (DM) halo environment in which galaxies that host active galactic nuclei (AGN) reside is a window into the nature of supermassive black hole (SMBH) accretion. We apply halo occupation distribution (HOD) modeling tools to interpret the angular cross-correlation functions between $1.5\times10^6$ luminous red galaxies (LRGs) and our $\sim28,500$ Hyper Suprime-Cam + Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer-selected (and $L_{6 \mu m}$-limited) AGN to infer the halo properties of distinct quasar samples at physical scales $s>0.1\,{\rm Mpc}$, for $z\in0.7-1.0$. We find that Type I (unobscured) and Type II (obscured) AGN cluster differently, both on small and large physical scales. The derived HODs imply that Type I AGN reside, on average, in substantially ($\sim3\times$) more massive halos ($M_h \sim 10^{13.4} M_\odot$) than Type II AGN ($M_h \sim 10^{12.9} M_\odot$) at $>5\sigma$ significance. While Type II AGN show one-halo correlations similar to that of galaxies of their average halo mass, the Type I AGN intra-halo clustering signal is significantly shallower. We interpret this observation with HOD methods and find Type I AGN are significantly less likely ($f_{sat}\sim0.05^{+1}_{-0.05}\%$) to be found in satellite galaxies than Type II AGN. We find reddened + obscured AGN to have typical satellite fractions for their inferred average halo mass ($\sim10^{13} M_\odot$), with $f_{sat} \sim 20^{+10}_{-5}\%$. Taken together, these results pose a significant challenge to the strict unified AGN morphological model, and instead suggest that a quasar's spectral class is strongly correlated with its host galaxy's dark matter halo environment. These intriguing results have provided a more complex picture of the SMBH -- DM halo connection, and motivate future analyses of the intrinsic galaxy and accretion properties of AGN.

 - **Abstract**
 Exoplanetary systems hosting multiple low-mass planets are thought to have experienced dynamical instability, during which planet-planet collisions and mergers occur; these collisions can impart substantial amount of angular momentum to the merger remnants, changing the obliquities of the resulting planets significantly. In this work, we carry out a series of $N$-body experiments to investigate the spin magnitude $(|\vec{S}|)$ and obliquity $(\theta_{\rm SL})$ distributions of low-mass exoplanets that have gone through planetary collisions. In our fiducial super-Earth (with $m=3M_{\oplus}$, $R=1.3R_{\oplus}$) and mini-Neptune systems (with $m=9M_{\oplus}$, $R=2.5R_{\oplus}$), the collision products follow a nearly uniform distribution in $\cos{\theta_{\rm SL}}$ and the spin-magnitude distribution is approximately linear in $|\vec{S}|$. Parameter studies and theoretical analysis show that increasing planetary radii or masses, or decreasing the initial planet-planet mutual inclinations, tend to polarize the obliquity distribution toward alignment or anti-alignment (i.e., excess probability near $\cos{\theta_{\rm SL}}=\pm1$). Experiments with initially two-planet and three-planet systems produce qualitatively similar outcomes, suggesting that the trends in this study may generalize to systems with higher planetary multiplicities.

 - **Abstract**
 The centers of massive elliptical galaxies exhibit a wide range in density profiles, from central cusps to resolved cores with order kiloparsec sizes. The cored ellipticals have been linked to the presence of supermassive black hole binaries that excavate their hosts' central stellar populations through three-body encounters. This connection between cores and black holes similarly operates in globular clusters, which also exhibit a bimodality in cored and core-collapsed architectures, respectively rich and depleted in stellar black holes. We report new estimates of the total black hole mass in 25 Galactic globular clusters based on a suite of roughly 150 Monte Carlo $N$-body simulations that fit observed surface brightness and velocity dispersion profiles. We show that both globular clusters and massive elliptical galaxies individually exhibit strong correlations between total black hole mass ($M_\bullet$) and core radius ($r_c$), and that these individual relations share a common power-law exponent to within $1\sigma$ statistical precision: $M_\bullet \sim r_c^{1.3}$. The individual relations appear to be offset, suggesting swarms of stellar black holes scour globular cluster cores more efficiently than lone supermassive black holes scour the cores of massive ellipticals. Yet the shared basis of core scouring via black hole binaries hints at a unified $M_{\bullet}-r_c$ connection across over 10 orders of magnitude in $M_\bullet$. Our findings imply core radius measurements may offer a powerful observational constraint on black hole merger rates, from kilohertz sources detectable by LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA formed in globular clusters to millihertz and nanohertz sources formed in massive elliptical galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a study of the metal, dust, and molecular gas content in galaxies within the A2744-z7p9OD proto-cluster at z ~ 7.88. We focus on two galaxy groups, the Quintet and the Chain, which are covered by the ELPIS survey (The Emission-Line Protocluster Imaging Survey of the furthest overdensity beyond Pandora's Cluster Abell 2744). [C II] 158 um emission is detected in five galaxies, revealing molecular gas reservoirs with log(M_gas/Msun) ~ 9.0-9.6, while dust continuum at the observed frame of 1.26 mm is detected in three galaxies, yielding dust masses of log(M_dust/Msun) ~ 6.0-6.4, assuming a dust temperature of T_dust = 45 (+15, -15) K. The derived properties, including stellar-to-dust mass ratios of log(M_dust/M_star) ~ -3 to -2 at log(M_star/Msun) ~ 9, and dust-to-gas mass ratios of log(M_dust/M_gas) ~ -4 to -3 at 12+log(O/H) ~ 8, place these galaxies in an intermediate regime: higher than the very low ratios expected from supernova-driven dust production, but still below the levels attained once efficient grain growth dominates. These values indicate a transition phase of dust mass assembly, likely reflecting the onset of grain growth via metal accretion under accelerated evolution in the proto-cluster core.

 - **Abstract**
 Observed rotation curves of dwarf galaxies exhibit significant diversity at fixed halo mass, challenging galaxy formation within the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) model. Previous cosmological galaxy formation simulations with baryonic physics fail to reproduce the full diversity of rotation curves, suggesting either that there is a flaw in baryonic feedback models, or that an alternative to CDM must be invoked. In this work, we use the Marvelous Massive Dwarf zoom-in simulations, a suite of high-resolution dwarf simulations with $M_{200}~\sim 10^{10}-10^{11}$ ${\rm M}_{\odot}$ and $M_{*}\sim 10^{7}-10^{9}$ ${\rm M}_{\odot}$, designed to target the mass range where galaxy rotation curve diversity is maximized, i.e., between $V_{\rm max} \sim 70-100~ {\rm km/s}$. We add to this a set of low-mass galaxies from the Marvel Dwarf Zoom Volumes to extend the galaxy mass range to lower values. Our fiducial star formation and feedback models produce simulated dwarfs with a broader range of rotation curve shapes, similar to observations. These are the first simulations that can both create dark matter cores via baryonic feedback, reproducing the slower rising rotation curves, while also allowing for compact galaxies and steeply rising rotation curves. Our simulated dwarfs also reproduce the observed size$-M_*$ relation, including scatter, producing both extended and compact dwarfs for the first time in simulated field dwarfs. We explore star formation and feedback models and conclude that previous simulations may have had feedback that was too strong to produce compact dwarfs.

 - **Abstract**
 The attracting properties of gravity enable matter present in cores to collapse into stars with seven orders of magnitude change in space and time making modelling of star formation a challenging multi-scale process. To circumvent this scale problem stars are replaced by a sub-grid sink particle at a much larger scale. Sink particles are created above a threshold density and acquire mass and momentum through accretion. In models where binary star systems form and migrate to separations of a few cells, the accretion flow is unresolved and the relative accretion rate to the sink particles may become inaccurate. We introduce a new recipe for accretion onto binary sink particles that have overlapping accretion regions and implement an algorithm to track the angular momentum of sink particles as a proxy for the stellar spin. Our preferential binary accretion recipe uses a virtual binary sink particle for the purpose of accretion and redistribute the accreted mass onto the sink particles according to results from models investigating binary accretion in detail. This solves problems common to current algorithms in many codes: (i) accretion is not suppressed due to large velocity differences between gas and stars, when that velocity is only internal to the binary system, (ii) the accretion rates are smoother for the unresolved close binaries in eccentric orbits, and (iii) non-physical suppression of accretion onto the secondary sink particle when the primary dominates the potential is eliminated. We test our implementation by comparing simulations at increasing resolution until the binaries are resolved. While not perfect, it mitigates undesired properties of current algorithms and in particularly for global models of starforming regions. It may also be applied to other unresolved accreting binaries, such as compact objects in clusters and binary supermassive black holes in cosmological models.
#### Evolutionary Links: From Gaia Neutron Star Binaries to Pulsar White Dwarf Endpoints

 - **Abstract**
 The discovery of wide, eccentric Gaia neutron stars (NSs) in binaries with still evolving (likely main sequence) companions offers a new probe of mass transfer and pulsar recycling beyond the compact-binary regime. We model their origins and fates using population synthesis with POSYDON and detailed binary evolution with MESA, contrasting two limiting prescriptions at Roche-lobe overflow (RLOF): enforced circularization versus explicitly eccentric mass transfer. Our MESA setups include updated treatments of eccentric, non-conservative transfer, magnetic-braking torques for cool stars, and neutron-star spin evolution with accretion and dipole spindown. Under optimistic assumptions, isolated evolution yields Gaia-like systems at only <1.5% relative rates of NS-evolving companion binaries, yet absolute numbers remain consistent with detections for continuous star formation. Synthetic populations indicate that many canonical millisecond pulsar-white dwarf (WD) binaries arise from unstable mass transfer and common envelope recycling, whereas Gaia systems typically avoid common envelope and only undergo stable mass transfer. In the case of capping accretion onto the NS at the Eddington rate, circular RLOF keeps the donor's mass-loss rate hovering around the Eddington limit and sustained over long timescales. Eccentric mass transfer instead produces briefer bursty signatures where the donor's mass-loss rate can climb up to a thousand times higher than in the circular case. The eccentric channel then leaves wide, eccentric NS-helium WD binaries with only mild recycling, whereas the circular channel yields long-lived transfer, circular NS-WD binaries (helium or carbon-oxygen core), and fully recycled millisecond pulsars.
#### Magnetic Decay Index Profile and Coronal Mass Ejection Speed

 - **Abstract**
 We study the relationship between the speed of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and the height profile of the ambient magnetic field, quantified by its decay index, n(h). Our sample is composed of 15 very fast CMEs (Vcme > 1500 km/s; all halo CMEs) and 22 halo CMEs below this speed limit from Solar Cycle 23. The very fast CMEs yield a high correlation of 0.81 between Vcme and the slope of n(h) in a height range above the onset height of the torus instability if one extremely fast outlier, which closely followed another very fast CME, is excluded. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the torus instability plays a decisive role in CME acceleration. The whole sample yields a weaker correlation, which is still significant if events with a broad torus-stable dip in n(h) are excluded. A parametric simulation study of flux-rope eruptions from quadrupolar and two-scale bipolar source regions confirms the decelerating effect of such dips. Very fast, moderate-velocity, and confined eruptions are found.

 - **Abstract**
 The center of the Milky Way is a unique environment of great astrophysical interest, but its extreme crowding and extinction make it difficult to study. The GALACTICNUCLEUS survey, a high-angular-resolution near-infrared imaging program, was designed to overcome these challenges. We present the methodology and first results of its second data release, which includes major improvements in reduction, calibration, and analysis, providing deeper photometry, improved astrometry, and high-precision proper motions across the Nuclear Stellar Disk. Observations were obtained with VLT/HAWK-I in two epochs separated by seven years, using speckle holography and a ground-layer adaptive optics system. Proper motions were derived both relative, by aligning epochs within the survey, and absolute, by tying to the Gaia reference frame. The new release achieves photometry about one magnitude deeper and astrometry about ten times more precise than the first release. Proper motions reach an accuracy of about 0.5 mas/yr relative to Gaia. In the Arches field, our clustering analysis recovers the cluster with mean velocities consistent with HST-based results. The second data release of the GALACTICNUCLEUS survey provides the most precise ground-based proper motion catalogs of the Galactic Center to date, enabling studies of the Nuclear Stellar Disk, young star kinematics, and new stellar cluster detections.

 - **Abstract**
 Polarization is very sensitive to the configuration of the magnetic field in the radiation region. In addition to polarization curve and polarization spectrum, studies of polarization angle (PA) rotation spectrum is also crucial. In this paper, we use a simple parametric magnetic reconnection model with a large-scale aligned magnetic field in the radiation region to study the effects of field orientation on the PA rotations. Under different field orientations, variations of the PA rotation with parameters and the PA rotation spectra are studied. We find that the conclusions obtained in our previous works are almost independent of the field orientations. The area of the parameter space with $\Delta$PA $>10^\circ$ will shrink as the value of field orientation ($\delta$) increases for $0^\circ<\delta<90^\circ$. The $\Delta$PA values would be the same for two complementary field orientations. For two particular magnetic field orientations ($\delta=0^\circ$ and $90^\circ$), the $\Delta$PA would also only be $0^\circ$ or $90^\circ$ within the burst duration.

 - **Abstract**
 Bow shocks generated from the interaction of winds from massive runaway stars with the interstellar medium have been shown to be prominent particle accelerators through recent $\gamma$-ray and radio synchrotron observations. Here, we study particle acceleration from bow shocks by conducting 3D ideal cosmic ray magnetohydrodynamic simulations in the advection-diffusion limit. We use the Eulerian grid-based code FLASH, where stellar winds are injected through tabulated wind velocities and mass loss rates. We implement a gradient-based shock detection algorithm to resolve the shocked regions where the CRs are injected dynamically. Simulations are performed for different values of the CR diffusion coefficient and star velocities within an ISM-like environment up to 180 kyr to showcase the impact of dynamical CR injection on the early evolution of the wind-driven bow shock. With a simplified spectral model in post-processing, we calculate the expected upper limits of $\gamma$-ray and synchrotron emission and compare with those from current observations. We observe that variations of CR diffusion rates can strongly dictate the morphology of the bow shock and the overall $\gamma$-ray and radio synchrotron luminosity due to the balance between the CR injection efficiency and diffusion. Our results yield qualitatively comparable results with current observations, primarily attributed to the high-energy protons and electrons contributing to non-thermal emission from efficient acceleration at the forward shock through the approximations and assumptions in the injection algorithm. We conclude that CR acceleration, with varying CR diffusion rates, may substantially affect the morphology of wind-driven bow shocks and their non-thermal emission, if there is efficient particle acceleration in the forward shock.

 - **Abstract**
 The decay of Short-Lived Radioisotopes (SLRs) can be a significant source of heating early in protoplanetary systems, though how a protoplanetary disk becomes enriched with these SLRs far above the galactic background level remains an open question. Observational evidence suggests that this enrichment occurs during the period from when the disk forms to when it progresses into a protoplanetary system, and is homogenous throughout the resultant planetary system. Whilst SLRs such as 26Al and 60Fe can be injected into disks through interaction with Wolf-Rayet winds and supernovae, these outflows can disrupt disks, and in the case of low-mass star-forming regions high-mass stars may not form at all. Recent research has determined the existence of AGB ``interlopers'', Asymptotic Giant Branch stars that pass close to or through star-forming regions that could be an alternative source of SLR enrichment to WR winds and supernovae. In this paper we study the effect of AGB interlopers on star-forming regions from a dynamical perspective, determining the enrichment amount of 26Al and 60Fe in disks within small clusters via numerous N-body simulations via a parameter space exploration. We find that enrichment is widespread from AGB stars, with efficient enrichment dependent on the time at which the interloper intersects the star-forming region. Velocity is a factor, though interlopers travelling at 30 km/s are capable of enriching many disks in a star-forming region assuming they encounter a disk when the interloper is more evolved.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the properties of the first generation of galaxies is an ongoing challenge in observational astrophysics. While advances in deep field observation have led to the identification of large numbers of galaxies within the Epoch of Reionization, there are very few observed galaxies at this range that are sufficiently bright for high signal-to-noise spectroscopy. To this end, we analyse HST and ground-based photometry of five candidate strongly lensed galaxies, all projected behind the cores of massive clusters and with similarly red optical-NIR colors. All are characterized by a drop-off in their spectra between the near-infrared and optical wavelengths, corresponding to a Lyman-break that sets a lower bound on their redshifts. Using the open-source SED modeling software Prospector, we characterize two of these galaxies as high-z (z $\sim$ 6.5-7) while the other three are low-z (z $\sim$ 2) despite all five having similar apparent magnitudes at the observed wavelengths. We demonstrate that for the brightest dropout candidates we can distinguish high-z galaxies from red or dusty low-z galaxies using limited photometric data. The bright sources enable deep constraints on the dropout color which, in combination with flat continua measured in redder bands, require high-z solutions when searching the parameter space. At the time of writing this work significantly increases the number of m_AB < 24 galaxies at or above a redshift of 6, and provides a path forward for future analysis on the early era of galaxy formation
#### A Possible Shutting-Down Event of Mass Accretion in An Active Galactic Nucleus at z~1.8

 - **Abstract**
 We present the discovery of a large gradual apparent fading event in optical and near-infrared wavelengths in a quasar at z=1.767 by a factor of 20-30 (in optical) over a period of ~20 years in the observed frame. This pronounced fading trend in brightness was first identified by comparing the magnitudes measured in the Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) images with those in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) images for ~3x10^4 quasars spectroscopically identified by SDSS. We performed follow-up observations, including optical imaging and spectroscopy as well as near-infrared imaging, with >4m-class telescopes such as Subaru, GTC, Keck, and SOAR telescopes. We combine these new data with the archival data to examine the variability behavior over ~20 years in detail and even the longer-term trend of the variability over ~70 years in the observed frame. We find that (i) the AGN component likely faded by a factor of ~50 from the early 2000s to 2023 and (ii) the observed brightness decline is best explained by a substantial decrease in accretion rate rather than time-varying line-of-sight dust obscuration. These findings are derived from multi-component (time-varying AGN + constant galaxy) spectral energy distribution fitting over multi-epochs, which is well consistent with the optical spectra. The Eddington ratio decreases by a factor of ~50, from ~0.4 to ~0.008 if we use the black hole mass measured with the SDSS spectrum, which could be highly uncertain because of the very large variability. The total brightness is dominated by the host galaxy in the rest-frame optical wavelength rather than the AGN as of 2023.

Sensitive to the superhorizon inhomogeneites, they provide a unique way to probe physics at the largest scales, bypassing the limitations of cosmic variance inherent in the primary cosmic microwave background (CMB). In this work, we focus on the bubble collision predicted by the eternal inflation theory, which can leave distinct azimuthally symmetric patterns on the superhorizon scales, potentially detectable through the RDF and RQF. We present the first analytic expression of the RQF signal induced by bubble collision and validate it against numerical calculations performed with $\texttt{RemoteField}$, a new public software tool we developed, finding excellent agreement between the two. Combining our new RQF calculation with the corresponding RDF signal calculated by prior work, we forecast the constraining power on bubble collision parameters using RDF/RQF reconstruction. We find that, for an CMB-S4-like and an LSST-like experiment, the RDF reconstruction can provide comparable constraining power as that from the primary CMB alone; and the RQF reconstruction can improve the constraining power by about an order of magnitude. We argue that these constraints can be improved further by including more RDF/RQF multipoles included and by using tomographic techniques to mitigate the standard $\Lambda$CDM signal. We anticipate the framework we developed in this work to be broadly applicable to probe other superhorizon-scale physics, such as cosmic topology and domain walls.

 - **Abstract**
 Polar fields at the minimum of a sunspot cycle -- which are a manifestation of the radial component of the Sun's poloidal field -- are deemed to be the best indicator of the strength of the toroidal component, and hence the amplitude of the future sunspot cycle. However, the Sun's polar magnetic fields are difficult to constrain with ground-based or space-based observations from near the plane-of-ecliptic. In this context, polar filaments -- dark, elongated structures that overlie polarity inversion lines -- are known to offer critical insights into solar polar field dynamics. Through investigations of the long-term evolution of polar filament areas and length acquired from the Meudon Observatory and complimentary solar surface flux transport simulations, here we establish the common physical foundation connecting the Babcock-Leighton solar dynamo mechanism of solar polar field reversal and build-up with the origin and evolution of polar filaments. We discover a new relationship connecting the residual filament area of adjacent solar cycles with the amplitude of the next sunspot cycle -- which can serve as a new tool for solar cycle forecasts -- advancing the forecast window to earlier than polar field based precursors. We conclude that polar filament properties encapsulate the physics of interaction of the poloidal magnetic field of the previous and current sunspot cycles, the resultant of which is the net poloidal magnetic field at the end of the current cycle, thus encoding as a precursor the strength of the upcoming solar cycle.

 - **Abstract**
 A significant number of hypervelocity stars with velocities between $1500-2500$ km/s have recently been observed. The only plausible explanation so far is that they have been produced through thermonuclear supernovae in white dwarf binaries. Since these stars are thought to be surviving donors of Type Ia supernovae, a surprising finding was that these stars are inflated, with radii an order of magnitude more than expected for Roche-lobe filling donors. Recent attempts at explaining them have combined 3-dimensional hydrodynamical supernova explosion simulations with 1-dimensional stellar modelling to explain the impact of supernova shocks on runaway white dwarfs. However, only the hottest and most compact of those runaway stars can so far marginally be reproduced by detailed models of runaways from supernova explosions. In this and a companion paper, we introduce a new \textsc{Arepo} simulation of two massive CO white dwarfs that explode via a violent merger. There, the primary white dwarf ignites when the secondary is on its last orbit and plunging towards the primary. In the corresponding aftermath, the core of the secondary white dwarf of 0.16 M$_\odot$, remains bound, moving at a velocity of $\sim2800$ km/s. We map this object into MESA, and show that this runaway star can explain the observations of two hypervelocity stars that were dubbed D6-1 and D6-3 based on their original discovery motivated by the D6 scenario, though the violent merger scenario presented here is somewhat distinct from the D6 scenario.

 We review recent advances in the numerical modeling of turbulent flows and star formation. An overview of the most widely used simulation codes and their core capabilities is provided. We then examine methods for achieving the highest-resolution magnetohydrodynamical turbulence simulations to date, highlighting challenges related to numerical viscosity and resistivity. State-of-the-art approaches to modeling gravity and star formation are discussed in detail, including implementations of star particles and feedback from jets, winds, heating, ionization, and supernovae. We review the latest techniques for radiation hydrodynamics, including ray tracing, Monte Carlo, and moment methods, with comparisons between the flux-limited diffusion, moment-1, and variable Eddington tensor methods. The final chapter summarizes advances in cosmic-ray transport schemes, emphasizing their growing importance for connecting small-scale star formation physics with galaxy-scale evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Time-domain studies of mid-infrared and submillimeter variability have shown that at least half of protostars are variable. We present a statistical analysis of mid-infrared variability among young stellar objects (YSOs) in the distant, massive star-forming region W51 using NEOWISE data. From a catalog of 81 protostars, 527 disk objects, and 37,687 other sources including diskless pre-main sequence and evolved contaminants, we identified significant variability in the 3.4 um (W1) and 4.6 um (W2) bands. Because of W51's distance (~5.4 kpc) and extinction, the sample mainly includes intermediate- to high-mass YSOs (>2 Msun), unlike nearby regions dominated by low-mass stars. This mass bias may affect the observed variability. In W2, 11.1% of protostars, 7.6% of disk objects, and 0.6% of PMS+E sources showed secular variability, while 8.6%, 2.3%, and 0.5% showed stochastic variability; similar fractions were found in W1. The variability fraction and amplitude increase toward earlier stages. Protostars exhibit high-amplitude stochastic changes likely driven by dynamic accretion and extinction, whereas disk objects show more secular patterns-linear, curved, or periodic-possibly due to moderate accretion variations or disk geometry. Color-magnitude analysis shows that protostars generally redden as they brighten, consistent with enhanced dust emission or variable extinction, while disk objects show mixed trends: roughly balanced in W1 but more often bluer in W2, suggesting reduced extinction or hotspot modulation. These results highlight distinct mechanisms of variability across evolutionary stages and demonstrate that mid-infrared monitoring offers key insight into accretion and disk evolution in young stars.

 - **Abstract**
 JWST observations reveal numerous quiescent galaxies (QGs) at high redshift ($z \sim 4-8$), challenging models of early galaxy formation and quenching. Accurate number density estimates are crucial for comparison with theory but remain uncertain. We systematically study QGs at $0.5 < z < 8$ using a mass-complete sample from the JWST/PRIMER survey with deep NIRCam and MIRI imaging. The MIRI data, probing rest-frame near-infrared at $z \sim 3-8$, are vital for robust stellar mass measurement and QG identification. We find that nearly all photometrically selected, point-like QG candidates located in the UVJ QG region are actually "Little Red Dots", for which the UVJ colors were wrongly estimated due to inaccurate photometric redshift estimation. MIRI reduces significantly contamination to high-mass QGs from star-forming galaxies, yielding lower number densities than previous studies. The evolution of QG number density is strongly mass-dependent. The density of high-mass QGs ($\log (M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) > 10.3$) decreases rapidly from $n = 1\times10^{-5}~\mathrm{Mpc^{-3}}$ at $z=3-4$ to $n=2\times10^{-6}~\mathrm{Mpc^{-3}}$ at $z = 4-5$, becoming negligible ($n \lesssim 10^{-6}~\mathrm{Mpc^{-3}}$ ) at $z > 5$. Conversely, low-mass QGs ($9<\log (M_{\star}/M_{\odot})<10.3$) maintain a nearly constant number density ($n\sim3\times10^{-6}~\mathrm{Mpc^{-3}}$) across $z = 4-8$. This suggests low-mass QGs at $z > 4$ are likely temporarily quenched, akin to mini-quenched galaxies. Comparison with major hydrodynamical and semi-analytical models shows most underestimate high-mass QG densities at $z>4$ and fail to reproduce the constant low-mass QG density at $z>5$.

 - **Abstract**
 The advent of the X-ray microcalorimeter spectrometer Resolve onboard the XRISM space telescope opened a new era for high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy of astrophysical plasmas. Many spectral features were newly detected, including the K alpha and K beta inner-shell transition lines of mildly ionized (F- to Li-like) Fe at 6-8 keV in the spectra of X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei. The widely used atomic databases contain information on the K alpha but not K beta lines of these ions. We conducted the atomic structure calculation using FAC to derive the Fe K alpha and K beta lines and verified the result against ground experiments and other calculations of the Fe K alpha lines. We then implemented the Fe K beta lines in a radiative transfer code (cloudy) and compared the synthesized and observed spectra with XRISM. A reasonably good agreement was obtained between the observation and the ab initio calculations. This exemplifies the need to expand the atomic databases to interpret astrophysical spectra.

 - **Abstract**
 Globular clusters (GCs) are fundamental for understanding the integrated light of old stellar populations and galaxy assembly processes. However, the role of hot, evolved stars, such as horizontal branch (HB), extreme HB, and blue stragglers, remains poorly constrained. These stars are often underrepresented or entirely excluded from stellar population models, despite their dominant contribution to the ultraviolet (UV) flux. Their presence can bias age estimates by mimicking the spectral signatures of younger populations. We examined the impact of evolved hot stars on the models using two well-studied Galactic GCs with high-quality Hubble Space Telescope photometry and integrated spectra from the International Ultraviolet Explorer and the Blanco Telescope. NGC 2808 and NGC 7089 (M 2) have extended HBs and are proxies for old stellar populations. Integrated spectra were constructed using a color magnitude diagram-based (CMD-based) method, matching observed stars to evolutionary phases and then to appropriate synthetic stellar libraries, enabling the HB morphology to be taken into account. Our findings show that the inclusion of evolved hot stars significantly improves the agreement between the model and observed spectra from the UV to the optical. The inclusion of these phases reduced the residuals in spectral comparisons. Our results reinforce that comprehensive stellar population models incorporating evolved hot components are essential to accurately date unresolved systems and to robustly trace formation histories of extragalactic galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. At this time, the list of known magnetic {\delta} Scuti stars is extremely limited, with only a handful of well-studied examples. Aims. We seek to expand this list, by retrieving targets from a variety of sources and demonstrating that they present simultaneously a surface magnetic field signature and {\delta} Scuti pulsations. Methods. We obtained archival and new spectropolarimetric datasets for a variety of known {\delta} Scuti stars and analysed them using the Least Squares Deconvolution method to generate mean Stokes I and V profiles for each target, from which we can determine longitudinal magnetic field measurements. Additionally, we assessed photometric data from the TESS satellite to discern frequency peaks consistent with {\delta} Scuti pulsations in known magnetic stars, and to identify magnetic candidates via rotational modulation. Results. We present a compiled list of all the confirmed magnetic {\delta} Scuti stars discovered to date, containing 13 stars. The majority of this sample lies outside the usual {\delta} Scuti instability strip in the H-R diagram, though we do not observe any specific correlations between magnetic field strength and various stellar parameters. This indicates that strong global magnetic fields play a fundamental role in shaping interior structure and processes. Magnetic fields thus must be included in realistic stellar models in order to more accurately predict structure and evolution. Conclusions. This work constitutes the largest database to date of strongly magnetic {\delta} Scuti stars, one that will continue to grow over time with subsequent studies.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate galaxy populations in the HS1700+64 protocluster at $z=2.30$, characterized by two prominent linear filaments traced by spatially extended Ly$\alpha$ blobs. We conducted a wide area mapping of emission line galaxies across the protocluster using the unique combination of three matched narrow-band filters, corresponding to Ly$\alpha$, H$\alpha$, and [OIII] emission lines at $z=2.30$. We find that H$\alpha$ emitters are strongly clustered at the intersection of the filaments, suggesting a protocluster core. In contrast, Ly$\alpha$ emitters tend to avoid the dense region and the filaments, likely due to the resonant scattering of Ly$\alpha$ photons by HII gas and/or enhanced dust attenuation in galaxies associated with these structures. These findings support a scenario in which cold gas flows via filaments and to the core, fed by the cold-stream mode accretion in the early phase of protocluster assembly, and promoting active star formation there. Further evidence of the scenario comes from the alignment of massive, evolved galaxies in those filaments traced by distant red galaxies, suggesting accelerated galaxy growth in the filaments in the early Universe. This study clearly shows observationally that accelerated galaxy formation takes place not only in the protocluster core but also in the associated surrounding filamentary structure. This underscores the critical role of large-scale filaments in efficiently accumulating the cold gas and channeling it to galaxies therein and to the protocluster core. Such vigorous gas assembly facilitates star formation activity and drives galaxy growth in the early stage of cluster formation.

 - **Abstract**
 A central question regarding neutron star mergers is whether they are able to produce all the r-process elements, from first to third peak. The high abundances of first-peak elements (atomic number $Z \sim 31-40$) in the solar composition means they may dominate the ejecta mass in kilonovae. We here study theoretical infrared signatures of such light elements with spectral synthesis modelling. By combining state-of-the-art NLTE physics with new radiative and collisional data for these elements, we identify several promising diagnostic lines from Ge, As, Se, Br, Kr and Zr. The models give self-consistent line luminosities and indicate specific features that probe emission volumes at early phases ($\sim$10d), the product of ion mass and electron density in late phases ($\gtrsim$75d), and in some cases direct ionic masses at intermediate phases. Emission by [Se I] 5.03 \mum\ + [Se III] 4.55 \mum\ can produce satisfactory fits to the Spitzer photometry of AT2017gfo. However, the models show consistently that with a Kr/Te and Se/Te ratio following the solar r-process pattern, Kr + Se emission is dominant over Te for the blend at 2.1 \mum\ observed in both AT2017gfo and AT2023vfi. The somewhat better line profile fit with [Te III] may suggest that both AT2017gfo and AT2023vfi had a strongly sub-solar production of the light r-process elements. An alternative scenario could be that Kr + Se in an asymmetric morphological distribution generates the feature. Further JWST spectral data, in particular covering the so far unobserved $>5$ \mum\ region, holds promise to determine the light r-process production of kilonovae, and in particular whether the light elements are made in a slow disk wind or in a fast proto-NS outflow. We identify specific needs for further atomic data on recombination rates and collision strengths for $Z=31-40$ elements.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a study of 27 very UV-bright (-22.0<MUV<-24.4) sources at z~6 identified in SHELLQs survey. Stacking their rest-frame UV spectra reveals a prominent NV1240A P-Cygni, consistent with very young (~6Myr) stellar populations dominated by massive stars. They are thus powerful and efficient ionizing starbursts with an average ionizing photon production efficiency of log(Xi_ion/Hz erg-1)=25.54. For one of these, J0217-0208 at z=6.2 (MUV=-23.4), we analyzed NIRCam and NIRSpec data. Its SED indicates a young (~5Myr), compact (reff~260pc) starburst with a stellar mass of 10^9Msun and high sSFR (~100Gyr^-1). This translates to high stellar mass and SFR surface densities, about 100x higher than typical galaxies at similar redshifts. NIRSpec further reveals strong nebular emission, for which we derive a high electron density (~10^3 cm^-3), a metallicity 12+log(O/H)=8.20 (from the direct method), and a super-solar N/O ratio (log(N/O)=-0.30). Furthermore, J0217-0208 shows broad components in several rest-optical lines, indicating powerful ionized outflows, which appear heavily obscured (E(B-V)~0.6), in contrast to the nearly dust-free stellar continuum (E(B-V)~0.01). Combined with ALMA detections of a massive, extended, and cold dust reservoir, these findings point to dusty, feedback-driven outflows carrying and pushing dust well beyond the stellar core, boosting the observed UV luminosity. Our results suggest that UV-bright galaxies at high redshift represent short-lived but extreme phases of rapid stellar mass growth, efficient ionizing photon production, and strong feedback. The extreme properties of J0217-0208, such as supersolar N/O, steep UV slope, compact size, and very high surface densities, closely mirror those of the brightest galaxies at z>10, suggesting a shared evolutionary pathway.[Abridged]

 - **Abstract**
 Intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) are the link between stellar-mass and supermassive black holes. Gravitational waves have started unveiling a population of IMBHs in the $\sim 100-300 \, \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ range. Here, we investigate the formation of IMBHs from very massive stars (VMSs, $>100\,{} \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$). We calculate new VMS models that account for the transition from optically thin to optically thick winds, and study how this enhanced mass loss affects IMBH formation and the black hole mass function at intermediate and high metallicity ($Z=10^{-4}-0.02$). We show that optically thick winds suppress the formation of IMBHs from direct VMS collapse at metallicities $Z>0.001$, one order of magnitude lower than predicted by previous models. Our models indicate that the stellar progenitors of GW231123 must have had a metallicity $Z<0.002$, if the primary black hole formed via direct VMS collapse.
#### Enhanced Localization of Dark Lensed Gravitational Wave Events Enables Host Galaxy Identification and Precise Cosmological Inference

 - **Abstract**
 Lensed gravitational wave (GW) events are expected to be powerful new probes of cosmology, contingent on redshift measurement by electromagnetic observations. Host galaxy identification is thus crucial but challenging due to poor localization by GW signal alone. In this paper, we show that the third-generation ground-based GW detectors will detect a population of lensed events with three or more detectable images (including the central one), each arriving at distinct times and Earth locations in the space, forming an effective network that reduces the typical localization area to $\sim0.01$ deg$^2$. For at least $90\%$ (or $50\%$) of these events, the localization improves by more than a factor of $10$ (or $30$) comparing with unlensed cases. Such precise localization and multiple-image detections enable robust host-galaxy identification and, through lens modelling, further yield sub-arcsecond position. As ``dark lensed sirens", these events become powerful probes of cosmological parameters. Using simulated lensed compact-binary mergers, we show that two-year or longer observations with third-generation GW detectors can measure the Hubble constant to $\lesssim1$\% precision via ``dark lensed sirens" (even when relying solely on lensed stellar-mass binary black hole events), while simultaneously constraining other cosmological parameters. This approach will provide an independent, complementary avenue for measuring cosmological parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 The stellar Rossby number, a dimensionless parameter quantifying the influence of Coriolis forces on convective motions, plays a pivotal role in understanding magnetic stellar evolution. In this work, we explore the connection between the Rossby number and potential dynamo mechanisms in Sun-like stars, as well as its dependence on fundamental stellar properties. We present a novel, detailed asteroseismic calibration of the convective turnover time, incorporating for the first time Gaia photometry alongside surface gravity, effective temperature, and stellar metallicity. Our analysis employs an expanded sample of more than 150 stars, including targets from the Kepler LEGACY and KOI surveys, as well as more evolved stars observed by TESS and K2. This sample spans evolutionary stages from the main sequence to the early red giant branch (RGB), enabling a comprehensive investigation of Rossby number trends across stellar evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Jets and outflows are key components of low-mass star formation, regulating accretion and shaping the surrounding molecular clouds. These flows, traced by molecular species at (sub)millimeter wavelengths (e.g., CO, SiO, SO, H$_2$CO, and CH$_3$OH) and by atomic, ionized, and molecular lines in the infrared (e.g., H$_2$, [Fe II], [S I]), originate from protostellar accretion disks deeply embedded within dusty envelopes. Jets play a crucial role in removing angular momentum from the disk, thereby enabling continued mass accretion, while directly preserving a record of the protostar's outflow history and potentially providing indirect insights into its accretion history. Recent advances in high-resolution, high-sensitivity observations, particularly with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in the infrared and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at (sub)millimeter wavelengths, have revolutionized studies of protostellar jets and outflows. These instruments provide complementary views of warm, shock-excited gas and cold molecular component of the jet-outflow system. In this review, we discuss the current status of observational studies that reveal detailed structures, kinematics, and chemical compositions of protostellar jets and outflows. Recent analyses of mass-loss rates, velocities, rotation, molecular abundances, and magnetic fields provide critical insights into jet launching mechanisms, disk evolution, and the potential formation of binary systems and planets. The synergy of JWST's infrared sensitivity and ALMA's high-resolution imaging is advancing our understanding of jets and outflows. Future large-scale, high-resolution surveys with these facilities are expected to drive major breakthroughs in outflow research.

 - **Abstract**
 The Zone of Avoidance (ZoA) remains one of the last frontiers in constructing a comprehensive three-dimensional map of the Universe. Galactic extinction, stellar crowding, and confusion noise have historically limited the detection of background galaxies in these regions, with implications for large-scale structure and cosmological measurements. We assess the capability of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) to detect extragalactic sources in a heavily contaminated region of the Milky Way. We analyzed JWST/NIRCam wide-filter images of NGC 3324 with a customized implementation of SExtractor v2.28. Sources were detected in the F444W band, cross-matched with F090W and F200W, and validated against recent DAOPHOT point spread function (PSF) photometry. A refined sample was obtained through full width at half maximum (FWHM) - signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) criteria and visual inspection. We identified 102 galaxies across the JWST/NIRCam field of view. The magnitude (F444W) distribution is bimodal, with about 10% brighter than m_F444W < 15 mag and about 60% in the range 17 < m_F444W < 19 mag. Typical sizes are FWHM ~6.5 arcsec, from compact to extended systems with isophotal areas up to ~2000 pixels (~7.9 arcsec^2). Morphologies span from compact to spiral and lenticular systems, including a compact group at the eastern edge of the field. We also report the detection of "transnebular galaxies", visible through the most opaque regions of the molecular cloud. These results demonstrate the potential of JWST/NIRCam to probe extragalactic sources through highly obscured Galactic regions, opening new avenues for mapping large-scale structures across the ZoA.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar rotation has long been recognized as important to the evolution of stars, by virtue of the chemical mixing it can induce and how it interacts with binary mass transfer. Binary interaction and rapid rotation are both common in massive stars and involve processes of angular momentum distribution and transport. An important question is how this angular momentum transport leads to the creation of two important classes of rapidly rotating massive stars, Be stars defined by disklike emission lines, and Bn stars defined by rotationally broadened absorption lines. A related question is what limits this rotation places on how conservative the mass transfer can be. Central to addressing these issues is knowledge of how close to rotational break-up stars can get before they produce a disk. Here we calculate diagnostics of this rotational criticality using the continuum polarization arising from a combination of rotational stellar distortion (i.e., oblateness) and redistribution of stellar flux (i.e., gravity darkening), and compare polarizations produced in the von Zeipel approximation with the approach of Espinosa Lara & Rieutard (ELR). Both produce similar photospheric polarizations that rise significantly in the far ultraviolet (FUV) for B stars, with a stronger signal in the von Zeipel case. For early main-sequence and subgiant stars, it reaches a maximum of ~1% at 140 nm for stars rotating at 98% of critical, when seen edge-on. Rotational rates above 80% critical result in polarizations of several tenths of a percent, at high inclination. These predicted stable signal strengths indicate that determinations of near-critical rotations in B stars could be achieved with future spectropolarimetric instrumentation that can reach deep into the FUV, such as CASSTOR, the Polstar mission concept, or the POLLUX detector design.

 - **Abstract**
 DIPLODOCUS (Distribution-In-PLateaux methODOlogy for the CompUtation of transport equationS) is a novel framework being developed for the general transport of particle distribution functions through the seven dimensions of phase space, including forcing terms and interactions between particles. Following Paper I, which details the background analytic framework, this second paper provides an overview of the numerical implementation in the form of the code package this http URL, written in Julia, including the description of a novel Monte-Carlo sampling technique for the pre-computation of anisotropic collision integrals. In addition to the discussion of numerical implementation, a selection of test cases are presented to examine the package's capabilities. These test cases focus on micro-scale physical effects: binary collisions, emissive interactions and external forces that are relevant to the modelling of jetted astrophysical sources, such as Active Galactic Nuclei and X-Ray Binaries.

 - **Abstract**
 Robust extragalactic distance measurements are crucial for resolving the persistent discrepancy in the value of the Hubble constant (H$_0$)). Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), through their compact and variable broad-line regions (BLRs), enable the determination of geometric distances when reverberation mapping (RM) is combined with spectroastrometry(SA). We report results from a spectroscopic RM campaign (October 2022 to March 2023) targeting two narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies, Mrk 1048 and Mrk 618, using 3.6-m DOT and 2-m HCT. High-cadence spectro-photometric monitoring was carried out using onboard instruments such as ADFOSC, HFOSC, and TANSPEC, resulting in well-sampled continuum and emission line light curves. The observed fractional variability ($F_{\mathrm{var}}$) ranged from 4% to 14% across the $g$-band, H$\beta$, and H$\alpha$ light curves. The time lags were measured using the interpolated cross-correlation function (ICCF), PyI$^{2}$CCF, and \textsc{JAVELIN} methods. In the rest frame, the ICCF analysis yields H$\beta$ lags of $10.5^{+2.6}_{-4.2}$ days for Mrk 1048 and $10.2^{+3.4}_{-2.9}$ days for Mrk 618, while the corresponding H$\alpha$ lags are $18.7^{+5.3}_{-5.4}$ and $14.4^{+4.6}_{-10.5}$ days, respectively. The emission-line widths, measured from the rms spectra using $\sigma_{\mathrm{line}}$, give virial black hole mass estimates of $6.3^{+2.0}_{-2.1} \times 10^7\,M_\odot$ for Mrk 1048 and $1.2^{+0.4}_{-0.6} \times 10^7\,M_\odot$ for Mrk 618. These results will serve as a basis for absolute geometric distance calibration when combined with VLTI/GRAVITY spectro-astrometric measurements, thereby contributing to the development of AGNs as standardizable cosmological probes.

 - **Abstract**
 We observed NH3 metastable inversion lines from (3, 3) to (18, 18) toward G0.66-0.13 in the Galactic center with the Shanghai Tianma 65m radio telescope and Yebes 40 m telescope. Highly-excited lines of NH3 (17, 17), (18, 18) were detected in emission for the first time in the interstellar medium, with upper energy levels up to 3100 K. Mapping observations reveal widespread hot molecular gas traced by NH3 (13, 13) toward G0.66-0.13. The rotation temperatures of hot gas traced by NH3 exceed 400 K, which amounts to five percent of the total NH3 in the Galactic Center. Hot gas (>400 K) and warm gas (100-140 K) are found in distinct clumps, with the hot gas located at the interfacing regions between different warm clouds. The theory of intermittency in turbulence reproduces the complex temperature structure in the central molecular zone, especially the hot gas observed here. The results presented here demonstrate that turbulence heating dominates the heating of the molecular gas in the Central Molecular Zone, while the turbulence is induced by the shear-motion of molecular clouds under the gravitational potential of the nuclear star clusters and the supermassive black hole. Our results suggest that shear-induced turbulence heating could be a widespread factor influencing galactic evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 A coronal loop of 290~Mm length, observed at 171~Å with SDO/AIA on February 6th 2024 near AR 13571, is found to oscillate with two significantly different oscillation periods, $48.8 \pm 6.1$~min and $4.8\pm 0.3$~min. The oscillations occur in the time intervals without detected flares or eruptions. Simultaneously, near the Northern footpoint of the oscillating loop, we detect a $49.6 \pm 5.0$-min periodic variation of the average projected photospheric magnetic field observed with SDO/HMI. The shorter-period decayless oscillation is attributed to the eigen-mode, standing kink oscillation of the loop, while the longer-period oscillation may be the oscillatory motion caused by the periodic footpoint driver. The photospheric long-period process can also drive the short-period, eigen oscillation of the loop via the self-oscillatory, \lq\lq violin\rq\rq\, mechanism, in which a transverse oscillation is excited by an external quasi-steady flow. This finding indicates that the most powerful, lower-frequency spectral components of photospheric motions, which are well below the Alfvénic/kink cutoff, can reach the corona.

 - **Abstract**
 We detect the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich imprint of peculiar motions of galaxy groups and clusters, using the photometric DESI Legacy Survey together with cosmic microwave background (CMB) maps from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). We develop a comprehensive forward model based on the AbacusSummit cosmological simulations: mock galaxy group catalogues and synthetic kSZ maps are generated, together with a reconstructed peculiar velocity field that allows for photo-$z$ errors, redshift-space distortions, and survey masks. We investigate possible contamination from the cosmic infrared background (CIB), finding that CIB effects are subdominant to the kSZ signal in the relevant ACT frequency channel. We then predict the kSZ signal expected when stacking CMB temperature maps around groups, taking account of their estimated radial velocity. Comparing the model with observations, we are able to constrain the total baryon fraction within haloes, as well as their internal gas profiles. We find evidence for mass dependence of the halo baryon fraction within the virial this http URL gas fraction in massive groups is consistent with the universal baryon fraction, but low-mass groups ($10^{12.5} \lesssim M\,/h^{-1}\mathrm{M}_\odot \lesssim 10^{14}$) are depleted to $0.21 \pm 0.06$ times the universal baryon fraction. We find this low virial baryon fraction to be consistent with an extended gas profile, for which the total baryon content reaches the universal value well beyond the virial radius. This conclusion is consistent with previous analyses using X-ray, kSZ, and weak lensing, and plausibly reflects energetic feedback processes from the galaxies in these haloes.

 - **Abstract**
 The MIRI Excesses Around Degenerates Survey is a Cycle 2 James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Survey program designed to image nearby white dwarfs in the mid-IR with the MIRI imaging mode. Only a handful of white dwarfs have previously been observed beyond 8~\micron. This survey gathered observations for 56 white dwarfs within 25~pc at 10 and 15~\micron, probing each white dwarf for unresolved IR excesses, IR flux deficits indicative of collision induced absorption, or resolved substellar companions. We present in this paper observations of our first target, 2MASS J09424023-4637176, (also UCAC4 217-039132), henceforth called MEAD 62. It is a magnetic DA white dwarf with an estimated age of $7.6^{+1.7}_{-2.2}$\,Gyr. A red candidate companion, MEAD 62B, about 2 magnitudes fainter at 15\,$\mu$m than the white dwarf is detected at an apparent separation of 1.95". If confirmed, MEAD 62B, would be a $0.014^{+0.002}_{-0.003}$\,\Msun\, brown dwarf with T$_{\rm eff} = 343^{+7}_{-11}$\,K, according to ATMO2020 evolutionary models. Although its red F1000W$-$F1500W color is similar to background galaxies, MEAD 62B, is consistent with being an unresolved point-source from empirical PSF fitting. A false positive analysis yields an expectation number of 0.66 red (F1000W$-$F1500$ \geq +0.80$\,mag) unresolved sources within the same separation (r$\leq2$ arcsec) for the entire MEAD survey. Thus, this candidate companion as likely to be an actual companion as a false-positive unresolved background galaxy. Additional observations to measure common proper motion or sample the SED are warranted to confirm the nature of MEAD 62B. A deep near-infrared imaging detection is achievable from the ground while JWST is needed at longer infrared wavelengths.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an implementation of radiative transfer with flux-limited diffusion (FLD) for the moving-mesh code {\small AREPO} and use the method in a physical model for the formation of protostars with non-ideal radiation-magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD). We follow previous work in splitting the additional terms to the hydrodynamical equations arising from the inclusion of radiation into terms to be integrated explicitly and implicitly, as the diffusion and coupling terms would impose very restrictive timestep criteria. We validate the scheme with standard test problems for radiation diffusion, matter-gas coupling, and radiative shocks from the literature. Our implementation is compatible with local timestepping, which often presents problems for implicit schemes, and we found very good agreement with results obtained with global timesteps. We present an example application of the new implementation to the collapse of a $1\,{\rm M}_\odot$ molecular cloud core to a second Larson core modelled with radiation non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics. A high-velocity jet with v$_{\rm rad}> 10\, {\rm km\,s^{-1}}$ is self-consistently launched from the second core, nested within the first core, which produces a lower-velocity magnetorotational outflow. We observe magnetic field amplification up to more than $\vert \mathbf{B}\vert_{\rm max}>10^5$~G in the second core, which is surrounded by a small ($<0.5$~au) disk. This application demonstrates the robustness of our scheme in multi-scale and high-resolution simulations on arbitrary meshes and, as such, the model can be readily used for further simulations of protostar formation at high resolution.

 - **Abstract**
 The discovery of high-redshift galaxies exhibiting a steep spectral UV downturn potentially indicative of two-photon continuum emission marks a turning point in our search for signatures of top-heavy star formation in the early Universe. We develop a photometric search method for identifying further nebular-dominated galaxy candidates, whose nebular continuum dominates over the starlight, due to the high ionising photon production efficiencies $\xi_\mathrm{ion}$ associated with massive star formation. We utilise the extensive medium-band imaging from JADES, which enables the identification of Balmer jumps across a wide range of redshifts ($1.5 < z < 8.5$), through the deficit in rest-frame optical continuum level. As Balmer jumps are a general recombination feature of young starbursts ($\lesssim 3$~Myr), we further demand a high observed $\log\, (\xi_\mathrm{ion, obs}/\mathrm{(Hz\ erg^{-1})}) > 25.60$ to power the strong nebular continuum, together with a relatively non-blue UV slope indicating a lack of stellar continuum emission. Our nebular-dominated candidates, constituting ${\sim}$10% of galaxies at $z \sim 6$ (decreasing to ${\sim}$3% at $z \sim 2$, not completeness-corrected) are faint in the rest-frame optical (median $M_\mathrm{opt} = -17.95$) with extreme line emission (median $\mathrm{EW}_\mathrm{H\alpha,rest} = 1567$ Å, $\mathrm{EW}_\mathrm{[O\ III] + H\beta,rest} = 2244$ Å). However, hot H II region temperatures, collisionally-enhanced two-photon continuum emission, and strong UV lines are expected to accompany top-heavy star formation. Thus nebular-dominated galaxies do not necessarily exhibit the biggest Balmer jumps, nor the largest $\xi_\mathrm{ion, obs}$ or reddest UV slopes. Hence continuum spectroscopy is ultimately required to establish the presence of a two-photon downturn in our candidates, thus advancing our understanding of primordial star formation and AGN.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar feedback drives winds and outflows critical to the baryon cycles of low-mass galaxies whose shallow gravitational potential wells make them particularly susceptible to mass and metal loss through outflows. However, spatially resolved observations of stellar-feedback-driven outflows are limited due to their low-surface brightness and transient nature. We present the pilot of a larger multi-wavelength study searching for and quantifying stellar-feedback-driven winds and outflows on both spatially and globally resolved scales for a sample of 40 nearby low-mass galaxies. We search for outflow signatures in the star-forming dwarf galaxy NGC 3741 using new optical imaging and spectroscopy from the WIYN 3.5m telescope in conjunction with VLA 21cm observations and local star formation histories derived from resolved HST photometry. With this extensive dataset, we compare the neutral and ionized gas morphologies and kinematics, calculate mass-loading factors, and investigate spatial variations in the star formation history of NGC 3741. Though the galaxy is experiencing a burst in star formation, we find little evidence of strong outflows and calculate very low mass-loading factors. We suggest that, though star formation activity has increased dramatically in the central region of the galaxy over the last 40 Myr, the star formation rate is not high enough to produce a sufficient amount of high mass stars responsible for fueling outflows. Future analysis of the larger sample will allow us to explore how stellar feedback impacts mass loss on local scales, providing a deeper understanding of the interplay between stellar feedback and the interstellar medium in low-mass galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy mergers are transformative events that can cause gaseous inflows capable of triggering active galactic nuclei (AGN). Previous studies of AGN in simulations have mainly focused on major interactions (i.e. between approximately equal mass galaxies), which produce the strongest inflows and, therefore, would be the most likely to trigger AGN activity. However, minor interactions are far more common and may still enhance accretion onto supermassive black holes. We present an analysis of post-merger galaxies from the IllustrisTNG simulation with stellar mass ratios of $\mu>$1:100. We select post-mergers from the TNG50-1 simulation, from redshifts $0\leq z< 1$, with stellar masses greater than $10^{10}M_{\odot}$. We find an AGN excess in post-mergers with a stellar mass ratio as low as 1:40. The AGN excess is mass ratio and luminosity dependent, with 1.2-1.6 times more AGN found in post-mergers of 1:40$\leq \mu < $1:4 than in matched non-merger controls, and as many as 6 times more AGN found in major $\mu \geq$1:4 post-mergers. The AGN excess is long lived, between 500 Myr to 1 Gyr post-coalescence, across all of the mass ratio regimes. We demonstrate that the most luminous AGN in the simulation overwhelmingly occur in either post-mergers or pairs (with $\mu \geq $1:40). Finally, we demonstrate that mini mergers are likely to be overlooked in observational studies due to the weakness of features usually associated with recent merger activity, such as tidal streams and shells, making it challenging to completely account for merger-induced AGN activity even in deep galaxy surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we present extended gas kinematic maps of the Perseus cluster by combining five new XRISM/Resolve pointings observed in 2025 with four Performance Verification datasets from 2024, totaling 745 ks net exposure. To date, Perseus remains the only cluster that has been extensively mapped out to ~0.7$r_{2500}$ by XRISM/Resolve, while simultaneously offering sufficient spatial resolution to resolve gaseous substructures driven by mergers and AGN feedback. Our observations cover multiple radial directions and a broad dynamical range, enabling us to characterize the intracluster medium kinematics up to the scale of ~500 kpc. In the measurements, we detect high velocity dispersions ($\simeq$300 km/s) in the eastern region of the cluster, corresponding to a nonthermal pressure fraction of $\simeq$7-13%. The velocity field outside the AGN-dominant region can be effectively described by a single, large-scale kinematic driver based on the velocity structure function, which statistically favors an energy injection scale of at least a few hundred kpc. The estimated turbulent dissipation energy is comparable to the gravitational potential energy released by a recent merger, implying a significant role of turbulent cascade in the merger energy conversion. In the bulk velocity field, we observe a dipole-like pattern along the east-west direction with an amplitude of $\simeq\pm$200-300 km/s, indicating rotational motions induced by the recent merger event. This feature constrains the viewing direction to ~30$^\circ$-50$^\circ$ relative to the normal of the merger plane. Our hydrodynamic simulations suggest that Perseus has experienced at least two energetic mergers since redshift z~1, the latest associated with the radio galaxy IC310. This study showcases exciting scientific opportunities for future missions with high-resolution spectroscopic capabilities (e.g., HUBS, LEM, and NewAthena).
