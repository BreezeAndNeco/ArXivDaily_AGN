 - **Abstract**
 Weak gravitational lensing (WL) convergence peaks contain valuable cosmological information in the regime of non-linear collapse. Using the FLAMINGO suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, we study the physical origin and redshift distributions of the objects generating WL peaks selected from a WL convergence map mimicking a $\textit{Euclid}$ signal. We match peaks to individual haloes and show that the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR$~>~5$) WL peaks measured by Stage IV WL surveys primarily trace $M_{\mathrm{200c}} > 10^{14}~\mathrm{M_\odot}$ haloes. We find that the WL peak sample can compete with the purity and completeness of state-of-the-art X-ray and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich cluster abundance inferences. By comparing the distributions predicted by simulation variations that have been calibrated to the observed gas fractions of local clusters and the present-day galaxy stellar mass function, or shifted versions of these, we illustrate that the shape of the redshift distribution of SNR$~>~5$ peaks is insensitive to baryonic physics while it does change with cosmology. The difference highlights the potential of using WL peaks to constrain cosmology. As the number density of WL peaks scales differently with cosmology and baryonic feedback, WL peak statistics can simultaneously calibrate baryonic feedback and constrain cosmology.

 - **Abstract**
 At the core of the Gaia mission is a multi-epoch survey consisting of astrometric, photometric, spectrophotometric, and spectroscopic measurements. The astrometric time series provides parallaxes and proper motions, along with information on astrometric binary systems. The photometric time series offers a means to investigate the variability of the sources. Due to their whole-sky, multi-epoch nature, multiple instruments, their magnitude range covering 21 magnitudes, and their remarkable photometric precision, these data allow us to describe the variability of celestial phenomena in an unprecedented manner. For the third Gaia Data Release (DR3), the data collection spanned 34 months, with a median number of field-of-view measurements in the G band of about 44, reaching up to 270. At publication time, DR3 delivered the largest collection of variable sources with an associated classification across the entire sky. All these sources have their $G$, $G_{BP}$, $G_{RP}$ epoch data published and accessible in the Gaia ESA archive. In summary, there are 10.5 million variable sources, including 9.5 million variable stars and 1 million QSOs. Additionally, 2.5 million galaxies were identified thanks to spurious variability caused by the non-axisymmetric nature of galaxies and the way Gaia collects data. Moreover, all the epoch data and time series of nearly 1.3 million sources in a pencil beam around the Andromeda galaxy are published, regardless of their status (constant or variable); This dataset is known as the Gaia Andromeda Photometric Survey. We also introduce the citizen science project, GaiaVari to classify variable stars, the Focused Product Release delivered on October 10, 2023. In the future, DR4 will cover 66 months, and we hope DR5 will have accumulated 10.5 years of data.

 - **Abstract**
 The high angular resolution and sensitivity of Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) offer a unique tool to identify and study active galactic nuclei and star-formation activity over cosmic time. However, despite recent technical advances, such as multiple phase centre correlation, VLBI surveys have thus far been limited to either a few well-studied deep-fields or wide-areas to a relatively shallow depth. To enter the era of extensive statistical studies at high angular resolution, a significantly larger area of the sky must be observed to much better sensitivity with VLBI. The Synoptic Wide-field EVN--e-MERLIN Public Survey (SWEEPS) is a proposed commensal observing mode for the EVN and e-MERLIN, where single-target principle investigator-led observations are re-correlated at the position of known radio sources within 12 arcmin of the pointing centre. Here, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept of this methodology by detecting a 5.6 mJy core-jet object at 1.7 GHz that would have otherwise been lost from the parent data set. This is the first object to be recovered as part of the SWEEPS pilot programme, which highlights the potential for increasing sample sizes of VLBI-detected radio sources with commensal observing modes in the near future.
#### GA-NIFS: The highly overdense system BR1202-0725 at z $\sim$ 4.7. A double AGN with fast outflows plus eight companion galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 Distant quasars (QSOs) in galaxy overdensities are considered key actors in the evolution of the early Universe. In this work, we studied the kinematic and physical properties of the BR1202-0725 system at z=4.7, one of the most overdense fields known in the early Universe, consisting of a QSO, a submillimeter galaxy (SMG), and three Lyman-$\alpha$ emitters. We used data from the JWST/NIRSpec Integral Field Unit (IFU) to analyze the rest-frame optical emission of each source in the system. We estimated a bolometric luminosity of log($L_{\rm bol}/$[erg/s]) = 47.2 $\pm$ 0.4 and a black hole mass of log($M_{\rm BH}/M_\odot$) = 10.1 $\pm$ 0.5 for the QSO, which are consistent with previous measurements obtained with ground-based observations. The NIRSpec spectra of the SMG revealed instead unexpected [OIII] and H$\alpha$+[NII] profiles. The overall [OIII] line profile is blue-shifted by more than 700 km/s relative to the systemic velocity of the galaxy. Additionally, both the [OIII] and H$\alpha$+[NII] lines show prominent broad (1300 km/s), blueshifted wings associated with outflowing ionized gas. The analysis of NIRSpec and X-ray observations indicates that the SMG likely hosts an accreting supermassive black hole as supported by the following results: (i) the excitation diagnostic diagram is consistent with ionization from an active galactic nucleus (AGN); (ii) the X-ray luminosity is higher than $10^{44}$ erg/s; and (iii) it hosts a fast outflow ($v_{\rm out}$ = 5000 km/s), comparable to those observed in luminous QSOs. Therefore, the QSO-SMG pair represents one of the highest-redshift double AGN to date, with a projected separation of 24 kpc. Finally, we investigated the environment of this system and found four new galaxies at the same redshift of the QSO and within a projected distance of 5 kpc from it. This overdense system includes at least ten galaxies in only 980 kpc$^2$.

 - **Abstract**
 Accretion-induced collapse (AIC) or merger-induced collapse (MIC) of white dwarfs (WDs) in binary systems is an interesting path to neutron star (NS) and magnetar formation, alternative to stellar core collapse and NS mergers. Such events could add a population of compact remnants in globular clusters, they are expected to produce yet unidentified electromagnetic transients including gamma-ray and radio bursts, and to act as sources of trans-iron elements, neutrinos, and gravitational waves. Here we present the first long-term (>5 s post bounce) hydrodynamical simulations in axi-symmetry (2D), using energy- and velocity-dependent three-flavor neutrino transport based on a two-moment scheme. Our set of six models includes initial WD configurations for different masses, central densities, rotation rates, and angular momentum profiles. Our simulations demonstrate that rotation plays a crucial role for the proto-neutron star (PNS) evolution and ejecta properties. We find early neutron-rich ejecta and an increasingly proton-rich neutrino-driven wind at later times in a non-rotating model, in agreement with electron-capture supernova models. In contrast to that and different from previous results, our rotating models eject proton-rich material initially and increasingly more neutron-rich matter as time advances, because an extended accretion torus forms around the PNS and feeds neutrino-driven bipolar outflows for many seconds. AIC and MIC events are thus potential sites of r-process element production, which may imply constraints on their occurrence rates. Finally, our simulations neglect the effects of triaxial deformation and magnetic fields, serving as a temporary benchmark for more comprehensive future studies.

 - **Abstract**
 Gaia has revealed a clear signal of disequilibrium in the solar neighborhood in the form of a spiral (or snail) feature in the vertical phase-space distribution. We investigate the possibility that this structure emerges from ongoing perturbations by dark $\left(10^{6} M_{\odot} - 10^8 M_{\odot}\right)$ Galactic subhalos. We develop a probabilistic model for generating subhalo orbits based on a semi-analytic model of structure formation, and combine this framework with an approximate prescription for calculating the response of the disk to external perturbations. We also develop a phenomenological treatment for the diffusion of phase-space spirals caused by gravitational scattering between stars and giant molecular clouds, a process that erases the kinematic signatures of old ($t \gtrsim 0.6$ Gyr) events. Perturbations caused by dark subhalos are, on average, orders of magnitude weaker than those caused by luminous satellite galaxies, but the ubiquity of dark halos predicted by cold dark matter makes them a more probable source of strong perturbation to the dynamics of the solar neighborhood. Dark subhalos alone do not cause enough disturbance to explain the Gaia snail, but they excite fluctuations of $\sim 0.1-0.5 \ \rm{km} \ \rm{s^{-1}}$ in the mean vertical velocity of stars near the Galactic midplane that should persist to the present day. Subhalos also produce correlations between vertical frequency and orbital angle that could be mistaken as originating from a single past disturbance. Our results motivate investigation of the Milky Way's dark satellites by characterizing their kinematic signatures in phase-space spirals across the Galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent James Webb Space Telescope observations have unveiled that the first supermassive black holes (SMBHs) were in place at z $\geq$ 10, a few hundred Myrs after the Big Bang. These discoveries are providing strong constraints on the seeding of BHs and the nature of the first objects in the Universe. Here, we study the impact of the freeze-out electron fractions ($f_e$) at the end of the epoch of cosmic recombination on the formation of the first structures in the Universe. At $f_e$ below the current fiducial cosmic values of $\rm \sim 10^{-4}$, the baryonic collapse is delayed due to the lack of molecular hydrogen cooling until the host halo masses are increased by one to two orders of magnitude compared to the standard case and reach the atomic cooling limit. This results in an enhanced enclosed gas mass by more than an order of magnitude and higher inflow rates of up to $0.1~M_{\odot}/{yr}$. Such conditions are conducive to the formation of massive seed BHs with $\sim 10^{4}$ M$_{\odot}$. Our results reveal a new pathway for the formation of massive BH seeds which may naturally arise from free
#### The importance of gas starvation in driving satellite quenching in galaxy groups at $z\sim 0.8$

 - **Abstract**
 We present results from a Keck/DEIMOS survey to study satellite quenching in group environments at $z \sim 0.8$ within the Extended Groth Strip (EGS). We target $11$ groups in the EGS with extended X-ray emission. We obtain high-quality spectroscopic redshifts for group member candidates, extending to depths over an order of magnitude fainter than existing DEEP2/DEEP3 spectroscopy. This depth enables the first spectroscopic measurement of the satellite quiescent fraction down to stellar masses of $\sim 10^{9.5}~{\rm M}_{\odot}$ at this redshift. By combining an infall-based environmental quenching model, constrained by the observed quiescent fractions, with infall histories of simulated groups from the IllustrisTNG100-1-Dark simulation, we estimate environmental quenching timescales ($\tau_{\mathrm{quench}}$) for the observed group population. At high stellar masses (${M}_{\star}=10^{10.5}~{\rm M}_{\odot}$) we find that $\tau_{\mathrm{quench}} = 2.4\substack{+0.2 \\ -0.2}$ Gyr, which is consistent with previous estimates at this epoch. At lower stellar masses (${M}_{\star}=10^{9.5}~{\rm M}_{\odot}$), we find that $\tau_{\mathrm{quench}}=3.1\substack{+0.5 \\ -0.4}$ Gyr, which is shorter than prior estimates from photometry-based investigations. These timescales are consistent with satellite quenching via starvation, provided the hot gas envelope of infalling satellites is not stripped away. We find that the evolution in the quenching timescale between $0 \lt z \lt 1$ aligns with the evolution in the dynamical time of the host halo and the total cold gas depletion time. This suggests that the doubling of the quenching timescale in groups since $z\sim1$ could be related to the dynamical evolution of groups or a decrease in quenching efficiency via starvation with decreasing redshift.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultraviolet absorption line spectroscopy is a sensitive diagnostic for the properties of interstellar and circumgalactic gas. Down-the-barrel observations, where the absorption is measured against the galaxy itself, are commonly used to study feedback from galactic outflows and to make predictions about the leakage of HI ionizing photons into the intergalactic medium. Nonetheless, the interpretation of these observations is challenging and observational compromises are often made in terms of signal-to-noise, spectral resolution, or the use of stacking analyses. In this paper, we present a novel quantitative assessment of UV absorption line measurement techniques by using mock observations of a hydrodynamical simulation. We use a simulated galaxy to create 22,500 spectra in the commonly used SiII lines while also modeling the signal-to-noise and spectral resolution of recent rest-frame UV galaxy surveys at both high and low redshifts. We show that the residual flux of absorption features is easily overestimated for single line measurements and for stacked spectra. Additionally, we explore the robustness of the partial covering model for estimating column densities from spectra and find under-predictions on average of 1.25 dex. We show that the under-prediction is likely caused by high-column-density sight-lines that are optically-thick to dust making them invisible in UV spectra.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy mergers have been shown to trigger AGN in the nearby universe, but the timescale over which this process happens remains unconstrained. The Multi-Model Merger Identifier (MUMMI) machine vision pipeline has been demonstrated to provide reliable predictions of time post-merger (T_PM) for galaxies selected from the Ultraviolet Near Infrared and Optical Northern Survey (UNIONS) up to T_PM=1.76 Gyr after coalescence. By combining the post-mergers identified in UNIONS with pre-coalescence galaxy pairs, we can study the triggering of AGN throughout the merger sequence. AGN are identified using a range of complementary metrics: mid-IR colours, narrow emission lines and broad emission lines, which can be combined to provide insight into the demographics of dust and luminosity of the AGN population. Our main results are: 1) Regardless of the metric used, we find that the peak AGN excess (compared with a matched control sample) occurs immediately after coalescence, at 0 < T_PM < 0.16 Gyr. 2) The excess of AGN is observed until long after coalescence; both the mid-IR selected AGN and broad line AGN are more common than in the control sample even in the longest time bin of our sample (0.96 < T_PM < 1.76 Gyr). 3) The AGN excess is larger for more luminous and bolometrically dominant AGN, and we find that AGN in post-mergers are generally more luminous than secularly triggered events. 4) A deficit of broad line AGN in the pre-merger phase, that evolves into an excess in post-mergers is consistent with evolution of the covering fraction of nuclear obscuring material. Before coalescence, tidally triggered inflows increase the covering fraction of nuclear dust; in the post-merger regime feedback from the AGN clears (at least some of) this material. 5) The statistical peak in the triggering of starbursts occurs contemporaneously with AGN, within 0.16 Gyr of coalescence.
#### Environmental Evidence for Overly Massive Black Holes in Low Mass Galaxies and a Black Hole - Halo Mass Relation at $z \sim 5$

 - **Abstract**
 JWST observations have unveiled faint active galactic nuclei (AGN) at high-redshift that provide insights on the formation of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their coevolution with galaxies. However, disentangling stellar from AGN light in these sources is challenging. Here, we use an empirical approach to infer the average stellar mass of 6 faint broad line (BL) Halpha emitters at z = 4 - 5 with BH masses ~ 6 (4 - 15)x10^6 Msun, with a method independent of their spectral energy distribution (SED). We use the deep JWST/NIRcam grism survey ALT to measure the over-densities around BL-Halpha emitters and around a spectroscopic reference sample of ~300 galaxies. In our reference sample, we find that Mpc-scale over-density correlates with stellar mass, while pair counts are flat below ~50 kpc due to satellites. Their large-scale environments suggest that BL-Halpha emitters are hosted by galaxies with stellar masses ~5x10^7 Msun, ~40 times lower than those inferred from galaxy-only SED fits. Adding measurements around more luminous z~6 AGNs, we find tentative correlations between line width, BH mass and the over-density, suggestive of a steep BH to halo mass relation. The main implications are (1) when BH masses are taken at face value, we confirm extremely high BH to stellar mass ratios of ~10 %, (2) the low stellar mass galaxies hosting growing SMBHs are in tension with typical hydrodynamical simulations, except those without feedback, (3) a 1 % duty cycle implied by the host mass hints at super-Eddington accretion, which may imply over-estimated SMBH masses, (4) the masses are at odds with a high stellar density interpretation of the line broadening, (5) our results imply a diversity of galaxy masses, environments and SEDs among AGN samples, depending on their luminosity.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent multi-wavelength observations have highlighted magnetars as significant sources of cosmic rays, particularly through their gamma-ray emissions. This study examines three magnetar regions - CXOU J171405.7-31031, Swift J1834-0846, and SGR 1806-20 - known for emitting detectable electromagnetic signals. We assess the detectability of these regions using the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) by conducting an ON/OFF spectral analysis and compare the expected results with existing observations. Our findings indicate that CTAO will detect gamma-ray emissions from these three magnetar regions with significantly reduced emission flux errors compared to current instruments. In special, the study shows that the CXOUJ1714-3810 and SwiftJ1834-0846 magnetar regions can be observed by the full southern and northern CTAO arrays in just five hours of observation, with mean significances above $10 \,\sigma$ and $30 \,\sigma$, respectively. This paper discusses the regions analyzed, presents key results, and concludes with insights drawn from the study.

 - **Abstract**
 We report integral field spectroscopy observations with the Near-Infrared Spectrograph on board JWST targeting the 60 kpc environment surrounding the most luminous quasar known at $z=4.6$. We detect ionized gas filaments on 40 kpc scales connecting a network of merging galaxies likely to form a cluster. We find regions of low ionization consistent with large-scale shock excitation surrounding the central dust-obscured quasar, out to distances nearly eight times the effective stellar radius of the quasar host galaxy. In the nuclear region, we find an ionized outflow driven by the quasar with velocities reaching 13,000 km s$^{-1}$, one of the fastest discovered to date with an outflow rate of 2000 M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ and a kinetic luminosity of 6$\times10^{46}$ erg s$^{-1}$ resulting in coupling efficiency between the bolometric luminosity of the quasar and the outflow of 5%. The kinetic luminosity of the outflow is sufficient to power the turbulent motion of the gas on galactic and circumgalactic scales and is likely the primary driver of the radiative shocks on interstellar medium and circumgalactic medium scales. This provides compelling evidence supporting long-standing theoretical predictions that powerful quasar outflows are a main driver in regulating the heating and accretion rate of gas onto massive central cluster galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 Atomic hydrogen (HI) is a vital player in the star-formation process in galaxies. It is the raw fuel for making molecules, an important shielding agent against interstellar radiation, and a buffer that soaks up the energy and momentum of stellar feedback. While for many years detailed studies of the HI thermal structure have been possible only in the Milky Way, the SKA pathfinders are expanding our view beyond the Solar neighborhood allowing for crucial tests of the HI heating and cooling processes under a wide range of physical conditions. This overview article highlights a few recent results and emphasizes areas where future observations can make large contributions. We show that the cold HI disk of the Milky Way is extended and flared, yet appears spatially coupled to the molecular gas. The cold neutral medium (CNM) in the Milky Way is colder and more abundant at higher optical extinctions due to more intense cooling and shielding. A comparison between the Milky Way, the Small Magellanic Cloud, the Large Magellanic Cloud and NGC 6822 shows a good agreement with predictions from recent numerical simulations on how the CNM fraction depends on metalliciity. The fraction and spatial distribution of the thermally unstable HI remain as open questions and observationally have not been studied beyond the Milky Way. The excitation temperature of the warm neutral medium (WNM) is not well understood. Observations suggest higher WNM temperatures than what is seen in numerical simulations. The SKA, once operational, will take the HI studies into a new era of dense HI absorption grids for the Milky Way and nearby galaxies, and the ability to study the HI thermal structure beyond the Local Group.

 - **Abstract**
 Works on the energy extraction from a rotating black hole via magnetic reconnection attract more attentions in recent years. Discussions on this topic, however, are often based on many simplifications, such as assuming a circularly flowing bulk plasma and a fixed orientation angle. A significant gap remains between theoretical models and the magnetic reconnection occurring in real astrophysical scenarios. In our previous work, we investigated the influence of orientation angle on energy extraction and figured out the differences between the plunging and circularly flowing bulk plasma. We introduced the concept of covering factor to quantify the capability of an accretion system in extracting energy via magnetic reconnection from a rotating black hole. In this work, as an improvement, we extend our discussions by treating the parameters in reconnection models as free parameters, bringing the theoretical model closer to the situations in real astrophysical systems. We employ two reconnection models, in which the geometric index and the guide field fraction are respectively induced. We separately present the dependences of energy extraction on the geometric index and the guide field fraction. More importantly, we propose to define the averaged covering factor weighted by reconnection rate to quantify the overall capability of an accretion system in extracting energy via magnetic reconnection from a rotating black hole, under the assumption that the magnetic reconnection process occurs stochastically and randomly within the ergosphere.

NinjaSat is capable of pointing at X-ray sources with an accuracy of less than $0^{\circ}\hspace{-1.0mm}.1$ (2$\sigma$ confidence level) with 3-axis attitude control. The satellite bus is a commercially available NanoAvionics M6P, equipped with two non-imaging gas X-ray detectors covering an energy range of 2-50 keV. A total effective area of 32 cm$^2$ at 6 keV is capable of observing X-ray sources with a flux of approximately 10$^{-10}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. The arrival time of each photon can be tagged with a time resolution of 61 $\mu$s. The two radiation belt monitors continuously measure the fluxes of protons above 5 MeV and electrons above 200 keV trapped in the geomagnetic field, alerting the X-ray detectors when the flux exceeds a threshold. The NinjaSat project started in 2020. Fabrication of the scientific payloads was completed in August 2022, and satellite integration and tests were completed in July 2023. NinjaSat was launched into a Sun-synchronous polar orbit at an altitude of about 530 km on 2023 November 11 by the SpaceX Transporter-9 mission. After about three months of satellite commissioning and payload verification, we observed the Crab Nebula on February 9, 2024, and successfully detected the 33.8262 ms pulsation from the neutron star. With this observation, NinjaSat met the minimum success criterion and stepped forward to scientific observations as initially planned. By the end of November 2024, we successfully observed 21 X-ray sources using NinjaSat. This achievement demonstrates that, with careful target selection, we can conduct scientific observations effectively using CubeSats, contributing to time-domain astronomy.

 - **Abstract**
 Density estimation is a fundamental problem that arises in many areas of astronomy, with applications ranging from selecting quasars using color distributions to characterizing stellar abundances. Astronomical observations are inevitably noisy; however, the density of a noise-free feature is often the desired outcome. The extreme-deconvolution (XD) method can be used to deconvolve the noise and obtain noise-free density estimates by fitting a mixture of Gaussians to data where each sample has non-identical (heteroscedastic) Gaussian noise. However, XD does not generalize to cases where some feature dimensions have highly non-Gaussian distribution, and no established method exists to overcome this limitation. We introduce a possible solution using neural networks to perform Gaussian mixture modeling of the Gaussian-like dimensions conditioned on those non-Gaussian features. The result is the CondXD algorithm, a generalization of XD that performs noise-free conditional density estimation. We apply CondXD to a toy model and find that it is more accurate than other approaches. We further test our method on a real-world high redshift quasar versus contaminant classification problem. Specifically, we estimate noise-free densities in flux-ratio (i.e., color) space for contaminants, conditioned on their magnitude. Our results are comparable to the existing method, which divides the samples into magnitude bins and applies XD separately in each bin, and our method is approximately ten times faster. Overall, our method has the potential to significantly improve estimating conditional densities and enable new discoveries in astronomy.

 - **Abstract**
 Low-frequency radio emission from the Large Magellanic Cloud~(LMC) is assumed to be dominated by nonthermal synchrotron radiation from energy loss of energetic $e^+/e^-$ in magnetic field. Two different kinds of sources of $e^+/e^-$, dark matter~(DM) annihilation and cosmic rays~(CR) related to massive stars, are taken into account in this paper. We fit the multiple low-frequency radio observations, from 19.7 MHz to 1.4 GHz, with a double power-law model $S_{nth} =S_{DM}(\frac {\nu}{\nu_{\star}})^{-\alpha_{DM}}+S_{CR}( \frac {\nu}{\nu_{\star}})^{-\alpha_{CR}} $. $\nu_{\star}$ is set to be $1.4$ GHz and $S_{CR}$ could be determined from the 24 $\mu m$ luminosity based on the global radio-infrared correlation. Our best fit with a fixed $\alpha_{CR}$ changing from $0.80$ to $0.55$ yields $\alpha_{DM}$ ranging from $0.21$ to $0.66$. Given a fixed value of $\alpha_{CR}$, we derive the upper limits of synchrotron emission induced by dark matter annihilation at different radio frequencies. Larger value of $\alpha_{CR}$ represents for a harder $e^+/e^-$ spectrum from cosmic rays, which leads to a smaller value of $\alpha_{DM}$ and allow less synchrotron emission resulted from dark matter annihilation in lower frequency. Under the same assumption on the magnetic field, we find that the lower the frequency, the stronger the restriction on DM parameter space. Meanwhile, as the peak frequency of synchrotron radiation decrease with the energy of $e^+/e^-$, constraints on DM properties obtained from lower frequency are more severe in the case of DM with lower mass. Future low-frequency radio survey should be considered a promising and powerful way to constrain DM.

 - **Abstract**
 Quiet-Sun Ellerman bombs (QSEBs) are small-scale magnetic reconnection events in the lower atmosphere of the quiet Sun. Recent work has shown that a small percentage of them can occur co-spatially and co-temporally to ultraviolet (UV) brightenings in the transition region. We aim to understand how the magnetic topologies associated with closely occurring QSEBs and UV brightenings can facilitate energy transport and connect these events. We used high-resolution H-beta observations from the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST) and detected QSEBs using k-means clustering. We obtained the magnetic field topology from potential field extrapolations using spectro-polarimetric data in the photospheric Fe I 6173 A line. To detect UV brightenings, we used coordinated and co-aligned data from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) and imposed a threshold of 5 sigma above the median background on the (IRIS) 1400 A slit-jaw image channel. We identify four distinct magnetic configurations that associate QSEBs with UV brightenings, including a simple dipole configuration and more complex fan-spine topologies with a three-dimensional (3D) magnetic null point. In the fan-spine topology, the UV brightenings occur near the 3D null point, while QSEBs can be found close to the footpoints of the outer spine, the inner spine, and the fan surface. We find that the height of the 3D null varies between 0.2 Mm to 2.6 Mm, depending on the magnetic field strength in the region. We note that some QSEBs and UV brightenings, though occurring close to each other, are not topologically connected with the same reconnection process. We find that the energy released during QSEBs falls in the range of 10^23 to 10^24 ergs. This study shows that magnetic connectivity and topological features, like 3D null points, are crucial in linking QSEBs in the lower atmosphere with UV brightenings in the transition region.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first multi-band centimeter detection of POX 52, a nearby dwarf galaxy believed to habor a robust intermediate mass black hole (IMBH). We conducted the deep observations using the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA), spanning frequencies from 4.5 to 10 GHz, as well as the sensitive observations from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) operating in its most extended A-configuration at S band (2--4 GHz) and C band (4--8 GHz). In the ATCA observations, the source shows a compact morphology, with only one direction marginally resolved. The higher resolution of the VLA allowed us to slightly resolve the source, fitting it well with a two-dimensional Gaussian model. The detected radio emission confirms the presence of Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) activity, indicating either a low-power jet or AGN-driven winds/outflows. Our dual-epoch observations with ATCA and VLA, together with previous non-detection flux density upper limits, reveal radio emission variability spanning two decades. In addition, we find that POX 52 aligns well with the low-mass extension of the fundamental plane for high-accretion, radio-quiet massive AGNs.

 - **Abstract**
 Surveillance of objects in the cislunar domain is challenging due primarily to the large distances (10x the Geosynchronous orbit radius) and total volume of space to be covered. Ground-based electro-optical observations are further hindered by high background levels due to scattered moonlight. In this paper, we report on ground-based demonstrations of space surveillance for targets in the cislunar domain exploiting the remarkable performance of 36cm, F2.2 class telescopes equipped with current generation, back-side illuminated, full-frame CMOS imager. The demonstrations leverage advantageous viewing conditions for the Artemis Orion vehicle during its return to earth, and the total lunar eclipse of November 8th 2022 for viewing the CAPSTONE vehicle. Estimated g-band magnitudes for vehicles were 19.57 at a range of 4.4e5 km and 15.53 at a range of 3.2e5 km for CAPSTONE and Artemis Orion, respectively. In addition to observations, we present reflectance signature modeling implemented in the LunaTK space-sensing simulation framework and compare calculated apparent magnitudes to observed. Design of RApid Telescopes for Optical Response (RAPTOR) instruments, observing campaigns of Artemis Orion and CAPSTONE missions, and initial comparisons to electro-optical modeling are reviewed.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the rest-frame ultraviolet-optical color gradients of 669 galaxies at $4<z<8$ by characterizing the wavelength dependence of their structural parameters derived from simultaneously fitting the seven-band NIRCam images acquired with the James Webb Space Telescope. Distinct from trends observed at lower redshifts, where most galaxies exhibit negative color gradients whereby galaxy centers are redder than their outskirts, in high-redshift galaxies positive color gradients match or even outnumber negative color gradients. The color gradients principally reflect radial variations in stellar population instead of dust reddening or contamination from active galactic nuclei. The sign and magnitude of the color profile depend systematically on the global properties of the galaxy: positive color gradients, characteristic of centrally concentrated star formation or outside-in growth, preferentially inhabit galaxies of lower stellar mass, smaller size, and bluer spectral energy distribution.

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of black hole (BH) spins remains one of the least understood aspects of BHs. Despite many uncertainties, it is commonly assumed that if BHs originated from isolated massive star binaries, their spins should be aligned with the orbital angular momentum of the binary system. This assumption stems from the notion that BHs inherit their spins from their progenitor stars. In this study, we relax this long-held viewpoint and explore various mechanisms that can spin up BHs before or during their formation. In addition to natal spins, we discuss physical processes that can spin BHs isotropically, parallel to natal kicks, and perpendicular to natal kicks. These different mechanisms leave behind distinct imprints on the observable distributions of spin magnitudes, spin-orbit misalignments and the effective inspiral spin of merging binaries. In particular, these mechanisms allow even the binaries originating in the field to exhibit precession and retrograde spin ($\chi_{\rm eff}<0$). This broadens the parameter space allowed for isolated binary evolution into regimes which were previously thought to be exclusive to dynamically assembled binaries.

 - **Abstract**
 The occurrence frequency distributions of fluxes (F) and fluences or energies (E) observed in astrophysical observations are found to be consistent with the predictions of the fractal-diffusive self-organized criticality (FD-SOC) model, which predicts power law slopes with universal constants of $\alpha_F=(9/5)=1.80$ for the flux and $\alpha_E=(5/3)\approx 1.67$ for the fluence. The energy integrated over the power law-like (size distribution) energy range is found to be finite for these power law slopes with $\alpha_E < 2$, which refutes earlier claims of a divergent energy integral that has been postulated in the energy budget of solar and stellar nanoflare scenarios. The theoretial FD-SOC model approximates the microscopic cellular automaton models satisfactorily with the macroscopic scaling law of classical diffusion. The universal scaling laws predict the size distributions of numerous astrophysical phenomena, such as solar flares, stellar flares, coronal mass ejections (CME), auroras, blazars, galactic fast radio bursts (FRB), active galactic nuclei (AGN), gamma-ray bursts (GRB), soft gamma-ray repeaters (SGB), and black-hole systems (BH), while coherent solar radio bursts, random radio bursts, solar energetic partices (SEP), cosmic rays, and pulsar glitches require non-standard SOC models.

 - **Abstract**
 Black hole accretion in active galactic nuclei (AGN) is coupled to the evolution of their host galaxies. Outflowing winds in AGN can play an important role in this evolution through the resulting feedback mechanism. Multi-wavelength spectroscopy is key for probing the intertwined physics of inflows and outflows in AGN. However, with the current spectrometers, crucial properties of the ionized outflows are poorly understood, such as their coupling to the accretion rate, their launching mechanism, and their kinetic power. In this paper we discuss the need for simultaneous X-ray and UV high-resolution spectroscopy for tackling outstanding questions on these outflows in AGN. The instrumental requirements for achieving the scientific objectives are addressed. We demonstrate that these requirements would be facilitated by the proposed Arcus Probe mission concept. The multi-wavelength spectroscopy and timing by Arcus would enable us to establish the kinematics and ionization structure of the entire ionized outflow, extending from the vicinity of the accretion disk to the outskirts of the host galaxy. Arcus would provide key diagnostics on the origin, driving mechanism, and the energetics of the outflows, which are useful benchmarks for testing various theoretical models of outflows and understanding their impact in AGN.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic fields, together with cosmic rays (CRs), play an important role in the dynamics and evolution of galaxies, but are difficult to estimate. Energy equipartition between magnetic fields and CRs provides a convenient way to approximate magnetic field strength from radio observations. We present a new approach for calculating the equipartition magnetic field strength based on Bayesian methods. In this approach, the magnetic field is a random variable that is distributed according to a posterior distribution conditional on synchrotron emission and the size of the emitting region. It allows the direct application of the general formulas for total and polarized synchrotron radiation without the need to invert these formulas, which has limited the equipartition method to highly simplified cases. We have derived the equipartition condition for the case of different low-energy breaks, slopes, and high-energy cutoffs of power law spectra of the CR proton and electron distributions. The derived formalism was applied in the general case of a magnetic field consisting of both uniform and randomly oriented field components. The applied Bayesian approach naturally provides the uncertainties in the estimated magnetic field strengths resulting from the uncertainties in the observables and the assumed values of the unknown physical parameters. In the examples presented, we used two different Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods to generate the posterior distribution of the magnetic field. We have also developed a web application called BMAG that implements the described approach for different models and observational parameters of real sources.
#### Energy Dissipation in Strong Collisionless Shocks: The Crucial Role of Ion-to-Electron Scale Separation in Particle-in-Cell Simulations

 - **Abstract**
 Energy dissipation in collisionless shocks is a key mechanism in various astrophysical environments. Its non-linear nature complicates analytical understanding and necessitate Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations. This study examines the impact of reducing the ion-to-electron mass ratio ($m_r$), to decrease computational cost, on energy partitioning in 1D3V (one spatial and three velocity-space dimensions) PIC simulations of strong, non-relativistic, parallel electron-ion collisionless shocks using the SHARP code. We compare simulations with a reduced mass ratio ($m_r = 100$) to those with a realistic mass ratio ($m_r = 1836$) for shocks with high ($\mathcal{M}_A = 21.3$) and low ($\mathcal{M}_A = 5.3$) Alfv$\acute{\text{e}}$n Mach numbers. Our findings show that the mass ratio significantly affects particle acceleration and thermal energy dissipation. At high $\mathcal{M}_A$, a reduced mass ratio leads to more efficient electron acceleration and an unrealistically high ion flux at higher momentum. At low $\mathcal{M}_A$, it causes complete suppression of electron acceleration, whereas the realistic mass ratio enables efficient electron acceleration. The reduced mass ratio also results in excessive electron heating and lower heating in downstream ions at both Mach numbers, with slightly more magnetic field amplification at low $\mathcal{M}_A$. Consequently, the electron-to-ion temperature ratio is high at low $\mathcal{M}_A$ due to reduced ion heating and remains high at high $\mathcal{M}_A$ due to increased electron heating. In contrast, simulations with the realistic $m_r$ show that the ion-to-electron temperature ratio is independent of the upstream magnetic field, a result not observed in reduced $m_r$ simulations.
