 - **Abstract**
 Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations provide valuable insights on galaxy evolution when coupled with observational data. Comparisons with real galaxies are typically performed via scaling relations of model fitting. Here we follow an alternative approach based on the spectral variance in a model-independent way. We build upon the work presented in Sharbaf et al. (2023) that studied the covariance of high quality SDSS continuum-subtracted spectra in a relatively narrow range of velocity dispersion (100-150 km/s). Here the same analysis is applied to synthetic data from the EAGLE and Illustris TNG100 simulations, to assess the ability of these runs to mimic real galaxies. The real and simulated spectra are consistent regarding spectral variance, although with subtle differences that can inform the implementation of subgrid physics. Spectral fitting done a posteriori on stacks segregated with respect to latent space reveals that the first principal component (PC1) is predominantly influenced by the stellar age distribution, with an underlying age-metallicity degeneracy. Good agreement is found regarding star formation prescriptions but there is disagreement with AGN feedback, that also affects the subset of quiescent galaxies. We show a substantial difference in the implementation of the AGN subgrid, regarding central black hole seeding, that could lead to the mismatch. Differences are manifest between these two simulations in the star formation histories stacked with respect to latent space. We emphasise that this methodology only relies on the spectral variance to assess whether simulations provide a true representation of galaxy formation.

 - **Abstract**
 With a growing number of facilities able to monitor the entire sky and produce light curves with a cadence of days, in recent years there has been an increased rate of detection of sources whose variability deviates from standard behavior, revealing a variety of exotic nuclear transients. The aim of the present study is to disentangle the nature of the transient AT 2021hdr, whose optical light curve used to be consistent with a classic Seyfert 1 nucleus, which was also confirmed by its optical spectrum and high-energy properties. From late 2021, AT 2021hdr started to present sudden brightening episodes in the form of oscillating peaks in the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) alert stream, and the same shape is observed in X-rays and UV from Swift data. The oscillations occur every about 60-90 days with amplitudes of around 0.2 mag in the g and r bands. Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations show no radio emission at milliarcseconds scale. It is argued that these findings are inconsistent with a standard tidal disruption event (TDE), a binary supermassive black hole (BSMBH), or a changing-look active galactic nucleus (AGN); neither does this object resemble previous observed AGN flares, and disk or jet instabilities are an unlikely scenario. Here, we propose that the behavior of AT 2021hdr might be due to the tidal disruption of a gas cloud by a BSMBH. In this scenario, we estimate that the putative binary has a separation of about 0.83 mpc and would merge in about 70000 years. This galaxy is located at 9 kpc from a companion galaxy, and in this work we report this merger for the first time. The oscillations are not related to the companion galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 The gas dynamics of galaxies provide critical insights into the evolution of both baryons and dark matter (DM) across cosmic time. In this context, galaxies at cosmic noon -- the period characterized by the most intense star formation and black hole activities -- are particularly significant. In this work, we present an analysis of the gas dynamics of PKS 0529-549: a galaxy at $z\simeq2.6$, hosting a radio-loud active galactic nucleus (AGN). We use new ALMA observations of the [CI] (2-1) line at a spatial resolution of 0.18$''$ ($\sim$1.5 kpc). We find that (1) the molecular gas forms a rotation-supported disk with $V_{\rm rot}/\sigma_{\rm v}=6\pm3$ and displays a flat rotation curve out to 3.3 kpc; (2) there are several non-circular components including a kinematically anomalous structure near the galaxy center, a gas tail to the South-West, and possibly a second weaker tail to the East; (3) dynamical estimates of gas and stellar masses from fitting the rotation curve are inconsistent with photometric estimates using standard gas conversion factors and stellar population models, respectively; these discrepancies may be due to systematic uncertainties in the photometric masses, in the dynamical masses, or in the case a more massive radio-loud AGN-host galaxy is hidden behind the gas-rich [CI] emitting starburst galaxy along the line of sight. Our work shows that in-depth investigations of 3D line cubes are crucial for revealing the complexity of gas dynamics in high-$z$ galaxies, in which regular rotation may coexist with non-circular motions and possibly tidal structures.

 - **Abstract**
 The impact of the dynamical state of gas-rich satellite galaxies at the early moments of their infall into their host systems and the relation to their quenching process are not completely understood at the low-mass regime. Two such nearby systems are the infalling Milky Way (MW) dwarfs Leo~T and Phoenix located near the MW virial radius at $414 {\rm kpc}\,(1.4 R_{\rm vir})$, both of which present intriguing offsets between their gaseous and stellar distributions. Here we present hydrodynamic simulations with {\sc ramses} to reproduce the observed dynamics of Leo~T: its $80{\rm pc}$ stellar-HI offset and the 35{\rm pc} offset between its older ($\gtrsim 5{\rm Gyr}$) and younger ($\sim\!200\!-\!1000{\rm Myr}$) stellar population. We considered internal and environmental properties such as stellar winds, two HI components, cored and cuspy dark matter profiles, and different satellite orbits considering the MW circumgalactic medium. We find that the models that best match the observed morphology of the gas and stars include mild stellar winds that interact with the HI generating the observed offset, and dark matter profiles with extended cores. The latter allow long oscillations of the off-centred younger stellar component, due to long mixing timescales ($\gtrsim200 {\rm Myr}$), and the slow precession of near-closed orbits in the cored potentials; instead, cuspy and compact cored dark matter models result in the rapid mixing of the material ($\lesssim 200{\rm Myr}$). These models predict that non-equilibrium substructures, such as spatial and kinematic offsets, are likely to persist in cored low-mass dwarfs and to remain detectable on long timescales in systems with recent star formation.
#### Challenges in constraining dust properties from starlight polarization

 - **Abstract**
 Dust polarization, which comes from the alignment of aspherical grains to magnetic fields, has been widely employed to study the interstellar medium (ISM) dust properties. The wavelength dependence of the degree of optical polarization, known as the Serkowski relation, was a key observational discovery that advanced grain modeling and alignment theories. However, it was recently shown that line-of-sight (LOS) variations in the structure of the ISM or the magnetic field morphology contaminate the constraints extracted from fits to the Serkowski relation. These cases can be identified by the wavelength-dependent variability in the polarization angles. We aim to investigate the extent to which we can constrain the intrinsic dust properties and alignment efficiency from dust polarization data, by accounting for LOS variations of the magnetic field morphology. We employed archival data to fit the Serkowski relation and constrain its free parameter. We explored potential imprints of LOS variations of the magnetic field morphology in these constraints. We found that these LOS integration effects contaminate the majority of the existing dataset, thus biasing the obtained Serkowski parameters by approximately 10%. The constancy of the polarization angles with wavelength does not necessarily guarantee the absence of 3D averaging effects. We examined the efficiency of dust grains in polarizing starlight, as probed by the ratio of the degree of polarization to dust reddening, E(B-V). We found that all measurements respect the limit established by polarized dust emission data. A suppression in polarization efficiencies occurs at E(B-V) close to 0.5 mag, which we attribute to projection effects and may be unrelated to the intrinsic alignment of dust grains.

 - **Abstract**
 We combine the power of blind integral field spectroscopy from the Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET) Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX) with sources detected by the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) to construct the HETDEX-LOFAR Spectroscopic Redshift Catalog. Starting from the first data release of the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS), including a value-added catalog with photometric redshifts, we extracted 28,705 HETDEX spectra. Using an automatic classifying algorithm, we assigned each object a star, galaxy, or quasar label along with a velocity/redshift, with supplemental classifications coming from the continuum and emission line catalogs of the internal, fourth data release from HETDEX (HDR4). We measured 9,087 new redshifts; in combination with the value-added catalog, our final spectroscopic redshift sample is 9,710 sources. This new catalog contains the highest substantial fraction of LOFAR galaxies with spectroscopic redshift information; it improves archival spectroscopic redshifts, and facilitates research to determine the [O II] emission properties of radio galaxies from $0.0 < z < 0.5$, and the Ly$\alpha$ emission characteristics of both radio galaxies and quasars from $1.9 < z < 3.5$. Additionally, by combining the unique properties of LOFAR and HETDEX, we are able to measure star formation rates (SFR) and stellar masses. Using the Visible Integral-field Replicable Unit Spectrograph (VIRUS), we measure the emission lines of [O III], [Ne III], and [O II] and evaluate line-ratio diagnostics to determine whether the emission from these galaxies is dominated by AGN or star formation and fit a new SFR-L$_{150MHz}$ relationship.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of the Milky Way and external galaxies support the idea that large-scale magnetic fields are concentrated in galactic disks, with halo magnetic fields at least an order of magnitude weaker. However, very little is known about the transition between the two. We present the discovery of linearly polarized radio emission at the interface between interacting shells of gas within a well-known grouping of high-velocity clouds (HVCs), the Anti-Center Shell. Faraday rotation of diffuse emission and of background extragalactic compact sources demonstrates an enhancement of the field at the interface. This is the clearest observed example of an HVC altering the large-scale magnetic field at the disk-halo interface and is the first image of magnetic field effects in an HVC. These results demonstrate the possibility of future three-dimensional reconstruction of the Galactic magnetic field and showcase the versatility of the Synthesis Telescope at the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory as one of the few existing telescopes which can exploit this new method of probing Galactic magnetism.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. A major challenge in astrophysics is classifying galaxies by their activity. Current methods often require multiple diagnostics to capture the full range of galactic activity. Furthermore, overlapping excitation sources with similar observational signatures complicate the analysis of a galaxy's activity. Aims. This study aims to create an activity diagnostic tool that overcomes the limitations of current emission line diagnostics by identifying the underlying excitation mechanisms in mixed-activity galaxies (e.g., star formation, active nucleus, or old stellar populations) and determining the dominant ones. Methods. We use the random forest machine-learning algorithm, trained on three main activity classes -star-forming, AGN, and passive- that represent key gas excitation mechanisms. This diagnostic employs four distinguishing features: the equivalent widths of [O iii] ${\lambda}$5007, [N ii] ${\lambda}$6584, H${\alpha}$, and the D4000 continuum break index. Results. The classifier achieves near-perfect performance, with an overall accuracy of ~ 99% and recall scores of ~ 100% for star-forming, ~ 98% for AGN, and ~ 99% for passive galaxies. These exceptional scores allow for confident decomposition of mixed activity classes into the primary gas excitation mechanisms, overcoming the limitations of current classification methods. Additionally, the classifier can be simplified to a two-dimensional diagnostic using the D4000 index and log$_{10}$(EW([O iii])$^{2}$) without significant loss of diagnostic power. Conclusions. We present a diagnostic for classifying galaxies by their primary gas excitation mechanisms and deconstructing the activity of mixed-activity galaxies into these components. This method covers the full range of galaxy activity. Aditionally, D4000 index serves as an indicator for resolving the degeneracy among various activity components.
#### $S^5$: New insights from deep spectroscopic observations of the tidal tails of the globular clusters NGC 1261 and NGC 1904

 - **Abstract**
 As globular clusters (GCs) orbit the Milky Way, their stars are tidally stripped forming tidal tails that follow the orbit of the clusters around the Galaxy. The morphology of these tails is complex and shows correlations with the phase of the orbit and the orbital angular velocity, especially for GCs on eccentric orbits. Here, we focus on two GCs, NGC 1261 and NGC 1904, that have potentially been accreted alongside Gaia-Enceladus and that have shown signatures of having, in addition of tidal tails, structures formed by distributions of extra-tidal stars that are misaligned with the general direction of the clusters' respective orbits. To provide an explanation for the formation of these structures, we make use of spectroscopic measurements from the Southern Stellar Stream Spectroscopic Survey ($S^5$) as well as proper motion measurements from Gaia's third data release (DR3), and apply a Bayesian mixture modeling approach to isolate high-probability member stars. We recover extra-tidal features similar to those found in Shipp et al. (2018) surrounding each cluster. We conduct N-body simulations and compare the expected distribution and variation in the dynamical parameters along the orbit with those of our potential member sample. Furthermore, we use Dark Energy Camera (DECam) photometry to inspect the distribution of the member stars in the color-magnitude diagram (CMD). We find that the potential members agree reasonably with the N-body simulations and that the majority of them follow a simple stellar population-like distribution in the CMD which is characteristic of GCs. In the case of NGC 1904, we clearly detect the tidal debris escaping the inner and outer Lagrange points which are expected to be prominent when at or close to the apocenter of its orbit. Our analysis allows for further exploration of other GCs in the Milky Way that exhibit similar extra-tidal features.

 - **Abstract**
 The discovery of a second electromagnetic counterpart to a gravitational wave event represents a critical goal in the field of multi-messenger astronomy. In order to determine the optimal strategy for achieving this goal, we perform comprehensive simulations comparing two potential paths forward: continuing the current LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) observing run, O4, versus temporarily shutting down the detectors for upgrades before beginning the next observing run, O5. Our simulations incorporate current O4 instrument sensitivities and duty cycles, as well as projected configurations for O5, while accounting for variables such as binary neutron star merger rates, system properties, viewing angles, dust extinction, and kilonova (KN) observables. Our results indicate that a KN discovery would occur $125^{+253}_{-125}$~days (middle 50\% interval) sooner in O5 compared to O4, suggesting that extending O4 would lead to faster discovery if the shutdown period between runs is $>$4~months. Moreover, for 88\% of our simulations, continuing O4 results in earlier KN discovery when compared to the expected two-year shutdown between O4 and O5. Given these findings and the critical importance of avoiding a $>$10 year gap between first and second electromagnetic counterpart discoveries, we suggest LVK consider extending O4 operations for as long as feasible prior to shutting down for critical upgrades.

 - **Abstract**
 Debris disks embrace the formation and evolution histories of planetary systems. Recent detections of gas in these disks have received considerable attention, as its origin ties up ongoing disk evolution and the present composition of planet-forming materials. Observations of the CO gas alone, however, cannot reliably differentiate between two leading, competing hypotheses: (1) the observed gas is the leftover of protoplanetary disk gas, and (2) the gas is the outcome of collisions between icy bodies. We propose that such differentiation may become possible by observing cold water vapor. Order-of-magnitude analyses and comparison with existing observations are performed. We show that different hypotheses lead to different masses of water vapor. This occurs because, for both hypotheses, the presence of cold water vapor is attributed to photodesorption from dust particles by attenuated interstellar UV radiation. Cold water vapor cannot be observed by current astronomical facilities as most of its emission lines fall in the far-IR (FIR) range. This work highlights the need for a future FIR space observatory to reveal the origin of gas in debris disks and the evolution of planet-forming disks in general.

 - **Abstract**
 As part of the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment Fast Radio Burst (CHIME/FRB) project, we report 41 new Rotation Measures (RMs) from 20 repeating Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) obtained between 2019 and 2023 for which no previous RM was determined. We also report 22 additional RM measurements for eight further repeating FRBs. We observe temporal RM variations in practically all repeating FRBs. Repeaters appear to be separated into two categories: those with dynamic and those with stable RM environments, differentiated by the ratios of RM standard deviations over the averaged RM magnitudes. Sources from stable RM environments likely have little RM contributions from the interstellar medium (ISM) of their host galaxies, whereas sources from dynamic RM environments share some similarities with Galactic pulsars in eclipsing binaries but appear distinct from Galactic centre solitary pulsars. We observe a new stochastic, secular, and again stochastic trend in the temporal RM variation of FRB 20180916B, which does not support binary orbit modulation being the reason for this RM changes. We highlight two more repeaters that show RM sign change, namely FRBs 20290929C and 20190303A. We perform an updated comparison of polarization properties between repeating and non-repeating FRBs, which show a marginal dichotomy in their distribution of electron-density-weighted parallel-component line-of-sight magnetic fields.

 Fainter standard stars are essential for the calibration of larger telescopes. This work adds to the CALSPEC (calibration spectra) database 19 faint white dwarfs (WDs) with all-sky coverage and V magnitudes between 16.5 and 18.7. Included for these stars is new UV (ultraviolet) HST (Hubble Space Telescope) STIS (Space Telescope Imaging Spectrometer) spectrophotometry between 1150 and 3000~Å with a resolution of $\sim$500. Pure hydrogen WD models are fit to these UV spectra and to six-band HST/WFC3 (Wide Field Camera 3) photometry at 0.28 to 1.6~\micron\ to construct predicted model SEDs (spectral energy distributions) covering wavelengths from 900~Å to the JWST (James Webb Space Telescope) limit of 30~\micron\ using well-established CALSPEC procedures for producing flux standards with the goal of 1\% accuracy.
#### Origin of the twice ${90}^{\circ}$ rotations of the polarization angle in GRB 170114A and GRB 160821A

 - **Abstract**
 The observed twice abrupt ${90}^{\circ}$ rotations of the polarization angle (PA) in the prompt phase of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are difficult to be understandable within the current one-emitting-shell models. Here, we apply a model with multiple emitting shells to solve this new challenging problem. Two configurations of large-scale ordered magnetic fields in the shells are considered: toroidal and aligned. Together with the light curves and the spectral peak-energy evolutions, the twice ${90}^{\circ}$ PA rotations in GRB 170114A and GRB 160821A could be well interpreted with the multi-shell aligned magnetic fields configuration. Our numerical calculations also show that the multiple shells with the toroidal magnetic field configuration could not explain the observed twice ${90}^{\circ}$ PA rotations. An aligned magnetic field configuration in the GRB outflow usually indicate to prefer a magnetar central engine, while a toroidal field configuration is typically related to a central black hole. Therefore, the magnetar central engines for the two GRBs are favored.

 - **Abstract**
 We carried out a project involving the systematic analysis of microlensing data from the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network survey. The aim of this project is to identify lensing events with complex anomaly features that are difficult to explain using standard binary-lens or binary-source models. Our investigation reveals that the light curves of microlensing events KMT-2021-BLG-0284, KMT-2022-BLG-2480, and KMT-2024-BLG-0412 display highly complex patterns with three or more anomaly features. These features cannot be adequately explained by a binary-lens (2L1S) model alone. However, the 2L1S model can effectively describe certain segments of the light curve. By incorporating an additional source into the modeling, we identified a comprehensive model that accounts for all the observed anomaly features. Bayesian analysis, based on constraints provided by lensing observables, indicates that the lenses of KMT-2021-BLG-0284 and KMT-2024-BLG-0412 are binary systems composed of M dwarfs. For KMT-2022-BLG-2480, the primary lens is an early K-type main-sequence star with an M dwarf companion. The lenses of KMT-2021-BLG-0284 and KMT-2024-BLG-0412 are likely located in the bulge, whereas the lens of KMT-2022-BLG-2480 is more likely situated in the disk. In all events, the binary stars of the sources have similar magnitudes due to a detection bias favoring binary source events with a relatively bright secondary source star, which increases detection efficiency.

 - **Abstract**
 The relationship between galaxies and their supermassive black holes (SMBHs) is an area of active research. One way to investigate this is to compare parsec-scale jets formed by SMBHs with the projected shape of their kiloparsec-scale host galaxies. We analyse Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) images of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and optical images of their host galaxies. We compare the inner-jet position angle in VLBI-detected radio sources with the optical shapes of galaxies as measured by several large optical surveys. In total 6273 galaxy-AGN pairs were found. We carefully account for the systematics of the cross-matched sources and find that Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Legacy Imaging Surveys data (DESI LS) is significantly less affected by them. Using DESI LS, with which 5853 galaxy-AGN pairs were cross-matched, we find a weak but significant alignment signal (with a p-value $\leqslant$ 0.01) between the parsec-scale AGN jet and the kpc projected minor axis of the optical host galaxy in sources with measured spectroscopic redshifts. Our results show that the observed source properties are connected over 3 orders of magnitude in scale. This points towards an intimate connection between the SMBH, their host galaxies and their subsequent evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 The multi-window observations, including the light curve and the evolutions of the spectral peak energy ($E_p$), the polarization degree (PD) and the polarization angle (PA), are used to infer the model parameters to predict the time-integrated PD in gamma-ray burst (GRB) prompt phase. We select 23 GRBs co-detected by Fermi/GBM and polarization detectors (i.e., GAP, POLAR and AstroSat). In our multi-window fitting, the light curve, $E_p$ curve, PD curve and PA curve are interpreted simultaneously under the synchrotron radiation model in ordered magnetic fields (i.e., the aligned-fields case and the toroidal-fields case). For the bursts with abrupt PA rotations, the predicted time-integrated PD of the aligned-fields case roughly matches the corresponding observed best fit value, while it is higher for the toroidal-fields case. For the bursts without abrupt PA rotation(s), the predicted PDs of the aligned-fields case and the toroidal-fields case are comparable and could interpret the observational data equally well. For GRB 170206A, its observed time-resolved and time-integrated PDs are comparable and both smaller than our predicted upper limits in ordered magnetic fields. So mixed magnetic fields, i.e., the magnetic fields with both ordered and random components, should be reside in the radiation regions of this burst. Except 1 out of the total 23 bursts, the predicted time-integrated PDs, which are around $\sim44\%$ for the aligned-fields case and around $49\%$ for the toroidal-fields case, are consistent with the corresponding observed values. Therefore, consistent with the former study, the models with synchrotron radiation in ordered magnetic fields could interpret most of the current polrization data within $1\sigma$ error bar.

 - **Abstract**
 Supernova remnants (SNRs) can exert strong influence on molecular clouds (MCs) through interaction by shock wave and cosmic rays. In this paper, we present our mapping observation of HCO+ and HCN 1-0 lines towards 13 SNRs interacting with MCs, together with archival data of CO isotopes. Strong HCO+ emission is found in the fields of view (FOVs) of SNRs W30, G9.7-0.0, Kes 69, 3C 391, 3C 396, W51C, HC 40, and CTB109 in the local-standard-of-rest (LSR) velocity intervals in which they are suggested to show evidence of SNR-MC interaction. We find an incomplete 12CO shell surrounding G9.7-0.0 with an expanding motion. This shell may be driven by the stellar wind of the SNR progenitor. We also find an arc of 12CO gas spatially coincident with the northwestern radio shell of Kes 69. As for the HCO+ line emission, SNRs 3C 391 and W51C exhibit significant line profile broadening indicative of shock perturbation, and CTB109 exhibits a possible blue-shifted line wing brought by shock interaction. We do not find significant variation of the I(HCO+)/I(HCN) line ratio between broad-line and narrow-line regions, among different SNRs, and between MCs associated with SNRs and typical Galactic MCs. Therefore, we caution on using the I(HCO+)/I(HCN) line ratio as a diagnostic of SNR feedback and CR ionization. We also estimate the N(HCO+)/N(CO) abundance ratio in 11 regions towards the observed SNRs, but they show little difference from the typical values in quiescent MCs, possibly because N(HCO+)/N(CO) is not an effective tracer of CR ionization.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we focus on the simulation of accretion processes in Magnetically Arrested Disks (MADs) and investigate the dynamics of plasma during flux eruption events. We employ general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations and search for regions with a divergent velocity during a flux eruption event. These regions would experience rapid and significant depletion of matter. For this reason, we monitor the activation rate of the floor and the mass supply required for stable simulation evolution to further trace this transient stagnation surface. Our findings reveal an unexpected and persistent stagnation surface that develops during these eruptions, located around 2-3 gravitational radii (${\rm r_g}$) from the black hole. The stagnation surface is defined by a divergent velocity field and is accompanied by enhanced mass addition. This represents the first report of such a feature in this context. The stagnation surface is ($7-9\,\,{\rm r_g}$) long. We estimate the overall potential difference along this stagnation surface for a supermassive black hole like M87 to be approximately $\Delta V \approx 10^{16}$ Volts. Our results indicate that, in MAD configurations, this transient stagnation surface during flux eruption events can be associated with an accelerator of charged particles in the vicinity of supermassive black holes. In light of magnetic reconnection processes during these events, this work presents a complementary or an alternative mechanism for particle acceleration.

 - **Abstract**
 We infer the origin channels of hierarchical mergers observed in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) O1, O2, and O3 runs using a hierarchical Bayesian analysis under a parametric population model. By assuming the active galactic nucleus (ANG) disk and nuclear star cluster (NSC) channels, we find that NSCs likely dominate the hierarchical merger rate in the universe, corresponding to a fraction of $f_{\rm NSC}=0.87_{-0.29}^{+0.10}$ at 90\% credible intervals in our fiducial model; AGN disks may contribute up to nearly half of hierarchical mergers detectable with LVK, specifically $f_{\rm det,AGN}=0.34_{-0.26}^{+0.38}$. We investigate the impact of the escape speed, along with other population parameters on the branching fraction, suggesting that the mass, mass ratio, and spin of the sources play significant roles in population analysis. We show that hierarchical mergers constitute at least $\sim$$10\%$ of the gravitational wave events detected by LVK during the O1-O3 runs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it is challenging to effectively infer detailed information about the host environment based solely on the distribution of black hole merger parameters if multiple formation channels are considered.

 - **Abstract**
 Aims: This paper aims to demonstrate the importance of short-exposure extreme ultraviolet (EUV) observations of solar flares in the study of particle acceleration, heating and energy partition in flares. This work highlights the observations now available from the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) instrument suite onboard Solar Orbiter while operating in short exposure mode. Methods: A selection of noteworthy flares observed simultaneously by the Spectrometer Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX) and the Full Sun Imager of EUI (EUI/FSI) are detailed. New insights are highlighted and potential avenues of investigation are demonstrated, including forward modelling the atmospheric response to a non-thermal beam of electrons using the RADYN 1D hydrodynamic code, in order to compare the predicted and observed EUV emission. Results: The examples given in this work demonstrate that short exposure EUI/FSI observations are providing important diagnostics during flares. A dataset of more than 9000 flares observed by STIX (from November 2022 until December 2023) with at least one short exposure EUI/FSI 174 Å image is currently available. The observations reveal that the brightest parts of short-exposure observations consist of substructure in flaring ribbons which spatially overlap with the hard X-ray emission observed by STIX in the majority of cases. We show that these observations provide an opportunity to further constrain the electron energy flux required for flare modelling, among other potential applications.

 - **Abstract**
 A novel approach is proposed to reveal a secret birth of enhanced circumstellar material (CSM) surrounding a collapsing massive star using neutrinos as a unique probe. In this scheme, non-thermal TeV-scale neutrinos produced in ejecta-CSM interactions are tied with thermal MeV neutrinos emitted from a pre-explosion burning process, based on a scenario that CSM had been formed via the pre-supernova activity. Taking a representative model of the pre-supernova neutrinos, spectrum and light curve of the corresponding high-energy CSM neutrinos are calculated at multiple mass-loss efficiencies considered as a systematic uncertainty. In addition, as a part of method demonstration, the detected event rates along time at JUNO and IceCube, as representative detectors, are estimated for the pre-supernova and CSM neutrinos, respectively, and are compared with the expected background rate at each detector. The presented method is found to be reasonably applicable for the range up to 1 kpc and even farther with future experimental efforts. Potentialities of other neutrino detectors, such as SK-Gd, Hyper-Kamiokande and KM3NeT, are also discussed. This is a pioneering work of performing astrophysics with neutrinos from diverse energy regimes, initiating multi energy neutrino astronomy in the forthcoming era where next-generation large-scale neutrino telescopes are operating.

 - **Abstract**
 Strongly lensed type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) provide a unique cosmological probe to address the Hubble tension problem in cosmology. In addition to the sensitivity of the time delays to the value of the Hubble constant, the transient and standard candle nature of SNe Ia also enable valuable joint constraints on the model of the lens and the cosmological parameters. The upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) with the Vera C. Rubin Observatory is expected to increase the number of observed SNe Ia by an order of magnitude in ten years of its lifetime. However, finding such systems in the LSST data is a challenge. In this work, we revisit the color-magnitude (CM) diagram used previously as a means to identify lensed SNe Ia and extend the work further as follows. We simulate LSST-like photometric data ($rizy$~bands) of lensed SNe Ia and analyze it in the CM parameter space. We find that a subset of lensed SNe Ia are redder compared to unlensed SNe Ia at a given magnitude, both in the rising and falling phases of their light curves and for SNe up to $z=3$. We propose a modified selection criterion based on these new results. We show that the contamination coming from the unlensed core-collapse (CC) SNe is negligible, whereas a small fraction of lensed CC SNe types Ib and Ic may get selected by this criterion as potential lensed SNe. Finally, we demonstrate that our criterion works well on a wide sample of observed unlensed SNe Ia, a handful of known multiply-imaged lensed SNe systems, and a representative sample of observed super-luminous supernovae.
#### A search for HI absorption in distant star-forming galaxies with ASKAP-FLASH - I. Selection and analysis of the radio sample

 - **Abstract**
 We present and discuss two catalogues of UV-selected (NUV $< 22.8$ mag) galaxies that lie within a 200 deg$^2$ area of sky covered by the ASKAP FLASH survey and have an impact parameter of less than 20 arcsec to a FLASH radio continuum source. These catalogues are designed to enable a future search for 21 cm HI absorption in and around star-forming galaxies at redshift $0.4<z<1$. We outline the production of this UV-bright dataset, which has optical spectroscopy from the WiggleZ and SDSS surveys and a median redshift of $\sim0.6$. Analysis of the optical spectra, using multiple diagnostic diagrams, shows that galaxies with an impact parameter of less than 5 arcsec are likely to be physically associated with the radio source and are five times more likely to be an AGN than objects without a radio match. Conversely, objects with impact factors between 5 and 20 arcsec are largely (>80 percent) star-forming and resemble the overall WiggleZ population. The ($g - i$) colour evolution with redshift is consistent with a history of active star-formation, but the radio-associated objects are typically redder and have colours similar to high-excitation radio galaxies. The redshift distribution of the two catalogues matches the overall distribution for WiggleZ galaxies, despite their otherwise rare radio properties. These catalogues can be expanded in future as new radio data become available, and a forthcoming paper will present the HI absorption results.
#### COSMOS2020: Disentangling the Role of Mass and Environment in Star Formation Activity of Galaxies at $0.4<z<4$

 - **Abstract**
 The role of internal and environmental factors in the star formation activity of galaxies is still a matter of debate, particularly at higher redshifts. Leveraging the most recent release of the COSMOS catalog, COSMOS2020, and density measurements from our previous study we disentangle the impact of environment and stellar mass on the star formation rate (SFR), and specific SFR (sSFR) of a sample of $\sim 210,000$ galaxies within redshift range $0.4< z < 4$ and present our findings in three cosmic epochs: 1) out to $z\sim 1$, the average SFR and sSFR decline at extremely dense environments and high mass end of the distribution which is mostly due to the presence of the massive quiescent population; 2) at $1<z<2$, the environmental dependence diminishes, while mass is still the dominant factor in star formation activity; 3) beyond $z\sim 2$, our sample is dominated by star-forming galaxies and we observe a reversal of the trends seen in the local universe: the average SFR increases with increasing environmental density. Our analysis shows that both environmental and mass quenching efficiencies increase with stellar mass at all redshifts, with mass being the dominant quenching factor in massive galaxies compared to environmental effects. At $2<z<4$, negative values of environmental quenching efficiency suggest that the fraction of star-forming galaxies in dense environments exceeds that in less dense regions, likely due to the greater availability of cold gas, higher merger rates, and tidal effects that trigger star formation activity.

 - **Abstract**
 The Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration (EHTC) observed the Galactic centre source Sgr A* and used emission models primarily based on single ion temperature (1T) general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations. This predicted emission is strongly dependent on a modelled prescription of the ion-to-electron temperature ratio. The two most promising models are magnetically arrested disk (MAD) states. However, these and nearly all MAD models exhibit greater light-curve variability at 230 GHz compared to historical observations. Moreover, no model successfully passes all the variability and multiwavelength constraints. This limitation possibly stems from the fact that the actual temperature ratio depends on microphysical dissipation, radiative processes and other effects not captured in ideal fluid simulations. Therefore, we investigate the effects of two-temperature (2T) thermodynamics in MAD GRMHD simulations of Sgr A*, where the temperatures of both species are evolved more self-consistently. We include Coulomb coupling, radiative cooling of electrons, and model heating via magnetic reconnection. We find that the light-curve variability more closely matches historical observations when we include the 2T treatment and variable adiabatic indices, compared to 1T simulations. Contrary to the common assumption of neglecting radiative cooling for the low accretion rates of Sgr A*, we also find that radiative cooling still affects the accretion flow, reducing the electron temperature in the inner disk by about 10%, which in turn lowers both the average flux and variability at 230 GHz by roughly 10%.

 The VLT Survey Telescope Survey of Mass Assembly and Structural Hierarchy (VST-SMASH) aims to detect tidal features and remnants around very nearby galaxies, a unique and essential diagnostic of the hierarchical nature of galaxy formation. Leveraging optimal sky conditions at ESO's Paranal Observatory, combined with the VST's multi-band optical filters, VST-SMASH aims to be the definitive survey of stellar streams and tidal remnants in the Local Volume, targeting a low surface-brightness limit of $\mu \sim$ 30 mag arcsec$^{-2}$ in the g and r bands, and $\mu \sim$ 28 mag arcsec$^{-2}$ in the i band, in a volume-limited sample of local galaxies within 11 Mpc and the Euclid footprint.
#### X-ray reverberation modelling of the continuum, optical/UV time-lags in quasars

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Extensive, multi-wavelength monitoring campaigns of nearby and higher redshift active galactic nuclei (AGN) have shown that the UV/optical variations are well correlated with time delays which increase with increasing wavelength. Such behaviour is expected in the context of the X-ray thermal reverberation of the accretion disc in AGN. Aims: Our main objective is to use time-lag measurements of luminous AGN and fit them with sophisticated X-ray reverberation time-lags models. In this way we can investigate whether X-ray reverberation can indeed explain the observed continuum time lags, and whether time-lag measurements can be used to measure physical parameters such as the X-ray corona height and the spin of the black hole (BH) in these systems. Methods: We use archival time-lag measurements for quasars from different surveys, and we compute their rest frame, mean time-lags spectrum. We fit the data with analytical X-ray reverberation models, using $\chi^2$ statistics, and fitting for both maximal and non spinning BHs, for various colour correction values and X-ray corona heights. Results: We found that X-ray reverberation can explain very well the observed time lags, assuming the measured BH mass, accretion rate and X-ray luminosity of the quasars in the sample. The model agrees well with the data both for non-rotating and maximally rotating BHs, as long as the corona height is larger than $\sim 40$ gravitational radii. This is in agreement with previous results which showed that X-ray reverberation can also explain the disc radius in micro-lensed quasars, for the same corona heights. The corona height we measure depends on the model assumption of a perfectly flat disc. More realistic disc models may result in lower heights for the X-ray corona.
#### A study on late time UV-emission in core collapse supernovae and the implications for the peculiar transient AT2018cow

 - **Abstract**
 Over time, core-collapse supernova (CCSN) spectra become redder due to dust formation and cooling of the SN ejecta. A UV detection of a CCSN at late times thus indicates an additional physical process such as interaction between the SN ejecta and the circumstellar material, or viewing down to the central engine of the explosion. Both these models have been proposed to explain the peculiar transient AT2018cow, a luminous fast blue optical transient that has been detected in the UV 2-4 years after the event with only marginal fading over this time period. To identify if the late-time UV detection of AT2018cow could indicate that it is a CCSN, we investigate if CCSNe are detected in the UV between 2-5 years after the explosion. We use a sample of 51 nearby (z<0.065) CCSNe observed with the Hubble Space Telescope within 2-5 years of discovery. We measure their brightness, or determine an upper limit on the emission through an artificial star experiment if there is no detection. For two CCSNe we detect a point source within the uncertainty region of the SN position. Both have a low chance alignment probability with bright objects within their host galaxies and are thus likely related to the SNe. Comparing the absolute UV magnitude of AT2018cow to the absolute UV magnitudes of the two potential SN detections, there is no evidence that a late-time UV detection of AT2018cow is atypical for interacting SNe. However, when limiting to CCSNe closer than AT2018cow, we see that it is brighter than the upper limits on most non-detections. Combined with a very small late time photospheric radius of AT2018cow, this leads us to conclude that AT2018cow's late-time UV detection was not driven by interaction. It suggests instead that we are possibly viewing the inner region of the explosion. Such properties are naturally expected in tidal disruption models and are less straightforward in supernova scenarios.
