#### Montage and Radio Astronomy

 - **Abstract**
 The Montage Image Mosaic Engine, first released in 2002, has found applicability across the electromagnetic spectrum to support data processing and visualization. This broad applicability has come about through its design as an Open Source ANSI-C toolkit (and Python binary extensions), with independent components to perform each step in the creation of a mosaic and with support for all WCS extensions. This design enables easy integration into custom environments, workflows and pipelines, and is the principal reason for its long lifetime. Here we emphasize the growing use of Montage in radio astronomy (37 peer-reviewed papers since 2020), and will focus on three high-profile applications: (1) Analysis of observations made with SKA precursor experiments, such as MeerKAT and the Murchison Wide-field Array, (2) Faraday tomography of LOFAR Two-Metre Sky Survey data (LoTSS-DR2), which explores the structure of the local interstellar medium, and (3) Identification of fast radio bursts.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a spectroscopic analysis of MACS J0138$-$2155, at $z=0.336$, the first galaxy cluster hosting two strongly-lensed supernovae (SNe), Requiem and Encore, providing us with a chance to obtain a reliable $H_0$ measurement from the time delays between the multiple images. We take advantage of new data from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) on the Very Large Telescope, covering a central $1 \rm \, arcmin^2$ of the lensing cluster, for a total depth of 3.7 hours, including 2.9 hours recently obtained by our Target of Opportunity programme. Our new spectroscopic catalogue contains reliable redshifts for 107 objects, including 50 galaxy cluster members with secure redshift values in the range $0.324 < z < 0.349$, and 13 lensed multiple images from four background sources between $0.767\leq z \leq 3.420$, including four images of the host galaxy of the two SNe. We exploit the MUSE data to study the stellar kinematics of 14 bright cluster members and two background galaxies, obtaining reliable measurements of their line-of-sight velocity dispersion. Finally, we combine these results with measurements of the total magnitude of the cluster members in the Hubble Space Telescope F160W band to calibrate the Faber-Jackson relation between luminosity and stellar velocity dispersion ($L \propto \sigma^{1/\alpha}$) for the early-type cluster member galaxies, measuring a slope $\alpha=0.25^{+0.05}_{-0.05}$. A pure and complete sample of cluster member galaxies and a reliable characterisation of their total mass structure are key to building accurate total mass maps of the cluster, mitigating the impact of parametric degeneracies, which is necessary for inferring the value of $H_0$ from the measured time delays between the lensed images of the two SNe.
#### The clus model in SPEX: projection and resonant scattering effects on the iron abundance and temperature profiles of galaxy clusters
 - **Authors:** Lýdia Štofanová, Aurora Simionescu, Jelle S. Kaastra

Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13252

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13252

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper we introduce the clus model, which has been newly implemented in the X-ray spectral fitting software package SPEX. Based on the 3D radial profiles of the gas density, temperature, metal abundance, turbulent, and inflow/outflow velocities, the clus model creates spectra for a chosen projected region on the sky. Additionally, it can also take into account the resonant scattering. We show a few applications of the clus model on simulated spectra of the massive elliptical galaxy NGC 4636, and galaxy clusters A383, A2029, A1795, A262, and the Perseus cluster. We quantify the effect of projection, as well as resonant scattering on inferred profiles of the iron abundance and temperature, assuming the resolution similar to Chandra ACIS-S and XRISM Resolve. Our results show that, depending on the mass of the object, as well as the projected distance from its core, neither a single-temperature, double-temperature, nor the Gaussian-shaped differential emission measure models can accurately describe the input emission measure distribution of these massive objects. The largest effect of projection as well as resonant scattering is seen for projected profiles of iron abundance of NGC 4636, where we are able to reproduce the observed iron abundance drop in its inner-most few kiloparsecs. Furthermore, we find that projection effects also influence the best-fit temperature, and the magnitude of this effect varies depending on the underlying hydrodynamical profiles of individual objects. In the core, the projection effects are the largest for A1795 and NGC 4636, while in the outskirts the largest difference between 2D and 3D temperature profiles are for Perseus and A1795, regardless of the instrumental resolution. These findings might potentially have an impact on cross-calibration studies between different instruments, as well as on the precision cosmology.
#### Where do X-ray low surface brightness clusters sit with respect to filaments?

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13258

 - **Abstract**
 The aim of this work is to study the position of gas-rich and gas-poor galaxy clusters within the large-scale structure and, in particular, their distance to filaments. Our sample is built from 29 of the 34 clusters in the X-ray unbiased cluster sample (XUCS), a velocity-dispersion-selected sample for which various properties, including masses, gas fractions, and X-ray surface brightness were available in the literature. We compute the projected distance between each cluster and the spine of the nearest filament with the same redshift and investigate the link between this distance and the previously-mentioned properties of the clusters, in particular with their gas content. The average distance between clusters and filaments is larger for low X-ray surface brightness clusters than for those of high surface brightness, with intermediate brightness clusters being an intermediate case. Also the minimum distance follows a similar trend, with rare cases of low surface brightness clusters found at distances smaller than 2 Mpc from the spine of filaments. However, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistical test is not able to exclude the null hypothesis that the two distributions are coming from the same parent one. We speculate that the position of galaxy clusters within the cosmic web could have a direct impact in their gas mass fraction, hence on its X-ray surface brightness, since the presence of a filament can oppose resistance to the outward flow of gas induced by the central AGN and reduce the time required for this gas to fall inward after the AGN is shut. However, a larger sample of clusters is needed in order to derive a statistically-robust conclusion
#### Precise and efficient modeling of stellar-activity-affected solar spectra using SOAP-GPU

 - **Abstract**
 One of the main obstacles in exoplanet detection when using the radial velocity (RV) technique is the presence of stellar activity signal induced by magnetic regions. In this context, a realistic simulated dataset that can provide photometry and spectroscopic outputs is needed for method development. The goal of this paper is to describe two realistic simulations of solar activity obtained from SOAP-GPU and to compare them with real data obtained from the HARPS-N solar telescope. We describe two different methods of modeling solar activity using SOAP-GPU. The first models the evolution of active regions based on the spot number as a function of time. The second method relies on the extraction of active regions from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) data. The simulated spectral time series generated with the first method shows a long-term RV behavior similar to that seen in the HARPS-N solar observations. The effect of stellar activity induced by stellar rotation is also well modeled with prominent periodicities at the stellar rotation period and its first harmonic. The comparison between the simulated spectral time series generated using SDO images and the HARPS-N solar spectra shows that SOAP-GPU can precisely model the RV time series of the Sun to a precision better than 0.9 m/s. By studying the width and depth variations of each spectral line in the HARPS-N solar and SOAP-GPU data, we find a strong correlation between the observation and the simulation for strong spectral lines, therefore supporting the modeling of the stellar activity effect at the spectral level. These simulated solar spectral time series serve as a useful test bed for evaluating spectral-level stellar activity mitigation techniques.
#### Cool-Core Destruction in Merging Clusters with AGN Feedback and Radiative Cooling

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of cool-core (CC) and non-cool-core (NCC) dichotomy of galaxy clusters remains uncertain. Previous simulations have found that cluster mergers are effective in destroying CCs but fail to prevent overcooling in cluster cores when radiative cooling is included. Feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) is a promising mechanism for balancing cooling in CCs; however, the role of AGN feedback in CC/NCC transitions remains elusive. In this work, we perform three-dimensional binary cluster merger simulations incorporating AGN feedback and radiative cooling, aiming to investigate the heating effects from mergers and AGN feedback on CC destruction. We vary the mass ratio and impact parameter to examine the entropy evolution of different merger scenarios. We find that AGN feedback is essential in regulating the merging clusters, and that CC destruction depends on the merger parameters. Our results suggest three scenarios regarding CC/NCC transitions: (1) CCs are preserved in minor mergers or mergers that do not trigger sufficient heating, in which cases AGN feedback is crucial for preventing the cooling catastrophe; (2) CCs are transformed into NCCs by major mergers during the first core passage, and AGN feedback is subdominant; (3) in major mergers with a large impact parameter, mergers and AGN feedback operate in concert to destroy the CCs.
#### Hunting pre-stellar cores with APEX: IRAS16293E (Oph464)

 - **Abstract**
 Pre-stellar cores are the first steps in the process of star and planet formation. However, the dynamical and chemical evolution of pre-stellar cores is still not well understood. We aim at estimating the central density of the pre-stellar core IRAS16293E and at carrying out an inventory of molecular species towards the density peak of the core. We observed high-$J$ rotational transitions of N$_2$H$^+$ and N$_2$D$^+$, and several other molecular lines towards the dust emission peak using the Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX) telescope, and derived the density and temperature profiles of the core using far-infrared surface brightness maps from $Herschel$. The N$_2$H$^+$ and N$_2$D$^+$ lines were analysed by non-LTE radiative transfer modelling. Our best-fit core model consists in a static inner region, embedded in an infalling envelope with an inner radius of approximately 3000 au (21" at 141 pc). The observed high-J lines of N$_2$H$^+$ and N$_2$D$^+$ (with critical densities greater than 10$^6$ cm$^{-3}$) turn out to be very sensitive to depletion; the present single-dish observations are best explained with no depletion of N$_2$H$^+$ and N$_2$D$^+$ in the inner core. The N$_2$D$^+$/N$_2$H$^+$ ratio that best reproduces our observations is 0.44, one of the largest observed to date in pre-stellar cores. Additionally, half of the molecules that we observed are deuterated isotopologues, confirming the high-level of deuteration towards this source. Non-LTE radiative transfer modelling of N$_2$H$^+$ and N$_2$D$^+$ lines proved to be an excellent diagnostic of the chemical structure and dynamics of a pre-stellar core. Probing the physical conditions immediately before the protostellar collapse is a necessary reference for theoretical studies and simulations with the aim of understanding the earliest stages of star and planet formation and the time scale of this process.

 - **Abstract**
 We report an observed accretion rate of $\dot M_1 = (3.86\pm0.60)\times 10^{-11}$ $M_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ for the white dwarf in the short-period, intermediate polar EX Hya. This result is based upon the accretion-induced $4\pi$-averaged energy flux from 2.45 $\mu$m to 100 keV and the corresponding luminosity at the Gaia distance of 56.77 pc. Our result is in perfect agreement with the theoretical mass transfer rate from the secondary star induced by gravitational radiation (GR) and the spin-up of the white dwarf, $-\dot M_2 = (3.90\pm0.35)\times 10^{-11}$ $M_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$; 24% of it is caused by the spin-up. The agreement indicates that mass transfer is conservative. The measured $\dot M_1$ obviates the need for angular momentum loss (AML) by any process other than GR. We complemented this result with an estimate of the mean secular mass transfer rate over $\sim 10^7$ yr by interpreting the non-equilibrium radius of the secondary star in EX Hya based on published evolutionary calculations. This suggests a time-averaged mass transfer rate enhanced over GR by a factor $f_{\mathrm{GR}} \gtrsim 2$. Combined with the present-day lack of such an excess, we suggest that an enhanced secular AML is due to an intermittently active process, such as the proposed frictional motion of the binary in the remnants of nova outbursts. We argue that EX Hya, despite its weakly magnetic nature, has evolved in a very similar way to non-magnetic CVs. We speculate that the discontinuous nature of an enhanced secular AML may similarly apply to the latter.
#### X-ray pulsed light curves of highly compact neutron stars as probes of scalar-tensor theories of gravity

 - **Abstract**
 The strong gravitational potential of neutron stars (NSs) makes them ideal astrophysical objects for testing extreme gravity phenomena. We explore the potential of NS X-ray pulsed lightcurve observations to probe deviations from general relativity (GR) within the scalar-tensor theory (STT) of gravity framework. We compute the flux from a single, circular, finite-size hot spot, accounting for light bending, Shapiro time delay, and Doppler effect. We focus on the high-compactness regime, i.e., close to the critical GR value GM/(Rc^2) = 0.284, over which multiple images of the spot appear and impact crucially the lightcurve. Our investigation is motivated by the increased sensitivity of the pulse to the scalar charge of the spacetime in such high compactness regimes, making these systems exceptionally suitable for scrutinizing deviations from GR, notably phenomena such as spontaneous scalarization, as predicted by STT. We find significant differences in NS observables, e.g., the flux of a single spot can differ up to 80% with respect to GR. Additionally, reasonable choices for the STT parameters that satisfy astrophysical constraints lead to changes in the NS radius relative to GR of up to approximately 10%. Consequently, scalar parameters might be better constrained when uncertainties in NS radii decrease, where this could occur with the advent of next-generation gravitational wave detectors, such as the Einstein Telescope and LISA, as well as future electromagnetic missions like eXTP and ATHENA. Thus, our findings suggest that accurate X-ray data of the NS surface emission, jointly with refined theoretical models, could constrain STTs.
#### Directional miscentering dependence in weak lensing mass bias

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy cluster masses estimated from parametric modeling of weak lensing shear observations are known to be biased by inaccuracies in observationally determined centers. It has recently been shown that such systematic effects can be non-isotropic when centers are derived from X-ray or Compton-Y (Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect) observations, which is often the case in practice. This fact challenges current methods of accurately correcting for weak lensing mass biases using simulations paired with isotropic empirical miscentering distributions, in particular as the effect on determined masses is currently a dominant source of systematic uncertainty. We use hydrodanamical cosmological simulations taken from the Magneticum Pathfinder simulations to show that the non-isotropic component of the mass bias can be reduced to within one percent of the mass when considering the center of mass, rather than the bottom of the gravitational potential, as the reference center of a galaxy cluster.

 - **Abstract**
 The gradient and curvature of the Parker spiral interplanetary magnetic field give rise to curvature and gradient guiding centre drifts on cosmic rays. The plasma turbulence present in the interplanetary space is thought to suppress the drifts, however the extent to which they are reduced is not clear. We investigate the reduction of the drifts using a new analytic model of heliospheric turbulence where the dominant 2D component has both the wave vector and the magnetic field vector normal to the Parker spiral, thus fulfilling the main criterion of 2D turbulence. We use full-orbit test particle simulations of energetic protons in the modelled interplanetary turbulence, and analyse the mean drift velocity of the particles in heliolatitude. We release energetic proton populations of 10, 100 and 1000~MeV close to Sun and introduce a new method to assess their drift. We compare the drift in the turbulent heliosphere to drift in a configuration without turbulence, and to theoretical estimates of drift reduction. We find that drifts are reduced by a factor 0.2-0.9 of that expected for the heliospheric configuration without turbulence. This corresponds to a much less efficient suppression than what is predicted by theoretical estimates, particularly at low proton energies. We conclude that guiding centre drifts are a significant factor for the evolution of cosmic ray intensities in the heliosphere including the propagation of solar energetic particles in the inner heliosphere.
#### Model-Agnostic Cosmological Inference with SDSS-IV eBOSS: Simultaneous Probing for Background and Perturbed Universe

 - **Abstract**
 Here we explore certain subtle features imprinted in data from the completed Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV (SDSS-IV) extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) as a combined probe for the background and perturbed Universe. We reconstruct the baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) and Redshift Space Distortion (RSD) observables as functions of redshift, using measurements from SDSS alone. We apply the Multi-Task Gaussian Process (MTGP) framework to model the interdependencies of cosmological observables $D_M(z)/r_d$, $D_H(z)/r_d$, and $f\sigma_8(z)$, and track their evolution across different redshifts. Subsequently, we obtain constrained three-dimensional phase space containing $D_M(z)/r_d$, $D_H(z)/r_d$, and $f\sigma_8(z)$ at different redshifts probed by the SDSS-IV eBOSS survey. Furthermore, assuming the $\Lambda$CDM model, we obtain constraints on model parameters $\Omega_{m}$, $H_{0}r_{d}$, $\sigma_{8}$ and $S_{8}$ at each redshift probed by SDSS-IV eBOSS. This indicates redshift-dependent trends in $H_0$, $\Omega_m$, $\sigma_8$ and $S_8$ in the $\Lambda$CDM model, suggesting a possible inconsistency in the $\Lambda$CDM model. Ours is a template for model-independent extraction of information for both background and perturbed Universe using a single galaxy survey taking into account all the existing correlations between background and perturbed observables and this can be easily extended to future DESI-3YR as well as Euclid results.
#### Ohmic heating in the upper atmosphere of hot exoplanets The influence of a time-varying magnetic field

 - **Abstract**
 Exoplanets on close-in orbit are subject to intense X-ray and ultraviolet (XUV) irradiation from their star. Their atmosphere therefore heats up, sometimes to the point where it thermally escapes from the gravitational potential of the planet. Nonetheless, XUV is not the only source of heating in such atmospheres. Indeed, close-in exoplanets are embedded in a medium (the stellar wind) with strong magnetic fields that can significantly vary along the orbit. The variations of this magnetic field can induce currents in the upper atmosphere, which dissipate and locally heat it up through Ohmic heating. The aim of this work is to quantify Ohmic heating in the upper atmosphere of hot exoplanets due to an external time-varying magnetic field, and to compare it to the XUV heating. Ohmic heating depends strongly on the conductivity properties of the upper atmosphere. A 1D formalism is developed to assess the level and the localization of Ohmic heating depending on the conductivity profile, and applied to the specific cases of Trappist-1 b and $\pi$ Men c. Ohmic heating can reach values up to 10$^{-3}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-3}$ in the upper atmospheres of hot exoplanets. It is expected to be stronger the closer the planet is and the lower the central star mass is, as these conditions maximize the strength of the ambient magnetic field around the planet. We confirm that Ohmic heating can play an important role in setting the thermal budget of the upper atmosphere of hot exoplanets, and can even surpass the XUV heating in the most favorable cases. When it is strong, a corollary is that the upper atmosphere screens efficiently time-varying external magnetic fields, preventing them to penetrate deeper in the atmosphere or inside the planet itself. We find that both Trappist-1b and $\pi$ Men c are likely subject to intense Ohmic heating.
