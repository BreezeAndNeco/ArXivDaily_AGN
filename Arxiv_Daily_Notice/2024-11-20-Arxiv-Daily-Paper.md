 - **Abstract**
 In the monograph, the authors systematize and generalize the results of studying solar-type activity that is characteristic of a significant part of mid- and low-mass stars of the Galaxy, outline the characteristics of such stars in the quiescent state, during the sporadic flares and variations of magnetic activity over the course of stellar evolution. The observational data taken over the whole range of the electromagnetic spectrum from decametric radio waves to X-rays are described in detail. The current models of stellar flares and stellar dynamo models are considered in two theoretical chapters. The last part of the book describes the impact of stellar activity of mid- and low-mass stars on exoplanetary environments. The Catalog of Stars with Solar-Type Activity is provided in the supplementary section. The book is intended for researchers involved in studying the physics of stars and the Sun, graduate students, and students specialized in heliophysics, astrophysics, and in the field of space physics. The cover shows the distribution of 314618 stars with solar-type activity over the celestial sphere.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations from the Juno spacecraft during its transit over flux tubes of the Galilean moons have identified sharp enhancements of particle fluxes at discrete energies. These banded structures have been suspected to originate from a bounce resonance between particles and standing Alfven waves generated by the moon-magnetospheric interaction. Here, we show that predictions from the above hypothesis are inconsistent with the observations, and propose an alternative interpretation that the banded structures are remote signals of particle absorption at the moons. In this scenario, whether a particle would encounter the moon before reaching Juno depends on the number of bounce cycles it experiences within a fixed section of drift motion determined by moon-spacecraft longitudinal separation. Therefore, the absorption bands are expected to appear at discrete, equally-spaced velocities consistent with the observations. This finding improves our understanding of moon-plasma interactions and provides a potential way to evaluate the Jovian magnetospheric models.
#### Zooming-in on cluster radio relics -- I. How density fluctuations explain the Mach number discrepancy, microgauss magnetic fields, and spectral index variations

 - **Abstract**
 It is generally accepted that radio relics are the result of synchrotron emission from shock-accelerated electrons. Current models, however, are still unable to explain several aspects of their formation. In this paper, we focus on three outstanding problems: i) Mach number estimates derived from radio data do not agree with those derived from X-ray data, ii) cooling length arguments imply a magnetic field that is at least an order of magnitude larger than the surrounding intracluster medium (ICM), and iii) spectral index variations do not agree with standard cooling models. To solve these problems, we first identify typical shock conditions in cosmological simulations, using the results to inform significantly higher resolution shock-tube simulations. We apply the cosmic ray electron spectra code CREST and the emission code CRAYON+ to these, thereby generating mock observables ab-initio. We identify that upon running into an accretion shock, merger shocks generate a shock-compressed sheet, which, in turn, runs into upstream density fluctuations in pressure equilibrium. This mechanism directly gives rise to solutions to the three problems: it creates a distribution of Mach numbers at the shock-front, which flattens cosmic ray electron spectra, thereby biasing radio-derived Mach number estimates to higher values. We show that this effect is particularly strong in weaker shocks. Secondly, the density sheet becomes Rayleigh-Taylor unstable at the contact discontinuity, causing turbulence and additional compression downstream. This amplifies the magnetic field from ICM-like conditions up to microgauss levels. We show that synchrotron-based measurements are strongly biased by the tail of the distribution here too. Finally, the same instability also breaks the common assumption that matter is advected at the post-shock velocity downstream, thus invalidating laminar-flow based cooling models.

 - **Abstract**
 Supermassive binary black holes are a key target for the future Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, and excellent multi-messenger sources with gravitational waves. However, unique features of their electromagnetic emission that are needed to distinguish them from single supermassive black holes are still being established. Here, we conduct the first magnetohydrodynamic simulation of accretion onto eccentric binary black holes in full general relativity incorporating synchrotron radiation transport through their dual-jet. We show that the total accretion rate, jet Poynting luminosity, and the optically thin synchrotron emission exhibit periodicity on the binary orbital period, demonstrating explicitly, for the first time, that the binary accretion rate periodicity can be reflected in its electromagnetic signatures. Additionally, we demonstrate that during each periodic cycle eccentric binaries spend more time in a low emission state than in a high state. Furthermore, we find that the gravitational wave bursts from eccentric binaries are coincident with the bursts in their jet luminosity and synchrotron emission. We discuss how multimessenger observations of these systems can probe plasma physics in their jet.

 - **Abstract**
 Protoclusters are high-$z$ overdense regions that will evolve into clusters of galaxies by $z=0$, making them ideal for studying galaxy evolution expected to be accelerated by environmental effects. However, it has been challenging to identify protoclusters beyond $z=3$ only by photometry due to large redshift uncertainties, hindering statistical study. To tackle the issue, we develop a new deep-learning-based protocluster detection model, PCFNet, which considers a protocluster as a point cloud. To detect protoclusters at $z\sim4$ using only optical broad-band photometry, we train and evaluate PCFNet with mock $g$-dropout galaxies based on the N-body simulation with the semi-analytic model. We use the sky distribution, $i$-band magnitude, $(g-i)$ color, and the redshift probability density function surrounding a target galaxy on the sky. PCFNet achieves to detect five times more protocluster member candidates while maintaining high purity (recall $=7.5\pm0.2$%, precision $=44\pm1$%) than conventional methods. Moreover, PCFNet is able to detect more progenitors ($M_\mathrm{halo}^{z=0}=10^{14-14.5}\,M_\odot$) that are less massive than supermassive clusters like the Coma cluster. We apply PCFNet to the observational photometric dataset of the HSC-SSP Deep/UltraDeep layer ($\sim17\mathrm{\,deg^2}$) and detect $121$ protocluster candidates at $z\sim4$. We find the rest-UV luminosities of our protocluster member candidates are brighter than those of field galaxies, which is consistent with previous studies. Additionally, the quenching of satellite galaxies depends on both the core galaxy's halo mass at $z\sim4$ and accumulated mass until $z=0$ in the simulation. PCFNet is very flexible and can find protoclusters at other redshifts or in future extensive surveys by Euclid, LSST, and Roman.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent literature on core-collapse supernovae suggests that a black hole (BH) can form within $\sim 1$ s of shock revival, while still culminating in a successful supernova. We refer to these as black hole supernovae, as they are distinct from other BH formation channels in both timescale and impact on the explosion. We simulate these events self-consistently from core-collapse until $20\text{-}50$ days after collapse using three axisymmetric models of a $60$ M$_\odot$ zero-age main sequence progenitor star and investigate how the composition of the ejecta is impacted by the BH formation. We employ Skyrme-type equations of state (EOSs) and vary the uncertain nucleonic effective mass, which affects the pressure inside the proto-neutron star through the thermal part of the EOS. This results in different BH formation times and explosion energies at BH formation, yielding final explosion energies between $0.06\text{-}0.72\times 10^{51}$ erg with $21.8\text{-}23.3$ M$_\odot$ of ejecta, of which $0\text{-}0.018$ M$_\odot$ is $^{56}$Ni. Compared to expectations from 1D simulations, we find a more nuanced EOS dependence of the explosion dynamics, the mass of the BH remnant, and the elemental composition of the ejecta. We investigate why the explosions survive despite the massive overburden and link the shape of the diagnostic energy curve and character of the ejecta evolution to the progenitor structure.

 - **Abstract**
 Space-based astronomy of hard X-rays and gamma rays covers more than seven orders of magnitude in photon energy, from 10 keV to several hundred GeV. Detecting cosmic photons in this energy range is a challenge, due to the relatively low probability of interaction of high-energy photons with matter and the high background noise generated in space detectors by environmental charged particles and radiation. However, the development of new detection technologies is constantly improving the performance of space-based X- and gamma-ray telescopes. This chapter presents the different detectors used in this field of astronomy, their configuration within space telescopes and some proposals for new instruments.

 - **Abstract**
 JWST has revealed a large population of compact, red galaxies at $z>4$ known as Little Red Dots (LRDs). We analyze the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of 95 LRDs from the JWST PRIMER survey with complete photometric coverage from $1-18\ \mu$m using NIRCam and MIRI imaging, representing the most extensive SED analysis on a large LRD sample with long-wavelength MIRI data. We examine SED models in which either galaxy or active galactic nucleus (AGN) emission dominates the rest-frame UV or optical continuum, extracting physical properties to explore each scenario's implications. In the galaxy-only model, we find massive, dusty stellar populations alongside unobscured, low-mass components, hinting at inhomogeneous obscuration. The AGN-only model indicates dusty, luminous AGNs with low hot dust fractions compared to typical quasars. A hybrid AGN and galaxy model suggests low-mass, unobscured galaxies in the UV, with stellar mass estimates spanning $\sim$2 dex across the different models, underscoring the need for caution in interpreting LRD stellar masses. With MIRI photometry, the galaxy-only model produces stellar masses within cosmological limits, but extremely high stellar mass densities are inferred. The black hole and stellar masses inferred from the hybrid model lead to highly overmassive black holes even exceeding those in recently reported high-redshift AGNs, hinting at a partial AGN contribution to the rest-optical continuum or widespread super-Eddington accretion. Our findings highlight the extreme conditions required for both AGN or galaxy dominated scenarios in LRDs, supporting a mixed contribution to the red continuum, or novel scenarios to explain the observed emission.
#### DESI 2024 V: Full-Shape Galaxy Clustering from Galaxies and Quasars

 - **Abstract**
 We present the measurements and cosmological implications of the galaxy two-point clustering using over 4.7 million unique galaxy and quasar redshifts in the range $0.1<z<2.1$ divided into six redshift bins over a $\sim 7,500$ square degree footprint, from the first year of observations with the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI Data Release 1). By fitting the full power spectrum, we extend previous DESI DR1 baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements to include redshift-space distortions and signals from the matter-radiation equality scale. For the first time, this Full-Shape analysis is blinded at the catalogue-level to avoid confirmation bias and the systematic errors are accounted for at the two-point clustering level, which automatically propagates them into any cosmological parameter. When analysing the data in terms of compressed model-agnostic variables, we obtain a combined precision of 4.7\% on the amplitude of the redshift space distortion signal reaching similar precision with just one year of DESI data than with 20 years of observation from previous generation surveys. We analyse the data to directly constrain the cosmological parameters within the $\Lambda$CDM model using perturbation theory and combine this information with the reconstructed DESI DR1 galaxy BAO. Using a Big Bang Nucleosynthesis Gaussian prior on the baryon density parameter, and a Gaussian prior on the spectral index, we constrain the matter density is $\Omega_m=0.296\pm 0.010 $ and the Hubble constant $H_0=(68.63 \pm 0.79)[{\rm km\, s^{-1}Mpc^{-1}}]$. Additionally, we measure the amplitude of clustering $\sigma_8=0.841 \pm 0.034$. The DESI DR1 results are in agreement with the $\Lambda$CDM model based on general relativity with parameters consistent with those from Planck. The cosmological interpretation of these results in combination with external datasets are presented in a companion paper.
#### COALAS III: The ATCA CO(1-0) look at the growth and death of H$\alpha$ emitters in the Spiderweb protocluster at z=2.16

 - **Abstract**
 We obtain CO(1-0) molecular gas measurements with ATCA on a sample of 43 spectroscopically confirmed H$\alpha$ emitters in the Spiderweb protocluster at $z=2.16$ and investigate the relation between their star formation and cold gas reservoirs as a function of environment. We achieve a CO(1-0) detection rate of $\sim23\pm12\%$ with 10 dual CO(1-0) and H$\alpha$ detections at $10<\log M_{*}/M_\odot<11.5$. In addition, we obtain upper limits for the remaining sources. In terms of total gas fractions ($F_{gas}$), our sample is divided into two different regimes with a steep transition at $\log M_{*}/M_\odot\approx10.5$. Galaxies below that threshold have gas fractions that in some cases are close to unity, indicating that their gas reservoir has been replenished by inflows from the cosmic web. However, objects at $\log M_{*}/M_\odot>10.5$ display significantly lower gas fractions and are dominated by AGN (12 out of 20). Stacking results yield $F_{gas}\approx0.55$ for massive emitters excluding AGN, and $F_{gas}\approx0.35$ when examining only AGN candidates. Furthermore, depletion times show that most H$\alpha$ emitters may become passive by $1<z<1.6$, concurrently with the surge and dominance of the red sequence in the most massive clusters. Our analyses suggest that galaxies in the outskirts of the protocluster have larger molecular-to-stellar mass ratios and lower star formation efficiencies than in the core. However, star formation across the protocluster remains consistent with the main sequence, indicating that evolution is primarily driven by the depletion of the gas reservoir towards the inner regions. We discuss the relative importance of in-/outflow processes in regulating star formation during the early phases of cluster assembly and conclude that a combination of feedback and overconsumption may be responsible for the rapid cold gas depletion these objects endure.

 - **Abstract**
 I present CMBAnalysis, a state-of-the-art Python framework designed for high-precision analysis of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation data. This comprehensive package implements parallel Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques for robust cosmological parameter estimation, featuring adaptive integration methods and sophisticated error propagation. The framework incorporates recent advances in computational cosmology, including support for extended cosmological models, detailed systematic error analysis, and optimized numerical algorithms. I demonstrate its capabilities through analysis of Planck Legacy Archive data, achieving parameter constraints competitive with established pipelines while offering significant performance improvements through parallel processing and algorithmic optimizations. Notable features include automated convergence diagnostics, comprehensive uncertainty quantification, and publication-quality visualization tools. The framework's modular architecture facilitates extension to new cosmological models and analysis techniques, while maintaining numerical stability through carefully implemented regularization schemes. My implementation achieves excellent computational efficiency, with parallel MCMC sampling reducing analysis time by up to 75\% compared to serial implementations. The code is open-source, extensively documented, and includes a comprehensive test suite, making it valuable for both research applications and educational purposes in modern cosmology.
#### Moderate Influence of Halo Spin on Stellar Mass Distributions in Dwarf and Massive Galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 We estimate halo spins for HI-rich galaxies in the Arecibo Legacy Fast Alfa Survey using a semi-analytic approach, examining the relationship between halo spin and stellar surface density. Our findings reveal an inverse correlation in both low- and high-mass galaxy samples, with stellar surface density decreasing as halo spin increases. This trend highlights the pivotal role of halo spin in galaxy evolution and suggests a universal formation scenario: high-spin halos, accompanied by high-spin accreted gas, retain angular momentum, preventing gas from efficiently condensing in the galactic center and thus suppressing star formation. Consequently, weak feedback redistributes gas to the halo outskirts without significant expulsion. The shallower central gravitational potential in high-spin halos promotes outward stellar migration, leading to more extended stellar distributions and lower stellar surface densities.
#### Kinetic tomography of the Galactic plane within 1.25 kiloparsecs from the Sun. The interstellar flows revealed by HI and CO line emission and 3D dust

 - **Abstract**
 We present a reconstruction of the line-of-sight motions of the local interstellar medium (ISM) based on the combination of a state-of-the-art model of the three-dimensional dust density distribution within 1.25 kpc from the Sun and the HI and CO line emission within Galactic latitudes $|b| < 5^{\circ}$. We use the histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) method to match the plane-of-the-sky 3D dust distribution across distances with the atomic and molecular line emission. We identify a significant correlation between the 3D dust model and the line emission. We employ this correlation to assign line-of-sight velocities to the dust across density channels and produce a face-on map of the local ISM radial motions with respect to the local standard of rest (LSR). We find that most of the material in the 3D dust model follows the large-scale pattern of Galactic rotation; however, we also report local departures from the rotation pattern with standard deviations of 12.1 and 6.1 km/s for the HI and CO line emission, respectively. The mean kinetic energy densities of these streaming motions are around 0.68 and 0.18 eV/cm$^{3}$ from either gas tracer. Assuming homogeneity and isotropy in the velocity field, these values are within a factor of a few of the total kinetic energy density. These kinetic energy values are roughly comparable to other energy densities, thus confirming the near-equipartition introduced by the feedback loops connecting the physical processes in the local ISM. Yet, we find energy and momentum overdensities of around a factor of ten concentrated in the Radcliffe Wave, the Split, and other local density structures. Although we do not find evidence of the Local Spiral Arm impact in these overdensities, their distribution suggests the influence of other large-scale effects that, in addition to supernova feedback, shape the energy distribution in the Solar neighborhood.

 - **Abstract**
 Characterising stellar jet asymmetries is key to setting robust constraints on jet launching models and improving our understanding of the underlying mechanisms behind jet launching. We aim to characterise the asymmetric properties of the bipolar jet coming from the Classical T Tauri Star Th 28. We combined data from integral field spectroscopy with VLT/MUSE and high-resolution spectra from VLT/X-shooter to map the optical emission line ratios in both jet lobes. We carried out a diagnostic analysis of these ratios to compare the density, electron temperature, and ionisation fraction within both lobes. The mass accretion rate was derived from the emission lines at the source and compared with the mass outflow rate derived for both lobes, using the estimated densities and measured [O I]6300 and [S II ]6731 luminosities. The blue-shifted jet exhibits a significantly higher electron temperature and moderately higher ionisation fraction than the red-shifted jet. In contrast to previous studies, we also estimated higher densities in the blue-shifted jet by a factor of ~2. These asymmetries are traced to within 160 au of the source in the line ratio maps. We estimate the mass accretion rate onto the central star and compare this with estimates of the mass outflow rates through each side of the jet. The emission line maps and diagnostic results suggest that the jet asymmetries originate close to the source and are likely to be intrinsic to the jet. Furthermore, the combined dataset offers access to a broad array of accretion tracers. In turn, this enables a more accurate estimation of the mass accretion rate, revealing a value of Macc that is higher by a factor >350 than would otherwise be determined. Supplementary figures and tables are available via a public Zenodo repository (doi:https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13373809).
#### Chemical Evolution during Molecular Cloud Formation Triggered by an Interstellar Shock Wave: Dependence on Shock Parameters and Comparison with Molecular Absorption Lines

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate chemistry in the compression layer behind the interstellar shock waves, where molecular cloud formation starts. We perform three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics simulations of converging flows of atomic gas with shock parameters of inclination between the interstellar magnetic field and the shock wave, pre-shock density, and shock velocity. Then we derive 1D mean-flow models, along which we calculate a detailed gas-grain chemical reaction network as a post process with various chemical parameters, i.e. cosmic-ray ionization rate, abundances of PAHs, and metals in the gas phase. While carbon chains reach their peak abundances when atomic carbon is dominant in the pseudo-time-dependent models of molecular clouds, such behavior is less significant in our models since the visual extinction of the compression layer is low ($\lesssim 1$ mag) when atomic carbon is abundant. Carbon chains, CN, and HCN increase at $A_V \gtrsim 1$ mag, where the gas-phase C/O ratio increases due to water ice formation. Shock parameters affect the physical structure and the evolutional timescale of the compression layer, and thus molecular evolution. Carbon chains are more abundant in models with higher post-shock density and slower gas accumulation. We calculate molecular column densities in the compression layer and compare them with the observations of diffuse and translucent clouds, which show reasonable agreement for water ice, carbon chains, and HCO$^+$. The observed variation of their column densities could be due to the difference in shock parameters and chemical parameters. The column density of CN is overestimated, for which we discuss possible reasons.

 - **Abstract**
 Inferring the coupling of different atmospheric layers requires observing spectral lines sensitive to the atmospheric parameters, particularly the magnetic field vector, at various heights. The best way to tackle this goal is to perform multi-line observations simultaneously. For instance, the new version of the Gregor Infrared Spectrograph instrument offers the possibility to observe the spectral lines at 8542 and 10830 A simultaneously for the first time. The first spectral window contains the Ca II 8542 A spectral line, while the Si I 10827 A transition and He I 10830 A triplet infrared lines can be found in the second spectral window. As the sensitivity to the atmospheric parameters and the height of formation of those transitions is different, combining them can help understand the properties of the solar photosphere and chromosphere and how they are magnetically coupled. Traditionally, the analysis of the Si I 10827 A transition assumes local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), which is not the best approximation to model this transition. Hence, in this work, we examine the potential of performing non-LTE (NLTE) inversions of the full Stokes vector of the Si I 10827 A spectral line. The results indicate that we properly infer the atmospheric parameters through an extended range of atmospheric layers in comparison with the LTE case (only valid for the spectral line wings, i.e., the low photosphere), with no impact on the robustness of the solution and just a minor increase in computational time. Thus, the NLTE assumption will help to accurately constrain the photospheric physical parameters when performing combined inversions with, e.g., the Ca II 8542 A spectral line.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the processes that drive the morphology and kinematics of molecular gas in galaxies is crucial for comprehending star formation and, ultimately, galaxy evolution. Using data obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), we study the behavior of the warm molecular gas at temperatures of hundreds of Kelvin and the cold molecular gas at tens of Kelvin in the galaxy MCG$-$05$-$23$-$16, which hosts an active galactic nucleus (AGN). Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images of this spheroidal galaxy, classified in the optical as S0, show a dust lane resembling a nuclear spiral and a surrounding ring. These features are also detected in CO(2$-$1) and H2, and their morphologies and kinematics are consistent with rotation plus local inward gas motions along the kinematic minor axis in the presence of a nuclear bar. The H2 transitions 0-0 S(3), 0-0 S(4), and 0-0 S(5), which trace warmer and more excited gas, show more disrupted kinematics than 0-0 S(1) and 0-0 S(2), including clumps of high-velocity dispersion (of up to $\sim$ 160 km/s), in regions devoid of CO(2$-$1). The kinematics of one of these clumps, located at $\sim$ 350 pc westward from the nucleus, are consistent with outflowing gas, possibly driven by localized star formation traced by Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) emission at 11.3 ${\mu}$m. Overall, we observe a stratification of the molecular gas, with the colder gas located in the nuclear spiral, ring, and connecting arms, while most warmer gas with higher velocity-dispersion fills the inter-arm space. The compact jet, approximately 200 pc in size, detected with Very Large Array (VLA) observations, does not appear to significantly affect the distribution and kinematics of the molecular gas, possibly due to its limited intersection with the molecular gas disc.

 Around 50 years ago, the famous bet between Stephen Hawking and Kip Thorne on whether Cyg X-1 hosts a stellar-mass black hole became a well-known story in the history of black hole science. Today, Cyg X-1 is widely recognised as hosting a stellar-mass black hole with a mass of approximately 20 solar masses. With the advancement of X-ray telescopes, Cyg X-1 has become a prime laboratory for studies in stellar evolution, accretion physics, and high-energy plasma physics. In this review, we explore the latest results from X-ray observations of Cyg X-1, focusing on its implications for black hole spin, its role in stellar evolution, the geometry of the innermost accretion regions, and the plasma physics insights derived from its X-ray emissions. This review primarily focuses on Cyg X-1; however, the underlying physics applies to other black hole X-ray binaries and, to some extent, to AGNs.

 - **Abstract**
 Radio halos of edge-on galaxies are crucial for investigating cosmic ray propagation and magnetic field structures in galactic environments. We present VLA C-configuration S-band (2--4 GHz) observations of the spiral galaxy NGC 3556, a target from the Continuum Halos in Nearby Galaxies - an EVLA Survey (CHANG-ES). We estimate the thermal contribution to the radio emission from a combination of the H$\alpha$ and mid-IR data, and employ Rotation Measure Synthesis to reveal the magnetic field structures. In our data, NGC 3556 exhibits a box-like radio halo extending nearly 7 kpc from the galactic plane. The scale height of the total S-band intensity in the halo is $1.68\pm 0.29$ kpc, while that of the non-thermal intensity is $1.93\pm 0.28$ kpc. Fitting the data to a 1-D cosmic-ray transport model, we find advection to describe the cosmic-ray propagation within the halo better than diffusion, with advection speeds of $245 \pm 15$ km s$^{-1}$ and $205 \pm 25$ km s$^{-1}$ above and below the disk, respectively. The magnetic field is detected patchily across the galaxy, displaying a toroidal configuration in the rotation measure map. The mean equipartition magnetic field strength is approximately $8.3\ \mu$G in the disk and $4.5\ \mu$G in the halo. In addition, a bubble-like structure extends nearly 3~kpc into the southern halo, aligned with the polarized intensity and H$\alpha$ image, suggestive of superwinds generated by recent star formation feedback in the nuclear region.

 - **Abstract**
 The gravitational potential decay rate (DR) is caused by the cosmic acceleration of the universe, providing a direct probe into the existence of dark energy (DE). We present measurements of DR and explore its implications for DE models using the Data Release 9 galaxy catalog of DESI imaging surveys and the Planck cosmic microwave background maps. Our analysis includes six redshift bins within the range of $0.2\le z<1.4$ and achieves a total significance of 3.1$\sigma$, extending the DR measurements to a much higher redshift comparing to Dong et al. (2022), which focused on $0.2\le z<0.8$. Other improvements involve addressing potential systematics in the DR-related measurements of correlation functions, including imaging systematics and magnification bias. We explore the constraining power of DR both the $w$CDM model and the $w_0w_a$CDM model. We find that, the addition of DR can significantly improves DE constraints, over Sloan Digital Sky Survey baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data alone or PantheonPlus supernovae (SNe) compilation alone, although it shows only a modest improvement for DESI BAO. In the $w$CDM model, all three probes-DR, DESI BAO and SNe-favor $w=-1$. For the $w_0w_a$CDM, while DESI BAO prefers $w_0>-1$ and $w_a<0$, SNe Ia and DR data constrain $w_0=-0.94^{+0.11}_{-0.13}$ and $w_a=-0.22^{+0.57}_{-0.97}$. Namely SNe Ia and DR data has no preference on dynamical dark energy over $\Lambda$.

 General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) simulations are an indispensable tool in studying accretion onto compact objects. The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) frequently uses libraries of ideal GRMHD simulations to interpret polarimetric, event-horizon-scale observations of supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies. In this work, we present a library of ten non-radiative, ideal GRMHD simulations that were utilized by the EHT Collaboration in their analysis of Sagittarius A*. The parameter survey explores both low (SANE) and high (MAD) magnetization states across five black hole spins $a_{*}=-15/16,-1/2,0,+1/2,+15/16$ where each simulation was run out to $30,000\hspace{0.1cm}\mathrm{GM/c}^{3}$. We find the angular momentum and energy flux in SANE simulations closely matches the thin-disk value, with minor deviations in prograde models due to fluid forces. This leads to spin equilibrium around $a_{*}\sim0.94$, consistent with previous studies. We study the flow of conserved quantities in our simulations and find mass, angular momentum, and energy transport in SANE accretion flows to be primarily inward and fluid-dominated. MAD models produce powerful jets with outflow efficiency $>1$ for $a_{*}=+0.94$, leading to black hole spin-down in prograde cases. We observe outward directed energy and angular momentum fluxes on the horizon, as expected for the Blandford-Znajek mechanism. MAD accretion flows are sub-Keplerian and exhibit greater variability than their SANE counterpart. They are also hotter than SANE disks within $r\lesssim 10\hspace{0.1cm}\mathrm{GM/c}^{2}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding and predicting the structure and evolution of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) in the heliosphere remains one of the most sought-after goals in heliophysics and space weather research. A powerful tool for improving current knowledge and capabilities consists of multi-spacecraft observations of the same event, which take place when two or more spacecraft fortuitously find themselves in the path of a single CME. Multi-probe events can not only supply useful data to evaluate the large-scale of CMEs from 1D in-situ trajectories, but also provide additional constraints and validation opportunities for CME propagation models. In this work, we analyse and simulate the coronal and heliospheric evolution of a slow, streamer-blowout CME that erupted on 23 September 2021 and was encountered in situ by four spacecraft approximately equally distributed in heliocentric distance between 0.4 and 1 au. We employ the Open Solar Physics Rapid Ensemble Information (OSPREI) modelling suite in ensemble mode to predict the CME arrival and structure in a hindcast fashion and to compute the "best-fit" solutions at the different spacecraft individually and together. We find that the spread in the predicted quantities increases with heliocentric distance, suggesting that there may be a maximum (angular and radial) separation between an inner and an outer probe beyond which estimates of the in-situ magnetic field orientation (parameterised by flux rope model geometry) increasingly diverge. We discuss the importance of these exceptional observations and the results of our investigation in the context of advancing our understanding of CME structure and evolution as well as improving space weather forecasts.

 - **Abstract**
 The aim of this study is to identify quiescent galaxies in the 2-deg$^2$ COSMOS field at $z \sim 3.1$ and analyze their environment. Using data from the ODIN survey and COSMOS2020 catalog, we identify 24 massive quiescent galaxies (MQGs) with stellar masses $\geq 10^{10.6}$ and derive their star formation histories and quenching timescales using SED fitting with BAGPIPES. Voronoi-based density maps trace local and large-scale environments using Lyman-$\alpha$ Emitters and photometric galaxies. Results indicate uniformly short quenching timescales ($<$500 Myr) independent of environmental density, suggesting rapid internal mechanisms such as AGN feedback dominate over environmental factors. MQGs do not correlate with protoclusters or filaments, although some are near gas-rich filaments but show no rejuvenation. These findings suggest quenching at high redshift is driven primarily by internal processes rather than environmental interactions.
