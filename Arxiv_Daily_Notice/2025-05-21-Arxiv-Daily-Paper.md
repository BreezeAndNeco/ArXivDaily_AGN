 - **Abstract**
 It remains an open question whether the binary black hole mergers observed with gravitational-wave detectors originate from the evolution of isolated massive binary stars or were dynamically driven by perturbations from the environment. Recent evidence for non-zero orbital eccentricity in a handful of events is seen as support for a non-negligible fraction of the population experiencing external driving of the merger. However, it is unclear from which formation channel eccentric binary black-hole mergers would originate: dense star clusters, hierarchical field triples, active galactic nuclei, or wide binaries in the Galaxy could all be culprits. Here, we investigate whether the spin properties of eccentric mergers could be used to break this degeneracy. Using the fact that different formation channels are predicted to either produce eccentric mergers with mutually aligned or randomly oriented black-hole spins, we investigate how many confident detections would be needed in order for the two models to be statistically distinguishable. If a few percent of binary black hole mergers retain measurable eccentricity in the bandwidth of ground-based detectors, we report a $\sim40\,\%$ chance that we could confidently distinguish both models after the fifth observing run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detector network, $\sim80\,\%$ for LIGO A#, and $\sim98\,\%$ for the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer.

 - **Abstract**
 Boxy/peanut (b/p) or X-shaped bulges have been extensively explored with theory and numerical simulations of isolated galaxies. However, it is only recently that advances in hydrodynamical cosmological simulations have made it possible to explore b/p bulges in a cosmological setting, with much remaining to be understood about their formation and evolution. By using the Auriga magneto-hydrodynamical cosmological zoom-in simulations, we characterise the structural parameters of b/p bulges and how they form and evolve throughout cosmic history. We develop a method for estimating the b/p strength that allows us to identify the formation time and size of these structures. We find that b/p bulges in Auriga form between $\sim 1.1-1.6\, \mathrm Gyr$ after bar formation, following a `buckling' episode; some galaxies undergo multiple bucklings and events of b/p growth, with some b/p structures `dissolving' between buckling events. We find that at $z=0$, the b/p bulges have an extent of almost half the bar length. Finally, we analyse the evolution of the b/p fraction over redshift, finding that at $z=0$, two thirds of galaxies host a bar, and of these, $45$ per cent have a b/p. This b/p fraction is within the observed range at $z=0$, although on the low end as compared to some observational studies. The b/p fraction decreases to $20$ per cent at $z=0.5$, and falls to zero at $z \sim 1$; this is in line with the observed trend of declining b/p fraction with redshift. We discuss possible culprits for the apparent mismatch in b/p occurrence between observations and cosmological simulations, what causes them to form (or not) in these simulations, and what this might reveal about models of galaxy formation and evolution.
#### The High-redshift Blazar MG3 J163554+3629: Physical Properties and the Enigma of Its Unexpected Supermassive Black Hole Growth

 - **Abstract**
 There is general consensus that active galactic nuclei (AGNs) derive their radiating power from a supermassive black hole (SMBH) that accretes matter. Yet, their precise powering mechanisms and the resulting growth of the SMBH are poorly understood, especially for AGNs at high redshift. Blazars are AGNs pointing their jet toward the observer, thus being detectable from radio through gamma rays at high redshift due to Doppler boosting. The blazar MG3 J163554+3629 is located at redshift z=3.65 and it is a flat spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ). In this work, we show the results of the modeling of its spectral energy distribution (SED) from radio to gamma rays with a one-zone leptonic model. We estimate the uncertainties through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach. As a result, we infer the black hole mass M_BH = 1.1(+0.2,-0.1) x 10^9 Msun and a modest magnetic field of B = 6.56(+0.13,-0.09) x 10^-2 G in line with the Compton dominance observed in high-redshift FSRQs. The emitting region is outside the broad line region but within the region of the dust torus radius. The rather small accretion efficiency of eta=0.083 is not solely inferred through the SED modeling but also through the energetics. An evolution study suggests that in an Eddington-limited accretion process the SMBH did not have time enough to grow from an initial seed mass of ~10^6 Msun at z~30 into a mass of M_BH ~ 10^9 Msun at z=3.65. Faster mass growth might be obtained in a super-Eddington process throughout frequent episodes. Alternative scenarios propose that the existence of the jet itself can facilitate a more rapid growth.

 - **Abstract**
 Planet formation around young stars requires the growth of interstellar dust grains from mm-sized particles to km-sized planetesimals. Numerical simulations have shown that large ($\sim$mm-sized) grains found in the inner envelope of young protostars could be lifted from the disc via winds. However we are still lacking unambiguous evidence for large grains in protostellar winds/outflows. We investigate dust continuum emission in the envelope of the Class I binary L1551 IRS5 in the Taurus molecular cloud, aiming to identify observational signatures of grain growth, such as variations in the dust emissivity index ($\beta_{\rm mm}$). In this context, we present new, high-angular resolution (50 au), observations of thermal dust continuum emission at 1.3 mm and 3 mm in the envelope ($\sim$3000 au) of L1551 IRS5 , obtained as part of the ALMA-FAUST Large Program. We analyse dust emission along the cavity walls of the CO outflow, extended up to $\sim$1800 au. We find an H$_2$ volume density $>2\times10^5$ cm$^{-3}$, a dust mass of $\sim$58 M$_\oplus$, and $\beta_{\rm mm}$<1, implying the presence of grains $\sim$10$^3$ times larger than the typical ISM sizes. We provide the first spatially resolved observational evidence of large grains within an outflow cavity wall. Our results suggest that these grains have been transported from the inner disc to the envelope by protostellar winds and may subsequently fall back into the outer disc by gravity and/or via accretion streamers. This cycle provides longer time for grains to grow, playing a crucial role in the formation of planetesimals.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic rays (CRs) are a pivotal non-thermal component of galaxy formation and evolution. However, the intricacies of CR physics, particularly how they propagate in the circumgalactic medium (CGM), remain largely unconstrained. In this work, we study CGM properties in FIRE-2 (Feedback In Realistic Environments) simulations of the same Milky Way (MW)-mass halo at $z=0$ with different CR transport models that produce similar diffuse $\sim$ GeV $\gamma$-ray emission. We study the gas morphology and thermal properties, and generate synthetic observations of rest-frame UV ion absorption columns and X-ray emission. CRs lower galaxy masses and star formation rates (SFRs) while supporting more cool CGM gas, which boosts the HI and OVI column densities in the CGM, bringing simulations more in line with observations, but there can be large differences between CR transport models and resolution levels. X-ray emission within and close to galaxies is consistent with thermal (free-free and metal-line) emission plus X-ray binaries, while more extended ($\sim 100\,$kpc) CGM emission is potentially dominated by inverse Compton (IC) scattering, motivating future work on the spatially resolved X-ray profiles. Although comparisons with observations are sensitive to sample selection and mimicking the details of observations, and our analysis did not result in strong constraints on CR models, the differences between simulations are significant and could be used as a framework for future studies.

 - **Abstract**
 Several assumptions at the foundation of the standard cosmological model have as a direct consequence a specific relation between cosmological distances, known as the distance duality relation, whose violation would be a smoking gun of deviations from standard cosmology. We explore the role of upcoming gravitational wave observations in investigating possible deviations from the distance duality relation, alongside the more commonly used supernovae. We find that, when combined with baryon acoustic oscillations, gravitational waves will provide similar constraining power to the combination of baryon acoustic oscillations and supernovae. Moreover, the combination of observables with different sensitivities to electromagnetic and gravitational physics provides a promising way to discriminate among different physical mechanisms that could lead to violations of the distance duality relation.

 - **Abstract**
 The GLEAM 4-Jy (G4Jy) Sample is a thorough compilation of the 'brightest' radio sources in the southern sky (Declination < 30 deg), as measured at 151 MHz (S > 4.0 Jy) with the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), through the GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky MWA (GLEAM) Survey. In addition to flux-density measurements, the G4Jy catalogue provides host-galaxy identifications (through careful visual-inspection) and four sets of spectral indices. Despite their brightness in the radio, many of these sources are poorly-studied, with the vast majority lacking a spectroscopic redshift in published work. This is crucial for studying the intrinsic properties of the sources, and so we conduct a multi-semester observing campaign on the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT), with optical spectroscopy enabling us to provide new redshifts to the astronomical community. Initial results show that not all of the host galaxies exhibit emission-line spectra in the optical (~4500-7500 Ang), which illustrates the importance of radio-frequency selection (rather than optical selection) for creating an unbiased sample of active galactic nuclei. By combining SALT redshifts with those from the 6-degree Field Galaxy Survey (6dFGS) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we calculate radio luminosities and linear sizes for 299 G4Jy sources (which includes one newly-discovered giant radio-galaxy, G4Jy 604). Furthermore, with the highest redshift acquired (so far) being z ~ 2.2 from SDSS, we look forward to evolution studies of this complete sample, as well as breaking degeneracies in radio properties with respect to, for example, the galaxy environment.

 - **Abstract**
 In the past two decades, significant advancements have been made in observational techniques to enhance our understanding of the universe and its evolutionary processes. However, our knowledge of the post-inflation reheating phase remains limited due to its small-scale dynamics. Traditional observations, such as those of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), primarily provide insights into large-scale dynamics, making it challenging to glean information about the reheating era. In this paper, our primary aim is to explore how the generation of Gravitational Waves (GWs) spectra, resulting from electromagnetic fields in the early universe, can offer valuable insights into the Reheating dynamics. We investigate how the spectral shape of GWs varies across different frequency ranges, depending on the initial magnetic profile and reheating dynamics. For this, we consider a well-known non-helical magnetogenesis model, where the usual electromagnetic kinetic term is coupled with a background scalar. Notably, for such a scenario, we observe distinct spectral shapes with sufficiently high amplitudes for different reheating histories with the equation of state parametrized by ($w_{\rm re}$). We identify spectral breaks in the GW spectra for both $w_{\rm re}<1/3$ and $w_{\rm re}>1/3$ scenarios. We find that future GW experiments such as BBO, LISA, SKA, and DECIGO are well within the reach of observing those distinct spectral shapes and can potentially shed light on the underlying mechanism of the reheating phase.

 - **Abstract**
 We present theoretical arguments toward the plausibility of a stellar wind}to explain the 16000\,km\,$s^{-1}$ line broadening in the optical spectra of WS 35, the central star in the Pa 30 nebula. The wind model is discussed in the context of super-Eddington flows. We argue that WS 35 potentially occupies a new regime of wind driving theory as the first metal-only wind. While this framework provides a promising avenue for explaining the high speed flow, questions remain about the source's true nature. We further describe how future radio observations can provide an independent test of the spherical wind scenario. A magnetically channeled wind would likely produce a relatively flat and bright radio spectral energy distributions. By contrast a spherical wind should result in a thermal radio spectrum with a canonical continuum slope of $\nu^{0.6}$, and a brightness level consistent with the currently predicted mass-loss rate.

 - **Abstract**
 Most observational studies of galactic-scale magnetic fields using Faraday rotation rely on estimates of thermal electron densities in galaxies and their radial variations. However, the spatial distribution of electrons in the interstellar medium (ISM) is not clearly known. In this study, we propose and utilize collision-excited doublet emission line ratios of [S\,\textsc{ii}] $\lambda\lambda$ 6716, 6731 Å~and [O\,\textsc{ii}] $\lambda\lambda$ 3726, 3729 Å\ to estimate the electron densities ($n_e$). To map their distribution in the galaxies, we employ Integral Field Unit (IFU) spectroscopic observations from the SDSS Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) survey, utilising data products from both the \texttt{Pipe3D} and MaNGA Data Analysis Pipeline (DAP). We present a spatially resolved analysis of $13$ face-on galaxies (inclination, $i \leq 10^\circ$), including $9$ star-forming galaxies (SFGs) and $4$ Non-SFGs. Azimuthally averaged radial profiles of $n_e$ are obtained using two different binning schemes: linear and non-linear. For the \texttt{Pipe3D} case, both SFGs and non-SFGs exhibit $n_e$ gradients, with higher densities of $n_e$(S\,\textsc{ii}) = $165.6 \pm 20.8$ cm$^{-3}$ in the inner disk region (r/R$_e$ $\leq$ 1.5), which decrease to $31 \pm 4.5$ cm$^{-3}$ in the outer disk region (r/R$_e$ $>$ 1.5). We also translate $n_e$ to the electron column density $N_e$ assuming an evenly distributed thin disk profile, fairly excluding the central bulge regions. These electron density estimates at different radii provide valuable insights for resolving ambiguities in current and future studies of magnetic fields in galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 A set of analytic solutions for the plunging region thermodynamics have been developed recently under the assumption that the fluid undergoes a gravity-dominated geodesic plunge into the black hole. We test this model against a dedicated 3D global GRMHD simulation of a thin accretion disc around a Schwarzschild black hole using the code AthenaK. Provided that we account for non-adiabatic heating in the energetics, plausibly from grid-scale magnetic dissipation, we find an excellent agreement between the analytic model and the simulated quantities. These results are particularly important for existing and future electromagnetic black hole spin measurements, many of which do not to include the plunging fluid in their emission modelling. This exclusion typically stems from the assumption of a zero-stress boundary condition at the ISCO, forcing all thermodynamic quantities to vanish. Instead, we find a non-zero $\delta_\mathcal{J}\approx 5.3 \%$ drop in the angular momentum over the plunging region, which is consistent with both prior simulations and observations. We demonstrate that this stress is small enough for the dynamics of the fluid in the plunging region to be well-described by geodesic trajectories, yet large enough to cause measurable dissipation near to the ISCO - keeping thermodynamic quantities from vanishing. In the plunging region, constant $\alpha$-disc models are a physically inappropriate framework.
#### CHANG-ES: XXXVI. The thin and thick radio discs

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Edge-on spiral galaxies give us an outsiders' view of the radio halo, which envelops these galaxies. The radio halos are caused by extra-planar cosmic-ray electrons that emit synchrotron emission in magnetic fields. Aims. We aim to study the origin of radio halos around galaxies and infer the role of cosmic-rays in supporting the gaseous discs. We would like to test the influence of star formation as the main source of cosmic rays as well as other fundamental galaxy properties such as mass and size. Methods. We present a study of radio continuum scale heights in 22 nearby edge-on galaxies from the CHANG-ES survey. We employ deep observations with the Jansky Very Large Array in the S-band (2-4 GHz), imaging at 7" angular resolution. We measure scale heights in three strips within the effective radio continuum radius, correcting for the influence of angular resolution and inclination angle. We include only galaxies where a distinction between the two disc components can be made in at least one of the strips, providing us with robust measurements of both scale heights. Results. We find a strong positive correlation between scale heights of the thin and thick discs and star-forming radius as well as star-formation rate (SFR); moderately strong correlations are found for the mass surface density and the ratio of SFR-to-mass surface density; no correlation is found with SFR surface density alone. Yet the SFR surface density plays a role as well: galaxies with high SFR surface densities have a rather roundish shape, whereas galaxies with little star formation show only a relatively small vertical extent in comparison to their size. Conclusions. Thick gaseous discs are partially supported by cosmic-ray pressure. Our results are a useful benchmark for simulations of galaxy evolution that include cosmic rays.
#### Quantifying Chromosphere Response to Flare Energy Release Using AIA Observations in 1600~Å and 304~Å Passbands

 - **Abstract**
 Imaging observations of the solar lower atmosphere by the Atmosphere Imaging Assembly (AIA) have been mostly used as the context, and their quantitative information has been much less explored. The chromosphere responds rapidly to energy release by magnetic reconnection during flares. Furthermore, a flare is a collection of multiple energy release events that can be identified in spatially resolved chromosphere observations. In this paper, we conduct a statistical and semi-quantitative study of the relative photometry in the UV 1600~Å and EUV 304~Å passbands for 18 flares observed by AIA. In each flare, we have identified thousands of flare ribbon pixels in the UV 1600~Å images, and measured their brightness (counts per second) and the rise and decay timescales, which are indicative of heating properties in flare loops. The analysis shows that bright flare pixels, characterized by peak brightness larger than ten times the quiescent brightness, exhibit sharp light curves with the half rise time below 2 min, followed by a two-phase decay with a rapid decay on timescales comparable to the rise time and then a more gradual decay. Flare ribbon pixels identified in both UV 1600 ~Å and EUV 304~Å images exhibit similar time profiles during the rise, and their peak brightness appear to be related by a power law. Our analysis shows that AIA observed flare brightness in UV 1600~Å relative to the quiescent brightness is a meaningful measurement of the flare chromosphere photometry, and AIA observations for over a decade thus provide a unique and extensive database for systematic and semi-quantitative study of flaring chromosphere, either in the context of the Sun as a star, or in spatially resolved manner that helps to probe the nature of flare energy release on elementary scales.

 - **Abstract**
 Up to 40% of galaxies in the local universe host a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (LLAGN), making it vital to understand this mode of black hole accretion. However, the presence or absence of Seyfert-like geometries - an accretion disk close to the black hole, an optical broad line region (BLR), and a molecular torus - remains uncertain owing to the low flux levels of sources within this class. Herein, we present an analysis of a XRISM/Resolve spectrum of M81*, the LLAGN in the heart of the nearby spiral galaxy M81. A weak, neutral Fe K emission line is detected and resolved into K$_{\alpha,1}$ and K$_{\alpha,2}$ components. It shows a negligible velocity shift, and weak broadening (FWHM$=460^{+260}_{-160}~{\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1}$) that corresponds to an inner emission radius of ${\rm r} \geq 2.7\times 10^{4}~GM/c^{2}$ for likely inclinations. The Fe K$_{\alpha}$ line likely traces a torus. The upper limit on additional splitting of the Fe K$_{\alpha}$ line components translates to a limit on the local magnetic field of ${\rm B} \leq 3.5\times 10^{8}$ Gauss, assuming Zeeman splitting. The spectra also reveal ionized plasma(s) through He-like Fe XXV and H-like Fe XXVI emission lines. These can be fit equally well assuming photoionization and collisional excitation. The H-like Fe XXVI line is better described when a second component is included with a red-shift of ${\rm v} = 1600~{\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1}$, but this addition is of marginal statistical significance. We discuss these results in the context of radiatively inefficient accretion flow models, magnetically arrested disks, and possible links to the Fermi bubbles in the Milky Way.

 - **Abstract**
 Coronal bright points are typical small-scale coronal brightenings that consist of a bundle of miniature coronal loops. Using the ultra-high-resolution coronal images from the Extreme Ultraviolet Image onboard Solar Obiter, we report the first observational evidence of oscillatory magnetic reconnection at a coronal bright point (CBP). The reconnection is characterised by two bursty phases defined by a reconnection reversal. In the first phase, a current sheet (C1) is found to form in front of an expanding loop of the bright point. Interestingly, C1 shorten to a null point during 10 minutes after reaching its maximum length (~2.4Mm). Less than 3 minutes later, a new current sheet (C2) was clearly seen to grow out from the null point, but along an orthogonal direction relative to C1. C2 reached a maximum length of ~4 Mm in ten minutes and then has become short and invisible in the next few minutes as the reconnection has declined. The magnetic reconnection is evidenced by the brightening, plasma flow and temperature increase at the ends of both C1 and C2. No significant magnetic cancellation or emergence but gradual convergence has occurred during a few hours before the reconnection underneath the CBP. The transition from C1 to C2 suggests the occurrence of coronal oscillatory reconnection with once reconnection reversal, whereby the inflow and outflow regions in the first phase become the outflow and inflow regions in the second phase, respectively. It is further found that the oscillatory reconnection could slightly modulate the change in brightness of the coronal bright point.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent studies of individual track-like TeV-PeV IceCube neutrino events suggest that strongly jetted AGNs, blazars, can be plausible sources of extragalactic high-energy neutrinos. Although the broadband emission and neutrinos from such blazars can be modeled by hadronic jets with inverse Compton processes, various models show degeneracies. One of the reasons is the lack of high-resolution observations pinpointing the location and physical conditions of neutrino-emitting plasma. Here, we present a VLBI study of PKS 0735+178 that was recently associated with a high energy neutrino event IceCube-211208A (IC211208) as well as alerts from other neutrino observatories. We analyzed publicly available VLBA 15 and 43 GHz data of 0735+178 during 2020-2024, resolving the mas-scale jet and tracing its time evolution in flux and structure, before and after IC211208. We find significant enhancements in the radio flux density, apparent brightness temperature, and synchrotron opacity at 15-43 GHz of the VLBI nuclear region after IC211208, strengthening the temporal correlation between 0735+178 and IC211208. Furthermore, we find that the source ejected a new VLBI component C2 from the VLBI core before IC211208. C2 traveled further downstream at ~4.2c apparent speed, close to the historical maximum speed for this object. C2 then passed a subluminally moving feature in the jet C1 located at ~0.13 mas (~0.77 pc) downstream the core at the time of IC211208. The time of this apparent passage is statistically coincident with the time of IC211208 within 1sigma uncertainty, suggesting the location of this apparent passage to be a probable spatial origin of IC211208. We discuss the physical implications of these findings.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive stars can form within or be captured by AGN disks, influencing both the thermal structure and metallicity of the disk environment. In a previous work, we investigated isotropic accretion onto massive stars from a gas-rich, high-entropy background. Here, we consider a more realistic scenario by incorporating the stratified geometry of the background disk in our 3D radiation hydrodynamic simulatons. We find that accretion remains relatively isotropic when the disk is hot enough and the scale height is thicker than the accretion flow's nominal supersonic critical radius $R{crit}$ (sub-thermal). However, when the disk becomes cold, the accretion flow becomes significantly anisotropic (super-thermal). Escaping stellar and accretion luminosity can drive super-Eddington outflows in the polar region, while rapid accretion is sustained along the midplane. Eventually, the effective cross-section is constrained by the Hill radius and the disk scale height rather than the critical radius when the disk is cold enough. For our setup (stellar mass $\sim 50 M\odot$ and background density $\rho\sim 10^{-10}$ g/cm$^3$) the accretion rates is capped below $\sim 0.02M\odot$/year and the effective accretion parameter $\alpha\sim 10^{-1}$ over disk temperature range $3 - 7 \times 10^4$ K. Spiral arms facilitate inward mass flux by driving outward angular momentum transport. Gap-opening effects may further reduce the long-term accretion rate, albeit to confirm which requires global simulations evolved over much longer viscous timescales.

 - **Abstract**
 The formation of double-decker filaments has long been an enigma in the field of solar physics. Using stereoscopic observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory and the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory, we show that the double-decker filament formed on 2013 August 30 resulted from the splitting of a braided magnetic flux rope. The splitting was driven by component magnetic reconnection between intertwined field lines, triggered by the rotational motion in a part of one filament footpoint. This mechanism, inferred from observed small jets, brightenings, and bidirectional mass flows, differs from the previous conclusion attributing filament splitting to magnetic reconnection between the legs of confining magnetic field lines within or above the filament. The splitting speed might be modulated by the reconnection speed, as evidenced by the correspondence between the filament's slow and fast rising phases and the intermittent and violent brightening stages. Following the splitting, the upper branch of the double-decker filament erupted as a coronal mass ejection (CME), giving rise to a GOES soft X-ray M1.2 flare. In conclusion, our observations present a new formation mechanism for double-decker filaments, and the subsequent partial eruption is likely attributable to the torus instability of the background coronal magnetic field. Moreover, the detection of small jets within the filament provides new insights into the role of component magnetic reconnection in localized coronal heating processes.

 - **Abstract**
 Cometary activity is a compelling subject of study, with thermophysical models playing a pivotal role in its understanding. However, traditional numerical solutions for small body thermophysical models are computationally intensive, posing challenges for investigations requiring high-resolution or repetitive modeling. To address this limitation, we employed a machine learning approach to develop ThermoONet - a neural network designed to predict the temperature and water ice sublimation flux of comets. Performance evaluations indicate that ThermoONet achieves a low average error in subsurface temperature of approximately 2% relative to the numerical simulation, while reducing computational time by nearly six orders of magnitude. We applied ThermoONet to model the water activity of comets 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and 21P/Giacobini-Zinner. By successfully fitting the water production rate curves of these comets, as obtained by the Rosetta mission and the SOHO telescope, respectively, we demonstrate the network's effectiveness and efficiency. Furthermore, when combined with a global optimization algorithm, ThermoONet proves capable of retrieving the physical properties of target bodies.

 - **Abstract**
 Slitless spectroscopy is a traditional method for selecting quasars. In this paper, we develop a procedure for selecting quasars (QSOs) using the 3D-HST G141 slitless spectra. We initially identify over 6,000 sources with emission lines broader than those typically found in emission line galaxies (ELGs) by analyzing the 1D spectra. These ``broad'' emission lines may originate from actual QSO broad lines ($\rm FWHM\geq1200~\rm km/s$) or the convolved narrow lines ($\rm FWHM = 200\sim 300\rm km/s$) in ELGs with effective radii $\geq$0.3" (2.5Kpc at z=1). We then propose a criterion based on the reliability of the QSO component in the forward modeling results. Using the known QSOs, ELGs, and simulation spectra, we find that our criterion successfully selects about 90\% of known QSOs with H$\alpha$ or H$\beta$ line detection and point-like structures, with an ELG contamination rate of about 5\%. We apply this method to emission line sources without significant contamination and select 19 QSO candidates at redshift $z=0.12-1.56$. 12 of these candidates have Chandra X-ray detections. This sample covers a broader range of the rest-frame UV colors and has redder optical slopes compared to the SDSS QSOs, yet it is more likely to be composed of normal QSOs rather than little red dots. Through spectral analysis, the estimated black hole masses of the sample are $10^{6.9}-10^{8.3} M_{\odot}$. Our new candidates improve the completeness of the QSO sample at $z=0.8-1.6$ in the 3D-HST field. The proposed method will also be helpful for QSO selections via slitless spectroscopy in Euclid and the Chinese Space Station Telescope.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic fields play a significant role in star-forming processes on core to clump scales. We investigate magnetic field orientations and strengths in the massive star-forming clump P2 within the filamentary infrared dark cloud G28.34+0.06 using dust polarization observations made using SCUBA-2/POL-2 on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope as part of the B-field In STar-forming Region Observations (BISTRO) survey. We compare the magnetic field orientations at the clump scale of ~2 parsecs from these JCMT observations with those at the core scale of ~0.2 parsecs from archival ALMA data, finding that the magnetic field orientations on these two different scales are perpendicular to one another. We estimate the distribution of magnetic field strengths, which range from 50 to 430 {\mu}G over the clump. The region forming the core shows the highest magnetic field strength. We also obtain the distribution of mass-to-flux ratios across the clump. In the region surrounding the core, the mass-to-flux ratio is larger than 1, which indicates the magnetic field strength is insufficient to support the region against gravitational collapse. Therefore, the change in the magnetic field orientation from clump to core scales may be the result of gravitational collapse, with the field being pulled inward along with the flow of material under gravity.

 - **Abstract**
 A major challenge in solar physics is to obtain empirical information on the magnetic field of the million-degree plasma of the solar corona. To this end, we need observables of the solar radiation sensitive to the coronal magnetic field. The most familiar observables are the polarization signals of visible and near-infrared forbidden lines of highly ionized species and some ultraviolet permitted lines, like hydrogen Lyman-{\alpha}. While the coronal radiation in these spectral lines can only be detected for off-limb line of sights, the coronal radiation from permitted extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lines can be observed also on the solar disk. These coronal lines are mainly collisionally excited, but it has been pointed out that some permitted EUV lines can actually be linearly polarized if their lower level carries atomic alignment, and that their linear polarization is sensitive to the orientation of the coronal magnetic field (see Manso Sainz & Trujillo Bueno 2009). Here we theoretically investigate the linear polarization in permitted EUV lines of a variety of ions: Fe X, Fe XI, Fe XIII, Fe XIV, Si IX, and Si X. To this end, we have developed a numerical code, which we have applied to investigate the linear polarization and magnetic sensitivity of many permitted EUV lines in a one-dimensional model of the solar corona, providing a list of the most promising lines to be further investigated for polarimetry with future space telescopes. Our next step will be to extend this work by using state-of-the-art three-dimensional coronal models.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are bright and short radio flashes of cosmological origin. Although a great number of FRBs were detected in the last two decades, their progenitors and the physical processes that create them are unknown. In recent years, magnetars have been proposed as one of the leading progenitor candidates. A striking feature that can hint at such a magnetar origin is second-scale periodicity. In this paper, we define a robust procedure to search for such periodicity and estimate the significance of its results. We search for such periodicity in the bursts of FRB 20201124A, observed by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST) between April and June 2021. Our analysis does not find any significant periodicity. We discuss the differences between our non-detection and the ~1.7s periodicity claim by C. Du et al. (2025).

 - **Abstract**
 The morphology of circular polarisation profiles from solar spectropolarimetric observations encode information about the magnetic field strength, inclination, and line-of-sight velocity gradients. Previous studies used manual methods or unsupervised machine learning (ML) to classify the shapes of circular polarisation profiles. We trained a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) comparing classifications with unsupervised ML. The method was tested on quiet Sun datasets from DKIST, Hinode, and GREGOR, as well as simulations of granulation and a sunspot. We achieve validation metrics typically close to or above $90\%$. We also present the first statistical analysis of quiet Sun DKIST/ViSP data using inversions and our supervised classifier. We demonstrate that classifications with unsupervised ML alone can introduce systemic errors that could compromise statistical comparisons. DKIST and Hinode classifications in the quiet Sun are similar, despite our modelling indicating spatial resolution differences should alter the shapes of circular polarization signals. Asymmetrical (symmetrical) profiles are less (more) common in GREGOR than DKIST or Hinode data, consistent with narrower response functions in the $1564.85$ nm line. Single-lobed profiles are extremely rare in GREGOR data. In the sunspot simulation, the $630.25$ nm line produces ``double' profiles in the penumbra, likely a manifestation of magneto-optical effects in horizontal fields; these are rarer in the $1564.85$ nm line. We find the $1564.85$ nm line detects more reverse polarity magnetic fields in the penumbra in contradiction to observations. We detect mixed-polarity profiles in nearly one fifth of the penumbra. Supervised ML robustly classifies solar spectropolarimetric data, enabling detailed statistical analyses of magnetic fields.

 - **Abstract**
 The H~{\sc i} gas distribution in damped Lyman $\alpha$ absorbers (DLAs) has remained elusive due to the point-source nature of background quasar emission. Observing DLAs against spatially extended background galaxies provides a new method for constraining their size and structure. Using the Keck Cosmic Web Imager, we present the first ``silhouette'' image of a DLA at $z=3.34$, identified in the spectrum of a background galaxy at $z=3.61$. Although the silhouette remains unresolved due to limited spatial resolution, this represents a successful proof-of-concept for studying DLA morphology using extended background sources. Possible residual emission in the DLA trough suggests an optical depth contrast exceeding $10^7$ in the internal structure, implying a sharp edge or patchy structure. A Lyman $\alpha$ emitter (LAE) at $z_{\rm LAE}=3.3433\pm0.0005$, consistent with the DLA redshift, is detected at an angular separation of $1.''73\pm0.''28$ ($12.9\pm2.1$ kpc). The DLA is surrounded by three galaxies within 140 kpc in projected distance and 500 km s$^{-1}$ in line-of-sight velocity, indicating that it resides in the circumgalactic medium of the LAE or within a galaxy group/protocluster environment. An O~{\sc i} $\lambda1302$ absorption at $z_{\rm OI}=3.3288\pm0.0004$ is also detected along the line of sight. This absorber may trace metal-enriched outflow from the LAE or a gas-rich galaxy exhibiting the highest star formation activity among the surrounding galaxies. Future large spectroscopic surveys of galaxies will expand such a DLA sample, and three-dimensional spectroscopy for it will shed new light on the role of intergalactic dense gas in galaxy formation and evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 In Hot Jupiters (HJs), atmospherically induced magnetic fields are expected to play an important role in controlling the wind circulation and in determining their inflated radii. Here we perform 1D plane-parallel magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of HJ atmospheric columns, using the wind and thermodynamic profiles generated by global circulation models of different exo-planets. We quantitatively investigate the effects of magnetic field winding and Ohmic dissipation (previously considered in several works), with the addition of Hall drift and ambipolar diffusion. The main effect is the magnetic field winding in the full non-linear regime, with local azimuthal fields reaching maximum values up to ${\cal O}(10^2)$ G at the shear layer (typical pressure $\sim 1$ bar), much stronger than the assumed background field generated in the planetary interior. The associated meridional currents undergo Ohmic dissipation, with local heating efficiencies of at least $\sim$ ${10^{-6}}-10^{-3}$ (considering only these shallow layers). In addition to the dominant winding vs. Ohmic balance, the presence of the Hall and ambipolar terms have a non-negligible contribution in shaping and twisting the induced magnetic field at $p\lesssim 1$ bar; however this effect is only apparent for the hottest planets. Our results, though limited by construction to a plane-parallel approximation of the sub-stellar columns and with a simplified setup that cannot consistently include the magnetic drag on the wind, assess the non-linearity and complexity of the magnetic induction in HJs atmospheres, and call for a self-consistent inclusion of MHD effects in Ohmic dissipation studies and circulation models, beyond the often-assumed perturbative regime.
#### Cen A hotspot in Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays illuminated by M83 or Cen A?

 - **Abstract**
 The standard assumption about the influence of the turbulent intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF) on the images of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECR) sources is that the latter are formed in a random walk mode in the deflection angle. As a result, the images are symmetrically broadened to angular scales proportional to the IGMF strength and the square root of its correlation length. We demonstrate that when the size of the emitting region is smaller than the correlation length of the IGMF, a new focusing regime emerges. In this regime, significant deviations from the standard random walk approximation occur even when the distance between the source and the observer exceeds several tens of IGMF correlation lengths. The angular size of the resulting images is typically smaller than predicted by random walk, and the IGMF causes a systematic shift of the entire image away from the true source direction. This introduces additional uncertainty in the search for UHECR sources. We show that the excess observed by Pierre Auger Observatory in the direction of Cen A can be explained by the contribution of M83, provided that the image shift occurs as predicted by some models of the Galactic magnetic field (GMF) and that the IGMF plays a minor role due to its low strength and short coherence length. Alternatively, Cen A may indeed be the true source of the excess, as certain realizations of the IGMF can compensate the deflection caused by the GMF.
#### Towards mapping turbulence in the intracluster medium IV. Using NewAthena/X-IFU and simulation based inference to constrain turbulence

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The NewAthena mission planned for launch in the mid-2030s will carry X-IFU, an integral field unit spectrometer that will enable unique insight in the X-ray hot universe through its combination of spectral and spatial capabilities. The high spectral resolution will allow a mapping of turbulent velocities of the hot gas in galaxy clusters, providing an unrivaled way to study the complex dynamics within galaxy clusters. Aims. This is the fourth in a series of papers aimed at forecasting the ability to investigate turbulence in the intracluster medium through the observation of the centroid shift caused by turbulent motions of the gas. In this paper we improve on previous methods by investigating the ability of simulation-based inference (SBI) to constrain the underlying nature of velocity fluctuations through the use of standard observational diagnostics, such as the structure function. Methods. We rely on a complex architecture of neural networks in order to model the likelihood and posterior distributions relevant to our case. We investigate its capability to retrieve the turbulence parameters on mock observations, and explore its capability to use alternative summary statistics. Conclusions. Our trained models are able to infer the parameters of the intracluster gas velocity power-spectrum in independently simulated X-IFU observations of a galaxy cluster. We evaluated the precision of the recovery for different models. We show the necessity to use methods such as SBI to avoid an under-estimation of the sources of variance by comparing the results to our previous paper. We confirm that sample variance severely impacts the precision of recovered turbulent features. Our results demonstrate the need for advanced modeling methods to tackle the complexity of the physical information nested within future observations expected from X-IFU/NewAthena.
#### A model of magnetised and rotating convection for stellar and planetary interiors

 - **Abstract**
 Convection is a fundamental mechanism for energy transport in stars and planets, playing a pivotal role in shaping their structures and evolution. The Mixing-Length Theory, a monomodal approach to convection, is widely adopted and implemented in 1D stellar structure and evolution codes. However, it overlooks the combined effects of rotation and magnetic fields, which are ubiquitous across a wide range of stars and planets. To address this limitation, we extend the Mixing-Length Theory including both rotation and magnetic fields within a Cartesian set-up. Building on the work by Stevenson 1979, we use a heat-flux maximisation principle, which amounts to selecting the convective mode that carries the most heat. Our findings show that both rotation and magnetic fields individually tend to suppress convection. However, when combined, they can enhance convection strength under certain conditions. We derive expressions for the root-mean-square (rms) velocity, characteristic length scale, and degree of superadiabaticity as functions of the rotation rate and magnetic field strength. These results offer new insights for more accurately modeling convection and its impact on stellar and planetary structures in one-dimensional and forthcoming multi-dimensional evolution models.
