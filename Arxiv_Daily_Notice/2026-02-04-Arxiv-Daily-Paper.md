#### Radiation-hydrodynamics of star-disc collisions for quasi-periodic eruptions

 - **Abstract**
 Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are recently discovered transients of unknown nature occurring near supermassive black holes, which feature bright X-ray bursts separated by hours to days. A promising model for QPEs is the star-disc collisions model, where a star repeatedly interacts with an accretion disc around a black hole, creating shocks that expel dense outflows of gas from which radiation emerges. We investigate the dynamics of the star-disc collisions, the properties of the outflows, and the resulting radiation signatures. Our study focuses on the generic case where the star remains unperturbed by the collision and the stellar crossing time through the disc is sufficiently long for shocked gas to flow around the star. We performed a three-dimensional (3D) radiation-hydrodynamics simulation of the star-disc collision. The star was modeled as a solid, spherical body, and the interaction was simulated for a small, local section of the accretion disc. We found that star-disc collisions generate a nearly paraboloidal bow shock. The heating of gas is not confined to the column of gas directly ahead of the star but also extends laterally as the shock front expands sideways while traveling with the star. As the star crosses the disc, it injects momentum preferentially along its direction of motion, leading to an asymmetric redistribution of energy and momentum. As a result, two outflows emerge on opposite sides of the disc with different properties: the forward outflow expands faster, contains more mass, carries more energy, and is about twice as luminous as the backward outflow. Our findings suggest that the asymmetry in outflow properties and luminosity arises naturally from the collision dynamics, offering a possible explanation for the alternating strong-weak flare patterns observed in several QPE sources.

 - **Abstract**
 Molecular gas, modest in mass yet pivotal within the cosmic inventory, regulates baryon cycling as the immediate fuel for star formation. Across most of cosmic history, its reservoir has remained elusive, with only the tip of the iceberg revealed by luminous carbon monoxide (CO) emitting galaxies. Here we report the first detections of the mean cosmic CO background across its rotational ladder at 7$\sigma$, together with ionized carbon ([CII]) at 3$\sigma$, over $0<z<4.2$. This uses tomographic clustering of diffuse broadband intensities with reference galaxies, directly probing aggregate emission in the cosmic web. From CO(1-0) we infer the total molecular gas density, $\Omega_{\rm H_2}$, finding it about twice that resolved in galaxy surveys. The global depletion time is $\sim$1 Gyr, shorter than the Hubble time, requiring sustained inflow. CO excitation links to star-formation surface density and, with depletion time, yields a super-linear Kennicutt-Schmidt law that appears universal. Together these results establish a global picture of galaxy growth fueled by a larger, short-lived molecular reservoir. The CO and [CII] detections mark a turning point for line-intensity mapping, replacing forecasts with empirical line strengths and defining sensitivity requirements for upcoming 3D experiments poised to open new windows on galaxy formation and cosmology.

 - **Abstract**
 The Electromagnetically Isolated Global Signal Estimation Platform (EIGSEP) is a new instrument designed to measure the global 21-cm signal from Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionization, redshifted to frequencies below 250 MHz. To reduce spectral structure in the antenna beam associated with ground scattering, EIGSEP uses a shaped bowtie antenna suspended in a canyon 100 m above the ground. We describe the current system design of EIGSEP, including the rotating antenna platform, a transmitter antenna to characterise the beam of the bowtie antenna, and auxiliary ground antennas. We then discuss the EIGSEP calibration scheme, which incorporates traditional Dicke switching in the receiver, and novel approaches that include beam mapping, beam modulation, and interferometric cross-correlation. The instrument has been deployed near Marjum Pass, Utah, for testing and initial data collection. We discuss the site characteristics and present initial field measurements.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of the structural, astrophysical, and dynamical properties of eight open clusters: NGC 559, NGC 1817, NGC 2141, NGC 7245, Ruprecht 15, Ruprecht 137, Ruprecht 142, and Ruprecht 169, using precise astrometric and photometric data from Gaia Data Release 3. By fitting the King model to the radial density profiles, we determined the structural parameters of the clusters, including core and limiting radii, which were found to range from 3.07 to 16.21 arcmin and from 9.97 to 25.97 arcmin, respectively. Fundamental astrophysical parameters were derived by fitting PARSEC isochrones to the colour-magnitude diagrams. The results show that the clusters have logarithmic ages between 7.95 and 9.34, metallicities in the range 0.007 to 0.015, and heliocentric distances between 1640 and 5203 pc. The total stellar masses of the clusters were estimated to lie between 257 and 1916 solar masses. For most of the clusters, the mass function slopes are consistent with the Salpeter initial mass function. Our dynamical analysis indicates that all clusters, except Ruprecht 15, are dynamically relaxed. In addition, the spatial distribution and the bimodal structure observed in the radial density profile of NGC 7245 provide strong evidence that this object is a binary cluster candidate. Finally, kinematic analysis and orbit integrations demonstrate that all clusters exhibit dynamical properties fully consistent with membership in the Galactic thin disc.

 - **Abstract**
 A population of anomalous ultra-massive white dwarfs discovered with Gaia, often referred to as the Q branch, show high (multi-Gyr) cooling delays produced by exotic physical mechanisms. They are believed to be the products of stellar mergers, but the exact origin and formation channel remain unclear. We obtained a spectroscopically complete, volume-limited sample of the Q branch region within 100 pc, and found significant differences in atmospheric composition and rotation rates as a function of tangential velocity. In particular, we discover that stellar remnants with the longest cooling delays do not show strong magnetism nor detectable short-period rotational variability, as opposed to what is generally believed for double-degenerate mergers. This indicates that either these white dwarfs arise from a formation channel with no strong magnetism induced, or that the magnetism produced from the merger dissipates over the cooling delay timescales. Our follow-up photometry has also discovered pulsations in the second and third hydrogen-dominated DAQ white dwarfs, one hotter than 15,500 K, possibly extending the boundaries of the DAV instability strip for white dwarfs with thin hydrogen layers.

 - **Abstract**
 We compile a sample of 83 Little Red Dots (LRDs) with JWST imaging and find that a substantial fraction ($\sim$43%, rising to $\gtrsim$85% for the most luminous LRDs) host one or more spatially offset, UV-bright companions at projected separations of $0.5\rm \, kpc \lesssim d\lesssim 5 \rm \,kpc$, with median of $\langle d \rangle = 1.0\,\mathrm{kpc}$. This fraction is even higher when smaller spatial scales are probed at high S/N ratio: we show that the two most strongly lensed LRDs known to date, A383-LRD and the newly discovered A68-LRD, both have UV-bright companions at separations of only $d\sim0.3$ kpc, below the resolution limit of most unlensed JWST samples. We explore whether these ubiquitous red/blue configurations may be physically linked to the formation of LRDs, in analogy with the "synchronized pair" scenario originally proposed for direct-collapse black hole formation. In this picture, ultraviolet radiation from the companions, which typically have modest stellar masses ($M_\ast \sim 10^{8-9}M_\odot$), suppresses molecular hydrogen cooling in nearby gas, allowing nearly isothermal collapse and the formation of extremely compact objects, such as massive black holes or quasi-stars. Using component-resolved photometry and SED modeling, we infer Lyman-Werner radiation fields of $J_{21,LW} \sim 10^{2.5}$-$10^{5}$ at the locations of the red components, comparable to those required in direct-collapse models, suggesting that the necessary photodissociation conditions are realized in many LRD systems. This framework provides a simple and self-consistent explanation for the extreme compactness and distinctive spectral properties of LRDs, and links long-standing theoretical models for early compact object formation directly to a population now observed with JWST in the early universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding planetary habitability requires a comparative approach that explores the divergent evolutionary outcomes of Earth and Venus. The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) will be uniquely positioned to conduct a statistical and physical census of terrestrial exoplanets spanning the Venus Zone (VZ) and the Habitable Zone (HZ), enabling the detection and atmospheric characterization of post-runaway greenhouse worlds (``exoVenuses''). We present an updated list of VZ exoplanets, which raises the number of known candidates to 370. We describe a science case and an observing strategy for VZ exoplanets that integrates precursor exoplanet detection data and stellar characterization with HWO direct imaging, spectroscopy across the UV/optical/IR, and spectropolarimetry. Our proposed framework emphasizes a pathway toward the diagnosis of sulfur chemistry (SO$_2$) and aerosol physics (H$_2$SO$_4$ clouds/hazes), planetary redox states (O$_2$/O$_3$ false positives from hydrogen loss), and cloud microphysics detection (rainbow polarization). We quantify implications for HWO requirements, including UV access to 0.2--0.4 $\mu$m, optical/NIR coverage to $\gtrsim$1.5 $\mu$m, inner working angle (IWA) reaching 0.3--1.5 AU around nearby Sun-like stars, and the SNR/resolution needed for key features. Finally, we outline a community-driven path to producing robust demographic inferences and target selection for optimizing HWO observations.
#### Cyclotron lines in subcritical X-ray pulsars: Monte Carlo simulations reveal the origin of the observed variability

 - **Abstract**
 Observed cyclotron resonant scattering features (CRSFs) in X-ray pulsars (XRPs) exhibit strong variability. In the subcritical luminosity regime, the centroid energy ($E_{CRSF}$) and line width ($\sigma_{CRSF}$) often show positive correlations with the X-ray luminosity. We investigate the physical origin of the observed variability quantitatively, focusing on the effects of resonant scattering and Doppler shift induced by the plasma flow in the accretion funnel. We developed a relativistic Monte Carlo code to perform detailed radiative transfer calculations in the accretion funnel above the hotspot and derive angle-dependent spectra. Analytical plasma density and velocity profiles were adopted to account for the effects of radiation pressure on the flow. Approximate resonant scattering cross-sections were employed. We varied the accretion luminosity to explore the resulting variability of the CRSF properties. The emergent spectra exhibit a prominent, asymmetric CRSF accompanied by a broad blue wing. The CRSF is systematically redshifted relative to the classical cyclotron energy, with the magnitude of the redshift decreasing at higher luminosities and for larger viewing angles $\theta$. Both $E_{CRSF}$ and $\sigma_{CRSF}$ correlate positively with luminosity for all viewing angles. Their absolute values, however, depend strongly on the viewing angle, indicating substantial variability over the pulse cycle and sensitivity to the system geometry. At fixed luminosity, $E_{CRSF}$ ($\sigma_{CRSF}$) decreases (increases) with increasing $\cos\theta$. Consequently, phase-resolved observations are expected to reveal an anticorrelation between the CRSF centroid energy and width. When applied to the XRP GX 304$-$1, the model reproduces the observed CRSF variability over nearly an order of magnitude in luminosity for geometries in which the accretion funnel is predominantly viewed edge-on.

 - **Abstract**
 The results of spectroscopic and photometric monitoring of the classical T Tauri star RY Tau are presented. The observation series span 220 nights from 2013 to 2024. During the observation period, the star's brightness varied within the range of V=9-11 mag. The rotation axis of the "star + accretion disk" system is tilted at a large angle, so the line of sight intersects the wind region and accreting flows in the star's magnetosphere. Variability in the short-wavelength wing of the Halpha emission line and the profile of the D NaI resonance doublet are analyzed. It is shown that the wind and accretion flows vary on a time scale of approximately 20 days. When the predominant flow direction changes, a time lag is observed: initially, accretion increases, and after two days, absorption in the line-of-sight wind decreases. It is concluded that the spectral line profiles are formed in the magnetospheric accretion flows and the conical wind originating from the boundary of the star's magnetosphere. The time lag is determined by the tilt of the magnetic dipole and the opening angle of the conical wind. It is assumed that RY Tau operates in an unstable propeller mode, and fluctuations in the accretion and wind flows are caused by density waves in the accretion disk.

 - **Abstract**
 Complete catalogs of molecular clouds in the Milky Way allow analysis of the molecular medium and the star formation properties of the Milky Way that closely follows the method used for nearby galaxies. We explore whether the big dip in the radial distribution of molecular gas in the Milky Way is peculiar and find several other galaxies with similar patterns, all with similar morphological classifications of YClxxGnR, indicating a clearly defined, long bar leading to a grand-design spiral. This category is fairly rare among galaxies in the PHANGS sample, but all galaxies with this classification have some evidence for dips in the radial distribution of CO emission. The lengths of the bars correlate with the extents of the dips. The Milky Way and the other galaxies with dips have similar stellar masses and star formation rates, both lying near the high ends of the distributions for all PHANGS galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 We use rotation splittings derived from very long and long time series, namely 25.2, 12.6 and 6.3 year long, computed by Korzennik (2023) independent methodology to characterize the solar tachocline and its variation with latitude and time. We use two different inversion methodologies and a model of the tachocline to derive its position, width and the amplitude of the radial shear. To validate our methodology we present results from simulated rotational splittings, whether including or not random noise commensurable with the current observational precision. We also describe how we leverage the fact that one of our methodologies uses an initial guess that can be chosen to include a priori information. In order to try to resolve the tachocline, we increased the radial density of the inversion grid and showed how it affect the inferences. We also show how the trade off between smoothing and noise magnification affects these, as well as the effectiveness of using an informed initial guess. Results derived from high-precision rotational splittings show clearly that the location of the tachocline at low latitudes is different for its position at high latitudes. The latitudinal variation of its width is not significantly constrained, but our results agree with estimates based on forward modeling. When using splittings derived from somewhat shorter time series, we find temporal variations that are neither definitive nor significant, since we see systematic differences when using different methodologies.

 - **Abstract**
 Reliable nebular emission line diagnostics are essential for accurately inferring the physical properties (e.g. electron temperature, density, pressure, and metallicity) of H II regions from spectra. When interpreting spectra, it is typical to adopt a single zone model, e.g. at fixed density, pressure, or temperature, to infer H II region properties. However, such an assumption may not fully capture the complexities of a turbulent interstellar medium. To understand how a complex density field driven by supersonic turbulence impacts nebular emission lines, we simulate 3D H II regions surrounding a single O star, both with and without supersonic turbulence. We find that turbulence directly impacts the values of common strong line ratios. For example turbulent H II regions exhibit systematically higher [N II]/H$\alpha$, lower [O III]/H$\beta$, and lower O32, compared to homogeneous H II regions with the same mean density and ionizing source. These biases can impact inferences of metallicity, ionization parameter, excitation, and ionization source. For our choice of turbulence, direct $T_e$ method metallicity inferences are biased low, by up to 0.1 dex, which is important for metallicity studies, but not enough to explain the abundance discrepancy problem. Finally, we show that large differences between measured electron densities emerge between infrared, optical, and UV density indicators. Our results motivate the need for large grids of turbulent H II regions models that span the range of conditions seen at both high and low redshift to better interpret observed spectra.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a cosmological zoom-in radiation magneto-hydrodynamic (RMHD) simulation, using FORGE'd in FIRE, that follows the formation, growth, and evolution of a single metal-free Pop. III (proto)star at redshift $z \sim 14$. The simulation captures a rotationally supported circumstellar disk and protostellar jets, both resolved down to $<100$ au scales. We find the star grows to $\sim 27$ M$_{\odot}$ over $31,000$ years, with its final mass regulated by accretion and protostellar jets. Protostellar jets form because the magnetic mass-to-flux ratio lies within the regime that allows jet launching, and they are further enabled by a rotating circumstellar disk with sufficient gas-magnetic-field coupling, both present in this simulation. These jets regulate accretion onto the (proto)star and drive outflows that collide with infalling gas, slowing inflow at large radii due to the substantial momentum they carry. A circumstellar disk forms, extending out to $\sim 0.01$ pc, which remains gravitationally stable (Q $\gg 1$). The stability of the disk is maintained through both thermal support and turbulence. In this paper we focus on how jets play a critical role not only in shaping the final masses of Pop. III stars but also in directly influencing their surroundings by regulating accretion. These results will provide important insights into the initial mass function and feedback processes in the earliest star-forming regions of the Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a deep photometric study of the globular cluster NGC 5466 and its tidal stream using Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) imaging with the metallicity-sensitive narrowband filter NB395. We develop an improved member-selection technique based on a k-nearest neighbor algorithm applied to the color-color-magnitude diagram (CCMD), enabling reliable candidate identification down to $i_{2,0} < 23.5$. Photometric metallicities derived from NB395 colors agree with previous measurements, supporting the robustness of our calibration. While modest residual contamination and possible offsets - potentially driven by variations in light-element abundances - may remain beyond 10 arcmin, the metallicity distribution of high-probability inner members matches the known mean metallicity of NGC 5466, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method. The spatial distribution of NB395-selected stars clearly delineates the tidal stream. Beyond the tidal radius, the azimuthally averaged radial surface density profile follows a power law with slope $\alpha = -4.53_{-0.14}^{+0.13}$. We also detect a power-law component perpendicular to the stream, suggestive of multiple apogalactic passages. A density gap is identified at a projected distance of $\sim200$ pc from the cluster center, consistent with eTidal N-body predictions and possibly associated with a recent pericentric passage or Galactic disk interaction. Analysis of the main-sequence mass function reveals a strong negative radial gradient in the slope within the tidal radius, whereas the slope along the outer stream is relatively flat, consistent with preferential tidal stripping of low-mass stars. These results highlight the power of HSC/NB395 photometry for identifying metal-poor populations and deriving photometric metallicities, underscoring its value for future wide-field surveys.
#### From Grism to IFU: Revising the Redshift and Nature of the Massive Dusty Galaxy S1 with JWST and ALMA

 - **Abstract**
 We report a revised spectroscopic redshift for the dusty massive galaxy S1, previously inferred with an exceptionally high baryon-to-star conversion efficiency from NIRCam slitless grism data at $z_{\rm grism}=5.58$. Our new JWST/NIRSpec IFU observations reveal multiple rest-frame optical and NIR emission lines, yielding a secure spectroscopic redshift of $z_{\rm spec}=3.2439\pm0.0002$. We show that the earlier grism-based redshift resulted from contamination by a nearby galaxy whose dispersed spectral trace overlaps with S1, illustrating a known challenge of slitless spectroscopy when only a single dispersion angle and single emission feature are available. In addition, we present new ALMA 1 mm observations, which robustly detect dust emission ($S_{\rm 1mm}=0.99\pm0.03$ mJy) and show a dust half-light radius ($R_{\rm e,1mm}=0.73\pm0.10$ kpc) slightly smaller than the stellar size ($R_{\rm e, F444W} = 0.97\pm0.01$ kpc). Using the revised redshift and compiled multi-wavelength photometry, we update the UV-to-FIR SED and find that S1 is less extreme than previously inferred, yet remains a very massive (log$M_{\star}/M_{\odot}\sim10.6$), heavily obscured star-forming galaxy. The updated SED modeling reveals S1 to be a very dust- and gas-rich system with a moderate star formation rate and a long gas depletion time ($\tau_{\rm dep} \sim 1.4$ Gyr), deviating from SMGs and OFGs, but more closely resembling typical massive main-sequence galaxies. We note that, although this revision reduces the number of ultra-massive galaxies reported in Xiao et al. 2024, it does not alter the main conclusions of that work. Overall, our study clarifies the nature of S1 and underscores the importance of multi-line spectroscopic confirmation, slitless observations at multiple position angles, and IFU data for robust redshift and physical characterization of rare massive galaxies in the early Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs) and soft gamma-ray repeaters (SGRs) are believed to be manifestations of magnetars. Typically, AXPs exhibit higher X-ray luminosities, whereas SGRs are generally fainter and display significantly high signal-to-noise ratios only during their outburst phases. In this work, we report the long-term timing evolution of four AXPs: 1E 2259+586, 4U 0142+61, 1RXS J170849.0-400910 and 1E 1841-045, which were regularly monitored with NICER from 2017 to 2024. Over this period, we identify a total of 10 timing events. In addition to one glitch and one anti-glitch in 1E 2259+586 reported in literature, we detect another 8 new timing events: 5 glitches, 2 anti-glitches, and 1 unusual state transition event. Notably, both anti-glitches were observed in 4U 0142+61, making it the most frequent source of such events, and there is a hint of regular evolution in its pulse profile. In the case of 1RXS J170849.0-400910, it continues to exhibit pronounced high-frequency timing anomalies and undergoes a state transition event. Finally, we study the evolution of the pulse profiles and find that the profiles of 1E 2259+586 and 4U 0142+61 both evolve. This is consistent with the earlier finding that pulse profile evolution is a generic feature of magnetars.

 - **Abstract**
 Cluster environments influence galaxy evolution by curtailing star formation activity, notably through ram-pressure stripping (RPS). In this study, using spatially resolved spectroscopic data from the SAMI Galaxy Survey, we identify galaxies undergoing or recently affected by RPS in eight nearby clusters ($0.029 < z < 0.058$), through a visual classification scheme based on the ionised gas ($\rm H\alpha + [NII]\lambda 6584$) morphologies, split into unperturbed, asymmetric, and truncated. The projected phase-space analysis shows that asymmetric galaxies are found in a narrow region in cluster-centric distance ($\rm 0.1 < R/R_{200} < 0.6$) and have a larger dispersion in line-of-sight velocity ($\sigma(|v_{pec}|)_\mathrm{Asym} = 0.71^{+0.09}_{-0.07}\ \sigma_{200}$) compared to the truncated and unperturbed samples. In terms of star formation activity, RPS candidates yield a much steeper resolved star-forming main sequence (rSFMS; $\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR} - \Sigma_\ast$) relation compared to the unperturbed counterparts, primarily emerging from having lower $\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR}$ values for the low mass density regime, with the steepest gradient deriving from the truncated sample. Moreover, radial star formation profiles reveal that star formation in RPS candidates is suppressed in the outskirts relative to unperturbed galaxies and is more prominent for the truncated sample. In contrast, central ($\rm r/r_{eff}<0.5$) star formation activity in RPS candidates is comparable with that in their unperturbed and field counterparts, suggesting no elevated activity. Taken together, this suggests an evolutionary trend linked to the RPS stage, where unperturbed galaxies likely represent recently accreted systems (pre-RPS), while asymmetric and truncated galaxies may correspond to populations undergoing RPS and post-RPS phases, respectively, favouring outside-in quenching.

 - **Abstract**
 Stars with masses between roughly 1 and 8~$M_\odot$ end their lives on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB), when intense mass loss takes place. The outflows are generally accepted to be driven by radiation pressure acting on dust grains that form in the dense extended atmospheres created by the action of convection and stellar pulsations. The complex physics underlying convection, stellar pulsations, and dust nucleation precludes predicting AGB mass loss from first principles. We investigated the evolution of two lobes observed to be expanding away from the AGB star Mira~A using images of polarized light obtained at six epochs using SPHERE on the VLT and of molecular emission at two epochs obtained with ALMA. While dust seems confined to the edges of the lobes, gas fills the lobes and displays higher densities than expected at the observed radii based on the large-scale mass-loss rate of Mira~A, with a total gas mass in the lobes of $\sim 2 \times 10^{-5}~M_\odot$. We find the expansion of the lobes to be consistent with both a constant velocity (ejection time in 2010 or 2011) or a decelerating expansion (ejection time in 2012). If ejection events with a similar magnitude happen periodically, we derive periods between 50 and 200~years to account for the mass-loss rate of Mira~A. This periodicity is uncertain because the average mass-loss rate of Mira A on larger scales is uncertain. We find abundances in the lobes of $\sim 1.5 \times 10^{-6}$ and $\sim 2.5 \times 10^{-6}$ for SO and SO$_2$, respectively, and of $2\times10^{-10}$, $6.5\times10^{-10}$, and $4\times10^{-7}$ for AlO, AlF, and PO. The strong variation in brightness of the different features identified in the polarized-light images is puzzling. We suggest that an asymmetric stellar radiation field preferentially illuminates specific regions of the circumstellar envelope at a given time, producing a lighthouse-like effect.

 - **Abstract**
 The dynamics of the inner regions of young stellar objects (YSOs) is driven by a variety of physical phenomena, from magnetospheres and accretion to the dust sublimation rim and inner disk flows. These inner environments evolve on timescales of hours to days, exactly when bursts, dips, and rapid structural changes carry the most valuable information about star and planet formations, but remain hardly reachable with current facilities. A better reactive infrastructure with six or more telescopes, combined with alerts from large time-domain surveys (e.g., at the era of LSST/Rubin type facilities), and equipped with instruments spanning from the V-band to the thermal infrared (N), would provide the instantaneous uv-coverage and spectral diagnostics needed to unambiguously interpret and image these events as they happen. Such a world's first time-domain interferometric observatory would enable qualitatively new science: directly linking optical and infrared variability to spatially resolved changes in magnetospheric accretion, inner-disk geometry, and dust and gas dynamics in the innermost astronomical unit. Crucially, connecting these processes to outer-scale unresolved information from JWST, ALMA, and the ELT would yield a complete tomography of the planet-forming region.

 - **Abstract**
 Quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) are oscillatory signatures commonly detected in the light curves of solar and stellar flares, offering valuable diagnostics of the underlying magnetic and plasma processes. This review compares the observational characteristics, detection methods, and physical interpretations of QPPs in both solar and stellar contexts. Solar flare QPPs, extensively studied in X-rays and EUV bands using instruments such as GOES, STIX, and Fermi, display typical periods of tens of seconds and show correlations with flare duration and magnetic loop length. Stellar QPPs, observed in X-rays and white light by missions such as Kepler, TESS, and XMM-Newton, exhibit much longer periods - ranging from minutes to hours - consistent with larger-scale magnetic structures in more active stars. Despite differences in scale and observing band, statistical and comparative studies reveal common scaling relations and damping behaviors, suggesting that both solar and stellar QPPs are manifestations of the same fundamental mechanisms, likely magnetohydrodynamic oscillations or oscillatory reconnection within flare loops. The comparison underscores a continuity between solar and stellar magnetic activity, linking the solar detailed physical processes to stellar-scale phenomena and providing constraints for future models and surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (3D MHD) simulations of the plasma flow structure in the vicinity of a compact cluster of young massive stars. The cluster is considered at the evolutionary stage dominated by Wolf-Rayet stars. This stage occurs in clusters with ages of several million years, close to the onset of supernova explosions; the well-known objects Westerlund 1 and 2 are the prototypes. The collisions of powerful winds from massive stars in the cluster core, calculated as interactions of individual outflows, are accompanied by their partial thermalization and produce a collective cluster wind. The MHD dynamics of the cluster wind bubble expansion into the interstellar medium is considered, depending on the density of the surrounding medium with a uniform magnetic field. We show that when expanding into a cold neutral medium, the cluster wind is able to reshape its surrounding environment over the Wolf-Rayet star lifetime, sweeping up more than $10^4$ $M_{\odot}$ of gas in $\sim 2 \times 10^5$ yr and producing extended, thin and dense shells with an amplified magnetic field. In a cold neutral medium with a density of $\sim 20$ cm$^{-3}$ and a magnetic field of $\sim 3.5$ $\mu$G, a thin shell forms around the cluster wind bubble, characterized by a cellular structure in its density and magnetic field distributions. The cellular magnetic field structure appears in parts of the shell expanding transversely to the orientation of the external magnetic field. Magnetic fields in the shell are amplified to strengths $\gtrsim 50$ $\mu$G. The formation of the cellular structure is associated with the development of instabilities. The expansion of the bubble into a warm neutral interstellar medium also leads to the formation of a shell with an amplified magnetic field.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent theoretical and observational analysis of the interaction between the Milky Way (MW) and LMC suggest that it has a significant dynamical impact on the MW's stellar halo. We investigate this effect using simulations from the Latte project, a simulation suite from the Feedback In Realistic Environments 2 (FIRE-2) Project. By comparing simulations with and without an LMC-analog interaction, we show that fully cosmological LMC interactions create prominent velocity asymmetry in the stellar halo of the MW, resulting from both barycentric displacement (the "reflex motion") and the dynamical wake of the LMC. The strength and direction of this asymmetry depend on the mass ratio at pericenter and orbit of the LMC analog. We perform a spherical-harmonic decomposition of the velocities of halo star particles to confirm that the identified signatures are LMC-induced and persist even when LMC star particles are removed. We also show that this strategy separates and individually detects the dipole (l=1) of the global reflex motion and the quadrupole (l=2) of the local wake. These asymmetries are consistent with those identified in previous work using non-cosmological simulations; the dipole is easily distinguishable from other complex halo substructure using spherical harmonics while the quadrupole is sometimes confused. These findings support the detectability of MW--LMC interaction signatures in upcoming observational surveys of the MW stellar halo.

 - **Abstract**
 Narrow interstellar absorption features in supernova (SN) spectra serve as valuable diagnostics for probing dust extinction and the presence of circumstellar or interstellar material. In this third paper in a series, we investigate how the strength of narrow interstellar absorption lines in low-resolution spectra varies with SN type and host galaxy properties, both on local and global scales. Using a dataset of over 10000 spectra from $\sim1800$ low-redshift SNe, we find that Type Ia SNe (SNe Ia) in passive galaxies exhibit significantly weaker narrow absorption features compared to CC-SNe and SNe Ia in star-forming hosts (SNe Ia-SF), suggesting lower interstellar gas content in quiescent environments. Within the star-forming hosts, the Na I D equivalent-width distribution of SNe II is much lower than that of both SNe Ia-SF and stripped-envelope SNe (SE-SNe). This result is somewhat unexpected, since CC-SNe are generally associated with star-forming regions and occur deeper within galactic disks, where stronger line-of-sight extinction would be anticipated. This suggests that the observed behaviour cannot be explained solely by absorption from the integrated interstellar medium (ISM) along the line of sight. Instead, if part of the absorption arises from material near the explosion, the similarity between the Na I D EW distributions of SNe Ia-SF and SE-SNe implies that comparable absorption signatures can emerge from distinct progenitor pathways. Possible explanations include (a) circumstellar material (CSM) expelled by the progenitor system before explosion, or (b) interaction of SN radiation with nearby patchy ISM clouds. Our results highlight the diagnostic power of interstellar absorption features in revealing the diverse environments and progenitor pathways of SNe.

 - **Abstract**
 Type II supernovae (SNe II) are the most common terminal stellar explosions in the Universe. With SNe now being detected within days after explosion, there is growing evidence that the majority of Type II SNe show signs of interaction with a confined, dense cirumstellar material (CSM) in the first few days post explosion. In this work we aim to bridge the gap between single SN studies showing early-time interaction in their spectra, and the statistical studies of early-time SN light curves, which imply the existence of CSM. We present a sample of 68 Type II SNe with both early photometric data, obtained with the ATLAS survey, and spectroscopic data, obtained with the ePESSTO+ collaboration. A subset of the sample is classified based on the presence or absence of narrow spectral features with electron-scattered broadened wings in the early spectra, indicative of interaction with CSM. We characterise the photometric and spectroscopic properties of the sample by measuring rise times to maximum light, peak magnitudes, decline rates and line velocities. Additionally, we measure the ratio of absorption to emission (a/e) of the H alpha P-Cygni profile. Our analysis reveals that SNe II showing early spectroscopic signs of interaction with CSM decline faster and are brighter than those without. However no difference is found in rise times between the two groups. A clear separation is observed in the a/e ratio: SNe with signs of interaction exhibit lower a/e ratios at all epochs compared to those without. Our results highlight that understanding SN II ejecta-CSM interaction requires large, uniform samples of photometric and spectroscopic data, such as the one presented in this work.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive O-type stars ($M\gtrsim15\,M_\odot$) with an X-ray quiet black hole (BH) companion represent a crucial stage in massive binary evolution leading to binary BH mergers. The population of such binaries remains elusive, with $\lesssim5$ candidate or confirmed systems. The Tarantula nebula harbors thousands of massive stars, 2-3 % of which are expected to have BH companions. It is therefore an ideal place to hunt for such systems. Here we analyse 30 epochs of VLT/FLAMES IFU high-resolution observations of the H$\delta$ region, as well as archival FLAMES spectroscopy, of VFTS 812, a 17-day single-lined spectroscopic binary with an O4V primary and a minimum secondary mass of $5.1\,M_\odot$. Following careful removal of the nebular contamination, spectral disentangling on the new data did not reveal any signature of the hidden companion. We derive $T_\mathrm{eff}=49^{+3}_{-4}$ kK, $\log L/L_\odot=5.7\pm0.1$ and $v_\mathrm{rot,max}{\rm \,sin\,}i=110^{+25}_{-35}$ km/s for the O4V component, yielding a (single star) evolutionary mass of $53^{+6}_{-5}$ $M_\odot$ and an age in the range of 0-1.6 Myr. Using injection tests of various luminous artificial companions in our data, we exhaustively rule out the presence of any luminous signature from a main sequence star more massive than $6\,M_\odot$. We discuss the possible nature of the companion, suggesting that the rejuvenated O star + BH companion is the most suitable scenario to consistently explain the location, (rejuvenated) young age, eccentricity and lack of companion signature. While this establishes VFTS 812 as a strong candidate O+BH system, follow-up observations are deemed necessary for robust confirmation and to search for accretion signatures on the O4V star.

 - **Abstract**
 Interstellar medium studies rely on magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence as a framework for interpretation. In this context, the statistical characterization of interstellar observations is of prime importance. We open a new perspective on diffuse interstellar matter by analyzing James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations of the Pleiades nebula with NIRCam. These observations are remarkable in that they provide a microscope view at the cold neutral medium (CNM) with a spatial resolution of 0.2 mpc (40 au). A two-dimensional Fourier analysis is used to characterize the structure of PAH emission in regions near and far from the Pleiades star Merope. To produce maps of the interstellar emission, stars and galaxies are filtered out. The final step in the data cleaning involves subtracting a component, in Fourier space, which we infer to be a residual of the near-infrared cosmic background. The PAH emission power spectra are highly anisotropic. They are well fitted with a break-free power-law, suggesting that we do not observe a specific scale for energy dissipation. Power-law indices are -3.5 near Merope and -3 in the more distant field. The magnetic field orientation, as derived from the Planck dust polarization data, aligns with the PAH anisotropy. The power anisotropy is constant across scales. These findings are discussed in relation to interstellar turbulence that may be driven by the Pleiades stars. The JWST observations of the Pleiades offer a new viewpoint for comparing observations and theoretical models, as they examine physical scales at which turbulence in the CNM is subsonic and decoupled from the thermal instability. The observations may indicate that the turbulent energy cascade in the CNM is anisotropic.

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal interactions play a crucial role in the orbital evolution of close-in star-planet systems. There are numerous manifestations of tides, including planetary orbital migration, breaking resonant chains, tidal heating, orbital circularization, spin-orbit alignment, and stellar and planetary spin synchronization. In the present study, we focus on the dissipation of internal gravity waves within stars. We examine two mechanisms: wave breaking in stars with radiative cores and magnetic wave conversion in stars with convective cores. Applying tidal prescriptions modelling these processes, we demonstrate that the enhanced stellar rotation of both TOI-2458 and GJ 504 can be explained by the previous engulfment of a hot Jupiter caused by gravity wave damping. Furthermore, we show that the observed population of hot Jupiters can be divided into two distinct subsamples: those that are too young for gravity wave dissipation and those where it is ongoing. These subsamples exhibit qualitatively different orbital period distributions: young systems have a uniform distribution, while older systems show a steep decline at short orbital periods. Using a population synthesis approach, we successfully reproduce the main features of the older hot Jupiter sample based on the distribution of the younger systems. According to our estimates, up to 20% of the main-sequence stars within the mass range [0.7,1.5] $M_{\odot}$ that once hosted a hot Jupiter may have since engulfed it. Our results highlight the key role of internal gravity wave dissipation in shaping the orbital architectures of hot Jupiter systems.
#### Temporal variations of solar inertial mode parameters from GONG (2002--2024) and HMI (2010--2024): Rossby modes ($3 \leq m \leq 16 $) and $m=1$ high-latitude mode

 - **Abstract**
 We study the temporal evolution of solar inertial modes over the solar cycle using observations from GONG and SDO/HMI. We focus on the high-latitude mode with azimuthal wavenumber $m=1$ and the equatorial Rossby modes with $3 \le m \le 16$. We use maps of horizontal flows near the solar surface from the GONG and HMI ring-diagram pipelines at a cadence of approximately one day, covering the period 2002--2024. The data are divided into overlapping four-year windows, with central times separated by six months. Within each time window and for each inertial mode, we measure the frequency and the power of the mode from the GONG and HMI data. We find good agreement between the GONG and HMI measurements throughout their overlapping period from 2010 to 2024. In general, the magnitude of the frequency variations increases with increasing $m$, while relative changes in mode power typically exceed 100\%. For the $m=1$ high-latitude mode, the measured power is anti-correlated with the sunspot number, while its frequency shows no significant temporal variation. For the equatorial Rossby modes, the frequencies are generally anti-correlated with the sunspot number, whereas the mode powers tend to correlate positively with the sunspot number. An exception is the $m=3$ equatorial Rossby mode, whose mode power is strongly anti-correlated with the sunspot number, in contrast to the other equatorial Rossby modes, highlighting its distinct behavior. We find that the frequencies and power of the Sun's inertial modes exhibit significant variability on solar-cycle timescales over the past 23 years. The mode parameters are however not uniformly synchronized with the sunspot number; clear differences are observed both from mode to mode and from one solar cycle to the next. The sensitivity of inertial modes to solar-cycle changes indicates their potential as a diagnostic of solar interior dynamics and magnetism.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultra-fast outflows (UFOs) are thought to be a driving mechanism of large-scale winds driven by active galactic nuclei, which cause significant galactic feedback through quenching star formation and regulating supermassive black hole growth. We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Mid-Infrared Instrument Medium-Resolution Spectrometer observations of two nearby ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs), F11119+3257 and F05189-2524, with nuclear X-ray detected UFOs and kiloparsec-scale outflow. These galaxies show remarkably similar mid-infrared continuum and emission line features, notably including a high-velocity $v_{90}$ $\sim$ 4000 km s$^{-1}$ outflow detected in highly ionized neon emission lines, e.g., \nevi. In F05189-2524, we see a slightly slower biconical outflow extending up to $\sim2$ kpc in the same neon emission lines. Both sources show evidence of AGN-driven radiative feedback through a deficit of rotational molecular hydrogen lines in the nuclear region, $<$1 kpc from the central quasar, but no clear evidence of any molecular gas entrained in the quasar-driven outflow. Energetic analysis shows that the warm ionized gas in both of these sources contributes minimally ($\sim0.1-5\%$) to the momentum outflow rate of these sources and leaves the conclusions of previous literature unchanged: the energetics of these sources are broadly consistent with a momentum-conserving outflow.
