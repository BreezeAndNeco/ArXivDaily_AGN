 - **Abstract**
 Context. A series of studies have demonstrated that the Gaia multipeak method (GMP) is a very efficient technique to select active galactic nucleus (AGN) pair candidates. The number of candidates is determined by the size of the input AGN catalogs, usually limited to spectroscopically-confirmed objects. Aims. The objective of this work is to compile a larger and highly reliable catalog of GMP pair candidates extracted from the six million objects the Gaia AGN catalog, the majority of which lack spectroscopic information. Methods. In order to ascertain the differences in the properties of GMP pair candidates compared to normal AGN, we conducted an investigation utilising samples of GMP AGN. These differences were employed to establish the optimal selecting criteria, which ultimately led to the identification of a highly reliable candidate catalog. Results. We found significant differences in astrometry and multi-band colour distribution between normal AGN and GMP pair candidates. A DUal and Lensed AGN candidate catalog with GMP method (DULAG) comprising 5,286 sources was ultimately compiled, accompanied by a highly reliable Golden sample of 1,867 sources. A total of 37 sources in the Golden sample have been identified as dual AGN or lensed AGN. For the majority of sources in the Golden sample, we provide reference redshifts and find three close AGN pair candidates among them.
#### PDRs4All XI. Empirical prescriptions for the interpretation of JWST imaging observations of star-forming regions

 - **Abstract**
 (Abridged) JWST continues to deliver incredibly detailed infrared (IR) images of star forming regions in the Milky Way and beyond. IR emission from star-forming regions is very spectrally rich due to emission from gas-phase atoms, ions, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Physically interpreting IR images of these regions relies on assumptions about the underlying spectral energy distribution in the imaging bandpasses. We aim to provide empirical prescriptions linking line, PAH, and continuum intensities from JWST images, to facilitate the interpretation of JWST images in a wide variety of contexts. We use JWST PDRs4All Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) and Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) imaging and Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) integral field unit (IFU) and MIRI Medium Resolution Spectrograph (MRS) spectroscopic observations of the Orion Bar photodissociation region (PDR), to directly compare and cross-calibrate imaging and IFU data at ~100 AU resolution over a region where the radiation field and ISM environment evolves from the hot ionized gas to the cold molecular gas. We measure the relative contributions of line, PAH, and continuum emission to the NIRCam and MIRI filters as functions of local physical conditions. We provide empirical prescriptions based on NIRCam and MIRI images to derive intensities of emission lines and PAH features. Within the range of the environments probed in this study, these prescriptions accurately predict Pa-alpha, Br-alpha, PAH 3.3 um and 11.2 um intensities, while those for FeII 1.644 um, H_2 1--0 S(1) 2.12 um and 1--0 S(9) 4.96 um, and PAH 7.7 um show more complicated environmental dependencies. Linear combinations of JWST NIRCam and MIRI images provide effective tracers of ionized gas, H_2, and PAH emission in PDRs. We expect these recipes to be useful for both the Galactic and extragalactic communities.

 - **Abstract**
 Direct imaging (DI) campaigns are uniquely suited to probing the outer regions around young stars and looking for giant exoplanet and brown dwarf companions, hence providing key complementary information to radial velocity (RV) and transit searches for the purpose of demographic studies. However, the critical 5-20 au region, where most giant planets are thought to form, remains poorly explored, lying in-between RV and DI capabilities. Significant gains in detection performances can be attained at no instrumental cost by means of advanced post-processing techniques. In the context of the COBREX project, we have assembled the largest collection of archival DI observations to date in order to undertake a large and uniform re-analysis. In particular, this paper details the re-analysis of 400 stars from the GPIES survey operated at GPI@Gemini South. Following the pre-reduction of raw frames, GPI data cubes were processed by means of the PACO algorithm. Candidates were identified and vetted based on multi-epoch proper motion analysis -- whenever possible -- and by means of a suitable color-magnitude diagram. The conversion of detection limits into detectability maps allowed for an estimate of unbiased occurrence frequencies of giant planets and brown dwarfs. Deeper detection limits were derived compared to the literature, with up to a twofold gain in minimum detectable mass compared to previous GPI-based publications. Although no new substellar companion was confirmed, we identified two interesting planet candidates awaiting follow-up observations. We derive an occurrence rate of $1.7_{-0.7}^{+0.9}\%$ for $5$~\mjup$ < m < 13$~\mjup planets in $10~\text{au}< a < 100~\text{au}$, that raises to $2.2_{-0.8}^{+1.0}\%$ when including substellar objects up to 80 \mjup.(abridged)

 - **Abstract**
 Bubbles and super-bubbles are ubiquitous in the interstellar medium and influence their local magnetic field. Starting from the assumption that bubbles result from violent explosions that sweep matter away in a thick shell, we derive the analytical equations for the divergence-free magnetic field in the shell. The explosion velocity field is assumed to be radial but not necessarily spherical, making it possible to model various-shaped bubbles. Assuming an explosion center, the magnetic field at the present time is fully determined by the initial uniform magnetic field, the present-time geometry of the bubble shell, and a radial vector field that encodes the explosion-induced displacement of matter, from its original location to its present-time location. We present the main characteristics of our magnetic-field model using a simple displacement model which predicts a constant density of the swept-up matter in the bubble shell and magnetic flux conservation. We further estimate the expected contribution of the shell of the Local Bubble, the super-bubbles in which the Sun resides, to the integrated Faraday rotation measures and synchrotron emission and compare these to full-sky observational data. We find that, while the contribution to the former is minimal, the contribution to the latter is very significant at Galactic latitudes $|b|>45^\circ$. Our results underline the need to take the Local Bubble into account in large-scale Galactic magnetic field studies.

 - **Abstract**
 Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) erupting from the host star are expected to have effects on the atmospheric erosion processes of the orbiting planets. For planets with a magnetosphere, the embedded magnetic field in the CMEs is thought to be the most important parameter to affect planetary mass loss. In this work, we investigate the effect of different magnetic field structures of stellar CMEs on the atmosphere of a hot Jupiter with a dipolar magnetosphere. We use a time-dependent 3D radiative magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) atmospheric escape model that self-consistently models the outflow from hot Jupiters magnetosphere and its interaction with stellar CMEs. For our study, we consider three configurations of magnetic field embedded in stellar CMEs -- (a) northward $B_z$ component, (b) southward $B_z$ component, and (c) radial component. {We find that both the CMEs with northward $B_z$ component and southward $B_z$ component increase the planetary mass-loss rate when the CME arrives from the stellar side, with the mass-loss rate remaining higher for the CME with northward $B_z$ component until it arrives at the opposite side.} The largest magnetopause is found for the CME with a southward $B_z$ component when the dipole and the CME magnetic field have the same direction. We also find that during the passage of a CME, the planetary magnetosphere goes through three distinct changes - (1) compressed magnetosphere, (2) enlarged magnetosphere, and (3) relaxed magnetosphere for all three considered CME configurations. We compute synthetic Ly-$\alpha$ transits at different times during the passage of the CMEs. The synthetic Ly-$\alpha$ transit absorption generally increases when the CME is in interaction with the planet for all three magnetic configurations. The maximum Ly-$\alpha$ absorption is found for the radial CME case when the magnetosphere is the most compressed.

 - **Abstract**
 We present 22 GHz imaging of regions of massive star formation within the Local Wolf-Rayet Galaxy Sample (LWRGS), a NSF's Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) survey of 30 local galaxies showing spectral features of Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. These spectral features are present in galaxies with young super star clusters (SSCs), and are an indicator of large concentrations of massive stars. We present a catalog of 92 individually-identified regions of likely free-free emission associated with potential young SSCs located in these WR galaxies. The free-free fluxes from these maps allow extinction-free estimates of the Lyman continuum rates, masses, and luminosities of the emission regions. 39 of these regions meet the minimum Lyman continuum rate to contain at least once SSC, and 29 of these regions could contain individual SSCs massive enough to test specific theories on star formation and feedback inhibition in SSCs, requiring follow-up observations at higher spatial resolution. The resulting catalog provides sources for future molecular line and infrared studies into the properties of super star cluster formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Red supergiants may experience a short-lived period of episodic mass loss rather than steady winds before their core collapses, leading to dense circumstellar matter (CSM) close to core-collapse supernovae (SNe). Interaction of SN ejecta with such nearby CSM can generate additional radiation, appending to the cooling radiation from the shock breakout of the progenitor envelope, to brighten the nascent SN explosion. This phenomenon is conspicuous for SN 2023ixf as its V-band brightness showed a rapid increase of about three magnitudes from the first to the third day after the explosion, which is distinctive among type II SNe with flash ionized signatures. In this paper, we employ a Monte Carlo method to simulate the radiative diffusion process in the unshocked CSM. Considering a wide range of mass-loss rates from 10^-5 to 10^-2 Msun/yr, we found that the fast-rising light curve of SN 2023ixf can be fitted by the interaction of the SN ejecta with a CSM having a mass-loss rate of about 10^-2 Msun/yr located within 10^15 cm to the progenitor.

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal disruption events (TDEs), where stars are captured or tidally disrupted by supermassive black holes, are potential sources of high-energy neutrinos. We report the discovery of a potential neutrino flare that is spatially and temporally associated with X-ray emission from TDE ATLAS17jrp. The best-fit spectrum of the neutrino flare follows a power-law with an index of $\rm{\gamma=2.7\pm0.4}$ and a flux normalization of $\rm{\Phi_0 =1.7^{+6.3}_{-1.5}\times 10^{-18}\;GeV^{-1} cm^{-2} s^{-1}}$ at 100 TeV based on an analysis of 10-year track data from IceCube, and the flare duration is 61 days. We calculate that the probability of this association occurring by chance is $0.17\%$. Therefore, ATLAS17jrp is the second TDE (not including candidates) associated with high-energy neutrinos, following TDE AT2019dsg associated with an IceCube neutrino alert. This association can be attributed to the interaction of X-ray photons produced by the hot corona with high-energy particles accelerated by disk winds or outflows, resulting in the production of neutrinos.
#### CO(1--0) imaging reveals 10-kiloparsec molecular gas reservoirs around star-forming galaxies at high redshift

 - **Abstract**
 Massive, intensely star-forming galaxies at high redshift require a supply of molecular gas from their gas reservoirs, replenished by infall from the surrounding circumgalactic medium, to sustain their immense star-formation rates. However, our knowledge of the extent and morphology of their cold-gas reservoirs is still in its infancy. We present the results of stacking 80 hours of JVLA observations of CO(1--0) emission -- which traces the cold molecular gas -- in 19 $z=2.0-4.5$ dusty, star-forming galaxies from the AS2VLA survey. The visibility-plane stack reveals extended emission with a half-light radius of $3.8\pm0.5$~kpc, 2--3$\times$ more extended than the dust-obscured star formation and $1.4\pm0.2\times$ more extended than the stellar emission. Similarly, stacking the [CI](1--0) observations for a subsample of our galaxies yields sizes consistent with CO(1--0). The CO(1--0) size is comparable to the [CII] halos detected around high-redshift star-forming this http URL bulk (up to 80\%) of molecular gas resides outside the star-forming region; only a small part of their molecular gas reservoir directly contributes to their current star formation. Photon-dissociation region modelling indicates that the extended CO(1--0) emission arises from clumpy, dense clouds rather than smooth, diffuse gas.

 - **Abstract**
 In this second paper on the DECam deep drilling field (DDF) program we release 2,020 optical gri-band light curves for transients and variables in the extragalactic COSMOS and ELAIS fields based on time series observations with a 3-day cadence from semester 2021A through 2023A. In order to demonstrate the wide variety of time domain events detected by the program and encourage others to use the data set, we characterize the sample by presenting a brief analysis of the light curve parameters such as time span, amplitude, and peak brightness. We also present preliminary light curve categorizations, and identify potential stellar variables, active galactic nuclei, tidal disruption events, supernovae (such as Type Ia, Type IIP, superluminous, and gravitationally lensed supernovae), and fast transients. Where relevant, the number of identified transients is compared to the predictions of the original proposal. We also discuss the challenges of analyzing DDF data in the context of the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory and its Legacy Survey of Space and Time, which will include DDFs. Images from the DECam DDF program are available without proprietary period and the light curves presented in this work are publicly available for analysis.

 - **Abstract**
 The intense magnetic fields of neutron stars naturally lead to strong anisotropy and polarization of radiation emanating from their surfaces, both being sensitive to the hot spot position on the surface. Accordingly, pulse phase-resolved intensities and polarizations depend on the angle between the magnetic and spin axes and the observer's viewing direction. In this paper, results are presented from a Monte Carlo simulation of neutron star atmospheres that uses a complex electric field vector formalism to treat polarized radiative transfer due to magnetic Thomson scattering. General relativistic influences on the propagation of light from the stellar surface to a distant observer are taken into account. The paper outlines a range of theoretical predictions for pulse profiles at different X-ray energies, focusing on magnetars and also neutron stars of lower magnetization. By comparing these models with observed intensity and polarization pulse profiles for the magnetar 1RXS J1708-40, and the light curve for the pulsar PSR J0821-4300, constraints on the stellar geometry angles and the size of putative polar cap hot spots are obtained.
#### Discovery of a Unique Close Quasar-DSFG Pair Linked by a [C II] Bridge at $z=5.63$

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of a unique quasar-dusty star-forming galaxy (DSFG) system at $z = 5.63$, consisting of the bright quasar J1133+1603 ($M_{\rm UV} = -27.42$) and its compact, dust-obscured companion, J1133c. ALMA observations reveal a prominent [C II] bridge connecting the quasar and DSFG, indicating ongoing interaction at a projected separation of 1.8 arcsec ($\sim$10 proper kpc). J1133c exhibits unusually bright and broad [C II] emission ($L_{\rm [CII]} > 10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$, FWHM $> 500$ km s$^{-1}$), with a [C II] luminosity five times that of the quasar, suggesting intense star formation or potential AGN activity. The inferred star formation rate from [C II] is approximately $10^3$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. The remarkable properties of this pair strongly suggest that galaxy interactions may simultaneously trigger both starburst and quasar activity, driving rapid evolution in the early universe.
#### CZ Aqr: an oscillating eclipsing Algol-type system composed of a $\delta$ Sct primary star and a subgiant star in a quadruple system

 - **Abstract**
 Eclipsing Algol-type systems containing a $\delta$ Scuti (hereafter $\delta$ Sct) star enable precise determination of physical parameters and the investigation of stellar internal structure and evolution. We present the absolute parameters of CZ Aquarius (hereafter CZ Aqr) based on TESS data. CZ Aqr has an orbital period of 0.86275209 d, a mass ratio of 0.489 (6), and the secondary component nearly fills its Roche lobe. $O-C$ analysis reveals a downward parabolic trend and a cyclical variation with a period of 88.2 yr. The downward parabola suggests a long-term decrease in the orbital period with $\dot{P}$ = -3.09$\times$$10^{-8}$ d $\textrm{yr}^{-1}$. The mass loss rate is estimated to be 4.54$\times$$10^{-9}$ M$_{\odot}$ $\textrm{yr}^{-1}$, which possibly due to magnetic stellar wind or hot spot. The cyclical variation might be caused by the light travel time effect via the presence of a third body with a minimum mass of $M_{3min}$ = 0.312 (21) M$_{\odot}$. Additionally, there are two possible celestial bodies in a 2:7 resonance orbit around CZ Aqr. The asymmetric light curve is explained by adding a hot spot on the surface of the primary star. After removing the binary model, 26 frequencies were extracted from TESS data. Two radial modes were newly identified among three possible independent frequencies. Our results show that the eclipsing Algol-type system is composed of a $\delta$ Sct primary star and a subgiant star in a quadruple system.

 - **Abstract**
 Aims. Our goals are to characterise the kinematic properties and to identify young and old stars among the M dwarfs of the CARMENES input catalogue. Methods. We compiled the spectral types, proper motions, distances, and radial velocities for 2187 M dwarfs. We used the public code SteParKin to derive their galactic space velocities and identify members in the different galactic populations. We also identified candidate members in young stellar kinematic groups, with ages ranging from 1 Ma to 800 Ma with SteParKin, LACEwING, and BANYAN {\Sigma}. We removed known close binaries and perform an analysis of kinematic, rotation, and activity indicators (rotational periods and projected velocities, Halpha, X-rays, and UV emission) for 1546 M dwarfs. We defined five rotation-activity-colour relations satisfied by young ({\tau} <= 800 Ma) stars. Results. We identified 191 young M dwarf candidates (~12%), 113 of which are newly recognised in this work. In this young sample, there are 118 very active stars based on H{\alpha} emission, fast rotation, and X-ray and UV emission excess. Of them, 27 have also strong magnetic fields, 9 of which are likely younger than 50 Ma. Additionally, there are 87 potentially young stars and 99 stars with a dubious youth classification, which may increase the fraction of young stars to an astounding 24%. Only one star out of the 2187 exhibits kinematics typical of the old Galactic halo. Conclusions. A combined analysis of kinematic and rotation-activity properties provides a robust method for identifying young M dwarfs from archival data. However, more observational efforts are needed to ascertain the true nature of numerous young star candidates in the field and, perhaps more importantly, to precisely quantify their age.
#### X-Shooting ULLYSES: Massive stars at low metallicity VI. Atmosphere and mass-loss properties of O-type giants in the Small Magellanic Cloud

 - **Abstract**
 Mass loss through a stellar wind is an important physical process that steers the evolution of massive stars and controls the properties of their end-of-life products, such as the supernova type and the mass of compact remnants. For an accurate mass loss determination, the inhomogeneities in the wind, known as clumping, needs to be taking into account. We aim to improve empirical estimates of mass loss and wind clumping for hot main-sequence massive stars, study the dependence of both properties on the metallicity, and compare the theoretical predictions to our findings. We analyzed the optical and UV spectra of 13 O-type stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud galaxy, which has a metallicity of $\sim 0.2\,Z_\odot$. We quantified the stellar atmosphere, outflow, and wind-clumping properties. To probe the role of metallicity, we compared our findings to studies of Galactic and Large Magellanic Cloud samples that were analyzed with similar methods. We find significant variations in the wind-clumping properties of the target stars, with clumping starting at flow velocities $0.01 - 0.23$ of the terminal wind velocity and reaching clumping factors $f_{\rm cl} = 2 - 30$. In the luminosity ($\log L / L_{\odot} = 5.0 - 6.0$) and metallicity ($Z/Z_{\odot} = 0.2 - 1$) range we considered, we find that the scaling of the mass loss $\dot{M}$ with metallicity $Z$ varies with luminosity. At $\log L/L_{\odot} = 5.75$, we find $\dot{M} \propto Z^m$ with $m = 1.02 \pm 0.30$, in agreement with pioneering work in the field. For lower luminosities, however, we obtain a significantly steeper scaling of $m > 2$. The monotonically decreasing $m(L)$ behavior adds a complexity to the functional description of the mass-loss rate of hot massive stars. Although the trend is present in the predictions, it is much weaker than we found here.
#### A Systematic Search for Candidate Supermassive Black Hole Binaries Using Periodic Mid-Infrared Light Curves of Active Galactic Nuclei

 - **Abstract**
 Periodic variability in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is a promising method for studying sub-parsec supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), which are a challenging detection target. While extensive searches have been made in the optical, X-ray and gamma-ray bands, systematic infrared (IR) studies remain limited. Using data from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), which provides unique decade-long mid-IR light curves with a six-month cadence, we have conducted the first systematic search for SMBHB candidates based on IR periodicity. Analyzing a parent sample of 48,932 objects selected from about half a million AGNs, we have identified 28 candidate periodic AGNs with periods ranging from 1,268 to 2,437 days (in the observer frame) by fitting their WISE light curves with sinusoidal functions. However, our mock simulation of the parent sample indicates that stochastic variability can actually produce a similar number of periodic sources, underscoring the difficulty in robustly identifying real periodic signals with WISE light curves, given their current sampling. Notably, we found no overlap between our sample and optical periodic sources, which can be explained by a distinct preference for certain periods due to selection bias. By combining archived data from different surveys, we have identified SDSS J140336.43+174136.1 as a candidate exhibiting periodic behavior in both optical and IR bands, a phenomenon that warrants further validation through observational tests. Our results highlight the potential of IR time-domain surveys, including future missions such as the Nancy Grace-Roman Space Telescope, for identifying periodic AGNs, but complementary tests are still needed to determine their physical origins such as SMBHBs.

 - **Abstract**
 We present polarization images with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) in A and B-array configurations at 6 GHz of 7 radio-loud (RL) quasars and 8 BL Lac objects belonging to the Palomar-Green (PG) `blazar' sample. This completes our arcsecond-scale polarization study of an optically-selected volume-limited blazar sample comprising 16 radio-loud quasars and 8 BL Lac objects. Using the VLA, we identify kpc-scale polarization in the cores and jets/lobes of all the blazars, with fractional polarization varying from around $0.8 \pm 0.3$% to $37 \pm 6$%. The kpc-scale jets in PG RL quasars are typically aligned along their parsec-scale jets and show apparent magnetic fields parallel to jet directions in their jets/cores and magnetic field compression in their hotspots. The quasars show evidence of interaction with their environment as well as restarted AGN activity through morphology, polarization and spectral indices. These quasi-periodic jet modulations and restarted activity may be indicative of an unstable accretion disk undergoing transition. We find that the polarization characteristics of the BL Lacs are consistent with their jets being reoriented multiple times, with no correlation between their core apparent magnetic field orientations and pc-scale jet directions. We find that the low synchrotron peaked BL Lacs show polarization and radio morphology features typical of `strong' jet sources as defined by Meyer et al. (2011) for the `blazar envelope scenario', which posits a division based on jet profiles and velocity gradients rather than total jet power.

 - **Abstract**
 High-mass young stellar objects (HMYSOs) can exhibit episodic bursts of accretion, accompanied by intense outflows and luminosity variations. Thermal Instability (TI) due to Hydrogen ionisation is among the most promising mechanisms of episodic accretion in low mass ($M_*\lesssim 1M_{\odot}$) protostars. Its role in HMYSOs has not yet been elucidated. Here, we investigate the properties of TI outbursts in young, massive ($M_*\gtrsim 5M_{\odot}$) stars, and compare them to those observed so far. Our simulations show that modelled TI bursts can replicate the durations and peak accretion rates of long (a few years to decades) outbursts observed in HMYSOs with similar mass characteristics. However, they struggle with short-duration (less than a year) bursts with short (a few weeks or months) rise times, suggesting the need for alternative mechanisms. Moreover, while our models match the durations of longer bursts, they fail to reproduce the multiple outbursts seen in some HMYSOs, regardless of model parameters. We also emphasise the significance of not just evaluating model accretion rates and durations, but also performing photometric analysis to thoroughly evaluate the consistency between model predictions and observational data. Our findings suggest that some other plausible mechanisms, such as gravitational instabilities and disc fragmentation can be responsible for generating the observed outburst phenomena in HMYSOs and underscore the need for further investigation into alternative mechanisms driving short outbursts. However, the physics of TI is crucial in sculpting the inner disc physics in the early bright epoch of massive star formation, and comprehensive parameter space exploration and the use of 2D modeling are essential for obtaining a more detailed understanding of the underlying physical processes.

 - **Abstract**
 The analysis of the rotation rate of individual sunspots and pores was performed according to the data of the processing of observations by the \textit{Solar Dynamics Observatory/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager} (SDO/HMI) in the period 2010\,--\,2024. Sunspots stood out in the images in the continuum. To accurately track the spots, we processed 5 images for each day. To determine the polarity of the magnetic field, we superimposed the contours of sunspots on observations of magnetic fields at the same time. This made it possible to track the movement of more than 210 thousand individual sunspots and pores. It is found that the rotation rate is influenced by the rotation rate of the solar atmosphere and the systematic proper motions of the spots. Sunspots and pores of the leading polarity have a rate of meridional movement $\approx 2.4\%$ faster than spots of the trailing polarity. We also found that regular sunspots, which have umbra and penumbra, rotate $\approx 1.5\%$ faster than solar pores, in which penumbra is absent. The dependence of the rotation rate on these area is found. For sunspots with an area of $S> 10$ $\mu$hm, the rotation rate is practically independent of these area. Small sunspots, with an area of lower than $S< 10$ $\mu$hm, rotate $\approx 1.7\%$ slower.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are bright milliseconds-duration radio bursts from cosmological distances. Despite intense observational and theoretical studies, their physical origin is still mysterious. One major obstacle is the lack of identification of multi-wavelength counterparts for FRBs at cosmological distances. So far, all the searches other than in the radio wavelength, including those in the gamma-ray energies, have only left upper limits. Here we report a gigaelectronvolt (GeV) gamma-ray flare lasting 15.6 seconds as well as additional evidence of variable gamma-ray emission in temporal and spatial association with the hyper-active, newly discovered repeating FRB 20240114A, which has been localized to a dwarf galaxy at a redshift of 0.13. The energetic, short GeV gamma-ray flare reached a prompt isotropic luminosity of the order of ${10}^{48}~{\rm ergs~{s}^{-1}}$. The additional less-significant gamma-ray flares, if true, also have similar luminosities; such flares could contribute to a 5-day average luminosity of the order of ${10}^{45}~{\rm ergs~{s}^{-1}}$. These high-luminosity flares challenge the traditional FRB engine scenario involving a seconds-period magnetar. Rather, it suggests a powerful, long-lived, but newborn energy source at the location of this active repeater, either directly powering the bursts or indirectly triggering bursts in the vicinity of the FRB engine.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the design, rationale, properties and catalogs of the MusE Gas FLOw and Wind survey (MEGAFLOW), a survey of the cool gaseous halos of $z\sim1$ galaxies using low-ionization MgII absorption systems. The survey consists of 22 quasar fields selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) having multiple ($\geq3$) strong MgII absorption lines over the redshift range $0.3<z<1.5$. Each quasar was observed with the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) and the Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph (UVES), for a total of 85~hr and 63~hr, respectively. The UVES data resulted in 127 MgII absorption lines over $0.25<z<1.6$, with a median rest-frame equivalent width (REW) $3\sigma$ limit of $\approx 0.05$~Å. The MUSE data resulted in $\sim$2400 galaxies of which 1403 with redshift confidence ZCONF$>1$, i.e. more than 60 galaxies per arcmin$^{2}$. They were identified using a dual detection algorithm based on both continuum and emission line objects. The achieved [OII] 50\%\ completeness is 3.7$\times 10^{-18}$ erg/s/cm$^2$ (corresponding to SFR$>0.01$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ at $z=1$) using realistic mock [OII] emitters and the 50\%\ completeness is $m_{F775W}\approx26$ AB magnitudes for continuum sources. We find that (i) the fraction of [OII] emitting galaxies which have no continuum is $\sim15$\%; (ii) the success rate in identifying at least one galaxy within 500 km/s and 100 kpc is $\approx90$\%\ for MgII absorptions with $W_r^{2796}\gtrsim0.5$~Å; (iii) the mean number of galaxies per MgII absorption is $2.9\pm1.6$ within the MUSE field-of-view; (iv) of the 80 MgII systems at $0.3<z<1.5$, 40 (20) have 1 (2) galaxies within 100 kpc, respectively; (v) all but two host galaxies have stellar masses $M_\star>10^9$ M$_\odot$, and star-formation rates $>1$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$.
#### The impact of disk-locking on convective turnover times of low-mass pre-main sequence and main sequence stars

 - **Abstract**
 The impact of disk-locking on the stellar properties related to magnetic activity from the theoretical point of view is investigated. We use the ATON stellar evolution code to calculate theoretical values of convective turnover times ($\tau_{\rm c}$) and Rossby numbers ($Ro$, the ratio between rotation periods and $\tau_{\rm c}$) for pre-main sequence (pre-MS) and main sequence (MS) stars. We investigate how $\tau_{\rm c}$ varies with the initial rotation period and with the disk lifetime, using angular momentum conserving models and models simulating the disk-locking mechanism. In the latter case, the angular velocity is kept constant, during a given locking time, to mimic the magnetic locking effects of a circumstellar disk. The local convective turnover times generated with disk-locking models are shorter than those obtained with angular momentum conserving models. The differences are smaller in the early pre-MS, increase with stellar age and become more accentuated for stars with $M$$\geq$$1 {\rm M}_{\odot}$ and ages greater than 100 Myr. Our new values of $\tau_{\rm c}$ were used to estimate $Ro$ for a sample of stars selected from the literature in order to investigate the rotation-activity relationship. We fit the data with a two-part power-law function and find the best fitting parameters of this relation. The differences we found between both sets of models suggest that the star's disk-locking phase properties affect its Rossby number and its position in the rotation-activity diagram. Our results indicate that the dynamo efficiency is lower for stars that had undergone longer disk-locking phases.
#### Machine Learning Approach for Estimating Magnetic Field Strength in Galaxy Clusters from Synchrotron Emission

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic fields play a crucial role in various astrophysical processes within the intracluster medium, including heat conduction, cosmic ray acceleration, and the generation of synchrotron radiation. However, measuring magnetic field strength is typically challenging due to the limited availability of Faraday Rotation Measure sources. To address the challenge, we propose a novel method that employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) alongside synchrotron emission observations to estimate magnetic field strengths in galaxy clusters. Our CNN model is trained on either Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence simulations or MHD galaxy cluster simulations, which incorporate complex dynamics such as cluster mergers and sloshing motions. The results demonstrate that CNNs can effectively estimate magnetic field strengths with median uncertainties of approximately $0.22\mu$G, $0.01\mu$G, and $0.1\mu$G for $\beta = 100$, 200, and 500 conditions, respectively. Additionally, we have confirmed that our CNN model remains robust against noise and variations in viewing angles with sufficient training, ensuring reliable performance under a wide range of observational conditions. We compare the CNN approach with the traditional magnetic field strength estimates method that assumes equipartition between cosmic ray electron energy and magnetic field energy. Unlike the equipartition method, this CNN approach does not rely on the equipartition assumption, offering a new perspective for comparing traditional estimates and enhancing our understanding of cosmic ray acceleration mechanisms.
#### Time-dependent metal ionization and the persistence of collisionally excited emission lines in the diffuse ionized gas of star forming galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 We extend our time-dependent hydrogen ionization simulations of diffuse ionized gas to include metals important for collisional cooling and diagnostic emission lines. The combination of heating from supernovae and time-dependent collisional and photoionization from midplane OB stars produces emission line intensities (and emission line ratios) that follow the trends observed in the Milky Way and other edge-on galaxies. The long recombination times in low density gas result in persistent large volumes of ions with high ionization potentials, such as O III and Ne III. In particular, the vertically extended layers of Ne III in our time-dependent simulations result in [Ne III] 15$\mu$m/[Ne II] 12$\mu$m emission line ratios in agreement with observations of the edge-on galaxy NGC 891. Simulations adopting ionization equilibrium do not allow for the persistence of ions with high ionization states and therefore cannot reproduce the observed emission lines from low density gas at high altitudes.

 - **Abstract**
 In recent years, it has become increasingly clear that space weather disturbances can be triggered by transient upstream mesoscale structures (TUMS), independently of the occurrence of large-scale solar wind (SW) structures, such as interplanetary coronal mass ejections and stream interaction regions. Different types of magnetospheric pulsations, transient perturbations of the geomagnetic field and auroral structures are often observed during times when SW monitors indicate quiet conditions, and have been found to be associated to TUMS. In this mini-review we describe the space weather phenomena that have been associated with four of the largest-scale and the most energetic TUMS, namely hot flow anomalies, foreshock bubbles, travelling foreshocks and foreshock compressional boundaries. The space weather phenomena associated with TUMS tend to be more localized and less intense compared to geomagnetic storms. However, the quiet time space weather may occur more often since, especially during solar minima, quiet SW periods prevail over the perturbed times.

 - **Abstract**
 There is still much uncertainty around the mechanism that rules the accretion of proto-planetary disks. In the last years, Magnetohydrondynamic (MHD) wind-driven accretion has been proposed as a valid alternative to the more conventional viscous accretion. In particular, winds have been shown to reproduce the observed correlation between the mass of the disk Md and the mass accretion rate onto the central star Macc, but this has been done only for specific conditions. It is not clear whether this implies fine tuning or if it is a general result. We investigate under which conditions the observed correlation between the mass of the disk Md and the mass accretion rate onto the central star Macc can be obtained. We find that, in the absence of a correlation between the initial mass M0 and the initial accretion timescale tacc,0, the slope of the Md-Macc correlation depends on the value of the spread of the initial conditions of masses and lifetimes of disks. Then, we clarify the conditions under which a disk population can be fitted with a single power-law. Moreover, we derive an analytical expression for the spread of log(Md/Macc) valid when the spread of tacc is taken to be constant. In the presence of a correlation between M0 and tacc,0, we derive an analytical expression for the slope of the Md-Macc correlation in the initial conditions of disks and at late times. We conclude that MHD winds can predict the observed values of the slope and the spread of the Md-Macc correlation under a broad range of initial conditions. This is a fundamental expansion of previous works on the MHD paradigm, exploring the establishment of this fundamental correlation beyond specific initial conditions.
