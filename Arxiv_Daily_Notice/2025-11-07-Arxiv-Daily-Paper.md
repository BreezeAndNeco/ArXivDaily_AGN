 - **Abstract**
 It is widely believed that the ultraviolet background produced during the epoch of reionization conspires against the formation of low-mass galaxies. Indeed, this mechanism is often invoked as a solution to the so-called `missing satellites problem.' In this paper we employ FIREbox, a large-volume cosmological simulation based on the Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE-2) physics model, to characterize the mechanisms governing galaxy ignition in the post-reionization era. By carefully matching recently-ignited halos (with stellar ages below $100$ Myr) to halos that failed to form any stars, we conclude that the presence of cold-dense gas and halo concentration help incite the process of galaxy formation. Concretely, we find that $100\%$ of recently-ignited halos experience cold-dense gas enhancements relative to their matched failed counterparts. Likewise, approximately $83\%$ display enhancements in both cold-dense gas and Navarro-Frenk-White concentration ($c_{\rm NFW}$), while the remaining $\sim17\%$ exhibit enhanced cold-dense gas content and suppressed $c_{\rm NFW}$ values. Lastly, our simulation suggests that galaxy ignition can occur as late as $z=2$, potentially allowing us to observationally catch this process `in the act' in the forseeable future.

 - **Abstract**
 The James Webb Space Telecope (JWST) opened a new window for the study of the highest redshift ($z>7$) Universe. This work presents a theoretical investigation of the very-high redshift Universe using the state-of-the-art GALaxy Evolution and Assembly (GAEA) model, run on merger trees from the Planck-Millennium $N$-body simulation. We show that GAEA successfully reproduces a wide range of high-$z$ observational estimates including: the galaxy stellar mass function up to $z\sim13$ and the total (galaxies and AGN) UV luminosity function (LF) up to $z\sim10$. We find that the AGN UV emission represents an important contribution at the bright end of the UVLF up to $z\sim8$, but it is negligible at higher redshift. Our model reproduces well the observed mass-metallicity relation at $z\leq4$, while it slightly overestimates the normalization of the relation at earlier cosmic epochs. At $z\geq11$, current UVLF estimates are at least one order of magnitude larger than model predictions. We investigate the impact of different physical mechanisms, such as an enhanced star formation efficiency coupled with a reduced stellar feedback or a negligible stellar feedback at $z>10$. In the framework of our model, both the galaxy stellar mass and UV luminosity functions at $z\geq10$ can be explained by assuming feedback-free starbursts in high-density molecular clouds. However, we show that this model variant leads to a slight increase of the normalization of the $z\geq10$ mass-metallicity relation, strengthening the tension with available data. A model with negligible stellar feedback at $z>10$ also predicts larger numbers of massive and bright galaxies aligning well with observations, but it also overestimates the metallicity of the interstellar medium. We show that these model variants can in principle be discriminated using the relation between the star formation rate and galaxy stellar mass.

 - **Abstract**
 Light orbiting an accreting black hole may impact the disk or jet multiple times before escaping to the observer, at a variety of angles with respect to the local magnetic field. In this letter, we characterize the imprints of these long path lengths and disparate magnetic field impacts in synchrotron spectra of hot accretion disks, as the strongly lensed ``photon ring'' exhibits a higher synchrotron turnover frequency in each lensed sub-image. We apply tools of varying complexity: first, we develop a minimal, unlensed one-zone model that isolates the first two sub-images of the accretion flow. By varying the magnetic field geometry encountered by each sub-image, we show that distinctive spectral signatures emerge in both total intensity and fractional linear polarization. Second, we examine a semi-analytic radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) model, in which we find that there is generally a frequency at which the first indirect image outshines the direct image even in total flux density. Lastly, we demonstrate that even general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulation snapshots show this spectral character. We find a typical correction to the unresolved spectrum of order $10\%$ near the turnover frequency that grows with increasing viewing inclination, growing to order unity at higher frequencies. We predict sensitive spectral studies of the cores of Messier 87* and Sagittarius A* at frequencies exceeding $300$ GHz to constrain the existence of the photon ring even without imaging, with prospects for photon ring detection even in other sources with unresolved shadows.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar activity is a process driven by many independent but interconnected phenomena. Although the 11-year cycle is the result of operation of the dynamo mechanism, the cause of longer secular variations is not clear. In search of such a cause, it was proposed to take into account the influence of the planetary system. In order to verify the idea, we consider the action of all planets in the solar system reduced to the effect of a single barycenter. The tidal force is decomposed into radial and meridional components. The radial tidal force is too small compared to the powerful radial gravity of the Sun. The meridional force is not compensated for by solar gravity and depends on latitude. As the latitude of the barycenter changes quite slowly, the sign of this component changes over a characteristic time scale of about 5 years, during which the meridional acceleration constantly acts on the surface of the Sun. This could ultimately lead to speeds of several meters per second and, in principle, could significantly change the speeds of the meridional currents involved in generating the magnetic field. However, it turned out that the calculated speed variation does not agree with the observed periodicity of solar activity. Earlier, the relation was analyzed between the activity periods on solar-type stars and the rotation periods of exoplanets, and no correspondence was observed either. Thus, the planetary hypothesis as a cause of long-term modulation of solar activity is not confirmed.

 - **Abstract**
 Stars embedded in the inner pc region of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) experience extreme accretion conditions that significantly alter their evolution. We present one-dimensional MESA simulations of stars growing and decaying within AGN disks, implementing radiative-feedback-regulated accretion which limits stellar growth near the Eddington luminosity, as well as wind-driven mass loss. Unlike stand-alone stars in the field, these embedded stars follow unique evolutionary tracks with well-determined mass evolution and chemical yields. We distinguish two regimes: ``immortal" stars that indefinitely remain on the main sequence due to efficient hydrogen mixing; and ``metamorphic" stars that evolves off the main sequence, ultimately enriching the disk with heavy elements upon hydrogen and helium exhaustion in their cores. Results indicate that embedded stars in AGN disks can attain large masses, but gas retention and limited mixing likely render the ``immortal" track unsustainable. We show radiative feedback plays a critical role in preventing runaway growth, since it regulates the inflow to at most of order-unity the Eddington-limited mass-loss rate. Embedded metamorphic stars significantly enrich AGN disks with helium and $\alpha$-elements, potentially explaining the observed high metallicity in broad-line regions (BLR) without excessive helium enrichment. This study underscores the critical interplay between stellar feedback and accretion physics in shaping the stellar populations and chemical evolution within AGN disks.

 - **Abstract**
 During mid-May 2024, active region (AR) 13664 produced a series of M- and X-class flares along with several coronal mass ejections (CMEs) that resulted in exceptionally strong aurora at Earth. This study presents in-situ solar energetic particle (SEP) ion composition data from Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory Ahead (STA), Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE), and Parker Solar Probe (PSP) as their magnetic connectivity to AR 13664 varied throughout the event period. Between 08 to 24 May, STA was separated by 12° in longitude from ACE at 0.96 AU. SEP intensities rose gradually due to merged CMEs from AR 13664. On 13 May, an M6 flare was followed by a rapid-onset SEP event at STA, although velocity dispersion analysis yielded no clear path length or release time. PSP, 95° longitudinally separated from Earth at 0.74 AU, observed gradually increasing SEP intensities beginning 11 May, followed by a jump in both SEP intensity and magnetic field (>100 nT) on 16 May. These early event intervals display stepwise SEP increases, consistent with the passage of successive CMEs. On 20 May, an X16.5 flare from AR 13664 produced an Fe-rich SEP event observed at all three spacecraft despite their wide longitudinal separations. Throughout the period, Fe/O ratios ranged from <0.01 to >0.8 and increased with energy between 1 to 100 MeV/nuc. This trend deviates from the typical energy-dependent decrease expected from diffusive shock acceleration and suggests more complex scenarios, possibly involving variable suprathermal seed populations or species-dependent transport.

 - **Abstract**
 A head-tail galaxy is thought to be a radio galaxy with bent active galactic nuclei (AGN) jets interacting with the intracluster medium (ICM). Study of head-tail galaxies provides us with fruitful insights into the mechanisms of shock waves and turbulence, as well as magnetic-field amplification and cosmic-ray acceleration. A recent MeerKAT observation revealed that a head-tail galaxy in the galaxy cluster, Abell 3322, exhibits a peculiar ``Omega" structure in its shape. In this paper, we investigated this Omega-tail galaxy using the upgraded Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope (GMRT) and the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). We found that the southern jet tends to be brighter than the northern jet, with a brightness ratio of about 2. This can be attributed to Doppler boost and the inclination of the jets. Our broadband data suggest that the radio spectrum becomes steeper along the jet propagation direction, and the cosmic-ray aging model with a weak reacceleration of cosmic rays is preferable to explain the index profile. We further found a gradient of the spectral index perpendicular to the jet propagation. We discussed the origin of the gradient and suggested that a shock wave along one side of the jets is present. The resultant ram pressure as well as the backflow made at the early stage of the jet may produce the tail component of this Omega-tail galaxy, while the observed Omega-shape structure is more likely due to a twin vortex seen in the low Reynolds number flow.

 - **Abstract**
 Transport coefficients are calculated for a partially ionized plasma consisting of approximately 90% hydrogen and 10\% helium, representative of a model solar atmosphere with an assumed magnetic field profile. The ion Hall parameter, defined as the ratio of ion cyclotron to ion collision frequency, is determined by considering dominant resonance charge exchange processes alongside less significant nonresonant ion neutral collisions. Based on these calculations, we derive profiles for various transport coefficients. Our results demonstrate that thermal conductivity in partially ionized media, both parallel and perpendicular to the ambient magnetic field, is dominated by neutral particles. The perpendicular thermal conductivity components show weak dependence on the ion Hall parameter and remain comparable in magnitude to their parallel counterparts. Wave damping through neutral thermal conductivity may contribute significantly to solar atmospheric heating. These findings indicate that perpendicular thermal conductivity components are essential for accurate modelling of partially ionized regions, including photosphere-chromosphere transition layers, spicules, and coronal prominences.

 - **Abstract**
 We characterize the physical conditions and energy budget of the M16 H II region using SOFIA FEEDBACK observations of the [C II] 158 $\mu$m line. The O stars in the $\sim 10^{4}~{\rm M}_{\odot}$ NGC 6611 cluster powering this H II region have blown at least 2 cavities into the giant molecular cloud: the large M16 cavity and the small N19 bubble. We detect the spectroscopic signature of an expanding photodissociation region shell towards N19, and traces of a thin, fragmented expanding shell towards M16. Our [C II] observations are resolved to 0.5 km s$^{-1}$ and 15.5$^{\prime\prime}$ and analyzed alongside similarly resolved CO J=3$-$2 observations as well as archival data ranging from the radio to X-ray tracing a variety of gas phases spanning dense $\sim$10 K molecular gas, $10^{4}$ K photoionized gas, and million-K collisionally ionized plasma. With this dataset, we evaluate the coupling of energetic feedback from NGC 6611 and the O9 V star within N19 to the surrounding gas. Winds from NGC 6611 have blown a 20 pc radius cavity constrained in size along the major axis of the natal giant molecular filament, and much of the mechanical wind energy ($>$90%) has escaped through breaches in the $\lesssim 10^{4}~{\rm M}_{\odot}$ shell. Reservoirs of dense gas remain within a few parsecs of the cluster. N19, younger than M16 by $\gtrsim 10^6$ yr, is driven by a combination of mechanical wind energy and thermal pressure from photoionized gas and has swept up $\sim 10^{3}~{\rm M}_{\odot}$ into neutral atomic and molecular shells.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence plays a central role in many astrophysical processes in the interstellar medium (ISM), including star formation, heat conduction, and cosmic-ray scattering. MHD turbulence can be decomposed into three fundamental modes-fast, slow, and Alfvén-each contributing differently to the dynamics of the medium. However, characterizing and separating the energy fractions of these modes was challenging due to the limited information available from observations. To address this difficulty, we use 3D isothermal and multiphase MHD turbulence simulations to examine how mode energy fractions vary under different physical conditions. Overall, we find that the Alfvén and slow modes carry comparable kinetic-energy fractions and together dominate the turbulent energy budget in multiphase media, while the fast mode contributes the smallest fraction. Relative to isothermal conditions, multiphase simulations exhibit an enhanced fast-mode energy fraction. We further introduce a machine-learning-based approach that employs a conditional Residual Neural Network to infer these fractions directly from spectroscopic data. The method leverages the fact that the three MHD modes imprint distinct morphological signatures in spectroscopic maps owing to their differing anisotropies and compressibilities. Our model is trained on a suite of isothermal and multiphase simulations covering typical ISM conditions. We further demonstrate that our machine learning model can robustly recover the mode fractions from spectroscopic observables, achieving mean absolute errors of approximately 0.05 for seen data and 0.1 for unseen data.

 - **Abstract**
 Dwarf nova (DN) superoutbursts are accompanied by superhumps, which change their periods and profiles over a superoutburst. We present the TESS and ground-based observations of nine WZ Sge-type DNe and candidates in superoutburst. In TCP J23580961$+$5502508, ASASSN-23ba, PNV J19030433$-$3102187, V748 Hya, and ASASSN-25ci, we confirmed double-peaked oscillations called early superhumps, which are regarded as the unambiguous feature of WZ Sge-type DNe. On the other hand, the superhump and outburst properties of MO Psc and V1676 Her suggest that they may not be a member of WZ Sge-type DNe. The 2022 superoutburst of a confirmed WZ Sge-type DN TCP J05515391$+$6504346, however, lacked an early superhump phase. We find superhumps in a WZ Sge-type DN ASASSN-20mq during its rebrightening outburst. Thanks to the continuous coverage of TESS, we find the broken-powerlaw rise of the outburst light curve in V748 Hya and PNV J19030433$-$3102187, previously found in only one WZ Sge-type DN observed by Kepler. Early superhumps appeared when the system reached $\simeq40$% of the outburst peak flux. No orbital modulation from a hot spot is detected before and after this. This non-detection of orbital humps on the early rise of V748 Hya constrains that the corresponding mass transfer rate should be below $\simeq1\times10^{16}$ g s$^{-1}$, disfavouring an enhancement of a mass transfer rate by an order of magnitude or larger, even if it occurs. The contentious TESS observations also confirm the coexistence of early and ordinary superhumps during their transition and $\leq$2-cycle duration of stage A--B superhump transition in V748 Hya.
#### Hadronic Processes in Advection-Dominated Accretion Flow as the Origin of TeV Excesses in BL Lac Objects

 - **Abstract**
 The spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of certain BL Lac objects (BL Lacs) exhibit an additional hard $\gamma$-ray component in the TeV energy range that surpasses the predictions of the one-zone leptonic jet model. The origin of this excess emission remains unclear. In this study, we selected five BL Lacs whose SEDs display a very hard intrinsic spectrum in the TeV band and successfully reproduced their broadband SEDs using a two-zone lepto-hadronic model. Within this framework, the emission observed in the optical, X-ray, GeV $\gamma$-ray, and sub-TeV $\gamma$-ray bands is modeled using the synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton radiation processes of the relativistic electrons in the jets. Meanwhile, the TeV excess is attributed to $\gamma$-ray emission resulting from the photomeson ($p\gamma$) process via $\pi^0$ decay occurring within advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs). This scenario requires a hard proton spectrum with a spectral index of $p \sim 1.6-1.7$ and a cutoff energy ranging from 30 to 90 TeV, as well as a relatively large ADAF radius. Such hard proton spectra suggest that the dominant acceleration mechanisms are likely magnetic reconnection and/or stochastic acceleration processes within ADAFs. Additionally, the emission from the cascaded electrons results in a bump in the keV--MeV band; however, it is overwhelmed by the jet emission. Although the hadronuclear ($pp$) process cannot be entirely ruled out, it would necessitate an even harder proton spectrum and a higher cutoff energy compared to the $p\gamma$ process, making it a less favorable explanation for the observed TeV excess.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar filaments are cool and dense plasma structures suspended in the solar corona against gravity. We present observations of a quiescent filament eruption that occurs on 13 July 2015. The eruption is associated with a two-ribbon GOES B8.9 class flare. Photospheric magnetic flux cancellation is present below the filament during days. This builds up a flux rope which progressively rises until it gets unstable, first leading to a confined eruption and pre-flare brightenings, then to an ejection which starts $\approx$ 20 min later with the flare onset. An interesting feature of this event is the presence of a large circular brightening formed around the erupting region. This brightening is produced due to interchange reconnection of the ejected magnetic configuration with the surrounding open magnetic field. This null-point topology is confirmed by a potential-field extrapolation. The EUV loops located on the southern side of the filament eruption first contract during the null-point reconnection, then expand as the flux rope is ejected. The associated CME has both a classical flux rope shape and plasma ejected along open field lines on the flux rope side (a trace of interchange reconnection). Finally, we set all this disparate observations within a coherent framework where magnetic reconnection occurs both below and above the erupting filament.

 - **Abstract**
 Most of the physical information about astrophysical objects is obtained via the analysis of their electromagnetic spectra. Observed data coupled with radiation transfer models in physical conditions representative of stars, planets, kilonovae, and ISM, yield constrains on their physical structure, gas flow dynamics at the surface, mass loss, and detailed chemical composition of the systems. All these core astrophysical parameters are just as reliable as the physical quality of the models that are employed for simulations of radiation transfer. Recent advances in multi-D transfer modeling with Non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (NLTE) in inhomogeneous time-dependent systems revealed systematic shortcomings of canonical models. Owing to major complexities of solving coupled multi-frequency RT equations in 3D geometry, a number of approximations have been introduced. This review presents an overview of the physical problem, standard solutions, and recent methodological advances. We also provide an overview of main results in the area of 3D NLTE radiation transfer and its applications to modeling diverse astrophysical environments, including FGKM type- and OBA-type stars, multi-epoch spectra of kilonovae, and atmospheres of rocky and gaseous exoplanets.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigated a volume-limited sample of LAMOST main-sequence stars with masses from 0.25 to 1 $M_{\odot}$ and distances of 150-350 pc to explore how the stellar initial mass function (IMF) varies with metallicity. We corrected the spectroscopic selection function by comparing the stellar number densities with the photometric ones at the same colour and magnitude. From these corrected number density distributions, we derived IMFs for each metallicity sub-samples. Fitting a broken power-law function in each IMF with a fixed break point at 0.525 $M_{\odot}$, we found the power-law indices increase with [Fe/H] for both mass regimes: $\alpha_1$ (mass $\leq$ 0.525 $M_{\odot}$) rises from 0.54 $\pm$ 0.21 to 1.40 $\pm$ 0.07 and $\alpha_2$ (mass>0.525 $M_{\odot}$) grows from 1.40 $\pm$ 0.16 to 1.86 $\pm$ 0.04 as [Fe/H] varies from -1 to +0.5 dex. It demonstrates that low-mass stars make up a larger fraction in metal-rich environments than in metal-poor ones. We performed simulations to assess the impact of unresolved binaries on the IMF power-law indices. After correction, the binary-adjusted $\alpha$ values retained a similar metallicity-dependent trend. Furthermore, by examining the IMF of the aggregate sample, we found the corrected indices ($\alpha_{\rm{1,corr}} = 1.48 \pm 0.03$ , $\alpha_{\rm{2,corr}} = 2.17 \pm 0.03$) are consistent with Kroupa's IMF values ($\alpha_1 = 1.3 \pm 0.5$ and $\alpha_2 = 2.3 \pm 0.3$). Finally, we verified the robustness of our results by testing different break points and mass bin sizes, confirming that the IMF's dependence on [Fe/H] remains consistent.
#### Massive stars exploding in a He-rich circumstellar medium XII. SN 2024acyl: A fast, linearly declining Type Ibn supernova with early flash-ionisation features

 We present a photometric and spectroscopic analysis of the Type Ibn supernova (SN) 2024acyl. It rises to an absolute magnitude peak of about -17.58 mag in 10.6 days, and displays a rapid linear post-peak light-curve decline in all bands, similar to most SNe Ibn. The optical pseudobolometric light curve peaks at ($3.5\pm0.8) \times 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$, with a total radiated energy of $(5.0\pm0.4) \times 10^{48}$ erg. The spectra are dominated by a blue continuum at early stages, with narrow P-Cygni \Hei~lines and flash-ionisation emission lines of C {\sc iii}, N {\sc iii}, and He {\sc ii}. The P-Cygni \Hei~features gradually evolve and become emission-dominated in late-time spectra. The \Ha~line is detected throughout the entire spectral evolution, which indicates that the CSM is helium-rich with some residual amount of H. Our multiband light-curve modelling yields estimates of the ejecta mass of $M_{ej}$ = $0.98^{+0.30}_{-0.20} \, \msun$, with a kinetic energy of $E_{k} = 0.13^{+0.03}_{-0.02} \times 10^{51}$ erg, and a $^{56}Ni$ mass of $M_{\mathrm{Ni}} = 0.017 \, \msun$. The inferred CSM properties are characterised by a mass of $M_{\rm{CSM}} = 0.39^{+0.04}_{-0.04}$ \msun, an inner radius of $R_0$=$15.6^{+1.9}_{-2.0}$ AU, and a density $\rho_{CSM} = (1.32\pm0.22)\times10^{-11} \, \mathrm{g\,cm^{-3}}$. The multi-epoch spectra are well reproduced by the CMFGEN/ \texttt{he4p0} model, corresponding to a He-ZAMS mass of 4~M$_\odot$. These findings are consistent with a scenario of an SN powered by ejecta-CSM interaction, originating from a low-mass helium star that evolved within an interacting binary system where the CSM with some residual hydrogen may originate from the mass-transfer process. In addition, a channel of core-collapse explosion of a late-type Wolf-Rayet star with H, or an Ofpe/WN9 star with fallback accretion, cannot be entirely ruled out.

 - **Abstract**
 In our alternative theory, built around the coincidence of experimental and theoretical data, three "free" parameters -- the magnetic field in the tachocline of the order of ~10^7 G (see Fig.(A.1) and Eq.(A17) in V. D. Rusov et al. (2021)), the axion mass ma ~3.2*10^{-2} eV (see Eq. (11) in V. D. Rusov et al. (2021)), and the asymmetric dark matter (ADM) in the Universe with mADM ~5 GeV ((see V. D. Rusov et al. (2021); A. C. Vincent et al. (2016)) -- give a complete solution to the problem of the theory of magnetic flux tubes in strong fields with 11-year variations of axion-origin photons, which are caused by and anticorrelated to the 11-year variations in density of ADM, gravitationally captured on the Sun.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultra-hot Jupiters (UHJs) in close orbits around early-type stars provide natural laboratories for studying atmospheric escape and star-planet interactions under extreme irradiation and wind conditions. The near-ultraviolet (NUV) regime is particularly sensitive to extended upper atmospheric and magnetospheric structures. We investigate whether star-planet interactions in the WASP-189 system could plausibly account for the early ingress feature suggested by NUV transit fitting models. We analyzed three NUV transits of WASP-189b observed as part of the Colorado Ultraviolet Transit Experiment (CUTE), which employs a 6U CubeSat dedicated to exoplanet spectroscopy. To explore whether the observed transit asymmetry could plausibly arise from a magnetospheric bow shock (MBS), we performed magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations using representative stellar wind velocities and planetary atmospheric densities. During Visit 3, we identified an approximately 31.5-minute phase offset that is consistent with an early ingress. Our MHD simulations indicate that with a wind speed of 573 km s-1 and an upper atmospheric density of about 4.6e-11 kg m-3, a higher-density zone due to compression can form ahead of the planet within five planetary radii where the fast-mode Mach number falls below ~0.56, even without a MBS. Shock cooling and crossing time estimates suggest that such a pileup could produce detectable NUV absorption. Our results indicate that while MBS formation is feasible for WASP-189b, low stellar-wind speeds favor NUV-detectable magnetic pileups over classical bow shocks and enhance the potential detectability of early-ingress signatures.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we conduct a comparative analysis of observations carried out on the exoplanet HAT-P-25 b at the Sharjah Astronomical Observatory (SAO). We have employed two distinct filters, namely, the Luminoso (L) and Visual (V) filters. Our research aims to discern any variations in transit depth or exoplanet size resulting from the use of these different filters. The primary focus of this study is to determine the exoplanet's size relative to its host star using the transit method. The application of different filters was expected to introduce subtle variations in size, influenced by factors such as the exoplanet's atmosphere. Notably, our findings reveal that the exoplanet's size appears larger when observed through the L filter compared to the V filter. Throughout the analytical process, we employed the TRASCA model to determine the transit depth for each epoch. Fixed parameters, including the orbital period of the exoplanet (P, measured in days) and the transit duration (measured in minutes), were utilized in these calculations. Our results indicate that the transit depths observed with the L filter were greater than those with the V filter, measuring 0.0238 magnitudes and 0.0200 magnitudes, respectively. These values deviate from the reference result of 0.0204 magnitudes.

 - **Abstract**
 Coagulation of dust particles in protoplanetary disks is the first step on the journey to the formation of planets. The surface free energy (SFE) of the dust particles determines the effectiveness of particles sticking to each other after collision, as well as the critical collision velocity above which fragmentation will occur. Studies of SFE have focused on the simplest silicate, silica, usually at standard temperature and pressure. However, protoplanetary dust grains have a wide variety of mineralogical compositions, temperatures, and a low-pressure environment lacking in water vapor. We perform molecular dynamics simulations using a ReaxFF-type potential of the SFE of silica, albite, and anorthite at temperatures ranging from 30 to 700 K in a true vacuum. We find that the SFE drops by tens of percent with increasing temperature or shifting to more complex silicate compositions. More dramatically, we find that the values of the SFE in a vacuum are two orders of magnitude higher than those usually measured in terrestrial laboratories. Our results confirm previous work that suggests that hydroxylation by monolayers of water produces this reduction in SFE in experiments. The coagulation of dust grains thus appears to depend critically on the cleanliness of their surfaces, as well as their temperature and composition.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations from JWST have revealed unexpectedly luminous galaxies, exhibiting stellar masses and luminosities significantly higher than predicted by theoretical models at Cosmic Dawn. In this study, we present a suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations targeting high-redshift ($z \geq 10$) galaxies with dark matter halo masses in the range $10^{10} - 10^{11}\ {\rm M}_{\odot}$ at $z=10$, using state-of-the-art galaxy formation simulation codes (Enzo, Ramses, Changa, Gadget-3, Gadget-4, and Gizmo). This study aims to evaluate the convergence of the participating codes and their reproducibility of high-redshift galaxies with the galaxy formation model calibrated at relatively low redshift, without additional physics for high-redshift environments. The subgrid physics follows the AGORA CosmoRun framework, with adjustments to resolution and initial conditions to emulate similar physical environments in the early universe. The participating codes show consistent results for key galaxy properties (e.g., stellar mass), but also reveal notable differences (e.g., metallicity), indicating that galaxy properties at high redshifts are highly sensitive to the feedback implementation of the simulation. Massive halos (${\rm M}_{\rm halo}\geq5\times10^{10}\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$ at $z=10$) succeed in reproducing observed stellar masses, metallicities, and UV luminosities at $10\leq z\leq12$ without requiring additional subgrid physics, but tend to underpredict those properties at higher redshift. We also find that varying the dust-to-metal ratio modestly affects UV luminosity of simulated galaxies, whereas the absence of dust significantly enhances it. In future work, higher-resolution simulations will be conducted to better understand the formation and evolution of galaxies at Cosmic Dawn.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive study on the physical and chemical structures of a chemically rich bipolar outflow in a high-mass star forming region IRAS 16272$-$4837 (SDC335), utilizing high-resolution spectral line data at 1.3 mm and 3 mm dual-bands from the ALMA ATOMS and QUARKS surveys. The high-velocity jet is enveloped by a lower-velocity outflow cavity, containing bright knots that show enhanced molecular intensities and elevated excitation temperatures. Along the outflow, we have identified 35 transitions from 22 molecular species. By analyzing the spatial distribution and kinematics of these molecular lines, we find that the molecular inventory in the outflow is regulated by three processes: (i) direct entrainment from the natal molecular core by the outflow; (ii) shock-induced release of molecules or atoms from dust grains; and (iii) thermal desorption and gas-phase reactions driven by shock heating. These results confirm that outflows are not only dynamical structures but also active chemical factories, where entrainment, shocks, and thermal processing jointly enrich the molecular content. Our findings confirmed that outflow chemistry has multi-origin nature, and provide critical insights into chemical evolution during high-mass star formation.

 - **Abstract**
 We demonstrate that the properties of eccentric gravitational wave (GW) signals enhance the detectability of GW phase shifts caused by environmental effects (EEs): The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of EEs can be boosted by up to $\ell_{\rm max}^{1 - n}$ with respect to corresponding circular signals, where $\ell_{\rm max}$ is the highest modeled eccentric GW harmonic and $n$ is the frequency scaling of the GW dephasing prescription associated to the EE. We investigate the impact on a population level, adopting plausible eccentricity distributions for binary sources observed by LIGO/Virgo/Kagra (A+ and A\# sensitivities), as well as Cosmic Explorer (CE) and the Einstein Telescope (ET). For sources in the high eccentricity tail of a distribution ($e \gtrsim 0.2$ at 10 Hz), phase shifts can systematically be up to $\ell_{\rm max}^{1 - n}$ times smaller than in a corresponding circular signal and still be detectable. For typical EEs, such as Roemer delays and gas drag, this effect amounts to SNR enhancements that range from $10^2$ up to $10^5$. For CE and ET, our analysis shows that EEs will be an ubiquitous feature in the eccentric tail of merging binaries, regardless of the specific details of the formation channel. Additionally, we find that the joint analysis of eccentricity and phase shift is already plausible in current catalogs if a fraction of binaries merge in AGN migration traps.

 - **Abstract**
 The coexistence of PAHs and the C$_{60}$ fullerene in different astrophysical environments can give rise to the formation of new complex species denoted as PAH-C$_{60}$ adducts, which may contribute to the infrared (IR) emission observed. These PAH-C$_{60}$ adducts have been previously reported experimentally due to the high reactivity between PAHs and C$_{60}$. From the astrophysical point of view, however, they have not been considered in detail yet. Here we have performed a combined experimental and theoretical study in order to characterize the IR spectra of PAH-C$_{60}$ adducts, including multiple adducts. By using new advanced experimental techniques, we have been able to synthesize some specific PAH-C$_{60}$ adduct isomers, and measured their IR spectra. These experimental data are used to correct their harmonic scaled spectra, as obtained from quantum-chemistry calculations performed at the DFT level under the B3LYP-GD3/6-31+G(d) approach. This way, we simulate the IR ($\sim$3$-$25 $\mu$m) spectra of multiple PAH-C$_{60}$ adducts, composed by a different number of PAH units: mostly one or two units. In addition, the chemical kinetics data available in the literature are used to tentatively estimate the possible order of magnitude of the abundances of these PAH-C$_{60}$ adducts using the available observational data. Essentially, our results reveal a possible strong modification of the IR spectra when astronomically estimated abundances are considered. Several spectral peculiarities are observed, such as a broad $\sim$3.4-3.6 $\mu$m feature, and important modifications in the 6-10 and 12-16 $\mu$m spectral regions together with contributions to the C$_{60}$ features at 7.0 and 18.9 $\mu$m. Interestingly, these PAH-C$_{60}$ adducts lack aliphatic CH bonds, but they display IR features around 3.4 $\mu$m, challenging previous interpretations of this astronomical feature.

 - **Abstract**
 Large-amplitude turbulence -- characterized by a fluctuating magnetic field component, $\delta B$, that is stronger than the mean component, $B_0$ -- is generically intermittent, populated with intense localized structures such as sharp field-line bends and rapid field reversals. Recent MHD simulations suggest that these structures play an important role in particle transport and acceleration; however, MHD is inapplicable in most of our Universe, where the plasma is so hot or diffuse that Coulomb collisions are negligible. Therefore, in this paper, we analyze the intermittent properties of collisionless large-amplitude turbulence in electron-positron plasmas via fully kinetic 3D simulations, exploring a wide range of $\delta B / B_0$ and scale separations between the turbulence driving scale, $L$, and kinetic scales, $c/\omega_{\rm p}$. The steady-state collisionless turbulence in our simulations broadly resembles that of MHD, but the development of pressure anisotropy steepens the scaling between magnetic field strength, $B$, and scalar field-line curvature, $K_\parallel$ -- yielding $B \propto K_\parallel^{-3/4}$ -- and consequently modifies the power-law slope of the probability density function of $K_\parallel$; this slope hardens from $K_\parallel^{-2.5}$ to $K_\parallel^{-2.0}$ as $\delta B / B_0$ increases from 4 to 140. Pressure anisotropy also triggers mirror and firehose instabilities, with the volume-filling fractions of these fluctuations increasing with $\delta B / B_0$; for our largest $\delta B / B_0$, $20\%$ of the volume is mirror-unstable and $6\%$ is firehose-unstable. Both the curvature and the Larmor-scale fluctuations in collisionless large-amplitude turbulence are expected to significantly influence cosmic ray transport and acceleration in the interstellar medium of our Galaxy and the intracluster medium of galaxy clusters.
