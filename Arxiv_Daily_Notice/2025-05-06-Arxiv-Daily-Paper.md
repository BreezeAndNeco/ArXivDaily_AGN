#### A XRISM Observation of the Archetypal Radio-Mode Feedback System Hydra-A: Measurements of Atmospheric Motion and Constraints on Turbulent Dissipation

 - **Abstract**
 We present XRISM Resolve observations centered on Hydra-A, a redshift z = 0.054 brightest cluster galaxy which hosts one of the largest and most powerful FR-I radio sources in the nearby Universe. We examine the effects of its high jet power on the velocity structure of the cluster's hot atmosphere. Hydra-A's central radio jets have inflated X-ray cavities with energies upward of $10^{61}~\rm erg$. They reach altitudes of 225 kpc from the cluster center, well beyond the atmosphere's central cooling region. Resolve's $3\times3$ arcmin field-of-view covers $190\times190$ kpc, which encompasses most of the cooling volume. We find a one dimensional atmospheric velocity dispersion across the volume of $164\pm10\,\rm{km\,s}^{-1}$. The fraction in isotropic turbulence or unresolved bulk velocity is unknown. Assuming pure isotropic turbulence, the turbulent kinetic energy is $2.5\,\%$ of the thermal energy radiated away over the cooling timescale, implying that kinetic energy must be supplied continually to offset cooling. While Hydra-A's radio jets are powerful enough to supply kinetic energy to the atmosphere at the observed level, turbulent dissipation alone would struggle to offset cooling throughout the cooling volume. The central galaxy's radial velocity is similar to the atmospheric velocity, with an offset of $-37 \pm 23\,$ km s$^{-1}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy groups and clusters are one of the best probes of structure formation and growth in a cosmological context. Most of their baryonic component is dominated by the intracluster medium (ICM), whose thermodynamical properties serve as indicators of the halo's dynamical state and can be used for the halo mass determination in the self-similar scenario. However, baryonic processes, such as AGN feedback and gas cooling, may affect the global properties of the ICM, especially in the group regime. These effects might lead to deviations from self-similar predictions in galaxy groups' scaling relations, while they remain in place for massive galaxy clusters. Additionally, the low-mass end of the scaling relations, ranging from $10^{13}$ to $10^{14} M_\odot$, remains unclear and poorly populated, as current X-ray surveys detect only the brightest groups. Here, we present the Mass-Temperature relation across the full mass range, from massive clusters to low-mass groups ($10^{13}M_\odot$), as observed by eROSITA. Using spectral stacking from eROSITA eRASS1 data for optically selected galaxy groups, we find that, in the lower mass range, galaxy groups follow the power-law relation known for galaxy clusters. We further validate these results by conducting the same stacking procedure on mock eRASS:4 data using the Magneticum hydrodynamical simulation. This indicates that AGN feedback is more likely to affect the distribution of baryons in the intragroup medium rather than the overall halo gas temperature. No significant changes in the Mass-Temperature relation slope suggest that temperature can serve as a reliable mass proxy across the entire mass range. This validates the use of temperature-derived masses, particularly in cosmological studies, significantly broadening the mass range and enabling applications such as improving the cluster mass function studies and cosmological parameter estimates.

 - **Abstract**
 The discovery of inhabited exoplanets hinges on identifying biosignature gases. JWST is revealing potential biosignatures in exoplanet atmospheres, though their presence is yet to provide strong evidence for life. The central challenge is attribution: how to confidently identify biogenic sources while ruling out, or deeming unlikely, abiotic explanations? Attribution is particularly difficult for individual planets, especially regarding system-scale stochastic processes that could set atmospheric conditions. To address this, we here propose a comparative multi-planet approach: comparing atmospheric compositions across multiple planets within a system to empirically define the 'abiotic baseline'. This baseline serves as a reference point for biosignatures, and enables marginalisation over inaccessible, shared abiotic parameters. This is possible because planets within a system are linked by their birth in the same natal disk, having been irradiated by the same evolving star, and having a related dynamical history. Observations aligning with the abiotic baseline, where the locally informed abiotic models demonstrate high out-of-sample predictive accuracy, are likely non-biological. Deviations from the baseline -- potentially biotic anomalies -- suggest an alternative origin. We present the application of Bayesian leave-one-out cross-validation to evaluate the performance of geochemical- and biogeochemical-climate models in explaining these anomalies, using the expected log pointwise predictive density as a diagnostic. When biogeochemical models outperform their abiotic counterparts, the anomaly may be shaped by life, and constitutes a comparative biosignature. If both models perform poorly, the anomaly is flagged as an "unknown unknown" -- a signature of either unrecognised abiotic chemistry, or life as we don't yet know it.
#### Dark skies of the slightly eccentric WASP-18 b from its optical-to-infrared dayside emission

 - **Abstract**
 We analyse jointly phase-curve observations of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-18 b from the visible to the mid-infrared, using unpublished data from CHEOPS, TESS and Spitzer. We aim to characterise the planetary atmosphere with a consistent view over the large wavelength range covered using GCMs and retrieval analyses, and including JWST data. We obtain new ephemerides with unprecedented precisions of 1 second and 1.4 millisecond on the time of inferior conjunction and orbital period, respectively. We compute a planetary radius of $R_p = 1.1926 \pm 0.0077 R_J$ with a precision of 0.65%, or 550 km. Through a timing inconsistency with JWST, we discuss and confirm orbital eccentricity ($e = 0.00852 \pm 0.00091$), and constrain the argument of periastron to $\omega = 261.9^{+1.3}_{-1.4}$ deg. We show that the large dayside emission implies the presence of magnetic drag and super-solar metallicity. We find a steep thermally-inverted gradient in the planetary atmosphere, which is common for UHJs. We detect the presence of strong CO emission lines at 4.5 $\mu$m from an excess of dayside brightness in the Spitzer/IRAC/Ch2 passband. Using these models to constrain the reflected contribution in the CHEOPS passband, we derive an extremely low geometric albedo $A_g^\text{CHEOPS} = 0.027 \pm 0.011$.

 - **Abstract**
 The transfer of a star's angular momentum to its atmosphere is a topic of considerable and wide-ranging interest in astrophysics. This letter considers the effect of kinetic and magnetic turbulence on the solar wind's angular momentum. The effects are quantified in a theoretical framework that employs Reynolds-averaged mean field magnetohydrodynamics, allowing for fluctuations of arbitrary amplitude. The model is restricted to the solar equatorial (\(r-\phi\)) plane with axial symmetry, which permits the effect of turbulence to be expressed in analytical form as a modification to the classic Weber & Davis (1967) theory, dependent on the \(r,\phi\) shear component of the Reynolds stress tensor. A solar wind simulation with turbulence transport modeling and Parker Solar Probe observations at the Alfvén surface are employed to quantify this turbulent modification to the solar wind's angular momentum, which is found to be ~ 3% - 10% and tends to be negative. Implications for solar and stellar rotational evolution are discussed.
#### From Tides to Currents: Unraveling the Mechanism That Powers WASP-107b's Internal Heat Flux

 - **Abstract**
 The sub-Jovian exoplanet WASP-107b ranks among the best-characterized low-density worlds, featuring a Jupiter-like radius and a mass that lies firmly in the sub-Saturn range. Recently obtained JWST spectra reveal significant methane depletion in the atmosphere, indicating that WASP-107b's envelope has both a high metallicity and an elevated internal heat flux. Together with a detected non-zero orbital eccentricity, these data have been interpreted as evidence of tidal heating. However, explaining the observed luminosity with tidal dissipation requires an unusually low tidal quality factor of $Q \sim 100$. Moreover, we find that secular excitation by the RV-detected outer companion WASP-107c, generally cannot sustain WASP-107b's eccentricity in steady state against tidal circularization. As an alternative explanation, we propose that Ohmic dissipation -- generated by interactions between zonal flows and the planetary magnetic field in a partially ionized atmosphere -- maintains the observed thermal state. Under nominal assumptions for the field strength, atmospheric circulation, and ionization chemistry, we show that Ohmic heating readily accounts for WASP-107b's inflated radius and anomalously large internal entropy.

 - **Abstract**
 This study presents the results of ALMA band 6 archival data of G328.24$-$0.55, with the aim to pin down the physical and kinematic properties of young stellar objects (YSOs) in G328.24$-$0.55 star forming region. The dust continuum image reveals 5 protostellar objects (MM1a, MM1b, MM1c, MM2 and MM3), with MM1a dominating the region. The dust continuum peaks do not coincide with the strongest radio continuum peak previously detected in the region in a MeerKAT observation, but coincide with the weaker MeerKAT peak. The dust continuum objects are associated with faint unresolved infrared emission. We detected 70, 49, 26, 7 and 8 molecular transitions toward MM1a, MM1b, MM1c, MM2 and MM3, respectively. This variation in the number of detected molecular transitions supports different excitation conditions in these objects. The excitation temperatures estimated toward MM1a, MM1b and MM1c are $\sim$ 183, 168 and 110\,K, respectively. MM2 and MM3 lack multiple transitions of molecular lines to determine their excitation temperatures. The masses of MM1a, MM1b, MM1c, MM2 and MM3 were calculated to be 23.2, 16.1, 12.0, 9.8 and 14.9$M_{\odot}$, respectively. The velocity gradient of CH$_{3}$OH ($10_{2,8}-9_{3,7}$) emission traces a rotating structure, probably an envelope of gas around MM1a. Bipolar outflow traced by CO emission is seen towards MM1a. The properties of MM1a clearly point to the existence of a massive protostellar object that is still undergoing accretion and outflow in its early formative stage.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutron star (NS) mergers, including both binary NS mergers and black hole - NS mergers, are multi-messenger sources detectable in both gravitational waves (GWs) and electromagnetic (EM) radiation. The expected EM emission signatures depend on the source's progenitor, merger remnant, and observer's line of sight (LoS). Widely discussed EM counterparts of NS mergers have been focused in the gamma-ray (in terms of short-duration gamma-ray bursts) and optical (in terms of kilonova) bands. In this paper, we show that X-ray emission carries unique post-merger signatures that are inaccessible in other EM bands and plays an important role in understanding the physics and geometry of these mergers. We consider several binary progenitor and central engine models and investigate X-ray emission signatures from the prompt phase immediately after the merger to the afterglow phase extending years later. For the prompt phase, we devise a general method for computing phenomenological X-ray light curves and spectra for structured jets viewed from any LoS, which can be applied to X-ray observations of NS mergers to constrain the geometry. The geometric constraints can in turn be used to model the afterglow and estimate a peak time and flux -- to preemptively determine afterglow characteristics would be monumental for follow-up observation campaigns of future GW sources. Finally, we provide constraints on the time window for X-ray counterpart searches of NS mergers across a range of luminosity distances and detector sensitivities.

 - **Abstract**
 We use the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation TNG50 to study the galaxy mass-morphology relation, as measured by the rotational support of the stellar component of simulated galaxies. For isolated galaxies with stellar mass in the range $8<\log(M_{*}/M_{\odot}) < 11$, rotational support increases with $M_*$, from dispersion-supported spheroidal dwarfs to massive galaxies with prominent rotationally supported discs. Our results indicate that this correlation arises from the spatial distribution of star formation in TNG50 galaxies, which occurs primarily in two distinct regions: an unresolved, non-rotating central baryonic clump $(r \lesssim 1~\mathrm{kpc})$ and a rotationally supported outer disc, separated by a quiescent region. The importance of the inner clump increases with decreasing $M_*$; it makes up more than 80\% of all stars in dwarfs. This explains why dwarfs have less rotational support than massive galaxies, as well as why all dwarfs have similar stellar half-mass radii regardless of $M_*$. It also explains why dwarfs in TNG50 appear to form outside-in, as star formation in the dominant inner clump moves progressively inward. The clump-disc segregation of star formation in TNG50 galaxies is probably numerical in origin. Inner clumps are formed by the accumulation of low-angular momentum gas supported by the equation of state introduced to prevent artificial fragmentation. The decoupled-wind feedback implementation in TNG50 helps to preserve the clumps but disrupts disc formation in its immediate surroundings. This hinders the formation of discs in (dwarf) galaxies whose sizes are not substantially larger than the clump, but has little effect on the larger discs of more massive systems. Our results argue for caution when interpreting the dependence on stellar mass of TNG50 galaxy morphologies, or the evolution of galaxy sizes, especially at the dwarf end.

 - **Abstract**
 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) are among the most luminous objects in the universe, making them valuable probes for studying galaxy evolution. However, understanding how AGN properties evolve over cosmic time remains a fundamental challenge. This study investigates whether AGNs at low redshift (nearby) can serve as proxies for their high-redshift (distant) counterparts by identifying spectral 'doppelgängers', AGNs with remarkably similar emission line properties despite being separated by vast cosmic distances. We analyze key spectral features of bona fide AGNs using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey's Data Release 16, including continuum and emission lines: Nitrogen (N V), Carbon (C IV), Magnesium (Mg II), Hydrogen-beta (H$\beta$), and Iron (Fe II - optical and UV) emission lines. We incorporated properties such as equivalent width, velocity dispersion in the form of full width at half maximum (FWHM), and continuum luminosities (135nm, 300nm, and 510nm) closest to these prominent lines. Our initial findings suggest the existence of multiple AGNs with highly similar spectra, hinting at the possibility that local AGNs may indeed share intrinsic properties with high-redshift ones. We showcase here one of the better candidate pairs of AGNs resulting from our analyses.
#### Gamma-Ray Millisecond Pulsars: Off-pulse Emission Characteristics, Phase-Resolved Pseudo-Luminosity--Cutoff Energy Correlation, and High-energy Pulsed Emission

 - **Abstract**
 Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are prominent GeV $\gamma$-ray emitters, but their emission mechanisms, especially during off-pulse phases and at high energies, remain debated. We analyze 38 MSPs using approximately 15 years of $Fermi$-LAT data. Employing high-precision ephemerides and Bayesian Blocks algorithm, we detect significant off-pulse emission from 15 MSPs. Spectral analysis reveals significant cutoffs in 10 of these, favoring a magnetospheric origin. The remaining 5 likely also have magnetospheric emission with cutoffs below current sensitivity. Phase-resolved spectral analysis for the 15 MSPs with off-pulse flux shows a significant correlation between cutoff energy ($E_{\text{cut}}$) and average photon counts in 11 sources. We introduce a phase-resolved pseudo-luminosity ($L$) and discover a novel, statistically significant linear correlation between $\log_{10}(L)$ and $\log_{10}(E_{\text{cut}})$ across their phase bins, with the best-fit slope $\alpha = 2.31^{+0.22}_{-0.25}$. Furthermore, we detect significant pulsed emission above 10 GeV from 9 MSPs with off-pulse emission and 7 others (totaling 16 MSPs and tripling previous cataloged detections). Emission above 25 GeV is confirmed for PSR J0614$-$3329 and newly detected for PSR J1536$-$4948, both of which also exhibit significant off-pulse emission. Their highest-energy photons ($\sim$61 GeV and $\sim$57 GeV, respectively) coincide with pulse peaks. The co-existence of significant off-pulse emission and high-energy pulsed emission challenges standard Outer Gap models, while the observed $\log_{10}(L)$-$\log_{10}(E_{\text{cut}})$ correlation may provide new evidence supporting the equatorial current sheet scenario.

 - **Abstract**
 NGC2261 is a reflection nebula illuminated by the young star R Monocerotis. Objects moving near the star occasionally cast shadows on the nebula, giving rise to its alternative name: Hubble's Variable Nebula. For 7 years since Spring 2017 robotic telescopes have been used to compile a roughly twice-weekly record of changes in the object. The results, over 1000 images at separate epochs, have been compiled into a movie. This shows that, as well as the large scale but infrequent variability for which it is famous, the nebula is continually traversed by low level `ripples' of light and dark. These record changes in the light output from R Mon and analysis of their progress indicates that the reflecting material takes the form of a thin (<3x10^16cm) screen whose shape resembles a half paraboloid, rooted at the star and bowed towards us. The brightness of the screen in Herschel far-IR maps indicates a density n_H> 1.7x10^5cm^-3 and CO observations show the material is moving towards us at a few km/s relative to the rest cloud, consistent it with being a dense shell of material displaced by R~Mon's outflow. The results demonstrate the value of studying such objects in the time domain, and are a glimpse of what will be achieved by instruments like the Zwicky Transient Facility and Vera Rubin Observatory.

 - **Abstract**
 This study involves the use of integral field spectroscopy (IFS) data from Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) to investigate whether the morphology influences the environmental dependence of galaxies' colours and the colour-magnitude planes. The galaxies are classified into six morphologies (Elliptical, Lenticular, Early-type, Intermediate-type, Late-type spirals and Irregular) and further in field and group environments. The distributions of colours ($B-V, B-R, u-g, g-r, r-i$ and $i-z$) are compared between field and group environments and then the colour-magnitude planes are analysed. It is observed that Intermediate and Late-types spirals preferentially exist in field environments while Early-type spirals exist in groups. The colours and colour-magnitude planes of Elliptical, Lenticular, Early-type and Intermediate-type spirals depend on the environment while for the Late-type and Irregular galaxies, their dependence on the environment is very weak. The study concludes that the dependence of colours and colour-magnitude planes on the environment is influenced by morphology.

 - **Abstract**
 Blazars, supermassive black hole systems (SMBHs) with highly relativistic jets aligned with the line of sight, are the most powerful long-lived emitters of electromagnetic emission in the Universe. We report here on a radio to gamma-ray multiwavelength campaign on the blazar BL Lacertae with unprecedented polarimetric coverage from radio to X-ray wavelengths. The observations caught an extraordinary event on 2023 November 10-18, when the degree of linear polarization of optical synchrotron radiation reached a record value of 47.5%. In stark contrast, the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) found that the X-ray (Compton scattering or hadron-induced) emission was polarized at less than 7.4% (3sigma confidence level). We argue here that this observational result rules out a hadronic origin of the high energy emission, and strongly favors a leptonic (Compton scattering) origin, thereby breaking the degeneracy between hadronic and leptonic emission models for BL Lacertae and demonstrating the power of multiwavelength polarimetry to address this question. Furthermore, the multiwavelength flux and polarization variability, featuring an extremely prominent rise and decay of the optical polarization degree, is interpreted for the first time by the relaxation of a magnetic "spring" embedded in the newly injected plasma. This suggests that the plasma jet can maintain a predominant toroidal magnetic field component parsecs away from the central engine.

 - **Abstract**
 NGC 6528 and NGC 6553 are among the most metal-rich globular clusters in the Galactic bulge. They represent the upper end of the chemical enrichment in the Galaxy, and can inform on the processes of cluster formation and enrichment. We aim to refine the fundamental parameters of NGC 6528 and NGC 6553, based on proper motion-corrected Hubble Space Telescope WFC3 and ACS photometries. Methods. In order to derive the fundamental parameters age, distance, reddening, and the total-to-selective absorption coefficient, we employed a Bayesian isochrone fitting. Age and metallicity are mainly constrained by the turn-off morphology, thanks to the unprecedented quality of the proper-motion cleaned photometry. The two clusters show remarkably similar Colour-Magnitude Diagrams. We derived an age of 11+-0.5 Gyr with a solar metallicity for both clusters. The reddening for NGC 6528 and NGC 6553 is E(B-V) = 0.63 and 0.76 and the distances from the Sun are d = 7.85 and 5.1 kpc, respectively, recalling that distances strictly depend on the adopted total-to-selective absorption parameter. The age of these metal-rich clusters is about 2 Gyr younger than the moderately metal-poor bulge clusters. The ages and metallicities are remarkably identical to that of the bulk of bulge field stars.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first results from long-term high-cadence spectroscopic monitoring of 15 PG quasars with relatively strong Fe II emission as a part of a broader reverberation mapping campaign performed with the Calar Alto Observatory 2.2m telescope. The $V$-band, 5100 Å continuum, and H$\beta$ broad emission line light curves were measured for a set of quasars for between dozens to more than a hundred epochs from May 2017 to July 2020. Accurate time lags between the variations of the H$\beta$ broad line fluxes and the optical continuum strength are obtained for all 15 quasars, ranging from $17.0_{-3.2}^{+2.5}$ to $95.9_{-23.9}^{+7.1}$ days in the rest frame. The virial masses of the central supermassive black holes are derived for all 15 quasars, ranging between $0.50_{-0.19}^{+0.18}$ and $19.17_{-2.73}^{+2.98}$ in units of $10^7 M_\odot$. For 11 of the objects in our sample, this is the first reverberation analysis published. Of the rest, two objects have been the subject of previous reverberation studies, but we determine time lags for these that are only half as long as found in the earlier investigations, which had only been able to sample much more sparsely. The remaining two objects have previously been monitored with high sampling rates. Our results here are consistent with the earlier findings in the sense that the time lag and the line width vary inversely consistent with virialization.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the results of a long-duration high-cadence reverberation mapping campaign of a second batch of 11 PG quasars using the 2.2m telescope at the Calar Alto Observatory. This follows a similar earlier study of another sample of 15 objects reported by Hu et al. (2021). Among the 11 PG quasars, 8 objects have the H$\beta$ time lags measured for the first time, while the other 3 objects were observed in previous campaigns, but only had highly uncertain H$\beta$-lag measurements. Long-term light curves are presented of photometric $V$-band, spectroscopic 5100 Å continuum, and the H$\beta$ emission line, lasting for $\sim$3--6 years with a cadence of $\sim$6--14 days. Accurate H$\beta$ time lags ranging from $\sim$20 to 150 days in the rest frame are obtained. The estimated virial masses of the central supermassive black holes range from $\sim$(3--300)$\times10^7 M_\odot$. Combining these results with those reported in Hu et al. (2021), we now have 26 PG quasars, with representative properties, having reliable H$\beta$ time-lag measurements from our long-duration high-cadence campaign. A tentative fit to the relation between the H$\beta$ time lag and the continuum luminosity for these 26 objects gives a slope of 0.53.

 - **Abstract**
 X-ray transients (XTs) driven by newborn magnetars from mergers of neutron star binaries (NSBs) were occasionally detected in the narrow-field {\it Chandra} Deep Field-South survey (CDF-S) and the {\it Swift}/XRT observations of short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs). Quantifying their event rate density (ERD) and luminosity function (LF) is critical for understanding NSB coalescence and magnetar formation. Utilizing population synthesis calculations incorporating various equations of state (EoS), we derive a local ERD of $\sim 300\,{\rm Gpc^{-3}\,yr^{-1}}$ and a redshift-dependent ERD profile peaking at $z=1.81$ followed by rapid decline beyond $z \sim 4$. Constructing an XT sample based on CDF-S and {\it Swift} observations, we characterize the LF by a single power-law function at $L \leq 4.75 \times 10^{46}\;{\rm erg\;s^{-1}}$ with a slope of $-1.03$, following by a broken power-law function in which the break luminosity is $L_{\rm b} = 4.38 \times 10^{47}\;{\rm erg\;s^{-1}}$ and the slopes are $-0.28$ and $-1.66$. Based on the ERD and the LF, we estimate that the {\it Einstein Probe} ({\it EP}) detection rate is $\sim 31\;{\rm yr^{-1}}$, adopting a conservative threshold flux of $10^{-9}\;{\rm erg}\;{\rm s^{-1}}$, an luminosity range of $L \in [2\times 10^{44},2\times 10^{49}]\;{\rm erg\;s^{-1}}$, and a correction for jet opening angle of $\sim 16^{\circ}$. This detection rate is consistent with the {\it EP} observations during its first-year operation. It is important to note that our estimation is subject to uncertainties arising from the LF derivation. Future {\it EP} observations of these XT events will be crucial in reducing these uncertainties.

 - **Abstract**
 We generalize the magnetically enhanced radiative torque (MRAT) alignment theory for general astrophysical environments described by a dimensionless parameter $U/(n_{1}T_{2})$ with $U$ local radiation strength, $n_{1}=n_{\rm H}/(10{\rm cm}^{-3})$ the hydrogen density, and $T_{2}=T_{\rm gas}/100{\rm K}$ the gas temperature. We first derive the critical magnetic relaxation $\delta_{\rm mag,cri}$ required to produce high-J attractors for different RAT models and local conditions and find that $\delta_{\rm mag,cri}$ must be larger for stronger radiation fields. We then numerically study the grain alignment and rotational disruption by the MRAT mechanism taking into account gas collisions and magnetic fluctuations. We find that, for the collision-dominated (CD) regime ($U/(n_{1}T_{2})\leq 1$), collisional and magnetic excitations can slowly transport large grains from low-J rotation to high-J attractors, leading to the perfect {\it slow alignment} within $\sim 10-100$ damping times due to MRATs. However, for the radiation-dominated (RD) regime ($U/(n_{1}T_{2})>1$), only a fraction of grains can be fast aligned at high-J attractors by MRATs, and the majority of grains are trapped at low-J rotation due to strong radiative torques, a new effect we term {\it radiative torque (RAT) trapping}. For extreme radiation fields of $U/(n_{1}T_{2})>10^{4}$, the efficiency of magnetic relaxation on grain alignment is suppressed, and grains only have fast alignment and disruption purely determined by RATs. We quantified the fraction of grains with fast alignment at high-J attractors, $f_{\rm high-J}^{\rm fast}$, for different RAT models, magnetic relaxation, and $U/(n_{1}T_{2})$, and found that the maximum $f_{\rm high-J}^{\rm fast}$ can reach $45\%$ by MRATs and $22\%$ by RATs.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the degeneracy between the effects of ultra-light axion dark matter and baryonic feedback in suppressing the matter power spectrum. We forecast that galaxy shear data from the Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) could limit an axion of mass $m = 10^{-25}\,\mathrm{eV}$ to be $\lesssim 5\%$ of the dark matter, stronger than any current bound, if the interplay between axions and feedback is accurately modelled. Using a halo model emulator to construct power spectra for mixed cold and axion dark matter cosmologies, including baryonic effects, we find that galaxy shear is sensitive to axions from $10^{-27}\,\mathrm{eV}$ to $10^{-21}\,\mathrm{eV}$, with the capacity to set competitive bounds across much of this range. For axions with $m \sim 10^{-25}\,\mathrm{eV}$, the scales at which axions and feedback impact structure formation are similar, introducing a parameter degeneracy. We find that, with an external feedback constraint, we can break the degeneracy and constrain the axion transfer function, such that LSST could detect a $10^{-25}\,\mathrm{eV}$ axion comprising 10\% of the dark matter at $\sim 3 \sigma$ significance. Direct reconstruction of the non-linear matter power spectrum provides an alternative way of analysing weak lensing surveys, with the advantage of identifying the scale-dependent features in the data that the dark matter model imposes. We advocate for dedicated cosmological hydrodynamical simulations with an axion dark matter component so that upcoming galaxy and cosmic microwave background lensing surveys can disentangle the dark matter-baryon transfer function.

 - **Abstract**
 We utilized the Edelson and Malkan (2012) and Stern et al. (2012) selection techniques and other methods to identify AGN candidates that were monitored during the Kepler prime and K2 missions. Subsequent to those observations, we obtained 125 long-slit optical spectra with the Lick 3-m telescope, 58 spectra with the Palomar 5-m telescope, and three with the Keck 10-m telescope to test these identifications. Of these 186 AGN candidates, 105 were confirmed as Type 1 AGN and 35 as Type 2 AGN, while the remaining 46 were found to have other identifications (e.g., stars and normal galaxies). This indicated an overall reliability of about 75%, while the two main methods had much higher reliability, 87%-96%. The spectra indicated redshifts out to z = 3.4. Then, we examined the AGN sample properties through the Baldwin, Phillips & Terlevich diagram and compared the AGN's spectral energy distributions (SEDs) with those from the literature. We found that our sample yielded the same AGN population as those identified through other methods, such as optical spectroscopy.

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are luminous black hole (BH) transient sources, which are detected mainly in X-ray and optical bands. It is generally believed that the X-ray emission in TDEs is produced by an accretion disc formed as the stellar debris accreted onto the central BH. The origin of the optical emission is not determined, but could be explained by the `reprocessing' model with the X-ray emission reprocessed into optical band by a surrounding optically thick envelope or outflow. In this paper, we performed radiation hydrodynamic simulations of super-Eddington accretion flow with Athena++ code in the environment of TDEs, i.e., injecting a continuous mass flow rate at the circularization radius in the form of $\dot M_{\rm inject} \propto t^{-5/3}$ for the mass supply rate. We show that a significant fraction of the matter in the accretion inflow are blowed off forming outflow, and the properties of the outflow are viewing-angle dependent. We further calculate the emergent spectra of such an inflow/outflow system for different viewing angles with the method of Monto Carlo radiative transfer. Based on the emergent spectra, we show that the observed features of TDEs, such as the X-ray and optical luminosities, the blackbody temperature of X-ray and optical emission and the corresponding emission radii, the ratio of X-ray luminosity to optical luminosity, as well as the evolution of these quantities can be explained in the framework of viewing-angle effect of super-Eddington accretion around a BH.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the impact of early-time initial conditions on nonlinear structure formation and evolution within the framework of the semi-analytical Excursion Set Theory (EST). Our analysis reveals that adding a Gaussian bump to the initial curvature power spectrum at small scales enhances the abundance of massive halos while sharply reducing the number of small-mass halos, and consequently, satellite galaxies. Moreover, this modification increases the frequency of major mergers while suppressing high-mass-ratio minor mergers. These features may offer resolutions to the missing satellite and Too Big to Fail (TBTF) problems. In underdense regions -- voids -- the same modifications increase the likelihood of finding massive halos embedded in voids while similarly decreasing the small-halo population, and consequently, faint galaxies. This behavior suggests a potential solution to the void phenomenon, in which embedded halos, despite being too massive, were too rare to be noticed. More precisely, our results indicate that an excess of massive structures emerges at mass scales near the center of the Gaussian bump: $k_* = 1.85 \,\rm{h/Mpc}$ and $k_* = 3.95 \,\rm{h/Mpc}$. These scales correspond to mass scales of $M_* = 10^{11}$ and $M_* = 10^{10}$, respectively. This modification extends up to two orders of magnitude in higher mass scales, while reducing the abundance of halos below $M_*$ by two to three orders of magnitude. Additionally, we find that evolutionary conditions, halo-in-halo, and particularly halo-in-void statistics serve as more sensitive and complementary probes for differentiating among cosmological models.

 - **Abstract**
 Supernova remnants (SNRs) are often considered as the main sites of acceleration of cosmic rays in our Galaxy, possibly up to the knee. However, their ability to accelerate particles to reach PeV energies is questionable and lacks observational evidence. Theoretical predictions suggest that only a small subclass of very young SNRs evolving in dense environments could potentially satisfy the necessary conditions to accelerate particles to PeV energies. Most such theoretical investigations are carried out either in the standard interstellar medium or in the wind of the progenitor. Since most core collapse supernovae occur in star clusters, it is important to extend such investigation to SNRs taking place in a star cluster. In this work we focus on a SNR shock propagating in the collective wind of a compact star cluster, and we study the acceleration process as a function time, with special emphasis on the maximum energy of accelerated particles. Using both analytic and numerical approaches we investigate the spectrum of accelerated particles and maximum achievable energy in the case of pre-existing turbulence in the collective wind and self-generated magnetic perturbations. We find that similar to isolated SNRs, acceleration to PeV energies is plausible only for extreme conditions achievable only in a small subset of SNRs.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations have shown the presence of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHi) in solar prominences. Effects due to partial ionization of the prominence plasma may influence the KHi onset. We study the triggering of the KHi in an interface model that consists of a partially ionized prominence region and a fully ionized coronal region, with a uniform magnetic field parallel to the interface. There is a longitudinal flow in the prominence region. The plasma is compressible and the role of ambipolar diffusion, which accounts for collisions between charges and neutrals, is taken into account in the prominence plasma. We derive the dispersion relation of linear perturbations on the interface and analyze some limit cases analytically. Numerical results are obtained for realistic prominence parameters. We find that compressibility and gas pressure are important in determining the unstable flow velocities, specially in the range of sub-Alfvénic flows that are consistent with the observations. The ambipolar diffusion has a generally destabilizing influence and reduces the threshold flow velocity for the KHi onset.

 - **Abstract**
 Supernova observations imply the presence of a dense and asymmetric circumstellar environment around SN Type II progenitors, whereas the mass loss from these progenitors, namely, red supergiants, is still poorly constrained. We aim to characterise the dust and gas in the circumstellar environment of the extreme Galactic red supergiant \nmlcyg in terms of mass, morphology, and kinematics. Based on interferometric observations with NOEMA at 230 GHz we estimated dust masses and temperatures, and measured the extent and morphological complexity of the circumstellar environment. We detected two strong continuum components, amounting to an estimated total dust mass of $\sim2\times10^{-3}M_{\odot}$ located out to ~2000 AU from the star, largely beyond the dust detected at optical/infrared wavelengths. The extent of the detected CO emission supports the notion that the outflow is formed by a mass-loss rate of several $10^{-4}\,M_{\odot}$/year and that it is not primarily shaped by extreme irradiation from the Cyg OB2 cluster it has been associated with. We have detected, but not resolved, previously unseen high-velocity components close to the star. The observations reveal a very complex circumstellar morphology and we propose that some of the detected components could be the imprint of a hitherto unknown binary companion.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the effect of the environment on the infrared and radio emission of cluster galaxies during the transition epoch at 1 < z < 2 when they first start to quench consistently in the majority of galaxy clusters. We considered a sample of 129 cluster member galaxies from 11 massive clusters at a confirmed redshift of 1.0-1.8 from the IRAC Shallow Cluster Survey (ISCS), the IRAC Distant Cluster Survey (IDCS), and new 3 GHz images from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA). We calculated the IR-radio correlation slope parameter, q, in order to identify differences in the ratios of IR to radio of cluster galaxies and field galaxy comparison samples at different redshifts. Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) were identified and analyzed to search for any effect on the IR-radio correlation. The correlation parameter values were also compared by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test with field galaxies. Our comparison of the IR-radio correlation in cluster galaxies to the control sample of field galaxies reveals a marginally to modestly significant difference in the correlation slope parameter at the ~2sigma-3sigma level. A split of the clusters into low-redshift (1 < z < 1.37) and high-redshift (1.37 < z < 1.8) bins indicates a more significant difference in the correlation parameter in the lower redshift cluster subsample, where widespread quenching begins. We find no difference in the IR-radio correlation between galaxies that host AGNs and non-active star-forming galaxies either. This suggests that our AGNs are overwhelmingly radio quiet and therefore do not affect the results we described above. We conclude that further investigations based on larger datasets are needed to constrain the impact of the cluster environment on the IR-radio correlation better.

 - **Abstract**
 Forced magnetic reconnection is triggered by external perturbations, which are ubiquitous in the solar corona. This process plays a crucial role in the energy release during solar transient events, which are often associated with electric current sheets (CSs). The CSs can often disintegrate through the development of the tearing instability, which may lead to the formation of plasmoids in the non-linear phase of evolution. However, the complexity of the dynamics, and the magnetic and thermodynamic evolution due to the coalescence of the plasmoids are not fully understood. We used a resistive magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a 2.5D current layer embedded in a stratified medium in the solar corona, incorporating field-aligned thermal conduction. Multiple levels of adaptive mesh-refined grids are used to resolve the fine structures that result during the evolution of the system. The instability in the CS is triggered by imposing impulsive velocity perturbations concentrated at three different locations in the upper half along the CS plane; this leads to the formation of plasmoids and their later coalescence. We demonstrate that a transition from purely 2D reconnection to 2D reconnection with guide field takes place at the interface between the plasmoids as the latter evolve from the pre-merger to the merged state. The small-scale, short-lived, and collimated outflows during the merging process share various physical properties with the recently discovered nanojets. The subsequent thermodynamic change within and outside the merged plasmoid region is governed by the combined effect of Ohmic heating, thermal conduction, and expansion/contraction of the plasma. Our results imply that impulsive perturbations in coronal CSs can be the triggering agents for plasmoid coalescence, which leads to the subsequent magnetic, and thermodynamic change in and around the CS.

 - **Abstract**
 To investigate the impact of winds and low-to-moderate power jets on the cold molecular gas reservoirs of AGN, we present high angular resolution ALMA CO(2-1) and CO(3-2) observations of a sample of six type-2 quasars (QSO2s) at z$\sim$0.1 from the Quasar Feedback (QSOFEED) sample. Spatially resolved molecular line ratio maps, defined as $R_{32}=L'_{CO(3-2)}/L'_{CO(2-1)}$, and kinematic modelling were used to constrain changes in gas excitation and to identify gas outflows, respectively. We find that the molecular outflows are co-spatial with regions with $R_{32}$>1, indicating enhanced temperature relative to the discs and the presence of optically thin gas in the outflows. We find mass outflow rates of 5$<\dot{M}_{out}<$150$M_\odot$/yr, much lower than those expected from their AGN luminosities of $10^{45.5-46}$erg/s. The outflow kinetic energies might be driven by the combined action of jets and winds/radiation pressure, with radiative coupling efficiencies ($\epsilon_{AGN}=\dot{E}_{out}/L_{bol}$) ranging from $10^{-6}<\epsilon_{AGN}<10^{-4}$ and jet coupling efficiencies ($\epsilon_{jet}=\dot{E}_{out}/P_{jet}$) from $10^{-3}<\epsilon_{AGN}<10^{-2}$. A linear regression including the six QSO2s follows the locus of $\epsilon_{jet}\sim$0.1\%. Our results provide evidence that AGN-driven jets/winds disturb the molecular gas kinematics and excitation within the central kpc of the galaxies. The coupling between compact jets and the ISM might be relevant to AGN feedback, even in the case of radio-quiet galaxies, which are more representative of the AGN population. Finally, we find that the warm and cold molecular gas phases seem to be tracing the same outflow, with the main distinction between them being the mass they carry, while the warm ionized outflows do not seem to be another face of the same outflow, as they show different orientation, velocity, and radius.

 OCARS (Optical Characteristics of Astrometric Radio Sources) is a compiled catalog of various additional data associated with astrometric radio sources whose coordinates have been determined from very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations. It contains source coordinates, object type, redshift, optical and near-infrared magnitudes. Until now, OCARS source coordinates were simply copied from input catalogs and, as a result, were systematically inhomogeneous. This work is the first attempt to obtain a unified set of radio source coordinates aligned to the International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF), more specically to the third ICRF release, ICRF3. Comparison of the source coordinates in the old OCARS version as of December 2024 and the new OCARS version as of March 2025 with the ICRF3-SX catalog using the vector spherical harmonics (VSH) technique showed almost complete elimination of systematic errors in new OCARS positions relative to the ICRF3 frame.

 - **Abstract**
 The neutron star zoo comprises several sub-populations that range from energetic magnetars and thermally emitting X-ray neutron stars to radio-emitting pulsars. Despite studies over the last five decades, it has been challenging to obtain a clear physical link between the various populations of neutron stars, vital to constrain their formation and evolutionary pathways. Here we report the detection of a burst of coherent radio emission from a known radio-quiet, thermally emitting neutron star 2XMM J104608.7$-$594306in the Carina Nebula. The burst has a distinctive sharp rise followed by a decay made up of multiple components, which is unlike anything seen from other radio-emitting neutron stars. It suggests an episodic event from the neutron star surface, akin to transient radio emission seen from magnetars. The radio burst confirms that the X-ray source is a neutron star and suggests a new link between these apparently radio-quiet X-ray emitting sources and other transient or persistent radio-emitting neutron stars. It also suggests that a common physical mechanism for emission might operate over a range of magnetic field strengths and neutron star ages. We propose that 2XMM J104608.7$-$594306 straddles the boundary between young, energetic neutron stars and their evolved radio-emitting cousins and may bridge these two populations. The detection of such a radio burst also shows that other radio-quiet neutron stars may also emit such sporadic radio emission that has been missed by previous radio surveys and highlights the need for regular monitoring of this unique sub-population of neutron stars.
