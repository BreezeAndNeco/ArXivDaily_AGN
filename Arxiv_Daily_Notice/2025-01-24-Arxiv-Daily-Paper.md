 - **Abstract**
 From $>1000$ orbits of HST imaging, we present deep homogeneous resolved star color-magnitude diagrams that reach the oldest main sequence turnoff and uniformly measured star formation histories (SFHs) of 36 dwarf galaxies ($-6 \ge M_V \ge -17$) associated with the M31 halo, and for 10 additional fields in M31, M33, and the Giant Stellar Stream. From our SFHs we find: i) the median stellar age and quenching epoch of M31 satellites correlate with galaxy luminosity and galactocentric distance. Satellite luminosity and present-day distance from M31 predict the satellite quenching epoch to within $1.8$ Gyr at all epochs. This tight relationship highlights the fundamental connection between satellite halo mass, environmental history, and star formation duration. ii) There is no difference between the median SFH of galaxies on and off the great plane of Andromeda satellites. iii) $\sim50$\% of our M31 satellites show prominent ancient star formation ($>12$ Gyr ago) followed by delayed quenching ($8-10$ Gyr ago), which is not commonly observed among the MW satellites. iv) A comparison with TNG50 and FIRE-2 simulated satellite dwarfs around M31-like hosts show that some of these trends (dependence of SFH on satellite luminosity) are reproduced in the simulations while others (dependence of SFH on galactocentric distance, presence of the delayed-quenching population) are weaker or absent. We provide all photometric catalogs and SFHs as High-Level Science Products on MAST.

 - **Abstract**
 We perform numerical relativity simulations of black hole-neutron star (BH-NS) mergers with a fixed mass ratio of $q = 3$, varying the BH spin to produce a wide range of post-merger accretion disk masses. Our high-order numerical scheme, fine resolution, and Large Eddy Simulation techniques enable us to achieve likely the most resolved BH-NS merger simulations to date, capturing the post-merger magnetic field amplification driven by turbulent dynamo processes. Following tidal disruption and during disk formation, the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in the spiral arm drives a turbulent state in which the magnetic field, initialized to a realistic average value of $10^{11}\, \rm{G}$, grows to an average of approximately $10^{14}\, \rm{G}$ in the first $\approx 20\, \mathrm{ms}$ post-merger. Notably, the dimensionless magnetic flux on the BH, $ \phi $, evolves similarly across nearly two orders of magnitude in disk mass. This similarity, along with estimates from longer numerical simulations of the decay of the mass accretion rate, suggests a universal timescale at which the dimensionless flux saturates at a magnetically arrested state (MAD) such that $ \phi \approx 50 $ at $t_{\rm MAD} \gtrsim 10\,{\rm s}$. The unified framework of Gottlieb et al. (2023) established that the MAD timescale sets the duration of the resulting compact binary gamma-ray burst (cbGRB), implying that all BH-NS mergers contribute to the recently detected new class of long-duration cbGRBs.

 - **Abstract**
 Field dwarf galaxies not actively forming stars are relatively rare in the local Universe, but are present in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. We use the TNG50 simulation to investigate their origin and find that they all result from environmental effects that have removed or reduced their gas content. Quenched field dwarfs consist of either backsplash objects ejected from a massive host or of systems that have lost their gas after crossing overdense regions such as filaments or sheets (``cosmic web stripping''). Quenched fractions rise steeply with decreasing stellar mass, with quenched systems making up roughly $\sim 15\%$ of all field dwarfs (i.e., excluding satellites) with stellar masses $10^{7}<M_{\star}/M_{\odot}<10^{9}$. This fraction drops to only $\sim1\%$ when a strict isolation criterion that requires no neighbours with $M_{\star}>10^9\, M_{\odot}$ within {$1.5$} Mpc is applied. Of these isolated dwarfs, $\sim 6\%$ are backsplash, while the other $\sim 94\%$ have been affected by the cosmic web. Backsplash systems are more deficient in dark matter, have retained less or no gas, and have stopped forming stars earlier than cosmic web-stripped systems. The discovery of deeply isolated dwarf galaxies which were quenched relatively recently would lend observational support to the prediction that the cosmic web is capable of inducing the cessation of star formation in dwarfs.

 - **Abstract**
 Changing-look quasars exhibit dramatic variability in broad emission-line fluxes on short timescales. This behavior is challenging to many models of the quasar broad line region, due in large part to the short transition times between high and low states. In order to constrain the cause of the dramatic variability, we obtained contemporaneous Hubble Space Telescope UV and Hobby Eberly Telescope optical spectra of three changing-look quasars caught in their low state. We use these spectra, along with archival spectra taken during both the high and low states, to investigate potential scenarios for the change in state. Our data strongly disfavor a variable dust obscuration scenario for these three CLQs, and instead suggest that the observed transformation reflects a change in the intrinsic luminosity of the central engine. We also find that the low-state spectral energy distributions of all three quasars are reminiscent of those of low-luminosity active galactic nuclei, which suggests that the transition may result from a change in accretion flow structure caused by a reduced Eddington ratio.

 - **Abstract**
 Assembly bias is the variation of clustering induced by correlations between the assembly history of dark matter halos and the large-scale environment at fixed halo mass. In this work, we use the cosmological magneto-hydrodynamical simulation TNG300 to investigate how assembly bias affects the environment-dependent galaxy luminosity function. We measure the luminosity functions in bins of large-scale environment for the original simulated galaxy sample and for a shuffled sample, where the galaxies are randomly reassigned among halos of similar mass to remove assembly bias. By comparing them, we find distinct signatures, showing variations in the number of galaxies at the $\sim10\%$ level across all luminosities. Assembly bias increases the tendency of galaxies to reside in denser environments and further dilutes underdense regions, beyond the trends governed by halo mass. When separating by color, we see that assembly bias has a much bigger effect on red galaxies fainter than $\mathrm{M_r} - 5 \log{h} = -18.5$, which accounts for a $\sim20\%$ increase in the number of galaxies in the densest environment and a remarkable $50\%$ decrease in the least dense regions. The ratio of these measurements for the densest and least dense regions provides a robust assembly bias signal for the faint red galaxies, larger than a factor of two. Overall, our results provide a novel sensitive measure of assembly bias, offering valuable insight for modeling the effect and a potential new route to detect it in observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of pressure modes ($p$-modes) in stars have enabled profound insights into stellar properties, and theoretical stellar evolution and oscillation models are integral to these inferences. However, modeling uncertainties are often overlooked, even as they can rival or exceed observational uncertainties. In this study, we quantify, for the first time, the impact of structural resolution choices in 1D stellar evolution calculations on predicted $p$-mode frequencies across the HR diagram, using \texttt{MESA} and \texttt{GYRE}. We present measurements of resolution-based modeling uncertainty for a range of solar-like, upper main-sequence, and Mira oscillators and compare these directly to TESS observational uncertainties. We demonstrate that resolution-driven uncertainties can significantly influence theoretical predictions and in some cases overwhelm observational uncertainties by orders of magnitude: while solar-like oscillators typically have fractional, resolution-based uncertainties at or below 1\% of the test frequency, fractional uncertainties in Miras were as large as 20\%. We also find that the location and morphology of the RGB bump and red clump are impacted substantially by resolution uncertainty. Stellar ages are impacted at the 10\% level for young main-sequence stars, and the model-based correction factor for the $\Delta\nu$--$\sqrt{\rho}$ scaling relation is impacted at the 2\% level. Our results underscore the need to incorporate modeling uncertainties into asteroseismic analyses and provide a reference framework for observers evaluating the reliability of theoretical models.

 - **Abstract**
 Coronal holes (CH) are magnetically open regions that allow hot coronal plasma to escape from the Sun and form the high-speed solar wind. This wind can interact with Earth's magnetic field. For this reason, developing an accurate understanding of CH regions is vital for understanding space weather and its effects on Earth. The process of identifying CH regions typically relies on extreme ultraviolet (EUV) imagery, leveraging the fact that CHs appear dark at these wavelengths. Accurate identification of CHs in EUV, however, can be difficult due to a variety of factors, including stray light from nearby regions, limb brightening, and the presence of filaments (which also appear dark, but are not sources of solar wind). In order to overcome these issues, this work incorporates photospheric magnetic field data into a classical EUV-based segmentation algorithm based on the active contours without edges (ACWE) segmentation method. In this work magnetic field data are incorporated directly into the segmentation process, serving both as a method for removing non-CH regions in advance, and as a method to constrain evolution of the boundary which identifies the CH boundary. This reduces the presence of filaments while simultaneously allowing the segmentation to include CH regions that may be difficult to identify due to the aforementioned inconsistent intensities.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the origin of photometric variability in the classical T Tauri star TW Hya by comparing light curves obtained by TESS and ground-based telescopes with light curves created using three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. TW Hya is modeled as a rotating star with a dipole magnetic moment, slightly tilted about the rotational axis. We observed that for various model parameters, matter accretes in the unstable regime and produces multiple hot spots on the star's surface, which leads to stochastic-looking light curves similar to the observed ones. Wavelet and Fourier spectra of observed and modeled light curves show multiple quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) with quasiperiods from less than 0.1 to 9 days. Models show that variation in the strength and tilt of the dipole magnetosphere leads to different periodograms, where the period of the star may dominate or be hidden. The amplitude of QPOs associated with the stellar period can be smaller than that of other QPOs if the tilt of the dipole magnetosphere is small and when the unstable regime is stronger. In models with small magnetospheres, the short-period QPOs associated with rotation of the inner disc dominate and can be mistaken for a stellar period. We show that longer-period (5-9 days) QPOs can be caused by waves forming beyond the corotation radius.

 - **Abstract**
 We perform one-dimensional linear analysis and numerical simulations of the propagation of Alfven waves in a force-free magnetosphere along magnetic field lines around a spinning black hole. We use the results to investigate the dynamic process of wave propagation and energy transport for Alfven waves. As in a previous study using the Banados--Teitelboim--Zanelli spacetime (Koide et al. 2022), the Alfven wave induces a fast magnetosonic wave in the case of a spinning black hole. Energy conservation is confirmed when this additional induced magnetosonic wave is considered. We also observe the reflection of the inwardly propagating Alfven wave around the static limit, which is prohibited in theory when using the eikonal approximation.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a technique which predicts the energy dependent fractional r.m.s for linear correlated variations of a pair of spectral parameters and apply it to an XMM-Newton observation of Mrk 335. The broadband X-ray spectrum can be interpreted as a patchy absorber partially covering the primary emission, a warm and hot coronal emission or a relativistically blurred reflection along with the primary emission. The fractional r.m.s has a non-monotonic behavior with energy for segments of lengths 3 and 6 ksecs. For each spectral model, we consider every pair of spectral parameters and fit the predicted r.m.s with the observed ones, to get the pair which provides the best fit. We find that a variation in at least two parameters is required for all spectral interpretations. For both time segments, variations in the covering fraction of the absorber and the primary power law index gives the best result for the partial covering model, while a variation in the normalization and spectral index of the warm component gives the best fit in the two corona interpretation. For the reflection model, the best fit parameters are different for the two time segment lengths, and the results suggests that more than two parameters are required to explain the data. This, combined with the extreme values of emissivity index and reflection fraction parameters obtained from the spectral analysis, indicates that the blurred reflection model might not be a suitable explanation for the Mrk 335 spectrum. We discuss the results as well as the potential of the technique to be applied to other data sets of different AGN.
#### The bright long-lived Type II SN 2021irp powered by aspherical circumstellar material interaction (I): Revealing the energy source with photometry and spectroscopy

 - **Abstract**
 Some core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are too luminous and radiate too much total energy to be powered by the release of thermal energy from the ejecta and radioactive-decay energy from the synthesised $^{56}$Ni/$^{56}$Co. A source of additional power is the interaction between the supernova (SN) ejecta and a massive circumstellar material (CSM). This is an important power source in Type IIn SNe, which show narrow spectral lines arising from the unshocked CSM, but not all interacting SNe show such narrow lines. We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of the hydrogen-rich SN 2021irp, which is both luminous, with $M_{o} < -19.4$ mag, and long-lived, remaining brighter than $M_{o} = -18$ mag for $\sim$ 250 d. We show that an additional energy source is required to power such a SN, and determine the nature of the source. We also investigate the properties of the pre-existing and newly formed dust associated with the SN. Photometric observations show that the luminosity of the SN is an order of magnitude higher than typical Type II SNe and persists for much longer. We detect a infrared excess attributed to dust emission. Spectra show multi-component line profiles, an Fe II pseudo-continuum, and a lack of absorption lines, all typical features of Type IIn SNe. We detect a narrow (< 85 kms$^{-1}$) P-Cygni profile associated with the unshocked CSM. An asymmetry in emission line profiles indicates dust formation occurring from 250-300 d. Analysis of the SN blackbody radius evolution indicates asymmetry in the shape of the emitting region. We identify the main power source of SN 2021irp as extensive interaction with a massive CSM, and that this CSM is distributed asymmetrically around the progenitor star. The infrared excess is explained with emission from newly formed dust although there is also some evidence of an IR echo from pre-existing dust at early times.
#### Thermodynamics and collisionality in firehose-susceptible high-$\beta$ plasmas

 - **Abstract**
 We study the evolution of collisionless plasmas that, due to their macroscopic evolution, are susceptible to the firehose instability, using both analytic theory and hybrid-kinetic particle-in-cell simulations. We establish that, depending on the relative magnitude of the plasma $\beta$, the characteristic timescale of macroscopic evolution, and the ion-Larmor frequency, the saturation of the firehose instability in high-$\beta$ plasmas can result in three qualitatively distinct thermodynamic (and electromagnetic) states. By contrast with the previously identified `ultra-high-beta' and `Alfvén-inhibiting' states, the newly identified `Alfvén-enabling' state, which is realised when the macroscopic evolution time $\tau$ exceeds the ion-Larmor frequency by a $\beta$-dependent parameter, can support linear Alfvén waves and Alfvénic turbulence because the magnetic tension associated with the plasma's macroscopic magnetic field is never completely negated by anisotropic pressure forces. We characterise these states in detail, including their saturated magnetic-energy spectra. The effective collision operator associated with the firehose fluctuations is also described; we find it to be well approximated in the Alfvén-enabling state by a simple quasilinear pitch-angle scattering operator. The box-averaged collision frequency is $\nu_{\rm eff} \sim \beta/\tau$, in agreement with previous results, but certain sub-populations of particles scatter at a much larger (or smaller) rate depending on their velocity in the direction parallel to the magnetic field. Our findings are essential for understanding low-collisionality astrophysical plasmas including the solar wind, the intracluster medium of galaxy clusters and black-hole accretion flows. We show that all three of these plasmas are in the Alfvén-enabling regime of firehose saturation and discuss the implications of this result.
#### ATLASGAL-selected high-mass clumps in the inner Galaxy: XI. Morphology and kinematics of warm inner envelopes

 - **Abstract**
 (Abridged) Massive stellar embryos are embedded in warm envelopes that provide mass reservoirs for the accretion process onto final stars. Feedback from star formation activities in return impacts the properties of the envelopes, offering us a unique opportunity to investigate star formation processes. We aim to characterise the warm envelopes of proto- or young stellar objects in different evolutionary stages based on the morphology and kinematics of the $^{13}$CO(6-5) emission and to examine their relations with star formation processes. Using the APEX telescope, we obtained maps of the mid-$J$ $^{13}$CO emission with an angular size of 80" x 80" towards 99 massive clumps from the ATLASGAL survey. Our maps are classified based on morphological complexities, and the radial structure of the emission is characterised for simple single-core sources. The velocity centroids of the emission are compared to small- and large-scale gas kinematics, aiming to shed light on the origin of envelope kinematics. $^{13}$CO(6-5) emission is detected towards sources in all stages of high-mass star formation, with a detection rate of 83% for the whole sample. The detection rate, line width, and line peak increase with evolution, and the line luminosity is strongly correlated with $L_{\mathrm{bol}}$ and $M_{\mathrm{clump}}$, indicating that the excitation of $^{13}$CO(6-5) emission is closely related to star formation processes. In addition, the radial distributions of the emission for single-core sources can be well fitted by power-law functions, suggesting a relatively simple envelope structure for many sources. As for the envelope kinematics, linear velocity gradients are common among the single-core sources. Our comparison of kinematics on different scales suggests that the origin of the linear velocity gradients in the warm envelopes is complex and unclear for many sources.

 - **Abstract**
 IRAS source 19312+1950 (hereafter I19312) is an infrared point source with maser emissions of SiO, H$_2$O, and OH molecules. Although initial observations suggested that I19312 might be an evolved star, its characteristics are not fully consistent with this classification. This study aims to further investigate the nature of I19312 by conducting long-term monitoring of its maser emissions and comparing the results with other known astrophysical objects. We conducted long-term monitoring of SiO, H$_2$O, and OH maser emissions using single-dish radio telescopes. The results were then compared with historical maser data and the characteristics of similar objects to infer the possible origin of I19312. The SiO maser emissions from I19312 were detected over a wide velocity range and exhibited significant time variability. The OH maser lines suggest characteristics of an evolved star, while the H$_2$O maser lines indicate molecular outflows. These features suggest that I19312 could be a candidate for a Water Fountain (WF) star, though there are inconsistencies, such as the large molecular gas mass, that challenge this hypothesis. The possibility of I19312 being a Red Nova Remnant (RNR) is also considered, but this remains speculative due to the lack of direct evidence. The evolutionary stage of I19312 remains unclear, but it shares multiple characteristics with both evolved stars with peculiar properties and RNRs. Further long-term monitoring and high-resolution interferometric observations are required to better constrain the nature of this object.

 - **Abstract**
 The cosmic neutrino background and other light relics leave distinct imprints in the cosmic microwave background anisotropies through their gravitational influence. Since neutrinos decoupled from the primordial plasma about one second after the big bang, they have been free-streaming through the universe. This induced a characteristic phase shift in the acoustic peaks as a unique signature. In this work, we constrain the free-streaming nature of these relativistic species and other light relics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics by establishing two complementary template-based approaches to robustly infer the size of this phase shift from the temperature and polarization power spectra. One template shifts the multipoles in these spectra, while the other novel template more fundamentally isolates the phase shift at the level of the underlying photon-baryon perturbations. Applying these methods to Planck data, we detect the neutrino-induced phase shift at about $10\sigma$ significance, which rises to roughly $14\sigma$ with additional data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope and the South Pole Telescope. We also infer that the data is consistent with the Standard Model prediction of three free-streaming neutrinos. In addition, we forecast the capabilities of future experiments which will enable significantly more precise phase-shift measurements, with the Simons Observatory and CMB-S4 reducing the $1\sigma$ uncertainties to roughly 4.3% and 2.5%, respectively. More generally, we establish a new analysis pipeline for the phase shift induced by neutrinos and other free-streaming dark radiation which additionally offers new avenues for exploring physics beyond the Standard Model in a signature-driven and model-agnostic way.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the transition from atomic gas to molecular gas is critical to explain the formation and evolution of molecular clouds. However, the gas phases involved, cold HI and CO-dark molecular gas, are challenging to directly observe and physically characterize. We observed the Cygnus X star-forming complex in carbon radio recombination lines (CRRLs) at 274--399 MHz with the Green Bank Telescope at 21 pc (48') resolution. Of the 30 deg^2 surveyed, we detect line-synthesized C273alpha emission from 24 deg^2 and produce the first large-area maps of low-frequency CRRLs. The morphology of the C273alpha emission reveals arcs, ridges, and extended possibly sheet-like gas which are often on the outskirts of CO emission and likely transitioning from HI-to-H_2. The typical angular separation of C273alpha and 13CO emission is 12 pc, and we estimate C273alpha gas densities of n_H ~ 40 - 400 cm^3. The C273alpha line profiles are Gaussian and likely turbulent broadened, spanning a large range of FWHM from 2 to 20 km/s with a median of 10.6 km/s. Mach numbers fall within 10--30. The turbulent timescale is relatively short, 2.6 Myr, and we deduce that the turbulent pressure likely dominates the evolution of the C273alpha gas. Velocity offsets between C273alpha and 13CO components are apparent throughout the region and have a typical value of 2.9 km/s. Two regimes have emerged from the data: one regime in which C273alpha and 13CO are strongly related (at N_H ~ 4 x 10^21 cm^-2), and a second, in which C273alpha emits independently of the 13CO intensity. In the former regime, C273alpha may arise from the the envelopes of massive clouds (filaments), and in the latter, C273alpha emits from cold clumps in a more-diffuse mix of HI and H_2 gas.

 - **Abstract**
 The large-scale Universal structure comprises strands of dark matter and galaxies with large under-dense volumes known as voids. We measure the fraction of the line of sight that intersects voids for active galactic nuclei (AGN) detected by Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) and quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). This ``voidiness'' fraction is a rudimentary proxy for the density along the line of sight to the galaxies. The voidiness of SDSS-observed quasars (QSOs) is distinctly different from randomly distributed source populations, with a median p-value of $4.6\times10^{-5}$ and $\ll 1\times10^{-7}$, when compared with 500 simulated populations with randomly simulated locations but matching redshifts in the $0.1\leq z<0.4$ and $0.4\leq z < 0.7$ intervals, respectively. A similar comparison of the voidiness for LAT-detected AGN shows median p-values greater than 0.05 in each redshift interval. When comparing the SDSS QSO population to the LAT-detected AGN, we mitigate potential bias from a relationship between redshift and voidiness by comparing the LAT-detected AGN to a ``redshift-matched'' set of SDSS QSOs. The LAT-detected AGN between a redshift of 0.4 and 0.7 show higher voidiness compared to the redshift-matched SDSS QSO populations, with a median p-value of 2.3$\times10^{-5}$, (a $4.1\sigma$ deviation). No deviation is found when comparing the same populations between redshifts of 0.1 and 0.4 (p>0.05). We do not study possible causes of this voidiness difference. It might relate to propagation effects from lower magnetic or radiative background fields within voids or to an environment more favorable for gamma-ray production for AGN near voids.

 - **Abstract**
 Multi-wavelength dust continuum observations of protoplanetary disks are essential for accurately measuring two key ingredients of planets formation theories: the dust mass and grain size. Unfortunately, they are also extremely time-expensive. We aim to investigate the most economic way of performing this analysis. We benchmark the dust characterization analysis on multi-wavelength observations of two disk models. We test three different combinations of bands (in the 0.45 mm $\to$ 7.46 mm range) to see how optically thick and thin observations aid the reconstruction of the dust properties for different morphologies and in three different dust mass regimes. We also test different spatial resolutions. Dust properties are robustly measured in a multi-band analysis if optically thin observations are included. For typical disks, this requires wavelengths longer than 3 mm. High-resolution (< 0.03"-0.05") is fundamental to resolve the changes in dust content of substructures. However, lower-resolution results still provide an accurate measurement of the total dust mass and of the level of grain growth of rings. Additionally, we propose a new approach that successfully combines lower and higher resolution observations in the multi-wavelength analysis without losing spatial information. We also test individually enhancing the resolution of each radial intensity profile with Frank but we note the presence of artifacts. Finally, we discuss on the total dust mass that we derive from the SED analyses and compare it with the traditional method of deriving dust masses from millimeter fluxes. Accurate dust mass measurements from the SED analysis can be derived by including optically thin tracers. On the other hand, single-wavelength flux-based masses are always underestimated by even more than one order of magnitude.
#### HP2 Survey V. Ophiuchus: Filament formation in a dispersing cloud complex

 - **Abstract**
 We search for potential ``birthmarks'' left from the formation of filamentary molecular clouds in the Ophiuchus complex. We use high dynamic-range column density and temperature maps derived from \textit{Herschel}, \textit{Planck}, and \textit{2MASS/NICEST} extinction data. We find two distinct types of filaments based on their orientation relative to nearby massive stars: radial (R-type) and tangential (T-type). R-type filaments exhibit decreasing mass profiles away from massive stars, while T-type filaments show flat but structured profiles. We propose a scenario where both filament types originate from the dynamic interplay of compression and stretching forces exerted by a fast outflow emanating from the OB association. The two formation mechanisms leave distinct observable ``birthmarks'' (namely, filament orientation, mass distribution, and star formation location) on each filament type. Our results illustrate a complex phase in molecular cloud evolution with two simultaneous yet contrasting processes: the formation of filaments and stars via the dispersal of residual gas from a previous massive star formation event. Our approach highlights the importance of taking into account the wider context of a star-forming complex, rather than concentrating exclusively on particular subregions.
