 - **Abstract**
 We quantify departures from hydrodynamical and centrifugal equilibrium in the gas discs of low-mass ($10^{10.75}<M_\mathrm{200c}/\mathrm{M}_\odot<10^{11}$) galaxies from the COLIBRE cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. We evaluate the full Eulerian acceleration balance in the midplane and show that disequilibrium is widespread: equilibrium-based circular velocity estimates typically have errors of $\geq 10$ per cent ($\approx 75$ per cent of midplane gas by mass). Disequilibrium is strongest and the largest associated errors occur in the inner few kiloparsecs that are crucial for constraining the dark matter density profile. Correcting the circular velocity to account for pressure and convective terms does not reliably improve its recovery in strongly perturbed systems where time-dependent forces dominate the residual acceleration budget. Stellar feedback, self-gravitating gas clumps and AGN energy injection account for most strong local perturbations, and large-scale gravitational asymmetries act as a scaffold for disequilibrium. We classify gas discs into coherent, perturbed, and slow/erratic rotators and show that this classification correlates with galaxy properties like mass, morphology and tracers of recent feedback. A majority of galaxies in our sample would be unsuitable for standard rotation curve analysis. Much of the observed diversity in the shapes of dwarf galaxy rotation curves may stem from non-equilibrium gas motions rather than diversity in mass profiles - resolving the discrepancy is then first and foremost a problem in gas dynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 We present new JWST IFS observations of the active galaxy NGC 1068, combining Mid-IR and optical IFS data from MIRI and MUSE to characterize the multi-phase circumnuclear gas properties and its interaction with the AGN outflow and radio jet. MIRI data trace the multiphase gas emission up to 400 pc from the nucleus at 20--60 pc resolution, unveiling a clumpy ionized structure around the radio hot-spots and a rotating warm molecular disc. Innovative Mid-IR diagnostic diagrams highlight the role of the AGN as the main excitation source for the ionized gas in the entire MIRI field of view, consistent with optical diagnostics, and supporting the AGN-driven wind scenario. Density sensitive [NeV] and [ArV] Mid-IR transitions reveal high-density clumps (n_e > 10**4 cm**-3) along the edges of the jet and outflow, tracing gas compression by the expanding wind. We combined multi-cloud kinematic (MOKA) and photo-ionization (HOMERUN) modeling to characterize the ionized outflow properties and found that [OIV] traces an outflow 300 km/s faster than that inferred from [OIII], showing that the two lines originate from distinct gas components. This kinematic dichotomy is confirmed by the photoionization analysis, which requires a dust-poor component dominating the optical lines and a dust-rich component responsible for the Mid-IR emission. The Mid-IR-revealed dusty component carries a significantly larger ionized-gas mass than what can be inferred from optical lines alone, showing that most of the outflowing mass is hidden from classical optical diagnostics. Our modelling point to a two-stage acceleration scenario, with velocities up to ~2000 km/s, consistent with an energy-driven wind. Our findings indicates that the outflow entrains up to a few 10**6 solar masses of ionized gas and couples efficiently with the surrounding ISM, injecting turbulence and impacting the host-galaxy environment.
#### Balmer Transition Signatures from Gas-Enshrouded, Dust-Poor Active Galactic Nuclei

 - **Abstract**
 Little red dots (LRDs), a population of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) recently discovered by JWST, show distinctive Balmer-transition features, including prominent Balmer absorption, pronounced Balmer breaks, and large equivalent widths of broad $\mathrm{H}\alpha$ emission, all of which indicate the presence of dense gas surrounding their central black holes. A further key property of LRDs is their large Balmer decrements with broad $\mathrm{H}\alpha/\mathrm{H}\beta$ line-flux ratios far exceeding the Case B recombination value. These ratios of $\mathrm{H}\alpha/\mathrm{H}\beta>3$ have often been interpreted as evidence for heavy dust extinction ($A_V\gtrsim 3$ mag), however such dust would inevitably produce strong near-to-mid infrared re-emission that is hardly seen in JWST/MIRI observations. To investigate the physical origin of these observed Balmer features, we perform radiation transfer calculations through dust-free, dense gas. We show that the observed large Balmer decrements ($\mathrm{H}\alpha/\mathrm{H}\beta$ and $\mathrm{H}\alpha/\mathrm{H}\gamma$) naturally arise from Balmer resonance scattering without invoking dust. At sufficiently high densities ($n_\mathrm{H} \gtrsim 10^{{8}-{10}}~\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$), the elevated multiple Balmer-line ratios converge to values that closely mimic dust reddening, explaining why LRD spectra resemble obscured AGNs. Furthermore, when the Balmer break and broad Balmer lines originate in the same dense gas, their strengths are physically linked, allowing us to constrain the density structure and infer a low broad-line region gas mass of $\sim O(10~M_\odot)$. Such a small gas reservoir would be enriched by even a single supernova, implying that LRDs with observed low-metallicity signatures likely experienced minimal star formation in their nuclei.

 - **Abstract**
 Active galactic nuclei (AGN) provide energetic feedback necessary to `turn off' star formation in high-mass galaxies (M$_{\rm halo} \geq $ 10$^{12.5}$ M$_{\odot}$, $10.4 \leq \log(\frac{M_*}{M_\odot}) \leq 11$) as observed. Cosmic rays (CRs) have been proposed as a promising channel of AGN feedback, but the nature of CR feedback from AGN remains uncertain. We analyze a set of high-resolution simulations of massive galaxies from the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE-3) project including multi-channel AGN feedback, explicitly evolving kinetic/mechanical, radiative, and spectrally-resolved CRs from the central black hole. Specifically, we explore different CR feedback and transport assumptions, calibrated to Milky Way local ISM constraints, and compare them to observed galaxy scaling relations. We find that all parameterizations explored self-regulate within agreement with observed galaxy scaling relations, demonstrating that CR injection efficiencies varied by $\sim$1.5 dex and locally-variable transport produce quenched galaxies with reasonable bulk properties; however, they feature orders-of-magnitude variant circumgalactic medium (CGM) gas properties. Our results indicate that multi-wavelength synthetic observations probing these varied halo properties from larger simulated samples in conjunction with observational comparisons may place novel constraints on how AGN physically quench star formation in massive galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetically driven phenomena such as flaring events and aurorae lead ultracool dwarfs to emit at radio frequencies. Despite decades of scrutiny, a comprehensive physical understanding of their radio emission at different frequencies remains elusive, spurring on additional study of these complex objects. The VLA Low-band Ionosphere and Transient Experiment (VLITE) is a commensal instrument operating at 340 MHz on the Very Large Array. A key advantage of 340 MHz observations is their sensitivity to circumstellar disks and planets at understudied distances from the stellar disk, intermediate between GHz and low MHz sensitivities. Hard-to-find coronal mass ejections are also predicted to be detectable at 340 MHz. However, this frequency regime is relatively unprobed in ultracool dwarf studies, with few searches and no published detections to date. Here we highlight our investigation of the nearby M7-M7 binary, EI Cancri. EI Cancri AB is magnetically active, yet has an uncharacteristically long 83-day candidate rotation period within the system. With the VLITE detection of the EI Cancri system, we present the first ever detection of ultracool dwarf emission at 340 MHz.

 - **Abstract**
 A cosmological origin of the magnetic fields in large scale structures of the Universe would require a non-negligible magnetic field in cosmic voids, which, however, remains undetected. Gamma-ray emission from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) offers the opportunity to indirectly probe such an intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF), as gamma rays interact with cosmic radiation fields, producing electron-positron pairs, and initiate an electromagnetic cascade. The deflection of the pairs in the IGMF results in a time-delayed signal at GeV energies. Using observations with the Fermi Large Area Telescope of the GRB 221009A, we are able to derive the most stringent constraints to date from the non-observation of the cascade and rule out magnetic fields B < 2.5 x 10^{-17} G at 95% confidence level for a coherence length larger than 1 Mpc. Our results are comparable to limits obtained from blazar observations but do not suffer from assumptions on the duty cycle of the gamma-ray source or whether inverse-Compton scattering losses dominate over the development of plasma instabilities.

 - **Abstract**
 Occultations, the covering up of one celestial body by another celestial body, have been used in astronomy for millennia to learn about the sun and moon. Since 2018, VERITAS has implemented a program to detect predicted asteroid occultations, where an asteroid covers up a star. VERITAS has attempted to observe over 100 occultations to date and successfully observed 20 occultations. With these occultations, VERITAS can directly measure the smallest angular diameters of any instrument or technique in the optical for stars between magnitude 9 and 13. Each angular diameter is measured by fitting the diffraction pattern observed by the central VERITAS pixel at the start and end of an occultation. Once a planned FADC upgrade is complete, VERITAS will begin a program to search for serendipitous occultations within its full field of view (3 deg). Serendipitous occultations of sub-km trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) have the potential to constrain models of solar system formation. This work details how VERITAS predicts and observes occultations as well as the overall status of the asteroid occultation program and future steps for observing occultations of both asteroids and TNOs.
#### The magnetic origin of the outer boundary of sunspots

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Sunspot boundaries are commonly outlined by contours of the continuum intensity. However, their magnetic nature has not yet been fully characterised. Aims. We investigate the properties of the outer boundary of a long-lived sunspot to identify the magnetic property that defines it. Methods. We analysed the magnetic properties of AR NOAA11591 spot during its two passages across the solar disc, using SDO/HMI continuum intensity and magnetic field, and determined their contours to outline the outer boundary. Results. During the 1st disc passage, in which the sunspot is in its stable phase, the intensity contours at 0.9 of the mean quiet Sun intensity and isocontours of the magnetic field strength of 625G provide an almost perfect match between the two contours. With these thresholds, the time-averaged area of mismatch is minimised, yielding an average distance between the contours of 0.58 pixel, corresponding to less than 0.26 arcsec. During the 2nd disc passage, the spot shows clear signs of decay, and we find that the 0.9 intensity and 625G magnetic isocontours detach from each other, coupled to the disappearance of penumbra. In this super-equipartition area, granulation still operates. Conclusions. Based on a comparison with simulation data from our previous work, and in agreement with findings of other authors, we conclude that the outer boundary of stable sunspots is defined by an invariant magnetic field: the equipartition field. From the discrepancy between intensity and magnetic contours during the decaying phase of the sunspot, we surmise that alongside the well-established (magneto-)convective regimes of the photosphere - granular, penumbral, and umbral - a super-equipartition granular regime can be identified. In this regime, bright, but smaller granules occur where the magnetic field exceeds equipartition but remains sub-critical for convection suppression.

 - **Abstract**
 Parker Solar Probe (PSP) observes abundant circularly polarized ion-scale waves throughout the inner heliosphere. These waves are a signature of the interplay between plasma microinstabilities and turbulent dissipation. We perform a mission-wide statistical survey of ion-scale waves observed by PSP, investigating if the waves correspond to specific free energy sources in the measured proton velocity distributions. We find that left-handed waves (LHWs) are frequently observed, with the fraction of time they are observed increasing closer to the Sun, reaching $\sim$30\%. Right-handed waves (RHWs) are less frequently observed, with the associated time fraction decreasing closer to the Sun. The observed LHWs are generally consistent with parallel propagating ion cyclotron wave (ICW) storms that occur continuously for extended periods of time. Turbulent energy spectra are consistently steeper when LHW storms are observed; these wave storms mediate the spatial transport of the free energy associated with temperature anisotropy. The observed RHWs are generally consistent with oblique and parallel fast magnetosonic waves (FMWs), and their observation is well correlated with enhanced proton parallel heat flux, which quantifies the presence of secondary proton populations. Using observations and the SAVIC machine learning instability identification algorithm, we identify a threshold on the proton heat flux beyond which FMWs are likely to be driven unstable by the proton beams. We are thus able to associate trends in the observed ion-scale waves with known sources of free energy for Encounters 3 through 24 of the PSP's prime science phase.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigated the morphology and strength of magnetic fields in pillar-shaped structures at the boundaries of HII regions by combining three-dimensional radiation-magnetohydrodynamic, R-MHD, simulations with synthetic polarimetric observations. Our analysis focuses on the first pillar formed self-consistently in the simulation and is used as a proof of concept to test the applicability of the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi (DCF) method under conditions dominated by external agents. The pillar arises as the ionization front compresses a dense clump, producing a magnetically aligned, elongated structure whose morphology and field configuration closely resemble those observed in real systems such as the pillars of M16. Synthetic dust-polarization maps at 850 $\mu$m reproduce the large-scale magnetic morphology of the simulated pillar, confirming that polarimetry is a reliable tracer of magnetic field geometry. However, magnetic field strengths inferred using DCF-type methods systematically overestimate intrinsic values from the simulations by factors $\gtrsim 2$. We attribute this discrepancy to the fact that field alignment and amplification are primarily driven by external gas pressure from the expanding HII region rather than internal turbulence, thus violating key assumptions of the DCF method. Our results highlight the need for caution when applying classical DCF-based analysis to pillars or other structures shaped by external compressions.
#### Kennicutt-Schmidt relation of galaxies over 13 billion years in the COLIBRE hydrodynamical simulations

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the correlation between star formation rate (SFR) surface density and gas surface density (known as the Kennicutt-Schmidt, KS, relation) at kiloparsec (kpc) scales across cosmic time ($0\le z \le 8$) using the COLIBRE state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. These simulations feature on-the-fly non-equilibrium chemistry coupled to dust grain evolution and detailed radiative cooling down to $\approx 10$~K, enabling direct predictions for the atomic (HI) and molecular (H$_2$) KS relations. At $z\approx 0$, COLIBRE reproduces the observed (spatially-resolved) KS relations for HI and H$_2$, including the associated scatter, which we predict to be significantly correlated with stellar surface density, local specific SFR (sSFR), and gas metallicity. We show that the HI KS relation steepens for lower-mass galaxies, while the H$_2$ KS relation shifts to higher normalisation in galaxies with higher sSFRs. The H$_2$ depletion time decreases by a factor of $\approx 20$ from $z = 0$ to $z = 8$, primarily due to the decreasing gas-phase metallicity. This results in less H$_2$ and more HI being associated with a given SFR at higher redshift. We also find that galaxies with higher sSFRs have a larger molecular gas content and higher star formation efficiency per unit gas mass on kpc scales. The predicted evolution of the H$_2$ depletion time and its correlation with a galaxy's sSFR agree remarkably well with observations in a wide redshift range, $0\le z\le 5$.

 - **Abstract**
 Large-scale intergalactic magnetic fields may contain a mixture of galactic and cosmogenic contributions, that can be probed via observations of $\gamma$-ray "echo" from sources at cosmological distances. While these contributions may be disentangled based on the difference in their redshift evolution, thus far indications of non-negligible magnetic field have been found only at low redshifts. This work aims at extending the intergalactic magnetic field constraints to redshifts $z\gtrsim 1$ using 17-year long all-sky observations of high-redshift active galactic nuclei with Fermi/LAT $\gamma$-ray telescope. Combing the Fermi/LAT measurements in the 0.1 GeV - 1 TeV energy range with the Monte Carlo simulations of the $\gamma$-ray "echo", it is shown that the zero field strength hypothesis at $z = [0.5; 3]$ is disfavoured at the $\approx 9\sigma$ significance level, yielding the lower limit of $B \gtrsim 1\times10^{-18}$ cG for the magnetic field correlation length above 1 Mpc. It is further shown that the same data put a lower limit on the volume-filling fraction of this field of $f\gtrsim 90\%$ in the redshift range considered. It is also demonstrated that the derived limits are not substantially affected by either source flux variability or the assumed $\gamma$-ray emission attenuation model. Implications of these limits for intergalactic magnetic field origin are discussed.
#### The Influential Roles of Gravity, Turbulence, and Magnetic Fields in Shaping the Physical Evolution of Dense Massive Clumps

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the roles of the three competitors, namely, gravity, turbulence, and magnetic fields, in controlling star formation (SF) within dense, massive clumps identified in the ATLASGAL survey. By examining scaling relations, virial parameters, and turbulent energy spectra, we evaluate the dynamical state of these clumps. We observe a weak velocity dispersion-size relation (sigma proportional to L^0.11), which is much shallower than the classical Larson-like relations, suggesting that turbulence does not mainly drive internal dynamics. The turbulent energy spectrum, E(k) proportional to k^-1.21, is also less steep than what is expected for both incompressible and compressible turbulence. We equally observe a decreasing trend in the virial parameter with increasing mass (alpha_vir proportional to M^-0.37), indicating that more massive clumps are increasingly gravitationally bound. These trends indicate an increasing relative dominance of gravity over turbulence at smaller scales, aligning with multiscale collapse scenarios; however, the absolute energy balance remains unquantifiable with the current data. Although magnetic fields are not directly measured, their potential influence is considered in the interpretation of pressure balance and dynamical support. Our findings imply that gravitational processes appear to primarily regulate the structure and evolution of massive clumps.

 - **Abstract**
 Polarization is one of the fundamental natures of electromagnetic radiation. The detection of polarization or polarized photons from distant X-ray radiating systems (such as X-ray binaries (XBs), active galactic nuclei (AGN), pulsars, and stars) complements the timing, spectral, and imagining analysis to better understand the physical mechanisms taking place in these sources. Polarization has enhanced the understanding of the internal geometry of these systems and their vicinity. Polarized X-rays can be generated either directly through non-thermal physical processes in the presence of a magnetic field(B) or through the scattering of unpolarized thermal radiation within plasma structures such as an accretion disk. X-ray polarization can measure the two important independent parameters, the polarization degree (PD) and polarization angle (PA) of the X-ray photons. These parameters are crucial as they reveal the characteristics of particles in such a strong magnetic and gravitational field. In this chapter, we have discussed (i) the basic idea of polarization, (ii) some distant sources radiating polarized X-ray photons, (iii) missions dedicated to observing polarized X-ray photons, and (iv) recent breakthroughs and upcoming missions.

 - **Abstract**
 The dark ages 21-cm signal is a promising probe of the currently unobserved infant universe between the formation of the Cosmic Microwave Background around $z \approx 1100$ and the first galaxies around $z\approx 30$. A detection of the signal will help researchers understanding the nature of dark matter and dark energy, the expansion of the universe and any extensions to the concordance $\Lambda$CDM model that could explain the reported Cosmic Dawn 21-cm signal from EDGES and the Hubble tension. In this letter we take existing constraints on the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model from two early time probes, Planck and WMAP, and two late time probes, DES galaxy lensing and clustering and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, and propagate these through to constraints on the magnitude of the dark ages 21-cm signal. We constrain the magnitude and central frequency of the signal while methodically accounting for uncertainties in the cosmological parameters. We find that within the context of our modelling assumptions and the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, the depth of the dark ages 21-cm signal is known to better than 1 mK and the central frequency to within 0.05 MHz.

 - **Abstract**
 We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of the counterpart of EP240801a, at z=1.67, the first fast X-ray transient (FXT) identified as an X-ray flash (XRF) by the Einstein Probe (EP) and Fermi-GBM. Our observations reveal strong photometric and spectroscopic evidence for an associated broad-lined Type Ic supernova (SN) SN 2024aihh, the most distant spectroscopically identified gamma ray-burst (GRB)-SN to date. The SN exhibits similar luminosity and light curve evolution to the proto-type GRB-SN 1998bw with an absolute magnitude of the SN at $\sim$23 days rest-frame of $M_{F140W} \approx$-19 mag. The SN is located in a host galaxy with complex morphology at a large ($\sim$6 kpc) offset in a region of relatively low surface brightness. The region around the SN has a modest star formation rate and is dominated by an intermediate mass-weighted age (1.4$\pm$0.3 Gyr) population, despite the apparent presence of a young, massive broad-lined Type Ic SN progenitor. These observations demonstrate that observations with HST and JWST can greatly extend the redshift range over which the GRB/FXT-SN connection can be studied, including in relatively low luminosity, X-ray rich events. They demonstrate little apparent evolution in the SN properties from local examples despite EP240801a originating from an epoch 10 Gyr ago.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic reconnection powers explosive releases of magnetic energy, heating and particle acceleration throughout the plasma universe. Knowledge of this universal process is vital to understanding the Heliosphere, as it plays a key role in solar flares, coronal mass ejections, coronal heating, solar wind acceleration, geomagnetic storms, and interactions between the solar wind and planetary magnetospheres. As such, reconnection underpins multiple science objectives of multiple future space missions. The UK plays a leading role in this international field, through a combination of in situ measurements from Earth's magnetosphere and the solar wind, observations of the solar corona and chromosphere, and world-class numerical simulations and theory. This white paper identifies: Nine priority science objectives for reconnection research in the next decade; Recommendations to guide investment in theory, simulations and infrastructure; Mission priorities and required measurements to ensure the UK maintains and improves its world-class credentials in reconnection science.

 - **Abstract**
 Models of interacting dark energy (DE) and dark matter (DM) involving pure momentum exchange are a promising avenue for resolving cosmological tensions. However, the behaviour of these interactions in the theoretically challenging limit where the DE equation of state, $w$, approaches $-1$ is not fully understood. We demonstrate that a generic feature of these models is a $w$-dependent velocity-locking mechanism, which systematically shifts the onset of matter power spectrum suppression to smaller scales as $w \rightarrow -1$. The suppression magnitude depends on the difference in fluid velocities. In this limit, however, the interaction's drag dominates over the DE pressure support and causes the DE velocity to track that of the DM fluid at larger scales. This mechanism provides a physical explanation for the weaker constraints found in the literature when $w\approx-1$ in models where the interaction strength does not explicitly depend on $w$. We also demonstrate that the common approximation of neglecting DE perturbations ($\delta_{\mathrm{DE}}=\theta_{\mathrm{DE}}=0$) fails in this limit. By artificially increasing the velocity difference between the fluids, this simplification incorrectly removes the $w$-dependent velocity-locking mechanism and erases the shift in power spectrum suppression to smaller scales. This leads to an overestimation of the constraining power of cosmological data on the interaction strength.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an original data analysis and a physical model that provide new insights into the origin of, and relationship between, two observables of the dusty, polarized Galaxy at intermediate and high latitudes: (i) the misalignment between HI filamentary structures and magnetic fields and (ii) the positive $TB$ correlation measured in Planck data suggesting parity violation in the interstellar medium (ISM). We confirm an observational link between the two effects and find that both are predominantly produced at large angular scales ($\geq 10^\circ$, multipoles $\ell \leq 20$) with a significantly stronger signal in the northern hemisphere. We propose a model in which filaments and magnetic fields appear misaligned in projection because they are sourced by cold and warm gas phases distributed in different proportions in the Solar neighborhood, from the wall of the Local Bubble to larger distances. These projection effects at large angular scales can produce coherent signatures that propagate to smaller scales in power spectra without invoking local, small-scale filament misalignment. Within this frame, HI filaments remain statistically aligned with the magnetic field in 3D, although with a projected scatter of tens of degrees that requires further investigation. The multiphase, geometrical model presented in this work is supported by Planck polarization data at 30 GHz, where synchrotron radiation dominates, and at 217 and 353 GHz, where dust emission dominates. Our analysis also incorporates starlight polarization measurements. The model introduced here suggests a new interpretation of two unexplained observables and emphasizes the role of the large-scale magnetized ISM in shaping polarized Galactic emission, which has important implications for both Galactic astrophysics and cosmological foreground characterization.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a cosmological zoom-in simulation targeting the high redshift compact progenitor phase of massive galaxies, with the most massive galaxy reaching a stellar mass of $M_{\star}=8.5\times 10^{10} \ M_{\odot}$ at $z=5$. The dynamics of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) is modelled from seeding down to their coalescence at sub-parsec scales due to gravitational wave (GW) emission by utilising a new version of the KETJU code, which combines regularised integration of sufficiently massive SMBHs with a dynamical friction subgrid model for lower-mass SMBHs. All nine massive galaxies included in this study go through a gas-dominated phase of early compaction in the redshift range of $z\sim 7-9$, starting at stellar masses of $M_\star\gtrsim 10^8\ \mathrm{M}_\odot$ and ending at a few times $M_{\star}\sim 10^9\ \mathrm{M}_\odot$. The sizes, masses and broad band fluxes of these compact systems are in general agreement with the population of systems observed with JWST known as `Little Red Dots'. In the compact phase, the stellar and SMBH masses grow rapidly, leading to a sharp decline in the central gas fractions. The outer regions, however, remain relatively gas-rich, leading to subsequent off-centre star formation and size growth. Due to the very high central stellar densities ($\rho_{\star}\gtrsim 10^{13}\,\mathrm{M_\odot/kpc^3}$), the SMBHs merge rapidly, typically just $\sim 4-35\ \mathrm{Myr}$ after the SMBH binaries have become bound. Combining KETJU with the phenomenological PhenomD model resolves the complete evolution of the GW emission from SMBH binaries through the Pulsar Timing Array frequency waveband up to the final few orbits that produce GWs observable with the future LISA mission.

 - **Abstract**
 The search for free-floating planets (FFPs) is a key science driver for upcoming microlensing surveys like the Nancy Grace Roman Galactic Exoplanet Survey. These rogue worlds are typically detected via short-duration microlensing events, the characterization of which often requires analyzing noisy, irregularly-sampled observations. We present a pipeline for this task using simulation-based inference. We use a Transformer encoder to learn a compressed summary representation of the raw time-series data, which in turn conditions a neural posterior estimator. We demonstrate that our method produces accurate and well-calibrated posteriors over three orders of magnitude faster than traditional methods. We also demonstrate its performance on KMT-BLG-2019-2073, a short-duration FFP candidate event.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the spatially resolved star formation, gas ionisation, and outflow properties of 1813 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) from the MaNGA survey, which we classify into infrared (IR), broad-line (BL), narrow-line (NL), and radio (RD) AGNs based on their mid-infrared colours, optical spectra, and/or radio photometry. We also provide estimations of AGN power at different wavelengths. AGN incidence is found to increase with stellar mass following a power-law, with the high-mass end dominated by RDAGNs and the low-mass end dominated by NLAGNs. Compared to their mass-matched non-AGN counterparts, we find that IRAGNs, BLAGNs, and NLAGNs on average show enhanced specific star formation rates, younger stellar populations, and harder ionisation towards the centre. RDAGNs, in contrast, show radial profiles similar to quiescent galaxies. [OIII] outflows are more common and stronger in BL/IRAGNs, while RDAGNs on average show no outflow features. The outflow incidence increases with [OIII] luminosity, and the features in BL/IRAGNs on average extend to ~2 kpc from the nuclei. We further discuss a possible evolutionary sequence of AGNs and their host galaxies, where AGNs with strong emission lines or dust tori are present in star-forming galaxies. Later, young compact radio jets emerge, the host galaxies gradually quench, and the AGN hosts eventually evolve into globally quiescent systems with larger radio jets that prevent further gas cooling.

 - **Abstract**
 The multi-band HSC-CLAUDS survey comprises several sky regions with varying observing conditions, only one of which, the COSMOS Ultra Deep Field (UDF), offers extensive redshift coverage. We aim to exploit a complete sample of labeled galaxies from the COSMOS UDF at i<25 (z<~5) to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) and infer more accurate photometric redshifts in the other regions than those currently available from SED-fitting methods. To address the severe domain mismatch problem we observed when applying the trained CNN to regions other than the COSMOS UDF, we developed an unsupervised adversarial domain adaptation network that we grafted onto the CNN. The method is validated by three tests: the predicted redshifts are compared to the spectroscopic redshifts that are available for limited samples of mostly bright galaxies; the predicted redshift distributions of the entire galaxy population of a given field in several intervals of magnitude are compared to those of the COSMOS UDF, assumed to be representative; the redshifts predicted for a sample of galaxies selected by narrow-band filter observations sensitive to [OII] emitters at z~1.47 are compared to those of confirmed [OII] emission line galaxies. The results show successful domain adaptation: the network is able to transfer its redshift classification capability learnt from the COSMOS UDF to other regions of HSC-CLAUDS. Accuracy varies depending on magnitude and redshift, following that of the labels we used, but far exceeds that of currently available photometric redshifts. The catalogs of CNN redshifts we inferred for the XMM, DEEP2 and ELAIS fields and for the remaining COSMOS region (~4 million sources in total at i<25) are made public.
#### The Effect of a Non-universal Extinction Curve on the Wesenheit Function and Cepheid Distances

 - **Abstract**
 The Wesenheit function is widely used to reduce the effects of interstellar reddening in distance measurements. Its construction, however, relies on the assumption of a universal extinction curve and on fixed values of the total-to-selective extinction ratio, Rv. Recent studies have shown that Rv varies significantly across the Milky Way and between different galaxies, raising concerns about systematic biases in Wesenheit magnitudes and period-Wesenheit relations. In this work, we discuss the impact of non-universal extinction on Wesenheit indices by combining the Rv-dependent extinction curve with a grid of stellar atmosphere models. We compute the integrated extinction in optical and near-infrared passbands, derive Rv-dependent R coefficients for multiple Wesenheit indices, and examine how changes in Rv propagate into Wesenheit magnitudes and Cepheid distances in our Galaxy. We find that the R coefficients in the Wesenheit functions vary strongly with Rv. For classical Cepheids in the Milky Way disk, variations of Rv within the typical observed range (2.6-3.6) can lead to substantial differences in the Wesenheit function, reaching +-0.7 mag from the mean for the Gaia-based Wesenheit index W_G and resulting in distance errors of almost 40%. Near-infrared Wesenheit indices are much less sensitive to Rv changes. Our results clearly show that accounting for variable Rv is essential when applying period-Wesenheit relations, particularly in the optical regime, or that near or mid infrared based distances should be used. While we present this effect for classical Cepheids, it applies to all pulsating stars for which period-Wesenheit relations are used to infer distances.
