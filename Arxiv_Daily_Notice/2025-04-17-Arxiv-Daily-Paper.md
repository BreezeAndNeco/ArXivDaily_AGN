 - **Abstract**
 Gaia parallax measurements for stars with poor astrometric fits -- as evidenced by high renormalized unit weight error (RUWE) -- are often assumed to be unreliable, but the extent and nature of their biases remain poorly quantified. High RUWE is usually a consequence of binarity or higher-order multiplicity, so the parallaxes of sources with high RUWE are often of greatest astrophysical interest. Using realistic simulations of Gaia epoch astrometry, we show that the parallax uncertainties of sources with elevated RUWE are underestimated by a factor that ranges from 1 to 4 and can be robustly predicted from observables. We derive an empirical prescription to inflate reported uncertainties based on a simple analytic function of RUWE, apparent magnitude, and parallax. We validate the correction using (a) single-star solutions for Gaia sources with known orbital solutions and (b) wide binaries containing one component with elevated RUWE. The same uncertainty corrections are expected to perform well in DR4 and DR5. Our results demonstrate that Gaia parallaxes for high-RUWE sources can still yield robust distance estimates if uncertainties are appropriately inflated, enabling distance constraints for triples, binaries with periods too long or too short to be fit astrometrically, and sources blended with neighboring sources.
#### Oxyster: A Circumgalactic Low-ionization Oxygen Nebula next to a Starburst Galaxy at $z\sim1$

 - **Abstract**
 Extended emission line nebulae around galaxies or active galactic nuclei (AGNs) provide a unique window to investigate the galactic ecosystem through the circumgalactic medium (CGM). Using Subaru Hyper-Suprime Cam narrow-band imaging and spectroscopic follow-up, we serendipitously discover "Oxyster" - a large ionized nebula next to an interacting starburst galaxy at $z=0.924$. The nebula is traced by extended [OII]3726,3729 ($\sim 30$ kpc) and [OIII]5007 ($\sim 20$ kpc) emission lines. On the nebula luminosity-size plane, Oxyster surpasses the extended narrow-line regions around low-$z$ AGNs, resembling a higher-$z$ analog of "Hanny's Voorwerp". However, its uniformly low [OIII]/[OII] ratio (O32) sets it apart from typical AGN light echoes. For the host galaxy, HST and JWST images reveal a disturbed red disk galaxy with a single blue spiral "arm". Spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting suggests the $2-6\times 10^{10} ~\rm M_{\odot}$ host galaxy sits above the star-forming main sequence with an ongoing starburst, especially in the "arm", and have $<5\%$ luminosity contribution from AGN, consistent with X-ray non-detection and radio continuum. Standard photoionization and shock models struggle to explain simultaneously Oxyster's emission line luminosities, low O32 ratio, and the non-detection of H$\beta$ line. A plausible explanation could involve the combination of a recent ($<10^8$ yrs) starburst and a low-luminosity AGN ($L_{\rm{bol}} \sim 1\times10^{42}$ erg/s). While Oxyster's nature awaits future investigation, its discovery highlights the potential of ground-based narrow-band imaging to uncover extended emission line nebulae around non-AGN systems, opening new avenues for studying the CGM of normal galaxies in the early Universe.
#### 3D full-GR simulations of magnetorotational core-collapse supernovae on GPUs: A systematic study of rotation rates and magnetic fields

 - **Abstract**
 We present a series of fully three-dimensional, dynamical-spacetime general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) simulations of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) for a progenitor of zero-age-main-sequence (ZAMS) mass $25\, M_\odot$. We simulate a total of 12 models for simulation times in the range $190-260\, \mathrm{ms}$ to systematically study the effect of rotation rates and magnetic fields on jet formation via the magnetorotational mechanism. We have performed simulations on OLCF's Frontier using the new GPU-accelerated dynamical-spacetime GRMHD code \theCode for magnetic fields $B_0 = (10^{11}, 10^{12})\, \mathrm{G}$ and rotation rates $\Omega_0 = (0.14, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5)\, \mathrm{rad/s}$. We always resolve the entire region containing the shock with a resolution of at least $1.48\, \mathrm{km}$. We find that models with $B_0=10^{11}\, \mathrm{G}$ fail to explode, while those with $B_0=10^{12}\, \mathrm{G}$ show a wide range of jet morphologies and explosive outcomes depending on the rotation rate. Models with $B_0=10^{12}\, \mathrm{G}$ and $\Omega_0=(1.0,1.5)\, \mathrm{rad/s}$ form jets that bend sideways, giving the ejecta a more spherical character, and possibly representing explosions that \textit{appear} neutrino-driven even though they are magnetorotationally-driven. Models with $B_0=10^{12}\, \mathrm{G}$ and $\Omega_0\geq2.0\, \mathrm{rad/s}$ show ejecta velocities $\gtrsim15000\, \mathrm{km/s}$, making them suitable candidates for broad-lined type Ic supernova progenitors. This work represents the largest set of 3D general-relativistic GRMHD simulations studying magnetorotational supernovae in full GR and demonstrates the potential of systematic studies with GPU-accelerated 3D simulations of CCSNe.

 - **Abstract**
 The modulation of low-energy galactic cosmic rays reflects interplanetary magnetic field variations and can provide useful information on solar activity. An array of ground-surface detectors can reveal the secondary particles, which originate from the interaction of cosmic rays with the atmosphere. In this work, we present an investigation of the low-threshold rate (scaler) time series recorded in 16 years of operation by the Pierre Auger Observatory surface detectors in Malargue, Argentina. Through an advanced spectral analysis, we detected highly statistically significant variations in the time series with periods ranging from the decadal to the daily scale. We investigate their origin, revealing a direct connection with solar variability. Thanks to their intrinsic very low noise level, the Auger scalers allow a thorough and detailed investigation of the galactic cosmic-ray flux variations in the heliosphere at different timescales and can, therefore, be considered a new proxy of solar variability.

 - **Abstract**
 Microlensing events provide a unique way to detect and measure the masses of isolated, non-luminous objects, particularly dark stellar remnants. Under certain conditions, it is possible to measure the mass of these objects using photometry alone, specifically when a microlensing light curve displays a finite-source (FS) effect. This effect generally occurs in highly magnified light curves, i.e. when the source and the lens are very well aligned. In this study, we analyse Gaia Alerts and Gaia Data Release 3 datasets, identifying four moderate-to-high-magnification microlensing events without a discernible FS effect. The absence of this effect suggests a large Einstein radius, implying substantial lens masses. In each event, we constrain the FS effect and therefore establish lower limits for angular Einstein radius and lens mass. Additionally, we use the DarkLensCode software to obtain mass, distance, and brightness distribution for the lens based on the Galactic model. Our analysis established lower mass limits of $\sim 0.2$ $M_{\odot}$ for one lens and $\sim 0.3-0.5$ $M_{\odot}$ for two others. DarkLensCode analysis supports these findings, estimating lens masses in the range of$\sim 0.42-1.66$ $M_{\odot}$ and dark lens probabilities exceeding 60\%. These results strongly indicate that the lenses are stellar remnants, such as white dwarfs or neutron stars. While further investigations are required to confirm the nature of these lenses, we demonstrate a straightforward yet effective approach to identifying stellar remnant candidates.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxies grow alongside their central supermassive black holes (SMBHs), linked through fueling and feedback. However, the origins and details of this co-evolution remain unclear and differ significantly amongst modeling frameworks. Using a suite of semi-analytic models (SAMs), we trace SMBH mass assembly across $M_{\rm BH} \sim 10^{6-10}, \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. We find significant discrepancies between observations and physics-based models of the local black hole mass function (BHMF), likely due to differences in the underlying stellar mass function and the scaling relations therefrom used to infer the BHMF. However, most physics-based models agree at $z \sim 1-4$ and align reasonably well with broad-line AGN BHMF from JWST observations at $z=4-5$. Most physics-based models reproduce the bolometric AGN luminosity evolution, except {\sc Dark Sage}, which predicts an excess deviating from models and observations. Interestingly, this pronounced ``knee' in the bolometric AGN luminosity function predicted by {\sc Dark Sage} around $L_{\rm bol} \sim 10^{46} \, \mathrm{erg \, s^{-1}}$ is consistent with the inferred luminosity of ``Little Red Dots'' at $z=5-6$, assuming that their entire emission originates from AGN activity. We analyze black hole mass build-up and accretion histories in {\sc Dark Sage}, which, unlike other models, allows for super-Eddington accretion. We report that on average, SMBHs in {\sc Dark Sage} primarily grow through secular disk instabilities and merger-driven cold gas accretion, while black hole mergers contribute 60\% of the total mass budget only for the most massive SMBHs by $z=0$.

 - **Abstract**
 The local universe is still full of hidden dwarf galaxies to be discovered using deep imaging campaigns. Here we present the third paper in a series to search for low-surface brightness dwarf galaxies around nearby isolated luminous host galaxies with the Subaru Hyper Suprime Camera. Based on visual inspection, we found 11, 0, 4, and 6 dwarf galaxy candidates around M106, NGC2903, NGC3521, and UGCA127, respectively. This adds to the 40 candidates around M104 and 4 candidates around NGC2683 found in the previous papers. Artificial galaxy experiments show that we are complete down to a mean effective surface brightness of 26 mag/arcsec$^2$. The new dwarf galaxy candidates follow known scaling relation in size, surface brightness and luminosity, making them good candidates based on their morphology and photometric properties. We trace the luminosity function of these galaxies down to magnitude of $\approx-$9 in the V band for all galaxies targeted in our survey footprint so far. While the most massive galaxy (M104) has a significant higher abundance of dwarfs, NGC3521, NGC2903, and NGC2683 have a similar luminosity function as the Milky Way. These latter three galaxies also have a similar stellar mass and might be considered Milky Way analogs. UGCA127 is a low-mass galaxy but almost reaches the same number of dwarfs as the Milky Way at our limiting magnitude. We have searched for hints of lopsidedness in the satellite distributions, but found none to be significant. The next step will be to confirm these members through either distance or velocity measurements.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the effects of Bumblebee gravity on the propagation of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) using astrophysical sources modeled in the Unger-Farrar-Anchordoqui (UFA) framework (2015), which includes star formation rate (SFR), gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), and active galactic nuclei (AGN). We compute the density enhancement factor for various source separation distances ($d_\text{s}$s) up to 100 Mpc within the Bumblebee gravity scenario. Additionally, we calculate the CRs flux and their suppression, comparing the results with observational data from the Pierre Auger Observatory (PAO) and the Telescope Array through $\chi^2$ and $\chi_\text{red}^2$ analysis for the flux and Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm for suppression. The anisotropy in CRs arrival directions is examined, with corresponding $\chi^2$ and $\chi_\text{red}^2$ values obtained from the PAO surface detector data (SD 750 and SD 1500). Finally, we present skymaps of flux and anisotropy under different model assumptions, providing insights into the observational signatures of UHECRs in Bumblebee gravity. Our results show that increasing the Bumblebee gravity parameter $l$ enhances the density factor $\xi$, particularly at low energies, highlighting Lorentz violation's impact on CRs' propagation. Larger $d_\text{s}$ values amplify deviations from the $\Lambda$CDM model, with AGN sources dominating at high energies and GRB/SFR sources at lower energies. The skymaps indicate the structured flux patterns at large $d_\text{s}$ and structured anisotropy at higher energies.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new radio continuum study of the Large Magellanic Cloud supernova remnant (SNR) MC SNR J0519-6902. With a diameter of ~8 pc, this SNR shows a radio ring-like morphology with three bright regions toward the north, east, and south. Its linear polarisation is prominent with average values of 5 +- 1% and 6 +- 1% at 5500 and 9000 MHz, and we find a spectral index of -0.62 +- 0.02 , typical of a young SNR. The average rotation measure is estimated at -124 +- 83 rad m-2 and the magnetic field strength at ~11 muG. We also estimate an equipartition magnetic field of 72 +- 5 muG and minimum explosion energy of Emin = 2.6x1048 erg. Finally, we identified an H I cloud that may be associated with MC SNR J0519-6902, located in the southeastern part of the remnant, along with a potential wind-bubble cavity.

 - **Abstract**
 Star formation is a series of mass assembly processes and starless cores, those cold and dense condensations in molecular clouds, play a pivotal role as initial seeds of stars. With only a limited sample of known starless cores, however, the origin and growth of such stellar precursors had not been well characterized previously. Meanwhile, the recent discovery of CH$_3$OH emission, which is generally associated with desorbed icy mantle in warm regions, particularly at the periphery of starless cores also remains puzzling. We present sensitive ALMA (Band~3) observations (at 3~mm) toward a sample of newly identified starless cores in the Orion Molecular Cloud. The spatially resolved images distinctly indicate that the observed CH$_3$OH and N$_2$H$^+$ emission associated with these cores are morphologically anti-correlated and kinematically offset from each other. We postulate that the CH$_3$OH emission highlights the desorption of icy mantle by shocks resulting from gas piling onto dense cores in the filaments traced by N$_2$H$^+$. Our magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of star formation in turbulent clouds combined with radiative transfer calculations and imaging simulations successfully reproduced the observed signatures and reaffirmed the above scenario at work. Our result serves as an intriguing and exemplary illustration, a snapshot in time, of the dynamic star-forming processes in turbulent clouds. The results offer compelling insights into the mechanisms governing the growth of starless cores and the presence of gas-phase complex organic molecules associated with these cores.
#### The AstroSat UV Deep Field South. III. Evolution of the UV Luminosity Function and Luminosity Density from z~0.8-0.4

 - **Abstract**
 We characterise the rest-frame 1500 Å UV luminosity Function (UVLF) from deep AstroSat/UVIT F154W and N242W imaging in the Great Observatories Origins Survey South (GOODS-S) deep field. The UVLFs are constructed and subsequently characterised with fitted Schechter function parameters from FUV observations at z$<0.13$ and NUV observations in seven redshift bins in z~0.8-0.4. The UVLF slope ($\alpha$) and characteristic magnitude ($M^*$) are consistent with previous determinations for this redshift range based on AstroSat/UVIT GOODS-North observations, as well as with those from Galaxy evolution Explorer and Hubble Space Telescope observations. However, differences in the normalisation factor ($\phi_{*}$) are present for UVLFs for some redshift bins. We compute the UV luminosity density, $\rho_{\rm UV}$, combining our determined UVLF parameters with literature determinations out to z$\sim10$. The $\rho_{\rm UV}$ trend with redshift implies the rapid increase in cosmic star formation till its peak at z$\sim3$ (cosmic noon) followed by a slow decline till present day. Both the initial increase in cosmic star formation and subsequent decline are found to be more rapid than previous determinations.
#### Fast Baryonic Field Painting for Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Analyses: Transfer Function vs. Hybrid Effective Field Theory

 - **Abstract**
 We present two approaches for "painting" baryonic properties relevant to the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect - optical depth and Compton-$y$ - onto 3-dimensional $N$-body simulations, using the MillenniumTNG suite as a benchmark. The goal of these methods is to produce fast and accurate reconstruction methods to aid future analyses of baryonic feedback using the SZ effect. The first approach employs a Gaussian Process emulator to model the SZ quantities via a transfer function, while the second utilizes Hybrid Effective Field Theory (HEFT) to reproduce these quantities within the simulation. Our analysis involves comparing both methods to the true MillenniumTNG optical depth and Compton-$y$ fields using several metrics, including the cross-correlation coefficient, power spectrum, and power spectrum error. Additionally, we assess how well the reconstructed fields correlate with dark matter haloes across various mass thresholds. The results indicate that the transfer function method yields more accurate reconstructions for fields with initially high correlations ($r \approx 1$), such as between the optical depth and dark matter fields. Conversely, the HEFT-based approach proves more effective in enhancing correlations for fields with weaker initial correlations ($r \sim 0.5$), such as between the Compton-$y$ and dark matter fields. Lastly, we discuss extensions of our methods to improve the reconstruction performance at the field level.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Tracing wave activity from the photosphere to the corona has important implications for coronal heating and prediction of the solar wind. Despite extensive theory and simulations, the detection of waves in realistic MHD simulations still presents a large challenge due to wave interaction, mode conversion, and damping mechanisms. Aims. We conducted this study to detect localised wave activity within a realistic MHD simulation of the solar atmosphere by the Bifrost code. Methods. We present a new method of detecting the most significant contributions of wave activity within localised areas of the domain, aided by Discrete Fourier Transforms and frequency filtering. We correlate oscillations in the vertical & horizontal magnetic field, velocities parallel & perpendicular to the magnetic field, and pressure to infer the nature of the dominant wave modes. Results. Our method captures the most powerful frequencies and wavenumbers, as well as providing a new diagnostic for damping processes. We infer the presence of magnetoacoustic waves in the boundaries of prominent chromospheric/coronal swirling features. We find these waves are likely damped by viscous heating in the swirl boundaries, contributing to heating in the upper atmosphere. Conclusions. Using the most significant frequencies decomposition, we highlight that energy can be transported from the lower atmosphere to the upper atmosphere through waves and fluctuations along the swirl boundaries. Although further analysis is needed to confirm these findings, our new method provides a path forward to investigate wave activity in the solar atmosphere

 - **Abstract**
 Relativistic jets from supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei are amongst the most powerful phenomena in the universe, acting to regulate the growth of massive galaxies. Similar jets from stellar-mass black holes offer a chance to study the same phenomena on accessible observation time scales. However, such comparative studies across black hole masses and time scales remain hampered by the long-standing perception that stellar-mass black hole jets are in a less relativistic regime. We used radio interferometry observations to monitor the Galactic black hole X-ray binary 4U 1543-47 and discovered two distinct, relativistic ejections launched during a single outburst. Our measurements reveal a likely Lorentz factor of $\sim$ 8 and a minimum of 4.6 at launch with 95% confidence, demonstrating that stellar-mass black holes in X-ray binaries can launch jets as relativistic as those seen in active galactic nuclei.

 - **Abstract**
 It is established that there exists a direct link between the formation history of star cluster populations and their host galaxies, however, our lacking understanding of star cluster assembly prohibits us to make full use of their ability to trace galaxy evolution. In this work we introduce a new variation of the 2020 version of the semi-analytical galaxy formation model "L-Galaxies" that includes the formation of star clusters above 10^4 M_Sun and probes different physical assumptions that affect their evolution over cosmic time. We use properties of different galaxy components and localised star formation to determine the bound fraction of star formation in disks. After randomly sampling masses from an environmentally-dependent star cluster initial mass function, we assign to each object a half-mass radius, metallicity, and distance from the galaxy centre. We consider up to 2000 individual star clusters per galaxy and evolve their properties over time taking into account stellar evolution, two-body relaxation, tidal shocks, dynamical friction, and a re-positioning during galaxy mergers. Our simulation successfully reproduces several observational quantities, such as the empirical relationship between the absolute V -band magnitude of the brightest young star clusters and the host galaxy star formation rate, the mass function of young star clusters, or mean metallicities of the star cluster distributions versus galaxy masses. The simulation reveals great complexity in the z = 0 star cluster population resulting from differential destruction channels and origins, including in-situ populations in the disk, a major merger-induced heated component in the halo, and accreted star clusters. Model variations point out the importance of e.g. the shape of the star cluster initial mass function or the relationship between the sound speed of cold gas and the star formation rate.
#### Activity-Induced Near-Infrared Variability at 29P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 1, 2017-2022

 - **Abstract**
 29P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 1 (SW1) is both the first-discovered active Centaur and the most outburst-prone comet known. The nature of SW1's many outbursts, which regularly brighten the comet by five magnitudes or more, and what processes power them has been of particular interest since SW1's discovery in the 1920s. In this paper, we present and model four epochs of low-resolution near-infrared spectroscopy of SW1 taken with the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility and Lowell Discovery Telescope between 2017 and 2022. This dataset includes one large outburst, two periods of low activity ("quiescence" or "quiescent activity"), and one mid-sized outburst a few days after one of the quiescent observations. The two quiescent epochs appear similar in both spectral slope and modeled grain size distributions, but the two outbursts are significantly different. We propose that the two can be reconciled if smaller dust grains are accelerated more than larger ones, such that observations closer to the onset of an outburst are more sensitive to the finer-grained dust on the outside of the expanding cloud of material. These outbursts can thus appear very rapid but there is still a period in which the dust and gas are well-coupled. We find no strong evidence of water ice absorption in any of our spectra, suggesting that the areal abundance of ice-dominated grains is less than one percent. We conclude with a discussion of future modeling and monitoring efforts which might be able to further advance our understanding of this object's complicated activity patterns.

 Observations have established that coherent radio emission from pulsars arise at few hundred kilometers above stellar surface. Recent polarization studies have further demonstrated that plasma instabilities are necessary for charge bunching that gives rise to coherent emission. The formation of charged solitons in the electron-positron plasma is the only known bunching mechanism that can be realised at these heights. More than five decades of observations have revealed a number of emission features that should emerge from any valid radio emission mechanism. We have carried out numerical calculations to find the features of average emission from curvature radiation due to charged solitons. The characteristic curvature radiation spectrum has been updated from the well known one-dimensional dependence into a general two-dimensional form, and contribution from each soliton along observer's line of sight (LOS) has been added to reproduce the pulsar emission. The outflowing plasma is formed by sparking discharges above the stellar surface that are located within concentric rings resembling the core-cone emission beam, and uniform distribution of solitons along any LOS has been assumed. The observed effects of radius to frequency mapping, where the lower frequency emission originates from higher altitudes, is seen in this setup. The power law spectrum and relative steepening of the core spectra with respect to the cones also emerges. The estimated polarization position angle reflects the geometrical configuration of pulsars as expected. These studies demonstrate the efficacy of coherent curvature radiation from charged solitons to reproduce the average observational features of pulsars.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical simulations of the common-envelope interaction revealed the self-consistent formation of bipolar magnetically driven outflows launched from a toroidal structure resembling a circumbinary disk. So far, the dynamical impact of bipolar outflows on the common-envelope phase remains uncertain and we aim to quantify its importance. We illustrate the impact on common-envelope evolution by comparing two simulations -- one with magnetic fields and one without -- using the three-dimensional moving-mesh hydrodynamics code AREPO. We focus on the specific case of a $10 M_\odot$ red supergiant star with a $5 M_\odot$ black hole companion. By the end of the magnetohydrodynamic simulations (after $\sim 1220$ orbits of the core binary system), about $6.4 \%$ of the envelope mass is ejected via the bipolar outflow, contributing to angular momentum extraction from the disk structure and core binary. The resulting enhanced torques reduce the final orbital separation by about $24 \%$ compared to the hydrodynamical scenario, while the overall envelope ejection remains dominated by recombination-driven equatorial winds. We analyze field amplification and outflow launching mechanisms, confirming consistency with earlier studies: magnetic fields are amplified by shear flows, and outflows are launched by a magneto-centrifugal process, supported by local shocks and magnetic pressure gradients. These outflows originate from $\sim 1.1$ times the orbital separation. We conclude that the magnetically driven outflows and their role in the dynamical interaction are a universal aspect, and we further propose an adaptation of the $\alpha_\mathrm{CE}$-formalism by adjusting the final orbital energy with a factor of $1+ M_\mathrm{out}/\mu$, where $M_\mathrm{out}$ is the mass ejected through the outflows and $\mu$ the reduced mass of the core binary.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of several gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) that are temporally and spatially compatible with energetic supernovae (hypernovae) has established their common origin. In one case (GRB 111209A/SN 2011kl) the associated supernova was classified as superluminous (SN 2011kl). The exceptional duration of the observed gamma-ray prompt emission of GRB 111209A (about 7 hours) is widely considered key to unlocking the physics behind the still mysterious origin of superluminous supernovae (SLSNe). We review the main observational and theoretical findings that may link some ultra-long GRBs to SLSNe. Specifically, we examine notable events, the role of progenitors and host galaxies in shaping these phenomena, and focus on the proposed models. While a magnetar central engine is a plausible mechanism for both luminous and long-duration GRBs, a conclusive answer remains elusive, as alternative explanations are still viable. Further observational and theoretical work is required to clarify progenitor pathways and explosion mechanisms, potentially extending the classical GRB-SN connection to rare superluminous hypernovae.

 - **Abstract**
 GW170817 is the first binary neutron star merger detected with gravitational and electromagnetic waves, and its afterglow is still detectable 7 years post-merger. Some previous studies of the X-ray afterglow have claimed the onset of a new afterglow component or raised concerns about the data processing techniques. Motivated thus, we present here a reanalysis of X-ray afterglow data for GW170817 and find potential sources of discrepancies between the data reduction techniques employed by various research groups. We also analyze the updated panchromatic afterglow data to find that there is no significant evidence for any new afterglow component (e.g. due to the ejecta that gave rise to the kilonova) and that the jet must be still in a mildly relativistic phase. The decline in the afterglow light curve is significantly shallower compared to that expected from the standard synchrotron afterglow jet models with sideways spreading, indicating either an additional energy injection at late times or the velocity dependence on the microphysics parameters. In this context, we discuss the implications of the late time afterglow data on jet dynamics.
