#### Tracing the cosmological origin of gas that fuels in situ star formation in TNG50 galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 Based on their cosmological origin, the stars of a galaxy can be divided into two categories: those that enter through merger events (ex situ) and those born in the main progenitor (in situ). We used the TNG50 cosmological magnetohydrodynamical simulation and its Lagrangian tracer particles to explore and quantify the origin of gas that ultimately forms the in situ stars of galaxies. We tracked back the baryonic mass contributing to the $z=0$ in situ stellar populations of galaxies, studying trends in mass from dwarfs to group-scale halos. We find that more massive halos acquire this matter earlier than lower-mass halos, reflecting an overall earlier assembly of their in situ stellar mass. Defining the Lagrangian half-mass radius R$_{\rm L, 1/2}$ of a galaxy as the distance containing half of the mass that will form its in situ stars by $z=0$, we find that R$_{\rm L, 1/2}$ is larger for more massive halos at early times, reflecting larger "in situ Lagrangian regions." However, the dependence of this radius on halo mass becomes flat at $z \simeq 3$ and then inverts toward $z=0$. In addition, R$_{\rm L, 1/2}$ increases rapidly with redshift, surpassing the virial radii of halos at $z \sim 2$. This marks the cosmic epoch at which most of the gas that eventually forms the in situ stars of galaxies leaves the intergalactic medium (IGM) and enters halos, a transition that occurs earlier for more massive halos. The formation redshift of the in situ stellar component increases with halo mass, while the formation redshift of the dark matter halo decreases, indicative of a differential assembly history between these two components. Finally, we decomposed the $z=0$ in situ stellar mass into its distinct modes of accretion. Smooth accretion from the IGM is the most important for low-mass galaxies, while mergers and satellite-stripped gas become relevant and even dominant only for high-mass galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 The integral-field unit mode of the Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec+IFU) mounted on the James Webb Space Telescope has now enabled kinematic studies of smaller and less massive compact stellar systems in which to search for central massive black holes (BHs) than ever before. We present here the first such detection using NIRSpec+IFU in its highest resolution (R~2700) mode. We report a $3\sigma$ detection of a central black hole with mass ${\cal M}_{BH}=2.2\pm1.1\times10^6\,M_\odot$ in UCD736 orbiting within the Virgo galaxy cluster based on Schwarzschild's modeling of the 1D kinematic profile. The presence of such a massive BH strongly argues against a globular cluster origin of this UCD, and rather suggests a tidally stripped formation route from a former $\gtrsim10^9\,M_\odot$ dwarf galaxy host. Two other methods produce results consistent with Schwarzschild's modelling, but can only provide upper-limits on ${\cal M}_{BH}$. This represents the detection of a BH in the most compact ($r_h\approx15\,{\rm pc}$) stellar system to date, with a ${\cal M}_{BH}$ corresponding to ~9 percent of the system's stellar mass, roughly in line with previously reported UCD BH detections and comparable to the BH detected in the compact elliptical galaxy NGC4486B.

 - **Abstract**
 The Einstein Telescope (ET), a proposed next-generation gravitational wave (GW) observatory, will expand the reach of GW astronomy of stellar-mass compact object binaries to unprecedented distances, enhancing opportunities for multi-messenger observations. Here we investigate multi-messenger emission properties of binary neutron star (NSNS) and black hole-neutron star (BHNS) mergers detectable by ET, providing projections to optimize observational strategies and maximize scientific insights from these sources. Using a synthetic population of compact binary mergers, we model each source's GW signal-to-noise ratio, sky localization uncertainty, kilonova (KN) light curves in optical and near-infrared bands, fluence of the relativistic jet gamma-ray burst (GRB) prompt emission and afterglow light curves across radio, optical, X-ray and very high energy wavelengths. We analyze multi-messenger detectability prospects for ET as a standalone observatory with two different configurations and within a network of next-generation GW detectors. ET will detect over $10^4$ NSNS mergers annually, enabling potential observation of tens to hundreds of electromagnetic (EM) counterparts. BHNS mergers have more limited multi-messenger prospects, but joint GW-EM rates will increase by an order of magnitude compared to current-generation instruments. We quantify uncertainties due to the NS equation of state (EoS) and mass distribution of NSNSs, as well as the NS EoS and BH spin for BHNSs. While a single ET will achieve an impressive GW detection rate, the fraction of well-localized events is orders of magnitude lower than in a network with additional detectors. This significantly limits efficient EM follow-up and science cases requiring well-characterized counterparts or early observations. The challenge is even greater for BHNS mergers due to their low EM rate.

 - **Abstract**
 [Abridged] Recent JWST observations have revealed an intricate filamentary network of unshocked ejecta in the young supernova remnant (SNR) Cassiopeia A (Cas A), offering new insights into supernova (SN) explosions and ejecta evolution. We investigate the origin and evolution of this structure by (i) characterizing its 3D morphology and kinematics and (ii) identifying the physical mechanisms driving its formation. Using high-resolution hydrodynamic (HD) and magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations, we model the evolution of a neutrino-driven SN from explosion to a remnant age of 1000 years. The initial conditions, set just after shock breakout, are based on a 3D neutrino-driven SN model matching Cas A's basic properties. We find that magnetic fields have little impact on unshocked ejecta evolution, so we focus on HD simulations. A web-like filamentary structure, consistent with JWST observations (down to $\sim 0.01$ pc), naturally forms during the explosion. These filaments arise from early post-collapse processes, including neutrino-heated bubble expansion, hydrodynamic instabilities during blast propagation, and the Ni-bubble effect after shock breakout. The reverse shock later disrupts the filaments via hydrodynamic instabilities, rendering them unobservable by $\sim 700$ years. Our models suggest that JWST-detected filaments in Cas A preserve a 'memory' of early explosion conditions, tracing processes active during and immediately after the SN event. Notably, a filamentary network akin to Cas A's emerges naturally from a neutrino-driven SN explosion.
#### Their currents turn awry, and lose the name of action. I: Fundamental limits to orbit reconstruction due to non-conservation of stellar actions

 - **Abstract**
 The conservation of stellar actions is a fundamental assumption in orbit reconstruction studies in the Milky Way. However, the disc is highly dynamic, with time-dependent, non-axisymmetric features like transient spiral arms and giant molecular clouds (GMCs) driving local fluctuations in the gravitational potential on top of the near-axisymmetric background. Using high-resolution magnetohydrodynamic simulations that incorporate gas dynamics and star formation, we quantify the rate at which these effects drive non-conservation of the actions of young stars from Myr to Gyr timescales. We find that action evolution is well described as a logarithmic random walk, with vertical action evolving more rapidly than radial action; the diffusion rate associated with this random walk is weakly dependent on the stellar birth environment and scales approximately linearly with the galactic orbital frequency at a star's position. The diffusion rates we measure imply a fundamental limit of $\sim 100$ Myr as the timescale over which stellar orbits can be reliably reconstructed using methods that assume action conservation. By comparing diffusion rates for younger stars to those measured for an older and more vertically-extended control population, we conclude that radial action evolution is driven primarily by transient spiral arms, while vertical action evolution is driven by gravitational scattering off gaseous structures. Our results have significant implications for galactic archaeology and disc dynamics studies, necessitating a closer look at the timescales over which actions are assumed to be conserved in the disc.

 - **Abstract**
 The physical origins of the diverse emission-line asymmetries observed in the spectra of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) remain incompletely understood. Monitoring the temporal variations of line profiles offers a promising approach to investigating the underlying physics. In this study, we present an analysis of the broad H$\beta$ emission line profiles of eight AGNs observed from the end of 2016 to May 2023 as part of the reverberation mapping campaign titled "Monitoring AGNs with H$\beta$ Asymmetry" (MAHA), utilizing data obtained from the Wyoming Infrared Observatory (WIRO) 2.3-meter telescope. We measure the temporal variations of line asymmetry, width, and central velocity shift for the eight objects. Our findings reveal that the variation in asymmetry is positively correlated with H$\beta$ flux in five of the eight objects, while the remaining objects exhibit negative or complex correlations. Furthermore, we observe anti-correlations between line width and H$\beta$ flux for most objects, indicating the presence of the "breathing" phenomenon in their H$\beta$ emission lines. In contrast, two objects demonstrate an "anti-breathing" phenomenon or complex behavior. We discuss the physical origins of the temporal variations in line profiles and propose the possibility of decomposing the variations in H$\beta$ asymmetry and width into components: one that corresponds to short-term variations in H$\beta$ flux and another that reflects long-term variations in continuum light curves, perhaps driven by radiation pressure.

 - **Abstract**
 This review talk explores the diverse outcomes of white dwarf mergers, emphasising that not all double degenerate mergers result in supernovae. Possible outcomes include the formation of a more massive WD, partial explosions that leave behind unusual remnants, and merger-induced collapse leading to the formation of rapidly spinning neutron stars or magnetars. Additionally, merging WDs have been proposed as potential progenitors for long gamma-ray bursts and Fast Radio Bursts.

 - **Abstract**
 We present Surveying the Whirlpool at Arcseconds with NOEMA (SWAN), a high-resolution, high-sensitivity survey to map molecular lines in the 3mm band in M51 (the Whirlpool galaxy). SWAN has obtained the largest high-sensitivity map (5x7 kpc2) of N2H+ emission at cloud-scale resolution (3" ~125 pc) in an external galaxy to date. We describe the observations and data reduction of ~214 hours of interferometric data from NOEMA, ~55 hours of tailored new observations with the IRAM-30m telescope and the combination of NOEMA, new and ~14 hours of archival 30m observations. We detect widespread emission from 9 molecular transition lines. The J=1-0 transitions of CO isotopologues 13CO and C18O are detected at high significance across the full observed field-of-view (FoV). HCN, HNC, HCO+, and N2H+(1-0) are detected in the center, molecular ring and spiral arms of the galaxy, while the shock tracer HNCO(4-3), (5-4) and PDR tracer C2H(1-0) are detected in the central ~1 kpc and molecular ring only. For most of the lines that we detect, average line ratios with respect to CO are increased by up to a factor of ~3 in the central 1 kpc, where an AGN and its low-inclination outflow are present, compared to the disk. Across the full SWAN FoV, 13CO, C18O, HCN, HNC, HCO+ and N2H+ are 8\pm2, 29\pm6, 17\pm3,37\pm5, 26\pm5 and 63\pm38 times fainter than 12CO, respectively, in pixels where each line is significantly detected. Although we observe variations in line ratios between larger-scale environments like the center and disk of M51, the scatter within each environment also indicates the influence of smaller-scale processes. The ability to measure these effects is only possible thanks to the high resolution and high sensitivity of the SWAN dataset across multiple environments. This provides the sharpest view of these molecular transitions over the largest physical area ever captured in an external galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 The effect of tidal forces on transport within a relic accretion disk in binary black holes is studied here with a suite of two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations. As the binary contracts due to the emission of gravitational waves, the accretion disk is truncated, and a two-armed spiral wave is excited, which remains stationary in the rotating reference frame of the coalescing binary. Such spiral waves lead to increased transport of mass and angular momentum. Our findings suggest that even in the case of weakly ionized accretion disks, spiral density waves will drain the disk long before the orbit of the two black holes decays enough for them to merge, thus dimming prospects for a detectable electromagnetic counterpart.

 - **Abstract**
 $\gamma$ Persei is a long-period ($P \approx 14.6$ yr) eclipsing binary system. Its period makes it a difficult target to fully understand: so far, only two primary eclipses are known in the literature, from 1990 and from 2019, whereas the 2005 one was missed due to its closeness to the Sun at the time. We aimed to fill in this gap by processing the quasi-continuous photometry collected by the Solar Mass Ejection Imager (SMEI) between 2003 and 2011, which was ideally positioned to observe such a bright targets. In order to do that, we first determined a color-dependent conversion formula from the SMEI measurements into {\it Gaia} \textit{G} magnitudes. We applied various corrections to the photometry and provide the longest continuous light curve of $\gamma$ Persei. We successfully detected the 2005 primary eclipse of the system, with the yearly observations ending during the egress of the companion. We predicted the position of a possible secondary eclipse by forward modeling the binary system with PHOEBE, and successfully recovered the secondary eclipse in the 2006 SMEI observations. The existence of the secondary eclipse puts strong constraints on the orbital configuration, which will be an important constraint for future studies of the system.

 - **Abstract**
 On electron kinetic scales, ions and electrons decouple, and electron velocity shear on electron inertial length $\sim d_e$ can trigger electromagnetic (EM) electron Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (EKHI). In this paper, we present an analytic study of EM EKHI in an inviscid collisionless plasma with a step-function electron shear flow. We show that in incompressible collisionless plasma the ideal electron frozen-in condition $\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v}_e \times \mathbf{B}/c = 0$ must be broken for the EM EKHI to occur. In a step-function electron shear flow, the ideal electron frozen-in condition is replaced by magnetic flux conservation, i.e., $\nabla \times (\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v}_e\times \mathbf{B}/c) = 0$, resulting in a dispersion relation similar to that of the standard ideal and incompressible magnetohydrodynamics KHI. The magnetic field parallel to the electron streaming suppresses the EM EKHI due to magnetic tension. The threshold for the EM mode of the EKHI is $(\mathbf{k}\cdot\Delta\mathbf{U}_e)^2>\frac{n_{e1}+n_{e2}}{n_{e1} n_{e2}}[n_{e1}(\mathbf{v}_{Ae1}\cdot\mathbf{k})^2+n_{e2}(\mathbf{v}_{Ae2}\cdot\mathbf{k})^2]$, where $\mathbf{v}_{Ae} =\mathbf{B}/(4\pi m_e n_e)^{1/2}$, $\Delta\mathbf{U}_e$ and $n_e$ are the electron streaming velocity shear and densities, respectively. The growth rate of the EM mode is $\gamma_{em} \sim \Omega_{ce}$, the electron gyro-frequency.

 - **Abstract**
 A classical nova is a thermonuclear runaway initiated on a white dwarf accreting solar-like material from its stellar companion. Once the white dwarf accretes enough mass, the pressure at the base of the accreted layer reaches a critical point, leading to the ignition of the hydrogen fuel at their interface. This paper presents a set of two-dimensional CO classical nova simulations with an extended buffer zone of a fixed low density and temperature between the top of the accreted layer and the upper boundary, allowing us to capture the thermonuclear outburst in the domain. Our domain reduces the role of the upper-outflow boundary condition that has affected previous simulations and allows us to explore the nucleosynthesis evolution in detail. We also study the effects of the initial temperature perturbation and buffer size to explore their sensitivity in our simulations. Finally, we start our simulations with a lower temperature at the base of the accreted layer ($7\times 10^7\,\mathrm{K}$) than previous work, allowing us to capture mixing earlier in the evolution, reducing the effects of the mixing-length-theory assumptions. This allows for a more realistic description of convective transport in our models.

 We describe updated scientific goals for the wide-field, millimeter-wave survey that will be produced by the Simons Observatory (SO). Significant upgrades to the 6-meter SO Large Aperture Telescope (LAT) are expected to be complete by 2028, and will include a doubled mapping speed with 30,000 new detectors and an automated data reduction pipeline. In addition, a new photovoltaic array will supply most of the observatory's power. The LAT survey will cover about 60% of the sky at a regular observing cadence, with five times the angular resolution and ten times the map depth of Planck. The science goals are to: (1) determine the physical conditions in the early universe and constrain the existence of new light particles; (2) measure the integrated distribution of mass, electron pressure, and electron momentum in the late-time universe, and, in combination with optical surveys, determine the neutrino mass and the effects of dark energy via tomographic measurements of the growth of structure at $z < 3$; (3) measure the distribution of electron density and pressure around galaxy groups and clusters, and calibrate the effects of energy input from galaxy formation on the surrounding environment; (4) produce a sample of more than 30,000 galaxy clusters, and more than 100,000 extragalactic millimeter sources, including regularly sampled AGN light-curves, to study these sources and their emission physics; (5) measure the polarized emission from magnetically aligned dust grains in our Galaxy, to study the properties of dust and the role of magnetic fields in star formation; (6) constrain asteroid regoliths, search for Trans-Neptunian Objects, and either detect or eliminate large portions of the phase space in the search for Planet 9; and (7) provide a powerful new window into the transient universe on time scales of minutes to years, concurrent with observations from Rubin of overlapping sky.
#### Linking Critical Heights in Solar Active Regions with 3D CME Speeds: Insights from Automated and Manual PIL Detection Methods

 - **Abstract**
 In a space weather context, the most geoeffective coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are fast CMEs from Earth-facing solar active regions. These CMEs are difficult to characterize in coronagraph data due to their high speed (fewer observations), faintness, Earthward orientation (halo CMEs), and disruptions from associated high-energy particle storms. Any diagnostic aiding in early CME speed identification is valuable. This study investigates whether the 3D speeds of 37 CMEs are correlated with the critical heights of their source regions, to test the hypothesis that if the critical height is located at a higher altitude in the corona, the weaker magnetic field environment will enable a faster CME to be produced. Critical heights near CME onset are calculated by identifying polarity inversion lines (PIL) in magnetogram data using automated and manual methods. 3D speeds are determined by fitting a Graduated Cylindrical Shell (GCS) model to multi-viewpoint coronagraph images. For the automated method, we find a high correlation of 71% +- 8% between CME speed and critical height, dropping to 48% +- 12% when using CME plane-of-sky speeds, on which most previous similar studies are based. An attempt to improve the critical height diagnostic through manual PIL selection yields a lower correlation of 58% +/- 13%. The higher correlation from the automated method suggests that encompassing the full PIL structure is a better measure of the magnetic conditions that influence CME dynamics. Our results highlight the potential for critical height as a continuously computable diagnostic for forecasting the 3D speeds of Earth-directed CMEs.
#### How the CME on 21 April 2023 Triggered the First Severe Geomagnetic Storm of Solar Cycle 25

 - **Abstract**
 The first severe (G4) geomagnetic storm of Solar Cycle 25 occurred on 23-24 April 2023, following the arrival of a Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) on 23 April. The characteristics of this CME, measured from coronagraphs (speed and mass), did not indicate that it would trigger such an intense geomagnetic storm. In this work, our aim is to understand why this CME led to such a geoeffective outcome. Our analysis spans from the source active region to the corona and inner heliosphere through 1 au using multiwavelength, multi-viewpoint remote sensing observations and in situ data. We find that rotation and possibly deflection of the CME resulted in an axial magnetic field nearly parallel to the ecliptic plane during the Earth encounter, which might explain the storm's severity. Additionally, we find that imaging away from the Sun-Earth line is crucial in hindcasting the CME Time-of-Arrival at Earth. The position (0.39 au) and detailed images from the SoloHI telescope onboard the Solar Orbiter mission, in combination with SOHO and STEREO images, helped decisively with the three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of the CME.

 - **Abstract**
 Human living environment is influenced by intense solar activity. The solar activity exhibits periodicity and regularity. Although many deep-learning models are currently used for solar cycle prediction, most of them are based on a multi-step pattern. In this paper a solar cycle prediction method based on a one-step pattern is proposed with the TCN neural network model, in which a number of historical data are input, and only one value is predicted at a time. Through an autoregressive strategy, this predicted value is added to the input sequence to generate the next output. This process is iterated until the prediction of multiple future data. The experiments were performed on the 13-month smoothed monthly total sunspot number data sourced from WDC-SILSO. The results showed that one-step pattern fits the solar cycles from 20-25 well. The average fitting errors are MAE=1.74, RMSE=2.34. Finally, the intensity of Solar Cycle 25 was predicted with one-step pattern. The peak will occur in 2024 October with a magnitude of 135.3 and end in 2030 November. By comparing the prediction results with other methods, our method are more reasonable and better than the most methods.

 - **Abstract**
 In this manuscript, based on SDSS photometry and spectroscopy, a method is proposed to test the hypothesis that the orbital kinematics of kpc-scale dual-core systems can lead to double-peaked narrow emission lines (DPNELs), through analyzing a sample of seven kpc-scale dual-core systems by comparing the upper limits of their orbital velocities (calculated using total stellar mass and projected distance) with the velocity separation of DPNELs (peak separation). To determine accurate total stellar masses, GALFIT is applied to consider the effects of the overlapping components on the photometric images to obtain accurate magnitudes. Then, based on the correlation between absolute Petrosian magnitudes and total stellar masses, the individual masses of the galaxies are determined. Therefore, the maximum orbital velocities can be calculated by combining the projected distance. Meanwhile, the peak separation can be accurately measured after subtracting the pPXF determined host galaxy contributions. Finally, four objects exhibit peak separations almost consistent with their respective maximum orbital velocities under the assumption of a circular orbit, while the remaining three objects display peak separations larger than the maximum orbital velocities. A larger sample will be given later to further test whether DPNELs can arise from kpc-scale dual-core systems.

 - **Abstract**
 We present so far the highest resolution ($\sim$0.04") ALMA 1.3 mm continuum observations of three massive star-forming clumps in the Central Molecular Zone, namely 20 km s$^{-1}$ C1, 20 km $^{-1}$ C4, and Sgr C C4, which reveal prevalent compact millimeter emission. We extract the compact emission with $\textit{astrodendro}$ and identify a total of 199 fragments with a typical size of $\sim$370 AU, which represent the first sample of candidates of protostellar envelopes and disks and kernels of prestellar cores in these clumps that are likely forming star clusters. Compared with the protoclusters in the Galactic disk, the three protoclusters display a higher level of hierarchical clustering, likely a result of the stronger turbulence in the CMZ clumps. Compared with the mini-starbursts in the CMZ, Sgr B2 M and N, the three protoclusters also show stronger subclustering in conjunction with a lack of massive fragments. The efficiency of high-mass star formation of the three protoclusters is on average one order of magnitude lower than that of Sgr B2 M and N, despite a similar overall efficiency of converting gas into stars. The lower efficiency of high-mass star formation in the three protoclusters is likely attributed to hierarchical cluster formation.

 - **Abstract**
 HD 45166 was recently reported to be a long-period binary comprising a B7V star and a highly magnetic ($\langle B \rangle = 43.0\pm0.5\,$kG) hot Wolf-Rayet-like component, dubbed as a quasi Wolf-Rayet (qWR) star in literature. While originally proposed to be a short-period binary, long-term spectroscopic monitoring suggested a 22.5 yr orbital period. With a derived dynamical mass of $2.03\pm0.44\,M_\odot$, the qWR component is the most strongly magnetized non-degenerate object ever detected and a potential magnetar progenitor. However, the long period renders the spectroscopic orbital solution and dynamical mass estimates uncertain, casting doubts on whether the qWR component is massive enough to undergo core-collapse. Here, we spatially resolve the HD 45166 binary using newly acquired interferometric data obtained with the GRAVITY instrument of the Very Large Telescope Interferometer. Due to the calibrator star being a binary as well, we implement a new approach for visibility calibration and test it thoroughly using archival GRAVITY data. The newly calibrated HD 45166 data reveal the unmistakable presence of a companion to the qWR component with an angular separation of $10.9\pm0.1$ mas (which translates to a projected physical separation of $10.8\pm0.4$ au), consistent with the long-period orbit. We obtain a model-independent qWR mass $M_{\rm qWR} = 1.96^{+0.74}_{-0.54}\,M_\odot$ using interferometric and spectroscopic data together. This observation robustly confirms that HD 45166 is truly a long-period binary, and provides an anchor point for accurate mass determination of the qWR component with further observations.

 - **Abstract**
 JWST has revealed a population of broad-line active galactic nuclei at $z>4$ with remarkably red colors, so-called "Little Red Dots." Ubiquitous Balmer breaks suggest that they harbor old stellar populations in massive, compact host galaxies. We present ALMA observations of three LRDs at $z=3.10$, $4.46$, and $7.04$, targeting molecular and neutral gas via CO(7-6) and [CI](2-1), respectively. We do not detect CO in any target, placing conservative limits on the host molecular gas mass $\lesssim 1$-$5\times10^{10}$ M$_\odot$. We report the tentative ($4.9\sigma$) detection of the [CI](2-1) line in A2744-45924 ($z=4.46$), one of the brightest known LRDs. The [CI] line is narrow (FWHM $\sim 80$ km s$^{-1}$), implying a dynamical mass $\lesssim 10^{10}$ M$_\odot$, adopting conservative limits for the galaxy size. The dynamical mass limit is significantly lower than expected from the local $M_{\rm BH}$-$M_{\rm dyn}$ relation, and is an order of magnitude below the stellar mass derived from SED fitting, potentially supporting a non-stellar origin of the Balmer break. These results, while tentative, paint a picture of LRDs that is markedly different than typical high-$z$ quasars, which live in massive, gas-rich, and actively star-forming host galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 Aims. The orientation-based unification scheme of radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGNs) asserts that radio galaxies and quasars are essentially the same type of object, but viewed from different angles. To test this unification model, we compared the environments of radio galaxies and quasars, which would reveal similar properties when an accurate model is utilized. Methods. Using the second data release of the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS DR2), we constructed a sample of 26,577 radio galaxies and 2028 quasars at 0.08 < z < 0.4. For radio galaxies with optical spectra, we further classified them as 3631 low-excitation radio galaxies (LERGs) and 1143 high-excitation radio galaxies (HERGs). We crossmatched these samples with two galaxy cluster catalogs from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Results. We find that $17.1 \pm 0.2%$ of the radio galaxies and $4.1 \pm 0.4%$ of the quasars are associated with galaxy clusters. Luminous quasars are very rare in clusters, while $18.7 \pm 0.7%$ LERGs and $15.2 \pm 1.1%$ HERGs reside in clusters. We also note that in radio galaxies, both HERGs and LERGs tend to reside in the centers of clusters, while quasars do not show a strong preference for their positions in clusters. Conclusions. This study shows that local quasars and radio galaxies exist in different environments, challenging the orientation-based unification model. This means that factors other than orientation may play an important role in distinguishing radio galaxies from quasars. The future WEAVE-LOFAR survey will offer high-quality spectroscopic data for a large number of radio sources and allow for a more comprehensive exploration of the environments of radio galaxies and quasars.

 - **Abstract**
 Low-Luminosity Active Galactic Nuclei (LLAGN) provides a unique view of Comptonization and non-thermal emission from accreting black holes in the low-accretion rate regime. However, to decipher the exact nature of the Comptonizing corona in LLAGN, its geometry and emission mechanism must be understood beyond the limits of spectro-timing techniques. Spectro-polarimetry offers the potential to break the degeneracies between different coronal emission models. Compton-thin LLAGN provide an opportunity for such spectro-polarimetric exploration in the 2-8 keV energy range using IXPE. In this work, we carry out a spectro-polarimetric analysis of the first IXPE observation, in synergy with a contemporaneous NuSTAR observation, of an LLAGN: NGC 2110. Using 554.4 ks of IXPE data from October 2024, we constrain the 99% upper limit on the Polarization Degree (PD) to be less than 8.3% assuming the corresponding Polarization Angle (PA) to be aligned with the radio jet, and less than 3.6% if in the perpendicular direction. In the absence of a significant PD detection, the PA remains formally unconstrained, yet the polarization significance contours appear to be aligned with the radio jet, tentatively supporting models in which the corona is radially extended in the plane of the disk. We also carry out detailed Monte Carlo simulations using MONK and STOKES codes to test different coronal models against our results and compare the polarization properties between NGC 2110 and brighter Seyferts.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar-mass isolated black holes (IsoBHs) wandering in interstellar medium (ISM) are expected to be abundant in our Galaxy. Recently, an IsoBH, OGLE-2011-BLG-0462, was unambiguously discovered using astrometric microlensing. We examine prospects for detecting electromagnetic signatures from an accretion flow surrounding the IsoBH. The accretion rate onto the IsoBH should be highly sub-Eddington, which leads to formation of a hot accretion flow. In this paper, we evaluate the detectability of electromagnetic signals from the hot accretion flows in two accretion states: magnetically arrested disk (MAD) and classical radiatively inefficient accretion flows (RIAFs). For the MAD scenario, we find that the optical, infrared, and X-ray signals can be detectable by the current best facilities, such as HST, JWST, and Chandra, if the IsoBH is in a warm neutral medium. In contrast, for the classical RIAF scenario, the optical and X-ray emissions are weaker than MAD scenario, leading to unobservable signals for a typical parameter set. Future follow-up observations of OGLE-2011-BLG-0462 will provide a good test for theories of accretion processes.

 - **Abstract**
 It has always been believed that feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) has an important impact on star formation in massive galaxies. Black hole spin is an important physical parameter of AGN. We use a large sample of massive star-forming galaxies to study the effects of AGN on star formation. Our main results are as follows: (i) There are significant correlations between black hole spin and star formation rate, specific star formation rate, and star formation activity parameter for massive star-forming early-type and late-type galaxies, respectively. These results indicate that the spin of supermassive black holes regulates the star formation of massive star-forming early-type and late-type galaxies. (2) The slopes of the relationship between black hole spin and star formation rate, specific star formation rate, and star formation activity parameter for massive star-forming early-type galaxies and late-type galaxies are similar within the error range. These results imply that the mechanism of black hole spin regulating star formation may be similar in massive star-forming early-type and late-type galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the spectral and temporal properties of the black hole X-ray transient binary SLX 1746--331 during the 2023 outburst with NICER, NuSTAR, and Insight-HXMT observations. Through the joint fitting of the spectra from NICER, NuSTAR, and Insight-HXMT, the spin and inclination angles are measured for the first time as $0.85 \pm 0.03$ and $53\pm 0.5$\textdegree, respectively. Accordingly, the mass of the compact star is updated from the previous lower limit of 3.3$\pm 2.1 M_\odot$ to $5.5\pm 3.6 M_\odot$, which is consistent with $5.2 \pm 4.5M_\odot$ measured with an empirical mass-luminosity correlation of BH samples. With more NICER observations covering the later decay of the outburst, we confirm that the entire outburst was dominated by the disk emissions, and the thermal spectrum follows $F \propto T_{\rm in}^{3.974\pm 0.003}$, till a luminosity of over than two magnitudes lower than the maximum of the outburst.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent JWST observations towards Westerlund 1 revealed extensive nebular emission associated with the cluster. Given the age of the region and proximity of that material to massive stars it cannot be primordial star forming gas and the origin is uncertain. We aim to determine whether the nebular emission in Westerlund 1 could be due to ablation flows from Red Supergiant (RSG) stars embedded in the cluster wind driven by the Wolf-Rayet stars in the cluster core. We also aim to explore the efficiency of mass-loading for the RSG wind in this scenario. We use 3D hydrodynamic simulations with the \textsc{pion} code to study the interaction between the cluster and RSG winds. We compare with the JWST observations by generating synthetic dust-emission maps. We find that the ablation flow morphology is consistent with the observations towards Westerlund 1, with clumps and instabilities. Synthetic observations at 11 $\mu$m predict fluxes in the ablation flow of $\sim1000-6000$ MJy ster$^{-1}$ which is consistent with the unsaturated components of the JWST F1130W observations in the vicinity of the red supergiants in the region. This good agreement is achieved without any consideration of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which have a known 11.3 $\mu$m feature that appears in the F1130W band. This suggests that the ablation flow is PAH depleted. Ablation of RSG winds can explain the observed nebulosity in Westerlund 1, at least in the vicinity of the RSGs. Further observations are encouraged to enable detailed studies of these interactions.

 - **Abstract**
 Core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are the explosive end-points of stellar evolution for $M_{ZAMS} \gtrsim 8$ $M_\odot$ stars. The cores of these stars collapse to neutron stars, a process in which high neutrino luminosity drives off the overlying stellar layers, which get ejected with thousands of kilometers per second. These supernovae enrich their host galaxies with elements made both during the star's life and in the explosion, providing the main cosmic source of elements such as oxygen, neon and silicon. Their high luminosities ($\sim$ $10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at peak) make SNe beacons to large distances, and their light curves and spectra provide rich information on single and binary stellar evolution, nucleosynthesis, and a diverse set of high-energy physical processes. As the SN ejecta sweep up circumstellar and interstellar matter, it eventually enters a supernova remnant phase, exemplified by nearby, spatially resolved remnants such as Cas A and the Crab Nebula. In this phase, shocks and pulsar winds continue to light up the interior of the exploded stars, giving detailed information about their 3D structure. We review the central concepts of CCSNe, from the late stages of evolution of massive stars, through collapse, explosion, and electromagnetic display, to the final remnant phase. We briefly discuss still open questions, and current and future research avenues.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the observations of the radio shell of the supernova remnant (SNR) G310.6-1.6 at 943 MHz from the Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) and the Polarization Sky Survey of the Universe's Magnetism (POSSUM) surveys by using the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP). We detect polarized emission from the central pulsar wind nebula (PWN) with rotation measures varying from -696 rad m$^{-2}$ to -601 rad m$^{-2}$. We measure the integrated flux density of the shell to be 36.4 +/- 2.2 mJy at 943 MHz and derive a spectral index of -0.4 +/- 0.1 for the PWN and -0.7 +/- 0.3 for the SNR shell. From the combined radio and X-ray observations, the object can be identified as a supernova explosion of about 2500 yr ago with energy of about 1.3 x 10$^{50}$ erg, suggesting an ejected mass of about 10 M_sun. The circular radio shell outside the circular hard X-ray shell is unique among Galactic SNRs. We discuss several possible scenarios, including blast wave, reverse shock, and pulsar-fed emission, but find that none of them can fully explain the observed characteristics of the shell. This poses a challenge for understanding the evolution of SNRs. The results of this paper demonstrate the potential of the ASKAP EMU and POSSUM surveys in discovering more objects of small angular size and low surface brightness.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetars have inferred polar field strengths in excess of the Schwinger limit, where nonlinear electromagnetic effects can be significant. Their internal fields may be even stronger, suggesting that Maxwellian characterisations of hydromagnetic structure may require revision. A generalised Grad-Shafranov equation, describing static and axisymmetric fluid stars with mixed poloidal-toroidal fields, is introduced and subsequently solved in a perturbative scheme to calculate quadrupolar deformations. In the Born-Infeld theory, we show that the toroidal field has a maximum strength set by the scale parameter, $b$, implying an upper limit to the stellar prolateness, $|\epsilon_{\rm max}| \sim 10^{-5} \left(b/10^{16}\text{ G}\right)^2$, that is independent of field specifics. Observations of magnetar phenomena that are interpreted as evidence for ellipticity, such as precession, can thus implicitly constrain post-Maxwellian parameters in a way that complements terrestrial experiments. Toroidal ceilings also have implications for dynamo theory and gravitational waves, which we revisit together with field evolution in crusts abiding by beyond-Maxwell physics.

 - **Abstract**
 The magnitudes of the velocity kicks that neutron stars (NSs) obtain at their formation have long been a topic of discussion, with the latest studies analysing the velocities of young pulsars and favouring a bimodal kick distribution. In previous work, a novel method was proposed to determine kicks based on the eccentricity of Galactic trajectories. We applied this method to the isolated pulsars with known parallax in order to kinematically constrain the NS natal kick distribution and investigate its proposed bimodality. Since this method is applicable to older pulsars, we effectively increase the sample size with ${\sim}50\%$ compared to the pulsars younger than $10$ Myr. We assumed the velocity vectors of the pulsars to be distributed isotropically in the local standard of rest frame. These velocity vectors were used to trace back the trajectories of the NSs through the Galaxy and estimate their eccentricity. Then, we simulated kicked objects in order to evaluate the relationship between kick magnitude and Galactic eccentricity, which was used to infer the kicks corresponding to the estimated eccentricities. The resulting kick distributions indeed show a bimodal structure for young pulsars. However, for older pulsars the bimodality vanishes and instead we find a log-normal kick distribution peaking at ${\sim}200$ km/s and a median of ${\sim}400$ km/s. We therefore conclude that the natal kicks of these isolated NSs are best described by log-normal distribution with $\mu=6.38$ and $\sigma=1.01$. This analysis reveals no evidence for bimodality in the larger sample, and we suggest that the bimodality found by existing literature may be caused by Poisson noise due to their relatively small sample size.

 - **Abstract**
 The multi-messenger combination of gravitational waves (GWs) from merging massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) and the electromagnetic (EM) counterpart from the surrounding circumbinary disk (CBD) will open avenues to new scientific pursuits. In order to realize this science, we need to correctly localize the host galaxy of the merging MBHB. Multi-wavelength, time-dependent electromagnetic (EM) signatures can greatly facilitate the identification of the unique EM counterpart among many sources in LISA's localization volume. To this end, we studied merging unequal-mass MBHBs embedded in a CBD using high-resolution 2D simulations, with a $\Gamma$-law equation of state, incorporating viscous heating, shock heating and radiative cooling. We simulate each binary starting from before it decouples from the CBD until just after the merger. We compute EM signatures and identify distinct features before, during, and after the merger. We corroborate previous findings of a several order of magnitude drop in the thermal X-ray luminosity near the time of merger, but with delayed timing compared to an equal-mass system. The source remains X-ray dark for hours post-merger. Our main results are a potential new signature of a sharp spike in the thermal X-ray emission just before the tell-tale steep drop occurs. This feature may further help to identify EM counterparts of LISA's unequal MBHBs before merger without the need for extensive pre-merger monitoring. Additionally, we find a role-reversal, in which the primary out-accretes the secondary during late inspiral, which may diminish signatures originating from Doppler modulation.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the discovery of rare emergence (31 nights from 360 nights of observations) of narrow absorption features in hydrogen and helium lines in stationary SS433 spectra with velocities ranging from $-650$ to $-1900$ km/s. The components arise independently of the appearance of P-Cygni line profiles which are frequently observed in the SS433 stationary spectra with terminal velocities ranging from $-200$ to $\sim -2500$ km/s. The characteristic rising time of the transient absorptions is about one day and the decay time is about two days. The phenomenology of the absorptions suggests their origin due to hydrodynamic instabilities of wind outflows from a supercritical accretion disk in SS433.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent studies indicate that circumstellar disks exhibit weak turbulence, with their dynamics and evolution being primarily influenced by magnetic winds. However, most numerical studies have focused on planet-disk interactions in turbulent disk models. We aim to explore how wind-driven accretion affects the orbital and eccentricity evolution of a Jovian planet within a magnetized disk. Conversely, we seek to determine in what extent such a planet can modify the accretion behavior and the wind dynamics. We perform high-resolution 3D global non-ideal magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of a massive gap-carving planet interacting with a wind-launching disk, using the accelerated code IDEFIX. We consider the influence of the gap shape on planet migration by restarting a "fixed-planet" simulation at three different times, from which the planet evolves freely in the disk. For a strong initial magnetization and a sufficiently deep planet gap, we find that the planet becomes moderately eccentric, and its migration is slow, unsteady and mostly outward. This migration pattern is due to the gap's radial asymmetry which enhances the inner Lindblad torque while reducing the outer Lindblad torque. We show that eccentricity can grow up to 6-8% and is likely driven by a finite-amplitude instability triggered by first-order external Lindblad resonances. These moderate eccentricity values periodically modulate the gap accretion rate and wind mass loss rate, possibly leading to the formation of discrete structures in CO outflows. Slow outward migration and eccentricity growth appear to be common outcomes of planet-disk-wind interactions, which may contribute significantly to both the long orbital periods and the moderate eccentricities of warm jupiters. Additionally, eccentric massive protoplanets embedded in circumstellar disks could play a role in generating structured outflows.

 - **Abstract**
 We extend the survey for organics in the southern hemisphere by observing two cores in the Chamaeleon complex using NASA's Deep Space Network 70-m antenna in Canberra, Australia, over the frequency range of 18 to 25 GHz. We surveyed the class 0 protostar Cha-MMS1 and the prestellar core Cha-C2, which represent two stages in the evolution of dense cores. We detect several molecules including HC$_3$N, HC$_5$N, C$_4$H, CCS, C$_3$S, NH$_3$, and c-C$_3$H$_2$. A longer cyanopolyyne, HC$_7$N, is detected with high confidence via spectral stacking analysis. While molecular column densities in the two Chamaeleon cores are typically an order of magnitude lower compared to the cynaopolyyne peak in TMC-1, the molecular abundance ratios are in general agreement with the TMC-1 values. The two exceptions are c-C$_3$H$_2$, which is enhanced by a factor of \about 25 with respect to cyanopolyynes in the Chamaeleon cores, and ammonia, which is enhanced by a factor of ~ 125. The deuterated species c-C$_3$HD is detected in both cores, with a high D/H ratio of ~0.23 in c-C$_3$H$_2$. A rare isotopologue of ammonia, $^{15}$NH$_3$, is also detected in Cha-MMS1 suggesting a high $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N ratio of ~ 690 in ammonia. However, this ratio may be artificially enhanced due to the high optical depth of the $^{14}$NH$_3$ (1,1) line, which increases the effective source size. We use the detections of ammonia, cyanopolyynes, and far-infrared dust continuum to characterize the density and temperature in the Chamaeleon cores and calculate the molecular column densities and their relative ratios. The ring molecule benzonitrile is not detected in either Chamaeleon core. The $3 \sigma$ upper limits for its column density are a factor of 2 higher than the value derived for TMC-1 and the upper limits for its relative abundance with respect to HC$_5$N are a factor of 3 higher than the TMC-1 value.
