 - **Abstract**
 A wide range of phenomena, from explosive transients to active galactic nuclei, exhibit variability at radio wavelengths on timescales of a few years. Characterizing the rate and scale of variability in the radio sky can provide keen insights into dynamic processes in the Universe, such as accretion mechanics, jet propagation, and stellar evolution. We use data from the first two epochs of the Very Large Array Sky Survey to conduct a census of the variable radio sky. Approximately $3,600$ objects are found to significantly vary in brightness during the $\sim2.5\,$ years between observations. For compact sources whose mean flux density across the two epochs, $\mu_{S}$, is brighter than $20\,$mJy, $\approx 5\,$% show brightness variations $>30\,$%, rising to $\approx 9\,$% at $\mu_{S}>300\,$mJy. Most of the VLASS variables have multiwavelength properties consistent with blazars and quasars, including those with the largest absolute changes in flux density. The largest fractional changes in brightness are exhibited by galactic sources. We discuss our results, including some of the more interesting and extreme examples of variable radio sources identified, as well as future research directions.

 - **Abstract**
 Odd Radio Circles (ORCs) are a new class of distinct radio objects that has recently been discovered. The origin of these features is yet unclear because their peculiar properties are a challenge for our current understanding of astrophysical sources for diffuse radio emission. In this work we test the feasibility of major mergers in galaxy groups as a possible formation channel for ORCs. By modeling the assembly of a massive galaxy group with a final virial mass of $M_{200}\sim 10^{13}\, \rm M_\odot$ in a magnetohydrodynamic zoom-in simulation with on-the-fly cosmic ray treatment, we are able to derive the X-ray and radio properties of the system self-consistently and compare them to observations. We show that the X-ray properties for the simulated system are agreeing with characteristics of observed galaxy groups in the regarded mass range, legitimating the comparison between the radio properties of the simulated halo and those of observed ORCs. A major merger between two galaxies in the simulation is triggering a series of strong shocks in the circumgalactic medium, which in unison are forming a ring if the line of sight is perpendicular to the merger axis. The shock is rapidly expanding in radial direction and quickly reaches the virial radius of the halo. This formation channel can hence readily explain the morphology and large extent of ORCs. However, the inferred radio luminosity of these features is lower than for observed counterparts, while the degree of polarization seems to be systematically overpredicted by the simulation. Fossil cosmic ray populations from AGN and stellar feedback might be necessary to explain the full extent of the radio properties of ORCs, since diffusive shock acceleration was the only source term for non-thermal electrons considered in this work.

 - **Abstract**
 The formation and evolution of galaxies are intricately linked to the baryon cycle, which fuels star formation while shaping chemical abundances within galaxies. Investigating the relationship between star formation and metallicity for large samples of galaxies requires expensive IFU surveys or sophisticated tools to analyze grism data. Here we analyze JWST NIRISS slitless grism data using Sleuth, a tool that forward models and infers spatially resolved physical properties from grism data, including observations from JWST NIRISS/NIRCam and future grism data like that from the Roman Space Telescope. Sleuth enables extraction of high-quality emission line maps from slitless spectra, overcoming contamination and spatially varying stellar populations, which previously limited such studies. Utilizing Sleuth with data from the CAnadian NIRISS Unbiased Cluster Survey (CANUCS), we investigated the relationship between metallicity and star formation in the star-forming clumps of galaxies at 0.6 < z < 1.35. We analyzed a sample of 20 galaxies, extracted high-quality emission line maps with Sleuth, and analyzed, in detail, the spatially resolved properties of star-forming clumps. Using $H\alpha$, [SII], and [SIII] emission line maps, we examined the spatially resolved metallicities, ionization, and star formation rates of our sample. Our findings reveal that these star-forming clumps show lower metallicities ($\sim$ 0.1 dex) than their surrounding galactic environments, indicating a metallicity dilution of 20 $\%$ within the clumps' gas. Our analysis indicates that these clumps exhibit intensified star formation and reduced metallicity, likely due to the inflow of metal-poor gas. These clumps illustrate the dynamic relationship between star formation and chemical enrichment within galaxies.
#### HST Observations of the CV Propeller LAMOST J024048.51+195226.9

 - **Abstract**
 We present Hubble Space Telescope (HST) FUV spectra and light curves of the magnetic cataclysmic variable (CV) LAMOST J024048.51+195226.9 (J0240), the second known CV propeller. The five consecutive HST orbits span a full 7.34 hour binary orbital period. We detect a 24.939 $\pm$ 0.006 s FUV modulation, confirming that J0240 contains the fastest spinning white dwarf (WD) in a CV. A high N V/C IV emission line ratio is considered an indicator of a recent episode of thermal time-scale mass transfer. The observed ratio in J0240 is higher than seen in typical magnetic CVs, but far less than observed in the only other confirmed propeller, AE Aquarii (AE Aqr). We also find that J0240 is significantly less luminous than AE Aqr during both low- and high-flux states. Around orbital phase 0.5, the Si IV emission line displays a P-Cygni absorption profile likely related to the gas accelerated in the propeller. We derive new mass-dependent temperature limits for the surface temperature of the WD of T $\leq$ 11,000-15,000 K. This temperature is low enough to allow for WD core crystallization, which may be linked to magnetism in WDs, particularly those in CVs.
#### Transient LoBALs at high velocities: A Case of Extreme Broad Absorption Line Variability in J115636.82+085628.9

 - **Abstract**
 We present a multi-epoch spectroscopic study of the broad absorption line (BAL) quasar J115636.82+085628.9 (z(em) = 2.1077), based on five spectra spanning nearly two decades in the observer's frame. This source exhibits remarkable variability in both low-ionization (LoBAL: Al III and Mg II) and high-ionization (HiBAL: C IV and Si IV) absorption features. For the first time, we detect the emergence and subsequent disappearance of LoBAL troughs at high velocities (~20,000 kms$^{-1}$), coinciding with the strengthening and weakening of the corresponding HiBAL absorption. The C IV BAL profile extends from ~6,700 kms$^{-1}$ to a conservative upper limit of 30,000 kms$^{-1}$ and is composed of narrow, variable absorption features embedded within a broad, smooth envelope. Both C IV and Si IV BAL troughs exhibit dramatic equivalent width (EW) changes, among the most extreme reported to date. Notably, these EW variations are strongly anti-correlated with continuum flux changes inferred from optical photometric light curves. We interpret this variability as the result of a new absorbing flow transiting into our line of sight, increasing the shielding of a more distant, pre-existing outflow and giving rise to transient LoBAL absorption. This scenario supports a unified picture in which LoBAL and HiBAL features arise from similar outflow structures, with observed differences governed primarily by line-of-sight column densities consistent with previous findings.

 - **Abstract**
 With the launch of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), we will be able to estimate the sky position, luminosity distance (d$_{L}$), chirp mass, and mass ratio for detected merging massive black hole binary (MBHB) systems. LISA's uncertainties on these estimates will evolve over time, and enable electromagnetic (EM) follow-up observations as early as a month from coalescence. In this paper, we create a framework that takes simulated LISA parameter estimates for sky localisation and d$_{L}$ for a MBHB and performs a census of matching EM galaxies, or candidate host galaxies. We used this framework to investigate these parameter estimates for simulated MBHB systems with masses of $3\times10^{5}$, $3\times10^{6}$, and $1\times10^{7}$M$_{\odot}$ at redshifts of $0.3$ and $0.5$ and used these parameters to select matching galaxies from archival Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) photometry. We found that the number of candidate host galaxies for a simulated MBHB system at a redshjft of $0.3$ and $1$ hour from coalescence ranged from tens to thousands. After coalescence, we found that our census numbers dropped to zero for all systems when considering median constraints most likely due to survey limitations. For a MBHB with mass $3\times10^{6}$M$_{\odot}$ at $1$ hour from coalescence, increasing the redshift from $0.3$ to $0.5$ or varying the sky position within the SDSS footprint resulted in the number of EM counterparts increasing by approximately a factor of $2$.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive, energy-resolved study of cosmic-ray muon anisotropy using 12 years (2011-2023) of data from the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, comprising 7.92 x 10^11 events in the 13 TeV to 5.3 PeV energy range. Dividing the spectrum at log-scale energy 5 GeV, we contrast low- and high-energy anisotropy features via sidereal modulation, angular profiles, Fourier analysis, and full-sky HEALPix mapping. Gaussian and power-law fits to energy distributions are evaluated using chi-squared, reduced chi-squared, and Bayesian Information Criterion. Results show strong dipolar and large-scale anisotropy at low energies, likely due to geomagnetic and atmospheric effects, while high-energy muons display weaker, more localized structures consistent with reduced scattering and source-related anisotropy. Energy distributions are well fit by Gaussians, especially in the 6.5 to 100 bin, validating IceCube's reconstruction at PeV scales. These findings confirm energy-dependent anisotropy and support cosmic-ray diffusion models.

 - **Abstract**
 Corotating interaction regions (CIRs) are compressions that form in stellar winds when streams of different speeds collide. They form an Archimedean spiral around the star and can compress any exoplanetary magnetospheres they impact. They may also steepen into shocks capable of accelerating particles to high energies. We model the frequency and strength of these CIRS for stars of spectral types F-M. We show that the minimum radius, $r_{CIR}=\Delta \phi u_{slow}/\Omega$, at which CIRs form varies strongly with the rotation rate (and hence age) of the star. For some exoplanets, such as those in Earth or Mars orbits, CIRs can form within the exoplanet's orbit at all stellar rotation rates, depending on the angular size of the fast wind segment ($\Delta \phi$). These exoplanets will experience CIR impacts at all stellar ages. However, for closer-in orbits such as Mercury or Venus, this may only be the case at higher stellar rotation rates. Both the frequency and impact of CIRs depend on the stellar rotation rate. For exoplanets with $P_{orbit}\gg P_*$, CIR impacts lasting for a time $\Delta t$ raise the exoplanetary outflow rate by a factor $R$. If $P_*\leq N\Delta t$ the CIR pulses overlap in time, whereas if $N\Delta t < P_* \leq N\Delta t(R+1)$, the planet experiences discrete pulses of compression and relaxation and the CIR-related outflow is more than 50$\%$ of the total. For $P_* > N\Delta t(R+1)$ the pulses are less frequent, and contribute less than $50\%$ of the total outflow.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultra-fast outflows (UFOs) with mildly relativistic velocities are frequently observed in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The line-force-driving mechanism is often taken as a potential mechanism for driving UFOs. Due to the line-force-driven winds moving at mildly relativistic velocities, the special relativistic effects become this http URL are two special relativistic effects: one is the influence of the disc rotation on the radiation field; the other is the radiation-drag effect. We wish to study the influence of the special relativistic effects on the line-force-driven winds, and we performed numerical simulations to investigate this http URL find that the line-force-driven winds are significantly weakened when the special relativistic effects are considered. Compared with the case without special relativistic effects, when special relativistic effects are considered the winds are closer to the disc surface, the maximum speed of winds is reduced by $\sim$20 percent--70 percent, and the mass outflow rate and the kinetic power is significantly reduced.

 - **Abstract**
 The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ), located in the centre of the Milky Way, is a roughly cylindrical structure of molecular gas extending up to parsecs around the supermassive black hole Sagittarius A*. The average H2 ionisation rate in the CMZ is estimated to be 2e-14 s-1, which is 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than anywhere else in the Galaxy. Due to the high gas density in this region, electromagnetic radiation is rapidly absorbed, leaving low-energy cosmic rays (CRs) as the only effective ionising agents. Hence, a high CR density has been invoked to explain such high ionisation rates. However, a corresponding excess in gamma rays, which would result from interactions of high-energy CRs, has not been observed. This suggests that the supposed excess exists only in the low-energy CR spectrum. To constrain this unknown low-energy component, we first derive the high-energy CR injection spectra using gamma-ray and radio data, to which we add various low-energy components. We then propagate these injection spectra by numerically solving the CR transport equation using a Crank-Nicolson scheme. Testing multiple CR injection scenarios, we find that the energy required to sustain the observed ionisation rates is excessively high in every case. We conclude that CRs cannot be the exclusive ionising agents in the CMZ.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the detection of Ly${\alpha}$ in CANUCS-LRD-z8.6, a recently discovered AGN at z = 8.63 by Tripodi et al. (2024), in new NIRSpec/MSA G140H/F070LP observations. We detect broad Ly${\alpha}$ emission (FWHM $= 1540 \pm 260$ km/s) near the systemic velocity, which suggests a large ionizing bubble considering that the universe is almost fully neutral at the redshift. Through Ly${\alpha}$ line-shape modeling assuming a Stromgren sphere, we find a large bubble radius, $R_b = 1.5^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$ pMpc, and a moderately high Ly${\alpha}$ escape fraction, $f_{esc} = 11 \pm 3$ %. The intrinsic line width is inferred to be broad ($2200 \pm 280$ km/s), likely originating in the broad-line region. Existing data indicate that CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 is within a mild overdensity, $\delta = 1.9^{+2.9}_{-0.7}$, suggesting that other galaxies in its proximity might have contributed to the formation of the bubble. The high N IV]${\lambda}$1488 / C IV${\lambda}$1548 and N IV]${\lambda}$1488 / O III]${\lambda}$1661 line ratios measured in existing NIRSpec/PRISM data indicate nitrogen enrichment in this metal-poor, low-luminosity AGN. The spectroscopic features are overall similar to other nitrogen-rich galaxies discovered in the literature, such as GN-z11 and GHZ2/GLASSz12. This suggests that CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 may represent one of the evolutionary phases of those nitrogen-rich galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 The morphology and kinematics of atomic Hydrogen (HI) gas in galaxies are influenced by both local and large scale cosmic environments. Differences in galaxy environment and interactions can leave distinct signatures in HI asymmetry, offering insight into environmental effects on galaxy evolution. We investigate the role of environment on HI asymmetries in galaxies located in two contrasting structures: the Ursa Major (UMa) group and the Perseus Pisces (PP) filament. We analyze HI 21cm imaging from the WSRT and the VLA, homogenized in resolution for fair comparison. Asymmetries in global profiles and column density maps are measured using criteria established in arXiv:2205.00675 and compared to those of mock galaxies presented in the same study. The PP volume hosts a higher fraction of galaxies with asymmetric global HI profiles (33%) compared to UMa (9%). Likewise, 46% of PP galaxies have morphological HI asymmetries above 0.5 at a threshold of 15 x 10^19 cm^-2, compared to 13% in UMa. The greater column density sensitivity of the UMa data enables detection of lopsided features and asymmetry measurement down to 5 x 10^19 cm^-2. We also identify simulated galaxies with unphysical asymmetries likely caused by unrealistic feedback. In both volumes, stellar and HI morphological asymmetries are uncorrelated. Global profile and morphological asymmetries are also found to be uncorrelated, consistent with previous results.
#### SN 2024gy: Multi-epoch Spectroscopic Evidence for Delayed Detonation in a Type Ia Supernova

 - **Abstract**
 We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 2024gy, a Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) exhibiting high-velocity features (HVFs) in its early-time spectra. This SN reaches a peak $B$-band magnitude of $-19.25 \pm 0.28$ mag and subsequently declines by $\Delta m_{15}(B) \approx 1.12$ mag, consistent with the luminosity-width relation characteristic of normal SNe Ia. Based on the peak thermal luminosity of $(1.2 \pm 0.3) \times 10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$, we estimate that $0.57 \pm 0.14~\rm M_{\odot}$ of $^{56}$Ni was synthesized during the explosion. Our dense early spectral monitoring revealed significant velocity disparities within the ejecta. Notably, absorption features from the \CaII\ near-infrared triplet were observed at velocities exceeding 25,000 km s$^{-1}$, while the \SiII\, \ld 6355 line velocity at the same epoch was significantly lower at $\sim$ 16,000 km s$^{-1}$. This velocity disparity likely reflects distinct ionization states of intermediate-mass elements in the outermost layers. The prominent \CaII\, HVFs may originate from ionization suppression within the highest-velocity ejecta, potentially indicative of minimal hydrogen mixing in a delayed-detonation explosion scenario. Additionally, the Ni/Fe ratio derived from the nebular spectrum of SN 2024gy provides further support for this model.

 - **Abstract**
 Beyond deepening our understanding of the formation, growth, and evolution of supermassive black holes, it is crucial to uncover the role of feeding and feedback processes from growing black holes (i.e., active galactic nucleus; AGN) in shaping the cosmic ecosystem. Such studies include understanding the dynamics of gas flows in the interstellar (ISM), circumgalactic (CGM), intracluster (ICM), and intergalactic media (IGM). As the output of a sub-group in Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) AGN Working Group, this Science Case Development Document (SCDD) proposes to use future HWO observations to solve the following questions. Which mechanism is dominant in triggering inflows/outflows through feedback? How is AGN activity triggered, and is it associated with circumnuclear star formation and what is the overall effect of AGN feedback on star formation (SF)? In AGN feedback, which mode is more influential and does AGN feedback operate similarly or differently in the local universe and at high redshift? To answer these questions, this SCDD proposes to use potential HWO observations as follows. Resolve and characterize the spatial distribution of ionized and cold/warm molecular gas, especially those in inflows/outflows; Explore the spatial coupling and potential stratification of multi-phase inflows/outflows on different physical scales and their resolved and global correlations with AGN and/or SF activities; Investigate whether corresponding outflows/jets induce shocks and/or fluctuations that trigger or suppress the formation of molecular clouds and hence new stars. Specifically, HWO's capabilities will enable us to achieve the above scientific goals while existing facilities lack the required combination of high-throughput ultraviolet (UV) and near-infrared (NIR) integral field unit (IFU) capabilities with simultaneously sufficient spatial resolution and sensitivity.

 - **Abstract**
 With excellent spectral and angular resolutions and, especially, sensitivity, the JWST allows us to observe infrared emission lines that were previously inaccessible or barely accessible. These emission lines are promising for evaluating the physical conditions in different galaxies. Based on {\sc MAPPINGS V} photoionization models, we systematically analyze the dependence of over 20 mid-infrared (mid-IR) emission lines covered by the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) onboard JWST on the physical conditions of different galactic environments, in particular narrow line regions (NLRs) in active galactic nuclei (AGN). We find that mid-IR emission lines of highly ionized argon (i.e., [Ar~{\small V}]7.90,13.10) and neon (i.e., [Ne~{\small V}]14.32,24.32, [Ne~{\small VI}]7.65) are effective in diagnosing the physical conditions in AGN. We accordingly propose new prescriptions to constrain the ionization parameter ($U$), peak energy of the AGN spectrum ($E_{\rm peak}$), metallicity ($\rm 12+log (O/H)$), and gas pressure ($P/k$) in AGN. These new calibrations are applied to the central regions of six Seyfert galaxies included in the Galaxy Activity, Torus, and Outflow Survey (GATOS) as a proof of concept. We also discuss the similarity and difference in the calibrations of these diagnostics in AGN of different luminosities, highlighting the impact of hard X-ray emission and particularly radiative shocks, as well as the different diagnostics in star-forming regions. Finally, we propose diagnostic diagrams involving [Ar~{\small V}]7.90 and [Ne~{\small VI}]7.65 to demonstrate the feasibility of using the results of this study to distinguish galactic regions governed by different excitation sources.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and star forming galaxies (SFGs) are the primary sources of extragalactic radio sky. But it is difficult to distinguish the radio emission produced by AGNs from that by SFGs, especially when the radio sources are faint. Best et al. (2023) classified the radio sources in LoTSS Deep Fields DR1 through multiwavelength SED fitting. With the classification results of them, we perform a supervised machine learning to distinguish radio AGNs and radio SFGs. Aims. We aim to provide a supervised classifier to identify radio AGNs, which can get both high purity and completeness simultaneously, and can easily be applied to datasets of large-area surveys. Methods. The classifications of Best et al. (2023) are used as the true labels for supervised machine learning. With the cross-matched sample of LoTSS Deep Fields DR1, AllWISE and Gaia DR3, the features of optical and mid-infrared magnitude and colors, are applied to train the classifier. The performance of the classifier is evaluated mainly by the precission, recall and F1 score of both AGNs and non-AGNs. Results. By comparing the performance of six learning algorithms, CatBoost is chosen to construct the best classifier. The best classifier get precision = 0.974, recall = 0.865 and F1 = 0.916 for AGNs, precision = 0.936, recall = 0.988 and F1 = 0.961 for non-AGNs. After applying our classifier to the cross-matched sample of LoTSS DR2, AllWISE and Gaia DR3, we obtain a sample of 49716 AGNs and 102261 non-AGNs. The reliability of these classification results is confirmed by comparing with the spectroscopic classification of SDSS. The precission and recall of AGN sample can be as high as 94.2% and 92.3%, respectively. We also train a model to identify radio excess sources. The F1 scores are 0.610 and 0.965 for sources with and without radio excess, respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are enigmatic millisecond-duration signals which encode otherwise unattainable information on the plasma which permeates our Universe, providing insights into magnetic fields and gas distributions. Here we report the discovery of FRB 20240304B originating at redshift 2.148 +/- 0.001 corresponding to just 3 billion years after the Big Bang. FRB 2024030 was detected with the MeerKAT radio telescope and localized to a low-mass, clumpy, star forming galaxy using the James Webb Space Telescope. This discovery doubles the redshift reach of localized FRBs and probes ionized baryons across ~80% of cosmic history. Its sightline, intersecting the Virgo Cluster and a foreground group, reveals magnetic field complexity over many gigaparsec scales. Our observations establish FRB activity during the peak of cosmic star formation and demonstrate that FRBs can probe galaxy formation during the most active era in cosmic time.

 - **Abstract**
 The rotational evolution of a strongly magnetized neutron star (NS), accreting or isolated, is driven by external torques of different nature. In addition to the torques, even the tiniest deformations of the NS crust can affect its rotation through asymmetries in its inertia tensor. Several factors may be responsible for the deformations, including strong magnetic fields, internal stresses, or local heating. The main effect produced by the deformations is the so-called free precession: the motion of the rotational axis with respect to the crust. We consider the evolution of a triaxially deformed isolated NS with a strong dipolar magnetic field for a broad range of parameters, taking into account the magnetic field decay. We show that the combination of pulsar torques and free precession results in a considerable broadening of the distribution of magnetic obliquity angles (the angle between the magnetic and rotational axes) and creates a population of objects where the rotational axis does not align with the magnetic axis at all but enters a limit-cycle regime. The combination of free precession and magnetic torques can also explain the observed distribution in pulsar braking indices by creating a periodic oscillation in the magnetic obliquity.

 We present space-based very long baseline interferometry observations of the BL Lac type object OJ 287 taken with RadioAstron at 22 GHz on April 25, 2016, in conjunction with a ground array comprising 27 radio telescopes. We detect ground-space fringes at projected baselines extending up to 4.6 Earth diameters, which allowed us to image the jet in OJ 287 with an angular resolution of ~47 {\mu}as. Applying an advanced regularized maximum likelihood imaging method, we resolved the innermost jet structure with a complex morphology at a resolution of ~15 {\mu}as (~0.1 pc projected distance). For the first time, due to a favorable geometrical position of the jet in tandem with high data quality, we detect multiple sharp bends that form a "ribbon-like" jet structure that extends down to 1 mas. Two-dimensional Gaussian model-fitting reveals regions of the jet with brightness temperatures of more than 10^13 K, indicative of strong Doppler boosting. Polarimetric imaging reveals that the electric vector position angles are predominantly perpendicular to the innermost jet direction, implying a dominant poloidal magnetic field component near the central engine. Complementary multi-epoch Very Long Baseline Array observations at 43 GHz provide a multifrequency view of the jet evolution. Ridgeline analysis of the 43 GHz data shows significant variations in the jet position angle from 2014 to 2017, behavior consistent with a rotating helical jet structure. Finally, we confirm the emergence of a new jet component (B15 or K), which may be associated with the source's first TeV flare, and offer new observational constraints relevant to models involving a supermassive black hole binary.

 - **Abstract**
 Crystalline ice in Earth's atmosphere can produce spectacular phenomena due to orientation-dependent attenuation, such as sun dogs and halos, providing diagnostics of the external processes acting on the aerosol grains. Crystalline mineral aerosols, such as quartz (SiO$_2$) and enstatite/forsterite (MgSiO$_3$/Mg$_2$SiO$_4$), have long been predicted to form in hot Jupiter atmospheres with JWST MIRI LRS verifying the existence of crystalline quartz observationally. Due to the strong horizontal winds ($\sim$ 1 - 5 km s$^{-1}$) and small aerosol grains ($<1$ $\mu$m) found in hot Jupiter atmospheres, we show that aerosols could be mechanically aligned with the winds. We then derive directional-dependent optical properties of quartz, enstatite, and forsterite and model transmission and emission spectra assuming random and mechanically aligned orientations, finding that the orientation of all three crystalline aerosols can impart $\geq$ 100 ppm differences in observed spectra (8 - 12 $\mu$m). We run retrievals on JWST MIRI LRS transmission and emission data of WASP-17b and find that directionality alone cannot physically explain the transmission data, pointing towards polymorphs or insufficient lab data, and find weak hints of directionality (1.0 - 1.3$\sigma$) in the emission data. This work demonstrates the power of JWST MIRI LRS in detecting aerosol directionality with future observations, and a technique by which to probe how aerosols interact with atmospheric dynamical processes. To foster the exploration of aerosols in exoplanet data, the open-source code POSEIDON has been updated (v1.3.1) to include 144 new directional and temperature aerosols with precomputed optical properties, alongside new aerosol models.

 - **Abstract**
 Primordial non-Gaussianity is predicted by various inflationary models, and N-body simulations are a crucial tool for studying its imprints on large-scale structure. In this work, we present \texttt{GENGARS} ( GEnerator of Non-Gaussian ARbitrary Shapes), a framework for generating accurate non-Gaussian initial conditions for N-body simulations. It builds upon the formulation introduced by Wagner \& Verde (2012), enabling to generate a primordial gravitational potential with a desired separable bispectrum $B_{\Phi}(k_1,k_2,k_3)$. For the local, equilateral and orthogonal non-Gaussian templates, we benchmark our method against the well-established \texttt{2LPT-PNG} code. We show that \texttt{GENGARS} achieves improved accuracy and lower noise by suppressing spurious contributions to the primordial power spectrum. This paper aims at presenting the method, quantifying its performance and illustrating the benefits and applicable use cases over existing approaches.

 - **Abstract**
 The long-term retention of substantial atmospheres in close-in exoplanets presents a major challenge to classical hydrodynamic escape theory, which predicts rapid mass loss under intense stellar irradiation. In this work, we propose a fully classical, interior-driven suppression mechanism based on thermoelastic contraction of the planetary mantle. By incorporating pressure- and temperature-dependent elastic deformation into the structural evolution of the planet, we demonstrate that radial contraction can lead to measurable increases in surface escape velocity. We analytically derive a modified escape condition and introduce a dimensionless suppression index Xi that quantifies the extent to which internal mechanical response inhibits atmospheric loss. Numerical simulations across a wide parameter space show that volumetric strain values in the range 0.005 to 0.01 can enhance escape velocities by up to 10 percent, leading to a reduction in energy-limited escape rates by over 50 percent. When applied to warm mini-Neptunes such as GJ 1214b, K2-18b, and TOI-270c, the model successfully accounts for their persistent atmospheres without invoking exotic stellar conditions or chemical outliers. Our results indicate that planetary elasticity, often neglected in escape models, plays a first-order role in shaping the atmospheric evolution of close-in worlds. The theory yields specific observational predictions, including suppressed outflow signatures and radius anomalies, which may be testable with JWST, ARIEL, and future spectroscopic missions.

 - **Abstract**
 The structure of accretion flows in low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGN) at low Eddington ratios (~10^-2 to 10^-3) are poorly-understood, and can be probed using the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of faded changing-look (CL) quasars. Previous results using single-epoch X-ray and rest-frame UV observations of samples of faded CL quasars suggest that their SED properties at low Eddington ratios display similarities to X-ray binaries fading from outburst. However, more robust tests demand multi-epoch observations that can trace the temporal behavior of the SEDs of individual AGN at low Eddington ratios. Here, we perform this test, by obtaining a second epoch of UV and X-ray observations of a sample of three faded CL quasars with bolometric Eddington ratios of <10^-3, using a combination of contemporaneous HST UV imaging, Chandra X-ray observations, and optical spectroscopy. We find that all three CL quasars varied in luminosity, and their optical-to-X-ray spectral indices alpha_OX all individually display a negative (harder-when-brighter) correlation with Eddington ratio. This SED evolution is also often observed in X-ray binaries at low Eddington ratios, and adds to the growing evidence that AGN accretion flows behave analogously to X-ray binaries across all accretion states.
#### HAWC, VERITAS, Fermi-LAT and XMM-Newton follow-up observations of the unidentified ultra-high-energy gamma-ray source LHAASO J2108+5157

 - **Abstract**
 We report observations of the ultra-high-energy gamma-ray source LHAASO J2108$+$5157, utilizing VERITAS, HAWC, \emph{Fermi}-LAT, and \textit{XMM-Newton}. VERITAS has collected $\sim$ 40 hours of data that we used to set ULs to the emission above 200 GeV. The HAWC data, collected over $\sim 2400$ days, reveal emission between 3 and 146 TeV, with a significance of $7.5~\sigma$, favoring an extended source model. The best-fit spectrum measured by HAWC is characterized by a simple power-law with a spectral index of $2.45\pm0.11_{stat}$. \emph{Fermi}-LAT analysis finds a point source with a very soft spectrum in the LHAASO J2108+5157 region, consistent with the 4FGL-DR3 catalog results. The \textit{XMM-Newton} analysis yields a null detection of the source in the 2 - 7 keV band. The broadband spectrum can be interpreted as a pulsar and a pulsar wind nebula system, where the GeV gamma-ray emission originates from an unidentified pulsar, and the X-ray and TeV emission is attributed to synchrotron radiation and inverse Compton scattering of electrons accelerated within a pulsar wind nebula. In this leptonic scenario, our X-ray upper limit provides a stringent constraint on the magnetic field, which is $\lesssim 1.5\ \mu$G.

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of certain proton-rich isotopes in the solar system, particularly $^{92,94}{\rm Mo}$ and $^{96,98}{\rm Ru}$, has been a long-standing puzzle. A promising explanation is the $\nu p$-process, which is posited to operate in the neutrino-driven outflows that form inside core-collapse supernovae after shock revival. Recent studies have identified several relevant physical effects that influence the yields of this process. The impact of General Relativity (GR) on the $\nu p$-process yields, however, remains unexplored. In this work, we perform a comparative analysis of the time-integrated yields of the $p$ nuclei up to $A \lesssim 105$ in Newtonian and fully GR neutrino-driven outflows, using a detailed model of a time-evolving outflow profile. The two main GR effects are the gravitational shift of neutrino energies and post-Newtonian corrections to the gravitational potential. These effects together suppress the production of seed nuclei, significantly boosting the $\nu p$-process yields in our 18 $M_\odot$ progenitor model. Most of the production of the crucial $^{92,94}{\rm Mo}$ and $^{96,98}{\rm Ru}$ $p$ isotopes in this model occurs in an optimal time window, 1-3 seconds after shock revival. Interestingly, the same does not apply to the shielded isotope $^{92}{\rm Nb}$, a large fraction of which is produced in the subsequent ejecta. The impact of GR on this isotope is especially large, with its final abundance boosted by a factor of 25 compared to a Newtonian calculation. In our 12.75 $M_\odot$ model, an additional GR effect is observed: the outflow transitions to the supersonic regime several seconds into the explosion, causing the yields to drop. This study quantifies the important role GR effects play in the $\nu p$-process and provides guidance for identifying optimal conditions in future self-consistent supernova simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 The HEliospheric pioNeer for sOlar and interplanetary threats defeNce (HENON) mission is a CubeSat Space Weather mission, designed to operate in a Sun-Earth Distant Retrograde Orbit (DRO) at more than 10 million km from Earth. HENON will embark payloads tailored for Space Weather (SWE) observations: a high-resolution energetic particle radiation monitor, a Faraday cup, and a magnetometer, enabling quasi-real-time monitoring of interplanetary conditions in deep space. HENON has multiple objectives, such as demonstrating CubeSat capabilities in deep space, including long-duration electric propulsion with periodic telemetry and command, and robust attitude control for deep-space operations. It will pave the way for a future fleet of spacecraft on DROs, providing continuous near real-time measurements for SWE forecasting. This paper focuses on the mission analysis performed for phases A and B, with the main goal of defining a baseline transfer trajectory to a heliocentric DRO in co-orbital motion with Earth. The proposed transfer leverages a rideshare opportunity on a mission escaping Earth gravity field, most likely one headed toward the Sun-Earth L2 region, and relies exclusively on on-board electric propulsion to reach deep space, making it a pioneering demonstration of this approach and the technology. Under appropriate assumptions on the electric propulsion system performance, spacecraft mass, and propellant budget, it is shown that the HENON target DRO can be reached in about one year, accounting also for periodic interruptions of thrusting to allow for telemetry, tracking, and command.

 - **Abstract**
 Rotating black holes are known to launch relativistic jets and accelerate particles provided they accrete a magnetized plasma. However, it remains unclear how the global magnetic field orientation affects the jet powering efficiency. Here, we propose the first kinetic study of a collisionless plasma around a Kerr black hole that is embedded in a magnetic field inclined with respect to the black hole's spin axis. Using three-dimensional general-relativistic particle-in-cell simulations, we show that while oblique magnetic field configurations significantly reduce the jet power, particle acceleration remains highly efficient regardless. This suggests that black holes producing a weak jet could still be bright sources of nonthermal radiation and cosmic rays.

 - **Abstract**
 M31N 2017-01e is the second-fastest recurrent nova known, with a recurrence period of 2.5 years in the Andromeda Galaxy (M31). This system exhibits a unique combination of properties: a low outburst amplitude ($\sim3$ magnitude), starkly contrasting with known recurrent novae (typically $\geq 6$ magnitudes), and a very fast evolution ($t_{2}\sim 5 $ days). Its position coincides with a bright variable source ($\mathrm{M_V \sim -4.2,\, B-V= 0.042}$) displaying a 14.3 day photometric modulation, which has been suggested as the likely progenitor. We present a multi-wavelength analysis of optical and UV data spanning quiescence and the 2019 and 2024 outbursts. Archival high-resolution imaging reveals two nearby faint sources within $5^{\prime\prime}$ of the proposed nova system, which we identified as unrelated field stars. Color analysis and spectral energy distribution fitting suggest the progenitor is likely an early-type star. Combined with archival spectra consistent with a B-type star with H$\alpha$ in emission, this points to the quiescent counterpart being a Be star with a circumstellar disc. We propose that M31N 2017-01e arises from a rare Be-WD binary, where the WD accretes from the decretion disk of its companion, explaining its rapid recurrence, low-amplitude outbursts, and unusual quiescent luminosity and color. This analysis highlights M31N 2017-01e as a compelling outlier among recurrent novae, suggesting a distinct accretion mechanism and evolutionary path that challenges the prevailing paradigm.

 - **Abstract**
 PARSEC v2.0 rotating stellar tracks were previously presented for six values of metallicity from subsolar to solar values, with initial rotation rates ($\omega_\mathrm{i}$, defined as the ratio of angular velocity and its critical value) spanning from the non-rotating case to very near the critical velocity (i.e. $\omega_\mathrm{i}=0.99$), and for initial masses covering the $\sim 0.7 M_\odot$ to $14 M_\odot$ interval. Furthermore, we provided the corresponding isochrones converted into several photometric systems, for different inclination angles between the line-of-sight and the rotation axes, from $0^\circ$ (pole-on) to $90^\circ$ (equator-on). In this work, we expand this database with seven other sets of metallicity, including five sets of low metallicity ($Z=0.0001-0.002$) and two sets of super-solar values (up to $Z=0.03$). Here, we present the new stellar tracks, comprising $\sim$3\,040 tracks in total ($\sim$5\,500 including previous sets), along with the new corresponding rotating isochrones. We also introduce the possibility of creating isochrones, by interpolation, for values of rotating rates not available in the initial set of tracks. We compare a selection of our new models with rotating stellar tracks from the Geneva Stellar Evolution Code, and we assess the quality of our new tracks by fitting the colour-magnitude diagram of the open cluster NGC6067. We take advantage of the projected rotational velocity of member stars measured by Gaia to validate our results and examine the surface oxygen abundances in comparison with the observed data. All newly computed stellar tracks and isochrones are retrievable via our dedicated web databases and interfaces.

 - **Abstract**
 Isotopic properties of meteorites provide evidence that multiple dust trap or pressure bumps had to form and persist in the inner Solar System on a timescale of millions of years. The formation of a pressure bump at the outer edge of the gap opened by Jupiter blocks particles drifting from the outer to the inner disk. This is not enough to preserve dust in the inner disk. However, in low viscosity disks, under specific condition on the gas cooling time, massive planets can also open secondary gaps, separated by density bumps, inward of the main gap. The majority of studies have been done in two dimensional equatorial simulations with prescribed disk cooling. Recent results have shown that including the treatment of radiation transport is key to determine the formation of secondary gaps. We extend previous studies to three dimensional disks including radiative effects and we also consider non ideal MHD effects, in disks with prescribed cooling time. We perform three dimensional hydrodynamical numerical simulations with self consistent treatment of radiative effects and including the magnetic field with non ideal Ohmic and Ambipolar effects. We show that in a disk with low bulk viscosity and consistent treatment of radiative effects, planetary masses close to the pebble isolation mass as well as a Jupiter massive planet open multiple gaps. In the presence of non ideal MHD effects multiple gaps and rings are also formed by a Jupiter massive this http URL conclusion the formation of multiple gaps and rings inside the planetary orbit is crucial to preserve dust reservoirs. Such reservoirs are pushed towards the inner part of the disk during Jupiter runaway growth and are persistent after Jupiter's growth. Multiple dust reservoirs could therefore be present in the inner Solar System since the formation of Jupiter's solid core if the disk had low-viscosity.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate numerically the energy flow and radiation efficiency of accreting neutron stars as potential ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs). We perform ten simulations {in radiative general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRRMHD)}, exploring six different magnetic dipole strengths ranging from 10 to 100 GigaGauss, along with three accretion rates, 100, 300, and 1000 Eddington luminosity units. Our results show that the energy efficiency in simulations with a strong magnetic dipole of 100 GigaGauss is approximately half that of simulations with a magnetic dipole an order of magnitude weaker. Consequently, radiation efficiency is lower in simulations with stronger magnetic dipoles. We also demonstrate that outflow power increases as the magnetic dipole weakens, resulting in stronger beaming in simulations with weaker magnetic dipoles. As a result of beaming, simulations with magnetic dipole strengths below 30 GigaGauss exhibit apparent luminosities consistent with those observed in ULXs. As for the accretion rates, we find that higher accretion rates lead to more powerful outflows, higher kinetic efficiency, and lower radiation efficiency compared to those of lower accretion rate simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 As part of the JWST GTO program MINDS, we analyze the mid-infrared emission of three Class II binary systems: VW Cha, WX Cha, and RW Aur, to investigate the impact of stellar multiplicity on the chemistry and physics of their inner disk. We analyze the 1D spectrum from JWST/MIRI-MRS for primary and secondary disks separately, extracted by combining forward modeling with a theoretical PSF and aperture photometry. We modeled the molecular lines with 0D slab models. We interpret the results by comparing our JWST spectra to VLT/CRIRES+, Spitzer/IRS, and ALMA. Primary and secondary disks are dramatically different in their mid-infrared emission, with primary disks showing H2O-rich spectra, and secondary disks being mostly line poor to the sensitivity of our spectra. When comparing MIRI-MRS to Spitzer/IRS, we observe large variability in the line emission of VW Cha A, as well as in the continuum of RW Aur A. The disks around VW Cha BC and RW Aur B show evidence of ionizing radiation, and a further comparison with ALMA at high angular resolution dust continuum suggest that the spectrum of RW Aur B is well explained by its ~4 au cavity. All the systems show [Ne II] jet emission, and three of them also show spatially resolved emission structures in H2, likely originated by outflows and dynamical interactions. Many of the observed features in the primary disks, such as enhanced water emission, could be linked to the increased accretion and radial drift produced by dynamical disk truncation. However, additional mechanisms are needed to explain the large differences between primary and secondary disks, potentially inner disk substructures. This work is an example of the need for combining multiple facilities to fully understand the observations from JWST.
