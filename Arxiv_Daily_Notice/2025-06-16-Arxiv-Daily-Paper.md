 - **Abstract**
 Higher order finite volume schemes for magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) are very valuable because they allow us to carry out astrophysical simulations with very high accuracy. However, astrophysical problems sometimes have unusually large Mach numbers, exceptionally high Lorentz factors and very strong magnetic fields. All these effects cause higher order codes to become brittle and prone to code crashes. In this paper we document physical constraint preserving (PCP) methods for treating numerical MHD and RMHD. While unnecessary for standard problems, for stringent astrophysical problems these methods show their value. We describe higher order methods that allow divergence-free evolution of the magnetic field. We present a novel two-dimensional Riemann solver. This two-dimensional Riemann solver plays a key role in the design of PCP schemes for MHD and RMHD. We present a very simple PCP formulation and show how it is amalgamated with the evolution of face-centered magnetic fields. The methods presented here are time-explicit and do not add much to the computational cost. We show that the methods meet their design accuracies and work well on problems that would otherwise be considered too extreme for typical higher order Godunov methods of the type used in computational astrophysics.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations have revealed slow, coherent temperature fluctuations in AGN disks that propagate both inward and outward at velocities of $\sim 0.01 - 0.1c$, a kind of variability that is distinct from reverberation (mediated by the reprocessing of light) between different regions of the disk. We investigate the origin and nature of these fluctuations using global 3D radiation-magnetohydrodynamic simulations of radiation and magnetic pressure-dominated AGN accretion disks. Disks with a significant turbulent Maxwell stress component exhibit wave-like temperature perturbations, most evident close to the midplane, whose propagation speeds exactly match the local fast magnetosonic speed and are consistent with the speeds inferred in observations. These fluctuations have amplitudes of $2 - 4\%$ in gas temperature, which are also consistent with observational constraints. Disks that are dominated by mean-field Maxwell stresses do not exhibit such waves. While waves may be present in the body of the disk, we do not find them to be present in the photosphere. Although this may in part be due to low numerical resolution in the photosphere region, we discuss the physical challenges that must be overcome for the waves to manifest there. In particular, the fact that such waves are observed implies that the disk photospheres must be magnetically dominated, since radiative damping from photon diffusion smooths out radiation pressure fluctuations. Furthermore, the gas and radiation fluctuations must be out of local thermodynamic equilibrium.

 - **Abstract**
 Ray tracing algorithms that compute pulse profiles from rotating neutron stars are essential tools for constraining neutron-star properties with data from missions such as NICER. However, the high computational cost of these simulations presents a significant bottleneck for inference algorithms that require millions of evaluations, such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. In this work, we develop a residual neural network model that accelerates this calculation by predicting the observed flux from the surface of a spinning neutron star as a function of its physical parameters and rotational phase. Leveraging GPU-parallelized evaluation, we demonstrate that our model achieves many orders-of-magnitude speedup compared to traditional ray tracing while maintaining high accuracy. We also show that the trained network can efficiently accommodate complex emission geometries, including non-circular and multiple hot spots, by integrating over localized flux predictions.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a framework for relating gravitational wave (GW) sources to the astrophysical properties of spectroscopic galaxy samples. We show how this can enable using clustering measurements of gravitational wave (GW) sources to infer the relationship between the GW sources and the astrophysical properties of their host galaxies. We accomplish this by creating mock GW catalogs from the spectroscopic Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR7 galaxy survey. We populate the GWs using a joint host-galaxy probability function defined over stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), and metallicity. This probability is modeled as the product of three broken power-law distributions, each with a turnover point motivated by astrophysical processes governing the relation between current-day galaxy properties and BBH mergers, such as galaxy quenching and BBH delay time. Our results show that GW bias is most sensitive to host-galaxy probability dependence on stellar mass, with increases of up to $\sim O (10)\%$ relative to galaxy bias as the stellar mass pivot scale rises. We also find a notable relationship between GW bias and SFR: when the host-galaxy probability favors low-SFR galaxies, the GW bias significantly increases. In contrast, we observe no strong correlation between GW bias and metallicity. These findings suggest that the spatial clustering of GW sources is primarily driven by the stellar mass and SFR of their host galaxies and shows how GW bias measurements can inform models of the host-galaxy probability function.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new lens model for the $z=0.375$ galaxy cluster Abell 370 based on previously spectroscopically confirmed lensed galaxies and new lensed systems identified in JWST data, including recent data from the MAGNIF program. Based on the best models able to reproduce two radial arcs near the BCGs, we compare the stellar mass to the total mass from the lens model and find that the fraction of dark matter in the south BCG is consistent with $\Lambda$CDM while in the north BCG we find a very small amount of dark matter, more consistent with alternative models to $\Lambda$CDM. We discuss possible causes for this and conclude that additional data is needed to clarify the situation. We study the lensing properties, magnification, time delay and strength of the critical curve, along the Dragon arc, where previous studies have reported tens of alleged microlensing events from supergiant stars at $z=0.7251$. The new lens model is able to reproduce the distribution of microlensing events with great accuracy. Some of the microlensing events may be reinterpreted as long-period Cepheid in future observations. We consider this possibility and study in more detail the challenges for such detection from intervening microlenses.

 - **Abstract**
 Numerous studies have established that the environment influences the physical properties of a galaxy. While gas inflows supply the fuel for SF, high density and temperature conditions suppress SF activity through various quenching processes. Investigations into large scale structures, such as filaments and overdense regions in the cluster outskirts, have focused on the low z. To move to intermediate z and explore galaxy pathways combined with environmental effects, it is crucial to join wide field spectroscopy and deep photometry. Our primary objective is to spectroscopically analyze the photometric overdensities observed by Estrada et al.(2023) in the outskirts of massive cluster MACS J0416.1-2403 (z=0.397), interpreted as evidence of ongoing group infall, i.e. the pre processing scenario, and to investigate the behavior of galaxies in the outskirts about their g-r color, Mstar, and local density, emphasizing the influence of the environment on galaxy evolution. We conducted a spectroscopic analysis out to 5.5R200, using the AAOmega spectrograph. The large FoV and depth allowed us to explore galaxies up to the cluster periphery and across a wide Mstar range, reaching down to the limit of dwarf galaxies. Redshifts were obtained through independent but comparable methods: Redrock, EZ, and Redmost. We identified 148 new spectroscopic cluster members from a sample of 1236 objects. We found 81 galaxies located in filamentary and overdense regions, supporting the role of filamentary infall in the cluster mass assembly history. Our analysis revealed that galaxies in high density regions are more massive, redder, and more passive, compared to galaxies in low density regions that appear to be bluer, less massive, and more SF. These findings underscore the significance of environmental effects and the role of pre processing in shaping galaxy properties before cluster infall.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a second-order calculation of relativistic large-scale-structure observables in cosmological perturbation theory, specifically the "cosmic rulers and clock", which are the building-blocks of any other large-scale-structure observable, including galaxy number counts, on large scales. We calculate the scalar rulers (longitudinal perturbation and magnification) and the cosmic clock to second order, using a fully non-linear covariant definition of the observables. We validate our formulae on three non-trivial space-time metrics: two of them are null tests on metrics which are obtained by applying a gauge transformation to the background space-time, while the third is the "separate universe" curved background, for which we can also compute the observables exactly. We then illustrate the results by evaluating the second-order observables in a simplified symmetric setup. On large scales, they are suppressed over the linear contributions by $\sim 10^{-4}$, while they become comparable to the linear contributions on mildly non-linear scales. The results of this paper form a significant (and the most complicated) part of the relativistic galaxy number density at second order.
#### Discovery of Faint Nebulosity Around a Z Camelopardalis-type Cataclysmic Variable in Antlia: Nova Shell or Ancient Planetary Nebula?

 - **Abstract**
 We report our discovery of a faint nebula surrounding a previously little-studied 15th-mag variable star, ASASSN-19ds, in the southern-hemisphere constellation Antlia. Spectra verify that the star is a cataclysmic variable (CV). Using new and archival photometry, we confirm that ASASSN-19ds is an eclipsing binary with an orbital period of 0.139 days (3.34 hr). Moreover, its out-of-eclipse brightness shows a "sawtooth" light curve with an amplitude of $\sim$1~mag and an interval between peaks that varies between about three to nearly five weeks. Its mean absolute magnitude in the Gaia system is $M_G=+6.5$. These combined properties lead to a classification of ASASSN-19ds as a Z Camelopardalis-type CV. We obtained deep narrow-band images of the nebulosity, using modest-sized telescopes and extremely long exposure times. Our imagery reveals a bipolar morphology, with thin arcs at the ends of the major axis, likely indicating an interaction with the interstellar medium. We consider several scenarios for the origin of the nebula, but from the existing information we are unable to distinguish between it being ejecta from an unobserved classical-nova outburst several centuries ago, or an ancient planetary nebula. Future observations should be able to decide between these possibilities. At the star's distance of only $\sim$557 pc, a nova eruption would have been a spectacular naked-eye event.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy groups are more susceptible to feedback from the central active galactic nuclei (AGN) due to their lower gravitational binding energy compared to clusters. This makes them ideal laboratories to study feedback effects on the overall energy and baryonic mass budget. We study the LOFAR-detected galaxy group Nest200047, where there is clear evidence of multiple generations of radio lobes from the AGN. Using 140 ks Chandra and 25 ks XMM-Newton data, we investigate thermodynamic properties of the the intragroup medium including any excess energy due to the central AGN. We also investigate X-ray properties of the central black hole and constrain the $2-10$ keV X-ray flux. We used spectral analysis techniques to measure various thermodynamic profiles across the whole field of view. We also used both imaging and spectral analysis to detect and estimate the energy deposited by potential shocks and cavities. Due to the faint emission from the object beyond the core, various background effects were considered. Nest200047 has significant excess entropy, and the AGN likely contributes to a part of it. There is an excess energy of $(5-6.5) \times 10^{60}$ erg within 400 kpc, exceeding the binding energy. The pressure profile indicates that gas is likely being ejected from the system, resulting in a baryon fraction of $\sim4\%$ inside $r_{500}$. From scaling relations, we estimate a black hole mass of $(1-4)\times 10^9 M_{\odot}$. An upper limit of $2.1 \times 10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$ was derived on the black hole bolometric luminosity, which is $\sim$2.5% of the Bondi accretion power. Nest200047 is likely part of a class of over-heated galaxy groups like ESO 3060170, AWM 4 and AWM 5. Such excessive heating may lead to high quenching of star formation. Moreover, the faint X-ray nuclear emission in Nest is likely due to the accretion energy being converted into jets rather than radiation.

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of jets in young stellar objects (YSOs) remains a subject of active investigation. We present a 3D non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic simulation of jet launching in YSOs, focusing on the interaction between the stellar magnetosphere and the circumstellar disk. At the beginning of the simulation, the magnetosphere partially opens, forming two oppositely directed magnetic field regions: one threading the star and the other threading the inner disk. The latter dominates over the original disk field at small radii and contributes to launching a disk wind. In our model, the jet is launched from the interface between these regions by toroidal magnetic pressure generated along ``two-legged'' field lines, anchored at a magnetically dominated stellar footpoint and a mass-dominated point on the disk surface. Outflows are driven along these lines via a ``load-fire-reload'' cycle: in the ``load'' stage, differential rotation between the stellar and disk footpoints generates a toroidal magnetic field; in the ``fire'' stage, vertical gradients in toroidal field strength drive the outflow and release magnetic energy; and in the ``reload'' stage, magnetic reconnection between oppositely directed field lines resets the configuration, enabling the cycle to repeat. This process occurs rapidly and asynchronously across azimuthal angles, producing a continuous, large-scale outflow. From an energetic perspective, Poynting flux transports the toroidal field from the vicinity of the star into the polar cavity, powering the jet. Comparison with a disk-only model shows that the rotating stellar magnetosphere promotes bipolar jet launching by shaping a magnetic field geometry favorable to symmetric outflows.

 - **Abstract**
 Using continuum and $\text{C}^{18}\text{O}\:(2-1)$ line data obtained from the large ALMA program FAUST, we studied the structure of the protostellar binary system L1551 IRS5 at scales between 30 and 3,000 au to constrain its properties, from the circumstellar and circumbinary disks up to the envelope and outflow scales, which exhibits complex and entangled structures at the scales of its inner and outer envelopes, presumably caused by the influence of the central binary. Assuming a dust-to-gas ratio of 100, we calculated the dust+gas mass for the circumbinary disk and each circumstellar disk of the binary, obtaining 0.018 M$_{\odot}$, for the circumbinary disk, 0.004 M$_{\odot}$, and 0.002 M$_{\odot}$, for the northern and southern circumstellar disk respectively. From the line emission, we retrieved the gas masses for each structure component. With the $\text{C}^{18}\text{O}\:(2-1)$ PV diagram along the circumbinary disk, we were able to constrain the centrifugal barrier, $r_{CB}=55$ au, update the specific angular momentum, $j\sim270$~au~km~s$^{-1}$. We built an analytical model that can be used to predict the influence of the morphology of the outflow and a few dynamic features that can reproduce the system emission, allowing us to explain and discern the outflow contribution from the complex emission due to the binary. Additionally, we inferred the density power law index, $\alpha=1.7$, and the envelope rotation velocity, $v_{c}=2$~km~s$^{-1}$. Finally, the observations gave us the physical constraints to obtain a coherent outflow model for L1551 IRS5.

 - **Abstract**
 The rapid increase in satellite launches in recent years, and the pressure of launches planned into the next decade, demands an improvement in the efficiency of space domain awareness facilities. Optical facilities form an important component of global space domain awareness capabilities, however traditional optical telescopes are restricted to observing satellites during a small twilight window. In this work we explore expanding this operational period to encompass the entire day to dramatically improve the observing opportunities at a single site. We explore daytime space domain awareness observations with the Huntsman Telescope Pathfinder, an instrument built using predominantly off the self components, and Canon telephoto lenses. We report successful detections and photometric light curves of 81 Starlink satellites from Sun altitudes ranging 20 degrees to midday. Starlink satellites are found to be particularly bright at $3.6 \pm 0.05$ mag, $\sigma = 0.6 \pm 0.05$ mag in Sloan r', or $\sim 11\times$ brighter than twilight conditions. We conclude this surprising observed brightness is due to the contribution of Earthshine beneath the orbiting satellites. We also compare our observations to existing satellite optical brightness models and find that satellite optical brightness during the day can only be well described by a model including an Earthshine component. We find that observed light curves are more complex than simple geometric models predict, but generally agree within an order of magnitude. Finally we suggest improvements to satellite optical brightness models by incorporating weather data to measure the actual Earthshine under a satellite.

 - **Abstract**
 The IceCube Neutrino Observatory, located at the geographic South Pole, comprises a surface component, IceTop, and an optical in-ice array. This unique com\-bi\-na\-tion allows for coincident measurements of low-energy ($\sim \rm{GeV}$) and high-energy ($\gtrsim 400\,\rm{GeV}$) muons produced in cosmic-ray air showers. The ratio of the low- and high-energy muon yields can constitute a useful tool not only for composition analyses but also for testing different hadronic interaction models. However, since IceTop does not feature dedicated muon detectors, the measurement of the low-energy muon component for individual air showers is challenging. In this work, a new approach for a single-event based estimation of the low-energy muon content using a two component lateral distribution function (LDF) is utilized. This method combines an analytic description for the electromagnetic and muon lateral distributions of the total signal, with an aim to reconstruct primary energy and low-energy muon number, respectively. The underlying principle of this method as well as the resulting reconstruction performance will be detailed in this work.
#### Circum-nuclear eccentric gas flow in the Galactic Center revealed by ALMA CMZ Exploration Survey (ACES)

 We analyze the CS (J=2-1) line cube from the internal data release obtained by the large-scale program "ALMA CMZ Exploration Survey (ACES)" to investigate the kinematic structure of the innermost $\sim 10$ pc region of the Galaxy, which contains the high-velocity compact cloud (HVCC) at $(l,b,v_{\rm lsr})\sim(+0^\circ.02,-0^\circ.02, 100 {\rm km~s}^{-1})$ (hereafter G0.02). The longitude-velocity diagram (LVD) of the cloud draws an elliptical structure, which is interpreted as an orbital trajectory in the $(l,V_{\rm lsr})$ space of a noncircular (eccentric) motion of the molecular gas in the gravitational potential of an extended mass distribution in the central 10 pc of the Galaxy. We argue that G0.02 is a kinematic tracer of the inner potential, a rare case of a dense gas following an eccentric orbit in the nuclear gravitational field.

 - **Abstract**
 Aims : Extended-UV (XUV) galaxies are galaxies presenting an extended outer ultraviolet disks. Although some Giant Low Surface Brightness (GLSB) galaxies are also XUV, their relation has been seldom studied. This work aims to determine whether a sample of nine XUV galaxies can be classified as GLSBs, by analyzing their photometric properties in deep optical images. Method : The method presented here uses optical data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) to construct surface brightness (SB) profiles for each galaxy. A characteristic UV radius is defined to examine the XUV disks. The surface brightness profiles are fitted using simple exponential functions, and the extracted parameters are compared with the literature to identify possible GLSB galaxies. We examined also other diagnostics, including color profiles. Results : The analysis of the optical surface brightness profiles of XUV galaxies reveal that they can be classified into three different families. One third meet the GLSB criteria in terms of diffuseness, another third are regular, and the remaining have a stronger decline in the outer disk than in the inner disk, opposite to GLSBs. The color profiles allowed us, in addition to distinguish one of the galaxy, NGC1140, likely resulting from a rare dwarf-dwarf merger.

 - **Abstract**
 The measurements of the number density of galaxy-galaxy strong lenses can be used to put statistical constraints on the foreground mass distributions. Dusty galaxies uncovered in submillimeter surveys are particularly useful in this regard because of the large volume probed by these surveys. Previous discoveries of strong galaxy-galaxy lensed dusty galaxies are predominantly the brightest in the sky discovered by Herschel, SPT, and Planck. However, models have also predicted a non-negligible fraction of strong galaxy-galaxy lensed faint dusty galaxies, which were difficult to confirm due to technical difficulties. Utilizing the deepest SCUBA-2 submillimeter survey, STUDIES, in both the COSMOS and the UDS fields, together with a red JWST color selection method, we discover a population of 13 strong galaxy-galaxy lensed faint dusty galaxies. The rich ancillary data allow us to confirm their strongly lensed nature via estimates of redshifts and lens modeling. Our systematic search has allowed us to construct the 450$\mu$m number counts of strongly lensed sources down to the flux levels about an order of magnitude fainter than previous measurements. The measured lensing fractions of $\sim$1% are consistent with predictions from models that also successfully produce the number density of the strong galaxy-galaxy lensed bright dusty galaxies. Future searches from Euclid and Roman are expected to discover orders of magnitude more strongly lensed faint dusty galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a mass-dependent bimodality in the early evolution of galaxies. The massive track connects the super-bright galaxies at cosmic dawn ($z>8$) to the super-massive quiescent galaxies and black holes (BHs) at cosmic morning ($z=4-7$). The dark-matter halos $>10^{10.5}M_\odot$ at $z=10$ are expected to undergo feedback-free starbursts (FFB) with high star-formation efficiency in dense star clusters within compact galaxies. The less massive halos avoid FFB and form stars gradually under stellar feedback, leading to the peak star-forming galaxies at cosmic noon ($z=1-3$). The FFB and non-FFB halos originate from $>4\sigma$ and $2-3\sigma$ density peaks, respectively. The post-FFB galaxies quench their star formation soon after the FFB phase and remain quiescent due to (a) gas depletion by the FFB starbursts and outflows, (b) compaction events driven by angular-momentum loss in colliding streams within the high-sigma-peak FFB halos, (c) turbulent circum-galactic medium (CGM) that suppresses feeding by cold streams, and (d) BH feedback, being a key for complete quenching. BH feedback is enhanced by FFB-driven BH seeding and growth. It seems capable of disrupting the streams by generating CGM turbulence or photo-heating, but this remains an open challenge. The cosmic-morning quiescent galaxies are expected to be massive, compact, showing signatures of compaction, outflows and AGN, with a comoving number density $\sim 10^{-5} {\rm Mpc}^{-3}$, comparable to the super-bright galaxies at cosmic dawn and the AGN at cosmic morning. Their UV luminosity function should peak about $M_{\rm uv} \sim -22$ and contribute $\sim 10\%$ of the galaxies there.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast X-ray transients (FXTs) are bright X-ray flashes with durations of minutes to hours, peak isotropic luminosities of L_X,peak ~ 10^42-10^47 erg/s, and total isotropic energies of E ~ 10^47-10^50 erg. They have been detected in the soft X-ray band by Chandra, XMM-Newton, Swift-XRT, and, most recently, by Einstein Probe, which has reported more than 50 FXTs in its first year of operation. While several models have been proposed, the nature of many FXTs remains unknown. One model suggests FXTs are powered by the spin-down of newly formed millisecond magnetars, typically produced by binary neutron star (BNS) mergers. However, the BNS volumetric rate, ~10^2 Gpc^-3 yr^-1, barely overlaps with the estimated FXT rate of 10^3-10^4 Gpc^-3 yr^-1. Even within that overlap, BNS mergers would need to produce FXTs at nearly 100% efficiency. We explore whether other millisecond magnetar formation channels could account for this discrepancy. We compile rate densities for several proposed progenitors: accretion-induced collapse of white dwarfs, binary white dwarf mergers, neutron star-white dwarf mergers, and the collapse of massive stars, and convert Galactic event rates into volumetric rates using either the star formation rate or the stellar mass density distributions as a function of redshift. We find that the highest potential formation rates arise from binary white dwarf mergers and massive star collapses. However, both channels face theoretical and observational challenges: the spin and magnetic field properties of the resulting neutron stars are uncertain, and few are expected to satisfy both conditions required for FXT production. Across all scenarios, the fraction of suitable millisecond magnetars is low or poorly constrained. We conclude that they are unlikely to be the dominant progenitors of FXTs and can contribute to at most 10% of the observed FXT population.

 Context: Solar active regions (ARs) are key manifestations of the Sun's magnetic activity, displaying diverse spatial and temporal characteristics. Their formation and evolution play a crucial role in understanding the solar dynamo and space weather. While individual ARs exhibit significant variability, ensemble averaging offers a method to extract their typical properties and evolution. Aims: This study aims to construct an average bipolar AR using ensemble averaging of observational data. By normalizing ARs in space and time, we seek to identify general trends in the evolution of magnetic flux, velocity fields, and atmospheric emissions, providing insights into the underlying physical mechanisms governing AR development. Methods: We analysed a sample of bipolar ARs observed by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager and Atmospheric Imaging Assembly aboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory. The ARs were selected based on strict criteria, ensuring clear polarity separation and emergence within 60 degrees of the solar central meridian. Normalisation procedures were applied to align ARs spatially and temporally before computing an ensemble average of various observables, including line-of-sight magnetograms, Dopplergrams, and multi-wavelength intensity maps. Results: The average AR exhibits a well-defined evolutionary pattern, with flux emergence followed by peak activity and subsequent decay. The leading polarity retains coherence longer than the trailing one, consistent with previous studies. Surface flow maps revealed a diverging outflow near the emergence site before the emerged AR is clearly visible in magnetograms. Atmospheric emission variations indicate enhanced heating above the AR in later phases, possibly due to persistent reconnection events. The ensemble averaging approach highlights systematic features of AR evolution that are often obscured by individual-case variability.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent data from multiple supernova catalogs and DESI, when combined with CMB, suggest a non-trivial evolution of dark energy (DE) at the $2.5-4\sigma$ CL. This evidence is typically quantified using the CPL parametrization of the DE equation-of-state parameter which corresponds to a first-order Taylor expansion around $a = 1$. However, this truncation is to some extent arbitrary and may bias our interpretation of the data, potentially leading us to mistake spurious features of the best-fit CPL model for genuine physical properties of DE. In this work, we apply the Weighted Function Regression (WFR) method to eliminate the subjectivity associated with the choice of truncation order. We assign Bayesian weights to the various orders and compute weighted posterior distributions of the quantities of interest. Using this model-agnostic approach, we reconstruct some of the most relevant background quantities, examining the robustness of our results against variations in the CMB and SNIa likelihoods. Furthermore, we extend our analysis by allowing for negative DE. Our results corroborate previous indications of dynamical DE, now confirmed for the first time using the WFR method. The combined analysis of CMB, BAO, and SNIa data favors a DE component that transitions from phantom to quintessence at redshift $z_{\rm cross}\sim 0.4$. The probability of phantom crossing lies between 96.21% and 99.97%, depending on the SNIa data set used, and hence a simple monotonic evolution of the DE density is excluded at the $\sim 2-4\sigma$ CL. Moreover, we find no significant evidence for a negative dark energy density below $z\sim 2.5-3$. Our reconstructions do not address the Hubble tension, yielding values of $H_0$ consistent with the Planck/$\Lambda$CDM range. If SH0ES measurements are not affected by systematic biases, the evidence for dynamical dark energy may need to be reassessed.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the Local Group L-Band Survey (LGLBS), a Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) survey producing the highest quality 21-cm and 1-2 GHz radio continuum images to date for the six VLA-accessible, star-forming, Local Group galaxies. Leveraging the VLA's spectral multiplexing power, we simultaneously survey the 21-cm line at high 0.4 km/s velocity resolution, the 1-2 GHz polarized continuum, and four OH lines. For the massive spiral M31, the dwarf spiral M33, and the dwarf irregular galaxies NGC6822, IC10, IC1613, and the Wolf-Lundmark-Melotte Galaxy (WLM), we use all four VLA configurations and the Green Bank Telescope to reach angular resolutions of $< 5''$ ($10{-}20$~pc) for the 21-cm line with $<10^{20}$~cm$^{-2}$ column density sensitivity, and even sharper views ($< 2''$; $5{-}10$~pc) of the continuum. Targeting these nearby galaxies ($D\lesssim1$ Mpc) reveals a sharp, resolved view of the atomic gas, including 21-cm absorption, and continuum emission from supernova remnants and HII regions. These datasets can be used to test theories of the abundance and formation of cold clouds, the driving and dissipation of interstellar turbulence, and the impact of feedback from massive stars and supernovae. Here, we describe the survey design and execution, scientific motivation, data processing, and quality assurance. We provide a first look at and publicly release the wide-field 21-cm HI data products for M31, M33, and four dwarf irregular targets in the survey, which represent some of the highest physical resolution 21-cm observations of any external galaxies beyond the LMC and SMC.

 - **Abstract**
 Dwarf galaxies satellite of the Milky Way are excellent laboratories for testing dark matter (DM) models and baryonic feedback implementation in simulations. The Sculptor 'classical' dwarf spheroidal galaxy, a system with two distinct stellar populations and high-quality data, offers a remarkable opportunity to study DM distributions in these galaxies. In this work, we infer the DM halo density distribution of Sculptor, applying a method based on spherically symmetric distribution functions depending on actions to fit the stellar structural and kinematic properties of Sculptor. The galaxy is represented via four components: two distinct stellar populations based on distribution functions, tracers within a fixed and dominant DM potential, plus the contribution of a third stellar component that accounts for possible sources of contamination. The model-data comparison accounts for the kinematics and metallicities of individual stars, allowing us to assign probabilities of membership to each star. The modeling is applied on the largest available set of spectroscopic data, which have not been previously analyzed with this objective. We find the DM distribution of Sculptor to have a logarithmic inner slope of 0.39+0.23-0.26 and a scale radius of 0.79+0.38-0.17 kpc at 1 sigma confidence level. Our results show that Sculptor DM density profile deviates from predictions of DM-only simulations at a 3 sigma level over a large range of radii. Our analysis suggests that the velocity distribution of Sculptor's two main stellar components is isotropic in the center and becomes radially anisotropic in the outskirts. Additionally, we provide predictions for the projected radial and tangential velocity dispersion profiles. We also present updated DM annihilation and decay J- and D-factors, finding J = 18.15+0.11-0.12 and D = 18.07+0.10-0.10 for an angular aperture of 0.5 degrees.

 - **Abstract**
 The formation of the first stars and galaxies marked the onset of cosmic structure and chemical enrichment, yet direct observations of such primordial systems remain elusive. Here we present James Webb Space Telescope spectroscopic observations of LAP1-B, an ultra-faint galaxy at redshift z_{spec}=6.625 +/-0.001, corresponding to a cosmic age of 800 million years after the Big Bang, strongly magnified by gravitational lensing. LAP1-B exhibits a gas-phase oxygen abundance of (4.2 +/- 1.8) x 10^{-3} times the solar value, making it the most chemically primitive galaxy ever identified at any epoch to date. The galaxy displays an exceptionally hard ionizing radiation field, which is inconsistent with chemically enriched stellar populations or accreting black holes, but consistent with theoretical predictions for zero-metallicity stars. It also shows an elevated carbon-to-oxygen abundance ratio for its metallicity in the interstellar medium, matching nucleosynthetic yields expected from stellar population formed in the absence of initial metals. The lack of detectable stellar continuum constrains the stellar mass to <2700 Msun, while the dynamical mass, derived from emission-line kinematics, exceeds the combined stellar and gas mass by more than two orders of magnitude, indicating the presence of a dominant dark matter halo. These observations establish LAP1-B as the most chemically primitive star-forming galaxy yet identified, offering a rare window into the earliest stages of galaxy formation.

 - **Abstract**
 We present polarization images from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) and the Giant {Metrewave} Radio Telescope (GMRT) at 5.5, 10 GHz and 663 MHz of the changing-look (CL) AGN, NGC3516. A transverse gradient in the rotation measure (RM) is detected in the northern and southern kpc-scale lobes. Such gradients have typically been suggested to be signatures of a helical magnetic (B-) field. We detect circular polarization in the core and inner jet-knot of this source which is known to host a precessing radio jet interacting with emission-line gas. Soft X-ray emission from the Chandra X-ray Observatory suggests the presence of a hot wind emerging from the nucleus of NGC3516. Taken together with the RM gradient, this presents a picture of jet+wind outflow in this Seyfert galaxy with the B-field confining both the jet and lobe emission. A magnetically driven outflow may in turn cause accretion disk warping and jet precession which is observed in the case of NGC3516.

 - **Abstract**
 Atomic hydrogen constitutes the gas reservoir from which molecular gas and star formation in galaxies emerges. However, the weakness of the line means it has been difficult to directly detect in all but the very local Universe. Here we present results from the first search using the MeerKAT International Tiered Extragalactic Exploration (MIGHTEE) Survey for high-redshift ($z>0.25$) H{\sc i} emission from individual galaxies. By searching for 21-cm emission centered on the position and redshift of optically-selected emission-line galaxies we overcome difficulties that hinder untargeted searches. We detect 11 galaxies at $z>0.25$, forming the first sample of $z>0.25$ detections with an interferometer, with the highest redshift detection at $z = 0.3841$. We find they have much larger H{\sc i} masses than their low-redshift H{\sc i}-selected counterparts for a given stellar mass. This can be explained by the much larger cosmological volume probed at these high redshifts, and does not require any evolution of the H{\sc i} mass function. We make the first-ever measurement of the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (bTFr) with H{\sc i} at $z>0.25$ and find consistency with the local bTFr, but with tentative evidence of a flattening in the relation at these redshifts for higher-mass objects. This may signify evolution, in line with predictions from hydrodynamic simulations, or that the molecular gas mass in these high-mass galaxies could be significant. This study paves the way for future studies of H{\sc i} beyond the local Universe, using both searches targeted at known objects and via pure H{\sc i} selection.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmological constraints derived from weak lensing (WL) surveys are limited by baryonic effects, which suppress the non-linear matter power spectrum on small scales. By combining WL measurements with data from external tracers of the gas around massive structures, it is possible to calibrate baryonic effects and, therefore, obtain more precise cosmological constraints. In this study, we generate mock data for a Stage-IV weak lensing survey such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), X-ray gas fractions, and stacked kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) measurements, to jointly constrain cosmological and astrophysical parameters describing baryonic effects (using the Baryon Correction Model - BCM). First, using WL data alone, we quantify the level to which the BCM parameters will need to be constrained to recover the cosmological constraints obtained under the assumption of perfect knowledge of baryonic feedback. We identify the most relevant baryonic parameters and determine that they must be calibrated to a precision of $\sim 10$-$20\%$ to avoid significant degradation of the fiducial WL constraints. We forecast that long-term X-ray data from $\sim 5000$ clusters should be able to reach this threshold for the parameters that characterise the abundance of hot virialised gas. Constraining the distribution of ejected gas presents a greater challenge, however, but we forecast that long-term kSZ data from a CMB-S4-like experiment should achieve the level of precision required for full self-calibration.
