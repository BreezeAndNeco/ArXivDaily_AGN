 - **Abstract**
 At millimeter wavelengths, the atmospheric emission is circularly polarized owing to the Zeeman splitting of molecular oxygen by the Earth's magnetic field. We report a measurement of the signal in the 150 GHz band using 3 years of observations of the \textsc{Polarbear} project. Although the detectors are sensitive to linear polarization, we can measure the circular polarization because a continuously rotating half-wave plate in the optics converts part of circular polarization into linear polarization. The atmospheric circular polarization signal appears as a modulated signal at twice the frequency of rotation of the half-wave plate. We reconstruct the azimuthal gradient of the circular polarization signal and measure the dependencies on the scanning azimuth and the detector bandpass. We compare the signal with a simulation based on atmospheric emission theory, the detector bandpass, and the half-wave plate leakage spectrum model. We find the ratio of the observed azimuthal slope to the simulated slope is $0.92 \pm 0.01\rm{(stat)} \pm 0.07\rm{(sys)}$, which demonstrates that our measurement is consistent with theoretical prediction. This result validates our understanding of the instrument and reinforces the feasibility of measuring the circular polarization using the imperfection of the half-wave plate. Quantifying atmospheric circular polarization is the first step toward conducting a search for cosmological circular polarization at these wavelengths.

 - **Abstract**
 We provide an updated inference of the proper motion of M31 using the Gaia DR3 proper motions of bright stars from the disc of M31. By refining the motion of the quasar reference frame, and statistically accounting for the variations in the inferred proper motions obtained across different regions of M31, we demonstrate that these inconsistencies most likely arise from systematic uncertainties. Our updated favoured values for the proper motion of M31 are 46.9$\pm$11.7(stat)$\pm$50.6(sys)$\mu$as yr$^{-1}$ along the right ascension direction, and -29.1$\pm$9.4(stat)$\pm$35.6(sys)$\mu$as yr$^{-1}$ along the declination direction, the systematics being determined at a 90% confidence level (the values for M33 are given in the paper). This clearly highlights that the systematics are the dominant source of uncertainty, their magnitudes being comparable to the proper motion of M31 itself. The analysis conducted using Gaia DR2 instead of DR3 revealed that a net reduction in these systematic uncertainties occurred between the two data releases. If similar progress is made with the upcoming DR4, the future Gaia-based estimates could match the level of uncertainties of HST, and could be used to refine the dynamics and history of M31 and M33.
#### IceCube AGN Neutrino candidate PKS 1717+177: Dark deflector bends nuclear jet

 - **Abstract**
 The BL Lac Object PKS 1717+177 has been identified as potential neutrino-emitting AGN in the point source stacking analysis of IceCube data. We explore peculiarities in the morphology and kinematics of the jet and examine multi-wavelength light curves for distinctive effects which might allow to pinpoint a likely neutrino generation mechanism. We re-modeled 34 high resolution radio interferometric Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations obtained at 15 GHz (between 1999/12/27 and 2023/05/03). A correlation and periodicity analysis of optical KAIT and Tuorla data, as well as for Fermi-LAT $\gamma$-ray data has been performed. The nuclear jet appears deflected and bent at about 0.5 mas distance from the radio core by an encounter with a dark, unseen object. The deviation of the jet evolves over 23.5 years from a simple apparent bend into a significantly meandering structure with increasing amplitude: a zig-zag line. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the temporal evolution of a jet deviation can be traced. The turning point shifts with time and the jet seems to brighten up almost periodically at the point of deviation. The radio core as well as the jet contribute approximately equally to the total flux-density at 15 GHz. We discuss scenarios which could explain the complex jet bending and quasi-regular flaring. We propose that the jet could either be deflected by the magnetosphere of a second massive black hole, by the pressure gradient due to a circumnuclear dense cloud, or via gravitational lensing by an intervening black hole.
#### The origin and evolution of the [CII]-deficit in HII regions and star-forming molecular clouds

 - **Abstract**
 We analyse synthetic maps of the [CII] 158 $\mu$m line and FIR continuum of simulated molecular clouds (MCs) within the SILCC-Zoom project to study the origin of the [CII]-deficit, i.e., the drop of the [CII]/FIR intensity ratio. All simulations include stellar radiative feedback and account for further ionisation of C$^+$ into C$^{2+}$ inside HII regions. For individual HII regions, $I_\mathrm{FIR}$ is initially high in the vicinity of young stars, and then moderately decreases as the gas is compressed into shells. In contrast, $I_\mathrm{CII}$ drops strongly over time, to which the second ionisation of C$^+$ into C$^{2+}$ contributes. This leads to a strong drop of $I_\mathrm{[CII]}/I_\mathrm{FIR}$ inside HII regions, decreasing from 10$^{-3}$-10$^{-2}$ at scales above 10 pc to 10$^{-6}$-10$^{-4}$ at scales below 2pc. However, projection effects can affect the radial profile of $I_\mathrm{[CII]}$ and $I_\mathrm{FIR}$ and create apparent HII regions without any stars. On MC scales, $L_\mathrm{[CII]}/L_\mathrm{FIR}$ decreases from values $\gtrsim$10$^{-2}$ in MCs without star formation to values around $\sim10^{-3}$ in MCs with star formation. We attribute this and the origin of the [CII]-deficit to two main contributors: (i) the saturation of the [CII] line and (ii) the conversion of C$^+$ into C$^{2+}$ by stellar radiation. The drop of $L_\mathrm{[CII]}/L_\mathrm{FIR}$ can be divided into two phases: (i) early on, the saturation of [CII] and the further ionisation of C$^+$ limit the increase of $L_\mathrm{[CII]}$, while $L_\mathrm{FIR}$ increases rapidly, leading to the initial decline of $L_\mathrm{[CII]}/L_\mathrm{FIR}$. (ii) In more evolved HII regions, $L_\mathrm{CII}$ stagnates and partially even drops due to the aforementioned reasons. $L_\mathrm{FIR}$ stagnates as the gas gets pushed into the cooler shells keeping $L_\mathrm{[CII]}/L_\mathrm{FIR}$ at low values of $\sim10^{-3}$.

 - **Abstract**
 NGC 2506 is a rich, intermediate-age (2.0 Gyr), metal-poor ([Fe/H] $\sim$ -0.2) open cluster. This work presents the results of 12,157 spectroscopic radial-velocity measurements of 2,442 stars in the NGC 2506 field over 41 years, made as part of the WIYN Open Cluster Study. Radial-velocity measurements are complete for the population of proper-motion member stars brighter than a Gaia G magnitude of 15.5, in which 320 proper-motion and radial-velocity cluster members were identified. Within the observation limit of G $<$ 16.5, 469 proper-motion and radial-velocity members were identified. This work reports on the characteristics of NGC 2506, including projected spatial distribution, radial-velocity dispersion, and virial mass. This work also presents orbital solutions for 49 binary members with periods between 1 and 7,580 days. NGC 2506 has an incompleteness-corrected binary frequency for binaries with periods less than $10^4$ days of $35 \pm 5$%. This work also discusses in detail the 14 blue stragglers stars of NGC 2506$\unicode{x2014}$finding at least 64 $\pm$ 21% to be in binaries, 5 yellow straggler stars, and several other stars of note.

 - **Abstract**
 Dust-obscured galaxies (DOGs) are enshrouded by dust, and many are believed to host accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs), which makes them unique objects for probing the coevolution of galaxies and SMBHs. We select and characterize DOGs in the $13\,deg^2$ XMM-Spitzer Extragalactic Representative Volume Survey (XMM-SERVS), leveraging the superb multiwavelength data from X-rays to radio. We select 3738 DOGs at $z\approx1.6-2.1$ in XMM-SERVS, while maintaining good data quality without introducing significant bias. This represents the largest DOG sample with thorough multiwavelength source characterization. Spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling shows DOGs are a heterogeneous population consisting of both normal galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Our DOGs are massive ($\log M_\bigstar/M_\odot\approx10.7-11.3$), 174 are detected in X-rays, and they are generally radio-quiet systems. X-ray detected DOGs are luminous and are moderately to heavily obscured in X-rays. Stacking analyses for the X-ray undetected DOGs show highly significant average detections. Critically, we compare DOGs with matched galaxy populations. DOGs have similar AGN fractions compared with typical galaxy populations. X-ray detected DOGs have higher $M_\bigstar$ and higher X-ray obscuration, but they are not more star-forming than typical X-ray AGNs. The results potentially challenge the relevance of the merger-driven galaxy-SMBH coevolution framework for X-ray detected DOGs.

 - **Abstract**
 Accurately modelling matter power spectrum effects at small scales, such as baryonic feedback, is essential to avoid significant bias in the estimation of cosmological parameters with cosmic shear. However, Stage IV surveys like LSST will be so precise that significant information can still be extracted from large scales alone. In this work, we simulate LSST Y1-like mock data and perform a cosmic shear analysis, considering different models of baryonic feedback. To focus on large scales, we apply physically motivated scale cuts which account for the redshift dependence of the multipoles in the tomographic bin. Our main focus is to study the changes in the constraining power of $S_8$ and $\Omega_m$ parameters and assess possible effects on the tension with Planck measurements. We find that the $S_8$ tension is clearly detectable at $k_{\rm eff}^{\rm max}=0.20\,h\rm Mpc^{-1}$ in the analysis where we imposed a DES-sized tension, and at $k_{\rm eff}^{\rm max}=0.10\,h\rm Mpc^{-1}$ with a KiDS-sized tension, regardless of whether an incorrect model for baryons is assumed. However, to achieve these results, LSST will need high precision measurement of the redshift distributions, with photo-$z$ biases of the order of $10^{-3}$. Without this, the ability to constrain cosmological parameters independently of baryonic feedback - particularly regarding the $S_8$ tension - will be compromised.
#### Characterising the z $\sim$ 7.66 Type-II AGN candidate SMACS S06355 using BEAGLE-AGN and JWST NIRSpec/NIRCam

 - **Abstract**
 The presence of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in low mass (Mstar $\lesssim$ $10^{9}$ Msun) galaxies at high redshift has been established, and it is important to characterise these objects and the impact of their feedback on the host galaxies. In this paper we apply the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) fitting code BEAGLE-AGN to SMACS S06355, a z $\sim$ 7.66 Type-II AGN candidate from the JWST NIRSpec Early Release Observations. This object's spectrum includes a detection of the [NeIV]2426 line, indicating an obscured AGN due to its high ionization potential energy ($\sim$ 63eV). We use BEAGLE-AGN to simultaneously model the Narrow Line Region (NLR) AGN and star-forming galaxy contributions to the observed line fluxes and photometry. Having a high-ionization emission line allows the contribution of the NLR to the remaining lines to be probabilistically disentangled. The HII region metallicity is derived to be 12+log(O/H)$^{\mathrm{HII}}$ = $7.74^{+0.18}_{-0.19}$. Assuming that the Neon-to-Oxygen abundance is similar to solar we derive a high NLR metallicity of 12+log(O/H)$^\mathrm{NLR}$ = $8.77^{+0.14}_{-0.16}$, with the 2$\sigma$ lower-limit extending to 12+log(O/H)$^{\mathrm{NLR}}$ $\sim$ 8.00, showing the derivation is uncertain. We discuss this result with respect to non-solar Neon abundances that might boost the inferred NLR metallicity. The NLR metallicity places SMACS S06355 in a comparable region of the mass-metallicity plane to intermediate (1.5 $\lesssim$ z $\lesssim$ 3.0) redshift obscured AGN. Our derived accretion disc luminosity, log($L_{acc}$ / erg $s^{-1}$) = $45.19^{+0.12}_{-0.11}$, is moderately high yet still uncertain. We highlight that deviations between bolometric luminosity calibrations and model grid tracks become enhanced at low metallicities.

 - **Abstract**
 During the solar cycle, the Sun's magnetic field polarity reverses due to the emergence, cancellation, and advection of magnetic flux towards the rotational poles. Flux emergence events occasionally cluster together, although it is unclear if this is due to the underlying solar dynamo or simply by chance. Regardless of the cause, we aim to characterise how the reversal of the Sun's magnetic field and the structure of the solar corona are influenced by nested flux emergence. From the spherical harmonic decomposition of the Sun's photospheric magnetic field, we identify times when the reversal of the dipole component stalls for several solar rotations. Using observations from sunspot cycle 23 to present, we locate the nested active regions responsible for each stalling and explore their impact on the coronal magnetic field using potential field source surface extrapolations. Nested flux emergence has a more significant impact on the topology of the coronal magnetic field than isolated emergences as it produces a coherent (low spherical harmonic order) contribution to the photospheric magnetic field. The heliospheric current sheet (HCS), that separates oppositely directed coronal magnetic field, can become anchored above these regions due to the formation of strong opposing magnetic fluxes. Further flux emergence, cancellation, differential rotation, and diffusion, then effectively advects the HCS and shifts the dipole axis. Nested flux emergence can restrict the evolution of the HCS and impede the reversal of the coronal magnetic field. The sources of the solar wind can be more consistently identified around nested active regions as the magnetic field topology remains self-similar for multiple solar rotations. This highlights the importance of identifying nested active regions to guide the remote-sensing observations of modern heliophysics missions.

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of gravitational waves (GWs) has provided a new tool to study the Universe, with the scientific return enriched when combined with established probes: electromagnetic (EM) radiation and energetic particles. Since the groundbreaking detection in 2017 of merging neutron stars producing GW emission, a gamma-ray burst and an optical 'kilonova', the field has grown rapidly. At present, no additional neutron star mergers have been jointly detected in GW and EM radiation, but with upgrades in EM and GW facilities now is a chance to take stock of almost a decade of observations. We discuss the motivations for following up GW sources and the basic challenges of searching large areas for a rapidly-evolving EM signal. We examine how the kilonova counterpart to GW170817 was discovered and the association confirmed, and outline some of the key physics enabled by this discovery. We then review the status of EM searches since 2017, highlighting areas where more information (in GW alerts or catalogs) can improve efficiency, and discuss what we have learned about kilonovae despite the lack of further multi-messenger detections. We discuss upcoming facilities and the many lessons learned, considering also how these could inform searches for lensed mergers.
#### A new look at the extragalactic Very High Energy sky: searching for TeV-emitting candidates among the X-ray bright, non-Fermi detected blazar population

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of a multi-wavelength study of blazars selected from the 5th ROMABZCAT catalog. We selected from this sample a subsample of 2435 objects having at least one counterpart in one of the three main archival X-ray catalogs, which is, the fourth release of the XMM-Newton Survey Science Catalogue, the second release of the Chandra Source Catalog, and the second Swift X-ray Point Source catalog of detections by Swift-XRT, or in the recently released eROSITA-DE Data Release 1 catalog. We first searched for different multi-wavelength trends between sources with a Gamma-ray counterpart in the Fermi-LAT 14-year Source Catalog (4FGL-DR4) and sources lacking one. We find that the non-4FGL sources are on average fainter both in the X-rays and in the radio with respect to the 4FGL-detected ones, but the two samples have similar X-ray-to-radio flux ratios, as well as synchrotron peak frequencies. We then focused on the 1007 non-Gamma-ray detected population, to determine if there is a sample of X-ray sources that could be TeV emitters. We find that a large number of sources, mostly BL Lacs or BL Lacs with host-galaxy contribution to the spectral energy distribution, have large synchrotron peak frequency and X-ray to radio flux ratio, two properties that characterize the vast majority of known TeV emitters. With respect to these known TeV emitters, our targets have X-ray fluxes ~1 order of magnitude fainter. We then computed the 0.2-12 keV and 20 GeV - 300 TeV fluxes for the known 5BZCAT TeV emitters, and determined the existence of a direct correlation between X-ray and TeV fluxes in the BL Lacs population. We used this trend to estimate the VHE flux of our targets, and found a promising sample of sources for follow-up observations with current or future, more sensitive, Cherenkov telescopes, first and foremost the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations of a few young pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) have revealed their morphologies in some detail. Given the availability of spatio-spectral-temporal data, we use our multi-zone (1D) leptonic emission code to model the PWNe associated with G29.7-0.3 (Kes 75) and G21.5-0.9 (G21.5) and obtain (by-eye) constraints on additional model parameters compared to spectral-only modelling. Kes 75 is a Galactic composite supernova remnant (SNR) with an embedded pulsar, PSR J1846-0258. X-ray studies reveal rapid expansion of Kes 75 over the past two decades. PWN G21.5 is also a composite SNR, powered by PSR J1833-1034. For Kes 75, we study a sudden plasma bulk speed increase that may be due to the magnetar-like outbursts of the central pulsar. An increase of a few percent in this speed does not result in any significant change in the model outputs. For G21.5, we investigate different diffusion coefficients and pulsar spin-down braking indices. We can reproduce the broadband spectra and X-ray surface brightness profiles for both PWNe, and the expansion rate, flux over different epochs, and X-ray photon index vs epoch and central radius for Kes 75 quite well. The latter three features are also investigated for G21.5. Despite obtaining reasonable fits overall, some discrepancies remain, pointing to further model revision. We find similar values to overlapping parameters between our 1D code and those of an independent 0D dynamical code (TIDE). Future work will incorporate spatial data from various energy wavebands to improve model constraints.

 - **Abstract**
 Quasars are bright active galactic nuclei powered by the accretion of matter around supermassive black holes at the center of galaxies. Their stochastic brightness variability depends on the physical properties of the accretion disk and black hole. The upcoming Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) is expected to observe tens of millions of quasars, so there is a need for efficient techniques like machine learning that can handle the large volume of data. Quasar variability is believed to be driven by an X-ray corona, which is reprocessed by the accretion disk and emitted as UV/optical variability. We are the first to introduce an auto-differentiable simulation of the accretion disk and reprocessing. We use the simulation as a direct component of our neural network to jointly model the driving variability and reprocessing to fit simulated LSST 10-year quasar light curves. The driving variability is reconstructed using a latent stochastic differential equation, a physically motivated, generative deep learning method that can model continuous-time stochastic dynamics. By embedding these physical processes into our network, we achieve a model that is more robust and interpretable. We also use transformers to scale our model to tens of millions of parameters. We demonstrate how our model outperforms a Gaussian process regression baseline and can infer accretion disk parameters and time delays between wavebands, even for out-of-distribution driving signals. Our approach provides a powerful and scalable framework that can be adapted to solve other inverse problems in multivariate time series with irregular sampling.

 - **Abstract**
 Late-stage infall onto evolved protoplanetary discs is an important source of material and angular momentum replenishment, and disc substructures. In this paper we used 3D smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations to model streamer-disc interactions for a prograde streamer. The initially parabolic streamer interacts with the disc material to excite disc eccentricity, which can last on the order of $10^5$ years. We found that the spiral arms the streamer excited in the disc can have a variety of pattern speeds, ranging from stationary to super-Keplerian. Spiral arms with various pattern speeds can exist simultaneously, providing a way to diagnose them in observations. Streamer induced spirals appear similar to those generated by a massive outer companion, where the pitch angle of the spiral increases towards the source of the perturbation. Additionally, the spirals arms can show large and sudden pitch angle changes. Streamer induced spirals are long-lived, lasting approximately $3-4\times$ longer than the initial streamer infall timescale ($\sim$$10^4$ years). After the initial interaction with the disc, a long lasting low $m$ azimuthal mode persists in the disc.

 - **Abstract**
 The existing flare prediction primarily relies on photospheric magnetic field parameters from the entire active region (AR), such as Space-Weather HMI Activity Region Patches (SHARP) parameters. However, these parameters may not capture the details the AR evolution preceding flares. The magnetic structure within the core area of an AR is essential for predicting large solar flares. This paper utilizes the area of high photospheric free energy density (HED region) as a proxy for the AR core region. We construct two datasets: SHARP and HED datasets. The ARs contained in both datasets are identical. Furthermore, the start and end times for the same AR in both datasets are identical. We develop six models for 24-hour solar flare forecasting, utilizing SHARP and HED datasets. We then compare their categorical and probabilistic forecasting performance. Additionally, we conduct an analysis of parameter importance. The main results are as follows: (1) Among the six solar flare prediction models, the models using HED parameters outperform those using SHARP parameters in both categorical and probabilistic prediction, indicating the important role of the HED region in the flare initiation process. (2) The Transformer flare prediction model stands out significantly in True Skill Statistic (TSS) and Brier Skill Score (BSS), surpassing the other models. (3) In parameter importance analysis, the total photospheric free magnetic energy density ($\mathrm {E_{free}}$) within the HED parameters excels in both categorical and probabilistic forecasting. Similarly, among the SHARP parameters, the R_VALUE stands out as the most effective parameter for both categorical and probabilistic forecasting.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the discovery of a second radio flare from the tidal disruption event (TDE) AT2020vwl via long-term monitoring radio observations. Late-time radio flares from TDEs are being discovered more commonly, with many TDEs showing radio emission 1000s of days after the stellar disruption, but the mechanism that powers these late-time flares is uncertain. Here we present radio spectral observations of the first and second radio flares observed from the TDE AT2020vwl. Through detailed radio spectral monitoring, we find evidence for two distinct outflow ejection episodes, or a period of renewed energy injection into the pre-existing outflow. We deduce that the second radio flare is powered by an outflow that is initially slower than the first flare, but carries more energy and accelerates over time. Through modelling the long-term optical and UV emission from the TDE as arising from an accretion disc, we infer that the second radio outflow launch or energy injection episode occurred approximately at the time of peak accretion rate. The fast decay of the second flare precludes environmental changes as an explanation, while the velocity of the outflow is at all times too low to be explained by an off-axis relativistic jet. Future observations that search for any link between the accretion disc properties and late time radio flares from TDEs will aid in understanding what powers the radio outflows in TDEs, and confirm if multiple outflow ejections or energy injection episodes are common.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the effect of data-driving on flux rope eruptivity in magnetic field simulations by analysing fully data-driven modelling results of active region (AR) 12473 and AR11176, as well as preforming relaxation runs for AR12473 (found to be eruptive). Here, the driving is switched off systematically at different time steps. We analyse the behaviour of fundamental quantities, essential for understanding the eruptivity of magnetic flux ropes (MFRs). The data-driven simulations are carried out with the time-dependent magnetofrictional model (TMFM) for AR12473 and AR11176. For the relaxation runs, we employ the magnetofrictional method (MFM) and a zero-beta magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model to investigate how significant the differences between the two relaxation procedures are when started from the same initial conditions. To determine the eruptivity of the MFRs, we calculate characteristic geometric properties, such as the cross-section, MFR height along with stability parameters, such as MFR twist and the decay index. For eruptive cases, we investigate the effect of sustained driving beyond the point of eruptivity on the MFR properties. We find that the fully-driven AR12473 MFR is eruptive while the AR11176 MFR is not. For the relaxation runs, we find that the MFM MFRs are eruptive when the driving is stopped around the flare time or later, while the MHD MFRs show eruptive behaviour even if the driving is switched off one and a half days before the flare occurs. We find that characteristic MFR properties can vary greatly even for the eruptive cases of different relaxation simulations. The results suggest that data driving can significantly influence the evolution of the eruption, with differences appearing even when the relaxation time is set to later stages of the simulation when the MFRs have already entered an eruptive phase.

 - **Abstract**
 Chlorine (Cl) is a chemical element of the group of the halogens and is between the 17th and the 20th most abundant elements in the Solar System. It is thought to be produced from the capture of a proton or neutron by specific alpha-element isotopes during both hydrostatic and explosive oxygen burning, though some contribution may come from Type Ia supernovae. Cl lines are quite rare in stellar spectra, so most of the information available about its abundance comes from analyzing the emission lines of ionized nebulae, especially the collisionally excited lines of Cl2+ ([Cl III] {\lambda}{\lambda}5518,5538). Our goal is to accurately determine the Cl abundance in H II regions, and gather more information about its nucleosynthetic origin. For this work we used a sample of observations that encompasses the deepest spectra of H II regions available in the literature, from both the Milky Way and other galaxies in the local Universe, covering a range of oxygen (O) abundances, 12+log(O/H), from 7.18 to 8.70. As a first step, we determine the most representative electron temperature of the zone of the nebulae where the Cl2+ ion lies. To this aim we used a grid of photoionization models and diagnostics valid for other ions, as that parameter cannot be determined directly through [Cl III] lines. We then computed the total Cl abundance using different sets of ionization correction factors to account for the contribution from unseen ionization stages.

 - **Abstract**
 We present results from data acquired by the SENSEI experiment at SNOLAB after a major upgrade in May 2023, which includes deploying 16 new sensors and replacing the copper trays that house the CCDs with a new light-tight design. We observe a single-electron event rate of $(1.39 \pm 0.11) \times 10^{-5}$ e$^-$/pix/day, corresponding to $(39.8 \pm 3.1)$ e$^-$/gram/day. This is an order-of-magnitude improvement compared to the previous lowest single-electron rate in a silicon detector and the lowest for any photon detector in the near-infrared-ultraviolet range. We use these data to obtain a 90% confidence level upper bound of $1.53 \times 10^{-5}$ e$^-$/pix/day and to set constraints on sub-GeV dark matter candidates that produce single-electron events. We hypothesize that the data taken at SNOLAB in the previous run, with an older tray design for the sensors, contained a larger rate of single-electron events due to light leaks. We test this hypothesis using data from the SENSEI detector located in the MINOS cavern at Fermilab.

 - **Abstract**
 We present JWST/NIRSpec PRISM spectroscopic characterization of GHZ9 at z= 10.145 $\pm$ 0.010, currently the most distant source detected by the Chandra X-ray Observatory. The spectrum reveals several UV high-ionization lines, including CII, SiIV, [NIV], CIV, HeII, OIII], NIII], and CIII]. The prominent rest-frame equivalent widths (EW(CIV)$\simeq$65A, EW(HeII)$\simeq$18A, EW(CIII])$\simeq$48A) show the presence of a hard radiation field, while the analysis of line ratio diagnostics suggest this galaxy hosts both AGN and star-formation activity. GHZ9 is nitrogen-enriched (6--9.5 times solar), carbon-poor (0.2--0.65 times solar), metal-poor (Z = 0.01--0.1 Z$_{\odot}$), and compact ($<$ 106 pc), similarly to GNz11, GHZ2, and recently discovered N-enhanced high redshift objects. We exploited the newly available JWST/NIRSpec and NIRCam dataset to perform an independent analysis of the Chandra data confirming that GHZ9 is the most likely JWST source associated to X-ray emission at 0.5-7 keV. Assuming a spectral index $\Gamma$ = 2.3 (1.8), we estimate a black hole (BH) mass of 1.60 $\pm$ 0.31 (0.48 $\pm$ 0.09) $\times$ 10$^8$M$_{\odot}$, which is consistent either with Eddington-accretion onto heavy ($\geq$ 10$^6$ M$_{\odot}$) BH seeds formed at z=18, or super-Eddington accretion onto a light seed of $\sim$ 10$^2-10^4$ M$_{\odot}$ at z = 25. The corresponding BH-to-stellar mass ratio M$_{BH}$/M$_{star}$= 0.33$\pm$0.22 (0.10$\pm$0.07), with a stringent limit $>$0.02, implies an accelerated growth of the BH mass with respect to the stellar mass. GHZ9 is the ideal target to constrain the early phases of AGN-galaxy coevolution with future multi-frequency observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Radio observations from space allow to characterize solar radio bursts below the ionospheric cutoff, which are otherwise inaccessible, but suffer from low, insufficient temporal resolution. In this Letter we present novel, high-temporal resolution observations of type III solar radio bursts in the range $3-13$ MHz. A dedicated configuration of the Radio and Plasma Waves (RPW) High Frequency Receiver (HFR) on the Solar Orbiter mission, allowing for a temporal resolution as high as $\sim0.07$s (up to 2 orders of magnitude better than any other spacecraft measurements), provides for the very first time resolved measurements of the typical decay time values in this frequency range. The comparison of data with different time resolutions and acquired at different radial distances indicates that discrepancies with decay time values provided in previous studies are only due to the insufficient time resolution not allowing to accurately characterize decay times in this frequency range. The statistical analysis on a large sample of $\sim500$ type III radio bursts shows a power low decay time trend with a spectral index of $-0.75\pm0.03$ when the median values for each frequency are considered. When these results are combined with previous observations, referring to frequencies outside the considered range, a spectral index of $-1.00\pm0.01$ is found in the range $\sim0.05-300$ MHz, compatible with the presence of radio-wave scattering between 1 and 100 R$_{Sun}$.

 - **Abstract**
 We present observations and analysis of an X1.8 non-eruptive solar flare on 2012 October 23, which is characterized by an extremely large late-phase peak seen in the warm coronal extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) emissions ($\sim$ 3 MK), with the peak intensity over 1.4 times that of main flare peak. The flare is driven by a failed eruption of a magnetic flux rope (MFR), whose strong squeeze force acting on the overlying magnetic structures gives rise to an intense early heating of the late-phase loops. Based on differential emission measure (DEM) analysis, it is found that the late-phase loops experience a "longer-than-expected" cooling without the presence of any obvious additional heating, and meanwhile, their volume emission measure (EM) maintains a plateau level for a long time before turning into an evident decay. Without the need for an additional heating, we propose that the special thermodynamic evolution of the late-phase loops revealed in this flare might arise from loop cross-sectional expansions with height, which are evidenced by both direct measurements from EUV images and by magnetic field extrapolation. By blocking the losses of both heat flux and mass from the corona, such an upward cross-sectional expansion not only elongates the loop cooling time, but also more effectively sustains the loop density, therefore leading to a later-than-expected occurrence of the warm coronal late phase in combination with a sufficiently high late-phase peak. We further verify such a scenario by analytically solving the cooling process of a late-phase loop characterized by a variable cross section.

 - **Abstract**
 The study of massive binary systems has steadily progressed over the past decades, with increasing focus on their evolution, interactions and mergers, driven by improvements in computational modelling and observational techniques. In particular, when a binary system involves a massive giant and a neutron star (NS) or a black hole (BH) that go through common envelope evolution (CEE), it might results in the merger of the compact object with the core of its giant companion, giving rise to various high energy astrophysical phenomena. We review the different evolutionary channels that lead to compact objects-core mergers, key physical processes with emphasis on the role of accretion physics, feasibility of r-process nucleosynthesis, expected observable electromagnetic, neutrinos and gravitational-waves (GWs) signatures, as well as potential correlation with detected core collapse supernovae (CCSNe), luminous fast blue optical transients (LFBOTs) and low luminosity long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs). After presenting our current understanding of these mergers, we conclude discussing prospects for future advancements.

 - **Abstract**
 The Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) channel for the formation of binary black hole (BBH) mergers has been previously studied as a potential formation channel for the merging compact binaries observed by the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (LVK) scientific collaboration. The first two papers in this series explored the McFACTS code for the evolution of black hole orbits in AGN accretion disks for individual galaxy models and described the characteristics of predicted BBH populations in realizations of those models (such as the correlation between mass ratio and aligned spin). In this work, we explore the impact of the properties of AGN host galaxies and assume an AGN lifetime and cosmological model for the density of AGN in a universe like our own. By sampling from an inferred population of AGN, we marginalize over galaxy mass to predict a population of BBH mergers observable by modern ground-based gravitational wave observatories. We find that for reasonable assumptions, AGN disk environments may account for massive BBH mergers such as GW190521 and GW190929_012149. We find that the majority of observable BBH mergers from our simulation are expected to originate in galaxies with a super-massive black hole between $10^{7}M_{\odot}$ and $10^{9.4}M_{\odot}$. We also find that if hierarchical mergers from AGN disks account for a substantial part of the LVK population, our current models require an AGN lifetime of 0.5 to 2.5 Myr.

 - **Abstract**
 The study of the X-ray emission from massive binaries constitutes a relevant approach to investigate shock physics. The case of short period binaries may turn out to be quite challenging, especially in very asymmetric systems where the primary wind may overwhelm that of the secondary in the wind interaction. Our objective consists in providing an observational diagnostic of the X-ray behaviour of HD93205, that is a very good candidate to investigate these aspects. We analysed 31 epochs of XMM-Newton X-ray data spanning about two decades to investigate its spectral and timing behaviour. The X-ray spectrum is very soft along the full orbit, with a luminosity exclusively from the wind interaction region in the range of 2.3 -- 5.4\,$\times$10$^{32}$\,erg\,s$^{-1}$. The light curve peaks close to periastron, with a rather wide pre-periastron low-state coincident with the secondary's body hiding a part of the X-ray emitting region close to its surface. We determined a variability time scale of 6.0807\,$\pm$\,0.0013\,d, in full agreement with the orbital period. Making use of a one-dimensional approach to deal with mutual radiative effects, our results point to a very likely hybrid wind interaction, with a wind-photosphere occurring along most of the orbit, while a brief episode of wind-wind interaction may still develop close to apastron. Beside mutual radiative effects, the radiative nature of the shock that leads to some additional pre-shock obliquitity of the primary wind flow certainly explains the very soft emission. HD93205 constitutes a relevant target to investigate shock physics in short period, asymmetric massive binary systems, where various mutual radiative effects and radiative shocks concur to display an instructive soft X-ray behaviour. HD93205 should be considered as a valid, though challenging target for future three-dimensional modelling initiatives.

 - **Abstract**
 Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are responsible for strong mid-IR emission features near star-forming regions. It is well known that low-metallicity environments exhibit weaker PAH emission, but it is not clear how the metallicity affects the properties of the emitting PAH population. We present a detailed study of the PAH emission in the low-metallicity regime represented by 30 Dor in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and we compare it to the PAH emission in the Orion Bar to investigate the characteristics of the PAH population and how the environments affects the resulting IR emission. We analyze JWST observations of 30 Dor that include imaging (NIRCam, MIRI) and spectroscopy (NIRSpec/IFU, MIRI/MRS). We extracted NIRSpec/IFU and MIRI/MRS spectra from 18 apertures that cover the morphological structures of 30 Dor. We characterize the profiles and relative intensities of PAH emission in these apertures. The detailed profiles of the PAH emission bands in 30 Dor are all very similar, and compare well to those from one of the dissociation fronts (DF2) in the Orion Bar. The relative band ratios on the other hand show a much larger range than in the Orion Bar. The PAH emission in 30 Dor originates from a population with a higher ionization fraction than in the Orion Bar, and a size distribution that has more smaller PAHs. Since smaller PAHs typically photo-fragment before larger PAHs, our findings support the hypothesis that the lower PAH emission for lower metallicities is the result of inhibition of growth toward larger PAHs rather than photo-fragmentation.

 - **Abstract**
 Young star-forming regions in massive environments are ideal test beds to study the influence of surroundings on the evolution of disks around low-mass stars. We explore two distant young clusters, IC 1848-East and West located in the massive W5 complex. These clusters are unique due to their similar (distance, age, and extinction) yet distinct (stellar density and FUV radiation fields) physical properties. We use deep multi-band photometry in optical, near-IR, and mid-IR wavelengths complete down to the substellar limit in at least five bands. We trace the spectral energy distribution of the sources to identify the young pre-main sequence members in the region and derive their physical parameters. The disk fraction for the East and West clusters down to 0.1 M$_\odot$ was found to be $\sim$27$\pm$2% (N$_{disk}$=184, N$_{diskless}$=492) and $\sim$17$\pm$1% (N$_{disk}$=173, N$_{diskless}$=814), respectively. While no spatial variation in the disk fraction is observed, these values are lower than those in other nearby young clusters. Investigating the cause of this decrease, we find a correlation with the intense feedback from massive stars throughout the cluster area. We also identified the disk sources undergoing accretion and observed the mass accretion rates to exhibit a positive linear relationship with the stellar host mass and an inverse relationship with stellar age. Our findings suggest that the environment significantly influences the dissipation of disks in both clusters. These distant clusters, characterized by their unique attributes, can serve as templates for future studies in outer galaxy regions, offering insights into the influence of feedback mechanisms on star and planetary formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The formation of stars has been subject to extensive studies in the past decades from molecular cloud to protoplanetary disk scales. It is still not fully understood how the surrounding material in a protostellar system, that often shows asymmetric structures with complex kinematic properties, feeds the central protostar(s) and their disk(s). Aims. We study the spatial morphology and kinematic properties of the molecular gas surrounding the IRS3A and IRS3B protostellar systems in the L1448N region located in the Perseus molecular cloud. Methods. We present 1 mm NOEMA observations of the PRODIGE large program and analyze the kinematic properties of molecular lines. Given the complexity of the spectral profiles, the lines are fitted with up to three Gaussian velocity components. The clustering algorithm DBSCAN is used to disentangle the velocity components into the underlying physical structure. Results. We discover an extended gas bridge (~3000 au) surrounding both the IRS3A and IRS3B systems in six molecular line tracers (C18O, SO, DCN, H2CO, HC3N, and CH3OH). This gas bridge is oriented along the northeast-southwest direction and shows clear velocity gradients on the order of 100 km/s/pc towards the IRS3A system. We find that the observed velocity profile is consistent with analytical streamline models of gravitational infall towards IRS3A. The high-velocity C18O (2-1) emission towards IRS3A indicates a protostellar mass of ~1.2 Msun. Conclusions. While high angular resolution continuum data often show IRS3A and IRS3B in isolation, molecular gas observations reveal that these systems are still embedded within a large-scale mass reservoir with a complex spatial morphology as well as velocity profiles. The kinematic properties of the extended gas bridge are consistent with gravitational infall toward the IRS3A protostar.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent studies of high-redshift galaxies using JWST, such as GN-z11 revealed highly elevated levels of nitrogen (N). This phenomenon extends to gravitationally-lensed galaxies like the Sunburst Arc at z = 2.37, as well as to globular clusters (GCs). We propose that this originates from the presence of very massive stars (VMSs) with masses ranging from 100 to 1000\,\Msun. The He {\sc ii} observed in the Sunburst Arc could also stem from the disproportionately large contribution of VMSs. We build an entirely new Framework for massive star evolution which is no longer set by Dutch or other mass-loss "recipes" but which take the physics of $\Gamma$ or $L/M$-dependent winds into account. We discuss the mass-loss kink and the transition mass-loss rate between optically thin and thick winds, before we study the evaporative mass-loss history of VMSs. Our novel evolution models exhibit vertical evolution in the HR-diagram from the zero-age main sequence due to a self-regulatory effect driven by their wind-dominated nature, and we discuss what wind physics sets the stellar upper-mass limit. Our estimate for the Sunburst Arc in Vink (2023) suggests that the significant amounts of N found in star-forming galaxies likely arise from VMSs. We evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of previous hypotheses, including fast rotating massive stars and supermassive stars (SMSs), and we conclude that only our VMS model satisfies the relevant criteria. Finally, we advocate for the inclusion of VMSs in population synthesis and chemical evolution models, emphasizing the need for a self-consistent wind approach, which currently does not exist. Even minor inaccuracies in mass-loss rates dramatically impact the stellar evolution of VMS, as well as their ionizing and chemical feedback.
