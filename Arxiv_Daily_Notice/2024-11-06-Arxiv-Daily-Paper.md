#### Induced Compton scattering in magnetized electron and positron pair plasma

 - **Abstract**
 A formulation for the parametric instability of electromagnetic (EM) waves in magnetized pair plasma is developed. The linear growth rate of induced Compton scattering is derived analytically for frequencies below the cyclotron frequency for the first time. We identify three modes of density fluctuation: ordinary, charged, and neutral modes. In the charged mode, the ponderomotive force separates charges (electrons and positrons) longitudinally, in contrast to the nonmagnetized case. We also recognize two effects that significantly reduce the scattering rate for waves polarized perpendicular to the magnetic field: (1) the gyroradius effect due to the magnetic suppression of particle orbits, and (2) Debye screening for wavelengths larger than the Debye length. Applying this to fast radio bursts (FRBs), we find that these effects facilitate the escape of X-mode waves from the magnetosphere and outflow of a magnetar and neutron star, enabling 100\% polarization as observed. Our formulation provides a foundation for consistently addressing the nonlinear interaction of EM waves with magnetized plasma in astrophysics and laser physics.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive star-forming regions exhibit a rich chemistry with complex gas distributions, especially on small scales. While surveys have yielded constraints on typical gas conditions, they often have coarse spatial resolution and limited bandwidths. Thus, to establish an interpretative framework for these efforts, detailed observations that simultaneously provide high sensitivity, spatial resolution, and large bandwidths for a subset of diverse sources are needed. Here, we present wideband (32 GHz) Submillimeter Array observations of four high-mass star-forming regions (G28.20-0.05, G20.08-0.14 N, G35.58-0.03, W33 Main) at subarcsecond resolution, where we detect and spatially-resolve 100s of lines from over 60 molecules, including many complex organic molecules (COMs). The chemical richness of our sample is consistent with an evolutionary sequence from the line-rich hot cores and HC HII regions of G28.20-0.05 and G20.08-0.14 N to the more chemically-modest UC HII regions in G35.58-0.03, followed by the molecule-poor HII region W33 Main. We detect lines across a range of excitation conditions (Eu=20 to >800 K) and from numerous isotopologues, which enables robust estimates of gas properties. We derive nearly constant COM column density ratios that agree with literature values in other low- and high-mass protostellar cores, supporting the idea that COM abundances are set during the pre-stellar phase. In all regions, we identify spatial offsets among different molecular families, due to a combination of source physical structure and chemistry. In particular, we find potential evidence of carbon grain sublimation in G28.20-0.05 and identify an elemental oxygen gradient and rich sulfur-chemistry in G35.58-0.03. Overall, these results demonstrate that the SMA's wide bandwidth is a powerful tool to untangle the complex molecular gas structures associated with massive star formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Classical Wolf-Rayet stars are descendants of massive OB-type stars that have lost their hydrogen-rich envelopes, and are in the final stages of stellar evolution, possibly exploding as type Ib/c supernovae. It is understood that the mechanisms driving this mass-loss are either strong stellar winds and or binary interactions, so intense studies of these binaries including their evolution can tell us about the importance of the two pathways in WR formation. WR 138 (HD 193077) has a period of just over 4 years and was previously reported to be resolved through interferometry. We report on new interferometric data combined with spectroscopic radial velocities in order to provide a three-dimensional orbit of the system. The precision on our parameters tend to be about an order of magnitude better than previous spectroscopic techniques. These measurements provide masses of the stars, namely $M_{\rm WR} = 13.93\pm1.49M_{\odot}$ and $M_{\rm O} = 26.28\pm1.71M_{\odot}$. The derived orbital parallax agrees with the parallax from \textit{Gaia}, namely with a distance of 2.13 kpc. We compare the system's orbit to models from BPASS, showing that the system likely may have been formed with little interaction but could have formed through some binary interactions either following or at the start of a red supergiant phase, but with the most likely scenario occurring as the red supergiant phase starts for a $\sim 40M_\odot$ star.
#### On The Influence Of The Solar Wind On The Propagation Of Earth-impacting Coronal Mass Ejections

 - **Abstract**
 Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) are subject to changes in their direction of propagation, tilt, and other properties as they interact with the variable solar wind. We investigated the heliospheric propagation of 15 Earth-impacting CMEs observed during April 2010 to August 2018 in the field of view (FOV) of the Heliospheric Imager (HI) onboard the STEREO. About half of the 15 events followed self-similar expansion up to 40 $R_\odot$. The remaining events showed deflection either in latitude, longitude, or a tilt change. Only two events showed significant rotation in the HI1 FOV. We also use toroidal and cylindrical flux rope fitting on the in situ observations of interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) and solar wind parameters to estimate the tilt at L1 for these two events. Although the sample size is small, this study suggests that CME rotation is not very common in the heliosphere. We attributed the observed deflections and rotations of CMEs to a combination of factors, including their interaction with the ambient solar wind and the influence of the ambient magnetic field. These findings contribute to our understanding of the complex dynamics involved in CME propagation and highlight the need for comprehensive modeling and observational studies to improve space weather prediction. In particular, HI observations help us to connect observations near the Sun and near Earth, improving our understanding of how CMEs move through the heliosphere.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The influence of magnetic fields on stellar evolution remains unresolved. It has been proposed that if there is a large-scale magnetic field in the stellar interior, torsional waves could arise, efficiently transporting angular momentum. In fact, the observed variations in the rotation periods of some magnetic stars may be attributed to these torsional waves' standing waves. Aims. To demonstrate the existence of torsional waves through modeling of the rotational period variations. Method. We conduct an eigenmode analysis of standing waves based on one-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic equations. The internal magnetic field structures are parametrically represented to treat poloidal fields with different degrees of central/surface concentration. The obtained frequencies are compared with the observed frequencies of the rotational period variations, thereby constraining the internal magnetic field structures. Results. The 67.6 years exhibited by CU Vir is reproduced for surface-concentrated magnetic field structures. The rotational period variations of all ten magnetic stars analyzed in this study are inconsistent with a centrally concentrated magnetic field. Conclusions. Torsional waves can reproduce the observations of rotational period variations. The large-scale magnetic fields within magnetic stars would be concentrated on the surface.
#### A High-Resolution Far-Infrared Survey to Probe Black Hole-Galaxy Co-Evolution

 - **Abstract**
 Far-infrared (FIR) surveys are critical to probing the co-evolution of black holes and galaxies, since of order half the light from accreting black holes and active star formation is emitted in the rest-frame infrared over $0.5\lesssim z \lesssim 10$. For deep fields with areas of 1 deg$^2$ or less, like the legacy surveys GOODS, COSMOS, and CANDELS, source crowding means that sub-arcsecond resolution is essential. In this paper we show with a simulation of the FIR sky that measurements made with a small telescope (2 m) at low angular resolution yield biased results, and we demonstrate the scientific value of a space mission that would offer sub-arcsecond resolution. We envisage a facility that would provide high-resolution imaging and spectroscopy over the wavelength range $25-400\,\mu$m, and we present predictions for an extragalactic survey covering $0.5\,\hbox{deg}^2$. Such a survey is expected to detect tens of thousands of star-forming galaxies and thousands of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), in multiple FIR lines (e.g. [CII], [OI], [CI]) and continuum. At the longest wavelengths (200-400$\,\mu$m), it would probe beyond the reionization epoch, up to $z\sim 7$-8. A combination of spectral resolution, line sensitivity, and broad spectral coverage would allow us to learn about the physical conditions (temperature, density, metallicity) characterizing the interstellar medium of galaxies over the past $\sim 12$ billion years and to investigate galaxy-AGN co-evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 The CNO cycle is the main source of energy in stars more massive than our Sun. It defines the energy production and the duration contributes in determining the lifetime of massive stars. The cycle is an important tool for the determination of the age of globular clusters. Radiative capture p plus 14N 15O plus {\gamma}, at energies of astrophysical interest, is one of the important processes in the CNO cycle. In this project, we apply a potential model to describe both non resonant and resonant reactions in the channels where radiative capture occurs through electric E1 transitions. We employed the R matrix method to describe the reactions going via M1 resonant transitions, when it was not possible to correctly reproduce the experimental data by a potential model. The partial components of the astrophysical S factor are calculated for all possible electric and magnetic dipole transitions in 15O. The linear extrapolated S factor at zero energy (S(0)) is in good agreement with earlier reported values for all types of transitions considered in this work. Based on the value of the total astrophysical S factor, depending on the collision energy, we calculate the nuclear reaction rates for p plus 14N 15O plus {\gamma}. The computed rates are in good agreement with the results of the NACRE II Collaboration and the most recent existing measurements.
#### The X-ray re-brightening of GRB afterglow revisited: a possible signature from activity of the central engine

 - **Abstract**
 Long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are thought to be from core collapse of massive stars, and a rapidly spinning magnetar or black hole may be formed as the central engine. The extended emission in the prompt emission, flares and plateaus in X-ray afterglow, are proposed to be as the signature of central engine re-activity. However, the directly evidence from observations of identifying the central engines remain an open question. In this paper, we systemically search for long-duration GRBs that consist of bumps in X-ray afterglow detected by Swift/XRT, and find that the peak time of the X-ray bumps exhibit bimodal distribution (defined as early and late bumps) with division line at $t=7190$ s. Although we cannot rule out that such a bimodality arises from selection effects. We proposed that the long-duration GRBs with an early (or late) bumps may be originated from the fall-back accretion onto a new-born magnetar (or black hole). By adopting MCMC method to fit the early (or late) bumps of X-ray afterglow with the fall-back accretion of magnetar (or black hole), it is found that the initial surface magnetic filed and period of magnetars for most early bumps are clustered around $5.88\times10^{13}$ G and $1.04$ ms, respectively. Meanwhile, the derived accretion mass of black hole for late bumps is range of $[4\times10^{-4}, 1.8\times10^{-2}]~M_{\odot}$, and the typical fall-back radius is distributed range of $[1.04, 4.23]\times 10^{11}$ cm which is consistent with the typical radius of a Wolf-Rayet star. However, we also find that the fall-back accretion magnetar model is disfavored by the late bumps, but the fall-back accretion of black hole model can not be ruled out to interpret the early bumps of X-ray afterglow.

 - **Abstract**
 The evolution and distribution of metals within galaxies are critical for understanding galactic evolution and star formation processes, but the mechanisms responsible for shaping this distribution remain uncertain. In this study we carry out high-resolution simulations of an isolated Milky Way-like galaxy, including a star-by-star treatment of both feedback and element injection. We include seven key isotopes of observational and physical interest, and which are distributed across different nucleosynthetic channels. After running the simulations to statistical steady state, we examine the spatial and temporal statistics of the metal distributions and their fluctuations. We show that these statistics reflect a mixture properties dependent on the large-scale structure of the galaxy and those that vary depending on the particular nucleosynthetic channel that dominates production of a particular isotope. The former ensure that different elements are highly-correlated with one another even if they have different nucleosynthetic origins, and their spatial correlations vary together in time. The latter means that the small variations between elements that are present naturally break them into nucleosynthetic familiars, with elements that originate from different channels correlating better with each other than with elements with different origins. Our findings suggest both challenges and opportunities for ongoing efforts to use chemical measurements of gas and stars to unravel the history and physics of galaxy assembly.

 - **Abstract**
 The magnetic chemically peculiar Ap stars exhibit an extreme spread of rotational velocities, the reason of which is not well understood. Ap stars with rotational periods of 50 days or longer are know as super-slowly rotating Ap (ssrAp) stars. Photometrically variable Ap stars are commonly termed alpha2 Canum Venaticorum (ACV) variables. Our study aims at enlarging the sample of known ssrAp stars using data from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) survey to enable more robust and significant statistical studies of these objects. Using selection criteria based on the known characteristics of ACV variables, candidate stars were gleaned from the ZTF catalogues of periodic and suspected variable stars and from ZTF raw data. ssrAp stars were identified from this list via their characteristic photometric properties, Delta a photometry, and spectral classification. The final sample consists of 70 new ssrAp stars, which mostly exhibit rotational periods between 50 and 200 days. The object with the longest period has a rotational period of 2551.7 days. We present astrophysical parameters and a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram for the complete sample of known ssrAp stars. With very few exceptions, the ssrAp stars are grouped in the middle of the main sequence with ages in excess of 150 Myr. ZTF J021309.72+582827.7 was identified as a possible binary star harbouring an Ap star and a cool component, possibly shrouded in dust. With our study, we enlarge the sample of known ssrAp stars by about 150%, paving the way for more in-depth statistical studies.

 - **Abstract**
 Small-scale brightenigs are ubiquitous, dynamic and energetic phenomena found in the chromopshere. An advanced filter-detection algorithm applied to high-resolution observations from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph enables the detection of these brightenings close to the noise level. This algorithm also tracks the movement of these brightenings and extracts their characteristics. This work outlines the results of an in-depth analysis of a quiet-Sun dataset including a comparison of a brighter domain - associated with a super-granular boundary - to the quiescent inter-network domains. Several characteristics of brightenings from both domains are extracted and analysed, providing a range of sizes, durations, brightness values, travel distances, and speeds. The ``Active" quiet-Sun events tend to travel shorter distances and at slower speeds along the plane-of-sky than their ``True" quiet-Sun counterparts. These results are consistent with the magnetic field model of super-granular photospheric structures and the magnetic canopy model of the chromosphere above. Spectroscopic analyses reveal that BPs demonstrate blue-shift (as well as some bi-directionality) and that they may rise from the chromosphere into the TR. We believe these bright points to be magnetic in nature, are likely the result of magnetic reconnection, and follow current sheets between magnetic field gradients, rather than along magnetic field lines themselves.
#### Intergalactic magnetism in a gamma-ray beam as a model of Porphyrion

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.01640

 - **Abstract**
 We estimate the magnetic field in the jets of the recently discovered 7 Mpc long Porphyrion system. We use non-detection of the system in gamma-rays to derive a lower bound on the co-moving magnetic field strength at the level of ~10 nG. This value is consistent with recent estimates of magnetic fields in the filaments of the Large Scale Structure. We discuss the possibility that, instead of being the extreme case of a radio jet formation scenario, Porphyrion actually traces a very-high-energy gamma-ray beam emitted by an active galactic nucleus. In such a model, jets do not need to spread into the voids of the Large Scale Structure to appear straight on a very large distance range, and several anomalies of the standard radio jet scenarios can be solved at once.
#### Constraining the excitation of molecular gas in Two Quasar-Starburst Systems at $z \sim 6$

 - **Abstract**
 We present NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array observations of CO(8-7), (9-8), and (10-9) lines, as well as the underlying continuum for two far-infrared luminous quasars: SDSS J2054-0005 at $\rm z=6.0389$ and SDSS J0129-0035 at $\rm z=5.7788$. Both quasars were previously detected in CO (2-1) and (6-5) transitions, making them candidates for studying the CO Spectral Line Energy Distribution (SLED) of quasars at $z \sim 6$. Utilizing the radiative transfer code CLOUDY, we fit the CO SLED with two heating mechanisms, including the photo-dissociation region (PDR) and X-ray-dominated region (XDR) for both objects. The CO SLEDs can be fitted by either a dense PDR component with an extremely strong far-ultraviolet radiation field (gas density $ n_{\rm H} \sim 10^6 \, \rm cm^{-3}$ and field strength $G_0 \gtrsim 10^6$) or a two-component model including a PDR and an XDR. However, the line ratios, including \tir and previous \cii and \ci measurements, argue against a very high PDR radiation field strength. Thus, the results prefer a PDR+XDR origin for the CO SLED. The excitation of the high-J CO lines in both objects is likely dominated by the central AGN. We then check the CO (9-8)-to-(6-5) line luminosity ratio $r_{96}$ for all $z \sim 6$ quasars with available CO SLEDs (seven in total) and find that there are no clear correlations between $r_{96}$ and both \fir and the AGN UV luminosities. This further demonstrates the complexity of the CO excitation powered by both the AGN and nuclear star formation in these young quasar host galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Band 7 observations of the CO (J=3-2) line emission of the protostellar system HH 212 at $\sim$24 au spatial resolution and compare them to those of the SiO (J=8-7) and SO (J=8-7) line emission reported in the literature. We find that the CO line traces four distinct regions: (1) an outer outflow shell, (2) a rotating wind region between the SiO and CO shells, (3) the shocked and wide-angle inner X-wind inside a SiO shell, and (4) the jet. The origin of the CO outer outflow shell could be associated with the entrained material of the envelope, or an extended disk wind. The rotating wind, which is shocked, is launched from a radius of 9-15 au, slightly exterior to that of the previously detected SO shell, which marks the boundary where the wide-angle X-wind is interacting with and shocking the disk wind. Additionally, the SO is found to be mixed with the CO emission within the thick and extended rotating wind region. The large scale CO shocked wind coexists with the SO emission near the upper portion of the inner shocked region converged on top of the inner SiO knots. The CO jet is traced by a chain of knots with roughly equal interval, exhibiting quasi-periodicity, as reported in other jets in the literature.

 - **Abstract**
 The Ultra Violet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) onboard India's first dedicated multiwavelength satellite \textit{AstroSat} observed a significant fraction of the sky in the ultraviolet with a spatial resolution of 1.4\arcsec. We present a catalog of the point sources observed by UVIT in the far ultraviolet (FUV; 1300-1800 Å) and near ultraviolet (NUV; 2000-3000 Å). We carried out astrometry and photometry of 428 field pointings in the FUV and 54 field pointings in the NUV band, observed in 5 filter bands in each channel respectively, covering an area of about 63 square degrees. The final catalog contains about 102,773 sources. The limiting magnitude(AB) of the F148W band filter, that has the largest number of detections is $\sim21.3$. For the NUV channel, we find the limiting magnitude at around $\sim23$. We describe the final catalog and present the results of the statistical analysis.

 - **Abstract**
 The radio galaxy NGC 1275, located at the central region of Perseus cluster, is a well-known very high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray emitter. The Major Atmospheric Cherenkov Experiment Telescope has detected two distinct episodes of VHE (E > 80 GeV) gamma-ray emission from NGC 1275 during 2022 December and 2023 January. The second outburst, observed on 2023 January 10, was the more intense of the two, with flux reaching 58$\%$ of the Crab Nebula flux above 80 GeV. The differential energy spectrum measured between 80 GeV and 1.5 TeV can be described by a power law with a spectral index of $\Gamma = - 2.90 \pm 0.16_{stat}$ for both flaring events. The broadband spectral energy distribution derived from these flares, along with quasisimultaneous low-energy counterparts, suggests that the observed gamma-ray emission can be explained using a homogeneous single-zone synchrotron self-Compton model. The physical parameters derived from this model for both flaring states are similar. The intermediate state observed between two flaring episodes is explained by a lower Doppler factor or magnetic field, which subsequently returned to its previous value during the high-activity state observed on 2023 January 10.

 The center-to-limb variations (CLV) of transition region line Gaussian fit parameters in solar plage are reported for the first time. The Si iv 1402.77 A line observed by Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) is used. The spectral intensity increases linearly from the disk center to the solar limb. Similarly, the non-thermal velocity also increases linearly from 23.6 km/s (at the disk center) to 30.9 km/s (at the solar limb). On the other hand, the Doppler velocity decreases from 8.9$\pm$1.0 km/s at the disk center to 0.0 km/s at the limb. This CLV pattern in solar plages is consistent with the CLV pattern reported in the quiet-Sun (QS). However, the average values of the parameters in the solar plage are significantly higher than in the QS. The intensity and non-thermal velocity increase linearly with the magnetic field at the disk center while the Doppler velocity does not depend on the magnetic field. Due to the line-of-sight effect, the plasma column depth increases towards the solar limb which leads to a linear increase in the spectral intensity. Further, the increasing plasma column depth towards the solar limb adds more and more unresolved motions, and as a result, the non-thermal velocity increases from the disk center to the solar limb. In the solar plages, the higher plasma density due to the strong magnetic field leads to the higher intensity and non-thermal velocity compared to QS and coronal hole (CH)

 We present 850 $\mu$m polarization observations of the IC 348 star-forming region in the Perseus molecular cloud as part of the B-fields In STar-forming Region Observation (BISTRO) survey. We study the magnetic properties of two cores (HH 211 MMS and IC 348 MMS) and a filamentary structure of IC 348. We find that the overall field tends to be more perpendicular than parallel to the filamentary structure of the region. The polarization fraction decreases with intensity, and we estimate the trend by power-law and the mean of the Rice distribution fittings. The power indices for the cores are much smaller than 1, indicative of possible grain growth to micron size in the cores. We also measure the magnetic field strengths of the two cores and the filamentary area separately by applying the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method and its alternative version for compressed medium. The estimated mass-to-flux ratios are 0.45-2.20 and 0.63-2.76 for HH 211 MMS and IC 348 MMS, respectively, while the ratios for the filament is 0.33-1.50. This result may suggest that the transition from subcritical to supercritical conditions occurs at the core scale ($\sim$ 0.05 pc) in the region. In addition, we study the energy balance of the cores and find that the relative strength of turbulence to the magnetic field tends to be stronger for IC 348 MMS than HH 211 MMS. The result could potentially explain the different configurations inside the two cores: a single protostellar system in HH 211 MMS and multiple protostars in IC 348 MMS.

 - **Abstract**
 Aims. Our goal is twofold. First, to detect new clusters we apply the newest methods for the detection of clustering with the best available wide-field sky surveys in the mid-infrared because they are the least affected by extinction. Second, we address the question of cluster detection's completeness, for now limiting it to the most massive star clusters. Methods. This search is based on the mid-infrared Galactic Legacy Infrared Mid Plane Survey Extraordinaire (GLIMPSE), to minimize the effect of dust extinction. The search Ordering Points To Identify the Clustering Structure (OPTICS) clustering algorithm is applied to identify clusters, after excluding the bluest, presumably foreground sources, to improve the cluster-to-field contrast. The success rate for cluster identification is estimated with a semi-empirical simulation that adds clusters, based on the real objects, to the point source catalog, to be recovered later with the same search algorithm that was used in the search for new cluster candidates. As a first step, this is limited to the most massive star clusters with a total mass of 104 $M_\odot$. Results. Our automated search, combined with inspection of the color-magnitude diagrams and images yielded 659 cluster candidates; 106 of these appear to have been previously identified, suggesting that a large hidden population of star clusters still exists in the inner Milky Way. However, the search for the simulated supermassive clusters achieves a recovery rate of 70 to 95%, depending on the distance and extinction toward them. Conclusions. The new candidates, if confirmed, indicate that the Milky Way still harbors a sizeable population of still unknown clusters. However, they must be objects of modest richness, because our simulation indicates that there is no substantial hidden population of supermassive clusters in the central region of our Galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the activity evolution of the main-belt comet 324P/La Sagra over time and the properties of its emitted dust. We performed aperture photometry on images taken by a wide range of telescopes at optical and thermal infrared wavelengths between 2010 and 2021. We derived the combined scattering cross section of the nucleus and dust (when present) as a function of time, and we derived the thermal emission properties. Fitting an IAU H-G phase function to the data obtained when 324P was likely inactive, we derived an absolute nucleus magnitude $H_R = (18.4 \pm 0.5)$ mag using $G = 0.15 \pm 0.12$. The activity of 324P/La Sagra during the 2015 perihelion passage has significantly decreased compared to the previous perihelion passage in 2010, and it decreased even further during the 2021 perihelion passage. This decrease in activity may be attributed to mantling or to the depletion of volatile substances. The $Af\rho$ profile analysis of the coma of the main-belt comet suggests a near-perihelion transition from a lower-activity pre-perihelion to a higher-activity post-perihelion steady state. We calculate a dust geometric albedo in the range of (2 - 45)%, which prevents us from constraining the spectral type of 324P/La Sagra, but we found an indication of dust superheating at 4.5 micrometers.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we present a semi-empirical calibration between the oxygen abundance and the $N2$ emission-line ratio for Low Ionization Nuclear Emission Regions (LINERs). This relation was derived by comparing the optical spectroscopic data of 118 nuclear spaxels classified as LINERs using three different BPT diagrams from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies survey (MaNGA) and sub-classified as weak (wAGN, 84 objects) and strong (sAGN, 34 objects) AGN (active galactic nucleus) from the WHAN diagnostic diagram and photoionization model results obtained with the {\sc cloudy} code assuming gas accretion into a black hole (representing an AGN). We found that our wAGN LINERs exhibit an oxygen abundance in the range of $8.50 \lesssim \mathrm{12+\log(O/H)} \lesssim 8.90 $, with an average value of $\mathrm{12+\log(O/H)}=8.68$, while our sAGN LINERs exhibit an oxygen abundance in the range of $8.51 \lesssim \: \mathrm{12+\log(O/H)} \: \lesssim \: 8.81 $, with an average value of $\mathrm{12+\log(O/H)}=8.65$. Our abundance estimations are in good agreement with those derived for another two different samples one of them with 463 Seyfert 2 objects and the other with 43 LINERs galaxies ionized by post-AGB stars, showing that the assumptions of our models are likely suitable for wAGN and sAGN LINERs. A relation between the equivalent width of the observed H$\alpha$ emission-line and the estimated ionization parameter provided by models was obtained. Our results also suggest that LINERs does not show a clear correlation between oxygen abundances and the stellar mass of the hosting galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 The appearance of the jets and lobes of some radio galaxies makes it difficult to assign them to a known class of objects. This is often due to the activity of the central engine and/or interactions with the environment, as well as projection effects. We analyse the radio data for an apparently asymmetric radio source 4C70.19, which is associated with the giant elliptical galaxy NGC6048. The source shows distorted radio jets and lobes, one of which bends by 180 degrees. The aim of our study is to explain the nature of the observed distortions. We used LOFAR, Effelsberg, and VLA radio data in a wide range of frequencies. At high frequencies, we also used radio polarimetry to study the properties of the magnetic fields. Additionally, we made use of optical, infra-red, and X-ray data. Polarisation data suggest shearing of the magnetic fields at points where the jets bend. The low-frequency LOFAR map at 145 MHz, as well as the sensitive single-dish Effelsberg map at 8.35 GHz, reveal previously undetected diffuse emission around the source. The rotation measure (RM) derived from the polarimetric data allowed us to estimate the density of the medium surrounding the source, which agrees with typical densities of the intergalactic medium or the outer parts of insterstellar halos. We propose that the southern jet is bent in the same manner as the northern one, but that it is inclined to the sky plane. Both these bends are likely caused by the orbital motion within the galaxy group, as well as interactions with the intergalactic medium. Our analyses suggest that, despite its complex morphology, 4C70.19 seems to be intrinsically symmetric with a physical extent of up to 600 kpc, and that the diffuse emission detected in our high-sensitivity maps is related to radio plumes that are expanding behind the source.

 - **Abstract**
 PSR B1259-63 is a gamma-ray binary system with a 48 ms radio pulsar orbiting around an O9.5Ve star, LS 2883, in a highly eccentric ~3.4 yr long orbit. Close to the periastron the system is detected from radio up to the TeV energies due to the interaction of LS 2883 and pulsar's outflows. The observations of last 4 periastra passages taken in 2010-2021 demonstrate periastron to periastron variability at all wavelength, probably linked to the state of the decretion disk. In this paper we present the results of our optical, radio and X-ray observational campaigns on PSR B1259-63 performed in 2024 accompanied with the analysis of the publicly available GeV FERMI/LAT data. We show that this periastron passage was characterised by the early flaring of X-rays before the periastron passage and GeV emission after the periastron passage, which can be explained by a larger size of the decretion disk as supported by the optical observations. The structure of the GeV flare is also in agreement with the disruption of the large dense disk. The possible X-ray/radio correlation was observed only during the post-periastron rise of X-ray and radio emission.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work we investigate the effects of the environment on the evolution of void galaxies. In particular, we study their morphology and explore its dependence with their location within the void where the galaxies reside, as well as with properties of the void, such as void size or galaxy number-density. The sample of void galaxies that we use in this study is based on the catalogue of cosmic voids and void galaxies in the SDSS-DR7. Since we are interested into study the morphology of void galaxies, we select galaxies in the redshift range 0.005$\leq$z$\leq$0.080, and use the public galaxy morphologies for SDSS with Deep Learning algorithms to divide the sample between early- and late-type void galaxies. We analyse the fraction of galaxies of each morphology type as a function of the void-centric distance, the size of the voids, and the density of galaxies in each void. There is a higher abundance of late-type galaxies with respect to early-type galaxies within voids, which remains nearly constant from the inner to the outer part of the voids. We do not find any dependence of the fraction of early- and late-type galaxies with respect to the size of the voids or the number-density of galaxies in the voids. Galaxies in voids follow the morphology-density relation, in the sense that the majority of the galaxies in voids (the most under-dense large-scale environments) are late-type galaxies. However, we find no difference between voids with lower or higher volume number-density of galaxies: the fraction of early- and late-type galaxies do not depend on the density of the voids. The physical processes responsible for the evolution from late towards earlier types (such as external environmental quenching) are not sufficiently effective in voids or so slow (internal secular quenching) that their contributions do not appear in the morphology-density relation.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast-mode magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves in the solar corona are often known to be produced by solar flares and eruptive prominences. We here simulate the effect of the interaction of an external perturbation on a magnetic null in the solar corona which results in the formation of a current sheet (CS). Once the CS undergoes a sufficient extension in its length and squeezing of its width, it may go unstable to the formation of multiple impulsive plasmoids. Eventually, the plasmoids merge with one another to form larger plasmoids and/or are expelled from the sheet. The formation, motion and coalescence of plasmoids with each other and with magnetic Y-points at the outer periphery of the extended CS are found to generate wave-like perturbations. An analysis of the resultant quasi-periodic variations of pressure, density, velocity and magnetic field at certain locations in the model corona indicate that these waves are predominantly fast-mode magnetoacoustic waves. For typical coronal parameters, the resultant propagating waves carry an energy flux of $\mathrm{10^{5}~\mathrm{erg~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}}}$ to a large distance of at least 60 Mm away from the current sheet. In general, we suggest that both waves and reconnection play a role in heating the solar atmosphere and driving the solar wind and may interact with one another in a manner that we refer to as a $"$Symbiosis of WAves and Reconnection (SWAR)$"$.

 - **Abstract**
 The complex astrophysical processes leading to the formation of binary black holes and their eventual merger are imprinted on the spins of the individual black holes. We revisit the astrophysical distribution of those spins based on gravitational waves from the third gravitational wave transient catalog GWTC-3, (Abbott et al. 2023a), looking for structure in the two-dimensional space defined by the dimensionless spin magnitudes of the heavier ($\chi_1$) and lighter ($\chi_2$) component black holes. We find support for two distinct subpopulations with greater than $95\%$ credibility. The dominant population is made up of black holes with small spins, preferring $\chi_1 \approx 0.2$ for the primary and $\chi_2 \approx 0$ for the secondary; we report signs of an anticorrelation between $\chi_1$ and $\chi_2$, as well as as evidence against a subpopulation of binaries in which both components are nonspinning. The subdominant population consists of systems in which both black holes have relatively high spins and contains $20^{+18}_{-18}\%$ of the binaries. The binaries that are most likely to belong in this subpopulation are massive and slightly more likely to have spin-orientations aligned with the orbital angular momentum--potentially consistent with isolated binary formation channels capable of producing large spins, like chemically homogeneous evolution. This hint of a rapidly spinning subpopulation hinges on GW190517, a binary with large and well-measured spins. Our results, which are enabled by novel hierarchical inference methods, represent a first step towards more descriptive population models for black hole spins, and will be strengthened or refuted by the large number of gravitational wave detections expected in the next several years.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic dust plays a crucial role in the evolution of galaxies, significantly influencing star formation and the interstellar medium. However, in active galactic nuclei (AGN), the role and origin of dust remain poorly understood. High-resolution X-ray spectroscopy is a powerful tool for probing the properties of dust in AGN. NGC 6860, an X-ray bright type-1 quasar, is an ideal target for investigating the connection between dust and winds in AGN. It exhibits reddening and X-ray absorption by both dust and winds. By modeling high-resolution X-ray spectra from XMM-Newton and Chandra observations, we determine the properties of dust and outflows in this AGN. Our analysis finds four photoionized components, outflowing with velocities of 50-300 km/s. The first two are relatively highly ionized with logxi = 3.4 and logxi = 2.9. The results of our photoionization modeling suggest that these two components are thermally unstable. The third component is ionized, with logxi = 2.3 and is located further away from the central black hole. The fourth component is less ionized, and is possibly located in the host galaxy. The application of dust models enables us to probe the abundance and location of the dust in NGC 6860. Our findings suggest that dust absorption and reddening originates from the extended narrow-line region and its host galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations of volume-limited samples of magnetic white dwarfs (WD) have revealed a higher incidence of magnetism in older WDs. Specifically, these studies indicate that magnetism is more prevalent in WDs with fully or partially crystallized cores compared to those with entirely liquid cores. This has led to the recognition of a crystallization-driven dynamo as an important mechanism for explaining magnetism in isolated WDs. However, recent simulations challenged the capability of this mechanism to match both the incidence of magnetism and the field strengths detected in WDs. In this letter, we explore an alternative hypothesis for the surface emergence of magnetic fields in isolated WDs. WDs with masses $\gtrsim 0.55 M_\odot$ are the descendants of main-sequence stars with convective cores capable of generating strong dynamo magnetic fields. This idea is supported by asteroseismic evidence of strong magnetic fields buried within the interiors of red giant branch stars. Assuming that these fields are disrupted by subsequent convective zones, we have estimated magnetic breakout times for WDs. Due to the significant uncertainties in breakout times stemming from the treatment of convective boundaries and mass loss rates, we cannot provide a precise prediction for the emergence time of the main-sequence dynamo field. However, we can predict that this emergence should occur during the WD phase for WDs with masses $\gtrsim 0.65 M_\odot$. We also find that the magnetic breakout is expected to occur earlier in more massive WDs, consistently with observations from volume-limited samples and the well-established fact that magnetic WDs tend to be more massive than non-magnetic ones. Moreover, within the uncertainties of stellar evolutionary models, we find that the emergence of main-sequence dynamo magnetic fields can account for a significant portion of the magnetic WDs.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent theoretical work and targeted observational studies suggest that filaments are sites of galaxy preprocessing. The aim of the WISESize project is to directly probe galaxies over the full range of environments to quantify and characterize extrinsic galaxy quenching in the local Universe. In this paper, we use GALFIT to measure the infrared 12$\mu$m ($R_{12}$) and 3.4$\mu$m ($R_{3.4}$) effective radii of 603 late-type galaxies in and surrounding the Virgo cluster. We find that Virgo cluster galaxies show smaller star-forming disks relative to their field counterparts at the $2.5\sigma$ level, while filament galaxies show smaller star-forming disks to almost $1.5\sigma$. Our data, therefore, show that cluster galaxies experience significant effects on their star-forming disks prior to their final quenching period. There is also tentative support for the hypothesis that galaxies are preprocessed in filamentary regions surrounding clusters. On the other hand, galaxies belonging to rich groups and poor groups do not differ significantly from those in the field. We additionally find hints of a positive correlation between stellar mass and size ratio for both rich group and filament galaxies, though the uncertainties on these data are consistent with no correlation. We compare our size measurements with the predictions from two variants of a state-of-the-art semi-analytic model (SAM), one which includes starvation and the other incorporating both starvation and ram-pressure stripping (RPS). Our data appear to disfavor the SAM, which includes RPS for the rich group, filament, and cluster samples, which contributes to improved constraints for general models of galaxy quenching.
#### Observation of nonaxisymmetric standard magnetorotational instability induced by a free-shear layer

 - **Abstract**
 The standard magnetorotational instability (SMRI) is widely believed to be responsible for the observed accretion rates in astronomical disks. It is a linear instability triggered in the differentially rotating ionized disk flow by a magnetic field component parallel to the rotation axis. Most studies focus on axisymmetric SMRI in conventional base flows with a Keplerian profile for accretion disks or an ideal Couette profile for Taylor-Couette flows, since excitation of nonaxisymmetric SMRI in such flows requires a magnetic Reynolds number Rm more than an order of magnitude larger. Here, we report that in a magnetized Taylor-Couette flow, nonaxisymmetric SMRI can be destabilized in a free-shear layer in the base flow at Rm $\gtrsim$ 1, the same threshold as for axisymmetric SMRI. Global linear analysis reveals that the free-shear layer reduces the required Rm, possibly by introducing an extremum in the vorticity of the base flow. Nonlinear simulations validate the results from linear analysis and confirm that a novel instability recently discovered experimentally (Nat. Commun. 13, 4679 (2022)) is the nonaxisymmetric SMRI. Our finding has astronomical implications since free-shear layers are ubiquitous in celestial systems.
