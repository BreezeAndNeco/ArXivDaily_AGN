#### Observations of eigenfunctions of solar inertial modes using local correlation tracking of magnetic features
 - **Authors:** Neelanchal Joshi, Zhi-Chao Liang, Damien Fournier, Laurent Gizon

 - **Abstract**
 Solar inertial modes are quasi-toroidal modes of the Sun that are of practical interest as they allow probing the deep convection zone. Since 2010, solar images of the photospheric magnetic field are made available by HMI onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory. In this work, we track the motion of the small magnetic features using a cross correlation technique. Under the assumption that these features are passive tracers, we obtain time series of the horizontal flow field on the solar surface. A Singular Value Decomposition is then applied to these data to extract the latitudinal profile as well as the time modulation of the modes of oscillation.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the JWST discovery of a highly-extincted ($A_V\sim52$) candidate brown dwarf ($\sim0.018$M$_\odot$) in the outskirts of the Trapezium Cluster that appears to be coincident with the end of a $\sim 1700\,$au long, remarkably uniformly wide, dark trail that broadens only slightly at the end opposite the point source. We examine whether a dusty trail associated with a highly-extincted brown dwarf could plausibly be detected with JWST and explore possible origins. We show that a dusty trail associated with the brown dwarf could be observable if dust within it is larger than that in the ambient molecular cloud. For example, if the ambient cloud has a standard $\sim0.25$$\mu$m maximum grain size and the trail contains micron-sized grains, then the trail will have a scattering opacity over an order of magnitude larger compared to the surroundings in NIRCam short-wavelength filters. We use a simple model to show that a change in maximum grain size can reproduce the high $A_V$ and the multi-filter NIRCam contrast seen between the trail and its surroundings. We propose and explore two possible mechanisms that could be responsible for the trail: i) a weak FUV radiation-driven wind from the circum-brown dwarf disc due to the O stars in the region and ii) a Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion wake. The former would be the most distant known case of the Trapezium stars' radiation driving winds from a disc, and the latter would be the first known example of ``late'' infall from the interstellar medium onto a low mass object in a high-mass star-forming region.

 - **Abstract**
 The ZTF SN Ia Data Release 2 provides a perfect opportunity to perform a thorough search for, and subsequent analysis of, high-velocity components in the Si II $\lambda$6355 feature in the pre-peak regime. The source of such features remains unclear, with potential origins in circumstellar material or density/abundance enhancements intrinsic to the SN ejecta. Therefore, they may provide clues to the elusive progenitor and explosion scenarios of SNe Ia. We employ a MCMC fitting method followed by BIC testing to classify single and double Si II $\lambda$6355 components in the DR2. The detection efficiency of our classification method is investigated through the fitting of simulated features, allowing us to place cuts upon spectral quality required for reliable classification. These simulations were also used to perform an analysis of the recovered parameter uncertainties and potential biases in the measurements. Within the 329 spectra sample that we investigate, we identify 85 spectra exhibiting Si II $\lambda$6355 HVFs. We find that HVFs decrease in strength with phase relative to their photospheric counterparts - however, this decrease can occur at different phases for different objects. HVFs with larger velocity separations from the photosphere are seen to fade earlier leaving only the double components with smaller separations as we move towards maximum light. Our findings suggest that around three quarters of SN Ia spectra before -11 d show high-velocity components in the Si II $\lambda$6355 with this dropping to around one third in the six days before maximum light. We observe no difference between the populations of SNe Ia that do and do not form Si II $\lambda$6355 HVFs in terms of SALT2 light-curve parameter x1, peak magnitude, decline rate, host mass, or host colour, supporting the idea that these features are ubiquitous across the SN Ia population.
#### Challenges and Opportunities for time-delay cosmography with multi-messenger gravitational lensing

 - **Abstract**
 Strong gravitational lensing of variable sources, such as quasars or supernovae, can be used to constrain cosmological parameters through a technique known as "time-delay cosmography''. Competitive constraints on the Hubble constant have been achieved with electromagnetic observations of lensed quasars and lensed supernovae. Gravitational wave (GW) astronomy may open up a new channel for time-delay cosmography with GW signal replacing the electromagnetic (EM) one. We highlight the similarities of using GW signals to be applied to time-delay cosmography compared to EM signal. We then discuss key differences between GW and EM signals and their resulting advantages and inconveniences from the angle of the current state-of-the-art using quasars and lensed supernovae for time-delay cosmography. We identify the astrometric precision requirement of the images as a key challenge to overcome and highlight the potentially significant impact that near-perfect time-delay measurements of lensed GWs can bring to the table.

 - **Abstract**
 The "foamy" nature of spacetime at the Planck scale was an idea first introduced by John Wheeler in the 1950s. And for the last twenty years or so it has been debated whether those inherent uncertainties in time and path-length might also accumulate in transiting electromagnetic wavefronts, resulting in measurable blurring for images of distant galaxies and quasars. A confusing aspect is that "pointlike" objects will always be blurred out somewhat by the optics of a telescope, especially in the optical. But it turns out that Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are more useful to test this, and have been observed by a host of ground-based and space-based telescopes, including by the Fermi observatory for well over a decade. And a recent one was unprecedented: GRB221009A was extremely bright, allowing follow-up from the infrared through the ultraviolet to X-rays and gamma-rays, including a first association with photons at high TeV energies. I will discuss how that observation is in direct tension with the calculus of how spacetime "foaminess" can add up in an image of a pointsource at cosmological distances, which at high-enough energy could spread these out over the whole sky without resulting in photon loss. A simple multiwavelength average of foam-induced blurring consistent with holographic quantum gravity is described, analogous to atmospheric seeing from the ground. This fits with measured instrumental point-spread functions and with the highest-energy localization of GRB221009A, resolving the observational issues and pointing to a key physical implication: spacetime does not look smooth.

 - **Abstract**
 We compare measurements of star formation efficiency to cloud-scale gas properties across PHANGS-ALMA. Dividing 67 galaxies into 1.5 kpc scale regions, we calculate the molecular gas depletion time, tau_dep= Sigma_mol/Sigma_SFR, and the star formation efficiency per free-fall time, eff=tau_ff/tau_dep, for each region. Then we test how tau_dep and eff vary as functions of the regional mass-weighted mean molecular gas properties on cloud scales (60-150pc): gas surface density, <Sigma_mol^cloud>, velocity dispersion, <sigma_mol^cloud>, virial parameter, <alpha_vir^cloud>, and gravitational free-fall time, <tau_ff^cloud>. <tau_ff^cloud> and tau_dep correlate positively, consistent with the expectation that gas density plays a key role in setting the rate of star formation. Our fiducial measurements suggest tau_dep \propto <tau_ff^cloud>^0.5 and eff \approx 0.34%, though the exact numbers depend on the adopted fitting methods. We also observe anti-correlations between tau_dep and <Sigma_mol^cloud> and between tau_dep^mol and <sigma_mol^cloud> . All three correlations may reflect the same underlying link between density and star formation efficiency combined with systematic variations in the degree to which self-gravity binds molecular gas in galaxies. We highlight the tau_dep-<sigma_mol^cloud> relation because of the lower degree of correlation between the axes. Contrary to theoretical expectations, we observe an anti-correlation between tau_dep^mol and <alpha_vir^cloud> and no significant correlation between eff and <alpha_vir^cloud>. Our results depend sensitively on the adopted CO-to-H2 conversion factor, with corrections for excitation and emissivity effects in inner galaxies playing an important role. We emphasize that our simple methodology and clean selection allow easy comparison to numerical simulations and highlight this as a logical next direction.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we focus on the study of starburst galaxies in their final billion years. Our galaxy selection is based solely on the presence of the H${\delta}$ absorption line, which permits tracing the later evolution of starburst galaxies, coinciding with the emergence of A-type stars in these galaxies. We propose a novel method that utilizes star formation rate and UVJ colors to classify galaxies in the sample, and use the spectral features to mark their evolution stages. Our in-depth analysis of the MgII line indicates the substantial increasing of F- and G-type stars when a galaxy evolves from star forming to quiescent phase. Furthermore, we identify AGNs in this sample to explore their roles in the later stage of galaxy star formation history.

 - **Abstract**
 M17 is a well-known massive star-forming region, and its Gas-to-Dust Ratio (GDR) may vary significantly compared to the other areas. The mass of gas can be traced by the ${\rm CO}$ emission observed in the \emph{Milky Way Imaging Scroll Painting (MWISP) project}. The dust mass can be traced by analyzing the interstellar extinction magnitude obtained from the \emph{United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT)}. We computed the ratio ${W({\rm CO})/A_V}$: for ${A_V \le }$ 10 mag, ${{ W(^{12}{\rm CO})/ A_V}= (6.27 \pm 0.19)}$ ${\mathrm{{K \cdot km/s} \cdot mag^{-1}}}$ and ${{ W(^{13}{\rm CO})/ A_V} = (0.75 \pm 0.72)}$ ${ \mathrm{{K \cdot km/s} \cdot mag^{-1}}}$; whereas for ${{A_V} \ge 10}$ mag, ${{ W(^{12}{\rm CO})/ A_V} = (15.8 \pm 0.06) }$ ${\mathrm{{K \cdot km/s} \cdot mag^{-1}}}$ and ${{ W(^{13}{\rm CO})/ A_V} = (3.11 \pm 0.25)}$ ${ \mathrm{{K \cdot km/s} \cdot mag^{-1}}}$. Then, we converted the ${W({\rm CO})/A_V}$ into ${N(\rm H)/A_V}$. Using the WD01 model, we derived the GDR: for ${A_V \le }$ 10 mag, the GDRs were ${118 \pm 9}$ for ${^{12}{\rm CO}}$ and ${83 \pm 62}$ for ${^{13}{\rm CO}}$, comparable to those of the Milky Way; however, for ${A_V \ge }$ 10 mag, the GDRs increased significantly to ${296 \pm 3}$ for ${^{12}{\rm CO}}$ and ${387 \pm 40}$ for ${^{13}{\rm CO}}$, approximately three times higher than those of the Milky Way. In the discussion, we compared the results of this work with previous studies and provided a detailed discussion of the influence of massive stars and other factors on GDR.

 - **Abstract**
 We employ the SIMBA-C cosmological simulation to study the impact of its upgraded chemical enrichment model (Chem5) on the distribution of metals in the intragroup medium (IGrM). We investigate the projected X-ray emission-weighted abundance profiles of key elements over two decades in halo mass ($10^{13} \leq M_{500}/\mathrm{M_\odot} \leq 10^{15}$). Typically, SIMBA-C generates lower-amplitude abundance profiles than SIMBA with flatter cores, in better agreement with observations. For low-mass groups, both simulations over-enrich the IGrM with Si, S, Ca, and Fe compared to observations, a trend likely related to inadequate modeling of metal dispersal and mixing. We analyze the 3D mass-weighted abundance profiles, concluding that the lower SIMBA-C IGrM abundances are primarily a consequence of fewer metals in the IGrM, driven by reduced metal yields in Chem5, and the removal of the instantaneous recycling of metals approximation employed by SIMBA. Additionally, an increased IGrM mass in low-mass SIMBA-C groups is likely triggered by changes to the AGN and stellar feedback models. Our study suggests that a more realistic chemical enrichment model broadly improves agreement with observations, but physically motivated sub-grid models for other key processes, like AGN and stellar feedback and turbulent diffusion, are required to realistically reproduce observed group environments.

 - **Abstract**
 A distinct power-law break is apparent m_AB approximately 21 in the deep Near-Infrared PEARLS-JWST galaxy counts. The break becomes more pronounced at longer wavelengths, with the counts slope flattening smoothly with apparent magnitude in the shortest band used at 0.9 microns, trending towards an increasingly broken slope by the longest wavelength passband of JWST NIRCam, 4.4 microns. This behaviour is remarkably well predicted by the GALFORM semi-analytical model of galaxy formation. We use the model to diagnose the origin of this behaviour. We find that the features that are responsible for the break are: 1) the inherent break in the luminosity function; 2) the change in the volume element with redshift and 3) the redshift-dependent nature of the k-correction. We study the contribution to these effects by early and late-type galaxies, using as a proxy for morphology the bulge-to-total stellar mass ratio. We find that the way in which ellipticals populate the bright end of the luminosity function while spirals dominate the faint end is preserved in the galaxy number counts, with a characteristic stellar mass at the break of approximately 10^10 M_sun. We also find that the shape of the number counts is mainly driven by galaxies with relatively low redshift (z < 2) for the PEARLS observational limit of m_AB < 28. We give a comprehensive description of why the galaxy number counts in the near-infrared PEARLS-JWST observation look the way they do and which population of galaxies is dominant at each apparent magnitude.
#### Is there a chiral dark dynamo in the universe induced by quantum correction, Nieh-Yan gravity and Barbero-Immirzi field?

 - **Abstract**
 Bombagcino investigated the role of Immirzi parameter when promoted to a field in Einstein-Cartan-Holst black hole and they found that the Immirzi field acts similar to the axion field, as both axial pseudo-vector and vectorial torsion trace appear to be expressed in terms of the 4-gradient of the Immirzi parameter. In this paper we introduced two important ingredients absent in the previous work: the torsion mass, significant for the torsion detection the Large Hadron Collider, and the quantum correction proportional to the 4-divergent of torsion squared. Without the quantum correction, a simple analytical solution is obtained, while the more complicated field equations incorporating the BI field are obtained also analytically. The lower bound of quantum correction parameter is determined in terms of the torsion trace mass squared and axial torsion squared. Our findings reveal that in the late universe, the BI parameter approaches infinity restoring to the Einstein-Cartan theory in the early universe with the dynamical reduction of the Immirzi parameter to a constant BI parameter. Additionally, we derive analytical solutions for magnetic dynamos in the early universe, demonstrating that magnetic helicity is proportional to chiral chemical potential. A magnetic field at the QCD phase is found out of $10^{17}$ G, without quantum correction. Furthermore, from this dark magnetogenesis, we estimate light torsion with mass of the order of 1 TeV, An example of unitary preserved Lagrangian with axion as an Immirzi field is obtained. In the present universe we find a magnetic field strength of approximately $10^{-12}$ G which is quite close to the range found by Miniati at the QCD threshold, between $10^{-18}-10^{-15}$ G. Given that unitary violation on theoretical grounds may indicate new physics, exploring unitary violations in dark magnetogenesis could be particularly intriguing.

 - **Abstract**
 A major open issue concerning the active Sun is the effectiveness with which magnetic reconnection accelerates electrons in flares. A paper published by {\em{Nature}} in 2022 used microwave observations to conclude that the Sun is an almost ideal accelerator, energizing nearly all electrons within a coronal volume to nonthermal energies. Shortly thereafter, a paper published in {\em{Astrophysical Journal Letters}} used hard X-ray measurements \emph{of the same event} to reach the contradictory conclusion that less than 1\% of the available electrons were accelerated. Here we address this controversy by using spatially resolved observations of hard X-ray emission and a spectral inversion method to determine the evolution of the electron spectrum throughout the flare. So we estimated the density of the medium where electrons accelerate and, from this, the ratio of accelerated to ambient electron densities. Results show that this ratio never exceeds a percent or so in the cases analyzed.
#### The XXL Survey LIV. X-ray Luminosity Function and Luminosity-Mass Relation of Optically Selected Galaxy Groups

 - **Abstract**
 The overlap between the GAMA spectroscopic survey and the XXL X-ray survey was used to study the X-ray properties of optically-selected groups of galaxies. Forced X-ray aperture photometry was applied to an optically-selected sample of 235 groups (containing at least five member galaxies) to measure their X-ray luminosities in the regime of low signal to noise X-ray data. The sample encompasses X-ray luminosities over an order of magnitude fainter than typical X-ray selected samples, and avoids X-ray selection biases. This gives access to low mass groups where the effects of non-gravitational processes, such as AGN-feedback, should be most apparent and could inhibit their detection in an X-ray survey. We measured the X-ray luminosity function (XLF) of the sample, and found it to be consistent with the extrapolation of the XLF from X-ray selected samples at higher luminosities. The XLF was combined with a theoretical halo mass function to infer the form of the scaling relation between X-ray luminosity and mass (LM relation) for the GAMA groups. We found a slope of $1.87 \pm 0.12$, which is steeper than self similarity in this mass regime. When comparing with other measurements of the LM relation, we find evidence for a steepening of the slope in the low mass regime, likely due to the impact of non-gravitational processes. Our approach can be translated to eROSITA data using multi-wavelength surveys to constrain the X-ray properties of galaxy groups in the limits of high redshift and low mass.

 - **Abstract**
 Wide-field high-precision photometric observations such as \textit{Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS)} allowed the investigation of the stellar magnetic activity of cool stars. M-dwarf's starspots and stellar flares are the main indicators of magnetic activity. The present study focuses on modeling light curves (LCs) to analyze the distribution and characteristics of starspots e.g., location, temperature, and spot size. The \textit{TESS} light curves of two selected young M-dwarfs i.e. GJ~182 and 2MASS~J05160212+2214528 were reconstructed using the \textsc{BASSMAN} software, obtaining a three-spot model for GJ~182 and two-spot model for 2MASS~J05160212+2214528, describing their light curves. For GJ~182, the mean spot temperature was estimated to be approximately 3279~K, covering 5-8.5\% of the stellar surface while for 2MASS~J05160212+2214528 the average spot temperature was approximately 2631~K, with a mean spottedness of about 5.4\%. Using the 2-min cadence LC data, we identified and analyzed 48 flare events from GJ~182, while no flares were detected in 2MASS~J05160212+2214528. The estimated bolometric flare energy ranged from $10^{32} - 10^{35}$ erg, and 10$^{31}$ - 10$^{33}$ erg in the TESS bandpass. We derived the power-law index of -1.53 $\pm$ 0.12 and -1.86 $\pm$ 0.22 for flare frequency distribution in sectors 5 and 32 respectively in the flare energy 10$^{33}$ to 10$^{35}$ erg, consistent with previous studies for M-dwarfs. A positive linear correlation between flare energy and duration was found with a slope of $0.67 \pm 0.02$, suggesting a similar mechanism followed by stellar superflares and solar flares. By assuming the similarities with solar flares, we also estimated the lower limit of the magnetic field strength around 12 - 232~G to produce such superflare events.

 - **Abstract**
 Head-tail radio galaxies are characterized by a head, corresponding to an elliptical galaxy, and two radio jets sweeping back from the head, forming an extended structure behind the host galaxy that is moving through the intracluster medium (ICM). This morphology arises from the interaction between the diffuse radio-emitting plasma and the surrounding environment. Sometimes revived fossil plasma is found in galaxy clusters, tracing old active galactic nucleus ejecta with a very steep spectrum re-energized through processes in the ICM, unrelated to the progenitor galaxy. We aim to study the central region of Abell 1775, a galaxy cluster in an unclear dynamical state at z = 0.072. It hosts two giant radio-loud elliptical galaxies, the head-tail radio galaxy that "breaks" at the position of a cold front detected in the X-rays, filamentary revived fossil plasma, and central diffuse emission. This study aims to investigate and constrain the spectral properties and trends along the head-tail, as well as the revived fossil plasma, to better understand the formation process of the non-thermal phenomena in A1775. We make use of LOFAR (144 MHz), and new deep uGMRT observations (400 and 650 MHz). We observe an overall steepening along the tail of the head-tail radio galaxy. In the radio colour-colour diagram, ageing models reproduce the emission of the head-tail. An unexpected brightness increase at the head of the tail suggests a complex bending of the jets. We derived the equipartition magnetic field and minimum pressure along the tail. We recovered the structure of the revived fossil plasma, which appears as thin filaments with ultra-steep spectra. We show that high-sensitivity, high-resolution observations at low frequencies are essential for detecting the full extent of the tail, enabling a deeper spectral analysis and resolving the structure and spectral properties of revived fossil plasma.

 - **Abstract**
 Centaurus A (Cen A) is the closest radio galaxy and a prime example of a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (AGN), exhibiting complex emissions across the electromagnetic spectrum. The nature of its continuum emission, particularly the mechanisms powering it, has been a subject of considerable debate due to the fact that the AGN is deeply buried in dust. This study aims to elucidate the origin of the continuum emission in Cen A and determine the geometrical arrangement of matter in the nuclear region by the mean of optical and near-infrared spectropolarimetry. We obtained spectropolarimetric data of Cen A using the VLT/FORS2. The analysis revealed a region showing strong and narrow emission lines associated with AGN activity. After correction for interstellar polarization in the dust lane (but not for starlight), the intrinsic polarization of the scattered AGN light exhibits a polarization degree of 2-4%, decreasing from optical to near-infrared, associated with a polarization position angle perpendicular to the radio jet axis. We exclude the presence of hidden broad line in our polarized flux spectrum at more than 99% probability. Narrow emission lines are found to be strongly polarized and orthogonal to the jet position angle. We demonstrate that a beamed synchrotron jet, scattering onto the narrow line region (NLR) best fits all the observational properties reported in this paper and the literature. In this model, the base of the NLR is obscured by a giant circumnuclear region and can only become visible through perpendicular scattering onto the outermost part of the NLR, naturally producing high polarization degrees and polarization angles perpendicular to the radio structure. This study provides strong evidence that Cen A defines a new class of hidden-NLR AGNs and supports old predictions that beamed synchrotron jets can be observed in reflection.

 Understanding the co-evolution between supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their host galaxies provides crucial insights into SMBH formation and galaxy assembly in these cosmic ecosystems. However, measuring this co-evolution, as traced by the black hole mass - stellar mass relation towards the early Universe, often suffers from significant sample selection biases. Samples selected based on the luminosity of the SMBH would preferentially find overly massive black holes relative to their host stellar mass, missing the population of lower-mass SMBHs that are underrepresented. Here we report the discovery of 13 moderate-luminosity broad-line Active Galactic Nuclei from a galaxy-based selection of 52 massive galaxies at z~3-5. The derived SMBH masses for these AGNs yield a mean SMBH-to-stellar mass ratio of ~0.1%, consistent with the local value. There is limited evolution in this mean mass ratio traced back to z~6, indicating that a significant population of ''normal'' SMBHs already existed within the first billion years of the Universe. Combined with the previous sample of overmassive black holes, there must be diverse pathways for SMBH formation in high-redshift galaxies. Most of these galaxies are experiencing star formation quenching by the observed epoch, suggesting the formation of massive quiescent galaxies does not necessarily require an overly massive black hole, contrary to some theoretical predictions.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a MIRI-MRS spectrum of the high-inclination protoplanetary disk around the solar-mass (K0) star MY Lup, obtained as part of the JWST Disk Infrared Spectral Chemistry Survey (JDISCS). The spectrum shows an unusually weak water emission spectrum for a disk around a star of its spectral type, but strong emission from CO$_2$, HCN, and isotopologues of both molecules. This includes the first ever detection of C$^{18}$O$^{16}$O and H$^{13}$CN in an inner disk, as well as tentative detections of C$^{17}$O$^{16}$O and HC$^{15}$N. Slab modeling provides molecular temperatures, column densities and emitting areas of the detected molecules. The emitting molecular gas is cold compared to that of other observed protoplanetary disk spectra. We estimate the isotopologue ratios of CO$_2$ and HCN, albeit with significant uncertainty. We suggest that the unusual spectrum of MY Lup arises from a combination of inner disk clearing, which removes emission from warm water, and its nearly edge-on inclination, which enhances line-of-sight column densities, although unusual chemistry may also be required. MY Lup's spectrum highlights the potential to detect and measure trace isotopologues to study isotopic fractionation in protoplanetary disks; observations at higher spectral resolving power is needed to constrain the isotopologue ratios to greater precision.
