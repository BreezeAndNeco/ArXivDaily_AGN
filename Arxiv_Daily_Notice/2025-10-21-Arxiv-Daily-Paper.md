 - **Abstract**
 We present a reverberation mapping analysis of the coronal line [Ne V]$\lambda$3427 emitting region of the quasar COS168 (SDSS J095910.30+020732.2). [Ne V]$\lambda$3427 is known as one of the "coronal lines," which are a species of emission lines present in AGN spectra with high ionization potentials ($\geq$ 100 eV) that can serve as tracers for AGN activity. The spatial extent of the coronal line region has been studied with only spatial resolving techniques that are not sensitive to the innermost regions of AGN. Through our reverberation mapping analysis of [Ne V]$\lambda$3427, we measure a nominal `optimal emission radius' for [Ne V]$\lambda$3427 of $381.1^{+16}_{-22}$ light days (observed-frame). We place the coronal line region in context with other AGN regions by comparing it with the characteristic radius of H$\alpha$, the dust-sublimation radius, and the dusty torus. The coronal line region is located at a larger radius from the black hole than the characteristic radius of the dusty torus, measured using a torus-radius luminosity relationship. The virial product ($v^2 R/G$) of both H$\alpha$ and [Ne V]$\lambda$3427 is consistent within the uncertainties, implying that the coronal line region, as probed by the [Ne V]$\lambda$3427 line, may be in a virialized orbit that is dominated by the gravitational potential of the black hole. This plausibly suggests that coronal lines could be an effective method for estimating black hole masses.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the stellar mass-metallicity relation (MZR) and mass-metallicity-star formation relation ("fundamental metallicity relation"; FMR) of 18 massive (log(M/M$_\odot$) = 9.5-11) main-sequence galaxies at z~5 from the ALPINE-CRISTAL-JWST sample. This sample complements recent studies by JWST at up to two orders of magnitude lower stellar masses. The metallicities are derived using strong optical lines, and verified by temperature-based oxygen abundance measurements for five galaxies for which faint auroral lines are detected. We find little evolution at the massive end of the MZR between z~5 and cosmic noon at z~2, suggesting a fast metal enrichment at early times. The FMR at z=5 exhibits a 5x larger scatter (preferentially to lower metallicities) compared the local FMR relation. This scatter can be explained by a bursty star formation and the direct build-up of metals in early galaxies as well as differences in age and outflow efficiencies. Capitalizing on all available samples, we find that the observed MZR and FMR over three orders of stellar mass is generally in good agreement with results from cosmological simulation, although some underestimate the metal enrichment at low stellar masses. This may be due to too efficient metal-rich outflows. We show that the ALPINE-CRISTAL-JWST galaxies likely joined the current FMR at z~10 and will evolve into massive (log(M/M$_\odot$)~11.4) galaxies with super-solar metallicities by z=0.

 - **Abstract**
 Image regridding and coaddition have a wide range of applications in astronomical observations. {\sc Imcom}, an algorithm that provides control over point spread function (PSF) and noise in coadded images, has been found to meet the stringent requirements of weak gravitational lensing cosmology with the forthcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. In this work, I introduce a new algorithm, Fast {\sc Imcom}, which outperforms traditional {\sc Imcom} in terms of both efficiency and quality. After explaining the underlying philosophy and mathematical formalism, I conduct systematic comparisons between {\sc Imcom} and Fast {\sc Imcom} in terms of PSF reconstruction in 1D. While a 2D implementation is beyond the scope of this paper, I demonstrate how to generalize Fast {\sc Imcom} to 2D and discuss practical issues involved. This new algorithm has the potential of reducing both the computational costs and storage requirements (current estimates are $\sim 100\,{\rm M}$ core hours and $\sim 1.5 \,{\rm PB}$, respectively) of the Roman High Latitude Imaging Survey (HLIS) by an order of magnitude. Meanwhile, it provides implications for the dithering patterns of Roman surveys. I also address potential applications of Fast {\sc Imcom} beyond the Roman HLIS, with focus on other weak lensing programs and Roman time domain surveys; the actual range of use cases is likely beyond what is discussed here.

 - **Abstract**
 To fully characterize the formation and evolution of galaxies, we need to observe their stars, gas, and dust on resolved spatial scales. We present the ALPINE-CRISTAL-JWST survey, which combines kpc-resolved imaging and spectroscopy from HST, JWST, and ALMA for 18 representative main-sequence galaxies at z=4-6 and log(M/$M_\odot$) > 9.5 to study their star formation, chemical properties, and extended gas reservoirs. The co-spatial measurements resolving the ionized gas, molecular gas, stars, and dust on 1-2 kpc scales make this a unique benchmark sample for the study of galaxy formation and evolution at z~5, connecting the Epoch of Reionization with the cosmic noon. In this paper, we outline the survey goals and sample selection, and present a summary of the available data for the 18 galaxies. In addition, we measure spatially integrated quantities (such as global gas metallicity), test different star formation rate indicators, and quantify the presence of H$\alpha$ halos. Our targeted galaxies are relatively metal rich (10-70% solar), complementary to JWST samples at lower stellar mass, and there is broad agreement between different star formation indicators. One galaxy has the signature of an active galactic nuclei (AGN) based on its emission line ratios. Six show broad H$\alpha$ emission suggesting type 1 AGN candidates. We conclude with an outlook on the exciting science that will be pursued with this unique sample in forthcoming papers.
#### The ALPINE-CRISTAL-JWST Survey: NIRSpec IFU Data Processing and Spatially-resolved Views of Chemical Enrichment in Normal Galaxies at z=4-6

 - **Abstract**
 We present a statistical study of spatially resolved chemical enrichment in 18 main-sequence galaxies at $z=4$--6, observed with \jwst/NIRSpec IFU as part of the ALPINE-CRISTAL-\jwst\ survey. Performing an optimized reduction and calibration procedure, including local background subtraction, light-leakage masking, stripe removal, and astrometry refinement, we achieve robust emission-line mapping on kiloparsec scales. Although line-ratio distributions vary across galaxies in our sample, we generally find mild central enhancements in [O\,\textsc{iii}]/H$\beta$, [O\,\textsc{ii}]/[O\,\textsc{iii}], [S\,\textsc{ii}]$_{6732}$/[S\,\textsc{ii}]$_{6718}$, H$\alpha$/H$\beta$, and $L_{\rm H\alpha}/L_{\rm UV}$, consistent with elevated electron density, dust obscuration, and bursty star formation accompanied by reduced metallicity and ionization parameter. These features point to inside-out growth fueled by recent inflows of pristine gas. Nevertheless, the median metallicity gradient is nearly flat over a few kpc scale, $\Delta \log({\rm O/H}) = 0.02 \pm 0.01$ dex kpc$^{-1}$, implying efficient chemical mixing through inflows, outflows, and mergers. From pixel-by-pixel stellar and emission-line characterizations, we further investigate the resolved Fundamental Metallicity Relation (rFMR). Metallicity is described by a fundamental plane with stellar mass and SFR surface densities, but with a stronger dependence on $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ than seen in local galaxies. Our results indicate that the regulatory processes linking star formation, gas flows, and metal enrichment were already vigorous $\sim$1 Gyr after the Big Bang, producing the nearly flat metallicity gradient and a stronger coupling between star formation and metallicity than observed in evolved systems in the local universe.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a study of the minute-timescale optical variability and spectroscopic outflow signatures in the black hole X-ray binary MAXI J1820+070 during its 2018 outburst and re-brightenings. Minute-cadence, multi-filter optical light curves were obtained with the Las Cumbres Observatory network and the Al Sadeem Observatory (UAE) over 2018-2020, complemented by X-ray data from Swift/BAT, XRT, and MAXI. We also acquired contemporaneous low-resolution optical spectra with the 2.1 m OAN San Pedro Martir and OAGH Cananea telescopes (Mexico) and the 1.5 m G.D. Cassini telescope at Loiano (Italy). The optical fractional rms peaks in the hard state and is dominated by short-timescale flickering that strengthens toward longer wavelengths, suggesting that the variability is jet-driven. In this scenario, inflow fluctuations inject velocity perturbations at the jet base (internal shock model). The variability is quenched in the soft state, with any residual signal likely linked to accretion-flow fluctuations. This behaviour supports the accretion-ejection coupling in black hole binaries and shows that the jet's variability signature extends to optical wavelengths in all hard states. In the faintest hard states, residual optical variability may instead trace cyclo-synchrotron emission from the hot flow. The spectra show double-peaked emission lines and tentative cold-wind signatures during the hard state. Such winds were reported during the main 2018 outburst; here we find evidence of their presence also in later re-brightenings. Their absence in the soft state likely reflects stronger disc ionisation from the higher X-ray flux, suppressing low-ionisation optical features.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic-ray (CR) feedback is widely recognized as a key regulator of galaxy formation. After being accelerated at supernova remnant shocks, CRs propagate through the interstellar medium (ISM), establishing smooth large-scale distributions and driving galactic outflows. The efficiency of this feedback is controlled by the effective transport speed of the CR population, which in turn depends on the competition between CR-driven plasma instabilities and wave damping processes that vary strongly with ISM phase. In cold, dense gas, ion-neutral damping dominates, whereas in warm, diffuse environments, weaker non-linear Landau damping prevails, leading to enhanced CR scattering and slower transport. To investigate these effects, we employ the moving-mesh code Arepo and model CR transport using a two-moment description within the multiphase ISM framework Crisp, which self-consistently computes CR diffusion coefficients and transport velocities from coarse-grained plasma physics. The intrinsic CR diffusion coefficient depends inversely on the scattering rate of CRs and Alfvén waves, covering 15 orders of magnitude. In contrast, we show that the effective CR diffusion coefficient, which quantifies the propagation speed of CRs through the ISM, converges toward the canonical range of $10^{28}$-$10^{29}$ cm$^2$ s$^{-1}$. Simulations with only non-linear Landau damping yield transport rates up to an order of magnitude slower than those including both Landau and ion-neutral damping. Overall, CR transport speeds increase systematically with gas density, for which we provide a density-dependent fit of the effective CR diffusion coefficient. We demonstrate that, despite strong ion-neutral damping in the cold and warm phases of the galactic disk, CRs are transported at speeds only a few times the local Alfvén speed as they traverse alternating ISM phases on their way out of the galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 We model the evolution of 21 Gaia neutron star (NS)-main-sequence binaries (orbital period $P_{\mathrm{orb}}\sim200$--$1000$ days, eccentricity $e\gtrsim0.2$) using binary evolution with \texttt{MESA}. We examine eccentric mass transfer and models assuming prior circularization. All systems end as NS-white dwarf (WD) binaries, but transfer modes yield distinct outcomes. Under eccentric transfer, binaries are driven to higher $e$, forming orbits with $e\gtrsim0.6$ and $P_{\rm orb}\sim1000$-$4000$ days. Periastron bursts are brief ($\lesssim10^6$ yr), transfer only a few $\times10^{-2}$ M$_\odot$, and produce mildly recycled pulsars ($P_{\mathrm{spin}}\gtrsim50$ ms) with low-mass He WDs. Artificially circularized transfer gives $P_{\rm orb}\sim200$-$2000$ days, lasts $\sim10^7$ yr, and allows NSs to accrete $\sim0.1$ M$_\odot$, forming fully recycled MSPs ($P_{\mathrm{spin}}\sim$ few-30 ms) with CO WDs. Allowing super-Eddington accretion up to $100\times$ the canonical rate makes even eccentric systems efficient MSP producers, though torque coupling remains uncertain. Using an adaptive, field-dependent magnetic-field decay timescale, we find MSPs stay radio-active over Gyr spans. Gaia systems undergoing stable mass transfer remain wide and fail to match the Galactic MSP-WD population, where most, nearly circular systems have $P_{\rm orb}\lesssim100$ days. Binaries with different mass ratios and initial configurations -- likely leading to unstable mass transfer -- are needed to reproduce the observed MSP-WD distribution.

 - **Abstract**
 Protostellar multiplicity is a common outcome of the star formation process. To fully understand the formation and evolution of these systems, the physical parameters of the molecular gas together with the dust must be systematically characterized. Using observations of molecular gas tracers, we characterize the physical properties of cloud cores in the Perseus molecular cloud (average distance of 295 pc) at envelope scales (5000-8000 AU). We used Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX) and Nobeyama 45m Radio Observatory (NRO) observations of DCO$^+$, H$_2$CO and c-C$_3$H$_2$ in several transitions to derive the physical parameters of the gas toward 31 protostellar systems in Perseus. Gas kinetic temperature was obtained from DCO$^+$, H$_2$CO and c-C$_3$H$_2$ line ratios. Column densities and gas masses were then calculated for each species and transition. Gas kinetic temperature and gas masses were compared with bolometric luminosity, envelope dust mass, and multiplicity to search for statistically significant correlations. Gas kinetic temperature derived from DCO$^+$, H$_2$CO and c-C$_3$H$_2$ line ratios have average values of 14 K, 26 and 16 K, respectively, with a range of 10-26 K for DCO$^+$ and c-C$_3$H$_2$. The gas kinetic temperature obtained from H$_2$CO line ratios have a range of 13-82 K. Column densities of all three molecular species are on the order of 10$^{11}$ to 10$^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$, resulting in gas masses of 10$^{-11}$ to 10$^{-9}$ M$_{\odot}$. Statistical analysis of the physical parameters finds: i) similar envelope gas and dust masses for single and binary protostellar systems; ii) multiple (>2 components) protostellar systems tend to have slightly higher gas and dust masses than binaries and single protostars; iii) a continuous distribution of gas and dust masses is observed regardless of separation between components in protostellar systems.

 - **Abstract**
 We present bolometric corrections, as a function of wavelength, for powerful radio-loud quasars from the Revised Third Cambridge Catalogue of Radio Galaxies (3CRR) at 1 < z < 2. The bolometric luminosities are derived by integrating the intrinsic accretion disk spectral energy distributions (SEDs) over the range 1{\mu}m-10keV (excluding reprocessed infrared emission) and integrating over inclination angles (to account for accretion disk emission anisotropy). We use accretion disk models, fitted to observed data, to self-consistently bridge the unobserved wavelength region between the UV and X-rays with no need for far-UV gap repair. The resulting bolometric corrections span a wide range (~1-400) across different wavelengths, showing minimal dependence on redshift, X-ray luminosity, and black hole mass, which is possibly due to a narrow range of these intrinsic AGN parameters in the sample. However, when the sample is divided by Eddington ratio, the X-ray bolometric corrections exhibit distinctly different values, with higher correction factors corresponding to higher Eddington ratios. We also examine the connection between total radio luminosity and accretion disk power. For most 3CRR sources, the radio power constitutes roughly 1%-10% of the accretion disk luminosity. However, quasars with compact jets exhibit higher radio luminosities for a given accretion disk power. This suggests a higher efficiency of conversion of accretion power to radio luminosity in the younger jets. Our results provide physically motivated bolometric corrections for powerful radio quasars that are applicable to powerful radio-loud quasars at any epoch.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper we focus on the analysis of the multiwavelength spectroscopic observations of a quiescent prominence. The spectral and geometrical parameters in the prominence were derived and used to constrain the NLTE radiative transfer models. Applying this method with multiwavelength observations provides a good opportunity to reduce the large range of thermodynamic parameters in solar prominences. We used time-slice and optical flow methods in order to derive the plane-of-sky (POS) velocities, and used gravity center and peak position methods on Mg II h&k and H I Ly-alpha profiles to compute the line-of-sight (LOS) velocities. We used the integrated intensities and FWHM values of the H-alpha, Ca II H, and Mg II h&k lines to compare with the NLTE radiative transfer computations. Ionization degree and thickness of the prominence plasma could be further derived. Opposite flows are observed along two strands between prominence barbs. The POS velocity can reach 20 km/s and the largest LOS velocity is > 90 km/s. The derived electron densities range from 6.5e9 cm-3 to 2.7e10 cm-3, and the derived total hydrogen densities range from 7.4e9 cm-3 to 6.6e10 cm-3. The temperature ranges from 7 000 to 14 000 K. The ionization degree of hydrogen is in the range of 0.40 to 0.91. The comparison between averaged and modeled profiles of Mg II and Ly-alpha lines shows that macro-velocities of 15 km/s and 20 km/s are required, respectively. The bulk motions among prominence barbs indicate that the prominence plasma is not confined within magnetic dips but exhibits a large-scale behavior. The presence of high-speed cool plasma flows, along with a wide range of plasma densities and temperatures, suggests that the prominence plasma is far from thermodynamic equilibrium and is inherently dynamic in nature.

 - **Abstract**
 The repeating behavior of fast radio bursts (FRBs) is regarded as a key clue to understanding their physical origin, yet reliably distinguishing repeaters from apparent non-repeaters with current observations remains challenging. Here we propose a physically interpretable and practically quantifiable classification framework based on spectral morphology. Using dimensionality reduction, clustering, and feature-importance analysis, we identify the spectral running $r$ and spectral index $\gamma$ as the most critical parameters for distinguishing repeaters from apparent non-repeaters in the CHIME/FRB sample. In the $\gamma$-$r$ space, repeaters preferentially occupy regions with steeper, narrower-band spectra, whereas non-repeaters cluster in flatter, broader-band regions, resulting in a clear density separation. We further construct an empirical probability map in the $\gamma$-$r$ space, showing a clear gradient of repetition likelihood, from $\sim 65\%$ in the high-repetition region to $\sim 5\%$ in the low-repetition region. Combining this with Gaussian Mixture Model posterior analysis, we identify several apparent non-repeaters with high inferred repetition probability, recommending them as priority targets for future monitoring. This framework provides a simple and generalizable tool for assessing repeatability in the CHIME/FRB sample and highlights the diagnostic power of spectral morphology in unveiling FRB origins.

 - **Abstract**
 The Rossby Wave Instability (RWI) has become an important concept in understanding the hydrodynamics (HDs) of accretion discs (ADs), especially in systems around black holes (BHs) where magnetic effects are either weak or absent. This instability is triggered by extrema (or sharp gradients) in the vortensity profile of the disc. Once activated, it leads to non-axisymmetric disturbances that can grow into large-scale vortices. These vortices play a significant role in the outward transport of angular momentum (AM). They may also help explain the presence of quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) observed in certain astrophysical systems such as X-ray binaries (XRBs). Here we review the main theoretical ideas behind RWI, as well as findings from more advanced three-dimensional (3D) and relativistic simulations. We also mention how the theory has been extended to include magnetic fields and self-gravity(SG) and what these results might imply for actual observations.

 - **Abstract**
 There exist extremely massive spiral galaxies in isolated environments, with stellar masses several times that of the Milky Way, yet their star formation rates (SFRs) are comparable to or even lower than that of the Milky Way. In this paper, we investigate the molecular gas properties of such galaxies to better understand the origin of their low SFRs. We present IRAM 30m CO observations of five extremely massive spirals from the CGM-MASS sample. We compare their star formation efficiencies (SFEs) with the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation and find that these massive spirals generally exhibit low efficiency in converting molecular gas into stars. We further compare their molecular gas masses with their atomic gas and stellar masses, and also include the CHANG-ES sample galaxies observed with the IRAM 30m telescope in a similar manner for comparison. Our sample galaxies show low efficiency in converting atomic to molecular gas and have lower molecular gas fractions, suggesting that their suppressed star formation stems from both limited gas supply and inefficient star formation. Considering potential cold gas sources in massive spirals, we argue that their current reservoirs likely originate from past starburst or merger events rather than ongoing accretion in present isolated environments. Finally, we examine the location of these galaxies on the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation, finding them baryon-deficient and deviating from the trend of lower-mass galaxies. This suggests either a significant undetected baryonic component or a flattening/turnover of the relation at the high-mass end, consistent with the stellar mass-halo mass relation.

 - **Abstract**
 The physical origin of soft X-ray excess (SE) is a long lasting question, with two prevailing theories -- ``warm corona'' and ``ionized reflection'' -- dominating the discussion. In the warm corona scenario, SE originates from upscattered disk photons and should therefore correlate strongly with UV emission. Conversely, in the ionized reflection scenario, SE arises from the illumination of the accretion disk by the hot corona and should primarily correlate with the hard X-ray primary continuum (PC). In this second paper of the series, we investigate the correlations among SE, UV and PC, leveraging a sample of 59 unobscured type 1 AGNs compiled in \citet{Chen+2025a}. Our extensive analysis reveals a strong intrinsic correlation between SE and UV that remains robust after controlling for PC ($p_\mathrm{null}\lesssim 10^{-7}$). In contrast, the correlation between SE and PC is weaker but still statistically significant ($p_\mathrm{null}\lesssim 5\times 10^{-2}$). These findings suggest that, in addition to ionized reflection -- a natural outcome of the hot corona illuminating the disk -- a warm corona component is essential, and may even dominate, in producing the soft excess. Additionally, we report a mild anti-correlation between SE strength ($q$) and PC photon index ($\Gamma_\mathrm{PC}$) ($p_\mathrm{null}=10^{-2}$), suggesting a potential competition between the warm and hot coronae. Finally, we find that the $\Gamma_\mathrm{PC}$ values we derived with SE properly incorporated exhibit a much weaker correlation with $\lambda_\mathrm{Edd}$ ($p_\mathrm{null}=2\times 10^{-2}$) than previously reported in the literature. This highlights the critical role of accurately modeling SE in studies of the $\Gamma_\mathrm{PC}$--$\lambda_\mathrm{Edd}$ relation.

 - **Abstract**
 Utilizing cosmological hydrodynamic simulations we show that there is a brief super-Eddington accretion phase in typical halos at high redshift, impervious to AGN self-regulation. However, once having attained a black hole mass of $10^4-10^5\msun$, AGN feedback process can self-regulate to guide the SMBHs to grow at a significantly slower, sub-Eddington rate. By redshift $z\sim 10$ the black hole mass with an initial super-Eddington jump-start is caught up by that in the case with a steady Eddington limited case. Thus a continuous Eddington limit case represents the fastest possible route to maximally grow SMBHs. To account for the observed $z=7-10$ quasars with supermassive black holes of billions of solar masses, our analysis establishes firmer ground for the need of seed masses of $10^4-10^5\msun$ that are not grown via an earlier super-Eddington phase.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a publicly available catalogue of massive structures in the nearby Universe, constructed from the Manticore-Local posterior ensemble -- a Bayesian reconstruction of the local Universe from 2M++ galaxies. We identify massive structures by clustering central haloes at $z = 0$ across the 80 posterior realizations, selecting at most one member per realization. These $\textit{associations}$ serve as probabilistic counterparts to individual massive clusters, each with robust posterior estimates of mass, position, and velocity. The catalogue contains 225 associations with mean masses $\langle M_{200} \rangle > 10^{14}$ M$_{\odot}$ persisting in at least 50\% of realizations. We independently validate these systems through stacked \textit{Planck} thermal Sunyaev--Zel'dovich measurements, which yield significant detections ($>3\sigma$) with amplitudes following the expected $Y$--$M$ relation. Many associations exhibit coherent evolutionary histories: even with only $z = 0$ constraints, the inference narrows each system's possible assembly pathway, localizing progenitor configurations to volumes 2--5 times smaller than mass-matched haloes in unconstrained $\Lambda$CDM simulations. Cross-matches with X-ray catalogues reveal systematic mass-scale differences that align with known observational biases: \textsc{Manticore-Local} masses are typically twice ROSAT-based estimates but agree at unity with weak-lensing-calibrated eROSITA measurements. This demonstrates the catalogue's capability to diagnose systematics on an object-by-object basis. The resulting catalogue provides an observationally consistent map of massive structures in the local Universe, enabling direct cross-probe comparisons, hybrid analyses combining simulated and observed quantities, and systematic mass-scale studies.

 - **Abstract**
 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are some of the brightest and most variable objects in the universe. Those with relativistic jets observed at small viewing angles are blazars. Due to Doppler-boosting, blazars exhibit extreme stochastic variability. While the origin of this variability is thought to be changes in the accretion flow and jet dynamics, much about blazar variability remains unknown. In this paper we use several blazar-dominated AGN samples to form a catalog of 7918 blazars and candidates -- the largest to date. We also collect source types, redshifts, spectral energy distribution (SED) peak frequencies, radio variability Doppler factors, and X-ray flux densities for as many sources as possible. We use all-sky surveys (CRTS, ATLAS, and ZTF, abbreviated as ``CAZ'') to extract their optical multiband flux density on a nightly basis between 2007 and 2023, and construct as long and as high cadence light curves as possible for as many sources as attainable. The catalog and its light curves are provided in the accompanying electronic tables, enabling many analyses involving AGN variability with unprecedented sample-sizes. We quantify the variability of the light curves, and apply the Bayesian blocks algorithm to determine their flaring periods. We find: (1) optical flares generally have a faster rise than decay; (2) optical brightness and variability are strongly dependent on the synchrotron peak frequency; (3) flat spectrum radio quasars and BL Lac objects have comparable optical variability and flare characteristics at the same synchrotron peak frequency; and (4) optical flare times tend to decrease and amplitudes increase with increasing radio variability Doppler factor.

 - **Abstract**
 Over the past decade, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory has detected a few hundreds of high-energy (HE) neutrinos from cosmic sources. Despite numerous studies searching for their origin, it is still not known which source populations emit them. A few confident individual associations exist with active galactic nuclei (AGN), mostly with blazars which are jetted AGN whose jet points in our direction. Nonetheless, on a population level, blazar-neutrino correlation strengths are rather weak. This could mean that blazars as a population do not emit HE neutrinos, or that the detection power of the tests is insufficient due to the strong atmospheric neutrino background. By assuming an increase in HE neutrino emission during major blazar flares, in our previous studies we leveraged the arrival time of the neutrinos to boost the detection power. In this paper we utilize the same principle while substantially increasing the number of blazars. We search for the spatio-temporal correlation of 356 IceCube HE neutrinos with major optical flares of 3225 radio- and 3814 $\gamma$-ray-selected blazars. We find that, despite the increase in data size, the number of confident spatio-temporal associations remains low and the overall correlation strengths weak. Two individual associations drive our strongest and the only $>$2$\sigma$ post-trial spatio-temporal correlation, occurring with the BL Lac objects of the radio-selected blazar sample. We estimate that $\lesssim$8\% of the detected cosmic neutrinos were emitted by blazars during major optical flares. As a complementary analysis, we compare the synchrotron peak frequency, redshift, Doppler factor, X-ray brightness, and optical variability of spatially neutrino-associated blazars to those of the general blazar population. We find that spatially neutrino-associated blazars of the tested samples have higher than average Doppler factor and X-ray brightness.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar flares are complex phenomena driven by the release of magnetic energy, but a large energy reservoir is not sufficient to determine their eruptive potential; the magnetic topology and plasma dynamics play a key role. We investigate the thermodynamic and magnetic properties of the solar atmosphere during the rise, peak, and decay phases of a C5.1-class flare and filament eruption in active region NOAA 12561 on 2016 July 7, to understand the origin and atmospheric response of this event. High spatial and spectral resolution spectropolarimetric observations of the chromospheric Ca II 8542A line and nearby photospheric lines were obtained with the TRIPPEL-SP spectropolarimeter at the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope. Using non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) inversions and non-force-free field (NFFF) magnetic extrapolations, we followed the event's evolution from its precursor to its decay. Before the flare, our analysis reveals a complex, sheared magnetic topology with a high free energy content ($\sim2\times10^{30}$ erg). In this precursor phase, we detected persistent, localized heating (temperature increase of $\sim$2000 K) with strong downflows ($\sim$10-20 km/s) deep in the atmosphere. This heating was co-spatial with a bald-patch region, suggesting that low-altitude magnetic reconnection could destabilize the filament of the region. The flare's rise phase was marked by the filament's eruption, with a total speed larger than $\sim$70 km/s, when combining inversions and plane-of-sky motions. Following the eruption, the free energy decreased by $\sim$30$\%$ as post-flare loops formed, connecting the flare ribbons and channeling the released energy into the lower atmosphere. The flare ribbons exhibited significant heating to $\sim$8500 K and downflows up to $\sim$10 km/s, consistent with energy deposition along reconnected loops.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the effect of turbulent magnetic fields on the observed spectral properties of synchrotron radio emission in large-scale radio galaxy lobes. We use three-dimensional relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of fast, high-powered jets to study the structure of the lobe magnetic fields and how this structure affects the radio spectrum of the lobes. It has previously been argued that lobe ages inferred from radio spectra underestimate the true ages of radio galaxies due to re-acceleration of electrons in the lobe, mixing of electron populations, or the presence of turbulent magnetic fields in the lobes. We find that the spectral ages with and without accounting for the lobe magnetic field structure are consistent with each other, suggesting that mixing of radiating populations of different ages is the primary cause of the underestimation of radio lobe ages. By accounting for the structure of lobe magnetic fields, we find greater spectral steepening in the equatorial regions of the lobe. We demonstrate that the assumptions of the continuous injection, Jaffe-Perola, and Tribble models for radio lobe spectra do not hold in our simulations, and we show that young particles with high magnetic field strengths are the dominant contributors to the overall radio lobe spectrum.

 - **Abstract**
 It is well known that the nonlinear evolution of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence generates intermittent current sheets. In the solar wind turbulence, current sheets are frequently observed and they are believed to be an important pathway for the turbulence energy to dissipate and heat the plasma. In this study, we perform a comprehensive analysis of current sheets in a high-resolution two-dimensional simulation of balanced, incompressible MHD turbulence. The simulation parameters are selected such that tearing mode instability is triggered and plasmoids are generated throughout the simulation domain. We develop an automated method to identify current sheets and accurately quantify their key parameters including thickness ($a$), length ($L$), and Lundquist number ($S$). Before the triggering of tearing instability, the current sheet lengths are mostly comparable to the energy injection scale. After the tearing mode onsets, smaller current sheets with lower Lundquist numbers are generated. We find that the aspect ratio ($a/L$) of the current sheets scales approximately as $S^{-1/2}$, i.e. the Sweet-Parker scaling. While a power-law scaling between $L$ and $a$ is observed, no clear correlation is found between the upstream magnetic field strength and thickness $a$. Finally, although the turbulence energy shows anisotropy between the directions parallel and perpendicular to the local magnetic field increment, we do not observe a direct correspondence between the shape of the current sheets and that of the turbulence "eddies." These results suggest that one needs to be cautious when applying the scale-dependent dynamic alignment model to the analysis of current sheets in MHD turbulence.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed analysis of AGN identification diagnostics and host galaxy evolution using optical spectral diagnostics using ESO-GOODS-S data. We employ traditional Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) diagrams along with their modern extensions, the Mass-Excitation (MEx) and Colour-Excitation (CEx) diagrams, to classify AGNs from among up to 600+ candidates. We extract the spectral properties utilising an indigenous spectral fitting code. In addition, the code also incorporates inputs from a state-of-the-art stellar population synthesis model (Bruzual and Charlot, 2003, MNRAS, 344, 1000), extracting the host galaxy ages and metallicities as model parameters. Redshift values for all the studied spectra are obtained from the literature. Using these redshift values, we are able to assign a 'lookback time' (using standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological parameters). When this lookback time is combined with the galaxy ages (from spectral fitting), it enables us to study galaxy evolution even up to early cosmological epochs ($\sim$13 Gyr), despite restricting the studied field of galaxies to $z\sim 1$ (lookback time of $\sim$8 Gyr). We conclude that galaxies ultimately evolving into AGN hosts originate earlier ($\sim$8 Gyr ago) than non-AGN host galaxies ($\sim$6 Gyr ago). We relate this fact, that AGN hosts date back to an earlier epoch than non-AGN galaxies, as being likely due to higher cosmic temperatures at that time, probably enhancing black hole accretion. We emphasise that host galaxy age is an additional crucial parameter (apart from cosmological redshift) in defining our understanding of AGN and star formation co-evolution across cosmological time scales.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar surface inhomogeneities such as spots and faculae introduce Doppler variations that challenge exoplanet detection via the radial velocity method. While their impact on disc-integrated spectra is well established, detailed studies of the underlying local line profiles have so far been limited to the Sun. We present an observational campaign targeting the active star WASP-85 A during transits of its hot Jupiter companion. The transits span two stellar rotation periods, allowing us to probe the evolution of active regions. From ground-based photometry we identify seven active regions, six containing dark spots. Using simultaneous ESPRESSO transit spectroscopy, we spatially resolve these regions on the stellar surface by using the planet as a probe. We detect significant bisector shape changes, line broadening, and net redshifts during spot occultations, with velocity shifts of 108-333 m/s (mean uncertainty 50 m/s). The observed broadening is consistent with the Zeeman effect, implying magnetic field strengths (Stokes $I$) $B$ = 2.7-4.4 kG (mean uncertainty 0.6 kG), comparable to solar umbrae. Combined with our photometric spot model, this yields lower limits to the disc-integrated field $Bf = 16 \pm 3$ G and $61 \pm 9$ G for the two hemispheres probed -- at least three times higher than Sun-as-a-star values. We also measure centre-to-limb variations in FWHM, line depth, equivalent width, and convective blueshift, which broadly agree with solar observations and 3D MHD models. This work demonstrates a new way to characterise the surfaces of exoplanet host stars, paving the way for future analyses incorporating synthetic line profiles from 3D MHD simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 Variability studies are a powerful tool for studying the structures of unresolved sources. One such type of variability study, called reverberation mapping (RM), established that the dominant source of infrared radiation from an active galactic nucleus (AGN) was from dust absorption and re-emission, which demonstrated that the optical brightening and fading of light from the accretion disk (AD) around a supermassive black hole was followed by a corresponding (delayed) variation at infrared (IR) wavelengths from the surrounding dust distribution. Since that time a great deal more has been learned about the dust distribution around ADs, both near the AD in the form of a potential torus, as well as extended emission in the form of polar dust outflows. Understanding the dust distribution is vital to understanding how AGNs affect their host galaxy as well as the overall energetics of AGNs as ~50% of energy from an AGN comes out in the IR. Dust RM has been done exclusively in the near-IR (1-5 microns) which traces the inner edge of the dust near the dust sublimation radius. Hence extending RM to the mid-IR, especially to the peak of the dust emission between 25 and 30 microns, allows for an examination of the dust distribution around ADs and potentially traces the source of the polar outflow. RM with the proposed PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA) can focus on variability monitoring of a sample of low- to high-luminosity AGNs to trace the 25-30 microns emission that is reverberated from the UV/optical AD emission which will be monitored by other space and ground-based observatories and made available to PRIMA users. Then, by detailed modeling of the response of the dust emission to shorter wavelengths, the distribution of the dust around an AGN will be revealed and can be linked to the accretion disk luminosities.

 - **Abstract**
 Asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars are important to chemical evolution at metallicity $Z \sim 0.0001$ ($\text{[Fe/H]} \approx -2.2$) as they contribute significantly to the production of nitrogen, lead, and dust in the early Universe. The contribution of AGB stars to the chemical evolution of the Universe is often quantified using the chemical yields from single AGB stars. Binary evolution challenges our understanding of chemical evolution as binary phenomena such as mergers and mass transfer episodes can significantly alter the stellar evolution pathways and yields. In this work, we use binary population synthesis code binary_c to model populations of low and intermediate-mass ($\sim 0.7-7 \, M_{\rm \odot}$) stars at metallicity $Z = 0.0001$. Our binary star populations predict $\sim 37\%$ fewer thermally-pulsing AGB stars than our single star populations, leading to a $\sim 40\%$ decrease in the amount of ejected C and a $\sim 35-40\%$ reduction in elements synthesised through the slow neutron capture process. The uncertainty introduced by the mass-loss from stellar winds on the AGB makes the impact of binary evolution on the total amount of ejected N uncertain. The total N yield ejected by our binary star populations ranges from a $17\%$ to a $36\%$ decrease compared to our single star populations. However, our binary populations overproduce N by over an order of magnitude during the period $300-700\,$Myr after formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Decaying pulsations have been simultaneously detected in the low-energy X-rays of solar/stellar flares, which are supposed to be associated with standing slow magnetoacoustic or kink-mode waves. The physical mechanism behind rapidly decaying remains unknown. We present the detection of quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) with rapidly decaying in high-energy emissions produced in two major flares on 10 January and 14 May 2024. Using empirical mode decomposition, decaying QPPs are identified in hard X-ray and microwave emissions during the flare impulsive phase, suggesting a process of oscillatory magnetic reconnection. The quasi-periods and decay times are determined by a damped harmonic function, which are approximately 177$\pm$8 s (249$\pm$25 s) and 118$\pm$4 s (124$\pm$5 s), respectively. The restructured X-ray images reveal double footpoints connected by hot flare loops. Their phase speeds are estimated to about 400 km/s and 670 km/s, both below the local sound speed in high-temperature plasmas, indicating the presence of slow-mode waves in hot flare loops. We perform coronal diagnostics based on standing slow-mode waves and derive key physical parameters, including the polytropic index, the thermal ratio, viscous ratio and radiation ratio, which are consistent with previous results. Our observations support that the decaying QPPs are triggered by oscillatory magnetic reconnection that is modulated by standing slow magnetoacoustic waves, with their rapid decay attributable to a co-effect of viscous damping and localized magnetic reconnection rate.

 - **Abstract**
 We examine 3He-rich solar energetic particles (SEPs) detected on 2023 October 24-25 by Solar Orbiter at 0.47 au. The measurements revealed that heavy-ion enhancements increase irregularly with mass, peaking at S. C, and especially N, Si, and S, stand out in the enhancement pattern with large abundances. Except for 3He, heavy ion spectra can only be measured below 0.5 MeV/nucleon. At 0.386 MeV/nucleon, the event showed a huge 3He/4He ratio of 75.2+/-33.9, larger than previously observed. Solar Dynamics Observatory extreme ultraviolet data showed a mini filament eruption at the solar source of 3He-rich SEPs that triggered a straight tiny jet. Located at the boundary of a low-latitude coronal hole, the jet base is a bright, small-scale region with a supergranulation scale size. The emission measure provides relatively cold source temperatures of 1.5 to 1.7 MK between the filament eruption and nonthermal type III radio burst onset. The analysis suggests that the emission measure distribution of temperature in the solar source could be a factor that affects the preferential selection of heavy ions for heating or acceleration, thus shaping the observed enhancement pattern. Including previously reported similar events indicates that the eruption of the mini filament is a common feature of events with heavy-ion enhancement not ordered by mass. Surprisingly, sources with weak magnetic fields showed extreme 3He enrichment in these events. Moreover, the energy attained by heavy ions seems to be influenced by the size and form of jets.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first joint high-resolution observations of small-scale EUV jets using Solar Orbiter(SolO)'s Extreme Ultraviolet Imager and High Resolution Imager (HRI) and H$\alpha$ imaging from the Visible Imaging Spectrometer (VIS) installed on the 1.6~m Goode Solar Telescope (GST) at the Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO). These jets occurred on 2022-10-29 around 19:10 UT in a quiet Sun region and their main axis aligns with the overarching magnetic structure traced by a cluster of spicules. However, they develop a helical morphology, while the H$\alpha$ spicules maintain straight, linear trajectories elsewhere. Alongside the spicules, thin, elongated red- and blue-shifted H$\alpha$ features appear to envelope the EUV jets, which we tentatively call sheath flows. The EUI jet moving upward at speed of ~110 km/s is joined by strong H$\alpha$ red-shift ~20 km/s to form the bidirectional outflows lasting ~2 min. Using AI-assisted differential emission measure (DEM) analysis of SolO's Full Sun Imager (FSI) we derived total energy of the EUV jet as ~$1.9 \times 10^{26}$ erg with 87% in thermal energy and 13% in kinetic energy. The parameters and morphology of this small-scale EUV jet are interpreted based on a thin flux tube model that predicts Alfvenic waves driven by impulsive interchange reconnection localized as narrowly as ~1.6 Mm with magnetic flux of ~$5.4\times 10^{17}$ Mx, belonging to the smallest magnetic features in the quiet Sun. This detection of intricate corona--chromospheric coupling highlights the power of high-resolution imaging in unraveling the mechanisms behind small-scale solar ejections across atmospheric layers.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new high precision parametric strong lensing total mass reconstruction of the Euclid Early Release Observations (ERO) galaxy cluster Abell 2390, at redshift z = 0.231. We include in this analysis 35 multiple images from 13 background sources, of which 25 are spectroscopically confirmed thanks to observations from the MUSE, spanning a redshift range from z = 0.535 to z = 4.877. After fully reanalysing the MUSE spectroscopy, we combine it with archival spectroscopic catalogues allowing us to select 65 secure cluster members. This sample is further complemented with 114 photometric member galaxies, identified within the Euclid VIS and NISP imaging down to magnitude H = 23. We also measure the stellar velocity dispersions for 22 cluster members, in order to calibrate the Faber-Jackson relation and hence the scaling relations for the subhalo mass components. We test and compare 11 total mass parametrisations of the galaxy cluster with increasing complexity. To do so, we employ the new parametric strong lensing modelling code this http URL. Our best fit total mass parametrisation is characterised by a single large scale halo, 179 subhalo components, and an external shear term. The reference model yields a mean scatter between the model predicted and observed positions of the multiple images of 0.32 arcseconds. We are able to quantify the systematics arising from our modelling choices by taking advantage of all the different explored total mass parametrisations. When our results are compared with those from other lensing studies, we notice an overall agreement in the reconstructed cluster total mass profile in the outermost strong lensing regime: the discrepancy in the innermost region of the cluster (few kiloparsec from the brightest cluster galaxy, where few or no strong lensing features are observed) could possibly be ascribed to the different data and modelling choices.

 - **Abstract**
 In astrophysical systems like X-ray binaries (XRBs), active galactic nuclei (AGN), and young stellar objects (YSOs), we often observe a very fundamental structure called accretion discs(ADs). Conventional AD theory usually supposes that the gravitational field is controlled by a central compact object. This assumption breaks down when the mass of the disc becomes considerable in contrast to that of the massive central object. In these cases, the AD's self-gravity (SG) can drastically change its structure, dynamics, and evolution. This review investigates how SG influences the radial and vertical structure of ADs and how it modifies the mechanisms that transport angular momentum (AM). Along with these, this review also tries to explore how gravitational instabilities (GIs) evolve and how they affect disc fragmentation and astrophysical phenomena like stellar and planetary formation, AGN dynamics, and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs).

 - **Abstract**
 We perform general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers with four distinct magnetic field topologies: (i) a dipole pulsar-like configuration, (ii) a mixed linear superposition of poloidal and toroidal components inside the star, and (iii-iv) two topologies featuring a smooth transition from a confined mixed core to a pulsar-like structure at radii $0.95\,R_{\rm NS}$ and $0.5\,R_{\rm NS}$, with $R_{\rm NS}$ the radius of the star. The latter topologies are explored in BNS merger studies for the first time. We evolve systems with two equations of state (EoS), SLy and WFF1, with ADM masses 2.7 and 2.6, respectively, and include an additional lower-mass SLy binary to probe the behavior of long-lived remnants. We perform an extensive analysis of the emission properties of the systems, both electromagnetic and gravitational waves, and of the properties of the remnants, namely their frequency modes, density eigenfunctions, rotation, temperature, and convective stability. We report three key results: (1) for the first time, we assess the convective stability of magnetized remnants, extending previous unmagnetized analyses; (2) we identify a clear secondary peak in the gravitational-wave spectrum of pulsar-like configurations, consistent with the nonlinear coupling of the $m=0$ and $m=2$ modes, which is absent in other topologies; and (3) the magnetic field topology strongly influences the gravitational wave emission properties to the extent that nearby ($<50\,{\rm Mpc}$) events could allow one to observationally distinguish between different field structures with future gravitational-wave detectors. Across all models, we obtain luminosities compatible with short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs), with purely poloidal configurations being the most efficient in driving possible relativistic jets.

 - **Abstract**
 Active galactic nucleus (AGNs) feedback is widely accepted as the key mechanism to suppress cooling flows in galaxy clusters. However, the dependence of heating efficiency on jet properties is not fully understood. In this work, we present three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of a Perseus-like cluster, including both single-jet and self-regulated models, to investigate how jet density affects bubble evolution and the thermal balance of the intracluster medium. Our results confirm previous findings that lighter jets inflate more spherical bubbles and are more easily deflected by cold gas, enabling isotropic energy deposition throughout the cluster core. However, despite their broader spatial impact, lighter jets display lower overall heating efficiency, requiring higher average jet power to maintain self-regulation compared to heavier jets. We also find that the distribution and amount of cold gas significantly influence the effectiveness of jet heating. These results highlight jet density as a critical parameter in AGN feedback and emphasize the need to incorporate additional physical processes such as magnetic fields, viscosity, and cosmic rays in future studies for realistic comparisons with observations.

 The IceCube neutrino observatory has been successfully operating in its full configuration for almost 15 years and is characterized by a remarkably high stability and uptime. During this time, it has made many groundbreaking observations, such as the first detection of a high-energy diffuse cosmic neutrino flux or, more recently, the identification of the AGN NGC1068 as a steady source of high-energy neutrino emission and the observation of neutrinos from the Milky Way. In this talk, new developments in these areas will be discussed and further highlights presented. The second part then looks at the ongoing developments at the South Pole with IceCube Upgrade and IceCube-Gen2 and discusses their potential for advancing neutrino and astroparticle physics.

 - **Abstract**
 Detecting coherent radio bursts from nearby M dwarfs provides opportunities for exploring their magnetic activity and interaction with orbiting exoplanets. However, it remains uncertain if the emission is related to flare-like activity similar to the Sun or magnetospheric process akin to magnetized planets. Using observations (1.0 - 1.5 GHz) taken by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope, we found a type of millisecond-scale radio bursts with exceptionally high frequency drift rates ($\sim 8\;\rm{GHz\;s^{-1}}$) from an active M dwarf, AD Leo. The ultrafast drift rates point to a source region with a notably low magnetic scale height ($<0.15\; r_\star$, $r_\star$ as the stellar radius), a feature not expected in a commonly assumed dipole-like global field but highly possible in localized strong-field structures, i.e. starspots. Our findings suggest that a concentrated magnetic field above starspots could be responsible for some of the most intense radio bursts from M dwarfs, supporting a solar-like electron acceleration mechanism.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the ionised gas properties and metallicity gradients of 43 galaxies observed by the MEGADES survey. Using the MEGARA (Multi-Espectrografo en GTC de Alta Resolucion para Astronomia) instrument, our data combine relatively high spectral (R ~ 6000) and spatial (0.62 arcsec) resolution to study the ionised gas through classic BPT diagnostics in the [N II] and [S II] variants. We examine how these diagrams vary with radius and with the velocity dispersion of the H-alpha line, and we propose a new diagnostic based on the ratio between the velocity dispersions of the [N II] 6584 and H-alpha lines to disentangle the relative roles of AGN, shocks and H II regions. Many regions, regardless of galactocentric distance, show shock-like emission, inferred from their line ratios (high [N II]6584/H-alpha and intermediate [O III]5007/H-beta) and their location between H II and AGN regimes. This improved selection of H II-like regions enables robust oxygen abundance estimates using the N2 indicator. Most galaxies show negligible metallicity gradients, especially low-abundance (<8.37 dex) fast rotators, with an average slope of 0.005 dex Re^-1 and a dispersion of 0.42 dex Re^-1. Above 8.37 dex, fast rotators display mildly negative gradients (mean -0.68 dex Re^-1, dispersion 0.93). For the full MEGADES sample, the mean gradient is -0.03 dex Re^-1 with a dispersion of 0.77. We discuss the implications for the influence of galactic winds on abundance gradients.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a homogeneous spectroscopic analysis of confirmed K2 mission exoplanet-hosting stars, comprising 301 targets with high-resolution optical spectra from HIRES and TRES taken from ExoFOP. We derived effective temperatures, surface gravities, and iron and magnesium abundances in LTE by measuring the equivalent widths of Fe I, Fe II, and Mg I lines. Three estimates of stellar masses and radii were obtained via Stefan-Boltzmann and isochrone methods using the codes PARAM and isochrones. These were used to derive exoplanetary radii reaching internal precisions of 2.5%, 2.6%, and 6.6%, respectively, and the radius gap being consistently detected near 1.9 R$_{\oplus}$. We measured chromospheric activity from the Ca II H & K and H$\alpha$ lines. Within the low-activity range ($\log R^{\prime}_{HK} < -4.75$), stellar activity appears to decrease with increasing planetary radius from super-Earths, sub-Neptunes, sub-Saturns, into the Jupiter regime. According to the [Mg/Fe] measurements, most of our K2 planet hosts belong to the Galactic thin disk, but our sample has a population from the thick disk (high-alpha sequence). Most stars show consistent chemo-dynamical behavior. We find that the [Mg/Fe] ratios are indistinguishable between systems containing Large or Small exoplanets, as well as Single- or Multi-exoplanetary systems. Both the [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] distributions reveal that stars hosting large planets are more iron- and magnesium-enhanced than those having only small planets, further confirming the link between stellar abundances and exoplanetary size, but no significant differences are found between the Single- versus Multi-exoplanetary systems.
#### Relics of High-redshift Compaction in our Backyard: The Most Metal-poor Stars in the Proto-Galaxy

 - **Abstract**
 The earliest assembly of the Milky Way (MW) remains poorly understood, yet the spatial, chemical, and kinematic properties of its most metal-poor stars provide a unique fossil record of its proto-Galaxy phase. Understanding how this ancient component formed is essential for linking near-field Galactic archaeology to high-redshift galaxy evolution. We construct the currently largest 3-D map of inner-Galaxy metal-poor giants by combining several narrow/medium-band photometric surveys, reaching metallicities down to [Fe/H]$\sim-$3.5. Comparing observational data with Auriga 18 (Au18) from the Auriga cosmological simulations, we find that the proto-Galaxy population ([Fe/H]$\lesssim-$1.4) is highly centrally concentrated within the Galactocentric distance $r_{\rm gc}\lesssim$15 kpc, and forms a dispersion-supported structure with negligible rotation. The spatial and chemo-dynamical properties of observed proto-Galaxy population closely match those of the metal-poor stars in Au18. Considering Au18 as an analog of the MW, we propose a new scenario in which the formation of the proto-Galaxy is linked, for the first time, to episodes of high-z (z$\gtrsim$3) gas compaction, blue-nugget phases, and quenching processes. This framework provides a unified physical picture for the first $\sim$1-2 Gyr of the MW's evolution, bridging local fossil records with future studies of early star-forming galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent advances in X-ray spectroscopic observation have enabled researchers to reveal distinct clumpy structures in the super-Eddington outflows from the supermassive black hole in PDS 456 (XRISM Collaboration 2025), initiating detailed investigation of fine-scale structures in accretion-driven outflows. In this study, we conduct high-resolution, two-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamics simulations with time-varying and anisotropic initial and boundary conditions to reproduce outflows launched from super-Eddington accretion flows and analyze their statistical properties. The resulting clumpy outflows extend across a wide range of radial distances and polar angles, exhibiting typical properties such as a size of ~10 rg (where rg is the gravitational radius), a velocity of ~0.05-0.2 c (where c is the speed of light), and about five clumps along the line of sight. Although the velocities are slightly smaller, these characteristics reasonably resemble those obtained from the XRISM observation. The gas density of the clumps is on the order of 10^{-13}-10^{-12} g cm^{-3}, and their optical depth for electron scattering is approximately 1-10. The clumpy winds accelerated by radiation force are considered to originate from the region within <~300 rg.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate graph-based representations of astronomical light curves for transient classification on the MANTRA benchmark. Each series is mapped to three visibility-graph views-horizontal (HVG), directed (DHVG), and weighted (W-HVG)-from which we extract compact, length-aware network descriptors (degree/strength moments, clustering and motifs, assortativity, path/efficiency, and spectral summaries). Using stratified five-fold validation and tree-based learners, the best configuration (LightGBM with HVG+DHVG+W-HVG features) attains a macro-F1 of 0.622 +/- 0.010 and accuracy of 0.661 +/- 0.010, improving over the MANTRA baseline (F1 macro = 0.528). Ablations show that weighted contrasts and directed asymmetry contribute complementary gains to undirected topology. Per-class analysis highlights strong performance for CV, HPM, and Non-Tr., with residual confusions concentrated in the AGN-Blazar-SN block. These results indicate that visibility graphs offer a simple, survey-agnostic bridge between irregular photometric time series and standard classifiers, yielding competitive multiclass performance without bespoke deep architectures. We release code and feature definitions to facilitate reproducibility and future extensions.
#### Formation of super-Earths around low-mass stars: evolution of an icy dead zone

 - **Abstract**
 Exoplanet observations show that close-in super-Earths are more common around M-dwarfs than around solar mass stars. Since the snow line in a protoplanetary disc plays a crucial role in determining the amount of solid material available for planet formation, we explore the icy regions of protoplanetary discs around stars with masses 0.1, 0.5 and 1 $\rm M_\odot$. In a protoplanetary disc, a dead zone, where the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) is suppressed, provides a quiescent region for solids to settle to the mid-plane and planets to form. Viscosity may be driven in the dead zone by gravitational instability if enough material builds up. Heating from the gravitational instability can trigger the MRI and an accretion outburst onto the star. There may be two icy regions in a disc: (1) far from the star and (2) in the dead zone close to the star. We solve the 1D disc equations to find steady state solutions and time-dependent evolution with different values for the critical surface density in the MRI-active surface layers. Larger surface density in the MRI-active surface layers reduces the extent and lifetime of the inner icy region. The inner icy region in the dead zone around a solar mass star is small and short-lived. Around M-dwarfs, the size of the inner icy region is more persistent and oscillates between the accretion outbursts in the region 0.1-1 au. An extended icy region within the dead zone of a disc around M-dwarfs may promote the formation of more numerous and massive close-in super-Earths.

 - **Abstract**
 Work by the Physics at High Angular resolution in Nearby GalaxieS (PHANGS) collaboration found higher molecular gas surface densities and velocity dispersions in the centres of barred galaxies compared to unbarred galaxies. We explore central molecular gas using published high resolution (150 pc) measurements of CO$(2-1)$ from the PHANGS-ALMA survey and a new velocity dispersion-dependent prescription for the CO-to-H$_{2}$ conversion factor $\alpha_{\rm{CO}}$. Comparisons of the molecular gas surface density, velocity dispersion, star formation rate, and depletion time reveal that these quantities are different in the centres of barred and unbarred galaxies. Gas depletion times are found to be shorter in barred galaxy centres. Even when we control for the presence of an AGN, the velocity dispersion and depletion time are found to be statistically different between barred and unbarred galaxy centres. The higher velocity dispersion suggests extra non-circular motions, possibly due to the inflow of gas along the bar, that are not constant but must increase as the star formation rate increases.
#### Resolving the dusty star-forming galaxy GN20 at z=4.055 with NOEMA and JWST: A similar distribution of stars, gas and dust despite distinct apparent profiles

 - **Abstract**
 We present high-resolution (0.13"-0.23") NOEMA observations of the dust continuum emission at 1.1 mm (rest-frame 220 micron) and JWST/NIRCam and MIRI imaging of the z=4.055 starburst galaxy GN20. The sensitive NOEMA imaging at 1.6 kpc resolution reveals extended dust emission, ~14 kpc in diameter (r_e~2.5 kpc, b/a=0.5), that is centrally asymmetric and clumpy. The dust emission is as extended as the stellar emission and the molecular gas traced by CO(2-1), with a common center, and is brightest in the strongly-obscured nuclear part of the galaxy. Approximately one-third of the total dust emission emerges from the nucleus and the most prominent clump to the south, and (only) 60% from the central 3.5x1.5 kpc (0.5"-0.2"), implying that the starburst is very extended. The combined JWST and NOEMA morphology suggests GN20 experienced a recent interaction or merger, likely invigorating the starburst. The radial surface brightness profiles of the molecular gas and near-IR stellar emission are similar, while in contrast, the dust emission appears significantly more concentrated. Through self-consistent radiative transfer modeling of the integrated and resolved CO and dust emission, we derive an $M_{mol}=2.9^{+0.4}_{-0.3}\times10^{11}$ Msun with $\alpha_{CO}=2.8^{+0.5}_{-0.3}$. We find that the extended dust implies a lower global dust optical depth than previously reported, but a high dust mass of $M_{dust}=5.7^{+0.8}_{-0.6}\times 10^{9}$ Msun and gas-to-dust ratio of ~50. Furthermore, we show the distinct apparent radial profiles of the gas and dust can be explained purely by radiative transfer effects and the observations are consistent with the gas and dust mass being similarly distributed throughout the starburst. The latter highlights the importance of accounting for radiative transfer effects when comparing molecular gas and dust distributions from different tracers.
