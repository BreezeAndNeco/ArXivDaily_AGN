#### Relativistic Magnetic Reconnection in Astrophysical Plasmas: A Powerful Mechanism of Nonthermal Emission

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic reconnection -- a fundamental plasma physics process, where magnetic field lines of opposite polarity annihilate -- is invoked in astrophysical plasmas as a powerful mechanism of nonthermal particle acceleration, able to explain fast-evolving, bright high-energy flares. Near black holes and neutron stars, reconnection occurs in the ``relativistic'' regime, in which the mean magnetic energy per particle exceeds the rest mass energy. This review reports recent advances in our understanding of the kinetic physics of relativistic reconnection: (1) Kinetic simulations have elucidated the physics of plasma heating and nonthermal particle acceleration in relativistic reconnection; (2) The physics of radiative relativistic reconnection, with its self-consistent interplay between photons and reconnection-accelerated particles -- a peculiarity of luminous, high-energy astrophysical sources -- is the new frontier of research; (3) Relativistic reconnection plays a key role in global models of high-energy sources, both in terms of global-scale layers, as well as of reconnection sites generated as a byproduct of local magnetohydrodynamic instabilities. We summarize themes of active investigation and future directions, emphasizing the role of upcoming observational capabilities, laboratory experiments, and new computational tools.

 - **Abstract**
 The impending discovery and monitoring of hundreds of new gravitationally lensed quasars and supernovae from upcoming ground and space based large area surveys such as LSST, \textit{Euclid}, and \textit{Roman} necessitates the development of improved numerical methods for studying gravitational microlensing. We present in this work the fastest microlensing map generation code currently publicly available. We utilize graphics processing units to take advantage of the inherent parallelizable nature of creating magnification maps, in addition to using 1) the fast multipole method to reduce the runtime dependence on the number of microlenses and 2) inverse polygon mapping to reduce the number of rays required. The code is available at this https URL.
#### Primordial Gravitational Waves from Phase Transitions during Reheating

 - **Abstract**
 We study primordial gravitational waves (GWs) generated from first-order phase transitions (PTs) during cosmic reheating. Using a minimal particle physics model, and a general parametrization of the inflaton energy density and the evolution of the Standard Model temperature, we explore the conditions under which PTs occur and determine the corresponding PT parameters (the PT temperature, duration and strength), which depend on the evolution of the background during reheating. We find that, in certain cosmological scenarios, PTs can be delayed and prolonged compared to the standard post-inflationary evolution. Incorporating these PT parameters, we compute the resulting GW spectrum generated from the various processes occurring during a first-order PT: bubble collisions, sound waves, and magneto-hydrodynamic turbulence. We find that, in comparison to the standard cosmological history, the GW amplitude and peak frequency can be modified by several orders of magnitude due to the additional enhancement or suppression arising from the cosmological evolution during reheating. In particular, the GW spectra could be within the reach of next-generation GW and CMB observatories.
#### Symmetries and conservation laws in discrete spacetime

 - **Abstract**
 Noether's theorem connects symmetries to invariants in continuous systems, however its extension to discrete systems has remained elusive. Recognizing the lowest-order finite difference as the foundation of local continuity, a viable method for obtaining discrete conservation laws is developed by working in exact analogy to the continuous Noether's theorem. A detailed application is given to electromagnetism, where energy-momentum conservation laws are rapidly obtained in highly generalized forms that disrupt conventional notions regarding conservative algorithms. Field-matter couplings and energy-momentum tensors with optional deviations at the discreteness scale properly reduce in the continuous limit. Nonlocal symmetries give rise to an additional conservation channel for each spacetime displacement, permitting generalized nonlocal couplings. Prescriptions for conservative particle integrators emerge directly from field-matter coupling terms, enabling the development of fully explicit, energy-conserving particle-in-cell algorithms. The demonstration of exact conservation laws in discrete spacetime that preserve canonical structure has deep implications for numerical algorithms and fundamental physics.

 - **Abstract**
 Advancements in analyses of caustic crossing events in gravitationally microlensed quasars and supernovae can benefit from numerical simulations which locate the caustics in conjunction with the creation of magnification maps. We present a GPU code which efficiently solves this problem; the code is available at this https URL. We discuss how the locations of the microcaustics can be used to determine the number of caustic crossings and the distances to caustics, both of which can be used to constrain the space of nuisance parameters such as source position and velocity within magnification maps.

 - **Abstract**
 The local X-ray AGN population appears to follow a growth cycle regulated by the AGN's own radiation, marked by changes in their obscuration and Eddington ratio during accretion events. Because AGN in infrared-selected galaxies are more likely to be Compton-thick and have evidence for over-massive black holes, we explore whether infrared-selected AGN follow the radiation-regulated AGN growth scheme. We calculate the Eddington ratios of nine U/LIRG AGN with dynamical BH mass measurements, finding that though the number of objects is limited, AGN in IR-selected galaxies appear consistent with radiation pressure-regulated growth. We suggest that enlarging the sample of dynamical BH mass measurements in IR-selected systems will provide more stringent tests of whether their AGN are primarily regulated by radiation pressure.

 - **Abstract**
 The detection and characterization of the 21cm signal from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) demands extraordinary precision in radio interferometric observations and analysis. For modern low-frequency arrays, achieving the dynamic range necessary to detect this signal requires simulation frameworks to validate analysis techniques and characterize systematic effects. However, the computational expense of direct visibility calculations grows rapidly with sky model complexity and array size, posing a potential bottleneck for scalable forward modeling. In this paper, we present fftvis, a high-performance visibility simulator built on the Flatiron Non-Uniform Fast-Fourier Transform (finufft) algorithm. We show that fftvis matches the well-validated matvis simulator to near numerical precision while delivering substantial runtime reductions, up to two orders of magnitude for dense, many-element arrays. We provide a detailed description of the fftvis algorithm and benchmark its computational performance, memory footprint, and numerical accuracy against matvis, including a validation study against analytic solutions for diffuse sky models. We further assess the utility of fftvis in validating 21cm analysis pipelines through a study of the dynamic range in simulated delay and fringe-rate spectra. Our results establish fftvis as a fast, precise, and scalable simulation tool for 21cm cosmology experiments, enabling end-to-end validation of analysis pipelines.

 - **Abstract**
 Sorcha is a solar system survey simulator built for the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) and future large-scale wide-field surveys. Over the ten-year survey, the LSST is expected to collect roughly a billion observations of minor planets. The task of a solar system survey simulator is to take a set of input objects (described by orbits and physical properties) and determine what a real or hypothetical survey would have discovered. Existing survey simulators have a computational bottleneck in determining which input objects lie in each survey field, making them infeasible for LSST data scales. Sorcha can swiftly, efficiently, and accurately calculate the on-sky positions for sets of millions of input orbits and surveys with millions of visits, identifying which exposures these objects cross, in order for later stages of the software to make detailed estimates of the apparent magnitude and detectability of those input small bodies. In this paper, we provide the full details of the algorithm and software behind Sorcha's ephemeris generator. Like many of Sorcha's components, its ephemeris generator can be easily used for other surveys.
#### Turbulent drag on stellar mass black holes embedded in AGN discs

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.02173

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate how AGN disk turbulence affects the orbital dynamics of a stellar-mass black hole (BH) initially located at a migration trap, focusing on the long-term behavior of eccentricity and inclination in the quasi-embedded regime. We develop a semi-analytical framework in which turbulence is modeled as a stochastic velocity field acting through a modified drag force. We integrate the resulting stochastic differential equations both in Cartesian coordinates and in orbital elements using a linearized perturbative approach, and compare these results with full numerical simulations. Eccentricity and inclination evolve toward steady-state Rayleigh distributions, with variances determined by the local disk properties and the ratio of the gas damping rate to the orbital frequency. The analytical predictions agree well with the numerical simulations. We provide closed-form expressions for the variances in both the fast and slow damping regimes. These results are directly applicable to Monte Carlo population models and can serve as physically motivated initial conditions for hydrodynamical simulations. Turbulent forcing prevents full circularization and alignment of BH orbits in AGN disks, even in the presence of strong gas drag. This has important implications for BH merger and binary formation rates, which are sensitive to the residual eccentricity and inclination. Our results highlight the need to account for turbulence-induced stochastic heating when modeling the dynamical evolution of compact objects in AGN environments.
#### Long-Term Optical Follow Up of S231206cc: Multi-Model Constraints on BBH Merger Emission in AGN Disks

 - **Abstract**
 The majority of gravitational wave events detected by the LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA Collaboration originate from binary black hole (BBH) mergers, for which no confirmed electromagnetic counterparts have been identified to date. However, if such mergers occur within the disk of an active galactic nucleus (AGN), they may generate observable optical flares induced by relativistic jet activity and shock-heated gas. We present results from a long-term optical follow-up of the gravitational wave event S231206cc, conducted with the T80-South telescope as part of the S-PLUS Transient Extension Program (STEP). Our search prioritized AGN-hosted environments by crossmatching the gravitational wave localization with known AGN catalogs. No candidate met the criteria for a viable optical counterpart. We explored three BBH merger scenarios predicting optical emission in AGN disks: (i) ram pressure stripping, (ii) long-term emission from an emerging jet cocoon, and (iii) jet breakout followed by shock cooling. Using our observational cadence and depth, we constrained the BBH parameter space, including the remnant's location within the AGN disk, kick velocity, and supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass. Detectable flares are most likely when mergers occur at 0.01-0.1 parsecs from SMBHs with masses between 10^7 and 10^8 solar masses, where short delay times and long durations best align with our follow-up strategy. These results provide a framework for identifying AGN-hosted BBH counterparts and guiding future multimessenger efforts.
#### Seeking Spinning Subpopulations of Black Hole Binaries via Iterative Density Estimation

 - **Abstract**
 Attempts to understand the formation of binary black hole (BBH) systems detected via gravitational wave (GW) emission are affected by many unknowns and uncertainties, from both the observational and theoretical (astrophysical modelling) sides. Binary component spins have been proposed as a means to investigate formation channels, however obtaining clear inferences is challenging, given the apparently low magnitude of almost all merging BH spins and their high measurement uncertainties. Even for the effective aligned spin $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$ which is more precisely measured than component spins, specific model assumptions have been required to identify any clear trends. Here, we reconstruct the joint component mass and $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$ distribution of BBH mergers with minimal assumptions using the GWTC-3 catalog, using an iterative kernel density estimation (KDE)-based method. We reproduce some features seen in previous analyses, for instance a small but preferentially positive $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$ for low-mass mergers; we also identify a possible subpopulation of higher-spin BBH with $|\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}|$ up to $\sim\! 0.75$ for primary masses $m_1 \gtrsim 40\,M_\odot$, in addition to the bulk of the distribution with $|\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}| \lesssim 0.2$. This finding is consistent with previous studies indicating a broader spin distribution at high mass, suggesting a distinct origin for the high-spin systems. We also identify a previously-unnoticed trend at lower masses: the population mean of $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$ increases (decreases) with $m_1$ ($m_2$) \emph{within} the overdensity around $m_1 \sim 10 M_\odot$. This ``spin fine structure'' may partly explain a previously reported anticorrelation between mass ratio and $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$.
#### A Parameter Survey of Neutron Star Accretion Column Simulations

 - **Abstract**
 We conduct a parameter survey of neutron star accretion column simulations by solving the relativistic radiation MHD equations with opacities that account for strong magnetic fields and pair production. We study how column properties depend on accretion rate, magnetic field strength, and accretion flow geometry. All the simulated accretion columns exhibit kHz oscillatory behavior, consistent with our previous findings. We show how the predicted oscillation properties depend on the column parameters. At higher accretion rates for fixed magnetic field, the column height increases, reducing the local field strength and leading to an anti-correlation between the observed cyclotron line energy and luminosity. We estimate the line energy from the simulations and find agreement with the observed trend. Downward scattering in the free-fall zone plays a key role in shaping sideways emission properties and column height. Strong downward scattering not only re-injects heat back into the column, increasing its height, but also compresses sideways emission, potentially smearing out shock oscillation signals. When the pair-production regime is reached at the base of the column, the system quickly readjusts to a force balance between gravity and radiative support. The high opacity in the pair-production region raises the radiation energy density, enhancing sideways emission through a large horizontal gradient. This shifts the sideways fan-beam radiation toward lower altitudes. In a hollow column geometry, both pencil- and fan-beam radiation emission occurs. Self-illumination across the hollow region increases the height and stabilizes the inner wall of the column, while shock oscillations persist in the outer regions.
#### Radiation GRMHD Models of Accretion onto Stellar-Mass Black Holes: I. Survey of Eddington Ratios

 - **Abstract**
 We summarize results from a survey of radiation-dominated black hole accretion flows across a wide range of mass accretion rates, as well as two values of black hole spin and initial magnetic field geometry. These models apply an algorithm targeting direct solutions to the radiation transport equation in full general relativity and have been enabled by access to modern exascale computing systems. Super-Eddington accretion flows form geometrically thick radiation pressure supported disks that drive powerful equatorial outflows. A narrow funnel-shaped photosphere in the inner region results in very low radiative efficiencies in this regime. The structure of near- and sub-Eddington accretion depends on whether there is net vertical magnetic flux at the midplane of the disk. With net flux, the disk forms a thin, dense layer at the midplane surrounded by a magnetically-dominated corona, whereas without net flux the disk remains magnetically dominated everywhere. Although none of our models achieve the magnetically arrested disk (MAD) regime, those with net vertical flux and a rapidly spinning black hole still produce powerful relativistic jets. Our calculations adopt simple opacity models (with scalings appropriate to stellar-mass black hole accretion). We discuss the application of our results to observations of X-ray binaries and ultraluminous X-ray sources such as Cyg X-3 and SS433. We also speculate on the application of our super-Eddington models to the interpretation of little red dots (LRDs) recently discovered by JWST.
#### A Wide Field Map of Ultra-Compact Dwarfs in the Coma Cluster

 - **Abstract**
 A dataset of 23,351 globular clusters (GCs) and ultra-compact dwarfs (UCDs) in the Coma cluster of galaxies was built using Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys data. Based on the standard magnitude cut of $M_V \leq -11$, a total of 523 UCD candidates are found within this dataset of Compact Stellar Systems (CSS). From a color-magnitude diagram (CMD) analysis built using this catalog, we find a clear mass-magnitude relation extending marginally into the UCD parameter space. The luminosity function defined by this dataset, shows an excess of sources at bright magnitudes, suggesting a bimodal formation scenario for UCDs. We estimate the number of UCDs with a different origin than GC to be $N_{UCD} \geq 32 \pm 1$. We derive the total number of CSS within the core (1 Mpc) of Coma to be $N_{CSS} \approx 69,400 \pm 1400$. The radial distribution of UCDs in Coma shows that, like GCs, UCDs agglomerate around three giant ellipticals: NGC 4874, NGC 4889, and IC 4051. We find UCDs are more centrally concentrated around these three ellipticals than GCs. IC 4051 has a satellite population of UCDs similar to NGC 4874 and NGC 4889. We estimate only ~14% of UCDs, inhabit the intracluster space (ICUCD) between galaxies in the region, in comparison to ~24% for GCs (ICGC). We find red (metal-rich) UCDs are more likely located closer to a host galaxy, with blue (metal-poor) UCDs showing a greater dispersion and lower average density in the region.
#### Alkali phenoxides in comets

 - **Abstract**
 Potassium was first detected in spectra of the sungrazer comet Ikeya-Seki at the heliocentric distance rh = 0.15 au and, 48 years later, in comets PanSTARRS and ISON at rh = 0.46 au. The alkali tail photoionization model provides a Na/K ratio close to the solar value. No lithium was detected in any comet: the lower limit of the Na/Li ratio was almost one order of magnitude greater than the solar ratio. Here we searched for the emissions of the alkali NaI, KI, and LiI in Comets C/2020 F3 and C/2024 G3. High-resolution spectra of the comets were taken with the 0.84 m telescope at the Schiaparelli Observatory at rh = 0.36 and 0.15 au, the observations closest to the Sun since Ikeya-Seki. To model the data, we assumed that alkali phenoxides are present in the aromatic fraction of organic dust at the nucleus surface where they react with carbon dioxide ejecting alkali atoms. NaI and KI were detected in emission lines of exceptional intensity in both comets, with no evidence of LiI emission. The NaI/KI ratios were determined: 31 +/- 5 and 26 +/- 8, whereas solar Na/K = 15. This excess and its observed trend with the heliocentric distance are consistent with chemistry between CO2 and alkali phenoxides at the nucleus surface. The Li upper limit for comet C/2020 F3 is very stringent at Na/Li > 3.4 10^4, a factor of 34 greater than the solar value. This Li depletion is consistent with the reaction rate of lithium phenoxides, which is a factor of 10^4 slower than sodium phenoxides. The widespread chemistry of carbon dioxide with organic dust may provide a significant energy and mass sink of carbon dioxide in all comets also at rh > 1 au, reconciling recent models of cometary activity with Rosetta CO2 measurements. At rh < 0.5 au potassium was observed in all comets, so that we predict the formation of a KI tail spatially resolved from the NaI tail.
#### Long-Term Astrometric Monitoring of the Galactic Center Magnetar PSR J1745--2900

 - **Abstract**
 We present new astrometric observations of the Galactic Center magnetar, PSR J1745-2900, with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA). Combined with previously published measurements in 10 epochs that spanned 477 days, the complete data set consists of 25 epochs and 41 independent measurements that span 1984 days. These data constrain the proper motion to an accuracy of $\lesssim 2\%$ and set an upper limit on the absolute value of the magnetar's acceleration of $\lesssim (0.4, 0.2)\, {\rm mas\,y^{-2}}$ in the two celestial coordinates, consistent with the maximum value of $\sim 0.03\,{\rm mas\,y^{-2}}$ expected for an orbit around Sgr A*. Future measurements have the potential to detect the acceleration of PSR J1745-2900 due to Sgr A* should PSR J1745-2900 re-brighten. We consider several potential sources of systematic variations in the astrometric residuals after fitting for standard parameters, including refractive wander, changes in the structure of Sgr A*, and the presence of an unseen binary companion. While a stellar companion model can be fit to the astrometric data, pulse period measurements are inconsistent with that model. No changes in the apparent image size of the magnetar were detected over the duration of these observations, indicating a lack of change in the properties of the line-of-sight scattering during this period. We also show that the upper limit to the mean core shift of Sgr A* is consistent with expectations for a compact jet or symmetric accretion flow.
#### Insight into the origin of multiwavelength emissions of PKS 1510-089 through modeling 12 SEDs from 2008 to 2015

 - **Abstract**
 PKS\,1510$-$089 is one of the most peculiar sources among the FSRQs, exhibiting a notable big blue bump (BBB). This provides an unique opportunity to explore the coupling between the activity of the central engine and the relativistic jet, offering further insight into the origin of the multiwavelength emissions. To this end, we collected multiwavelength data spanning four periods from 2008 to 2015 and performed the spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling using a one-zone homogeneous leptonic model. In the model, a multichromatic accretion disk (AD) is used to fit the optical/UV data sets, while the external radiation fields from the broad-line region (BLR) and dusty torus (DT) are properly considered to produce the high-energy $\gamma$-ray emissions. Our best fit to 12 SEDs yields the following results: (i) The innermost stable orbit ($R_{\rm ISO}$) of the AD is not stable but varies between $3\,R_{\rm S}$ and $18\,R_{\rm S}$ during these observations. (ii) The high-energy hump of the SED is well dominated by Compton scattering of the BLR photons, while the X-ray flux may be comprised of multiple radiation components. (iii) The $\gamma$-ray emitting regions are generally matter-dominated, with low magnetization, and are located beyond the BLR but within the DT. At such distance, the multiwavelength emissions are likely to originate from shock accelerations; (iv) For the energization of the relativistic jet, our study supports the Blandford$-$Znajek (BZ) mechanism, instead of the Blandford$-$Payne (BP) mechanism, as the latter fails to power the jet.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetograms acquired with the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) were used to calculate and analyze time variations of turbulence and multifractality in the photosphere during the development and flaring of a mature active region NOAA 13354 during its passage across the solar disk. Turbulence was explored with 2D magnetic power spectra from magnetograms, and multifractality was analyzed using the structure functions of magnetograms. Time variations of the magnetic power spectrum exponent $\alpha$ and of the multifractalty exponent $\kappa$ demonstrate no pre-flare or post-flare abrupt peculiarities, instead, long periods of stability with smooth transitions into other conditions were observed. A conclusion was inferred that the turbulence and multifractality time path in the photospheric magnetic field does not follow the timing of single flares, however, it tends to correspond to the levels of the magneto-morphological complexity and flaring productivity of an AR. So, in the sense of self-organized criticality (SOC), the photosphere, being in the state of self-organization, evolves independently from the highly intermittent, SOC-state corona.

 - **Abstract**
 This technical note describes the design and modular implementation of a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN) adapted from residual networks (ResNet), developed for photometric regression tasks with an emphasis on low star formation rate surface density ($\Sigma_{\mathrm{SFR}}$) inference. The model features residual block structures optimized for sparse targets, with optional loss weighting and diagnostic tools for analyzing residual behavior. The implementation (version \texttt{v1.4}) originated during a collaborative project and is documented here independently. No external data are reproduced or analyzed. This note provides a reusable architectural reference for scalar regression problems in astronomy and related domains.

 - **Abstract**
 The Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will start by the end of 2025 and operate for ten years, offering billions of observations of the southern night sky. One of its main science goals is to create an inventory of the Solar System, allowing for a more detailed understanding of small body populations including the Centaurs, which will benefit from the survey's high cadence and depth. In this paper, we establish the first discovery limits for Centaurs throughout the LSST's decade-long operation using the best available dynamical models. Using the survey simulator $\texttt{Sorcha}$, we predict a $\sim$7-12 fold increase in Centaurs in the Minor Planet Center (MPC) database, reaching $\sim$1200-2000 (dependent on definition) by the end of the survey - about 50$\%$ of which are expected within the first 2 years. Approximately 30-50 Centaurs will be observed twice as frequently as they fall within one of the LSST's Deep Drilling Fields (DDF) for on average only up to two months. Outside of the DDFs, Centaurs will receive $\sim$200 observations across the $\textit{ugrizy}$ filter range, facilitating searches for cometary-like activity through PSF extension analysis, as well as fitting light-curves and phase curves for color determination. Regardless of definition, over 200 Centaurs will achieve high-quality color measurements across at least three filters in the LSST's six filters. These observations will also provide over 300 well-defined phase curves in the $\textit{griz}$ bands, improving absolute magnitude measurements to a precision of 0.2 mags.

 - **Abstract**
 Hypothetical axion-like particles (ALPs) are of interest because of their potential to act as dark matter or to reveal information about yet undiscovered fundamental constituents of matter. Such particles can be created when photons traverse regions of magnetic fields. The conversion probability depends on both the magnetic field parameters and photon energy, leading to multiple spectral absorption features as light passes through magnetized regions. Traditionally, astrophysical searches have focused on detecting such features in individual objects. However, the limited understanding of properties of cosmic magnetic fields have hindered the progress. Here we introduce a new approach by analyzing stacked (rather than individual) spectra of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) positioned behind galaxy clusters -- gigantic magnetic field reservoirs. Stacking efficiently averages over the uncertainties in magnetic fields, revealing a unique step-like spectral signature of photon-to-ALP conversion. With this approach we advance into previously inaccessible regions of the ALP parameter space for nano-electronvolt masses. Adopting this method will significantly improve existing bounds across a wide range of masses by using different telescopes and increasing the size of the stacked datasets. The Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory, in particular, will extensively probe the parameter space where ALPs could serve as dark matter.

 - **Abstract**
 Exoplanetary and planetary environments are forced by stellar activity which manifest through variable radiation, particle and magnetic fluxes, stellar winds, flares and magnetic storms known as coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Recent studies have shown that (exo)planets with intrinsic magnetic fields and magnetospheres respond differently to this stellar forcing compared to planets which lack an intrinsic magnetism; this is borne out by observations in solar system planets. However, detailed investigations to uncover the subtle ways in which stellar magnetic storms impact exoplanets are still at a nascent stage. Here we utilize 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations to investigate the impact of stellar CMEs on Earth-like planets with different magnetic fields. Our results show that planetary atmospheric mass loss rates are dependent on the relative orientation of stellar wind and planetary magnetic fields, with significantly higher losses when the CME and planetary magnetic fields are oppositely oriented -- favoring enhanced magnetic reconnections. In contrast, for unmagnetised planets, the mass loss rate do not strongly depend on stellar magnetic field orientation. More significantly, we find that stellar CME induced polarity reversals can distinguish between planets with and without intrinsic magnetism. In unmagnetised or weakly magnetised (exo)planets, the polarity of the externally imposed magnetosphere are prone to global polarity reversals forced by stellar magnetised storms. Our analysis of the magnetotail current density dynamics during polarity reversals aligns with observations of Venus. This distinction in magnetospheric response provides a new paradigm to differentiate between (exo)planets with or without significant (intrinsic) magnetic fields.

 - **Abstract**
 Imaging terrestrial exoplanets around nearby stars is a formidable technical challenge, requiring the development of coronagraphs to suppress the stellar halo of diffracted light at the location of the planet. In this review, we derive the science requirement for high-contrast imaging, present an overview of diffraction theory and the Lyot coronagraph, and define the parameters used in our optimization. We detail the working principles of coronagraphs both in the laboratory and on-sky with current high-contrast instruments, and we describe the required algorithms and processes necessary for terrestrial planet imaging with the extremely large telescopes and proposed space telescope missions: * Imaging terrestrial planets around nearby stars is possible with a combination of coronagraphs and active wavefront control using feedback from wavefront sensors. * Ground based 8-40m class telescopes can target the habitable zone around nearby M dwarf stars with contrasts of $10^{-7}$ and space telescopes can search around solar-type stars with contrasts of $10^{-10}$. * Focal plane wavefront sensing, hybrid coronagraph designs and multiple closed loops providing active correction are required to reach the highest sensitivities. * Polarization effects need to be mitigated for reaching $10^{-10}$ contrasts whilst keeping exoplanet yields as high as possible. * Recent technological developments, including photonics and microwave kinetic inductance detectors, will be folded into high-contrast instruments.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we present a detailed analysis of a potential asteroid candidate, ISP0010, using images provided by the Pan-STARRS 1 telescope as part of our participation in the International Astronomical Search Collaboration campaign. IASC is one of the leading contributors to the detection of various Near-Earth Objects and Main Belt asteroids. Using Astrometrica software we analysed those images and extracted their key parameters such as signal-to-noise ratio, right ascension, declination, flux, FWHM, RMS, and magnitude. Later, we analysed its trajectory, apparent angular speed, and error analyses using python and its libraries. In the end, we concluded that ISP0010 would be a potential candidate for an asteroid. However, on cross-verifying with the Minor Planet Centre database, we found that ISP0010 was already reported on February 27, 2021, and a total of 25 observations has been reported up to the date and currently the object has been designated as 2021 CP66. Our date of observation of 2021 CP66 was February 27, 2025. This study thus provides an independent confirmation and characterization of 2021 CP66, demonstrating the accuracy of our analysis and underscoring the importance of thorough database verification in asteroid detection.

 - **Abstract**
 Changing-look AGNs (CLAGN) are accreting supermassive black hole systems that undergo variations in optical spectral type, driven by major changes in accretion rate. Mrk 1018 has undergone two transitions, a brightening event in the 1980s and a transition back to a faint state over the course of 2-3 years in the early 2010s. We characterize the evolving physical properties of the source's inner accretion flow, particularly during the bright-to-faint transition, as well as the morphological properties of its parsec-scale circumnuclear gas. We model archival X-ray spectra from XMM-Newton, Chandra, Suzaku, and Swift, using physically-motivated models to characterize X-ray spectral variations and track Fe Kalpha line flux. We also quantify Mrk 1018's long-term multi-wavelength spectral variability from optical/UV to the X-rays. Over the duration of the bright-to-faint transition, the UV and hard X-ray flux fell by differing factors, roughly 24 and 8, respectively. The soft X-ray excess faded, and was not detected by 2021. In the faint state, when the Eddington ratio drops to log Lbol/LEdd < -1.7, the hot X-ray corona photon index shows a 'softer-when-fainter' trend, similar to that seen in some black hole X-ray binaries and samples of low-luminosity AGNs. Finally, the Fe Kalpha line flux has dropped by only half the factor of the drop in the X-ray continuum. The transition from the bright state to the faint state is consistent with the inner accretion flow transitioning from a geometrically-thin disk to an ADAF-dominated state, with the warm corona disintegrating or becoming energetically negligible, while the X-ray-emitting hot flow becoming energetically dominant. Meanwhile, narrow Fe Kalpha emission has not yet fully responded to the drop in its driving continuum, likely because its emitter extends up to roughly 10 pc.
#### Thin coronal jets and plasmoid-mediated reconnection: Insights from Solar Orbiter observations and Bifrost simulations

 - **Abstract**
 Coronal jets are ubiquitous, collimated million-degree ejections that contribute to the energy and mass supply of the upper solar atmosphere and the solar wind. Solar Orbiter provides an unprecedented opportunity to observe fine-scale jets from a unique vantage point close to the Sun. We aim to (1) uncover thin jets originating from Coronal Bright Points (CBPs), revealing previously unresolved contributions to coronal upflows; and (2) improve our understanding of plasmoid-mediated reconnection and its observable signatures. We analyze eleven datasets from the High Resolution Imager 174 Å of the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (HRIEUV) onboard Solar Orbiter, focusing on narrow jets from CBPs and signatures of magnetic reconnection within current sheets and outflow regions. To support the observations, we compare with CBP simulations performed with the Bifrost code. We have identified thin coronal jets originating from CBPs with widths ranging from 253 km to 706 km: scales that could not be resolved with previous EUV imaging instruments. Remarkably, these jets are 30-85% brighter than their surroundings and can extend up to 22 Mm while maintaining their narrow form. In one of the datasets, we directly identify plasmoid-mediated reconnection through the development within the current sheet of a small-scale plasmoid that reaches a size of 332 km and propagates at 40 km/s. In another dataset, we infer plasmoid signatures through the intermittent boomerang-like pattern that appears in the outflow region. Both direct and indirect plasmoid-mediated reconnection signatures are supported by comparisons with the synthetic HRIEUV emission from the simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 We present AGNBoost, a machine learning framework utilizing XGBoostLSS to identify AGN and estimate redshifts from JWST NIRCam and MIRI photometry. AGNBoost constructs 121 input features from 7 NIRCam and 4 MIRI bands-including magnitudes, colors, and squared color terms-to simultaneously predict the fraction of mid-IR $3-30\,\mu$m emission attributable to an AGN power law (frac$_\text{AGN}$) and photometric redshift. Each model is trained on a sample of $10^6$ simulated galaxies from CIGALE providing ground truth values of both frac$_\text{AGN}$ and redshift. Models are tested against both mock CIGALE galaxies set aside for testing and 698 observations from the JWST MIRI EGS Galaxy and AGN (MEGA) survey. On mock galaxies, AGNBoost achieves $15\%$ outlier fractions of $0.19\%$ (frac$_\text{AGN}$) and $0.63\%$ (redshift), with a root mean square error ($\sigma_\text{RMSE}$) of $0.027$ for frac$_\text{AGN}$ and a normalized mean absolute deviation ($\sigma_\text{NMAD}$) of 0.011 for redshift. On MEGA galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts, AGNBoost achieves $\sigma_\text{NMAD}$ = 0.074 and $17.05\%$ outliers, with most outliers at $z_\text{spec} > 2$. AGNBoost frac$_\text{AGN}$ estimates broadly agree with CIGALE fitting ($\sigma_\text{RMSE} = 0.183$, $20.41\%$ outliers), and AGNBoost finds a similar number of AGNs as CIGALE SED fitting. The flexible framework of AGNBoost allows straightforward incorporation of additional photometric bands and derived qualities, and simple re-training for other variables of interest. AGNBoost's computational efficiency makes it well-suited for wide-sky surveys requiring rapid AGN identification and redshift estimation.
