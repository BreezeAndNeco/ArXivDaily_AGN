 - **Abstract**
 We present the third phase of the largest high-frequency, high-resolution imaging survey of 231 nearby, hard X-ray selected AGN, with a very high $98 \pm 1\%$ detection fraction. This survey presents VLA 22 GHz radio observations with 1" spatial resolution covering over $6$ orders of magnitude in radio luminosity in nearby AGN that span $\sim4$ orders of magnitude in black hole mass and X-ray luminosity. We identify three different radio morphologies: $44 \pm 3\%$ (102/231) are compact or unresolved, $46 \pm 3\%$ (106/231) show an extended structure (star formation, possible one-sided jets, etc.), and $8 \pm 2\%$ (19/231) have a biconical or two-sided jet-like morphology. The remaining $2 \pm 1\%$ (4/231) sources are non-detections. The radio-to-X-ray luminosity ratios of the Swift-BAT AGN ($\text{L}_R/\text{L}_{14-195 \text{keV}} \sim 10^{-5.5}$ and $\text{L}_R/\text{L}_{2-10 \text{keV}} \sim 10^{-5}$) with a scatter of $\sim0.5$ dex are similar to that of coronally active stars ($\text{L}_R/\text{L}_X \sim 10^{-5}$). For most targets, extended emission in radio-quiet objects is broadly consistent with the expectation for star formation from previous FIR observations, once the contribution from the radio core has been subtracted. Our sample represents nearby analogs of distant AGN at the peak of black hole growth, and thus the high detection fraction in our work has important implications for future high frequency AGN radio surveys with the next generation VLA (ngVLA) or Square Kilometre Array (SKA), both of which should detect large fractions of more distant AGN.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Tidal tails of open clusters are the result of stellar evaporation from the cluster through the Galactic potential and internal dynamics. With the recent availability of high-precision data, tidal tails are being detected for most of the nearby open clusters. Aims: We identify the tidal tail members for all open clusters within a distance of 400 pc that are older than 100 Myr and have $>$100 members. To do this, we use model-independent methods. Methods: We used the convergent-point (CP) method to identify the co-moving stars near the open clusters using Gaia DR3 data. A new method called the self-compact convergent-point (SCCP) method was proposed and applied to some of the clusters. It performed better overall in tracing the tails. We also analysed the colour-magnitude diagrams and orbital energy to diagnose possible contamination. Results: Nineteen out of 21 clusters have tidal tails. Five of them were discovered for the first time through this work. The typical span of the tidal tails is 20--200 pc, and 30--700 member stars lie in the region inside the tidal radius and the tidal tails. Four out of 19 tidal tails are tilted away from direction of the Galactic centre. This contradicts the known theory of the tidal-tail formation. The luminosity functions of the tails and clusters are consistent with each other and with the canonical stellar interstellar mass function, but systematically higher radial velocities for the trailing tail than for the leading tail were observed for the first time. Conclusions: The CP method is useful for detecting tidal tails on a scale of approx. 100 pc for clusters closer than 400 pc. A further analysis of theoretical N-body models is required to understand the incompleteness and biases in the current sample of tidal tails.
#### The assembly of supermassive black holes at $z<1$ in early-type galaxies from scaling relations

 - **Abstract**
 The assembly of supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass ($M_{\bullet}$) and stellar mass ($M_{*}$) in galaxies can be studied via the redshift evolution of the $M_{\bullet}-M_{*}$ relation, but the ways in which selection bias and physical assembly channels affect this evolution are uncertain. To address this, we compare the $M_{\bullet}-M_{*}$ relation for local massive ($M_{*}>10^{10.5}$M$_{\odot}$) quiescent early-type galaxies (ETGs) to that for massive ETGs hosting active galactic nuclei (AGN) at $z\sim0.8$. The restrictions on stellar mass and galaxy type limit the assembly channels that may connect the two relations. For the local sample we find $\log(M_{\bullet}) = 8.80 + 1.10(\log{M_{*}-11})$, in line with prior work. For the $z\sim0.8$ sample we find a bias-corrected relation: $\log(M_{\bullet}) = 7.80 + 1.25(\log{M_{*}-11})$. We show, however, that this relation depends on the stellar and SMBH mass functions used to compute the selection bias, the virial relation, the virial factor, and the active fraction, which together introduce uncertainty of up to $\sim0.6$\,dex in the $z\sim0.8$ relation. Adopting reasonable choices of these parameters then our $z\sim0.8$ relation lies above that for $z\sim0$ AGN by $\sim0.5$\,dex, but below our $z\sim0$ ETG relation by $0.4-1$\,dex in SMBH mass. We discuss possible sources of this offset, including further bias corrections, `downsizing" in SMBH mass assembly, and preferential SMBH growth. Our results highlight the need to reduce uncertainties from selection and measurement bias in SMBH and stellar masses at all redshifts.
#### Joint inference of the Milky Way star formation history and IMF from Gaia all-sky $G < 13$ data

 - **Abstract**
 Despite the fundamental importance of the star formation history (SFH) and the initial mass function (IMF) in the description of the Milky Way, their consistent and robust derivation is still elusive. Recent and accurate astrometry and photometry collected by the Gaia satellite provide the natural framework to consolidate these ingredients in our local Galactic environment. We aim to simultaneously infer the IMF and the SFH of the Galactic disc comparing Gaia data with the mock catalog resulting from the Besançon population synthesis model (BGM). Our goal is also to estimate the impact of the systematics present in current stellar evolutionary models on this inference. We use a new implementation of the BGM Fast Approximate Simulations (BGM FASt) framework to fit the seven million star Gaia DR3 all-sky $G<13$ color-magnitude diagram (CMD) to the most updated dynamically self-consistent BGM. Our derived SFH supports an abrupt decrease of the star formation approximately 1-1.5 Gyr ago followed by a significant enhancement with a wide plateau in the range 2-6 Gyr ago. A remarkable hiatus appears around 5-7 Gyr ago with a $\sim$1 Gyr shift depending on the set of stellar models. A complex and discrepant evolution at ages older than 8 Gyr deserves further investigation. Precise but discrepant values are found for the power-law indices of the IMF. For the range 0.5-1.53 $M_\odot$ the slope takes a value of $\alpha_2 = 1.45^{+0.19}_{-0.12}$, while for masses larger than 1.53 $M_\odot$ we obtain $\alpha_3 = 1.98^{+0.13}_{-0.05}$. The current implementation of the BGM FASt framework is ready to address executions fitting all-sky Gaia data up to 14-17 apparent limiting magnitude. This will naturally allow us to derive both a reliable SFH for the early epochs of the Galactic disc evolution and a precise slope for the IMF at low masses.
#### The First SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey. Characterization of clusters of galaxies misclassified in the eRASS1 point source catalog

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of the extended X-ray-emission of the intracluster medium by the first SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey (eRASS1), combined with optical and near-infrared follow-up, resulted in the identification of more than 12000 galaxy clusters, yielding precise constraints on cosmological parameters. However, some clusters of galaxies can be misclassified as point sources by eROSITA's source detection algorithm due to the interplay between the point-spread function, the shallow depth of the survey, compact (cool core) X-ray emission, and bright active galactic nuclei hosted in their centers or their vicinity. To identify such misclassified galaxy clusters and groups, we apply optical follow-up to the eRASS1 X-ray point sources analogously to the treatment of the extent-selected catalog. After rigorous filtering to ensure purity, we find a total of 8347 clusters of galaxies, of which 5819 are novel detections, in a redshift range $0.05 < z \lesssim 1.1$. This corresponds to a 70 % discovery rate, a fraction similar to that of the extent-selected sample. To facilitate finding new exceptional clusters such as the Phoenix cluster (which is recovered in our sample), we divide the clusters into five classes based on the optical properties of likely single-source counterparts to the X-ray emission. We further investigate potential biases in our selection process by analyzing the optical and X-ray data. With this work, we provide a catalog of galaxy clusters and groups in the eRASS1 point source catalog, including their optical and X-ray properties along with a meaningful classification.
#### The impact of cosmic ray feedback during the epoch of reionisation

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxies form and evolve via a multitude of complex physics. In this work, we investigate the role of cosmic ray (CR) feedback in galaxy evolution and reionisation, by examining its impact on the escape of ionising radiation from galaxies. For this purpose, we present two Sphinx cosmological radiation-magneto-hydrodynamics simulations, allowing for the first time a study of the impact of CR feedback on thousands of resolved galaxies during the Epoch of Reionisation (EoR). The simulations differ in their feedback prescriptions: one adopts a calibrated strong supernova (SN) feedback, while the other simulation reduces the strength of SN feedback and includes CR feedback instead. We show that both comparably regulate star formation, reasonably match observations of high-redshift UV luminosity functions, and produce a similar amount of hydrogen ionising photons. In contrast to the model with strong SN feedback, the model with CRs lead to incomplete reionisation, which is in strong disagreement with observational estimates of the reionisation history. This is due to CR feedback shaping the ISM differently, filling with gas the low density cavities otherwise carved by SN explosions. As a result, this reduces the escape of ionising photons, at any halo mass, and primarily in the close vicinity of the stars. Our study indicates that CR feedback regulates galaxy growth during the EoR, but negatively affects reionisation, a tension which paves the way for further exploration and refinement of existing galaxy formation and feedback models. Such improvements are crucial in order to capture and understand the process of reionisation and the underlying evolution of galaxies through cosmic time.

 - **Abstract**
 Short-period planets provide ideal laboratories for testing star-planet interaction. Planets that are smaller than $\sim$2$R_\oplus$ are considered to be largely rocky either having been stripped of or never having acquired the gaseous envelope. Zooming in on these short-period rocky planet population, clear edges appear in the mass-period and radius-period space. Over $\sim$0.2--20 days and 0.09--1.42$M_\odot$, the maximum mass of the rocky planets stay below $\sim$10$M_\oplus$ with a hint of decrease towards $\lesssim$1 day, $\gtrsim$4 day, and $\lesssim 0.45 M_\odot$. In radius-period space, there is a relative deficit of $\lesssim$2$R_\oplus$ planets inside $\sim$1 day. We demonstrate how the edges in the mass-period space can be explained by a combination of tidal decay and photoevaporation whereas the rocky planet desert in the radius-period space is a signature of magnetic drag on the planet as it orbits within the stellar magnetic field. Currently observed catastrophically evaporating planets may have started their death spiral from $\sim$1 day with planets of mass up to $\sim$0.3$M_\oplus$ under the magnetic drag. More discoveries and characterization of small planets around mid-late M and A stars would be welcome to better constrain the stellar parameters critical in shaping the edges of rocky planet population including their UV radiation history, tidal and magnetic properties.
#### r-Process Nucleosynthesis and Radioactively Powered Transients from Magnetar Giant Flares

 - **Abstract**
 We present nucleosynthesis and light-curve predictions for a new site of the rapid neutron capture process ($r$-process) from magnetar giant flares (GFs). Motivated by observations indicating baryon ejecta from GFs, Cehula et al. (2024) proposed mass ejection occurs after a shock is driven into the magnetar crust during the GF. We confirm using nuclear reaction network calculations that these ejecta synthesize moderate yields of third-peak $r$-process nuclei and more substantial yields of lighter $r$-nuclei, while leaving a sizable abundance of free neutrons in the outermost fastest expanding ejecta layers. The final $r$-process mass fraction and distribution are sensitive to the relative efficiencies of $\alpha$-capture and $n$-capture freeze-outs. We use our nucleosynthesis output in a semi-analytic model to predict the light curves of novae breves, the transients following GFs powered by radioactive decay. For a baryonic ejecta mass similar to that inferred of the 2004 Galactic GF from SGR 1806-20, we predict a peak UV/optical luminosity of $\sim 10^{39}$-$10^{40}\,\rm erg\,s^{-1}$ at $\sim 10$-$15$ minutes, rendering such events potentially detectable following a gamma-ray trigger by wide-field transient monitors such as ULTRASAT/UVEX to several Mpc. The peak luminosity and timescale of the transient increase with the GF strength due to the larger ejecta mass. Although GFs likely contribute 1-10% of the total Galactic $r$-process budget, their short delay-times relative to star-formation make them an attractive source to enrich the earliest generations of stars.
#### Molecular Gas Heating, Star Formation Rate Relations, and AGN Feedback in Infrared-luminous Galaxy Mergers

 - **Abstract**
 We examine the origin of molecular gas heating in a sample of 42 infrared-luminous galaxies at $z<0.3$ by combining two sets of archival data. First, integrated CO line luminosities in the 1-0 and 5-4 through 13-12 transitions. Second, results from radiative transfer modelling that decompose their bolometric emission into starburst, AGN, and host galaxy components. We find that the CO 1-0 and 5-4 through 9-8 lines primarily arise via radiative heating in the starburst and the host galaxy. In contrast, the CO 10-9 through 13-12 lines may arise primarily in the starburst and AGN, with an increasing contribution from mechanical heating and shocks. For the sample as a whole, we find no evidence that AGN luminosity affects the heating of molecular gas by star formation. However, for starbursts with low initial optical depths, a more luminous AGN may reduce the efficiency of starburst heating of the CO 5-4 and above lines, consistent with negative AGN feedback.
#### Recovering Ion Distribution Functions: I. Slepian Reconstruction of VDFs from MMS and Solar Orbiter

 - **Abstract**
 Plasma velocity distribution functions (VDFs) constitute a fundamental observation of numerous operational and future missions. An efficient parameterization of VDFs is crucial for (1) preserving enough information to investigate macroscopic moments along with kinetic effects, (2) producing smooth distributions whereby it is possible to perform derivatives in phase space to support numerical solvers, and (3) economic data management and its storage. Previous studies have used spherical harmonics as an efficient basis for representing electron VDFs. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm targeted towards decomposing ion VDFs measured by electrostatic analyzers onboard Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission (MMS) and Solar Orbiter (SolO) spacecrafts. We use Slepian functions, custom-designed bases providing compact support in phase space, initially developed in information theory and later used for terrestrial and planetary applications. In this paper, we choose well-studied, well-measured, and complex intervals from MMS and SolO containing a range of simpler gyrotropic and agyrotropic distributions to benchmark the robustness of our reconstruction method. We demonstrate the advantages of using Slepian functions over spherical harmonics for solar wind plasma distributions. We also demonstrate that our choice of basis representation efficiently preserves phase space complexities of a 3D agyrotropic distribution function. This algorithm shown in this study will be extended to Parker Solar Probe and future missions such as Helioswarm.
#### Synthetic Remote-sensing and In-situ Observations of Fine-scale Structure in a Pseudostreamer Coronal Mass Ejection through the Solar Corona

 - **Abstract**
 Coronal pseudostreamer flux systems have a specific magnetic configuration that influences the morphology and evolution of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) from these regions. Here we continue the analysis of the Wyper et al. (2024, ApJ 975, 168) magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a CME eruption from an idealized pseudostreamer configuration through the construction of synthetic remote-sensing and in-situ observational signatures. We examine the pre-eruption and eruption signatures in extreme ultraviolet and white-light from the low corona through the extended solar atmosphere. We calculate synthetic observations corresponding to several Parker Solar Probe-like trajectories at $\sim$10$R_\odot$ to highlight the fine-scale structure of the CME eruption in synthetic WISPR imagery and the differences between the in-situ plasma and field signatures of flank and central CME-encounter trajectories. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of several aspects of our simulation results in the context of interpretation and analysis of current and future Parker Solar Probe data.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper is concerned with the spread in apparent magnitudes (or absolute magnitudes) of main-sequence stars in a star cluster. I specifically consider the effect of binary stars in broadening the main sequence. I present analytic and semi-analytic expressions for the probability density function (pdf) of the magnitude at a given photometric color, including the effects of binarity. The expressions obtained employ plausible models for the pdfs of the magnitudes of the primary and secondary stars, as well as the distribution of secondary-to-primary mass ratio. A crucial parameter is the fraction of stars in the star cluster that are binaries. The resultant formulas can be used to determine the fraction of binaries in a sample of stars taken from a star cluster, or to limit long term variations in the luminosity of solar type stars.
#### Testing Cluster Membership of Planetary Nebulae with High-Precision Proper Motions. II. HST Observations of PHR J1315-6555 in the Open Cluster AL 1 (ESO 96-SC04)

 - **Abstract**
 Planetary nebulae (PNe) shown to be members of star clusters provide information on their properties and evolutionary histories that cannot be determined for PNe in the field, in particular the initial masses of their progenitor stars. Here we investigate the bipolar PN PHR J1315-6555 (hereafter PHR J1315), which lies near the open cluster AL 1 (ESO 96-SC04) on the sky. Previous work has established that the PN and cluster have similar radial velocities and amounts of interstellar reddening, and similar distances estimated using independent methods. We have obtained new images of the PN and cluster using the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Combined with archival HST frames taken 12 years earlier, they provide high-precision proper motions (PMs) for two candidate central stars of PHR J1315. We find that the PMs of both candidates are consistent with those of cluster members, strongly confirming the PN's membership in AL 1. The candidate lying closer to the center of PHR J1315 has the color and luminosity of an early F-type dwarf, suggesting that it may be the optical primary in a close post-common-envelope binary. We used the HST data to construct a color-magnitude diagram for AL 1, which we corrected for significant foreground differential reddening. Isochrone fitting reveals that the cluster lies at a remarkably large distance of about 13 kpc, and has an age of about 1.0 Gyr. The initial mass of the progenitor of PHR J1315 was about 2.1 Msun. We suggest followup investigations that would provide tighter constraints on the object's evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Global, three-dimensional, magnetohydrodynamic simulations of Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities at the disk-magnetosphere boundary of rotating, magnetized, compact stellar objects reveal that accretion occurs in three regimes: the stable regime, the chaotic unstable regime, and the ordered unstable regime. Here we track stochastic fluctuations in the pulse period $P(t)$ and aperiodic X-ray luminosity $L(t)$ time series of 24 accretion-powered pulsars in the Small Magellanic Cloud using an unscented Kalman filter to analyze Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer data. We measure time-resolved histories of the magnetocentrifugal fastness parameter $\omega(t)$ and we connect $\omega(t)$ with the three Rayleigh-Taylor accretion regimes. The 24 objects separate into two distinct groups, with 10 accreting in the stable regime, and 14 accreting in the ordered unstable regime. None of the 24 objects except SXP 293 visit the chaotic unstable regime for sustained intervals, although several objects visit it sporadically. The Kalman filter output also reveals a positive temporal cross-correlation between $\omega(t)$ and the independently measured pulse amplitude $A(t)$, which agrees with simulation predictions regarding the pulse-forming behavior of magnetospheric funnel flows in the three accretion regimes.

 - **Abstract**
 The study of dark matter substructure through strong gravitational lensing has shown enormous promise in probing the properties of dark matter on sub-galactic scales. This approach has already been used to place strong constraints on a wide range of dark matter models including self-interacting dark matter, fuzzy dark matter and warm dark matter. A major source of degeneracy exists between suppression of low mass halos due to novel dark matter physics and the strength of tidal stripping experienced by subhalos. We study theoretical predictions for the statistical properties of subhalos in strong gravitational lenses using the semi-analytic galaxy formation toolkit: \galns. We present a large suite of dark matter only \gal models, spanning nearly two orders of magnitude in host halo mass (from Milky Way to group mass halos between redshifts from $0.2$ to $0.8$). Additionally, we include a smaller set of \gal runs with the potential of a central massive elliptical to complement our dark matter only suite of models. We place particular focus on quantities relevant to strong gravitational lensing; namely the projected number density of substructure near the Einstein radius as function of host stellar mass and redshift. In the innermost region in projection, we find that our \gal models agrees with N-body simulations within a factor of $\sim 2$ within the Einstein radius. We find that the addition of a central galaxy suppresses the projected number density of subhalos within in the Einstein radius by around $15\%$ relative to dark matter only simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 Black hole X-ray binaries (BHXBs) are observed in various wavelengths from radio to GeV gamma-ray. Several BHXBs, including MAXI J1820+070 and Cygnus X-1, are also found to emit ultrahigh-energy (UHE; photon energy $>$100 TeV) gamma rays. The origin and production mechanism of the multi-wavelength emission of BHXBs are under debate. We propose a scenario where relativistic particles from magnetically arrested disks (MADs), which could form when BHXBs are in quiescent or hard states, produce UHE gamma rays, while electrons in the jets produce GeV gamma-ray emission. Specifically, magnetic turbulence in MADs heats up and accelerates electrons and protons, while magnetic reconnection in jets accelerates electrons. Sub-PeV gamma rays and neutrinos are produced when relativistic protons interact with the thermal protons and the radiation by thermal electrons in the disk. We discuss the perspectives of observing sub-PeV multi-messenger signals from individual BHXBs. Finally, we evaluate the integrated fluxes of the quiescent and hard-state BHXB population and find that BHXBs may contribute to the Galactic diffuse emission above $\sim 100$ TeV.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetohydrodynamic disk-winds play a key role in the formation of massive stars by providing the fine-tuning between accretion and ejection, where excess angular momentum is redirected away from the disk, allowing further mass growth. However, only a limited number of disk-wind sources have been detected to date. To better constrain the exact mechanism of this phenomenon, expanding the sample is critical. We performed an analysis of the disk-wind candidate G11.92-0.61 MM1 by estimating the physical parameters of the system and constraining the wind-launching mechanism. Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band 6 observations were conducted in September 2021 with ALMA's longest baselines, which provided a synthesised beam of $\sim$30 mas. We obtained high-resolution images of the CH$_3$CN ($v_8=1$ and $v=0$), CH$_3$OH, SO$_2$, and SO molecular lines, and the 1.3 mm continuum. Our molecular data allowed us to refine the parameters of the disk-outflow system in MM1. The rotating disk is resolved into two regions with distinct kinematics: the inner region ($<$300 au) is traced by high-velocity emission of high-excitation CH$_3$CN lines and shows a Keplerian rotation; the outer region ($>$300 au), traced by mid-velocity CH$_3$CN emission, rotates in a sub-Keplerian regime. The central source is estimated to be $\sim$20 $M_{\odot}$, which is about half the mass estimated in previous lower-resolution studies. A strong collimated outflow is traced by SO and SO$_2$ emission up to $\sim$3400 au around MM1a. The SO and SO$_2$ emissions show a rotation-dominated velocity pattern, a constant specific angular momentum, and a Keplerian profile that suggests a magneto-centrifugal disk-wind origin with launching radii of $\sim$50-100 au. G11.92-0.61 MM1 appears to be one of the clearest cases of molecular line-traced disk-winds detected around massive protostars.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent high-resolution observations have enabled detailed investigations of the circumstellar environments around Class 0/I protostars. Several studies have reported that the infall velocity of the envelope is a few times smaller than the free-fall velocity inferred from protostellar masses estimated via the observed rotational velocity of their Keplerian disks. To explore the physical origins of the slow infall, we perform a set of three-dimensional non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the star formation process, extending to $10^5$ yr after protostar formation. Our simulations show that the infall velocity decreases markedly at the outer edge of the pseudo-disk (at radii of $\sim \! 100-1000$ au) and is much slower than the expected free-fall velocity. The degree of this reduction depends on (1) the initial magnetic field strength, (2) the alignment between the initial field and the rotation axis, and (3) the evolutionary stage of the system. Across our parameter space, the ratio of the infall velocity to the free-fall velocity is as small as $0.2-0.5$, which is consistent with the observations. We further examine the reliability of protostellar mass estimates derived from infall and rotational velocities. While the mass derived from disk rotation closely matches the true value, deviation by a factor of $0.3-2$ is found for the estimates using the infall velocity; it is underestimated due to slow infall, but could also be overestimated due to the contribution of disk mass. These findings underscore the critical role of magnetic fields in shaping star formation dynamics and highlight the uncertainties associated with protostellar mass estimates.

 - **Abstract**
 The gravitational wave (GW) event S230518h is a potential binary neutron star-black hole merger (NSBH) event that was detected during engineering run 15 (ER15), which served as the commissioning period before the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) O4a observing run. Despite its low probability of producing detectable electromagnetic emissions, we performed extensive follow-up observations of this event using the GECKO telescopes in the southern hemisphere. Our observation covered 61.7\% of the 90\% credible region, a $\rm 284\:deg^2$ area accessible from the southern hemisphere, reaching a median limiting magnitude of $R=21.6$ mag. In these images, we conducted a systematic search for an optical counterpart of this event by combining a CNN-based classifier and human verification. We identified 128 transient candidates, but no significant optical counterpart was found that could have caused the GW signal. Furthermore, we provide feasible KN properties that are consistent with the upper limits of observation. Although no optical counterpart was found, our result demonstrates both GECKO's efficient wide-field follow-up capabilities and usefulness for constraining properties of kilonovae from NSBH mergers at distances of $\sim 200$ Mpc.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic-ray acceleration processes in astrophysical plasmas are often investigated with fully-kinetic or hybrid kinetic numerical simulations, which enable us to describe a detailed microphysics of particle energization mechanisms. Tracing of individual particles in such simulations is especially useful in this regard. However, visually inspecting particle trajectories introduces a significant amount of bias and uncertainty, making it challenging to pinpoint specific acceleration mechanisms. Here, we present a novel approach utilising neural networks to assist in the analysis of individual particle data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach using the dataset from our recent particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of non-relativistic perpendicular shocks that consists of 252,000 electrons, each characterised by their position, momentum and electromagnetic field at particle's position, recorded in a time series of 1200 time steps. These electrons cross a region affected by the electrostatic Buneman instability, and a small percentage of them attain high energies. We perform classification, regression, and anomaly detection algorithms on the dataset by using a convolutional neural network, a multi-layer perceptron, and an autoencoder. Despite the noisy and imbalanced dataset, all methods demonstrate the capability to differentiate between thermal and accelerated electrons with remarkable accuracy. The proposed methodology may considerably simplify particle classification in large-scale PIC and hybrid simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 We develop a new semi-analytic framework of Population (Pop) III and subsequent galaxy formation designed to run on dark matter halo merger trees. In our framework, we consider the effect of the Lyman-Werner flux from Pop III and II stars and the dark matter baryon streaming velocity on the critical minihalo mass for the Pop III formation. Our model incorporates the Lyman-Werner feedback in a self-consistent way, therefore, the spatial variation of Lyman-Werner feedback naturally emerges. The Pop III mass depends on the properties of a minihalo as reproducing radiative hydrodynamical simulation results. We perform statistical studies of Pop III stars by applying this framework to high-resolution cosmological N-body simulations with a maximum box size of 16 Mpc/h and enough mass resolution to resolve Pop III-forming minihalos. A top-heavy initial mass function emerges and two peaks corresponding to the H$_2$ ($20 \lesssim z \lesssim 25$) and atomic cooling halos ($z \lesssim 15$) exist in the distribution. Supermassive stars can be formed in the atomic cooling halos, and the fractions of such supermassive stars increase with the value of streaming velocity. At least an 8 Mpc/h simulation box and the self-consistent model for the Lyman-Werner feedback are necessary to correctly model the Pop III formation in the atomic cooling halos. Our model predicts one supermassive star per halo with several $10^9$ Msun at z=7.5, which is enough to reproduce a high redshift quasar.

 - **Abstract**
 We use a sample of Type 1 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) spectra in order to investigate which atomic processes are responsible for some observed properties of the FeII emission lines and how they are connected with macroscopic physical characteristics of AGN emission regions. We especially focus on the violated relative intensities between different optical FeII lines, whose relative strengths do not follow the expected values according to atomic parameters. We investigated the connection between this effect and the ratio of optical to UV FeII lines (FeII$_{opt}$/FeII$_{UV}$). We divided the optical FeII lines into two large line groups: consistent (FeII$_{cons}$), whose relative intensities are in accordance with their atomic properties, and inconsistent (FeII$_{incons}$), whose relative intensities are significantly stronger than theoretically expected. We fitted the spectra with a flexible optical FeII model, where Fe II lines were divided into several line groups and fitted independently. We focused particularly on understanding the processes that produce strong inconsistent Fe II lines, and therefore, we investigated their correlations with FeII$_{cons}$ and with UV FeII lines. The ratios of FeII$_{incons}$/FeII$_{cons}$ and FeII$_{opt}$/FeII$_{UV}$ increase as the Eddington ratio increases and as the line widths decrease. It is possible that both ratios are affected by the process of self-absorption of stronger lines, which is responsible for the transmission of energy from the UV to the optical FeII emission lines and, analogously, from the FeII$_{cons}$ to the FeII$_{incons}$ lines. In this scenario, the high Eddington ratio causes an increase in the optical depth in FeII lines, which results in the triggering of the process of self-absorption. The observed FeII spectrum is probably a complex mixture of radiation from emission regions with different physical conditions.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the origin and evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBH) stands as one of the most important challenges in astrophysics and cosmology, with little current theoretical consensus. Improved observational constraints on the cosmological evolution of SMBH demographics are needed. Here we report results of a search via photometric variability for SMBHs appearing as active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the cosmological volume defined by the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF). This work includes particular focus on a new observation carried out in 2023 with the \textit{Hubble Space Telescope (HST)} using the WFC3/IR/F140W, which is compared directly to equivalent data taken 11 years earlier in 2012. Two earlier pairs of observations from 2009 to 2012 with WFC3/IR/F105W and WFC3/IR/F160W are also analysed. We identify 443, 149, and 78 AGN candidates as nuclear sources that exhibit photometric variability at a level of 2, 2.5 and 3~$\sigma$ in at least one filter. This sample includes 29, 14, and 9 AGN at redshifts $z>6$, when the Universe was $\lesssim900$~Myr old. After variability and luminosity function (down to $M_{\rm UV}=-17\:$mag) completeness corrections, we estimate the co-moving number density of SMBHs, $n_{\rm SMBH}(z)$. At $z = 6 - 9$, $n_{\rm SMBH}\gtrsim 10^{-2}\:{\rm cMpc^{-3}}$. At low-$z$ our observations are sensitive to AGN fainter than $M_{\rm UV}=-17 \:$mag, and we estimate $n_{\rm SMBH}\gtrsim 6\times 10^{-2}\:{\rm cMpc^{-3}}$. We discuss how these results place strong constraints on a variety of SMBH seeding theories.

 - **Abstract**
 Small-scale magnetic flux emergence in the quiet Sun is crucial for maintaining solar magnetic activity. On the smallest scales studied so far, namely within individual granules, two mechanisms have been identified: emergence in tiny magnetic loops and emergence in the form of magnetic flux sheets covering the granule. While there are abundant observations of tiny magnetic loops within granules, the evidence for the emergence of granule-covering magnetic sheets is much more limited. This work aims to statistically analyze magnetic flux sheets, quantify their frequency on the solar surface and their potential contribution to the solar magnetic budget in the photosphere, and investigate the plasma dynamics and granular-scale phenomena associated with their emergence. Using spectro-polarimetric datasets from the solar optical telescope aboard the Hinode satellite and the ground-based Swedish Solar telescope, we developed a two-step method to identify magnetic flux sheet emergence events, detecting magnetic flux patches based on the calculation of the transverse and longitudinal magnetic flux density and associating them with their host granules based on velocity field analysis. We identified 42 events of magnetic flux sheet emergence and characterized their magnetic properties and the associated plasma dynamics of their host granules. Our results align with numerical simulations, indicating a similar occurrence rate. We investigated the relationship between magnetic flux emergence and granular phenomena, finding that flux sheets often emerge in association with standard nascent granules, as well as exploding granules, or granules with granular lanes. In particular, we highlight the potential role of recycled magnetic flux from downflow regions in facilitating flux sheet emergence.

 - **Abstract**
 Peaked-spectrum (PS) sources, known for their distinct peaked radio spectra, represent a type of radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN). Among these, megahertz-peaked spectrum (MPS) sources, which exhibit a spectral peak at a frequency of a hundred megahertz, have emerged as a potential tool for identifying high-redshift candidates. However, the potential evolutionary link between the fraction of these sources and redshift remains unclear and requires further investigation. The recent, high sensitivity Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) surveys enable statistical studies of these objects to ultra-low frequencies (< 150 MHz). In this study, we first use the multiradio data to investigate the evolution of spectral index with redshift for 1,187 quasars from the SDSS 16th quasar catalog. For each quasar, we analyze available data from the LOFAR Low Band Antenna (LBA) at 54 MHz, High Band Antenna (HBA) at 144 MHz, and the Very Large Array (VLA) the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty cm (FIRST) at 1.4 GHz. We measure the spectral index ($\alpha^{144}_{54}$ and $\alpha^{1400}_{144}$) and find no significant change in their median values with the redshift. Extended sources have steeper spectral indices than compact sources, which is consistent with previous findings. Based on the spectral indices information, we identify MPS sources using these criteria: $\rm \alpha^{144}_{54} >= 0.1$ and $\rm \alpha^{1400}_{144} < 0$, and analyze their properties. We find that the fraction of MPS sources is constant with the redshift ($0.1-4.8$), bolometric luminosity ($\rm 10^{44}-10^{48} erg/s$), and supermassive black hole mass ($\rm 10^{7}-10^{10.5} M_{\odot}$), which suggests that MPS sources have relatively stable physical conditions or formation mechanisms across various evolutionary stages and environments.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the multi-wavelength and environmental properties of 37 variability-selected active galactic nuclei (AGNs), including 30 low luminosity AGNs (LLAGNs), using a high cadence time-domain survey (ASAS-SN) from a spectroscopic sample of 1218 nearby bright galaxies. We find that high-cadence time-domain surveys uniquely select LLAGNs that do not necessarily satisfy other AGN selection methods, such as X-ray, mid-IR, or BPT methods. In our sample, 3% of them pass the mid-infrared color based AGN selection, 18% pass the X-ray luminosity based AGN selection, and 60% pass the BPT selection. This result is supported by two other LLAGN samples from high-cadence time-domain surveys of TESS and PTF, suggesting that the variability selection method from well-sampled light curves can find AGNs that may not be discovered otherwise. These AGNs can have moderate to small amplitudes of variability from the accretion disk, but, of many of them, with no strong corona, emission lines from the central engine, or accretion power to dominate the mid-IR emission. The X-ray spectra of a sub-sample of bright sources are consistent with a power law model. Upon inspecting the environments of our sample, we find that LLAGNs are more common in denser environments of galaxy clusters in contrast with the trend established in the literature for luminous AGNs at low redshifts, which is broadly consistent with our analysis result for luminous AGNs limited by a smaller sample size. This contrast in environmental properties between LLAGN and luminous AGNs suggests that LLAGNs may have different trigger mechanisms.

 - **Abstract**
 Comets, asteroids, and other small bodies are thought to be remnants of the original planetesimal population of the Solar System. As such, their physical, chemical, and isotopic properties hold crucial details on how and where they formed and how they evolved. Yet, placing precise constraints on the formation region of these bodies has been challenging. Data from spacecraft missions have a particularly high potential of addressing the question of the origin of the visited bodies. ESA's Rosetta mission to comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko returned data from the comet for two years on its journey around the Sun. This extensive data set has revolutionised our view on comets and still holds unsolved problems. We use the Rosetta/ROSINA (Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis) measurement of the volatile/ice composition and the Rosetta/COSIMA (COmetary Secondary Ion Mass Analyzer) measurements of the refractory composition of comet 67P. These measurements are combined using a Monte Carlo method. The refractory-to-ice ratio is a free parameter that is constrained a posteriori. Using only the composition, we constrain the refractory-to-ice ratio to $0.5<\chi<1.7$, and derive the bulk elemental abundances for 67P of H, C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, S, K, Ar, Ca, Cr, Mn, Fe, Kr, and Xe. We find the noble gas xenon in near solar elemental abundance in comet 67P. Krypton is slightly depleted, while argon is heavily depleted. Comet 67P is enriched in all three noble gases by up to 2.5 orders of magnitude compared to CI chondrites. We show this is consistent with a formation region between 25 and 35 au in a protoplanetary disk region with temperatures between 30 and 40 K and with the trapping of dust for a long time in rings of the protoplanetary disk.
