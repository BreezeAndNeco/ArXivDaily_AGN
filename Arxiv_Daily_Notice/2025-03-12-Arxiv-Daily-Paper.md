 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic accreting white dwarfs in cataclysmic variables have been known to show bursts driven by different physical mechanisms; however, the burst occurrence is much rarer than in their non-magnetic counterparts. DW Cnc is a well-studied intermediate polar that showed a burst with a 4-magnitude amplitude in 2007. Here we report on a recent burst in DW Cnc observed by ASAS-SN that reached a peak luminosity of 6.6 $\times$ 10$^{33}$ erg~s$^{-1}$, another 4 mag increase from its quiescent high state level. The released energy of the burst suggests that these are micronovae, a distinctive type of burst seen in magnetic systems that may be caused by a thermonuclear runaway in the confined accretion flow. Only a handful of systems, most of them intermediate polars, have a reported micronova bursts. We also report on the reappearance of the negative superhump of DW~Cnc as shown by TESS and OPTICAM data after the system emerges from its low state and immediately before the burst. We further report on a new phenomenon, where the spin signal turns "on" and "off" on the precession period associated with the negative superhump, which may indicate pole flipping. The new classification of DW Cnc as a micronova as well as the spin variability show the importance of both monitoring known micronova systems and systematic searches for more similar bursts, to limit reliance on serendipitous discoveries.

 - **Abstract**
 (abridged) To understand early star formation, it is essential to determine the dust mass budget of high-redshift galaxies. Sub-millimeter rest-frame emission, dominated by cold dust, is an unbiased tracer of dust mass. The NIKA2 camera conducted a deep blank field survey at 1.2 and 2.0 mm in the GOODS-N field as part of the NIKA2 Cosmological Legacy Survey (N2CLS), detecting 65 sources with SNR>=4.2. Thanks to a dedicated interferometric program with NOEMA and other high-angular resolution data, we identify the multi-wavelength counterparts of these sources and resolve them into 71 individual galaxies. We build detailed SEDs and assign a redshift to 68 of them, over the range 0.6<z<7.2. We fit these SEDs using MBB and Draine & Li (2007) models, and the panchromatic approaches MAGPHYS, CIGALE, and SED3FIT, thus deriving their dust mass, M(dust), infrared luminosity (LIR), and stellar mass, M(star). Eight galaxies require an AGN-torus component and other six require an unextinguished young stellar population. A significant fraction of our galaxies are classified as starbursts based on their position on the M(star) versus SFR plane or their depletion timescales. We compute the dust mass function in three redshift bins (1.6<z<=2.4, 2.4<z<=4.2 and 4.2<z<=7.2) and determine the Schechter function that best describes it. We observe an increase of the dust cosmic density, rho(dust), by at least an order of magnitude from z~7 to z~1.5, consistent with theoretical predictions. At lower redshift the evolution flattens; significant differences exist between results obtained with different selections and methods. The superb GOODS-N dataset enabled a systematic investigation into the dust properties of distant galaxies. N2CLS holds promise for combining these deep field findings with the wide COSMOS field into a self-consistent analysis of dust in galaxies both near and far.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent James Webb Space Telescope observations have revealed a peculiar class of galaxies at redshifts $z \gtrsim 6$, characterized by extremely high central stellar densities and overmassive central supermassive black holes (SMBHs), "little red dots" (LRDs). A critical question remains: If LRDs were common at high redshifts, how would they evolve into local elliptical galaxies with significantly lower central densities? To address this, we performed direct $N$-body simulations of LRD mergers, focusing on the coevolution of host galaxies and central SMBHs. We track the complete evolution of SMBH binaries into the three-body hardening and gravitational-wave (GW) emission phase. Our results demonstrate that during galaxy mergers, the central SMBHs can eject a substantial amount of mass from the galactic core via the three-body slingshot effect, leading to a decrease in central stellar surface density by an order of magnitude. Additionally, GW recoil can further contribute in making the galaxy centers less dense and more in alignment with low-redshift quiescent galaxies. This transformation occurs on a relatively short timescale of a few $\sim$100 Myr, implying that LRDs can evolve into lower-redshift elliptical galaxies by $z<4$. The timescales for our SMBH mergers vary between 100 Myr and 800 Myr, depending on the initial orbital parameters of the merging galaxies and the mass ratio of the SMBHs. Our findings provide a plausible mechanism for the transformation of LRDs into elliptical galaxies while highlighting the efficiency of SMBH mergers in such high-density environments, which plays a crucial role in SMBH growth.
#### Relativistic ions with power-law spectra explain radio phoenixes

 - **Abstract**
 Radio phoenixes are filamentary sources in the intracluster medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters, often extending over $>100$ kpc, arising from fossil radio lobes. Their soft, curved spectrum is widely attributed to aged relativistic electrons recently accelerated or compressed, but at high frequencies is shown to approach a power-law. Moreover, the full, curved spectrum is naturally reproduced by secondary $e^{\pm}$ from a pure power-law spectrum of relativistic ions, radiating in highly-magnetized filaments; this model provides a better fit to all phoenixes, with only three free parameters. Weaker magnetization shifts the curvature to low frequencies, explaining pure power-law phoenixes. Hadronic high-curvature phoenixes require $e^{\pm}$ heating, by a factor $\gtrsim 15$ if at ICM pressure. The $\sim$keV Compton- and $\sim$GeV $\pi^0$-decay-peaked counterparts of hadronic phoenixes may be detectable as non-thermal X-rays and $\gamma$-rays.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of the molecular specific angular momentum-mass ($j_{H_2}-M_{H_2}$) relation using a sample of 51 nearby disc galaxies from the PHANGS-ALMA survey with deep, high-resolution molecular gas rotation curves and surface density profiles. For the very first time, using a statistical sample, we report the discovery of a well-defined $j_{H_2}-M_{H_2}$ relation. We quantify the scaling law by fitting a power-law with a Bayesian framework, finding $j_{H_2} \propto M_{H_2}^{0.53}$. This slope closely resembles the well-known stellar $j_{\ast}$-$M_{\ast}$ (Fall) relation, highlighting the dynamical connection between molecular gas and stars. We show that the $j_{H_2}-M_{H_2}$ relation cannot be fully explained by analytic models of disc stability but instead is well recovered with more complex physics as implemented in the Shark semi-analytical model. These findings demonstrate the power of our novel $j_{H_2}-M_{H_2}$ relation in testing galaxy evolution theories and setting new constraints for models and simulations which aim to reproduce a realistic interstellar medium. Additionally, our findings provide a critical benchmark for upcoming high-redshift studies of molecular gas kinematics, offering a local baseline to study the evolution of cold gas dynamics across cosmic time.

 - **Abstract**
 KELT-20b is a well-studied exoplanet within the highly observable ultra hot Jupiter (UHJ) regime, yet its multidimensional atmospheric structure remains largely unconstrained. Recent advances in instrumentation and increased general circulation model (GCM) complexity have enabled observers to resolve the imprints of more intricate physical mechanisms in time-resolved data. We performed high-resolution cross-correlation transmission spectroscopy (HRCCTS) on a single transit time series of KELT-20b, observed with PEPSI on the LBT. We detect Fe I $(11.9\sigma)$ and Fe II $(23.7\sigma)$ and tentatively detect Na I $(3.4\sigma)$ and Cr I $(3.3\sigma)$ upon combining nineteen in-transit exposures. The full-transit velocity offsets of the strongest absorbers are $\Delta V_{\text{Fe I}} = -1.0 \pm 0.7$ km s$^{-1}$ and $\Delta V_{\text{Fe II}}= 0.0\pm 0.5$ km s$^{-1}$. These results are discrepant with other HRCCTS studies of KELT-20b, but these studies are largely inconsistent with each other due to multiple possible factors, including self-inconsistent treatment of systemic velocity. In response, we establish a stringent set of detection criteria to promote reproducibility in future works. We present phase-resolved absorption traces of species with high detection significance. Fe I and Fe II's absorption traces are both redshifted at ingress, cross to a blueshift after mid-transit, then settle at a net blueshift at egress; concurrently, SNR increases with phase. This behavior is consistent with absorption traces post-processed from an active magnetic drag GCM for another UHJ. However, the net blueshift during transit could also result from limb asymmetry drivers and/or longitudinally variable wind structure. This ambiguity motivates future theoretical work on KELT-20b.

 - **Abstract**
 The feedback from massive stars drives the evolution of interstellar dust grains by altering their physical properties via a number of radiative and mechanical processes. Through these interactions, interstellar grains can achieve high rotational velocities due to unbalanced torques, potentially leading to their disruption. Mechanical torque disruption occurs when gas-grain collisions, induced by the passage of shocks, spin grains to critical rotational velocities. This study aims to investigate the effects of stochastic mechanical torque disruption on both pre-existent and supernova-condensed dust grains located within wind-blown bubbles. The impact of mechanical torque disruption on supernova-condensed dust and dust grains in wind-blown bubbles is investigated through post-processing of three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulation outputs. The associated timescale is then compared to those of kinetic sputtering and grain shattering. Before the supernova explosion, dust grain disruption timescales within wind-driven bubbles are on the order of millions of years due to the low-density environment. The timescales for mechanical torque disruption (METD) are longer than those for kinetic sputtering and comparable to those of grain shattering, primarily due the high grain drift velocities typical of these regions.

 - **Abstract**
 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) feedback is one of the most important mechanisms in galaxy evolution. It is usually found in massive galaxies and regulates star formation. Although dwarf galaxies are assumed to be regulated by supernova feedback, recent studies show evidence for the presence of AGN outflows and feedback in dwarf galaxies. We investigate the presence of AGN outflows in a sample of 2292 dwarf galaxies with AGN signatures drawn from the MaNGA survey. Thanks to the integral field unit data from MaNGA we are able to spatially resolve these outflows and study their kinematics and energetics. Using the GELATO Python code, we fit the AGN-stacked spectrum of each galaxy, which is the stack of all the spaxels classified as AGN by emission line diagnostic diagrams, and in particular the [OIII]$\lambda$5007Å emission line. If the galaxies show a broad [OIII] emission line component in the stacked spectrum, we run GELATO through all the spaxels that are classified as AGN in the emission line diagnostic diagrams. We find 11 new dwarf galaxies that present outflow signatures based on the presence of a broad [OIII] emission line component. Their velocity W$_{80}$ (width containing 80$\%$ of the flux of the [OIII]$\lambda$5007Å emission line) ranges from 205 to 566 km s$^{-1}$ and the kinetic energy rate ranges from $\sim10^{35}$ to $\sim10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Stellar processes are unlikely to explain these outflow kinetic energy rates in the case of seven dwarf galaxies. We find a correlation between the W$_{80}$ velocity and the [OIII] luminosity and between the kinetic energy rate of the outflow and the bolometric luminosity spanning from massive to dwarf galaxies. This suggests a similar behavior between the AGN outflows in the dwarf galaxy population with those in massive galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze the X-ray and radio properties of the galaxy cluster Abell 2009 (z=0.152) to complete the in-depth study of a subsample of objects from the ROSAT Brightest Cluster Sample with relatively high X-ray flux and H$\alpha$ line luminosity, which is a promising diagnostic of the presence of cool gas in the cluster cores. Our aim is to investigate the feedback from the AGN in the central galaxy and the ICM of relaxed clusters. In this work, we analyze archival data from JVLA and Chandra observations. We performed a morphological analysis of both the X-ray emission from the ICM of Abell 2009 and the radio emission from the AGN in the central galaxy. We also performed a spectral analysis of the X-ray emission to derive the global properties and radial profiles of the thermal gas. Our X-ray analysis confirms the expectations, based on the selection criteria, that Abell 2009 is a cool-core system. We estimate a cooling radius of 88 kpc within which the ICM is radiating its energy at rates of $L_{cool} \sim 4.4 \times 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Radio observations of the central galaxy reveal a bright core surrounded by radio lobes on 30 kpc scales with a symmetric butterfly-shaped morphology. Although we did not detect any X-ray cavity at the position of the central radio lobes, we combined the volume of the lobes with the pressure of the surrounding ICM to derive the work done by the AGN on the gas to inflate them. By estimating a cavity age of about 20 Myr, this corresponds to a mechanical power of $\approx 10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$ which is sufficient to counterbalance the radiative cooling losses in Abell 2009. We finally discuss possible correlations between the global properties of the 18 objects from the BCS selection, finding in particular that the number of outbursts required to counterbalance the radiative ICM losses is linearly anticorrelated with the energy and power of the outburst.

 - **Abstract**
 Circumstellar disk dust polarization in the (sub)millimeter is, for the most part, not from dust grain alignment with magnetic fields but rather indicative of a combination of dust self-scattering with a yet unknown alignment mechanism that is consistent with mechanical alignment. While the observational evidence for scattering has been well established, that for mechanical alignment is less so. Circum-multiple dust structures in protostellar systems provide a unique environment to probe different polarization alignment mechanisms. We present ALMA Band 4 and Band 7 polarization observations toward the multiple young system L1448 IRS3B. The polarization in the two Bands is consistent with each other, presenting multiple polarization morphologies. On the size scale of the inner envelope surrounding the circum-multiple disk, the polarization is consistent with magnetic field dust grain alignment. On the very small scale of compact circumstellar regions, we see polarization that is consistent with scattering around source a and c, which are likely the most optically thick components. Finally, we see polarization that is consistent with mechanical alignment of dust grains along the spiral dust structures, which would suggest that the dust is tracing the relative gas flow along the spiral arms. If the gas-flow dust grain alignment mechanism is dominant in these cases, disk dust polarization may provide a direct probe of the small-scale kinematics of the gas flow relative to the dust grains.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new analytical galactic chemical evolution (GCE) model with gas inflow, internally caused outflow, and extra gas loss after a period of time. The latter mimics the ram pressure stripping of a dwarf satellite galaxy near the pericenter of its orbit around a host galaxy. The new model is called Inflow with Ram Pressure Stripping (IRPS). We fit the $\alpha$-element ([$\alpha$/H]) distributions of the Draco, Sculptor, Fornax, Leo II, Leo I, and And XVIII dwarf spheroidal galaxies. We compared the best fits of IRPS with four other GCE models. The IRPS fits half of the galaxies in our set better than the Leaky Box, Pre-enriched, Accretion, and Ram Pressure Stripping models. Unlike previous models, none of the IRPS model parameters -- not even the effective yield -- correlates with galaxy properties, like luminosity. One of the IRPS parameters is the $\alpha$-abundance at which stripping began. That parameter can override the effective yield in determining the galaxy's mean $\alpha$-abundance.

#### Variation of Dense Gas Mass-Luminosity conversion factor with metallicity in the Milky Way

 - **Abstract**
 HCN and HCO$^+$ are the most common dense gas tracers used both in the Milky Way and external galaxies. The luminosity of HCN and HCO$^+$ $J = 1-0$ lines are converted to a dense gas mass by the conversion factor, $\alpha_{Q}$. Traditionally, this $\alpha_{Q}$ has been considered constant throughout the Galaxy and in other galaxies, regardless of the environment. We analyzed 17 outer Galaxy clouds and 5 inner Galaxy clouds with metallicities ranging from 0.38 Z$_{\odot}$ to 1.29 Z$_{\odot}$. Our analysis indicates that $\alpha_{Q}$ is not constant; instead, it varies with metallicity. The metallicity-corrected $\alpha_{Q}$ derived from the HCN luminosity of the entire cloud is almost three times higher in the outer Galaxy than in the inner galaxy. In contrast, HCO$^+$ seems less sensitive to metallicity. We recommend using the metallicity-corrected dense gas conversion factors $\alpha^{'}_{\rm tot, Gas}(\rm HCN) = 19.5^{+5.6}_{-4.4} Z^{(-1.53 \pm 0.59)}$ and $\alpha^{'}_{\rm tot, Gas}(\rm HCO^{+}) = 21.4^{+5.5}_{-4.4} Z^{(-1.32\pm0.55)}$ for extragalactic studies. Radiation from nearby stars has an effect on the conversion factor of similar magnitude as that of the metallicity. If we extend the metallicity-corrected scaling relation for HCN to the Central Molecular Zone, the value of $\alpha(\rm HCN)$ becomes $1/3$ to $1/2$ of the local values. This effect could partially account for the low star formation rate per dense gas mass observed in the CMZ.

 - **Abstract**
 Quasars, powered by supermassive black holes (SMBH), are among the brightest objects in the universe. In the vicinity of an SMBH, X-ray photons from an active galactic nucleus (AGN) can heat the surrounding gas to several hundred kelvin. Here we report observations of dust continuum and CO J=13-12 and J=14-13 line emissions at a resolution of 130 parsecs in a luminous quasar at z=6. We successfully detected these high-J CO line emissions from warm gas in a compact disk component. The CO luminosity ratio in the central region of the compact disk is consistent with theoretical models in which X-ray heating dominates the CO excitation and the gas column density is as high as 10$^{25}$ cm$^{-2}$. This demonstrates that high-resolution observations of high-J CO lines are promising ways to identify extremely dust-obscured quasars in the early universe.

PhyE2E simplifies symbolic regression by decomposing it into sub-problems using the second-order derivatives of an oracle neural network, and employs a transformer model to translate data into symbolic formulas in an end-to-end manner. The resulting formulas are refined through Monte-Carlo Tree Search and Genetic Programming. We leverage a large language model to synthesize extensive symbolic expressions resembling real physics, and train the model to recover these formulas directly from data. A comprehensive evaluation reveals that PhyE2E outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, delivering superior symbolic accuracy, precision in data fitting, and consistency in physical units. We deployed PhyE2E to five applications in space physics, including the prediction of sunspot numbers, solar rotational angular velocity, emission line contribution functions, near-Earth plasma pressure, and lunar-tide plasma signals. The physical formulas generated by AI demonstrate a high degree of accuracy in fitting the experimental data from satellites and astronomical telescopes. We have successfully upgraded the formula proposed by NASA in 1993 regarding solar activity, and for the first time, provided the explanations for the long cycle of solar activity in an explicit form. We also found that the decay of near-Earth plasma pressure is proportional to r^2 to Earth, where subsequent mathematical derivations are consistent with satellite data from another independent study. Moreover, we found physical formulas that can describe the relationships between emission lines in the extreme ultraviolet spectrum of the Sun, temperatures, electron densities, and magnetic fields. The formula obtained is consistent with the properties that physicists had previously hypothesized it should possess.

 - **Abstract**
 The high-frequency radio sky is bursting with synchrotron transients from massive stellar explosions and accretion events, but the low-frequency radio sky has so far been quiet beyond the Galactic pulsar population and the long-term scintillation of AGN. The low-frequency band, however, is sensitive to exotic coherent and polarised radio emission processes such as electron cyclotron maser emission from flaring M-dwarfs [1], stellar magnetospheric plasma interactions with exoplanets [2], and a population of steep-spectrum pulsars [3], making Galactic plane searches a prospect for blind transient discovery. Here we report an analysis of archival low-frequency radio data that reveals a periodic, low-frequency radio transient. We find that the source pulses every 18.18 minutes, an unusual periodicity not previously observed. The emission is highly linearly polarised, bright, persists for 30--60 s on each occurrence, and is visible across a broad frequency range. At times the pulses comprise short ($<0.5$-s) duration bursts; at others, a smoother profile is observed. These profiles evolve on timescales of hours. By measuring the dispersion of the radio pulses with respect to frequency, we have localised the source to within our own Galaxy, and suggest that it could be an ultra-long period magnetar.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently several long-period radio transients have been discovered, with strongly polarised coherent radio pulses appearing on timescales between tens to thousands of seconds [1,2]. In some cases the radio pulses have been interpreted as coming from rotating neutron stars with extremely strong magnetic fields, known as magnetars; the origin of other, occasionally periodic and less well-sampled radio transients, is still debated [3]. Coherent periodic radio emission is usually explained by rotating dipolar magnetic fields and pair production mechanisms, but such models do not easily predict radio emission from such slowly-rotating neutron stars and maintain it for extended times. On the other hand, highly magnetic isolated white dwarfs would be expected to have long spin periodicities, but periodic coherent radio emission has not yet been directly detected from these sources. Here we report observations of a long-period (21 minutes) radio transient, which we have labeled GPMJ1839-10. The pulses vary in brightness by two orders of magnitude, last between 30 and 300 seconds, and have quasi-periodic substructure. The observations prompted a search of radio archives, and we found that the source has been repeating since at least 1988. The archival data enabled constraint of the period derivative to $<3.6\times10^{-13}$s s$^{-1}$, which is at the very limit of any classical theoretical model that predicts dipolar radio emission from an isolated neutron star.

 - **Abstract**
 The interaction between the accretion disc and its corona plays a critical role in the energy balance and emission mechanisms in astrophysical systems such as active galactic nuclei and X-ray binaries. However, the detailed physics of disc-corona interactions, including the mechanisms driving disc evaporation, and the impact of accretion rate and viscosity, remains poorly understood. Our study aims to extend the well-known disc evaporation model to investigate the disc-corona interaction in a 2D axisymmetric, time-dependent hydrodynamic model, focusing on the effects of viscosity, accretion rate, and their influence on disc evaporation, luminosity, and corona formation. We develop a hydrodynamic model consisting of a thin accretion disc, a corona, and a vacuum region. Our model is implemented in \textit{Athena++}, with the gas-vacuum interface tracking algorithm to handle the vacuum regions. We perform simulations incorporating turbulent viscosity, thermal conduction, Bremsstrahlung cooling, and artificial disc cooling, starting from an adiabatic state to explore the disc-corona interaction. We demonstrate the presence of acoustic shock heating, a mechanism widely studied in the solar physics community but less explored in the context of accretion discs. We find that the viscosity dominates the intensity of disc evaporation, the accretion rate primarily determines the disc truncation radius and the disc luminosity, and there may be a positive correlation between the corona luminosity and the evaporation intensity. We also compare our results with the observations and simulations, and estimate the $y$-parameters to explore the potential effects of Compton cooling.

 - **Abstract**
 The identification of star clusters holds significant importance in studying galaxy formation and evolution history. However, the task of swiftly and accurately identifying star clusters from vast amounts of photometric images presents an immense challenge. To address these difficulties, we employ deep learning models for image classification to identify young disk star clusters in M31 from the Pan-Andromeda Archaeological Survey (PAndAS) images. For training, validation, and testing, we utilize the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) survey catalogs. We evaluate the performance of various deep learning models, using different classification thresholds and limiting magnitudes. Our findings indicate that the ResNet-50 model exhibits the highest overall accuracy. Moreover, using brighter limiting magnitudes and increasing the classification thresholds can effectively enhance the accuracy and precision of cluster identification. Through our experiments, we found that the model achieves optimal performance when the limiting magnitude is set to brighter than 21 mag. Based on this, we constructed a training dataset with magnitudes less than 21 mag and trained a second ResNet-50 model. This model achieved a purity of 89.30%, a recall of 73.55%, and an F1 score of 80.66% when the classification threshold was set to 0.669. Applying the second model to all sources in the PAndAS fields within a projected radius of 30 kpc from the center of M31, we identified 2,228 new unique star cluster candidates. We conducted visual inspections to validate the results produced by our automated methods, and we ultimately obtained 1,057 star cluster candidates, of which 745 are newly identified.

 - **Abstract**
 High-resolution X-ray spectroscopy is a key to understanding the mass inflow and outflow of compact objects. Spectral lines carry information about the ionization, density, and velocity structures through their intensity ratios and profiles. They are formed in non-local thermodynamic equilibrium conditions under the intense radiation field from the compact objects, thus radiative transfer (RT) calculation is a requisite for proper interpretations. We present such a study for a low-mass X-ray binary, Circinus X-1, from which the P Cygni profile was discovered using the X-ray grating spectrometer onboard Chandra. We observed the source using the X-ray microcalorimeter onboard XRISM at an orbital phase of 0.93-0.97 and revealed many spectral features unidentified before; the higher series transitions (n to 1; n > 2) of highly-ionized (H- and He-like) S, Ca, Ar, and Fe in emission and absorption, the Fe K{\alpha} and K\b{eta} inner-shell excitation absorption of mildly-ionized (O- to Li-like) Fe, and resolved fine-structure level transitions in the Fe Ly{\alpha} and He{\alpha} complexes. They blend with each other at different velocity shifts on top of apparently variable continuum emission that changed its flux by an order of magnitude within a 70 ks telescope time. Despite such complexity in the observed spectra, most of them can be explained by a simple model consisting of the photoionized plasma outflowing at ~300 km s-1 and the variable blocking material in the line of sight of the incident continuum emission from the accretion disk. We demonstrate this with the aid of the RT code cloudy for the line ratio diagnostics and spectral fitting. We further constrain the physical parameters of the outflow and argue that the outflow is launched close to the outer edge of the accretion disk and can be driven radiatively by being assisted by the line force calculated using the RT simulation.

 - **Abstract**
 OB stars are crucial for our understanding of Galactic structure, star formation, stellar feedback and multiplicity. In this paper we have compiled a census of all OB stars within 1 kpc of the Sun. We performed evolutionary and atmospheric model fits to observed spectral energy distributions (SEDs) compiled from astro-photometric survey data. We have characterized and mapped 24,706 O- and B-type stars ($T_{\rm eff} > 10,000$ K) within 1 kpc of the Sun, whose overdensities correspond to well-studied OB associations and massive star-forming regions such as Sco-Cen, Orion OB1, Vela OB2, Cepheus and Circinus. We have assessed the quality of our catalogue by comparing it with spectroscopic samples and similar catalogues of OB(A) stars, as well as catalogues of OB associations, star-forming regions and young open clusters. Finally, we have also exploited our list of OB stars to estimate their scale height (76 $\pm$ 1 pc), a local star formation rate of $2896^{+417}_{-1}$ M$_{\odot}$ Myr$^{-1}$ and a local core-collapse supernova rate of $\sim$15--30 per Myr. We extrapolate these rates to the entire Milky Way to derive a Galactic SFR of $0.67^{+0.09}_{-0.01}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and a core-collapse supernova rate of 0.4--0.5 per century. These are slightly lower than previous estimates, which we attribute to improvements in our census of OB stars and changes to evolutionary models. We calculate a near-Earth core collapse supernova rate of $\sim$2.5 per Gyr that supports the view that nearby supernova explosions could have caused one or more of the recorded mass extinction events on Earth.

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of GW170817, together with its electromagnetic counterparts, has proven that binary neutron star mergers are of central importance to the field of nuclear astrophysics, e.g., through a better understanding of the formation of elements and novel constraints on the supranuclear dense equation of state governing the matter inside neutron stars. Essential for understanding the binary coalescence are numerical-relativity simulations, which typically come with high computational costs requiring high-performance computing facilities. In this work, we build on recent studies to investigate whether novel techniques, such as neural networks, can be employed in the conversion of conservative variables to primitive hydrodynamical variables, such as pressure and density. In this regard, we perform -- to the best of our knowledge -- the first binary neutron star merger simulations in which such methods are employed. We show that this method results in stable simulations, reaching accuracies similar to traditional methods with an overall comparable computational cost. These simulations serve as a proof of principle that, in the future, deep learning techniques could be used within numerical-relativity simulations. However, further improvements are necessary to offer a computational advantage compared to traditional methods.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the discovery of circular polarization modulated with a period of 1.943 +- 0.002 h in the cataclysmic variable V1082 Sgr. These findings unambiguously reveal the rotation of a magnetic white dwarf and establish its intermediate polar (IP) nature. Along with its extraordinary long orbital period, Porb, of 20.8 h, the spin period (Pspin) places this system in an extreme position of the Pspin versus Porb distribution. The circular polarization phase diagram has a single peak and an amplitude smaller than 1%. These data were used to model the post-shock region of the accretion flow on the white-dwarf surface using the CYCLOPS code. We obtained a magnetic field in the white-dwarf pole of 11 MG and a magnetospheric radius consistent with the coupling region at around 2 - 3 white-dwarf radii. The Pspin/Porb value and the estimated magnetic field momentum suggest that V1082 Sgr could be out of spin equilibrium, in a spin-up state, possibly in a stream accretion mode.

 - **Abstract**
 We present predictions of the number and properties of strongly-lensed submillimetre galaxies, based on an adaption of the physically-motivated LensPop model covering galaxy-galaxy strong lensing by elliptical galaxies, which successfully predicted optical and near-infrared lenses. For submillimetre-luminous lensed galaxies, the most efficient observational selection identifies sources with high fluxes (S500um > 80 mJy), where lensed sources outnumber bright unlensed sources; several hundred candidates from Herschel surveys have been identified, and confirmed by follow-up observations. We have tested our model against these observations. The model predicts an all-sky number density of 0.09+/-0.05 deg-2 (in absolute numbers, 3,600+/-1,800) of bright lensed galaxies detectable by this method. Observations show considerable variation in sky density between fields, 0.08 - 0.31 deg-2. Predictions of redshift and magnification distributions are comparable to observations, although the model appears to under-predict lenses at the highest magnifications ( > 20). We predict that the apparent AB magnitudes at visible wavelengths of the foreground lenses will be as faint as 28, whereas observations typically reach ~ 23, implying that some apparently unlensed bright submillimetre galaxies may have lensing galaxies below this detection limit. For fainter lensed galaxies, the model predicts over 130,000 systems with flux S500um > 10 mJy across the sky, of which ~ 3,400 remain be be discovered in the Herschel catalogues. We also predict that Euclid should be able to detect some 25,000 lensed submillimetre galaxies that are VIS-band 'dropouts' - detectable in the near-infrared but not at optical wavelengths.

 - **Abstract**
 Black holes can launch powerful jets through the Blandford-Znajek process. This relies on enough plasma in the jet funnel to conduct the necessary current. However, in some low luminosity active galactic nuclei, the plasma supply near the jet base may be an issue. It has been proposed that spark gaps -- local regions with unscreened electric field -- can form in the magnetosphere, accelerating particles to initiate pair cascades, thus filling the jet funnel with plasma. In this paper, we carry out 2D general relativistic particle-in-cell (GRPIC) simulations of the gap, including self-consistent treatment of inverse Compton scattering and pair production. We observe gap dynamics that is fully consistent with our earlier 1D GRPIC simulations. We find strong dependence of the gap power on the soft photon spectrum and energy density, as well as the strength of the horizon magnetic field. We derive physically motivated scaling relations, and applying to M87, we find that the gap may be energetically viable for the observed TeV flares. For Sgr A$^*$, the energy dissipated in the gap may also be sufficient to power the X-ray flares.

 - **Abstract**
 The systemic velocity or redshift of galaxies is a convenient tool to calculate their distances in the absence of primary methods, but the uncertainties on these flow distances may be substantial due to galaxy peculiar motions. Here, we derive a simple and easily applicable method to assign uncertainties to flow distances from four different methodologies, namely the Hubble law with both heliocentric and local-sheet velocities, the Cosmicflows-4 model, and the Numerical Action Methods model. Our uncertainty scheme is derived by comparing these flow distances to accurate, redshift-independent distances of a subsample of ~2000 galaxies from the Cosmicflows-4 database, using the tip magnitude of the red giant branch, Cepheids, surface brightness fluctuations, supernovae type Ia, masers, and supernovae type II. We provide simple functions and tables to calculate the distance uncertainties for all the flow models considered. This uncertainty scheme is generally applicable except for the region around the Virgo cluster, where we assign increased uncertainties due to larger peculiar motions.

 - **Abstract**
 Near-infrared spectra from the IRTF/SpeX and Blanco/ARCoIRIS telescope/instrument combinations are used for spectroscopic classification, to measure radial velocities and for the inference of astrophysical properties of 51 Gaia-selected nearby ultracool dwarfs. In this sample, 44 are newly classified in the near infrared. All but one of the UCDs are within 100 pc, and 37 lie within 50 pc. We find a total of 26 M-types, 24 L-types and one T-type in our sample. The positions of the majority of the UCDs on colour-magnitude diagrams and with evolutionary cooling track plots indicate that they are largely old and stellar in nature. There are a few UCDs of particular interest which lie away from expected trends, highlighting potential young, binary and thick disc/subdwarf UCDs. From spectral and kinematic analyses, we identify UCDs of particular interest for further investigation, including seven potentially young UCDs, three thick disc UCDs, one subdwarf, six wide binaries, and six unresolved binaries.

 - **Abstract**
 Solitons are predominantly observed in near-earth plasmas as well as planetary magnetospheres; however, their existence in the solar corona remains largely unexplored, despite theoretical investigations. This study aims to address this gap by examining the presence and dynamics of solitons in the solar corona, particularly in the context of coronal heating. Utilizing observational data from the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) during the onset of a strong Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) event, the analyses reveal a train of aperiodic solitons with increasing amplitude preceding the eruption. A key finding of this study is that the observed aperiodic soliton train serves as a potential candidate in facilitating energy transfer through dissipation within the coronal plasma, hereby, influencing the initiation of solar eruptive events such as a CME. A defining characteristic of this solitary train is its hypersonic and super-Alfvenic nature, evident from the presence of high Mach numbers that reinforces its role in plasma energy equilibration in the solar corona, thereby contributing to plasma heating.

 - **Abstract**
 T CrA is a Herbig Ae-type young star in a complex circumstellar environment; it includes a circumstellar disk, accretion streamers, jets, and outflows. It has long been suspected to be a binary. However, until now, there has been no direct detection of a companion. Here we present new VLTI/MATISSE L- and N-band observations of T CrA taken between 2023 May and 2024 August with the aim of testing the binary nature of the system. We modeled the data with a geometric model using the Python tool oimodeler. We detected a companion (T CrA B) with a projected separation of $\Delta r = 153.2 \pm 1.2$ mas ($\approx 23$ au) toward the west direction at a position angle of $275.4 \pm 0.1^\circ$, in 2024 May-August. Our results support that the companion has a nearly edge-on orbit that is highly misaligned with respect to the circumprimary disk. Such a configuration could cause warping and tearing of the disk around the primary, which has been proposed by recent studies. In the L band the companion is extended, with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) size of $\sim 1$ au, suggesting that the emission comes from a disk around the secondary star. The companion flux is 0.2-0.3 Jy in the L band, and 0.2-0.7 Jy in the N band, accounting for 4-20% of the total emission at those wavelengths. The SED of the companion is compatible with thermal radiation of warm dust (600-800 K).

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the astrophysical properties of a sample of star clusters in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). They have been selected with the aim of looking for the connection between their ages, heliocentric distances and metallicities with the existence of tidally perturbed/induced outermost SMC regions. We derived the star cluster fundamental parameters from relatively deep Survey of the Magellanic Stellar History (SMASH) DR2 color magnitude diagrams, cleaned from field star contamination, and compared to thousand synthetic CMDs covering a wide range of heliocentric distances, ages and metal content. Heliocentric distances for 15 star clusters are derived for the first time, which represents an increase of 50 per cent of SMC clusters with estimated heliocentric distances. The analysis of the age-metallicity relationships (AMRs) of cluster located in outermost regions distributed around the SMC and in the SMC Main Body reveals that they have followed the overall galaxy chemical enrichment history. However, since half of the studied clusters are placed in front of or behind the SMC Main Body, we concluded that they formed in the SMC and have traveled outward because of the tidal effects from the interaction with the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Furthermore, metal rich clusters formed recently in some of these outermost regions from gas that was also dragged by tidal effects from the inner SMC. This outcome leads to consider the SMC as a galaxy scarred by the LMC tidal interaction with distance-perturbed and newly induced outermost stellar substructures.

 - **Abstract**
 The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is a fundamental observational tool in modern cosmology. The linear polarization of the CMB provides a crucial observational tool for exploring new physics, including the inflationary paradigm and parity-violating phenomena. The spectral distortion of the CMB can be used as a probe of the intracluster medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters (GCs) and to infer cosmological parameters. However, precise measurements are limited by foreground contamination and instrumental systematics. This work examines the non-thermal energy budget in GCs with the non-thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (ntSZ) effect. Using $Planck$ all-sky maps, we measure the ntSZ effect in GCs hosting radio halos, enabling constraints on the volume-averaged magnetic field strength within the ICM. We further assess how observations from upcoming ground-based CMB experiments improve these constraints. The imprints of parity-violating physics on the polarization of the CMB are predicted theoretically and recently, several methods have been used to measure the effect of cosmic birefringence from $Planck$ and $WMAP$ data. The miscalibration of polarization-sensitive detectors is found to be one of the limiting factors in this endeavour. We perform a relative and an absolute polarization angle calibration of the $Planck$ detectors using microwave and X-ray observations of the Crab nebula. Additionally, we develop a simulation pipeline to generate time-ordered data for an upcoming ground-based sub-mm telescope, analyzing the impact of correlated detector and atmospheric noise on CMB map reconstruction. Our findings in this thesis emphasize the importance of broad-frequency coverage for better foreground characterization and highlight the need for dedicated ground-based calibration to achieve accurate CMB polarization measurements.

 - **Abstract**
 Although protostars and disks are often studied separately owing to numerical and observational challenges, breakthroughs in recent years have highlighted the need to study both objects in concert. The role of magnetic fields in this regard must be investigated. We aim to describe the birth of the protostar and that of its disk, as well as their early joint evolution following the second collapse. We wish to study the structure of the nascent star-disk system, while focusing on the innermost sub-AU region. We carry out high resolution 3D RMHD simulations, describing the collapse of dense cloud cores to stellar densities. The calculations reach $\approx 2.3$ yr after protostellar birth. Our simulations are also compared to their hydro counterpart to better isolate the role of magnetic fields. When accounting for ambipolar diffusion, the efficiency of magnetic braking is drastically reduced and the nascent protostar reaches breakup velocity, thus forming a rotationally supported disk. The diffusion of the magnetic field also allows for the implantation of a $\sim \mathrm{kG}$ field in the protostar, which is thereafter maintained. The magnetic field is mainly toroidal in the star-disk system, although a notable vertical component threads it. We also show that the nascent disk is prone to the MRI, although our resolution is inadequate to capture the mechanism. We note a sensitivity of the disk's properties with regards to the angular momentum inherited prior to the second collapse, as well as the magnetic field strength. These calculations carry multiple implications on several issues in stellar formation theory, and offer perspectives for future modeling of the system. Should the fossil field hypothesis to explain the origins of magnetic fields in young stellar objects hold, we show that a $\sim \mathrm{kG}$ field strength may be implanted and maintained in the protostar at birth.

 - **Abstract**
 Mid-infrared (MIR) emission from tidal disruption events (TDEs) is a powerful probe of the circumnuclear environment around dormant supermassive black holes. This emission arises from the reprocessing of intrinsic emission into thermal MIR emission by circumnuclear dust. While the majority of optical- and X-ray-selected TDEs show only weak dust echoes consistent with primarily unobscured sight lines, there have been growing efforts aimed at finding TDEs in obscured environments using MIR selection methods. In this work, we present the first JWST observations of 4 MIR-selected TDEs with JWST Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) Medium-Resolution Spectrometer (MRS). Two of these sources show flares in other wavelength bands (one in optical, one in X-ray), while the other two are MIR-only transients. None of these TDEs showed pre-outburst nuclear activity, but all of the MIRI/MRS observations reveal emission lines associated with highly ionized gas, implying ionization from TDE accretion. Additionally, all four sources show silicate emission features around 10 and 18 $\mu$m that are much stronger than the features seen in active galactic nuclei (AGN). We suggest that the emitting dust is optically thin to its own emission and show that the MIR spectrum is consistent with emission from optically thin dust along an isodelay surface. All four sources show an excess at short wavelengths ($\lambda < 8\, \mu$m), which could arise from a late-time plateau in the intrinsic flare, akin to what is seen in late-time UV observations of unobscured TDEs, although self-consistent dust modeling is required to fully assess the strength of this late-time plateau.

 We measure surface brightness fluctuations in Chandra X-ray images of the cores of the galaxy clusters Abell 2029, Abell 2151, Abell 2107, RBS0533, and RBS0540. Their relatively structureless X-ray atmospheres exhibit the thermodynamic properties of cool cores including short central cooling times and low entropy. However, unlike typical cool-core clusters, molecular gas, star formation, and bubbles associated with radio jets are faint or absent near their central galaxies. Four clusters show typical gas density fluctuation amplitudes of $\sim$ 10 per cent on the scales probed, apart from RBS0540, which exhibits lower amplitudes, suggesting that its gas is mildly disturbed. Under the assumption that gas density fluctuations are indicative of random gas velocities, we estimate scale-dependent velocity amplitudes of gas motions across all studied clusters, which range from 100 km/s to 200 km/s in Abell 2029, Abell 2151, and Abell 2107. These velocity estimates are comparable to the atmospheric velocity dispersion in the Perseus cluster measured by the Hitomi X-ray Observatory. The turbulent heating rates implied by our measurements are of the same order as the radiative cooling rates. Our results suggest that atmospheric sloshing and perhaps turbulent motion may aid radio jets in stabilizing atmospheric cooling.
#### JWST Spectroscopic View of a Rapidly Growing Dust-obscured Quasar at $z \sim 4$: Effect of Dust Extinction Correction on Black Hole Mass and Eddington Ratio Estimation

 - **Abstract**
 In the merger-driven galaxy evolution scenario, the central supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in dust obscured galaxies grow rapidly. Interestingly, a recent work \citep{suh24} on a dust-obscured galaxy, LID-568 at $z=3.965$, has shown that its SMBH is growing extremely fast at about 40 times of the Eddington-limited accretion rate (i.e., super-Eddington accretion). However, the heavy dust extinction of the host galaxy could affect the result if not corrected properly. Here, we analyze James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRSpec/IFU and MIRI spectra of LID-568. By measuring its bolometric luminosity ($L_{\rm bol}$) and BH mass ($M_{\rm BH}$) using an extinction-free estimator based on mid-infrared spectra, we obtain $L_{\rm bol} = 10^{46.83\pm0.07}\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$ and $M_{\rm BH} = 10^{8.43\pm0.15}\,M_{\odot}$. The measured Eddington ratio ($\lambda_{\rm Edd}$) is 1.97$\pm$0.88, consistent with the accretion rate at the Eddington limit; in other words, not in super-Eddington in a significant manner. This result underscores challenges and the importance of carefully considering dust extinction when analyzing the BH growth in dust-obscured quasars.
