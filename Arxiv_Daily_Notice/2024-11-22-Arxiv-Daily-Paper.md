 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed study of the large-scale shock front in Stephan's Quintet, a byproduct of past and ongoing interactions. Using integral-field spectroscopy from the new William Herschel Telescope Enhanced Area Velocity Explorer (WEAVE), recent 144 MHz observations from the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS), and archival data from the Very Large Array and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), we obtain new measurements of key shock properties and determine its impact on the system. Harnessing the WEAVE large integral field unit's (LIFU) field of view (90 $\times$ 78 arcsec$^{2}$), spectral resolution ($R\sim2500$) and continuous wavelength coverage across the optical band, we perform robust emission line modeling and dynamically locate the shock within the multi-phase intergalactic medium (IGM) with higher precision than previously possible. The shocking of the cold gas phase is hypersonic, and comparisons with shock models show that it can readily account for the observed emission line ratios. In contrast, we demonstrate that the shock is relatively weak in the hot plasma visible in X-rays (with Mach number of $\mathcal{M} \sim 2 - 4$), making it inefficient at producing the relativistic particles needed to explain the observed synchrotron emission. Instead, we propose that it has led to an adiabatic compression of the medium, which has increased the radio luminosity ten-fold. Comparison of the Balmer line-derived extinction map with the molecular gas and hot dust observed with JWST suggests that pre-existing dust may have survived the collision, allowing the condensation of H$_{2}$ - a key channel for dissipating the shock energy.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of five galaxy candidates at redshifts between $15.9<z<18.6$ in JWST observations from the GLIMPSE survey. These robust sources were identified using a combination of Lyman-break selection and photometric redshift estimates. The ultra-deep NIRCam imaging from GLIMPSE, combined with the strong gravitational lensing of the Abell S1063 galaxy cluster, allows us to probe an intrinsically fainter population (down to $M_{\rm UV}=-17.5$ mag) than previously achievable. These galaxies have absolute magnitudes ranging from $M_{\rm UV}= -17.7$ to $-18.0$ mag, with UV continuum slopes between $\beta \simeq -2.3$ and $\beta \simeq -3.0$, consistent with young, dust-free stellar populations. The number density of these objects, log$_{\rm 10}$ ($\phi$/[Mpc$^{-3}$ mag$^{-1}$])=$-3.43^{+0.28}_{-0.64}$ at $M_{\rm UV}=-18$ is in clear tension with pre-JWST theoretical predictions, extending the over-abundance of galaxies from $z\sim10$ to $z\sim 18.6$. These results, together with the scarcity of brighter galaxies in other public surveys, suggest a steep decline in the bright-end of the UV luminosity function at $z \sim 17$, implying efficient star formation and possibly a close connection to the halo mass function at these redshifts. Testing a variety of star formation histories suggests that these sources are plausible progenitors of the unusually UV-bright galaxies that JWST now routinely uncovers at $z = 10-14$. Overall, our results indicate that the luminosity distribution of the earliest star-forming galaxies could be shifting towards fainter luminosities, implying that future surveys of cosmic dawn will need to explore this faint luminosity regime.

 - **Abstract**
 CHANCES, the CHileAN Cluster galaxy Evolution Survey, will study the evolution of galaxies in and around ${\sim}$150 massive galaxy clusters, from the local universe out to z=0.45. CHANCES will use the new 4MOST Spectroscopic Survey Facility on the VISTA 4m telescope to obtain spectra for ${\sim}$500,000 galaxies with magnitudes $r_\mathrm{AB} < 20.5$, providing comprehensive spectroscopic coverage of each cluster out to $5r_{200}$. Its wide and deep scope will trace massive and dwarf galaxies from the surrounding filaments and groups to the cores of galaxy clusters, enabling the study of galaxy pre-processing and the role of the evolving environment on galaxy evolution. In this paper we present and characterize the sample of clusters and superclusters to be targeted by CHANCES. We used literature catalogues based on X-ray emission and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect to define the cluster sample in a homogeneous way, with attention to cluster mass and redshift, as well as the availability of ancillary data. We calibrated literature mass estimates from various surveys against each other and provide an initial mass estimate for each cluster, which we used to define the radial extent of the 4MOST coverage. We also present an initial assessment of the structure surrounding these clusters based on the redMaPPer red-sequence algorithm as a preview of some of the science CHANCES will enable.

 - **Abstract**
 We expand the theoretical framework by Gottlieb el al. (2023), which connects binary merger populations with long and short binary gamma-ray bursts (lbGRBs and sbGRBs), incorporating kilonovae as a key diagnostic tool. We show that lbGRBs, powered by massive accretion disks around black holes (BHs), should be accompanied by bright, red kilonovae. In contrast, sbGRBs - if also powered by BHs - would produce fainter, red kilonovae, potentially biasing against their detection. However, magnetized hypermassive neutron star (HMNS) remnants that precede BH formation can produce jets with power ($P_{\rm NS} \approx 10^{51}\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$) and Lorentz factor ($\Gamma>10$), likely compatible with sbGRB observations, and would result in distinctly bluer kilonovae, offering a pathway to identifying the sbGRB central engine. Recent modeling by Rastinejad et al. (2024) found luminous red kilonovae consistently accompany lbGRBs, supporting lbGRB originating from BH-massive disk systems, likely following a short-lived HMNS phase. The preferential association of sbGRBs with comparably luminous kilonovae argues against the BH engine hypothesis for sbGRBs, while the bluer hue of these KNe provides additional support for an HMNS-driven mechanism. Within this framework, BH-NS mergers likely contribute exclusively to the lbGRB population with red kilonovae. Our findings suggest that GW170817 may, in fact, have been an lbGRB to on-axis observers. Finally, we discuss major challenges faced by alternative lbGRB progenitor models, such as white dwarf-NS or white dwarf-BH mergers and accretion-induced collapse forming magnetars, which fail to align with observed GRB timescales, energies, and kilonova properties.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) are enigmatic sources first discovered in the 1980s in external galaxies. They are characterized by their extraordinarily high X-ray luminosity, which often exceeds $10^{40}\, \rm{erg \; s^{-1}}$. Our study aims to obtain more information about pulsating ULXs (PULXs), first of all, their viewing geometry, since it affects almost all the observables, such as the flux, the pulsed fraction, the polarization degree (PD), and polarization angle (PA). We present a simplified model, which primarily describes the thermal emission from an accreting, highly magnetized neutron star, simulating the contributions of an accretion disk and an accretion envelope surrounding the star magnetosphere, both described by a multicolor blackbody. Numerical calculations are used to determine the flux, PD, and PA of the emitted radiation, considering various viewing geometries. The model predictions are then compared to the observed spectra of two PULXs, M51 ULX-7 and NGC 7793 P13. We identified the best fitting geometries for these sources, obtaining values of the pulsed fraction and the temperature at the inner radius of the disk compatible with those obtained from previous works. We also found that measuring the polarization observables can give considerable additional information on the source.

 - **Abstract**
 We present radial profiles of luminosity-weighted age, $age_L$, and $\Delta \Sigma_{SFR}$ for various populations of high- and low- mass central and satellite galaxies in the TNG100 cosmological simulation. Using these profiles, we investigate the impact of intrinsic and environmental factors on the radial distribution of star formation. For both central galaxies and satellites, we investigate the effects of black hole mass, cumulative AGN feedback energy, morphology, halo mass, and local galaxy overdensity on the profiles. In addition, we investigate the dependence of radial profiles of the satellite galaxies as a function of the redshifts at which they joined their hosts, as well as the net change in star-forming gas mass since the satellites joined their host. We find that high-mass ($M_*>10^{10.5} M_{\odot}$) central and satellite galaxies show evidence of inside-out quenching driven by AGN feedback. Effects from environmental processes only become apparent in averaged profiles at extreme halo masses and local overdensities. We find that the dominant quenching process for low-mass galaxies ($M_*<10^{10} M_{\odot}$) is environmental, generally occurring at low halo mass and high local galaxy overdensity for low-mass central galaxies and at high host halo masses for low-mass satellite galaxies. Overall, we find that environmental processes generally drive quenching from the outside-in.

 - **Abstract**
 With GW170817 being the only multimessenger gravitational wave (GW) event with an associated kilonova (KN) detected so far, there exists a pressing need for realistic estimation of the GW localization uncertainties and rates, as well as optimization of available telescope time to enable the detection of new KNe. For this purpose, we simulate GW events assuming a data-driven, GW-motivated distribution of binary parameters for the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (LVK) fourth and fifth observing runs (O4 and O5). For our particular case of estimating KN detection rates in the O4 and O5 runs, we map the binary neutron star (BNS) and neutron star-black hole (NSBH) properties to the optical light curves arising from r-process nucleosynthesis in the ejecta. We use the simulated population of KNe to generate follow-up observing plans, with the primary goal of optimizing detection with the Gravitational Wave Multi-Messenger Astronomy DECam Survey (GW-MMADS). We explore KN detectability as a function of mass, distance, and spin of the binaries. Out of the mergers that produce a KN in our simulations, we expect detectable KNe for DECam-like instruments at a per-year rate of: $1-16$ ($0-1$) for BNS (NSBH) in O4, and $16-165$ ($1-12$) for BNS (NSBH) in O5, using a fiducial exposure time and conditional on the uncertainty on the equation of state (EOS) and volumetric rates of the mergers. Taking into account observability constraints, our scheduler covers the location of the KN $\sim 30-38\%$ of the times for our fiducial EOS. We provide the depths needed to detect a significant fraction of our simulated mergers for the astronomical community to use in their follow-up campaigns.

 - **Abstract**
 Studying the distribution and properties of ionised gas in outflows driven by AGN is crucial for understanding the feedback mechanisms at play in extragalactic environments. In this study, we explore the connection between ionised outflows traced by rest-frame UV absorption and optical emission lines in GS133, a Compton thick AGN at z = 3.47. We combine observations from the JWST NIRSpec Integral Field Spectrograph (IFS) with archival VLT VIMOS long-slit spectroscopic data, as part of the GA-NIFS project. We perform a multi-component kinematic decomposition of the UV and optical line profiles to derive the physical properties of the absorbing and emitting gas in GS133. Our kinematic decomposition reveals two distinct components in the optical lines. The first component likely traces a rotating disk with a dynamical mass of 2e10 Msun. The second component corresponds to a galaxy-wide, bi-conical outflow, with a velocity of 1000 km/s and an extension of 3 kpc. The UV absorption lines show two outflow components, with bulk velocities v_out = -900 km/s and -1900 km/s, respectively. This characterises GS133 as a mini-BAL system. Balmer absorption lines with similar velocities are tentatively detected in the NIRSpec spectrum. Both photoionisation models and outflow energetics suggest that the ejected absorbing gas is located at 1-10 kpc from the AGN. We use 3D gas kinematic modelling to infer the orientation of the [O III] bi-conical outflow, and find that a portion of the emitting gas resides along our line of sight, suggesting that [O III] and absorbing gas clouds are partially mixed in the outflow. The derived mass-loading factor (i.e. the mass outflow rate divided by the SFR) of 1-10, and the kinetic coupling efficiency (i.e. the kinetic power divided by LAGN) of 0.1-1% per cent suggest that the outflow in GS133 provides significant feedback on galactic scales.
#### Revisiting Constraints on Resonant Axion-Photon Conversions from CMB Spectral Distortions

 - **Abstract**
 Axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) remain highly motivated extensions to the standard model due to their ability to address open questions such as the relic abundance of dark matter and the strong CP problem. Axions are also capable of undergoing a resonant mixing with photons when the masses of the two fields are roughly equal, producing a wide array of phenomenological consequences. Here, we revisit constraints coming from conversions of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) into axions, which will induce a distortion to the frequency spectrum of the background photons. We introduce a more detailed description for the modeling of the plasma mass of the photon, showcasing how the inclusion of Helium recombination can alter the conversion probability for photons in the Wien tail. Our results include an updated analytic framework, which allows us to define the precise spectral shape of the axion distortion, as well as a numeric component which utilized the code \texttt{CosmoTherm} to fully characterize the distortion, providing a slight increase in the constraining power over the analytics. We also treat for the first time the large-distortion regime for resonant axion-photon conversions. Under the assumption of large-scale primordial magnetic fields near the limit obtained from CMB observations, we find that spectral distortions can probe previously unexplored regions of the axion parameter space.
#### The Decline and Fall of ROME. V. A Preliminary Search for Star-Disrupted Planet Interactions and Coronal Activity at 5 GHz Among White Dwarfs within 25 pc

 - **Abstract**
 The recent discovery of planetesimals orbiting white dwarfs has renewed interest in the final chapters of the evolution of planetary systems. Although observational and theoretical studies have examined the dynamical evolution of these systems, studies of their magnetic star-planet interactions, as powered by unipolar induction, have thus far only been assessed theoretically. This fifth paper of the ROME (Radio Observations of Magnetized Exoplanets) series presents the results of a targeted mini-survey of nine white dwarfs within 25 pc without known stellar mass companions in search of radio emissions generated by magnetic interactions between white dwarfs and their planetary remnants. This $\sim$5 GHz Arecibo radio telescope survey achieved mJy-level sensitivity over $<$1 s integration times. Although no exoplanet-induced stellar radio flares were detected, this is the first survey to search for magnetic star-planet interactions between white dwarfs and planetary companions, cores, or disrupted planetesimals. It is also the most extensive and sensitive radio survey for intrinsic coronal emissions from apparently isolated white dwarfs. The study of radio emissions from white dwarf systems may present a new means to detect and measure DC and DQ magnetic fields, search for white dwarf coronae, characterize the density and spatial distribution of white dwarf magnetospheric plasma, characterize the dynamical and electrical properties of planetary cores, and offer new constraints on the modeling of double degenerate merger events.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: The connection between quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) and magnetic fields has been investigated across various celestial bodies. Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) waves have been employed to explain the simultaneous upper and lower kilohertz (kHz) QPOs. Nevertheless, the intricate and undefined formation pathways of twin kHz QPOs present a compelling avenue for exploration. This area of study holds great interest as it provides an opportunity to derive crucial parameters related to compact stars. Aims:We strives to develop a self-consistent model elucidating the radiation mechanism of twin kHz QPOs, subsequently comparing it with observations. Methods: A sample of 28 twin kHz QPOs observed from the X-ray binary 4U 1636--53 are used to compare with the results of the MCMC calculations according to our model of the radiation mechanism of twin kHz QPOs, which is related to twin MHD waves. Results: We obtain twenty-eight groups of parameters of 4U 1636--53 and a tight exponential fit between the flux and the temperature of seed photons to Compton up-scattering and find that the electron temperature in the corona around the neutron star decreases with the increasing temperature of the seed photons. Conclusions: The origin of twin kHz QPOs can be attributed to dual disturbances arising from twin MHD waves generated at the innermost radius of an accretion disc. The seed photons can be transported through a high temperature corona and Compton up-scattered. The variability of the photons with the frequencies of twin MHD waves can lead to the observed twin kHz QPOs.
#### Constraints on primordial black holes from the observed number of Icarus-like ultrahigh magnification events

 - **Abstract**
 Icarus is an individual star observed near the macro-critical curve of the MACS J1149 cluster, with the magnification factor estimated to be an order of thousands. Since microlenses near the macro-critical curve influence the number of such high-magnification events, the observed occurrence of Icarus-like events is expected to provide a useful constraint on the properties of microlenses. We first study the mass and mass fraction of microlenses consistent with the observed number of events assuming a single microlens component with a monochromatic mass function, finding that stars that contribute to the intracluster light (ICL) are consistent at the 95% confidence level. We then consider the contribution of primordial black holes (PBHs), which are one of the alternatives to the standard cold dark matter, as microlenses in addition to ICL stars. The derived parameter space indicates that a large abundance of PBHs with a mass around $1\ M_{\odot}$ and a fraction of PBHs to the total dark matter of $f_{\rm PBH} \gtrsim 0.2$ cannot explain the observed number of Icarus-like events and therefore is excluded. The methodology developed in this paper can be used to place tighter constraints on the fraction of PBHs from ongoing and future observations of ultrahigh magnification events.

 - **Abstract**
 New emerging flux (NEF) has long been considered a mechanism for solar eruptions, but detailed process remains an open question. In this work, we explore how NEF drives a coronal magnetic configuration to erupt. This configuration is created by two magnetic sources of strengths $M$ and $S$ embedded in the photosphere, one electric-current-carrying flux rope (FR) floating in the corona, and an electric current induced on the photospheric surface by the FR. The source $M$ is fixed accounting for the initial background field, and $S$ changes playing the role of NEF. We introduce the channel function $C$ to forecast the overall evolutionary behavior of the configuration. Location, polarity, and strength of NEF governs the evolutionary behavior of FR before eruption. In the case of $|S/M|<1$ with reconnection occur between new and old fields, the configuration in equilibrium evolves to the critical state, invoking the catastrophe. In this case, if polarities of the new and old fields are opposite, reconnection occurs as NEF is close to FR; and if polarities are the same, reconnection happens as NEF appears far from FR. With different combinations of the relative polarity and the location, the evolutionary behavior of the system gets complex, and the catastrophe may not occur. If $|S/M|>1$ and the two fields have opposite polarity, the catastrophe always takes place; but if the polarities are the same, catastrophe occurs only as NEF is located far from FR; otherwise, the evolution ends up either with failed eruption or without catastrophe at all.
#### Nonlinear internal waves breaking in stellar radiation zones. Parametrisation for the transport of angular momentum: bridging geophysical to stellar fluid dynamics

 - **Abstract**
 Internal gravity waves (hereafter IGWs) are one of the mechanisms that can play a key role to redistribute efficiently angular momentum in stars along their evolution. The study of IGWs is thus of major importance since space-based asteroseismology reveals a transport of angular momentum in stars, which is stronger by two orders of magnitude than the one predicted by stellar models ignoring their action or those of magnetic fields. IGWs trigger angular momentum transport when they are damped by heat or viscous diffusion, when they meet a critical layer or when they break. Theoretical prescriptions have been derived for the transport of angular momentum induced by IGWs because of their radiative and viscous dampings and of the critical layers they encounter along their propagation. However, none has been proposed for the transport triggered by their nonlinear breaking. In this work, we aim to derive such a physical and robust prescription, which can be implemented in stellar structure and evolution codes. We adapt an analytical saturation model, which has been developed for IGWs nonlinear convective breaking in the Earth atmosphere and has been successfully compared to in-situ measurements in the stratosphere, to the case of deep spherical stellar interiors. In a first step, we neglect the modification of IGWs by the Coriolis acceleration and the Lorentz force, which are discussed and taken into account in a second step. We derive a complete semi-analytical prescription for the transport of angular momentum by IGWs, which takes into account both their radiative damping and their potential nonlinear breaking because of their convective and vertical shear instabilities. This allows us to bring the physical prescription for the interactions between IGWs and the differential rotation to the same level of realism that the one used in global circulation models for the atmosphere.
#### Learning the Universe: Cosmological and Astrophysical Parameter Inference with Galaxy Luminosity Functions and Colours

 - **Abstract**
 We perform the first direct cosmological and astrophysical parameter inference from the combination of galaxy luminosity functions and colours using a simulation based inference approach. Using the Synthesizer code we simulate the dust attenuated ultraviolet--near infrared stellar emission from galaxies in thousands of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations from the CAMELS suite, including the Swift-EAGLE, Illustris-TNG, Simba & Astrid galaxy formation models. For each galaxy we calculate the rest-frame luminosity in a number of photometric bands, including the SDSS $\textit{ugriz}$ and GALEX FUV & NUV filters; this dataset represents the largest catalogue of synthetic photometry based on hydrodynamic galaxy formation simulations produced to date, totalling >200 million sources. From these we compile luminosity functions and colour distributions, and find clear dependencies on both cosmology and feedback. We then perform simulation based (likelihood-free) inference using these distributions, and obtain constraints on both cosmological and astrophysical parameters. Both colour distributions and luminosity functions provide complementary information on certain parameters when performing inference. Most interestingly we achieve constraints on $\sigma_8$, describing the clustering of matter. This is attributable to the fact that the photometry encodes the star formation--metal enrichment history of each galaxy; galaxies in a universe with a higher $\sigma_8$ tend to form earlier and have higher metallicities, which leads to redder colours. We find that a model trained on one galaxy formation simulation generalises poorly when applied to another, and attribute this to differences in the subgrid prescriptions, and lack of flexibility in our emission modelling.

 - **Abstract**
 The afterglow of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) has been extensively discussed in the context of shocks generated during an interaction of relativistic outflows with their ambient medium. This process leads to the formation of both a forward and a reverse shock. While the emission from the forward shock, observed off-axis, has been well-studied as a potential electromagnetic counterpart to a gravitational wave-detected merger, the contribution of the reverse shock is commonly overlooked. In this paper, we investigate the contribution of the reverse shock to the GRB afterglows observed off-axis. In our analysis, we consider jets with different angular profiles, including two-component jets, power-law structured jets, Gaussian jets and 'mixed jets' featuring a Poynting-flux-dominated core surrounded by a baryonic wing. We apply our model to GRB 170817A/GW170817 and employ the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to obtain model parameters. Our findings suggest that the reverse shock emission can significantly contribute to the early afterglow. In addition, our calculations indicate that the light curves observable in future off-axis GRBs may exhibit either double peaks or a single peak with a prominent feature, depending on the jet structure, viewing angle and micro-physics shock parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate calculations of starspot spectra are essential for multiple applications in astronomy. The current standard is to represent starspot spectra by spectra of stars that are cooler than the quiet star regions. This implies approximating a starspot as a non-magnetic 1D structure in radiative-convective equilibrium, parametrizing convective energy transport by mixing length theory. It is the inhibition of convection by the starspot magnetic field that is emulated by using a lower spot temperature relative to the quiet stellar regions. Here, we take a different approach avoiding the approximate treatment of convection and instead self-consistently accounting for the interaction between matter, radiation, and the magnetic field. We simulate spots on G2V, K0V, M0V stars with the 3D radiative magnetohydrodynamics code MURaM and calculate spectra ($R \approx 500$ from 250~nm to 6000~nm) using ray-by-ray radiative transfer with the MPS-ATLAS code. We find that the 1D models fail to return accurate umbral and penumbral spectra on K0V and M0V stars where convective and radiative transfer of energy is simultaneously important over a broad range of atmospheric heights rendering mixing length theory inaccurate. However, 1D models work well for G2V stars, where both radiation and convection significantly contribute to energy transfer only in a narrow region near the stellar surface. Quantitatively, the 1D approximation leads to errors longward of 500 nm of about 50\% for both umbral and penumbral flux contrast relative to quiet star regions on M0V stars, and less than 2\% (for umbrae) and 10\% (for penumbrae) for G2V stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive stars lead the ionization and mechanical feedback within young star-forming regions. The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is an ideal galaxy for studying individual massive stars and quantifying their feedback contribution to the environment. We analyze eight exemplary targets in LMC N11 B from the Hubble UV Legacy Library of Young Stars as Essential Standards (ULLYSES) program, using novel spectra from HST (COS and STIS) in the UV, and from VLT (X-shooter) in the optical. We model the spectra of early to late O-type stars by using state-of-the-art PoWR atmosphere models. We determine the stellar and wind parameters (e.g., $T_\star$, $\log g$, $L_{\star}$, $\dot{M}$, $v_\infty$) of the analyzed objects, chemical abundances (C, N, O), ionizing and mechanical feedback ($Q_\mathrm{H}$, $Q_\mathrm{He{\small{I}}}$, $Q_\mathrm{He{\small{II}}}$, $L_\mathrm{mec}$) and X-rays. We report ages of $2-4.5$ Myr and masses of $30-60$ $M_\odot$ for the analyzed stars in N11 B, consistent with a scenario of sequential star formation. We note that the observed wind-momentum luminosity relation is consistent with theoretical predictions. We detect nitrogen enrichment in most of the stars, up to a factor of seven. However, we do not find a correlation between nitrogen enrichment and projected rotational velocity. Finally, based on their spectral type, we estimate the total ionizing photons injected from the O-type stars in N11 B into its environment. We report $\log$ ($\sum$ $Q_\mathrm{H}$)$=50.5$ ph s$^{-1}$, $\log$ ($\sum$ $Q_\mathrm{He{\small{I}}}$)$=49.6$ ph s$^{-1}$ and $\log$ ($\sum$ $Q_\mathrm{He{\small{II}}}$)$=44.4$ ph s$^{-1}$, consistent with the total ionizing budget in N11.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves, playing a crucial role in transporting energy through the solar atmosphere, manifest in various chromospheric structures. Here, we investigated MHD waves in a long-lasting dark fibril using high-temporal-resolution (2~s cadence) Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations in Band 6 (centered at 1.25~mm). We detected oscillations in brightness temperature, horizontal displacement, and width at multiple locations along the fibril, with median periods and standard deviations of $240\pm114$~s, $225\pm102$~s, and $272\pm118$~s, respectively. Wavelet analysis revealed a combination of standing and propagating waves, suggesting the presence of both MHD kink and sausage modes. Less dominant than standing waves, oppositely propagating waves exhibit phase speeds (median and standard deviation of distributions) of $74\pm204$~km/s, $52\pm197$~km/s, and $28\pm254$~km/s for the three observables, respectively. This work demonstrates ALMA's capability to effectively sample dynamic fibrillar structures, despite previous doubts, and provides valuable insights into wave dynamics in the upper chromosphere.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate how stellar feedback from the first stars (Population III) distributes metals through the interstellar and intergalactic medium using the star-by-star cosmological hydrodynamics simulation, Aeos. We find that energy injected from the supernovae of the first stars is enough to expel a majority of gas and injected metals beyond the virial radius of halos with mass $M_* \lesssim 10^7$ M$_\odot$, regardless of the number of supernovae. This prevents self-enrichment and results in a non-monotonic increase in metallicity at early times. Most minihalos ($M \gtrsim 10^5 \, \rm M_\odot$) do not retain significant fractions of the yields produced within their virial radii until they have grown to halo masses of $M \gtrsim 10^7 \, \rm M_\odot$. The loss of metals to regions well beyond the virial radius delays the onset of enriched star formation and extends the period that Population III star formation can persist. We also explore the contributions of different nucleosynthetic channels to 10 individual elements. On the timescale of the simulation (lowest redshift $z=14.3$), enrichment is dominated by core-collapse supernovae for all elements, but with a significant contribution from asymptotic giant branch winds to the s-process elements, which are normally thought to only be important at late times. In this work, we establish important mechanisms for early chemical enrichment which allows us to apply Aeos in later epochs to trace the evolution of enrichment during the complete transition from Population III to Population II stars.

 - **Abstract**
 We perform the first dedicated comparison of five hadronic codes (AM$^3$, ATHE$\nu$A, B13, LeHa-Paris, and LeHaMoC) that have been extensively used in modeling of the spectral energy distribution (SED) of jetted active galactic nuclei. The purpose of this comparison is to identify the sources of systematic errors (e.g., implementation method of proton-photon interactions) and to quantify the expected dispersion in numerical SED models computed with the five codes. The outputs from the codes are first tested in synchrotron self-Compton scenarios that are the simplest blazar emission models used in the literature. We then compare the injection rates and spectra of secondary particles produced in pure hadronic cases with monoenergetic and power-law protons interacting on black-body and power-law photon fields. We finally compare the photon SEDs and the neutrino spectra for realistic proton-synchrotron and leptohadronic blazar models. We find that the codes are in excellent agreement with respect to the spectral shape of the photons and neutrinos. There is a remaining spread in the overall normalization that we quantify, at its maximum, at the level of $\pm 40\%$. This value should be used as an additional, conservative, systematic uncertainty term when comparing numerical simulations and observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Examining reflected light from exoplanets aids in our understanding of the scattering properties of their atmospheres and will be a primary task of future flagship space- and ground-based telescopes. We introduce an enhanced capability of Planetary Intensity Code for Atmospheric Scattering Observations (PICASO), an open-source radiative transfer model used for exoplanet and brown dwarf atmospheres, to produce reflected light phase curves from three-dimensional atmospheric models. Since PICASO is coupled to the cloud code Virga, we produce phase curves for different cloud condensate species and varying sedimentation efficiencies (fsed) and apply this new functionality to Kepler-7b, a hot Jupiter with phase curve measurements dominated by reflected starlight. We model three different cloud scenarios for Kepler-7b: MgSiO3 clouds only, Mg2SiO4 clouds only, and Mg2SiO4, Al2O3, and TiO2 clouds. All our Virga models reproduce the cloudy region west of the substellar point expected from previous studies, as well as clouds at high latitudes and near the eastern limb, which are primarily composed of magnesium silicates. Al2O3 and TiO2 clouds dominate near the substellar point. We then compare our modeled reflected light phase curves to Kepler observations and find that models with all three cloud condensate species and low sedimentation efficiencies (0.03 - 0.1) match best, though our reflected light phase curves show intensities approximately one-third of those observed by Kepler. We conclude that a better understanding of zonal transport, cloud radiative feedback, and particle scattering properties is needed to further explain the differences between the modeled and observed reflected light fluxes.

 Context. Quasar outflows are key players in the feedback processes that influence the evolution of galaxies and the intergalactic medium. The chemical abundance of these outflows provides crucial insights into their origin and impact. Aims. To determine the absolute abundances of nitrogen and sulfur and the physical conditions of the outflow seen in quasar 3C298. Methods. We analyze archival spectral data from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) for 3C298. We measure Ionic column densities from the absorption troughs and compare the results to photoionization predictions made by the Cloudy code for three different spectral energy distributions (SED), including MF87, UVsoft, and HE0238 SEDs. We also calculate the ionic column densities of excited and ground states of N iii to estimate the electron number density and location of the outflow using the Chianti atomic database. Results. The MF87, UVsoft, and HE0238 SEDs yield nitrogen and sulfur abundances at super-solar, solar, and sub-solar values, respectively, with a spread of 0.4 to 3 times solar. Additionally, we determined an electron number density of log(ne) greater than 3.3 cm-3, with the outflow possibly extending up to a maximum distance of 2.8 kpc. Conclusions. Our results indicate solar metallicity within a 60 percent uncertainty range, driven by variations in the chosen SED and photoionization models. This study underscores the importance of SEDs impact on determining chemical abundances in quasars outflows. These findings highlight the necessity of considering a wider range of possible abundances, spanning from sub solar to super solar values.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the structure, interstellar absorption, color-magnitude diagrams, kinematics, and dynamical state of embedded star clusters in the star-forming region associated with the giant molecular cloud G174+2.5. Our investigation is based on photometric data from the UKIDSS Galactic Plane Survey catalog and astrometric data from the Gaia DR3 catalogs. First, we recover all the known embedded clusters and candidate clusters in the region using surface density maps. Then, for the detected clusters, we determine their general parameters: the center positions, radii, number of stars, and reddening. To evaluate the reddening, we use both the NICEST algorithm and the Q-method. Both methods produce consistent extinction maps in the regions of the four studied clusters. However, the Q-method yields a much smaller color scatter in the CMD. For four clusters in particular (S235~North-West, S235~A-B-C, S235~Central, and S235~East1+East2), we were able to compute individual membership probabilities, the cluster distances, the cluster masses, and their average proper motions. By building on these results, we have studied the clusters' kinematics and dynamics. Moreover, we estimate the mass of the gas component and the star formation efficiency (SFE) in the regions of these four clusters. Finally, we provide an estimate of the total energy of the stellar and gas components in the area of these four clusters to determine whether the clusters are bound (here we consider a `cluster' as the system `stars + gas'). The gravitational bound strongly depends on the region for which we estimate the gas mass. If we consider the mass of the entire cloud, all these four clusters turn out to be bound.

 - **Abstract**
 An established method measuring the hydrogen ionisation fraction in shock excited gas is the BE99 method, which utilises six bright forbidden emission lines of [SII]6716, 6731, [NII]6548, 6583, and [OI]6300, 6363. We aim to extent the BE99 method by including more emission lines in the blue and near-infrared part of the spectrum ($\lambda$ = 3500-11000A), and considering higher hydrogen ionisation fractions ($x_e > 0.3$). In addition, we investigate how a non-equilibrium state of the gas and the presence of extinction influence the BE99 technique. We find that plenty additional emission line ratios can in principle be exploited as extended curves (or stripes) in the ($x_e, T_e$)-diagram. If the BE99 equilibrium is reached and extinction is corrected for, all stripes overlap in one location in the ($x_e, T_e$)-diagram indicating the existing gas parameters. The application to the Par Lup 3-4 outflow shows that the classical BE99 lines together with the [NI]5198+5200 lines do not meet in one locationin the ($x_e, T_e$)-diagram. This indicates that the gas parameters derived from the classical BE99 method are not fully consistent with other observed line ratios. A multi-line approach is necessary to determine the gas parameters. From our analysis we derive $n_e \sim$ 45 000 cm^-3 - 53000 cm^-3 , $T_e$ = 7600K - 8000K, and $x_e \sim$ 0.027 - 0.036 for the Par Lup 3-4 outflow. For the 244-440 Proplyd we were able to use the line ratios of [SII]6716+6731, [OI]6300+6363, and [OII]7320, 7330 in the BE99 diagram to estimate the ionisation fraction at knot E3 ($x_e = 0.58 \pm 0.05$). In conclusion, exploiting new line ratios reveals more insights on the state of the gas. Our analysis indicates, however, that a multi-line approach is more robust in deriving gas parameters, especially for high density gas.

 - **Abstract**
 The molecular gas in the interstellar medium (ISM) of star-forming galaxy populations exhibits diverse physical properties. We investigate the $^{12}$CO excitation of twelve dusty, luminous star-forming galaxies at $z \sim 2-4$ by combining observations of the $^{12}$CO from $J_{\rm up} = 1$ to $J_{\rm up} = 8$. The spectral line energy distribution (SLED) has a similar shape to NGC 253, M82, and local ULIRGs, with much stronger excitation than the Milky Way inner disc. By combining with resolved dust continuum sizes from high-resolution $870$-$\mu$m ALMA observations and dust mass measurements determined from multi-wavelength SED fitting, we measure the relationship between the $^{12}$CO SLED and probable physical drivers of excitation: star-formation efficiency, the average intensity of the radiation field $\langle U\rangle$, and the star-formation rate surface density. The primary driver of high-$J_{\rm up}$ $^{12}$CO excitation in star-forming galaxies is star-formation rate surface density. We use the ratio of the CO($3-2$) and CO($6-5$) line fluxes to infer the CO excitation in each source and find that the average ratios for our sample are elevated compared to observations of low-redshift, less actively star-forming galaxies and agree well with predictions from numerical models that relate the ISM excitation to the star-formation rate surface density. The significant scatter in the line ratios of a factor $\approx 3$ within our sample likely reflects intrinsic variations in the ISM properties which may be caused by other effects on the excitation of the molecular gas, such as cosmic ray ionization rates and mechanical heating through turbulence dissipation.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the large-scale distribution and kinematics of cold molecular gas across the compact galaxy group Stephan's Quintet, based on CO(2-1) observations performed with the Atacama Compact Array (ACA) and CO(1-0) data from the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA). We find coherent structures of molecular gas associated with the galaxies and intra-group medium, which follow the distribution of warm H$_{2}$ previously seen with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). CO is associated with a ridge of shocked gas that crosses the galaxy group, and with a spiral arm of the intruding galaxy NGC7318b, which interacts with the intra-group medium along the ridge. Although the ridge contains widespread shocks, turbulent gas, and warm H$_{2}$, the CO lines are narrower than elsewhere in Stephan's Quintet (FWHM~25-65 km/s), indicative of settled cold gas. At a distinctly different velocity, CO is found in the active galaxy NGC7319 and Northern star-forming region SQ-A. A bridge of turbulent molecular gas connects NGC7319 with the ridge, covering a gap of ~700 km/s between these structures. The gas excitation ranges from $L'_{\rm CO(2-1)}$/$L'_{\rm CO(1-0)}$ ~ 0.3 in the bridge and SQ-A, to ~0.5 along the ridge, to near unity in the center of NGC7319. We also detect either a molecular outflow or turbulent molecular gas associated with the radio source in NGC7319. These ACA data are part of a program with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and JWST to study molecular gas physics from the largest to the smallest scales across the intra-group medium of Stephan's Quintet.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze 99 photometrically selected Little Red Dots (LRDs) at z ~ 4-8 in the GOODS fields, leveraging ultra-deep JADES NIRCam short-wavelength (SW) data. We examine the morphology of 30 LRDs; the remaining 69 are predominantly compact, i.e. are strongly dominated by sources < 400 pc in diameter and lack extended components even in stacked SW band images. Among the LRDs selected for morphological analysis, 50% show at least two distinct, associated sources or galaxy components, while the others appear as single sources with highly asymmetric structures. We find median stellar masses of log10(M*/Msun) = 9.07(-0.08)(+0.11) for pure stellar models with Av ~ 1.16(+0.11)(-0.21) mag, and log10(M*/Msun) = 9.67(+0.17)(-0.27) for models including AGNs, where Av ~ 2.74(+0.55)(-0.71) mag, consistent with recent results showing LRDs tend to have high stellar masses and dust content when fitted with AGN models. NIRSpec spectra are available for 15 sources, 6 of which fall within the morphological analysis sample and show multiple components. Among these 15, broad H-alpha emission is detected in 40%, with full-width half-maximum (FWHM) ranging from 1200 to 2900 km/s. One source exhibits broad H-beta emission with FWHM = 2000 +/- 500 km/s. Analysis of line ratios probing the interstellar medium (ISM) reveals a composite nature, indicating AGN activity combined with stellar processes. These findings suggest LRDs have a mixed nature, with AGN signatures in some cases linked to disturbed morphologies observed at rest-frame UV wavelengths.
