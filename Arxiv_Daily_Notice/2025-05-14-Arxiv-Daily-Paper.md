 - **Abstract**
 We present a new empirical Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) model with three chromatic flux variation templates: one phase dependent and two phase independent. No underlying dust extinction model or patterns of intrinsic variability are assumed. Implemented with Stan and trained using spectrally binned Nearby Supernova Factory spectrophotometry, we examine this model's 2D, phase-independent flux variation space using two motivated basis representations. In both, the first phase-independent template captures variation that appears dust-like, while the second captures a combination of effectively intrinsic variability and second-order dust-like effects. We find that approximately 13% of the modeled phase-independent flux variance is not dust-like. Previous empirical SN Ia models either assume an effective dust extinction recipe in their architecture, or only allow for a single mode of phase-independent variation. The presented results demonstrate such an approach may be insufficient, because it could "leak" noticeable intrinsic variation into phase-independent templates.

 - **Abstract**
 Synergies between JWST and ALMA are unveiling a population of bright, super-early ($z>10$) galaxies, including systems like GS-z14-0 ($z=14.2$) and GHZ2 ($z=12.3$) with extreme FIR line ratios (${\rm [OIII]88\mu m/[CII]158\mu m} > 3$) that challenge galaxy formation models. To clarify this issue, we identify in the SERRA zoom-in simulations a synthetic analogue, Amaryllis, of these sources, and track its evolution from $z=16$ to $z=7$. During this period, Amaryllis grows from $\log(M_\star/M_\odot) \sim 7.4$ to $10.3$, linking super-early progenitors to the massive galaxy population at the end of reionization. At $z=11.5$, Amaryllis closely matches the observed properties of GS-z14-0, including $M_\star$, SFR, and the luminosity of FIR ([OIII]88$\mu$m) and UV (e.g. CIII]$1908$) lines. We find that high [OIII]/[CII] ratios appear during short, merger-driven starburst episodes, when low metallicity ($Z \sim 0.02\,Z_\odot$) and high ionization conditions ($U_{\rm ion} \sim 0.1$) push the ISM far from equilibrium. These extreme FIR line ratios are thus transient and linked to major mergers that ignite strong ionized gas outflows. Despite such a dynamically violent environment, strikingly, Amaryllis develops a dynamically cold gaseous disk ($V/\sigma \sim 4-6$) as early as $z \sim 11$, while its stellar component remains dispersion-dominated down to $z\sim7$. The co-existence of ordered rotation and merger-driven disturbances in $z>10$ galaxies can explain the tentative disk signatures in GS-z14-0.

 - **Abstract**
 Heavy chemical elements such as iron in the intra-cluster medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters are a signpost of the interaction between the gas and stellar components. Observations of the ICM metallicity in present-day massive systems, however, pose a challenge to the underlying assumption that the cluster galaxies have produced the amount of iron that enriches the ICM. We evaluate the iron share between ICM and stars within simulated galaxy clusters with the twofold aim of investigating the origin of possible differences with respect to observational findings and of shedding light on the observed excess of iron on the ICM with respect to expectations based on the observed stellar population. We evaluated the iron mass in gas and stars in a sample of 448 simulated systems with masses M500 > 1e14 Msun at z=0.07. These were extracted from the high-resolution (352 cMpc/h)^3 volume of the Magneticum cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. We compared our results with observational data of low-redshift galaxy clusters. The iron share in simulated clusters features a shallow dependence on the total mass, and its value is close to unity on average. In the most massive simulated systems, the iron share is thus smaller than observational values by almost an order of magnitude. The dominant contribution to this difference is related to the stellar component, whereas the chemical properties of the ICM agree well overall with the observations. We find larger stellar mass fractions in simulated massive clusters, which in turn yield higher stellar iron masses, than in observational data. Consistently with the modelling, we confirm that the stellar content within simulated present-day massive systems causes the metal enrichment in the ICM. It will be crucial to alleviate the stellar mass discrepancy between simulations and observations to definitely assess the iron budget in galaxy clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 Very massive stars (VMSs, $M_{\star}$ $\geq$ 100 M$_{\odot}$) play a crucial role in several astrophysical processes. At low metallicity, they might collapse directly into black holes, or end their lives as pair-instability supernovae. Recent observational results set an upper limit of $0.7\,{}\mathrm{ yr}^{-1} \,{}\mathrm{ Gpc}^{-3}$ on the rate density of pair-instability supernovae in the nearby Universe. However, most theoretical models predict rates exceeding this limit. Here, we compute new VMS tracks with the MESA code, and use them to analyze the evolution of the (pulsational) pair-instability supernova rate density across cosmic time. We show that stellar wind models accounting for the transition between optically thin and thick winds yield a pair-instability supernova rate $\mathcal{R}_{\mathrm{PISN}}\sim{}0.1$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ at redshift $z\sim{}0$, about two orders of magnitude lower than our previous models. We find that the main contribution to the pair-instability supernova rate comes from stars with metallicity $Z\sim{}0.001-0.002$. Stars with higher metallicities cannot enter the pair-instability supernova regime, even if their zero-age main sequence mass is up to 500 M$_\odot$. The main reason is that VMSs enter the regime for optically thick winds during the main sequence at metallicity as low as $Z\sim{4}\times{}10^{-4}$. This enhances the mass loss rate, quenching the growth of the He core and thus preventing the onset of pair-instability in later evolutionary stages. This result highlights the critical role of mass loss in shaping the final fate of very massive stars and the rate of pair-instability supernovae.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the serendipitous discovery of an absorption feature at 4.8 keV in the NuSTAR spectra of ESP 39607, a Seyfert 2 galaxy at $z = 0.201$, observed in May 2023 and August 2024. The feature is detected in both observations with individual significance levels between 2 and 3$\sigma$, computed with multiple statistical methods. The combined probability of detecting it in both observations is $\gtrsim$4$\sigma$. The absorption feature is consistent with an ultra-fast inflow (UFI) potentially associated with Fe XXV or Fe XXVI K$\alpha$ transitions. The inferred inflow velocity is $\sim$0.15-0.20$c$, with an estimated launching radius of 22-89 $R_g$, depending on the assumed iron transition and whether radiation pressure is accounted for. Photoionization modeling associates the UFI primarily with Fe XXV K$\alpha$ absorption, blended with a minor contribution from Fe XXVI K$\alpha$. Alternative explanations, including associations with the warm-hot intergalactic medium or outflows of lighter elements, were investigated but found unlikely. If confirmed, this detection represents a rare example of a UFI, providing valuable evidence into extreme and/or non-standard accretion processes near supermassive black holes. Follow-up observations with higher-resolution X-ray spectroscopy, such as with XMM-Newton or XRISM, will be essential to confirm the nature of this feature and better constrain the physical mechanisms driving it.

 - **Abstract**
 The embedded phase is a crucial period in the development of a young star. Mid-IR observations, now possible with JWST with unprecedented sensitivity, spectral resolution and sharpness are key for probing many physical and chemical processes on sub-arcsecond scales. JOYS addresses a wide variety of questions, from protostellar accretion and the nature of primeval jets, winds and outflows, to the chemistry of gas and ice, and the characteristics of embedded disks. We introduce the program and show representative results. MIRI-MRS data of 17 low-mass and 6 high-mass protostars show a wide variety of features. Atomic line maps differ among refractory (e.g., Fe), semi-refractory (e.g., S) and volatile elements (e.g., Ne), linked to their different levels of depletion and local (shock) conditions. Nested, stratified jet structures consisting of an inner ionized core seen in [Fe II] with an outer H2 layer are commonly seen. Wide-angle winds are found in low-J H2 lines. [S I] follows the jet in the youngest protostars, but is concentrated on source when more evolved. [Ne II] reveals a mix of jet shock and photoionized emission. H I lines measure accretion, but are also associated with jets. Molecular emission (CO2, C2H2, HCN, H2O, ..) is cool compared with disks, and likely associated with hot cores. Deep ice absorption features reveal not just the major ice components but also ions (as part of salts) and complex organic molecules, with comparable abundances from low- to high-mass sources. A second detection of HDO ice in a solar-mass source is presented with HDO/H2O ~ 0.4%, providing a link with disks and comets. A deep search for solid O2 suggests it is not a significant oxygen reservoir. Only few embedded Class I disks show the same forest of water lines as Class II disks do, perhaps due to significant dust extinction of the upper layers [abridged].

 - **Abstract**
 The nearby B-type star $\rho$ Oph A was recently identified as a rapidly rotating magnetic B-type star with variable radio and X-ray emission consistent with a magnetospheric origin. We present a high-resolution spectropolarimetric time series obtained with ESPaDOnS, which we use to perform a magnetic analysis using least-squares deconvolution (LSD). We find that $\rho$ Oph A is a spectroscopic binary consisting of two B-type stars with masses of about 8 and 10 $M_\odot$ on a slightly eccentric 88-day orbit, with the magnetic field being associated with the smaller Ab component. This leads to $\rho$ Oph Ab's 4 kG surface magnetic dipole being approximately twice as strong as the previously reported 2 kG. The oblique rotator model derived from the longitudinal magnetic field curve agrees well with the LSD Stokes $V$ profiles, indicating that the magnetic field is likely to be very nearly dipolar. The orbital and rotational axes appear to be aligned. We report for the first time $\rho$ Oph Ab's magnetospheric H$\alpha$ emission, which is consistent with an origin in a centrifugal magnetosphere. We also demonstrate that $\rho$ Oph Ab's light curve can be recovered from the previously reported {\em Kepler-2} light curve of $\rho$ Oph C, and that it demonstrates prominent magnetospheric eclipses similar to those of $\sigma$ Ori E, and which can be reproduced using a dipolar Rigidly Rotating Magnetosphere model. Both H$\alpha$ and the light curve are indicative of a strongly asymmetric magnetosphere. All indications are that $\rho$ Oph Ab's magnetic field is essentially dipolar, meaning that contributions from higher-order multipoles probably cannot explain the strong asymmetry in the magnetosphere. Only two other stars show comparable degrees of asymmetry, both of which are also close binaries, suggesting that binarity can affect the magnetospheric plasma distributions.

 - **Abstract**
 Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are some of the most powerful objects in the Universe. For this reason, they can be observed up to high redshifts (z), giving valuable insights into the evolution of our Universe. However, high-z AGN are too distant to be spatially resolved with current or upcoming X-ray facilities. In this paper we show how we can exploit gravitationally lensed AGN to significantly increase spatial resolution even at high-z. We combine astrometric data from Gaia DR3 with imaging from the Chandra X-ray Observatory of the quadruply-lensed quasar HE 0435--1223 to measure for the first time possible offsets between the optical and the X-ray emissions. We measure the X-ray source position for HE 0435-1223 within a 1$\sigma$ quasi-elliptical region of 0.5 x 1.3 milli-arcsecond (mas), about 150 pc$^2$ at the redshift of the source (z=1.689). We find evidence for the X-ray emission being offset by a projected 3 mas from the Gaia (optical) emission. The positional offset is most likely associated to a portion of the X-ray emission arising from an X-ray jet or outflow. We also discuss how this method can be used to indicate the presence of a binary/offset AGN system.

 - **Abstract**
 NASA's TESS mission has identified at least 158,000 oscillating red giants, increasing the known sample by roughly an order of magnitude. After validating that these measurements are reliable to 5% for up to 90% of red giants (Theodoridis & Tayar 2023), we make custom stellar evolution models using MESA in order to estimate ages for ~132,794 of these stars to an average uncertainty of 23%. We show that these ages follow similar distributions to those observed in other samples such as Kepler with small differences likely resulting in the galactic volume probed. We provide these ages to the community to enable future galactic archaeology analyses.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations from the Juno spacecraft show that Jupiter has a large dilute core rather than a compact core. To investigate the effects of different core structures on wave propagation and transmission in Jupiter's interior, we consider three models: (1) an isentropic sphere, (2) an isentropic envelope with a rigid core, and (3) an isentropic envelope with a dilute core. We study the propagation and transmission of p modes (sound waves), g modes (gravity waves), r modes (inertial waves), and GIWs (gravito-inertial waves) by solving the linear equations of a compressible, self-gravitating, uniformly rotating polytropic model, fully taking into account the the effects of Coriolis force but neglecting centrifugal flattening. Our results show that energy flux is primarily carried by fast waves with higher frequencies whereas kinetic energy by slow waves with lower frequencies. Rotation has a greater effect on non-axisymmetric modes than on axisymmetric ones. In model 2, rigid core facilitates propagation of r modes. In model 3, rotation enhances the transmission of GIWs across the interface between the dilute core and the isentropic envelope, particularly at high latitudes. This suggests that Jupiter's internal structure may be inferred by detecting the oscillation signals in its polar regions.

 - **Abstract**
 The Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) offers powerful new capabilities for studying the polarised and magnetised Universe at radio wavelengths. In this paper, we introduce the Polarisation Sky Survey of the Universe's Magnetism (POSSUM), a groundbreaking survey with three primary objectives: (1) to create a comprehensive Faraday rotation measure (RM) grid of up to one million compact extragalactic sources across the southern ~50 per cent of the sky (20,630 deg$^2$); (2) to map the intrinsic polarisation and RM properties of a wide range of discrete extragalactic and Galactic objects over the same area; and (3) to contribute interferometric data with excellent surface brightness sensitivity, which can be combined with single-dish data to study the diffuse Galactic interstellar medium. Observations for the full POSSUM survey commenced in May 2023 and are expected to conclude by mid-2028. POSSUM will achieve an RM grid density of around 30-50 RMs per square degree with a median measurement uncertainty of ~1 rad m$^{-2}$. The survey operates primarily over a frequency range of 800-1088 MHz, with an angular resolution of 20'' and a typical RMS sensitivity in Stokes $Q$ or $U$ of 18 $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$. Additionally, the survey will be supplemented by similar observations covering 1296-1440 MHz over 38 per cent of the sky. POSSUM will enable the discovery and detailed investigation of magnetised phenomena in a wide range of cosmic environments, as well as the interplay between these components. This paper reviews the current science case developed by the POSSUM Collaboration and provides an overview of POSSUM's observations, data processing, outputs, and its complementarity with other radio and multi-wavelength surveys, including future work with the SKA.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding turbulence within the Intracluster Medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters is pivotal for comprehending their evolution and dynamics. Employing 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of galaxy cluster mergers, we examine the statistical properties of gas density, magnetic fields, and velocity, particularly emphasizing the central regions spanning 400 kpc. The simulations feature varied initial plasma $\beta$ values (100, 200, and 500), mirroring conditions in massive cool-core clusters such as Perseus. Our findings indicate that while the statistical histogram distributions of gas density and velocity appear similar across different $\beta$ scenarios, their spatial distributions and morphological patterns exhibit noticeable differences. Through the application of the second-order structure function, we identified a scaling relation in velocity fluctuations, characterized by a slope of 1/2 and predominantly dominated by solenoidal components. Furthermore, our analysis reveals a pronounced anisotropy in both velocity and magnetic field fluctuations, with more significant fluctuations along the direction perpendicular to the magnetic fields. This anisotropy is scale-dependent, becoming more pronounced at smaller scales, and exhibits a decreasing trend in scenarios where the magnetic field is relatively weak, particularly at $\beta=500$. This suggests that the anisotropic nature of these fluctuations is predominantly regulated by the magnetic fields. Additionally, we test the efficacy of the Synchrotron Intensity Gradient (SIG) method for tracing magnetic fields in these environments. The SIG shows a global agreement with the magnetic field across all three $\beta$ scenarios, confirming the SIG's insensitivity to the medium's magnetization level.

 We estimated spin, inclination angle and corresponding SMBH mass values for sample of extremely distant (6 < z < 7.5) ultraluminous quasars. The estimated spin values are on average greater that 0.9 and the spin distribution has a characteristic appearance, similar to ones obtained for other types of AGNs and quasars. The dependence of estimated parameters on each other shows strong correlations between them, from which we can assume that in this early quasars the growth of SMBHs mass should occur mainly due to disk accretion with high accretion rate, which very effectively increases the spin.

 - **Abstract**
 The 11-yr cycle of sunspots undergo amplitude modulation over longer timescales. As a part of this long-term modulation in solar activity, the decennial rhythm occasionally breaks, with quiescent phases with very few sunspots observed over multiple decades. These episodes are termed as solar grand minima. Observation of solar magnetic activity proxies complemented by solar dynamo simulations suggests that the large-scale solar polar fields become very weak during this minima phases with a temporary halt in the polar field reversal. Eventually, with the accumulation of sufficient polar fluxes, the polarity reversal and regular cyclic activity is thought to resume, Using multi-millennial dynamo simulations with stochastic forcing, we quantify the polar flux threshold necessary to recover global solar polarity reversal and surmount grand minima phases. We find that the duration of a grand minimum is independent of the onset rate and does not affect the recovery rate. Our results suggest a method to forecast the Sun's recovery from a grand minima phase. However, based on our approach, we could not identify specific precursors that signal entry in to a grand minima phase -- implying that predicting the onset of grand minima remains an outstanding challenge.

 - **Abstract**
 IRAS 15398-3359, a Class 0 protostar in Lupus I star forming region, is associated with three generations of outflows. The primary outflow, i.e., the most recent one, shows internal structure named ``shell structure'' in the near infrared emission map. The shell structure is also seen in the emission lines of CO, H$_2$CO, and others species. We find a similar structure in an underexpanded jet produced in aerodynamics and other engineering applications. A high pressure gas ejected through a nozzle expands to form a supersonic flow. When the pressure of the ejected gas becomes lower than that of the ambient gas, the jet is compressed to form a shock wave. The shock heated gas expands again to form substructures along the jet. We examine the similarity between the primary outflow of IRAS 15398-3359 and industrial underexpanded jet and the possibility that the shell structure of the former is due to repeated expansion and compression in the direction perpendicular to the jet propagation.

 - **Abstract**
 A common origin for a host of stellar phenomena in galactic centres is the tidal encounter between stellar binaries and a massive black hole (MBH), known as the ``Hills mechanism''. Following the encounter, binaries may disrupt into an ejected star and a captured one, they may merge, or survive to either fly away or come back for one or more subsequent encounters, until they are either disrupted or fly away. In this paper, we analyse how a binary's fate depends on its orbital parameters, by following its evolution through up to three subsequent pericentre passages. We choose an initial population of circular binaries on parabolic orbits. We present results from our restricted three-body formalism, whose strength lies in the ability to easily explore a multidimensional parameter space and make predictions independent of the binary physical properties. We find that fates depend strongly on orbital inclination, how deep the encounter is into the MBH tidal sphere and on the binary eccentricity, developed during encounters. Generally, non retrograde trajectories, high eccentricities or deep encounters produce disruptions preferentially. Disruption is the most common fate. A significant fraction of the surviving binaries fly away at velocities typically two orders of magnitude smaller than those of ejected stars. Multiple encounters boost disruptions by 20\% or more. Finally, using an example system, we investigate the effect of finite stellar sizes and lifetimes, showing that mergers occur 31\% of the time, and that disruptions are still boosted by 10\% through subsequent passages.

 - **Abstract**
 Hydrodynamic simulations of protoplanetary discs with planets typically assume that the disc is viscously driven, even though magnetic disc winds are now considered the primary driver of angular momentum transport through the disc. Magnetic disc winds are typically left out of hydrodynamic simulations because they require a magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) treatment and an entire 3D domain, both of which are computationally expensive. Some studies have attempted to incorporate disc winds into disc-planet simulations without full MHD by adding a torque to mimic the effects of a disc wind. However, these studies predate any explicit 3D MHD simulations of planets in the presence of a disc wind. In light of recent MHD studies of disc winds beginning to include a planet, we develop a new disc wind prescription based on these studies and test its efficacy. With three main components, namely (i) excess torque in the planetary gap region, (ii) an MHD-based radial profile for the background torque, and (iii) a moderate level of viscosity, we find that we can essentially reproduce planetary gap profiles for planets above the thermal mass. With lower-mass planets, however, we find it more difficult to reproduce their gap structure. Lastly, we explore the planet's migration path and find that the planet rapidly migrates inwards due to the excess torque in the gap.
#### Modelling the multi-wavelength emission and polarisation signatures of the novel white-dwarf pulsar system AR Sco

 - **Abstract**
 The reclassification of AR Scorpii (AR Sco) from a delta Scuti variable star to a white dwarf binary system has initiated an in-depth exploration of this novel system. The main aim of this work was to develop a general emission code to concurrently model the emission maps, light curves, and spectra at various orbital phases for AR Sco. For the development of the emission code, I solved the general equations of motion with included classical radiation reaction forces (RRF) by implementing the Dormand-Prince 8(7) numerical integrator with adaptive time-step methods. This yielded improved accuracy and computational time vs. the commonly used Vay symplectic integrator, particularly for the high $B$-fields, $E_{\perp}$-fields, and RRF needed for pulsar and pulsar-like magnetospheres. Additionally, I demonstrated the novel result of the particles entering and conforming to the radiation reaction limit regime of Aristotelian Electrodynamics. As calibration for the radiation calculations, emission maps, and spectra I compared my model output with results from the code of the pulsar emission model of Harding and collaborators for a pulsar with $10\%$ the $B$-field strength of Vela and how my results converged to theirs. Next, I showed my exploratory modelling of the magnetic mirror scenario proposed for AR Sco. I demonstrate I could fit the observational spectral energy distribution including the recent \textit{NICER} pulsed X-ray spectrum well, constraining the white dwarf $B$-field to $B_{\rm S} = (2.5 - 3.0) \times 10^{8} \, \rm{G}$. Finally, I showed the effect the $B$-field, $E_{\perp}$-field, initial pitch angle, and initial particle Lorentz factor have on the mirror points, RRF, emission maps, and spectra. This demonstrates how crucial it is to include the general particle dynamics to accurately model the micro-physics present in magnetic mirror models.
#### Modeling the Light Curve and Spectra of SN 2023aew

 We propose that the delayed conversion of a neutron star (NS) into either a quark star (QS) or a hybrid star (HS), occurring approximately 105-109 days after the supernova (SN) explosion, injects ~ 2e49 erg of thermal energy into the expanded SN ejecta. This energy, delivered over ~ 40 days via a quark-nova (QN) shock or the spin-down power of the HS, can reproduce the photometric and spectral features observed in SN 2023aew. In this model, the first light curve peak corresponds to the 56Ni-powered SN resulting from a stripped-envelope progenitor with a zero-age main sequence mass of at least ~ (15-16)M_sun. The plateau between the two peaks may result from interaction between the SN ejecta and circumstellar material (CSM). Alternatively, it could be explained by the spin-down power of the NS prior to its conversion into a highly magnetized HS, which is responsible for powering the second bump. A scenario involving two phases of spin-down power - first from the NS and later from the HS - is compelling and supports the hypothesis that some magnetars are, in fact, HSs. These HSs acquire their ultra-strong magnetic fields through a quark matter phase capable of sustaining core fields on the order of ~ 1e18 G. In our model, the spin-down energy of the HS powers the QN ejecta - the outermost layers of the NS - before this energy is transferred to the expanded SN ejecta. This process produces luminous fast blue optical transients (LFBOTs). The model establishes a potential connection between superluminous SNe (SLSNe) and LFBOTs, with significant implications for high-energy astrophysics and the r-process nucleosynthesis of heavy elements. Potential consequences for Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) are also discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a quadratic lensing estimator that incorporates off-diagonal correlations in both temperature and polarization CMB maps, and is capable of measuring localized lensing profiles with $<10''$ average deflection angle at the $\sim3\sigma$ level in upcoming Simons observatory (SO) data. The proposed pipeline is agnostic to the underlying mass profile and can probe the subtle signatures of voids, clusters, and topological defects. As a case study and test scenario we focus on a collapsing cosmic texture, a topological defect that has been proposed to explain the CMB Cold Spot. With the forthcoming SO data, we forecast a $2.8\sigma$ detection if the texture amplitude reaches the current Planck 2018 $2\sigma$ limit, and a $1.8\sigma$ measurement for the best-fit value, which is remarkable given the expected typical lensing angle of $<6''$. As the next-generation CMB surveys will reach $\ell>3000$ for polarization, we demonstrate that its inclusion is significant, boosting the estimator's signal-to-noise ratio by $\sim50\%$, and making it a powerful tool, allowing us to recover faint lensing footprints that were previously inaccessible.

 Five Venus missions are under development to study the planet in the next decade, with both NASA's VERITAS and ESA's EnVision featuring a geophysical investigation among their objectives. Their radar and gravity experiments will determine Venus's orientation, enabling spin dynamics analyses to infer geophysical and atmospheric properties. This work aims to characterize Venus's polar motion -- the motion of its spin axis in a body-fixed frame-focusing on signatures from its interior and atmosphere to support its potential detection by future orbiters. We develop a polar motion model for a triaxial planet accounting for solar torque, centrifugal and tidal deformations of a viscoelastic mantle, and atmospheric dynamics. Core-mantle coupling effects are analyzed separately considering a simplified spherical core. We compute the period and damping time of the free motion -- called the Chandler wobble -- and determine the frequencies and amplitudes of the forced motion. We revisit the Chandler frequency expression. Solar torque is the dominant phenomenon affecting Venus's Chandler frequency, increasing it by a factor of 2.75. Our model predicts a Chandler period in the range [12900 ; 18900] years. The Chandler wobble appears as a linear polar drift of about 90 meters on Venus's surface during EnVision's 4-year primary mission, at the limit of its resolution. We also predict forced polar motion oscillations with an amplitude of about 20 meters, driven by the atmosphere and the solar torque. Compared to the 240-meter spin axis precession occurring in inertial space over this duration, these results suggest that Venus's polar motion could also be detectable by future orbiters. It should be incorporated into rotation models when anticipating these missions, providing additional constraints on Venus's interior structure.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast X-ray transients (FXRTs) are short-lived X-ray outbursts with diverse progenitor scenarios, including compact object mergers, stellar core-collapses and tidal disruption events. The Einstein Probe (EP) has enabled the rapid discovery and follow-up of dozens of FXRTs, revealing that while some of them overlap with traditional gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), a larger fraction of FXRTs have no associated gamma-ray counterpart down to deep limits. The origin of these gamma-ray dark FXRTs and their connection to the diverse landscape of stellar explosions remains an open question, which can be tackled through the study of their multi-wavelength counterparts and environment. In this paper, we present long-term radio observations of the gamma-ray dark EP241021a, which exhibits sustained radio emission for over 100 days, placing it among the longest-lived radio afterglows. We detect signature of interstellar scintillation in early epochs, allowing us to constrain the angular size and Lorentz factor of the emitting region. Our observations point to an outflow that is at least mildly relativistic with Lorentz factor > 4. Afterglow modeling favors a moderately relativistic and collimated outflow interacting with a low-density interstellar medium. The derived beaming-corrected kinetic energy and low radiative efficiency are consistent with a standard relativistic explosion which did not produce bright gamma-rays. Alternatively, a highly-relativistic structured jet remains consistent with our observations if seen substantially off-axis. In the latter case, the initial X-ray flare detected by EP would be caused by the slower ejecta from the lateral wings intercepting our line of sight rather than by traditional prompt-emission mechanisms within the jet core.
