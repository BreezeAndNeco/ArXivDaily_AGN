#### Systematic Effects of Chaotic Magnetic Fields on Neutron Star Tidal Deformability: Implications for Gravitational Wave Constraints on Dense Matter

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the effects of strong magnetic fields on the equation of state (EoS) of neutron star matter and the resulting implications for tidal deformability measurements in binary neutron star (BNS) mergers. A critical issue with previous magnetized neutron star studies is the treatment of magnetic field anisotropy in the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations. To address this fundamental problem, we employ the chaotic magnetic field approximation, which allows for a self-consistent treatment of magnetic pressure while maintaining isotropy. Using a relativistic mean field approach with properly implemented magnetic field corrections, we compute mass-radius relations and tidal deformability parameters for neutron stars with magnetic field strengths ranging from $10^{15}$ to $10^{16}$ G. Our systematic study reveals that magnetic fields induce increases in both stellar radii (0.8--2.3\%) and tidal deformabilities (4.2--18.1\%) compared to field-free cases, with effects scaling approximately as $B^{1/2}$. These modifications, while modest, are potentially detectable with current and next-generation gravitational wave detectors. For a canonical $1.4\,M_\odot$ neutron star, the tidal deformability increases from $\Lambda_{1.4} = 678 \times 10^6$ in the absence of magnetic fields to $\Lambda_{1.4} = 803 \times 10^6$ for $B = 10^{16}$ G. We demonstrate that magnetic field effects must be considered when constraining the neutron star equation of state using gravitational wave observations, particularly for populations including highly magnetized neutron stars. Our results suggest that the current GW170817 constraint on tidal deformability may require systematic corrections when accounting for magnetic field effects. We provide scaling relations for magnetic field corrections and discuss the implications for population studies of neutron star mergers with next-generation detectors.

 - **Abstract**
 The role of interactions and mergers in the rapid quenching of massive galaxies in the early Universe remains uncertain, largely due to the difficulty of directly linking mergers to quenching. Collisional ring galaxies provide a unique opportunity, as their morphology allows precise dating of the interaction, which can then be compared to quenching timescales inferred from star formation histories. We study a gravitationally bound system at $z=1.61$ in the UDS field, composed of a Host galaxy ($M_\star = 10^{11.4} M_\odot$) with a collisional ring and an X-ray AGN, and the Bullet galaxy ($M_\star = 10^{11.2} M_\odot$), located at a projected distance of $\sim 8$ kpc. Combining JWST and HST imaging with Keck/MOSFIRE spectroscopy, we find compelling evidence for an ongoing starburst in the Host concurrent with rapid quenching in the Bullet. The ring, $\sim 20$ kpc in diameter, is expanding at $127^{+72}_{-29}$ km s$^{-1}$, implying the galaxies first collided 47--96 Myr ago. This timeline is consistent with the Host's current starburst and the Bullet's sudden quenching, strongly suggesting both phenomena were triggered by the interaction. Crucially, the Bullet shows no evidence of a preceding starburst, ruling out rapid gas consumption as the primary quenching channel. Instead, we suggest that merger-driven processes -- such as enhanced turbulence and disk instabilities -- may have suppressed star formation. An additional possibility, which we term the ``Dragon Effect,'' is that AGN-driven outflows from the Host disrupted the Bullet's low-density molecular gas, thereby preventing efficient star formation and accelerating quenching.

 - **Abstract**
 For nearly a decade, observations have shown that many older Sun-like stars spin faster than predicted, a phenomenon known as weakened magnetic braking (WMB). The leading hypothesis for WMB is a weakening of the large-scale dipole field, which leads to a less efficient angular momentum loss. To test this hypothesis on a star known to be in the WMB regime, we present the first Zeeman Doppler Imaging (ZDI) map of the Sun-like star $\tau$Ceti, reconstructed using spectropolarimetric data from the Canada-France-Hawai'i Telescope (CFHT). Our ZDI analysis reveals a remarkably simple, stable and weak ($\langle B\rangle =0.17 \mathrm{G}$) magnetic field, characterized by a predominantly dipolar ($\sim92\%$ magnetic energy contained in $l=1$ modes), and highly axisymmetric ($\sim88\%$ magnetic energy contained in $m<l/2$ modes) morphology. We infer a dipole field strength of $B_{\mathrm{dip}}=0.31 \mathrm{G}$, nearly an order of magnitude weaker than standard braking model predictions, providing direct confirmation of the weakened large-scale dipole predicted by the WMB hypothesis. This work establishes a new benchmark for ZDI, demonstrating that even extremely quiet stars in the WMB regime are accessible to this technique.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the X-shaped radio galaxies (XRGs) with optical double-peaked narrow emission (DPNEL) as potential hosts of dual or binary supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Using a sample of 187 XRGs selected from SDSS and DESI optical spectroscopic surveys, we check the AGN nature of both emission components using the BPT diagnostics of multiple emission lines, namely {[O III]$\lambda\lambda$4959,5007}, H$\alpha$, {[N II]$\lambda\lambda$6548,6584}, {[S II]$\lambda\lambda$6716,6731}, and H$\beta$, and mid-infrared colors. We find that the detection rate of [O III] DPNEL features in XRGs is 30% compared to just 1% in the general galaxy population (mostly radio quiet). The dual AGN fraction in DPNEL galaxies is found to depend strongly on the radio luminosity, increasing from $\sim$25% for radio-undetected to $\sim$58% in the radio-detected sample of general DPNEL galaxies. In contrast, the DPNEL XRGs and FR-II radio galaxies having higher radio power show a $\sim$95% likelihood of hosting a dual AGN. Secondly, the detection of companion galaxies in more than 30% of DPNEL XRGs suggests a vital role of mergers in the XRG formation. We also investigate the parsec-scale radio structure of the nuclei of several XRGs using Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) maps at 1.4 GHz, 4.3 GHz or 7.6 GHz and find a resolved core for only one of the XRGs. However, the flat spectral indices of the VLBA cores along with the DPNEL components exhibiting AGN characteristics, together with the detection of radio-optical offsets between the VLBA and Gaia position, are strongly indicative of XRGs being likely candidates for hosting dual/binary AGNs.

 - **Abstract**
 We present 32 new spectroscopic-binary orbits from our extended radial-velocity (RV) survey of the old ($6.4 \pm 0.2$ Gyr) open cluster NGC 188. Using data from the WIYN Open Cluster Study (WOCS) and APOGEE-2, this work nearly doubles the temporal baseline of the previous RV study of NGC 188. We obtain orbital solutions within a stellar sample that spans a magnitude range of $10.8 \leq \mathrm{G} \leq 16.5 \; (0.9\mbox{-}1.2 \; {M_\odot})$. With revised membership determinations using Gaia DR3 proper-motions and parallaxes, we reassess the cluster binary frequency and period-eccentricity distribution, finding an incompleteness-corrected binary frequency of $33.1 \% \pm 3.8\%$ for periods less than $10^4$ days. We also find a tidal-circularization period of $14.4^{+0.14}_{-0.11}$ days. We find evidence that giants are deficient in short-period orbits, and suggest that the missing giants may have undergone mass transfer and in part formed the population of blue straggler stars and blue lurkers. Among the binaries of note, we highlight WOCS 3953 and WOCS 4945, long-period candidate mass-transfer systems that exhibit possible UV excess.

 - **Abstract**
 Spatially resolved stellar populations of massive, quiescent galaxies at cosmic noon provide powerful insights into star-formation quenching and stellar mass assembly mechanisms. Previous photometric work has revealed that the cores of these galaxies are redder than their outskirts. However, spectroscopy is needed to break the age-metallicity degeneracy and uncover the driver of these colour gradients. Here, we derive age and elemental abundance gradients for 8 distant ($1.2 \lesssim z \lesssim 2.2$), massive ($10.3\lesssim\log({\rm M}_*/{\rm M}_\odot)\lesssim 11.1$), quiescent galaxies, by fitting full-spectrum models to ultra-deep NIRSpec-MSA spectroscopy from the JWST-SUSPENSE survey. We find that these galaxies have negative age, positive [Mg/H] and [Mg/Fe], and flat [Fe/H] gradients, implying that galaxy cores are older and Mg-deficient compared to galaxy outskirts. The age gradients indicate inside-out quenching, while the Mg-deficient cores suggest rapid gas expulsion as the central quenching mechanism. Thus, galaxy cores formed faster and quenched more efficiently than their outskirts. In this scenario, however, our [Fe/H] and [Mg/Fe] gradients are still puzzling. Our results contrast lower-redshift studies, which find flat age and [Mg/Fe] gradients and negative metallicity gradients. Additionally, we find a positive trend between age gradients and rotational support, and marginal trends between gradients and galaxy velocity dispersions and ages. We discuss our findings in the context of galaxy growth scenarios, including minor mergers and progenitor bias, and the possible occurrence of different quenching mechanisms across redshift. With this work, we present the first stellar population gradients from NIRSpec-MSA spectroscopy, in the largest current sample of distant, quiescent galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 MACS J0138-2155 is the only known cluster to strongly lens two supernovae (SNe), Requiem and Encore, from the same host galaxy at z=1.949. We present seven independent mass models of the galaxy cluster built using six software packages. By conducting a blind analysis (no exchanges of results between modeling teams), we quantified uncertainties due to modeling and software. Through HST, JWST and MUSE observations, we assembled high-quality data products, including eight "gold" lensed image systems consisting of 23 images with secure spectroscopic redshifts, and one "silver" system with a likely redshift value. Restricting to the gold images, we obtain overall consistent model predictions of the positions, magnifications and time delays of SN Encore and SN Requiem images, especially for models with $\chi^2 \leq 25$. We predict the appearance of the next images of SNe Encore and Requiem with a time delay of >~3000 days and of ~3700 to 4000 days, respectively, based on a fiducial cosmological model of $H_0 = 70 {\rm\ km\ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}}$ and $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.3$. We obtain relations between $H_0$ and the time delays of SNe Encore and Requiem. In particular, for $H_0 = 73 {\rm\ km\ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}}$, the four lowest $\chi^2$ models predict SN Requiem to reappear in ~Apr-Dec 2026; for $H_0 = 67 {\rm\ km\ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}}$, in ~Mar-Nov 2027. Using the newly measured time delay between the two detected images of SN Encore by Pierel et al. (submitted) and our mass models, we jointly infer $H_0 = {\rm 66.9^{+11.2}_{-8.1}\ km\ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}}$, where the uncertainty is dominated by that of the time delay. The long delays of the next-appearing SN Requiem and SN Encore images provide excellent opportunities to measure $H_0$ with an uncertainty of 2-3%. Our mass models form the basis for cosmological inference from this unique lens cluster with two strongly lensed SNe. (Abridged)

 - **Abstract**
 We present Py2DJPAS, a Python-based tool to automate the analysis of spatially resolved galaxies in the \textbf{miniJPAS} survey, a 1~deg$^2$ precursor of the J-PAS survey, using the same filter system, telescope, and Pathfinder camera. Py2DJPAS streamlines the entire workflow: downloading scientific images and catalogs, performing PSF homogenization, masking, aperture definition, SED fitting, and estimating optical emission line equivalent widths via an artificial neural network. We validate Py2DJPAS on a sample of resolved miniJPAS galaxies, recovering magnitudes in all bands consistent with the catalog ($\sim 10$~\% precision using SExtractor). Local background estimation improves results for faint galaxies and apertures. PSF homogenization enables consistent multi-band photometry in inner apertures, allowing pseudo-spectra generation without artifacts. SED fitting across annular apertures yields residuals $<10$~\%, with no significant wavelength-dependent bias for regions with $S/N>5$. We demonstrate the IFU-like capability of J-PAS by analyzing the spatially resolved properties of galaxy 2470-10239 at $z = 0.078$, comparing them to MaNGA data within 1 half-light radius (HLR). We find excellent agreement in photometric vs. spectroscopic measurements and stellar mass surface density profiles. Our analysis extends to 4 HLR (S/N~$\sim$~5), showing that J-PAS can probe galaxy outskirts, enabling the study of evolutionary processes at large galactocentric distances.

 - **Abstract**
 The formation mechanism of Brown Dwarfs (BDs), whether akin to stars or ejected planetary-mass objects, remains debated. We present the first 3D radiation-MHD simulations of magnetized, turbulent, gravitationally unstable low-mass cores ($0.05-0.1\ \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$) collapsing into proto-BDs. Using the {\ttfamily RAMSES} code with adaptive mesh refinement, we model the full dynamical range ($10^{5}~-10^{22}\ \mathrm{cm^{-3}}$), including radiative transfer (flux limited diffusion) and non-ideal MHD (ambipolar diffusion). Our simulations self-consistently follow the isothermal collapse, first hydrostatic core formation, H$_{2}$ dissociation, and BD birth. The resulting BDs have initial radii $\approx 0.75\ \mathrm{R_{\odot}}$ and masses $\approx 0.8\ \mathrm{M_{Jup}}$, growing via accretion as we follow the early evolution of the object. Crucially, we find that BDs may form similarly to low-mass stars but with a prolonged first-core phase, supporting a star-like formation scenario.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar collisions in dense galactic nuclei might play an important role in fueling supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and shaping their environments. The gas released during these collisions can contribute to SMBH accretion, influencing phenomena such as active galactic nuclei and tidal disruption events of the remnants. We address the challenge of rapidly and accurately predicting the outcomes of stellar collisionsincluding remnant masses and unbound gasacross a broad parameter space of initial conditions. Existing smoothed-particle-hydrodynamic (SPH) simulation techniques, while detailed, are too resource-intensive for exploratory studies or real-time applications. We develop a machine learning framework trained on a dataset of $\sim 16,000$ SPH simulations of main-sequence star collisions. By extracting physically meaningful parameters (e.g., masses, radii, impact parameters, and virial ratios) and employing gradient-boosted regression trees with Huber loss, we create a model that balances accuracy and computational efficiency. The method includes logarithmic transforms to handle dynamic ranges and regularization to ensure physical plausibility. The model achieves predictions of collision outcomes (remnant masses, and unbound mass) with very low mean absolute errors respect to the typical mass scale. It operates in fractions of a second, enabling large-scale parameter studies and real-time applications. Parameter importance analysis reveals that the impact parameter and the relative velocity dominate outcomes, aligning with theoretical expectations. Our approach provides a scalable tool for studying stellar collisions in galactic nuclei. The rapid predictions facilitate investigations into gas supply for SMBH accretion and the cumulative effects of collisions over cosmic time, particularly relevant to address the growth of SMBHs.

 - **Abstract**
 At high metallicity, a majority of massive stars have at least one close stellar companion. The evolution of such binaries is subject to strong interaction processes, heavily impacting the characteristics of their life-ending supernova and compact remnants. For the low-metallicity environments of high-redshift galaxies constraints on the multiplicity properties of massive stars over the separation range leading to binary interaction are crucially missing. Here we show that the presence of massive stars in close binaries is ubiquitous, even at low metallicity. Using the Very Large Telescope, we obtained multi-epoch radial velocity measurements of a representative sample of 139 massive O-type stars across the Small Magellanic Cloud, which has a metal content of about one fifth of the solar value. We find that 45% of them show radial velocity variations which demonstrate that they are members of close binary systems, and predominantly have orbital periods shorter than one year. Correcting for observational biases indicates that at least 70[+11:-6]% of the O stars in our sample are in close binaries, and that at least 68[+7:-8]% of all O stars interact with a companion star during their lifetime. We found no evidence supporting a statistically significant trend of the multiplicity properties with metallicity. Our results indicate that multiplicity and binary interactions govern the evolution of massive stars and determine their cosmic feedback and explosive fates.

 - **Abstract**
 The almost simultaneous detection of GRB170817A and GW170817 ushered in nearly a decade of interest in binary neutron star mergers and their multi-messenger signals, resulting in a greater understanding of the processes that produce short-duration gamma-ray bursts and gravitational waves. However, open questions remain regarding the emission mechanism of these bursts. In this work we present results from the first study of an electromagnetic signal produced from a realistic treatment of a binary neutron star merger, both for on-axis and off-axis observations. We accomplish this by using the PLUTO hydrodynamical code to inject a relativistic jet into the ejecta of a realistic binary neutron star merger, which was itself obtained from the simulation of a 3D BNS merger. Then, we model the prompt photospheric emission that would emerge from this jet using the MCRaT radiative transfer code. We find that the resulting photon spectra can peak around ~1 MeV for on-axis emission and falls off noticeably for off-axis observations. We also find distinctly non-thermal low and high-energy tails in multiple observations, ranging from shallow to mid-off axis observations. Our on-axis results are consistent with the Amati Correlation for short bursts, with some strain evident at higher observing angles. Finally, we find that the radiative efficiency is much lower than seen in previous studies of the photospheric emission of long-duration gamma-ray bursts.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar rotation is a fundamental parameter governing a star's magnetic activity and evolution. The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) provides high-precision photometric data ideal for measuring rotation periods via brightness modulations from starspots. This paper presents a detailed analysis of the star TIC 445493624 using 2-minute cadence data from TESS Sector 58. We process the light curve using a custom pipeline to perform outlier removal, binning, and Savitzky-Golay detrending to isolate the stellar variability. A Lomb-Scargle periodogram of the cleaned data reveals a single, dominant periodic signal at 3.638 days with a power of 0.43, corresponding to a negligible false-alarm probability. The phase-folded light curve at this period is highly coherent and exhibits a stable, non-sinusoidal morphology indicative of large-scale magnetic features or spot groups.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the dynamical structure of cislunar space beyond geosynchronous orbit is critical for both lunar exploration and for high-Earth-orbiting trajectories. In this study, we investigate the role of mean-motion resonances and their associated heteroclinic connections in enabling natural semi-major axis transport in the Earth-Moon system. Working within the planar circular restricted three-body problem, we compute and analyze families of periodic orbits associated with the interior 4:1, 3:1, and 2:1 lunar resonances. These families exhibit a rich bifurcation structure, including transitions between prograde and retrograde branches and connections through collision orbits. We construct stable and unstable manifolds of the unstable resonant orbits using a perigee-based Poincaré map, and identify heteroclinic connections - both between resonant orbits and with lunar $L_1$ libration-point orbits - across a range of Jacobi constant values. Using a new generalized distance metric to quantify the closeness between trajectories, we establish operational times-of-flight for such heteroclinic-type orbit-to-orbit transfers. These connections reveal ballistic, zero-$\Delta v$ pathways that achieve major orbit changes within reasonable times-of-flight, thus defining a network of accessible semi-major axes. Our results provide a new dynamical framework for long-term spacecraft evolution and cislunar mission design, particularly in regimes where lunar gravity strongly perturbs high Earth orbits.

 - **Abstract**
 Pulse profile stability in millisecond pulsars (MSPs) is a key factor in achieving high-precision timing essential for detecting nanohertz gravitational waves with Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs). In this work, we present a systematic analysis of profile stabilization timescales in MSPs using a direct method based on pulse stacking, applied to long-term multi-epoch observations. Our study utilizes data from the upgraded GMRT (uGMRT) between 300--750 MHz for nine MSPs over 3--5 years and Parkes Ultra-Wideband low-frequency receiver observations (Parkes UWL; covering 704--4032 MHz) for three of them. We find that stable profiles typically require averaging over $10^{5}$--$10^{6}$ pulses. This is the first time such a quantitative approach has been applied to MSPs across a wide frequency range, providing an indirect but practical estimate of jitter noise, a dominant noise source in PTA datasets. We observe that stabilization timescales depend on signal-to-noise ratio, pulse morphology, and surface magnetic field strength, with a moderate correlation indicating a possible role of the magnetic field in emission stability. A complementary single-epoch analysis of nine bright MSPs with uGMRT Band-3 (300--500 MHz) reinforces these results and demonstrates the method's applicability to broader MSP populations. We show that a strong correlation exists between profile-stability slope and the jitter parameter, implying that for faint MSPs, profile-stability analysis can act as an effective proxy for intrinsic pulse-shape variability. Our work provides a novel and scalable framework to assess intrinsic profile variability, helping to guide integration time choices and reduce timing noise in PTA experiments.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The radiation field consisting of hydrogen recombination lines and continuum emission might significantly affect the hydrogen-level populations in ultra- and hypercompact (U/HC) H II regions. The escape probability approximation was used to estimate the effect of the radiation field in previous models for calculating hydrogen-level populations. The reliability of this approximation has not been systematically studied, however. Aims. We investigate the appropriate ranges of previous models with the escape probability approximation and without the effects of the radiation field. We create a new model for simulating the integrated characteristics and the spatially resolved diagnostics of the hydrogen recombination lines throughout H II regions. Methods. We developed a new nl model with a full radiative transfer treatment of the radiation field causd by hydrogen recombination lines and continuum emission to calculate the hydrogen-level populations and hydrogen recombination lines. We then compared the level populations and the corresponding hydrogen recombination line intensities simulated by the new model and previous models. Results. We studied the applicability and the valid parameter ranges of previous models. Radiation fields exhibit negligible effects on the level populations in classical and UC H II regions. With the modified escape probability, the model with the escape probability approximation is suitable for most HC H II regions. The improved new model performs better in the HC H II region with an extremely high emission measure. To address the high computational costs inherent in numerical models, we trained a precise machine-learning model to enable a rapid estimation of hydrogen-level populations and the associated hydrogen recombination lines.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a systematic analysis on the X-ray variability in 13 bright quasars at z > 4.5, combining recent Swift observations from 2021 to 2023 and archival multi-epoch observations. Upper limits of the luminosity measurements were included in the analysis by using the Kaplan-Meier estimator method. It is found that the high-z quasars exhibit X-ray variability on both short-term (hours-to-days) and intermediate-term (weeks-to-months) timescales, with short-term variability dominating the overall variation. A linear correlation exists between the global mean ($\mu_{\mathrm{L_{2-10\,keV}}}$) and standard deviation ($\sigma_{\mathrm{L_{2-10\,keV}}}$) of X-ray luminosities, which is independent of the X-ray photon index and optical-to-X-ray spectral slope. The localized stochastic magnetic reconnection mechanism is strongly favored, which can naturally lead to a scale-invariant power-law energy distribution and satisfactorily explain the correlation. The $\sigma$-$\mu$ correlation parallels with the well-documented rms-flux relation of low-z active galactic nuclei (AGNs), implying the magnetic reconnection mechanism could drive short-timescale X-ray variability in both high- and low-z AGNs. The highest-z quasar in our sample, J142952+544717 (z = 6.18), shows a luminosity distribution extending to ${10}^{47}\ \rm{erg\ {s}^{-1}}$ with a not conspicuous median luminosity. On the other hand, J143023+420436 (z = 4.7), which hosts the most relativistic jet among known high-z blazars, is dominated in the high-luminosity regime (${10}^{47}\ \rm{erg\ {s}^{-1}}$ ), making it an ideal target for multi-wavelength follow-up observations. J090630+693030 is found to have a rest-frame period of 182.46 days and J143023+420436 has a period of 16.89 days, both could be explained by the global evolution of plasmoid chains, in which magnetic islands formed during reconnection may merge successively.

 - **Abstract**
 The GeV $\gamma$-ray excess observed towards the Galactic Centre remains unexplained. While dark matter annihilation has long been considered a leading interpretation, an alternative scenario involving a large population of millisecond pulsars has not been ruled out. Testing this hypothesis with electromagnetic observations is difficult, as pulsar searches in the bulge are strongly affected by scattering, high sky temperature, and source confusion. We investigate whether gravitational-wave observations with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) could provide an independent probe of the millisecond pulsar binary population in the Galactic bulge. We construct synthetic populations of millisecond pulsar-white dwarf binaries under two illustrative formation scenarios: an accreted scenario, in which systems are deposited by disrupted globular clusters, and an in situ scenario, in which binaries form through isolated binary evolution. In both cases, only $10^{-5}$--$10^{-4}$ of the underlying bulge population is detectable by LISA. Nevertheless, even a few detections would imply tens to hundreds of thousands of unseen systems. Accreted binaries are expected to have lower chirp masses ($\sim$0.4 M$_\odot$), while in situ binaries produce more massive companions ($\sim$0.9 M$_\odot$). LISA will measure binary frequencies with high precision, but chirp masses can only be determined for the most massive or highest-frequency systems. Distinguishing millisecond pulsar binaries from the far more numerous double white dwarfs will be challenging, though LISA detections could provide valuable targets for follow-up with the Square Kilometre Array, enabling a critical test of the millisecond pulsar origin of the $\gamma$-ray excess.

 - **Abstract**
 The IceCube Neutrino Observatory, situated at the geographic South Pole, comprises both a surface component, IceTop, and a deep in-ice component. This unique setup allows for simultaneous measurements of low-energy ($\sim \rm{GeV}$) and high-energy ($\gtrsim 400\,\rm{GeV}$) muons generated in cosmic-ray air showers. The correlation between these low- and high-energy muons can serve as a valuable tool not only for analyzing cosmic-ray composition but also for tests of hadronic interaction models. However, IceTop does not feature dedicated muon detectors, making it challenging to measure the low-energy muon component for individual air showers. \\ \noindent For this reason, a two-component lateral distribution function is utilized for the simultaneous reconstruction of the primary energy and low-energy muon number on a single-event basis. This is achieved by combining analytical descriptions of the electromagnetic and muon lateral distributions. In this work, the underlying principles of this method will be discussed, as well as its capability for muon number reconstruction using the hadronic interaction models Sibyll 2.1, QGSJet-II.04, and EPOS-LHC.

 - **Abstract**
 The CUbesat Solar Polarimeter (CUSP) project is a CubeSat mission planned for a launch in low-Earth orbit and aimed to measure the linear polarization of solar flares in the hard X-ray band by means of a Compton scattering polarimeter. CUSP will allow us to study the magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration in the flaring magnetic structures of our star. CUSP is a project in the framework of the Alcor Program of the Italian Space Agency aimed at developing new CubeSat missions. It is undergoing a 12-month Phase B that started in December 2024. The Compton polarimeter on board CUSP is composed of two acquisition chains based on plastic scintillators read out by Multi-Anode PhotoMultiplier Tubes for the scatterer part and GAGG crystals coupled to Avalanche PhotoDiodes for the absorbers. An event coincident between the two readout schemes will lead to a measurement of the incoming X-ray's azimuthal scattering angle, linked to the polarization of the solar flare in a statistical manner. The current status of the CUSP mission design, mission analysis, and payload scientific performance will be reported. The latter will be discussed based on preliminary laboratory results obtained in parallel with Geant4 simulations.
#### Long-lived coronal loops in solar active regions

 - **Abstract**
 Coronal loops are plasma structures in the solar atmosphere with temperatures reaching millions of Kelvin, shaped and sustained by the magnetic field. However, their morphology and fundamental nature remain subjects of debate. By studying their cross-sectional properties and how they change along the loop and in time, we can understand their magnetic structure and heating mechanisms. In this study, we investigated the cross-sectional intensity profiles, both spatially and temporally, of two unique coronal loops, observed in the periphery of two distinct active regions by the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI/HRI$_{\rm EUV}$) on board the Solar Orbiter spacecraft. The main results of this study are 1. The lifetimes of these two loops (loop1 > 120 min \& loop2 > 50 min) are longer than the typical timescales of radiative cooling and thermal conduction. 2. Their widths determined by the FWHM of the single Gaussian fit to the cross-axis intensity profiles are greater than 6-7 pixels of EUI/HRI$_{\rm EUV}$, indicating that the loop cross-section is uniformly filled on well-resolvable scales. 3. These loops exhibited an almost constant width, both spatially and temporally (width for loop1 is 2.1 $\pm$ 0.4 Mm and for loop2 is 1.3 $\pm$ 0.2 Mm), indicating that they are stable non-expanding structures. 4. We present observational evidence that the one of the loops (loop2) is not braided, which strongly suggests that the non-expanding nature of this multi-stranded loop along its length cannot be attributed to the twist of the magnetic field lines. In conclusion, we find that these coronal loops are long, stable, multi-stranded, non-expanding structures with a uniform cross-section that persist in the corona for an unusually extended duration. This not only challenges our current understanding of the structure of the coronal magnetic field but also raises critical questions about the mechanisms
#### Dynamic or Systematic? Bayesian model selection between dark energy and supernova biases

 - **Abstract**
 DES-5Y supernovae, combined with DESI BAO, appear to favour Chevallier-Polarski-Linder $(w_0, w_a)$ dynamical dark energy over $\Lambda$CDM. arXiv:2408.07175 suggested that this is driven by a systematic in the DES pipeline, which particularly affects the low-redshift supernovae brought in from legacy surveys. It is difficult to investigate these data in isolation, however, as the complicated supernovae pipelines must properly account for selection effects. In this work, we discover that the Bayesian evidence previously found for flexknot dark energy (arXiv:2503.17342) is beaten by a magnitude offset between the low- and high-redshift supernovae. In addition, we find that the possible tension between DES-5Y and DESI is significantly reduced by such an offset. We also take the opportunity to trial Nested Bridge Sampling with Sequential Monte Carlo as an alternative method for calculating Bayes factors.

 - **Abstract**
 We demonstrate a GPU-accelerated nested sampling framework for efficient high-dimensional Bayesian inference in cosmology. Using JAX-based neural emulators and likelihoods for cosmic microwave background and cosmic shear analyses, our approach provides parameter constraints and direct calculation of Bayesian evidence. In the 39 dimensional $\Lambda$CDM vs $w_0w_a$ shear analysis, we produce Bayes Factors and a robust error bar in just 2 days on a single A100 GPU, without loss of accuracy. Where CPU-based nested sampling can now be outpaced by methods relying on MCMC sampling and decoupled evidence estimation, we demonstrate that with GPU acceleration nested sampling offers the necessary speed-up to put it on equal computational footing with these methods, especially where reliable model comparison is paramount. We put forward both nested and gradient-based sampling as useful tools for the modern cosmologist, where cutting-edge inference pipelines can yield orders of magnitude improvements in computation time.

 - **Abstract**
 The Vera C. Rubin Observatory LSST is expected to discover tens of millions of new Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). The survey's exceptional cadence and sensitivity will enable UV/optical/NIR monitoring of a significant fraction of these objects. The unprecedented number of sources makes spectroscopic follow-up for the vast majority of them unfeasible in the near future, so most studies will have to rely on photometric redshifts estimates which are traditionally much less reliable for AGN than for inactive galaxies. This work presents a novel methodology to constrain the photometric redshift of AGNs that leverages the effects of cosmological time dilation, and of the luminosity and wavelength dependence of AGN variability. Specifically, we assume that the variability can be modeled as a damped random walk (DRW) process, and adopt a parametric model to characterize the DRW timescale ($\tau$) and asymptotic amplitude of the variability (SF$_\infty$) based on the redshift, the rest-frame wavelength, and the AGN luminosity. We construct variability-based photo-$z$ priors by modeling the observed variability using the expected DRW parameters at a given redshift. These variability-based photometric redshift (VAR-PZ) priors are then combined with traditional SED fitting to improve the redshift estimates from SED fitting. Validation is performed using observational data from the SDSS, demonstrating significant reduction in catastrophic outliers by more than 10% in comparison with SED fitting techniques and improvements in redshift precision. The simulated light curves with both SDSS and LSST-like cadences and baselines confirm that, VAR-PZ will be able to constrain the photometric redshifts of SDSS-like AGNs by bringing the outlier fractions down to below 7% from 32% (SED-alone) at the end of the survey.

 - **Abstract**
 Using NIRSpec on JWST, we studied a sample of 15 intermediate-mass (1.8-4.1 Msun) young stellar objects (YSOs) previously identified with MIRI photometry in the low-metallicity NGC 346 star-forming cluster in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). All objects, observed in the 1.7-5.3 micron range, show strong hydrogen recombination lines in the Paschen, Brackett, Pfund, and Humphreys series, confirming their very young ages. The spectra of 11 YSOs show prominent absorption bands from the three most important ice species (H2O, CO2, CO), marking the first detection of these ices in intermediate-mass YSOs beyond our Galaxy. In three YSOs, water ice appears to be in crystalline form. In some objects, we also detect 13CO2 and OCS ices -- never before observed beyond the Milky Way (MW) -- and methanol ice in at least one star. We compared the column densities of H2O, CO2, and CO ices with those measured in more and less massive protostars in the MW and Large Magellanic Cloud, finding that in NGC 346 ice column densities reach values nearly an order of magnitude lower than in more massive objects (~1x10^{17} cm-2 for water and ~1x10^{16} cm-2 for CO2 and CO). However, the relative proportions of the ice species abundances do not differ from those in massive MW YSOs. This suggests that metallicity may not significantly affect ice chemistry in protoplanetary discs and that, shielded by the protostellar envelope or deep in the midplane, circumstellar material is likely impervious to the radiation environment.
