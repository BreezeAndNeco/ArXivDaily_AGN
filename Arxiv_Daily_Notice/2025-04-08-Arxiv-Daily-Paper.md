 - **Abstract**
 Aims: The presence of a Yukawa-like correction to Newtonian gravity is investigated at the Galactic Center, leading to a new upper limit for the intensity of such a correction. Methods: We perform a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis using the astrometric and spectroscopic data of star S$2$ collected at the Very Large Telescope by GRAVITY, NACO and SINFONI instruments, covering the period from $1992$ to $2022$. Results: The precision of the GRAVITY instrument allows us to derive the most stringent upper limit at the Galactic Center for the intensity of the Yukawa contribution ($\propto \, \alpha e^{- \lambda r}$) to be $|\alpha| < 0.003$ for a scale length $\lambda = 3 \cdot 10^{13}\, \rm m\, (\sim 200 \, \rm AU)$. This improves by roughly one order of magnitude all estimates obtained in previous works.
#### Ain't no resonance high enough: Core collapse in self-interacting dark matter across two decades in halo mass

 - **Abstract**
 Core collapse, a process associated with self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) models, can increase the central density of halos by orders of magnitude with observable consequences for dwarf galaxy properties and gravitational lensing. Resonances in the self-interaction cross section, features of hidden-sector models with light mediators and attractive potentials, can boost the strength of self-interactions near specific relative velocities, accelerating collapse in halos with central velocity dispersions near the resonance. To explore this phenomenon, we present a suite of idealized N-body simulations of isolated halos with masses $10^7$-$10^9 \ \rm{M_\odot}$ evolved under two resonant cross section (RCS) models with localized enhancement to the cross section on scales $v \sim 5$-$50 \ \rm{km} \ \rm{s^{-1}}$. We show that the change in halo internal structure depends on how the velocity distribution of bound particles moves across resonances in the cross section during core formation and collapse. The interplay between the velocity distribution of bound particles and localized features of the cross section causes deviations from self-similar evolution, a characteristic of velocity-independent cross sections, at the level of up to $20\%$. Depending on the alignment with resonant features, halos of different masses reach different evolutionary stages after a fixed physical time and develop diverse density profiles and rotation curves.

 - **Abstract**
 Parity-violating interactions are ubiquitous phenomena in particle physics. If they are significant during cosmic inflation, they can leave imprints on primordial perturbations and be observed in correlation functions of galaxy surveys. Importantly, parity-violating signals in the four-point correlation functions (4PCFs) cannot be generated by Einstein gravity in the late universe on large scales, making them unique and powerful probes of high-energy physics during inflation. However, the complex structure of the 4PCF poses challenges in diagnosing the underlying properties of parity-violating interactions from observational data. In this work, we introduce a general framework that provides a streamlined pipeline directly from a particle model in inflation to galaxy 4PCFs in position space. We demonstrate this framework with a series of toy models, effective-field-theory-like models, and full models featuring tree-level exchange-type processes with chemical-potential-induced parity violation. We further showed the detection sensitivity of these models from BOSS data and highlighted potential challenges in data interpretation and model prediction.

 - **Abstract**
 We present new time delays, the main ingredient of time delay cosmography, for 22 lensed quasars resulting from high-cadence r-band monitoring on the 2.6 m ESO VLT Survey Telescope and Max-Planck-Gesellschaft 2.2 m telescope. Each lensed quasar was typically monitored for one to four seasons, often shared between the two telescopes to mitigate the interruptions forced by the COVID-19 pandemic. The sample of targets consists of 19 quadruply and 3 doubly imaged quasars, which received a total of 1 918 hours of on-sky time split into 21 581 wide-field frames, each 320 seconds long. In a given field, the 5-{\sigma} depth of the combined exposures typically reaches the 27th magnitude, while that of single visits is 24.5 mag - similar to the expected depth of the upcoming Vera-Rubin LSST. The fluxes of the different lensed images of the targets were reliably de-blended, providing not only light curves with photometric precision down to the photon noise limit, but also high-resolution models of the targets whose features and astrometry were systematically confirmed in Hubble Space Telescope imaging. This was made possible thanks to a new photometric pipeline, lightcurver, and the forward modelling method STARRED. Finally, the time delays between pairs of curves and their uncertainties were estimated, taking into account the degeneracy due to microlensing, and for the first time the full covariance matrices of the delay pairs are provided. Of note, this survey, with 13 square degrees, has applications beyond that of time delays, such as the study of the structure function of the multiple high-redshift quasars present in the footprint at a new high in terms of both depth and frequency. The reduced images will be available through the European Southern Observatory Science Portal.
#### AGN outflows and their properties in Mrk 766 as revealed by KOOLS-IFU on the Seimei Telescope

 - **Abstract**
 We present the emission-line flux distributions and their ratios, as well as the gas outflow features, of the innermost 2 kpc region of the type 1 Seyfert galaxy Mrk 766, using the Kyoto Okayama Optical Low-dispersion Spectrograph with an optical-fiber integral field unit on the Seimei Telescope. We find that the central region of Mrk 766 is kinematically disturbed, exhibiting asymmetric and radially distributed AGN-driven ionized gas outflows traced by \OIII\ with velocities exceeding 500 \kms. The mass of the ionized gas outflow is estimated to be $10^{4.65-5.95} M_{\odot}$, and the mass outflow rate is $0.14-2.73$ M${\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. This corresponds to a kinetic power, $\dot{E}_{\rm K}$, of $4.31 \times 10^{40} \ {\rm erg} \ {\rm s^{-1}}< \dot{E}_{\rm K} < 8.62 \times 10^{41} \ {\rm erg} \ {\rm s^{-1}}$, which is equivalent to $0.08\%-1.53\%$ of the bolometric luminosity, $L_{\rm bol}$. This result is consistent with other observed properties of ionized gas outflows, although it is lower than the theoretical predictions in AGN feedback models ($\sim5\%$), implying that ionized gas outflows traced by \OIII\ represent only a minor fraction of the total outflows ejected from the host galaxy. Given the asymmetric and radially distributed outflow signatures observed across the host galaxy within the limited field of view, the maximum distance the outflowing gas has traveled remains an open question.

 - **Abstract**
 The distribution of interval times between recurrent discrete events, such as Solar and stellar flares, reflects their underlying dynamics. Log-normal functions provide good fits to the interval time distributions of many recurrent astronomical events. The width of the fit is a dimensionless parameter that characterizes its underlying dynamics, in analogy to the critical exponents of renormalization group theory. If the distribution of event strengths is a power law, as it often is over a wide range, then the width of the log-normal is independent of the detector sensitivity in that range, making it a robust metric. Analyzing two catalogues of Solar flares over periods ranging from 46 days to 37 years, we find that the widths of log-normal fits to the intervals between flares are wider than those of shot noise, indicating memory in the underlying dynamics even over a time much shorter than the Solar cycle. In contrast, the statistics of flare stars are consistent with shot noise (no memory). We suggest that this is a consequence of the production of Solar flares in localized transient active regions with varying mean flare rate, but that the very energetic flares of flare stars result from global magnetic rearrangement that reinitializes their magnetohydrodynamic turbulence.

 - **Abstract**
 The Superconducting Cosmic Strings (SCS) are a special case of cosmic strings that have a core carrying a charged field. When SCS pass through magnetized regions, the charged particles in the string experience a Lorentz force, which can produce radiation on the entire electromagnetic spectrum. This radiation can inject energy into the surrounding plasma, resulting in a modification of the thermal and ionization evolution of the intergalactic medium (IGM) and, subsequently, the global 21-cm signal. The signatures of SCS in the post-recombination era have been primarily studied in the low-frequency (radio) regime, which does not impact the state of the IGM. In this work, we study the effect of decaying SCS on the Dark Ages global 21-cm signal $(\delta T_b)$, considering both the ionizing and radio radiations. The Dark Ages signal can provide pristine cosmological information free from astrophysical uncertainties, as the universe was primarily homogeneous during this era in the absence of baryonic structure formation. Considering a change in the $\delta T_b$ at redshift $z\sim 89$ from the $\Lambda \rm CDM$ framework to be $5\,\rm mK$ and $15\,\rm mK$, we derive an upper bound on the loop current of cosmic string, $I\gtrsim 11.5\,\rm GeV$, and string tension, $G\mu_s\gtrsim 2.5\times 10^{-15}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic chemically peculiar (mCP) stars are strongly magnetic upper main-sequence stars that exhibit light rotational variability due to an uneven surface distribution of certain peculiar elements, which may appear in phase at certain wavelengths and in antiphase to the flux at other wavelengths. We present a study of the properties of photometric variability of a sample of confirmed mCP stars (mostly Ap/CP2 stars), mCP star candidates, and several non-CP stars in the near ultraviolet and visible wavelength regions based on observational data from the GALEX and Kepler prime missions. Antiphase variations between the near ultraviolet and optical light curves are observed in the majority of mCP stars. We investigate the presence of a correlation of the variability amplitudes in both wavelength regions with effective temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity and calculate model atmospheres, spectral energy distributions and synthetic light curves to connect our findings to theoretical models. While the theoretical calculations show that, at fixed abundances, a clear correlation between the light curve amplitude ratios and effective temperature is expected, our sample does not show any correlation with the investigated properties. This may be due to the highly individualistic abundance patterns of our sample stars, which are the main contributors to the line blanketing in different wavelength bands.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent studies of ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) have shown their globular cluster (GC) systems to be central in unveiling their remarkable properties and halo masses. Deep HST imaging revealed 54 GC candidates around the UDG NGC5846_UDG1 (UDG1), with a remarkable 13 per cent of the stellar light contained in the GC system. We present a kinematic analysis of UDG1's GC system from observations with the integral field spectrograph KCWI on the Keck II telescope. We measure recessional velocities for 19 GCs, confirming them as members of UDG1, giving a total of 20 confirmed GCs when combined with literature. Approximately 9 per cent of the stellar light are contained just in the confirmed GCs. We determine the GC system's velocity dispersion to be $\sigma_{\rm GC}$=29.8$^{+6.4}_{-4.9}$ km s$^{-1}$. We find that $\sigma_{\rm GC}$ increases with increasing magnitude, consistent with predictions for a GC system that evolved under the influence of dynamical friction. The GC system velocity dispersion is constant out to $\sim1R_{\rm eff}$. Using $\sigma_{\rm GC}$, we calculate $M_{\rm dyn}$=$2.09^{+1.00}_{-0.64}\times$10$^{9}$M$_{\odot}$ as the dynamical mass enclosed within $\sim$2.5 kpc. The dark matter halo mass suggested by the GC number-halo mass relationship agrees with our dynamical mass estimate, implying a halo more massive than suggested by common stellar mass-halo mass relationships. UDG1, being GC-rich with a massive halo, fits the picture of a failed galaxy.
#### Comprehensive JWST+ALMA Study on the Extended Ly$α$ Emitters, Himiko and CR7 at $z\sim 7$: Blue Major Merger Systems in Stark Contrast to Submillimeter Galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 We present various properties of two bright extended Ly$\alpha$ objects, Himiko and CR7, at $z=6.6$ thoroughly investigated with JWST/NIRCam photometry, NIRSpec-IFU spectroscopy, and ALMA data, uncovering their physical origins. Himiko (CR7) shows at least five (four) clumps with small separations of 2.4--7.3 kpc and velocity offsets of $\Delta v<220~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$ in the [OIII]$\lambda\lambda4959,5007$ line maps, three of which exhibit stellar components with comparable stellar masses ranging in $\log{(M_*/M_\odot)}=8.4$--$9.0$ ($8.3$--$8.8$), indicative of major merger systems that are consistent with our numerical simulations. The [CII]158$\mu$m and Ly$\alpha$ lines are found in the middle of two clumps (the brightest clump) in Himiko (CR7), suggesting that the distribution of neutral gas does not always coincide with that of ionized gas or stars in merging processes. We find that some of the clumps have broad [OIII] components (250--400$~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$) in Himiko and CR7, likely tracing outflow and tidal features, while the central clump in Himiko presents a broad H$\alpha$ ($\sim1000~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$) line explained by an AGN with a low mass black hole of $M_\mathrm{BH}=10^{6.6}~M_\odot$, which contribute to the extended and bright nature of Himiko and CR7. We find low metallicities of $12+\log(\mathrm{O/H})=$7.9--8.1 in Himiko and CR7 based on auroral [OIII]$\lambda4363$ and strong lines that are consistent with no 1-mm continuum detection corresponding to the dust mass limits of $M_\mathrm{dust}\lesssim 9\times 10^6 M_\odot$. Himiko and CR7 are metal- and dust-poor blue merger systems with stellar and dust masses $\gtrsim2$ orders of magnitude smaller than the massive dust-rich merger systems represented by submillimeter galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 Merger of two white dwarfs (WDs) has been proposed to form an isolated WD having high magnetization and rapid rotation. We study the influence of the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wind on spin evolution of the newly-formed merger product. We consider the scenario that the merger product appears as a giant-star-like object with a radius of $> 10^{10}$ cm and a luminosity of the order of an Eddington value. We solve a structure of the merger product under the hydrostatic equilibrium and identify the position of the slow-point in the hot envelope. It is found that if such a giant-star-like object is spinning with an angular speed of the order of the Keplerian value, the MHD wind can be produced. The mass-loss rate is estimated to be of the order of $\sim 10^{20-21}~\mathrm{g~s^{-1}}$, and the timescale of the spin down is $\sim 10\text{-}10^{3}$ years, which depends on stellar magnetic field. We discuss that the final angular momentum when the MHD wind is terminated is related to the magnetic flux and initial radiation luminosity of the merger product. We apply our model to three specific magnetic WD sources ZTF J190132.9+145808.7, SDSS J221141.8+113604.4, and PG 1031+234 by assuming that those WDs were as a result of the merger product. We argue that the current periods of ZTF J190132.9+145808.7 and PG 1031+234 that are strongly magnetized WDs are related to the initial luminosity at the giant phase. For SDSS J221141.8+113604.4, which is mildly magnetized WD, its angular momentum was almost determined when the spin-down timescale due to MHD wind is comparable to the cooling timescale in the giant phase.

 - **Abstract**
 Electromagnetic waves undergo modifications as they propagate through plasma. We present EMPI (ElectroMagnetic-wave Plasma Interaction), a three-dimensional numerical framework designed to simulate the interaction between radio signals and cold plasma. With input plasma density profiles, intrinsic radio signals, and the time and frequency resolutions of the telescope, the code synthesizes observed signals using first-principles calculations. EMPI is capable of modeling a wide range of plasma distributions, spanning analytically described smooth functions (e.g., Gaussian or exponential profiles), statistical models (e.g., turbulent screens), and discrete macroscopic structures like isolated plasma clumps, which are difficult to model both analytically and statistically. Validation tests demonstrate excellent agreement with established plasma propagation effects, such as dispersion, lensing, scintillation, and scattering. This code provides an efficient method for handling both analytical and statistical scenarios, bridging the gap between these descriptions. Thanks to its comprehensive capabilities, EMPI is particularly useful for studying radio sources with cosmological origin, especially pulse-like signals such as Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). As these signals travel through diverse and complex plasma environments across the universe, their properties are inevitably altered, resulting in observable changes. In this context, EMPI serves as a valuable tool for studying the propagation effects of these sources, helping to advance the understanding of their essence and the intervening plasma environments.

 - **Abstract**
 Converging flows are visible around bipolar magnetic regions (BMRs) on the solar surface, according to observations. Average flows are created by these inflows combined, and the strength of these flows depends on the amount of flux present during the solar cycle. In models of the solar cycle, this average flow can be depicted as perturbations to the meridional flow. In this article, we study the effects of introducing surface inflow to the surface flux transport models (SFT) as a possible nonlinear mechanism in the presence of latitude quenching for an inflow profile whose amplitude varies within a cycle depending on the magnetic activity. The results show that including surface inflows in the model in the presence of both LQ and tilt quenching (TQ) produced a polar field within a $\pm$1$\sigma$ of an average cycle polar field ($\sigma$ is the standard deviation) and a correlation coefficient of 0.85. We confirm that including inflows produces a lower net contribution to the dipole moment (10\,--\,25\%). Furthermore, the relative importance of LQ vs. inflows is inversely correlated with the dynamo effectivity range ($\lambda_{R}$). With no decay term, introducing inflows into the model resulted in a less significant net contribution to the dipole moment. Including inflows in the SFT model shows a possible nonlinear relationship between the surface inflows and the solar dipole moment, suggesting a potential nonlinear mechanism contributing to the saturation of the global dynamo. For lower $\lambda_R$ ($\lessapprox$ 10 $^\circ$), TQ always dominates LQ, and for higher $\lambda_R$ LQ dominate. However, including inflows will make the domination a little bit earlier in case of having a decay term in the model.

 - **Abstract**
 In resistive and viscous magnetohydrodynamical simulations, we obtain axial outflows launched from the innermost magnetosphere of a star-disk system. The launched outflows are found to be asymmetric. We find the part of the parameter space corresponding to quasi-stationary axial outflows and compute the mass load and angular momentum flux in such outflows. We display the obtained geometry of the solutions and measure the speed of propagation and rotation of the obtained axial outflows.

 - **Abstract**
 Analyzing longitude-velocity diagrams (LVDs) in the CS(J=2-1) and H13CN(J=1-0) molecular lines from the internal release data of the ALMA Central-Molecular-Zone Exploration Survey (ACES) and in the 13CO (J=1-0) line from the Nobeyama Galactic-Centre (GC) survey, we identify six GC Arms as prominent straight LV ridges. In addition to the currently known Arms I to IV, we identify a new inner arm, Arm V, and further highlight the circum-nuclear disc (CND) as Arm VI. Integrated intensity maps of the Arms on the sky suggest that most of the Arms compose ring-like structures inclined from the Galactic plane. We determine the radii (curvatures) of the Arms using the velocity-gradient ($dv/dl$) method, assuming that the arms are rotating on circular orbits at a constant velocity of $\sim 150$ km/s. We show that Arms I and II compose the main ring structure of the CMZ with radii $\sim 100$--120 pc; Arm III is a dense arm 42 pc from the GC; Arm IV is a clear and narrow arm 20 pc from the GC; and Arm V is a faint, long arm of 8.2 pc radius. We show that the circum-nuclear disc (CND) composes the sixth arm, Arm VI, of radius $\sim 2.3$ pc associated with bifurcated spiral fins. We also discuss the association of the 20- and 50-km/s clouds with these Arms. The radii of the arms fall on an empirical relation $R\sim 630 (2/5)^N$ for $N=1$ (Arm I) to 6 (VI), suggesting either discrete rings or a logarithmic spiral with pitch angle $\sim 22^\circ$. The vertical full extent of the arm increases with radius and is represented by $z\sim 0.7 (R/1 {\rm pc})^{0.7}$ pc. The tilt angle of the arms from the Galactic plane, or the warping, increases rapidly toward the GC.

 The arrival of a series of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) at the Earth resulted in a great geomagnetic storm on 10 May 2024, the strongest storm in the last two decades. We investigate the kinematic and thermal evolution of the successive CMEs to understand their interaction en route to Earth. We attempt to find the dynamics, thermodynamics, and magnetic field signatures of CME-CME interactions. Our focus is to compare the thermal state of CMEs near the Sun and in their post-interaction phase at 1 AU. The 3D kinematics of six identified Earth-directed CMEs were determined using the GCS model. The flux rope internal state (FRIS) model is implemented to estimate the CMEs' polytropic index and temperature evolution from their measured kinematics. The thermal states of the interacting CMEs are examined using in-situ at 1 AU. Our study determined the interaction heights of selected CMEs and confirmed their interaction that led to the formation of complex ejecta identified at 1 AU. The plasma, magnetic field, and thermal characteristics of magnetic ejecta (ME) within the complex ejecta and other substructures, such as interaction regions (IRs) within two ME and double flux rope-like structures within a single ME, show the possible signatures of CME-CME interaction in in-situ observations. The FRIS-model-derived thermal states for individual CMEs reveal their diverse thermal evolution near the Sun, with most CMEs transitioning to an isothermal state at 6-9 Rsun, except for CME4, which exhibits an adiabatic state due to a slower expansion rate. The complex ejecta at 1 AU shows a predominant heat-release state in electrons, while the ions show a bimodal distribution of thermal states. On comparing the characteristics of CMEs near the Sun and at 1 AU, we suggest that such one-to-one comparison is difficult due to CME-CME interactions significantly influencing their post-interaction characteristics.

 - **Abstract**
 Aims: Previous estimates of planet occurrence rates in the CARMENES survey indicated increased numbers of planets on short orbits for M dwarfs with masses below 0.34\,M$_\odot$. Here we focused on the lowest-mass stars in the survey, comprising 15 inactive targets with masses under 0.16\,M$_\odot$. Methods: To correct for detection biases, we determined detection sensitivity maps for individual targets and the entire sample. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we estimated planet occurrence rates for orbital periods of 1\,d to 100\,d and minimum masses from 0.5\,M$_\oplus$ to 10\,M$_\oplus$. Results: The radial velocity (RV) data from CARMENES reveal four new planets around three stars in our sample, namely G~268--110\,b, G~261--6\,b, and G~192--15\,b and c. All three b planets have minimum masses of 1.03--1.52\,M$_\oplus$ and orbital periods of 1.43--5.45\,d, while G~192--15\,c is a 14.3\,M$_\oplus$ planet on a wide, eccentric orbit with $P \approx 1218$\,d and $e \approx 0.68$. Our occurrence rates suggest considerable dependencies with respect to stellar masses. For planets below 3\,M$_\oplus$ we found rates consistent with one planet per star across all investigated periods, but the rates decrease almost by an order of magnitude for larger planet masses up to 10\,M$_\oplus$. Compared to previous studies, low-mass stars tend to harbor more planets with $P <10$\,d. We also demonstrate that synthetic planet populations based on the standard core accretion scenario predict slightly more massive planets on wider orbits than observed. Conclusions: Our findings confirm that planet occurrence rates vary with stellar masses even among M dwarfs, as we found more planets with lower masses and on shorter orbits in our subsample of very low-mass stars compared to more massive M dwarfs. Therefore, we emphasize the need for additional differentiation in future studies.
#### Do accretion-powered stellar winds help spin down T Tauri stars?

 - **Abstract**
 How T Tauri stars remain slowly rotating while still accreting material is a long-standing puzzle. Current models suggest that these stars may lose angular momentum through magnetospheric ejections of disk material (MEs) and accretion-powered stellar winds (APSWs). The individual contribution of each mechanism to the stellar spin evolution, however, is unclear. We explore how these two scenarios could be distinguished by applying stellar spin models to near-term observations. We produce synthetic stellar populations of accreting Class II stars with spreads in the parameters governing the spin-down processes and find that an APSW strongly affects the ratio of the disk truncation radius to the corotation radius, $\mathcal{R} = R_\mathrm{t}/R_\mathrm{co}$. The ME and APSW scenarios are distinguished to high confidence when at least $N_\mathrm{crit}\gtrsim 250$ stars have values measured for $\mathcal{R}$. Newly developed lightcurve analysis methods enable measuring $\mathcal{R}$ for enough stars to distinguish the spin-down scenarios in the course of upcoming observing campaigns.

 - **Abstract**
 Bipolar emerging flux regions (EFRs) form active regions (ARs) that generally evolve in a pre-existing magnetic environment in the solar atmosphere. Reconfiguration of the small- and large-scale magnetic connectivities is invoked to explain a plethora of energy release phenomena observed at the sites of EFRs. These include brightening events, surges, and jets, whose trigger and relationship are still unclear. In this context, we study the formation of a proto-spot in AR NOAA~11462 by analyzing spectropolarimetric and spectroscopic measurements taken by the Interferometric Bidimensional Spectrometer along the Fe~I 630.2~nm and Ca~II 854.2~nm lines on April 17, 2012. We complement these high-resolution data with simultaneous SDO satellite observations. The proto-spot forms from magnetic flux emerged into the photosphere that coalesces following plasma flows in its surrounding. The chromospheric and higher atmosphere observations show that flux emergence occurs in a pre-existing magnetic environment, with small- and large-scale coronal arcades that seemingly shape the proto-spot formation in the upper atmospheric layers. In addition, in the chromosphere we observe an arch filament system and repeated intense brightening events and surges, likely due to magnetic interactions of the new flux with the pre-existing overlying coronal field. These phenomena are observed since early stages of the new flux emergence.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the progenitors of long-period hot subdwarf B (sdB) binaries, which form when low-mass red giant branch (RGB) stars lose their envelopes through stable Roche lobe overflow (RLOV) near the tip of the RGB. We aim to expand our previous volume-limited sample of 211 stars within 200 pc to 500 pc and validate it. Additionally, our goal is to provide the distribution of stellar parameters for these stars. We refined the original sample using Gaia DR3 parallaxes and interstellar extinction measurements. High-resolution spectra for 230 stars were obtained between 2019 and 2023 using the CORALIE spectrograph. To confirm or discard binarity, we combined astrometric parameters from Gaia with the resulting radial velocity variations. We derived the distribution of stellar parameters using atmospheric and evolutionary models, confirming that 82% of stars in our sample are indeed RGB stars using the equivalent evolutionary phase. The remaining 18% are red clump (RC) contaminants, which was expected due to the overlapping of RGB and RC stars in the colour-magnitude diagram. Additionally, 75% of the confirmed RGB stars have a high probability of being part of a binary system. Comparison with the literature shows good overall agreement with a scatter $\lesssim 15\%$ in stellar parameters, while the masses show somewhat higher dispersion ($\sim 20\%$).

 - **Abstract**
 There is compelling evidence that AGNs are strongly influenced by their environment. Therefore, studying the AGN population of clusters is essential, as both large-scale structures and AGN play key roles in galaxy evolution, though the interactions between these elements are still not well understood. The primary objective of this study is to unravel the different factors that may significantly affect the triggering of AGN activity in cluster galaxies, including galaxy merging and interactions with other galaxies, and ram pressure from the hot intracluster medium. For our purposes, we used 82 X-ray detected AGN found within a $4r_{500}$ radius of 164 X-ray detected and spectroscopically confirmed galaxy clusters of the XXL survey, up to a redshift of $z\sim$1. This field is covered by deep optical observations of the Hyper Suprime-Cam, which allows for a reliable morphological classification of galaxies. Furthermore, using the X-ray hardness ratio, the optical spectra and the SEDs of the X-ray sources, we have studied the obscuration and other AGN properties and the SFR of the hosts as further indicators of interactions. We found a moderately significant higher fraction of X-ray AGN in galaxy clusters hosted by merging or disturbed galaxies, compared to non-active cluster galaxies or X-ray AGN in the field. This excess is primarily localised in the cluster outskirts. Also, we discovered a higher number of X-ray-hard AGN (hence, possibly obscured) in clusters than in the field particularly in the outskirts. These findings further support the idea that galaxy mergers and interactions may serve as mechanisms for the triggering and obscuration of AGN activity. The relatively high number of disturbed, merging, and possibly obscured AGN hosts in cluster outskirts suggests that galaxy merging and interactions are key drivers in triggering AGN activity in these outer regions of clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 X-ray observations are essential for understanding the multimessenger emission mechanisms of active galactic nuclei (AGN). Blazars, a subset of AGN whose X-ray emission predominantly originates from relativistic jets, have been proposed as promising high-energy neutrino sources. In this work, we study the candidate neutrino-emitting blazar 5BZB J0630-24064, which has been observed over multiple epochs with the XMM-Newton, NuSTAR, Neil Gehrels Swift-XRT, and eROSITA observatories. Analysis of the X-ray spectra in the 2.0-10.0 keV band shows significant variability, with high flux states adhering to a power-law model indicative of jet emission. However, during low-flux states, the spectrum reveals an additional component at hard-X-rays, indicating a transition from jet-dominated to multi-component X-ray emission, possibly associated with hadronic processes. To investigate this spectral evolution, we tested various models and found it to be consistent with corona emission or photoionised absorption processes typically observed in obscured AGN. The identification of the X-ray spectral variability in 5BZB J0630-24064, combined with its potential for neutrino production, opens new perspectives in multimessenger astrophysics of blazars highlighting the synergies between the mechanisms of the jet and the nuclear environment.

 - **Abstract**
 The diffuse stellar component of galaxy clusters known as intracluster light (ICL) has been proposed as an observable tracer of the cluster's dark matter (DM) halo. Assessing its reliability as a DM tracer requires understanding how the intracluster stars are energetically linked to the underlying DM distribution, which we investigate at $z\approx0$ in 12 galaxy clusters with $M_{178} = 1.18 - 3.71 \times 10^{14}\,\textrm{M}_\odot$ from the Horizon-AGN simulation. We quantify the orbital energies of these components by their mean specific energies ${\langle \varepsilon \rangle}$, and find that this quantity is $\approx$ 25 per cent lower for the intracluster stars than the DM, whilst the energetics of the satellite galaxies (a standard DM tracer) are only marginally ($\approx$ 5 per cent) higher than the DM. Importantly, the lower ${\langle \varepsilon \rangle}$ of the intracluster stars compared to the DM is robust against the precise separation between the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) and the ICL. The specific energy distribution of ICL stars is concentrated towards lower energies and poorly samples the higher energies, where much of the DM resides. Consequently, the intracluster stars have velocity distributions with lower typical speeds and a more centrally-concentrated density profile than the DM. We also find that intracluster stars have more radially-biased orbits than the DM, indicating these components have distinct orbital distributions. This study demonstrates that although the morphology of the ICL may match the DM halo, the ICL is a biased tracer of DM, and these biases must be understood in order to infer properties of the DM from the ICL.

 - **Abstract**
 Next-generation photometric and spectroscopic surveys will detect faint galaxies in massive clusters, advancing our understanding of galaxy formation in dense environments. Comparing these observations with theoretical models requires high-resolution cluster simulations. Hydrodynamical simulations resolve galaxy properties in halos, but face challenges simulating low-mass galaxies due to computational limitations. In contrast, dark matter-only (DMO) simulations can provide higher resolution but need models to populate subhalos with galaxies. In this work, we introduce a fast and efficient emulator of hydrodynamical cluster simulations, based on the semi-analytic models (SAMs) SAGE and SAG. The SAMs are calibrated using cluster galaxies from hydrodynamical simulations at intermediate resolution, ensuring consistency in stellar masses and luminosities across redshifts. These SAMs are then applied to DMO simulations from The Three Hundred Project at three resolutions. We show that the SAG model, unlike SAGE, better emulates galaxy properties even at the highest resolution. This improvement is due to the treatment of orphan galaxies, which contribute significantly to the total population. SAG enables the study of dwarf galaxies down to stellar masses of 10^7 solar masses at the highest resolution, an order of magnitude smaller than those in the hydrodynamical simulations, corresponding to approximately four magnitudes fainter. This shows that SAMs can be effectively calibrated to provide fast and accurate predictions of hydrodynamical simulations, offering an efficient alternative to explore galaxy populations in dense environments.

 - **Abstract**
 The depth and coverage of the first years of JWST observations have revealed low luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGN) across a wide redshift range, shedding light on black hole (BH) assembly and feedback. We present our spectroscopic sample of 34 Type 1 AGN obtained from JADES survey data and spanning $1.5 < z < 9$. Our sample of AGN probes a BH mass range of $10^{6-9}$~M$_{\odot}$ at bolometric luminosities down to $10^{43}$~erg~s$^{-1}$, implying generally sub-Eddington ratios of $<0.5L_{\rm Edd}$. Most of these AGN are hosted in low mass ($M_{\star}\sim10^8$~M$_{\odot}$) galaxies and are overmassive relative to the local $M_{BH}-M_{\star}$ relation, while remaining consistent with the local $M_{BH}$-$\sigma_*$ relation. The wide redshift range provided by our sample allows us to trace the emergence of local $M_{BH}$-$M_*$ scaling relation across the cosmic epoch. Additionally, we explore the capability of narrow-line diagnostics in identifying Type 2 AGN and find that a significant fraction of our AGN would be missed by them due to low metallicity or lack of high energy ionizing photons (potentially due to dust absorption, dense gas blanketing the broad and narrow line regions, or intrinsically soft ionizing spectra). We explore the UV luminosity function of AGN and their hosts and find that it is subject to significant cosmic variance and is also dependent on the AGN bolometric luminosity. Finally, we show that the electron and Balmer scattering scenarios recently proposed to explain the broad components of the Balmer lines are untenable on multiple grounds. There is no evidence that the black hole masses have been overestimated by orders of magnitude as proposed in those scenarios.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the discovery, and initial lensing analysis, of a high-redshift galaxy-galaxy lensing system within the JWST-PEARLS/HST-TREASUREHUNT North Ecliptic Pole Time Domain Field (designated NEPJ172238.9+655143.1). The lensing geometry shears a $z=3.6\pm0.1$ star-forming galaxy into a near-Einstein ring with a radius of 0\farcs92, consisting of 4 primary images, around a foreground massive elliptical galaxy at $z=1.258\pm0.005$. The system is fortuitously located within the NIRISS F200W footprint of the PEARLS survey, enabling spectroscopic identification of the 8500A TiO band in the foreground galaxy and allowing tight constraints to be placed on the redshift of the background galaxy based on its continuum detection and lack of strong emission lines. We calculate magnification factors of $2.6<\mu<8.4$ for the four images and a total lensing mass of $(4.08 \pm 0.07)\times10^{11}M_\odot$. SED fitting of the foreground elliptical galaxy within the Einstein radius reveals a stellar mass of $\sim1.26\times10^{11}M_\odot$, providing a mass/light ratio of 3.24. Employing simple scaling relations and assumptions, an NFW dark matter halo is found to provide the correct remaining mass within $0.12^{+0.21}_{-0.09}$dex. However, if a bottom-heavy IMF for elliptical galaxies is employed, stellar mass estimations increase and can account for the majority of the lensing mass (up to $\sim$83\%), reducing the need for dark matter. This system further demonstrates the new discovery space that the combined wavelength coverage, sensitivity and resolution of JWST now enables.

 - **Abstract**
 The search of exoplanets around nearby M dwarfs is a crucial milestone to perform the census of planetary systems in the vicinity of our Solar System. Since 2018 our team is carrying a radial-velocity blind search program for planets around nearby M dwarfs with the near-IR spectro-polarimeter and velocimeter SPIRou at the CFHT and the optical velocimeter SOPHIE at the OHP in France. Here we present our results on Gl 410, a 0.55 Msun 480+-150 Myr old active M dwarf distant 12 pc. We use the line-by-line (LBL) technique to measure the RVs with SPIRou and the template matching method with SOPHIE. Three different methods, two based in principal component analysis (PCA), are used to clean the SPIRou RVs for systematics. Gaussian processes (GP) modeling is applied to correct the SOPHIE RVs for stellar activity. The l1 and apodize sine periodogram (ASP) analysis is used to search for planetary signals in the SPIRou data taking into account activity indicators. We analyse TESS data and search for planetary transits. We report the detection of a M sin(i)=8.4+-1.3 Mearth sub-Neptune planet at a period of 6.020+-0.004 days in circular orbit with SPIRou. The same signal, although with lower significance, is also retrieved in the SOPHIE RV data after correction for activity using a GP trained on SPIRou's longitudinal magnetic field (Bl) measurements. TESS data indicates that the planet is not transiting. We find within the SPIRou wPCA RVs tentative evidence for two additional planetary signals at 2.99 and 18.7 days. In conclusion, infrared RVs are a powerful method to detect extrasolar planets around active M dwarfs, care should be taken however to correct/filter systematics generated by residuals of the telluric correction or small structures in the detector plane. The LBL technique combined with PCA offers a promising way to reach this objective. Further monitoring of Gl 410 is necessary.

 - **Abstract**
 Networks of cosmic domain walls can form in the early Universe as a consequence of the spontaneous breaking of discrete symmetries. We study the production of a cosmological background of gravitational waves (GWs) from such networks, when they annihilate due to a small explicit symmetry breaking term. Averaging over several 3+1-dimensional high-resolution lattice field simulations, we obtain a GW spectrum with the following characteristics: (1) a broad asymmetric peak, roughly located at frequency $f\sim 2 H_{\rm gw}$, where $H_{\rm gw}$ is the Hubble rate at the end of GW production, shortly after annihilation, (2) a doubly broken power spectrum $\propto k^{-n}$, with initial slope $n \sim 0.5$ after the main peak and $n \sim 1.8$ at high $f$, while the low frequency region $f<f_p$ agrees with the causality behavior $\sim k^3$. Additionally, extending previous results, we find that GW production continues to be efficient until a value of the Hubble scale $H_{\text gw}$ that is roughly an order of magnitude smaller than the naive estimate $\sigma H = \Delta V$, where $\sigma$ is the wall tension and $\Delta V$ the size of the symmetry breaking term, thereby leading to a $O(100)$ larger GW signal. We find such results to be robust when changing the shape of the scalar field potential or including a time-dependent symmetry breaking term. Our findings have important implications for GW searches, especially in light of the reported evidence for a stochastic GW background in Pulsar Timing Array data.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a study of the $^{12}$CO(1-0) line emission anisotropy across the Milky Way's disk to examine the effect of stellar feedback and Galactic dynamics on the distribution of the dense interstellar medium. The Hessian matrix method is used to characterize the CO line emission distribution and identify the preferential orientation across line-of-sight velocity channels in the Dame et al. 2001 composite Galactic plane survey, which covers the Galactic latitude range $|b|<5^{\circ}$. The structures sampled with this tracer are predominantly parallel to the Galactic plane toward the inner Galaxy, in clear contrast with the predominantly perpendicular orientation of the structures traced by neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) emission toward the same regions. The analysis of the Galactic plane portions sampled at higher angular resolution with other surveys reveals that the alignment with the Galactic plane is also prevalent at smaller scales. We find no preferential orientation in the CO emission toward the outer Galaxy, in contrast with the preferential alignment with the Galactic plane displayed by HI in that portion of the Milky Way. We interpret these results as the combined effect of the decrease in mid-plane pressure with increasing Galactocentric radius and SN feedback lifting diffuse gas more efficiently than dense gas off the Galactic plane.
