 - **Abstract**
 From the scale-free nature of gravity, the structure in the universe is expected to be self-similar on large scales. However, this self-similarity will eventually break down due to small-scale gas physics such as star formation, AGN and stellar feedback as well as non-linear effects gaining importance relative to linear structure formation. In this work we investigate the large-scale matter flows that connect collapsed structures to their cosmic environments specifically for their agreement with self-similarity in various properties. For this purpose we use the full power of the hydrodynamical cosmological simulation suite Magneticum Pathfinder to calculate the in- and outflow rates for haloes on a large range of masses and redshifts. We find a striking self-similarity across the whole mass range and cosmic epochs that only breaks in the outflowing regime due to the different outflow driving mechanisms for galaxies vs. galaxy clusters. Geometrical analysis of the patterns of in vs. outflow demonstrate how the inflows organize into anisotropic filaments driven by the tidal environment, while the outflows are isotropic due to their thermal nature. This also manifests in the thermal and chemical properties of the gas: While the inflowing gas is pristine and colder, encountering the accretion shocks and entering the influence region of AGN and stellar feedback heats the gas up into a diffuse, metal enriched and hot atmosphere. Overall the differences between outflowing and infalling gas are enhanced at the galaxy cluster scale compared to the galaxy scale due to the accretion shocks that reach out to large radii for these objects. An individual study of the gas motions in the outskirts of one of the most massive clusters in the simulations illustrates these results: Gas found in the outer hot atmosphere at z=0 falls in and is completely enriched early before being shock heated and expanding.
#### Fundamentals of Stars II: Revisiting Bolometric Corrections

 - **Abstract**
 The development line of bolometric corrections within the brief history of photometry was described from the perspective of the Kuhnian philosophy of science. The luminous efficiency and heat index were two previous concepts to imply visual and bolometric brightness difference of a star, which was mainly suggested and used as auxiliary tools for calibrating stellar temperature scales before the term ``bolometric correction'' (BC) was also introduced for the same purpose by Kuiper in 1938, as $BC = M_{\rm bol} - M_{\rm V} = m_{\rm {bol}} - V$. Despite its ill-posed nature imposing no zero-point constant ($C_2=0$) for the BC scale and $L_{\rm V} = L \times 10^{BC/2.5}$, if $BC>0$, $L_{\rm V}$ is unphysical, for the luminosity of a star from which ``BC of a star must always be negative,'' ``the bolometric magnitude of a star ought to be brighter than its $V$-magnitude,'' and ``the zero point of bolometric corrections are arbitrary'' (paradigms) were extracted. The newest of the first three definitions of BC was accepted and used throughout the century. Therefore, the part of the development line of BC before Kuiper could be considered a prescience period. The rest could be named the normal science period in which astrophysicists work under the three paradigms. The rise of BC as a concept, how the ill-posed definition BC emerged/used, how inconsistencies (paradigms) of BC developed, and how the Resolution B2 of the General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union imposing $C_{\rm bol} = 71.197\,425\,\ldots$ mag, and $C_2>0$, for the zero-point constants of the $M_{\rm {Bol}}$ and BC scales resolve the long-lasting problems were discussed. Generalized new definition of BC implying $L_{\rm V}=L \times 10^\frac{({\rm BC}-C_2)}{2.5}$ were given to replace $L = L_{\rm V} \times 10^{BC/2.5}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Identifying bifurcated blue straggler (BS) sequences in color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of star clusters has long been regarded as a powerful diagnostic for distinguishing different BS formation mechanisms. While such bifurcations are typically associated with core-collapsed clusters, their detection in dynamically young clusters raises new questions about their origins. In this study, using high-precision proper motion data derived from Hubble Space Telescope multi-epoch observations, we confirm the existence of two distinct BS sequences in the Large Magellanic Cloud cluster NGC 2173 (~ 1.58 Gyr): a well-defined, narrow blue sequence and a sparser red sequence. The extended core region excludes collisional formation as a viable channel for BS formation. Our binary evolution models suggest that non-conservative mass transfer (MT) is essential for shaping the distribution of BS binaries in the CMD. The red sequence primarily comprises BS binaries formed through conservative ongoing MT. In contrast, the blue sequence BS binaries are formed through non-conservative post-MT processes, all involving white dwarf (WD) companions. These BS+WD binary systems may subsequently undergo a second MT phase, leading to the formation of double WD systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Using a sample of 166 projected quasar pairs we investigate the influence of active galactic nuclei on the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of the quasar host galaxies probed using strong Mg II absorption (i.e., $W_{2796}\ge 1\dot{A}$) at impact parameters ($D$) $<$100 kpc. The foreground quasars are restricted to the redshift range $0.4 \leq z \leq 0.8$ and have median bolometric luminosity and stellar mass of $10^{45.1} erg~s^{-1}$and $10^{10.89} M_\odot$ respectively. We report detections of Mg II absorption in 29 cases towards the background quasar and in 4 cases along the line of sight to the foreground quasars. We do not find any difference in the distribution of $W_{2796}$ and covering fraction ($f_c$) as a function of $D$ between quasar host galaxies and control sample of normal galaxies. These results are different from what has been reported in the literature, possibly because: (i) our sample is restricted to a narrow redshift range, (ii) comparative analysis is carried out after matching the galaxy parameters, (iii) we focus mainly on strong Mg II absorption and (iv) our sample lacks foreground quasars with high bolometric luminosity (i.e., $L_{bol}>10^{45.5}$ erg s$^{-1}$). Future studies probing luminous foreground quasars, preferably at lower impact parameters and higher equivalent width sensitivity is needed to consolidate our findings.

 - **Abstract**
 Although all Type II supernovae (SNe) originate from massive stars possessing a hydrogen-rich envelope, their light curve morphology is diverse, reflecting poorly characterised heterogeneity in the physical properties of their progenitor systems. Here, we present a detailed light curve analysis of a magnitude-limited sample of 639 Type II SNe from the Zwicky Transient Facility Bright Transient Survey. Using Gaussian processes, we systematically measure empirical light curve features (e.g. rise times, peak colours and luminosities) in a robust sampling-independent manner. We focus on rise times as they are highly sensitive to pre-explosion progenitor properties, especially the presence of a dense circumstellar medium (CSM) shed by the progenitor in the years immediately pre-explosion. By correlating our feature measurements with physical parameters from an extensive grid of STELLA hydrodynamical models with varying progenitor properties (CSM structure, $\dot M$, $R_{CSM}$ and $M_{ZAMS}$), we quantify the proportion of events with sufficient pre-explosion mass-loss to significantly alter the initial light curve (roughly $M_{CSM} \geq 10^{-2.5} M_{\odot}$) in a highly complete sample of 377 spectroscopically classified Type II SNe. We find that 67 $\pm$ 6\% of observed SNe in our magnitude-limited sample show evidence for substantial CSM ($M_{CSM} \geq 10^{-2.5} M_{\odot}$) close to the progenitor ($R_{CSM} <10^{15}$ cm) at the time of explosion. After applying a volumetric-correction, we find 36$^{+5}_{-7}$\% of all Type II SN progenitors possess substantial CSM within $10^{15}$ cm at the time of explosion. This high fraction of progenitors with dense CSM, supported by photometric and spectroscopic evidence of previous SNe, reveals mass-loss rates significantly exceeding those measured in local group red supergiants or predicted by current theoretical models.

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce the rapidly emerging field of multi-messenger gravitational lensing - the discovery and science of gravitationally lensed phenomena in the distant universe through the combination of multiple messengers. This is framed by gravitational lensing phenomenology that has grown since the first discoveries in the 20th century, messengers that span 30 orders of magnitude in energy from high energy neutrinos to gravitational waves, and powerful "survey facilities" that are capable of continually scanning the sky for transient and variable sources. Within this context, the main focus is on discoveries and science that are feasible in the next 5-10 years with current and imminent technology including the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA network of gravitational wave detectors, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, and contemporaneous gamma/X-ray satellites and radio surveys. The scientific impact of even one multi-messenger gravitational lensing discovery will be transformational and reach across fundamental physics, cosmology and astrophysics. We describe these scientific opportunities and the key challenges along the path to achieving them. This article is the introduction to the Theme Issue of the Philosophical Transactions of The Royal Society A on the topic of Multi-messenger Gravitational Lensing, and describes the consensus that emerged at the associated Theo Murphy Discussion Meeting in March 2024.
#### The COSMOS Wall at z ~ 0.73: Quiescent galaxies and their evolution in different environments

 - **Abstract**
 The evolution of quiescent galaxies is driven by numerous physical processes, often considered to be related to their stellar mass and environment over cosmic time. Tracing their stellar populations can provide insight into the processes that transformed these galaxies into their observed quiescent state. In particular, higher-redshift galaxies exhibit more pronounced relative age differences. At early stages, even small differences in age remain significant, whereas as galaxies evolve, these differences become harder to detect in the local Universe. The COSMOS Wall is a structure at z ~ 0.73 that contains a large variety of environments, from rich clusters down to field-like regions. This sample offers a great opportunity to study the effect of the environment on the quiescent galaxy population. Leveraging high-quality spectroscopic data from the LEGA-C survey, and photometric data from the COSMOS2020 catalogue, we performed a full-index and photometry fitting of 74 massive quiescent galaxies, deriving their mass-weighted ages, metallicities, and star formation timescales. We characterised the environment in three subsamples: X-ray and non-X-ray groups and a field subsample. We find a decreasing trend in mass-weighted age with increasing environmental density, with galaxies groups > 1 Gyr older than those in the field. Conversely, we do not find any significant difference in stellar metallicity between galaxies in X-ray and non-X-ray groups, while we find galaxies with 0.15 dex higher metallicities in the field. Our results indicate that, at z ~ 0.7, the environment plays a crucial role in shaping the evolution of massive quiescent galaxies, noticeably affecting both their mass-weighted age and star formation timescale. These results support faster quenching mechanisms, at fixed stellar mass, in the dense X-ray-detected groups compared to the field.

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate measurements of stellar positions and velocities are crucial for studying galactic and stellar dynamics. We aim to create a Cartesian catalog from {\it Gaia} DR3 to serve as a high-precision database for further research using stellar coordinates and velocities. To avoid the negative parallax values, we select 31,129,169 sources in {\it Gaia} DR3 with radial velocity, where the fractional parallax error is less than 20\% ($0 < \sigma_\varpi/\varpi < 0.2$). To select the most accurate and efficient method of propagating mean and covariance, we use the Monte Carlo results with $10^7$ samples (MC7) as the benchmark, and compare the precision of linear, second-order, and Monte Carlo error propagation methods. By assessing the accuracy of propagated mean and covariance, we observe that second-order error propagation exhibits mean deviations of at most 0.5\% compared to MC7, with variance deviations of up to 10\%. Overall, this outperforms linear transformation. Though Monte Carlo method with $10^4$ samples (MC4) is an order of magnitude slower than second-order error propagation, its covariances propagation accuracy reaches 1\% when $\sigma_\varpi/\varpi$ is below 15\%. Consequently, we employ second-order error propagation to convert the mean astrometry and radial velocity into Cartesian coordinates and velocities in both equatorial and galactic systems for 30 million {\it Gaia} sources, and apply MC4 for covariance propagation. The Cartesian catalog and source code are provided for future applications in high-precision stellar and galactic dynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 High-energy astrophysical systems and compact objects are frequently modeled using ideal relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) or force-free electrodynamic (FFE) simulations, with the underlying assumption that the discretisation from the numerical scheme introduces an effective (numerical) magnetic resistivity that adequately resembles an explicit resistivity. However, it is crucial to note that numerical resistivity can fail to replicate essential features of explicit resistivity. In this study, we compare the 1D resistive decay and 2D reconnection properties of four commonly used physical models. We demonstrate that the 1D Ohmic decay of current sheets via numerical dissipation in both ideal MHD and magnetodynamics (MD) is subdiffusive (i.e., sub-linear in time), whereas explicit resistive FFE and resistive MHD simulations match the predictions of resistive theory adequately. For low-resolution, reconnecting current sheets in 2D, we show that ideal MHD and MD have an analogue to the Sweet--Parker regime where the scaling of the reconnection rate depends directly on the resolution. At high resolutions, ideal MHD and MD have an asymptotic reconnection rate similar to resistive MHD. Furthermore, we find that guide field-balanced current sheets in ideal MHD and MD have a qualitative structure similar to that of one in resistive MHD. Similarly, a pressure-balanced current sheet in ideal MHD is found to have a qualitative structure similar to that of one in resistive MHD. For a guide field-balanced sheet, resistive FFE is found to have a nearly identical Sweet--Parker regime compared to resistive MHD and a similar asymptotic reconnection rate for large enough Lundquist numbers, but differs in the timescale for reconnection onset in the asymptotic regime. We discuss the implications of our findings for global simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 We present $4-12$ GHz in-band spectral energy distributions with accompanying 6 GHz and 10 GHz imaging results for a volume-complete sample ($<40$ Mpc) of hard X-ray selected active galactic nuclei (AGNs) observed with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) in its A-array configuration. Despite expectations, only 12 out of 25 of these targets have been detected by the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) at milliarcsecond resolution in our previous studies, and we aim to understand the nature of why the circumnuclear radio emission resolves away at the subparsec spatial scales. We find that the sources not detected by the VLBA are also the faintest sources observed with the VLA. We explore the spectral structure derived from the nuclear emission and measure a mean spectral index of $\langle\alpha\rangle=-0.69$ with a scatter of $\sigma_\alpha=0.18$ for the sources not detected by the VLBA, indicative of optically thin synchrotron emission. The 12 sources detected by the VLBA primarily have flat ($-0.5\leq\alpha\leq0.0$) or inverted ($\alpha>0$) spectral indices. Nine of the sources have statistically significant curvature, with only one that was not detected by the VLBA. In NGC~3079, we model an approximately flat spectrum for the excess emission observed by the VLA that is likely produced entirely beyond parsec spatial scales.

 - **Abstract**
 We present new results on the spatial structure and kinematics of Lya and several far-UV metallic ions in the circumgalactic medium of Keck Baryonic Structure Survey galaxies using foreground/background galaxy pairs with angular separations < 30". Keck/KCWI and Keck/LRIS spectra of 736 background galaxies with z_bg = 2.58 +/- 0.38 probe sightlines through 1033 foreground galaxies (z_fg = 2.03 +/- 0.36) at projected distances 8 < D_tran/kpc < 250. For each ion, we measure equivalent widths (W_lambda) as a function of D_tran and find W_lambda ~ D_tran^(-gamma) with 0.3 < gamma < 0.6. Higher ionization species (C IV) decrease less rapidly and extend to larger D_tran compared to low ions (O I, C II, Si II). Splitting the pair sample into subsets based on foreground galaxy properties, we find W_lambda(C IV) exhibits a strong dependence on stellar mass (M_star) and a weaker dependence on star formation rate. Similarly, W_lambda(Lya) increases with M_star, albeit with more scatter. In 2D, we map the excess Lya and C IV absorption as functions of line-of-sight velocity and D_tran. The Lya velocity centroid varies with D_tran; at D_tran < 50 kpc, Lya emission from the foreground galaxy affects the Lya absorption feature measured in the background galaxy spectrum, resulting in a net blueshifted absorption profile. We construct a two-component model to fit the observed Lya map. The best fit suggests approximately half of the excess Lya absorption arises from a decelerating outflow component with initial velocity v_out ~ 750 km/s; the remainder is associated with a component centered on the galaxy systemic redshift with a D_tran-independent 1D velocity dispersion of sigma_v ~ 220 km/s, consistent with the average foreground galaxy circular velocity.

 - **Abstract**
 This chapter provides a detailed overview of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way, located in the dense Galactic Center region approximately 8 kpc from Earth. Despite its relatively low activity compared to more luminous active galactic nuclei, Sgr A* has provided invaluable insights into black hole physics due to its proximity, enabling high-resolution observations of stellar orbits, gas dynamics, and variable emissions. In addition, Sgr A* illustrates how supermassive black holes influence galaxy evolution through energy feedback and matter redistribution. Early identification as a compact radio source and subsequent measurements of stellar orbits confirmed Sgr A* as a black hole with a mass near 4 million solar masses. Observations of stars moving on tight, short-period orbits around the black hole have allowed direct tests of general relativity, such as gravitational redshift and orbital precession, under the influence of extreme gravitational fields. Sgr A* displays variability across the electromagnetic spectrum, with flares in radio, infrared, and X-rays revealing complex interactions in the accretion flow, while outflows redistribute energy into the surrounding environment. Together, Sgr A* and its environment offer a crucial window into the behavior of galactic nuclei.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are a type of highly-polarized, millisecond-duration electromagnetic pulses in the radio band, which are mostly produced at cosmological distances. These properties provide a natural laboratory for testing the extreme Faraday effect, a phenomenon in which two different propagation modes of a pulse separate after passing through a dense, highly ionized, and magnetized medium. We derive the critical condition (e.g., rotation measure) for the extreme Faraday effect to occur in FRBs, which exceeds the currently observed maximum value but remains within the theoretically predicted range. Some new features of FRBs (in particular, radio bursts with much shorter durations) after undergoing the extreme Faraday effect are predicted, such as sudden sign reversals of circular polarization, conspicuous frequency drifting, and emergency of extremely high circular polarization degrees. A potential application of this effect in FRBs is that, by comparing morphological differences of the two separated twin modes, one can identify the variations of plasma properties over extremely short timescales along the propagation path. Therefore, if this effect is found with future observations, it would provide a new tool for probing dense, magnetized environments near FRB sources.

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of radio emission in radio-quiet (RQ) AGN remains a long-standing mystery. We present a detailed study of the cm to sub-mm emission from the nucleus of the nearby prototypical RQ Seyfert 2 galaxy, NGC 1068. We analyse observations between 4.5-706 GHz using $e$-MERLIN, VLA and ALMA. We restricted all data used for imaging to a matching $uv-$range of 15$-$3300 k$\lambda$, to ensure that all data sampled the same spatial scales. All images were restored with a $\sim$ 0.06$''$ beam. To derive the spectral energy distribution (SED), we fit synchrotron, free-free, dust and coronal component models to these data. We report that the sub-mm excess between $\sim$ 200-700 GHz is consistent with synchrotron emission from a compact and optically thick corona with a radius $R_\mathrm{c}\approx 70\pm5 \,R_\mathrm{g}$, a fraction of $\sim$\,$10\pm2$% of the energy density in the form of non-thermal electrons, and a magnetic field strength $B\approx 148$ G. The luminosity of the corona is roughly consistent with -- though higher than -- the expected from mm--X-ray correlations derived in recent studies of RQ AGN. This difference is likely due to the corona SED peaking at ($\approx$550 GHz). Between 10 and $\sim$ 200 GHz, the SED is dominated by free-free emission. High angular resolution observations at frequencies below 5 GHz are needed to constrain a putative optically thin synchrotron component and the amount of free-free absorption.

 - **Abstract**
 This work present the results of a multi-epoch observational study of the blazar S5\,1803+784, carried out from 2019 to 2023. The analysis is based on simultaneous data obtained from the Swift/UVOT/XRT, ASAS-SN, and Fermi-LAT instruments. A historically high $\gamma$-ray flux observed for this source on march 2022 ($\mathrm{2.26\pm0.062)\times10^{-6}~phcm^{-2}s^{-1}}$. This study investigates the $\gamma$-ray emission from a blazar, revealing a dynamic light curve with four distinct flux states: quiescent and high-flux by using the Bayesian Blocks (BB) algorithm. A potential transient quasi-periodic signal with an oscillation timescale of $\sim$411 days was identified, showing a local significance level surpassing 99.7$\%$ from the Lomb-Scargle Periodogram (LSP) and Damped Random Walk (DRW) analysis and exceeds 99.5$\%$ from the Weighted Wavelet Z-Transform (WWZ) analysis. The observed QPO was confirmed through an autoregressive process (AR(1)), with a significance level exceeding 99$\%$, suggesting a potential physical mechanism for such oscillations involves a helical motion of a magnetic plasma blob within the relativistic jet. Log parabola modeling of the $\gamma$-ray spectrum revealed a photon index ($\alpha_\gamma$) variation of 1.65$\pm$0.41 to 2.48$\pm$0.09 with a steepening slope, potentially indicative of particle cooling, changes in radiative processes, or modifications in the physical parameters. The $\alpha_\gamma$ of 2.48$\pm$0.09 may hint at an evolutionary transition state from BL\,Lac to FSRQ. A comparative analysis of variability across different energy bands reveals that Optical/UV and GeV emissions display greater variability compared to X-rays. Broadband SED modeling shows that within a one-zone leptonic framework, the SSC model accurately reproduces flux states without external Compton contributions, highlighting magnetic fields crucial role.

 - **Abstract**
 The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed a population of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) that challenge existing black hole (BH) formation models. These newly observed BHs are overmassive compared to the host galaxies and have an unexpectedly high abundance. Their exact origin remains elusive. The primary goal of this work is to investigate the formation of massive BH seeds in dense Population III (Pop III) star clusters. Using a cosmological simulation of Pop III cluster formation, we present models for the assembly and subsequent evolution of these clusters. The models account for background gas potential, stellar collisions and associated mass loss, gas accretion, stellar growth, their initial mass function (IMF), and subsequent star formation. We conduct $N$-body simulations of these models over a span of 2 million years. Our results show that BHs of $> 400$ M$_\odot$ are formed in all cases, reaching up to $\sim 5000$ M$_\odot$ under optimistic yet reasonable conditions and potentially exceeding 10$^4$ M$_\odot$ provided that high accretion rates of 10$^{-3}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ onto the stars can be sustained. We conclude that massive BHs can be formed in Pop III stellar clusters and are likely to remain within their host clusters. These BHs may experience further growth as they sink into the galaxy's potential well. This formation channel should be given further consideration in models of galaxy formation and BH demographics.

 - **Abstract**
 Radio observation of the large-scale structure (LSS) of our Universe faces major challenges from foreground contamination, which is many orders of magnitude stronger than the cosmic signal. While other foreground removal techniques struggle with complex systematics, methods like foreground avoidance emerge as effective alternatives. However, this approach inevitably results in the loss of Fourier modes and a reduction in cosmological constraints. We present a novel method that, by enforcing the non-negativity of the observed field in real space, allows us to recover some of the lost information, particularly phase angles. We demonstrate that the effectiveness of this straightforward yet powerful technique arises from the mode mixing from the non-linear evolution of LSS. Since the non-negativity is ensured by mass conservation, one of the key principles of the cosmic dynamics, we can restore the lost modes without explicitly expressing the exact form of the mode mixing. Unlike previous methods, our approach utilizes information from highly non-linear scales, and has the potential to revolutionize the analysis of radio observational data in cosmology. Crucially, we demonstrate that in long-baseline interferometric observations, such as those from the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), it is still possible to recover the baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) signature despite not directly covering the relevant scales. This opens up potential future survey designs for cosmological detection.

 Aims. We investigated the potential of using Hepsilon to diagnose small-scale energetic phenomena such as Ellerman bombs, UV bursts, and small-scale flares. Our focus is to understand the formation of the line and how to use its properties to get insight into the dynamics of small-scale energetic phenomena. Methods. We carried out a forward modeling study, combining simulations and detailed radiative transfer calculations. The 3D radiative magnetohydrodynamic simulations were run with the Bifrost code and included energetic phenomena. We employed a Markovian framework to study the Hepsilon multilevel source function, used relative contribution functions to identify its formation regions, and correlated the properties of synthetic spectra with atmospheric parameters. Results. Ellerman bombs are predominantly optically thick in Hepsilon, appearing as well-defined structures. UV bursts and small flares are partially optically thin and give rise to diffuse structures. The Hepsilon line serves as a good velocity diagnostic for small-scale heating events in the lower chromosphere. However, its emission strength is a poor indicator of temperature, and its line width offers limited utility due to the interplay of various broadening mechanisms. Compared to Halpha, Hepsilon exhibits greater sensitivity to phenomena such as Ellerman bombs, as its line core experiences higher extinction than the Halpha wing. Conclusions. Hepsilon is a valuable tool for studying small-scale energetic phenomena in the lower chromosphere. It provides more reliable estimates of velocities than those extracted from wing emission in Halpha or Hbeta. Maps of Hepsilon emission show more abundant energetic events than the Halpha counterpart. Our findings highlight Hepsilons potential to advance our understanding of dynamic processes in the solar atmosphere.

 - **Abstract**
 I present the results of echelle spectroscopy of a bright HII region in the irregular galaxy IC4662 and their comparison with results from long-slit spectroscopy of the same region. All observations were obtained with the standard spectrographs of the SALT telescope: (1) low and medium spectral resolution spectrograph RSS (R~800) and (2) echelle spectrograph HRS (R=16000-17000). In both types of data the intensities of most of the emission lines were measured and abundances of oxygen and N, Ne, S, Ar, Cl and Fe were determined as well as physical parameters of the \ion{H}{ii} region. The chemical abundances were obtained from both types of data with the Te-method. Abundances calculated from both types of data agree to within the cited uncertainties. The analysis of the echelle data revealed three distinct kinematic subsystems within the studied \ion{H}{ii} region: a narrow component (NC, $\sigma ~ 12$~km/s), a broad component (BC, $\sigma ~ 40$~km/s), and a very broad component (VBC, $\sigma ~ 60-110$~km/s, detected only in the brightest emission lines). The velocity dispersion dependence on the ionisation potential of elements showed no correlation for the NC, indicating a well-mixed turbulent medium, while the BC exhibited pronounced stratification, characteristic of an expanding shell. Based on a detailed analysis of the kinematics and chemical composition, it was concluded that the BC is associated with the region surrounding a Wolf-Rayet star of spectral type WN7-8. The stellar wind from this WR star interacts with a shell ejected during an earlier evolutionary stage (either as a red supergiant or a luminous blue variable, LBV), which is enriched in nitrogen. These findings highlight the importance of high spectral resolution for detecting small-scale (~25 pc) chemical inhomogeneities and for understanding the feedback mechanisms of massive stars in low-metallicity environments.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the largest visually selected sample of extended ($>$60 arcsec) radio-loud active galactic nuclei (RLAGN) to date, based on the LOw-Frequency Array Two-Metre Sky Survey second data release (LoTSS DR2). From the broader LoTSS DR2 dataset with spectroscopic classifications, we construct a subsample of 2828 RLAGN with radio luminosities greater than $10^{23}~\mathrm{W~Hz^{-1}}$ at $z<0.57$. These RLAGN are further classified by optical emission-line properties into high-excitation and low-excitation radio galaxies, enabling a detailed emission-line analysis. Our subsample is also morphologically classified into Fanaroff \& Riley centre- and edge-brightened (FRI/FRII) sources, wide- and narrow-angle tail (WAT and NAT) sources, head-tail (HT) sources, and relaxed double (RD) sources. For these classifications, we utilize data from the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) to assist with the classification, taking advantage of its 2.5 arcsec resolution which is sensitive to structures below 30 arcsec. This resolution allows us to identify compact cores and hotspots, facilitating the identification of remnant and restarted RLAGN candidates. We investigate the relationship between emission-line and radio properties in RLAGN, analyzing mid-infrared data, host galaxy mass, and core prominence. These analyses uncover the complex relationship between these factors and the underlying accretion mechanisms. Our findings emphasize that no single property can fully constrain the accretion mode in RLAGN, highlighting the necessity of multi-dimensional approaches to reveal the processes driving RLAGN behaviour.

 - **Abstract**
 The problem of the formation of exoplanets in inclined orbits relative to the equatorial plane of the parent star or the main plane of the protoplanetary disk can be solved by introducing a smaller inclined disk. However, the question of the nature of such an internal disk remains open. In the paper, we successfully tested the hypothesis about the formation of an inclined inner disk in a protoplanetary disk near a T Tau type star as a result of a gas stream falling on it. To test the hypothesis, three-dimensional gas-dynamic calculations were performed taking into account viscosity and thermal conductivity using the PLUTO package. In the course of the analysis of calculations, it was shown that a single intersection of the matter stream with the plane of the disk cannot ensure the formation of an inclined disk near the star, while a double intersection can. In addition, in the case of a retrograde fall of matter, the angle of inclination of the resulting inner disk is significantly greater. An analysis of the observational manifestations of this event was also carried out: the potential change in the brightness of the star, the distribution of optical thickness in angles, the evolution of the accretion rate. It is shown that the decrease in brightness can reach up to $5^m$, taking into account scattered light, and such a decrease in brightness will last several decades. In addition, a sharp increase in the accretion rate by two orders of magnitude could potentially trigger an FU Ori-like outburst.

 - **Abstract**
 We present 850 $\mu$m polarized continuum observations carried out with the POL-2 polarimeter mounted on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) towards NGC 7023 located in the Cepheus Flare region. NGC 7023 is a reflection nebula powered by a Herbig Ae Be star HD 200775 and also identified as a hub in the hub-filament cloud, LDN 1172/1174. We detect submillimetre emission well towards the northern (identified as C1) and the eastern region of the reflection nebula. We investigated the polarization structure and the magnetic field (B-field) morphology, which is found to be curved and follows the clump morphology. The comparison of the B-field morphology at the clump scales ($\sim$0.02 pc) with that of the envelope ($\sim$0.5 pc) suggests that the field lines are not preserved from envelope to clump scales, implying that an external factor may be responsible for disturbing the B-field structure. We estimated a magnetic field strength of 179$\pm$50 $\mu$G in the starless core, 121$\pm$34 $\mu$G in the protostellar core with a class I source and 150$\pm$42 $\mu$G in the protostellar core with a class II source using the $N_{2}H^{+}$ (1-0) line observed with 13.7 m single dish radio telescope at Taeduk Radio Astronomy Observatory (TRAO). The stability analysis using these B-field strengths gives magnetically sub-critical values, while the magnetic, gravitational, and outflow kinetic energies are roughly balanced. We also suggest that the reordering of the magnetic field lines could be due to the interaction with the already evolved high-velocity outflow gas around the central star, which hints at the presence of outflow feedback.

 - **Abstract**
 It is established that the ultraviolet (UV) and X-ray emissions in active galactic nuclei (AGN) are tightly correlated. This correlation is observed both in low- and high-redshift sources. In particular, observations of large samples of quasars revealed the presence of a non-linear correlation between UV and X-rays. The physical origin of this correlation is poorly understood. In this work, we explore this observed correlation in the framework of the X-ray illumination of the accretion disc by a central source. We have shown in previous works that this model successfully explains the continuum UV/optical time delays, variability, and the broadband spectral energy distribution in AGN. We use this model to produce $150,000$ model SEDs assuming a uniform distribution of model parameters. We compute the corresponding UV ($ 2500~Å $) and X-ray (2 keV) monochromatic luminosities and select only the model data points that agree with the observed UV-to-X-ray correlation. Our results show that the X-ray illumination of accretion disc model can reproduce the observed correlation for a subset of model configurations with a non-uniform distribution of black hole mass ($M_{\rm BH}$), accretion rate ($\dot{m}/\dot{m}_{\rm Edd}$), and power transferred from the accretion disc to the corona ($L_{\rm transf}/L_{\rm disc}$). In addition, our results reveal the presence of a correlation between $M_{\rm BH}$ and $\dot{m}/\dot{m}_{\rm Edd}$, and between $\dot{m}/\dot{m}_{\rm Edd}$ and $L_{\rm transf}/L_{\rm disc}$, to explain the observed X-ray-UV correlation. We also present evidence based on observed luminosities supporting our findings. We finally discuss the implications of our results.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar mass can enhance the ranking of potential hosts for compact binary coalescences identified by ground-based gravitational-wave detectors within large localisation areas containing even thousands of galaxies. Despite its benefits, accurate stellar mass estimation is often time-consuming and computationally intensive. In this study, we implement four stellar mass estimation methods based on infrared magnitudes and compare them with values estimated with spectral energy distribution fitting from GAMA DR3, revealing strong correlations. We also introduce a method to calibrate the results from these estimation methods to match the reference values. Our analysis of simulated binary black hole events demonstrates that incorporating stellar mass improves the rank of actual hosts ~80 per cent of cases. Furthermore, the improvement is comparable when stellar masses are derived from the tested estimation methods to when they are obtained directly from the simulated galaxy catalogue, demonstrating that simple stellar mass estimates can provide a computationally efficient alternative.
