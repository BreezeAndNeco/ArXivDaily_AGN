#### Search for Axions from Magnetic White Dwarfs with Chandra

 - **Abstract**
 Low mass axion-like particles could be produced in abundance within the cores of hot, compact magnetic white dwarf (MWD) stars from electron bremsstrahlung and converted to detectable X-rays in the strong magnetic fields surrounding these systems. In this work, we constrain the existence of such axions from two dedicated Chandra X-ray observations of $\sim$40 ks each in the energy range $\sim$1 - 10 keV towards the magnetic white dwarfs (MWDs) WD 1859+148 and PG 0945+246. We find no evidence for axions, which constrains the axion-electron times axion-photon coupling to $|g_{a\gamma \gamma} g_{aee}| \lesssim 1.54 \times 10^{-25}$ ($3.54 \times 10^{-25}$) GeV$^{-1}$ for PG 0945+246 (WD 1859+148) at 95% confidence for axion masses $m_a \lesssim 10^{-6}$ eV. We find an excess of low-energy X-rays between 1 - 3 keV for WD 1859+148 but determine that the spectral morphology is too soft to arise from axions; instead, the soft X-rays may arise from non-thermal emission in the MWD magnetosphere.
#### An Effective Model for Magnetic Field Amplification by the Magnetorotational and Parasitic Instabilities

 - **Abstract**
 The magnetorotational instability (MRI) is considered a leading mechanism for driving angular momentum transport in differentially rotating astrophysical flows, including accretion discs and proto-neutron stars. This process is mediated by the exponential amplification of the magnetic field whose final amplitude is envisioned to be limited by secondary (parasitic) instabilities. In this paper, we investigate the saturation of the MRI via parasitic modes relaxing previous approximations. We carry out the first systematic analysis of the evolution of parasitic modes as they feed off the exponentially growing MRI while being advected by the background shear flow. We provide the most accurate calculation of the amplification factor to which the MRI can grow before the fastest parasitic modes reach a comparable amplitude. We found that this amplification factor is remarkably robust, depending only logarithmically on the initial amplitude of the parasitic modes, in reasonable agreement with numerical simulations. Based on these insights, and guided by numerical simulations, we provide a simple analytical expression for the amplification of magnetic fields responsible for MRI-driven angular momentum transport. Our effective model for magnetic field amplification may enable going beyond the standard prescription for viscous transport currently employed in numerical simulations when the MRI cannot be explicitly resolved.
#### A hidden Active Galactic Nuclei population: the first radio luminosity functions constructed by physical process

 - **Abstract**
 Both star formation (SF) and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) play an important role in galaxy evolution. Statistically quantifying their relative importance can be done using radio luminosity functions. Until now these relied on galaxy classifications, where sources with a mixture of radio emission from SF and AGN are labelled as either a star-forming galaxy or an AGN. This can cause the misestimation of the relevance of AGN. Brightness temperature measurements at 144 MHz with the International LOFAR telescope can separate radio emission from AGN and SF. We use the combination of sub-arcsec and arcsec resolution imaging of 7,497 sources in the Lockman Hole and ELAIS-N1 fields to identify AGN components in the sub-arcsec resolution images and subtract them from the total flux density, leaving flux density from SF only. We construct, for the first time, radio luminosity functions by physical process, either SF or AGN activity, revealing a hidden AGN population at $L_{\textrm{144MHz}}$$<10^{24}$ W$\,$Hz$^{-1}$ . This population is 1.56$\pm$0.06 more than expected for $0.5<z<2.0$ when comparing to RLFs by galaxy classification. The star forming population has only 0.90$\pm$0.02 of the expected SF. These 'hidden' AGN can have significant implications for the cosmic star formation rate and kinetic luminosity densities.
#### Panning for gold with the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory: an optimal strategy for finding the counterparts to gravitational wave events

 - **Abstract**
 The LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA gravitational wave observatories are currently undertaking their O4 observing run offering the opportunity to discover new electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational wave events. We examine the capability of the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory (Swift) to respond to these triggers, primarily binary neutron star mergers, with both the UV/Optical Telescope (UVOT) and the X-ray Telescope (XRT). We simulate Swift's response to a trigger under different strategies using model skymaps, convolving these with the 2MPZ catalogue to produce an ordered list of observing fields, deriving the time taken for Swift to reach the correct field and simulating the instrumental responses to modelled kilonovae and short gamma-ray burst afterglows. We find that UVOT using the $u$ filter with an exposure time of order 120 s is optimal for most follow-up observations and that we are likely to detect counterparts in $\sim6$% of all binary neutron star triggers. We find that the gravitational wave 90% error area and measured distance to the trigger allow us to select optimal triggers to follow-up. Focussing on sources less than 300 Mpc away or 500 Mpc if the error area is less than a few hundred square degrees, distances greater than previously assumed, offer the best opportunity for discovery by Swift with $\sim5 - 30$% of triggers having detection probabilities $\geq 0.5$. At even greater distances, we can further optimise our follow-up by adopting a longer 250 s or 500 s exposure time.
#### Can AGN activity be enhanced by ram pressure stripping? -- X-ray perspective

 - **Abstract**
 Ram pressure stripping (RPS) is an important process that plays a significant role in shaping the evolution of cluster galaxies and their surrounding environment. Despite its recognized significance, the potential connection between RPS and AGN activity in cluster galaxies remains poorly understood. Recent claims, based on optical emission line diagnostics, have suggested such a connection. Here, we investigate this relationship from an X-ray perspective using a sample of galaxies undergoing RPS in four nearby galaxy clusters - A1656, A1367, A426, and A3627. This study is the first to test such a connection from an X-ray standpoint. Our analysis reveals no signs of enhanced X-ray AGN activity in our sample, with most RPS galaxies ($\sim$ $90\%$) showing X-ray luminosities below $10^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in their central point sources. Moreover, there is no noticeable difference in X-ray AGN activity among RPS galaxies compared to a control sample of non-RPS galaxies, as demonstrated by similar X-ray luminosities observed in their central point sources. While the most luminous X-ray AGN in our sample is found in ESO 137-002, a galaxy undergoing RPS in A3627, there is no evidence for a widespread enhancement of X-ray AGN activity due to RPS. Given the limited sample size of our study, this could also indicate that either the X-ray AGN enhancement from RPS is at most weak, or the timescale for the X-ray AGN enhancement is short. This emphasizes the need for further investigations with larger X-ray samples to better understand the impact of RPS on AGN activity in cluster galaxies.
#### A simple model for spectroscopic analyses of active stars

 - **Abstract**
 Spectroscopic analyses of young late-type stars suffer from systematic inaccuracies, typically under-estimating metallicities but over-estimating abundances of certain elements including oxygen and barium. Effects are stronger in younger and cooler stars, and recent evidence specifically indicates a connection to the level of chromospheric activity. We present here a two-component spectroscopic model representing a non-magnetic baseline plus a magnetic spot, and analyse the resulting synthetic spectra of young solar analogues using a standard spectroscopic technique. For a moderately active star with solar parameters and chromospheric activity index log R'_HK = -4.3 (~100 Myr), we predict that [Fe/H] is underestimated by 0.06 dex while v_mic is overestimated by 0.2 km/s; for higher activity levels we predict effects as large as 0.2 dex and 0.7 km/s. Predictions are in agreement with literature data on solar twins, and indicate that the model is a plausible explanation to the observed effects. The model is simple enough that it can be included in spectroscopic packages with only changes to the underlying spectrum synthesis modules, if a log R'_HK value is provided.
#### HD 34736: An intensely magnetised double-lined spectroscopic binary with rapidly-rotating chemically peculiar B-type components

 - **Abstract**
 We report the results of a comprehensive study of the spectroscopic binary (SB2) system HD 34736 hosting two chemically peculiar (CP) late B-type stars. Using new and archival observational data, we characterise the system and its components, including their rotation and magnetic fields. Fitting of the radial velocities yields $P_\mathrm{orb}=83.\!^\mathrm{d}219(3)$ and $e=0.8103(3)$. The primary component is a CP He-wk star with $T_{\mathrm{eff}A}=13000\pm500$ K and $\upsilon_\mathrm{e}\sin i\;=75\pm3$ km/s, while the secondary exhibits variability of Mg and Si lines, and has $T_{\mathrm{eff}B}=11500\pm1000$ K and $\upsilon_\mathrm{e}\sin i=110$-180 km/s. TESS and KELT photometry reveal clear variability of the primary component with a rotational period $P_{\mathrm{rot}A}=1.\!^\mathrm{d}279\,988\,5(11)$, which is lengthening at a rate of $1.26(6)$ s/yr. For the secondary, $P_{\mathrm{rot}B}=0.\!^\mathrm{d}522\,693\,8(5)$, reducing at a rate of $-0.14(3)$ s/yr. The longitudinal component $\langle B_\mathrm{z}\rangle$ of the primary's strongly asymmetric global magnetic field varies from $-6$ to +5 kG. Weak spectropolarimetric evidence of a magnetic field is found for the secondary star. The observed X-ray and radio emission of HD 34736 may equally be linked to a suspected T Tau-like companion or magnetospheric emission from the principal components. Given the presence of a possible third magnetically active body, one can propose that the magnetic characteristics of the protostellar environment may be connected to the formation of such systems.
#### A photometric and spectroscopic study of eight semi-detached eclipsing binaries

 - **Abstract**
 By cross-matching the eclipsing binary catalog from TESS with that from LAMOST MRS, semi-detached eclipsing binaries with radial velocities coverage spanning more than 0.3 phases were authenticated. The absolute parameters for these systems were determined by simultaneous modeling of light curves and radial velocities using the Wilson-Devinney program. Additionally, the secular orbital variations were further analyzed using O-C curves. Eight semi-detached eclipsing binaries have been identified. Among them, seven feature primary stars situated within the main-sequence band, while their secondaries are all in evolved stages. This suggests that these systems likely originated as detached binaries and have undergone a reversal of the mass ratio. However, TIC 428257299 is an exception where the primary is Roche lobe-filling, and its secondary has experienced mass loss events. Additionally, TIC 8677671 and TIC 318217844 demonstrate secular cyclical changes of orbital periods. Specifically, for TIC 8677671, the cyclical change could result from magnetic activity or a third body which is likely to be compact, with a mass of at least 2.97 M$_{\odot}$.

 - **Abstract**
 A review of the results on the migration of celestial bodies in the Solar System and in some exoplanetary systems is presented. Some problems of planet accumulation and migration of planetesimals, small bodies and dust in the forming and present Solar System are considered. It has been noted that the outer layers of the Earth and Venus could have accumulated similar planetesimals from different areas of the feeding zone of the terrestrial this http URL formation of the embryos of the Earth and the Moon from a common rarefied condensation with subsequent growth of the main mass of the embryo of the Moon near the Earth is also discussed. The influence of changes in the semimajor axis of Jupiter's orbit on the formation of the asteroid belt is discussed, as well as the influence of planetesimals from the feeding zone of the giant planets on the formation of bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune. The migration of bodies to the terrestrial planets from different distances from the Sun is considered. It is noted that bodies from the feeding zone of the giant planets and from the outer asteroid belt could deliver to the Earth a quantity of water comparable to the mass of water in the Earth's oceans. The migration of bodies ejected from the Earth is considered. The probabilities of collisions of dust particles with the Earth are usually an order of magnitude greater than the probabilities of collisions of their parent bodies with the Earth. The migration of planetesimals is considered in exoplanetary systems Proxima Centauri and TRAPPIST-1. The amount of water delivered to the inner planet Proxima Centauri b, may have been more than the amount delivered to the Earth. The outer layers of neighboring planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system may contain similar material if there were many planetesimals near their orbits during the late stages of planetary accumulation.

 - **Abstract**
 The inner regions of protoplanetary disks are prone to thermal instability (TI), which can significantly impact the thermal and dynamic evolution of planet-forming regions. Observable as episodic accretion outbursts, such periodic disturbances shape the disk's vertical and radial structure. We investigate the stability of the inner disk edge around a Class II T Tauri star and analyse the consequences of TI on the inner disk's evolution in both the vertical and radial dimensions. A particular focus is laid on the emergence and destruction of solid-trapping pressure maxima. Our 2D axisymmetric radiation hydrodynamic models include the transition to the dead zone from a highly turbulent inner disk, heating by both stellar irradiation and viscous dissipation, vertical and radial radiative transport and an adaptive dust-to-gas mass ratio. The simulated time frames include both the TI- and quiescent phases. We track the TI on S-curves of thermal stability. The TI in our models can develop in disks with moderate accretion rates and results from the activation of the magnetorotational instability (MRI) in the dead zone. The TI creates an extensive MRI active region around the midplane and disrupts the stable pebble- and migration trap at the inner edge of the dead zone. Our simulations consistently show the occurrence of TI-reflares, which, together with the initial TI, produce pressure maxima in the inner disk within 1 AU, possibly providing favourable conditions for streaming instability. On a timescale of a few thousand years, TI regularly disrupts the disk's radial and vertical structure within 1 AU. While several pressure maxima are created, stable migration traps are destroyed and reinstated after the TI phase. Our models provide a foundation for more detailed investigations into phenomena such as short-term variability of accretion rates.
#### Examining the rotation of the planet-hosting M dwarf GJ 3942

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.05476

 - **Abstract**
 Based on radial velocities, EXORAP photometry, and activity indicators, the HADES team reported a 16.3-day rotation period for the M dwarf GJ 3992. However, an RV--H$\alpha$ magnitude-squared coherence estimate has significant peaks at frequencies 1/16 cycles/day and 1/32 cycles/day. We re-analyze HADES data plus Hipparcos, SuperWASP, and TESS photometry to see whether the rotation period could be 32 days with 16-day harmonic. SuperWASP shows no significant periodicities, while the Hipparcos observing cadence is suboptimal for detecting 16- and 32-day periodicities. Although the average TESS periodogram has peaks at harmonics of 1/16 cycles/day, the harmonic sequence is not fully resolved according to the Rayleigh criterion. The TESS observations suggest a 1/16 cycles/day rotation frequency and a 1/32 cycles/day subharmonic, though resolution makes the TESS rotation detection ambiguous.
#### On the magnetic and thermodynamic properties of dark fibrils in the chromosphere

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.05532

 - **Abstract**
 Fibrillar structures are ubiquitous in the solar chromosphere and their potential for mediating the mass and energy transport in the solar atmosphere is undeniable. An accurate determination of their properties requires the use of advanced high-resolution observations which are now becoming broadly available from different observatories. We exploit the capabilities of multi-atom, multi-line spectropolarimetric inversions using the Stockholm Inversion Code (STiC). Non-local thermodynamic equilibrium inversions of a fibril-rich area are performed using spectropolarimetric observations in the Ca II 854.2 nm line obtained with the CRISP imaging spectropolarimeter and spectroscopic observations in the Ca II H line obtained with the CHROMospheric Imaging Spectrometer (CHROMIS) at the Swedish 1-meter Solar Telescope (SST). Additionally, coobservations in the Mg II h & k lines obtained with the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) are used in the inversions to better constrain the thermodynamic properties of the fibrils. The incorporation of multiple atomic species and spectral lines proves to better constrain the properties of the plasma constituting the fibrils. In particular, the tracing of a large number of fibrils allowed for the study of the variation of the temperature and magnetic field along their projected length over the field of view. The results provide a view of fibrils possessing hot footpoints of about 5 900 K. The temperature drop away from the footpoints is on average 250 K, with a larger drop of around 500 K for the longer fibrils. The magnetic field is also reported to be larger at the footpoints, being almost twice as large as the minimum value reported at the middle point of the fibrils.
#### The rush to the poles and the role of magnetic buoyancy in the solar dynamo

 - **Abstract**
 The butterfly diagram of the solar cycle exhibits a poleward migration of the diffuse magnetic field resulting from the decay of trailing sunspots. It is one component of what is sometimes referred to as the "rush to the poles". We investigate under which conditions the rush to the poles can be reproduced in flux-transport Babcock-Leighton dynamo models. We identify three main ways to reproduce it: a flux emergence probability that decreases rapidly with latitude; a threshold in subsurface toroidal field strength between slow and fast emergence; and an emergence rate based on magnetic buoyancy. We find that all three mechanisms lead to solar-like butterfly diagrams, but which present notable differences between them. The shape of the butterfly diagram is very sensitive to model parameters for the threshold prescription, while most models incorporating magnetic buoyancy converge to very similar butterfly diagrams, with butterfly wings widths of $\lesssim\pm 30^\circ$, in very good agreement with observations. With turbulent diffusivities above $35~\text{km}^2/\text{s}$ but below about $40~\text{km}^2/\text{s}$, buoyancy models are strikingly solar-like. The threshold and magnetic buoyancy prescriptions make the models non-linear and as such can saturate the dynamo through latitudinal quenching. The period of the models involving buoyancy is independent of the source term amplitude, but emergence loss increases it by $\simeq 60\%$. For the rush to the poles to be visible, a mechanism suppressing (enhancing) emergences at high (low) latitudes must operate. It is not sufficient that the toroidal field be stored at low latitudes for emergences to be limited to low latitudes. From these models we infer that the Sun is not in the advection-dominated regime, but also not in the diffusion-dominated regime. The cycle period is set through a balance between advection, diffusion and flux emergence.
#### Ultra-high-energy cosmic rays from ultra-fast outflows of active galactic nuclei

 - **Abstract**
 We present an investigation of ultra-fast outflows (UFOs) in active galactic nuclei (AGN) as potential sources of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). We focus on cosmic-ray nuclei, an aspect not explored previously. These large-scale, mildly-relativistic outflows, characterised by velocities up to half the speed of light, are a common feature of AGN. We study the cosmic-ray spectrum and maximum energy attainable in these environments with 3D CRPropa simulations and apply our method to 87 observed UFOs. Iron nuclei can be accelerated up to $\sim10^{20}\,$eV at the wind-termination shock in some UFOs, but the escaping flux is strongly attenuated due to photonuclear interactions with intense AGN photon fields. The maximum energy of nuclei escaping most UFOs is interaction-limited to below $\sim 10^{17}\,$eV and scales with the mass number. In the most extreme $\sim10\%$ of UFOs in our sample, nitrogen and helium escape with energy exceeding $10^{17.6}\,$eV. Protons and neutrons, either primaries or by-products of photodisintegration, escape UFOs with little attenuation, with half of the observed UFOs reaching energies exceeding $10^{18}\,$eV. Thus, UFOs emerge as viable sources of the diffuse cosmic-ray flux between the end of the Galactic cosmic-rays and the highest-energy extragalactic flux. We demonstrate that UFOs can fill this part of the spectrum in terms of energetics, spectral shape and chemical composition and that the role of UFOs as UHECR sources is testable with neutrino telescopes due to a substantial accompanying neutrino flux with peak energy around a few PeV. For a small subset of UFOs in our sample, nuclei can escape without photodisintegration with energy up to $10^{19.8}\,$eV. This occurs during low-emission states of the AGN, which would make UFOs intermittent sources of UHECR nuclei up to the highest observed energies.

 - **Abstract**
 The innermost region of the Milky Way harbors the central molecular zone (CMZ). This region contains a large amount of molecular gas but a poor star formation rate considering the densities achieved by the gas in this region. We used the arepo code to perform a hydrodynamic and star formation simulation of the Galaxy, where a Ferrers bar was adiabatically introduced. During the stage of bar imposition, the bar strength excites density waves close to the inner Lindblad resonance guiding material toward the inner Galaxy, driving the formation of a ring that we qualitatively associate with the CMZ. During the simulation, we identified that the ring passes three main phases, namely: formation, instability, and quasi-stationary stages. During the whole evolution, and particularly in the quasi-stationary stage, we observe that the ring is associated with the x2 family of periodic orbits. Additionally, we found that most of the star formation occurs during the ring formation stage, while it drastically decreases in the instability stage. Finally, we found that when the gas has settled in a stable x2 orbit, the star formation takes place mostly after the dense gas passes the apocenter, triggering the conveyor-belt mechanism described in previous studies.
#### Understanding Streaming Instabilities in the Limit of High Cosmic Ray Current Density

 - **Abstract**
 A critical component of particle acceleration in astrophysical shocks is the non-resonant (Bell) instability, where the streaming of cosmic rays (CRs) leads to the amplification of magnetic fields necessary to scatter particles. In this work we use kinetic particle-in-cells simulations to investigate the high-CR current regime, where the typical assumptions underlying the Bell instability break down. Despite being more strongly driven, significantly less magnetic field amplification is observed compared to low-current cases, an effect due to the anisotropic heating that occurs in this regime. We also find that electron-scale modes, despite being fastest growing, mostly lead to moderate electron heating and do not affect the late evolution or saturation of the instability.
