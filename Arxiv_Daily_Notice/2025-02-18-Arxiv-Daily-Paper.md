 - **Abstract**
 Context: Hickson Compact Groups (HCGs) are dense gravitationally-bound collections of 4-10 galaxies ideal for studying gas and star formation quenching processes. Aims: We aim to understand the transition of HCGs from possessing complex HI tidal structures (so-called phase 2 groups) to a phase where galaxies have lost most or all their HI (phase 3). We also seek to detect diffuse H i gas that was previously missed by the Very Large Array (VLA). Methods: We observed three phase 2 and three phase 3 HCGs with MeerKAT and reduced the data using the Containerized Automated Radio Astronomy Calibration (CARACal) pipeline. We produced data cubes, moment maps, integrated spectra, and compared our findings with previous VLA and Green Bank Telescope (GBT) observations. Results: Compared with previous VLA observations, MeerKAT reveals much more extended tidal features in phase 2 and some new high surface brightness features in phase 3 groups. However, no diffuse HI component was found in phase 3 groups. We also detected many surrounding galaxies for both phase 2 and phase 3 groups, most of which are normal disk galaxies. Conclusions: The difference between phase 2 and phase 3 groups is still substantial, supporting previous findings that the transition between the two phases must be abrupt.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel statistical algorithm, Stellar Ages, which currently infers the age, metallicity, and extinction posterior distributions of stellar populations from their magnitudes. While this paper focuses on these parameters, the framework is readily adaptable to include additional properties, such as rotation, in future work. Historical age-dating techniques either model individual stars or populations of stars, often sacrificing population context or precision for individual estimates. Stellar Ages does both, combining the strengths of these approaches to provide precise individual ages for stars while leveraging population-level constraints. We verify the algorithm's capabilities by determining the age of synthetic stellar populations and actual stellar populations surrounding a nearby supernova, SN 2004dj. In addition to inferring an age, we infer a progenitor mass consistent with direct observations of the precursor star. The median age inferred from the brightest nearby stars is $\log_{10}$(Age/yr) = $7.19^{+0.10}_{-0.13}$, and its corresponding progenitor mass is $13.95^{+3.33}_{-1.96}$ $\text{M}_{\odot}$.

 - **Abstract**
 We leverage JWST data from the COSMOS-Web Survey in order to provide updated measurements on the auto-power spectrum of the now resolved Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB) and its coherence with the unresolved soft Cosmic X-ray Background (CXB) observed by Chandra at z > 6. Maps of the CIB in the F277W and F444W NIRCam filters are constructed with sources fainter than AB mag = 25 and cross-correlated with the CXB in the [0.5-2] keV band. We find that on scales between 1 and 1000'' the CIB-CXB cross-power in both NIRCam filters is statistically significant with signal-to-noise ratios (S/N) of 4.80 and 6.20 respectively from redshifts 0 < z < 13. In our high-z (6 < z < 13) interval we find coherence in both filters with a S/N of 7.32 and 5.39 respectively. These results suggest that there are X-ray emitting galaxies resolved by JWST, including star-forming galaxies (SFGs) and active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We fit the large-scale biasing of the IR sources producing the CIB as a function of z with results consistent with prior measurements and place constraints on the CXB flux and biasing at low- and high-z. The CXB flux measurements presented in this study suggest that approximately 94% of the [0.5-2] keV CXB is resolved, and this value is consistent within 2$\sigma$ with the complete resolution of the [0.5-2] keV CXB.
#### ExoMiner++ on TESS with Transfer Learning from Kepler: Transit Classification and Vetting Catalog for 2-min Data

 - **Abstract**
 We present ExoMiner++, an enhanced deep learning model that builds on the success of ExoMiner to improve transit signal classification in 2-minute TESS data. ExoMiner++ incorporates additional diagnostic inputs, including periodogram, flux trend, difference image, unfolded flux, and spacecraft attitude control data, all of which are crucial for effectively distinguishing transit signals from more challenging sources of false positives. To further enhance performance, we leverage transfer learning from high-quality labeled data from the Kepler space telescope, mitigating the impact of TESS's noisier and more ambiguous labels. ExoMiner++ achieves high accuracy across various classification and ranking metrics, significantly narrowing the search space for follow-up investigations to confirm new planets. To serve the exoplanet community, we introduce new TESS catalogs containing ExoMiner++ classifications and confidence scores for each transit signal. Among the 147,568 unlabeled TCEs, ExoMiner++ identifies 7,330 as planet candidates, with the remainder classified as false positives. These 7,330 planet candidates correspond to 1,868 existing TESS Objects of Interest (TOIs), 69 Community TESS Objects of Interest (CTOIs), and 50 newly introduced CTOIs. 1,797 out of the 2,506 TOIs previously labeled as planet candidates in ExoFOP are classified as planet candidates by ExoMiner++. This reduction in plausible candidates combined with the excellent ranking quality of ExoMiner++ allows the follow-up efforts to be focused on the most likely candidates, increasing the overall planet yield.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the newly discovered dwarf galaxy Pegasus VII (Peg VII), a member of the M31 sub-group which has been uncovered in the $ri$ photometric catalogs from the Ultraviolet Near-Infrared Optical Northern Survey and confirmed with follow-up imaging from both the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope and the Gemini-North Telescope. This system has an absolute $V$-band magnitude of $-5.7 \pm 0.2$ mag and a physical half-light radius of $177^{+36}_{-34}$ pc, which is characteristic of dynamically-confirmed Milky Way satellite dwarf galaxies and about 5 times more extended than the most extended M31 globular clusters. Peg VII lies at a three-dimensional separation from M31 of $331^{+15}_{-4}$ kpc and a significant elongation ($\epsilon \sim 0.5$) towards the projected direction of M31 could be indicative of a past tidal interaction, but additional investigation into the orbit, star formation history, and whether any gas remains in the galaxy is needed to better understand the evolution of Peg VII.
#### A MaNGA view of isolated galaxy mergers in the star-forming Main Sequence

 - **Abstract**
 In this work we carry out an analysis of star-formation and nuclear activity in the different stages during a galaxy merger identified in isolated systems (isolated galaxies, isolated pairs, and isolated triplets) using integral field spectroscopy from the SDSS-IV/MaNGA project. We classify galaxies into close pairs, pre-mergers, mergers, and post-mergers (including galaxies with post-starburst spectroscopic features), for a total sample of 137 galaxies. We constrained their star formation history from spectro- photometric SED fitting with CIGALE, and used spatially resolved WHAN diagrams, with other MaNGA data products to explore if there is any connection of their physical properties with their merging stage. In general, galaxies show characteristic properties intrinsically related to each stage of the merger process. Galaxies in the merger and post-merger stages present higher star formation activity (measured by their integrated sSFR). In the merger stage, the fraction of strong AGN spaxels is comparable to the fraction of spaxels with pure star-formation emission, with no difference between AGN activity in close pairs and strongly interacting galaxies with the same stellar mass. Our results support the scenario where galaxy interactions trigger star-formation and nuclear activity on galaxies. Nonetheless, AGN has a minor role in quenching galaxies following a merger, as AGN feedback might not have had sufficient time to inhibit star formation. In addition, we found that the quenching process in post-mergers galaxies with post-starburst emission is happening outside-in, being an observational proof of the effect of interactions on the quenching process. The transforming processes after a recent major galaxy interaction may happen slowly on isolated environments, where the system evolves in a common dark matter halo without any perturbation of external galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 There is now a large sample of stars observed by the Kepler satellite with measured rotation periods and photometric activity index $S_{\rm ph}$. We use this data, in conjunction with stellar interiors models, to explore the interplay of magnetism, rotation, and convection. Stellar activity proxies other than $S_{\rm ph}$ are correlated with the Rossby number, $Ro$, or ratio of rotation period to convective overturn timescale. We compute the latter using the Yale Rotating Evolution Code stellar models. We observe different $S_{\rm ph}$-$Ro$ relationships for different stellar spectral types. Though the overall trend of decreasing magnetic activity versus $Ro$ is recovered, we find a localized dip in $S_{\rm ph}$ around $Ro/Ro_{\odot} \sim$\,0.3 for the G and K dwarfs. F dwarfs show little to no dependence of $S_{\rm ph}$ on $Ro$ due to their shallow convective zones; further accentuated as $T_{\rm eff}$ increases. The dip in activity for the G and K dwarfs corresponds to the intermediate rotation period gap, suggesting that the dip in $S_{\rm ph}$ could be associated with the redistribution of angular momentum between the core and convective envelope inside stars. For G-type stars, we observe enhanced magnetic activity above solar $Ro$. Compared to other Sun-like stars with similar effective temperature and metallicity, we find that the Sun's current level of magnetic activity is comparable to its peers and lies near the transition to increasing magnetic activity at high $Ro$. We confirm that metal-rich stars have a systematically larger $S_{\rm ph}$ level than metal-poor stars, which is likely a consequence of their deeper convective zones.
#### The Power Spectrum of the Thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich Effect

 - **Abstract**
 The power spectrum of unresolved thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) clusters is extremely sensitive to the amplitude of the matter fluctuations. This paper present an analysis of the tSZ power spectrum using temperature power spectra of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) rather than maps of the Compton y-parameter. Our analysis is robust and insensitive to the cosmic infrared background. Using data from Planck, and higher resolution CMB data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope and the South Pole Telescope, we find strong evidence that the tSZ spectrum has a shallower slope and a much lower amplitude at multipoles l > 2000$compared to the predictions of the FLAMINGO hydrodynamic simulations of the LCDM cosmology. Recent results on CMB lensing, cross-correlations of CMB lensing with galaxy surveys and full shape analysis of galaxies and quasars from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument suggests that this discrepancy cannot be resolved by lowering the amplitude of the matter fluctuations. An alternative possibility is that the impact of baryonic feedback in the FLAMINGO simulations is underestimated.
#### MICONIC: JWST Unveils Shocked Hot Core Chemistry in the Western Nucleus of Arp 220

 - **Abstract**
 We present full 3-28 micron JWST MIRI/MRS and NIRSpec/IFU spectra of the western nucleus of Arp 220, the nearest ultraluminous infrared galaxy. This nucleus has long been suggested to possibly host an embedded Compton-thick AGN. Millimeter observations of the dust continuum suggest the presence of a distinct 20 pc core with a dust temperature of $T_\mathrm{d} \gtrsim 500~\mathrm{K}$, in addition to a 100 pc circumnuclear starburst disk. However, unambiguously identifying the nature of this core is challenging, due to the immense obscuration, the nuclear starburst activity, and the nearby eastern nucleus. With the JWST integral field spectrographs, we can, for the first time, separate the two nuclei across this full wavelength range, revealing a wealth of molecular absorption features towards the western nucleus. We analyse the rovibrational bands detected at 4-22 micron, deriving column densities and rotational temperatures for 10 distinct species. Optically thick features of C$_2$H$_2$, HCN and HNC suggest that this molecular gas is hidden behind a curtain of cooler dust, and indicate that the column densities of C$_2$H$_2$ and HCN are an order of magnitude higher than previously derived from Spitzer observations. We identify a warm HCN component with rotational temperature $T_\mathrm{rot} = 330~\mathrm{K}$, which we associate with radiative excitation by the hot inner nucleus. We propose a geometry where the detected molecular gas is located in the inner regions of the starburst disk, directly surrounding the hot 20 parsec core. The chemical footprint of the western nucleus is reminiscent of that of hot cores, with additional evidence for shocks. No evidence for the presence of an AGN in the form of X-ray-driven chemistry or extreme excitation is found.
