 - **Abstract**
 Low-field magnetars have dipolar magnetic fields that are 10-100 times weaker than the threshold, $B \gtrsim 10^{14}$ G, used to define classical magnetars, yet they produce similar X-ray bursts and outbursts. Using the first direct numerical simulations of magneto-thermal evolution starting from a dynamo-generated magnetic field, we show that the low-field magnetars can be produced as a result of a Tayler--Spruit dynamo inside the proto-neutron star. We find that these simulations naturally explain key characteristics of low-field magnetars: (1) weak ($\lesssim 10^{13}$ G) dipolar magnetic fields, (2) strong small-scale fields, and (3) magnetically induced crustal failures producing X-ray bursts. These findings suggest two distinct formation channels for classical and low-field magnetars, potentially linked to different dynamo mechanisms.

 - **Abstract**
 We present deep Magellan$+$Megacam imaging of Centaurus I (Cen I) and Eridanus IV (Eri IV), two recently discovered Milky Way ultra-faint satellites. Our data reach $\sim2-3$ magnitudes deeper than the discovery data from the DECam Local Volume Exploration (DELVE) Survey. We use these data to constrain their distances, structural properties (e.g., half-light radii, ellipticity, and position angle), and luminosities. We investigate whether these systems show signs of tidal disturbance, and identify new potential member stars using Gaia EDR3. Our deep color-magnitude diagrams show that Cen I and Eri IV are consistent with an old ($\tau\sim 13.0$ Gyr) and metal-poor ($\text{[Fe/H]}\le-2.2$) stellar population. We find Cen I to have a half-light radius of $r_{h}=2.60\pm0.30'$ ($90.6\pm11$ pc), an ellipticity of $\epsilon=0.36\pm0.05$, a distance of $D=119.8\pm4.1$ kpc ($m-M=20.39\pm0.08$ mag), and an absolute magnitude of $M_{V}=-5.39\pm0.19$. Similarly, Eri IV has $r_{h}=3.24\pm0.48'$ ($65.9\pm10$ pc), $\epsilon=0.26\pm0.09$, $D=69.9\pm3.6$ kpc ($m-M=19.22\pm0.11$ mag), and $M_{V}=-3.55\pm0.24$. These systems occupy a space on the size-luminosity plane consistent with other known Milky Way dwarf galaxies which supports the findings from our previous spectroscopic follow-up. Cen I has a well-defined morphology which lacks any clear evidence of tidal disruption, whereas Eri IV hosts a significant extended feature with multiple possible interpretations.
#### Constraining $\gamma$-ray dissipation site in gravitationally lensed quasar -- PKS 1830$-$211

 - **Abstract**
 Variable $\gamma$-ray flares upto minute timescales reflect extreme particle acceleration sites. However, for high-redshift blazars, the detection of such rapid variations remains limited by current telescope sensitivities. Gravitationally lensed blazars serve as powerful tools to probe $\gamma$-ray production zones in distant sources, with time delays between lensed signals providing crucial insights into the spatial distribution of emission regions relative to the lens's mass-weighted center. We have utilized 15 years of Fermi-LAT $\gamma$-ray data from direction of PKS 1830$-$211 to understand the origin of flaring high-energy production zone at varying flux states. To efficiently estimate the (lensed) time delay, we used a machine learning-based tool - the Gaussian Process regression algorithm, in addition to - Autocorrelation function and Double power spectrum. We found a consistent time delay across all flaring activity states, indicating a similar location for the $\gamma$-ray emission zone, possibly within the radio core. The estimated time delay of approximately 20 days for the five flaring epochs was significantly shorter than previously estimated radio delays. This suggests that the $\gamma$-ray emission zone is closer to the central engine, in contrast to the radio emission zone, which is expected to be much farther away. A linear relationship between lag and magnification has been observed in the identified source and echo flares. Our results suggest that the $\gamma$-ray emission zone originates from similar regions away from the site of radio dissipation.

 - **Abstract**
 In binary star systems, mass transfer can spin up the accretor, possibly leading to efficient chemical mixing and chemically quasi-homogeneous evolution (CHE). Here, we explore the effects of accretion-induced CHE on both stellar populations and their compact binary remnants with the state-of-the-art population synthesis code SEVN. We find that CHE efficiently enhances the formation of Wolf-Rayet stars (WRs) from secondary stars, which are spun-up by accretion, while simultaneously preventing their evolution into red supergiant stars (RSGs). Including CHE in our models increases the fraction of WRs in our stellar sample by nearly a factor of $\approx3$ at low metallicity ($Z=0.001$). WRs formed through CHE are, on average, more massive and luminous than those formed without CHE. Most WRs formed via CHE end their life as black holes. As a direct consequence, the CHE mechanism enhances the formation of binary black holes (BBHs) and black hole-neutron star (BHNS) systems, while simultaneously quenching the production of binary neutron stars (BNSs). However, CHE significantly quenches the merger rate of BBHs, BHNSs and BNSs at low metallicity ($Z\leq{}0.004$), because most binary compact objects formed via CHE have large orbital periods. For instance, the number of BBH and BHNS mergers decreases by one order of magnitude at $Z=0.004$ in the CHE model compared to the standard scenario. Finally, we find that secondary stars experiencing CHE frequently produce the most massive compact object in the binary system. In BHNSs, this implies that the black hole progenitor is the secondary star. Conversely, BBHs formed through accretion-induced CHE likely have asymmetric black hole components, but only a negligible fraction of these asymmetric systems ultimately merge within an Hubble time.

 - **Abstract**
 Geodetic and astrometric VLBI has entered a new era with the implementation of the VLBI Global Observing System (VGOS). These broadband and dual linear polarization observations aim at an accuracy of station coordinates of 1 mm and a reference frame stability of 0.1 mm/year. Although the extended brightness distribution of many of the radio-loud active galactic nuclei observed during geodetic VLBI sessions is resolved by the interferometer, the established processing chain still treats these objects as point sources. We investigate the impact of source structure on the visibility level and develop tools to remove the structure from the visibility data, right after correlation. Here we present our approach and show results obtained from observational VGOS data.

 - **Abstract**
 A variety of high-energy astrophysical phenomena are powered by the release -- via magnetic reconnection -- of the energy stored in oppositely directed fields. Single-fluid resistive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations with uniform resistivity yield dissipation rates that are much lower (by nearly one order of magnitude) than equivalent kinetic calculations. Reconnection-driven phenomena could be accordingly modeled in resistive MHD employing a non-uniform, ``effective'' resistivity informed by kinetic calculations. In this work, we analyze a suite of fully kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of relativistic pair-plasma reconnection -- where the magnetic energy is greater than the rest mass energy -- for different strengths of the guide field orthogonal to the alternating component. We extract an empirical prescription for the effective resistivity, $\eta_{\mathrm{eff}} = \alpha B_0 \mathbf{|J|}^p / \left(|\mathbf{J}|^{p+1}+\left(e n_t c\right)^{p+1}\right)$, where $B_0$ is the reconnecting magnetic field strength, $\bf J$ is the current density, $n_t$ the lab-frame total number density, $e$ the elementary charge, and $c$ the speed of light. The guide field dependence is encoded in $\alpha$ and $p$, which we fit to PIC data. This resistivity formulation -- which relies only on single-fluid MHD quantities -- successfully reproduces the spatial structure and strength of nonideal electric fields, and thus provides a promising strategy for enhancing the reconnection rate in resistive MHD simulations.
#### Mind the Gap II: the near-UV fluxes of M dwarfs

 - **Abstract**
 Because of the continuous variations in mass, metallicity, and opacity, dwarf stars are distributed along the main sequence on optical and near-IR color-magnitude diagrams following a smooth polynomial. In this study of utilizing a catalog of cross-matched GALEX and Gaia sources, we identify two distinct populations of M dwarfs in the near-ultraviolet (NUV) band on the $M_{NUV}$ vs. $M_G$ diagram. We also reveal a pronounced increase in the number of stars exhibiting high NUV fluxes near the spectral type M2 or $M_G\sim9.4$, coinciding with the $H_2$ formation in the atmosphere to improve the energy transportation at the surface. This suggests that certain yet-to-be-understood stellar mechanisms drive heightened activity in the NUV band around the effective temperature of M2 and later types of M dwarfs. Through examination of archival Hubble Space Telescope spectra, we show that Fe II line forests at $\sim$2400A and 2800A dominate the spectral features in the GALEX NUV bandpass, contributing to the observed excess fluxes at a given mass between the two populations. Additionally, our investigation indicates that fast rotators and young stars likely increase brightness in the NUV band, but not all stars with bright NUV fluxes are fast rotators or young stars.

 - **Abstract**
 The solar cycle is a complex phenomenon. To comprehensively understand it, we have to study various tracers. The most important component of this complex is the solar dynamo, which is understood as self-excitation of the solar magnetic field in the form of traveling waves somewhere in the convection zone. Along with the solar dynamo, the formation of the solar cycle involves other processes that are associated with the dynamo but are not its necessary part. We give a review of such phenomena that have not yet been explained in terms of dynamo theory. We consider the manifestations of the solar cycle in harmonics of the solar large-scale surface magnetic field, including zonal, sectorial, and tesseral harmonics; analyze their contribution to magnetic energy; and identify phases of the activity cycle using harmonics of different types of symmetry. The universal magnetic scenario of a solar activity cycle does not depend on its number and height. At the beginning of the cycle on the photosphere, the zonal harmonics account for 37-42% of the total energy (not 100%, as assumed in simplified descriptions). Sectorial harmonics do not disappear at all but account for 5-10% of the total energy. At this stage, the greatest energy (about 40%) is contained in the tesseral harmonics. As the cycle develops, the relative energy of zonal harmonics gradually decreases, reaching a minimum of 15-18% immediately before the onset of the sunspot maximum. The relative energy of sectorial harmonics increases and reaches a maximum (60-65%) somewhat later than the calendar date of the sunspot maximum. A particular feature of the tesseral harmonics is that their relative energy index changes in a much narrower range and never falls below 40% even at the cycle minimum. This is due to active regions and nonglobal magnetic fields. It is possible that tesseral harmonics are formed in shallow subphotospheric layers.

 - **Abstract**
 Photoevaporation in exoplanet atmospheres is thought to contribute to the shaping of the small planet radius valley. Escaping atmospheres have been detected in transmission across a variety of exoplanet types, from hot Jupiters to mini-Neptunes. However, no work has yet considered whether outflows might also be detectable in emission. We introduce pyTPCI, a new, open-source self-consistent 1D radiative-hydrodynamics code that is an improved version of The PLUTO-CLOUDY Interface. We use pyTPCI to model seven exoplanets (HD 189733b, HD 209458b, WASP-69b, WASP-107b, TOI-1430b, TOI-560b, and HAT-P-32b) at varying metallicities and compute their emission spectra to investigate their detectability across a variety of spectral lines. We calculate the eclipse depths and signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) of these lines for a 10m class telescope with a high-resolution spectrograph, taking into account appropriate line broadening mechanisms. We show that the most detectable spectral lines tend to be the 589 nm Na I doublet and the 1083 nm metastable helium triplet. Halpha and Mg I 457 nm are moderately strong for some planets at some metallicities, but they are almost always optically thin, so some of their emission may not be from the outflow. The planet with the highest-flux, highest-eclipse-depth, and highest-SNR lines is HD 189733b, with a Na I eclipse depth of 410 ppm and SNR of 2.4 per eclipse, and a He* eclipse depth of 170 ppm and SNR of 1.3. These signals would be marginally detectable with Keck if 3-10 eclipses were observed, assuming (over-optimistically) photon limited observations.
#### Parallactic delay for geodetic VLBI and non-orthogonality of the fundamental axes

 - **Abstract**
 The Gaia optical astrometric mission has measured the precise positions of millions of objects in the sky, including extragalactic sources also observed by Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI). In the recent Gaia EDR3 release, an effect of negative parallax with a magnitude of approximately -17 $\mu$as was reported, presumably due to technical reasons related to the relativistic delay model. A recent analysis of a 30-year set of geodetic VLBI data revealed a similar negative parallax with an amplitude of $-15.8 \pm 0.5$ $ \mu$as. Since both astrometric techniques, optical and radio, provide consistent estimates of this negative parallax, it is necessary to investigate the potential origin of this effect. We developed the extended group relativistic delay model to incorporate the additional parallactic effect for radio sources at distances less than 1 Mpc and found that the apparent annual signal might appear due the non-orthogonality of the fundamental axes, which are defined by the positions of the reference radio sources themselves. Unlike the conventional parallactic ellipse, the apparent annual effect in this case appears as a circular motion for all objects independently of their ecliptic latitude. The measured amplitude of this circular effect is within a range of 10-15 $\mu$as that is consistent with the ICRF3 stability of the fundamental axis. This annual circular effect could also arise if a Gödel-type cosmological metric were applied, suggesting that, in the future, this phenomenon could be used to indicate global cosmic rotation.
#### GRB 241030A: a prompt thermal X-ray emission component and diverse origin of the very early UVOT WHITE and U band emission

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed analysis of the long-duration GRB 241030A detected by {\it Swift}. Thanks to the rapid response of XRT and UVOT, the strongest part of the prompt emission of GRB 241030A has been well measured simultaneously from optical to hard X-ray band. The time-resolved WHITE band emission shows strong variability, largely tracing the activity of the prompt gamma-ray emission, may be produced by internal shocks too. The joint analysis of the XRT and BAT data reveals the presence of a thermal component with a temperature of a few keV, which can be interpreted as the photosphere radiation, and the upper limit of the Lorentz factor of this region is found to range between approximately 20 and 80. The time-resolved analysis of the initial U-band exposure data yields a very rapid rise ($ \sim t^{5.3}$) with a bright peak reaching 13.6 AB magnitude around 410 seconds, which is most likely attributed to the onset of the external shock emission. The richness and fineness of early observational data have made this burst a unique sample for studying the various radiation mechanisms of gamma-ray bursts.

 - **Abstract**
 Radio observations can provide crucial insight into the nature of a new abundant and mysterious population of dust-reddened active galactic nuclei (AGN) candidates discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), including ``Little Red Dots" (LRDs). In this study, we search for radio bright sources in a large sample of $\sim$700 JWST discovered AGN candidates ($z\sim2-11$) in the 0.144-3 GHz frequency range, utilizing deep radio imaging in COSMOS, GOODS-N, and GOODS-S. Only one source is significantly detected in our radio surveys, which is PRIMER-COS 3866 at $z=4.66$. Its radio properties are consistent with both an AGN and star formation origin with a spectral index of $\alpha=-0.76^{+0.11}_{-0.09}$ and a radio-loudness of $R\approx0.5$. The derived brightness temperature limit of PRIMER-COS 3866 of $T_b \gtrsim 10^{3}$ K is too low to confirm its AGN nature. Our stacking results yield non-detections in all fields with the most constraining 3$\sigma$ limit $L_{1.3\text{GHz}} < 1.3\times10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (rms of $\sim$0.15 $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ at $z_{\text{median}}=6.1$) obtained for photometrically selected AGN candidates in the COSMOS field. This result is still consistent with expectations from the empirical $L_X - L_{\text{H}\alpha}$ and $L_X - L_R$ correlations established for local AGN. We conclude that current radio observations have insufficient depth to claim JWST discovered AGN candidates are radio-weak. We project that future surveys carried out by the SKA and ngVLA should be able to obtain significant detections within a few hours, providing crucial measurements of their brightness temperature, which would allow for distinguishing between AGN and starburst-driven origins of this new abundant population.
#### Peculiar radio-bright behaviour of the Galactic black hole transient 4U 1543-47 in the 2021-2023 outburst

 - **Abstract**
 Correlated behaviours between the radio emission and the X-ray emission in Galactic black hole X-ray binaries (BH XRBs) in the X-ray hard state are crucial to the understanding of disc-jet coupling of accreting black holes. The BH transient 4U 1543-47 went into outburst in 2021 following ~19 years of quiescence. We followed it up with ~weekly cadence with MeerKAT for about one year and a half until it faded into quiescence. Multi-epoch quasi-simultaneous MeerKAT and X-ray observations allowed us to trace the compact jet emission and its X-ray emission. In its hard spectral state across three orders of magnitude of X-ray luminosities above ~10$^{34}$ ergs/s, we found the correlation between radio and X-ray emission had a power-law index of 0.82$\pm$0.09, steeper than the canonical value of ~0.6 for BH XRBs. In addition, the radio vs. X-ray correlation shows a large range of the power-law normalization, with the maximum significantly larger than that obtained for most BH XRBs, indicating it can be particularly radio-bright and variable in the X-ray binary sample. The radio emission is unlikely diluted by discrete jet components. The observed peculiar radio-bright and variable behaviours provide the evidence for the relativistic effects of a variable Lorentz factor in the range between 1 and ~2 of the compact jet.

 - **Abstract**
 $r$-mode oscillations in rotating neutron stars are a source of continuous gravitational radiation. We investigate the excitation of $r$-modes by the mechanical impact on the neutron star surface of stochastically accreted clumps of matter, assuming that the Chandrasekhar-Friedman-Schutz instability is not triggered. The star is idealised as a slowly-rotating, unmagnetised, one-component fluid with a barotropic equation of state in Newtonian gravity. It is found that the $r$-mode amplitude depends weakly on the equation of state but sensitively on the rotation frequency $\nu_{\rm s}$. The gravitational wave strain implicitly depends on the equation of state through the damping timescale. The root-mean-square strain is $h_{\rm rms} \approx 10^{-35} (\nu_{\rm s}/ 10 {\rm Hz})^{2} (R_*/10 {\rm km})^2 (\Delta t_{\rm acc}/1 {\rm yr})^{1/2} (f_{\rm acc}/1 {\rm kHz})^{-1/2} (\dot{M}/10^{-8} \text{M}_{\odot} \text{yr}^{-1}) (v/0.4c) (d/1 {\rm kpc})^{-1}$, which is comparable to the strain from $g$-, $p$- and $f$-modes excited by stochastic accretion, where $R_*$ is the radius of the star, $\Delta t_{\rm acc}$ is the uninterrupted duration of an accretion episode, $f_{\rm acc}$ is the mean clump impact frequency, $\dot{M}$ is the accretion rate, $v$ is the impact speed, and $d$ is the distance of the star from the Earth. An observational test is proposed, based on the temporal autocorrelation function of the gravitational wave signal, to discern whether the Chandrasekhar-Friedman-Schutz instability switches on and coexists with impact-excited $r$-modes before or during a gravitational wave observation.

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of cosmic rays (CRs) and how they propagate remain unclear. Studying the propagation of CRs in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence can help to comprehend many open issues related to CR origin and the role of turbulent magnetic fields. To comprehend the phenomenon of slow diffusion in the near-source region, we study the interactions of CRs with the ambient turbulent magnetic field to reveal their universal laws. We numerically study the interactions of CRs with the ambient turbulent magnetic field, considering pulsar wind nebula as a general research case. Taking the magnetization parameter and turbulence spectral index as free parameters, together with radiative losses, we perform three group simulations to analyze the CR spectral, spatial distributions, and possible CR diffusion types. Our studies demonstrate that (1) CR energy density decays with both its effective radius and kinetic energy in the form of power-law distributions; (2) the morphology of the CR spatial distribution strongly depends on the properties of magnetic turbulence and the viewing angle; (3) CRs suffer a slow diffusion near the source and a fast/normal diffusion away from the source; (4) the existence of a power-law relationship between the averaged CR energy density and the magnetization parameter is independent of both CR energy and radiative losses; (5) radiative losses can suppress CR anisotropic diffusion and soften the power-law distribution of CR energy density. The distribution law established between turbulent magnetic fields and CRs presents an intrinsic property, providing a convenient way to understand complex astrophysical processes related to turbulence cascades.

 - **Abstract**
 The global rotational profile of the solar atmosphere and its variation at different layers, although crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics of the solar magnetic field, has been a subject to contradictory results throughout the past century. In this study, we thereby unify the results for different parts of the multi-thermal Solar atmosphere by utilizing 13 years of data in 7 wavelength channels of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) atop the Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO). Using the method of image correlation, we find that the solar atmosphere exhibits a rotational profile that is up to 4.18% and 1.92% faster at the equator and comparatively less differential than that of the photosphere, as derived from Doppler measurements and sunspots, respectively and exhibits variation at different respective heights. Additionally, we find results suggestive of the role played by the rooting of different magnetic field structures on a comparison with helioseismology data.

 - **Abstract**
 The solar chromosphere exhibits a variety of waves originating from the photosphere and deeper layers, causing oscillations at different heights with distinct frequencies. This study identifies and analyze Atmospheric Gravity Waves (AGWs) and acoustic waves at various height pairs within the solar atmosphere utilising H$\alpha$, Ca II IR and Fe I 6173 A imaging spectroscopic observations from Swedish 1m Solar Telescope. We study and compare oscillations by analyzing power maps generated using velocities obtained from the filtergram difference and bisector methods. Our analysis shows a consistent increase in power with height in the solar chromosphere for both methods. In addition to this, our results show that AGWs are detected within or near magnetic flux concentration regions, where spicules are also predominant, exhibiting significant power in the chromosphere. These regions also feature inclined magnetic fields, which might be contributing to the propagation of these low-frequency AGWs in the chromosphere. Examining average power maps at spicule locations reveals significant power at AGWs frequency across different chromospheric heights. We speculate that these AGWs propagate upward along spicular structures and were not previously detected in the studies employing space-time map due to their limited lifetime. This study provides insights into the complex dynamics of solar chromospheric waves influenced by magnetic field, contributing to our understanding of AGWs and acoustic waves propagation across different layers of the solar atmosphere.

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce a novel galaxy classification methodology based on the visible spectra of a sample of over 68,000 nearby ($z\leq 0.1$) Sloan Digital Sky Survey lenticular (S0) galaxies. Unlike traditional diagnostic diagrams, which rely on a limited set of emission lines and class dividers to identify ionizing sources, our approach provides a comprehensive framework for characterizing galaxies regardless of their activity level. By projecting galaxies into the 2D latent space defined by the first three principal components (PCs) of their entire visible spectra, our method remains robust even when data from individual emission lines are missing. We employ Gaussian kernel density estimates of the classical Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) activity classes in the new classification subspace, adjusted according to their relative abundance in our S0 sample, to generate probability maps for star-forming, Seyfert, composite, and LINER galaxies. These maps closely mirror the canonical distribution of BPT classes shown by the entire galaxy population, demonstrating that our PC-based taxonomy effectively predicts the dominant ionizing mechanisms through a probabilistic approach that provides a realistic reflection of galaxy activity and allows for refined class membership. Our analysis further reveals that flux-limited BPT-like diagrams are inherently biased against composite and star-forming galaxies due to their weaker [OIII] emission. Besides, it suggests that although most low-activity galaxies excluded from these diagnostics exhibit visual spectra with LINER-like characteristics, their remaining activity is likely driven by mechanisms unrelated to either star formation or supermassive black hole accretion. A machine-readable catalogue listing BPT-class probabilities for the galaxies analysed is available online at the CDS website.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel visualization application designed to explore the time-dependent development of magnetic fields of neutron stars. The strongest magnetic fields in the universe can be found within neutron stars, potentially playing a role in initiating astrophysical jets and facilitating the outflow of neutron-rich matter, ultimately resulting in the production of heavy elements during binary neutron star mergers. Since such effects may be dependent on the strength and configuration of the magnetic field, the formation and parameters of such fields are part of current research in astrophysics. Magnetic fields are investigated using simulations in which various initial configurations are tested. However, the long-term configuration is an open question, and current simulations do not achieve a stable magnetic field. Neutron star simulations produce data quantities in the range of several terabytes, which are both spatially in 3D and temporally resolved. Our tool enables physicists to interactively explore the generated data. We first convert the data in a pre-processing step and then we combine sparse vector field visualization using streamlines with dense vector field visualization using line integral convolution. We provide several methods to interact with the data responsively. This allows the user to intuitively investigate data-specific issues. Furthermore, diverse visualization techniques facilitate individual exploration of the data and enable real-time processing of specific domain tasks, like the investigation of the time-dependent evolution of the magnetic field. In a qualitative study, domain experts tested the tool, and the usability was queried. Experts rated the tool very positively and recommended it for their daily work.

 Aims: We aim to better characterize the conditions of the solar corona and especially with respect to the occurrence of confined and eruptive flares. Therefore, we have modeled the coronal evolution around 231 large flares observed during solar cycle 24. Methods: Using Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager vector magnetic field data around each event, we employ nonlinear force-free field extrapolations to approximate the coronal energy and helicity budgets of the solar source regions. Superposed epoch analysis and dynamical time warping applied to the time series of selected photospheric and coronal quantities is used to pin down the characteristics of the pre- and post-flare time evolution, as well as to assess flare-related changes. Results: (1) During the 24 hours leading to a major flare, the total magnetic energy and unsigned magnetic flux evolve closely with respect to each other, irrespective of the flare type. Prior to confined flares the free energy evolves more similar with respect to the unsigned flux than the helicity of the current-carrying field, while it is the opposite prior to eruptive flares. (2) The flare type can be predicted correctly in more than 90\% of major flares when combining measures of the active regions nonpotentiality and local stability. (3) The coronal energy and helicity budgets return to preflare levels within $\approx$\,6 to 12~hours after eruptive major M-class flares while the impact of eruptive X-flares lasts considerably longer. (4) Postflare replenishment times of $\gtrsim$12~hours after eruptive X-class flares may serve as a partial explanation for the rare observation of eruptive X-class flares within a few hours.

 - **Abstract**
 In recent years the chemistry of sulfur in the interstellar medium has experienced a renewed interest due to the detection of a large variety of molecules containing sulfur. Here we report the first identification in space of a new S-bearing molecule, thioacetaldehyde (CH3CHS), which is the sulfur counterpart of acetaldehyde (CH3CHO). The astronomical observations are part of QUIJOTE, a Yebes 40m Q band line survey of the cold dense cloud TMC-1. We detected seven individual lines corresponding to A and E components of the four most favorable rotational transitions of CH3CHS covered in the Q band (31.0-50.3 GHz). Assuming a rotational temperature of 9 K, we derive a column density of 9.8e10 cm-2 for CH3CHS, which implies that it is 36 times less abundant than its oxygen counterpart CH3CHO. By comparing the column densities of the O- and S-bearing molecules detected in TMC-1, we find that as molecules increase their degree of hydrogenation, sulfur-bearing molecules become less abundant compared to their oxygen analog. That is, hydrogenation seems to be less favored for S-bearing molecules than for O-bearing ones in cold sources like TMC-1. We explored potential formation pathways to CH3CHS and implemented them into a chemical model, which however underestimates by several orders of magnitude the observed abundance of thioacetaldehyde. Quantum chemical calculations carried out for one of the potential formation pathways, the S + C2H5 reaction, indicate that formation of CH3CHS is only a minor channel in this reaction.
#### A possible formation scenario of the Gaia ID 3425577610762832384: inner binary merger inside a triple common envelope

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, an identified non-interacting black hole (BH) binary, Gaia ID 3425577610762832384 (hereafter G3425), contains a BH ($\sim$3.6 M$_{\odot}$) falling within the mass gap and has a nearly circular orbit, challenging the classical binary evolution and supernova theory. Here, we propose that G3425 originates from a triple through a triple common envelope (TCE) evolution. The G3425 progenitor originally may consist of three stars with masses of 1.49 M$_{\odot}$, 1.05 M$_{\odot}$, and 21.81 M$_{\odot}$, and inner and outer orbital periods of 4.22 days and 1961.78 days, respectively. As evolution proceeds, the tertiary fills its Roche lobe, leading to a TCE. We find that the orbital energy generated by the inspiral of the inner binary serves as an additional energy imparted for ejecting the common envelope (CE), accounting for $\sim$97\% of the binding energy in our calculations. This means that the outer orbit needs to expend only a small amount of the orbital energy to successfully eject CE. The outcome of the TCE is a binary consisting of a 2.54 M$_\odot$ merger produced by the inner binary merger and a 7.67 M$_\odot$ helium star whose CE successfully ejected, with an orbital period of 547.53 days. The resulting post-TCE binary (PTB) has an orbital period that is 1-2 orders of magnitude greater than the orbital period of a successfully ejected classical binary CE. In subsequent simulations, we find that the successfully ejected helium star has a 44.2\% probability of forming a BH. In the case of a non-complete fallback forming a BH, with an ejected mass of 2.6 M$_{\odot}$ and a relatively low natal kick ($11^{+16}_{-5}$ ${\rm km/s}$ to $49^{+39}_{-39}$ ${\rm km/s}$), this PTB can form G3425 in the Milky Way.

 - **Abstract**
 We present high-resolution e-MERLIN and EVN (e-VLBI) observations of a radio source associated with Dyson Sphere candidate G, identified as part of Project Hephaistos. The radio source, VLASS J233532.86-000424.9, is resolved into 3 compact components and shows the typical characteristics of a radio-loud AGN. In particular, the EVN observations show that it has a brightness temperature in excess of $10^{8}$~K. No radio emission is detected at the position of the M-dwarf star. This result confirms our earlier hypothesis, that at least some of the Dyson Sphere candidates of project Hephaistos are contaminated by obscured, background AGN, lying close to the line of sight of otherwise normal galactic stars. High-resolution radio observations of other Dyson Sphere candidates can be useful in distinguishing truly promising candidates from those contaminated by background sources.

 - **Abstract**
 Most stars form in dense clusters within high-mass star-forming regions, where protoplanetary disks may be exposed to intense UV radiation from nearby massive stars. While previous studies have typically focused on isolated sources in low-mass regions, recent observational campaigns have started to probe the chemistry of irradiated disks in unprecedented detail. Interpreting this data requires complex chemical models, yet few studies have examined these disks' chemistry, and none have incorporated the photoevaporative wind launched by external UV fields into their physical structure. In this study, we post-process radiation hydrodynamics simulations of externally irradiated protoplanetary disks using the thermochemical code DALI, comparing models with and without the wind to assess its impact on disk chemistry. Results show that UV radiation is rapidly attenuated by the disk in both cases. However, thermal re-emission from the wind at longer wavelengths enhances disk heating, increasing the gas-phase abundances of some key volatiles. Synthetic line fluxes vary by orders of magnitude between wind and windless models, primarily due to emission from the wind itself rather than abundance variations within the disk. Our findings demonstrate that the photoevaporative wind significantly influences the physical and chemical structure, and observational characteristics, of externally irradiated disks. We conclude that incorporating the wind into chemical models is essential for accurately predicting chemical abundances, interpreting observations, and ultimately understanding planet formation in these common yet complex environments.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the confirmation of a compact galaxy group candidate, CGG-z4, at $z=4.3$ in the COSMOS field. This structure was identified by two spectroscopically confirmed $z=4.3$ $K_s$-dropout galaxies with ALMA $870\rm\, \mu m$ and 3 mm continuum detections, surrounded by an overdensity of NIR-detected galaxies with consistent photometric redshifts of $4.0<z<4.6$. The two ALMA sources, CGG-z4.a and CGG-z4.b, are detected with both CO(4-3) and CO(5-4) lines. [CI](1-0) is detected on CGG-z4.a, and H$_{2}$O($1_{1,0}-1_{0,1}$) absorption is detected on CGG-z4.b. We model an integrated spectral energy distribution by combining the FIR-to-radio photometry of this group and estimate a total star formation rate of $\rm\sim2000\, M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, making it one of the most star-forming groups known at $z>4$. Their high CO(5-4)/CO(4-3) ratios indicate that the inter-stellar mediums (ISMs) are close to thermalization, suggesting either high gas temperatures, densities, and/or pressure, while the low [CI](1-0)/CO(4-3) line ratios indicate high star formation efficiencies. With [CI]-derived gas masses we found the two galaxies have extremely short gas depletion times of $99$ Myr and $<63$ Myr respectively, suggesting the onset of quenching. With an estimated halo mass of $\rm log (M_{\rm halo}[M_{\odot}])\sim12.8$, we suggest that this structure is likely in the process of forming a massive galaxy cluster.

 - **Abstract**
 Rotation deeply impacts the structure and the evolution of stars. To build coherent 1D or multi-D stellar structure and evolution models, we must systematically evaluate the turbulent transport of momentum and matter induced by hydrodynamical instabilities of radial and latitudinal differential rotation in stably stratified thermally diffusive stellar radiation zones. In this work, we investigate vertical shear instabilities in these regions. The full Coriolis acceleration with the complete rotation vector at a general latitude is taken into account. We formulate the problem by considering a canonical shear flow with a hyperbolic-tangent profile. We perform linear stability analysis on this base flow using both numerical and asymptotic Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin-Jeffreys (WKBJ) methods. Two types of instabilities are identified and explored: inflectional instability, which occurs in the presence of an inflection point in shear flow, and inertial instability due to an imbalance between the centrifugal acceleration and pressure gradient. Both instabilities are promoted as thermal diffusion becomes stronger or stratification becomes weaker. Effects of the full Coriolis acceleration are found to be more complex according to parametric investigations in wide ranges of colatitudes and rotation-to-shear and rotation-to-stratification ratios. Also, new prescriptions for the vertical eddy viscosity are derived to model the turbulent transport triggered by each instability. We foresee that the inflectional instability will be responsible for turbulent transport in the equatorial region of strongly-stratified radiative zones in slowly rotating stars while the inertial instability triggers turbulence in the polar regions of weakly-stratified radiative zones in fast-rotating stars.
#### Resolving an Asteroseismic Catastrophe: Structural Diagnostics from p-mode Phase Functions off the Main Sequence

 - **Abstract**
 On the main sequence, the asteroseismic small frequency separation $\delta\nu_{02}$ between radial and quadrupole p-modes is customarily interpreted to be a direct diagnostic of internal structure. Such an interpretation is based on a well-known integral estimator relating $\delta\nu_{02}$ to a radially-averaged sound-speed gradient. However, this estimator fails, catastrophically, when evaluated on structural models of red giants: their small separations must therefore be interpreted differently. We derive a single expression which both reduces to the classical estimator when applied to main-sequence stellar models, yet reproduces the qualitative features of the small separation for stellar models of very evolved red giants. This expression indicates that the small separations of red giants scale primarily with their global seismic properties as $\delta\nu_{02} \propto \Delta\nu^2/\nu_\mathrm{max}$, rather than being in any way sensitive to their internal structure. Departures from this asymptotic behaviour, during the transition from the main-sequence to red giant regimes, have been recently reported in open-cluster Christensen-Dalsgaard (C-D) diagrams from K2 mission data. Investigating them in detail, we demonstrate that they occur when the convective envelope boundary passes a specific acoustic distance -- roughly a third of a wavelength at $\nu_\mathrm{max}$ -- from the centre of the star, at which point radial modes become maximally sensitive to the position of the boundary. The shape of the corresponding features on $\epsilon_p$ and C-D (or $r_{02}$) diagrams may be useful in constraining the nature of convective boundary mixing, in the context of undershooting beneath a convective envelope.

 We highlight the potential benefits of a synergistic use of SKAO and ESO facilities for galaxy evolution studies, focusing on the role that ESO spectroscopic surveys can play in supporting next-generation radio continuum and atomic hydrogen (HI) surveys. More specifically we illustrate the role that currently available or soon to be operational ESO multiplex spectrographs can play for three classes of projects: large/deep redshift survey campaigns, integral field unit/Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (IFU/ALMA) surveys of selected regions of sky, and IFU/ALMA follow-ups of selected samples. We conclude with some general recommendations for an efficient joint exploitation of ESO-SKAO surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 To power gamma-ray bursts and other high-energy events, large-scale magnetic fields are required to extract rotational energy from compact objects such as black holes and neutron stars. The magnetorotational instability (MRI) is a key mechanism for angular momentum transport and large-scale magnetic field amplification. Recent work has begun to address the regime of high magnetic Prandtl number $\mathrm{Pm}$, the ratio of viscosity to resistivity, in which angular momentum and magnetic energy increase with $\mathrm{Pm}$. This regime reveals unique dynamics of small-scale turbulence in disk mid-planes and buoyancy instabilities in the atmosphere. This study aims to build on these findings, focusing on the MRI-driven $\alpha\Omega$ dynamo in stratified simulations to understand magnetic field generation in the high-$\mathrm{Pm}$ regime. We analyze data taken from stratified shearing box simulations both in the regime of magnetic Prandtl number of order unity, and also in the high $\mathrm{Pm}$ regime employing new techniques to compute the dynamo coefficients. We find that the mean-magnetic field evolution can be described by an $\alpha\Omega$ dynamo, even in the high-Pm regime. The mean magnetic field as well as the dynamo coefficients increase with Pm. This leads to a shorter dynamo period and a faster growth rate. We also find that the off-diagonal coefficients have an impact on the propagation of the magnetic field in the dynamo region. Overall, the magnetic field amplification found in global simulations should be increased by at least a factor of $\sim 5$, which could lead to more powerful jets and stronger winds from astrophysical disks in the high-Pm regime.

 - **Abstract**
 The bispectrum of galaxy number counts is a key probe of large-scale structure (LSS), offering insights into the initial conditions of the Universe, the nature of gravity, and cosmological parameters. In this work, we derive the theoretical angular bispectrum of number counts for the first time without relying on the Limber approximation, while incorporating redshift binning. Notably, our analysis includes all Newtonian effects, leading relativistic projection effects, and general relativistic contributions, including radiation dynamics, up to second order in perturbation theory. For simplicity, however, we neglect any biasing effects. We have implemented these expressions in an open access code to evaluate the bispectrum for two redshift bins, $z=2 \pm 0.25$ and $z=0.6 \pm 0.05$, and compare our analytical results with simulations. For the contributions that already appear in a Newtonian treatment we find an interesting cancellation between the quadratic terms. At $z=2$, the projection effects and the dynamical effects have similar amplitude on large scales as we approach $k \sim \mathcal{H}$. In the squeezed limit, radiation effects are found to be the leading relativistic effects, by one order of magnitude. At $z=0.6$, we find the correct weak-field hierarchy between the terms, controlled by the ratio $\mathcal{H}/k$, but we still find that dynamical effects (from nonlinear evolution) are only a factor $2-3$ smaller than the projection effects. We compare our results with simulation measurements and find good agreement for the total bispectrum.
