 - **Abstract**
 One of the most puzzling discoveries by JWST is the population of high-redshift, red, and compact galaxies dubbed little red dots (LRDs). Based on broad-line diagnostics, these galaxies have been argued to host accreting $10^7-10^8$ M$_\odot$ supermassive black holes (SMBHs), a claim with crucial consequences for our understanding of how the first black holes form and grow over cosmic time. A key feature of LRDs is their extreme X-ray weakness: analyses of individual and stacked sources have yielded non-detections or only tentative, inconclusive X-ray signals, except for a handful of individual cases. As the most natural explanation, high obscuration, is disfavored by JWST spectroscopic evidence, several authors have suggested that the X-ray weakness of LRDs is intrinsic, due to super-Eddington accretion rates. In this work, we test that scenario by stacking X-ray data for 55 LRDs in the Chandra Deep Field South, accumulating a total exposure time of nearly 400 Ms. Despite reaching unprecedented X-ray depths, our stack still yields a non-detection. The corresponding upper limits are deep enough to rule out current super-Eddington accretion models, and are compatible only with extremely high levels of obscuration ($N_H\gtrsim10^{25}$~cm$^{-2}$). To explain the X-ray weakness of LRDs, we therefore speculate that the SMBHs in these systems are neither as massive nor as luminous as currently believed.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of four three-dimensional radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations of accretion disks around a $10^8$ solar mass black hole, which produce the far ultraviolet spectrum peak and demonstrate a robust physical mechanism to produce the extreme ultraviolet to soft X-ray power-law continuum component. The disks are fed from rotating tori and reach accretion rates ranging from $0.03$ to $4$ times the Eddington value. The disks become radiation pressure or magnetic pressure dominated depending on the relative timescales of radiative cooling and gas inflow. Magnetic pressure supported disks can form with or without net poloidal magnetic fields as long as the inflowing gas can cool quickly enough, which can typically happen when the accretion rate is low. We calculate the emerging spectra from these disks using multi-group radiation transport with realistic opacities and find that they typically peak around $10$ eV. At accretion rates close to or above the Eddington limit, a power-law component can appear for photon energies between $10$ eV and 1 keV with a spectral slope varying between $L_\nu\propto\nu^{-1}$ and $\nu^{-2}$, comparable to what is observed in radio quiet quasars. The disk with $3\%$ Eddington accretion rate does not exhibit this component. These high energy photons are produced in an optically thick region $\approx 30^{\circ}-45^{\circ}$ from the disk midplane by compressible bulk Comptonization within the converging accretion flow. Strongly magnetized disks that have a very small surface density will produce a spectrum that is very different from what is observed.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the X-ray emission from the Galactic Centre (GC) region, focusing on the 6.4 keV fluorescent line of neutral or weakly ionised iron, which is commonly attributed to X-ray reflection from dense molecular clouds. Our goal is to separate the reflection signal from other physical X-ray components. We aim to produce a clean map of the 6.4 keV emission, thus providing a better understanding of the X-ray reflection processes in the GC. We utilised a deep mosaic of all available XMM-Newton observations, encompassing the central 40 square degrees of the Galaxy. The mosaics of two narrow bands centred at 6.7 keV and 6.4 keV, and a broader continuum band at lower energies (5-6.1 keV), provided valuable spatial and spectral information on the X-ray emission. These combined with the stellar mass distribution of our Galaxy enabled us to decompose the observed signal into physically meaningful components. Our analysis shows that the cleaned 6.4 keV band map, free from the contribution of bright and unresolved point sources, is predominantly shaped by X-ray reflection from dense molecular clouds. The spatial distribution of this emission, which strongly correlates with the molecular gas distribution in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ), supports the interpretation that this map provides the best estimate of the X-ray reflection signal averaged over the last two decades. The cleaned reflection map produced could serve as a tool for future studies to quantify upper limits on the reflection contribution from low-energy cosmic rays in unilluminated regions. Moreover, we estimate that, on average within the CMZ, approximately 65% of the ridge emission contributes to the observed 6.4 keV emission, a factor that should be incorporated into upcoming investigations of the GC, such as polarisation studies of the reflected X-ray continuum from molecular clouds.

 - **Abstract**
 The overionized regions surrounding high-redshift quasars, known as proximity zones, provide a window into the interaction between supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and the intergalactic medium (IGM) during the epoch of reionization (EoR). We present new homogeneous measurements of proximity zone sizes ($R_{\mathrm{p}}$) for a sample of $59$ quasars spanning redshifts $5.77 \leq z \leq 7.54$ (median $z = 6.59$). For $15$ of these sources, we measure $R_{\mathrm{p}}$ for the first time. The quasars in our catalog have absolute magnitudes at rest-frame $1450$ Å in the range $-29.13 \leq M_{1450} \leq -25.20$ (median $M_{1450} \simeq -26.49$), providing one of the most extensive data sets for exploring $R_{\mathrm{p}}$ at these epochs. The distribution of $R_{\mathrm{p}}$ values shows a large scatter at fixed redshift and luminosity, likely reflecting variations in quasar lifetimes ($t_{\mathrm{Q}}$), IGM density fluctuations, and IGM neutral fraction. We fit a bivariate power-law model to a large sample of $100$ objects to study the dependence of $R_{\mathrm{p}}$ with both $M_{1450}$ and $z$: we find that the evolution of $R_{\mathrm{p}}$ with luminosity is in agreement with the models ($R_{\mathrm{p}} \propto 10^{-0.4 M_{1450}/2.87}$), while the evolution of $R_{\mathrm{p}}$ with $z$ is steeper than previous works ($R_{\mathrm{p}} \propto (1+z)^{-2.44}$). We identify $13$ quasars with small proximity zone size, defined using the residuals of our fit. In all cases, except for J2211$-$6320, we rule out the presence of associated dense absorbers that prematurely truncate $R_{\mathrm{p}}$, and suggest a short $t_{\mathrm{Q}}$ ($\lesssim 10^4$ yr) as a possible explanation for their small proximity zone sizes.

 - **Abstract**
 Although the X-ray spectra of Seyfert 1 galaxies exhibit absorption lines of He-like iron and H-like iron at blue-shifted velocities of approximately $500 \ \mathrm{km} \ \mathrm{s}^{-1}$, the physical origin of these absorption lines remains uncertain. In this study, we performed X-ray radiative transfer based on the sub-parsec-scale thermally driven outflows. The initial step involved calculating the photoionization equilibrium using the Cloudy code, which is based on three-dimensional radiative hydrodynamic simulations. Subsequently, X-ray radiative transfer was performed using the Monte Carlo simulation for astrophysics and cosmology code. Our findings indicate that when the angle of inclination ranges from $55 \ \mathrm{degrees}$ to $65 \ \mathrm{degrees}$, the transmitted component of the X-ray spectrum displays absorption lines of He-like and H-like iron, exhibiting a blue shift of approximately $500 \ \mathrm{km} \ \mathrm{s}^{-1}$. The results suggest that the absorption lines are generated by a photoionized gas within $0.005 \ \mathrm{pc}$. Additionally, the results indicate that the scattered component of the X-ray spectrum exhibits emission lines originating from neutral iron fluorescence, He-like iron, and H-like iron. The emission lines are broadened by approximately $7000 \ \mathrm{km} \ \mathrm{s}^{-1}$ due to the Keplerian rotation. Furthermore, the model reproduced the H-like iron and H-like iron absorption lines in NGC 3783 observed by the Chandra High Energy Transmission Grating.

 - **Abstract**
 The role of dust in the cosmic star formation budget remains highly uncertain, especially at $z>4$, where accurate bookkeeping of the dust-obscured component proves difficult. We address this shortcoming with SCUBADive, a compilation of the \jwst\ counterparts of (sub-)millimeter galaxies, in order to further analyze the distribution and properties of massive dust-obscured galaxies at early times. In this paper, we present a subset of SCUBADive, focusing on 60 ``dark'' galaxies that dropout at 1.5\micron. Motivated by \jwst\ observations of AzTECC71, a far-infrared bright F150W-dropout with $z_{\rm phot}=5.7^{+0.8}_{-0.7}$, we complete a systematic search of F150W-dropouts with SCUBA-2 and ALMA detections to find the highest redshift dusty galaxies. Within our subsample, 16 are most similar to AzTECC71 due to faint F444W magnitudes ($>24$\,mag) and lack of counterparts in COSMOS2020. Despite high star formation rates ($\langle$SFR$\rangle=550^{+500}_{-360}$\,\mdot\,yr$^{-1}$) and large stellar masses ($\langle$log$_{10}$(\mstar)$\rangle=11.2^{+0.5}_{-0.4}$\,\mdot), these galaxies may not be particularly extreme for their presumed epochs according to offsets from the main sequence. We find that heavily obscured galaxies, which have inadvertently been omitted by past galaxy evolution studies, comprise roughly 20\% of their host population by mass. This population may, however, contribute significantly to the high mass end (log$_{10}$(\mstar/\mdot)$>11$) of the $z>4$ stellar mass function as up to 60\% could have been missed from previous studies.

 - **Abstract**
 We describe our approach to solve the problem of ensuring the solenoidality of the magnetic field vector in three-dimensional (3D) inversions, as well as the estimation of the uncertainty in the inferred magnetic field. The solenoidality of the magnetic field vector is often disregarded in the inversion of spectropolarimetric data due to limitations in the traditional one-dimensional inversion techniques. We propose a method to ensure the solenoidal condition in 3D inversions based on our meshfree approach. The increase in dimensionality with respect to the 1D inversion techniques is such that some of the traditional methods to determine the uncertainties become unfeasible. We propose a method based on a Monte Carlo approach to determine the uncertainty of the magnetic field inference. Due to the physics of the problem, we can compute the uncertainty increasing the total required computational time by just a factor of about two. We also propose a metric to quantify the uncertainty to describe the degree of confidence of the magnetic field inference. Finally, we perform a numerical experiment to demonstrate the feasibility of both the method and the metric proposed to quantify the uncertainty.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the detection of a spatial variation of X-ray polarization in the southwestern shell of SN 1006 (SN 1006 SW) using IXPE. The shell has an average X-ray polarization degree (PD) of $21.6\%\pm 4.5\%$ and polarization angle (PA) of $-48^\circ \pm 5^\circ$ in the 2--4 keV energy band, similar to those in the northeastern shell. The PD varies along SN 1006 SW, with a peak PD$= 40\%\pm 8\%$ in the south and a significantly lower PD $\lesssim 27\%$ (99\% upper limit) in the west where the shell has been proposed to be interacting with an interstellar cloud. The correlation between the PD, which reflects the magnetic orderliness, and the preshock density provides observational evidence that magnetic turbulence and amplification are environment-dependent. The high PD detected in the southern region of the shell constrains the magnetic turbulence scale of $\lesssim 0.1$~pc. Moreover, by comparing the IXPE X-ray and MeerKAT radio polarization measurements for SN 1006 SW, we found that magnetic fields traced by X-ray polarization are nearly radially distributed, whereas those traced by radio polarization tend to follow a direction parallel to the Galactic plane. This suggests that the X-ray polarization probes freshly amplified magnetic fields from small-scale structures in the immediate postshock region, while the radio traces more extended regions influenced by the pre-existing ambient magnetic fields.

 - **Abstract**
 Trumpler 5 is a moderately old, dust-obscured metal-poor open cluster. In this study, high-resolution near-infrared spectroscopic data of seven giant stars from the Trumpler 5 cluster were analyzed to derive chemical abundances for 20 elements and $^{12}C/^{13}C$ ratios. Color-magnitude diagram (CMD) analysis of BV and Gaia photometry has also been performed for a comprehensive study of the cluster. Thanks to the methodology employed, some targets are studied for the first time. Additionally, it provides a detailed color-magnitude diagram analysis using photometric and spectroscopic data. We gathered high-resolution spectra for seven Trumpler 5 red giants in the near-infrared H and K wavelength domains, using the Immersion Grating INfrared Spectrometer (IGRINS). We introduced a method to initially estimate the stellar surface gravity (log g) by using calibrated equivalent widths of the Ti II line at 15873 Å from a large sample. We performed standard spectroscopic analyses to refine the model atmospheric parameters of our targets and determined the chemical abundances primarily through spectrum synthesis. We also performed color-magnitude diagram analyses to extract differential reddening correction to compare cluster parameters both with and without corrections. We derived stellar parameters for seven members of Trumpler 5 with our method and the results are consistent with both the literature and other methods. We also inferred elemental abundances for more than 20 species, along with the $^{12}C/^{13}C$ ratios. The elemental abundances are in good agreement with the literature values for similar targets. Through CMD analysis, we found the reddening value, E(B-V)$\simeq$0.76 and estimated the age of the cluster to be approximately 2.50 Gyr.

 - **Abstract**
 We present high-resolution and spatially-matched observations with JWST and ALMA of a starburst galaxy (PACS-830) at $z=1.46$. The NIRCam observations mainly trace the stellar light while the CO ($J$=5--4) observations map the dense molecular gas at kpc scales. Both datasets reveal the morphology to be that of a gas/dust rich bulge with two extending arms, together resembling a grand-design spiral galaxy. The more pronounced arm contributes 21 $\pm$ 6\% of the total CO emission. These results demonstrate that starburst activity at high redshift can be triggered, without undergoing a highly disruptive major merger. We assess the strength and distribution of star formation using two tracers: (1) Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) emission detected at $8~\mu$m ($L_8$) with a MIRI/F1800W image, and (2) $L_\mathrm{IR}$, inferred from the CO ($J$=5--4) map. The spatial profiles of the $L_\mathrm{IR}$ and $L_8$ are dissimilar, thus leading to a significant deficit of mid-IR ($L_8$) emission in the nucleus. We hypothesize that this is due to the destruction of PAH molecules by the intense ionizing radiation field or decreased emission in the photodissociation region, as seen in nearby star-forming regions and consistent with the galaxy-wide properties of distant starbursts. This study reveals spatial variations in the $L_8$ to $L_\mathrm{IR}$ ratio for the first time at $z>1$, in agreement with expectations from theory. Our analysis underscores the pivotal role of joint high-resolution observations with JWST and ALMA in discerning the different phases of the interstellar medium (ISM) and revealing internal physics in galaxy substructures.

 - **Abstract**
 Quasars, powered by accretion onto supermassive black holes (SMBHs), exhibit significant variability, offering insights into the physics of accretion and the properties of the central engines. In this study, we analyze photometric variability and its correlation with key quasar properties, including black hole mass ($M_{\mathrm{BH}}$) and nuclear luminosities, using 915 quasars with $0\leq z<3.0$ from the AQMES sample monitored within SDSS-V. Variability metrics were derived from approximately 6-year light curves provided by the Zwicky Transient Facility -- ZTF, while SMBH masses and luminosities were obtained from the SDSS DR16 quasar catalog of \citet{wu2022catalog}. We identify a strong anti-correlation between variability amplitude and luminosity, which strengthens with redshift, and a redshift-dependent trend for $M_{\mathrm{BH}}$: a positive correlation at low redshifts, no significant correlation at intermediate redshifts, and an anti-correlation the highest redshifts. Our main finding is a robust anti-correlation between photometric variability amplitude and Eddington ratio, consistent across redshift bins. We present a general equation encapsulating this relationship, that appears to be almost free of redshift dependence, enabling predictions of quasar variability based on accretion parameters {\bf or vice-versa}. The derived relation with the Eddington ratio provides a unified framework for interpreting variability in active galactic nuclei (AGN) and facilitates future studies of quasar variability using high-cadence surveys, such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time -- LSST.

 - **Abstract**
 The Virgo Filament Survey (VFS) is a comprehensive study of galaxies that reside in the extended filamentary structures surrounding the Virgo Cluster, out to 12 virial radii. The primary goal is to characterize all of the dominant baryonic components within galaxies and to understand whether and how they are affected by the filament environment. A key constituent of VFS is a narrowband H$\alpha$ imaging survey of over 600 galaxies, VFS-H$\alpha$. The H$\alpha$ images reveal detailed, resolved maps of the ionized gas and massive star-formation. This imaging is particularly powerful as a probe of environmentally-induced quenching because different physical processes affect the spatial distribution of star formation in different ways. In this paper, we present the first results from the VFS-H$\alpha$ for the NGC~5364 group, a low-mass ($\log_{10}(M_{dyn}/M_\odot) < 13)$ system located at the western edge of the Virgo~III filament. We combine H$\alpha$ imaging with resolved H~I observations from MeerKAT for eight group members. These galaxies exhibit peculiar morphologies, including strong distortions in the stars and the gas, truncated H~I and H$\alpha$ disks, H~I tails, extraplanar H$\alpha$ emission, and off-center H$\alpha$ emission. These signatures are suggestive of environmental processing such as tidal interactions, ram pressure stripping, and starvation. We quantify the role of ram pressure stripping expected in this group, and find that it can explain the cases of H~I tails and truncated H-alpha for all but one of the disk-dominated galaxies. Our observations indicate that multiple physical mechanisms are disrupting the baryon cycle in these group galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 Strontium (Sr) emissions have been observed across a wide range of astrophysical phenomena, from kilonovae (KNe) events to white dwarf (WD) stars. Precise and extensive atomic data for low ionisation stages of Sr is required for accurate theoretical modelling and to improve our understanding of evolutionary pathways. We calculated energy levels, Einstein A coefficients and electron-impact excitation collision strengths for Sr I, Sr III, Sr IV and Sr V at the temperature and density ranges of interest in KNe and WD research. We developed new target structures using the GRASP0 and AUTOSTRUCTURE packages. The energies and A-values arising from the new structures were found to be in good agreement with experimental and theoretical equivalents reported in the literature. Maxwellian averaged electron impact collision strengths were calculated using the R-matrix approach, as applied through the DARC and RMBP coding packages. These are presented in adf04 file format. The new data sets allowed us to construct synthetic spectra for the first five ionisation stages of Sr and probe possible density and temperature diagnostic lines. The synthetic spectra within the KNe regime revealed possible Sr IV and Sr V candidate lines at 1027.69nm and 1203.35nm respectively. These may provide useful benchmarks for determining the extent of Sr ionisation that can be reached in an evolving KNe event. Additional diagnostic lines were found to be poor across the Sr ion stages for both KNe and WD regimes due to most levels being in either coronal or Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) conditions.

 - **Abstract**
 Reverberation mapping is a technique in which the mass of a Seyfert I galaxy's central supermassive black hole is estimated, along with the system's physical scale, from the timescale at which variations in brightness propagate through the galactic nucleus. This mapping allows for a long baseline of time measurements to extract spatial information beyond the angular resolution of our telescopes, and is the main means of constraining supermassive black hole masses at high redshift. The most recent generation of multi-year reverberation mapping campaigns for large numbers of active galactic nuclei (e.g. OzDES) have had to deal with persistent complications of identifying false positives, such as those arising from aliasing due to seasonal gaps in time-series data. We introduce LITMUS (Lag Inference Through the Mixed Use of Samplers), a modern lag recovery tool built on the "damped random walk" model of quasar variability, built in the autodiff framework JAX. LITMUS is purpose built to handle the multimodal aliasing of seasonal observation windows and provides evidence integrals for model comparison, a more quantified alternative to existing methods of lag validation. LITMUS also offers a flexible modular framework for extending modelling of AGN variability, and includes JAX-enabled implementations of other popular lag recovery methods like nested sampling and the interpolated cross correlation function. We test LITMUS on a number of mock light curves modelled after the OzDES sample and find that it recovers their lags with high precision and a successfully identifies spurious lag recoveries, reducing its false positive rate to drastically outperform the state of the art program JAVELIN. LITMUS's high performance is accomplished by an algorithm for mapping the Bayesian posterior density which both constrains the lag and offers a Bayesian framework for model null hypothesis testing.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we study the dust dynamics in the molecular outflow using an analytical magnetohydrodynamical outflow model. Specifically, we investigate the maximum size of dust grains $a_{\rm d,max}$ that can be lifted by the outflow and whether they can escape into interstellar space. We also investigate the dependence of the maximum size of the dust grains on various outflow parameters, such as the mass ejection rate of the outflow $\dot{M}$, the disk size $r_{\rm disk}$, the mass of the central protostar $M_{*}$ and the internal dust density $\rho_{\rm mat}$. We find the empirical formula for the maximum dust size as a function of the outflow parameters. $a_{\rm d,max}$ depends on the parameters as $a_{\rm d,max}$ $\propto$ $\dot{M}^{1.0}$ $r_{\rm disk}^{-0.44}$ $M_{*}^{-0.82}$ $\rho_{\rm mat}^{-1.0}$. We also find that the dust grains with size of 100 $\rm \mu$m to 1 mm can be lifted by the outflow and can distribute in the well outside of the disk when the mass ejection rate of the outflow has the value of $10^{-7}\,M_{\odot}\rm \,yr^{-1}$ to $10^{-6}\,M_{\odot}\rm \,yr^{-1}$. This result is consistent with recent observations that show a correlation between the mass ejection rate of the outflow and the spectral index $\beta$ of the dust opacity at the envelope scale.

 - **Abstract**
 The recently discovered spectroscopic binary $\rho$ Oph A is a rare magnetic hot binary system composed of two early B-type stars, comprising a non-magnetic primary (Aa) and a slightly less massive magnetic secondary (Ab). Using near-IR interferometry, we aim to resolve the system's astrometric orbit. The high-spectral resolution VLTI/GRAVITY data also enables obtaining further information about the two stellar components, and about the centrifugal magnetosphere orbiting the magnetic star. We obtained a time-series of $K$-band interferometric data from VLTI/GRAVITY, and analyzed them with the geometrical model-fitting tool PMOIRED. The continuum was used to derive the relative astrometry and relative fluxes of the two components, leading to the astrometric orbital solution. Spectro-interferometry covering the Br$\gamma$ line was then used to obtain high-angular-resolution information about the dominant magnetospheric cloud in corotation with the magnetic Ab component. The combination of the astrometric orbital solution with the published radial velocities for both components led to a 3-dimensional orbital solution, dynamical masses, and a dynamical parallax, revealing a good agreement with previous estimates and confirming the previously inferred alignment of the orbital axis and the rotation axis of the Ab component, albeit at a much higher precision. Detailed analysis of the Br$\gamma$ spectrointerferometry then revealed the changing position of the magnetospheric cloud relative to the Ab component. Comparison to the location of the cloud predicted from $\rho$ Oph Ab's oblique rotator model and H$\alpha$ emission properties demonstrated excellent agreement. We are additionally able to demonstrate that the magnetic star exhibits prograde rotation. This represents the first time that the motion of a centrifugal magnetosphere has been detected in angularly resolved observations.

 - **Abstract**
 To investigate the star-forming process in nearby dwarf galaxies, we present Integral Field Units (IFU) observation of the star-forming dwarf galaxy, NGC 1522, with the Very Large Telescope (VLT)/Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) as a part of Dwarf Galaxy Integral Survey (DGIS). Our observation reveals the presence of a star-forming clumpy ring in its central region. We identify nine distinct star-forming clumps based on extinction-corrected H$\alpha$ emission-line map, with the total star formation rate (SFR) of about 0.1 $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. The nine clumps are considered to be starbursts, which represent an extreme case in the local universe, without invoking major merging. We investigate the properties of ionized gas using the strong emission lines and `BPT' diagrams, in conjunction with the velocity mapping. Our analysis unveils intriguing patterns, including the positive metallicity gradient and low N/O abundance ratio. This peculiar distribution of metallicity may signify external gas accretion. Our results suggest that the ongoing star formation in NGC 1522 might be triggered and sustained by the inflow of external metal-poor gas.

 - **Abstract**
 Radio-loud active galactic nuclei, in particular radio-loud quasars, are fueled by accretion onto supermassive black holes and are among the most energetic sources in the Universe. While their impact on their surroundings - from the interstellar medium to the circumgalactic medium - is well recognized, the specific mechanisms remain uncertain. In this study we analyze deep Keck Cosmic Web Imager observations of the Lyman-alpha (Lya) halo surrounding the radio-loud quasar at the center of the cluster CARLA J1017+6116 at redshift z = 2.8. As is known from previous observations, the cluster hosts a high fraction of early-type galaxies, and the star formation of its spectroscopically confirmed cluster members is typical of or higher than that of galaxies on the main sequence. We find that the Lya halo extends at least 16 arcsec (128 pkpc) down to a surface brightness level of 1e-19 erg/s/cm^2/arcsec^2, with a total observed Lya luminosity of log10(L/Lsun) = 43.35 +- 0.05. The halo has distinct kinematic regions with asymmetries suggestive of complex interactions between the quasar and the intracluster medium, possibly driven by a combination of biconical feedback and episodic activity. Despite the quasar classification, our reanalysis of very long baseline interferometry data finds no evidence of extended jet structures; we instead find compact and variable radio emission that could indicate episodic jet activity or suppression by the dense interstellar medium. Combining these observations with imaging obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope, we identified one Lya-emitting source within the quasar halo. While mechanical feedback from a jet appears limited or episodic, radiative feedback likely plays a dominant role in shaping the extended Lya halo, highlighting the complex interplay between quasar-driven processes and the surrounding dense environment.

 - **Abstract**
 We compare the efficiency and ease-of-use of the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) algorithm and Sparse Physics-Informed Discovery of Empirical Relations (SPIDER) framework in recovering the relevant governing equations and boundary conditions from data generated by direct numerical simulations (DNS) of turbulent convective flows. In the former case, a weak-form implementation pySINDy is used. Time-dependent data for two- (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) DNS simulation of Rayleigh-Benard convection and convective plane Couette flow is generated using the Dedalus PDE framework for spectrally solving differential equations. Using pySINDy we are able to recover the governing equations of 2D models of Rayleigh-Benard convection at Rayleigh numbers, R, from laminar, through transitional to moderately turbulent flow conditions, albeit with increasing difficulty with larger Rayleigh number, especially in recovery of the diffusive terms (with coefficient magnitude proportional to 1/R^0.5). SPIDER requires a much smaller library of terms and we are able to recover more easily the governing equations for a wider range of R in 2D and 3D convection and plane flow models and go on to recover constraints (the incompressibility condition) and boundary conditions, demonstrating the benefits and capabilities of SPIDER to go beyond pySINDy for these fluid problems governed by second-order PDEs. [We] demonstrat[e] the potential of machine-learning methods to validate numerical solvers and solutions for such flow problems. We also find that properties of the flow, specifically the correlation time and spatial scales, should inform the initial selection of spatiotemporal subdomain sizes [abbreviated]

 - **Abstract**
 Previous studies showed evidence of a dearth of close-in exoplanets around fast rotators, which can be explained by the combined action of intense tidal and magnetic interactions between planet and their host star. Detecting more exoplanets experiencing such interactions, with orbits evolving on short timescales, is therefore crucial to improve our understanding of the underlying physical mechanisms. For this purpose, we perform a new search for close-in non-transiting substellar companions in the Kepler data, focusing on orbital periods below 2.3 days. We focus on main-sequence solar-type stars and subgiant stars for which a surface rotation period was measured. For each star, we look for an excess in the power spectral density of the light curve, that could correspond to the signature of a close-in non-transiting companion. We compare our candidates with existing catalogues to eliminate potential contaminants in our sample, and we visually inspect the phase-folded light curve and its wavelet decomposition. We identify 88 stars, exhibiting a signature consistent with the presence of a close non-transiting substellar companion. We show that the objects in our sample are located mostly within the dearth zone, emphasising the importance of performing follow-up of such systems in order to gather observational evidence of star-planet interactions.

 - **Abstract**
 The wind-fed accretion of gas with an intrinsic magnetic field onto neutron stars in high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) is discussed. The criteria for the implementation of quasi-spherical accretion in the system, the formation of a Keplerian accretion disk and a non-Keplerian magnetically arrested disk (MAD-accretion scenario) are formulated. It is shown that the period of the equilibrium rotation of a neutron star in the MAD-accretion scenario, in addition to the parameters of the binary system, is also determined by the velocity, temperature, and degree of magnetization of the stellar wind of its massive companion. Within the hypothesis of the equilibrium rotation, we have estimated the parameters of the stellar wind for the most fully-studied quasi-equilibrium accreting pulsars in the HMXBs corresponding to the criteria for the MAD-accretion scenario implementation. We show that the period of the equilibrium rotation of a neutron star in the system, all other things being equal, increases with the growth of the magnetization degree of the stellar wind component of its massive companion flowing out in the plane of the system's orbit. Therefore, the periods of accreting pulsars in systems with similar parameters can differ from each other by several orders of magnitude and, under favorable conditions, reach values of several thousand and even tens of thousands of seconds.

 - **Abstract**
 We present full-polarization observations at $\lambda = 0.87$ mm (345 GHz) conducted with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) toward Messier 87 (M87) and seven other radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN). We determine polarization and Faraday properties of the targets, with linear polarization (LP) fractions spanning 1\% to 17\%, and Faraday rotation measures (RMs) exceeding $10^{5}$ rad m$^{-2}$. These RM values, 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than typically observed at $\lambda > 3$ mm, suggest denser Faraday screens or stronger magnetic fields in the (sub)millimeter emission regions. Additionally, we present the first submillimeter polarized images of the M87 jet and the observed AGN. In the M87 jet, we identify RM gradients and sign reversals, suggestive of a helical magnetic field structure extending over kiloparsec scales. These observations were part of the ALMA Band~7 Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) commissioning during the April 2021 Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) campaign. The results provide essential constraints for calibrating, analyzing, and interpreting VLBI data from the EHT at 345 GHz, representing a critical step toward submillimeter VLBI imaging.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a $z=0$ census of nuggets -- compact galaxies that form via gas-rich violent disk instability -- within the luminosity- and volume-limited REsolved Spectroscopy Of a Local VolumE (RESOLVE) and Environmental COntext (ECO) surveys. We use random forest (RF) models to predict near-ultraviolet (NUV) magnitudes for ECO galaxies that lack high-quality NUV magnitudes, thereby doubling the number of ECO galaxies with reliable extinction-corrected star formation rates (SFRs) and red/green/blue classifications based on specific SFRs (sSFRs). The resulting RF-enhanced RESOLVE+ECO nugget sample allows us to analyze rare subpopulations -- green nuggets and nuggets with active galactic nuclei (AGN) -- likely associated with quenching. Green nuggets are more similar to red nuggets than to blue nuggets in halo mass ($M_{\text{halo}}$) distribution, with both red and green nuggets being found mainly at $M_{\text{halo}} \ge 10^{11.4} M_\odot$, where permanent halo quenching is predicted. At these masses, the AGN frequency for green nuggets is higher ($\text{48.2\%}^{+5.3\%}_{-5.3\%}$) than for either blue ($\text{39.2\%}^{+2.9\%}_{-2.8\%}$) or red ($\text{29.3\%}^{+3.0\%}_{-2.8\%}$) nuggets. Between $M_{halo} = 10^{11.4}-10^{12} M_\odot$, at the onset of permanent quenching, the AGN frequency for green nuggets is nearly double the frequency for blue or red nuggets, implying AGN are associated with this transition. At $M_{halo} < 10^{11.4} M_\odot$, where temporary cyclic quenching is expected, the AGN frequency for blue nuggets ($\text{7.5\%}^{+1.4\%}_{-1.2\%}$) is lower than for either green ($\text{31.3\%}^{+8.7\%}_{-7.5\%}$) or red ($\text{18.8\%}^{+11.5\%}_{-7.8\%}$) nuggets. At all masses, nuggets with AGN have reduced sSFRs and likely also atomic gas content compared to nuggets without AGN, but the quenching is more extreme below $M_{halo} = 10^{11.4} M_\odot$.

 - **Abstract**
 Type II solar radio bursts are generated by electrons accelerated by coronal shock waves. They appear in dynamic spectra as lanes drifting from higher to lower frequencies at the plasma frequency and its harmonic. These lanes can often be split into two or more sub-bands that have similar drift rates. This phenomenon is called band-splitting, and its physical origins are still under debate. Our aim is to investigate the origin of band-splitting using novel imaging and spectropolarimetric observations of a type II solar radio burst from the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR). We used LOFAR imaging at multiple frequencies and time steps to track the locations of the radio sources corresponding to the two components of the band-split emission lane. In addition, we estimated the degree of circular polarisation (dcp) for both components using LOFAR's full Stokes dynamic spectra. From the imaging of the type II burst, we found two close but clearly separated emission regions clustered over several frequencies spanning each split band. One emission region corresponds to the lower frequency band and the other to the higher frequency band of the split lane. Using the full Stokes dynamic spectra, we also found the dcp to be very similar for both bands. The two distinct emission regions suggest that the split bands originate from two separate regions at the shock. The similar values of dcp for both sub-bands correspond to similar values of magnetic field strength in the two regions and indicate little to no change in the emission region plasma. Thus, our findings are in contradiction with previous theories, which have suggested that split bands originate in the same region but upstream and downstream of the shock. Instead, our results suggest that both bands originate in two separate upstream regions since we find a clear separation in locations and no magnetic compression.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the origin of the elliptical ring structure observed in the images of the supermassive black hole M87*, aiming to disentangle contributions from gravitational, astrophysical, and imaging effects. Leveraging the enhanced capabilities of the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) 2018 array, including improved $(u,v)$-coverage from the Greenland Telescope, we measure the ring's ellipticity using five independent imaging methods, obtaining a consistent average value of $\tau = 0.08_{-0.02}^{+0.03}$ with a position angle $\xi = 50.1_{-7.6}^{+6.2}$ degrees. To interpret this measurement, we compare against General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations spanning a wide range of physical parameters including thermal or non-thermal electron distribution function, spins, and ion-to-electron temperature ratios in both low and high-density regions. We find no statistically significant correlation between spin and ellipticity in GRMHD images. Instead, we identify a correlation between ellipticity and the fraction of non-ring emission, particularly in non-thermal models and models with higher jet emission. These results indicate that the ellipticity measured from the \m87 emission structure is consistent with that expected from simulations of turbulent accretion flows around black holes, where it is dominated by astrophysical effects rather than gravitational ones. Future high-resolution imaging, including space very long baseline interferometry and long-term monitoring, will be essential to isolate gravitational signatures from astrophysical effects.

 Polars and low-accretion rate polars (LARPs) are strongly magnetic cataclysmic variables. Mediated by the magnetic field of the white dwarf, their spin and binary orbit are (mostly) synchronized. They play an important role in our understanding of close binary evolution and the generation of strong magnetic fields in white dwarfs. Thanks to X-ray all-sky surveys, optical variability, and spectroscopic surveys, the number of polars and LARPs has grown from just a few in the 1980s to more than 200 today. Follow-up studies are facilitated by the systematic compilation of these systems presented here, which is also made available as an online resource. Yearly updates are planned, and community input is highly appreciated.

 - **Abstract**
 Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and coronal jets are two of the best-studied forms of solar eruptions, with the same underlying physics. Previous studies have presented partial eruptions producing coronal jets. We report, for the first time, a detailed analysis of three partial eruptions that segmented after the eruption began and produced CMEs. We use multiwavelength observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly, Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory, and Solar Orbiter to reconstruct the three-dimensional evolution of the events. The magnetic field extrapolations indicated that the initial filaments were overlaid by pseudostreamer structures, and the splitting occurred after the interaction between the filament-supporting flux and external open field through their null points. The breakout mechanism seems to play a key role in both halting the system and splitting it. However, this initial evolution and consequent splitting into an erupting flux rope above the prominence segment that failed to erupt poses severe challenges to theories of solar eruptions.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, the gravitational wave (GW) event for black hole (BH)-BH mergers, S241125n, has been reported to be associated with a short gamma-ray burst (GRB) and X-ray afterglow emission. Such an association could potentially unveil the environments of mergers and provide attractive targets for multi-messenger observations. We summarize these observations and model it as a binary BH merger occurring within an active galactic nucleus (AGN), where the merger remnant accretes disk material at hyper-Eddington rates. The resulting jet could lead to the GRB associated with the GW event. The GRB, detected by Swift-BAT, exhibits a Comptonized spectrum with an unusually soft photon index, which is consistent with emission from the jet interacting the emission associated with the dense AGN disk environment. Its X-ray afterglow shows an unusually hard spectrum, indicating possible strong absorption by a high column density typical of AGN disks. We highlight the importance of identifying the host galaxy and conducting more sensitive infrared observations to test the model.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar eruptive behavior is often modeled with magnetohydrodynamic simulations of magnetic flux emergence. The usual geometry considered is that of a horizontal cylindrical magnetic flux tube. An alternative is the toroidal tube geometry which has some advantages over the cylindrical one, namely, that the emerging bipolar pair of sunspots do not drift apart indefinitely. In addition to the toroidal tube, we include an oblique, ambient field in the simulation, which leads to the production of increased activity from the interaction of ambient and emerging fields. Letting the simulation run for a long time reveals that six eruptive jets take place after an initial reconnection jet. In an attempt to better understand the eruptive activity we examine the evolution of free energy and relative helicity of the coronal volume, as well as, the magnetic tension forces acting on the magnetic system. We find that all quantities decrease in magnitude during the eruptive jets and rebuild afterwards. This recurrent activity continues even after flux emergence ceases and stops once the examined quantities saturate to nearly constant values.

 - **Abstract**
 Interpreting the data from radio detectors for extensive air showers typically relies on Monte-Carlo based simulation codes, which, despite their accuracy are computationally expensive and present bottlenecks for analyses. To address this issue we developed a novel method called template synthesis, which synthesises the radio emission from cosmic ray air showers in seconds. This hybrid approach uses a microscopically simulated, sliced shower (the origin) as an input. It rescales the emission from each slice individually to synthesise the emission from a shower with different properties (the target). In order to be able to change the arrival direction during synthesis, we adjust the phases based on the expected geometrical delays. We benchmark the method by comparing synthesised traces to CoREAS simulations over a wide frequency range of [30, 500] MHz . The synthesis quality is primarily influenced by the difference in $X_{max}$ between the origin and target shower. When $\Delta X_{max} \leq 100 g/cm^2$ , the scatter on the maximum amplitudes of the geomagnetic traces is at most 4%. For the traces from the charge-excess component this scatter is smaller than 6%. We also observe a bias with $\Delta X_{max}$ up to 5% for both components, which appears to depend on the antenna position. Since the bias is symmetrical around $\Delta X_{max} = 0 g/cm^2$, we can use an interpolation approach to correct for it. We have implemented the template synthesis algorithm in a Python package called \texttt{SMIET}, which includes all the necessary parameters. This package has been successfully tested with air showers with zenith angles up to $50^{\circ}$ and can be used with any atmosphere, observation level and magnetic field. We demonstrate that the synthesis quality remains comparable to our main benchmarks across various scenarios and discuss use cases, including machine-learning-based analyses.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the generation of magnetic fields above black hole accretion discs due to the non-zero curl of the disc radiation field. By self consistently computing the components of the radiation flux and their curl, we show that the rotational nature of the radiation field induces charge separation, leading to magnetic field generation in the plasma above the disc. Solving the magnetohydrodynamic equations, we derive the time evolution of these fields and demonstrate that they grow over astrophysically relevant timescales. For a standard Keplerian accretion disc, the produced magnetic fields remain weak, on the order of a few Gauss, consistent with previous predictions. However, when a luminous corona is present in the inner disc region ($r_d < 3-10 r_g$), the generated fields reach dynamically significant strengths of up to $10^5$ Gauss where the magnetic energy density approaching few percentage of equipartition with the gas pressure. These fields develop within realistic growth timescales (such as viscous timescale) and can be dynamically significant in governing disc and jet evolution. Our findings suggest that radiation-driven magnetic fields play a crucial role in accretion flow magnetization, influencing both disc dynamics and observational signatures. The predicted field strengths could affect the thermal emission, synchrotron radiation, and polarization properties of black hole accretion systems, with implications for X-ray binaries, AGN, and jet formation. Future numerical simulations and high-resolution polarimetric observations, such as those from IXPE, eXTP, and EHT, may provide observational confirmation of our findings.

 - **Abstract**
 Compact binaries with accreting white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes are crucial for understanding accretion physics. In this study, we identify accreting compact binary candidates in the eROSITA DR1 by combining Gaia astrometry and ZTF time-domain photometry. We select accreting compact binary candidates whose X-ray emission is likely accretion-driven, based on their X-ray-to-optical flux ratios and optical colors, and further identify systems with short-period ZTF light curves, thereby ruling out AGNs. The resulting 22 candidates, including two known compact binaries, represent promising candidates for spectroscopic follow-up to confirm their accreting nature and explore their physical properties. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining X-ray-to-optical flux ratio and optical color, and time-domain photometry in selecting accreting compact binaries. The method is scalable and adaptable to future multi-wavelength sky surveys, offering a promising path toward a more complete census of compact binaries in the Galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent X-ray observations have discovered a class of periodic X-ray flares in galactic nuclei known as quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs). A promising explanation of QPEs is an emission produced when a stellar-mass object orbiting a central supermassive black hole crosses an accretion disk. If the companion is a compact object, such systems would be a prospective multi-messenger target for the space-based observatory LISA and its successors. Here we quantify the prospects for joint X-ray and GW detection of QPEs with orbital frequency in the mHz band using a minimal flare-emission model. Our analysis shows that X-ray observations are most effective at orbital frequencies up to roughly 1 mHz, whereas LISA is sensitive chiefly above about 1 mHz. Because the optimal sensitivity windows overlap only marginally, we predict at most one joint detection during LISA's nominal mission lifetime. Extending GW sensitivity into the sub-millihertz regime (< 0.1 mHz) would raise the possibility of the joint detection by an order of magnitude, enabling QPEs as an interesting multi-messenger target.

 - **Abstract**
 Stars with outflows interacting with ambient gas experience accelerations arising from the gravitational feedback induced by the interaction structure. In this work, three-dimensional (3D) local shearing box simulations are performed to investigate the dynamical evolution of a star with outflows embedded in the outer regions of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) disk. Two types of stellar wind are considered: isotropic winds and axisymmetric jets, along with variations in the radial pressure gradient profile. The results show that anti-friction enables AGN stars to acquire angular momentum from the ambient gas, resulting in outward migration away from the disk center. The formation and stability of the head-wind structure, which is crucial for maintaining anti-friction, are sensitive to both the strength of the stellar outflow and the radial pressure gradient of the disk gas. Once the head-wind structure is disrupted, the anti-friction effect ceases to operate effectively. A case study is also presented, focusing on a stellar-mass black hole (sBH) in an AGN disk. It is shown that jet material launched along the z-axis is confined to the trailing side of the object's motion by high gas inflow velocities, thereby activating anti-friction and inducing outward migration. If such an sBH migrates inward initially, the interplay between inward and outward migration may trap it at an equilibrium radius, potentially facilitating the formation and merger of black hole binaries.

 - **Abstract**
 The first transmission spectrum of the habitable-zone sub-Neptune K2-18 b with JWST has opened a new avenue for atmospheric characterisation of temperate low-mass exoplanets. The observations led to inferences of methane and carbon dioxide, as well as of dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and/or dimethyl disulfide (DMDS), both potential biosignatures. However, robust identification of DMS and/or DMDS requires further observations to increase the detection significances. More theoretical studies are also needed to identify potential false positives and possible abiotic sources for these molecules. In the present work we demonstrate the next step in this direction with a comprehensive and agnostic search for other chemical species in the atmosphere of K2-18 b. Our exploration includes 650 molecules, spanning a wide range of trace gases, including biotic, abiotic, and anthropogenic gases on Earth. We investigate possible evidence for any of these gases using three metrics: (a) evidence in the JWST mid-infrared spectrum, (b) evidence in the JWST near-infrared spectrum, and (c) plausible sources of production. We find three molecules, including DMS, which appear promising across the datasets considered. The two molecules besides DMS are diethyl sulfide and methyl acrylonitrile, which are more complex than DMS, biogenic on Earth, and have no significant sources known beyond Earth. A few other gases also provide comparable fits to a subset of the data considered but again with limited known plausible sources. Our study highlights the need for further observations to distinguish between possible trace gases in K2-18 b and theoretical work to establish their plausible sources if confirmed on this planet.

 - **Abstract**
 Studies of young planets help us understand planet evolution and investigate important evolutionary processes such as atmospheric escape. We monitored IRAS 04125+2902, a 3 Myr-old T Tauri star with a transiting planet and a transitional disk, with the SPIRou infrared spectropolarimeter on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. Using these data, we constrained the mass and density of the Jupiter-size companion to <0.16 M_J and <0.23 g/cm^3, respectively (90\% upper limits). These rule out a Jovian-like object and support the hypothesis that it is an ancestor to the numerous sub-Neptunes found around mature stars. We unambiguously detect magnetic fields at the stellar surface, small-scale fields reaching 1.5 kG and the large-scale field mostly consisting of a 0.80-0.95 kG dipole inclined by 5-15deg to the rotation axis. Accretion onto the star is low and/or episodic at a maximum rate of ~10^{-11} Msun/yr, indicating that IRAS 04125+2902 is most likely in a magnetic 'propeller' regime, possibly maintaining the star's slow rotation (11.3~d). We discover persistent Doppler-shifted absorption in a metastable He I line, clear evidence for a magnetized wind from a gaseous inner disk. Variability in absorption suggests structure in the disk wind that could reflect disk-planet interactions.
