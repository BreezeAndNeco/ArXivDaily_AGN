#### Mass Transfer in Tidally Heated Stars Orbiting Massive Black Holes and Implications for Repeating Nuclear Transients

 - **Abstract**
 The structure of stars orbiting close to supermassive black holes (SMBHs) can be dramatically modified by tidal heating, which can in principle dissipate an energy much larger than the stellar binding energy. We use analytic models and MESA to explore the coupled dynamics of tidal heating, stellar structural evolution, orbital decay due to gravitational waves and tides, and mass transfer due to Roche lobe overflow. In contrast to more equal mass stellar binaries, the stable mass transfer rate for stars orbiting SMBHs is typically set by the tidal heating timescale (the timescale for tides to increase the stellar radius), not by the gravitational wave orbital decay timescale. The resulting stable mass transfer rate is sensitive to the tidal heating model but is plausibly $\sim 10^{-3}-10^{-5} M_\odot {\, \rm yr^{-1}}$ (and perhaps larger), sufficient to produce low-luminosity active galactic nuclei in many galaxies. The stability of mass transfer is sensitive to where in the stellar interior the tidal energy is dissipated. MESA models confirm the expected result that mass transfer is unstable (stable) if tidal heating increases (decreases) the fraction of the star that is convective. More detailed conclusions about the stability of mass-transfer will require self-consistently calculating how the tidal heating of stars changes in response to internal structural changes produced by the tidal heating itself. Stars with tidal heating-induced mass transfer can produce a large population of low-luminosity active galactic nuclei; they may also be the progenitors of some partial tidal disruption candidates (e.g., ASASSN-14ko) as well as short period quasi-periodic eruptions (e.g., eRO-QPE2 and GSN 069). However, many repeating nuclear transients produced by tidal heating-induced mass loss are likely fainter than those detected thus far, and remain to be discovered.

 - **Abstract**
 Mass transfer (MT) in binary systems is a common evolutionary process that can significantly affect the structure, evolution, and final fate of both stars. In modeling MT hydrodynamics, it is usually assumed that the critical point of the flow, where the velocity exceeds the local sound speed, coincides with the inner Lagrange point (L1). However, in massive donors, radiative pressure dominates over gas pressure and the Eddington factor $\Gamma_\text{Edd}$ can reach or exceed unity. If there is significant momentum and/or energy exchange between gas and radiation, the critical point of the flow can shift away from L1, affecting the MT rate ($\dot{M}_\text{d}$). Here, we investigate the effects of radiation on MT using time-steady radiative hydrodynamic equations and the assumption of the von Zeipel theorem. We provide analytical expressions that closely approximate $\dot{M}_\text{d}$ and numerical solutions using a realistic equation of state. We find two main differences with respect to the traditional expressions for $\dot{M}_\text{d}$. First, for Roche-lobe-underfilling donors with $\Gamma_\text{Edd} \lesssim 1$, radiative momentum exchange leads to an exponential increase of $\dot{M}_\text{d}$ as a function of $1-\Gamma_\text{Edd}$. We provide a simple modification of existing prescriptions that takes this effect into account. Second, we find that the photon tiring limit for super-Eddington outflows is much less restrictive near L1 than in spherical stars. We suggest that donors with super-Eddington convectively inefficient subsurface layers are able to drive MT with $-\dot{M}_\text{d} \gtrsim 10^{-2}\,\text{M}_\odot\,\text{yr}^{-1}$ even before overfilling their Roche lobes. We characterize the conditions for this new mode of super-Eddington-boosted MT and discuss the implications for binary evolution including the potential link to nonterminal outbursts of Luminous Blue Variables.

 - **Abstract**
 The LyC escape fraction from galaxies, $f_{\rm esc}$, is strongly boosted by galactic outflows. In the Attenuation-Free Model (AFM) accounting for the properties of $z>10$ galaxies, radiation-driven outflows develop once the galaxy specific star formation rate, ${\rm sSFR} \ge {\rm sSFR}^* \approx 25\ {\rm Gyr}^{-1}$. As the cosmic sSFR increases with redshift, so does $f_{\rm esc}(z)$, which, when globally averaged, grows from 0.007 to 0.6 in $0 < z < 20$. We successfully tested the model on specific data sub-samples. Our predictions are consistent with direct measurements of $f_{\rm esc}$ up to $z=6.5$, and provide a physical explanation for the observed decreasing trend of the mean UV galaxy spectral slope, $\beta$, towards high-$z$.

 - **Abstract**
 We demonstrate the power of JWST-NIRCam medium-band photometry to measure emission line fluxes and study dust and star formation properties of galaxies at cosmic noon. In this work, we present photometric emission line measurements and spatially-resolved maps of H$\alpha$ and Pa$\beta$ for a sample of 14 galaxies at $1.3\leq z\leq 2.4$, observed by the MegaScience medium-band survey and the UNCOVER deep spectroscopic survey. We measure line fluxes directly from the medium-band photometry and compare with spectroscopic measurements from UNCOVER. We find reasonable agreement between the photometric and spectroscopic emission line fluxes for both H$\alpha$ and Pa$\beta$, with scatter $<0.15$ dex down to emission line equivalent widths of $10$Å. We also make a nebular dust measurement from the ratio Pa$\beta$ / H$\alpha$, finding an average nebular A$_\mathrm{V}$ of 1.4. Our photometric A$_\mathrm{V}$ measurements show a slightly larger scatter of $0.5$ magnitudes when compared to spectroscopic measurements; however, this scatter may be partially caused by aperture effects. Finally, we produce spatially resolved maps of H$\alpha$ emission, Pa$\beta$ emission, and stellar continuum. We find that offsets in H$\alpha$ and Pa$\beta$ emission are common, especially for galaxies with the highest A$_\mathrm{V}$, indicating dusty sub-structures. Furthermore, the correlation between H$\alpha$ and continuum emission decreases with increasing A$_\mathrm{V}$, suggesting that the dustiest objects have clumpy dust and star formation distributions. Our study demonstrates the power of medium-band photometry to directly probe emission line strengths, star formation, and dust attenuation for hundreds of galaxies in UNCOVER and thousands of galaxies in upcoming JWST medium-band surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 We use 45 galaxies from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory survey to study the physical drivers of star formation quenching in the Coma cluster. We measure specific star formation rate (sSFR) radial profiles for the Coma sample as well as a control sample of non-cluster field galaxies. We find that compared to the control sample, galaxies within the Coma Cluster have sSFR profiles that fall off more steeply with galactocentric radius. We then apply a toy model based on slow-then-rapid quenching via ram pressure stripping. We find that this model is able to reproduce the difference in sSFR profiles between field and Coma galaxies. These results demonstrate that ram pressure stripping plays a significant role in quenching star formation in the nearest massive galaxy cluster.

 - **Abstract**
 Determining how much mass is removed by stellar winds is crucial to understanding massive star evolution and feedback. However, traditional spectroscopic diagnostics in the UV and optical are not sensitive enough to characterize weak stellar winds of OB stars in low-metallicity environments. A new tool to access weak stellar winds is provided by spectroscopy in the infrared (IR). Stellar atmosphere models indicate that the hydrogen Br$\alpha$ line at $\lambda$\,4.05\,$\mu$m is a useful mass-loss rate indicator, particularly at low metallicity. The unprecedented capabilities of the NIRSpec spectrograph on board of the \emph{James Webb Space Telescope} (JWST) allow us to measure this line in spectra of massive stars in other galaxies. In this work, we present the first NIRSpec spectra of O-type stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), which has a metallicity of only 20\% Solar. Our sample consists of thirteen stars with spectral types ranging from O2 to O9.5 including supergiants, giants, and dwarfs. The stars belong to NGC\,346, the most massive young cluster in the SMC. We describe the observing strategy and data reduction, highlighting the treatment of the nebular background emission. The spectra cover the 2.8--5.1 $\mu$m wavelength range, and we detect the Br$\alpha$ line in emission in each of our sample stars. Using a combination of spectral and photometric data ranging from the UV to the IR, we improve the measurements of stellar luminosity and reddening. A first qualitative comparison of the observed Br$\alpha$ line with stellar atmosphere models shows its potential as a wind diagnostic for weak-winded stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Helioseismic signatures of dynamo waves have recently been discovered in variations of the solar differential rotation, offering valuable insights into the type of dynamo mechanism operating in the solar convection zone. To characterize these variations, we analyze p-mode frequency-splitting data estimated using time intervals of various lengths to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio in inversions of zonal flows. We introduce a novel time-dependent inversion method that inherently smooths the solution over time, eliminating the need for separate post-processing smoothing. By applying this approach to observational data from the SOHO Michelson Doppler Imager, SDO Helioseismic Magnetic Imager, and Global Oscillation Network Group, we identify similar dynamo wave patterns in both the zonal acceleration and the zonal flow throughout the entire convection zone. Our analysis shows that while using longer time series smooths out temporal variations, the fundamental features observed in the short time series (i.e. 72-day long) persist when inverting datasets covering different time periods. These findings reinforce earlier detections and offer further validation of solar dynamo models. We additionally investigate the dimensionless radial gradient of rotation. Its value is close to -1 and increases in the deeper layers, remaining nearly constant from the equator to mid-latitudes within the depth range of 13 to 35 Mm below the surface; the results at high latitudes remain somewhat inconclusive. The variation of this quantity displays a torsional oscillation-like pattern, albeit with certain differences.
#### Spectral Biases, Starspot Morphology, and Dynamo Transitions on the Pre-Main Sequence: Insights from the X-Shooter WTTS Library

 - **Abstract**
 Starspots are ubiquitous in young, low mass stars, yet their impact on the spectral classification and fundamental parameter inference of pre main sequence stars has been largely overlooked. In this study, we demonstrate that cool starspots systematically distort spectral morphology and bias derived effective temperatures, surface gravities, and luminosities in non accreting Weak Lined T Tauri Stars (WTTS). Using a sample of 56 WTTS with high resolution, broad band X-Shooter spectra, we perform two temperature spectral fits that explicitly account for spot coverage and temperature contrast. These composite models consistently outperform traditional single temperature fits, particularly in the 3350 4000 K regime, where spot contributions dominate the red optical and near infrared flux. Moreover, we propose that surface gravity discrepancies between optical and infrared measurements are a natural consequence of spot dominated emission in PMS stars that is accentuated by observational uncertainty. We find that single temperature models can overestimate effective temperatures by up to 700 K and underestimate log g by 1-2 dex. Using spot-corrected effective temperatures, we derive masses and ages from traditional, magnetic, and spotted evolutionary models, finding that spot corrections systematically raise inferred masses by up to 80 percent and stellar ages by up to 0.5 dex. These discrepancies are strongest for stars in the 0.3 to 0.8 solar mass range. Using starspots as a proxy for magnetic topology, we find evidence that a shift from largely axisymmetric to non axisymmetric magnetic fields dominated by small scale structures coincides with the formation of a radiative core during the pre main sequence, effectively separating convective and interface dynamo regimes.

 - **Abstract**
 The matter cycle between gas clouds and stars in galaxies plays a crucial role in regulating galaxy evolution through feedback mechanisms. In turn, the local and global galactic environments shape the interstellar medium and provide the initial conditions for star formation, potentially affecting the properties of this small-scale matter cycle. In particular, spiral arms have been proposed to play a pivotal role in the star formation life cycle, by enhancing the gas density and triggering star formation. However, their exact role is still debated. In this paper, we investigate the role of spiral arms in the giant molecular cloud evolutionary life cycle and on the star formation process in a sample of 22 nearby spiral galaxies from the PHANGS survey. We measure the cloud lifetime, the feedback timescale, the typical distance between independent regions and the star formation efficiency in spiral arms and inter-arm regions separately. We find that the distributions of the cloud lifetime as well as the feedback timescale are similar in both environments. This result suggests that spiral arms are unlikely to play a dominant role in triggering star formation. By contrast, the star formation efficiency appears to be slightly higher in inter-arm regions compared to spiral arms.

 - **Abstract**
 Recurrent small-scale eruptions are fascinating phenomena in the solar atmosphere. However, their underlying physical mechanisms remain unclear. On 2021 May 23, five recurrent jetlets (J1-J5) were observed continuously ejecting from a satellite spot located at the north edge of AR 12824. Using high-resolution, multi-wavelength data from NVST, SDO, and IRIS, we investigate the physical characteristics of these jetlets and their relationship with the satellite spot. The widths of these jetlets range from 1300 to 2900 km, their lifetimes range span 3 to 10 minutes, and their projection speeds vary from 152.8 to 406.0 km s$^{-1}$. During the eruptions, the satellite spot moved northwest at a low speed of 376 $\pm$ 12 m s$^{-1}$. Its area gradually decreased due to magnetic cancellation with surrounding positive magnetic field, resulting in an average cancellation rate of 1.3$\times$10$^{18}$ Mx hr$^{-1}$. Dark lanes that separated from the satellite spot and small pores were observed to move toward nearby these features or dark lanes with opposite polarities, eventually disappearing during the magnetic cancellation process. J4 was driven by an eruption of a micro-filament. Spectral observations revealed a redshift on the right side of J4 and a blueshift on the left side of its base, suggesting a counterclockwise rotation. The horizontal magnetic field of the satellite spot consistently exhibited a vortex structure throughout its evolution until it vanished. The nonlinear force-free field extrapolation confirms that the satellite spot serves as one footpoint of a mini-flux rope. These observations reveal that these jetlets might result from three-dimensional null-point magnetic reconnection, initiated by the continuous eruption of a mini-flux-rope or multiple mini-flux-ropes, driven by sustained magnetic cancellation.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Mounting evidence has shown that EUV waves consist of a fast-mode magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wave (or shock wave) followed by a slower nonwave component, as predicted by the magnetic fieldline stretching model. However, not all observed events display both wavefronts, particularly the slower nonwave component. Even in case that the slower nonwave component is present, the intensity distribution often exhibits strong anisotropy. Aims. This study is intended to unveil the formation condition of the slower nonwave component of EUV waves. Methods. We analyzed the EUV wave event on 8 March 2019, and compared the EUV wave intensity map with the extrapolation coronal potential magnetic field. Data-inspired MHD simulation was also performed. Results. Two types of EUV waves are identified, and the slower nonwave component exhibits strong anisotropy. By reconstructing 3D coronal magnetic fields, we found that the slower nonwave component of EUV waves is more pronounced in the regions where magnetic fields are backward-inclined, which is further reproduced by our MHD simulations. Conclusions. The anisotropy of the slower nonwave component of EUV waves is strongly related to the magnetic configuration, with backward-inclined field lines favoring their appearance. The more the field lines are forward-inclined, the weaker such wavelike fronts are.

 - **Abstract**
 Climate transitions on exoplanets offer valuable insights into the atmospheric processes governing planetary habitability. Previous pure-steam atmospheric models show a thermal limit in outgoing long-wave radiation, which has been used to define the inner edge of the classical habitable zone and guide exoplanet surveys aiming to identify and characterize potentially habitable worlds. We expand upon previous modelling by treating (i) the dissolution of volatiles into a magma ocean underneath the atmosphere, (ii) a broader volatile range of the atmospheric composition including H2O, CO2, CO, H2, CH4 and N2, and (iii) a surface temperature- and mantle redox-dependent equilibrium chemistry. We find that multi-component atmospheres of outgassed composition located above partially or fully-molten mantles do not exhibit the characteristic thermal radiation limit that arises from pure-steam models, thereby undermining the canonical concept of a runaway greenhouse limit, and hence challenging the conventional approach of using it to define an irradiation-based habitable zone. Our results show that atmospheric heat loss to space is strongly dependent on the oxidation and melting state of the underlying planetary mantle, through their significant influence on the atmosphere's equilibrium composition. This suggests an evolutionary hysteresis in climate scenarios: initially molten and cooling planets do not converge to the same climate regime as solidified planets that heat up by external irradiation. Steady-state models cannot recover evolutionary climate transitions, which instead require self-consistent models of the temporal evolution of the coupled feedback processes between interior and atmosphere over geologic time.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the magnetic reconnection during a flare by investigating flare ribbon dynamics using observations and data-constrained magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulation. In particular, we estimate the reconnection flux and the reconnection flux rates using flare ribbons of an M1.1 flare hosted by the active region 12184 utilizing the technique developed by Qiu et al. (2002, ApJ, 565, 1335). The reconnection flux and corresponding flux rates are found to be 10^20 Mx and 10^18 Mx/s respectively. To understand the flare onset and the origin of flare ribbons, we perform an MHD simulation initiated by the non-force-free-field extrapolation. Importantly, the extrapolated configuration identifies a three-dimensional (3D) magnetic neutral point and a flux rope in the flaring region, which is crucial to the flaring activity. The reconnection initiates at the null point and, subsequently the flux rope rises and appears to reconnect there, which is favorable for the eruption of the filament. The surrounding field lines also seem to take part in the null point reconnection. In later stage, a current sheet is formed below the null point ensuing a secondary reconnection near an X-type topology, further contributing to the energy release process in the flare. We trace the footpoint evolution of the field lines lying over the flare ribbons and find a significant similarity between the observed flare ribbons and the evolution of footpoints computed from the MHD simulation. We estimated induced electric field during the flare and found it to be $\approx$ .52 V/cm, a slight less value, as per many past literatures. Additional findings are the enhancement of vertical current density near the flaring ribbons, a signature of successive reconnections near the null point. Overall, the present work contributes to the understanding of the ribbon formation in a flaring process and the involved magnetic reconnection.

 - **Abstract**
 The PRIMAger instrument on board the proposed PRIMA satellite will offer the unprecedented capability to obtain hundreds of square-degree maps in polarised emission at sub-arcminute resolution in four Far-IR bands. This will open a unique window to study magnetic fields in our Galaxy. PRIMAGAL, a proposed survey of polarized dust emission in the Milky Way Galactic Plane will determine the strength and orientation of magnetic fields towards several thousands of filamentary clouds in a wide range of linear masses, column densities, evolution, star-formation rates and efficiencies, and Galactic environment. This survey will address for the first time in a statistically significant fashion the role that magnetic fields play in shaping the formation, evolution and fragmentation of dense ISM filaments down to a minimum scale of 0.4 pc up to 8 kpc distance from the Sun. A 4-band polarization survey of the Galactic Plane with |b|<1° (a total of 720 sq. deg.) can be executed by PRIMAger in about 1200 hours including all mapping and instrument overhead.

 - **Abstract**
 JWST has revealed a stunning population of bright galaxies at surprisingly early epochs, $z>10$, where few such sources were expected. Here we present the most distant example of this class yet -- MoM-z14, a luminous ($M_{\rm{UV}}=-20.2$) source in the COSMOS legacy field at $z_{\rm{spec}}=14.44^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$ that expands the observational frontier to a mere 280 million years after the Big Bang. The redshift is confirmed with NIRSpec/prism spectroscopy through a sharp Lyman-$\alpha$ break and $\approx3\sigma$ detections of five rest-UV emission lines. The number density of bright $z_{\rm{spec}}\approx14-15$ sources implied by our "Mirage or Miracle" survey spanning $\approx350$ arcmin$^{2}$ is $>100\times$ larger ($182^{+329}_{-105}\times$) than pre-JWST consensus models. The high EWs of UV lines (${\approx}15{-}35$ Å) signal a rising star-formation history, with a ${\approx}10\times$ increase in the last 5 Myr ($\rm{SFR_{\rm{5Myr}}}/\rm{SFR_{\rm{50Myr}}}=9.9^{+3.0}_{-5.8}$). The source is extremely compact (circularized $r_{\rm{e}} = 74^{+15}_{-12}$ pc), and yet resolved, suggesting an AGN is not the dominant source of light. The steep UV slope ($\beta=-2.5^{+0.2}_{-0.2}$) implies negligible dust attenuation and a young stellar population. The absence of a strong damping wing may indicate that the immediate surroundings of MoM-z14 are partially ionized at a redshift where virtually every reionization model predicts a $\approx100\%$ neutral fraction. The nitrogen emission and highly super-solar [N/C]$>1$ hint at an abundance pattern similar to local globular clusters that may have once hosted luminous supermassive stars. Since this abundance pattern is also common among the most ancient stars born in the Milky Way, we may be directly witnessing the formation of such stars in dense clusters, connecting galaxy evolution across the entire sweep of cosmic time.

 - **Abstract**
 Chemical modeling and synthetic observations are powerful methods to interpret observations, both requiring a knowledge of the physical conditions. In this paper, we present the Analytical Protostellar Environment (APE) code, which aims at making chemical simulations and synthetic observations accessible. APE contains a physical model of protostellar evolution (including the central object, the envelope, the protoplanetary disk and the outflow) as well as interfaces to publicly available codes to perform chemical simulations, radiative transfer calculations, and synthetic interferometry imaging. APE produces density and temperature maps of protostellar systems. The code can also follow individual particles throughout their journey in a collapsing core. APE includes a treatment of the dust grain size-distribution to compute opacities self-consistently for subsequent radiative transfer. We show an example of application of APE by computing chemical abundance maps of CO, CN, CS, H2CO, and CH3OH in a Class I protostellar system. We also performed synthetic ALMA observations of their molecular emission assuming an edge-on source inclination. The moment 0 maps of CO, CS, and H2CO display an X-shaped emission similar to what is observed toward the Class I source IRAS 04302+2247.

 - **Abstract**
 Surface magnetic fields are detected in less than $10\%$ of the massive O-type star population and even less frequently among `old' massive stars approaching the terminal-age main sequence (TAMS). It is unclear to what extent the rarity of magnetic detections in massive stars near the TAMS is due to magnetic field decay or observational biases. We report the detection of a weak surface magnetic field in the O-type giant 63~Oph ($T_{\mathrm{eff}}=35.0\pm0.3\,$kK, $\log g=3.51\pm0.03$) from new ESPaDOnS circularly polarized spectra. The mean longitudinal field strength associated with the magnetic detection is $\langle B_{z}\rangle=84\pm14\,$G, which we use to set a lower limit on the dipolar field strength of $B_{\mathrm{p}}\geq300\pm50\,$G. We report Balmer line equivalent widths (EW) and radial velocity (RV) measurements from the analysis of spectra primarily obtained by the IACOB project with the FEROS, FIES and HERMES spectrographs. We identify a dominant period of $\sim19.8\,$d in the EWs which we attribute to the effects of a rotating magnetosphere under the Oblique Rotator Model. We do not identify any coherent signals in a time-series analysis of archival Hipparcos, ASAS-SN and K2 photometry. Our findings show that 63~Oph may be a rare link between strongly magnetic massive stars detected on or near the zero-age main sequence and weakly-magnetic O-type supergiants. Additional observations are needed to fully constrain 63~Oph's magnetic field geometry and magnetospheric properties.

 - **Abstract**
 A new method for determining the accelerating potential above the polar caps of radio pulsars with an arbitrary inclination angle of the magnetic axis to the rotation axis has been proposed. The approach has been based on the concept of a vacuum gap, the height and shape of the upper boundary of which are found self-consistently together with the solution of the corresponding Poisson equation. In turn, information about the accelerating potential has made it possible to determine the transverse profiles of the secondary plasma density. It has also been shown that the effect of inverse Compton scattering on the considered processes is insignificant.

 - **Abstract**
 We utilize the Monte-Carlo radiation transport code, \pan, to create images, spectra, polarization maps, and light curves from a set of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of tilted, truncated, black hole accretion disks. Truncation can have spectral and polarization signatures all its own; tilt introduces both inclination and azimuthal dependencies into the spectra and polarization; and precession and oscillations of the tilted accretion flow inside the truncation radius (what we posit to be the "corona") introduce time dependencies or periodicity to all of this. We use the ray-traced results from our simulations to evaluate the feasibility of measuring these effects, particularly in the context of current and future X-ray polarization observatories. Such detections could greatly improve our understanding of the geometry of accretion disks and coronae in the hard state, the physics of quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs), and how system properties evolve as sources approach the hard-to-soft state transition.

 - **Abstract**
 This study characterises the radio luminosity functions (RLFs) for SFGs and AGN using statistical redshift estimation in the absence of comprehensive spectroscopic data. Sensitive radio surveys over large areas detect many sources with faint optical and infrared counterparts, for which redshifts and spectra are unavailable. This challenges our attempt to understand the population of radio sources. Statistical tools are often used to model parameters (such as redshift) as an alternative to observational data. Using the data from GAMA G23 and EMU early science observations, we explore simple statistical techniques to estimate the redshifts in order to measure the RLFs of the G23 radio sources as a whole and for SFGs and AGN separately. Redshifts and AGN/SFG classifications are assigned statistically for those radio sources without spectroscopic data. The calculated RLFs are compared with existing studies, and the results suggest that the RLFs match remarkably well for low redshift galaxies with an optical counterpart. We use a more realistic high redshift distribution to model the redshifts of (most likely) high redshift radio sources and find that the LFs from our approach match well with measured LFs. We also look at strategies to compare the RLFs of radio sources without an optical counterpart to existing studies.

 - **Abstract**
 Active galactic nuclei formation and evolution is currently an open puzzle. Their enormous mass is not explainable via sub-Eddington accretion and the frequent presence of relativistic jets at high-z, commonly linked with spinning black holes, suggest a less effective accretion process. NVSS J151002+570243 is part of this population, being the most distant blazar consistently detected by Fermi/LAT, hence hosting a powerful jet. We tested the hypothesis of a super-Eddington accretion process for this source by modeling its big blue bump with a set of accretion disk emission models. We first tested a standard geometrically thin, optically thick $\alpha$-disk, obtaining a mass of Log$M/M_\odot=8.65\pm0.19$ consistent with virial-based results and a significantly sub-Eddington accretion rate $\lambda=0.02\pm0.01$. We then focused on the analytic approximations of two numerical models that take into account the General Relativity effects of a spinning black hole (reasonable due to the presence of a jet) and a close-to- or super-Eddington accretion rate (KERBB and SLIMBH). Despite the focus on super-critical accretion, these models confirm a surprisingly low Eddington ratio, of the order of 3\%. The hypothesis of a continuous accretion at this measured rate is unrealistic, since it would imply a seed black hole mass of $\sim10^6-10^8M_\odot$ at redshift z=20. Hence we explore the possibility of a continuous super-critical accretion starting from a $\sim10^2M_\odot$ seed, that would spin up the black hole and eventually contribute in launching the relativistic jet. The measured low accretion rate would thus happen only once the jet is active. This idea would reconcile the black holes with large masses accreting at somewhat slow rates that are observed at z>4, with the need of an extremely fast evolution, by allowing the formation of stellar-size black hole seeds even as late as at $z\sim8$.
