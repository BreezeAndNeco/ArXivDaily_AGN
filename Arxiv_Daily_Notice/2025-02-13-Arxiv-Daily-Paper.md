 - **Abstract**
 Pre-Gaia distances for the open cluster Pismis 19 disagree with Gaia parallaxes. A 2MASS $JK_s$ red clump distance was therefore established for Pismis 19 ($2.90\pm0.15$ kpc), which reaffirms that zero-point corrections for Gaia are required (e.g., Lindegren et al.~2021). OGLE GD-CEP-1864 is confirmed as a member of Pismis 19 on the basis of DR3 proper motions, and its 2MASS+VVV color-magnitude position near the tip of the turnoff. That $0^{\rm d}.3$ variable star is likely a $\delta$ Scuti rather than a classical Cepheid. The case revealed a pertinent criterion to segregate those two populations in tandem with the break in the Wesenheit Leavitt Law ($\simeq 0^{\rm d}.5$). Just shortward of that period discontinuity are $\delta$ Scutis, whereas beyond the break lie first overtone classical Cepheids mostly observed beyond the first crossing of the instability strip.

 - **Abstract**
 Star formation feedback can drive large-scale, multi-phase galactic outflows. The dynamical and thermodynamical interaction between the hot and cooler phases is a prime focus of both observational and theoretical work. Here, we analyze H$\alpha$-emitting structures in the extraplanar wind of the nearby starburst M82. We use high-resolution, narrow-band, observations from the Hubble Legacy Archive (Mutchler et al. 2007). Our analysis constrains the morphology, number density, and column density of the structures. We highlight conspicuous arc-like structures that differ significantly from the linear cometary clouds that emerge from galactic wind simulations and discuss their possible origins, such as bow shocks or instabilities driven by cosmic rays. The most prominent structures range in size from $\sim24 -110$ pc. Using the H$\alpha$ brightness and assumptions about the depth of the emitting structures, we estimate number densities of $\sim1-23$ cm$^{-3}$, which are lower than previous constraints from spectroscopic nebular line studies. The derived column densities, $\sim10^{20}-10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$, along the path of the outflow are above theoretical thresholds for cool cloud survival in a hot supersonic background, but small enough that the structures could be accelerated by the hot wind momentum. Using diffuse X-ray emission maps from $\textit{Chandra}$, we also find that even on small ($\sim100$ pc) scales, the H$\alpha$ "leads" the X-rays, a behavior long noted in the literature on kiloparsec scales, and one we observe in the brightness profiles of the structures we analyze. This behavior, along with previous observational studies of ionization in the wind, may signal that shock ionization is responsible for the H$\alpha$ emission we observe.

 - **Abstract**
 Aims: The relative roles of the physical mechanisms involved in quenching galaxy star formation are still unclear. We tackle this fundamental problem with our cosmological semi-empirical model DECODE (Discrete statistical sEmi-empiriCal mODEl), designed to predict galaxy stellar mass assembly histories, from minimal input assumptions. Methods: Specifically, in this work the star formation history of each galaxy is calculated along its progenitor dark matter halo by assigning at each redshift a star formation rate extracted from a monotonic star formation rate-halo accretion rate (SFR-HAR) relation derived from abundance matching between the (observed) SFR function and the (numerically predicted) HAR function, a relation that is also predicted by the TNG100 simulation. SFRs are integrated across cosmic time to build up the mass of galaxies, which may halt their star formation following input physical quenching recipes. Results: In this work we test the popular halo quenching scenario and we find that: 1) the assumption of a monotonic relation between SFR and HAR allows to reproduce the number densities of the bulk of star-forming galaxies in the local Universe; 2) the halo quenching is sufficient to reproduce the statistics of the quenched galaxies and flat (steep) high-mass end of the SMHM relation (SMF); and 3) to align with the observed steep (flat) low-mass end of the SMHM (SMF) additional quenching processes in the least massive haloes are needed. Conclusions: DECODE is an invaluable tool and will pave the way to investigate the origin of newly observed high-redshift objects from the latest ongoing facilities such as JWST and Euclid.

 - **Abstract**
 We present Cryoscope -- a new 50 sq. deg field-of-view, 1.2 m aperture, K-dark survey telescope to be located at Dome C, Antarctica. Cryoscope has an innovative optical-thermal design wherein the entire telescope is cryogenically cooled. Cryoscope also explores new detector technology to cost-effectively tile the full focal plane. Leveraging the dark Antarctic sky and minimizing telescope thermal emission, Cryoscope achieves unprecedented deep, wide, fast and red observations, matching and exceeding volumetric survey speeds from the Ultraviolet Explorer, Vera Rubin Observatory, and Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. By providing coverage beyond wavelengths of 2 $\mu$m, we aim to create the most comprehensive dynamic movie of the most obscured reaches of the Universe. Cryoscope will be a dedicated discovery engine for electromagnetic emission from coalescing compact binaries, Earth-like exoplanets orbiting cold stars, and multiple facets of time-domain, stellar and solar system science. In this paper, we describe the scientific drivers and technical innovations for this new discovery engine operating in the K-dark passband, why we choose to deploy it in Antarctica, and the status of a fifth-scale prototype designed as a Pathfinder to retire technological risks prior to full-scale implementation.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive study of the flaring mode of the transitional millisecond pulsar (tMSP) PSR J1023+0038 during its X-ray sub-luminous state, using strictly simultaneous X-ray, UV, optical, and radio observations. The X-ray flares exhibit UV and optical counterparts and coincide with the brightest radio flare observed in the past decade, reaching 1.2 mJy at 6 GHz and lasting ~1 hour. During the flare, the optical polarization drops from ~1.4% to ~0.5%, indicating the emergence of an unpolarized component. We propose that the thickening of the disc, which enlarges the shock region between the pulsar wind and the accretion flow and may drive the X-ray flaring observed in tMSPs, enhances the ionization level of the disc, thereby generating an increased number of free electrons. These electrons could then be channelled by magnetic field lines into the jet. This increased jet mass-loading could drive the associated radio and optical variability. The radio spectral evolution during flares is consistent with synchrotron self-absorption in jet ejecta or internal shocks within the compact jet. We infer radio polarization upper limits (<8.7%, <2.3%, and <8.2%, before, during, and after the radio flare) that further support a compact jet origin but do not rule out discrete ejections. Our findings suggest that tMSPs could serve as essential laboratories for investigating jet-launching mechanisms, mainly because they operate under very low mass accretion rates. This accretion regime has not been explored before in the context of the accretion-ejection coupling.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmological simulations are powerful tools in the context of structure formation. They allow us to explore the assembly and clustering of dark matter halos, to validate or reject possible scenarios of structure formation, and to investigate the physical properties of evolving galaxies across time. Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations are especially key to study how the complex interstellar medium of forming galaxies responds to the most energetic processes during galaxy evolution, such as stellar feedback ensuing supernova explosions and feedback from AGN. Given the huge dynamical range of physical scales spanned by the astrophysical processes involved in cosmic structure formation and evolution, cosmological simulations resort to sub-resolution models to capture processes occurring below their resolution limit. The impact of different sub-grid prescriptions accounting for the same process is striking, though often overlooked. Some among the main aforementioned processes include: hot gas cooling, star formation and stellar feedback, stellar evolution and chemical enrichment, black hole growth and feedback. Producing simulations of cosmic structure formation and galaxy evolution in large computational volumes is key to shed light on what drives the formation of the first structures in the Universe, and their subsequent evolution. Not only are predictions from simulations crucial to compare with data from ongoing observational instruments, but they can also guide future observational campaigns. Besides, since we have entered the era of high-performance computing, it is fundamental to have numerical codes which are very efficient from the computational point of view. In this chapter, we review the main hydrodynamic methods used in cosmological simulations and the most common techniques adopted to include the astrophysical processes which drive galaxy formation and evolution (abridged).

 - **Abstract**
 Time-evolving magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) coronal modeling, driven by a series of time-dependent photospheric magnetograms, represents a new generation of coronal simulations. This approach offers greater realism compared to traditional coronal models constrained by a static magnetogram. However, its practical application is seriously limited by low computational efficiency and poor numerical stability. Therefore, we propose an extended magnetic field decomposition strategy and implement it in the implicit MHD model to develop a coronal model that is both efficient and numerically stable enough for simulating the long-term evolutions of the global corona. The traditional decomposition strategies split the magnetic field into a time-invariant potential field and a time-dependent component $\mathbf{B}_1$. It works well for quasi-steady-state coronal simulations where $\left|\mathbf{B}_1\right|$ is typically small. However, as the inner-boundary magnetic field evolves, $\left|\mathbf{B}_1\right|$ can grow significantly larger and its discretization errors often lead to nonphysical negative thermal pressure, ultimately causing the code to crash. In this paper, we mitigate such undesired situations by introducing a temporally piecewise-constant variable to accommodate part of the non-potential field and remain $\left|\mathbf{B}_1\right|$ consistently small throughout the simulations. We incorporate this novel magnetic field decomposition strategy into our implicit MHD coronal model and apply it to simulate the evolution of coronal structures within 0.1 AU over two solar-maximum Carrington rotations. The results show that this coronal model effectively captures observations and performs more than 80 times faster than real time using only 192 CPU cores, making it well-suited for practical applications in simulating the time-evolving corona.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Advancements in the field of exoplanetary research have extended radial velocity (RV) observations from the optical to the near-infrared (nIR) domain. M dwarf stars, characterized by their lower masses and higher prevalence of rocky planets, have become a focal point of investigation. This study uses data from the near-infrared spectropolarimeter SPIRou and data available in the literature from the HARPS and CARMENES spectrographs operating in the optical to analyze RVs of two nearby M dwarfs, Gl 480 and Gl 382. Aims: This work aims to detect and characterize exoplanetary companions around Gl 480 and Gl 382 by mitigating stellar activity effects through advanced data analysis techniques. The study seeks to improve the reliability of RV signals by integrating multi-wavelength observations and stellar activity diagnostics. Methods: The study employs a comprehensive approach that combines the line-by-line (LBL) framework with the Wapiti (Weighted principAl comPonent analysIs reconsTructIon) method to correct for systematics in SPIRou data. Through an extensive analysis of available stellar activity indicators and by combining optical data from the HARPS and CARMENES instruments, we perform a joint analysis of RV measurements in both the nIR and optical domains. Results: Our analysis confirms the detection of a planet orbiting Gl 480 with a period of $9.5537 \pm 0.0005$ d and a minimum mass of $8.8 \pm 0.7$ M$_\oplus$. Additionally, we detect a tentative signal at 6.4 d, whose significance depends strongly on the choice of Gaussian Process priors constrained by stellar activity indicators and would require further observations for confirmation. In contrast, no planetary signals are detected for Gl 382, where RV variations are dominated by stellar activity.
#### Gaia~19cwm - a dwarf nova of WZ Sge type

 - **Abstract**
 The spectral and photometric studies of the cataclysmic variable Gaia 19cwm (or ZTF19aamkwxk) have been performed. Based on the analysis of long-term variability, it is concluded that the object belongs to WZ Sge type stars. The light curves show eclipses recurring with an orbital period of $86.32048 \pm 0.00005$ min, as well as an out-of-eclipse variability with a period of $\approx 6.45$ min. The latter period is stable for $\sim 4$ years and appears to correspond to the rotation of a magnetic white dwarf, i.e., Gaia 19cwm is an intermediate polar. The Gaia 19cwm spectra show photospheric lines of the white dwarf, and Doppler tomograms demonstrate the presence of an accretion disk and a hot spot. Analysis of the eclipse light curve gives an estimates of the white dwarf mass $M_1 = 0.66\pm0.06$ M$_{\odot}$, the donor mass $M_2 = 0.073 \pm 0.015$ M$_{\odot}$, and the orbital inclination $i=83.8 \pm 1.1^{\circ}$. Modeling of the spectral energy distribution gives the white dwarf temperature of $T_{eff}\approx 13000 $ K. The X-ray luminosity $L_X = (1.6 \pm 0.3) \times 10^{31}$ erg/s allows to assign Gaia 19cwm to a small group of low-luminosity intermediate polars.

 - **Abstract**
 The polar magnetic field plays a crucial role in the solar dynamo model and contributes to predicting future solar cycles. However, continuous and direct measurements of this polar field have been available only since 1976, with data provided by the Wilcox Solar Observatory (WSO). Recent findings suggest that the Ca ii K Polar Network Index (PNI) can serve as a promising proxy for estimating the polar field of the Sun. In this study, we aim to reconstruct the polar field for the pre-1976 period by leveraging Ca ii K data from the Kodaikanal Solar Observatory (KoSO; 1904-2007) and modern Ca ii K observations from the Rome Precision Solar Photometric Telescope (Rome-PSPT; 2000-2022). We employ an automatic adaptive threshold technique to detect polar networks and calculate PNI values. Then, we calibrate these PNI values with the WSO polar field to reconstruct the polar field over 119 years.

 Wereportthefirstmulti-epochmilliarcsecondresolutionimagingofthe6.7-GHzclassIImethanolmaseremissionassociated with the high-mass protocluster system NGC6334I. The observations cover 4 epochs over a 10-year period between March 2010 and March 2020. We confirm the emergence of a number of new regions of 6.7-GHz methanol maser emission in the molecular gas surrounding NGC6334-MM1, which lies north of the previously known class II methanol maser sites which are associated with NGC6334-MM3 and -MM2. The new maser emission is located close to the strongest (sub)millimetre source in the NGC6334I cluster MM1B which experienced a sudden increase in intensity in 2015, produced by an episodic accretion event. We are able to compare the location and intensity of the 6.7-GHz methanol maser emission before, during, and after the flare, providing new insights into the relationship between maser flares and periodic accretion events in high-mass stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Supernova explosions (SNe) are among the most energetic events in the Universe. After the explosion, the material ejected by the Supernova expands throughout the interstellar medium (ISM) forming what is called Supernova Remnant (SNR). Shocks associated with the expanding SNR are sources of galactic cosmic rays, that can reach energy of the PeV order. In these processes, a key role is played by the magnetic field. It is known that the ISM is turbulent with an observed magnetic field of about a few $\mu$G, made by the superposition of a uniform and a fluctuating component. During the SNR expansion, the shock interacts with a turbulent environment, leading to a distortion of the shock front and a compression of the medium. In this work, we use the MagnetoHydroDynamics (MHD) PLUTO code to mimic the evolution of the blast wave associated with the SNR. We make a parametric study varying the level of density and magnetic field fluctuations in the interstellar medium, with the aim of understanding the best parameter values able to reproduce real observations. We introduce a novel analysis technique based on two-dimensional autocorrelation function $C({\ell})$ and the second order structure function $S_2(\ell)$, quantifying the level of anisotropy and the turbulence correlation lengths. By interpolating the autocorrelation function on a polar grid, we extract the power spectra of turbulence at the SNR. Finally, a preliminary comparison with Chandra observations of SN 1006 is also presented.

 - **Abstract**
 This work explores the impacts of magnetogram projection effects on machine learning-based solar flare forecasting models. Utilizing a methodology proposed by Falconer et al. (2016), we correct for projection effects present in Georgia State University's Space Weather Analytics for Solar Flares (SWAN-SF) benchmark data set. We then train and run a support vector machine classifier on the corrected and uncorrected data, comparing differences in performance. Additionally, we provide insight into several other methodologies that mitigate projection effects, such as stacking ensemble classifiers and active region location-informed models. Our analysis shows that data corrections slightly increase both the true positive (correctly predicted flaring samples) and false positive (non-flaring samples predicted as flaring) prediction rates, averaging a few percent. Similarly, changes in performance metrics are minimal for the stacking ensemble and location-based model. This suggests that a more complicated correction methodology may be needed to see improvements. It may also indicate inherent limitations when using magnetogram data for flare forecasting.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigated mini-filament (MF) eruptions near coronal hole (CH) boundaries to explore their role in coronal dynamics and their potential contributions to the solar wind. Using high-resolution H$\alpha$ images from the 1.6m Goode Solar Telescope at Big Bear Solar Observatory and EUV data from AIA 193 Å~ from Solar Dynamic Observatory, we analyzed 28 MFE events over 7.5 hours of observation spanning 5 days. Three largest MF eruptions triggered distinct coronal responses: two consecutive MFEs produced a small-scale eruptive coronal ejection, while the other generated a jet-like brightening. Furthermore, the 25 smaller-scale MFEs were associated with localized brightenings in coronal bright points (CBPs). These findings suggest that MFs play a significant role in transferring mass and magnetic flux to the corona, particularly within CH regions. We found certain trend that the size of MFEs is correlated with the EUV emissions. In addition, we observed magnetic flux cancellation associated with MFEs. However, except for a few largest MFEs, quantitative analysis of magnetic field evolution is beyond the capability of the data. These results underscore the importance of MFEs in the dynamic coupling between the chromosphere and corona, highlighting their potential role in shaping heliospheric structures. Although current study covers smallest MFEs ever studied, future higher-cadence, more accurate magnetograms and multi-wavelength observations are essential to fully resolve the fine-scale dynamics of these ubiquitous solar phenomena.

 - **Abstract**
 The $k$-Nearest Neighbour Cumulative Distribution Functions are measures of clustering for discrete datasets that are fast and efficient to compute. They are significantly more informative than the 2-point correlation function. Their connection to $N$-point correlation functions, void probability functions and Counts-in-Cells is known. However, the connections between the CDFs and other geometric and topological spatial summary statistics are yet to be fully explored in the literature. This understanding will be crucial to find optimally informative summary statistics to analyse data from stage 4 cosmological surveys. We explore quantitatively the geometric interpretations of the $k$NN CDF summary statistics. We establish an equivalence between the 1NN CDF at radius $r$ and the volume of spheres with the same radius around the data points. We show that higher $k$NN CDFs are equivalent to the volumes of intersections of $\ge k$ spheres around the data points. We present similar geometric interpretations for the $k$NN cross-correlation joint CDFs. We further show that the volume, or the CDFs, have information about the angles and arc lengths created at the intersections of spheres around the data points, which can be accessed through the derivatives of the CDF. We show this information is very similar to that captured by Germ Grain Minkowski Functionals. Using a Fisher analysis we compare the information content and constraining power of various data vectors constructed from the $k$NN CDFs and Minkowski Functionals. We find that the CDFs and their derivatives and the Minkowski Functionals have nearly identical information content. However, $k$NN CDFs are computationally orders of magnitude faster to evaluate. Finally, we find that there is information in the full shape of the CDFs, and therefore caution against using the values of the CDF only at sparsely sampled radii.
