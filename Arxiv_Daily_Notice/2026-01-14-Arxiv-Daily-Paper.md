#### Intermediate-mass black hole incubators. Gas accretion onto stellar black hole clusters in galactic central molecular zones

 - **Abstract**
 The stellar dynamical evolution of massive star clusters formed during starburst periods leads to the segregation of $\gtrsim10^4 M_\odot$ stellar-mass black hole sub-clusters in their centres. In gas-rich environments, such as galactic central molecular zones, these black hole clusters are likely to accrete large amounts of the gas from their surroundings, which in turn affects their internal dynamics. In this Letter we estimated the corresponding accretion rate onto the black hole cluster and its radiative feedback. We assessed whether such an accretion flow can lead to the collapse of the black hole cluster into an intermediate-mass black hole. The estimates were obtained analytically, considering the astrophysical conditions and star formation history reported for the central molecular zone of our Galaxy. We find that a stellar black hole cluster with mass $\gtrsim10^4 M_\odot$ located in the twisted ring of molecular clouds with radius $\approx100$ pc that is observed in the central molecular zone of our Galaxy can accrete about the same mass in gas on a timescale of a few million years. We suggest that this is sufficient for its subsequent collapse into an intermediate-mass black hole. Based on an estimate of the dynamical friction inspiral time, we further argue that the locations of the intermediate-mass black hole candidates recently observed in the central molecular zone are compatible with their formation therein during the last starburst period reported to have occurred $\approx1$ Gyr ago.

 - **Abstract**
 The nucleus of the Milky Way is known to drive a large-scale, multiphase galactic outflow, with gas phases ranging from the hot highly-ionized to the cold molecular component. In this work, we present the first systematic search for molecules in the Milky Way wind. We use the Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX) to observe the 12CO(2-1) emission line in 19 fields centered on previously known high-velocity atomic hydrogen (HI) clouds associated with the outflow. Over 200 CO clumps are detected within 16 different HI clouds. These clumps have typical radii of 1 - 3 parsec, high velocity dispersions of 1 - 6 km/s and molecular gas masses ranging from a few to several hundred solar masses. Molecular clumps in the wind sit on the low-mass end of the mass - size relation of regular molecular clouds, but are far displaced from the mass (or size) - linewidth relation, being generally more turbulent and showing high internal pressures. Nearly 90% of the clumps are gravitationally unbound with virial parameters >> 10 - 100, indicating that these structures are either being disrupted or they must be confined by external pressure from the surrounding hot medium. While the observed properties of CO clumps do not seem to evolve clearly with latitude, we find that molecular gas is not detected in any of the 6 HI clouds with projected distances over 1 kpc from the Galactic Center, suggesting the existence of a maximum timescale of ~ 3 Myr for the dissociation of molecular gas within the wind. Overall, current observations in the Galactic center support a scenario in which a hot wind entrains cold gas clouds from the disk, driving their progressive transformation from molecular to atomic and ultimately ionized gas through stripping, turbulence, and dissociation.

 - **Abstract**
 The properties of substructure in galaxy clusters, exquisitely probed by gravitational lensing, offer a stringent test of dark matter models. Combining strong and weak lensing data for massive clusters, we map their total mass--dominated by dark matter--over the dynamic range needed to confront small-scale predictions for collisionless cold dark matter (CDM). Using state-of-the-art lens models, we extract four key subhalo properties: the mass function, projected radial distribution, internal density profile, and tidal truncation radius. We find that the subhalo mass function and truncation radii are consistent with CDM expectations. In contrast, the inner density profiles and radial distribution of subhalos are strongly discrepant with CDM. The incidence of galaxy-galaxy strong lensing (GGSL) from subhalo cores exceeds CDM predictions by nearly an order of magnitude, requiring inner density slopes as steep as $\gamma \gtrsim 2.5$ within $r \lesssim 0.01\,R_{200}$ consistent with core-collapsed self-interacting dark matter (SIDM), while the same subhalos behave as collisionless in their outskirts. Additionally, the observed radial distribution of subhalos hosting bright cluster member galaxies, explicitly modeled in the lens reconstructions, remains incompatible with CDM. Together, these small-scale stress tests reveal an intriguing paradox and challenge the dark matter microphysics of purely collisionless CDM and motivate hybrid scenarios, such as a dual-component model with both CDM and SIDM, or entirely new classes of dark matter theories.

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce an effective framework to model star-formation burstiness and use it to jointly fit galaxy UV luminosity functions (UVLFs), clustering, and H$\alpha$/UV ratios, providing the first robust empirical evidence that early galaxies hosted in lower-mass halos are burstier. Using $z\sim 4-6$ observations, we find that galaxies show approximately $0.6$ dex of SFR variability if hosted in halos of $M_h = 10^{11}\, M_\odot$ (typical of $M_{\rm UV}\approx -19$ galaxies at $z = 6$). This translates into a scatter of $\sigma_{M_{\rm UV}}\approx 0.75$ in the UVLF, in line with past findings. Strikingly, we find that burstiness grows for galaxies hosted in smaller halos, reaching $\gtrsim 1$ dex for $M_h \leq 10^{9}\, M_\odot$ (corresponding to $\sigma_{M_{\rm UV}} \approx 1.5$ for faint $M_{\rm UV} \gtrsim -15$ galaxies). Extrapolating to higher redshifts, when small halos were more prevalent, the inferred mass-dependent burstiness can reproduce observed UVLFs up to $z\sim 17$ within 1$\sigma$, potentially alleviating the tension between pre- and post-JWST galaxy-formation models. Current observations allow us to constrain burst timescales to approximately $20$ Myr, consistent with expectations from supernova feedback, and suggest broad distributions of ionizing efficiencies at fixed $M_{\rm UV}$. Our results demonstrate that mass-dependent burstiness, as predicted by hydrodynamical simulations, is critical for understanding the mass assembly of early galaxies.
#### MUSEQuBES: Investigating the Physical and Chemical Properties of Circumgalactic Gas Around Ly$α$ Emitters at $z \approx 3.3$

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed study of the physical properties of absorbers associated with $z\approx3.3$ \lya\ emitters (LAEs) from the MUSEQuBES survey. Using \HI\ and ionic column densities derived from Voigt profile fitting, we determine the density and metallicity of 75 absorbers associated with 59 LAEs through a custom-built Bayesian framework. The overall sample shows a median density $\log\,(n_{\rm H}/{\rm cm^{-3}})=-2.7\pm0.7$ and metallicity \met$=-1.6^{+1.2}_{-0.9}$ with $\approx15\%$ ($\approx 40\%$ including upper limits) of systems showing metallicities consistent with the IGM at these redshifts (\met$\lesssim -2.8$). Intriguingly, absorbers with $\log\, N(\rm HI)/{\rm cm^{-2}} \gtrsim 16.5$, corresponding to an overdensity of $\sim 100$ at $z=3$, exhibit a bimodal metallicity distribution with peaks at \met$=-3.8\pm 0.2$ and $-1.8\pm 0.6$. The latter are observed at large impact parameters ($\gtrsim150$~pkpc) and often exhibit low-ionization species (e.g., \SiII, \AlII). We interpret the former as pristine inflowing gas from the cosmic web, while the latter likely traces metal-enriched CGM associated with outflows from faint galaxies not detected in Ly$\alpha$ emission. We find no significant correlations between absorber metallicity or density and host galaxy properties, including redshift, impact parameter, SFR, Ly$\alpha$ luminosity, or environment. Absorbers separated by $\lesssim500$~\kms\ show $\sim$1~dex metallicity and $\sim$0.5~dex density variations, indicating physical and chemical inhomogeneity of the medium around these LAEs.

 - **Abstract**
 Rapidly rotating, strongly magnetized neutron stars (``millisecond proto-magnetars'') formed in stellar core-collapse, neutron star mergers, and white dwarf accretion-induced collapse have long been proposed as central engines of gamma-ray bursts (GRB) and accompanying supernovae/kilonovae. However, during the first few seconds after birth, neutrino heating drives baryon-rich winds from the neutron star surface, potentially limiting the magnetization and achievable Lorentz factors of the outflow and casting doubt on whether proto-magnetars can launch ultra-relativistic jets at early times, as needed to power short-duration GRB. We present 3D general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of neutrino-heated proto-magnetar winds that incorporate M0 neutrino transport. While the global wind properties broadly agree with previous analytic estimates calibrated to one-dimensional models, our simulations reveal essential multidimensional effects. For rapidly rotating models with spin periods P = 1 ms, centrifugal forces strongly enhance mass loss near the rotational equator, producing a dense, sub-relativistic outflow ( ~0.1c). This equatorial wind naturally confines and collimates less baryon-loaded outflows emerging from higher latitudes, leading to the formation of a structured bipolar jet with a peak magnetization up to ~ 30-100 along the pole, sufficient to reach bulk Lorentz factors ~ 100 on larger scales. The resulting angular stratification of the outflow energy into ultra-relativistic polar and sub-relativistic equatorial components is broadly consistent with the observed partition between beaming-corrected GRB energies and supernova/kilonova ejecta. Our results demonstrate that millisecond proto-magnetars can launch relativistic jets within seconds of formation and highlight their potential role in powering the diverse electromagnetic counterparts of compact-object explosions.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar bow shocks are formed when an outflow interacts with the interstellar medium. In white dwarfs accreting from a binary companion, outflows are associated with either strong winds from the donor star, the accretion disk, or a thermonuclear runaway explosion on the white dwarf surface. To date, only six accreting white dwarfs are known to harbour disk-wind driven bow shocks that are not associated to thermonuclear explosions. Here, we report the discovery of a bow shock associated with a high-proper-motion disk-less accreting white dwarf, 1RXS J052832.5+283824. We show that the white dwarf has a strong magnetic field in the range B~42-45 MG, making RXJ0528+2838 the a bonafide known polar-type cataclysmic variable harbouring a bow shock. The resolved bow shock is shown to be inconsistent with a past thermonuclear explosion, or being inflated by a donor wind, ruling out all accepted scenarios for inflating a bow shock around this system. Modelling of the energetics reveals that the observed bow shock requires a persistent power source with a luminosity significantly exceeding the system accretion energy output. This implies the presence of a powerful, previously unrecognized energy loss mechanism - potentially tied to magnetic activity - that may operate over sufficiently long timescales to influence the course of binary evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 We present Sahyadri, a suite of cosmological $N$-body simulations designed to enable precision studies of the low-redshift Universe with next-generation spectroscopic surveys. Sahyadri includes systematic variations of six cosmological parameters around Planck 2018 constraints, with seed-matched initial conditions enabling cosmological parameter derivatives. Each simulation evolves $2048^3$ particles in a periodic box of side length $200$ $h^{-1}$ Mpc, yielding a particle mass of $m_{\rm{p}} = 8.1 \times 10^{7}\,h^{-1}\,M_{\odot}$ in the fiducial Planck 2018 cosmology. This resolution enables robust identification of dark matter halos down to $M_{\rm min} = 3.2 \times 10^{9}$ $h^{-1}$ $M_\odot$, which represents a factor of $\sim$25 improvement over the AbacusSummit suite, and is over two orders of magnitude better than the Quijote and Aemulus suites. We estimate that approximately 40% of DESI BGS galaxies at redshift $z < 0.15$ - roughly 1.6 million objects - reside in halos accessible to Sahyadri but beyond the reach of existing parameter-varying simulation suites. We demonstrate Sahyadri's capabilities through measurements of the matter power spectrum, halo mass function and power spectrum, and beyond 2-point statistics such as the Voronoi volume function and $k^{\rm th}$ nearest neighbour statistics, showing excellent agreement with theoretical predictions and significant sensitivity to $\Omega_{\rm m}$ variations. We implement a custom compression scheme reducing storage requirements by a factor of $\sim$3 while maintaining sub-percent clustering accuracy. Key data products will be made publicly available.

 We report the discovery of ATLAS J101342.5-451646.8 (hereafter ATLAS J1013-4516), an eclipsing, mass-transferring AM Canum Venaticorum binary with an 8.56-minute orbital period, identified via periodic variability in light curves from the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System survey of Gaia white dwarf candidates. Follow-up spectroscopy with the Large Lenslet Array Magellan Spectrograph reveals a helium-dominated accretion disk, while high-speed photometry with ULTRACAM shows pronounced primary and secondary eclipses. We construct a decade-long timing baseline using data from ATLAS, Gaia, ULTRACAM on the Gran Telescopio Canarias, and the proto-Lightspeed instrument on the Magellan Clay telescope. From this baseline, we measure an orbital period derivative of dP/dt = -1.60 +/- 0.07 x 10^-12 seconds per second. Interpreted in the context of stable mass transfer, the magnitude and sign of the period derivative indicate that the orbital evolution is governed by the interplay between gravitational-wave-driven angular momentum losses and mass transfer, directly probing the donor star's structural response to mass loss. Assuming angular momentum loss dominated by gravitational wave emission, we constrain the component masses and infer the characteristic gravitational wave strain of the system for future space-based observatories such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna. We predict a characteristic strain corresponding to a four-year signal-to-noise ratio greater than approximately 20, establishing ATLAS J1013-4516 as a strong prospective source for probing long-term orbital evolution in the mass-transferring regime.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Cosmic voids are underdense regions of the Universe that provide a unique environment to study galaxy evolution in relative isolation. Galaxy triplets in voids are rare systems where local interactions may strongly influence galaxy properties. Aims. We study the stellar populations, morphologies, mass assembly histories, and dynamical properties of six galaxies belonging to two void triplets from the Calar Alto Void Integral-field Treasury surveY (CAVITY): CAVITY5273X and VGS31. Methods. We used integral-field unit spectroscopy and performed full spectral fitting with the FADO code, which models stellar and nebular emission simultaneously. Spatially resolved maps of stellar age, metallicity, and star formation rate were reconstructed using the integrated nested Laplace approximation. Morphological properties were derived using morfometryka, emission-line diagnostics were applied, and mass assembly functions were computed. Stellar masses and metallicities were compared to the mass-metallicity relation for void galaxies. Results. The two triplets show different evolutionary behaviours. CAVITY52731 is a massive quenched galaxy hosting an active galactic nucleus, while its companions and all galaxies in VGS31 are dominated by young stellar populations and recent star formation. Five galaxies experienced rapid stellar mass growth in the last 2 Gyr. Disturbed morphologies, including asymmetries and tidal features, indicate ongoing interactions. Galaxies in CAVITY5273X follow the expected void mass-metallicity relation, while VGS31 members show significant deviations. Conclusions. Our results show that local interactions can drive significant galaxy evolution even in the most underdense cosmic environments.
#### Evidence of Feedback Effects in Low-luminosity Active Galactic Nuclei Revealed by JWST Spectroscopy

 - **Abstract**
 This letter presents an analysis of the infrared ($\sim 3-28\,\mu m$) spectra extracted from the nuclear ($r < 150$ pc) regions of four low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGN), observed by JWST NIRSpec/IFU and MIRI/MRS as an extension of the Galaxy Activity, Torus, and Outflow Survey (GATOS). We find that, compared to higher-luminosity AGN, these low-luminosity AGN exhibit distinct properties in their emission of ionized gas, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and molecular hydrogen (H$_2$). Specifically, the low-luminosity AGN exhibit relatively weak high-ionization potential lines (e.g., [Ne V] and [O IV]), and the line ratios suggest that fast radiative shocks (with $v_{\rm s}$ of $\sim \rm 100s\,km\,s^{-1}$) are the primary excitation source of ionized gas therein. Under the low-excitation conditions of their nuclear regions, these low-luminosity AGN generally exhibit a higher fraction of PAHs with large size ($N_{\rm C} \gtrsim 200$), reflecting the preferential destruction of smaller PAH molecules by AGN feedback. Furthermore, the H$_2$ transitions in these low-luminosity AGN are not fully thermalized, with slow, plausibly jet-driven molecular shocks (with $v_{\rm s} \leq \rm 10\,km\,s^{-1}$) likely being the extra excitation source. Taken together with results from the literature, these findings indicate that feedback operates in both low- and high-luminosity AGN, albeit its impact varies with AGN luminosity. In particular, systematic variations in PAH band ratios are found across AGN, demonstrating the differing influence of feedback in AGN of varying luminosities and highlighting the potential of PAH band ratios as diagnostics for distinguishing kinetic- and radiative-mode AGN feedback.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently Quenched Elliptical galaxies (RQEs) represent a critical phase in the transition from star-forming to quiescent galaxies. However, the mechanisms driving their quenching remain elusive. We conduct a multi-wavelength analysis of 155 RQEs, along with their precursors (preRQEs) and descendants (postRQEs), focusing on their neutral hydrogen (HI) content and star formation properties. Contrary to conventional quenching models emphasizing gas depletion, RQEs retain substantial HI reservoirs ($f_{\text{gas}} \geq 17\%$), suggesting that quenching is not primarily driven by gas exhaustion. We identify a critical halo mass threshold at $\log M_{\text{halo}} = 12.1 M_{\odot}$, delineating different evolutionary pathways for RQEs. This threshold aligns with the transition from cold-mode to hot-mode gas accretion in theoretical models. RQEs in lower-mass halos ($\log M_{\text{halo}} < 12.1 M_{\odot}$) likely experience rapid quenching, possibly initiated by major mergers, followed by brief AGN activity and sustained LINER emission. We propose two evolutionary pathways: (a) rapid quenching via major mergers followed by AGN/LINER activity and passive evolution, and (b) rapid quenching followed by rejuvenation through minor mergers before evolving into more massive, long-term quenched ellipticals. These results challenge the conventional understanding of galaxy quenching, especially in low-density environments where RQEs typically reside. Our findings suggest that while RQEs may follow a rapid quenching pathway, their evolution is influenced by interactions between gas accretion modes, feedback mechanisms, and environmental factors. Future observations with advanced radio interferometers like SKA will be crucial for elucidating the quenching mechanisms in RQEs and their role in galaxy evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 The Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) glossary is vast and complex. Depending on selection method, observing wavelength, and brightness, AGNs are assigned distinct labels, yet the relationship between different selection methods and the diversity of time-domain behavior within and across classes remains difficult to characterize in a unified framework. Changing-look AGNs (CLAGNs), which transition between classifications over time, further complicate this picture. In this work, we learn a data-driven, low-dimensional representation of multi-wavelength photometric light curves of AGNs, in which the structure of the projected manifold correlates with AGN class and independent spectroscopic properties. Using the NASA Fornax Science Platform, we assemble light curves from ZTF, Pan-STARRS, Gaia, and WISE/NEOWISE for two samples: (1) a heterogeneous set of $\sim$2000 AGNs spanning $z \lesssim 1$, including SDSS quasars, variability-selected sources, and CLAGNs; and (2) a homogeneous sample of $\sim$65000 narrow-line AGNs at $z \approx 0.1$ with well-characterized optical emission-line measurements. Without using class labels during training, the learned manifolds organize variability-selected AGNs into coherent regions of the low-dimensional space, distinguish between turn-on and turn-off CLAGNs, and place tidal disruption events in distinct regions. Manifold coordinates correlate with key spectroscopic and host-galaxy properties, including stellar mass, [OIII] luminosity, and D$_n$(4000), demonstrating that heterogeneous multi-band variability can be combined in a purely data-driven manner to recover correlations with independent physical diagnostics, without requiring explicit physical modeling. These results show that manifold learning offers a practical, assumption-light approach for integrating time-domain surveys and prioritizing spectroscopic follow-up.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations of galaxies continue to reveal new ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs), increasing their known population and improving the statistics needed to understand their nature. We study the ULX populations of NGC 4631 and NGC 1097 using archival Chandra, XMM-Newton, and Swift/XRT observations to identify new ULXs and investigate their X-ray and optical properties. We analyzed X-ray data spanning 2000-2025. Spectral fitting was performed for sources with sufficient counts using absorbed power-law and diskbb models. Variability analyses, including hardness-intensity diagrams and light curves, were used to assess short- and long-term variability. Optical color-magnitude diagrams and near-infrared (NIR) spectral energy distributions (SEDs) were employed to identify possible donor stars. In NGC 4631, we identified two new transient ULXs, X-6 and X-7, with X-ray count rates varying by more than an order of magnitude. The LX-T^4 relation from diskbb fits provides strong evidence that NGC 4631 X-6 is powered by a stellar-mass black hole accreting via a standard disk. The optical sources within the X-ray error circles of X-6 and X-7 are candidate counterparts, suggesting these systems are candidate HMXBs. In NGC 1097, we discovered a new transient ULX, ULX-3, showing X-ray luminosity variations by a factor of about 30 and evidence for spectral state transitions, consistent with either a stellar-mass black hole or a neutron star. We identified a unique optical and NIR counterpart. While the optical emission is variable, the NIR emission is stable. The NIR SED is consistent with a blackbody temperature of about 3300 K, compatible with a red supergiant donor with a radius of about 200 solar radii.

 - **Abstract**
 Type Ia supernovae, type II supernovae, and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars are important sites of stellar nucleosynthesis, but they differ greatly in their rates, their location within a galaxy, and the mean thermal energy and abundance distribution of their ejecta. In earlier papers in this series we have shown that a significant fraction of metals newly synthesized by type II supernovae are promptly lost to galactic winds -- i.e., galactic winds are metal loaded. Here we investigate whether the elements returned by type Ia supernovae and AGB stars are similarly metal loaded, or whether metal loading varies significantly with nucleosynthetic site. We use a series of high-resolution ``tall box'' simulations of the interstellar medium with the \quokka~GPU-accelerated code, within which we systematically vary the galaxy gas surface density, metallicity, and the scale heights and relative rates of the different nucleosynthetic sources. We show that the metal loadings of galactic winds differ substantially between metals produced by different sources, with typical variations at the level of $\approx 0.3$ dex, a phenomenon we term differential metal loading. Which set of metals suffers preferential loss from this phenomenon varies depending on the galactic environment, and is not easily predictable \textit{a priori}. Our findings call into question the the interpretation of diagnostics of galaxy formation, for example star formation timescales and initial mass functions, based on abundance diagnostics, since the abundance variations upon which these techniques rely are often at levels comparable to those we show can be induced by differential metal loading.

 - **Abstract**
 With upcoming facilities capable of detecting photometric and gravitational wave signals from supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries, studying their long-term accretion-driven variability is timely. OJ287 is a bright, nearby ($z=0.3$), and well-studied candidate for a SMBH binary. As such, it is an excellent case study for how binary dynamics could influence observed active galactic nucleus (AGN) photometric variability. We present 3D hydrodynamic simulations of OJ287, using the code PHANTOM. We simulate two mass ratios: (i) M$_1$ $=$ 1.835$\times$10$^{10}$ M$_\odot$ with M$_2$ $=$ 1.4$\times$10$^{8}$ M$_\odot$, (ii) M$_1\approx$ M$_2$ ($\sim10^{8}$ M$_\odot$) along and (iii) control of a single SMBH and accretion disc. We find that the simulation with masses 1.835$\times$10$^{10}$ M$_\odot$ and 1.4$\times$10$^{8}$ M$_\odot$ evolves consistently with the most currently accepted model of OJ287 as a precessing SMBH binary. The secondary's impacts with the disc result in the formation of spiral density waves and a corresponding $\sim$10-20% increases in the mass accretion rate of the primary SMBH. The impact timings and the mass accretion rate spikes show quasi-periodic variability as a result of the precession of the secondary's orbit with intervals between impacts ranging from $\sim$ 1 year to $\sim$ 10 years. In the near-equal mass case, the disc of the primary becomes tidally disrupted after $\sim$ 2 years. Consequently, the near-equal mass system with a period of 12 years is not a viable candidate for OJ287. This modeling provides insights into the potential signatures of SMBH binaries by both gravitational wave observatories and the Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time.

 - **Abstract**
 On the framework of relativistic force-free magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, we explore the fundamental properties of strong and weak turbulent cascades using high-resolution numerical simulations in the presence of a uniform background magnetic field. We find that (1) power spectra and scale-dependent anisotropies both for the strong and weak turbulence resemble those observed in the non-relativistic MHD turbulence; (2) intermittency of magnetic fields in strong turbulence is stronger than that in the weak one; (3) generated Alfvén modes show similar energy spectra and scale-dependent anisotropies to those of non-relativistic case; (4) generated fast modes present a power spectrum similar to that of Alfvén modes, with a strong (for strong turbulence) or weak (for weak turbulence) scale-dependent anisotropy, which are significantly different from non-relativistic turbulence; and (5) applications of our numerical results to neutron star magnetospheres show that the strong (or moderately weak) turbulent cascade can explain the X-ray radiation of the Vela pulsar. Our study is of great significance for understanding energy transfer, magnetic field evolution, and particle acceleration mechanisms in extreme astrophysical environments.

 - **Abstract**
 The Andes Large area PArticle detector for Cosmic ray and Astronomy (ALPACA) is a new air-shower array experiment under construction in the Bolivian Andes, and its prototype ALPAQUITA surface array has been operating since 2023 April. In addition to the traditional $\ge$3-hit or $\ge$4-hit coincidences to trigger recording air-shower events, ALPAQUITA records the counting rates of the $\ge$1-hit and $\ge$2-hit events (Any1 and Any2, respectively). We report a successful detection of a Forbush decrease occurred on 2024 May 10 caused by a passage of an interplanetary shock formed ahead of the Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejection. The amplitude detected in the Any1 rate is 4.26$\pm$0.33% at the median primary rigidity of 76GV which is consistent with the observations with the worldwide neutron monitor and muon detector networks. Under the assumption of a power-law rigidity spectrum, we renormalized the errors of the observed amplitude ($A_{obs}$) and fitted them as a function of the median primary rigidity ($R_{m}$) of each detector and observational method. The result $A_{obs} = (10.9\% \pm 0.9\%) \times (R_{m}/10\,GV)^{-0.55 \pm 0.07}$ exhibits a hard nature of this event. Our non-detection in the Any2 rate decrease constrains the amplitude with a 2$\sigma$ upper limit to be 0.95% at 960GV. This marginally suggests an existence of a spectral softening between 100GV and 1000GV as also suggested by the Misato underground muon detector at 145GV. Although a strong geomagnetic storm was observed during this period, we conclude it does not impact our results. Our novel technique realizes a unique coverage to study the behavior of the Forbush decreases at the highest rigidity.

 - **Abstract**
 Slow-rotating evolved stars frequently exhibit radial velocity (RV) variations on annual timescales, complicated by instrumental systematics and aliasing in the one-year regime. Here we investigate the origin of the near-yearly periodicity in 2 Dra, a star located in the red-clump region, assessing possible causes between stellar activity, instrumental profile (IP) effects, sampling alias, and planetary companions. We applied two independent approaches: (1) constraining diagnostic signals and performing a correlation analysis ($r$) between period-confined signals, and (2) evaluating phase stability by partitioning Keplerian fits. These methods enabled us to examine the physical connections and phase coherence among stellar activity indicators, RV measurements, and IP diagnostics. Our analysis suggests a stellar rotation period of $\simeq270\text{--}320$\,d for 2~Dra. The 340-d RV signal does not appear to originate from stellar activity in this chromospherically quiet star ($|r| \lesssim 0.33$), nor from instrumental systematics near the annual period ($|r| \lesssim 0.1$). This conclusion is supported by contrasting phase behavior: the RV and stellar activity phases remain stable, whereas the IP phases do not. We therefore propose that the 340-d variation likely arises from either small-amplitude intrinsic variability or a tentative gas giant companion with potential weak activity-induced modulation. The case of 2~Dra provides a framework for distinguishing the origins of $\sim$1-yr RV variations in other evolved stars.

 - **Abstract**
 According to the classical AGN model, broad emission lines originate from the broad-line region (BLR) and are observable only when the attenuation by the dusty torus is small. However, we recently found several heavily-obscured ($A_V > 50$ mag) AGNs with broad H$\alpha$ detections: MCG -3-34-64, UGC 5101, and Mrk 268. To investigate the origin of the observed broad line in these AGNs, we performed multi-epoch optical spectroscopic observations to search for flux variability of the broad H$\alpha$ line. For MCG -3-34-64 and UGC 5101, no significant variability was detected, suggesting that the broad line of these AGNs may arise from sources other than the BLR. Spectral fitting analysis suggests possible large contribution of ionized outflows to the observed broad component of MCG -3-34-64, while both the outflow and scattering by polar material can explain that of UGC 5101. For Mrk 268, we detected a significant ($4.3\sigma$) flux variation of the broad H$\alpha$ line by using the flux ratio of the H$\alpha$ complex and the [SII]$\lambda\lambda6716$, 6731 doublet, indicating that the broad line originates directly from the BLR. The lack of significant flux variation in the optical continuum implies that the line of sight to the nucleus of Mrk 268 is mildly obscured. Our results demonstrate that the observed broad H$\alpha$ lines in obscured AGNs likely have multiple origins. Such complexity may introduce additional uncertainties in black hole mass measurements of distant AGNs revealed by e.g., JWST.

 - **Abstract**
 In this {\it Letter}, we present a compelling and robust argument for the roles of neutrino fast flavor conversion (FFC) in the explosion mechanism of core-collapse supernova (CCSN), combining the {\it multi-angle} FFC subgrid model rooted in quantum kinetic theory with the multi-dimensional four-species Boltzmann neutrino radiation hydrodynamics. Employing various progenitor masses and the nuclear equations of states, we find that the effect of FFC on CCSN explosion is bifurcated depending on the progenitors. For the lowest-mass progenitor, FFC facilitates the shock revival and enhances the explosion energy, whereas for higher-mass progenitors its impact is inhibitory. We identify the mass accretion rate as the key determinant governing this bifurcation. When the mass accretion rate is low (high), the contribution of FFC to neutrino heating becomes positive (negative), because the heating efficiency enhancement via FFC-driven spectral hardening of electron-type neutrinos dominates over (is outweighed by) the concurrent reduction in neutrino luminosity. Our results further highlight the limitations of approximate neutrino transport, and demonstrate that a multi-angle treatment is essential for accurately capturing FFC effects; otherwise, FFCs are missed and even generated spuriously.

 - **Abstract**
 The formation channels of binary black hole (BBH) mergers detected by the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (LVK) network remain uncertain. While BBH mergers occurring inside active galactic nucleus (AGN) disks may interact with surrounding gas and generate observable optical flares. We test this scenario by quantifying the spatial and temporal correlation between BBH events in GWTC-4.0 and AGN flares identified from six years of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) DR23 data. Using 80 BBH mergers selected for adequate localization, redshift reach, observing-epoch overlap, and ZTF sky coverage, we construct a likelihood for the flare-associated fraction, $f_{\rm flare}$, that combines each event's 3D localization with a locally estimated flare number density derived from a 3D Voronoi tessellation, while explicitly accounting for survey boundaries and incomplete catalog coverage. Adopting a 200-day post-merger time window for potential counterparts, we infer $f_{\rm flare} = 0.07_{-0.05}^{+0.25}$ (90\% confidence level). This non-zero maximum-likelihood value is driven primarily by GW190412, for which a single flare candidate (J143041.67+355703.8) is consistent in both time and spatial position. Excluding GW190412 yields results consistent with no association and an upper limit of $f_{\rm flare} < 0.17$ at 90\% confidence level. The intrinsic properties of GW190412 and the characteristics of the candidate host AGN are broadly consistent with theoretical expectations for the AGN-disk formation channel, motivating continued, targeted electromagnetic follow-up of well-localized and highly asymmetric BBH mergers in current and upcoming time-domain surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 Rotation curves are a fundamental tool in the study of galaxies across cosmic time, and with the advent of large integral field unit (IFU) kinematic surveys there is an increasing need for efficient and flexible modelling tools. We present RotCurves, a parametric forward-modeling tool designed for rotation curve analysis at high-z, correcting for ``beam smearing" by projecting and convolving the beam PSF in the plane of the galaxy. We benchmark RotCurves against the established parametric code dysmalpy using synthetic observations. The typical runtime with RotCurves is a few ~10ms, a factor 250 faster than dysmalpy for a single realization. For well-resolved systems (PSF FWHM < Reff), the mock observed rotation and dispersion curves agree to within 5% up to 3Reff, where most of the discrepancies are in the inner disk. whereas in marginally resolved systems (PSF FWHM > 1.5 Reff) discrepancies increase to up to 15%. Using a built-in MCMC fitting procedure, RotCurves recovers well the intrinsic model parameters across a wide range of galaxy properties and accounting for realistic noise patterns. Systematic biases emerge for the effective radius and for low disk masses (Mdisk < 3x10^9 Msun). We show excellent parameter recovery at high signal-to-noise ratios (S/N > 25), with increasing deviations in parameter recovery at lower S/N. RotCurves is best suited for inclinations of 10 < i < 80. RotCurves is built as an exploratory tool for rapid testing of mass model assumptions, parameter studies and for efficiently processing large samples of observational data from large IFU surveys. The code is publicly available on github.

 - **Abstract**
 The high sensitivity of the pyramid wavefront sensor has made it the preferred sensor in high contrast adaptive optics systems. Future higher contrast systems, like the Extremely Large Telescope's Planetary Camera System, will require higher performance wavefront sensing. A further performance improvement could be achieved with a polychromatic pyramid wavefront sensor by using additional information over a broader wavelength range. The development of such systems is becoming more feasible with the emergence of new detector technologies such as Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detector arrays. These are arrays of superconductor detectors that give a position, arrival time and measure of the energy for each incident photon. This paper introduces the polychromatic pyramid wavefront sensor concept by defining the technologies and techniques employed and their requirements. A method is developed to track the optical gains, taking advantage of the additional wavelength information, and used to compensate for optical gains within an optimised reconstructor to minimise noise propagation. An overview of expected performance improvement, using end-to-end simulations, is provided using the Keck II adaptive optics system as a reference design. The polychromatic pyramid wavefront sensor was shown to increase the limiting magnitude by 1 to 2 magnitudes, and the contrast by factors of 1.5 to 4, versus single band pyramid wavefront sensors, by sensing over a wavelength range approximately five to ten times broader (800-1800 nm) compared to Z band (152 nm wide) and H band (300 nm wide). Practical design and implementation issues have also been considered.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new empirical relation between the standardized magnitude ($m$) of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and redshift ($z$). Using Pantheon+ and DES-SN5YR, we find a negative linear correlation between $m-5\log(z(1+z))$ and $z$, implying that their magnitude--redshift relation can be parametrized with just two parameters: an intercept $\mathcal{M}$ and a slope $b$. This relation corresponds to the luminosity distance $d_L(z)=c\,H_0^{-1}z(1+z)10^{bz/5}$ and is valid up to at least $z\simeq1.1$. It outperforms the $\Lambda$CDM and flat $w$CDM models and the (2,1) Padé approximant for $d_L(z)$, and performs comparably to the flat $\Lambda$CDM model and the (2,1) Padé($j_0=1$) model of Hu et al. Furthermore, the relation is stable in the absence of low-$z$ SNe, making it suitable for fitting Hubble diagrams of SNe Ia without the need to add a low-$z$ sample. In deep fields in particular, assuming that the large-scale density is independent of the comoving radial coordinate, $b\propto q_0+1$. We fit the empirical relation to SN data in eight deep-field regions and find that their fitted $\mathcal{M}$ and $b$ parameters are consistent within $1.6\,\sigma$, in agreement with isotropy. The inferred $q_0$ values, ranging from $-0.6$ to $-0.4$, are consistent within $1.5\,\sigma$ and significantly lower than zero, indicating statistically consistent cosmic acceleration across all eight regions. We apply the empirical relation to the DES-Dovekie and Amalgame SN samples, finding $b$ values consistent with those from DES-SN5YR and Pantheon+. Finally, using the empirical relation in the hemispheric comparison method applied to Pantheon+ up to $z=1.1$, we find no evidence for anisotropies in $\mathcal{M}$ and $b$.

 - **Abstract**
 Binary evolution plays a central role in producing rapidly rotating stars. Previous studies have shown that mass gainers in binaries can reach critical rotation after accreting only modest amounts of material, particularly during thermal-timescale Case B mass transfer, where tidal spin-down is ineffective due to wide orbits. However, such rapid accretion often drives the mass gainer out of thermal equilibrium, and its subsequent spin evolution during thermal relaxation has not been analysed in depth. In this study, we construct a suite of accreting detailed single-star models with different accretion prescriptions, which inflate and spin up to critical rotation during the accretion. After the accretion has ended, the models relax thermally and deflate. We find that the ratio of surface to critical angular velocity decreases to subcritical values during thermal contraction, with the magnitude of this decrease correlating with the degree of thermal disequilibrium at the end of accretion. This reduction in fractional critical rotation is even stronger when internal angular momentum transport is inefficient. Detailed binary models show the same trend, indicating that the results from our toy single-star models also apply to real binary evolution. Our results highlight that binary mass transfer does not always produce critically rotating stars, but instead may yield a wide range of spin rates depending on the mass transfer and accretion history. Our findings offer new insights into the rotational properties of mass gainers in binaries, stellar merger products, and newly formed massive stars following accretion.
#### Revisiting the Great Attractor: The Local Group's streamline trajectory, cosmic velocity and dynamical fate

 - **Abstract**
 We revisit the Great Attractor using the Manticore-Local suite of digital twins of the nearby Universe. The Great Attractor concept has been proposed as an answer to three distinct questions: what sources the Local Group velocity in the cosmic microwave background frame, where present-day velocity streamlines converge, and where the Local Group is moving to. Addressing the original motivation of the Great Attractor -- explaining the Local Group cosmic velocity -- we find that mass within $155~h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$ accounts for only ${\sim}72\%$ of that velocity magnitude with ${\sim}38\,°$ directional offset. We show that even in the purely linear regime convergence within this volume is not guaranteed, particularly when also accounting for small-scale contributions to the observer velocity; no single structure, including the proposed Great Attractor, would be expected to dominate the velocity budget. Streamline convergence is smoothing-scale-dependent, transitioning from Virgo at small scales through the Hydra--Centaurus region at intermediate scales to Shapley at large scales; at intermediate smoothing the convergence point lies near Abell 3565 with an asymmetric basin of mass $\log( M / (h^{-1} \mathrm{M}_\odot)) = 16.4 \pm 0.1$ that excludes Norma. To address the third question, we evolve the Manticore-Local realisations to scale factor $a = 10$ in a new Beyond-Present-Time simulation suite and identify the asymptotic future location of the Local Group. We find that the dominant motion is towards Virgo, but even it contributes at most one third of the Local Group velocity. Our results demonstrate that the classical Great Attractor is not a dynamically dominant structure but an artifact of the instantaneous velocity field, and that no single attractor is likely to account for the Local Group motion in the cosmic rest frame.

 - **Abstract**
 PSR J1455$-$3330 is a $\sim$7.98 ms pulsar in a $\sim$76.17 day nearly circular orbit with a white dwarf companion. In this work, we combine the available Lovell, Nançay decimetric Radio Telescope, Green Bank, and MeerKAT pulsar timing data spanning $\sim$ 30 years to measure the kinematic and relativistic effects of PSR J1455$-$3330 to constrain its 3D orbital geometry and component masses. We detect a relativistic Shapiro delay signal. We measure a significant orthometric amplitude $h_3 = 0.307^{+0.022}_{-0.026}$ $\mu$s and an orthometric ratio $\varsigma = 0.551^{+0.057}_{-0.054}$. We measure the change in projected semi-major axis $\dot{x} = -202.1^{+2.5}_{-2.7} \times10^{-16} \, \rm s\,s^{-1}$ with high significance, parallax, $\varpi$ = 1.11(6) mas, parallax derived distance 0.90(5) kpc, and a precise total proper motion magnitude of 12.432(2) mas yr$^{-1}$. A self-consistent analysis of all kinematic and relativistic effects, assuming general relativity, yields two solutions: (1) a pulsar mass $M_{\rm p} = 1.39^{+0.38}_{-0.18}\, \rm M_{\odot}$, a companion mass $M_{\rm c} = 0.293^{+0.056}_{-0.026}$ $\rm M_{\odot}$, an orbital inclination, $i = 63(2)^{\circ}$, and longitude of the ascending node, $\Omega = 212(12)^{\circ}$ or (2) a pulsar mass $M_{\rm p} = 1.53^{+1.10}_{-0.22} \, \rm M_{\odot}$, a companion mass $M_{\rm c} = 0.309^{+0.163}_{-0.026}\, \rm M_{\odot}$, an orbital inclination, $i = 123(4)^{\circ}$, and longitude of the ascending node, $\Omega = 334(12)^{\circ}$. All uncertainties represent the 68.27$\%$ credibility region. These results strongly favour a helium-dominated white dwarf companion.

 - **Abstract**
 The initial mass function (IMF) is a cornerstone of star formation studies, yet its universality remains debated. We investigate the IMF in the young massive cluster RCW 36, located in the Vela Molecular Ridge and comparable to the Orion Nebula Cluster in stellar density. Our goal is to build the most complete census of RCW 36 and derive its first IMF and star-to-brown-dwarf (BD) ratio. We combine new GLAO observations from HAWK-I/VLT with archival data (2MASS, SOFI/NTT) and Gaia DR3 kinematics. Photometric accuracy and source extraction were improved using \textsc{DeNeb}, a deep-learning algorithm that removes complex nebular emission. Membership probabilities were assigned via color-magnitude diagram comparisons with a control field, and stellar masses were estimated using model isochrones. We find a revised distance of $954\pm40\,$pc and determine the IMF down to $\sim0.03\,M_{\odot}$, described by a broken power law ($dN/dM\propto M^{-\alpha}$) with $\alpha=1.62\pm0.03$ for $0.20$-$20\,M_{\odot}$ and $\alpha=0.46\pm0.14$ for $0.03$-$0.20\,M_{\odot}$. The star-BD ratio is $2$-$5$, consistent with other Galactic clusters. Lastly, through a study of the differences in the IMF within and outside $0.2\,$pc and the cumulative mass distributions for low-mass and intermediate to high-mass sources, we also detected signs of possible mass segregation within RCW 36, which should be primordial. RCW 36 shares many characteristics with other young massive clusters, such as a shallower than Salpeter high-mass slope and the possibility of mass segregation. The flatter lower-mass regime of the IMF is similar to most Galactic clusters. The star-BD ratio is also in line with the observed values in other clusters, independent of their inherent properties.

 - **Abstract**
 We present new results from the MUSE-ALMA Haloes survey, covering 79 galaxies associated with strong HI absorption at redshift about 0.5. Our ALMA Cycle 10 observations add 39 systems to the initial 21, bringing the total to 60 galaxies. CO emission is detected in 9 new galaxies, and in 12 of 60 total, doubling the number of CO-emitting HI-selected galaxies and probing 1.2 dex deeper in molecular gas mass than previous studies. These galaxies span a wide range of stellar masses and metallicities. By comparing CO(2-1) and CO(3-2) properties with star formation rates and gas-phase metallicities from VLT/MUSE and HST, we find a dual behaviour in star formation efficiency: low-mass systems follow main-sequence scaling relations, while high-mass systems show suppressed star formation. This diversity indicates that HI absorbers trace both evolved and younger galaxies, providing a key step toward completing the baryon census at redshift about 0.5.

 - **Abstract**
 We compute the full one-loop corrections to the primordial tensor power spectrum in an inflationary scenario with a non-minimally coupled spectator field, using the in-in formalism. We derive semi-analytic results for the scalar-sourced one-loop tensor spectrum and the effective tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r_{\mathrm{eff}}$ . We consider two representative coupling functions: a localized Gaussian dip (Model G), which leads to moderate loop corrections, and a rapidly oscillatory coupling (Model O), which can yield much larger loop contributions. For Model G, we find a $\mathcal{O}(1)$ correction to $r_{\mathrm{eff}}$ while Model O can significantly enhance $r_{\mathrm{eff}}$ by several orders of magnitude (relative to the tree-level value). We further calculate the energy density of primordial gravitational waves. Assuming that primordial black holes with mass $10^{-12}M_{\odot}$ generated in this scenario, constitute all of the dark matter, we find that the results are several orders of magnitude lower than the sensitivities of Taiji/TianQin/LISA.

 - **Abstract**
 JWST observations have suggested that some high-redshift galaxies may be ultra-massive, thereby challenging standard models of early galaxy formation and cosmology. We analyse the stellar masses using different modelling assumptions and with new data of three galaxies (S1, S2 and S3), whose NIRCam/grism redshifts were consistent with $z>5$. These three optically dark galaxies have previously been reported to host exceptionally high stellar masses and star-formation rates, implying extremely high star-formation efficiencies. Recent NIRSpec/IFU observations for S1 indicate a spectroscopic redshift of $z_{\rm spec}=3.2461^{+0.0001}_{-0.0002}$, which is lower than previously reported. Using the Bayesian spectral energy distribution (SED) modelling tool \texttt{Prospector}, we investigate the impact of key model assumptions on stellar mass estimates, such as the choice of star-formation history (SFH) priors (constant versus rising SFH base for the non-parametric prior), the dust attenuation law, and the treatment of emission line fluxes. Our analysis yields revised stellar masses of $\log(M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) \approx 10.36^{+0.47}_{-0.32}, 10.95^{+0.11}_{-0.10}$ and $10.31^{+0.24}_{-0.19}$ for S1, S2, and S3, respectively. We find that adopting a rising SFH base prior results in lower inferred stellar masses compared to a constant SFH base prior. We identify a significant degeneracy between the dust attenuation curve slope, the amount of dust attenuation, and stellar mass. Our results highlight various systematics in SED modelling due to SFH priors and dust attenuation that can influence stellar mass estimates of heavily dust obscured sources. Nevertheless, even with these revised stellar mass estimates, two of the three galaxies remain among the most massive and actively star-forming systems at their respective redshifts, implying high star-formation efficiencies.

 - **Abstract**
 Relativistic jets launched in binary neutron star (BNS) mergers are widely accepted as the engines powering most of the population of short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Understanding their structure and dynamics-particularly during and after breakout from the merger ejecta-is crucial for interpreting GRB afterglows, especially for off-axis observers. Traditional models often assume simple angular or radial jet profiles, potentially missing key features emerging for jets piercing through realistic environments. This work aims to investigate the formation and evolution of the jet structure as it propagates through a non-homogeneous, anisotropic BNS merger environment. We focus on how the interaction with the ambient medium shapes the jet's angular and velocity distributions and assess the impact of this realistic structure on the resulting afterglow light curves. We perform a series of 3D relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of jets launched in post-merger environments, exploring different injection conditions. Simulations are evolved to late times, approaching the ballistic regime, where further dynamical evolution becomes negligible. From the resulting outflows, we extract energy and velocity profiles and compute multi-wavelength afterglow light curves using a semi-analytic model that includes radial stratification and the full 3D jet geometry. More energetic or earlier-launched jets drill more efficiently through the ejecta, but all develop asymmetries that leave clear imprints in the off-axis afterglow light curves. All models exhibit a complex multi-shock breakout structure responsible for an early, dimmer peak in the afterglow. Despite structural differences, all simulated jets are consistent with the observational data of the multi-messenger BNS merger event GW170817.

 - **Abstract**
 Radio mini-halos are perplexing features, typically hosted by X-ray cool-core galaxy clusters. Understanding the connection between thermal X-ray and non-thermal radio emission is key to uncovering their origin. Here, we present a multiwavelength study of the cool-core cluster RXCJ1558.3-1410 using archival Chandra X-ray and wideband uGMRT radio data (Bands 3, 4 and 5). Our improved analysis confirms a previously known X-ray cavity at $\sim$36 kpc south-east of the cluster centre and we report a new cavity at $\sim$42 kpc to the north-west. These cavities suggest that the AGN provides mechanical power of $\sim$$6.0 \times 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$, sufficient to offset radiative cooling in the ICM. We also detect a sharp surface brightness edge at $\sim$72 kpc south-east of the centre, characterised by a temperature jump and pressure continuity, consistent with a cold front, likely caused by gas sloshing from a minor merger. Our uGMRT images reveals an interesting diffuse emission surrounding the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG), with its edge spatially coinciding with the sloshing cold front and roughly with the cooling radius. Furthermore, a low star formation rate and uniform metal abundance up to the sloshing edge are consistent with the earlier findings of suppression of star formation and metallicity homogenisation by mixing core gas through sloshing. Finally, the spatial correlation between the mini-halo and the observed X-ray features indicates that ICM sloshing, rather than AGN feedback, plays a dominant role in powering the proposed radio mini-halo emission.

 - **Abstract**
 To reproduce observed galaxy properties, cosmological simulations require that massive galaxies experience feedback from active galactic nuclei, which regulates star formation within those galaxies. However, the energetics and timescales of these feedback processes are poorly constrained. We combine optical, infrared, sub-millimeter and radio observations of the active galaxy VV 340a, hosting a low-power jet launched from a supermassive black hole at its center. We find that the jet undergoes precession, with a period of (8.2 $\pm~$5.5) $\times~$10$^5$ years, and drives an outflow of gas at a rate of 19.4 $\pm~$7.9 solar masses per year. The jet shocks the gas, producing highly ionized plasma extending several kiloparsecs from the nucleus. The outflow ejects sufficient gas from the galaxy to influence its star formation rate.
#### The drastic impact of Eddington-limit induced mass ejections on massive star populations

 - **Abstract**
 Massive stars are the key engines of the Universe. However, their evolution and thus their ionizing feedback are still not fully understood. One of the largest gaps in current stellar evolution calculations is the lack of a model for the mass ejections that occur when the stars reach the Eddington limit, such as during an Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) phase. We aim to remedy this situation by providing a physically motivated and empirically calibrated method applicable in any 1D stellar evolution code to approximate the effect of such mass loss on stellar evolution. We employ the 1D stellar evolution code MESA, in which we implement a new mass-loss prescription that is acting when stellar models inflate too much when reaching the Eddington limit. Synthetic massive-star stellar populations using calculated grids of single-star models with this mass loss prescription are compared with the observed populations in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. In combination with already computed grids of binary evolution models, we investigate the impact of binarity on our predictions. Our single-star models reproduce key features of the observed stellar populations, namely (i) the absence of stars located beyond the Humphreys-Davidson limit, (ii) an upper limit of RSG luminosities, (iii) the faintest observed single WR stars, (iv) the absolute number of O-stars, WRs, and RSGs, (v) WO stars in low metallicity environments, and (vi) the positions of LBV stars in the HRD. Our binary population explains at the same time the 70% binary fraction of O-stars and the 40% binary fraction of WR stars. However, our synthetic population also has caveats, such as an overproduction of bright H-free WN stars. Our results show that the effect of Eddington-limit induced mass ejections on the structure and evolution of massive stars can remove tension between predicted and observed massive star populations.
