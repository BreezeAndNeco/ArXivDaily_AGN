 - **Abstract**
 Population III (Pop.$~$III) stars are expected to be massive and to undergo minimal mass loss due to their lack of metals, making them ideal progenitors of black holes and neutron stars. Here, we investigate the formation and properties of binary neutron star (BNS) and black hole-neutron star (BHNS) mergers originating from Pop.$~$III stars, and compare them to their metal-enriched Population II (Pop.$~$II) counterparts, focusing on their merger rate densities (MRDs), primary masses and delay times. We find that, despite the high merger efficiency of Pop.$~$III BNSs and BHNSs, their low star formation rate results in a MRD at least one order of magnitude lower than that of Pop.$~$II stars. The MRD of Pop.$~$III BNSs peaks at redshift $z\sim15$, attaining a value $\mathcal{R}_{\rm BNS}(z\sim15) \sim 15\,\rm Gpc^{-3}\,yr^{-1}$, while the MRD of Pop.$~$III BHNSs is maximum at $z\sim13$, reaching a value $\mathcal{R}_{\rm BHNS}(z\sim13) \sim 2\,\rm Gpc^{-3}\,yr^{-1}$. Finally, we observe that the black hole masses of Pop.$~$III BHNS mergers have a nearly flat distribution with a peak at $\sim 20\,\rm M_{\odot}$ and extending up to $\sim 50\,\rm M_{\odot}$. Black holes in Pop.$~$II BHNS mergers show instead a peak at $\lesssim 15\,\rm M_{\odot}$. We consider these predictions in light of recent gravitational-wave observations in the local Universe, finding that a Pop.$~$III origin is preferred relative to Pop.$~$II for some events.

 - **Abstract**
 (abridged) In this second paper in our publication series, we present the open-source Zingularity framework for parameter inference with deep Bayesian artificial neural networks. We carried out out supervised learning with synthetic millimeter very long baseline interferometry observations of the EHT. Our ground-truth models are based on GRMHD simulations of Sgr A* and M87* on horizon scales. We investigated how well Zingularity neural networks are able to infer key model parameters from EHT observations, such as the black hole spin and the magnetic state of the accretion disk, when uncertainties in the data are accurately taken into account. Zingularity makes use of the TensorFlow Probability library and is able to handle large amounts of data with a combination of the efficient TFRecord data format plus the Horovod framework. Our approach is the first analysis of EHT data with Bayesian neural networks, where an unprecedented training data size, under consideration of a closely modeled EHT signal path, and the full information content of the observational data are used. Zingularity infers parameters based on salient features in the data and is containerized. Through parameter surveys and dedicated validation tests, we identified neural network architectures, that are robust against internal stochastic processes and unaffected by noise in the observational and model data. We give examples of how different data properties affect the network training. We show how the Bayesian nature of our networks gives trustworthy uncertainties and uncovers failure modes for uncharacterizable data. It is easy to achieve low validation errors during training on synthetic data with neural networks, particularly when the forward modeling is too simplified. Through careful studies, we demonstrate that our trained networks can generalize well so that reliable results can be obtained from observational data.

 - **Abstract**
 Modeling energy-dependent X-ray pulse profiles from rotation-powered millisecond pulsars observed with NICER has emerged as a promising avenue for measuring neutron star radii and probing the equation of state of cold, ultra-dense matter. However, pulse profile models have often required an unwieldy number of parameters to account for complex surface emission geometries, introducing the risk of overfitting and degeneracies. To explore the number of model parameters that can be inferred uniquely, we perform a quantitative assessment of the information content in X-ray pulse profiles by applying Fourier methods. We determine the number of independent observables that can be reliably extracted from the pulse shapes, as well as from complementary X-ray spectral data obtained with XMM-Newton, for key NICER targets. Our analysis provides a framework for evaluating the match between model complexity and data constraints. It also demonstrates the importance of incorporating in the model the pulsed components of the magnetospheric non-thermal emission, which often contributes significantly to the observed spectra. Our results highlight limitations in previous inferences of neutron-star radii from NICER observations, which have incorporated model complexity not supported by the data.
#### Predicting the resolved CO emission of $z=1-3$ star-forming galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 (Abridged) Resolved observations of the CO emission from $z=1-3$ star-forming galaxies are becoming increasingly common, with new high-resolution surveys on the horizon. We aim to inform the interpretation of this resolved CO emission by creating synthetic observations and testing to what extent routinely observed CO transitions can be used to trace H$_2$ across galaxy disks. To this end, we extract $z=1-3$ massive star-forming galaxies (on and above the main sequence) from the SIMBA cosmological simulation and predict their spatially resolved CO(1$-$0)-to-CO(5$-$4) emission using the $\texttt{SLICK}$ pipeline, which combines sub-resolution modeling of the cloud population with the DESPOTIC spectral line calculation code. We find that the CO(1$-$0)-to-H$_2$ ratio ($\alpha_{\rm CO}$) varies significantly within these galaxy disks$-$from values of $\sim1-5$ $\mathrm{M_\odot}$ (K km s$^{-1}$ pc$^2$)$^{-1}$ in the central 1-3 kpc of the most massive galaxies to $>100$ $\mathrm{M_\odot}$ (K km s$^{-1}$ pc$^2$)$^{-1}$ at $\sim$ 15 kpc. Thus, the use of a single $\alpha_{\rm CO}$ to derive the H$_2$ surface density leads to severe underestimates of the H$_2$ contribution in its outskirts. As expected, higher-$J$ CO transitions trace molecular gas in the centers at higher densities, whereas CO(1$-$0) better traces the more diffuse, extended molecular gas. We see significant variations in the CO excitation, with CO(3$-$2)/CO(1$-$0) line luminosity ratios of the most massive galaxies at $z\sim2$ declining from $\sim$ 0.9 in the galaxy centers to $\sim$ 0.1 in the outskirts. On average, line ratios increase substantially toward higher redshifts and lower galaxy stellar masses. We predict that tracing molecular gas with CO beyond 3-5 kpc of cosmic noon galaxies will be challenging with current facilities due to the drastic increase in $\alpha_{\rm CO}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Supermassive black hole feedback is the currently favoured mechanism to regulate the star formation rate of galaxies and prevent the formation of ultra-massive galaxies ($M_\star>10^{12}M_\odot$). However, the mechanism through which the outflowing energy is transferred to the surrounding medium strongly varies from one galaxy evolution model to another, such that a unified model for AGN feedback does not currently exist. The hot atmospheres of galaxy groups are highly sensitive laboratories of the feedback process, as the injected black hole energy is comparable to the binding energy of halo gas particles. Here we report multi-wavelength observations of the fossil galaxy group SDSSTG 4436. The hot atmosphere of this system exhibits a highly relaxed morphology centred on the giant elliptical galaxy NGC~3298. The X-ray emission from the system features a compact core ($<$10 kpc) and a steep increase in the entropy and cooling time of the gas, with the cooling time reaching the age of the Universe $\sim15$ kpc from the centre of the galaxy. The observed entropy profile implies a total injected energy of $\sim1.5\times10^{61}$ ergs, which given the high level of relaxation could not have been injected by a recent merging event. Star formation in the central galaxy NGC~3298 is strongly quenched and its stellar population is very old ($\sim$10.6 Gyr). The currently detected radio jets have low power and are confined within the central compact core. All the available evidence implies that this system was affected by giant AGN outbursts which excessively heated the neighbouring gas and prevented the formation of a self-regulated feedback cycle. Our findings imply that AGN outbursts can be energetic enough to unbind gas particles and lead to the disruption of cool cores.

 - **Abstract**
 Rotational variables are stars that vary in brightness due to star spots modulated by rotation. They are probes of stellar magnetism, binarity, and evolution. Phillips et al. (2023) explored distinct populations of ~50,000 high-amplitude rotational variables from the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN), examining correlations between stellar rotation, binarity, and activity. Here, we carry out a similar analysis of ~50,000 much lower amplitude Kepler rotational variables. The Kepler population is dominated by slowly rotating, single, main sequence stars, with a striking absence of the rapidly rotating main sequence group in the ASAS-SN sample. The binary fractions of the Kepler rotators are significantly lower than for the ASAS-SN systems and they are significantly less spotted, as expected from their lower amplitudes. The scope of these statistical surveys will dramatically increase in the near future.

 - **Abstract**
 Mid-infrared (mid-IR) observations of Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) have historically been a valuable tool for understanding their physical properties. However, the current state of mid-IR instruments on ground-based telescopes places several limitations on performing thermal characterization of NEOs. The complexity of maintaining these instruments in operational conditions on telescopes has led to their decommissioning. Here, we present the first science commissioning observations out to 12.5 microns from the upgraded Mid-Infrared Spectrograph and Imager (MIRSI) at the NASA-IRTF. We obtained 42 observations of 31 NEOs and derived their diameters and albedos. Since MIRSI allows simultaneous optical observations with its MIRSI Optical Camera (MOC), we were able to determine the absolute magnitude for most of the targets at the time of the thermal acquisition. We present ejecta characterization for the Didymos system from observations made 11 hours and 9 days after the Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) impact. We present albedo and size measurements for (98943) Torifune 2001 CC21, the fly-by target of the Japanese Extended Hayabusa2 Mission. We also highlight several applications that the MIRSI system will provide for future airless body characterization, such as constraining thermal inertia from simultaneous optical and thermal lightcurves. This work also demonstrates the importance of having MIRSI as an available rapid-response instrument for planetary defense purposes.

 - **Abstract**
 This work proposes a multiple machine learning method (MMLM) aiming to improve the accuracy and robustness in the analysis of star clusters. The MMLM performance is evaluated by applying it to the reanalysis of the old binary cluster candidate - NGC 1605a and NGC 1605b - found by Camargo (2021) (hereafter C21). The binary cluster candidate is analyzed by employing a set of well established machine learning algorithms applied to the Gaia-EDR3 data. Membership probabilities and open clusters (OCs) parameters are determined by using the clustering algorithms pyUPMASK, ASteCA, Kmeans, GMM, and HDBSCAN. In addition, a KNN smoothing algorithm is implemented to enhances the visualization of features like overdensities in the 5D space and intrinsic stellar sequences on the color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs). The method validates the clusters' parameters previously derived, however, suggests that their probable members-stars are distributed over a wider overlapping area. Finally, a combination of the elbow method, t-SNE, kmeans, and GMM algorithms group the normalized data into 6 clusters, following C21. In short, these results confirm NGC1605a and NGC1605b as genuine OCs and reinforce the previous suggestion that they form an old binary cluster in an advanced stage of merging after a tidal capture during a close encounter. Thus, MMLM has proven to be a powerful tool that helps to obtain more accurate and reliable clusters parameters and its application in future studies may contribute to a better characterization of the Galaxy's star cluster system.

 - **Abstract**
 To explore the spatial variations of the regular (mean) magnetic field of the Andromeda galaxy (M31), we use Fourier analysis in azimuthal angle along four rings in the galaxy's plane. Earlier analyses indicated that the axisymmetric magnetic field (azimuthal Fourier mode $m=0$) is sufficient to fit the observed polarization angles in a wide range of galactocentric distances. We apply a Bayesian inference approach to new, more sensitive radio continuum data at $\lambda \lambda3.59$, $6.18$, and $11.33$ cm and the earlier data at $\lambda 20.46$ cm to reveal sub-dominant contributions from the modes $m=1$, 2, and 3 along with a dominant axisymmetric mode. Magnetic lines of the axisymmetric mode are close to trailing logarithmic spirals which are significantly more open than the spiral arms detectable in the interstellar dust and neutral hydrogen. The form of the $m=0$ mode is consistent with galactic dynamo theory. Both the amplitudes and the pitch angles of the higher azimuthal modes ($m>1$) vary irregularly with $r$ reflecting local variations in the magnetic field structure. The maximum strength of the mean magnetic field of $1.8\text{--}2.7\mu$G (for the axisymmetric part of the field) occurs at $10\text{--}14$ kpc but we find that its strength varies strongly along the azimuth; this variation gives rise to the $m=1$ mode. We suggest a procedure of Bayesian inference which is independent of the specific nature of the depolarization and applies when the magneto-ionic layer observable in polarized emission is not symmetric along the line of sight because emission from its far side is completely depolarized.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar flares are intense bursts of electromagnetic radiation, which occur due to a rapid destabilization and reconnection of the magnetic field. While pre-flare signatures and trends have been investigated from magnetic observations prior to flares for decades, analysis which characterizes the variability of the magnetic field in the hours prior to flare onset has not been included in the literature. Here, the 3D magnetic field is modeled using a Non-Linear Force Free Field extrapolation for 6 hours before and 1 hour after 18 on-disk solar flares and flare quiet windows for each active region. Parameters are calculated directly from the magnetic field from two field isolation methods: the "Active Region Field", which isolates field lines where the photospheric field magnitude is $\geq$ 200 Gauss, and the "High Current Region", which isolates field lines in the 3D field where the current, non-potential field, twist, and shear exceed pre-defined thresholds. For this small pool of clean events, there is a significant increase in variation starting 2-4 hours before flare onset for the current, twist, shear, and free energy, and the variation continues to increase through the flare start time. The current, twist, shear, and free energy are also significantly stronger through the lower corona, and their separation from flare quiet height curves scales with flare strength. Methods are proposed to combine variation of the magnetic fields with variation of other data products prior to flare onset, suggesting a new potential flare prediction capability.

 - **Abstract**
 Primordial black holes (PBHs) arise from the collapse of density perturbations in the early universe and serve as a dark matter (DM) candidate and a probe of fundamental physics. There remains an unconstrained ``asteroid-mass'' window where PBHs of masses $10^{17} {\rm g} \lesssim M \lesssim 10^{23} {\rm g}$ could comprise up to $100\%$ of the dark matter. Current $e^{\pm}$ Hawking radiation constraints on the DM fraction of PBHs are set by comparing observed spatial- and time-integrated cosmic ray flux measurements with predicted Hawking emission fluxes from the galactic DM halo. These constraints depend on cosmic ray production and propagation models, the galactic DM density distribution, and the PBH mass function. We propose to mitigate these model dependencies by developing a new local, time-dependent Hawking radiation signature to detect low-mass PBHs transiting through the inner Solar System. We calculate transit rates for PBHs that form with initial masses $M \lesssim 5\times10^{17}\text{g}$. We then simulate time-dependent positron signals from individual PBH flybys as measured by the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) experiment in low-Earth orbit. We find that AMS is sensitive to PBHs with masses $M\lesssim 2\times10^{14} \, {\rm g}$ due to its lower energy threshold of $500 \, {\rm MeV}$. We demonstrate that a dataset of daily positron fluxes over the energy range $5-500 \, {\rm MeV}$, with similar levels of precision to the existing AMS data, would enable detection of PBHs drawn from present-day distributions that peak within the asteroid-mass window. Our simulations yield ${\cal O} (1)$ detectable PBH transits per year across wide regions of parameter space, which may be used to constrain PBH mass functions. This technique could be extended to detect $\gamma$-ray and X-ray Hawking emission to probe further into the asteroid-mass window.

 - **Abstract**
 Quiet Sun magnetism plays an important role in the global energy balance of the solar atmosphere. The study of the magnetism of the quiet Sun has been a major effort in the last decades, and, as a result, very important advances in our knowledge have been achieved. The recent commissioning of the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope, the largest ground-based solar telescope in the world today, provides us with data of high spectropolarimetric quality and high spatial resolution. The combination of data acquired with the ViSP instrument on the DKIST telescope around 630.1 nm and multiline inversions enables the achievement of exceptionally high spatial resolution in the solar atmosphere, both at the surface and in depth. In this paper we determine the log(gf) values of the spectral lines around 630.1 nm observed with the ViSP instrument and search for the best multi-inversion strategy, by means of MHD simulations, to analyze quiet Sun magnetism data within such spectral range. We present results of quiet Sun magnetism with special emphasis on its evolution with optical depth. In the internetwork, we find the decrease with height of the averaged magnetic field strength and the zone from which the fields become more horizontal. Additionally, we explore the depth-dependent evolution of the networks canopy, uncovering intriguing insights into its thermodynamic and magnetic properties. Notably, we detect a temperature enhancement in very localized areas of the vicinity of the network and distinguish mass motions with opposing velocities inside the flux tubes.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of COSMOS2020-635829 as a likely jellyfish galaxy undergoing to ram pressure stripping in a (proto)cluster at $z > 1$. High-resolution imaging from the James Webb Space Telescope reveals a symmetric stellar disk coupled to a unilateral tail of star-forming knots to the south. We show that these extra-planar continuum sources are embedded within an ionized gas tail that is kinematically connected to the disk of COSMOS2020-635829. Likely representing the highest-redshift discovery of a ram pressure stripped ionized gas tail. The tail sources are characterized by extremely young stellar populations ($\lesssim 100\,\mathrm{Myr}$), have stellar masses of ${\sim}10^8\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$, and star formation rates of $0.1\text{--}1\,\mathrm{M_\odot\,yr^{-1}}$. This work reinforces the notion that ram pressure stripping can perturb group and cluster galaxies at $z > 1$ and likely contributes to environmental quenching even near Cosmic Noon.

 - **Abstract**
 We carried out polarimetric observations of the bright-rimmed cloud IC 1396E/SFO 38 with SCUBA-2/POL-2 to study the effect of ultraviolet (UV) light on its structure and magnetic field. This bright-rimmed cloud appears optically to be one single cloud illuminated by the UV light from the excited star of IC 1396, however our Stokes I image and 13CO(J=3-2) archival data suggest that this cloud is not a simple, single structure, but appears to be composed of two parts on first glance; a head part with wings and a tail, and a north-west extension this http URL molecular clouds are generally filamentary and it seems likely that the initial structures of bright-rimmed clouds are expected to be also generally elongated, we examined the possibility that the structure was created from a single elongated cloud by the UV impact. We compared the cloud structure with a simulation study that investigated the evolution of prolate clouds exposed to the UV radiation from various directions and found that this apparent two-part structure could be reproduced in a situation where a single filamentary cloud is obliquely illuminated by UV light. The magnetic field directions of the cloud are different from the ambient field direction, demonstrating the field reconfiguration due to the UV impact. The distortion or pinch of the magnetic field is seen toward the cloud head, where an intermediate-mass star cluster is located, suggesting gravitational contraction. We roughly estimated the magnetic strength and stability in three parts of the cloud and found that the cloud head is most likely to be supercritical.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the thermal and spectral properties of irradiated circumbinary disks (CBDs) around binary black holes (BBHs), using analytic, hydrogen-based opacity models that capture key dependencies on temperature, density, and ionization. We solve the vertically hydrostatic energy balance equations with Rosseland mean opacities from free-free absorption, bound-free absorption, and electron scattering processes, combined with ionization fractions derived by the Saha equation. Four opacity models are considered, including a reference model with no physical opacity, constructed by Lee et al. (2024), and three physically motivated alternatives. The midplane temperature profiles show significant variation across models, while the surface temperature remains largely unchanged in regions dominated by viscous heating. Opacity effects become pronounced in the outer disk, where irradiation reprocessing shapes the IR-optical continuum. Inclusion of bound-free opacity introduces a noticeable flattening and a mid-frequency peak in the spectral energy distribution. We also compute spectra of a triple disk system including the CBD and two accreting minidisks. The high-frequency peak arises from the hot minidisks, while the low-frequency excess originates from irradiated outer CBD layers. By comparing model spectra with detection limits of Subaru, JWST, and Swift, we find that systems within $\sim10$ Mpc may show detectable IR excess from the CBD. Our results highlight the need for accurate opacity modeling to interpret electromagnetic signatures of black hole mergers and support future integration of opacity tables with metallicity.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational waves (GWs) accompanied by electromagnetic (EM) counterparts provide a novel methodology to measure the Hubble constant ($H_0$), known as bright sirens. However, the rarity of such multi-messenger events limits the precision of the $H_0$ constraint. Recently, the newly-discovered quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) show intriguing evidence of a stellar-mass companion captured by a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in an extreme mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI), which is the most promising sources of the space-based GW detectors, such as Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Here we study the secular orbital evolution of QPE systems under different theoretical frameworks, and assess their GWs detectability by LISA. We find that LISA can detect the EMRI signals of two or three known QPE systems with a four-year observation. One EMRI event can measure the $H_0$ with an uncertainty of $3\%-8\%$ at a 68.3 percent confidence level, while a few events will reduce it below $2\%$. The EMRI events surpass current bright siren limitations and offer an independent pathway to resolve the Hubble constant tension.

 - **Abstract**
 Purpose: We aim to investigate an accretion disk (AD) temperature profile of a doubly lensed quasar SBS 1520+530. Temperature profiles of accretion disks are known to be diagnostic of many of the physical properties of AGNs and quasars. Methods: Our approach involves application of the photometric reverberation mapping to the light curves of SBS 1520+530 obtained in the Johnson-Cousins V and R filters. The RM method implies that the time shift between the light curves taken in different spectral ranges determines the light travel time between the AD zones with different physical conditions. In determining the time shifts, we applied a method based on some useful properties of the orthogonal polynomials. Results: The variations in filter R lag those in filter V , with 1.25$\pm$ 0.63 days for the inter-band time shift averaged between the two image components and over the three seasons. The obtained time lag noticeably exceeds the value following for SBS 1520+530 from the classical model of optically thick geometrically thin AD. We considered two possible ways to resolve the discrepancy between the theory and observations. The first assumes an AD temperature profile flatter than the classical one. The second way is to consider an extended optically thick scattering envelope originated due to matter outflow from an AD interior. Conclusion: Both explanations may be consequences of the super-Eddington accretion in SBS 1520+530. Using bolometric luminosity estimates available for SBS 1520+530 from the literature, we obtained a value of $\approx$ 3.4 for the Eddington ratio, which indeed indicates a moderately super-Eddington accretion regime.

 - **Abstract**
 The Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) feature, imprinted in the transverse and radial clustering of dark matter tracers, enables the simultaneous measurement of the angular diameter distance $D_A(z)$ and the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ at a given redshift. Further, measuring the redshift space anisotropy (RSD) allows us to measure the combination $f_8\equiv f\sigma_8(z)$. Motivated by this, we simultaneously study the dynamics of background evolution and structure formation in an abstract phase space of dynamical quantities $x=H_0 D_A/c$, $p = dx/dz$, and $f_8$. We adopt a semi-cosmographic approach, whereby we do not pre-assume any specific dark energy model to integrate the dynamical system. The Luminosity distance is expanded as a Padé rational approximation in the variable $(1+z)^{1/2}$. The dynamical system is solved by using a semi-cosmographic equation of state, which incorporates the dark matter parameters along with the parameters of the Padé expansion. The semi-cosmographic $D_A(z), H(z)$ and $f\sigma_8(z)$, thus obtained, are fitted with BAO and RSD data from the SDSS IV. The reconstructed phase trajectories in the $3D$ $(x,p,f_8)$ space are used to reconstruct some diagnostics of background cosmology and structure formation. At low redshifts, a discernible departure from the $\Lambda$CDM model is observed. The geometry of the phase trajectories in the projected spaces allows us to identify three key redshifts where future observations may be directed for a better understanding of cosmic tensions and anomalies.

 - **Abstract**
 Studying the diffuse Galactic synchrotron emission (hereafter, DGSE) at arc-minute angular scale is important to remove the foregrounds for the cosmological 21-cm observations. Statistical measurements of the large-scale DGSE can also be used to constrain the magnetic field and the cosmic ray electron density of our Galaxy's interstellar medium (ISM). Here, we have used the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) drift scan observations at $154.2 \, {\rm MHz}$ to measure the angular power spectrum $({\cal C}_{\ell})$ of the DGSE of a region of the sky from right ascension (RA) $349^{\circ}$ to $70.3^{\circ}$ at the fixed declination $-26.7^{\circ}$. In this RA range, we have chosen 24 pointing centers (PCs), for which we have removed all the bright point sources above $\sim430 \, {\rm mJy}\,(3\sigma)$, and applied the Tapered Gridded Estimator (TGE) on residual data to estimate the ${\cal C}_{\ell}$. We use the angular multipole range $65 \le \ell \le 650$ to fit the data with a model, ${\cal C}^M_{\ell}=A\times \left(\frac{1000}{\ell}\right)^{\beta}+C$, where we interpret the model as the combination of a power law $(\propto \ell^{-\beta})$ nature of the DGSE and a constant part due to the Poisson fluctuations of the residual point sources. We are able to fit the model ${\cal C}^M_{\ell}$ for six PCs centered at $\alpha=352.5^{\circ}, 353^{\circ}, 357^{\circ}, 4.5^{\circ}, 4^{\circ}$ and $1^{\circ}$. We run the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) ensemble sampler to get the best-fit values of the parameters $A, \beta$ and $C$ for these PCs. We see that the values of $A$ vary in the range $155$ to $400$ mK$^{2}$, whereas the $\beta$ varies in the range $0.9$ to $1.7$. We find that the value of $\beta$ is consistent at $2-\sigma$ level with the earlier measurement of the DGSE at similar frequency and angular scales.

 - **Abstract**
 We have analyzed a sample of 2MIG isolated galaxies hosting AGNs (isolated AGNs) to assess whether their nuclear activity differs from that in a denser environment. The isolation criteria rule out interactions with other galaxies of similar size for at least $\sim$3 Gyr. We systemized the available Swift, NuSTAR, XMM-Newton, Chandra, and INTEGRAL X-ray data for isolated AGN at $z<0.05$, determining their general X-ray properties and peculiarities, spectral models, SMBH masses, and possible parameter correlations. We investigated the best spectral models of 25 isolated AGNs, including 10 recently fitted in this work. The intrinsic luminosities $\log L_{2-10,\mathrm{keV}}$ do not exceed $\sim43$. Our results indicate that the isolation of galaxies in the nearby Universe does not significantly affect nuclear activity. This is confirmed by the diversity of accretion types and the absence of any advantage of one particular basic/compound spectral model. We note an interesting case discovered for the ESO499-041 spectrum, where the data-to-model ratio shows significant changes after 6.4 keV. These deviations from the continuum may indicate the presence of a relativistic Iron line in the Chandra spectrum of ESO 499-041 compared to the Swift spectrum. Most isolated AGNs contain SMBH with $M_{\mathrm{SMBH}} \leq 10^7,M_{\odot}$. For the first time, we found a linear correlation between $L_{2-10,\mathrm{keV}}$ and $\log M_{\mathrm{SMBH}}$ that is not observed in other AGN samples. This trend may be affected by the limited sample size and requires further confirmation with larger datasets. Finally, we identified UGC10120, NG6300, and CGCG243-024 as promising candidates for Milky Way analogues.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations at low redshift have revealed that some post-starburst galaxies retain significant molecular gas reservoirs despite low ongoing star formation rates, challenging theoretical predictions for galaxy quenching. To test whether this finding holds during the peak epoch of quenching, here we present ALMA CO(2-1) observations of five spectroscopically confirmed post-starburst galaxies at z ~ 1.4 from the HeavyMetal survey. While four galaxies are undetected in CO emission, we detect M_H2 ~ 10^9.7 Msun of molecular gas in one system. The detected system is a close pair of massive (M* = 10^(11.1-11.2) Msun) post-starburst galaxies with no clear tidal features, likely caught in the early stages of a major merger. These results suggest that mergers may be a key factor in retaining molecular gas while simultaneously suppressing star formation in quenched galaxies at high redshift, possibly by driving increased turbulence that decreases star formation efficiency. Unlike previous studies at z < 1, we find no correlation between molecular gas mass and time since quenching. This may be explained by the fact that -- despite having similar UVJ colors -- all galaxies in our sample have post-burst ages older than typical gas-rich quenched systems at low redshift. Our results highlight the importance of major mergers in shaping the cold gas content of quiescent galaxies during the peak epoch of quenching.

 - **Abstract**
 The inspirals of supermaissive black hole binaries provide a convinced gravitational wave background in the nHz band, serving as the fiducial model of the recent gravitational wave signal reported by the PTA experiments. The uncertainties of the number of binaries contributing to each frequency bin introduce a foreground noise in the nHz and $\mu$Hz bands against the observation of the underlying gravitational wave backgrounds of the cosmological origin. In this work, we investigate a new method to constrain the cosmological gravitational wave strength under the astrophysical foreground. The energy density fluctuations from cosmological gravitational-wave sources can generally trigger the formation of compact subhalos of dark matter, and the upcoming Square Kilometer Array has the ability to constrain the abundance of the subhalos at the $\mathcal{O}(1)$ level. The cosmological gravitational wave energy spectra from various sources are expected to be constrained several orders of magnitude below the astrophysical foreground, providing more strict constraints on the parameter spaces of corresponding new physics models.

 - **Abstract**
 We present simulations of the supernova-driven turbulent interstellar medium (ISM) in a simulation domain of volume $(256\,{\rm pc})^3$ within which we resolve the formation of protostellar accretion disks and their stellar cores to spatial scales of $\sim 10^{-4}$ au, using the moving-mesh code {\small AREPO}. We perform simulations with no magnetic fields, ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and ambipolar diffusion, and compare the resulting first Larson cores and their associated structures, including the accretion disks, their location within the larger-scale structure and the streamers connecting these. We find that disks of sizes $10-100\,{\rm au}$ form early in the simulations without magnetic fields, while there are no disks larger than 10 au with ideal MHD. Ambipolar diffusion causes large disks to form in a subset of cases (two out of six cores), and generally reduces the strength of outflows, which are seen to play a central role. When they are able to carry away significant angular momentum, they prevent the formation of a rotationally supported disk. Magnetic fields strengths grow from $0.1 - 1$ mG in the protostellar core to more than 10 G in the first Larson core in all simulations with ideal MHD. The rotationally supported disks which form can have rotation speeds $> 1$ km s$^{-1}$ even out to further than 100 au from the centre, become gravitationally unstable and form complex spiral substructures with Toomre $Q < 1$. We conclude that the impact of magnetic fields and non-ideal MHD on the formation of protostellar disks is substantial in realistic formation scenarios from the turbulent ISM.

 - **Abstract**
 Quasi-periodic X-ray eruptions (QPEs) are a new class of repeating nuclear transient in which repeating X-ray flares are observed coming from the nuclei of generally low mass galaxies. Here we present a comprehensive summary of the radio properties of 12 bona-fide quasi-periodic eruption sources, including a mix of known tidal disruption events (TDEs) and AGN-like hosts. We include a combination of new dedicated radio observations and archival/previously published radio observations to compile a catalogue of radio observations of each source in the sample. We examine the overall radio properties of the sample and compare to the radio properties of known TDEs, given the apparent link between QPEs and TDEs. Overall we find compact, weak radio sources associated with 5/12 of the QPE sources and no signatures of strong AGN activity via a luminous radio jet. We find no radio variability or correlation between radio emission and the X-ray QPE properties, implying that the mechanism that produces the X-ray flares does not generate strong radio-emitting outflows. The compactness of the radio sources and lack of correlation between radio luminosity and SMBH mass is very unusual for AGN, but the radio spectra and luminosities are consistent with outflows produced by a recent TDE (or accretion event), in both the known TDE sources as well as the AGN-like sources in the sample.
#### Detecting fast-variation pulsations in solar hard X-ray and radio emissions

 - **Abstract**
 Quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) at sub-second periods are frequently detected in the time series of X-rays during stellar flares. However, such rapid pulsations are rarely reported in the hard X-ray (HXR) emission of the small solar flare. We explored the QPP patterns with fast-time variations in HXR and radio emissions produced in a small solar flare on 2025 January 19. By applying the Fast Fourier Transform, the fast-variation pulsations at a quasi-period of about 1 s are identified in the HXR channel of 20-80 keV, which were simultaneously measured by the Hard X-ray Imager and the Konus-Wind. The rapid pulsations with a same quasi-period were also detected in the radio emission at a lower frequency range of about 40-100 MHz. The restructured HXR images show that the QPP patterns mainly locate in footpoint areas that connect by hot plasma loops, and they appear in the flare impulsive phase. Our observations suggest that the fast-variation pulsations could be associated with nonthermal electrons that are periodically accelerated by the intermittent magnetic reconnection, and the 1-s period may be modulated by the coalescence instability between current-carrying loops and magnetic islands.

 - **Abstract**
 Within the deep gravitational potential of galaxy clusters lies the intracluster medium (ICM). At the first order, it is considered to be at hydrostatic equilibrium within the potential well. However, evidence is growing that the ICM dynamics is non-negligible, is mostly turbulent in origin, and provides a non-thermal pressure support to the equilibrium. In this work, we intend to characterise the properties of the velocity field in the ICM of a simulated replica of the Virgo cluster. We first study the 3D and projected properties of the ICM velocity field by computing its probability density functions (PDFs) and its statistical moments. We then estimate the non-thermal pressure fraction from an effective turbulent Mach number, including the velocity dispersion. We finally compute the velocity structure function (VSF) from projected maps of the sightline velocity. We first show that the components of the 3D velocity field and the projected quantities along equivalent sightlines are anisotropic and affected by the accretion of gas from filaments. Then, we compare the mean statistical moments of the 3D velocity field to the mean properties of a hundred random projections. We show, in particular, an almost linear relation between the standard deviation estimated from direct simulation outputs and sightline velocity dispersion projections, comparable to the line broadening of X-ray atomic lines. However, this linear relation does not hold between the direct simulation outputs and the standard deviation of the sightline velocity projections, comparable to the line shift of X-ray atomic lines. We find a non-thermal pressure fraction around $6\%$ within $R_{500}$ and $9\%$ within $R_{vir}$ from sightline velocity dispersion, which is in good agreement with direct simulation outputs. Finally, we show that the VSF might probe the Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) feedback turbulent injection scale.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, Sodini et al. (2024) presented a sample of OI damped Lyman-$\alpha$ absorption system (DLA) analogs at $z\sim6$ that contain possible chemical signatures of Population III (Pop III) stars. In this paper, we use an N-body simulation-based semi-analytic model of the first stars and galaxies to predict the impact of Pop III stars on high-redshift DLAs. These Pop III DLA predictions are the first to include a number of important physical effects such as Lyman-Werner (LW) feedback, reionization, and external metal enrichment (all of which account for three-dimensional spatial fluctuations caused by halo clustering). We predict the abundance of DLAs as a function of their carbon-to-oxygen ratios ([C/O]). We find that our fiducial model is strongly ruled out by the data as it contains too few high-[C/O] DLAs, which have metals primarily from Pop III stars. However, increasing the delay time between Pop III and metal-enriched star formation due to supernovae feedback leads to better agreement with the data. Our results suggest that DLA analogs at $z\sim6$ are a promising probe of Pop III star formation for two key reasons. First, for reasonable parameter choices there are significant numbers of DLAs with metals primarily originating from Pop III stars. Second, we find that the number of DLAs with substantial Pop III contributions depends strongly on the Pop III star formation efficiency and the delay time between Pop III and metal-enriched star formation.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper deals with the effect of errors in the B and V magnitudes, or measurements in any other color system, on the width of the main sequence in a color-magnitude (Hertzsprung-Russell) diagram. The width is defined as the dispersion in apparent (or absolute) magnitude at a fixed, measured photometric color. I find that the dispersion is larger than might be thought, a priori. A statistical analysis is presented which demonstrates that the error in the magnitude residual from a linear approximation to the main sequence is Gaussian, but with a standard deviation which is much larger, in general, than the errors in the individual B and V magnitudes. This result is confirmed by a Monte Carlo simulation of a main sequence population with specified errors in B and V magnitudes, and can be explained on the basis of simple algebraic arguments.

 - **Abstract**
 In astronomical environments, the high-temperature emission of plasma mainly depends on ion charge states, which requires accurate analysis of the ionization and recombination processes. For various phenomena involving energetic particles, the non-Maxwellian distributions of electrons exhibiting high-energy tails can significantly enhance the ionization process. Therefore, accurately computing ionization and recombination rates with non-Maxwellian electron distributions is essential for emission diagnostic analysis. In this work, we report two methods for fitting various non-Maxwellian distributions by using the Maxwellian decomposition strategy. For standard \{kappa} distributions, the calculated ionization and recombination rate coefficients show comparable accuracy to other public packages. We apply the above methods to two specific non-Maxwellian distribution scenarios: (I) accelerated electron distributions due to magnetic reconnection revealed in a combined MHD-particle simulation; (II) the high-energy truncated \{kappa} distribution predicted by the exospheric model of the solar wind. During the electron acceleration process, ionization rates of high-temperature iron ions increase significantly compared to their initial Maxwellian distribution, while the recombination rates may decrease due to the electron distribution changes in low-energy ranges. This can potentially lead to an overestimation of the plasma temperature when analyzing the Fe emission lines under the Maxwellian distribution assumption. For the truncated \{kappa} distribution in the solar wind, the ionization rates are lower than those for the standard \{kappa} distribution, while the recombination rates remain similar. This leads to an overestimation of plasma temperature when assuming a \{kappa} distribution.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an exploration of technosignature research that is possible using real-time alert brokers from surveys such as the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and the upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). Nine alert brokers currently stream up to 1 million alerts each night from ZTF, and LSST is projected to increase this volume by an order of magnitude. While these brokers are primarily designed to facilitate real-time follow-up of explosive transients such as supernovae, they offer a unique platform to discover rare forms of variability from nearby stars in real time, which is crucial for follow-up and characterization. We evaluate the capability for both spatial and temporal searches for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) methods using the currently available brokers, and present examples of technosignature searches using ZTF alert and archival data. We have deployed optical SETI techniques, such as planetary transit zone geometries and the SETI Ellipsoid. We have also developed a search for novel high-amplitude stellar dippers, and present a workflow that integrates features available directly through the brokers, as well as post-processing steps that build on the existing capabilities. Though the SETI methods that alert brokers can execute are currently limited, we provide suggestions that may enhance future technosignature and anomaly searches in the era of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory.
