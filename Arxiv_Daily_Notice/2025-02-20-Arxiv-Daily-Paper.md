 - **Abstract**
 Low-mass active galactic nuclei (AGNs) can provide important constraints on the formation and evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs), a central challenge in modern cosmology. To date only small samples of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs, $M_{BH}<10^5M_{\odot}$) and 'lesser' supermassive black holes (LSMBHs, $M_{BH}<10^6M_{\odot}$) have been identified. Our present study of NGC 3259 at D=27 Mpc with the Binospec integral field unit spectrograph complemented with Keck Echelle Spectrograph and Imager observations demonstrates the need for and the power of the spectroscopic follow-up. NGC 3259 hosts a black hole with a mass of $M_{BH}=(1.7-4.1)\times10^5M_{\odot}$, inferred from multi-epoch spectroscopic data, that accretes at 1% of the Eddington limit as suggested by the analysis of archival XMM-Newton observations. It is the second nearest low-mass AGN after the archetypal galaxy NGC 4395. The spectroscopic data reveals a variable broad $H\alpha$ profile that is likely the result of asymmetrically distributed broad-line region (BLR) clouds or BLR outflow events. X-ray observations and the absence of an optical power-law continuum suggest partial obscuration of the accretion disk and hot corona by a dust torus. We estimate that the Sloan Digital Sky Survey could only detect similar objects to D=35 Mpc. A detailed photometric analysis of NGC 3259 using HST images provides a central spheroid stellar mass estimate 25 times lower than expected from the $M_{BH}-M^*_{sph}$ relation, making this galaxy a strong outlier. This discrepancy suggests divergent growth pathways for the central black hole and spheroid, potentially influenced by the presence of a bar in the galaxy. Finally, we demonstrate that the DESI and 4MOST surveys will detect low-accretion rate IMBHs and LSMBHs and the sensitivity of future X-ray instruments (such as AXIS and Athena) will secure their classification.

 - **Abstract**
 Supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies occasionally disrupt stars or consume stellar-mass black holes that wander too close, producing observable electromagnetic or gravitational wave signals. We examine how mass segregation impacts the rates and distributions of such events. Assuming a relaxed stellar cluster, composed of stars and stellar-mass black holes, we show that the tidal disruption rate of massive stars ($m\gtrsim M_\odot$) is enhanced relative to their abundance in the stellar population. For stars up to $m\approx3M_\odot$, this enhancement is roughly $m/M_\odot$ and it is driven by segregation within the sphere of influence. Stars with masses $m\gtrsim3M_\odot$, if relaxed, are predominantly scattered by more massive stellar-mass black holes, leading to a constant enhancement factor of $\approx 10$, independent of mass. This aligns with observational evidence suggesting an over-representation of massive stars in tidal disruption events. For stellar-mass black holes, we predict an enhancement factor scaling as $m_\bullet^{1/2}$ for plunges and $m_\bullet^{3/2}$ for extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs). The power of one-half in both cases reflects the shorter relaxation times of heavier black holes, allowing them to segregate into the sphere of influence from greater distances, thereby increasing their abundance. The additional power in the EMRIs' rate arises from the tendency of heavier black holes to circularize and sink inward more efficiently. Finally, we estimate the rate of main sequence star inspirals and find that it favors low-mass stars ($m\lesssim M_\odot$). This seems compatible with the observationally estimated rate of quasi-periodic eruptions.

 - **Abstract**
 We present initial results from extremely well-resolved 3D magnetohydrodynamical simulations of idealized galaxy clusters, conducted using the AthenaPK code on the Frontier exascale supercomputer. These simulations explore the self-regulation of galaxy groups and cool-core clusters by cold gas-triggered active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback incorporating magnetized kinetic jets. Our simulation campaign includes simulations of galaxy groups and clusters with a range of masses and intragroup and intracluster medium properties. In this paper we present results that focus on a Perseus-like cluster. We find that the simulated clusters are self-regulating, with the cluster cores staying at a roughly constant thermodynamic state and AGN jet power staying at physically reasonable values ($\simeq 10^{44}-10^{45}$~erg/s) for billions of years without a discernible duty cycle. These simulations also produce significant amounts of cold gas, with calculations having strong magnetic fields generally both promoting cold gas formation and allowing cold gas out to much larger clustercentric radii ($\simeq 100$~kpc) than simulations with weak or no fields ($\simeq 10$~kpc), and also having more filamentary cold gas morphology. We find that AGN feedback significantly increases the strength of magnetic fields at the center of the cluster. We also find that the magnetized turbulence generated by the AGN results in turbulence where the velocity power spectra are tied to AGN activity whereas the magnetic energy spectra are much less impacted after reaching a stationary state.

 - **Abstract**
 In the last decade of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) monitoring programs, the Metsähovi Radio Observatory detected multiple times seven powerful flaring narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies at 37 GHz. Several hypotheses have been proposed, but the understanding of this unique phenomenon is still far. To look at the case from a different point of view, we performed an emission line analysis of the optical spectra, with the aim of identifying similarities among the sources, that can be in turn possibly tied with the radio behavior. Our data were obtained with the Gran Telescopio Canarias. The results we obtained show that six out of seven sources have typical properties for the NLS1 class, and one of them is an intermediate Seyfert galaxy. We found on average black hole masses above the median value for the class (> 10$^7$ M$_\odot$), and a strong Fe II emission, which could be a proxy for an intense ongoing accretion activity. Although interesting, the characteristics we found are not unusual for these kind of AGN: the optical spectra of our sources do not related with their unique radio properties. Therefore, further multi-wavelength studies will be necessary to narrow the field of hypotheses for this peculiar phenomenon.
#### PHIBSS: Searching for Molecular Gas Outflows in Star-Forming Galaxies at $z =$ 0.5-2.6

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of millimeter CO observations to search and quantify signatures of molecular gas outflows. We exploit the large sample of $0.5 < z < 2.6$ galaxies observed as part of the PHIBSS1/2 surveys with the IRAM Plateau de Bure interferometer, focusing on the 154 typical massive star-forming galaxies with CO detections (mainly CO(3-2), but including also CO(2-1) and CO(6-5)) at signal-to-noise (SNR) > 1.5 and available properties (stellar mass, star formation rate, size) from ancillary data. None of the individual spectra exhibit a compelling signature of CO outflow emission even at high SNR > 7. To search for fainter outflow signatures, we carry out an analysis of stacked spectra, including the full sample, as well as subsets, split in terms of stellar mass, redshift, inclination, offset in star formation rate (SFR) from the main sequence, and AGN activity. None of the physically motivated subsamples show any outflow signature. We report a tentative detection in a subset statistically designed to maximize outflow signatures. We derive upper limits on molecular gas outflow rate and mass loading factors $\eta$ based on our results and find $\eta \leq$ 2.2-35.4, depending on the subsample. Much deeper CO data and observations of alternative tracers are needed to decisively constrain the importance of cold molecular gas component of outflows relative to other gas phases.

 - **Abstract**
 Accretion is the dominant contribution to the cosmic massive black hole density in the Universe today. Yet, modelling it in cosmological simulations is challenging due to the dynamic range involved, as well as the theoretical uncertainties of the underlying mechanisms driving accretion from galactic to black hole horizon scales. We present a simple, flexible parametrization for gas inflows onto massive black holes in order to manage this uncertainty in large-volume cosmological simulations. This is done as part of the "Learning the Universe'' collaboration, which aims to jointly infer the initial conditions and physical processes governing the evolution of the Universe using a Bayesian forward-modelling approach. To allow such a forward-modelling, we update the prescription for accretion with a two-parameter free-fall based inflow estimate that allows for a radius-dependent inflow rate and add a simple model for unresolved accretion disks. We use uniform resolution cosmological hydrodynamical simulations and the IllustrisTNG framework to study the massive black hole population and its dependence on the introduced model parameters. Once the parameters of the accretion formula are chosen to result in a roughly similar redshift zero black hole mass density, the differences caused by the details in the accretion formula are moderate in the supermassive black hole regime, indicating that it is difficult to distinguish between accretion mechanisms based on luminous active galactic nuclei powered by supermassive black holes. Applying the same models to intermediate mass black holes at high redshift, however, reveals significantly different accretion rates in high redshift, moderate luminosity active galactic nuclei and different frequencies and mass distributions of intermediate mass black hole mergers for the same black hole formation model.
#### Applying a star formation model calibrated on high-resolution interstellar medium simulations to cosmological simulations of galaxy formation

 - **Abstract**
 Modern high-resolution simulations of the interstellar medium (ISM) have shown that key factors in governing star formation are the competing influences of radiative dissipation, pressure support driven by stellar feedback, and the relentless pull of gravity. Cosmological simulations of galaxy formation, such as IllustrisTNG or ASTRID, are however not able to resolve this physics in detail and therefore need to rely on approximate treatments. These have often taken the form of empirical subgrid models of the ISM expressed in terms of an effective equation of state (EOS) that relates the mean ISM pressure to the mean gas density. Here we seek to improve these heuristic models by directly fitting their key ingredients to results of the high-resolution TIGRESS simulations, which have shown that the dynamical equilibrium of the ISM can be understood in terms of a pressure-regulated, feedback modulated (PRFM) model for star formation. Here we explore a simple subgrid model that draws on the PRFM concept but uses only local quantities. It accurately reproduces PRFM for pure gas disks, while it predicts slightly less star formation than PRFM in the presence of an additional thin stellar disk. We compare the properties of this model with the older Springel and Hernquist and TNG prescriptions, and apply all three to isolated simulations of disk galaxies as well as to a set of high-resolution zoom-in simulations carried out with a novel 'multi-zoom' technique that we introduce in this study. The softer EOS implied by TIGRESS produces substantially thinner disk galaxies, which has important ramifications for disk stability and galaxy morphology. The total stellar mass of galaxies is however hardly modified at low redshift, reflecting the dominating influence of large-scale gaseous inflows and outflows to galaxies, which are not sensitive to the EOS itself

 - **Abstract**
 The interaction between planets and their host stars is governed by the forces of gravity, radiation, and magnetic fields. For planets orbiting their stars at distances of approximately 10 stellar radii or less, these effects are significantly intensified. Such interactions can be investigated through a combination of photometric, spectroscopic, and spectropolarimetric studies spanning wavelengths from X-rays to radio frequencies. When a hot planet resides within the star's sub-Alfvénic radius, magnetic star-planet interactions (SPI) become possible, often observable as stellar activity enhancements influenced by the planet's orbital motion rather than stellar rotation alone. Such interactions offer a unique perspective on the atmospheric erosion and magnetospheric characteristics of close-in this http URL behavior and impacts of these magnetic interactions are highly sensitive to the magnetic fields of both the planet and its host star. This interplay can influence the magnetic activity of both bodies and has implications for the planet's irradiation levels, orbital migration, and the star's rotational dynamics. By employing phase-resolved observational methods on an expanding sample of hot Jupiter (HJ) systems, researchers can now extend these studies to other compact star-planet systems, including smaller planets in the habitable zones of M dwarfs. Efforts to comprehend magnetic SPI have led to extensive advancements in theoretical research and computational modeling. These efforts include investigations into the space weather environments of close-in giant exoplanets. Utilizing hydrodynamical (HD) and magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations, researchers aim to provide both qualitative and quantitative descriptions of SPI. In this chapter, we first review notable SPI detections before summarizing the current understanding of the underlying physical mechanisms driving SPI.

 - **Abstract**
 For the first time, we have determined the spatial distribution of magnetic waveguides and resonant cavities at different heights in the sunspot atmosphere. We applied a decomposition of time cubes of EUV/UV sunspot images obtained in the SDO/AIA temperature channels into narrowband components in the form of wave sources. The methods of pixelized wavelet filtering and oscillation mode decomposition were used. For all studied sunspots the presence of selected bands in the spectra was shown. Each band corresponds to oscillations forming spatial waveguides in the volume of the sunspot atmosphere. The formation of waveguide bundles in the height from photospheric to coronal levels is shown. The regions of the waveguides with maximum oscillation power, where resonant cavities are formed, are identified. Their detection is an experimental proof of the theory of resonant layers, previously proposed to explain the presence of significant harmonics in the oscillation spectrum. The different shapes of the cavities reflect the structure of the magnetic tubes along which the waves propagate. The distribution of sources in the height layers indicates the influence of the wave cutoff frequency caused by the inclinations of the magnetic field lines. We discuss the possibility of upward wave transport due to periodic amplification of the oscillation power in the detected cavities.

 - **Abstract**
 Venus' atmosphere -- specifically its clouds buoyed up 40 to 60 km above the surface -- has long been suspected to encompass a biosphere where Earth-like living organisms could grow and flourish. This idea has been recently rekindled by the observation (signal-to-noise ratio of about 15$\sigma$) of a phosphine (PH$_3$) absorption-line profile against the thermal background from deeper, hotter layers of the atmosphere. There is a chance that this observation could be a sign of life, because the PH$_3$ gas observed on Earth originates mostly in decaying organic material. Furthermore, it has been shown that there is no other natural process on Venus that could otherwise produce the observed PH$_3$ absorption line. On the other hand, cosmic rays and the particle cascades they produce in the Earth's atmosphere are hazardous to living organisms, because the ionizing radiation produced in air showers can blow apart chemical molecules and disrupt biochemical processes, causing cells to die or undergo dangerous mutations. Compared to Earth, the hypothesized biosphere of Venus could be exposed to substantially more ionizing radiation. This is because Venus has no protective intrinsic magnetic field, orbits closer to the Sun, and the entire eventual habitable region lies in the clouds high in the atmosphere. Thereby, if the clouds were sterilized there would be no reservoir of deeper life that can recolonize afterwards. In this communication we study the effects of particle cascades in the venusian atmosphere using the AIRES simulation package properly configured. We show that the effects of cosmic radiation in the habitable zone would be comparable to those on the Earth's surface and so would not have any hazardous effect on possible venusian microorganisms.
#### CASCO: Cosmological and AStrophysical parameters from Cosmological simulations and Observations III. The physics behind the emergence of the golden mass scale

 - **Abstract**
 Different studies have suggested the emergence of the so-called golden mass, corresponding to a virial mass of $\sim 10^{12} \, M_{\rm \odot}$ and a stellar mass of $\sim 5 \times 10^{10} \, M_{\rm \odot}$. This mass scale marks a maximum in star formation efficiency, where galaxies are minimally affected by processes like SN and AGN feedback. We use \textsc{camels} cosmological simulations, based on the IllustrisTNG subgrid, to study the origin of this mass scale and whether it persists when varying feedback from SN and AGN. We focus on the correlation between the total-to-stellar mass within the half-mass radius and stellar mass, which follows an inverted bell-shaped trend, with a minimum at the golden mass. SN feedback processes impact the emergence of the golden mass, which shifts to lower mass for high values of wind velocity and energy. We find that most AGN feedback parameters influence the emergence of the golden mass, altering the correlation slope at high mass: the black hole radiative efficiency is the most impactful, followed by the black hole feedback factor and quasar threshold. ETGs preserve the inverted bell-shaped trend, while LTGs have monotonically decreasing DM fractions with mass, with mild indication of an inversion only at low redshift, confirming results from observations. When connecting with global quantities, we see that star formation efficiency show a bell-shaped trend peaking at the golden mass, with behaviours that mirror the central quantities. In ETGs a peak at lower mass is seen, while LTGs mirror the behaviour in the central quantity, with mild indication of a maximum in the stellar fraction only at low redshift. Overall, we find that the emergence of the golden mass is driven by the SN- and AGN-feedback and appears earlier in cosmic time for stronger-feedback simulations, which faster quench star formation in the most massive galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 T-type brown dwarfs present an opportunity to explore atmospheres teeming with molecules such as H2O, CH4 and NH3, which exhibit a wealth of absorption features in the mid-infrared. With JWST, we can finally explore this chemistry in detail, including for the coldest brown dwarfs that were not yet discovered in the Spitzer era. This allows precise derivations of the molecular abundances, which in turn informs our understanding of vertical transport in these atmospheres and can provide clues about the formation of cold brown dwarfs and exoplanets. This study presents the first JWST/MRS mid-IR spectrum (R ~ 1500-3000) of a T-dwarf: the T8.5+T9 brown dwarf binary WISE J045853.90+643451.9. We fit the spectrum using a parameterized P-T profile and free molecular abundances (i.e., a retrieval analysis), treating the binary as unresolved. We find a good fit with a cloud-free atmosphere and identify H2O, CH4 and NH3 features. Moreover, we make the first detections of HCN and C2H2 (at 13.4$\sigma$ and 9.5$\sigma$ respectively) in any brown dwarf atmosphere. The detection of HCN suggests intense vertical mixing ($K_{zz}\sim10^{11}$cm$^2$s$^{-1}$), challenging previous literature derivations of $K_{zz}$ values for T-type brown dwarfs. Even more surprising is the C2H2 detection, which cannot be explained with existing atmospheric models for isolated objects. This result challenges model assumptions about vertical mixing, and/or our understanding of the C2H2 chemical network, or might hint towards a more complex atmospheric processes such as magnetic fields driving aurorae, or lightning driving ionization. These findings open a new frontier in studying carbon chemistry within brown dwarf atmospheres.

 - **Abstract**
 The large abundance of electrically neutral particles has a remarkable impact on the dynamics of many astrophysical plasmas. Here, we use a two-fluid model that includes charge-neutral elastic collisions and Hall's current to study the propagation of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves in weakly ionized plasmas. we derive the dispersion relation for small-amplitude incompressible transverse waves propagating along the background magnetic field. Then, we focus on the polarization relations fulfilled by the eigenmodes and their corresponding ratios of magnetic to kinetic energies, and we study their dependence on the relations between the oscillation, collision and cyclotron frequencies. For low wave frequencies, the two components of the plasma are strongly coupled, the damping due to the charge-neutral interaction is weak and the effect of Hall's term is negligible. However, as the wave frequency increases, phase shifts between the velocity of charges, the velocity of neutrals, and the magnetic field appear, leading to enhanced damping. The effect of collisions on the propagation of waves strongly depends on their polarization state, with the left-handed circularly polarized ion-cyclotron modes being more efficiently damped than the linearly polarized Alfvén waves and the right-handed circularly polarized whistler modes. Moreover, the equipartition relation between the magnetic energy and the kinetic energy of Alfvén waves does not hold in general when the collisional interaction and Hall's current are taken into account, with the magnetic energy usually dominating over the kinetic energy. This theoretical result extends previous findings from observational and numerical works about turbulence in astrophysical scenarios.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Pre-stellar cores are the birthplaces of Sun-like stars and represent the initial conditions for the assembly of protoplanetary systems. Due to their short lifespans, they are rare. In recent efforts to increase the number of such sources identified in the Solar neighbourhood, we have selected a sample of 40 starless cores from the publicly available core catalogs of the Herschel Gould Belt survey. In this work, we focus on one of the sources that stands out for its high central density: Corona Australis 151. Aims. We use molecular lines that trace dense gas (n>=10^6 cm-3) to confirm the exceptionally high density of this object, to study its physical structure, and to understand its evolutionary stage. Methods. We detected the N2H+ 3-2 and 5-4 transitions, and the N2D+ 3-2, 4-3, and 6-5 lines with the APEX telescope. We use the Herschel continuum data to infer a spherically symmetric model of the core's density and temperature. This is used as input to perform non-local-thermodynamic-equilibrium radiative transfer to fit the observed five lines. Results. Our analysis confirms that this core is characterised by very high densities (a few x 10^7 cm-3 at the centre) and cold temperatures. We infer a high deuteration level of N2D+/N2H+=0.50, indicative of an advanced evolutionary stage. In the large bandwidth covered by the APEX data, we detect several other deuterated species, including CHD2OH, D2CO, and ND3. We also detect multiple sulphurated species that present broader lines with signs of high-velocity wings. Conclusions. The observation of high-velocity wings and the fact that the linewidths of N2H+ and N2D+ become larger with increasing frequency can be interpreted either as an indication of supersonic infall motions developing in the central parts of a very evolved pre-stellar core or as the signature of outflows from a very low luminosity object (VeLLO). *SHORTENED*

 - **Abstract**
 Aims: We characterize and quantify this multi-scale flow for a prototypical high-mass star-forming region. Methods: In a multi-scale analysis from parsec to ~50au scales, we combined multiple single-dish and interferometric observations to study the gas flow from large-scale sizes of several parsec (Mopra) via intermediate-scale filamentary gas flows (ALMA-IMF) to the central cores (ALMA DIHCA and configuration 10 data). The highest-resolution multi-configuration ALMA dataset achieved a spatial resolution of 0.027''x0.022'' or 50au. Results: This multi-scale study allows us to follow the gas from the environment of the high-mass star-forming region (~2pc) via intermediate-scale (~0.25pc) filamentary gas flows down to the innermost cores within the central few 1000au. The intermediate-scale filaments connect spatially and kinematically to the larger-scale cloud as well as the innermost cores. We estimate a filamentary mass inflow rate around 10^-3M_sun/yr, feeding into the central region that hosts at least a dozen mm cores. While the flow from the cloud via the filaments down to 10^4au appears relatively ordered, within the central 10^4au the kinematic structures become much more complicated and disordered. We speculate that this is caused by the interplay of the converging infalling gas with feedback processes from the forming central protostars. Conclusions: This multi-scale study characterises and quantifies the hierarchical gas flow from clouds down to the central protostars for a prototypical infrared dark cloud with several embedded cores at an unprecedented detail. While comparatively ordered gas flows are found over a broad range of scales, the innermost area exhibits more disordered structures, likely caused by the combination of inflow, outflow and cluster dynamical processes.

 - **Abstract**
 We measure radial stellar age gradients in the relatively isolated gas-rich dwarf irregular WLM, combining JWST NIRCam and NIRISS imaging with six archival Hubble fields over semi-major axis equivalent distances of 0$\lesssim$R$_{SMA}$$\lesssim$4 kpc ($\lesssim$3R$_{hl}$). Fitting lifetime star formation histories (SFHs) to resolved color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), radial age gradients are quantified using $\tau_{90}$ and $\tau_{50}$, the lookback times to form 90\% and 50\% of the cumulative stellar mass. We find that globally, the outskirts of WLM are older on average, with ($\delta$$\tau_{90}$, $\delta$$\tau_{50}$)/$\delta$R$_{SMA}=$(0.82$^{+0.10}_{-0.10}$, 1.60$^{+0.23}_{-0.22}$) Gyr/kpc (stat.), in good agreement with simulations. However, we also detect an azimuthal dependence of radial stellar age gradients, finding that stars on the leading edge of WLM (relative to its proper motion) are both younger and have a flatter age gradient compared to the trailing edge. This difference persists over 0.6$\lesssim$R$_{SMA}$$\lesssim$3.2 kpc ($\sim$0.5$-$2.5R$_{hl}$) and lookback times up to $\sim$8 Gyr, and is robust to assumed stellar evolutionary model. Our results are consistent with star formation triggered by ram pressure stripping from a circumgalactic and/or intergalactic medium, suggested by recent HI observations. If confirmed, processes typifying dense environments, such as ram pressure stripping, may be more relevant to the evolution of isolated galaxies than previously thought.

 - **Abstract**
 Spectropolarimetric inversions of solar observations are fundamental for the estimation of the magnetic field in the solar atmosphere. However, instrumental noise, computational requirements, and varying levels of physical realism make it challenging to derive reliable solar magnetic field estimates. In this study, we present a novel approach for spectropolarimetric inversions based on Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to infer the photospheric magnetic field under the Milne-Eddington approximation (PINN ME). Our model acts as a representation of the parameter space, mapping input coordinates (t, x, y) to the respective spectropolarimetric parameters, which are used to synthesize the corresponding stokes profiles. By iteratively sampling coordinate points, synthesizing profiles, and minimizing the deviation from the observed stokes profiles, our method can find the set of Milne-Eddington parameters that best fit the observations. In addition, we directly include the point-spread-function to account for instrumental effects. We use a predefined parameter space as well as synthetic profiles from a radiative MHD simulation to evaluate the performance of our method and to estimate the impact of instrumental noise. Our results demonstrate that PINN ME achieves an intrinsic spatio-temporal coupling, which can largely mitigate observational noise and provides a memory-efficient inversion even for extended fields-of-view. Finally, we apply our method to observations and show that our method provides a high spatial coherence and can resolve small-scale features both in strong- and weak-field regions.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a multi-wavelength analysis of three candidate active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in low-mass galaxies in the Boötes field with the aim of improving constraints on the occupation fraction of low-mass black holes (BHs). Galaxies with low stellar masses ($M_{\star} < 10^{9.5} M_{\odot}$) are particularly interesting hosts for AGNs as they may contain BHs that have not grown significantly since the epoch of their formation in the early Universe. Using archival data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory, we find three X-ray luminous low-mass galaxies and assess whether they host AGNs. We find one of these sources to be variable in the X-ray and compute its X-ray light curve and spectrum. We compute the X-ray, mid-infrared, and [O III] luminosities and compare them to established AGN luminosity relationships in the literature. We then fit various star-forming, dust emission, and AGN templates to the spectral energy distributions (SEDs). The star formation rates estimated from the SED fits are unable to explain the observed X-ray luminosities of the candidates, providing more support for the presence of AGNs. By analysing the deviation from linear relationships between X-ray and mid-infrared luminosities, we find these systems to be obscured (with $\log N_{\rm H}[{\rm {cm^{-2}}}] \sim 22.7, > 25.0$, and $24.4$, respectively). We employ the scaling relationship between BH mass and stellar velocity dispersion to estimate the BH masses as $\sim 10^5 - 10^6 M_{\odot}$ and accreting at Eddington ratios $10^{-2} < \lambda_{\rm Edd} <10^{-1}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Microcalorimeter instruments aboard future X-ray observatories will require an anti-coincidence (anti-co) detector to veto charged particle events and reduce the non-X-ray background. We have developed a large-format, TES-based prototype anti-coincidence detector that is particularly suitable for use with spatially-extended (~ 10 cm^2}) TES microcalorimeter arrays, as would be used for a future large field-of-view X-ray missions. This prototype was developed in the context of the Line Emission Mapper (LEM) probe concept, which required a ~ 14 cm^2 anti-co detector with > 95% live time and a low-energy threshold below 20 keV. Our anti-co design employs parallel networks of quasiparticle-trap-assisted electrothermal feedback TESs (QETs) to detect the athermal phonon signal produced in the detector substrate by incident charged particles. We developed multiple prototype anti-co designs featuring 12 channels and up to 6300 QETs. Here we focus on a design utilizing tungsten TESs and present characterization results. Broad energy range measurements have been performed (4.1 keV -- 5.5 MeV). Based on noise and responsivity measurements, the implied low-energy threshold is < 1 keV and a live time fraction of > 96% can be achieved up to 5.5 MeV. We also find evidence of mm-scale-or-better spatial resolution and discuss the potential utility of this for future missions. Finally, we discuss the early development of a soild-state physics model of the anti-co towards understanding phonon propagation and quasiparticle production in the detector.
