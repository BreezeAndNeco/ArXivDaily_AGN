 - **Abstract**
 We present nuclear (100-150 pc) spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for a sample of 23 nearby luminous infrared galaxies hosting a total of 28 nuclei. We gather aperture photometry from high-resolution X-ray to submillimeter data for each nuclear region localized by ALMA observations of the dust continuum. We model the broadband SEDs using X-CIGALE. Binning the merging systems by interaction class, we find that the AGN fraction (fraction of AGN infrared luminosity to total infrared luminosity) appears enhanced in the late- and post-merger stages compared to early-stage mergers. Examining the relationship between X-ray emission and infrared emission of the nuclear regions, we find that the infrared emission in the nucleus is dominated by dust and AGN, with minimal contribution from stars. We also find that nuclear regions have higher X-ray hardness ratios than the host galaxies globally among both the AGN and non-AGN population. We highlight the similarities and differences in the SEDs of dual nuclei in five closely separated late-stage merging systems: Arp 220 ($d_\mathrm{nuc} \sim$ 0.5 kpc), NGC 6240 ($d_\mathrm{nuc} \sim$ 1 kpc), IRAS 07251-0248 ($d_\mathrm{nuc} \sim$ 2 kpc), IRAS F12112+0305 ($d_\mathrm{nuc} \sim$ 4 kpc), and IRAS F14348+1447 ($d_\mathrm{nuc} \sim$ 6 kpc). The SEDs for these resolved pairs are distinct, suggesting that the AGN state is much more susceptible to the stellar and dust content within the immediate circumnuclear ($<$150 pc) environment than to the host's global infrared luminosity or merger stage.

 - **Abstract**
 Theoretical arguments and observations suggest that in massive halos ($>10^{12}\,M_\odot$), the circumgalactic medium (CGM) is dominated by a 'hot' phase with gas temperature near the virial temperature ($T \approx T_{\rm vir}$) and a quasi-hydrostatic pressure profile. Lower-mass halos are however unlikely to be filled with a similar quasi-static hot phase, due to rapid radiative cooling. Using the FIRE cosmological zoom simulations, we demonstrate that the hot phase is indeed sub-dominant at inner radii ($\lesssim 0.3\,R_{\rm vir}$) of $\lesssim 10^{12}\,M_\odot$ halos, and the inner CGM is instead filled with $T \ll T_{\rm vir}$ gas originating in outflows and inflows, with a turbulent velocity comparable to the halo virial velocity. The turbulent velocity thus exceeds the mass-weighted sound speed in the inner CGM, and the turbulence is supersonic. UV absorption features from such CGM trace the wide lognormal density distributions of the predominantly cool and turbulent volume-filling phase, in contrast with tracing localized cool 'clouds' embedded in a hot medium. We predict equivalent widths of $W_\lambda \sim 2\lambda v_c/c \sim 1A$ for a broad range of strong UV and EUV transitions (Mg II, C II, C IV, Si II-IV, O III-V) in sightlines through inner CGM dominated by turbulent pressure of $\lesssim L^*$ galaxies at redshifts $0 \leq z \lesssim 2$, where $\lambda$ is the transition wavelength, $v_{\rm c}$ is the halo circular velocity and $c$ is the speed of light. Comparison of our predictions with observational constraints suggests that star-forming dwarf and $\lesssim L^*$ galaxies are generally dominated by turbulent pressure in their inner CGM, rather than by thermal pressure. The inner CGM surrounding these galaxies is thus qualitatively distinct from that around quenched galaxies and massive disks such as the Milky-Way, in which thermal pressure likely dominates.

 - **Abstract**
 Using high-resolution general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations, we investigate accretion flows around spinning black holes and identify three distinct accretion states. Our results naturally explain some of the complex phenomenology observed across the black hole mass spectrum. The magnetically arrested disk (MAD) state, characterized by strong magnetic fields (plasma-$\beta << 1$), exhibits powerful jets (of power $\sim10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$), highly variable accretion, and significant sub-Keplerian motion. On the other hand, weakly magnetized disks (plasma-$\beta >> 1$), known as the standard and normal evolution (SANE) state, show steady accretion with primarily thermal winds. An intermediate state bridges the gap between MAD and SANE regimes, with moderate magnetic support (plasma-$\beta \sim 1$) producing mixed outflow morphologies and complex variability. This unified framework explains the extreme variability of GRS 1915+105, the steady jets of Cyg X-1, and the unusually high luminosities (even super-Eddington based on stellar mass black hole) of HLX-1 without requiring super-Eddington mass accretion rates. Our simulations reveal a hierarchy of timescales that explain the rich variety of variability patterns, with magnetic processes driving transitions between states. Comparing two with three dimensional simulations demonstrates that while quantitative details differ, the qualitative features distinguishing different accretion states remain robust. The outflow power and variability follow a fundamental scaling relation with mass determined by the magnetic field configuration, demonstrating how similar accretion physics operates from stellar-mass X-ray binaries (XRBs) to intermediate mass black hole sources. This could be extrapolated further to supermassive black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) discovered 79 transients out to $z$$\sim$4.8 through the JADES Transient Survey (JTS), but the JTS did not find any $z$$>$5 transients. Here, we present the first photometric evidence of a $z$$>$5 transient/variable source with JWST. The source, AT 2023adya, resides in a $z_{\mathrm{spec}}$$=$5.274 galaxy in GOODS-N, which dimmed from $m_{\rm F356W}$$=$26.05$\pm$0.02 mag to 26.24$\pm$0.02 mag in the rest-frame optical over approximately two rest-frame months, producing a clear residual signal in the difference image ($m_{\rm F356W}$$=$28.01$\pm$0.17 mag; SN$_\mathrm{var}$$=$6.09) at the galaxy center. Shorter-wavelength bands (F090W/F115W) show no rest-frame ultraviolet brightness change. Based on its rest-frame V-band absolute magnitude of M$_\mathrm{V}$$=$$-$18.48 mag, AT 2023adya could be any core-collapse supernova (SN) subtype or an SN Ia. However, due to low SN Ia rates at high redshift, the SN Ia scenario is unlikely. Alternatively, AT 2023adya may be a variable active galactic nucleus (AGN). However, the JWST NIRCam/Grism spectrum shows no broad H$\alpha$ emission line (FWHM$=$130$\pm$26 km s$^{-1}$), disfavoring the variable AGN scenario. It is also unlikely that AT 2023adya is a tidal disruption event (TDE) because the TDE models matching the observed brightness changes have low event rates. Although it is not possible to determine AT 2023adya's nature based on the two-epoch single-band photometry alone, this discovery indicates that JWST can push the frontier of transient/variable science past $z$$=$5 and towards the epoch of reionization.

 - **Abstract**
 Motivated by recent discoveries of X-ray quasi-periodic eruptions, we revisit the collision of a black hole and an accretion disk. Assuming that they are orbiting a supermassive black hole in orthogonal orbits, we perform a general relativistic simulation of the collision, varying the relative velocity $V_0$ from $0.032c$ to $0.2c$ (where $c$ is the speed of light) with a variety of disk thickness and a realistic local density profile for the disk. Our findings indicate that the mass of the outflow matter from the disk, $m_{\rm ej}$, is slightly less than the expected value. Meanwhile, the typical energy associated with this outflow $E_{\rm ej}$ is $\sim m_{\rm ej}V_0^2$. Thus, the predicted peak luminosity from disk flares is approximately equal to the Eddington luminosity of the black hole, whereas the peak time and duration of the flares, which are $\propto m_{\rm ej}^{1/2}$, are shorter than that previously believed. We also demonstrate that the property of the outflow matter induced by the incoming and outgoing stages of the black hole collision is appreciably different. We find that a high mass accretion rate onto the black hole from the disk persists for a timescale of $\sim 10^6$ Schwarzschild time of the black hole after the collision for $V_0/c \lesssim 0.1$, making this long-term accretion onto the black hole the dominant emission process for black hole-disk collision events. Implications of these results are discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 Atmospheric turbulence degrades the quality of astronomical observations in ground-based telescopes, leading to distorted and blurry images. Adaptive Optics (AO) systems are designed to counteract these effects, using atmospheric measurements captured by a wavefront sensor to make real-time corrections to the incoming wavefront. The Fried parameter, r0, characterises the strength of atmospheric turbulence and is an essential control parameter for optimising the performance of AO systems and more recently sky profiling for Free Space Optical (FSO) communication channels. In this paper, we develop a novel data-driven approach, adapting machine learning methods from computer vision for Fried parameter estimation from a single Shack-Hartmann or pyramid wavefront sensor image. Using these data-driven methods, we present a detailed simulation-based evaluation of our approach using the open-source COMPASS AO simulation tool to evaluate both the Shack-Hartmann and pyramid wavefront sensors. Our evaluation is over a range of guide star magnitudes, and realistic noise, atmospheric and instrument conditions. Remarkably, we are able to develop a single network-based estimator that is accurate in both open and closed-loop AO configurations. Our method accurately estimates the Fried parameter from a single WFS image directly from AO telemetry to a few millimetres. Our approach is suitable for real time control, exhibiting 0.83ms r0 inference times on retail NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU hardware, and thereby demonstrating a compelling economic solution for use in real-time instrument control.

 - **Abstract**
 Long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs), including their subclasses of low-luminosity GRBs (LL-GRBs) and X-ray flashes (XRFs) characterized by low spectral peak energies, are known to be associated with broad-lined Type Ic supernovae (SNe Ic-BL), which result from the core collapse of massive stars that lose their outer hydrogen and helium envelopes. However, the soft and weak end of the GRB/XRF population remains largely unexplored, due to the limited sensitivity to soft X-ray emission. Here we report the discovery of a fast X-ray transient, EP250108a, detected by the Einstein Probe (EP) in the soft X-ray band at redshift $z = 0.176$, which was followed up by extensive multiband observations. EP250108a shares similar X-ray luminosity as XRF\,060218, the prototype of XRFs, but it extends GRBs/XRFs down to the unprecedentedly soft and weak regimes, with its $E_{\rm peak} \lesssim 1.8\,\mathrm{keV}$ and $E_{\rm iso} \lesssim 10^{49}\, \mathrm{erg}$, respectively. Meanwhile, EP250108a is found to be associated with SN\,2025kg, one of the most luminous and possibly magnetar-powered SNe Ic-BL detected so far. Modeling of the well-sampled optical light curves favors a mildly relativistic outflow as the origin of this event. This discovery demonstrates that EP, with its unique capability, is opening a new observational window into the diverse outcomes of death of massive stars.
#### Modeling Solar Spectral Irradiance (SSI) from Iron lines using the COronal DEnsity and Temperature (CODET) model version 1.1

 - **Abstract**
 The COronal DEnsity and Temperature (CODET) model is a physics-based model (Rodríguez-Gómez et al. 2018; Rodríguez-Gómez 2017) . This model uses the relationship between the magnetic field, density, temperature, and EUV emission. This model provides mean daily Solar Spectral Irradiance time series in EUV wavelengths in long time scales from days to solar cycles. The current manuscript presents the updated/new CODET model version 1.1. It uses observational datasets from SDO/EVE MEGS-A at $28.4 \ \mathrm{nm}$ and $21.1 \ \mathrm{nm}$ wavelengths to obtain the goodness-of-fit between them and the modeled SSI from April 30, 2010, to May 26, 2014. The model described well observational data during that period, with less than $20\%$ error in both wavelengths. Additionally, SSI predictions are provided using the new model parameters from July 1996 to October 2024, where SOHO/MDI and SDO/HMI photospheric magnetic field data are available. These predictions were compared with GOES/EUVS at $28.4 \ \mathrm{nm}$ and mean daily values of SDO/AIA at $21.1 \ \mathrm{nm}$ data, with errors of $\sim 26\%$ and $42\%$ for $28.4 \ \mathrm{nm}$ and $21.1 \ \mathrm{nm}$, respectively. The error analysis for model fitting and predictions shows how accurate the model predictions are. Thus, the CODET model provides a reliable estimate of the Solar Spectral Irradiance time series in EUV wavelengths where no observational data is available, e.g., after the SDO/EVE MEGS-A era.
#### ALEXIS: Recreating the X-Ray Emission from the Full Solar Disk as a Linear Combination of Discrete Regions in the Extreme Ultraviolet and Soft X-Rays

 - **Abstract**
 Despite a wealth of multi-wavelength, spatially resolved, time-domain solar activity data, an accurate and complete temporo-spatial solar flare census is unavailable, which impedes our understanding of the physics of flare production. We present an Automatically Labeled EUV and X-ray Incident SolarFlares (ALEXIS) pipeline, designed to decompose the X-Ray flux of the full solar disk into a minimum set of discrete regions on the Solar surface. ALEXIS returns an average RMSE between the XRS time series and the discrete EUV signals of 0.066 $\pm$ 0.036 for a randomly selected test bed sample of 1000 hour-long data segments from May 2010 - March 2020. Flare emission that requires multiple regions was found to be synchronous: flares occurring at the same time, sympathetic: flares separated by minutes, or needed to capture the background emission before and/or after the main flare. ALEXIS uses the original full resolution and cadence of both the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly Instrument and the GOES13-15 Solar X-Ray Imager. Comparison of the ALEXIS catalog with those produced by SWPC and SolarSoft show that these canonical databases need revisiting for 62$\%$ and 15$\%$ of the sub-sample, respectively. Additionally, we increased the number of flares reported by SWPC and SolarSoft by 15$\%$. Our pipeline misses 6.7$\%$ of the 1057 flare sub-sample and returns 5$\%$ of false positives from 1211 flares reported by ALEXIS. The ALEXIS catalog returns flare peak times, coordinates, the corrected scaled XRay magnitude, and the associated NOAA active region with a HARP identifier number independently from any external data products.

 - **Abstract**
 The spectral variability of changing-look active galactic nuclei (CL-AGNs) occurred on timescales of years to tens of years, posing a significant challenge to the standard thin disk model. In this work, we propose a sandwich model, including an optically thick disk in the mid-plane (Disk 1) and two disks of low effective optical depth on both sides (Disk 2). These two types of disks are coupled with magnetic fields, which allow viscous torque interaction between them. As a consequence, the radial velocity of Disk 1 can increase by up to three orders of magnitude compared to the standard thin disk, leading to an equivalent decrease in the accretion timescale. Therefore, such a sandwich model can account for the rapid variability in CL-AGNs. In addition, we also discuss the influence of the magnetic pressure on Disk 2. When Disk 2 is dominated by the magnetic pressure, it resembles a "warm corona", which is responsible for the soft X-ray excess.

 - **Abstract**
 Black holes, both supermassive and stellar-mass, impact the evolution of their surroundings on a large range of scales. While the role of supermassive black holes is well studied, the effects of stellar-mass black holes on their surroundings, particularly in inducing structures in the interstellar medium (ISM), remain under explored. This study focuses on the black hole X-ray binary GRS 1915+105, renowned for its active jets, and the primary aim is to unveil and characterise the impact of GRS 1915+105 on its environment by identifying structures induced by jet-ISM interaction. Methods: We observed GRS 1915+105 with MeerKAT for a total exposure time of 14~hr, and we obtained the deepest image of GRS 1915+105 to date. Using a previously proposed self-similar model for large-scale jets, we inferred the properties of both the jets and the ISM, providing insights into the jet-ISM interaction site. Our observations revealed a bow shock structure near GRS 1915+105, likely induced by a jet interacting with the ISM and blowing an overpressured cavity in the medium. We constrained the ISM density to 100--160 particles\,cm$^{-3}$ while assuming a temperature range of 10$^4$--10$^6$\,K, which implies a bow shock expansion velocity of $20\,{\rm km\,s}^{-1}<\dot{L} <\,360\,{\rm km\,s}^{-1}$. We estimate that the jet responsible for the formation of the bow shock has an age between 0.09 and 0.22 Myr, and the time-averaged energy rate Conclusions: Our results confirm that in stellar-mass black holes, the energy dissipated through jets can be comparable to the accretion energy, and through the interaction of the jet with the ISM, such energy is transferred back to the environment. This feedback mechanism mirrors the powerful influence of supermassive black holes on their environments, underscoring the significant role a black hole's activity has in shaping its surroundings.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar active regions (ARs) are crucial for understanding the long-term evolution of solar activities and predicting eruptive phenomena, including solar flares and coronal mass ejections. However, the cycle-dependent properties in the north-south asymmetry of ARs have not been fully understood. In this study, we investigate the hemispheric distribution of ARs from Carrington Rotation 1909 to 2278 (between 1996 May and 2023 November) by using three parameters that describe the magnetic field distribution of ARs: number, area, and flux. The main findings are as follows: (1) The three AR parameters show significant hemispheric asymmetry in cycles 23-25. The strong correlation between AR area and flux indicates that they can better reflect the intrinsic properties of solar magnetic field. (2) The correlation between sunspot activity and AR parameters varies in the two hemispheres across the different cycles. The AR parameters provide additional information for the variations in sunspot activity, which can better predict the intensity and cyclical changes of solar activity. (3) The variation in the fitting slope sign of the asymmetry index for AR parameters reflects periodic changes in hemispheric ARs, providing valuable insights into the activity of other stars. (4) Both the dominant hemisphere and the cumulative trend of AR parameters display a cycle-dependent behavior. Moreover, the trend variations of AR area and flux are similar, reflecting the long-term evolutionary characteristics of solar magnetic field. Our analysis results are relevant for understanding the hemispheric coupling of solar magnetic activity and its cyclic evolutionary patterns.

 - **Abstract**
 As the lifetime of a black hole decreases, the energy of the Hawking radiation it emits increases, ultimately culminating in its disappearance through a powerful burst of gamma rays. For primordial black holes (PBHs) with an initial mass of $\sim 5\times10^{14}$ g, their lifespans are expected to end in the present epoch. Detecting such PBH bursts would provide compelling evidence of their existence. The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) has the potential to observe these bursts at the high-energy end of the gamma-ray spectrum. To investigate this possibility, we conduct a study to evaluate the sensitivity of CTA to the local burst rate density of PBHs. Our results suggest that during a 5-year observational campaign, CTA could exclude a local burst rate density exceeding $\sim 36\ \mathrm{pc}^{-3}\ \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, which represents an improvement of one order of magnitude over the upper limit set by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). In addition, we propose an observation strategy optimized for detecting PBH bursts.

 - **Abstract**
 Determining stellar ages is challenging, particularly for cooler main-sequence stars. Magnetic evolution offers an observational alternative for age estimation via the age-chromospheric activity (AC) relation. We evaluate the impact of metallicity on this relation using near one-solar-mass stars across a wide metallicity range. We analyze a sample of 358 solar-type stars with precise spectroscopic parameters determined through a line-by-line differential technique and with ages derived using Yonsei-Yale isochrones. We measured chromospheric activity (S-index) using high-quality HARPS spectra, calibrated to the Mount Wilson system, and converted to the $R^{\prime}_{\mathrm HK}(T_{\mathrm{eff}})$ index with a temperature-based photospheric correction. Our findings show that the AC relation for $R^{\prime}_{\mathrm HK}(T_{\mathrm{eff}})$ is strongly influenced by metallicity. We propose a new age-activity-metallicity relation for solar-type main-sequence (MS) stars ($\log{g} \gtrsim 4.2 $) with temperatures 5370 $\lesssim$ $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$ $\lesssim$ 6530 K and metallicities from -0.7 to +0.3 dex. We show that taking metallicity into account significantly enhances chromospheric ages' reliability, reducing the residuals' root mean square (RMS) relative to isochronal ages from 2.6 Gyr to 0.92 Gyr. This reflects a considerable improvement in the errors of chromospheric ages, from 53\% to 15\%. The precision level achieved in this work is also consistent with previous age-activity calibration from our group using solar twins.

 - **Abstract**
 Baryonic cycling is reflected in the spatial distribution of metallicity within galaxies, yet gas-phase metallicity distribution and its connection with other properties of dwarf galaxies are largely unexplored. We present the first systematic study of radial gradients of gas-phase metallicities for a sample of 55 normal nearby star-forming dwarf galaxies (stellar mass $M_\star$ ranging from $10^7$ to $10^{9.5}\ M_\odot$), based on MUSE spectroscopic observations. We find that metallicity gradient shows a significant negative correlation (correlation coefficient $r \approx -0.56$) with $\log M_\star$, in contrast to the flat or even positive correlation observed for higher-mass galaxies. This negative correlation is accompanied by a stronger central suppression of metallicity compared to the outskirts in lower-mass galaxies. Among the other explored galaxy properties-including baryonic mass, star formation distribution, galaxy environment, regularity of the gaseous velocity field, and effective yield of metals $y_{\rm eff}$-only the velocity field regularity and $y_{\rm eff}$ show residual correlation with the metallicity gradient after controlling for $M_\star$, in the sense that galaxies with irregular velocity fields or lower $y_{\rm eff}$ tend to have less negative or more positive gradients. Particularly, a linear combination of $\log M_\star$ and $\log y_{\rm eff}$ significantly improves the correlation with metallicity gradient ($r \approx -0.68$) compared to $\log M_\star$ alone. The lack of correlation with environment disfavors gas accretion as a dominant factor. Our findings imply that metal mixing and transport processes, including but not limited to feedback-driven outflows, are more important than in-situ metal production in shaping the metallicity distribution of dwarf galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 The co-evolution of massive black holes (BHs) and their host galaxies is well-established within the hierarchical galaxy formation paradigm. Large-scale cosmological simulations are an ideal tool to study the repeated BH mergers, accretion and feedback that conspire to regulate this process. While such simulations are of fundamental importance for understanding the complex and intertwined relationship between BHs and their hosts, they are plagued with numerical inaccuracies at the scale of individual BH orbits. To quantify this issue, taking advantage of the $(100 \, h^{-1}\,\text{cMpc})^3$ FABLE simulation box, we track all individual BH mergers and the corresponding host galaxy mergers as a function of cosmic time. We demonstrate that BH mergers frequently occur prematurely, well before the corresponding merger of the host galaxies is complete, and that BHs are sometimes erroneously displaced from their hosts during close galaxy encounters. Correcting for these artefacts results in substantial macrophysical delays, spanning over several Gyrs, which are additional to any microphysical delays arising from unresolved BH binary hardening processes. We find that once the macrophysical delays are accounted for, high-mass BH merger events are suppressed, affecting the predictions for the BH population that may be observable with LISA and pulsar timing arrays. Furthermore, including these macrophysical delays leads to an increase in the number of observable dual active galactic nuclei, especially at lower redshifts, with respect to FABLE. Our results highlight the pressing need for more accurate modelling of BH dynamics in cosmological simulations of galaxy formation as we prepare for the multi-messenger era.

 - **Abstract**
 The chemical enrichment of X-ray-emitting hot halos has primarily been studied in closed-box galaxy clusters. Investigating the metal content of lower-mass, open systems can serve as a valuable tracer for understanding their dynamical history and the extent of chemical enrichment mechanisms in the Universe. In this context, we use an 85.6 ks XMM-Newton observation to study the spatial distribution of the abundance ratios of Mg, Si, and S with respect to Fe in the hot gas of the ram-pressure-stripped M86, which has undergone morphological transformations. We report that the chemical composition in the M86 galaxy core is more similar to the rest of the hot gaseous content of the Universe than to its stellar population. This result indicate that even extreme supersonic ram-pressure is insufficient to strip the inner part of a galaxy of its hot atmosphere. Comparison with other galaxies undergoing ram-pressure stripping suggests that stripping the "primordial" atmosphere of a galaxy requires a combination of ram-pressure stripping and strong radio-mechanical AGN activity. The X-ray emission structures within M86, the plume and the tail, are found to be relatively isothermal. We observe that the Mg/Fe ratio in the plume is $3.3\sigma$ higher than in the M86 galaxy core and is consistent with that in the M86 group outskirts and the Virgo ICM, suggesting that the plume might originate from the low-entropy group gas due to a galaxy-galaxy collision rather than from the ram-pressure stripping of the dense galaxy core.

 - **Abstract**
 Accretion and outflows are astrophysical phenomena observed across a wide range of objects, from white dwarfs to supermassive black holes. Developing a complete picture of these processes requires complementary studies across this full spectrum of jet-launching sources. Jet-interstellar medium (ISM) interaction sites near black hole X-ray binaries provide unique laboratories to study jet energetics. This work aims to detect and characterise the bow shock near one black hole X-ray binary, Cyg X-1, and then use this bow shock structure to parametrise the properties of the jet launched by Cyg X-1 over its lifetime. We used the MeerKAT radio telescope to investigate the bow shock structure formed by the interaction between the jets of Cyg X-1 and the ISM. We successfully detect the bow shock north of Cyg X-1 in the L and S bands and report its size and brightness. We present the spectral index distribution across the bow shock, which is in the range -0.9 to 0.4, with an error distribution (0.6 to 1.5) that peaks at unity. We determine that the unshocked ISM density is 6-7 cm^-3 for a temperature range of 10^4 to 3*10^6 K. This temperature range suggests that the velocity of the bow shock is 21 km/s to 364 km/s. The age of the Cyg X-1 jet responsible for the bow shock is 0.04 to 0.3 Myr, and the power of the jet is constrained to 2*10^31 ergs/s to 10^35 ergs/s. We also detect new morphological features of the bow shock in the S-band image. The comparison of archival H_alpha maps with the new radio observations hints at different regions of emission, different temperature ranges, and different ISM densities. The spectral index suggests a consistent emission origin across the structure. The ISM density around Cyg X-1 is on the higher end for Galactic environments, and our results indicate a lower jet energy transport rate than prior estimates.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate a quintessence axion model for dynamical dark energy, motivated in part by recent results from the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). By carefully treating the initial conditions and parameter sampling, we identify a preferred parameter space featuring a sub-Planckian axion decay constant and a relatively large axion mass, which naturally avoids the quality problem and remains consistent with the perturbative string conjecture. Our parameter scan also uncovers a trans-Planckian regime of theoretical interest, which is only mildly disfavored by observations. The results remain robust when DESI BAO data are combined with CMB and supernova observations. Finally, we discuss the possible connection between this model and the recently reported non-zero rotation of the CMB linear polarization angle, emphasizing the broader cosmological implications and the promising prospects for testing this scenario. We show that an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ electromagnetic anomaly coefficient is preferred by the strongest constraint, which is in full agreement with the minimal quintessence axion model.

 - **Abstract**
 Hot dust-obscured galaxies (Hot DOGs), the most infrared (IR) luminous objects selected by the WISE all-sky mid-IR survey, have yielded a sample of intrinsically luminous quasars (QSOs) with obscured nuclear activity and hot dust temperatures. The molecular gas excitation properties have yet to be examined in detail under such extreme conditions. Here we study the most far-IR luminous WISE Hot DOG W2246-0526, focusing on the central host galaxy. Multi-J CO transition measurements at J=2-1, 5-4, 7-6, 12-11, and 17-16 provide the most well-sampled CO excitation ladder of any WISE Hot DOG to date, providing the first self-consistent modeling constraints on the molecular gas and dust properties. We implement a state-of-the-art TUrbulent Non-Equilibrium Radiative transfer model (TUNER) that simultaneously models both the line and dust continuum measurements. Due to a combination of high molecular gas densities and high kinetic temperatures, this extreme CO spectral line energy distribution peaks at J = 10 to 12, likely making this the most highly excited galaxy ever reported. We derive the alpha_CO conversion factors and conclude that (J=3-7) CO line luminosities trace the bulk of the molecular gas mass. W2246-0526 is a rapidly evolving system, with a high value of the molecular gas kinetic temperature versus dust temperature T_k / T_d ~ 3.9, reflecting previously reported shocks and outflows injecting kinetic energy within the central kpc of this host. This first comprehensive simultaneous modeling of both the molecular gas and dust in any object within the WISE-selected Hot DOG sample motivates obtaining well-sampled dust and line spectral energy distributions to better understand the conditions within these short-lived episodes in galaxy evolution that are associated with the most obscured supermassive black hole activity.

 - **Abstract**
 In the third-generation (3G) gravitational-wave (GW) detector era, GW multi-messenger observations for binary neutron star merger events can exert great impacts on exploring the cosmic expansion history. Extending the previous work, we explore the potential of 3G GW standard siren observations in cosmological parameter estimation by considering their associated electromagnetic (EM) counterparts, including $\gamma$-ray burst (GRB) coincidence observations by the Gravitational wave high-energy Electromagnetic Counterpart All-sky Monitor and GW-triggered target-of-opportunity observations of kilonovae by different optical survey projects. During an assumed 10-year observation, we predict that the number of detectable GW-kilonova events is $\sim 4900$ with redshifts below $\sim 0.4$ under GW network and Large Synoptic Survey Telescope in the $i$ band, which is three times more than that of GW-GRB detections. For the cosmological analysis, we find that with the inclusion of GW-kilonova detections, the constraints on cosmological parameters from GW-EM detections are significantly improved compared to those from GW-GRB detections. In particular, GW-EM detections can tightly constrain the Hubble constant with a precision ranging from $0.076\%$ to $0.034\%$. Moreover, GW multi-messenger observations could effectively break the cosmological parameter degeneracies generated by the mainstream EM observations, CMB+BAO+SN (CBS). The combination of CBS and GW-EM can tightly constrain the equation of state parameters of dark energy $w$ in the $w$CDM model and $w_0$ in the $w_0w_a$CDM model with precisions of $0.72\%$ and $0.99\%$, respectively, meeting the standard of precision cosmology. In conclusion, GW multi-messenger observations could play a crucial role in helping solve the Hubble tension and probing the fundamental nature of dark energy.

 - **Abstract**
 Adjacent type-I and -II proton superconductors in a rotation-powered pulsar are predicted to exist in a metastable state containing macroscopic and quantized flux tubes, respectively. Previous studies show that the type-I and -II regions are coupled magnetically, when macroscopic flux tubes divide dendritically into quantized flux tubes near the type-I-II interface, through a process known as flux branching. The studies assume that the normal-superconducting boundary is sharp, and the quantized flux tubes do not repel mutually. Here the sharp-interface approximation is refined by accounting for magnetic repulsion. It is found that flux tubes in the same flux tree cluster with a minimum-energy separation two to seven times less than that of isolated flux tubes. Neutron vortices pin and cluster about flux trees. We find that the maximum characteristic wave strain $h_0$ of the current quadrupole gravitational radiation emitted by a rectilinear array of clustered vortices exceeds by $(1+N_{\rm v,t})^{1/2}$ the strain $h_0 \sim 10^{-32}(f/30 {\rm Hz})^{5/2} (D/1 {\rm kpc})^{-1}$ emitted by uniformly distributed vortices, where $N_{\rm v,t}$ is the mean number of pinned vortices per flux tree, $f$ is the star's spin frequency, and $D$ is the star's distance from Earth. The factor $(1 + N_{\rm v,t})^{1/2}$ brings $h_0$ close to the sensitivity limit of the current generation of interferometric gravitational wave detectors under certain circumstances, specifically when flux branching forms relatively few (and hence relatively large) flux trees.

 - **Abstract**
 Quasar pair, a special subclass of galaxy pair, is valuable in the investigation of quasar interaction, co-evolution, merger, and clustering, as well as the formation and evolution of galaxies and supermassive black holes. However, quasar pairs at kpc-scale are rare in the universe. The scarcity of available samples hindered the deeper exploration and statistics of these objects. In this work, we apply an astrometric method to systematically search for quasar candidates within a transverse distance of 100 kpc to known quasars in the Million Quasar Catalog. These candidates are ${\it Gaia}$ sources with zero proper motion and zero parallax, which are the kinematic characteristics of extragalactic sources. Visual inspection of the sample was performed to remove the contamination of dense stellar fields and nearby galaxies. A total of 4,062 quasar pair candidates were isolated, with the median member separation, ${\it Gaia}$ G-band magnitude, and redshift of 8.81$^{\prime\prime}$, 20.49, and 1.59, respectively. Our catalog was compared with three major candidate quasar pair catalogs and identified 3,964 new quasar pair candidates previously uncataloged in the three catalogs. Extensive spectroscopic follow-up campaigns are being carried out to validate their astrophysical nature. Several interesting quasar pair candidates are highlighted and discussed. We also briefly discussed several techniques for improving the success rate of quasar pair selection.
