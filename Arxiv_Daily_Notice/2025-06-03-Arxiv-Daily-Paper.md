#### AGNI: A radiative-convective model for lava planet atmospheres

 - **Abstract**
 It is important that we are able to accurately model the atmospheres of (exo)planets. This is because atmospheres play a central role in setting a planet's thermochemical environment at a given point in time, and also in regulating how it evolves over geological timescales. Additionally, it is primarily by observation of their atmospheres that we are able to characterise exoplanets. There is particular demand for accurate models in the context of so-called lava worlds: planets with molten interiors (or `magma oceans'). AGNI is a Julia program designed to solve for the temperature and radiation environment within the atmospheres of rocky (exo)planets. It leverages a well established FORTRAN code to calculate radiative fluxes from a given atmospheric temperature structure and composition, which -- alongside representations of convection and other processes -- enables an energy-conserving numerical solution for the atmospheric conditions. In contrast to most other numerical atmosphere models, AGNI uses a Newton-Raphson optimisation method to obtain its solution, which enables improved performance and scalability. Our model was specifically developed for use alongside planetary interior models within a coupled simulation framework. However, it can also be applied to scientific problems standalone when used as an executable program; it reads TOML configuration files and outputs figures and NetCDF datasets. AGNI can also function as a software library; it is used in this sense within the Jupyter notebook tutorials of our GitHub repository (this https URL)
#### Complete survey of r-process conditions: the (un-)robustness of the r-process(-es)

 - **Abstract**
 Heavy elements are synthesized by the r-process in neutron star mergers and potentially in rare supernovae linked to strong magnetic fields. Expensive hydrodynamic simulations of these extreme environments are usually post-processed to calculate the nucleosynthesis. In contrast, here we follow a site-independent approach based on three key parameters: electron fraction, entropy, and expansion timescale. Our model reproduces the results based on hydrodynamic simulations. Moreover, the 120 000 astrophysical conditions analyzed allow us to systematically and generally explore the astrophysical conditions of the r-process, also beyond those found in current simulations. Our results show that a wide range of conditions produce very similar abundance patterns explaining the observed robustness of the r-process between the second and third peak. Furthermore, we cannot find a single condition that produces the full r-process from first to third peak. Instead, a superposition of at least two or three conditions or components is required to reproduce the typical r-process pattern as observed in the solar system and very old stars. The different final abundances are grouped into eight nucleosynthesis clusters, which can be used to select representative conditions for comparisons to observations and investigations of the nuclear physics input.

 - **Abstract**
 We perform 3D radiation-magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the evolution of the fallback debris after a tidal disruption event. We focus on studying the effects of magnetic fields on the formation and early evolution of the accretion flow. We find that large magnetic fields can increase the debris stream thickness, moderately reducing the efficiency of the radiative acceleration of outflows during the first self-intersecting collisions. As gas accumulates and the collisions happen instead between the infalling stream and the accretion flow, magnetized and nonmagnetized systems evolve similarly at these early times: radiation-driven outflows dominate early after the initial stream-stream collision and a few days later, the accretion rate exceeds the mass outflow rate. We find that the MRI does not play a significant role in angular momentum transport and dissipation. Nor do we find evidence of a magnetocentrifugal driven outflow. Instead, collisions continue to dissipate kinetic energy into radiation that launches outflows and powers TDE luminosities reaching $L\sim4-6\times10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Shock-driven outflows and inflows redistribute angular momentum throughout the extent ($\sim50 r_s$) of the forming eccentric disk. Even in the presence of magnetic stresses, the accretion flow remains mostly eccentric with $e\sim0.2-0.3$ for $r\lesssim8r_s$ and $e\sim0.4-0.5$ for $10\lesssim r\,(r_s)\lesssim50$. Lastly, we find a polar angle-dependent density structure compatible with the viewing-angle effect, along with an additional azimuthal angle dependence established by the collisions.
#### Stellar populations in STARFORGE II: Comparison with observations

 - **Abstract**
 Recent studies suggest that most star-forming regions in our Galaxy form stellar associations rather than bound clusters. We analyse models from the STARFORGE simulation suite, a set of magneto-hydrodynamical simulations that include all key stellar feedback and radiative processes following star formation through cloud dispersal. We create synthetic observations by introducing observational biases such as random spurious measurements, unresolved binaries, and photometric sensitivity. These biases affect the measurement of the group mass, size, and velocity dispersion, introducing uncertainties of up to 100%, with accuracy improving as the number of system members increases. Furthermore, models favouring the formation of groups around massive stars were the most affected by observational biases, as massive stars contribute a larger fraction of the group mass and are often missing from astrometric surveys like Gaia. We compare the simulations to the Cepheus Far North (CFN) region, and show that CFN groups may have formed in a low-density environment similar to those modelled in STARFORGE but with massive stars not located preferentially in groups. We also question the effectiveness of the kinematic traceback method, showing that it is accurate within 20% only for certain associations with actual virial parameters above 2. However, observational biases can artificially raise the virial parameter by up to a factor ten, making it difficult to evaluate the reliability of the traceback age. Additionally, since stars continue to form during the dispersal of the parent cloud, we find no relation between the stellar-dynamical age difference and the length of the embedded phase.
#### Millimeter-wave observations of Euclid Deep Field South using the South Pole Telescope: A data release of temperature maps and catalogs

 Context. The South Pole Telescope third-generation camera (SPT-3G) has observed over 10,000 square degrees of sky at 95, 150, and 220 GHz (3.3, 2.0, 1.4 mm, respectively) overlapping the ongoing 14,000 square-degree Euclid Wide Survey. The Euclid collaboration recently released Euclid Deep Field observations in the first quick data release (Q1). Aims. With the goal of releasing complementary millimeter-wave data and encouraging legacy science, we performed dedicated observations of a 57-square-degree field overlapping the Euclid Deep Field South (EDF-S). Methods. The observing time totaled 20 days and we reached noise depths of 4.3, 3.8, and 13.2 $\mu$K-arcmin at 95, 150, and 220 GHz, respectively. Results. In this work we present the temperature maps and two catalogs constructed from these data. The emissive source catalog contains 601 objects (334 inside EDF-S) with 54% synchrotron-dominated sources and 46% thermal dust emission-dominated sources. The 5$\sigma$ detection thresholds are 1.7, 2.0, and 6.5 mJy in the three bands. The cluster catalog contains 217 cluster candidates (121 inside EDF-S) with median mass $M_{500c}=2.12 \times 10^{14} M_{\odot}/h_{70}$ and median redshift $z$ = 0.70, corresponding to an order-of-magnitude improvement in cluster density over previous tSZ-selected catalogs in this region (3.81 clusters per square degree). Conclusions. The overlap between SPT and Euclid data will enable a range of multiwavelength studies of the aforementioned source populations. This work serves as the first step towards joint projects between SPT and Euclid and provides a rich dataset containing information on galaxies, clusters, and their environments.
#### The origin of the metallicity difference between star-forming and passive galaxies: Insights from ν2GC semi-analytic model

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the origin of the observed metallicity difference between star-forming and passive galaxies using the semi-analytic galaxy formation model nu2GC. Our fiducial model successfully reproduces the observed metallicity differences in local galaxies while simultaneously matching the potential-metallicity relations of both star-forming and passive galaxies. By varying the star formation efficiency, we identify strangulation as the primary driver of the metallicity difference. This finding highlights the critical role of star formation timescales in explaining the observed metallicity difference. Our results suggest that metallicity differences serve as a valuable diagnostic for evaluating star formation models in both semi-analytic models and cosmological simulations. Furthermore, galaxies quenched by processes resembling strangulation -- where the supply of cold gas is halted in a slowly growing halo -- exhibit higher metallicities than star-forming galaxies of the same stellar mass. In our model, this occurs in isolated, low-mass galaxies where rapid cooling leads to an effect resembling strangulation due to the discrete treatment of gas accretion onto dark matter halos. We propose that the metallicities of isolated, low-mass passive galaxies could provide key insights into refining models of hot gas halo growth.

 - **Abstract**
 Hydrodynamic simulations are powerful tools for studying galaxy formation. However, it is crucial to test and improve the sub-grid physics underlying these simulations by comparing their predictions with observations. To this aim, observable quantities can be derived for simulated galaxies, enabling the analysis of simulated properties through an observational approach. Our goal is to develop a new numerical tool capable of generating synthetic emission line spectra from spatially resolved regions in simulated galaxies, mocking Integral Field Unit (IFU) observations. Synthetic spectra of simulated galaxies are produced by integrating the software CIGALE with the outcomes of hydrodynamical simulations. We consider contributions of both stellar populations and nebular emission. The nebular emission lines in the spectra are modeled by considering only the contributions from the simulated star-forming regions. Our model considers the properties of the surrounding interstellar medium to estimate the ionizing parameters, the metallicity, the velocity dispersion and the electron density. We present the new numerical tool PRISMA. Leveraging synthetic spectra generated by our model, PRISMA successfully computed and recovered the intrinsic values of the star formation rate and gas-phase metallicity in local regions of simulated galaxies. Additionally, we examine the behavior of metallicity tracers such as N2, R23, O3N2, N2O2, recovered by PRISMA and propose new calibrations based on our simulated result. These findings show the robustness of our tool in recovering the intrinsic properties of simulated galaxies through their synthetic spectra, thereby becoming a powerful tool to confront simulations and observational data.

 - **Abstract**
 There are several physical processes that mediate the interaction between an exoplanet and its host star, with the four main ones being due to magnetic, particle (stellar outflow), radiative and tidal interactions. These interactions can be observed at different wavelengths, from X-ray to radio. Their strengths depend on the architecture of planetary systems, as well as the age and activity level of the host stars. In particular, exoplanets in close-in orbits and/or orbiting active host stars can experience strong physical interactions, some of which are negligible or absent in the present-day Solar System planets. Here, I present an overview of star-planet interactions through the lens of three-dimensional (3D) numerical models. The main conclusions are: * Models are fundamental to interpret and guide observations. The powerful combination of observations and models allows us to extract important physical parameters of the system, such as, planetary magnetic fields, stellar wind properties, etc. * The non-axisymmetric forces of the interactions generate spatially asymmetric features (e.g., planetary material trailing the orbit, shock formation), thus requiring the use of 3D models. * Star-planet interactions vary in different timescales (from hours to giga-years) that are related to both planetary (orbital motion, rotation) and stellar (flares, cycles, and long-term evolution) properties. Understanding these variations require time-dependent models. I advocate that future 3D models should be informed by multi-wavelength, (near-)simultaneous observations. The use of observations is twofold: some generate inputs for models (eg stellar magnetic field maps), whereas others are fitted by models (eg spectroscopic transits). This combination of observations and models provides a powerful tool to derive physical properties of the system that would otherwise remain unknown.

 - **Abstract**
 We exploit forecast sensitivities to high frequency gravitational waves (HFGWs) from superconducting LC circuits, traditional resonant cavity and superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities with electromagnetic and mechanical modes to derive the first projections of the bounce energy scale within the generic bouncing cosmology framework over the frequency window $1\,$kHz $\lesssim f\lesssim10\,$GHz. In comparison with existing astrophysical limits (spanning $10^{-17}\,$Hz $\lesssim f\lesssim1\,$kHz and based on Planck/BICEP, PTA, and aLIGO/LISA) our HFGW forecasts yield substantially tighter constraints across a broad region of parameter space. This work unifies constraints from cosmological observations and quantum measurement experiments, providing comprehensive coverage of the early Universe gravitational wave spectrum from $10^{-17}\,\mathrm{Hz}$ to $10\,\mathrm{GHz}$ and thereby probing the cosmic initial non singularity at ultra high energy scales.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the possibility of global cosmic rotation using a Gödel-type rotating cosmological model, constrained through a cosmographic analysis of Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) from the Pantheon+ dataset. Employing a Taylor-expanded apparent magnitude--redshift relation derived via the Kristian-Sachs formalism, we analyze low-redshift SNIa data across five redshift bins (up to $Z \leq 0.5$). Our results reveal a mild but consistent preference for cosmic rotation, with the dimensionless rotation parameter $\Omega_0$ peaking at $0.29^{+0.21}_{-0.15}$ for $Z \leq 0.2$, and a broadly aligned anisotropy axis centered around equatorial coordinates $(243^\circ, -49^\circ)$. The inferred Hubble constant $h_0 \approx 0.73$ remains stable across all bins, while the deceleration parameter $q_0$ trends from near-zero to mildly negative values with increasing redshift. Model comparison using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) indicates a statistically significant preference for the rotating model over the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology at intermediate redshifts. These findings suggest that cosmic rotation, if present, may influence the late-time expansion history of the universe and warrants further investigation beyond the cosmographic regime.
#### Correlations between Event Rates of Short Gamma-Ray Bursts and Star Formation Rates with/without Time Delay

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we systematically investigate the redshift and luminosity distributions as well as the event rates of short Gamma-Ray Bursts (SGRBs) detected by Swift, Fermi, Konus-wind satellites. It is found that the distributions of redshift and luminosity of Fermi and Konus-wind SGRBs are identical and they obviously differ from those of Swift/BAT SGRBs. The luminosity distributions of SGRBs detected by diverse detectors can be uniformly fitted by a smoothly broken power-law function. The median luminosity of Swift SGRBs is about one order of magnitude smaller than that of Fermi/GBM or Konus-wind SGRBs. We also compare the local event rates of Swift/BAT, Fermi/GBM and Konus-wind SGRBs and find that the local rate of Swift SGRBs is around two orders of magnitude larger than that of either Fermi or Konus-wind SGRBs, while the latter two rates are comparable. The observed SGRB rates can be successfully fitted by a power-law plus Gauss function. The SGRB rates of three kinds of detectors matches the delayed/undelayed SFRs well except the delayed Lognormal and/or Gaussian SFRs at higher redshift and exceed all types of SFRs at lower redshift of $z<1$. After deducting the diverse SFR components from the SGRB rates, we surprisingly notice that the remaining SGRB rates steeply decline with redshift in a power-law-like form, indicating that these SGRBs could emerge from the old star populations or compact binary star mergers.
#### Shaping core dynamos in A-type stars: The role of dipolar fossil fields

 - **Abstract**
 Large-scale magnetic fields of Ap/Bp stars are stable over long timescales and have typically simple dipolar geometries, leading to the idea of a fossil origin. These stars are also expected to have convective cores that can host strong dynamo action. We aim to study the interaction between the magnetic fields generated by the convective core dynamo of the star, and a dipolar fossil field reminiscent of observed magnetic topologies of Ap/Bp stars. We use numerical 3D star-in-a-box simulations of a $2.2M_\odot$ A-type star, where the core encompasses $20\%$ of the stellar radius. As an initial condition, we impose two purely poloidal configurations, both with a surface dipolar strength of 6 kG, and we explore different obliquity angles $\beta$ (the angle between the magnetic and rotational axes), ranging from $0^\circ$ to $90^\circ$. The inclusion of a poloidal field where none of the magnetic field lines are closed inside the star, does not affect the core dynamo in a significant way. Dipolar configurations where all the field lines are closed inside the star can enhance the dynamo, producing a superequipartition quasi-stationary solution, where the magnetic energy is 5 times stronger than the kinetic energy. The enhanced core dynamos have typical magnetic field strengths between 105 and 172 kG, where the strength has an inverse relation with $\beta$. The strong magnetic fields produce an almost rigid rotation in the radiative envelope, and change the differential rotation of the core from solar-like to anti-solar. The only cases where the imposed dipoles are unstable and decay are those with $\beta = 90^\circ$. In the rest of cases, the core dynamos are enhanced and the surface magnetic field survives keeping simple topologies like in the observations.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyzed high-resolution mid-infrared spectra of 78 well-known Herbig Ae/Be (HAeBe) stars using Spitzer InfraRed Spectrograph data, focusing on the detection of [Ne {\sc II}] and [Ne {\sc III}] emission lines as indicators of ionized outflows or disk winds. Emission from [Ne {\sc II}] at 12.81 $\mu$m or [Ne {\sc III}] at 15.55 $\mu$m was identified in 25 sources, constituting the largest sample of HAeBe stars with these detected lines. Our analysis revealed a higher detection frequency of [Ne {\sc II}] in sources with lower relative accretion luminosity (L$_{acc}$/L$_*$ $<$ 0.1), suggesting a connection to the disk dispersal phase. We examined correlations between neon lines and various spectral features and investigated [Ne {\sc III}]-to-[Ne {\sc II}] line flux ratios to explore potential emission mechanisms. Neon emission is predominantly observed in Group I sources (75\%), where their flared disk geometry likely contributes to the observed emission, potentially originating from the irradiated disk atmosphere. Interestingly, we also find that Group II sources exhibit a higher median relative [Ne\,\textsc{ii}] line luminosity (L$_\mathrm{[Ne\,II]}$/L$_*$), suggesting enhanced photoevaporation rates possibly associated with their more settled disk structures. However, larger samples and higher-resolution spectra are required to confirm this trend definitively. The high detection rate of the [Fe {\sc II}] and [S {\sc III}] lines, commonly associated with EUV-dominated regions, alongside a [Ne {\sc III}]-to-[Ne {\sc II}] emission ratio greater than 0.1 in sources where both lines detected, suggests that EUV radiation is the primary driver of neon emission in our sample.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the result of near-infrared spectroscopy using Keck/MOSFIRE for 23 member galaxies in an X-ray cluster XCS2215 ($z=1.46$) to investigate the environmental dependence of gaseous flows and metallicities. We find that the metallicities derived from H$\alpha$ and [N II] emission lines of the cluster galaxies are enhanced by 0.08-0.15 dex with $\sim$2 $\sigma$ significance compared to field counterparts for the same stellar mass. It suggests that inefficient gas accretion in the shock-heated intracluster medium (ICM) in the cluster core results in the lack of metallicity dilution. We also estimate the mass-loading factor by comparing the observed galaxies with the chemical evolution model that takes into account the outflow processes on the metallicity versus gas mass fraction diagram constructed together with the ALMA data. We find that the outflows from galaxies in the cluster core region tend to be weaker than those of galaxies in the general field. It is likely due to the confinement of gas by the high pressure of the surrounding ICM in the cluster core, which leads to the recycling of the outflowing gas that comes back to the system and is used for further star formation, resulting in the progression of chemical evolution. Compared with higher redshift protocluster galaxies at $z>2$, which tend to show lower metallicity than the field galaxies due probably to dilution of metals by pristine gas inflow, we are seeing the transition of gas accretion mode from efficient cold stream mode to the inefficient hot mode.
#### New insights on low-mass dark matter subhalo tidal tracks via numerical simulations

 - **Abstract**
 Many studies assert that dark matter (DM) subhaloes without a baryonic counterpart and with an inner cusp always survive no matter the strength of the tidal force they undergo. In this work, we perform a suite of numerical simulations specifically designed to analyse the evolution of $V_\mathrm{max}$, $r_\mathrm{max}$ and concentration of low-mass DM subhaloes due to tidal stripping. We employ the improved version of the DASH code, introduced in our previous work arXiv:2207.08652 to investigate subhalo survival. We follow the tidal evolution of a single DM subhalo orbiting a Milky Way (MW)-size halo modeled with a baryonic disc and a bulge replicating the actual mass distribution of the MW. We consider the effect of the time-evolving gravitational potential of the MW itself. We simulate subhaloes with unprecedented accuracy, varying their initial concentration, orbital parameters, and inner slope (both NFW and prompt cusps are considered). Unlike the previous literature, we examine the evolution of subhalo structural parameters -- tidal tracks -- not only at orbit apocentres but also at pericentres, finding in the former case both similarities and differences -- particularly pronounced in the case of prompt cusps. Overall, $r_\mathrm{max}$ shrinks more than $V_\mathrm{max}$, leading to a continuous rise of subhalo concentration with time. The velocity concentration at present is found to be around two orders of magnitude higher than the one at infall, being comparatively larger for pericentre tidal tracks versus apocentres. These findings highlight the dominant role of tidal effects in reshaping low-mass DM subhaloes, providing valuable insights for future research via simulations and observations, such as correctly interpreting data from galaxy satellite populations, subhalo searches with gravitational lensing or stellar stream analyses, and indirect DM searches.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxies with active galactic nuclei (AGN) exhibit broad emission lines as a key spectral feature. The shape of emission-line profiles depends on the complex dynamics of discrete clouds within a spatially extended region known as the Broad Line Region (BLR). The distribution of cloud positions within BLR, or the geometry of BLR indeed, is directly linked to measurements of time lags of BLR. In this paper, we convolve a large grid of physically-based simulations of cloud distributions in BLR with photon-flux weighted emissivity of BLR clouds to investigate the generic shape of spectral line profiles. More importantly, we extract the time-delay histograms of corresponding models to calculate the size of BLR. Our physical model is based on the assumption that the clouds are launched by the radiation pressure acting on dust in the atmosphere of the outer disk. It has very few global parameters. The model is appropriate for the low ionization part of the BLR, as it was shown by earlier model tests. It uses a non-hydrodynamical single-cloud approach to the BLR dynamics. In this way we simulate the distribution of positions and velocities of the clouds. We found that the width of line profiles gets broader with black hole mass, or with viewing angle, and gets narrower with accretion rate. The blue wing of the emission line profiles becomes more pronounced with increasing black hole mass and accretion rate, consistent with the formation and intensification of an outflow structure. We also found that the peak time-delays rather than averaged delay values better represents the observational trend and also the scatter in the radius-luminosity relation.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we explore the implications of the recent X-ray polarization observations of the X-ray Black Hole Binary (XRBHB) Cygnus X-1 (Cyg X-1) with IXPE and XL-Calibur. The discussion highlights the importance of the distance range from which the radiating zone draws its energy, and of the mechanism that transports the energy from the accretion disk into the radiating zone. We examine compact and extended corona models, finding that the former are energetically favored, but the latter cannot yet be fully excluded. Finally, the high linear polarization of the Cyg X-1 X-rays in the soft and in the hard states, parallel to the direction of the radio jet, is addressed. A scenario for the soft state is proposed in which shear stresses and magnetic reconnection create a pair layer enveloping the accretion disk, with the pairs accelerating due to radiation pressure from the accretion disk to mildly relativistic velocities. Comptonization by these pairs at roughly the same temperature as the accretion disk's radiation can explain the polarization properties without major modifications of the emitted energy spectrum. We emphasize that the geometry of the accretion flow in the hard state is still not well constrained, and that the polarization results depend sensitively on plasma processes responsible for energy dissipation in the plasma.

 - **Abstract**
 Hot dust-obscured galaxies (Hot DOGs) are a rare population of hyperluminous dust-obscured quasars discovered by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) all-sky survey. The heavy circumnuclear dust obscuration allows only a small amount of scattered light from the obscured quasar to escape, enabling the decomposition of the stellar component from the total flux. The presence of scattered light enables the redshift of the source and the properties of the black hole to be obtained from SDSS and SDSS-related literature. From WISE and SDSS data, we select 11 hyperluminous Hot DOGs at $z=1.5-3.7$ with bolometric luminosities $L_{\rm bol} \gtrsim 10^{47}\,\mathrm{erg \ s^{-1}}$. We investigate the $M_{\rm BH}-M_\star$ relation in these sources using Bayesian spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting or with extra constraints from \textit{Hubble Space Telescope} (HST) image decomposition. Stellar masses are successfully derived for eight Hot DOGs. We find high Eddington ratios $\lambda_{\rm Edd}$ in these Hot DOGs, with the median value of 1.05 and the maximum value close to 3. The super-Eddington accretion may be associated with the overdense environments of Hot DOGs. We find no significant differences in the $M_{\rm BH}/M_\star$ of these Hot DOGs compared to the local relation, suggesting that these dust-obscured quasars are the progenitors of massive early-type galaxies. We speculate that the subsequent evolution of Hot DOGs may be significantly influenced by AGN feedback and remain on the local relation.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are among the most energetic and enigmatic transients in the radio sky, with mounting evidence suggesting newborn, highly magnetized neutron stars formed in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) as their sources. A definitive spatial association between an FRB and a historic CCSN would confirm this link and tightly constrain young neutron star source models. Here we report on the first systematic cross-matching of 886 spectroscopically classified CCSNe in the local Universe (z $\leq$ 0.043) against 241 CHIME/FRB Catalog 1 events, applying rigorous spatial, dispersion measure (DM), and scattering time (${\tau}$) criteria. We identify four positional overlaps, all consistent with chance alignment; however, one pair, FRB 20190412B-SN 2009gi, also satisfies independent host-DM and ${\tau}$ constraints, making it a promising candidate for targeted follow-up. Next, we search for compact (persistent or transient) radio emission at all matched supernova sites using multi-epoch VLASS data and detect none. Treating every CCSN sight line as a non-detection, we derive Poisson upper limits on the FRB burst rate at these locations, which lie well below the rates observed for the most active repeaters unless their activity is heavily suppressed by beaming, intermittency, or residual free-free absorption. We then develop a galaxy-integrated FRB-rate model that incorporates an intrinsic spectral index, secular magnetar-activity decay, and frequency-dependent free-free opacity. Applying this formalism to existing FRB data shows that reproducing the observed CHIME/CRAFT all-sky rate ratio requires a steep decline in magnetar burst rates with age. Finally, our work underscores the necessity of sub-arcsecond localizations and multiwavelength follow-up to definitively test the young neutron star source hypothesis.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: The young massive cluster R136 at the center of 30 Doradus (30 Dor) in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) generates a cavity in the surrounding molecular cloud. However, there is molecular gas between 2 and 10 pc in projection from R136's center. The region, known as the Stapler nebula, hosts the closest known molecular gas clouds to R136. Aims: We investigated the properties of molecular gas in the Stapler nebula to better understand why these clouds survive so close in projection to R136. Methods: We used Atacama Large Millimeter/Sub-millimeter Array 7m observations in Band 7 (345 GHz) of continuum emission, $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO, together with dense gas tracers CS, HCO$^+$, and HCN. Our observations resolve the molecular clouds in the nebula into individual, parsec-sized clumps. We determined the physical properties of the clumps using both dust and molecular emission, and compared the emission properties observed close to R136 to other clouds in the LMC. Results: The densest clumps in our sample, where we observe CS, HCO$^+$, and HCN, are concentrated in a northwest-southeast diagonal seen as a dark dust lane in HST images. Resolved clumps have masses between $\sim 200-2500$ \Msun, and the values obtained using the virial theorem are larger than the masses obtained through $^{12}$CO and $^{12}$CO luminosity. The velocity dispersion of the clumps is due both to self-gravity and the external pressure of the gas. Clumps at the center of our map, which have detections of dense gas tracers ($n_{crit}\sim10^6$ cm$^{-3}$ and above), are spatially coincident with young stellar objects. Conclusions: The clumps' physical and chemical properties are consistent with other clumps in 30 Dor. We suggest that these clumps are the densest regions of a Molecular Cloud carved by the radiation of R136.

 - **Abstract**
 We present Monte Carlo simulations of relativistic radiation-mediated shocks (RRMS) in the photon-starved regime, incorporating photon escape from the upstream region -- characterized by the escape fraction, $f_{esc}$ -- under a steady-state assumption. These simulations, performed for shock Lorentz factors $\Gamma_u = 2$, $6$, and $10$, are applicable to RRMS breakouts occurring in shallowly declining density profiles, such as stellar winds. We find that vigorous pair production acts as a thermostat, regulating the downstream temperature to $\sim 100$-$200~{\rm keV}$, largely independent of $f_{\rm esc}$. A subshock forms and strengthens with increasing $f_{esc}$. The escaping spectra consistently peak at $E_p \approx 300$-$600~{\rm keV}$ in the shock frame and deviate from a Wien distribution, exhibiting low-energy flattening ($f_\nu \propto \nu^0$) due to free-free emission and high-energy extensions caused by inverse Compton scattering from subshock-heated pairs. While the existing analytical model (Granot et al. 2018) reproduces the velocity structure well at $\Gamma_u = 2$, it significantly overestimates the shock width at higher Lorentz factors, particularly for $f_{esc} \gtrsim$ a few $\%$. Based on this finding, we provide updated predictions for breakout observables in wind environments for $\Gamma_u \gtrsim 6$. Notably, the duration of the relativistic breakout becomes largely insensitive to the explosion energy and ejecta mass, typically exceeding analytical predictions by orders of magnitude and capable of producing a $\sim$200 s flash of MeV photons with a radiated energy of $\sim 7 \times 10^{49}$ erg for an energetic explosion yielding $\Gamma_{bo} \sim 6$.
#### Solar Surface Magnetic Field Simulation from 2010 to 2024 and Anomalous Southern Poleward Flux Transport in Cycle 24

 - **Abstract**
 The solar surface magnetic field is fundamental for modeling the coronal magnetic field, studying the solar dynamo, and predicting solar cycle strength. We perform a continuous simulation of the surface magnetic field from 2010 to 2024, covering solar cycle 24 and the ongoing cycle 25, using the surface flux transport model with assimilated observed active regions (ARs) as the source. The simulation reproduces the evolution of the axial dipole strength, polar field reversal timing, and magnetic butterfly diagram in good agreement with SDO/HMI observations. Notably, these results are achieved without incorporating radial diffusion or cyclic variations in meridional flow speed, suggesting their limited impact. Poleward surges of the following polarity typically dominate throughout the cycle, but in the southern hemisphere during cycle 24, they are limited to a short period from 2011 to 2016. This anomalous pattern arises from intermittent AR emergence, with about 46% of total unsigned flux contributed by ARs emerging during Carrington Rotations 2141-2160 (September 2013 - February 2015). These ARs show a strong active longitude at Carrington longitudes 200-260 degree and a weaker one at 80-100 degree. After 2016, poleward migrations of leading-polarity flux become dominant, despite most ARs following Joy's and Hale's laws. This reversal is likely due to prolonged intervals between AR emergences, which allow leading-polarity flux to distribute across a broad latitude range before cancellation by subsequent ARs. These findings highlight the importance of the temporal interval of AR emergence in driving the flux transport pattern.

 This is a summary of an invited talk given at the Moriond Gravitation meeting on March 31, 2025. I touch on some of the practical challenges of measuring the mass spectrum of merging binary black holes through their gravitational-wave signatures. I then describe my take on the current state of interpreting the observed binary black hole mass spectrum from the perspective of models for the formation of these sources. I conclude that meaningful progress must rely on the combination of gravitational-wave observations and a broad range of electromagnetic observations of massive stellar binaries at earlier stages of their evolution. This is my very personal and necessarily brief take on the current state of the field and does not aspire to the balance or completeness of a review.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we describe a general relativistic hydrodynamics simulation code which is developed to simulate advective accretion flow onto black holes. We are particularly interested in the accretion simulations of sub-Keplerian matter in the close vicinity of black holes. Due to the presence of centrifugal barrier, a nearly free-falling sub-Keplerian accretion flow slows down close to a black hole and can even pass through shocks before accelerating again to the black hole. We design our simulation code using the high resolution shock capturing scheme so that such shock structures can be captured and analyzed for relevance. In this paper, we describe our implementation and validation of the code against a few known analytical and numerical results of sub-Keplerian matter accretion.

 - **Abstract**
 Interstellar linear polarization occurs when starlight passes through elongated dust grains aligned by interstellar magnetic fields. The observed polarization can come from different dust structures along the line of sight (LOS). By combining polarization measurements with stellar distances, we can study the plane-of-sky Galactic magnetic field (GMF) between the observer and the star and separate the contributions of clouds with different GMF properties. We used optical and near-infrared (NIR) polarization data from three regions in the Galactic plane ($|b|<1^{\circ}$ and $19.\!\!^{\circ}8<l<25.\!\!^{\circ}5$) to perform a polarization decomposition across the Galactic arms. A comparison between optical and NIR data showed an optical-to-NIR polarization ratio of 2 to 3 along the LOS and a consistent polarization angle across both wavelengths in all studied regions, within measurement uncertainties. We applied the Bayesian Inference of Starlight Polarization in one dimension and the Gaussian Mixture Model methods to decompose the polarization in the three regions. Optical and NIR observations complemented each other, consistently identifying nearby ($d\lesssim143$ pc), intermediate ($0.47$ kpc $< d < 1.2$ kpc), and distant ($1.5$ kpc $< d < 2.5$ kpc) polarizing clouds, in agreement with previous findings in the Local Bubble wall, the Local arm, and the Sagittarius arm dust structures. The results from both polarization decomposition methods agree and complement each other. Polarization tomography revealed significant LOS variations in the plane-of-sky magnetic field orientation in two of the three regions. The relative alignment between the magnetic fields traced by starlight polarization and Planck's polarized thermal dust emission at 353 GHz reaffirmed these variations.

 - **Abstract**
 Atomic hydrogen (HI) dominates the mass of the cold interstellar medium, undergoing thermal condensation to form molecular gas and fuel star formation. Kinematically colder HI components, identified via kinematic decomposition of HI 21 cm data cubes, serve as a crucial transition phase between diffuse warm neutral gas and molecular hydrogen (H$_{2}$). We analyse these colder HI components by decomposing HI 21 cm data cubes of seven nearby galaxies - Sextans A, NGC 6822, WLM, NGC 5068, NGC 7793, NGC 1566, and NGC 5236 - spanning metallicities (0.1 < $Z/Z_{\odot}$ < 1.0) and physical scales (53-1134 pc). Using a velocity dispersion threshold of 6 km s$^{-1}$, we classify the kinematically distinct components into narrow (colder) and broad (warmer). Cross-correlation analysis between the narrow HI components and H$_{2}$ or star formation rate (SFR) surface density at different spatial scales reveals that dwarf galaxies exhibit the strongest correlation at ~500-700 pc. The radially binned narrow HI fraction, $f_{\rm n} = I_{\rm narrowHI}/I_{\rm totalHI}$, in dwarf galaxies shows no clear trend with metallicity or SFR, while in spirals, $f_{\rm n}$ is lower in inner regions with higher metallicity and SFR. We find that the dataset resolution significantly impacts the results, with higher physical resolution data yielding a higher median $f_{\rm n}$, $\langle f_{\rm n} \rangle$, per galaxy. With this considered, dwarf galaxies consistently exhibit a larger $f_{\rm n}$ than spiral galaxies. These findings highlight the critical role of cold HI in regulating star formation across different galactic environments and emphasise the need for high-resolution HI observations to further unravel the connection between atomic-to-molecular gas conversion and galaxy evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Measuring plasma parameters in the upper solar corona and inner heliosphere is challenging because of the region's weakly emissive nature and inaccessibility for most in situ observations. Radio imaging of broadened and distorted background astronomical radio sources during solar conjunction can provide unique constraints for the coronal material along the line of sight. In this study, we present radio spectral imaging observations of the Crab Nebula (Tau A) from June 9 to June 22, 2024 when it was near the Sun with a projected heliocentric distance of 5 to 27 solar radii, using the Owens Valley Radio Observatory's Long Wavelength Array (OVRO-LWA) at multiple frequencies in the 30--80 MHz range. The imaging data reveal frequency-dependent broadening and distortion effects caused by anisotropic wave propagation through the turbulent solar corona at different distances. We analyze the brightness, size, and anisotropy of the broadened images. Our results provide detailed observations showing that the eccentricity of the unresolved source increases as the line of sight approaches the Sun, suggesting a higher anisotropic ratio of the plasma turbulence closer to the Sun. In addition, the major axis of the elongated source is consistently oriented in the direction perpendicular to the radial direction, suggesting that the turbulence-induced scattering effect is more pronounced in the direction transverse to the coronal magnetic field. Lastly, when the source undergoes large-scale refraction as the line of sight passes through a streamer, the apparent source exhibits substructures at lower frequencies. This study demonstrates that observations of celestial radio sources with lines of sight near the Sun provide a promising method for measuring turbulence parameters in the inner heliosphere.

 - **Abstract**
 We perform axisymmetric general relativistic radiation-viscous hydrodynamics simulations of black hole (BH)-torus systems with full Boltzmann Monte-Carlo neutrino transport to investigate the role of neutrino-antineutrino pair annihilation in launching relativistic outflows. Our models span a wide range of BH spins, torus masses, and viscosity parameters. We find that the pair annihilation leads to the formation of relativistic fireballs in most cases, except for those with low black-hole spin and high viscosity. The isotropic-equivalent energies of these outflows reach $\lesssim 10^{51}\,{\rm erg}$ with durations $\lesssim 0.2\,{\rm s}$. While this is insufficient to explain the brightest short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs), our results suggest that the pair annihilation may account for some low-luminosity sGRBs and GRB precursors. We also provide updated scaling relations for the pair annihilation energy deposition rate as a function of accretion rate, and discuss the sensitivity of outflow properties to numerical resolution and floor density.

 - **Abstract**
 Refractory elements such as iron, magnesium, and silicon can be detected in the atmospheres of ultrahot giant planets. This provides an opportunity to quantify the amount of refractory material accreted during formation, along with volatile gases and ices. However, simultaneous detections of refractories and volatiles have proved challenging, as the most prominent spectral features of associated atoms and molecules span a broad wavelength range. Here, using a single JWST observation of the ultrahot giant planet WASP-121b, we report detections of H$_2$O (5.5-13.5$\sigma$), CO (10.8-12.8$\sigma$), and SiO (5.7-6.2$\sigma$) in the planet's dayside atmosphere, and CH$_4$ (3.1-5.1$\sigma$) in the nightside atmosphere. We measure super-stellar values for the atmospheric C/H, O/H, Si/H, and C/O ratios, which point to the joint importance of pebbles and planetesimals in giant planet formation. The CH$_4$-rich nightside composition is also indicative of dynamical processes, such as strong vertical mixing, having a profound influence on the chemistry of ultrahot giant planets.
#### Shape and ionization of equatorial matter near compact objects from X-ray polarization reflection signatures

 - **Abstract**
 Motivated by the success of the IXPE mission, we elucidate what can be inferred about 3D matter structures forming around the equatorial plane of accreting compact objects from 0.1-100 keV linear polarization induced by non-relativistic large-scale reflection. We construct a model of an optically thick elevated axially symmetric reflecting medium with arbitrary ionization profile, representing the known diverse scattering environments: from thick winds and super-Eddington funnel structures formed around black holes and neutron stars, to Compton-thick dusty tori of active galactic nuclei and their broad line regions. We assume a central X-ray power-law source with an isotropic, cosine, and slab-corona emission distribution, including intrinsic polarization. The reprocessing is based on constant-density local reflection tables produced with a Monte Carlo method combined with detailed non-LTE radiative transfer, although we also show examples with classical (semi-)analytical reflection prescriptions. We conclude that varying ionization has a similarly strong impact on observed polarization as the observer's inclination and the skew and opening angle of the reflector's inner walls, altogether producing up to tens of % of reflected polarization both parallelly or perpendicularly to the projected axis, depending on the parameter values combination. After testing 3 different ad-hoc shapes of the reflector: a cone, an elliptical torus, and a bowl, we conclude that while in some configurations, their altered curvature produces more than 30% absolute difference in observed total polarization, in others, the adopted shape has a marginal impact. Lastly, we discuss the change of the observed polarization due to releasing the optically thick assumption on equatorial winds and accreted matter, providing a continuous range of energy-dependent examples between the optically thick and thin scenarios.
