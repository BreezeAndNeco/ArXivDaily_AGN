#### The optical photometric variability of Herbig Ae/Be stars from TESS

 - **Abstract**
 We have carried out a photometric time domain study of 188 intermediate-mass young stars observed in Full Frame Image mode with the TESS satellite over the first 3.3 years of its mission. The majority of these targets are classified as Herbig Ae/Be stars (HAeBes). All were monitored at optical wavelengths for at least one 27-day TESS sector, with many having multiple sectors of data. From a custom aperture photometry pipeline, we produced light curves and analyzed the variability therein, as a function of stellar and circumstellar properties. Based on visual and statistical analysis, we find that ~95% of HAeBes are variable on timescales of 10 minutes to 1 month, with the most common light curve morphology being stochastic. Approximately 15% of the set display quasi-periodic variability. In comparison to sets of low-mass T Tauri stars monitored with optical space telescopes, the Herbig Ae/Be stars display a much lower incidence of ``dipper" behaviors (quasi-periodic or aperiodic fading events), as well as periodic modulations. As posited by previous work, we conclude that magnetic starspots are rare on HAeBes, and that the inner circumstellar dust rims of these objects lie at substantially larger radii than for low-mass young stars. Beyond these differences, the accretion dynamics of young stars less than ~7$M_\odot$ appear to be largely consistent based on their time domain properties from data streams of up to three months' duration. We do, however, find tentative evidence for a change in variability amplitude above this mass boundary, particularly for quasi-periodic behavior.

 - **Abstract**
 The Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the \emph{Fermi} Gamma-ray Space Telescope has been continuously providing good quality survey data of the entire sky in the high energy range from 30 MeV to 500 GeV and above since August 2008. A succession of gamma-ray source catalogs is published after a comprehensive analysis of the \emph{Fermi}--LAT data. The most recent release of data in the fourth \emph{Fermi}--LAT catalog of gamma-ray sources (4FGL-DR4), based on the first 14 years of observations in the energy band 50 MeV-1 TeV, contains 7195 sources. A large fraction ($\sim$ 33\%) of this population has no known counterparts in the lower wave bands. Such high energy gamma-ray sources are referred to as unassociated or unidentified. An appropriate classification of these objects into known type of gamma-ray sources such as the active galactic nuclei or pulsars is essential for population studies and pointed multi-wavelength observations to probe the radiative processes. In this work, we perform a detailed classification of the unassociated sources reported in the 4FGL-DR4 catalog using two supervised machine learning techniques-Random Forest and Extreme Gradient Boosting. We mainly focus on the identification of new gamma-ray pulsar candidates by making use of different observational features derived from the long-term observations with the \emph{Fermi}--LAT and reported in the incremental 4FGL-DR4 catalog. We also explore the effects of data balancing approach on the classification of the \emph{Fermi}--LAT unassociated sources.

 - **Abstract**
 Supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) formed in galaxy mergers are promising multi-messenger sources. They can be identified as quasars with periodic variability in electromagnetic (EM) time-domain surveys. The most massive of those systems can be detected by Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) in the nanohertz frequency gravitational-wave (GW) band. We present a method to simultaneously analyze EM lightcurves and PTA observations as a multi-messenger data stream. For this, we employ a joint likelihood analysis, in which the likelihood of the EM data and the PTA likelihood are multiplied. We test this approach by simulating 208 binary signals that can be detected both by the Rubin Observatory in the nominal ten-year survey and by a PTA dataset with a ~30-year baseline, which resembles our expectations for a dataset of the International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA) collaboration in ~2035. We compare our multi-messenger analysis with analyses that take into account the EM and PTA data separately. We find that the joint likelihood approach results in improved parameter estimation with smaller percent errors compared to the distinct analyses that consider only EM or PTA data separately. Among the SMBHB parameters, the binary total mass and the orbital inclination show the greatest improvement. We also compare our multi-messenger pipeline with an analysis, in which the EM constraints are used as priors to the PTA analysis. We demonstrate that the joint likelihood approach delivers tighter constraints on all binary parameters, with systematically higher values of Kullback-Leibler divergence, which measures the deviation of the posterior distribution from the prior.
#### Inferring cosmological parameters from galaxy and dark sirens cross-correlation

 - **Abstract**
 The number of observed gravitational wave (GW) events is growing fast thanks to rapidly improving detector sensitivities. GWs from compact binary coalescences like Black Holes or Neutron Stars behave like standard sirens and can be used as cosmological probes. To this aim, generally, the observation of an electromagnetic counterpart and the measurement of the redshift are needed. However, even when those are not available, it is still possible to exploit these "dark sirens" via statistical methods. In this work, we explore a method that exploits the information contained in the cross-correlation of samples of GW events with matter over-density tracers like galaxy catalogues. Contrary to other currently employed dark-sirens methods, this approach does not suffer from systematic errors related to the incompleteness of the galaxy catalogue. To further enhance the technique, we implement tomography in redshift space for the galaxy catalogue and luminosity distance space for the GWs. We simulate future data collected by the array of currently existing detectors, namely LIGO, Virgo, and Kagra, as well as planned third-generation ones such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorers. We cross-correlate these data with those from upcoming photometric galaxy surveys such as Euclid. We perform a sensitivity forecast employing a full-likelihood approach and explore the parameter space with Monte Carlo Markov Chains. We find that with this method, third-generation detectors will be able to determine the Hubble constant $H_0$ with an error of only 0.7%, which is enough to provide decisive information to shed light on the Hubble tension. Furthermore, for the other cosmological parameters, we find that the GWs and galaxy surveys information are highly complementary, and the use of both significantly improves the ability to constrain the underlying cosmology.
#### Neutrino signal from the hadron-quark phase transition in the conversion of Neutron Stars into Quark Stars

 - **Abstract**
 We calculate in a 1D General Relativistic (GR) hydrodynamic simulation the neutrino luminosity in an astrophysical scenario where a neutron star (NS) displays a hadron-quark phase transition (HQPT) into a Quark Star (QS). Deconfinement is triggered once the central density exceeds a critical threshold above $\sim 3n_0$ being $n_0$, saturation density. We use descriptions based on DD2 and the MIT Bag model equations of state (EOSs). We account for neutrinos using a microphysics forward emission model including $e^-e^+$ annihilation, plasmon decay, nucleon (N) modified (or direct) Urca processes, and $NN$ bremsstrahlung, and, for the post transition, the quark direct Urca and an opacity-based leakage scheme with GR redshift. We find that the neutrino light curve generically develops a short $\simeq$10-50 ms, spectrally harder feature near deconfinement, appearing as either a prompt shoulder or a distinct secondary peak. Heavy lepton neutrinos result in a delayed peak with respect to the previous. We identify three diagnostics that are only mildly degenerate with hadronic uncertainties: (i) an enhanced peak-to-plateau ratio $R_{\rm pp}$ sourced by latent-heat release, (ii) a characteristic lag $\Delta t$ between the collapse rise and the HQPT feature that tracks the central density trajectory, and (iii) a flavor hardening $\Delta\!\langle E_\nu\rangle$ driven by quark-matter phase space. After MSW flavor conversion, these signatures remain detectable with current experiments. For a Galactic event ($d\sim 10$ kpc), IceCube and Hyper-K should resolve the HQPT feature and distinguish it from both no transition NS collapse and canonical core-collapse supernova (CCSN) templates.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science Survey (CEERS) catalog, including space-based photometry, photometric redshifts, and physical parameters for more than 80,000 galaxies. The imaging used for this catalog comes from the CEERS survey, which has NIRCam coverage over ~100 sq. arcmin of the Extended Groth Strip (EGS) in seven filters from 1.15$\mu$m to 4.44$\mu$m. Alongside these data, we also include ancillary HST imaging in seven filters from 0.435$\mu$m to 1.6$\mu$m. We used Source Extractor with hot and cold detection settings to extract photometry. We derive photometric redshifts using the spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling code, LePHARE, and estimate their accuracy using spectroscopically confirmed galaxies out to $z\sim10$, with $\sigma_{NMAD}$ ranging from 0.035-0.073, depending strongly on galaxy magnitude and redshift. We compute stellar masses, star formation rates, and E(B-V) using three different SED fitting codes with different templates and assumptions about the galaxy star formation histories. All of these measurements, as well as the full mosaics in all filters, and redshift probability distribution functions, are made available via the CEERS DR1.0 data release.

 - **Abstract**
 El Gordo (ACT-CL J0102$-$4915) is a massive galaxy cluster with two major mass components at redshift $z=0.87$. Using SED fitting results from JWST/NIRCam photometry, the fraction of quenched galaxies in this cluster was measured in two bins of stellar mass: $9<\log{({M_*}/\mathrm{M}_{\odot})}<10$ and $10\leq\log{({M_*}/\mathrm{M}_{\odot})}<12$. While there is no correlation between the quenched fraction and angular separation from the cluster's overall center of mass, there is a correlation between the quenched fraction and angular separation from the center of the nearest of the two mass components for the less-massive galaxies. This suggests that environmental quenching processes are in place at $z\sim1$, and that dwarf galaxies are more affected by those processes than massive galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 The Event Horizon Telescope is preparing to produce time sequences of black hole images, or movies. In anticipation, we developed an autocorrelation technique to measure apparent rotational motion using the image-domain pattern speed $\Omega_p$. Here, we extend this technique to the visibility domain and introduce the visibility amplitude pattern speed $\Omega_{\mathrm{VA}}$. We show that in the Illinois v3 library of EHT source models, $\Omega_{\mathrm{VA}}$ depends on the source inclination, black hole mass, black hole spin, accretion state (MAD or SANE), and baseline length, and then provide approximate fits for this dependence. We show that $\Omega_{\mathrm{VA}}$ is particularly sensitive to baseline length for MAD (strongly magnetized) models, and that the slope of this dependence can be used to constrain black hole spin. As with $\Omega_p$, models predict that $\Omega_{\mathrm{VA}}$ is well below the Keplerian frequency in the emission region for all model parameters. This is consistent with the idea that $\Omega_{\mathrm{VA}}$ measures an angular phase speed for waves propagating through the emission region. Finally, we identify the information that would be provided by space-based millimeter VLBI such as the proposed BHEX mission.

 - **Abstract**
 The changing-look active galactic nucleus (CL-AGN), an extraordinary subpopulation of supermassive black holes, has attracted growing attention for understanding its nature. We present an analysis of the spectral properties of 203 low-redshift CL-AGNs ($z<0.35$) using two-epoch spectra from SDSS DR16 and DESI DR1 with time baseline ranging from $\sim$1000 to 8000 days, based on spectral fitting and decomposition. The sample consists of 11.3\% Type 1.0, 26.6\% Type 1.2, 43.1\% Type 1.5, and 19\% Type 1.8/2.0 AGNs. The total sample is divided into two datasets: Dataset A (110 objects) with minor spectral type variations, likely general AGN variability, and Dataset B (93 objects) showing significant type transitions and characteristic turn-on or turn-off behavior. Our results reveal clear optical continuum and emission-line variability, showing both bluer-when-brighter and redder-when-brighter trends. A strong correlation between the broad H$\beta$/[O~{\sc iii}] ratio and broad H$\alpha$ luminosity ($L_{\rm H\alpha}$), ${\rm log(H\beta/[O~III])}=(0.63\pm 0.07){\rm log}(L_{\rm H\alpha})-(26.49\pm2.96)\pm0.48$ for Dataset B, as well as the correlation between H$\beta$/[O~{\sc iii}] and Eddington ratio ($L_{\rm bol}/L_{\rm Edd}$), ${\rm log(H\beta/[O~III])}=(0.59\pm 0.08){\rm log}(L_{\rm bol}/L_{\rm Edd})+(1.02\pm0.15)\pm0.53$ for Dataset B, suggests that accretion rate variations drive changes in ionizing flux within the broad-line region, thereby triggering AGN type transitions. These findings underscore the critical role of supermassive black hole accretion processes in refining the AGN unification model. Future work should investigate potential connections between stellar evolution in outer accretion disk and the observed scatter in these correlations.

 - **Abstract**
 Young stars form in clusters within molecular clouds, but older stars are evenly distributed across the galactic disk, necessitating an explanation for cluster dissolution. We analytically study tidal forces from cold molecular clouds as a key mechanism for accelerated cluster disruption. Cloud tides, caused by the gravitational pull of the parent cloud along the radial direction, arise from the spatial gradient of gravitational acceleration and drive cluster disruption. This mechanism activates after gas expulsion and remains effective until the cloud is disrupted by stellar feedback or the cluster moves away. Cloud tides act on gas-deprived clusters, causing exponential expansion on a tidal timescale of $t_{\rm tidal,ext} = \sqrt{3/(8\pi G\rho_{\rm mean})}$, where $\rho_{\rm mean}$ is the cloud's density at the cluster's location. With a duration of a few Myr, cloud tides can lead to a 10 times increase of the cluster size, producing bar-like elongated stellar aggregations resembling Gaia strings. These results establish cloud tides as a potentially important mechanism for star cluster disruption.
#### A Sharper View of the X-ray Spectrum of MCG--6-30-15 with XRISM, XMM-Newton and NuSTAR

 - **Abstract**
 We present a time-averaged spectral analysis of the 2024 XRISM observation of the narrow-line Seyfert-1 galaxy MCG--6-30-15, taken contemporaneously with XMM-Newton and NuSTAR. Our analysis leverages a unique combination of broadband and high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy to definitively isolate and characterize both broad and narrow emission and absorption features in this source. The best-fitting model for the joint spectral analysis is very well described by reflection from the inner accretion disk illuminated by a compact corona, modified by multi-zone ionized absorption from an outflowing wind along the line of sight. The XRISM/Resolve data confirm that a strong, relativistically-broadened Fe K$\alpha$ emission line is required in order to obtain an adequate model fit. The Resolve data additionally verify the presence of a $v_{\rm out} \sim 2300$ km/s component of this outflowing wind, find tentative evidence for a $v_{\rm out} \sim 20,000$ km/s wind component, and indicate that the reflection from distant, neutral material may originate in a non-uniform structure rather than the traditional torus of AGN unification schemes. Though a rapid prograde black hole spin is statistically preferred by the best-fitting model, consistent with previous results, the AGN flux variability over the course of the observation complicates the interpretation of the time-averaged spectra. This insight, clarified by the combination of high signal-to-noise and high spectral resolution in the joint dataset, emphasizes the importance of time-resolved, high-resolution spectral analysis in unambiguously measuring the physical properties of variable AGN.

 - **Abstract**
 Linking solar wind properties to the activities and characteristics of its source regions can enhance our understanding of its origin and generation mechanisms. Using the Mount Wilson magnetic classification (MWMC), we categorize all active regions (ARs) between 1999 and 2020 into three groups: alpha, beta, and complex ARs. Subsequently, we classify the near-Earth AR solar wind into the corresponding three types based on the magnetic type of ARs. Our results show that alpha, beta, and complex ARs account for 19.99%, 66.67%, and 13.34% of all ARs, respectively, while their corresponding AR solar wind proportions are 16.96%, 45.18%, and 37.86%. The properties of solar wind from different types of ARs vary significantly. As the magnetic complexity of ARs increases, the corresponding AR solar wind exhibits higher magnetic field strength, charge states, helium abundance (A_He), and first ionization potential (FIP) bias. Our results demonstrate that complex ARs are more effective at generating solar wind. Additionally, the strong magnetic fields and frequent magnetic activities in complex ARs can heat the plasma to higher temperatures and effectively transport helium-rich materials from the lower atmosphere to the upper corona.
#### HST Confirms Sub-5 kpc Dual Quasar Pairs at Cosmic Noon

 - **Abstract**
 During cosmic noon ($z\sim1-3$), when both star formation and black hole growth peaked, galaxy mergers are predicted to trigger dual active galactic nuclei (AGN) that eventually coalesce as supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries. However, observations of dual quasars with sub-5 kpc separations-the critical phase preceding final coalescence-have remained elusive due to angular resolution limitations. We present the discovery and confirmation of two sub-arcsecond dual quasars at $z>1$, selected from 59,025 SDSS quasars, which fall within the footprint of the Hyper Suprime-Cam Survey. Using high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging and slitless spectroscopy, we confirmed SDSS J1625+4309 ($z=1.647$, separation 0.55"/4.7 kpc) and SDSS J0229$-$0514 ($z=3.174$, separation 0.42"/3.2 kpc), probing the sub-5 kpc separation regime. Through novel combination of WFC3/IR direct imaging (F140W) and grism spectroscopy (G141), we resolve both components morphologically and spectroscopically confirm their dual nature via detection of H$\beta$+[OIII] and MgII emission lines in each nucleus. Two-dimensional image decomposition reveals distinct host galaxy morphologies: J1625+4309 shows an extended, disturbed structure ($R_e$=4.7 kpc) indicative of an ongoing major merger, while J0229$-$0514 exhibits a compact host ($R_e$=1.4 kpc) suggesting an advanced coalescence stage. Black hole mass estimates based on virial relations yield M$_{\mathrm{BH}} \sim 10^{8.1}-10^{8.7} M_\odot$ with line-of-sight velocity offsets of $(0.7\pm0.1)\times10^{3}$ km s$^{-1}$ and $(1.0\pm0.2)\times10^{3}$ km s$^{-1}$, respectively. These confirmations directly constrain the frequency and properties of close dual quasars, opening new avenues for studying SMBH mergers at cosmic noon.

 - **Abstract**
 We perform 3 dimensional moving-mesh hydrodynamical simulations of bubble nebulae around ultraluminous X-ray sources, using state-of-the-art software AREPO. We use a Monte-Carlo method to inject outflows with uniform mass outflow rate and momentum, in a conical funnel with a specific half opening angle. Simulation results show that the morphology of the bubble is determined by the initial momentum of the outflows, while the mechanical power of the outflows only influences the size of the bubble without changing its shape. Low mechanical power also results in a short cooling timescale of the system, leading to an early collapse of the bubble shell. The half opening angle of the outflows and the viewing angle of the system determine the observed bubble eccentricity together. Compared with the observational morphology of the ULX bubble sources NGC 55 ULX-1 and NGC 1313 X-2, our simulation favors the fact that the high velocity outflows of the accretion disks in these two systems are confined in a narrow funnel region.

 - **Abstract**
 Low-frequency spectral studies of radio pulsars represent a key method for uncovering their emission mechanisms, magnetospheric structure, and signal interactions with the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM). In recent years, more next-generation low-frequency radio telescopes (e.g., LOFAR, LWA and MWA) have enriched the observational window below 350 MHz, enabling more detailed explorations of the ISM effects, such as absorption and scattering, resulting in diverse spectral behaviors observed across different pulsars. This paper reviews the morphology of pulsar radio spectra, advances in spectral modeling, and the key physical processes governing the low-frequency emission. Looking ahead, next-generation instruments such as SKA-Low - with their unprecedented sensitivity - are expected to resolve outstanding questions in pulsar emission processes, offering insights into the extreme physical regimes governing these exotic objects.

 - **Abstract**
 The KM3NeT collaboration has recently reported the detection of an extraordinary ultra-high-energy neutrino event with an energy of 220 PeV. Ultrahigh energy neutrinos and gamma-rays are co-produced in ultrahigh energy cosmic-ray interactions. The ultrahigh energy gamma-rays produced alongside the KM3NeT neutrino may quickly cascade down to lower energies due to interactions with intergalactic photons and magnetic fields. Because of this, the KM3NeT neutrino could be accompanied by an observable GeV - TeV gamma-ray signal. We investigate the data collected by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on-board the \textit{Fermi} Gamma-ray Space Telescope for transient and sub-threshold gamma-ray sources in the vicinity of the KM3NeT neutrino. We find three sub-threshold sources with TS $\gtrsim 16$ within $3.5^{\circ}$ of the neutrino event not included in any existing \textit{Fermi}-LAT catalogs. One of the three, J0616.1-0428, is a transient sub-threshold gamma-ray source that appears only after the neutrino observation, but may be the unrelated flaring of a nearby microquasar. Another sub-threshold source, J0621.1-0610, also exhibits fluctuations in gamma-rays immediately following the neutrino observation, and may be coincident with a radio blazar. We note that the number of sub-threshold sources observed around the KM3NeT neutrino could be expected at another sky region of the same Galactic latitude, and that the fluctuations they exhibit appear to be consistent with background.

 - **Abstract**
 As the statistical precision of cosmological measurements increases, the accuracy of the theoretical description of these measurements needs to increase correspondingly in order to infer the underlying cosmology that governs the Universe. To this end, we have created the Cosmology Likelihood for Observables in Euclid (CLOE), which is a novel cosmological parameter inference pipeline developed within the Euclid Consortium to translate measurements and covariances into cosmological parameter constraints. In this first in a series of six papers, we describe the theoretical recipe of this code for the Euclid primary probes. These probes are composed of the photometric 3x2pt observables of cosmic shear, galaxy-galaxy lensing, and galaxy clustering, along with spectroscopic galaxy clustering. We provide this description in both Fourier and configuration space for standard and extended summary statistics, including the wide range of systematic uncertainties that affect them. This includes systematic uncertainties such as intrinsic galaxy alignments, baryonic feedback, photometric and spectroscopic redshift uncertainties, shear calibration uncertainties, sample impurities, photometric and spectroscopic galaxy biases, as well as magnification bias. The theoretical descriptions are further able to accommodate both Gaussian and non-Gaussian likelihoods and extended cosmologies with non-zero curvature, massive neutrinos, evolving dark energy, and simple forms of modified gravity. These theoretical descriptions that underpin CLOE will form a crucial component in revealing the true nature of the Universe with next-generation cosmological surveys such as Euclid.

 - **Abstract**
 The activity of Sun-like stars is governed by the magnetic field, which is believed to be generated in a thin layer between convective and radiative envelopes. The dynamo layer, also called the tachocline, permits the existence of Rossby waves (r-modes) described by magnetohydrodynamic shallow water models, which may lead to short-term cycles in stellar activity. Convective cells penetrate into the layer creating an overshoot upper part, where they transport an additional energy for vigorous activity. The aim of this paper is to study the influence of overshooting convection on the dynamics of Rossby waves in the tachoclines of Sun-like stars. Here we write the magnetohydrodynamic shallow water equations with the effect of the penetrative convection and study the dynamics of wave modes in the layer. The formalism leads to the excitation of new oscillation modes connected with the dynamo coefficient, alpha, causing periodic modulations of all parameters in the tachocline. The modes are coupled with the Rossby waves resulting mutual exchange of convective and rotation energies. The timescales of Rossby-dynamo waves, for certain parameters, correspond to Schwabe (11 years) and Rieger (150-170 days) cycles as observed in solar activity. The waves provide a new paradigm for internal magnetism and may drive the dynamos of Sun-like stars. Theoretical properties of the waves and observations can be used for magneto-seismological sounding of stellar interiors.

 - **Abstract**
 Euclid is expected to establish new state-of-the-art constraints on extensions beyond the standard LCDM cosmological model by measuring the positions and shapes of billions of galaxies. Specifically, its goal is to shed light on the nature of dark matter and dark energy. Achieving this requires developing and validating advanced statistical tools and theoretical prediction software capable of testing extensions of the LCDM model. In this work, we describe how the Euclid likelihood pipeline, Cosmology Likelihood for Observables in Euclid (CLOE), has been extended to accommodate alternative cosmological models and to refine the theoretical modelling of Euclid primary probes. In particular, we detail modifications made to CLOE to incorporate the magnification bias term into the spectroscopic two-point correlation function of galaxy clustering. Additionally, we explain the adaptations made to CLOE's implementation of Euclid primary photometric probes to account for massive neutrinos and modified gravity extensions. Finally, we present the validation of these CLOE modifications through dedicated forecasts on synthetic Euclid-like data by sampling the full posterior distribution and comparing with the results of previous literature. In conclusion, we have identified in this work several functionalities with regards to beyond-LCDM modelling that could be further improved within CLOE, and outline potential research directions to enhance pipeline efficiency and flexibility through novel inference and machine learning techniques.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Determining the orbital periods of cataclysmic variable stars (CVs) is essential for confirming candidates and for the understanding of their evolutionary state. The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) provides month-long photometric data across nearly the entire sky that can be used to search for periodic variability in such systems. Aims. This study aims to identify and confirm the orbital periods for members of a recent compilation of magnetic CVs (known as polars) using TESS light curves. In addition, we set out to investigate their reliability, and hence the relevance of TESS for variability studies of CVs. Results. Ninety-five of the 217 polars in our sample have pipeline-produced TESS two-minute cadence light curves available. The results from our period search are overall in good agreement with the previously reported values. Out of the 95 analysed systems, 85 exhibit periods consistent with the literature values. Among the remaining ten objects, four are asynchronous polars, where TESS light curves resolve the orbital period, the white dwarf's spin period, and additional beat frequencies. For four systems, the periods detected from the TESS data differ from those previously reported. For two systems, a period detection was not possible. Our analysis of the flattened TESS light curves reveals a positive correlation between noise levels and TESS magnitude. Our noise level estimates resemble the rmsCDPP, a measure of white noise provided with the TESS pipeline products. However, our values for the noise level are systematically higher than the rmsCDPP indicating red noise and high-frequency signals hidden in the flattened light curves. Additionally, we present a statistical methodology to assess the reliability of period detections in TESS light curves. We find that for TESS magnitudes $\gtrsim$ 17, period detections become increasingly unreliable.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the age and metallicity dependence of the absolute magnitude and colour of red clump (RC) stars is crucial for validating the accuracy of stellar evolution models and enhancing their reliability as a standard candle. However, this dependence has previously been investigated in the near-infrared across multiple bands only for -1.05 $\leq$ [Fe/H] $\leq$ 0.40, a range accessible through the star clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Therefore, we used star clusters in the Small Magellanic Cloud and the Milky Way Galaxy to investigate the age and metallicity dependence of the absolute magnitude and colour of RC stars in the near-infrared for a broader parameter space (0.45 $\leq$ Age (Gyr) $\leq$ 10.5, -1.65 $\leq$ [Fe/H] $\leq$ 0.32). Comparison of our results with three isochronous models BaSTI, PARSEC, and MIST reveals that the age dependence of the absolute magnitude for young RC stars aligns well with theoretical predictions, within the fitting errors of the multiple regression analysis. Additionally, the observed colour shows good agreement with the theoretical models. Notably, the $J - K_{S}$ colour, which spans a wide parameter space, reproduces the distribution expected from the theoretical model.

 - **Abstract**
 We study stochastic effects in viable ultra-slow-roll inflation models that produce primordial black holes. We consider asteroid, solar, and supermassive black hole seed masses. In each case, we simulate $10^8$ patches of the universe that may collapse into PBHs. In every patch, we follow $4\times10^4$ momentum shells to construct its spherically symmetric profile from first principles, without introducing a window function. We include the effects of critical collapse and the radiation era transfer function. The resulting compaction function profiles are very spiky due to stochastic kicks. This can enhance the PBH abundance by up to 36 orders of magnitude, depending on the mass range and collapse criterion. The PBH mass function shifts to higher masses and widens significantly. These changes may have a large effect on observational constraints of PBHs and make it possible to generate PBHs with a smaller amplitude of the power spectrum. However, convergence issues for the mass function remain. The results call for redoing collapse simulations to determine the collapse criterion for spiky profiles.

 - **Abstract**
 Star formation in galaxies is a complex phenomenon occurring on a very wide range of scales, and molecular clouds are at the heart of this process. The formation of these structures and the subsequent collapse of the gas within them to form new stars remain unresolved scientific questions. In particular, the role and importance of gravity at between the disk scale height and prestellar cores (100 to 0.01 pc) are still topics of debate. In this work, we conduct a case study examining the mass assembly and evolution of a giant molecular cloud complex in a numerical stratified-box simulation of the interstellar medium with photo-ionizing and supernova driving and resolving down to scales $\gtrsim 1$ pc and densities up to $10^3$ cm$^{-3}$. By introducing tracer particles to precisely track the forces acting on the gas during its evolution towards and within the clouds, we are able to quantify how much of the mass inflow is driven by the self-gravity of the gas and the gravity from the stellar disk. We find that up to 20% of the gas is gravity-driven at a scale of 100 pc, contributing 10% of the inflow from the warm to the cold phase and 20% from the cold phase to the individual molecular clouds, reaching up to 45% inside the molecular gas, at densities $\gtrsim 400$ cm$^{-3}$. However, at the 100 pc scale, the contribution of gravity-driven gas on the linewidth is negligible. We conclude that the bulk of the gas motions assembling the clouds in our simulation are caused by the supernova-driven supersonic turbulence, which results in locally convergent flows, with a small contribution from the stellar gravitational potential.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Current large-scale, high-cadence surveys, such as the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), provide detections of new and rare types of transients and supernovae whose physical origins are not well understood. Aims. We investigate the nature of SN 2021lwz at a redshift z=0.065, an overluminous supernova (SN) of absolute magnitude, $M_{g} \sim -20.1$ AB, falling in the lower range of superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) luminosities, and discovered in a faint dwarf galaxy with an absolute magnitude of $M_{g} \simeq -14.5$ AB. Methods. SN 2021lwz is studied using optical spectroscopy, photometry and imaging linear polarimetry obtained during several follow-up campaigns. All the data are used to analyse and model the evolution of the explosion. Comparisons with other SNe of well known or rarer types are investigated. Results. SN 2021lwz belongs to the rare class of rapidly evolving transients. The bolometric light curve rises in about 7 days to a peak luminosity of about 5 x10^{43} erg/s, at a rate of 0.2 mag/day close to the peak. Spectroscopy modeling reveals more similarities with a normal Type Ic-like SN than with a SLSN before peak, showing broadened lines after peak. Light curve modeling shows that the Arnett model of the bolometric light curve using a radioactive source ($^{56}$ Ni) is not able to reasonably explain the light curve evolution. A magnetar model seems more appropriate, suggesting that the explosion of low ejecta mass ($M_{\rm ej} \sim 0.24 ~M_\odot$) took place in a low mass ($M \sim 10^{6.66}~M_\odot$) dwarf galaxy of specific star-formation rate about ten times larger than typical star-forming galaxies. Conclusions. Given its spectroscopic properties and the low ejecta mass needed to model its light-curve, SN 2021lwz does not match with many core-collapse H-poor SNe Types. It shares similarities with rarer transients like SN 2014ft, iPTF 16asu and SN 2018gep.

 - **Abstract**
 Dynamically cold stellar streams from tidally dissolved globular clusters (GCs) serve as excellent tools to measure the Galactic mass distribution and show promise to probe the nature of dark matter. For successful application of these tools to observations, it is essential to have an accurate model of stellar stream properties on the Galactic scale. To this end we produce a mock catalog of stellar streams in four simulated Milky Way-like galaxies. We build the catalog with three main components: a model for the formation and disruption of globular clusters based on cosmological simulations, time-dependent potentials constructed with basis function expansions for integrating stream orbits, and an improved particle spray algorithm for efficient generation of stellar streams. We find that the observable widths and lengths of mock streams as a function of galactocentric radius are well described by power-laws for streams beyond 10 kpc. We generate mock photometry for Gaia, LSST, and Roman, and find that the latter two surveys will increase the number of observable stars in GC stellar streams by several orders of magnitude. Our full catalog, containing stream populations across four different galaxy realizations, is publicly available and can be used to study stream population statistics and to calibrate models which use stellar streams to understand our Galaxy.
