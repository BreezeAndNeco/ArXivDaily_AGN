 - **Abstract**
 We present extensive ultraviolet (UV), optical, and near-infrared (NIR) photometric and spectroscopic observations of the nearby hydrogen-poor superluminous supernova (SLSN-I) SN2024rmj at z = 0.1189. SN 2024rmj reached a peak absolute magnitude of Mg $\approx$ -21.9, placing it at the luminous end of the SLSN-I distribution. The light curve exhibits a pronounced pre-peak bump ($\approx$ 60 d before the main peak) and a post-peak bump ($\approx$ 55 d after the main peak). The bulk of the light curve is otherwise well fit by a magnetar spin-down model, with typical values (spin: $\approx$ 2.1 ms; magnetic field: $\approx$ 6 $\times$ 10$^{13}$ G; ejecta mass: $\approx$ 12 M$_\odot$). The optical spectra exhibit characteristic SLSN-I features and evolution, but with a relatively high velocity of $\approx$ 8,000 km s$^{-1}$ post-peak. Most significantly, we find a clear detection of helium in the NIR spectra at He I $\lambda$1.083 $\mu$m and $\lambda$2.058 $\mu$m, blueshifted by $\approx$ 15,000 km s$^{-1}$ (13 d before peak) and $\approx$ 13,000 km s$^{-1}$ (40 d after peak), indicating that helium is confined to the outermost ejecta; based on these NIR detections, we also identify likely contribution from He I $\lambda$5876 Å in the optical spectra on a similar range of timescales. This represents the most definitive detection of helium in a bright SLSN-I to date, and indicates that progenitors with a thin helium layer can still explode as SLSNe.

 - **Abstract**
 MeerKAT observations of the recently discovered, extremely low mass galaxy, Pavo, have revealed a neutral gas (HI) reservoir that was undetected in archival HI single dish data. Based on the latest distance measurement ($2.16^{+0.08}_{-0.07}$ Mpc), we measure Pavo's HI mass as $\log M_\mathrm{HI}/\mathrm{M_\odot} = 5.79 \pm 0.05$, making it the lowest mass HI reservoir currently known in an isolated galaxy (with a robust distance measurement). Despite Pavo's extreme isolation, with no known neighbor within over 700 kpc, its HI reservoir is highly disturbed. It does not show clear signs of rotation and its center of mass is offset from the stellar body center by 320 pc, while its peak is offset by 82 pc (both in projection). Despite this disturbed morphology, Pavo still appears to be consistent with the HI size--mass relation, although it is not possible to accurately determine a suitable inclination correction. Such disturbed, offset and disorganized HI reservoirs are predicted by simulations of low-mass, star-forming dwarfs in which supernova-driven outflows efficiently disrupt the interstellar medium after a star formation event. It is likely that we are witnessing Pavo in precisely this period, tens to a few hundred Myr after a star formation episode, when internal feedback has disrupted its gas reservoir.
#### Distinct origins of environmentally quenched galaxies in the core and outer virialised regions of massive clusters at $0.8<z<1.5$

 - **Abstract**
 High-redshift ($z\sim1$) galaxy clusters are the domain where environmental quenching mechanisms are expected to emerge as important factors in the evolution of the quiescent galaxy population. Uncovering these initially subtle effects requires exploring multiple dependencies of quenching across the cluster environment, and through time. We analyse the stellar-mass functions (SMFs) of 17 galaxy clusters within the GOGREEN and GCLASS surveys between $0.8<z<1.5$, and with $\log{(M/{\rm{M_\odot}})}>9.5$. The data are fit simultaneously with a Bayesian model that allows the Schechter function parameters of the quiescent and star-forming populations to vary smoothly with cluster-centric radius and redshift. The model also fits the radial galaxy number density profile of each population, allowing the global quenched fraction to be parameterised as a function of redshift and cluster velocity dispersion. We find the star-forming SMF to not depend on radius or redshift. For the quiescent population however, there is $\sim2\sigma$ evidence for a radial dependence. Outside the cluster core ($R>0.3\,R_{\rm200}$), the quenched fraction above $\log{(M/{\rm{M_\odot}})}=9.5$ is $\sim40{\rm\;per\,cent}$, and the quiescent SMF is similar in shape to the star-forming field. In contrast, the cluster core has an elevated quenched fraction ($\sim70{\rm\;per\,cent}$), and a quiescent SMF similar in shape to the quiescent field population. We explore contributions of 'early mass-quenching' and mass-independent 'environmental-quenching' models in each of these radial regimes. The core is well-described primarily by early mass-quenching, which we interpret as accelerated quenching of massive galaxies in protoclusters, possibly through merger-driven feedback mechanisms. The non-core is better described through mass-independent, environmental-quenching of the infalling field population.
#### Multi-band, Multi-epoch Photometry of the Spot-crossing System TOI-3884: Refined System Geometry and Spot Properties

 - **Abstract**
 Spot-crossing transits offer a unique opportunity to probe spot properties such as temperature, size, and surface distribution. TOI-3884 is a rare system in which spot-crossing features are persistently observed during every transit. This is due to its unusual configuration: a polar-orbiting super-Neptune transits a pole-on mid-M dwarf, repeatedly crossing a polar spot. However, previous studies have reported discrepant values in key system parameters, such as stellar inclination and obliquity. To address this, we conducted multi-band, multi-epoch transit observations of TOI-3884b using the MuSCAT instrument series, along with photometric monitoring with the LCO 1m telescopes/Sinistro. We detected time-dependent variations in the spot-crossing signals, indicating that the spot is not exactly on the pole. From the monitoring data, we measured a stellar rotation period of $11.043_{-0.053}^{+0.054}$ days with a modulation amplitude of $\sim$5% in the r-band, consistent with the time variability in the spot-crossing features. Our analysis reconciles previous discrepancies and improves the constraints on the parameters of the system geometry ($i_\star = 40.1^{+2.0}_{-1.2}$ deg and $\lambda =139.0^{+9.0}_{-3.7}$ deg) and those of the spot properties (spot radius of $0.425_{-0.011}^{+0.018} R_\star$ and spot-photosphere temperature difference of $200_{-9}^{+11}$ K). These results provide a critical context for interpreting upcoming transmission spectroscopy of TOI-3884b, as well as yielding new insights into the magnetic activity and spin-orbit geometry of M dwarfs.

 - **Abstract**
 We present deep optical and near-infrared observations of the host galaxies of 34 fast radio bursts (FRBs) detected by the Commensal Real-time ASKAP Fast Transient (CRAFT) survey on the Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) to compare the locations of FRBs relative to their host light distributions. Incorporating three additional FRBs from the literature, for a total of four repeating and 33 apparently non-repeating FRBs, we determine their projected galactocentric offsets and find a median of $ 4.2^{+5.7}_{-2.5}$ kpc ($1.0^{+1.5}_{-0.6}r_e$). We model their host surface brightness profiles and develop synthetic spatial distributions of their globular clusters based on host properties. We calculate the likelihood the observed location of each FRB is consistent with the smooth light of its host galaxy, residual (primarily spiral) substructure, or globular cluster distributions. The majority of FRBs favor locations within the disks of their galaxies, while only 7-13\% favor a globular cluster origin, primarily those with galactocentric offsets $\gtrsim3r_e$. At $z<0.15$, where spiral structure is apparent in 86\% of our sample of FRB hosts, we find $\approx 20-46\%$ of FRBs favor an association with spiral arms. Assuming FRBs derive from magnetars, our results support multiple formation channels with the majority of progenitors associated with massive stars and a minority formed through dynamical channels. However, the moderate fraction of FRBs associated with spiral structure indicates that high star formation efficiency of the youngest and most massive stars is not a predominant driver in the production of FRB progenitors.

 - **Abstract**
 Reverberation mapping (RM) can measure black hole accretion disc sizes and radial structure through observed time lags that should increase with wavelength as $\tau\propto\lambda^{4/3}$. Our 250-day RM campaign on NGC 7469 combines sub-day cadence 7-band photometry from the Las Cumbres Observatory robotic telescopes and weekly X-ray and UVOT data from Swift. By fitting these light curves, we measure the spectral energy distribution of the variable accretion disc and inter-band lags of just 1.5 days across the UV to the optical range. The disc SED is close to the expected $f_\nu\propto\nu^{1/3}$, and the lags are consistent with $\tau\propto \lambda^{4/3}$, but three times larger than expected. We consider several possible modifications to standard disc assumptions. First, for a $9\times10^6$ M$_\odot$ black hole and 2 possible spins $a^\star=(0,1)$, we fit the X-ray-UV-optical SED with a compact relativistic corona at height $H_x=(46,27)R_g$ irradiating a flat disc with accretion rate $\dot{m}_{Edd}\sim(0.23,0.24)$ inclined to the line of sight by $i<20^\circ$. To fit the lags as well as the SED, this model requires a low spin $a^\star=0$ and boosts disc color temperatures by a factor $f_{col}=1.8$, which shifts reprocessed light to shorter wavelengths. Our Bowl model with $f_{col}=1$ neglects relativity near the black hole but fits the UV-optical lags and SEDs using a flat disc with $\dot{m}_{Edd}<0.06$ and a steep outer rim at $R_{out}/c\sim5-10$ days with H/R<1%. This rim occurs near the $10^3$K dust sublimation temperature in the disc atmosphere, supporting models that invoke dust opacity to thicken the disc and launch failed radiatively-driven dusty outflows at the inner edge of the broad line region (BLR). Finally, the disc lags and SEDs exhibit a significant excess in the $u$ and $r$ bands, suggesting the Balmer continuum and H$\alpha$ emission, respectively, from the BLR.

 - **Abstract**
 A novel fine spectral structure in solar radio bursts has been discovered using the Chashan broadband solar radio spectrometer at meter wavelengths (CBSm), an instrument of the Chinese Meridian Project-Phase II (CMP-II). The structure features periodic narrow-band stripes with a typical recurrence time $< 1 $ s (occasionally reaches 8 s), often drifting from high to low frequencies and accompanied by absorptions, with trailing stripes appearing at the end of preceding ones. Some stripes exhibit periodic beaded enhancements with a periodicity of $\sim$0.1 s. The beaded stripes are reported for the first time ever. Data from the DAocheng Radio Telescope (DART) indicate a radio emission brightness temperature exceeding $10^{9}$ K, originating above brightening loops in active region AR 13664. We proposed a novel generation mechanism of the periodic stripes on the basis of the double plasma resonance (DPR) instability, and explained the beaded substructure in terms of modulation by low-frequency magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves. The study highlights the CBSm's capability to detect high-resolution fine spectral structures and offers novel insights into the emission mechanism and source characteristics of solar radio bursts.
#### GNHeII J1236+6215: A He II $λ$1640 emitting and potentially LyC leaking galaxy at $z$ = 2.9803 unveiled through JWST & Keck observations

 - **Abstract**
 He II $\lambda$1640 emission in galaxies indicates the presence of sources that produce extreme ionizing photons. Here, we report the discovery of a He II $\lambda$1640 emitting galaxy, GNHeII J1236+6215, at $z=$ 2.9803 in the GOODS-north field. We use photometry in 17 wavebands from near-UV to infrared to characterize the galaxy SED and combine Keck LRIS and JWST NIRSpec spectra to identify 15 emission lines including He II $\lambda$1640. We infer that the He$^+$ ionization in the galaxy could be driven by small pockets of young Population III stars or low-metallicity Very Massive Stars (VMSs) rather than AGN or metal-rich Wolf-Rayet stars. The galaxy has a highly ionized ISM ([OIII]5007/[OII]3727 = 7.28$\pm$0.11, [SIII]/[SII] = 1.97$\pm$0.48 and detected Ly$\alpha$, H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, H$\gamma$ lines), little reddening by dust (E(B$-$V) = 0.04$\pm$0.12), low metallicity (12 + log(O/H) = 7.85$\pm$0.22), and high star formation rate (SFR$_{\rm SED}$ = 12.2$\pm$2.0 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$). In addition to these ISM conditions, we also notice a significant [SII] deficiency ([SII]6718,6732/H$\alpha$ = 0.08$\pm$0.02, $\Delta$[SII] = $-$0.12) which may indicate the presence of density-bounded optically thin H~II regions that combined with the low dust extinction favor leaking of ionizing Lyman continuum (LyC) photons. Our best-fit SED model also infers a high nebular ionization (log U = $-2.0$) and a low stellar mass M = 7.8$\pm3.1\times$10$^8$M$_{\odot}$. This discovery not only adds one important object to the known sample of high-redshift He~II emitters but also highlights a potential connection between He$^+$ ionization and favorable ISM conditions for the leakage of ionizing photons from galaxies.
#### Results from the Pan-STARRS Search for Kilonovae: Contamination by Massive Stellar Outbursts

 - **Abstract**
 We present results from the Pan-STARRS optical search for kilonovae without the aid of gravitational wave and gamma-ray burst triggers. The search was conducted from 26 October 2019 to 15 December 2022. During this time, we reported 29,740 transients observed by Pan-STARRS to the IAU Transient Name Server. Of these, 175 were Pan-STARRS credited discoveries that had a host galaxy within 200 Mpc and had discovery absolute magnitudes M > -16.5. A subset of 11 transients was plausibly identified as kilonova candidates by our kilonova prediction algorithm. Through a combination of historical forced photometry, extensive follow-up, and aggregating observations from multiple sky surveys, we eliminated all as kilonova candidates. Rapidly evolving outbursts from massive stars (likely to be Luminous Blue Variable eruptions) accounted for 55% of the subset's contaminating sources. We estimate the rate of such eruptions using the ATLAS 100 Mpc volume-limited survey data. As these outbursts appear to be significant contaminants in kilonova searches, we estimate contaminating numbers when searching gravitational wave skymaps produced by the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra science collaboration during the Rubin era. The Legacy Survey of Space and time, reaching limiting magnitudes of m = 25, could detect 2-6 massive stellar outbursts per 500 deg^2 within a 4-day observing window, within the skymaps and volumes typical for binary neutron star mergers projected for Ligo-Virgo-Kagra Observing run 5. We conclude that while they may be a contaminant, they can be photometrically identified.

 - **Abstract**
 The profiles of broad emission lines in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) provide critical insights into the geometry and kinematics of the broad-line region (BLR), which in turn influence the uncertainties in estimating the masses of central supermassive black holes. In this study, we report the discovery of a low-luminosity AGN, SDSS J1609+4902, in which the H$\alpha$ line exhibits two distinct BLR components: a Gaussian component and an extremely broad double-peaked component. Follow-up observations conducted at the Lijiang Observatory in 2025 reveal that the line profile remains roughly unchanged, suggesting that this BLR structure may remain stable over a timescale of $\sim$10 years. We find that the size of the central Gaussian (Full Width at Half Maximum, FWHM$\sim 3000\,{\rm km\, s^{-1}}$) component is consistent with the classical reverberation mapping correlation. In contrast, the asymmetric double-peaked wing (FWHM$\sim 23,000\,{\rm km\, s^{-1}}$) likely originates from a disk-like BLR with an inner radius of approximately 70 gravitational radii. These results provide new constraints on the structure and dynamics of BLRs in AGNs and highlight the potential for long-term stability in such systems.
#### A Spectral Energy Distribution Variability Study of the Eclipsing AGN NGC 6814

 - **Abstract**
 The local Seyfert 1.5 active galactic nucleus (AGN), NGC 6814, is known to exhibit complex variability, eclipses, and even changing-look behaviour. In this work, we utilize optical-to-X-ray data obtained over 10-years with the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory to examine the short-term (i.e. daily) and long-term (yearly) variations in the spectral energy distribution (SED). This includes three epochs of high-cadence monitoring (2012, 2016, and 2022), as well as two single observations (2019 and 2021). Model-independent methods of examining the variability suggest that the three monitored epochs exhibit distinct behaviour. X-ray weakness in 2016 can be attributed to the previously studied eclipses, while similar behaviour in 2012 is associated with continuum changes and slight neutral absorption. The multi-epoch SED models are consistent with a black hole (log (MBH / Msun) ~7.6) that is accreting between 0.01-0.1 of the Eddington rate. While the corona (primary X-ray source) is compact, all epochs are better fit with an accretion disk inner radius that is much larger than the innermost stable circular orbit, implying the possibility of a non-standard accretion disk or central structure in NGC 6814.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.07260

 - **Abstract**
 HD 213985 is an eccentric binary system with a post-AGB primary and a jet-launching secondary star. We confirm that the system photometric variability is likely due to obscuration by the inner edge of a circumbinary disc, similar to RVb-type RV Tau stars. The system has shown an increase in the orbital variability amplitude in optical photometric bands, along with irregular changes in its shape that often started to appear skewed. Variability in the Na D lines suggests that this behaviour may be driven by interactions between the circumbinary disc and outflows through the L2 Lagrange point. Moreover, HD 213985 has exhibited episodes of short-term fluctuations whose appearance is not strictly related to the orbital phase. This variability is consistent with obscuration by transient dust structure leading to weather-like variability patterns.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on XRISM/Resolve spectroscopy of the recurrent transient and well-known black hole candidate 4U 1630$-$472 during its 2024 outburst. The source was captured at the end of a disk-dominated high/soft state, at an Eddington fraction of $\lambda_\mathrm{Edd} \sim 0.05~(10 M_{\odot}/M_\mathrm{BH})$. A variable absorption spectrum with unprecedented complexity is revealed with the Resolve calorimeter. This marks one of the lowest Eddington fractions at which highly ionized absorption has been detected in an X-ray binary. The strongest lines are fully resolved, with He-like Fe XXV separated into resonance and intercombination components, and H-like Fe XXVI seen as a spin-orbit doublet. The depth of some absorption lines varied by almost an order of magnitude, far more than expected based on a 10% variation in apparent X-ray flux and ionization parameter. The velocity of some absorption components also changed significantly. Jointly modeling two flux segments with a consistent model including four photoionization zones, the spectrum can be described in terms of highly ionized but likely failed winds that sometimes show red-shifts, variable obscuration that may signal asymmetric structures in the middle and outer accretion disk, and a tentative very fast outflow ($v = 0.026-0.033c$). We discuss the impact of these findings on our understanding of accretion and winds in stellar-mass black holes, and potential consequences for future studies.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of the splashback radius ($R_{\text{sp}}$) and the associated splashback mass ($M_{\text{sp}}$) for a sample of galaxy clusters using SDSS spectroscopic data and mock simulations. $R_{\text{sp}}$ marks a physical boundary between the virialized core and the outer infall regions of clusters, providing a robust measure of cluster mass accretion history without being affected by pseudo-evolution. We model the cumulative galaxy number profile of clusters, testing different halo density models and considering the impact of cluster properties, such as center definitions, magnitude limits, galaxy colors, and field contamination, on the estimation of splashback features. Our results show that observed splashback radii, measured in projection (2D), are consistently smaller than predicted by dark matter simulations, with $R_\text{sp}/R_{200m} \approx 1$, supporting previous discrepancies in the literature. We also explore the relationship between $M_{\text{sp}}$ and $R_{\text{sp}}$, proposing a new scaling relation for future cosmological studies, as $R_{\text{sp}}$ is easily observable. Our findings indicate that splashback masses strongly correlate with radii, with a dispersion of $\approx 0.15$ dex, competitive with other mass-observable relations. However, the fitted relation diverges from the constant density expectations of galaxy clusters around $R_\text{sp}$. Additionally, the $M_{\text{sp}} \textendash R_{\text{sp}}$ relation shows significant redshift evolution, though the predominantly low-redshift range of our sample limits our ability to confirm this trend conclusively. The approach developed here may play a key role in cluster characterization and cosmology in the era of large galaxy surveys.

 We present a joint analysis of weak gravitational lensing (shear) data obtained from the first three years of observations by the Dark Energy Survey and thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect measurements from a combination of Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and Planck data. A combined analysis of shear (which traces the projected mass) with the tSZ effect (which traces the projected gas pressure) can jointly probe both the distribution of matter and the thermodynamic state of the gas, accounting for the correlated effects of baryonic feedback on both observables. We detect the shear$~\times~$tSZ cross-correlation at a 21$\sigma$ significance, the highest to date, after minimizing the bias from cosmic infrared background leakage in the tSZ map. By jointly modeling the small-scale shear auto-correlation and the shear$~\times~$tSZ cross-correlation, we obtain $S_8 = 0.811^{+0.015}_{-0.012}$ and $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.263^{+0.023}_{-0.030}$, results consistent with primary CMB analyses from Planck and P-ACT. We find evidence for reduced thermal gas pressure in dark matter halos with masses $M < 10^{14} \, M_{\odot}/h$, supporting predictions of enhanced feedback from active galactic nuclei on gas thermodynamics. A comparison of the inferred matter power suppression reveals a $2-4\sigma$ tension with hydrodynamical simulations that implement mild baryonic feedback, as our constraints prefer a stronger suppression. Finally, we investigate biases from cosmic infrared background leakage in the tSZ-shear cross-correlation measurements, employing mitigation techniques to ensure a robust inference.

 - **Abstract**
 Astrophysical transient phenomena on sub-millisecond timescales, such as fast radio bursts and giant radio pulses from the Crab pulsar, have been primarily observed in radio wavebands. To investigate their origins, a photon detector with high sensitivity and high time resolution is required also in other wavelengths. Recently, we developed the Imager of MPPC-based Optical photoN counter from Yamagata (IMONY), an observation system utilizing a Geiger-mode avalanche photodiode (GAPD) as a sensor. The sensor consists of 64 pixels, each comprising a GAPD and a quenching resistor, with pixel sizes of 75, 100, 150, and 200\,$\mu$m. Each pixel signal is read out independently, enabling single-photon detection. After successfully observing the Crab pulsar using two Japanese telescopes, we upgraded the readout boards to achieve a more compact and stable system. The new system incorporates an analog application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) developed at KEK for multi-purpose fast readout for silicon photomultipliers. This ASIC features a fast transimpedance amplifier and a comparator, independently processing 16 channels. A Global Navigation Satellite System receiver and a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) provide timestamps for each detected photon with a resolution of 100 ns. The FPGA transmits the acquired data to a PC via Ethernet. This paper presents the details of the new system and the results of its initial evaluation.

 - **Abstract**
 Heating mechanism in the solar atmosphere (from chromosphere to corona) is one of the top-challenges in modern astronomy. The classic mechanisms can be divided into two categories: wave heating (W) and magnetic reconnection heating (X). Both of them still face some problems currently difficult to overcome. Recently, we proposed a new mechanism, called magnetic-gradient pumping heating (MGP, or P) which seems to overcome those difficulties, but still lacks sufficient observational evidence. Which one really explained the physics of hot corona exactly? How can observations be used to identify and verify the heating mechanism? Since different heating mechanism will generate non-thermal particles from different accelerations and experience different propagations, they will have different response on the broadband spectral radio observations. Among them, the non-thermal electrons from W mechanisms are closely related to shock-wave acceleration, and their radio response should be group of spike bursts with random distribution of drifting rates; the non-thermal electrons from X mechanisms are accelerated by reconnecting electric field with bidirectional flow, and their radio response should be type III pairs or spike pairs; P mechanism will produce energetic particle upflows, and their radio response should be unidirectional fiber bursts with moderate negative drifting rates. Therefore, the heating mechanism can be identified and verified from the the broadband dynamic spectral radio observations. Additionally, using high-resolution radioheliographs and spectral-imaging observations, the heating mechanisms in different regions can be identified and verified separately, thereby demonstrating the physical essence of hot corona.

 - **Abstract**
 To investigate the physical origin of red giants (RGs) and red supergiants (RSGs), we construct steady-state models of stellar envelopes by explicitly solving the stellar structure equations, with boundary conditions set at the stellar surface and the hydrogen burning shell. For comparison, we consider both polytropic and realistic models. Polytropic models adopt a polytropic equation of state (EOS) and neglect energy transport, while realistic models incorporate radiative and convective energy transport, along with tabulated EOS and opacities. Our steady-state solutions reproduce three key features relevant to the evolution toward the RG/RSG phase. First, the refined mirror principle of \cite{Ou2024} is reproduced: the stellar radius varies inversely with the radius of the envelope's inner boundary, defined by the burning shell's surface. This feature arises purely from hydrostatic equilibrium, as it appears in both polytropic and realistic models. Second, realistic models reveal an upper limit to envelope expansion, corresponding to an effective temperature of $\sim4,000\,{\rm K}$, which is characteristic of RG/RSG stars and consistent with the classical Hayashi limit. Approaching this limit, the envelope undergoes a structural transition marked by a significant change in the density profile and the formation of an extended convective zone. The location of this limit is governed by the sharp drop in H$^{-}$ opacity as the envelope cools below $\sim10,000\,{\rm K}$. Finally, our solutions show that even a small shift in the envelope's inner boundary can induce substantial envelope expansion throughout the yellow regime, naturally explaining the bifurcation of giants and supergiants into red and blue branches.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxies in the most underdense regions of the Universe, known as cosmic voids, exhibit astrophysical properties that suggest a distinct evolutionary path compared to galaxies in denser environments. Numerical simulations indicate that the assembly of void galaxies occurs later, leading to galaxies with younger stellar populations, low metallicities, and a high gas content in their halos, which provides the fuel to sustain elevated star formation activity. Our objective in this work is to test these numerical predictions with observational data by comparing galaxies in voids with galaxies in non-void environments. We used voids identified in SDSS data and galaxies from the MaNGA survey, which provides galaxies with integral field spectroscopy (IFS). We separated the galaxies into void and non-void samples, mimicked the magnitude distribution, and compared their integrated astrophysical properties as well as the metallicity and age profiles through a stacking technique, ETGs and LTGs separately. We find that void galaxies have younger and less metal-rich stellar populations. Regarding gas mass, we do not find differences across environments. When dividing galaxies into ETGs and LTGs, we observe that ETGs show negative gradients in both age and metallicity, with void galaxies consistently appearing younger and less metal-rich. For LTGs, age gradients are also negative, showing younger populations in void galaxies. However, we do not find statistically significant differences in stellar metallicity gradients between void and non-void environments. Our results show how the astrophysical properties of galaxies in voids differ from those of galaxies in the rest of the Universe. This suggests that the void environment plays a role in the evolution of its galaxies, delaying their assembly and growth.

 - **Abstract**
 Deuterium fractionation, as studied through mono-deuterated methanol, is frequently used as a diagnostic tool to trace the physical conditions and chemical evolution of interstellar sources. This study investigates methanol deuteration in the disk around V883 Ori, utilising recent laboratory spectroscopic data for CH$_2$DOH and CH$_3$OD along with ALMA observations. The derived column densities for CH$_2$DOH and CH$_3$OD are (5.14$\pm$0.08) $\times $10$^{16}$ cm$^{-2}$ and (4.22$\pm$0.06) $\times$ 10$^{16}$ cm$^{-2}$, respectively. The analysis demonstrates the influence of spectroscopic data on determining molecular column density, excitation temperature, and, most importantly, the inferred D/H ratio. The D/H ratio for CH$_2$DOH is calculated to be (7.3$\pm$1.5) $\times$ 10$^{-3}$ after applying a statistical correction, whilst the D/H ratio for CH$_3$OD is (1.79$\pm$0.36) $\times$ 10$^{-2}$. The discovery of an unexpectedly low CH$_2$DOH/CH$_3$OD ratio (1.22$\pm$0.02) in V883 Ori, however, raises further questions about the synthesis and chemical processes involved in CH$_3$OD formation. Overall, this study underscores the importance of accurate spectroscopic data for studies of isotopic fractionation and provides new insights into methanol deuteration chemistry in star-forming regions. Future research, combining updated spectroscopy and chemical modelling, will help further constrain these processes across different masses and evolutionary stages.

 - **Abstract**
 Spatially resolved polarization measurements of extended X-ray sources are expanding our understanding of the emission mechanisms and magnetic field properties involved. Such measurements have been possible in the past few years thanks to the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). However, the analysis of extended sources suffers a systematic effect known as polarization leakage, which artificially affects the measured polarization signal. To address this issue, we built a hybrid reconstruction algorithm, which combines machine learning and analytic techniques to improve the reconstruction of photoelectron tracks in the Gas Pixel Detector and to significantly mitigate polarization leakage. This work presents the first application of this hybrid method to experimental data, including both calibration lab measurements and IXPE observational data. We confirmed the reliable performance of the hybrid method for both cases. Additionally, we demonstrated the algorithm's effectiveness in reducing the polarization leakage effect through the analysis of the IXPE observation of the supernova remnant G21.5-0.9. By enabling more reliable polarization measurements, this method can potentially yield deeper insights into the magnetic field structures, particle acceleration processes, and emission mechanisms at work within extended X-ray sources.

 - **Abstract**
 The ultraluminous infrared galaxy (ULIRG) IRAS 00183-7111 ($z=0.328$) is one of the three ULIRGs that are currently known to host an active galactic nucleus (AGN) with young radio jets. We present a detailed study of the link between galaxy merger, AGN ignition, radio jet expansion and galactic-scale molecular outflow in IRAS 00183-7111, using high-resolution Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) observations of the $^{12}$CO(1-0) and $^{12}$CO(3-2) lines and very deep $i$-band VLT Survey Telescope (VST) imaging. The latter allows us to put - for the first time - tight constraints on the assembly history of the system, confirming that it formed through a major merger between two gas-rich spirals, likely characterised by a prograde encounter and no older than 2 Gyr. The recent merger channelled about $(1.0\pm0.1)\times10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$ of molecular gas in the central regions of the remnant, as traced by the CO detections. The spatial correlation between the CO distribution and the radio core suggests that this gas likely contributed to the ignition of the AGN and thus to the launch of the radio jets, which are no older than 2 Myr. Furthermore, by comparing the relative strength of the two CO transitions, we find extreme gas excitation (i.e. $T_{\rm ex}\gg50$ K) around the radio lobes, supporting the case for a jet-ISM interaction. A qualitative study of the CO kinematics also demonstrates that, despite the overall disturbed dynamical state with no clear signs of regular rotation, at least one non-rotational kinematic component can be identified and likely associated to an outflow with $v_{\rm out}\approx 556$ km s$^{-1}$ and $\dot{M_{\rm out}}\approx 110$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$.
#### A circularly polarized low-frequency radio burst from the exoplanetary system HD 189733

 - **Abstract**
 We aim to detect low-frequency radio emission from exoplanetary systems, which can provide insights into planetary magnetic fields, star-planet interactions, stellar activity, and exo-space weather. The HD 189733 system, hosting a well-studied hot Jupiter, is a prime target for such searches. We conducted NenuFAR imaging observations in the 15-62 MHz range, in order to cover the entire orbital phase of HD 189733 b. Dynamic spectra were generated for the target and other sources in the field, followed by a transient search in the time-frequency plane. The data processing pipeline incorporated direction-dependent calibration and noise characterization to improve sensitivity. We also searched for periodic signals using Lomb-Scargle analysis. A highly circularly polarized radio burst was detected at 50 MHz with a flux density of 1.5 Jy and a significance of 6 sigma at the position of HD 189733. No counterpart was found in Stokes I, likely because the emission is embedded in confusion noise and remains below the detection threshold. The estimated minimum fractional circular polarization of 38% suggests a coherent emission process. A periodicity search revealed no weaker signals linked to the planet's orbital period, the star's rotational period, or the synodic period and harmonic period between them. The burst's properties are consistent with cyclotron maser instability (CMI) emission, but the origin is still ambiguous. The comparison with theoretical models suggests star-planet interaction or stellar activity as potential origins. However, alternative explanations such as contamination from other sources along the line of sight (e.g. the companion M dwarf) or noise fluctuation cannot be ruled out.
#### New Insights into the T Tauri Binary Separation Distribution

 - **Abstract**
 For three decades, adaptive optic surveys have revealed an excess of T Tauri binaries across a = 10-100 au in nearby star-forming regions compared to the field population of main-sequence (MS) stars. Such an excess requires that most stars are born in dense clusters and subjected to significant dynamical processing that disrupts such binaries across intermediate separations. However, we demonstrate that the apparent excess is due to an observational selection bias. Close binaries within a < 100 au clear out their dusty circumstellar disks on faster timescales compared to wide binaries and single stars. A magnitude-limited sample is therefore biased toward close binaries that have preferentially cleared out their obscuring disks. We re-examine the separation distribution of pre-MS binaries in low-density Taurus, moderately dense Upper Scorpius, and the extremely dense Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC). By limiting the samples to primary spectral type / mass instead of magnitude, the artificial excess across a = 10-100 au disappears in all three environments. Across wider separations a = 100-4,000 au, Taurus exhibits an excess of companions (mostly tertiaries), the ONC displays a deficit, and Upper Scorpius matches the field MS population. The field derives from an amalgam of all three environments, where Upper Scorpius corresponds to the average birth environment of solar-type stars. The total binary fraction within a < 10,000 au in Taurus is only 52% +/- 7%, substantially lower than the 100% inferred from the biased observations and only slightly higher than the field MS value of 45%. N-body interactions preferentially disrupt outer tertiaries with only marginal dynamical processing of the inner binaries, especially those within a < 100 au.
#### Why M-dwarf flares have limited impact on sub-Neptunes' atmospheric evaporation

 - **Abstract**
 M-type stars are prime targets for exoplanet searches within their habitable zones (HZs). M-type stars also exhibit significant magnetic flaring activity, especially during the first billion years, which can potentially accelerate the evaporation of the hydrogen-helium envelopes of close-in planets. We use the time-dependent photo-ionization hydrodynamics code ATES to investigate the impact of flares on atmospheric escape, focusing on a sub-Neptune-sized planet orbiting an early M-type star at distances of 0.01, 0.1, and 0.18-0.36 AU--the inner and outer edges of the HZ. Stellar flaring is modeled as a 1 Gyr-long high-activity phase followed by a 4 Gyr-long low-activity phase, each characterized by a suitable flare frequency distribution. We find that flares have a modest impact (i.e., less than a factor of two) on increasing the cumulative atmospheric mass loss, with the greatest enhancement occurring when the planet is at its closest separation. However, the relative enhancement in mass loss between flaring and non-flaring cases is greater at larger separations. This trend arises because, as stellar irradiation fluctuates between quiescent levels and peak flares, the proportion of time the planet spends in energy-limited versus recombination-limited mass loss regimes depends on its orbital separation. Additionally, we demonstrate the existence of a characteristic flare energy, intermediate between the minimum and maximum values, that maximizes the fractional contribution to flare-driven mass loss. Our results indicate that the flaring activity of M-dwarfs does not significantly affect the atmospheric retention of close-in Neptune-sized planets, including within the HZ. The potential occurrence of rare super-flares, which observational campaigns might be biased against, does not alter our conclusions.
