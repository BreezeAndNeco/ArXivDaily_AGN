 - **Abstract**
 The origins of the colours of Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs) represent a crucial unresolved question, central to understanding the history of our Solar System. Recent observational surveys revealed correlations between the eccentricity and inclination of TNOs, and their colours. This rekindled the long-standing debate on whether these colours reflect the conditions of TNO formation or their subsequent evolution. We address this question using a model-agnostic, data-driven approach that unanimously converges to a common causal graph from the analysis of two different datasets, each from two different conditional independence test methods. For evaluation, we demonstrate how our model is consistent with the currently-accepted paradigms of TNOs' dynamical histories, without involving any orbital modelling or physics-based assumptions. Our causal model (with no knowledge of the existence of Neptune) predicts the need for an unknown confounding variable, consistent with Neptune's effects. The model predicts that the colour of TNOs is the root cause of their inclination distribution, rather than the other way around. This strongly suggests that the colours of TNOs reflect an underlying dynamical property, most likely their formation location. Our model excludes formation scenarios that invoke substantial colour modification by subsequent evolution. We conclude that the colours of TNOs are predominantly primordial.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultra hot Jupiters (UHJs) present a promising pathway for drawing a link between a planet's composition and formation history. They retain both refractory and volatiles species in gas phase in their atmospheres, which allows us to place unique constraints on their building blocks. Here, we present the 0.2 - 1.7 $\mu$m transmission spectrum of KELT-20 b/MASCARA-2 b taken with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Unlike other UHJs around early-type stars, KELT-20 b's orbit is well aligned with its host star's spin axis and we test whether its distinct dynamical configuration is reflected in its composition. We observe a tremendous rise (>10 scale heights) in the planet's transit depth at the near-UV wavelengths, akin to that observed for WASP-178 b and WASP-121 b, and a muted water absorption feature in the near-IR. Our retrievals indicate that the large NUV depth is driven by Fe II and/or SiO and that the water is mostly thermally dissociated. Assuming equilibrium chemistry, we obtain constraints on Z/H and O/H that indicate accretion of volatile-rich solids and/or gas. Both our low resolution spectrum and the refractory elemental ratios from Gandhi et al. 2023 suggest that nightside condensation and rainout are limited to only the most refractory species in the planet's atmosphere. Within the precision limits of the HST spectra, no strong evidence for limb asymmetry is detected. We contextualize this lack of asymmetry by comparing to predictions from general circulation models with and without the effects of kinematic magnetohydrodynamics. Lastly, we find no major differences in the HST transmission spectra of KELT-20 b, WASP-178, and WASP-121 b despite their different dynamical configurations.

 - **Abstract**
 Using the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) aboard the Hubble Space Telescope with both far-UV (FUV) and near-UV (NUV) gratings, we measure the ionizing spectra of two bright, intermediate-redshift quasars in their rest-frame extreme ultraviolet (EUV). The availability of both NUV and FUV spectra allows us to define the quasar continuum and correct for strong Lyman-limit systems (LLS) that fall in the gap between the FUV and optical. Each AGN has a prominent LLS, but the flux recovery shortward of their Lyman edges allows us to fit and restore the true AGN continuum. In the EUV (450-912 A) these AGN have flux distributions, $F_{\nu} \propto \nu^{-\alpha_{\nu}}$, with spectral indices $\alpha_{\nu} = 1.11\pm0.22$ (SBS 1010+535, $z_{\rm AGN} = 1.5086$) and $\alpha_{\nu} = 0.98\pm0.22$ (HS 0747+4259, $z_{\rm AGN} = 1.9006$), both considerably harder than the mean index, $\alpha_{\nu} = 1.41\pm0.15$, in a COS composite spectrum of 159 UV-bright AGN. These two AGN are outliers in the index distribution, perhaps resulting from their extremely high UV luminosity ($10^{48}~{\rm erg~s}^{-1}$), estimated black-hole masses (0.5-1)$\times10^{10} M_{\odot}$, and effects on the inner accretion disk and Comptonized winds.

 - **Abstract**
 We present polarization maps of dust emission at 340 GHz in the luminous high-mass protocluster, W3 IRS5, observed with the Submillimeter Array. The projected magnetic fields appear fairly organized with a pinched morphology in the northern part and a concave shape in the southern part. We fit the polarization maps with a two-component magnetic field model: an hourglass model centered at the continuum peak, SMM2, and an empirical sphere centered at the O-type star, IRS7. Using the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method, we calculate a projected field strength of $B_\mathrm{pos} = 1.4 \; \mathrm{mG}$. Along with the Zeeman measurement, a total magnetic field strength of $B_\mathrm{tot} = 1.6 \; \mathrm{mG}$ is obtained. We find that the gravitational energy is the most dominant, followed by magnetic energy, and then turbulent energy. Small values of the virial parameter, $\alpha_\mathrm{vir} = 0.8$, and the ratio of timescales, $t_\mathrm{ff}/t_\mathrm{corss} = 0.6$, suggest an ongoing collapse. We also show collimated molecular outflows in the $\mathrm{CO \; (3-2)}$ and $\mathrm{SiO \; (8-7)}$ transitions. The morphology of magnetic fields and the surrounding \HII regions put forward a scenario for W3 IRS5. A gravitationally unstable dense core formed within a neutral gas ridge plowed by the expansions of W3 A and W3 B. The core began to contract, causing gravity to pull the magnetic field lines inward, which resulted in a pinched field morphology. Subsequent expansion of W3 F, ionized by IRS7, perturbed the magnetic field, creating concave patterns. The dynamical interactions among protostars led to misalignment of their outflows.
#### PLATOSpec's first results: planets WASP-35b and TOI-622b are on aligned orbits, and K2-237b is on a polar orbit

 - **Abstract**
 The spin-orbit angle between a stellar spin axis and its planetary orbital axis is a key diagnostic of planetary migration pathways, yet the mechanisms shaping the observed spin-orbit distribution remain incompletely understood. Combining the spin-orbit angle with atmospheric measurements has emerged as a powerful method of studying exoplanets that showcases the synergy between ground- and space-based observations. We present the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect measurements of the projected spin-orbit angle ($\lambda$) for three gaseous exoplanets using the newly commissioned PLATOSpec instrument on the E152 Telescope at La Silla Observatory. For WASP-35b, we determine $\lambda = 1_{-18}^{+19}$ deg, demonstrating PLATOSpec's capabilities through excellent agreement with HARPS-N literature data. We provide the first spin-orbit measurements for TOI-622b ($\lambda =-4 \pm 12$ deg, true spin-orbit angle $\psi = $16.1$^{+8.0}_{-9.7}$ deg), revealing an aligned orbit consistent with quiescent disc migration. For K2-237b, we find $\lambda = 91 \pm 7$ deg and $\psi = $90.5$^{+6.8}_{-6.2}$ deg, indicating a nearly perfect polar orbit, which suggests a history consistent with disc-free migration, contrasting previous studies inferring disc migration. TOI-622b populates a sparsely populated region of sub-Jovian planets with measured spin-orbit angles orbiting stars above the Kraft break, while K2-237b's polar configuration strengthens tentative evidence for preferential orbital orientations. All three systems are compelling targets for future atmospheric characterization, where these dynamical constraints will be vital for a comprehensive understanding of their formation and evolution.
#### Forbush Decreases during strong Geomagnetic Storms: Time Delays, Rigidity Effects, and ICME-Driven Modulation

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the relationship between Forbush decreases (FDs) and associated geomagnetic storms, and their links to interplanetary solar wind parameters, using high-resolution minute data. FDs are classified by main-phase decrease steps and analyzed with superposed epoch analysis. Fast, turbulent, high-field sheath structures occur before and during coronal mass ejection (CME)-driven FDs, whereas corotating interaction region events show delayed amplification and more perturbed dynamics. Time lags between FD and storm onsets are examined for space weather forecasting. FD amplitude correlates more strongly with moderate and strong CME-driven storms than with extreme storms, likely due to complex magnetospheric responses from successive events and prolonged southward IMF Bz. Events with fast shocks and sheath regions show stronger correlations than those without shocks. Energy dependence, derived from twelve neutron monitor stations worldwide, reveals a two-step linear rigidity spectrum: sharp FD amplitude decrease at low rigidity and a more gradual drop at higher rigidity.

 - **Abstract**
 Multi-messenger astronomy offers a powerful approach to studying high-energy radiative processes in astrophysical sources. A notable example was seen in 2017, when the IceCube Neutrino Observatory detected a high-energy neutrino event that was found to coincide with a gamma-ray flare from a blazar. Since then, numerous multi-messenger studies combining neutrino and photon data have been conducted, yet the origin of neutrinos from active galactic nuclei (AGN) remains uncertain. In this work, we present the results of an X-ray observing program targeting two AGNs, NGC 1068 and PKS 1502+106. The multi-wavelength dataset includes new observations from NICER and NuSTAR from the observing proposal along with gamma-ray data collected using Fermi-LAT, and one archival observation from Chandra. Additionally, we derive the neutrino fluxes for both AGNs using ten years of IceCube data and neutrino spectra predicted by theoretical models. These results demonstrate the value of combining multi-messenger data in building and constraining theoretical models. They also highlight the importance of testing model predictions against observational data to refine measurements of both the neutrino flux and spectral shape.

 - **Abstract**
 A few years ago, we investigated MYSO G29.862-0.0044 (YSO-G29), an intriguing star-forming region at a distance of 6.2 kpc. Although the typical disc-jet scenario was proposed to explain the observations, it remained far from conclusive. YSO-G29 was analysed using new observations at near-IR from Gemini-NIFS, at radio continuum (10 GHz) from Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA), and new continuum (1.3 mm) and molecular line data from the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). The near-IR observations allowed us to detect emission of H2 1-0 S(1) and Br-gamma lines in YSO-G29, which are compatible with excitation and ionization from UV radiation propagating in a highly perturbed ambient. In addition, some evidence of H2 excitation by collisions were found. The ALMA data show the presence of a conspicuous and collimated molecular outflow propagating southwards, while to the north, an extended molecular feature perfectly surrounded by the Ks near-IR emission appears. The continuum emission at 1.3 mm allowed us to better resolve the molecular cores, one of which stands out due to its high temperatures and rich chemical composition. From the JVLA observations, we discovered a compact radio continuum source, a likely compact Hii region or an ionised jet of a massive protostar, located at ~0.7 arcsec (~ 0.02 pc) from the main millimetre core. In this way, we propose a YSO wide binary system. {We can explain the nature of the intriguing near-IR features previously observed: cone-like structures produced by jets/winds of one of the components of the binary system that cleared out the surroundings were disrupted by a molecular outflow probably from the other component. These results complete the picture of what is happening in YSO-G29, and reveal a phenomenon that should be considered when investigating massive star-forming regions.
#### SHH method for SIDM: An SIDM-hydro hybrid method for simulating self-interacting dark matter

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new scheme to couple existing numerical methods for elastic self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) to the hydrodynamic equations via a continuous function of the local Knudsen number. The method, an SIDM-hydro hybrid (SHH), allows more efficient simulation of the evolution of inhomogeneous halos deep into the regime of gravothermal collapse. With the improved efficiency gained by moving to a hydrodynamical description in high-density regions, the SHH method allows central densities of two orders of magnitude higher to be reached in considerably less simulation time than traditional methods. Our implementation should be considered as the first step toward a robust SHH method, as we interpolate the first and second moments of the Boltzmann equation in the ideal-fluid limit only. The simulation results are qualitatively similar to those found with other methods, although there are differences in the implementation of the primary physics driving the dynamics, and in the details of the resulting halo profiles. However, our results indicate that the SHH technique shows promise to investigate gravothermal collapse in diverse, dynamical environments. The method can be extended to incorporate non-ideal fluid terms and dissipation, as needed for dark-matter scenarios where interactions beyond the elastic regime may be important in the dense interiors of some halos.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) at low radio frequencies play an important role in understanding the Galactic pulsar population and characterising both their emission properties and the effects of the ionised interstellar medium on the received signals. To date, only a relatively small fraction of the known MSP population has been detected at frequencies below 300 MHz, and nearly all previous MSP studies at these frequencies have been conducted with northern telescopes. We present a census of MSPs in the SMART pulsar survey, covering declinations south of +30 deg at a centre frequency of 154 MHz. We detected 40 MSPs, with 11 being the first published detections below 300 MHz. For each detection, we provide coherently-dedispersed full-polarimetric integrated pulse profiles and mean flux densities. We measured significant Faraday rotation measures (RMs) for 25 MSPs, and identified apparent phase-dependent RM variations for three MSPs. Comparison with published profiles at other frequencies supports previous studies suggesting that the pulse component separations of MSPs vary negligibly over a wide frequency range due to their compact magnetospheres. We observe that integrated pulse profiles tend to be more polarised at low frequencies, consistent with depolarisation due to superposed orthogonal polarisation modes. The results of this census will be a valuable resource for planning future MSP monitoring projects at low frequencies, and will also help to improve survey simulations to forecast the detectable MSP population with the SKA-Low.

 - **Abstract**
 The influx of icy pebbles to the inner regions of protoplanetary disks constitutes a fundamental ingredient in most planet formation theories. The observational determination of the magnitude of this pebble flux and its dependence on disk substructure (disk gaps as pebble traps) would be a significant step forward. In this work we analyze a sample of 21 T Tauri disks (with ages $\approx 0.5{-}2\mathrm{~Myr}$) using JWST/MIRI spectra homogeneously reduced with the JDISCS pipeline and high-angular-resolution ALMA continuum data. We find that the 1500/6000 K water line flux ratio measured with JWST - a tracer of cold water vapor and pebble drift near the snowline - correlates with the radial location of the innermost dust gap in ALMA continuum observations (ranging from 8.7 to 69 au), confirming predictions from recent models that study connections between the inner and outer disk reservoirs. We develop a population synthesis exploration of pebble drift in gapped disks and find a good match to the observed trend for early and relatively effective gaps, while scenarios where pebble drift happens quickly, gaps are very leaky, or where gaps form late are disfavored on a population level. Inferred snowline pebble mass fluxes (ranging between $10^{-6}$ and $10^{-3}~M_\oplus/\mathrm{yr}$ depending on gap position) are comparable to fluxes used in pebble accretion studies and those proposed for the inner Solar System, while system-to-system variations suggest differences in the emerging planetary system architectures and water budgets.

 - **Abstract**
 The R ratio is a useful diagnostic of the X-ray emitting astrophysical plasmas defined as the intensity ratio of the forbidden over the inter-combination lines in the K$\alpha$ line complex of He-like ions. The value is altered by excitation processes (electron impact or UV photoexcitation) from the metastable upper level of the forbidden line, thereby constraining the electron density or UV field intensity. The diagnostic has been applied mostly in electron density constraints in collisionally ionized plasmas using low-Z elements as was originally proposed for the Sun (Gabriel & Jordan (1969a, MNRAS, 145, 241)), but it can also be used in photoionized plasmas. To make use of this diagnostic, we need to know its value in the limit of no excitation of metastables (R$_0$), which depends on the element, how the plasmas are formed, how the lines are propagated, and the spectral resolution affecting line blending principally with satellite lines from Li-like ions. We benchmark R$_0$ for photoionized plasmas by comparing calculations using radiative transfer codes and observation data taken with the Resolve X-ray microcalorimter onboard XRISM. We use the Fe XXV He$\alpha$ line complex of the photo-ionized plasma in Centaurus X-3 observed during eclipse, in which the plasma is expected to be in the limit of no metastable excitation. The measured R$ = 0.65 \pm 0.08$ is consistent with the value calculated using xstar for the plasma parameters derived from other line ratios of the spectrum. We conclude that the R ratio diagnostic can be used for high-$Z$ elements such as Fe in photoionized plasmas, which has wide applications in plasmas around compact objects at various scales.

 - **Abstract**
 We explored the expected properties of the neutrino emission from accreting neutron stars in X-ray binaries using numerical simulations. The simulations are based on a model in which neutrinos are produced by the decay of charged pions and kaons, generated in inelastic collisions between protons accelerated up to TeV energies in the magnetosphere of a magnetized (B~1E12 G) neutron star and protons of the accretion disc. Our results show that this process can produce strong neutrino emission up to a few tens of TeV when the X-ray luminosity is above ~1E39 erg/s, as in ultra-luminous X-ray (ULX) pulsars. We show that neutrinos from a transient Galactic ULX pulsar with L_x ~ 5E39 erg/s can be detected with kilometre-scale detectors such as IceCube if the source is within about 3-4 kpc. We also derived an upper limit on the neutrino flux from the Galactic ULX pulsar Swift J0243.6+6124 using IceCube data, a result that has not been previously reported. Our findings establish a new benchmark for future astrophysical neutrino observations, critical for interpreting data from current and upcoming instruments with significantly improved sensitivity.

 - **Abstract**
 The LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) is capable of imaging spectroscopy of the Sun in the 10-240 MHz frequency range, with high spectral, temporal, and spatial resolution. However, the complex and rapidly varying nature of solar radio emission - spanning several orders of magnitude in brightness further exacerbated by the strong ionospheric phase distortions during daytime observations, poses major challenges for calibration, imaging, and automation. We aim to develop a fully automated, high-fidelity imaging pipeline optimized for LOFAR solar observations, capable of handling the intrinsic variability of solar emission and producing science-ready images with minimal human intervention. We have built the Solar Imaging Pipeline for LOFAR (SIMPL), which integrates excision of radio-frequency interference (RFI) for the solar-specific scenarios, calibration strategies, and self-calibration. The pipeline is designed to enable scalable and uniform processing of large archival datasets. SIMPL achieves more than an order-of-magnitude improvement in imaging dynamic range compared to previous efforts and reliably produces high-quality spectroscopic snapshot images. It has been tested across a wide range of solar conditions. It is currently being employed to process a decade of LOFAR solar observations, providing science-ready FITS images for the community and enabling both comprehensive and novel studies of solar radio phenomena -- ranging from quiet Sun emission and faint non-thermal features to active regions and their associated dynamic events, such as transient bursts.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational waves (GWs) passing through the Earth cause a correlated pattern of time-dependent deflections of the apparent position of astronomical sources. We build upon standard lensing reconstruction techniques to develop a new time-dependent quadratic estimator, providing a novel technique to search for the deflections produced by GWs using observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). We find that the time-dependent deflection reconstruction is many orders of magnitude more sensitive than the ordinary static lensing estimator, and it can be employed with the data collected by existing and future CMB surveys, without requiring any modification to the experimental or survey design. We demonstrate that CMB surveys offer sensitivity to GWs across a broad frequency range: while the sensitivity will not be competitive over the frequency range covered by pulsar timing arrays, it does extend coverage to both lower and higher frequencies. Finally, we discuss how our methods can be extended to search for other time-varying signals, and also how it can be applied to surveys at other wavelengths.
#### Forgotten treasures in the HST/FOC UV imaging polarimetric archives of active galactic nuclei -- IV. 5 Orphaned AGNs

 - **Abstract**
 The Faint Object Camera (FOC) onboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) acquired high-resolution, spatially resolved polarimetric images of nearby Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) in the near ultraviolet (near-UV) band. Among the 25 individual targets in the polarized archives, 8 had no published analysis until the beginning of this series of papers. We tackle the last 5 targets in the following. In this paper, we finalize the publication of near-UV imaging polarimetry of AGNs in the HST/FOC archives. We render available spatially resolved polarization maps of the [OIII] emission lines for Mrk 3 and Mrk 78, as well as near-UV continuum polarization maps for Mrk 3, NGC 3862, Cygnus A and 3C 109. We make use of the generalized reduction pipeline presented in the first paper in this series to homogeneously analyze the five remaining polarized observations of AGNs in the FOC archives. In Mrk 3 and Mrk 78, we find a polarization pattern in the narrow-line regions consistent with scattering from an obscured nucleus. For NGC 3862, we confirm marginal UV polarization parallel with the inner radio jet, related to synchrotron emission. In Cygnus A, we report spatially resolved centro-symmetric polarization patterns in both opposite outflows, highlighting the scattering origin of the polarized light. Finally, 3C 109 shows high nuclear polarization, consistent with AGN-dominated emission and parallel with the radio axis, but in tension with polarization arising from dichroic absorption invoked by previous authors. The imaging polarimetry obtained for the narrow-line region and the extended scattering medium surrounding the obscured AGNs is aligned with the predictions of the unified AGN model and demonstrates the power of spatially-resolved polarimetric observation to decipher the complex morphologies at work in AGNs.

 Magnetic reconnection drives a wide range of astrophysical phenomena, including geomagnetic storms, solar flares, and activity in blazars. However, direct measurement of key reconnection observables remains challenging due to the remote and extreme nature of these environments. While high-energy particle showers observed on Earth are often attributed to reconnection, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood, and clear diagnostic signatures are lacking. We present a theoretical, data-driven approach for identifying reconnection radiation signatures and enabling remote diagnostics of reconnection in astrophysical settings through radiation spectra. Using particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of magnetic reconnection, we generate radiation spectra and establish connections between spectral features and the underlying reconnection dynamics. We develop a method to estimate the ratio of the reconnection electric field to the plasmoid magnetic field from spectral data. Analytic calculations show that other parameters can be extracted in the ultra-relativistic reconnection regime, such as the magnetic field or the current sheet width.

 - **Abstract**
 Ellerman bombs (EBs) are small and short-lived magnetic reconnection events in the lower solar atmosphere, most commonly reported in the line wings of the H$\alpha$ line. These events are thought to play a role in heating the solar chromosphere and corona, but their size, short lifetime, and similarity to other brightenings make them difficult to detect. We aim to automatically detect and statistically analyze EBs at different heliocentric angles to find trends in their physical properties. We developed an automated EB detection pipeline based on a star-finding algorithm. This pipeline was used on ten high-resolution H$\alpha$ datasets from the 1-meter Swedish Solar Telescope (SST). This pipeline identifies and tracks EBs in time, while separating them from visually similar pseudo-EBs. It returns key parameters such as size, contrast, lifetime, and occurrence rates based on a dynamic threshold and the more classical static `contrast threshold` of 1.5 times the mean quiet-Sun (QS) intensity. For our dynamic threshold, we found a total of 2257 EBs from 28,772 individual detections across our datasets. On average, the full detection set exhibits an area of 0.44 arcsec$^2$ (0.37 Mm$^2$), a peak intensity contrast of 1.4 relative to the QS, and a median lifetime of 2.3 min. ...

 - **Abstract**
 The present thesis aims to tackle two critical aspects of present and future cosmological analysis of Large-Scale Structure (LSS): accurate modelling of the nonlinear matter power spectrum beyond $\Lambda$CDM, and efficient computational techniques for Bayesian parameter estimation. Both are crucial for testing alternative cosmologies and avoiding spurious results. We focus on the Dark Scattering (DS) model, describing pure momentum transfer between dark matter -- dark energy through the parameter $A_{\rm ds}$. To capture DS effects, we adopt the halo model reaction framework within $\tt{ReACT}$, compute the nonlinear DS spectrum, and validate it against $N$-body simulations. We further include baryonic feedback and massive neutrinos, finding degeneracies between DS and baryonic effects but not with neutrinos. We then constrain DS using cosmic shear from KiDS-1000, accelerated by neural emulators from $\tt{CosmoPower}$, which speed up predictions by $\mathcal{O}(10^4)$. Our DS emulator, trained on halo model reaction outputs, preserves percent-level accuracy and incorporates baryonic feedback. Analysing KiDS shear statistics, we obtain $\vert A_{\rm ds}\vert \lesssim 20$ b/GeV at $68 \%$ C.L. Combining KiDS with Planck CMB and BAO data, we find $A_{\rm ds}=10.6^{+4.5}_{-7.3}$ b/GeV at $68 \%$ C.L., suggesting the DS model as a promising resolution to the $S_8$ tension. Finally, we present weak lensing forecasts for Stage IV surveys using an automatically differentiable pipeline with $\tt{jax-cosmo}$ and gradient-based samplers in $\tt{NumPyro}$, reducing computational cost from months on CPUs to days on GPUs. Model evidence is evaluated with $\tt{harmonic}$ under multiple scale cuts. To put things into perspective, the modelling strategies and machine learning accelerations developed here provide powerful tools for the next generation of LSS cosmology.

 - **Abstract**
 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) have been essential for probing the nature of dark energy; however, most SN analyses rely on the same low-redshift sample, which may lead to shared systematics. In a companion paper (Sherman et al., submitted), we introduce the Dark Energy Bedrock All-Sky Supernova (DEBASS) program, which has already collected more than 500 low-redshift SNe Ia on the Dark Energy Camera (DECam), and present an initial release of 77 SNe Ia within the Dark Energy Survey (DES) footprint observed between 2021 and 2024. Here, we examine the systematics, including photometric calibration and selection effects. We find agreement at the 10 millimagnitude level among the tertiary standard stars of DEBASS, DES, and Pan-STARRS1. Our simulations reproduce the observed distributions of DEBASS SN light-curve properties, and we measure a bias-corrected Hubble residual scatter of $0.08$ mag, which, while small, is found in 10% of our simulations. We compare the DEBASS SN distances to the Foundation sample and find consistency with a median residual offset of $0.016 \pm 0.019$ mag. Selection effects have negligible impacts on distances, but a different photometric calibration solution shifts the median residual $-0.015 \pm 0.019$ mag, highlighting calibration sensitivity. Using conservative simulations, we forecast that replacing historical low-redshift samples with the full DEBASS sample (>400 SNe Ia) will improve the statistical uncertainties on dark energy parameters $w_0$ and $w_a$ by 30% and 24% respectively, enhance the dark energy Figure of Merit by up to 60%, and enable a measurement of $f\sigma_8$ at the 25% level.

 - **Abstract**
 Starburst galaxies, like M82, launch kiloparsec-scale galactic outflows that interact with the circumgalactic medium (CGM) in complex ways. Apart from enriching the CGM with metals and energy, these outflows may trigger star formation in the halo -- either by driving shocks into the CGM or transporting cold, star-forming gas. To investigate such processes, we analyze the star formation history (SFH) of the Southern Arcs -- arc-like stellar features located ~5 kpc from M82's star-forming disk along the minor axis -- using Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 photometry. From resolved stellar populations, we derive SFHs over the last ~500 Myr, finding that ~85% of the stellar mass formed between ~150 and ~70 Myr ago, followed by a brief pause, with the remaining ~15% forming since ~30 Myr ago. The two stellar populations are co-spatial on scales of at least ~200 pc. The timing of the ~100 Myr burst aligns with star formation in the M82 disk and the age distribution of its star clusters, suggesting a causal link between the disk starburst and halo star formation. We explore two mechanisms that could explain these observations. In the first, shocks driven by the interaction between hot outflowing gas and cooler CGM material compress dense clouds, triggering collapse and star formation. In the second, stars form directly within massive, cool clouds associated with the outflow. As these clouds move ballistically through the halo, subsequent interactions with tidal debris may trigger additional star formation, producing the observed episodic structure.
