 - **Abstract**
 Ultra-hot Jupiters exhibit day-to-night temperature contrasts upwards of 1000 K due to competing effects of strong winds, short radiative timescales, magnetic drag, and H2 dissociation/recombination. Spectroscopic phase curves provide critical insights into these processes by mapping temperature distributions and constraining the planet's energy budget across different pressure levels. Here, we present the first NIRISS/SOSS phase curve of an ultra-hot Jupiter, WASP-121 b. The instrument's bandpass [0.6 - 2.85 micron] captures an estimated 50-83% of the planet's bolometric flux, depending on orbital phase, allowing for unprecedented constraints on the planet's global energy budget; previous measurements with HST/WFC3 and JWST/NIRSpec/G395H captured roughly 20% of the planetary flux. Accounting for the unobserved regions of the spectrum, we estimate effective day and nightside temperatures of T_day = 2717 +/- 17 K and T_night = 1562 +/- 19 K corresponding to a Bond albedo of A_B = 0.277 +/- 0.016 and a heat recirculation efficiency of epsilon = 0.246 +/- 0.014. Matching the phase-dependent effective temperature with energy balance models yields a similar Bond albedo of 0.3 and a mixed layer pressure of 1 bar consistent with photospheric pressures, but unexpectedly slow winds of 0.2 km/s, indicative of inefficient heat redistribution. The shorter optical wavelengths of the NIRISS/SOSS Order 2 yield a geometric albedo of A_g = 0.093 +/- 0.029 (3 sigma upper limit of 0.175), reinforcing the unexplained trend of hot Jupiters exhibiting larger Bond albedos than geometric albedos. We also detect near-zero phase curve offsets for wavelengths above 1.5 micron, consistent with inefficient heat transport, while shorter wavelengths potentially sensitive to reflected light show eastward offsets.

 - **Abstract**
 [Shortened for arXiv] We conduct a systematic search for $\log(M_\ast/M_\odot) \geq 9.5$ quiescent galaxies at $z > 3$ in six extragalactic deep fields observed with NIRCam, with the goal of extracting their physical and statistical features in a uniform and self-consistent manner. We exploit the ASTRODEEP-JWST photometric catalogs to single out robust candidates, including sources quenched only a few tens of Myr before the observation. We apply a SED-fitting procedure which explores three functional forms of star formation history and the $\chi^2$ probabilities of the solutions, with additional checks to minimise the contamination from interlopers, tuning our selection criteria against available spectroscopic data from the DAWN archive and simulated catalogs. We select 633 candidates, which we rank by a reliability parameter based on the probabilities of the quiescent and alternative star-forming solutions, with 291 candidates tagged as "gold". According to the best-fit models, 79\% of the massive ($\log(M_\ast/M_\odot) \geq 10.5$) quiescent galaxies at $3 < z < 5$ stopped forming stars at least 150 Myr before the time of observation, while 89\% of low-mass sources have been quenched for less than 150 Myr. The abundance of low-mass old quiescent systems does not increase significantly with time from $z = 5$ to 3: low-mass objects seem to be experiencing a short episode of quenching followed by rejuvenation (``breathing''), consistent with a downsizing scenario of galaxy formation. We also find an abrupt drop in the density of massive quiescent candidates at $z > 5$. We derive estimates for the number density of early passive galaxies up to $z = 10$ and compare them against various models: tensions with data remain in the modeling of the observed bimodality of time passed since quenching as a function of mass.

 - **Abstract**
 The remnants of galaxy mergers may host multiple off-nuclear massive black holes (MBHs), some of which may wander indefinitely within the host galaxy halos. Tracing the population of offset MBHs is essential for understanding how the distribution of MBHs in the Universe evolves through galaxy mergers, the efficiency of binary MBH formation, and the rates at which MBHs are seeded in low-mass satellite galaxies. Offset MBHs can be observationally traced if they are accreting and detectable as spatially offset active galactic nuclei (AGN). In this work, we build the largest uniform sample of spatially offset AGN candidates (328) by matching sources from the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) to galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Based on the radio source surface density, 29+/-3% are unrelated chance projections. The offset AGN occupation fraction is positively correlated with host galaxy stellar mass, consistent with predictions that most offset MBHs will reside in massive halos. However, this trend vanishes, and may reverse, at the lowest stellar masses, potentially reflecting the weaker host galaxy gravitational potentials. The offset AGN occupation fraction shows no significant evolution with orbital radius, and the agreement with predictions suggests a binary MBH formation rate of <0.5 per merger. Finally, for offset MBHs down to masses of 10^5 Solar masses, the occupation fraction is ~30-70 times lower than the expected value assuming all accreted satellites host a MBH. This result may suggest a relatively low MBH seeding efficiency.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first infrared spectral predictions from a self-consistent simulation of the formation of a quasar in a starburst galaxy, spanning cosmological to innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) scales. The infrared emission is dominated by a torus-like dust structure composed of the highly magnetized, turbulence-supported outer accretion disk and of accreting gas tidally torn from the interstellar medium (ISM). At these early stages, the AGN is buried and Compton-thick. The near- to mid-IR escaping luminosity varies by almost an order of magnitude across sightlines, largely due to extinction from the inflowing stream of cold dust. Self-absorption within the torus suppresses silicate emission features, and further reprocessing by the ambient ISM leads to prominent silicate absorption and colder IR emission. The sublimation structure is stratified by composition and size, producing sightline-dependent extinction curves that intrinsically vary in shape. However, after repeated scattering in the optically thick dusty medium, these curves emerge substantially grayed. We also demonstrate that bipolar outflows from the central black hole that carve biconical cavities and reveal the central engine in later stages can preserve IR anisotropy and silicate features. These results suggest that dusty starburst quasars can undergo a buried, IR-bright phase early in their evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 The intrinsic variability of stars, due to acoustic oscillations, surface granulation, and magnetic activity, introduces radial velocity (RV) jitter in spectral lines, obscuring true planetary signals and hindering the detection of Earth-like planets. Granulation is particularly challenging, as it affects even the most inactive stars introducing substantial signals, with amplitudes up to 1 m/s. Disentangling granulation-induced RV jitter from signal caused by planetary reflex motion requires reliable models of stellar granulation. In this study, we present a new approach for calculating sensitivities of spectral lines to granulation. We simulate near-surface convection with 3D radiative MHD code MURaM and calculate high-resolution emergent spectra with the radiative transfer code MPS-ATLAS. We then introduce a novel methodology that uses spatial variability of spectral lines across the granulation pattern at a single moment in time to compute their temporal variability. This approach significantly reduces computational costs. We apply our approach to analyze the response of lines from neutral and singly ionized elemental species to solar this http URL find a clear distinction between the two groups of lines: those from neutral elements tend to show stronger variations in line strength, whereas those from singly ionized elements exhibit larger variations in central wavelength. These results enable the development of spectral line masks tailored to granulation sensitivity, offering a promising strategy to reduce granulation-induced RV noise and improve exoplanet detection.
#### Discovery and Analysis of Afterglows from Poorly Localised GRBs with the Gravitational-wave Optical Transient Observer (GOTO) All-sky Survey

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), particularly those detected by wide-field instruments such as the Fermi/GBM, pose a challenge for optical follow-up due to their large initial localisation regions, leaving many GRBs without identified afterglows. The Gravitational-wave Optical Transient Observer (GOTO), with its wide field of view, dual-site coverage, and robotic rapid-response capability, bridges this gap by rapidly identifying and localising afterglows from alerts issued by space-based facilities including Fermi, SVOM, Swift, and the EP, providing early optical positions for coordinated multi-wavelength follow-up. In this paper, we present optical afterglow localisation and multi-band follow-up of seven Fermi/GBM and MAXI/GSC triggered long GRBs (240122A, 240225B, 240619A, 240910A, 240916A, 241002B, and 241228B) discovered by GOTO in 2024. Spectroscopy for six GRBs (no spectroscopic data for GRB 241002B) with VLT/X-shooter and GTC/OSIRIS yields precise redshifts spanning $z\approx0.40-$3.16 and absorption-line diagnostics of host and intervening systems. Radio detections for four events confirm the presence of long-lived synchrotron emission. Prompt-emission analysis with Fermi and MAXI data reveals a spectrally hard population, with two bursts lying $>3\sigma$ above the Amati relation. Although their optical afterglows resemble those of typical long GRBs, the prompt spectra are consistently harder than the long-GRB average. Consistent modelling of six GOTO-discovered GRB afterglows yields jet half-opening angles of a few degrees and beaming-corrected kinetic energies ($E_{jet}\sim10^{51-52}$) erg, consistent with the canonical long-GRB population. These findings suggest that optical discovery of poorly localised GRBs may be subject to observational biases favouring luminous events with high spectral peak energy, while also providing insight into jet microphysics and central engine diversity.

 - **Abstract**
 The Be/X-ray pulsar 4U 0115+63 underwent a type II outburst in 2023. After the outburst, similar to the outbursts in 2015 and 2017, the source decayed into a quiescent state. Two out of three XMM-Newton observations conducted after the 2023 outburst confirmed the source to be in a low-luminosity state at a level of $L_{\rm X} \sim 10^{33}\,\rm erg\,s^{-1}$. X-ray pulsations were detected at $\approx$0.277 Hz in both observations with a pulsed fraction exceeding 50%. The power density spectra show no significant low-frequency red noise in both observations, suggesting that the radiation is not driven by accretion. The energy spectra in this state can be described by a single blackbody component, with an emitting area smaller than the typical size of the polar caps during the accretion phase. Based on the timing and spectral properties, we suggest that the propeller effect is active during the quiescent state, resulting in a total quenching of accretion. We discuss possible mechanisms for the generation of pulsations in this regime and consider the scenario of neutron star crust cooling.

 - **Abstract**
 Current population models of binary black hole distributions are difficult to interpret because standard population inferences hinge on modeling choices, which can mask or mimic real structure. The maximum population likelihood ``$\pistroke$ formalism'' provides a means to investigate and interpret features in the distribution of binary black holes using only data -- without specifying a population model. It tells us if features inferred from current population models are truly present in the data or if they arise from model misspecification. It also provides guidance for developing new models by highlighting previously unnoticed features. In this study, we utilize the $\pistroke$ formalism to examine the binary black hole population in the LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA (LVK) fourth Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-4). Our analysis supports the existence of a gap around $45\,M_\odot$ in the secondary black hole mass distribution and identifies a widening in the distribution of the effective inspiral spin parameter $\chi_\text{eff}$ near this mass as recently reported by Tong et al. (2025). Similar to earlier studies, we find support for an anti-correlation between $\chi_\text{eff}$ and mass ratio. However, we argue that this may be a spurious correlation arising from misspecification of the joint distribution of black hole masses. Furthermore, we identify support for dimensionless black hole spin magnitudes at approximately $\chi \approx 0.2$ and $\chi\approx0.7$. The data support the existence of a correlation between the spin magnitudes $\chi_1$ and $\chi_2$, though subsequent study is required to determine if this feature is statistically significant. The accompanying data release includes $\pistroke$ samples, which can be used to compare theoretical predictions to LVK data and to assess assumptions in parameterised models.
#### PeV particle acceleration and non-thermal emission in the `minimalist' model of the extended jets in W50/SS433

 - **Abstract**
 The W50 nebula around microquasar SS~433, powered by supercritical accretion, features two `extended jets' (tens of pc long and a few pc wide) from which polarized X-ray and very high energy radiation above 100 TeV is detected. Here we present a model of very high energy particle acceleration in these extended jets. In the `minimalist' model (discussed in Churazov, Khabibullin, and Bykov, 2024), a collimated outflow aligned with the rotation axis is propagating through a more isotropic wind produced by the accretion disk. The observed extended X-ray jets with bright knots in this model are associated with the formation of strong recollimation MHD shocks after the collision of the collimated outflow with the isotropic wind termination surface. The spectra of electrons and protons up to PeV energies are simulated with a nonlinear Monte Carlo model of diffusive shock acceleration with turbulent magnetic field amplification. The overall efficiency of the jets power transfer to accelerated protons in this model is above 10\% and about 0.5\% for electrons above 50 TeV. The magnetic field amplification by Bell's instability due to the electric current of cosmic rays escaping the accelerator produces highly anisotropic magnetic turbulence in the shock downstream. This results in the polarized synchrotron X-ray emission with the photon electric vector predominantly transverse to the jet direction and the degree of polarization above 20\%. The model is able to reproduce the observed spectra and intensity profiles of non-thermal X-ray and gamma-ray emission, which are both dominated by the leptonic radiation.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we conduct a linear stability analysis of magnetized and/or rotating jets propagating in ambient matter that is also magnetized and/or rotating, having in mind the application to the jet penetrating the core/envelope of a massive star. We solve the linearized magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) equations in the non-relativistic regime by Laplace transform in time and Fourier transform in space. In this formulation all unstable modes with the same translational and azimuthal wave numbers can be obtained simultaneously by searching for pole singularities in the complex plane. In order to determine unambiguously their driving mechanisms, we evaluate the second-order perturbation of the MHD Hamiltonian for individual eigenfunctions derived at these singular points. We identify in our non-rotating models the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) as one of the shear-driven modes and the current-driven instability such as the kink instability (KKI). In rotational models we also find the magnetorotational instability (MRI) as another shear-driven mode. In some cases, we find that a mode changes its character continuously from KKI to KHI (and vice versa) or from MRI to KHI as the jet velocity is increased.
#### Unified $g$-mode and $r$-mode Analysis of Accreting White Dwarf Stars

 - **Abstract**
 Dwarf novae are a subset of cataclysmic variables that accrete material intermittently in short-duration outbursts with sometimes long quiescent intervals in between. During the quiescent state, the white dwarf (WD) photosphere may be observable. Some of these systems show periodic variability consistent with a non-radial oscillation. Asteroseismology has become a unique tool for the measurement of internal structure of the WDs, such as their masses, radii, temperatures and rotation profiles. A few stable periodicities have been observed for accreting WDs, but the lack of complete and accurate theoretical models has hindered the real diagnosis of the observed pulsations. Though the associated pulsations in accreting WDs are thought to be $g$-modes, some work in the literature suggests that these pulsations could be Rossby modes ($r$-modes). Here, to elucidate this, we present a first simultaneous analysis of $g$- and $r$-mode pulsations in accreting white dwarfs including a full computation of visibility accounting for the distribution of variation over the WD surface. We show that, up to the second lowest degree ($\ell =2$), neither $g-$ nor $r$-modes have a clear advantage in visibility. Although a few retrograde $r$-mode orders exhibit a larger visibility, the low-order $g$ modes possess higher frequency in the star's frame, making them more likely to be driven within the convective driving scenario commonly applied to isolated WDs. Therefore, we favor a $g$-mode origin for the observed periods in accreting WDs, though $r$-modes will be important for stars with more observed modes.

 - **Abstract**
 We consider effects of the harmonic magnetic field boundary conditions at the top of the dynamo domain on the dynamo stability inside the solar convection zone. These boundary conditions allow us to quantify the helical properties of the coronal magnetic field that stems from the dynamo region. In sewing the tangential component of the mean electric field we are able to take into account the effect the diffusive properties of the stellar corona on the dynamo instability. The model shows that effect of the vacuum boundary conditions can be restored if we introduce a few orders of magnitude jump of the coronal magnetic field turbulent diffusion over its typical value at the top of the dynamo domain. The parameters of this jump define the critical instability threshold of the $\alpha$ effect in the $\alpha^{2}\Omega$ dynamo.

 - **Abstract**
 The coronal soft X-ray emission of cool stars, especially when taken in combination with their measured rotation periods, offers insights into their levels of magnetic activity and related transitions. We study the X-ray properties of low-mass members of the open cluster NGC 2516 to explicate their detailed dependencies on mass and rotation. We analysed the pointed SRG/eROSITA satellite observations of NGC 2516 obtained during the calibration and performance verification phase of the mission. We found 1561 X-ray sources within the field of view and related 1007 of them to their optical stellar counterparts, including 655 members of NGC 2516 (433 with rotation periods). We combined these detections with auxiliary optical data to facilitate their interpretation. Furthermore, we extracted X-ray spectra for all sources and fit two-component APEC models to them. To aid the analysis, we grouped stars with similar mass and rotational properties together, which allowed us to investigate the influence of rotation on various X-ray properties. The colour-activity diagram of NGC 2516 displays a general increase in the fractional X-ray luminosity with spectral type change from F through G and K to M-type. However, the behaviour of K-type stars, representing the ones that best sample the fast-to-slow rotational transition, is more complex, with both increased and decreased X-ray emission relative to G-type stars for fast and slow rotators, respectively. The rotation-activity diagram is analogous, with an identifiable desaturated group of X-ray emitters that corresponds to stars in the rotational gap between the fast and slow rotator sequences. We prefer to describe the normalised X-ray emission for all cluster stars as declining logarithmically with Rossby number over those using broken power laws. Coronal temperatures appear to be largely independent of mass or rotation. (abridged)

 - **Abstract**
 An approximate analytical solution for the rotating twisted magnetosphere of magnetars is presented. The poloidal flux is approximated by the self-similar twisted dipole field. The toroidal field is obtained by the minimum torque model. Under this approximation, it is found that: (1) The Y-point radius decreases with the increase of twist of the magnetic field. (2) The polar cap is larger for larger twist. (3) The particle outflow luminosity is larger for larger twist. (4) The maximum acceleration potential, pulse width of magnetar radio emission etc all increase with the twist. (5) For an untwisting magnetosphere, the physical properties general evolves towards that of the normal pulsars. The above findings are consistent with previous analytical and numerical results. The larger polar cap may corresponds to the hot spot during magnetar outburst. In general, a rotating twisted magnetosphere has larger open field line regions. The radio emission of magnetars and fast radio burst may both originates in the larger and evolving open field line regions of magnetars.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent discoveries of dust and molecular gas in quiescent galaxies (QGs) up to $z\sim3$ challenge the long-standing view that the interstellar medium depletes rapidly once star formation ceases, raising key questions of whether dust and gas co-evolve in QGs, and how their depletion links to stellar aging. We present deep Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band~6 continuum and CO(3--2) observations of 17 QGs at $z\sim0.4$ in the COSMOS field. Using the dust-to-molecular gas mass ratio ($\delta_{\rm DGR}$) as a key diagnostic, we trace post-quenching evolution of the cold interstellar medium. Our study triples the number of QGs with direct $\delta_{\rm DGR}$ estimates, constraining 12 systems with stellar population ages of $\sim$5--10 Gyr. For the first time, we show that $\delta_{\rm DGR}$ in QGs ranges from $\sim8\times$ below to $\sim2.5\times$ above the canonical value of $\delta_{\rm DGR}\sim1/100$. Despite uniformly low molecular gas fractions (median $f_{\rm H_2}=M_{\rm H_2}/M_{\star}\sim4.1\%$), QGs follow diverse evolutionary paths: about half exhibit rapid ($\sim700$ Myr) exponential dust decline with age, while the rest show mild decline over $\gtrsim$2 Gyr, maintaining elevated $\delta_{\rm DGR}\gtrsim1/100$. Our results support simulations predictions of dust and molecular gas evolving independently post-quenching, without a preferred quenching mode. This challenges the use of dust continuum as a $\rm H_2$ tracer, implying that quenching cannot be robustly linked to interstellar medium conditions when relying solely on dust or gas.

 We investigate the solar origin and heliospheric evolution of an intense geomagnetic storm that occurred on March 23-24, 2023. Despite multiple candidate CMEs observed between March 19-21, a weak CME detected on March 19 at 18:00 UT was identified as the cause, originating from the eruption of a longitudinal-filament channel near center of the sun. The channel underwent a smooth transition to eruption phase without detectable low coronal signatures. Wide-angle heliospheric imaging revealed asymmetric expansion and acceleration by solar wind drag, achieving an average CME velocity of $\approx$640 km/s. The radial evolution of the interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) was analyzed by three spacecraft in close radial alignment. Arrival times and propagation speeds were consistent across spacecraft, with a 21 hour delay between STEREO-A and WIND attributed to solar rotation and longitudinal separation. The ICME exhibits magnetic cloud (MC) signatures characterized by right-handed helicity, enhanced density at all three spacecraft. The MC underwent expansion (radial-size increases from 0.08AU at SolO to 0.18AU at STEREO-A), decrease in magnetic field strength with distance; $B_{av}\propto R_H^{-1.97}$ (SolO-STA) and $B_{av}\propto R_H^{-1.53}$ (SolO-WIND). The MC axis is inclined with the ecliptic at $-69^o$ at SolO, $-25^o$ at STA and $-34^o$ at WIND, indicating rotation during heliospheric transit. Importantly, the storm's main phase leads to a peak intensity ($SYM-H=-169$nT) occurring at 24/02:40UT followed by a second peak ($SYM-H=-170$nT) at 24/05:20UT due to density enhancement towards MC's tail. The study emphasizes the significant geoeffectiveness of weak, stealth CMEs with southward Bz and density enhancements.

 - **Abstract**
 X-ray burst oscillations are quasi-coherent periodic signals at frequencies close to the neutron star spin frequency. They are observed during thermonuclear Type I X-ray bursts from a number of low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) hosting a fast-spinning, weakly magnetic neutron star. Besides measuring the spin frequencies, burst oscillations hold the potential to accurately measure neutron star mass and radius, thus providing constraints on the equation of state of matter at nuclear densities. Based on far-ultraviolet (FUV) observations of the X-ray binary EXO 0748-676 taken with the Hubble Space Telescope in 2003, we report a possible indication of ultraviolet burst oscillations at the neutron star spin frequency ($\sim$552 Hz), potentially the first such case for an LMXB. The candidate signal is observed during an $\sim$8 s interval in the rising phase of an FUV burst, which occurred $\sim$4 s after a Type I X-ray burst. Through simulations, we estimated that the probability of detecting the observed signal power from pure random noise is 3.7$\%$, decreasing to 0.3$\%$ if only the burst rise interval is considered, during which X-ray burst oscillations had already been observed in this source. The background-subtracted folded pulse profile of the candidate FUV oscillations in the (120-160 nm) band is nearly sinusoidal with a $\sim$16$\%$ pulsed fraction, corresponding to a pulsed luminosity of $\sim$8$\times$10$^{33}$ erg/s. Interpreting the properties of this candidate FUV burst oscillations in the light of current models for optical-ultraviolet emission from neutron star LMXBs faces severe problems. If signals of this kind are confirmed in future observations, they might point to an unknown coherent emission process as the origin of the FUV burst oscillations observed in EXO 0748-676.

 - **Abstract**
 While the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) now allows identifying quiescent galaxies (QGs) out to early epochs, the photometric selection of quiescent galaxy candidates (QGCs) and the derivation of key physical quantities are highly sensitive to the assumed star-formation histories (SFHs). We aim to quantify how the inclusion of JWST/MIRI data and different SFH models impacts the selection and characterisation of QGCs. We test the robustness of the physical properties inferred from the spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, such as M*, age, star formation rate (SFR), and AV, and study how they impact the quiescence criteria of the galaxies across cosmic time. We perform SED fitting for ~13000 galaxies at z<6 from the CEERS/MIRI fields with up to 20 optical-mid infrared (MIR) broadband coverage. We implement three SFH prescriptions: flexible delayed, NonParametric, and extended Regulator. For each model, we compare results obtained with and without MIRI photometry and dust emission models. We evaluate the impact of these configurations on the number of candidate QGCs, selected based on rest UVJ colours, sSFR and main-sequence offset, and on their key physical properties such as M*, AV, and stellar ages. The number of QGCs selected varies significantly with the choice of SFH from 171 to 224 out of 13000 galaxies, depending on the model. This number increases to 222-327 when MIRI data are used (up to ~45% more QGCs). This enhancement is driven by improved constraints on dust attenuation and M*. We find a strong correlation between AV and M*, with massive galaxies (M*~10^11 M\odot) being 1.5-4.2 times more attenuated in magnitude than low-mass systems (M*~10^9 M\odot), depending on SFH. Regardless of the SFH assumption, ~13% of QGCs exhibit significant attenuation (AV > 0.5) in support of recent JWST studies challenging the notion that quiescent galaxies are uniformly dust-free.

 - **Abstract**
 While cosmic reionization has been broadly constrained by global observables, the interplay between internal sources (Milky Way, M31, and their satellites) and external ionization fronts remains poorly understood in a realistic Local Group (LG) context. To address this issue, we perform radiative transfer post-processing on the original HESTIA LG constrained simulation. We calibrate our source models using a uniform 1024^3 particle, dark-matter only, HESTIA simulation coupled with a subgrid collapse-fraction model to match the global reionization observables. These source models are then applied to the HESTIA zoom-in simulations, which consist of a 4096^3 particle effective resolution in the zoom region centered on the Milky Way (MW) and M31 haloes, which resolves haloes down to 10^8 solar masses. We find that in all scenarios, reionization within the LG proceeds in an inside-out manner with the progenitors of the MW and M31 having 50 percent of their material ionized by z ~ 9-8.6, significantly earlier than the global midpoint at z ~ 7-7.7, noting that external fronts from large-scale structure play a negligible role, even under the most permissive feedback model. We further show that present-day satellite galaxies exhibit only a weak correlation between their reionization redshift and their present-day radial distance from their host halo, with somewhat tighter trends around M31 than the MW. Finally, we find that satellites which assembled before reionization are systematically more massive today, suggesting that the oldest stellar populations preferentially reside in the most massive subhaloes.

 - **Abstract**
 Electromagnetic and gravitational-wave signals from neutron stars are shaped by rapid rotation and strong magnetic fields. Determining these properties is essential to interpret such signals, but current measurements are limited: rotation estimates rely on electromagnetic detections and assume uniform rotation, while inferring interior magnetic fields remains ambiguous due to a lack of direct observations. Measuring the excited fundamental modes of neutron stars in gravitational-wave signals offers a promising solution, as these modes encode information about stellar composition, structure, and dynamics. Previous studies have examined the individual effects of rotation and magnetic fields on these modes, identifying magnetic suppression and establishing linear relations for the frequencies of the fundamental $l=0$ quasi-radial mode $f_F$ and $l=2$ quadrupolar mode $f_{^2f}$. However, few have investigated the combined influence of rotation and magnetic fields. Here, for the first time, we consider both rotation and a toroidal magnetic field to construct linear relations for quantifying $f_F$ and $f_{^2f}$, showing that their combined effects can be constrained by detecting these modes. Using 2D axisymmetric simulations, we demonstrate that quasi-linear relations between $f_F$, $f_{^2f}$, stellar compactness $M/R$, and kinetic-to-binding energy ratio $T/|W|$ persist even with a toroidal magnetic field. The slope of these relations depends on the toroidal magnetization constant $K_\mathrm{m}$. Additionally, measuring the frequency ratio $f_{^2f}/f_F$ enables inference of $T/|W|$ and the maximum magnetic field strength $\mathcal{B}_\mathrm{max}$. Lastly, we show that differential rotation causes only minor deviations from predictions for uniform rotation. Thus, this work demonstrates that rotational and magnetic properties of neutron stars can be inferred from their fundamental modes.

 - **Abstract**
 Distance measurements using the planetary nebula luminosity function (PNLF) rely on the bright-end power-law cut-off magnitude ($M^*$), which is defined by a number of the [OIII]$\lambda5007$-brightest planetary nebulae (PNe). In early-type galaxies (ETGs), the formation of these PNe is enigmatic; the population is typically too old to form the expected $M^*$ PNe from single star evolution. We aim to give a solution to this problem. We selected five ETGs with known MUSE-PNLF distances. The MUSE instrument allows us to calculate the PNLF and consistently investigate the underlying stellar populations. Using stellar population synthesis, we derive the population age, star formation history, metallicity, and alpha abundance. We compare these parameters to the PNLF variables: $M^*$ and luminosity-specific PN number at the top 0.5 mag of the PNLF ($\alpha_{0.5}$). We also compare our results with PNe In Cosmological Simulations (PICS) model applied to Magneticum Pathfinder analogue galaxies. The average mass-weighted ages and metallicities of our observations are typically old ($9 <\mathrm{Age}< 13.5$ Gyr) and rather metal-rich ($-0.4 <\mathrm{[M/H]}< +0.2$). We find $M^*$ to be independent of age and metallicity in these ages and metallicity intervals. We discover a positive correlation between $\alpha_{0.5}$ values and the mass fraction of stellar population ages of 2--10 Gyr, implying that most of the PNe originate from stars with intermediate ages. Similar trends are also found in the PICS analogue galaxies. We show that the presence of at least $\sim 2\%$ of stellar mass younger than 10 Gyr is, in principle, sufficient to form the $M^*$ PNe in ETGs. We also present observing requirements for an ideal PNLF distance determination in ETGs.

 - **Abstract**
 The energy equilibrium between the corona and the underlying disk in a two-phase accretion flow sets a lower limit on the achievable photon index. A slab corona may not explain the hard state observations of X-ray binaries (XRBs). We incorporate energy feedback to the accretion disk resulting from illumination by an extended corona, and vice versa. The interaction between these two components allows for the possibility of finding an energetically self-consistent equilibrium solution for a given disk-corona system. We have upgraded the existing Monte Carlo radiative transfer code, MONK, to incorporate the interaction between the disk and the extended corona within the general relativistic framework. We introduce an albedo parameter to specify the fraction of the incident flux that is reflected by the disk, while the remainder is absorbed and added to the intrinsic dissipation. Reflection is modeled assuming a semi-infinite electron atmosphere. We find global equilibrium solutions by iterating interaction between disk and extended slab corona. A higher black hole spin, higher coronal temperature, and higher albedo all lead to harder spectra. For typical coronal temperatures and disk albedo, the lowest achievable photon index with a static slab corona fully covering the disk is approximately 1.7-1.8. With the upgraded version of MONK, we are now able to achieve global energy equilibrium for a given disk-corona system. This approach holds significant potential for constraining the coronal geometry using not only the observed flux but also polarization. A static slab does not appear to be a favorable coronal geometry for the hard state of XRBs, even when global energy balance is taken into account. In future work, we will explore truncated disk geometries and outflowing coronae as potential alternatives. (shortened)

 - **Abstract**
 High-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) are systems in which a neutron star or black hole accretes material from a massive companion. HMXBs are expected to have experienced a supernova in their evolution. The impulsive kick associated with this event should affect the space velocity of the system in a way that depends on the nature and state of the progenitor binary. Here, we test whether the different evolutionary histories of HMXBs have left a detectable imprint on their peculiar velocities ($V_{\rm pec}$). Using data from Gaia Data Release 3 (Gaia DR3), we first calculate the $V_{\rm pec}$ values for 63 well-known HMXBs hosting a black hole or neutron star and estimate the associated uncertainties via Monte Carlo re-sampling. We then analyse their distribution and check for differences between classes. Overall, $V_{\rm pec}$ estimates extend up to 100 km s$^{-1}$, but with Be/X-ray binaries (BeXRBs) favouring $V_{\rm pec}$ $\lesssim 40$ km s$^{-1}$ and supergiant X-ray binaries (SgXRBs) favouring $V_{\rm pec}$ $\gtrsim 40$ km s$^{-1}$. Based on a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test, the null hypothesis that the peculiar velocities of both classes are drawn from the same parent distribution can be robustly rejected, irrespective of the background stellar velocity dispersion. Tests with binary population synthesis demonstrate that SgXRBs typically have shorter orbital periods and higher fractional mass loss than BeXRBs at supernova. We argue that the magnitude of $V_{\rm pec}$ could be used as a complementary feature to distinguish between Be and supergiant systems. These findings extend previous inferences based on two-dimensional kinematics from Hipparcos, and may be explained by the differing nature of the respective progenitors systems between the source classes at the instant of supernova.

 - **Abstract**
 In anticipation of upcoming cosmological surveys, we use the large volume Flamingo hydrodynamical simulations to look for signatures of dynamical activity, focusing on the hot gas profiles of groups and clusters out to redshift $z=1$. To determine the dynamical state of each object, we consider the halo mass accretion rate, $\Gamma$, as well as three observational proxies: stellar mass gap, $\Mstar$; X-ray concentration, $c_\mathrm{x}$, and X-ray centroid shift, $\left<w\right>$. In general, the median values of these indicators vary in accordance with an increase in dynamical activity with both mass and redshift. We find $\left<w\right>$ to be the most reliable proxy, while $c_\mathrm{x}$ and $\Mstar$ are more sensitive to resolution and feedback model details. Looking at the profiles, the correlation between dark matter density and $\Gamma$ has a characteristic radial dependence, being negatively (positively) correlated at small (large) radii. This trend is insensitive to both halo mass and redshift. Similar behaviour is also seen for the hot gas densities in low redshift clusters, particularly when using $\left<w\right>$, but the correlations become weaker in groups, at higher redshift and when stronger feedback is employed. We also find the intrinsic scatter in the gas density profiles to decrease with redshift, particularly in groups, contrary to what is seen for the dark matter. Interestingly, the radius of minimum gas density scatter increases with feedback strength, suggesting that this property could be a useful feedback diagnostic in future observational studies.

 - **Abstract**
 The main accretion phase of protostars is characterized by the ejection of material in the form of jets/outflows. External UV irradiation can potentially have a significant impact on the excitation conditions within these outflows. High-resolution observations in the mid-infrared allow us to investigate the details of those energetic processes through the emission of shock-excited H$_2$ . Our aim is to spatially resolve H$_2$ and ionic/atomic emission within the outflows of low-mass protostars, and investigate its origin in connection to shocks influenced by external ultraviolet irradiation. We analyze spectral maps of 5 Class I protostars in the Ophiuchus molecular cloud from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MIRI/MRS). Four out of five protostars show strong H$_2$, [\ion{Ne}{II}], and [\ion{Fe}{II}] emission associated with outflows/jets. Pure rotational H$_2$ transitions from S(1) to S(8) are found and show two distinct temperature components on Boltzmann diagrams with rotational temperatures of $\sim$500-600 K and $\sim$1000-3000 K respectively. Both $C$-type shocks propagating at high pre-shock densities (n$_\text{H} \ge$10$^4$ cm$^{-3}$) and $J$-type shocks at low pre-shock densities (n$_\text{H} \le$10$^3$ cm$^{-3}$) reproduce the observed line ratios. However, only $C$-type shocks produce sufficiently high column densities of H$_2$, whereas predictions from a single $J$-type shock reproduce the observed rotational temperatures of the gas better. A combination of various types of shocks could play a role in protostellar outflows as long as UV irradiation is included in the models. The origin of this radiation is likely internal, since no significant differences in the excitation conditions of outflows are seen at various locations in the cloud.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy evolution theories require co-evolution between accreting supermassive black holes (SMBH) and galaxies to explain many properties of the local galaxy population, yet observational evidence for the mechanisms driving this co-evolution is lacking. The recent star-formation histories of the host galaxies of accreting SMBHs (Active Galactic Nuclei, AGNs) can help constrain the processes that feed SMBHs and halt star formation in galaxies, but are difficult to obtain for the most luminous AGNs (quasars). We introduce Mean-Field Independent Component Analysis (MFICA) to decompose quasar spectra and obtain recent star formation histories of their host galaxies. Applying MFICA to quasar spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR7 Quasar Catalogue in the redshift range $0.16 \leq z \leq 0.76$, we find that 53 per cent of quasar host galaxies are star-forming, 17 per cent lie in the green-valley, while only 5 per cent are quiescent. This contrasts with 14, 11, and 74 per cent of a mass-matched control sample that are star-forming, green-valley, and quiescent, respectively. We find that $\sim25$ per cent of quasars are hosted by post-starburst galaxies, an excess of $28\pm1$ compared to our control sample. While the heterogeneity of recent star formation histories implies multiple SMBH feeding mechanisms, the excess of post-starburst host galaxies demonstrates the link between accreting SMBHs and a recent starburst followed by rapid quenching. Given that massive post-starburst galaxies are predominantly caused by gas-rich major mergers, our results indicate that $30-50$ per cent of quasars originate from merger-induced starbursts.

 The planned IceCube-Gen2 radio neutrino detector at the South Pole will enhance the detection of cosmic ultra-high-energy neutrinos. It is crucial to utilize the available time until construction to optimize the detector design. A fully differentiable pipeline, from signal generation to detector response, would allow for the application of gradient descent techniques to explore the parameter space of the detector. In our work, we focus on the aspect of signal generation, and propose a modularized deep learning architecture to generate radio signals from in-ice neutrino interactions conditioned on the shower energy and viewing angle. The model is capable of generating differentiable signals with amplitudes spanning multiple orders of magnitude, as well as consistently producing signals corresponding to the same underlying event for different viewing angles. The modularized approach ensures physical consistency of the samples and leads to advantageous computational properties when using the model as part of a bigger optimization pipeline.

 - **Abstract**
 Jets from accreting black hole (BH) X-ray binaries (XRBs) are powerful outflows that release a large fraction of the accretion energy to the surrounding environment, providing a feedback mechanism that may alter the interstellar medium (ISM) properties. Studying accretion and feedback together enables estimates of matter and energy input/output around accreting BHs. We focus on the extended jet structures of the BH-XRB GRS1758-258. First seen in VLA data, these parsec-scale jets arise from jet-ISM interaction and show a Z-shaped morphology. Using the MeerKAT telescope we observed GRS1758-258 in L-band for a total exposure of 7 hr. Applying a calorimetry-based method developed for AGN and later used for XRBs, we estimated the properties of the jets and of the surrounding ISM. We detect a jet and counter-jet terminating in bow-shocks. Within the northern jet lobe we identify synchrotron and bremsstrahlung emission, while the southern lobe is dominated by thermal emission. We measure ISM densities between 10-40 cm-3 across both jets, slightly lower in the northern region. The estimated ages of the two lobes range from 6-51 kyr. The time-averaged jet power lies between 4.4x10^33 and 3.3x10^36 erg/s, with differences between north and south likely due to different local ISM conditions. Comparing new MeerKAT with archival VLA data, we measured a proper motion of 130 mas/yr in a portion of the northern jet. Jet-ISM interaction structures on both sides of GRS1758-258 reveal different ISM properties. The comparison between these structures and those from other XRBs suggests that the lobes in GRS1758-258 are younger and may result from different jet activity phases. The time-averaged energy transferred to the environment is slightly lower than in other XRBs, consistent with the younger age of the lobes in GRS1758-258 relative to those of other systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Because they are likely to accrete substantial amounts of interstellar gas, merging supermassive binary black holes are expected to be strong multimessenger sources, radiating gravitational waves, photons from thermal gas, and photons from relativistic electrons energized by relativistic jets. Here we report on a numerical simulation that covers the late inspiral, merger, and initial postmerger phase of such a system where both black holes have the same mass and spin, and both spin axes are parallel to the orbital angular momentum. The simulation incorporates both 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics and numerical relativity. The thermal photon power during the late inspiral, merger, and immediate postmerger phases is drawn from strong shocks rather than dissipation of turbulence inside a smoothly structured accretion disk as typically found around accreting single black holes. We find that the thermal photon and jet Poynting flux outputs are closely related in time, and we posit a mechanism that enforces this relation. The power radiated in both photons and jets diminishes gradually as merger is approached, but jumps sharply at merger to a noisy plateau. Such a distinct lightcurve should aid efforts to identify supermassive black hole mergers, with or without accompanying gravitational wave detections.

 - **Abstract**
 As the compact binary catalog continues to grow rapidly, developing and refining tests to probe the nature of compact objects is essential for a comprehensive understanding of both the observed data and the underlying astrophysics of the binary population. We investigate the effectiveness of spin-induced multipole moments (SIQM) and tidal deformability measurements in distinguishing lower mass-gap black hole (BH) binaries from non-BH binaries with different mass and spin configurations. We perform model-agnostic tests on binary BH (BBH) simulations using full Bayesian inference, evaluating the independent and joint measurability of SIQM and tidal parameters across the parameter space. We extend the analysis to simulations of self-interacting spinning boson stars, using synthetic signals that exhibit (a) both SIQM and tidal effects and (b) each effect individually. For case (a), recovery is performed using (i) a BBH model, (ii) a model incorporating both SIQM and tidal effects, and (iii) models including either SIQM or tidal effects. For case (b), we employ (i) a BBH model and (ii) models incorporating either SIQM or tidal effects, consistent with the injection. Simulations employ TaylorF2 waveform model and consider binaries in the low mass gap with varying spin magnitudes. We find that employing an incorrect model to analyze the signal can lead to biases in parameter inference. Notably, when analyzing a simulated binary boson star-like signal with component masses $\rm{(4, 4) \, M_{\odot}}$ using a BBH model, the system is incorrectly identified as having masses $\rm{(8, 2) \, M_{\odot}}$. In contrast, using the correct recovery model that includes both SIQM and tidal deformability effects successfully recovers the true masses, highlighting the significance of waveform model accuracy in performing reliable distinguishability tests for compact objects in the low-mass gap.

We confront the uncertain landscape by jointly analyzing new measurements of the gas distribution around groups and clusters -- DESI+ACT kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect profiles and eROSITA X-ray gas masses -- with mean halo masses characterized by galaxy-galaxy lensing. Across a wide range of halo masses ($M_{500}=10^{13-14}M_\odot$) and redshifts ($0<z<1$), we find evidence of more efficient gas expulsion beyond several $R_{500}$ than predicted by most state-of-the-art simulations. A like-with-like comparison reveals all kSZ and X-ray observations are inconsistent with the fiducial 1 Gpc$^{3}$ hydrodynamical FLAMINGO simulation, which was calibrated to reproduce pre-eROSITA X-ray gas fractions: eROSITA X-ray gas fractions are $2\times$ lower than the simulation, and the kSZ measurements are combined $>8 \sigma$ discrepant. The FLAMINGO simulation variant with the most gas expulsion, and therefore the most suppression of the matter power spectrum relative to a dark matter only simulation, provides a good description of how much gas is expelled and how far it extends; the enhanced gas depletion is achieved by more powerful but less frequent AGN outbursts. Joint kSZ, X-ray, and lensing measurements form a consistent picture of gas expulsion beyond several $R_{500}$, implying a more suppressed matter power spectrum than predicted by most recent simulations. Complementary observables and next-generation simulations are critical to understanding the physical mechanism behind this extreme gas expulsion and mapping its impact on the large-scale matter distribution.
