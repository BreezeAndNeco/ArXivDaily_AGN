 - **Abstract**
 Gyrochronology is a technique for constraining stellar ages using rotation periods, which change over a star's main sequence lifetime due to magnetic braking. This technique shows promise for main sequence FGKM stars, where other methods are imprecise. However, models have historically struggled to capture the observed rotational dispersion in stellar populations. To properly understand this complexity, we have assembled the largest standardized data catalog of rotators in open clusters to date, consisting of ~7,400 stars across 30 open clusters/associations spanning ages of 1.5 Myr to 4 Gyr. We have also developed ChronoFlow: a flexible data-driven model which accurately captures observed rotational dispersion. We show that ChronoFlow can be used to accurately forward model rotational evolution, and to infer both cluster and individual stellar ages. We recover cluster ages with a statistical uncertainty of 0.06 dex ($\approx$ 15%), and individual stellar ages with a statistical uncertainty of 0.7 dex. Additionally, we conducted robust systematic tests to analyze the impact of extinction models, cluster membership, and calibration ages on our model's performance. These contribute an additional $\approx$ 0.06 dex of uncertainty in cluster age estimates, resulting in a total error budget of 0.08 dex. We estimate ages for the NGC 6709 open cluster and the Theia 456 stellar stream, and calculate revised rotational ages for M34, NGC 2516, NGC 1750, and NGC 1647. Our results show that ChronoFlow can precisely estimate the ages of coeval stellar populations, and constrain ages for individual stars. Furthermore, its predictions may be used to inform physical spin down models. ChronoFlow will be publicly available at this https URL.
#### The redshift dependence of the inferred $H_0$ in a local void solution to the Hubble tension

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy number counts suggest that we are located within the Gpc-scale KBC void. The Hubble tension might arise due to gravitationally driven outflow from this void, as explored in detail by Haslbauer et al. We explore how the impact of the void on redshift decays at large distances. We define $H_0(z)$ as the present expansion rate $H_0$ that would be inferred from observations in a narrow redshift range centred on $z$. We find $H_0(z)$ in three different ways, all of which give similar results. We then compare these results with the observations of Jia et al., who were careful to minimise the impact of correlations between $H_0$ measurements from data in different redshift bins. We find reasonable agreement with their results for the Gaussian and Exponential void underdensity profiles, although the agreement is less good in the Maxwell-Boltzmann case. The latter profile causes severe disagreement with the observed bulk flow curve at $z < 0.1$ (Mazurenko et al.), so the tension with higher redshift data further highlights that the deepest part of the KBC void is probably near its centre. The observations show a decline of $H_0(z)$ towards the background $Planck$ value in qualitative agreement with the considered models, even if we use a larger void. The good overall agreement with the recent results of Jia et al. suggests that the local supervoid evident from the galaxy luminosity density out to a Gpc might also solve the Hubble tension while retaining a low background $H_0$ consistent with $Planck$ data, assuming enhanced structure formation on $>100$ Mpc scales.

 - **Abstract**
 Each supernova's energy drives interstellar medium (ISM) turbulence and can help launch galactic winds. What difference does it make if $10\%$ of the energy is initially deposited into cosmic rays? To answer this question and study cosmic-ray feedback, we perform galactic patch simulations of a stratified ISM. We compare two magnetohydrodynamic and cosmic ray (MHD+CR) simulations, which are identical except for how each supernova's energy is injected. In one, $10\%$ of the energy is injected as cosmic-ray energy and the rest is thermal. In the other case, energy injection is strictly thermal. We find that cosmic-ray injections (1) drive a faster vertical motion with more mass, (2) produce a more vertically oriented magnetic field, and (3) increase the scale height of warm gas outside the midplane $(z \gtrsim 0.5\,\mathrm{kpc})$. Both simulations show the formation of cold clouds (with a total mass fraction $>50\%$) through the Parker instability and thermal instability. We also show that the Parker instability leads to a decorrelation of cosmic-ray pressure and gas density. Finally, our simulations show that a vertical magnetic field can lead to a significant decrease in the calorimetric fraction for injected cosmic rays.
#### A unique window into the Epoch of Reionisation: A double-peaked Lyman-$\alpha$ emitter in the proximity zone of a quasar at $z\sim 6.6$

 - **Abstract**
 We present a study of a double-peaked Ly$\alpha$ emitter, named LAE-11, found in the proximity zone of QSO J0910-0414 at $z\sim6.6$. We use a combination of deep photometric data from Subaru Telescope, HST, and JWST with spectroscopic data from Keck/DEIMOS, NIRCam WFSS and NIRSpec MSA to characterise the ionising and general properties of the galaxy, as well as the quasar environment surrounding it. We detect Ly$\alpha$, H$\beta$, [OIII] doublet, and H$\alpha$ emission lines in the various spectral datasets. The presence of a double-peaked Ly$\alpha$ line in the spectrum allows us to characterise the opening angle and lifetime of the QSO as $\theta_Q>49.62$° and $t_Q > 3.8\times10^5$ years. LAE-11 is a fairly bright (M$_\rm{UV} = -19.84^{+0.14}_{-0.16}$), blue galaxy with a UV slope of $\beta = -2.61^{+0.06}_{-0.08}$. Since the galaxy is located in a quasar-ionised region, we have a unique opportunity to measure the escape fraction of Lyman Continuum photons using the un-attenuated double-peaked Ly$\alpha$ emission profile and its equivalent width at such high redshift. We employ diagnostics which do not rely on the detection of Ly$\alpha$ for comparison, and find that all tracers of ionising photon leakage agree within 1$\sigma$ uncertainty. We measure a moderate escape of Lyman Continuum photons from LAE-11 of $f_\rm{esc}^\rm{LyC} = (8 - 33)\%$. Detections of both H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ emission lines allow for separate measurements of the ionising photon production efficiency, resulting with $\log(\xi_\rm{ion}/\rm{Hz~erg^{-1}}) = 25.59\pm0.08$ and $25.65\pm0.09$, for H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$, respectively. The total ionising output of LAE-11, $\log(f_\rm{esc}^\rm{LyC}\xi_\rm{ion, H\alpha}/\rm{Hz~erg^{-1}}) = 24.85^{+0.24}_{-0.34}$, is higher than the value of $24.3 - 24.8$ which is traditionally assumed as needed to drive Reionisation forward.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar superflares are energetic outbursts of electromagnetic radiation, similar to solar flares but releasing more energy, up to $10^{36}$ erg on main sequence stars. It is unknown whether the Sun can generate superflares, and if so, how often they might occur. We used photometry from the Kepler space observatory to investigate superflares on other stars with Sun-like fundamental parameters. We identified 2889 superflares on 2527 Sun-like stars, out of 56450 observed. This detection rate indicates that superflares with energies $>10^{34}$ erg occur roughly once per century on stars with Sun-like temperature and variability. The resulting stellar superflare frequency-energy distribution is consistent with an extrapolation of the Sun's flare distribution to higher energies, so we suggest that both are generated by the same physical mechanism.

 - **Abstract**
 Binary neutron star mergers and collapsing massive stars can both create millisecond magnetars. Such magnetars are candidate engines to power gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The non-thermal light curve of the resulting transients can exhibit multiple components, including: the GRB afterglow, pulsar wind nebula (PWN), and ejecta afterglow. We derive the timescales for the peak of each component and show that the PWN is detectable at radio frequencies, dominating the emission for $\sim$ 6 years for supernova/long GRBs (SN/LGRBs) and $\sim$ 100 days for kilonova/short GRBs (KN/SGRBs) at 1 GHz, and $\sim$ 1 year for SN/LGRBs and $\sim$ 15 days for KN/SGRBs at 100 GHz. The PWN emission has an exponential, frequency-dependent rise to peak that cannot be replicated by an ejecta afterglow. We show that PWNe in SN/LGRBs can be detected out to $z \sim 0.06$ with current instruments and $z \sim 0.3$ with next-generation instruments and PWNe in KN/SGRBs can be detected out to $z \sim 0.3$ with current instruments and $z \sim 1.5$ with next-generation instruments. We find that the optimal strategy for detecting PWNe in these systems is a multi-band, high cadence radio follow-up of nearby KN/SGRBs with an x-ray plateau or extended prompt emission from 10 - 100 days post-burst.

 - **Abstract**
 One of the central challenges in modern cosmology is understanding the nature of dark energy and its evolution throughout the history of the Universe. Dark energy is commonly modeled as a perfect fluid with a time-varying equation-of-state parameter, w(z), often modeled under CPL parametrization using two parameters $w_0$ and $w_a$. In this study, we explore both parametric and non-parametric methods to reconstruct the dark energy Equation of State (EoS) using Gravitational Wave (GW) sources, with and without electromagnetic (EM) counterparts called as bright sirens and dark sirens respectively. In the parametric approach, we extend the widely used $w_0$-$w_a$ model by introducing an additional term, $w_b$, to better capture the evolving dynamics of dark energy up to high redshift which is accessible from GW sources. This extension provides increased flexibility in modeling the EoS and enables a more detailed investigation of dark energy's evolution. Our analysis indicates that, with five years of observation time and a $75\%$ duty cycle using Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope, it will be possible to measure the dark energy EoS with remarkable precision better than any other cosmological probes in the coming years from bright standard sirens using multi-messenger avenue. These findings highlight the potential of GW observations in synergy with EM telescopes to offer valuable insights into the nature of dark energy, overcoming the current limitations in cosmological measurements.
#### Investigation of the Nature of the B[e] Star CI Cam in the Optical Range

 - **Abstract**
 We report the results of 24 years of photometric and spectroscopic monitoring of CI Cam since its outburst in 1998. In the early years of our research, we identified a system component responsible for the emission of the He II 4686 line, which moves in an elliptical orbit with a period of 19.407 days and an eccentricity from 0.44 to 0.49. Variations in optical brightness with the same period were observed, with an average amplitude of 0.04 magnitudes. The total amplitude of the He II radial velocity variations was approximately 380 kilometers per second. The equivalent width of the line varied on timescales of tens of minutes as well as with the orbital period, reaching maximum values when the companion passed the descending node of the orbit. The intensity of the He II 4686 emission has gradually increased over time. Our photometric monitoring revealed pulsations of the main B component of the CI Cam system. Between 2005 and 2009, the B star exhibited multiperiodic pulsations, however, since 2012, it pulsated in a single mode. We interpret the pulsations from 2005 to 2009 as a resonance of radial modes, with the residual stable mode being the first overtone. The pulsations are coherent over several months, with average amplitudes from 0.02 to 0.04 magnitudes in the V band. The pulsation data constrain the spectral type of the primary component of B0 to B2 III, the distance to the system from 2.5 to 4.5 kpc. The classification of the main component of CI Cam as a supergiant is ruled out due to the observed pulsation periods. CI Cam is likely in the stage after the first mass exchange and may belong to the FS CMa-type objects.

 - **Abstract**
 We describe the development of the Keck Observatory Archive (KOA) Data Discovery Service, a web-based dashboard that returns metadata for wide-area queries of the entire archive in seconds. Currently in beta, this dashboard will support exploration, visualization, and data access across multiple instruments. This effort is underpinned by an open-source, VO-compliant query infrastructure and will offer services that can be hosted on web pages or in Jupyter notebooks. The effort also informs the design of a new, modern landing page that meets the expectations of accessibility and ease of use. The new query infrastructure is based on nexsciTAP, a component-based, DBMS-agnostic Python implementation of the IVOA Table Access Protocol, developed at NExScI and integrated into the NASA Exoplanet Archive and the NEID Archive, and into the PyKOA Python client. This infrastructure incorporates R-tree spatial indexing, built as memory-mapped files as part of Montage, a software toolkit used to create composite astronomical images. Although R-trees are used most often in geospatial analysis, here they enable searches of the entire KOA archive, an eclectic collection of 100 million records of imaging and spectroscopic data, in 2 seconds, and they speed up spatial searches by x20. The front end is built on the open-source Plotly-Dash framework, which allows users to build an interactive user interface based on a single Python file.

 - **Abstract**
 Using archival Hubble Space Telescope observations, we report the discovery of four variable low-mass white dwarfs ($0.18 \, M_\odot \leq M \leq 0.5 \,M_\odot$) in the globular cluster NGC 6397. One source exhibits a periodic optical modulation of $5.21 \pm 0.02$ hours, which we interpret as potentially due to the rotation of a magnetic helium core WD (He WD). This makes this candidate the second magnetic He WD in NGC 6397, and one of the few He WDs with a measured rotation period. The other three candidates show aperiodic variability, with a change in magnitude ranging from $\sim 0.11-0.6$. These discoveries highlight the importance of high-cadence photometric surveys in dense stellar environments. Follow-up spectroscopic observations are needed to confirm the nature of the variability of these systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast radio bursts (FRBs), especially those from repeating sources, exhibit a rich variety of morphologies in their dynamic spectra (or waterfalls). Characterizing these morphologies and spectro-temporal properties is a key strategy in investigating the underlying unknown emission mechanism of FRBs. This type of analysis has been typically accomplished using two-dimensional Gaussian techniques and the autocorrelation function (ACF) of the waterfall. These techniques suffer from high uncertainties when applied to recently observed ultra-FRBs: FRBs that are only a few microseconds long. We present a technique that involves the tagging of per-channel arrival times of an FRB to perform sub-burst slope measurements. This technique leverages the number of frequency channels and can increase the precision of sub-burst slope measurements by several orders of magnitude, allowing it to be easily applied to ultra-FRBs and microshot forests. While scattering and dispersion remain important and often dominating sources of uncertainty in measurements, this technique provides an adaptable and firm foundation for obtaining spectro-temporal properties from all kinds of FRB morphologies. We present measurements using this technique of several hundred bursts across 12 repeating sources, including over 400 bursts from the repeating sources FRB 20121102A, FRB 20220912A, and FRB 20200120E, all of which exhibit microsecond-long FRBs, as well as 136 drift rates. In addition to retrieving the known relationship between sub-burst slope and duration, we explore other correlations between burst properties. We find that ultra-FRBs obey the sub-burst slope law along with longer duration bursts, and appear to form a distinct population in the duration-frequency relation.
#### Testing Colour-magnitude Pattern as A Method in the Search for Changing-Look AGNs

 - **Abstract**
 We develop a simple method to search for changing-look (CL) active galactic nucleus (AGN) candidates, and conduct a test run. In this method, optical variations of AGNs are monitored and CL-AGNs may appear to have a pattern of being bluer when in brightening flare-like events. Applying this method, previously-classified type 2 AGNs that show the bluer-when-brighter (BWB) pattern are selected. Among more than ten thousands type 2 AGNs classified in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we find 73 candidates with possibly the strongest BWB pattern. We note that 13 of them have previously been reported as CL-AGNs. We have observed nine candidates, and found that five among them showed the CL transition from type 2 to type 1. In addition, we also test extending the selection to previously-classified type 1 AGNs in the SDSS by finding sources with a possible redder-when-brighter pattern, but none of the three sources observed by us is found to show the transition from type 1 to type 2. We discuss the variation properties in both the success and failure cases, and plan to observe more candidates selected with the method. From the observational results, a detailed comparison between the CL-AGNs and none CL-AGNs will help quantitatively refine the selection criteria and in turn allow us to configure the general properties of CLAGNs.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we perform 3D magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations of filamentary molecular clouds. We then generate synthetic observations based on the simulation results. Using these, we investigate how the new polarization data analysis method recently introduced by \citet{2021ApJ...923L...9D} reflects the magnetic field structure in turbulent filamentary molecular clouds. \citet{2021ApJ...923L...9D} proposed that the $R_{\rm{FWHM}}$, the ratio of the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of the polarized intensity ($PI$) to that of the total intensity ($I$) can be used to probe the three-dimensional structure of the magnetic field. We calculate the $R_{\rm{FWHM}}$ from the density and magnetic field structure obtained in the 3D-MHD simulations. We find that the mean and variance of $R_{\rm{FWHM}}$ within a filament are smaller and larger, respectively, with a larger inclination of the magnetic field to the plane-of-sky. We also find that both small-scale ($<0.1~\rm{pc}$) and large-scale ($\gtrsim 0.1~\rm{pc}$) turbulence affect the polarized intensity of the dust thermal emission. We conclude that future extensive observations of $R_{\rm{FWHM}}$ may be able to quantify the inclination of the magnetic field to the plane-of-sky in the filamentary molecular clouds.

 - **Abstract**
 The current generation of large galaxy surveys will test the cosmological model by combining multiple types of observational probes. Realising the statistical promise of these new datasets requires rigorous attention to all aspects of analysis including cosmological measurements, modelling, covariance and parameter likelihood. In this paper we present the results of an end-to-end simulation study designed to test the analysis pipeline for the combination of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Year 1 galaxy redshift dataset and separate weak gravitational lensing information from the Kilo-Degree Survey, Dark Energy Survey and Hyper-Suprime-Cam Survey. Our analysis employs the 3x2-pt correlation functions including cosmic shear and galaxy-galaxy lensing, together with the projected correlation function of the spectroscopic DESI lenses. We build realistic simulations of these datasets including galaxy halo occupation distributions, photometric redshift errors, weights, multiplicative shear calibration biases and magnification. We calculate the analytical covariance of these correlation functions including the Gaussian, noise and super-sample contributions, and show that our covariance determination agrees with estimates based on the ensemble of simulations. We use a Bayesian inference platform to demonstrate that we can recover the fiducial cosmological parameters of the simulation within the statistical error margin of the experiment, investigating the sensitivity to scale cuts. This study is the first in a sequence of papers in which we present and validate the large-scale 3x2-pt cosmological analysis of DESI-Y1.

 - **Abstract**
 This review article summarizes two decades of laboratory research aimed at understanding the dynamics of accretion disks, with particular emphasis on magnetohydrodynamic experiments involving liquid metals and plasmas. First, the Taylor-Couette experiments demonstrated the generation of magnetorotational instability (MRI) in liquid metals, and highlighted how this instability is critically influenced by boundary conditions and the geometry of the applied magnetic field. These experiments also highlight the nonlinear transition to turbulence in accretion disks, and their link with other MHD instabilities in centrifugally-stable flows. A complementary approach, involving laboratory experiments with volumetric fluid driving rather than rotating boundaries, enables a quantitative study of angular momentum transport by Keplerian turbulence. Collectively, these various laboratory studies offer new constraints on the theoretical models designed to explain the dynamics of accretion disks. This is particularly true with regard to the role of Keplerian turbulence in protoplanetary disks, where recent observations from the ALMA telescope have considerably revised previously expected values of the magnitude of the turbulent fluctuations. Finally, the paper discusses outstanding questions and future prospects in laboratory modeling of accretion disks.
#### Probing Environmental Dependence of High-Redshift Galaxy Properties with the Marked Correlation Function

 - **Abstract**
 In hierarchical structure formation, correlations between galaxy properties and their environments reveal important clues about galaxy evolution, emphasizing the importance of measuring these relationships. We probe the environmental dependence of Lyman-break galaxy (LBG) properties in the redshift range of $3$ to $5$ using marked correlation function statistics with galaxy samples from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program and the Canada--France--Hawaii Telescope U-band surveys. We find that the UV magnitude and color of magnitude-selected LBG samples are strongly correlated with their environment, making these properties effective tracers of it. In contrast, the star formation rate and stellar mass of LBGs exhibit a weak environmental dependence. For UV magnitudes and color, the correlation is stronger in brighter galaxy samples across all redshifts and extends to scales far beyond the size of typical dark matter halos. This suggests that within a given sample, LBGs with high UV magnitudes or colors are more likely to form pairs at these scales than predicted by the two-point angular correlation function. Moreover, the amplitude of the marked correlation function is generally higher for LBG samples compared to that of $z \sim 0$ galaxies from previous this http URL also find that for LBG samples selected by the same absolute threshold magnitude or average halo mass, the correlation between UV magnitudes and the environment generally becomes more pronounced as the redshift decreases. On the other hand, for samples with the same effective large-scale bias at $z\sim 4$ and $5$, the marked correlation functions are similar on large scales.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents a deep MIRI/JWST medium resolution spectroscopy (MRS) covering the rest-frame optical spectrum of the GN-z11 galaxy. The [OIII]5008 and H$\alpha$ emission lines are detected and spectroscopically resolved. The line profiles are well-modeled by a narrow Gaussian component with intrinsic FWHMs of 189$\pm$25 and 231$\pm$52 kms$^{-1}$, respectively. We do not find any evidence of a dominant broad H$\alpha$ emission line component tracing a Broad Line Region in a type 1 active galactic nuclei (AGN). However, a broad ($\sim$430-470 kms$^{-1}$) and weak ($<$ 20-30%) H$\alpha$ line component, tracing a minor AGN contribution in the optical, cannot be ruled out completely with the sensitivity of the present data. The physical and excitation properties of the ionized gas are consistent with a low-metallicity starburst forming stars at a rate of SFR(H$\alpha$)$=$24 $\pm$3$M_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$. The electron temperature of the ionized gas is $T_{\mathrm{e}}$(O$^{++}$)$=$14000$\pm$2100K, while the direct-$T_{\mathrm{e}}$ gas-phase metallicity is 12+$\log$(O/H)$=$7.91$\pm$0.07 (Z=0.17$\pm$0.03Z$_{\odot}$). The optical line ratios locate GN-z11 in the starburst or AGN region but more consistent with those of local low-metallicity starbursts and high-$z$ luminous galaxies detected at redshifts similar to GN-z11. We conclude that the MRS optical spectrum of GN-z11 is consistent with that of a massive, compact, and low-metallicity starburst galaxy. Due to its high SFR and stellar mass surface densities, close to that of the densest stellar clusters, we speculate that GN-z11 could be undergoing a feedback-free, highly efficient starburst phase. Additional JWST data are needed to validate this scenario, and other recently proposed alternatives, to explain the existence of bright compact galaxies in the early Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 The Gamma-ray detection from an astrophysical object indicates the presence of an extreme environment where high-energy radiation is produced. With the continuous monitoring of the Gamma-ray sky by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT), leading to deeper sensitivity, the high-energy Gamma-ray emission has now been detected from a diverse class of jetted active galactic nuclei (AGN). Here, we present the results of a multiwavelength study of the radio source DA~362, which was reported to be a blazar candidate of uncertain type. However, it was recently identified as a bona fide compact symmetric object (CSO) based on its sub-kpc, bi-polar radio morphology, and lack of radio variability. This makes DA~362 the only fourth Gamma-ray emitting object of this enigmatic class of radio-loud AGN. Using five very long baseline interferometry observations covering 1996-2018, we found the jet separation velocity to be subluminal ($v_{\rm app}\sim 0.2c$), thus supporting its CSO nature. Its Fermi-LAT observations revealed a Gamma-ray flaring activity, a phenomenon never detected from the other three Gamma-ray detected CSOs. This object is bright in the near-infrared band but extremely faint in the optical-ultraviolet filters, hinting at possible obscuration. The Swift X-Ray Telescope observation of DA 362 reveals an extremely hard X-ray spectrum, though a strong claim cannot be made due to large uncertainties. We conclude that deeper observations are needed to probe the broadband properties of this enigmatic object and to understand the origin of high-energy Gamma-ray emission.

 - **Abstract**
 Among solar system objects, comets coming from the Oort Cloud are an elusive population, intrinsically rare and difficult to detect. Nonetheless, as the more pristine objects we can observe, they encapsulate critical cues on the formation of planetary systems and are the focus of many scientific investigations and science missions. The Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), which will start to operate from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in 2025, is expected to dramatically improve our detection ability of these comets by performing regular monitoring of the Southern sky deep down to magnitude 24.5 with excellent astrometry. However, making straightforward predictions on future LSST detection rates is challenging due to our biased knowledge of the underlying population. This is because identifications to date have been conducted by various surveys or individual observers, often without detailed information on their respective selection functions. Recent efforts to predict incoming flux of Long Period Comets still suffer of the lack of systematic, well-characterized, homogeneous cometary surveys. Here, we adopt a different point of view by asking how much earlier~on known comets on long-period or hyperbolic orbits would have been discovered by a LSST-like survey if it was already in place 10 years prior to their perihelion epoch. In this case, we are not simulating a real flux of incoming comet, as all comets in our sample reach the perihelion simultaneously, but we can analyze the impact of a LSST-like survey on individual objects. We find that LSST would have found about 40% of comets in our sample at least 5 years prior to their perihelion epoch, and at double (at least) the distance at which they were actually discovered. Based on this approach, we find that LSST has the potentiality to at least twofold the current discovery rate of long-period and hyperbolic comets.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed analysis of AT 2020nov, a tidal disruption event (TDE) in the center of its host galaxy, located at a redshift of $z = 0.083$. AT 2020nov exhibits unique features, including double-peaked Balmer emission lines, a broad UV/optical flare, and a peak log luminosity in the extreme ultra-violet (EUV) estimated at $\sim$$45.66^{+0.10}_{-0.33} \; \mathrm{erg} \, \mathrm{s^{-1}}$. A late-time X-ray flare was also observed, reaching an absorbed luminosity of $1.67 \times 10^{43} \; \mathrm{erg} \, \mathrm{s^{-1}}$ approximately 300 days after the UV/optical peak. Multi-wavelength coverage, spanning optical, UV, X-ray, and mid-infrared (MIR) bands, reveals a complex spectral energy distribution (SED) that includes MIR flaring indicative of dust echoes, suggesting a dust covering fraction consistent with typical TDEs. Spectral modeling indicates the presence of an extended, quiescent disk around the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) with a radius of $\sim$$5.06^{+0.59}_{-0.77} \times 10^4 \; \mathrm{R_g}$. The multi-component SED model, which includes a significant EUV component, suggests that the primary emission from the TDE is reprocessed by this extended disk, producing the observed optical and MIR features. The lack of strong AGN signatures in the host galaxy, combined with the quiescent disk structure, highlights AT 2020nov as a rare example of a TDE occurring in a galaxy with a dormant but extended pre-existing accretion structure.

 - **Abstract**
 Stars are unique bodies of the Universe where self-gravity compress matter to such high temperature and density that several nuclear fusion reactions ignite, providing enough feedback against further compression for a time that can be even larger than the age of the universe. The main property of a star is its mass because it determines its structure, evolutionary history, age, and ultimate fate. Depending on this quantity, stars are broadly classified as low-mass stars, like our Sun, intermediate mass stars as the variable star Delta Cephei, and massive stars as Betelgeuse, a red supergiant star in Orion constellation. Here we will introduce the basic notions useful to understand stellar evolution of low- and intermediate- mass stars. This mass range (0.1 M$_{\odot}$ - 10.0 M$_{\odot}$) deserves special attention, as it contains most of the stars in the universe. This chapter will focus on how these stars form, the processes that drive their evolution, and key details regarding their structure. Finally, we will discuss the death of such stars, emphasizing the unique fates associated with low- and intermediate-mass stars.

 - **Abstract**
 We present Chandra and XMM-Newton X-ray observations of the compact group HCG 57, and optical integral field spectroscopy of the interacting galaxy pair HCG 57A/D. These two spiral galaxies recently suffered an off-axis collision with HCG 57D passing through the disk of A. We find evidence of a gas bridge linking the galaxies, containing ~10^8 Msol of hot, ~1 keV thermal plasma and warm ionized gas radiating in H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, [OIII] and [NII] lines. The optical emission lines in the central regions of HCG 57D show excitation properties consistent with HII-regions, while the outer rim of HCG 57D, parts of the bridge and the outer regions of HCG 57A show evidence of shocked gas consistent with shock velocities of 200-300 km/s. In contrast, the X-ray emitting gas requires a collision velocity of ~650-750 km/s to explain the observed temperatures. These different shock velocities can be reconciled by considering the contributions of rotation to collision velocity in different parts of the disks, and the clumpy nature of the pre-shock medium in the galaxies, which likely lead to different shock velocities in different components of the turbulent post-shocked gas. We examine the diffuse X-ray emission in the group members and their associated point sources, identifying X-ray AGN in HCG 57A, B, and D. We also confirm the previously reported ~1 keV intra-group medium and find it to be relaxed with a low central entropy (18.0+-1.7 kev cm^2 within 20 kpc) but a long cooling time (5.9+-0.8 Gyr).

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the kinematical and dynamical properties of cluster galaxy populations classified according to their dominant source of gas ionization, namely: star-forming (SF) galaxies, optical active galactic nuclei (AGN), mixed SF plus AGN ionization (transition objects, T), and quiescent (Q) galaxies. We stack 8892 member galaxies from 336 relaxed galaxy clusters to build an ensemble cluster and estimate the observed projected profiles of numerical density and velocity dispersion, $\sigma_P(R)$, of each galaxy population. The MAMPOSSt code and the Jeans equations inversion technique are used to constrain the velocity anisotropy profiles of the galaxy populations in both parametric and non-parametric ways. We find that Q (SF) galaxies display the lowest (highest) typical cluster-centric distances and velocity dispersion values. Transition galaxies are more concentrated and tend to exhibit lower velocity dispersion values than SF galaxies. Galaxies that host an optical AGN are as concentrated as Q galaxies but display velocity dispersion values similar to those of the SF population. MAMPOSSt is able to find equilibrium solutions that successfully recover the observed $\sigma_P(R)$ profile only for the Q, T, and AGN populations. We find that the orbits of all populations are consistent with isotropy in the inner regions, becoming increasingly radial with the distance from the cluster centre. These results suggest that Q galaxies are in equilibrium within their clusters, while SF galaxies have more recently arrived in the cluster environment. Finally, the T and AGN populations appear to be in an intermediate dynamical state between those of the SF and Q populations.

 - **Abstract**
 The Cosmic Dark Ages mark a pivotal era of the universe's evolution, transitioning from a neutral, opaque medium to the emergence of the first stars and galaxies that initiated cosmic reionization. This study examines the thermodynamics of the intergalactic medium (IGM), molecular hydrogen cooling, and gravitational collapse that led to structure formation. Key emission lines, such as Lyman-alpha (Ly$\alpha $) and [C II] 158 $\mu m$, are analyzed as tracers of star formation, metallicity, and IGM conditions. Simulations highlight Ly$\alpha $ scattering profiles and [C II] emission as critical diagnostics of early galaxy evolution. The findings provide a theoretical framework to interpret high-redshift observations, advancing our understanding of the universe's transition from darkness to illumination.

 - **Abstract**
 The discovery of Persistent Radio Sources (PRSs) associated with three repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) has provided insight into the local environments of these FRBs. Here, we present deep radio observations of the fields surrounding three highly active repeating FRBs namely, FRB 20220912A, FRB 20240114A, and FRB 20240619D using the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) at low radio frequencies. Towards FRB~20240114A, we report the detection of compact source at 650\,MHz with a flux density of 65.6$\pm$8.1\,$\mu$Jy/beam. Our measurements of the spectral index, star formation rate of the host galaxy and recently reported constraints on the physical size strongly argue for our detected source to be a persistent radio source (PRS) associated with the FRB 20240114A. For FRB~20220912A, we detect radio emission that is most likely due to star formation in the host galaxy. For FRB 20240619D, we provide upper limits on the radio emission from an associated PRS or the host galaxy. The detection of the PRS associated with FRB~20240114A is a useful addition to the PRSs known to be associated with only three other FRBs so far, and further supports the origin of the PRS in the form of magnetoionic medium surrounding the FRB sources.

 - **Abstract**
 The Gaia DR3 catalogue includes line-broadening measurements (vbroad) for 3524677 stars. We concentrate here on the low-mass main-sequence sub-sample of the catalogue, with BP-RP in the range 1-1.6, which includes 81371 sources. The colour-magnitude diagram of the sample displays two distinct strips, the brighter of which is probably mostly composed of unresolved binaries with mass ratios close to unity. We show that the suspected binary sub-sample displays a larger vbroad distribution, which we attribute to the unresolved absorption lines of the two components of each binary. A similar effect is seen in the GALAH data.
#### How the cool-core population transitions from galaxy groups to massive clusters: A comparison of the largest Magneticum simulation with eROSITA, XMM-Newton, Chandra and LOFAR observations

 - **Abstract**
 Our aim is to understand how the interplay between AGN feedback and merge processes can effectively turn cool-core galaxy clusters into hot-core clusters in the modern universe. Additionally, we also aim to clarify which parameters of the AGN feedback model used in simulations can cause an excess of feedback at the scale of galaxy groups while not efficiently suppressing star formation at the scale of galaxy clusters. To obtain robust statistics of the cool-core population, we compare the modern Universe snapshot (z=0.25) of the largest Magneticum simulation (Box2b/hr) with the eROSITA eFEDS survey and Planck SZ-selected clusters observed with XMM-Newton. Additionally, we compare the AGN feedback injected by the simulation in radio mode with Chandra observations of X-ray cavities, and LOFAR observations of radio emission. We confirm a decreasing trend in cool-core fractions towards the most massive galaxy clusters, which is well reproduced by the Magneticum simulations. This evolution is connected with an increased merge activity that injects high-energy particles into the core region, but it also requires thermalization and conductivity to enhance mixing through the ICM core, where both factors are increasingly efficient towards the high mass end. On the other hand, AGN feedback remains as the dominant factor at the scale of galaxy groups, while its relative impact decreases towards the most massive clusters. The problems suppressing star formation in simulations are not caused by low AGN feedback efficiencies. They root in the definition of the black hole sphere of influence used to distribute the feedback, which decreases as density and accretion rate increase. Actually, a decreasing AGN feedback efficiency towards low-mass galaxy groups is required to prevent overheating.
