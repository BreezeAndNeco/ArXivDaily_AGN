 - **Abstract**
 The co-evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their host galaxies remains one of the central open questions in cosmology, rooted in the coupling between accretion, feedback, and the multi-scale physics that links the event horizon to the circumgalactic medium. Here we bridge these scales by embedding a first-principles, GRMHD-informed prescription for black hole accretion and feedback--derived from multi-zone simulations that self-consistently connect inflows and outflows from the horizon to the Bondi radius--within cosmological magnetohydrodynamic zoom-in simulations of $\sim10^{14}\,M_\odot$ halos. These GRMHD results predict a "suppressed Bondi" regime in which magnetic stresses and relativistic winds strongly reduce effective accretion rates in a spin-dependent manner. We find that black holes cannot grow efficiently by accretion until they exceed $\sim10^{7}\,M_\odot$, regardless of the feedback strength. Beyond this threshold, systems bifurcate: low-spin ($\eta\!\sim\!0.02$) black holes continue to accrete without quenching star formation, while high-spin ($\eta\!\gtrsim\!0.3$) black holes quench effectively but become starved of further growth. Early, massive seeding partially alleviates this tension through merger-driven assembly, yet an additional cold or super-Eddington accretion mode appears essential to reproduce the observed SMBH population and the empirical black hole--galaxy scaling relations. Our results demonstrate that GRMHD-informed feedback models can account for the maintenance-mode behavior of low-luminosity AGN like M87*, but cannot by themselves explain the full buildup of SMBH mass across cosmic time. A unified, multi-regime framework is required to capture the evolving interplay between spin-dependent feedback, cold inflows, and mergers in driving co-evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Rest-frame optical emission line diagnostics are often used to help classify ionizing sources within galaxies. However, rest-frame optical tracers can miss sources with high dust attenuation, leading to misclassification of the dominant ionizing source. Longer wavelength tracers, such as those in the near-infrared, carry the power to diagnose ionizing sources while being more robust than optical tracers to the presence of dust. The diagnostics used in this work employ the ratios of bright near-infrared emission lines [S III] 9530, [Fe II] 12566 and [Fe II] 16443 to Paschen lines in publicly-available JWST/NIRSpec MSA medium-resolution spectroscopy of 55 galaxies at z < 3. We compare the rest-frame near-infrared and rest-frame optical diagnostics and find that ~90% of our sample have consistent classifications across wavelengths (49/55), while the remaining sources can be explained through ionizing radiation obscured by dust and/or elevated N/Fe abundances. We identify three objects classified as star-forming in the rest frame optical and as active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the rest-frame near-infrared, which we interpret as obscured AGN. We also identify three objects which are classified as AGN in the rest-frame optical and star forming in the rest-frame near-infrared. We interpret two of these objects as AGN with obscured star formation and the other with elevated N/Fe. We discuss how future spatially-resolved and/or mid-infrared spectroscopy can test the relative contributions of AGN and stars to the ionizing photon budgets of these disagreeing sources.
#### Bridging scales: Modeling suppressed Bondi accretion on black holes and its impact on galaxy growth

 - **Abstract**
 The accretion and feedback processes governing supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth span an enormous range of spatial scales, from the Event Horizon to the circumgalactic medium. Recent general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations demonstrate that strong magnetic fields can substantially suppress Bondi accretion by creating magnetically arrested disk (MAD) states, reducing inflow rates by up to two orders of magnitude relative to classical Bondi predictions. We incorporate this magnetic suppression prescription from Cho et al. (2023, 2024) into the Dark Sage semi-analytic model (SAM), which tracks SMBH and galaxy co-evolution within hierarchical merger trees derived from the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulation. Implementing the suppression across different Eddington-ratio regimes, we explore its impact on black hole mass functions (BHMFs), stellar mass functions (SMFs), and AGN luminosity functions. Restricting suppression to sub-Eddington accretors ($f_{\rm Edd} < 3 \times 10^{-3}$) and rescaling AGN feedback efficiencies gives simultaneous agreement with observed $z = 0$ SMFs and BHMFs, as illustrated by Case D in this work. At $z > 6$, super-Eddington growth episodes dominate in the SAM, reproducing JWST-inferred luminous AGN number densities. Our results highlight the critical sensitivity of galaxy assembly to the coupling between small-scale accretion physics and large-scale feedback regulation. Magnetic suppression of hot gas accretion can reconcile low-redshift constraints while preserving the rapid black hole growth required at early cosmic epochs, thereby providing a physically motivated bridge between horizon-scale GRMHD simulations and cosmological galaxy-formation models.

 - **Abstract**
 We derive the Tully-Fisher (TFR, $M_\ast-V_{\rm circ, f}$) and Fall (FR, $j_\ast-M_\ast$) relations at redshift $z = 0.9$ using a sample of 43 main-sequence disc galaxies with H$\alpha$ IFU data and JWST/HST imaging. The strength of our analysis lies in the use of state-of-the-art 3D kinematic models to infer galaxy rotation curves, the inclusion and morphological modelling of NIR bands, and the use of SED modelling applied to our photometry measurements to estimate stellar masses. After correcting the inferred H$\alpha$ velocities for asymmetric drift, we find a TFR of the form $\log(M_\ast / M_\odot) = a \log(V_{\rm circ,f} / 150~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}) + b$, with $a=3.82^{+0.55}_{-0.40}$ and $b=10.27^{+0.06}_{-0.07}$, as well as a FR of the form $\log(j_\ast / \mathrm{kpc\,km\,s^{-1}}) = a \log(M_\ast / 10^{10.5} M_\odot) + b$, with $a=0.44^{+0.06}_{-0.06}$ and $b=2.86^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$. When compared to their $z=0$ counterparts, we find moderate evolution in the TFR and strong evolution in the FR over the past $8$ Gyr. We interpret our findings in the context of the galaxy-to-halo scaling parameters $f_{\rm M}=M_\ast/M_{\rm vir}$ and $f_{\rm j}=j_\ast/j_{\rm vir}$. We infer that at $z=0.9$ both $f_{\rm M}$ and $f_{\rm j}$ are higher and less mass-dependent than at $z=0$. We speculate that the evolution of $f_{\rm j}$ can be driven by more efficient and centrally concentrated stellar feedback at $z=0.9$, or by an appreciable dry merger history. We also show that assuming the galaxies populating our $z=0.9$ relations evolve into those populating the $z=0$ relations leads to an apparent discrepancy with the hierarchical growth of dark matter halos. To solve this issue, one needs to evoke a progenitor bias scenario, unknown systematics affecting our and previous measurements, or consider the possibility that H$\alpha$ kinematics is not a reliable dynamical tracer.

 - **Abstract**
 The nature and detailed properties of the heating of the million-degree solar corona are important issues that are still largely unresolved. Nanoflare heating might be dominant in active regions and quiet Sun, although direct signatures of such small-scale events are difficult to observe in the highly conducting, faint corona. The aim of this work is to test the theory of coronal heating by nanoflares in braided magnetic field structures. We analyze a 3D MHD model of a multistrand flux tube in a stratified solar atmosphere, driven by twisting motions at the boundaries. We show how the magnetic structure is maintained at high temperature and for an indefinite time, by intermittent episodes of local magnetic energy release due to reconnection. We forward-modelled optically thin emission with SDO/AIA and MUSE and compared the synthetic observations with the intrinsic coronal plasma properties, focusing on the response to impulsive coronal heating. Currents build up and their impulsive dissipation into heat are also investigated through different runs. In this first paper, we describe the proliferation of heating from the dissipation of narrow current sheets in realistic simulations of braided coronal flux tubes at unprecedented high spatial resolutions.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations of fast and bursty ``nanojets'' suggest novel diagnostics of nanoflare heating in the solar corona. The aim of this work is to investigate the presence and properties of reconnection outflows, similar to observed nanojets, in numerical simulations, and explore their relationship with the nanoflare properties. This work explores their potential as diagnostics for nanoflare heating in observations. We developed an algorithm of Reconnection Outflows Automatic Detection (ROAD) in 3D MHD simulations of coronal loops. We applied the algorithm to a 3D MHD stratified coronal loop model heated by magnetic reconnection and analyzed the statistical properties of the jets produced at reconnection sites, over about one solar hour. The magnetic structure is maintained at high temperature and for an indefinite time by intermittent episodes of local magnetic energy release due to reconnection.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. As the number of detected transiting exoplanet candidates continues to grow, the need for robust and scalable automated tools to prioritize or validate them has become increasingly critical. Among the most promising solutions, deep learning models offer the ability to interpret complex diagnostic metrics traditionally used in the vetting process. Aims. In this work, we present WATSON-Net, a new open-source neural network classifier and data preparation package designed to compete with current state-of-the-art tools for vetting and validation of transiting exoplanet signals from space-based missions. Methods. Trained on Kepler Q1-Q17 DR25 data using 10-fold cross-validation, WATSON-Net produces ten independent models, each evaluated on dedicated validation and test sets. The ten models are calibrated and prepared to be extensible for TESS data by standardizing the input pipeline, allowing for performance assessment across different space missions. Results. For Kepler targets, WATSON-Net achieves a recall-at-precision of 0.99 (R@P0.99) of 0.903, ranking second, with only the ExoMiner network performing better (R@P0.99 = 0.936). For TESS signals, WATSON-Net emerges as the best-performing non-fine-tuned machine learning classifier, achieving a precision of 0.93 and a recall of 0.76 on a test set comprising confirmed planets and false positives. Both the model and its data preparation tools are publicly available in the dearwatson Python package, fully open-source and integrated into the vetting engine of the SHERLOCK pipeline.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational wave sources with electromagnetic counterparts have highlighted the need for predictive, interpretable models linking the parameters of compact binary systems to post-merger remnants and mass outflows. In this work, we explore AI-driven symbolic regression (SR) frameworks to derive updated analytical relations for disk ejecta mass in binary neutron star mergers, trained on state-of-the-art numerical relativity simulations. Our method reveals a set of compact equations that outperform existing fitting formulae across multiple statistical metrics while remaining physically interpretable. Notably, SR also enables alternative predictor sets (e.g., $\{M_1,M_2,\tilde{\Lambda}\}$) that match or exceed the accuracy of models relying solely on compactness of the lightest neutron star ($C_1$), enabling new parameter constraints from electromagnetic observations. Unlike traditional black-box machine learning models, these closed-form expressions generalize robustly to regions of the parameter space not represented in the training data, offering a physics-informed tool for multimessenger observations and constraints on the neutron star equation of state.

 - **Abstract**
 We present results from a program of Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) 1.3 mm (Band 6) molecular line mapping of a sample of nearby, bipolar/pinched-waist, molecule-rich PNe (NGC 6302, Hubble 5, NGC 2440, NGC 6445, NGC 2899, and NGC 2818). Maps of $^{12}$CO(2$-$1) and $^{13}$CO(2$-$1) emission as well as emission lines of HCN, HNC, HCO$^+$, CN, and CS $-$ many of these detected in these PNe for the first time $-$ reveal the molecular mass distributions, compositions, and velocity fields of the equatorial and, in some cases, polar regions of the sample PNe. In each case, the bulk of the molecular gas traces an expanding equatorial torus, with torus expansion velocities ranging from $\sim$15 to $\sim$50 km s$^{-1}$ and molecular masses from $\sim$0.002 to $\sim$0.1 $M_\odot$. The inferred molecular torus dynamical ages, which span the range $\sim$500 yr (Hb 5) to $\sim$11000 yr (NGC 2818), provide support for a model wherein molecular torus ejection precedes bipolar lobe formation. Collectively, these ALMA survey results provide insight into the rapid structural evolution as well as the zones of irradiated molecular gas within bipolar PNe that are descended from relatively massive progenitors, likely residing in interacting binary systems, over $\sim$10 kyr of the post-AGB evolution of such systems.

 - **Abstract**
 MHD turbulence driven at velocities higher than the Alfvén velocity, i.e., super-Alfvénic turbulence, is widely spread in astrophysical environments, including galaxy clusters and molecular clouds. For statistical studies of such turbulence, we explore the utility of the polarization angle structure functions $D^\phi(R)= \left\langle\sin^2(\phi_1-\phi_2) \right\rangle$, where $\phi$ denotes the polarization angle measured at points separated by a projected distance $\mathbf{R}$ on the plane of the sky. Lazarian, Yuen and Pogosyan, 2022, showed that in the case of super-Alfvénic turbulence, the spectral slope of $D^\phi(\mathbf{R})$ differs from that of the underlying magnetic fluctuations, limiting its applicability for field strength estimation with known techniques. In this work, we provide an analytical framework that explains the modification of the $D^\phi(R)$ spectral slope in super-Alfvénic turbulence and validate our predictions with numerical simulations. We demonstrate that for super-Alfvénic turbulence, the structure function $D^\phi (R)$ gets shallower with the increase of $M_A$. Our study makes $D^\phi (R)$ a valuable diagnostic of super-Alfvénic turbulence and opens a way to obtain $M_A$ from observations. We also explore numerically the structure function of the polarization degree and the spectrum of the polarization directions, the latter being the Fourier transform of $D^\phi$. We discuss the implications of our findings for turbulence and magnetic field studies in the intracluster and interstellar media.

 - **Abstract**
 The Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) will enable detailed studies of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in the very-high-energy (VHE) regime, as the next-generation ground-based gamma-ray observatory, designed to enhance sensitivity and energy coverage (20 GeV -- 300 TeV) over current Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs). In the context of the CTAO Science Collaboration, within the AGN Population working group, we developed a variability-based strategy to improve predictions of AGNs detectable by CTAO, using Fermi-LAT data and normalized excess variance (NXS) as a tracer of flux variability. By extrapolating from 30-day to 3-day timescales, we expanded the sample of sources with short-timescale variability estimates from 87 to 407. This approach allows us to identify flaring and distant AGNs that are promising CTAO targets. The results are being used to support the CTAO extragalactic science program and will be included in an upcoming Consortium publication for the AGN Population collaboration.
#### Gas excitation of post-starburst galaxies at 0.6 < z < 1.3

 - **Abstract**
 Molecular gas traces both the fuel for star formation and the processes that regulate it. Observing its physical state (e.g., excitation) reveals when and why galaxies stop forming stars. We observed the CO(5-4) emission of 8 post-starburst galaxies at z ~ 0.6-1.3. To our knowledge, this is the first time that high-J transitions are probed for quiescent galaxies beyond the local Universe. All targets are detected in CO(2-1) or CO(3-2) and have molecular gas fractions up to 20%. Using the ratio R52=L'CO(5-4)/L'CO(2-1) as a proxy for gas excitation, we test how quenching occurs. Low R52 values would indicate suppressed fractions of dense/warm gas relative to cold and diffuse gas, while ratios typical of main-sequence galaxies would imply that quenching is still ongoing and that star formation may exhaust the remaining gas. On average our post-starbursts have R52 = 0.31, comparable to high-redshift galaxies. However, CO(5-4) non-detections, corresponding to galaxies without signs of interaction, yield R52<0.11, 2 times lower than local star-forming galaxies. The average CO Spectral Line Energy Distribution (SLED) peaks at J = 3, similar to the Milky Way. Three galaxies show signs of ongoing mergers and have R52 = 0.49 and CO SLEDs peaking at J > 4-5, similar to high-redshift galaxies. At least one requires additional mechanisms (AGN, shocks) to explain the rise of the SLED up to J=5. CO excitation helps distinguishing among mechanisms driving the low star formation efficiency (SFE) of post-starburst galaxies. The low SFE might be due to high kinetic temperatures and low gas densities yielding high excitation, or due to low gas densities implying low excitation. On average, our sample favours the latter scenario, suggesting that gas stabilization, feedback, or stripping are needed to keep galaxies quiescent, and that residual star formation alone cannot deplete the remaining molecular gas.

 - **Abstract**
 Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are neutron stars with spin periods as short as a few milliseconds, formed through mass accretion from companion stars. In the dense environments of globular clusters (GCs), MSPs are likely to originate through dynamically assembled interacting binaries. Over 300 MSPs have been detected in GCs to date, more than half of the known Galactic MSP population. In this work, we model MSP populations in intermediate-mass GCs using the direct $N$-body code \textsc{NBODY6++GPU}. We update the code by implementing pulsar spin-down due to magnetic braking and spin-up through accretion, and use this framework to model the pulsar population in the globular cluster M71 to investigate the pulsar population within and the associated gravitational wave transients.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic fields in the upper atmospheres of solar-like stars are believed to provide an enormous amount of energy to power the hot coronae and drive large-scale eruptions that could impact the habitability of planetary systems around these stars. However, these magnetic fields have never been routinely measured on stars beyond the solar system. Through decade-long spectropolarimetric observations, we have now achieved the measurements of magnetic fields in the lower and middle chromospheres of three M-dwarfs. Our results indicate that the line-of-sight component of the chromospheric magnetic fields can reach up to hundreds of Gauss, whose sign frequently opposes that of the photospheric field. The measurements highlight the magnetic field complexity and the variation with height close to the surface of these M-dwarfs. They provide critical constraints on the energy budget responsible for heating and eruptions of stellar upper atmospheres, and enable assessments of how stellar magnetic activity may affect exoplanet environments.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel resonance mechanism that can naturally occur in neutron star binaries: a spin-orbit resonance. This resonance locks the binary into a unique state where the neutron star spin evolves alongside the orbit. The resonance requires a finite neutron star ellipticity $\epsilon$ possibly sourced by strong internal magnetic fields in magnetars, which are motivated by population study of eccentric neutron star-black hole binary GW200105. We find that the locking probability is proportional to $\sqrt{\epsilon}$. We derive the phase correction in the gravitational waveform due to this resonance locking effect, and have conducted a search in all neutron star binaries up to the O4a gravitational-wave catalog, with no positive event found so far. Observations by next-generation detectors such as Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, or even the upcoming upgrade of Advanced LIGO, have the potential to detect such locking signals, enabling precise measurements of both neutron star's ellipticity and moment of inertia. Future searches should be performed to discover this resonance, or, if undetected, to place constraints on the magnetar fraction in neutron star binaries.
#### Continuum variability in multi-epoch quasar spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey

 - **Abstract**
 We examine the continuum variability of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) by analyzing the multi-epoch spectroscopic data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. To achieve this, we utilized approximately 2 million spectroscopy pairwise combinations observed across different epochs for $\sim90,000$ AGNs. We estimate the ensemble variability structure function (SF) for subsamples categorized by various AGN properties, such as black hole mass, AGN luminosity ($L$), and Eddington ratio, to investigate how AGN variability depends on these parameters. We found that the SFs are strongly correlated with $L$, Eddington ratio, and rest-frame wavelength ($\lambda$). The analysis, with each parameter held fixed, reveals that SFs depend primarily on $L$ and $\lambda$, but not on the Eddington ratio. Consequently, under the assumption that AGNs follow a universal SF, we found that the variability timescale ($\tau$) is proportional to both $L$ and $\lambda$, expressed as $\tau \propto L^{0.62\pm0.07} \lambda^{1.74\pm0.23}$. This result is broadly consistent with predictions from the standard accretion disk model ($\tau \propto L^{0.5} \lambda^{2}$). However, when considering only shorter wavelengths ($\lambda \leq 3050$ Å) to minimize contamination from the host galaxy and the Balmer continuum, the power-law index for $\lambda$ drops significantly to $1.12 \pm 0.24$. This value is lower than predicted by approximately $3-$4\ \sigma$, suggesting that the radial temperature profile may be systematically steeper than that predicted by the standard disk model, although other mechanisms may also contribute to this discrepancy. These findings highlight the power of temporal spectroscopic data in probing AGN variability, as they allow robust estimation of continuum fluxes without interference from strong emission lines.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the optical characterization of the AlMn kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs) in development for use in the Next-generation Extended Wavelength-MUltiband Sub/millimeter Inductance Camera (NEW-MUSIC) on the Leighton Chajnantor Telescope (LCT). NEW-MUSIC will cover 80-420 GHz, split into six spectral bands, with polarimetry. This broad spectral coverage will enable study of a range of scientific topics such as the accretion and feedback in galaxies and galaxy cluster evolution via the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect, the transient synchrotron emission from the explosive deaths of massive stars and other time-domain phenomena, and dusty sources from low to high redshift (with polarization). Al KIDs have already been demonstrated for bands 2-5. AlMn KIDs will be used for the 90~GHz band, as Al's pair-breaking energy is too high. However, AlMn has only barely been explored as a KID material. To this end, we first improved the modeling techniques used for Al KIDs within BCS theory by eliminating the use of analytical approximations for the expressions of the complex conductivity and found these changes reduced fit parameter degeneracy in the analysis of AlMn. Then, we tested the addition of a gap smearing parameter, a standard extension to BCS theory in use for high kinetic inductance materials, and found it did not improve the fits.

 This theoretical work investigates different models to predict the redshift of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) from their observed dispersion measure (DM) and other reported properties. We performed an extensive revision of the FRBs with confirmed galaxy hosts in the literature and compiled an updated catalog. With this sample of FRBs, composed of 117 unique transients, we explore four physically motivated models that relate the DM and redshift ($z$): a linear trend (inspired by the Macquart relation), a log-parabolic function, a power-law, and a combined model from the above. We assess the success of these theoretical proposals by implementing different statistical metrics and ranking them. The DM-$z$ relations are also tested using 100 realizations of 500 simulated FRBs, which follow the observed DM trends. Relying on our theoretical modeling, we establish the probability of $\sim$1000 FRBs with unknown $z$ (from the latest CHIME data release) to be hosted by galaxies in the SDSS archival dataset. Our validation scheme allows us to predict the FRBs with a probability threshold of $\geq$0.95 to originate in these galaxies, using their 2D angular position in the sky, magnitude in the r-band, and redshift. This statistical proposal will be tested with upcoming data releases from DESI and new generations of galaxy surveys, such as Euclid, and it opens brilliant possibilities to localize these transients in an automatic pipeline.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar flares, the most powerful explosive phenomena in the solar system, may pose significant hazards to spaceborne satellites and ground-based infrastructure. Despite decades of intensive research, reliable flare prediction remains a challenging task. Large Language Models, as a milestone in artificial intelligence, exhibit exceptional general knowledge and next-token prediction capabilities. Here we introduce JW-Flare, the first Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) explicitly trained for solar flare forecasting through fine-tuning on textual physic parameters of solar active regions and magnetic field images. This method demonstrates state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance for large flares prediction on the test dataset. It effectively identifies all 79 X-class flares from 18,949 test samples, yielding a True Skill Statistic (TSS) of 0.95 and a True Positive Rate (TPR) of 1.00, outperforming traditional predictive models. We further investigate the capability origins of JW-Flare through explainability experiments, revealing that solar physics knowledge acquired during pre-training contributes to flare forecasting performance. Additionally, we evaluate models of different parameter scales, confirming the Scaling_Law of Large Language Models in domain-specific applications, such as solar physics. This study marks a substantial advance in both the scale and accuracy of solar flare forecasting and opens a promising avenue for AI-driven methodologies in broader scientific domains.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, progress in improving the coordinates uncertainty of extragalactic radio sources derived from astrometric and geodetic VLBI observations is investigated. For this purpose, 30 catalogs of radio source positions computed in 1997-2025 were analyzed. Over these years, the median source position uncertainty represented by the semi-major axis of the error ellipse for 467 sources in common to all catalogs improved by one order of magnitude: from 0.156 mas to 0.015 mas. It was also found that the improvement in the position uncertainty over time follows a power law with high accuracy. The number of observations used for determination of the coordinates of the common sources in the input catalogs increased over time from 1.3 to 14.4 million, also following a power law. A discussion of the results led us to the conclusion that the number of observations is the primary factor in improving the source positions uncertainty compared to the number of sessions in which the source was observed.

 - **Abstract**
 J-PAS (Javalambre Physics of the Accelerating Universe Astrophysical Survey) will present a groundbreaking photometric survey covering 8500 deg$^2$ of the visible sky from Javalambre, capturing data in 56 narrow band filters. This survey promises to revolutionize galaxy evolution studies by observing $\sim$10$^8$ galaxies with low spectral resolution. A crucial aspect of this analysis involves predicting stellar population parameters from the observed galaxy photometry. In this study, we combine the exquisite J-PAS photometry with state-of-the-art single stellar population (SSP) libraries to accurately predict stellar age, metallicity, and dust attenuation with a neural network (NN) model. The NN is trained on synthetic J-PAS photometry from different SSP librares (E-MILES, Charlot & Bruzual, XSL), to enhance the robustness of our predictions against individual SSP model variations and limitations. To create mock samples with varying observed magnitudes we add artificial noise in the form of random Gaussian variations within typical observational uncertainties in each band. Our results indicate that the NN can accurately estimate stellar parameters for SSP models without evident degeneracies, surpassing a bayesian SED-fitting method on the same test set. We obtain median bias, scatter and percentage of outliers $\mu$ = (0.01 dex, 0.00 dex, 0.00 mag), $\sigma_{NMAD}$ = (0.23 dex, 0.29 dex, 0.04 mag), f$_{o}$ = (17 %, 24 %, 1 %) at $ i \sim$17 mag for age, metallicity and dust attenuation, respectively. The accuracy of the predictions is highly dependent on the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of the photometry, achieving robust predictions up to $i$ $\sim$ 20 mag.
#### Multiwavelength spectral and temporal analysis of VHE Blazar 1ES 1959+650: Tracing emission mechanisms across flux states

 - **Abstract**
 The high-synchrotron-peaked BL Lac object 1ES\,1959+650 exhibited pronounced activity between MJD~60310 -- 60603, including a very high energy (VHE) detection reported by LHAASO. To investigate the underlying emission mechanisms, we performed a comprehensive temporal and spectral analysis using multiwavelength data from \textit{Swift}-XRT/UVOT and \textit{Fermi}-LAT, covering the optical/UV to GeV $\gamma$-ray bands. The source shows strong energy-dependent variability, with the largest fractional variability in $\gamma$-rays, followed by X-rays and UV/optical, consistent with leptonic emission scenarios. Based on the variability patterns, we identified distinct flux states (F1, F2, F3, F4, F5, VHE-FX1, and VHE-FX2). The X-ray spectra exhibit a clear ``harder-when-brighter'' trend across these states. We modeled the broadband spectral energy distributions (SEDs) using a one-zone model incorporating synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emission, implemented in \textsc{xspec} using $\chi^{2}$ minimization. During the VHE detection, the corresponding X-ray/optical emission likely resembled the F2 state. Modeling the VHE SED using F1-state data led to an SSC overprediction of the VHE flux, whereas all other states were well described within the one-zone framework. Systematic trends in physical parameters are observed across flux states, including spectral hardening, increasing break energy, rising bulk Lorentz factor, and decreasing magnetic field with increasing flux. These results suggest that enhanced particle acceleration efficiency and stronger Doppler boosting drive the observed flaring activity, while the decrease in magnetic field indicates conversion of magnetic energy into particle kinetic energy, consistent with shock-driven scenarios.

 - **Abstract**
 Spectroscopic analysis of large flares (>X1) in the hard X-ray (HXR) range offers unique insights into the hottest (> 30 MK) flare plasma, the so-called superhot thermal component. To manage the high count rates in large flares, an attenuator is typically placed in front of the HXR detectors. However, this significantly limits the spectral diagnostic capabilities at lower energies, and consequently, it restricts the analysis of the lower temperatures in flares. The Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX) on board the Solar Orbiter mission was designed to observe solar flares in hard X-rays. The imaging detectors use an attenuator during periods of high flux level. In contrast, the background (BKG) detector of STIX is never covered by the attenuator and is therefore dedicated to measure the unattenuated flux using differently sized apertures placed in front of the detector. We aim to demonstrate that joint spectral fitting using different detector configurations of STIX allows us to reliably diagnose both the hot and the superhot components in large flares. We jointly fit the HXR spectra of the STIX BKG detector and the STIX imaging detectors using SUNKIT-SPEX software package to determine the spectral parameters of both the hot and superhot thermal components in solar flares. Using joint fitting on 32 STIX flares, we corroborate that for GOES X-class flares, the HXR spectrum is better represented by two thermal components instead of an isothermal component. At the temperature peak time, the superhot HXR flux above 15 keV is typically stronger than the hot HXR flux. The GOES long-wavelength channel is dominated by the hot component with a superhot contribution up to 10%. This paper demonstrates that joint spectral fitting of the same detector type with different attenuation schemes is a simple and powerful method to monitor multithermal flare plasma.

 - **Abstract**
 As the number of gravitational-wave detections of black hole binaries grows, so does the diversity of proposed formation channels. The growing sample of systems with highly unequal masses, such as GW190814 with $m_1=23.2\,M_{\odot}$ and $m_2=2.59\,M_{\odot}$ -- corresponding to a mass ratio $q=0.112$ -- cannot be readily explained by isolated binary evolution and may originate through dynamical assembly in an active galactic nucleus (AGN). We investigate AGN discs capable of producing GW190814-like mergers using \texttt{pAGN} to model self-consistent AGN torques, coupled with \texttt{TSUNAMI}, a regularised N-body code including post-Newtonian terms up to 3.5 order. Suites of N-body simulations reveal possible outcomes of binary capture and merger, mean-motion resonance interactions, and other novel dynamical pathways. We develop analytical models linking the branching ratios of captures and mergers to local disc properties, applicable to black hole populations across all mass ratios. Capture probability is primarily governed by $\mathscr{B}$, the ratio of libration time to resonance-width crossing, and is well-described by a log-Gaussian, $P(\rm{capture}|\mathscr{B}) = A \exp[-(\ln \mathscr{B}-\mu)^2/2\sigma^2]$, with $A = 0.41^{+0.04}_{-0.04}$, $\mu = 1.09^{+0.08}_{-0.07}$, $\sigma = 1.05^{+0.08}_{-0.07}$. This fit, while an upper limit, is useful for simplified population synthesis. Finally, we explore the mass ratio AGN luminosity parameter space and find that GW190814 may be formed in a low luminosity AGN of $L_{\rm AGN}\approx 10^{43.5}\ \rm erg\ s^{-1}$. A more systematic parameter space exploration and future population studies will further test our predictions.

 - **Abstract**
 We used newly obtained observations from the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) equipped with the Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MRS) aboard the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to extract spectra covering the entire spectral range from 5 to 27~$\mu$m in the CND and in the CC. We used the photoionization code CLOUDY to generate synthetic spectra with the same spectral range and resolution, simulating a wide range of gas phases and abundances. We then determined the contribution of each phase to the spectra. Once the abundances and contribution from each phase of the gas were determined, we identified four dominant phases and performed a spatial analysis to determine their contribution to each spaxel of the datacubes. We find that in both the CND and the CC, the bulk of the emission originates from warm ionized gas with temperatures of between $10^4$ and $10^{4.8}$~K. In the CND, molecular gas contributes significantly to the flux and is spatially structured, while the CC shows minimal molecular gas content, as is expected from these regions. Coronal gas is detected in both regions at the interface between molecular and warm ionized gas. The observed abundance pattern (enhanced CNO and $\alpha$ elements with suppressed Fe) indicates a chemically young environment, recently enriched by core-collapse supernovae and stellar winds, with a limited contribution from older Type Ia supernovae. This favors a scenario of massive, recent star formation rather than cumulative long-term enrichment.

 - **Abstract**
 As an unprecedented large population in the early universe, the JWST-discovered little red dots (LRDs) have garnered much attention for formation of massive black holes and galaxies, but their nature remains a mystery. The LRDs appearing as ``Chimeras" like both active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and galaxies have stimulated renewed interest in the roadmap of central massive black hole (cMBH) formation in AGNs. In this paper, we suggest that the LRDs contain $M_{\bullet}\lesssim 10^6\,M_{\odot}$ cMBHs as demonstrated by the Sołtan argument and there is a large population of stellar-mass black holes (sMBHs with total mass of $\mathscr{M}_{m_{\bullet}}$) embedded inside cMBH accretion disks (cMBH-disk) as motivated by anomalous reverberations of broad H$\beta$ line in local AGNs. This embryo structure of LRDs ($M_{\bullet}<\mathscr{M}_{m_{\bullet}}$) is formed as a consequence of gravitational collapse of primordial clouds. In this Chimera, accretion onto sMBHs powers the rest-frame optical continuum of the LRDs but the UV continuum is jointly contributed by slim parts of the cMBH-disks and nuclear starbursts in the core of collapsing clouds governing the appearance of the observed V-shaped spectral energy distributions (SEDs). Outflowing clumped-envelopes are unavoidably formed by radiation pressure leading to absorption features of the Balmer lines. The present model works very well for LRDs' SEDs and avoids the issues of overly massive cMBHs. Evolution of LRDs is briefly discussed including gravitational waves.

 - **Abstract**
 Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are massive expulsions of magnetised plasma from a star, and are the largest contributors to space weather in the Solar System. CMEs are theorized to play a key role in planetary atmospheric erosion, especially for planets that are close to their host star. However, such a conclusion remains controversial as there has not been an unambiguous detection of a CME from a star outside of our Sun. Previous stellar CME studies have only inferred the presence of a CME through the detection of other types of stellar eruptive events. A signature of a fast CME is a Type II radio burst, which is emitted from the shock wave produced as the CME travels through the stellar corona into interplanetary space. Here we report an analogue to a Type II burst from the early M dwarf StKM 1-1262. The burst exhibits identical frequency, time, and polarisation properties to fundamental plasma emission from a solar Type II burst. We demonstrate the rate of such events with similar radio luminosity from M dwarfs are 0.84$^{+1.94}_{-0.69} \times$10$^{-3}$ per day per star. Our detection implies that we are no longer restricted to extrapolating the solar CME kinematics and rates to other stars, allowing us to establish the first observational limits on the impact of CMEs on exoplanets.
#### Variability of optical spectral index to support a central sub-parsec binary black hole system in quasar SDSS J001224-102226.51

 - **Abstract**
 In this manuscript, variations in optical spectral index $\alpha_{5100}$ are applied for detecting central sub-parsec binary black hole systems (sub-pc BBHs) in broad line active galactic nuclei (BLAGN), due to apparent effects of obscurations on central two BH accreting systems. For sub-pc BBHs in BLAGN, two main characteristics on $\alpha_{5100}$ can be expected. First, if a BLAGN harbours a central sub-pc BBH, the expected unique variability in $\alpha_{5100}$ should lead the BLAGN to be an outlier in the space of $\alpha_{5100}$ versus continuum luminosity $L_{5100}$ determined from normal BLAGN. Second, BLAGN harbouring central sub-pc BBHs could lead to periodic variations in $\alpha_{5100}$. Here, after checking the two-epoch SDSS spectra of quasar SDSS J0012-1022 reported as a candidate of sub-pc BBH by large velocity offset between narrow and broad Balmer emission lines, unique variability of $\alpha_{5100}$ can be explained by effects of obscurations related to an assumed central sub-pc BBH. In the near future, to detect and report periodic variations of $\alpha_{5100}$ for sub-pc BBHs in BLAGN should be our main objective. The results provide a new method by applications of properties of optical continuum emissions for detecting sub-pc BBHs in BLAGN.

 - **Abstract**
 Radio observations at low frequencies are sensitive to the magnetic activity of stars and the plasma environment surrounding them. The accurate interpretation of the processes underlying the radio signatures requires a detailed characterisation of the stellar magnetism. We study two M dwarfs, StKM 1-1262 (M0 type, P$_\mathrm{rot}=1.24$ d) and V374 Peg (M4 type, P$_\mathrm{rot}=0.4455$ d), which were detected with the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR). StKM 1-1262 exhibited a type-II radio burst, potentially resulting from a coronal mass ejection event. V374 Peg manifested low-frequency radio emission typical of an electron-cyclotron maser instability emission mechanism. We analysed spectropolarimetric observations of these M dwarfs collected with the SpectroPolarimètre InfraRouge (SPIRou). Firstly, we refined the stellar parameters such as effective temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity, and measured the average surface magnetic flux via modelling of Zeeman broadening in unpolarised spectra. We then applied Zeeman-Doppler imaging to least-squares deconvolution line profiles in circular polarisation to reconstruct their large-scale magnetic fields. StKM 1-1262 has a total, unsigned magnetic field of $3.53\pm0.06$ kG on average and the large-scale magnetic field topology is dipolar and moderately axisymmetric, with an average strength of 300 G. V374 Peg has an unsigned magnetic field of $5.46\pm0.09$ kG and the large-scale field is dipolar and axisymmetric, with an average strength of 800 G. For StKM 1-1262, we found a strong anti-correlation between the total magnetic field and the effective temperature which is reminiscent of the tight link between small-scale magnetic fields and surface inhomogeneities. For V374 Peg, we found a moderate anti-correlation, possibly due to a more even distribution of surface features. (Abridged)
#### Recombination Clumping Factor of Physically Defined Intergalactic Medium at the Epoch of Reionization

 - **Abstract**
 The recombination clumping factor, $C$, is a key parameter in modeling cosmic reionization, but its value is sensitive to the definition of the Intergalactic Medium (IGM). We investigate the clumping factor using the GAMER adaptive mesh refinement cosmological hydrodynamical simulation code. We introduce a new, physically-motivated definition of the IGM based on the effective transmission factor of ionizing photons. We perform large-scale, full-box simulations with varying intensities of the uniform ultraviolet background, and we find that our physically-defined clumping factor is significantly lower than the values derived from traditional overdensity thresholds. We also introduce an analytic model that distinguishes between the volume-weighted and mass-weighted averages of the neutral fraction, and we find the difference in reionization timing of $\Delta z \sim 2$ depending on the assumed clumping factor and the relation between the volume-weighted and mass-weighted neutral fractions. Our zoom-in simulations further show that, while SN feedback increases the clumping factor locally, the effect is limited to $\sim 100$ kpc scales and does not significantly alter the global clumping factor. The substantially lower clumping factor reduces the required ionizing photon budget, potentially alleviating tension for reionization scenarios driven by rare, bright sources like active galactic nuclei.

 - **Abstract**
 On 27 December 2024, near-Earth object (NEO) 2024 YR$_4$ was discovered by the ATLAS survey and identified as a virtual impactor. A few weeks later, it eventually reached level 3 on the Torino Scale and was the first and only asteroid to be ever classified at that level. Here we report an intensive observational campaign combining time-series photometry in the visible, broadband visible and near-infrared colors, and low-resolution visible reflectance spectroscopy to assess its physical properties. Fourier analysis of the lightcurves yields a synodic rotation period of $P = 19.46341 \pm 0.00008$ min, placing 2024 YR$_4$ among the fast rotators, even if such rotation is common for objects of similar $H$ magnitude. Its visible and near-infrared colors and spectra are most consistent with an Sq or K taxonomic classification, though some ambiguity remains. Finally, its phase curve exhibits a notably shallow slope ($G = 0.51 \pm 0.11$), from which we derive an absolute magnitude of $H_\mathrm{R} = 23.82\pm0.09$ mag. After color correction and taking into account other models for the phase function, we report an absolute magnitude of $H_\mathrm{V} = 24.14\pm0.25$ mag. These characterizations, rotation period, taxonomy, and surface properties, would have been crucial for risk assessment and mitigation planning had the initially high impact probability scenario been confirmed, underscoring the importance for planetary defense of a rapid, coordinated international response.

 - **Abstract**
 The ultra-high-energy cosmic ray (UHECR) spectra measured by the Pierre Auger Observatory (Auger) and the Telescope Array (TA) agree very well below $10^{19.5}$ eV but differ significantly at higher energies. We show that these differences can be explained by a single nearby source superimposed on a nearly isotropic background. Taking into account deflections in Galactic and extragalactic magnetic fields, such a source can account for the excess in the TA spectrum without producing excessive anisotropy. The required hard spectrum of the source and intermediate-mass composition are consistent with previous fits of the Auger-only spectrum and composition. This scenario offers several additional advantages: (i) the source produces a broad excess partially overlapping the TA hotspots, suggesting their possible explanation; (ii) without additional tuning, it reproduces the $\sim90^\circ$ shift in dipole direction observed between the Auger-only and combined Auger-TA analyses; and (iii) the best-fit position of the source lies near M82, the brightest nearby starburst galaxy, making it a plausible source of the UHECR.

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are among the most energetic events in the Universe. Despite over 50 years of research and measurements their prompt emission remains poorly understood, with key questions surrounding the structure of relativistic jets, magnetic field configurations, and dominant radiation mechanisms. Polarization measurements are critical in resolving these uncertainties. The POLAR mission, operational in 2016-2017 on Tiangong-2, provided the most statistically significant GRB polarization data. Its results indicated low time-averaged polarization with hints of temporal evolution. However, POLAR's limited sensitivity, small effective area, and restricted energy range prevented more detailed time- and energy-resolved analyses in addition to a larger sample of GRB polarization measurements. POLAR-2 is designed to address these limitations by offering a fourfold increase in effective area (at least) and an extended energy range of 30-800 keV by utilizing Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) and an updated module design, enabling the differentiation of competing GRB emission models. The instrument comprises of 100 polarimeter modules (each with 64 plastic scintillator bars), wherein the polarization angle is extracted through Compton Scattering of the gammas. The polarimeter module design was validated during an ESRF beam test campaign in 2023. The instrument was developed by a joint effort of Switzerland, China, Poland and Germany and is planned for launch in 2027. Currently, POLAR-2 is in its production phase with the first module targets being produced. We will provide an overview of the current status of the development.

 - **Abstract**
 LunPAN (Lunar Particle Analyzer Network) is a three-year mission proposal designed to comprehensively map the particle spectra in the lunar radiation field. It aims to provide precise measurements of Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR), Solar Energetic Particles (SEP), and albedo particles, including charged particles, neutrons, and gamma-rays, originating from the Moon's surface. Therefore it will contribute to fundamental space physics, lunar geology sciences, space weather prediction, and radiation risk assessment for future lunar explorations. This is achieved through two state-of-the-art instruments; this http URL and NeuPix. this http URL is a compact magnetic spectrometer designed for precise measurements of penetrating charged particles, ranging from 100 MeV to 10 GeV. Based on the this http URL project, this http URL employs thin silicon pixel sensors optimized for energy resolution and particle identification. NeuPix is a hybrid active pixel sensor system capable of detecting neutrons, gamma-rays, and lower-energy charged particles between 10MeV and 100 MeV. Utilizing innovative sensor-converter combinations, NeuPix will provide spectral measurements of lunar albedo neutrons and gamma-ray fluxes. Currently, the LunPAN mission is accepted by ESA's "Small Missions for Exploration - Destination the Moon" call for a pre-A phase study. We will discuss mission outline and expected scientific performance of the PixPAN and NeuPix.

 - **Abstract**
 The spatial sensitivity pattern of millimeter-wavelength receivers is an important diagnostic of performance and is affected by the alignment of coupling optics. Characterization can be challenging in the field, particularly in the decentered and tightly packed optical configurations that are employed for many astronomical millimeter-wave cameras. In this paper, we present the design and performance of a lightweight and reconfigurable beam mapper, consisting of a bank of thermal sources positioned by a planar cable-driven robot. We describe how the measurement requirements and mechanical constraints of the Tomographic Ionized-carbon Mapping Experiment (TIME) optical relay drive the design of the mapper. To quantify the positioning performance, we predict the beam patterns at each surface to derive requirements and use a non-contact computer-vision based method built on OpenCV to track the payload position with an accuracy better than 1.0 mm. We achieve an in-plane absolute payload position error of 2.7 mm (RMSE) over a $\sim$400 mm $\times$ 400 mm workspace and an in-plane repeatability of 0.81 mm, offering substantial improvements in accuracy and speed over traditional handheld techniques.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the processing of an observation of Sagittarius A (Sgr A) with the Tomographic Ionized-carbon Mapping Experiment (TIME), part of the 2021-2022 commissioning run to verify TIME's hyperspectral imaging capabilities for future line-intensity mapping. Using an observation of Jupiter to calibrate detector gains and pointing offsets, we process the Sgr A observation in a purpose-built pipeline that removes correlated noise through common-mode subtraction with correlation-weighted scaling, and uses map-domain principal component analysis to identify further systematic errors. The resulting frequency-resolved maps recover strong 12CO(2-1) and 13CO(2-1) emission, and a continuum component whose spectral index discriminates free-free emission in the circumnuclear disk (CND) versus thermal dust emission in the 20 km s$^{-1}$ and 50 km s$^{-1}$ molecular clouds. Broadband continuum flux comparisons with the Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey (BGPS) show agreement to within $\sim$5% in high-SNR molecular clouds in the Sgr A region. From the CO line detections, we estimate a molecular hydrogen mass of between $5.4 \times 10^5 M_\odot$ and $5.7 \times 10^5 M_\odot$, consistent with prior studies. These results demonstrate TIME's ability to recover both continuum and spectral-line signals in complex Galactic fields, validating its readiness for upcoming extragalactic CO and [C II] surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 We study five nearby galaxies (M100/NGC 4321, NGC 1300, M 74, M 60, and NGC 7331) by combining multiband imaging (optical, UV, NIR, and X-rays) with simple photometric measurements to show how each spectral window traces different physical components: UV/blue emphasizes recent star formation, NIR outlines the old stellar mass and internal structure, and X-rays reveal compact sources and hot gas. For M100 we present a multiband mosaic with X-ray contours including the SN 1979C region. We compare isophotal morphology in NGC 1300 (barred) and M 74 (unbarred), quantify ellipticity and equivalent radius in M 60, and illustrate a Tully-Fisher distance estimate for NGC 7331, discussing assumptions (inclination, internal corrections) and consistency with classical scales. Our results underscore that a layered view reduces interpretative biases and that straightforward integrations of public data with open-source software yield robust introductory-level physical diagnostics.

 - **Abstract**
 The icy surface of Europa is continuously bombarded by ions and electrons from Jupiter's magnetosphere. The bombardment of the particles dissociates water molecules on the surface of Europa and introduces impurities to the icy surface. Such processes lead to the generation of the non-water species on the surface of Europa. Such processes lead to the generation of the nonwater species on the surface of Europa. These chemical species are closely related to the chemistry of the icy crust and the subsurface ocean, as well as Europa's habitability. However, our knowledge of the global distribution of these species is limited due to the sparse satellite and telescope observations on Europa. In this study, we combine a Europa plasma model and a chemical-transport model to simulate the global distribution of the key nonwater species on the surface of Europa. The initial results from our model agree well with the existing observations on the distributions of H2SO4 and SO2 but they show a significant discrepancy with the observed distribution of H2O2. Sensitivity tests on the reaction rate coefficients indicate that the simulated global distribution of all three species fit the observations well if the reaction rate coefficients in the ice are reduced by one order of magnitude. This finding provides a useful constraint on the rate coefficient of the chemical reactions in the ice. Furthermore, our model predicts that the O2 on the surface ice of Europa is concentrated on the leading hemisphere. The simulated global distribution of the key species on Europa may provide useful guidance for future missions to Europa, such as Europa Clipper and JUICE.

 - **Abstract**
 Stars predominantly form in compact, non-hierarchical clusters. The gas outflows ejected by protostars can intersect and interact with each other, resulting in complex interactions that affect the dynamics, morphology, and evolution of these outflows. Determining the probability of an encounter between them requires a Bayesian approach that considers the collimation, length (or age), and separation between young stellar objects in the clusters. In this study, we employ a Monte Carlo approach to estimate this probability as a function of the jet opening angle and the ratio between the jet length and the separation between stars. We propose a function that predicts the number of interactions within a cluster based on the opening angle of the gas outflows ejected by protostars.

 - **Abstract**
 Star formation bursts promote the ejection of material from the hosting galaxies due to the momentum and energy injected by winds from massive stars and supernova explosions. Numerical or analytical models generally consider that the mass, momentum, and energy injections result from bursts in a nuclear star formation region. However, star formation bursts have recently been observed in ring-like regions in the nuclear part of the galaxies. One example is NGC 253, which has shown a central toroidal burst and an asymmetric galactic wind observed in thermal X-ray emission. The general aim of this work is to study the effect of mechanical energy injection from stellar winds and supernova explosions in star-forming bursts distributed in rings around the nucleus of the galaxy NGC 253. Additionally, these partial objectives allow us to analyze the asymmetry of the outflows due to the bursts position as well as to study the formation of filaments with optical emission and make comparisons with recent observations of galaxies with these types of star-forming bursts. We used the hydrodynamic code AMRVAC to simulate galactic wind ejection coming from a central ring-like starburst located at different vertical positions. We showed that including a ring-shaped starburst (RSS) generates a more complex structured wind than what would be expected for a spherical starburst injection. Besides the interaction between the wind generated by the RSS and the host galaxy, it can generate dense filamentary structures with H alpha emission. The mass flux analysis of our models shows that the variation in the vertical position of the starburst can generate a variation in the mass flux of each lobe of the wind up to an order of magnitude. However, this difference is sustained only for a short period, with the flux tending to be symmetrical once it enters into a free-wind solution.

 - **Abstract**
 Time-resolved observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) offer a powerful probe of time-dependent cosmological signals, such as a stochastic gravitational wave background passing through Earth, which imprints a time-varying deflection on the CMB, and time-dependent cosmic birefringence, which induces an oscillating polarization rotation. However, analyses based on time-division CMB maps are fundamentally limited by the mapmaking cadence, restricting sensitivity to frequencies below $\sim 10^{-5}$ Hz. In this paper we develop a phase-folding mapmaking framework to enable targeted searches of such periodic cosmological signals with frequencies up to the detector sampling rate of $O(100)$ Hz. We demonstrate the power of this framework with two cosmological applications: (1) constraining a stochastic gravitational wave background via its time-dependent lensing signature, and (2) the search for an oscillating polarization rotation from axion-like particles. We show that this technique transforms CMB experiments into broadband probes of the oscillating sky, extending their constraining power from the microhertz regime up to $O(100)$ Hz-an expansion of over seven orders of magnitude in frequency. This provides a new observational window, complementary to other approaches by probing under-explored frequency ranges for gravitational waves and axion-like particles.

 - **Abstract**
 The Bernardeau-Nishimichi-Taruya (BNT) transform provides a powerful framework for analysing tomographic cosmic shear data by improving the localization of shear correlations in physical scale. It operates by performing a linear combination of the shear data vector in $\ell$-space, yielding a transformed vector that is better localized in both redshift and $k$-space. BNT is particularly useful for estimating cosmological parameters while minimizing the impact of poorly understood nonlinear physics, without discarding large amounts of information as is typically done with simple scale cuts. In our previous work, we showed that BNT outperforms traditional weak-lensing analyses; however, that study did not include intrinsic alignments (IA). In the present work, we assess the robustness of our BNT-based $k$-cut framework in the presence of realistic IA models. We consider two cases: (i) when the assumed IA model used in sampling is close to, but not identical to, the true one, and (ii) when the assumed IA model is significantly mis-specified. In the first case, the $k$-cut framework yields precise and unbiased $S_8$ constraints even with limited knowledge of large-scale modes. In the second, the BNT transform serves as a powerful diagnostic tool, revealing internal inconsistencies in the assumed IA model across $k$- and redshift-space, indicating that the corresponding cosmological constraints cannot be trusted until a more accurate IA model is adopted.
