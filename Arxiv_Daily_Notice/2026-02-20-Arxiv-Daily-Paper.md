#### Causal Reversal in the $M_\unicode{x25CF}\unicode{x2013}σ_0$ Relation: Implications for High-Redshift Supermassive Black Hole Mass Estimates

 - **Abstract**
 The nascent methodology of applying the principles of causal discovery to astrophysical data has produced affirming results about deeply held theories concerning the causal nature behind the observed coevolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with their host galaxies. The key results from observations have demonstrated an apparent causal reversal across different galaxy morphologies$\unicode{x2014}$SMBHs causally influence the evolution of the physical parameters of their spiral galaxy hosts, whereas SMBHs in elliptical galaxies are passive companions that grow in near lockstep with their hosts. To further explore and ascertain insights, it is necessary to utilize galaxy simulations to track the time evolution of the observed causal relations to learn more about the temporal nature of the changing SMBH/galaxy evolutionary directions. We conducted experiments with the NIHAO suite of cosmological zoom-in hydrodynamical simulations to follow the evolution of individual galaxies along with their central SMBH masses ($M_\unicode{x25CF}$) and properties, including central stellar velocity dispersion ($\sigma_0$). We reproduce the causal results from real galaxies, but add clarity by observing that the SMBH/galaxy causal directions are noticeably inverted between the epochs before and after the peak of star formation. The implications for causal reversal of the $M_\unicode{x25CF}\unicode{x2013}\sigma_0$ relation portend larger concerns about the reliability of SMBH masses estimated at high redshifts and presumptions of overmassive black holes at early epochs. Toward this problem, we apply updated causally-informed scaling relations that predict high-$z$ black hole masses that are approximately two orders of magnitude less massive, and thus not overmassive with respect to local $z=0$ SMBH$\unicode{x2013}$galaxy mass ratios.

 - **Abstract**
 The solar-stellar connection provides a unique framework for understanding magnetic activity and atmospheric heating across a broad spectrum of stars. Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) of NASA, equipped with the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager, Atmospheric Imaging Assembly, and Extreme ultraviolet Variability Experiment, has enabled detailed Sun-as-a-star studies that bridge solar and stellar physics. Integrating spatially resolved solar observations into disk-integrated datasets, these studies provide insights into magnetic activity occurring in distant stars. This review highlights key results from recent analyses that employed all three SDO instruments to characterize active regions, quantify universal heating relationships, and reconstruct stellar X-ray and ultraviolet spectra. We discuss how these findings advance our understanding of stellar magnetic activity, provide predictive tools for exoplanetary environments, and outline future directions for applying solar-based frameworks to diverse stellar populations.

 - **Abstract**
 Modern cosmology and galaxy formation rely on an understanding of how cosmic baryons are distributed, a significant portion of which exist in the diffuse gas confined to halos. Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are a promising probe of the Universe's ionized gas. At low redshift, the contribution to the dispersion measure (DM) from the intergalactic medium (IGM) and intervening halos is subdominant, allowing us to study the circumgalactic media (CGM) of the host galaxies. We select a sample of five local universe FRBs whose host interstellar medium (ISM) DM is negligible and use these to constrain the mass of the CGM in each halo. We find that one of our sources, the only massive elliptical host galaxy, has been evacuated of its baryons ($M_\mathrm{gas}=0.02^{+0.02}_{-0.02}M_\mathrm{h}$, corresponding to $\sim$10$\%$ of the cosmological average $\frac{\Omega_b}{\Omega_m}$). This galaxy shows evidence of a past episode of AGN activity, consistent with the picture of strong AGN feedback in galaxy group-scale halos. The other sources are consistent with existing multiwavelength data and tentatively support more baryon retention in $L_*$ galaxies compared to group-scale halos. We show that FRBs can measure the halo gas fraction $f_\mathrm{gas}$ in halos of mass $M_\mathrm{h}\sim10^{11-13}M_\odot$, and up to $\sim10^{14}M_\odot$ if galaxy cluster hosts are included, which is a larger range than other gas probes can access. Finally, we demonstrate that a large sample of local universe FRBs, such as those expected from upcoming all-sky radio telescopes, will enable precision measurements of halo gas, which is crucial for understanding the effects of feedback.

 - **Abstract**
 Accretion-driven outbursts in young stellar objects remain poorly understood, largely limited by a statistically small sample of closely followed-up events. This underscores the importance of a thorough exploration of each outbursting object. We studied a peculiar outbursting system, Gaia24ccy, which exhibited two $\Delta g \sim$ 3.8 mag outbursts in 2019 and 2024. The system consists of two unresolved, nearly identical, and rapidly rotating young stars: Gaia24ccy A (1.1419 days) and Gaia24ccy B (1.7898 days). Periodogram analyses just before the onset of the outbursts suggest Gaia24ccy B to be the outbursting component. Unlike any previously known EXor sources, the two outburst profiles show a very similar evolution: both rose at the same rate for the first 15 days, followed by many 'sub-bursts' on the timescale of 10-20 days. The 2019 outburst lasted 145-255 days, while the 2024 outburst persisted for 367 days. We infer the unstable region to lie at $r_{\rm trigger} \simeq 0.019-0.047$ au ($\sim5-12.3 R_\star$). The accreted mass per event $M_{\rm acc}\sim10^{-5} M_\odot$ can be provided by a compact inner-disk reservoir. The photometric rise/decay timescales and the mid-infrared color evolution favor a thermal-viscous trigger in a hot inner disk, while the appearance of rich emission-line spectra indicates concurrent magnetospheric compression - together best described by a hybrid picture. Finally, we explain the reddening of the mid-infrared color observed during the outburst as a consequence of the competing emission from the viscous disk and the photosphere.
#### The Sign-Switching of the Cosmological Constant

 - **Abstract**
 We propose and investigate a class of dynamical dark energy models in which the cosmological constant evolves from negative values in the early Universe to a positive value at low redshifts. This framework includes a generalised ladder-step evolution, as well as smooth-transition scenarios, providing a unified description of sign-changing cosmological constants. We analyse the theoretical construction and background dynamics of these models using cosmographic diagnostics. Extending this study to the linear perturbation regime, we solve the perturbation equations from the radiation-dominated era with adiabatic initial conditions. We examine the evolution of the matter density contrast, gravitational potential, and the $f\sigma_8$ observable. Our results are compared against the standard $\Lambda$CDM model and confronted with current observational data, illustrating the phenomenological viability of sign-changing dark energy models and revealing distinctive imprints on cosmic structure formation arising from the transition of the cosmological constant.
#### Using EUV driven external photoevaporation to test viscous evolution of protoplanetary discs

 - **Abstract**
 Protoplanetary discs are thought to evolve either through angular momentum transport driven by viscous processes or through angular momentum removal induced by magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) winds. One proposed method to distinguish between these two evolutionary pathways is by comparing mass accretion rates and disc sizes, but observational constraints complicate this distinction. In this study, we investigate how extreme ultraviolet (EUV) external photoevaporation affects the evolution of protoplanetary discs, particularly in environments such as the Orion Nebula Cluster. Using a combination of analytical derivations and 1D numerical simulations, we explore the impact of externally induced mass-loss on disc structure and accretion dynamics. We demonstrate that, in the viscous scenario, there exists a clear, near one-to-one correlation between the mass-loss rate due to external photoevaporative outflows and the mass accretion rate onto the central star. In contrast, MHD wind-driven discs do not exhibit such trend, leading to a distinct evolutionary path. External photoevaporative mass-loss rates and mass accretion rates can both be accurately measured for a population of discs, without a strong model dependence. Thus, our findings provide a robust observational test to distinguish between viscous and MHD wind-driven disc evolution, offering a new approach to constraining angular momentum transport mechanisms in protoplanetary discs. Applying this diagnostic observationally requires joint measurements of $\dot{M}_{\rm acc}$ and $\dot{M}_{\rm pe}$ for the same objects, which are currently scarce in bright HII regions due to contamination and sensitivity limitations.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16808

 - **Abstract**
 An important next step for pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) is to measure anisotropies in the gravitational wave background (GWB) at $\sim$ nano-Hz frequencies. We calculate the expected GWB anisotropies using empirically calibrated models for the merger rates of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). The anisotropies reflect both shot-noise in the discrete SMBHB populations while also tracing, in part, the large-scale structure (LSS) of the universe. The shot-noise term is sensitive to the high-mass end of the merging SMBH mass function, depends somewhat on the low-redshift tail of the merger distribution, and is a strong function of observing frequency. The precise frequency dependence provides a test of SMBHB residence times. In our models, the mean shot-noise anisotropy typically lies close to or above the broad frequency-band NANOGrav upper limits. Consequently, near-future PTA data, and potentially re-analyses of existing measurements using frequency-dependent shot-noise anisotropy templates, should be capable of detecting this signal or placing meaningful constraints on SMBHB merger models. A full interpretation, however, will require modeling the probability distribution of shot-noise amplitudes rather than relying solely on ensemble-averaged predictions. The LSS-induced anisotropies are at least two to three orders of magnitude smaller. Although the LSS contribution contains valuable information regarding the redshift distribution and clustering bias of the merging SMBHBs, detecting this component will be challenging.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutrino emission from astrophysical sources has long been considered a signature of cosmic-ray acceleration. The IceCube neutrino observatory has observed a diffuse flux of TeV-PeV neutrinos, but very few confirmed sources have emerged. With the recent publication of IceCube Event Catalog (IceCat-1), IceCube has released a list of the most promising astrophysical neutrino events since May 2011. Using the archival data from the High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) $\gamma$-ray observatory, we perform a coincidence search for gamma rays and neutrinos using a Bayesian Block algorithm with the public IceCube alerts from IceCat-1, along with additional alerts issued later. In this work, we consider 368 alerts, up to July 8, 2025, that are within HAWC's field of view. We observe approximately a 5\% coincident detection rate, which is consistent with expectations from background. Two of these detections contain the Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) Markarian 421 and Markarian 501. We discuss the likelihood that the neutrino/$\gamma$-ray coincidences are false positives and a brief overview of the results.

 - **Abstract**
 We perform the first systematic study of the minute-to-hours-timescale stochastic variability observed in the X-ray luminosity of tidal disruption events (TDEs) using XMM-Newton data and Fourier analysis methods. We measure the spectral properties, power spectral densities (PSDs), fractional variability amplitudes, and energy dependence of the variability for 18 TDEs spanning 54 observations, of which 27 occur in thermal disk-dominated states and 27 show a nonthermal hard X-ray corona. Compared to pure thermal sources, we find TDEs with coronae are more X-ray variable and show steeper PSDs indicating longer correlation timescales. This state-transition behavior is qualitatively similar to X-ray binaries, which show higher fractional variability in the hard state than in the soft state. However, newborn TDE coronae show systematically flatter PSDs and softer energy spectra than their long-lived AGN counterparts. We also show that the variability amplitude of thermal TDEs increases with photon energy, consistent with variations sourced by local temperature fluctuations and exponentially enhanced in the Wien tail. Our work demonstrates that combining spectral and timing properties of X-ray TDEs can probe the microphysics of newly formed accretion flows around supermassive black holes, and that the coronae formed in TDEs fundamentally differ from those in AGN.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16955

 - **Abstract**
 A theory of the spectral "zebra" pattern of the Crab pulsar's high-frequency interpulse (HFIP) radio emission is developed. The observed emission bands are interference maxima caused by multiple ray propagation through the pulsar magnetosphere. The high-contrast interference pattern is the combined effect of gravitational lensing and plasma de-lensing of light rays. The model enables space-resolved tomography of the pulsar magnetosphere, yielding a radial plasma density profile of $n_{e}\propto r^{-3}$, which agrees with theoretical insights. We predict the zebra pattern trend to change at a higher frequency when the ray separation becomes smaller than the pulsar size. This frequency is predicted to be in the range between 42 GHz and 650 GHz, which is within the reach of existing facilities like ALMA and SMA. These observations hold significant importance and would contribute to our understanding of the magnetosphere. Furthermore, they offer the potential to investigate gravity in the strong field regime near the star's surface.

 - **Abstract**
 This study characterises a series of type~II radio bursts associated with a CME that occurred on 14 May, focusing on the coronal conditions during the event and identifying the likely location of the shocks where the radio bursts are generated. The CME was tracked using a combination of white light and extreme ultraviolet observations of the solar corona taken by three instruments: GOES-SUVI, two coronagraphs of the SOHO-LASCO, together with ground-based radio observations between 10-240~MHz from I-LOFAR. The radial distances of the radio sources were examined using a series of density models, with both PFSS and MHD models used to examine the coronal plasma conditions. Four type~II bursts were identified in the I$-$LOFAR radio dynamic spectrum over $\sim$15~minutes, exhibiting features such as band splitting, herringbones, and fragmentation. The shocks were found to have speeds ranging between $\sim$443$-$2075~km s$^{-1}$, with drift rates of $\sim-$361 to -78~kHz~s$^{-1}$. The shocks were found to have a $M_A \approx$ 3.21$-$3.57. indicating that they were super-Alfvénic. The first type~II burst was triggered $\sim$18~minutes after the CME launch, with each burst appearing to have been generated at a different height in the corona. Analysis of the derived kinematics and modelling results suggests that the type~II bursts were likely produced at the shoulders of the CME near the flanks, where open magnetic field lines and relatively low Alfvén speeds facilitated shock formation. This multi-instrument study shows that multiple type II bursts from a single CME originated at different coronal heights, with modelling indicating their generation near the CME flanks, where low Alfvén speeds and open magnetic field lines facilitated shock formation.

 - **Abstract**
 We present results from imaging observations of three quadruply lensed quasars by Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) at redshifts $z = 2.550$, 2.975, and 1.500. We model our targets assuming a singular isothermal ellipsoid mass profile and an elliptical SÃ\c{opyright}rsic profile for the lensing galaxies, and reconstruct the geometric configuration of each system with measured Einstein radii of 0.44$'$, 0.58$'$, and 0.49$'$. While no spectroscopic measurements are available for the lenses, we constrain the redshift of each lens to $0.5 < z < 1.2$, $1.0 < z < 1.5$, and $0.4 < z < 0.9$. For all three lenses, the best-fit light model yield a typical de Vaucouleurs $n_{\rm S\acute{e}rsic} \sim 4$ profile and an effective radius $R_e$ around $\sim 1.5 - 3.5$ kpc. We accordingly classify the three lenses as early-type galaxies at an intermediate to high redshift, a common type for strong lensing galaxies. Compared to other known quadruple lenses, the lensing galaxies in this work are at the lower end of the distribution of Einstein radii and upper end of the distribution of the lens redshifts. They represent an interesting quadrant of subarcsecond-separation lenses in the population of single-galaxy strong lensing which have been largely unexplored yet and will be great targets of interest in upcoming high-resolution lensing surveys.
#### Under Pressure: UV Emission Line Ratios as Barometers of AGN Feedback Mechanisms

 - **Abstract**
 Feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) is widely acknowledged to regulate the growth of massive galaxies, though its driving mechanisms are debated. Prevailing theories suggest that AGN-driven outflows are driven either by radiation pressure acting directly on the dusty interstellar medium (ISM) or by hot winds entraining cooler ISM gas, but the relative contribution of each mechanism remains uncertain. By combining optical emission line measurements with highly ionized UV emission lines, it is possible to constrain whether the pressure source applied to ionized clouds is primarily radiation or primarily hydrodynamic, and thus constrain the dominant driver. This study presents the first multi-object analysis of far-ultraviolet (FUV) spectra from galactic-scale AGN-driven outflows in obscured quasars, based on Cosmic Origins Spectrograph observations of five low-redshift targets. By comparing narrow-line region UV emission line ratios to theoretical models that vary the importance of the two pressure sources, we find three out of five targets fall within the radiation pressure-dominated regime. A fourth target exhibits intermediate emission-line ratios that suggest radiation pressure and pressure from a hot wind are both dynamically important. Finally, the lowest-luminosity object in our sample may have a dynamically important hot wind component, but non-detections prevent a clear conclusion in this case. These results suggest radiation pressure dominates circum-nuclear narrow-line region cloud dynamics, but pressure from a hot wind also plays a role in some cases. This is consistent with AGN feedback scenarios mediated by radiation pressure or a short-lived hot wind phase that dissipates after initially accelerating outflows.
#### PRODIGE - envelope to disk with NOEMA: VII. (Complex) organic molecules in the NGC1333 IRAS4B1 outflow: A new laboratory for shock chemistry

 - **Abstract**
 Shock chemistry is an excellent tool to shed light on the formation and destruction mechanisms of complex organic molecules (COMs). The L1157-mm outflow is the only low-mass protostellar outflow that has extensively been studied in this regard. Using the data taken as part of the PRODIGE (PROtostars & DIsks: Global Evolution) large program, we aim to map COM emission and derive the molecular composition of the protostellar outflow driven by the Class 0 protostar NGC1333 IRAS4B1 to introduce it as a new laboratory to study the impact of shocks on COM chemistry. In addition to typical outflow tracers such as SiO and CO, outflow emission is seen from H2CO, HNCO, and HC3N, as well as from the COMs CH3OH, CH3CN, and CH3CHO, and even from deuterated species such as DCN, D2CO, and CH2DOH. Maps of integrated intensity ratios between CH3OH and DCN, D2CO, and CH3CHO reveal gradients with distance from the protostar. Intensity ratio maps of HC3N and CH3CN with respect to CH3OH peak in the southern lobe where temperatures are highest. Rotational temperatures derived towards two positions, one in each lobe, are found in the range ~50-100 K. Abundances with respect to CH3OH are higher by factors of a few than for the L1157-B1. In conclusion, for the first time, we securely detected the COMs CH3CN, CH3CHO, and CH2DOH in the IRAS 4B1 outflow, serendipitously with limited sensitivity and bandwidth. Targeted observations will enable the discovery of new COMs and a more detailed analysis of their emission. Morphological differences between molecules in the IRAS 4B1 outflow lobes and their relative abundances provide first proof that this outflow is a promising new laboratory for shock chemistry, which will offer crucial information on COM formation and destruction as well as outflow structure and kinematics.

 - **Abstract**
 The detection limit of astronomical imaging observations is limited by several noise sources. Some of that noise is correlated between neighbouring image pixels and exposures, so in principle could be learned and corrected. We present an astronomical self-supervised transformer-based denoising algorithm (ASTERIS), that integrates spatiotemporal information across multiple exposures. Benchmarking on mock data indicates that ASTERIS improves detection limits by 1.0 magnitude at 90% completeness and purity, while preserving the point spread function and photometric accuracy. Observational validation using data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and Subaru telescope identifies previously undetectable features, including low-surface-brightness galaxy structures and gravitationally-lensed arcs. Applied to deep JWST images, ASTERIS identifies three times more redshift > 9 galaxy candidates, with rest-frame ultraviolet luminosity 1.0 magnitude fainter, than previous methods.

 - **Abstract**
 The gravitational wave (GW) event S250206dm, as the first well-localized neutron star merger candidate potentially located in the mass gap, presented a unique opportunity to probe the electromagnetic signatures from such a system. Here we report a deep, multiband search with the new 2.5-meter Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST), covering about 64% of the localization region up to a 5-sigma limiting magnitude of 23 mag. In total, 12 potential candidates have been identified while none of them are likely related to S250206dm. This non-detection provides the most stringent constraint to date on any associated kilonova. Crucially, an AT 2017gfo-like event at 269 Mpc can be excluded by WFST observations alone. Based on ejecta mass limits, a neutron star-black hole with a large mass ratio (Q >= 3.2) is disfavored. This optical-derived constraint on the mass ratio reaches, for the first time, a precision comparable to that inferred from the GW signal. This work presents the best observation of this type of events until now, and demonstrates the power of rapid, deep follow-up observations to constrain the properties of compact binary progenitors, offering key insights into the constituents of the mass gap.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper we present 16 early-phase type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) discovered during the pilot survey of the 2.5-meter Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST-PS) from March 4 to July 10, 2024, including three SNe Ia with early-excess emission features (EExSNe Ia). The discovery magnitude of the 16 WFST-PS early-phase SNe is at least 3 mag fainter than their peak brightness. A large scatter of color indices is found in approximately the first 10 days of supernova explosions, indicating diverse photometric behaviors in the early phase. Three EExSNe Ia show relatively brighter peak luminosities and longer rise time compared to those of non-EExSNe Ia. The results indicate that current theoretical models require further refinement to fully capture the early photometric evolution of SNe Ia. Based on the initial high-cadence ugr-band data from the WFST-PS survey, we emphasize that early near-ultraviolet (NUV) observations are indispensable for placing tight constraints on the explosion mechanisms and progenitor systems of SNe Ia.

 - **Abstract**
 We present comprehensive photometric and spectroscopic observations of a transitional type Ia SN 2024aedt, discovered by the 2.5-meter Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST) within one day of the explosion. Its light curve is characterized by a peak absolute magnitude of $M_B = -18.49 \pm 0.03$ mag and a decline rate of $\Delta m_{15}(B) = 1.53 \pm 0.36$ mag, placing the object on the $\Delta m_{15}(B)$--$M_B$ diagram in the transition region between normal and subluminous SNe Ia. Furthermore, the early-color evolution and host galaxy environment of SN 2024aedt underscore its transitional nature, sharing properties with both normal and 91bg-like SNe Ia. Light-curve modeling with MOSFiT yields a synthesized $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$ mass of $0.414 \pm 0.042\,M_{\odot}$ and a total ejecta mass of $0.548 \pm 0.108\,M_{\odot}$. A comparison with theoretical models suggests that the evolutionary trend can be broadly explained by both delayed-detonation (DDT) and double-detonation (DDet) scenarios while possible early-excess emissions predicted by DDet cannot be identified given the limited detections soon after the SN explosion. Although the overall spectral evolution of SN 2024aedt is similar to that of other transitional SNe Ia, the spectroscopic comparison reveals diversity in the early-phase blue-end features, which becomes more homogeneous at later phases. The result indicates the importance of early-time observations in understanding the origin of SN Ia diversity.

 - **Abstract**
 The 21 cm bispectrum (BS) offers a powerful probe of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), but its observational access is severely hindered by dominant astrophysical foregrounds. Considering Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) observations at $154.2~\mathrm{MHz}$ ($z=8.2$), we mitigate the foregrounds with Smooth Component Filtering (SCF) and estimate the 21 cm BS. We validate the pipeline using a simulated 21 cm signal and show that the input BS is recovered for modes $k_{\parallel} \ge [k_\parallel]_f=0.135~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. Applied to actual data, the SCF produces substantial foreground suppression, reducing the amplitude of the cylindrical BS $B(k_{1\perp},k_{2\perp},k_{3\perp},k_{1\parallel},k_{2\parallel})$ by $3-4$ orders of magnitude. The artifacts due to the missing frequency channels in the data are also suppressed. The resulting EoR window is significantly cleaner at small $k_{\perp}$. We adopt the region $(k_{1 \perp},k_{2 \perp},k_{3 \perp})\leq 0.026~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ and $(k_{1\parallel},k_{2\parallel},k_{3\parallel})>0.135~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ to evaluate the 3D spherical BS and constrain the EoR signal. By combining estimates over all triangle shapes, we place the lower and upper limits on the mean cube brightness temperature fluctuations $\Delta^3$. The estimates are consistent with statistical fluctuations from system noise. The most stringent lower limit $\Delta^3_{\rm LL}=-(1.25\times 10^4)^3~{\rm mK}^3$ and upper limit $\Delta^3_{\rm UL}=(1.22\times 10^4)^3~{\rm mK}^3$ are obtained at $k_1=0.281~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. Additional observing time will reduce the noise level and enable substantially tighter constraints on the EoR signal.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the detection and nature of 5.6~\mu m MIRI-red sources in the MIRI Deep Imaging Survey (MIDIS), covering 2.4~arcmin$^2$ in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field. MIDIS is the deepest JWST/MIRI survey to date, probing faint limits and enabling studies of rare high-redshift galaxy populations. We define MIRI-red sources as those detected at 5$\sigma$ significance in MIRI/F560W with red colors: $m_{\rm F444W} - m_{\rm F560W} \ge 0.5$. Using an empirical methodology, we estimate the purity and completeness of MIRI detections and find that a 5-sigma detection at 28.75 mag has a purity of 92\% and completeness of 54\%. We identify seven MIRI-red galaxy candidates, including an F115W dropout consistent with a high-redshift galaxy candidate. We explore possible physical origins for the MIRI-red population, including active galactic nuclei, dust-obscured galaxies, extreme emission-line galaxies, evolved stellar populations, and Little Red Dots (LRDs). Given the proximity of the F444W and F560W filters and the depth of MIDIS, MIRI-red galaxies are consistent with emission-line galaxies with $EW_0(H\alpha) \ge 750$ Å or $EW_0(H\beta + [OIII]) \ge 600$ Å, or high-redshift Balmer breaks of at least 1.6. We also discuss an extreme MIRI-red galaxy undetected in F444W, a potential MIRI-only source, for which we derive $EW_0(H\alpha) \sim 6000$ Å and $EW_0(H\beta + [OIII]) \sim 4000$ Å, or high-$z$ LRD analogs with Balmer breaks of 6.3. Finally, we find fewer MIRI-red detections than expected from extrapolations of the H$\alpha$ or H$\beta$+[OIII] line luminosity functions, consistent with previous deep searches, while the absence of $z>10$ LRD candidates agrees with theoretical expectations for the MIDIS volume.

 - **Abstract**
 Lithium plays a unique role in astrophysics, as it is a powerful diagnostic for the physics and evolution of low-mass stars, Galactic archaeology, and cosmology. We review the Li observations in stars at different phases of their evolution, the strengths and the limitations of the current theoretical stellar models to explain the Li abundance data, our understanding of the Li sources and of the evolution of Li through- out the Galactic history. Key takeaways from the current state of the research in the field are: 1) Stellar evolution models accounting for fundamental transport processes of chemical species and angular momentum hold the promise of providing a common stellar Li depletion explanation to the Li abundance patterns observed in all Galactic stellar populations, including the dip and the plateau(s). 2) Novae are most probably the main source of Li in the Galaxy, on observational (but not yet theoretically established) grounds. 3) Radial migration of stars in the Galactic disk holds the key to understand many aspects of the Li evolution in the Milky Way.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new method for solving the relativistic Vlasov--Maxwell system of equations, applicable to a wide range of extreme high-energy-density astrophysical and laboratory environments. The method directly discretizes the kinetic equation on a high-dimensional phase-space grid using a discontinuous Galerkin finite element approach, yielding a high-order, conservative numerical scheme that is free from the Poisson noise inherent to traditional Monte-Carlo methods. A novel and flexible velocity-space mapping technique enables the efficient treatment of the wide range of energy scales characteristic of relativistic plasmas, including QED pair-production discharges, instabilities in strongly magnetized plasmas surrounding neutron stars, and relativistic magnetic reconnection. Our noise-free approach is capable of providing unique insight into plasma dynamics, enabling detailed analysis of electromagnetic emission and fine-scale phase-space structure.

 - **Abstract**
 UV slopes ($\beta$) are a powerful diagnostics for galaxies at the Epoch of Reionization, tracing star formation, ISM ionization, and the escape fraction $f_{esc}$ of ionizing photons. Studies at low and intermediate z find a gradual $\beta$ reddening with time and steeper slopes for fainter galaxies, however recent JWST studies reveal a flattening of this trend at $z>7$. We want measure $\beta$ for galaxies at $z>7.5$ using the strong lensing around massive galaxy clusters to observe high-redshift and faint galaxies. The low-brightness regime is of particular interest for reionization, as most of the recent models of this process posit that numerous faint galaxies are the prime drivers of reionization. We use NIRCam and NIRSpec data from CANUCS, Technicolor, JUMPS, Silver Bullet, UNCOVER and MEGASCIENCE across 7 strong lensing fields. We find galaxies down to $M_{UV}\sim-16$ and 7.5<z<12.5. We measure \b{eta} with a forward-modelling procedure and estimate $f_{esc}$ for a subsample with emission line data using a relation, calibrated from a low-z sample, with UV slope, galaxy size and H$\beta$ equivalent width. We find 378 galaxies (45 with spectrum), yielding average values $\beta=-2.3\pm0.4$, $z=8.5\pm1.0$, and $M_{UV}=-18\pm1$. We find no significant $\beta$ evolution across our redshift range, suggesting a flattening of the $\beta-z$ trend above $z\sim7.5$. We find a weak negative trend between $\beta$ and $M_{UV}$. For 14 galaxies we estimate an average $f_{esc}=0.26\pm0.22$. The flat trend of $\beta$ at $z>7.5$ suggests similar properties between $300$ and $600 Myr$ after the Big Bang. The weak trend between $\beta$ and $M_{UV}$ suggests an analogous composition for low- and high-mass galaxies' ISM, likely due to a lack of time for dust buildup. While average $f_{esc}$ is higher than necessary to ionize the IGM by z~6, the model extrapolated at low-z may overestimate its value.
#### The spectral state transition of Mkn 590, a potential link between AGNs and X-ray binaries?

 - **Abstract**
 The Seyfert galaxy Markarian 590 offers a rare glimpse into the dynamic life cycle of black hole accretion, captured across multiple wavelengths from the years 1975 to 2025. Using the decade-long multi-band observations from the Swift observatory, we capture a clear spectral state transition analogous to those seen in X-ray binaries but seldom observed in a single AGN. We track a complete AGN state transition in real time, as the source evolves from a faint, hard X-ray state to a bright, UV- and soft X-ray dominated phase. The X-ray loudness parameter $\alpha_{ox}$ follows a pronounced 'V'-shaped dependence on Eddington ratio $\lambda_{Edd}$, with a break at $\lambda_{Edd}$ = 0.021 +/- 0.008, coinciding with thresholds identified in population studies of changing-look quasars and X-ray binaries. Across this transition, Mkn 590 evolves through distinct accretion regimes in the Hardness Intensity Diagrams (HID): faint, flaring, transitional, and bright, on a timescale of $\sim$10 years, which is well below classical viscous timescales for a geometrically thin disk but in agreement with the propagation of thermal wavefronts in the inner disk. When placed on the Fundamental Plane of black hole activity, the source broadly follows the expected radio/X-ray mass scaling, though with a 70% flatter slope, pointing towards a persistent coronal-jet coupling even in radiatively efficient states. Together, our results establish Mkn 590 as a rare, time-resolved case of AGN state transitions and offer compelling evidence for scale-invariant accretion physics across the black hole mass spectrum.
