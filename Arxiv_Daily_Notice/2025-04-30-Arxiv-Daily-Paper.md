 - **Abstract**
 Field-level inference has emerged as a promising framework to fully harness the cosmological information encoded in next-generation galaxy surveys. It involves performing Bayesian inference to jointly estimate the cosmological parameters and the initial conditions of the cosmic field, directly from the observed galaxy density field. Yet, the scalability and efficiency of sampling algorithms for field-level inference of large-scale surveys remain unclear. To address this, we introduce a standardized benchmark using a fast and differentiable simulator for the galaxy density field based on \texttt{JaxPM}. We evaluate a range of sampling methods, including standard Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) without and within a Gibbs scheme, and both adjusted and unadjusted microcanonical samplers (MAMS and MCLMC). These methods are compared based on their efficiency, in particular the number of model evaluations required per effective posterior sample. Our findings emphasize the importance of carefully preconditioning latent variables and demonstrate the significant advantage of (unadjusted) MCLMC for scaling to $\geq 10^6$-dimensional problems. We find that MCLMC outperforms adjusted samplers by over an order-of-magnitude, with a mild scaling with the dimension of our inference problem. This benchmark, along with the associated publicly available code, is intended to serve as a basis for the evaluation of future field-level sampling strategies.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the potential of optical intensity interferometry to extract angularly resolved information from supernova explosions, introducing the "expanding ejecta method" (EEM) as a robust alternative to the classical expanding photosphere method (EPM). Foreseeing future improvements to intensity interferometers of large light collection area ($25\pi\,\rm{m}^2$ per telescope) equipped with spectral multiplexing ($10^4$ spectral resolution) and fast photodetectors ($10\,\mathrm{ps}$ timing resolution, $50\%$ overall efficiency), we demonstrate that high signal-to-noise measurements of the visibility modulus are achievable for Type IIP (Type Ia) supernovae out to $3~(12)\,\mathrm{Mpc}$. By focusing on generic line emission and absorption in ballistic ejecta, the EEM can relax assumptions about spherical symmetry, blackbody radiation, and extinction. The EEM enables angular diameter distances to be determined with $\sim2\%$ precision for supernovae of apparent magnitude $m = 12$ from a 60-hour observation by an intensity interferometer with those same instrumental specifications. We argue that the EEM is significantly more robust to modeling uncertainties and systematic effects than (variants of) the EPM. In a companion paper, we show how the EEM can be used to provide geometric anchors for cosmic distance ladder calibration, or to construct a wholly independent Hubble diagram based on angular diameter distances.

 - **Abstract**
 The large-scale morphology of Milky Way (MW)-mass dark matter (DM) halos is shaped by two key processes: filamentary accretion from the cosmic web and interactions with massive satellites. Disentangling their contributions is essential for understanding galaxy evolution and constructing accurate mass models of the MW. We analyze the time-dependent structure of MW-mass halos from zoomed cosmological-hydrodynamical simulations by decomposing their mass distribution into spherical harmonic expansions. We find that the dipole ($\ell=1$) and quadrupole ($\ell=2$) moments dominate the gravitational power spectrum, encoding key information about the halo's shape and its interaction with the cosmic environment. While the dipole reflects transient perturbations from infalling satellites and damps on dynamical timescales, the quadrupole -- linked to the halo's triaxiality -- is a persistent feature. We show that the quadrupole's orientation aligns with the largest filaments, imprinting a long-lived memory on the halo's morphology even in its inner regions ($\sim30$ kpc). At the virial radius, the quadrupole distortion can reach 1-2 times the spherical density, highlighting the importance of environment in shaping MW-mass halos. Using multivariate Singular Spectrum Analysis, we successfully disentangle the effects of satellite mergers and filamentary accretion on quadrupole. We find that the quadrupolar response induced by LMC-mass satellites has an order of magnitude larger gravitational power than in spherically symmetric MW models. This highlights the need for models that incorporate the MW's asymmetry and time-evolution, with direct consequences for observable structures such as disk warps, the LMC-induced wake, and stellar tracers -- particularly in the era of precision astrometry.

 - **Abstract**
 Aims. Outflows from active galactic nuclei are invoked as the principal feedback process regulating the co-evolution of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies. Because of their multi-phase and multi-scale nature, an exhaustive description of these winds should exploit multiple tracers. However, connecting various outflow features remains a challenge. The aim of this work is to provide a complete characterisation of outflows in a sample of z$\sim$5 quasars, by exploiting the combination of different emission and absorption tracers. Methods. We analysed the UV/optical and FIR continuum, line emission, and absorption in a sample of 39 z$\sim$5 quasars observed with VLT/X-Shooter and ALMA (available for six objects). We identified broad and narrow absorption lines associated with the quasar and emission lines to determine black hole masses and bolometric luminosities. Results. Our sample encompasses massive (log($M_{\text{BH,MgII}}/M_\odot$) = 8.5-10) and luminous (log($L_{\text{bol}}$/(erg/s)) = 46.9-48) quasars at redshift 5-5.7. They display powerful ionised outflows detected in both emission and absorption, with velocities exceeding 48,000 km/s in some cases, and lie above the local black hole - host galaxy mass relation, exhibiting a behaviour similar to that of z$\gtrsim$6 quasars. These findings suggest a phase of efficient black hole feedback occurring at redshift z$\gtrsim$6 and likely persisting down to z$\sim$5, characterised by rapid black hole growth exceeding that of the host galaxy. The fraction of quasars with outflow detections in absorption is higher for larger CIV-MgII velocity shifts, suggesting that while the physical mechanisms powering the two outflow phenomena detected in emission and absorption may differ, a correlation exists between them.

 - **Abstract**
 The evolution of galaxies is significantly influenced by the environments they inhabit. While high-density regions, such as clusters of galaxies have been widely studied, the dynamics and quenching processes in intermediate environments remain less explored. These systems provide a valuable context for understanding the transition of galaxies from active star formation to quiescence. This study aims to characterise the astrophysical properties of galaxies in intermediate-mass galaxy groups $(13.5 \leq \log(M_{200}/M_{\odot}) \leq 13.7)$, with a focus on their evolutionary pathways and the key processes driving their transition through the green valley (GV) and green zone (GZ). Using the Illustris TNG300-1 hydrodynamical cosmological simulations, we classified galaxies based on their trajectories and environment into five categories: group galaxies (GRs), backsplash galaxies (BSs), recent infallers (RINs), infall galaxies (INs), and field galaxies (FGs). We examined their optical colours in the $(u-r)$-stellar mass diagram, specific star formation rates (sSFRs), gas fractions, and stellar mass evolution from $z=0.5$ to $z=0$. At $z=0$, FGs dominate the blue cloud, while GRs show progressive reddening. BSs exhibit the highest fraction of green galaxies, highlighting their transitional nature, whereas RINs show a rapid quenching upon entering $R_{200}$. Our results reveal that the timing of group entry and environmental effects, such as gas depletion, play a critical role in galaxy quenching. Green BS and RINs follow distinct evolutionary tracks, with the latter undergoing more rapid changes due to later infall into more massive systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the post-merger evolution of binary neutron star merger (BNSM) requires accurate modeling of neutrino transport and microphysics including neutrino flavor conversions. Many previous studies have suggested that fast flavor instability (FFI) and collisional flavor instability (CFI) pervade inner regions of BNSM remnant, and they could impact on fluid dynamics and r-process nucleosynthesis. In this work, we re-examine prospects of occurrences of FFI and CFI using Boltzmann neutrino transport, assuming a frozen fluid background obtained from a numerical relativity simulation of BNSM. We pay special attention to a case involving a long-lived ($>1\,$ s) hypermassive neutron star (HMNS). Apart from confirming the claim that these flavor instabilities can occur in BNSM remnants, some new insights are revealed. We identify multiple mechanisms responsible for generating electron neutrino lepton number angular crossings, corresponding to a key indicator of FFI onset, which differ notably from those in black hole (BH) accretion disk systems. We also find that the appearance of positive chemical potential of electron-type neutrinos is a necessary, though not sufficient, condition for FFI, which offers a valuable diagnostic tool for predicting FFI based solely on fluid properties. For CFI, their growth rates are generally lower than FFI, but they can persistently occur in most of the accretion disk up to $\sim 1\,$ s. We also find that neglecting contributions of heavy-leptonic neutrinos results in overestimating growth rate and area of unstable regions of CFI. Our result suggests that FFI (CFI) tends to occur transiently (persistently) and locally (widespread in the disk), and FFI is more sensitive to the central compact object (HMNS or BH) than CFI, though more self-consistent simulations with incorporating effects of flavor conversions are needed to confirm these claims.

 - **Abstract**
 We compare the self-similar baryonic mass fraction scaling relations between galaxy clusters from the South Pole Telescope Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SPT-SZ) survey and the IllustrisTNG state-of-the-art magnetohydrodynamical cosmological simulations. Using samples of 218 (TNG100) and 1605 (TNG300) friends-of-friends (FoF) haloes within $0.0 \leq z \leq 1.5$ and $M_{200c} \geq 7 \times 10^{13} M_{\odot}$, we fit the scaling relations using Simple Power Law (SPL), Broken Power Law (BPL), and General Double Power Law (GDPL) models through non-linear least squares regression. The SPL model reveals null slopes for the baryonic fraction as a function of redshift, consistent with self-similarity. Observations and simulations agree within $1{-}2\sigma$, suggesting comparable baryonic scaling slopes. We identify $\sim$13.8$-$14.1 per cent of baryons as "missing", primarily in the form of intracluster light (ICL) across all halo masses and warm gas in low-mass haloes. High-mass haloes ($\log_{10}(M_{500c}/M_{\odot}) \geq 14$) adhere to self-similarity, while low-mass haloes exhibit deviations, with the breakpoint occurring at $\log_{10}(M_{500c}/M_{\odot}) \sim 14$, where baryons are redistributed to the outskirts. Our findings suggest that the undetected warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) and baryon redistribution by feedback mechanisms are complementary solutions to the "missing baryon" problem.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the construction and early results of ESPARTACO 2, the new stellar spectrograph built for research and education at the Astronomical Observatory of the Universidad de los Andes in Bogotá, Colombia. This instrument offers several resolutions from 20,000 in first order using a 50 $\mu$m fiber, to 100,000 in second order in the near infrared. Precise radial-velocity measurements are made possible by simultaneous wavelength calibration. Combined with the 40-cm Meade telescope located at our facilities, a limiting magnitude of 6 is reached. This instrument is a considerable improvement over its predecessor in throughput, reliability and ease.
#### Atmospheric C/O Ratios of Sub-Neptunes with Magma Oceans: Homemade rather than Inherited

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, the James Webb Space Telescope has enabled detailed spectroscopic characterization of sub-Neptune atmospheres. With detections of carbon- and oxygen-bearing species such as CO, CO$_2$, CH$_4$, and H$_2$O, a central question is whether the atmospheric C/O ratio, commonly used to trace formation location in giant planets, can serve a similar diagnostic role for sub-Neptunes. We use the global chemical equilibrium framework of Schlichting & Young (2022) to quantify how magma ocean-atmosphere interactions affect the atmospheric C/O ratio. We find that the resulting C/O ratios range from several orders of magnitude below solar to a few times solar. The atmospheric C/O ratio in sub-Neptunes is therefore not inherited from the protoplanetary disk, but instead emerges from chemical equilibrium between the atmosphere and the underlying magma ocean. Planetary mass, atmospheric mass fraction, and thermal state all strongly influence the atmospheric C/O ratio. In addition, carbon partitioning into the metal phase typically reduces the atmospheric C/O ratio substantially, particularly for atmospheric mass fractions less than a few percent. Finally, we couple the deep equilibrium compositions to 1D atmospheric models that self-consistently solve for the pressure-temperature structure and chemical composition, including photochemistry. We find that the C/O ratio varies with altitude under low vertical mixing conditions (K$_\text{zz}=10^4$ cm$^2$s$^{-1}$), but remains constant under strong mixing (K$_\text{zz}=10^7$ cm$^2$s$^{-1}$). Our results imply that observed C/O ratios of sub-Neptunes can be used to probe their interiors. Specifically, C/O ratios much lower than host star values would imply an underlying magma ocean with iron metal having sequestered significant amounts of carbon.

 - **Abstract**
 Pulsar Wind nebulae (PWNe), are among the most efficient particle accelerators in the Universe, however understanding the physical conditions and the magnetic geometry in their inner region has always proved elusive. X-ray polarization provides now a unique opportunity to investigate the magnetic field structure and turbulence properties close to where high energy particles are accelerated. Here we report on the recent X-ray polarization measurement of the PWN 3C 58 by the International X-ray Polarimeter Explorer (IXPE). 3C 58 is a young system displaying a characteristic jet-torus structure which, unlike other PWNe, is seen almost edge on. This nebula shows a high level of integrated polarization ~ 22% at an angle ~ 97deg, with an implied magnetic field oriented parallel to the major axis of the inner torus, suggesting a toroidal magnetic geometry with little turbulence in the interior, and an intrinsic level of polarization possibly approaching the theoretical limit for synchrotron emission. No significant detection of a polarized signal from the associated pulsar was found. These results confirm that the internal structure of young PWNe is far less turbulent than previously predicted, and at odds with multidimensional numerical simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 Brightest cluster galaxies (BCG) are today passive and very massive galaxies at the center of their clusters, still accreting mass through swallowing companions, and flows of cold gas, regulated by radio-mode active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback. However, their formation history is still a matter of debate. We report new results based on millimeter observations performed with the Northern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) interferometer, mapping the cold molecular gas (CO) that feeds the star formation of distant BCGs. We selected three among the strongest cool-core BCGs at intermediate redshifts ($z\simeq0.4$), namely RX 1532, MACS 1447, and CHIPS 1911. Previous unresolved millimeter observations and multi-wavelength analysis showed that they are among the most star forming (${\rm SFR}\simeq100~ M_\odot/{\rm yr}$) and gas rich ($M_{H_2}\simeq10^{11}~M_\odot$) BCGs at intermediate redshifts. The selected BCGs are thus caught in a phase of rapid mass assembly, which makes them ideal targets for high-resolution observations of their molecular gas. By combining NOEMA intensity and velocity maps with archival images from the Hubble Space Telescope, we detect in-situ star formation, filaments of accreting cold gas likely regulated by AGN feedback, disturbed morphology associated with tidal tails of molecular gas, as well as gas compression and tails originated from stripping of gas. While effective condensation of the intra-cluster medium is required to explain the large molecular gas reservoirs, the BCGs exhibit a broad variety of environment-driven mechanisms responsible for the processing of their cold gas: flows of cooling gas (RX 1532), ram pressure or sloshing of the intra-cluster medium (MACS 1447), and galactic tides (CHIPS 1911). This study thus sheds new insights on the physical mechanisms responsible for the mass assembly of galaxies hosting AGN at the center of clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. It is important to determine which Galactic cosmic-ray sources can accelerate particles to the knee of the cosmic ray spectrum at a few PeV, and in particular whether supernova remnants may contribute. Current models for particle acceleration in very young remnants assume the circumstellar material consists of smooth, freely expanding winds. There is strong evidence that some supernovae expand into much denser circumstellar material including dense shells ejected by eruptions shortly before explosion. Aims. We investigate the effects of dense circumstellar shells on particle acceleration in supernova shocks during the first few years post-explosion, to quantify whether such interaction supernovae may act as PeVatrons. Methods. We used the pion code to model the circumstellar medium around Luminous Blue Variables after having a brief episode with a mass-loss rate of up to dM/dt = 2Msol/yr. Consequently, we performed spherically symmetric 1-D simulations using our time-dependent acceleration-code RATPaC in which we simultaneously solve the transport equations for cosmic-rays, magnetic turbulence, and the hydrodynamical flow of the thermal plasma in the test-particle limit. Results. We find that the interaction with the circumstellar shells can significantly boost the maximum energy by enhancing particle escape during the onset of the shock-shell interaction followed by the reacceleration of the shock propagating into a medium with a pre-amplified field. Early interactions boost the maximum energy to a greater degree and interactions within the first 5 months after explosion can increase Emax to more then 1 PeV.
#### Multi-Component Ionized Gas Outflows in a Hot Dust-Obscured Galaxy W2026+0716 with Keck/OSIRIS

 - **Abstract**
 We present narrowband-filtered integral field unit (IFU) observations of the Hot Dust-Obscured Galaxy (Hot DOG) WISE J202615.27$+$071624.0 (hereafter W2026$+$0716) at redshift $z=2.570$ using Keck/OSIRIS. Our analysis reveals a multi-component ionized gas outflow structure in this heavily obscured AGN host galaxy. Multi-component Gaussian decomposition of the [O III] and H$\alpha$ emission lines uncovers extremely broad and asymmetric profiles, characteristic of AGN-driven outflows. Kinematic mapping shows spatially distinct structures: the [O III] and H$\alpha$ dominated components (with radii of $1.20 \pm 0.56$ kpc) are separated by a projected offset of $\sim 1.1$ kpc and exhibit divergent velocity regimes. The [O III] outflow reaches a velocity of 3210 $\pm$ 50 km s$^{-1}$, while the H$\alpha$ outflow component attains 2310 $\pm$ 840 km s$^{-1}$. Dynamical modeling supports a biconical outflow structure, with [O III] and H$\alpha$ emissions dominating separate cones and significant dust obscuration of the redshifted outflow. Their comparable momentum outflow rates and energy outflow rates suggest a potential physical connection in their driving mechanisms. Spectral energy distribution (SED) analysis reveals anomalous optical/UV excess, attributed to AGN photon scattering by dust or outflowing material, classifying W2026+0716 as a "Blue Hot DOG". The derived outflow timescale ($\sim10^{5}$ yr) aligns with the evolutionary phase of Blue Hot DOGs, suggesting AGN feedback operates persistently during this transitional stage.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive analysis of the time-resolved spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the blazar OJ 287 over a 15-year period (2008-2023), using multi-wavelength data. In the $\gamma$-ray band, multiple flaring episodes were observed, with the strongest flare reaching a peak flux of $(5.60\pm1.11)\times10^{-7}\:{\rm photons\:cm^{-2}\:s^{-1}}$ on MJD 55869.03 (04 November 2011). In the optical/UV band, the source was in an active state between MJD 57360 (04 December 2015) and 57960 (26 July 2017), during which the highest flux of $(1.07\pm0.02)\times10^{-10}\:{\rm erg\:cm^{-2}\:s^{-1}}$ was observed on MJD 57681.23 (20 October 2016). In the X-ray band, both the flux and spectral index exhibit variability. To investigate the origin of the broadband emission from OJ 287, we systematically modeled 739 quasi-simultaneous SEDs using a leptonic model that self-consistently accounts for particle injection and cooling. This analysis is possible thanks to the recent development of a surrogate neural-network-based model, trained on kinetic simulations. This innovative, time-resolved, neural network-based approach overcomes the limitations of traditional single-epoch SED modeling, enabling to explore the temporal evolution of key model parameters, such as the magnetic field strength, Doppler factor, and electron injection distribution, across different states of the source. We identified distinct emission states characterized by unique combinations of magnetic field $ B $, electron index $ p $, and Doppler boost $ \delta $, associated to different underlying mechanisms such as varying acceleration processes (e.g., shocks, turbulence) and magnetic confinement. The analysis provides insights into the jet physics processes, including particle acceleration mechanisms and dynamic changes in the jet structure.

 - **Abstract**
 The eruption of the filament/flux rope generates the coronal perturbations, which further form EUV waves. There are two types of EUV waves, including fast-mode magnetosonic waves and slow waves. In this paper, we first report an event showing the Quasiperiodic Slow-Propagating (QSP) EUV "wave" trains during an M6.4-class flare (SOL2023-02-25T18:40), using multiple observations from SDO/AIA, CHASE/HIS, ASO-S/FMG, SUTRI, and LASCO/C2. The QSP "wave" trains occurred as the filament showed a rapid rise. The QSP "wave" trains have the projected speeds of 50-130 km s$^{-1}$ on the plane of the sky, which is slower than the fast-mode magnetosonic speed in the solar corona. And the calculated period of the QSP wave trains is 117.9 s, which is in good agreement with the associated flare Quasi-Periodic Pulsation (140.3 s). The QSP wave trains could be observed during the entire impulsive phase of the flare and lasted about 30 minutes in the field of view (FOV) of SDO/AIA. About 30 minutes later, they appeared in the FOV of LASCO/C2 and propagated to the northwest. We suggest that the QSP wave trains are probably apparent waves that are caused by the successive stretching of the inclined field lines overlying the eruptive filament. The periodic pattern of the QSP wave trains may be related to the intermittent energy release during the flare.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar nanojets are small-scale jets generated by component magnetic reconnection, characterized by collimated plasma motion perpendicular to the reconnecting magnetic field lines. As an indicator of nanoflare events, they are believed to play a significant role in coronal heating. Using high-resolution extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) imaging observations from the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) onboard the Solar Orbiter mission, we identified 27 nanojets in an erupting filament on September 30, 2024. They are potentially associated with the untwisting of magnetic field lines of the filament. Most nanojets exhibit velocities around 450 km s$^{-1}$, with the fastest reaching approximately 800 km s$^{-1}$, significantly higher than previously reported but comparable to the typical coronal Alfvén speed. To our knowledge, these are the highest speeds ever reported for small-scale jets (less than ~1 Mm wide) in the solar atmosphere. Our findings suggest that these nanoflare-type phenomena can be more dynamic than previously recognized and may contribute to the energy release process of solar eruptions and the heating of coronal active regions.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, there has been considerable debate regarding potential evidence for the dynamical nature of dark energy (DE), particularly in light of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) measurements released by DESI survey. In this work, we propose an agnostic test that simultaneously constrains the dark energy (DE) equation of state (EoS) and probes the possibility of a transition between the quintessence and phantom regimes, or vice versa. Our initial approach is independent of physical priors, allowing the data to determine which behavior best fits the parameters. We then consider a minimally modified gravity theory known as VCDM, into which we can map our initial approximation, placing it within a theoretically stable framework. To this end, we incorporate the most up-to-date datasets available, including BAO measurements from DESI-DR2, Type Ia Supernovae from the PantheonPlus, DESY5, and Union3 samples, as well as Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data from Planck. Our analysis reveals strong and statistically significant evidence for a quintessence-phantom transition across various data combinations. \textit{The strongest evidence is found for Planck+DESI+DESY5, with a significance exceeding $\sim$5$\sigma$ in favor of a quintessence-phantom transition at $z_† = 0.493^{+0.063}_{-0.081}$}. Beyond this redshift, the EoS remains within the phantom regime, while for $z < z_†$, it favors the quintessence regime. Despite this strong indication, \textit{we find that such transitions do not resolve the $H_0$ tension}.

 Aims: We aim to study the near-infrared variability of the T8 dwarfs 2MASS J09393548-2448279 and EQ J1959-3338 by analyzing their $J$-band photometric signal, which can provide new insights into the atmospheric dynamics of cold brown dwarfs. Methods: We used FLAMINGOS-2 on the Gemini South telescope to perform $J$-band differential photometry continuously over 4 h for each target. The resulting light curves have a cadence of 20 s and a photometric uncertainty of 2-4 mmag. Results: We detect periodic variability in both T8 dwarfs, with an amplitude of $16.6\pm0.9$ mmag and a period of $1.364\pm0.012$ h for EQ J1959-3338, which we attribute to rotational modulation. For 2MASS J09393548-2448279, we observe an amplitude of $4.6\pm0.4$ mmag and a period of $1.733\pm0.040$ h, though this periodicity could represent a fraction of a longer period. Conclusions: With the detection of variability in 2MASS J09393548-2448279 and EQ J1959-3338, the number of known variable T8 dwarfs has doubled, making them prime candidates for infrared space-based monitoring and radio observations to investigate atmospheric dynamics and the influence of the magnetic field in very cool atmospheres.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a timing analysis of observations with the Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope of the black hole X-ray transient Swift J1727.8-1613 during its 2023 outburst. We detect, for the first time in a black hole X-ray binary, a prominent dip at ~ 3-15 Hz in the real part of the cross spectrum between high-energy (>25 keV) and low-energy (<10 keV) photons in the Low Hard and Hard Intermediate States, during which the QPO frequency rapidly increases and then stabilizes at ~ 1.0-1.5 Hz. Remarkably, the real part of the cross spectrum reaches negative values at the frequencies around the minimum of the dip, indicative of a phase lag ranging between ${\pi}/2$ and ${\pi}$ in this frequency range. We fit the power spectra and the real and imaginary parts of the cross spectra simultaneously using a multi-Lorentzian model. Among the lag models, the Gaussian phase-lag model provides a slightly better reduced ${\chi}^2$ than the constant phase-lag and constant time-lag models, while it also alleviates the degeneracy associated with those models. From the parameters of the Lorentzian that fits the dip, we estimate the size of the accretion flow, which consistently exceeds 10,000 km as the QPO frequency increases from 0.13 Hz to 2.0 Hz. Furthermore, both the energy-dependent phase-lag and fractional-rms spectra of the dip exhibit a change in trend around 15 keV, with the phase lag dropping and rms reaching a local minimum. These spectra closely resemble the shapes predicted by the time-dependent Comptonization model, vKompth, for a low feedback factor, offering a pathway to explain the radiative properties of the corona. Additionally, the coherence function suggests a diversity of variability components, potentially arising from different parts of the corona.

 - **Abstract**
 Shocks associated with Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections are known to energize charged particles and give rise to Solar Energetic Particles. Many of these energetic particles move ahead of the shock to create a foreshock region. The foreshock region primarily consists of solar wind plasma, exhibiting turbulent velocity and magnetic fields. Such turbulent behavior results from inherent solar wind turbulence modified by energetic particles. We analyze magnetic field data from six such ICME shocks observed by the Wind spacecraft. The analysis of the shock upstream shows that the magnetic power spectral density (PSD) maintains a power-law slope of $-5/3$. We also identify clear intermittent peaks in the PSD. After characterizing these peaks, we investigate various possibilities for their generation. Our analysis indicates that these peaks in the PSD are due to the resonant interaction of Alfvén waves with the bulk solar wind protons and protons with energy up to $10$~keV. However, evidence of Alfvén wave interaction with highly energetic protons is not evident in our analysis, and we anticipate that such evidence is obscured by the prevailing solar wind turbulence in the shock upstream.

 - **Abstract**
 Flat radio spectra of compact jets launched by both supermassive and stellar-mass black holes are explained by an interplay of self-absorbed synchrotron emission up to some distance along the jet and optically thin synchrotron at larger distances (Blandford & Konigl 1979). Their spatial structure is usually studied using core shifts, in which the position of the peak (core) of the emission depends on the frequency. Here, we propose a novel method to fit the spatial dependence of the flux density at a given frequency of the jet and counterjet (when observed) using the theoretical spatial dependencies, which we provide as simple analytical formulae. We apply our method to the spatial structure of the jets in the luminous hard spectral state of the black-hole X-ray binary Swift J1727.8--1613. It was the most resolved continuous jet from an X-ray binary ever observed. We find that the observed approaching jet is significantly intrinsically stronger than the receding one, which we attribute to an increase in the emission of both jets with time (observationally confirmed), together with the light travel effect, causing the receding jet to be observed at an earlier epoch than the approaching one. The jets are relatively slow, with the velocity $\sim(0.3$--$0.4)c$. Our findings imply that the magnetic field strength increased with time. Also, the magnetic flux is much lower than in jets launched by `Magnetically Arrested Disks'. Our method is general, and we propose that it be applied to jets launched by stellar-mass and supermassive black holes.
#### Cosmic superstrings in large volume compactifications: PTAs, LISA and time-varying tension

 - **Abstract**
 The Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background (SGWB) from cosmic superstrings offers one of the few known possibilities to test String Theory within current experimental reach. However, in order to be compatible with the existing constraints, the tension of a cosmic superstring network is required to lie several orders of magnitude below the Planck scale. This is naturally realized in string compactifications where the volume of the extra dimensions is parametrically large (in string units). We estimate the GW spectrum arising from cosmic superstrings in such scenarios, providing analytical formulae as well as numerical results. Crucially, we do so within a fully-fledged string cosmology, taking into account various modified cosmological epochs (such as kination or early matter domination) induced by the presence of moduli and a time-dependent string tension. We show that part of the spectrum generically lies within reach of LISA and ET, with a large class of models predicting a characteristic drop in the amplitude which may be robustly probed by LISA. The corresponding signal would encode information on the dynamics of moduli and reheating. On the other hand, the ultra-high frequency part of the spectrum can be significantly enhanced by a long, early phase of kination with time-varying tension, yielding a spectral index unique to this set-up.
