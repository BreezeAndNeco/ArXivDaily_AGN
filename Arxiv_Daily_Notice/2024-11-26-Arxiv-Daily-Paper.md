 - **Abstract**
 The UV continuum slope of galaxies, $\beta$, is a powerful diagnostic. Understanding the redshift evolution of $\beta$ and its dependence on key galaxy properties can shed light on the evolution of galaxy physical properties over cosmic time. In this study, we present $\beta$ measurements for 295 spectroscopically confirmed galaxies at $5.5<z<14.3$ selected primarily from JADES, where $\beta$ has been measured from high quality JWST NIRSpec/PRISM spectra. We find a median $\beta=-2.3$ across our full sample, and find mild increase in blueness of $\beta$ with increasing redshift and fainter UV magnitudes. Interestingly, we find evidence for the average $\beta$ at $z > 9.5$ to begin to redden, deviating from the trend observed at $z < 9.5$. By producing stacked spectra in bins of redshift and $\beta$, we derive trends between $\beta$ and dust attenuation, metallicity, ionization parameter, and stellar age indicators directly from spectra, finding a lack of dust attenuation to be the dominant driver of bluer $\beta$ values. We further report six galaxies with $\beta<-3.0$, which show a range of spectroscopic properties and signs of significant LyC photon leakage. Finally, we show that the redder $\beta$ values at $z > 9.5$ may require rapid build-up of dust reservoirs in the very early Universe or a significant contribution from the nebular continuum emission to the observed UV spectra, with the nebular continuum fraction depending on the gas temperatures and densities. Our modeling shows that in the absence of dust, nebular emission at $T > 15,000$ K can reproduce the range of $\beta$ that we see in our sample. Higher gas temperatures driven by hot, massive stars can boost the fraction of nebular continuum emission, potentially explaining the observed $\beta$ values as well as bright UV magnitudes seen across galaxies at $z > 10$.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a systematic search for radio active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in dwarf galaxies using recent observations taken by the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS). To select these objects, we first establish a criterion to identify radio-excess AGNs using the infrared-radio correlation (IRRC) parameter, $q$, that describes the tight relation between radio and IR emission in star forming (SF) galaxies. We find a $2\sigma$ threshold of $q < 1.94$ to select radio-excess AGNs, which is derived from a sample of $\sim 7,000$ galaxies across the full mass range in the NASA-Sloan Atlas (NSA) that have radio and IR detections from VLASS and the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer, respectively. We create catalogs of radio-excess AGNs and SF galaxies and make these available to the community. Applying our criterion to dwarf galaxies with stellar masses $M_\star \lesssim 3 \times 10^9 M_\odot$ and redshifts $z \le 0.15$, and carefully removing interlopers, we find 10 radio-excess AGNs with radio-optical positional offsets between $\sim$ 0 and 2.3 arcseconds (0 - 2.7 kpc). Based on statistical arguments and emission line diagnostics, we expect the majority of these radio-excess AGNs to be associated with the dwarf host galaxies rather than background AGNs. Five of the objects have evidence for hosting AGNs at other wavelengths, and 5 objects are identified as AGNs in dwarf galaxies for the first time. We also identify 8 variable radio sources in dwarf galaxies by comparing the VLASS epoch 1 and epoch 2 observations to FIRST detections presented in arXiv:1909.04670.
#### Ionization chemistry in the inner disc: a combined treatment of ionic and thermionic emission and arbitrary grain size distributions

 - **Abstract**
 In the inner regions of protoplanetary discs, ionization chemistry controls the fluid viscosity, and is thus key to understanding various accretion, outflow and planet formation processes. The ionization is driven by thermal and non-thermal processes in the gas-phase, as well as by dust-gas interactions that lead to grain charging and ionic and thermionic emission from grain surfaces. The latter dust-gas interactions are moreover a strong function of the grain size distribution. However, analyses of chemical networks that include ionic/thermionic emission have so far only considered grains of a single size (or only approximately treated the effects of a size distribution), while analyses that include a distribution of grain sizes have ignored ionic/thermionic emission. Here, we: (1) investigate a general chemical network, widely applicable in inner disc regions, that includes gas-phase reactions, ionic and thermionic emission, and an arbitrary grain size distribution; (2) present a numerical method to solve this network in equilibrium; and (3) elucidate a general method to estimate the chemical time-scale. We show that: (a) approximating a grain size distribution by an "effective dust-to-gas ratio" (as done in previous work) can predict significantly inaccurate grain charges; and (b) grain charging significantly alters grain collisional time-scales in the inner disc. For conditions generally found in the inner disc, this work facilitates: (i) calculation of fluid resistivities and viscosity; and (ii) inclusion of the effect of grain charging on grain fragmentation and coagulation (a critical effect that is often ignored).

 - **Abstract**
 We present starkiller, an open-source Python package for forward-modeling flux retrieval from integral field unit spectrograph (IFU) datacubes. Starkiller simultaneously provides stellar spectral classification, relative velocity, and line-of-sight extinction for all sources in a catalog, alongside a source-subtracted datacube. It performs synthetic difference imaging by simulating all catalog sources in the field of view, using the catalog for positions and fluxes to scale stellar models, independent of the datacube. This differencing method is particularly powerful for subtracting both point-sources and trailed or even streaked sources from extended astronomical objects. We demonstrate starkiller's effectiveness in improving observations of extended sources in dense stellar fields for VLT/MUSE observations of comets, asteroids and nebulae. We also show that starkiller can treat satellite-impacted VLT/MUSE observations. The package could be applied to tasks as varied as dust extinction in clusters and stellar variability; the stellar modeling using Gaia fluxes is provided as a standalone function. The techniques can be expanded to imagers and to other IFUs.
#### Unusual intra-burst variations of polarization states in FRB 20210912A and FRB 20230708A : Effects of plasma birefringence?

 - **Abstract**
 Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are highly energetic events of short-duration intense radio emission, the origin of which remains elusive till date. Polarization of the FRB signals carry information about the emission source as well as the magneto-ionic media the signal passes through before reaching terrestrial radio telescopes. Currently known FRBs show a diverse range of polarization, sometimes with complex features, making it challenging to describe them in a unified model. FRB 20230708A and FRB 20210912A are two bright and highly polarized FRBs detected in the Commensal Real-time ASKAP Fast Transients (CRAFT) survey with the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) that exhibit time-dependent conversion between linear and circular polarization as well as intra-burst (apparent) variation of Faraday rotation measure. We investigate the intra-burst temporal evolution of the polarization state of radio emission in these two events using the Poincaré sphere representation and find that the trajectories of the polarization state are well described by great circles on the Poincaré sphere. These polarization features may be signatures of a transition between two partially coherent orthogonal polarization modes or propagation through a birefringent medium. We find that the observed variations of the polarization states of these two FRBs are qualitatively consistent a magnetospheric origin of the bursts and the effects of propagation through a birefringent medium with linearly polarized modes in the outer magnetosphere or near-wind region of a neutron star.

 - **Abstract**
 Turbulent magnetic fields are to some extent a universal feature in astrophysical phenomena. Charged particles that encounter these turbulence get on average accelerated according to the so-called second-order Fermi process. However, in most astrophysical environments there are additional competing processes, such as different kinds of first-order energy changes and particle escape, that effect the resulting momentum distribution of the particles. In this work we provide to our knowledge the first semi-analytical solution of the isotropic steady-state momentum diffusion equation including continuous and catastrophic momentum changes that can be applied to any arbitrary astrophysical system of interest. Here, we adopt that the assigned magnetic turbulence is constrained on a finite range and the particle flux vanishes beyond these boundaries. Consequently, we show that the so-called pile-up bump -- that has for some special cases long been established -- is a universal feature of stochastic acceleration that emerges around the momentum $\chi_{\rm eq}$ where acceleration and continuous loss are in equilibrium if the particle's residence time in the system is sufficient at $\chi_{\rm eq}$. In general, the impact of continuous and catastrophic momentum changes plays a crucial role in the shape of the steady-state momentum distribution of the accelerated particles, where simplified unbroken power-law approximations are often not adequate.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper we provide a detailed investigation of the energisation processes in two-dimensional, two and a half-dimensional and three-dimensional collapsing magnetic trap models. Using kinematic magnetohydrodynamic models of collapsing magnetic traps, we examine the importance of Fermi acceleration in comparison with betatron acceleration in these models. We extend previous work by investigating particle orbits in two-dimensional models without and with a guide field component and from full three-dimensional models. We compare the outcomes for the different models and how they depend on the chosen initial conditions. While in the literature betatron acceleration has been emphasised as the major mechanism for particle energisation in collapsing magnetic traps, we find that Fermi acceleration can play a significant role as well for particle orbits with suitable initial conditions.
#### Avoiding lensing bias in cosmic shear analysis

 - **Abstract**
 We show, using the pseudo-$C_\ell$ technique, how to estimate cosmic shear and galaxy-galaxy lensing power spectra that are insensitive to the effects of multiple sources of lensing bias including source-lens clustering, magnification bias and obscuration effects. All of these effects are of significant concern for ongoing and near-future Stage-IV cosmic shear surveys. Their common attribute is that they all introduce a cosmological dependence into the selection of the galaxy shear sample. Here, we show how a simple adaptation of the pseudo-$C_\ell$ method can help to suppress these biases to negligible levels in a model-independent way. Our approach is based on making pixelised maps of the shear field and then using a uniform weighting of those shear maps when extracting power spectra. To produce unbiased measurements, the weighting scheme must be independent of the cosmological signal, which makes the commonly-used inverse-variance weighting scheme unsuitable for cosmic shear measurements. We demonstrate this explicitly. A frequently-cited motivation for using inverse-variance weights is to minimize the errors on the resultant power spectra. We find that, for a Stage-IV-like survey configuration, this motivation is not compelling: the precision of power spectra recovered from uniform-weighted maps is only very slightly degraded compared to those recovered from an inverse-variance analysis, and we predict no degradation in cosmological parameter constraints. We suggest that other 2-point statistics, such as real-space correlation functions, can be rendered equally robust to these lensing biases by applying those estimators to pixelised shear maps using a uniform weighting scheme.
