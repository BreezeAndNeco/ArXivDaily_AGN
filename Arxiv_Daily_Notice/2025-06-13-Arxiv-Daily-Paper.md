 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy mergers play a critical role in driving galaxy evolution, especially by transforming galaxy morphology, redistributing the gas around galaxies, triggering AGN activity and star formation. We present the Cosmic Owl, a galaxy merger at $z=1.14$, identified in the COSMOS field. Deep imaging and spectroscopy from JWST, ALMA, and VLA reveal a complex system of twin collisional ring galaxies, exhibiting a nearly identical morphology. The grism spectra from the JWST COSMOS-3D program confirm that both galaxies host an AGN. A bipolar radio jet from one AGN extends to strike the merging front. In addition, we detect a starburst at the merging front, characterized by luminous extended nebular line emission and a massive cold gas reservoir. This starburst is likely triggered by interstellar shocks induced by galaxy collision and the AGN jet. The twin ring structure of the Cosmic Owl requires further numerical simulations to clarify the precise conditions that lead to the formation of this rare morphology. This system exemplifies how shock-induced star formation, driven by galaxy collision or AGN jet, can act as a previously underappreciated yet crucial mechanism for efficient gas-to-star conversion and rapid stellar mass assembly in the early Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 The 21cm signal from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) is observed as a three-dimensional data set known as a lightcone, consisting of a redshift (frequency) axis and two spatial sky plane axes. When observed by radio interferometers, this EoR signal is strongly obscured by foregrounds that are several orders of magnitude stronger. Due to its inherently non-Gaussian nature, the EoR signal requires robust statistical tools to accurately separate it from these foreground contaminants, but current foreground separation techniques focus primarily on recovering the EoR power spectrum, often neglecting valuable non-Gaussian information. Recent developments in astrophysics, particularly in the context of the Galactic interstellar medium, have demonstrated the efficacy of scattering transforms - novel summary statistics for highly non-Gaussian processes - for component separation tasks. Motivated by these advances, we extend the scattering transform formalism from two-dimensional data sets to three-dimensional EoR lightcones. To this end, we introduce a 3D wavelet set from the tensor product of 2D isotropic wavelets in the sky plane domain and 1D wavelets in the redshift domain. As generative models form the basis of component separation, our focus here is on building and validating generative models that can be used for component separation in future projects. To achieve this, we construct maximum entropy generative models to synthesise EoR lightcones, and statistically validate the generative model by quantitatively comparing the synthesised EoR lightcones with the single target lightcone used to construct them, using independent statistics such as the power spectrum and Minkowski Functionals. The synthesised lightcones agree well with the target lightcone both statistically and visually, opening up the possibility of developing for component separation methods using 3D scattering transforms.
#### Time-scales of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon and dust continuum emission from gas clouds compared to molecular gas cloud lifetimes in PHANGS-JWST galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 Recent JWST mid-infrared (mid-IR) images, tracing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and dust continuum emission, provide detailed views of the interstellar medium (ISM) in nearby galaxies. Leveraging PHANGS-JWST Cycle 1 and PHANGS-MUSE data, we measure the PAH and dust continuum emission lifetimes of gas clouds across 17 nearby star-forming galaxies by analyzing the relative spatial distributions of mid-IR (7.7-11.3$\mu$m) and H$\alpha$ emission at various scales. We find that the mid-IR emitting time-scale of gas clouds in galaxy disks (excluding centers) ranges from 10 to 30Myr. After star formation is detected in H$\alpha$, mid-IR emission persists for 3-7Myr during the stellar feedback phase, covering 70-80% of the H$\alpha$ emission. This significant overlap is due to intense radiation from star-forming regions, illuminating the surrounding PAHs and dust grains. In most galaxies, the mid-IR time-scale closely matches the molecular cloud lifetime measured with CO. Although mid-IR emission is complex as influenced by ISM distribution, radiation, and abundances of dust and PAHs, the similarity between the two time-scales suggests that once gas clouds form with compact mid-IR emission, they quickly provide sufficient shielding for stable CO formation. This is likely due to our focus on molecular gas-rich regions of galaxies with near-solar metallicity. Finally, we find that the mid-IR emitting time-scale is longer in galaxies with well-defined HII regions and less structured backgrounds, allowing photons to more efficiently heat the ambient ISM surrounding the HII regions, rather than contributing to diffuse emission. This suggests that the shape of the ISM also influences mid-IR emission.

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a new method to determine the dark matter density profile in the vicinity of distant supermassive black holes (SMBH) using reverberation mapping measurements of active galactic nuclei (AGN). For some AGN, the mapping of multiple emission lines allows us to measure the enclosed mass within different radii from the central SMBH, which allows us to infer or constrain the dark matter density profile on sub-pc scales. We find that for five out of fourteen AGN in our identified sample, the observed enclosed mass grows with radii, hinting evidence for the presence of a dark matter component at the 1-2 $\sigma$ level. For these sources, we find global evidence for a universal dark matter profile with a preferred radial steepness of index $\gamma \sim 1.6$, consistent with the scenario expected for a dark matter spike mildly relaxed by stellar heating processes. For the remaining AGN in our sample, we are able to derive upper limits on the dark matter density profile parameters. Interestingly, the strongest evidence for a dark matter component arises from the farthest object considered, 3C 390. This new method allows us to measure or constrain for the first time the dark matter density in the vicinity of extragalactic SMBHs, which is crucial to our understanding of the dynamics and nature of dark matter.
#### Precipitation plausible: magnetized thermal instability in the intracluster medium

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of galaxy-cluster cores reveal that AGN feedback is strongly associated with both a short central cooling time ($t_{\rm c} \lesssim 10^9 \, {\rm yr}$) and accumulations of cold gas ($\lesssim 10^4 \, {\rm K}$). Also, the central ratio of cooling time to freefall time is rarely observed to drop below $t_{\rm c}/t_{\rm ff} \approx 10$, and large accumulations of cold gas are rarely observed in environments with $t_{\rm c} / t_{\rm ff} \gtrsim 30$. Here we show that the critical range -- $10 \lesssim t_{\rm c}/t_{\rm ff} \lesssim 30$ -- plausibly results from magnetized thermal instability. We present numerical simulations of magnetized stratified atmospheres with an initially uniform magnetic field. Thermal instability in an otherwise static atmosphere with $t_{\rm c}/t_{\rm ff} \approx 10$ progresses to nonlinear amplitudes, causing cooler gas to accumulate, as long as the background ratio of thermal pressure to magnetic pressure is $\beta \lesssim 100$. And in atmospheres with $t_{\rm c}/t_{\rm ff} \approx 20$, cooler gas accumulates for $\beta \lesssim 10$. Magnetized atmospheres are therefore much more likely to precipitate than unmagnetized atmospheres with otherwise identical properties. We hypothesize that AGN feedback triggered by accumulations of cold gas prevents $t_{\rm c}/t_{\rm ff}$ from dropping much below 10, because cold gas inevitably precipitates out of magnetized galactic atmospheres with lower ratios, causing $t_{\rm c}/t_{\rm ff}$ to rise.

 - **Abstract**
 This study presents a detailed chemical, kinematic, and orbital dynamic analysis of five metal poor stars in the solar neighborhood: HD 2665, HD 5916, HD 122956, HD 189349, and HD 218857. Using high-resolution spectroscopic data from the ELODIE and ESPaDOnS instruments, we derived elemental abundances for 29 species (25 elements: C, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, Ce, Nd, and Sm) via LTE based analysis with ATLAS9 model atmospheres. Notably, we report first time detections of Ce and Nd in HD2665; Al, V, Sm, and Mn in HD5916; Al in HD 122956; and C, O, S, Sc, Mn, Co, Cu, Zn, Sr, Zr, Nd, and Sm in HD 189349. Dynamical and chemical diagnostics reveal distinct origins: HD 2665 shows strong orbital and chemical similarity to GC NGC 5139 ($\omega$ Cen), while HD 218857 exhibits chemodynamic signatures consistent with NGC 5634. HD 122956 aligns with NGC 6864 (M75), though intriguingly shares age, metallicity ([Fe/H]), and [Mg/Fe] ratios with NGC 6517, a cluster whose reported abundances are derived solely from one star with APOGEE $H$-band spectroscopic measurements, as no optical spectroscopic data exist for its members. In contrast, HD 5916 and HD 189349 exhibit kinematic and chemical properties consistent with the field-star population and are classified as thick disk members.

 - **Abstract**
 Open clusters offer crucial insights into stellar nucleosynthesis and the chemical evolution of the Galactic disc, as their ages and distances can be determined with higher accuracy compared to field stars. In this study, we investigate the outermost regions of the Milky Way disc using two previously unstudied open clusters -Auner 1 and Berkeley 102- located at Galactocentric distances of approximately 14 kpc in largely uncharted areas of the Galaxy. We obtained medium-resolution spectra (R > 18,700) using the MEGARA integral-field unit (IFU) spectrograph on the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC), targeting red giant member stars in both clusters. From these spectra, we derived radial velocities, stellar atmospheric parameters, and chemical abundances for six elements: Fe, Ca, Co, Ni, Ba, and Eu. Additionally, we provide updated estimates of the clusters' ages and distances. Both clusters are old (3.2 +- 0.7 Ga), distant (d ~ 8 kpc), and lie below the Galactic plane (Z Gal ~ -0.7 kpc), with moderate extinction (AV ~ 1.3 mag). We find that Auner 1 has a metallicity of [Fe/H] = -0.30 +- 0.09 and Berkeley 102 of [Fe/H] = -0.35 +- 0.06, consistent with other clusters at similar Galactocentric radii and indicating minimal azimuthal variation in metallicity. The [X/Fe] abundance ratios align with expected trends, although [Ca/Fe] is slightly higher in both clusters, and [Eu/Fe] is notably enhanced in Berkeley 102 ([Eu/Fe] = 0.64 +- 0.05). Our findings highlight the effectiveness of GTC/MEGARA in IFU mode for Galactic archaeology and emphasize the need for further medium-to-high resolution spectroscopic studies of remote open clusters to refine models of the outer Galactic disc's chemical evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 How gas gets into, through, and out of galaxies is critical to understanding galactic ecosystems. The disk-CGM interface region is uniquely suited for studying processes that drive gas flows. Matter and energy that enter and leave a galaxy pass through this region; however, the precise pathways are yet to be explored. In this paper, we discuss future observations that will facilitate the discovery of the gas flow pathways in galaxies and the telescope parameters necessary for making those observations. We advocate for high spectral resolution ultraviolet spectroscopic capabilities on the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) that will enable observations in a wavelength range of 940 - 3500 A (minimum range: 970 - 3000 A) and at a resolution of 100,000 (minimum of 50,000). We advocate 19 for a multi-object spectrograph with thousands of sub-arcsec slitlets and a field of view 6' x 6'. We also recommend that the spectrograph be sensitive enough to achieve a signal-to-noise ratio of 10 or higher within a few hours for a continuum source of 21 AB magnitude and estimate an optimal aperture size of 8 meters. These capabilities would enable the characterization of gas in the disk-halo interface, leading to breakthroughs in our understanding of the gas flows and galactic ecosystems.

 - **Abstract**
 Several observational studies suggest that the local few hundred Mpc around the Local Group are significantly underdense based on source number counts in redshift space across much of the electromagnetic spectrum, particularly in near-infrared galaxy counts. This ``Keenan--Barger--Cowie (KBC) void'', ``Local Hole'', or ``local supervoid'', would have significant ramifications for the Hubble tension by generating outflows that masquerade as an enhanced local expansion rate. We evaluate models for the KBC void capable of resolving the Hubble tension with a background Planck cosmology. We fit these models to direct distances from the Tully--Fisher catalogue of the CosmicFlows-4 compilation using a field-level forward model. Depending on the adopted void density profile, we find the derived velocity fields to prefer a void size of less than 70 Mpc, which is less than 10 per cent of the fiducial size found by Haslbauer et al. based on the KBC luminosity density data. The predicted local Hubble constant is $72.1^{+0.9}_{-0.8}$, $70.4^{+0.4}_{-0.4}$, or $70.2^{+0.5}_{-0.4}$ km/s/Mpc for an initial underdensity profile that is exponential, Gaussian, or Maxwell-Boltzmann, respectively. The latter two ameliorate the Hubble tension to within $3\sigma$ of the 4-anchor distance ladder approach of Breuval et al. giving $73.2 \pm 0.9$ km/s/Mpc. The exponential profile does achieve consistency with this measurement at just over $1\sigma$, but it is disfavoured by the Bayesian evidence. The preferred models produce bulk flow curves that disagree with recent estimates from CosmicFlows-4, despite the void models being flexible enough to match such estimates.
#### Origin of Radio Emission in Three Nearby Ultraluminous Infrared Galaxies with Signatures of Luminous Buried Active Galactic Nuclei

 - **Abstract**
 We report multifrequency Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations at 2.3 and 8.4GHz of three nearby ultraluminous infrared galaxies, identified via mid-infrared spectroscopic analyses as hosting deeply embedded active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Milliarcsecond-scale observations at both frequencies reveal compact continuum emission in IRAS F00188$-$0856 and IRAS F01298$-$0744, accounting for $\sim10$% of the flux density measured on arcsecond scales. The non-detection in IRAS F00091$-$0738 and the lower limit on the intrinsic 8.4 GHz brightness temperature of $10^{6.1}$ K in IRAS F01298$-$0744 yield no conclusive evidence of AGN-driven radio emission, whereas the measurement of $10^{7.8}$ K in IRAS F00188$-$0856 confirms an AGN origin. Thus, the mid-infrared AGN classification remains robust, with at least one object exhibiting compact radio emission indicative of AGN activity. We further investigate the high-frequency spectral steepening observed in all three galaxies. In each case, this steepening arises from spectral aging in diffuse kpc-scale emission, which is resolved out by the VLBA observations. One possible explanation for the steepening of the sample is merger-induced particle acceleration. IRAS F00188$-$0856 exhibits a peaked radio spectrum, characteristic of a young radio source, with the high-frequency steepening attributable to this AGN activity. Consequently, the spectral steepening at high frequencies arises from particles accelerated by merger dynamics or AGN activity.

 - **Abstract**
 Physical problems with a solution that can be expressed analytically are scarce; this holds even more true for problems set in a cosmological context. Such solutions are, however, invaluable tools for making comparisons between theory, numerical experimentation and observations. In this work we present what to our knowledge is the first set of non-trivial closed-form expressions describing the behaviour of a system governed by the equations of non-ideal Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), where the effects of Ohmic diffusion are considered, in a cosmologically expanding frame. We provide analytical solutions that describe the time evolution of linear perturbations to a homogeneous background in a radiation-dominated universe, yielding dissipative Alfvén waves. Although in our base framework solutions for any other cosmology of interest cannot be expressed in a closed form, they can still be obtained reliably through numerical integration of the coupled system of ordinary differential equations we provide. We compare our analytical solutions to numerical results obtained using our novel implementation of Smoothed Particle Magnetohydrodynamics (SPMHD) in the SWIFT astrophysical simulation code, to find good agreement between the two. We find the code to display good convergence behaviour, its predictions agreeing with theory to within 0.1% for a modest number of resolution elements and at a negligible computational cost. We aim this work as a companion and supplement to the cosmological ideal MHD wave tests recently presented in the literature, and suggest that it be adopted as part of standard testing of code implementations of MHD.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the ALMA Survey of Gas Evolution of PROtoplanetary Disks (AGE-PRO), a Large Program of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). AGE-PRO aims to systematically trace the evolution of gas disk mass and size throughout the lifetime of protoplanetary disks. It uses a carefully selected sample of 30 disks around M3-K6 stars in three nearby star-forming regions: Ophiuchus (0.5-1 Myr), Lupus (1-3 Myr), and Upper Sco (2-6 Myr). Assuming the three regions had similar initial conditions and evolutionary paths, we find the median gas disk mass appears to decrease with age. Ophiuchus disks have the highest median gas mass (6 M$_{\rm Jup}$), while the Lupus and Upper Sco disks have significantly lower median masses (0.68 and 0.44 M$_{\rm Jup}$, respectively). Notably, the gas and dust disk masses appear to evolve on different timescales. This is evidenced by the median gas-to-dust mass ratio, which decreases from 122 in the youngest disks ($<$1 Myr) to 46 in Lupus disks, and then increases to 120 in the Upper Sco disks. The median gas disk sizes range between 74-110 au, suggesting that typical gas disks are much smaller than those of well-studied, massive disks. Population synthesis models suggest that magneto-hydrodynamic wind-driven accretion can reproduce median disk properties across all three regions, when assuming compact disks with a declining magnetic field over time. In contrast, turbulent-driven models overestimate gas masses of $>$1 Myr disks by an order of magnitude. Here we discuss the program's motivation, survey design, sample selection, observation and data calibration processes, and highlight the initial results.

 - **Abstract**
 The ALMA survey of Gas Evolution in PROtoplanetary disks (AGE-PRO) Large Program aims to trace the evolution of gas disk mass and size throughout the lifetime of protoplanetary disks. This paper presents Band-6 ALMA observations of 10 embedded (Class I and Flat Spectrum) sources in the Ophiuchus molecular cloud, with spectral types ranging from M3 to K6 stars, which serve as the evolutionary starting point in the AGE-PRO sample. While we find 4 nearly edge on disks (>70 deg.), and 3 highly inclined disks (>60 deg.) in our sample, we show that, as a population, embedded disks in Ophiuchus are not significantly contaminated by more evolved, but highly inclined sources. We derived dust disk masses from the Band 6 continuum and estimated gas disk masses from the C18O and C17O lines. The mass estimates from the C17O line are slightly higher, suggesting C18O emission might be partially optically thick. While the 12CO and 13CO lines are severely contaminated by extended emission and self-absorption, the C18O and C17O lines allowed us to trace the radial extent of the gaseous disks. From these measurements, we found that the C18O and C17O fluxes correlate well with each other and with the continuum fluxes. Furthermore, the C18O and C17O lines present a larger radial extension than disk dust sizes by factors ranging from 1.5 to 2.5, as it is found for Class II disks using the radial extension of the 12CO. In addition, we have detected outflows in three disks from 12CO observations.

 - **Abstract**
 The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) large program AGE-PRO explores protoplanetary disk evolution by studying gas and dust across various ages. This work focuses on ten evolved disks in Upper Scorpius, observed in dust continuum emission, CO and its isotopologues, and N$_2$H$^+$ with ALMA Bands 6 and 7. Disk radii, from the radial location enclosing 68% of the flux, are comparable to those in the younger Lupus region for both gas and dust tracers. However, solid masses are about an order of magnitude below those in Lupus and Ophiuchus, while the dust spectral index suggests some level of dust evolution. These empirical findings align with a combination of radial drift, dust trapping, and grain growth into larger bodies. A moderate correlation between CO and continuum fluxes suggests a link between gas and dust content, through the increased scatter compared to younger regions, possibly due to age variations, gas-to-dust ratio differences, or CO depletion. Additionally, the correlation between C$^{18}$O and N$_2$H$^+$ fluxes observed in Lupus persists in Upper Sco, indicating a relatively stable CO gas abundance over the Class II stage of disk evolution. In conclusion, the AGE-PRO survey of Upper Scorpius disks reveals intriguing trends in disk evolution. The findings point towards potential gas evolution and the presence of dust traps in these older disks. Future high-resolution observations are needed to confirm these possibilities and further refine our understanding of disk evolution and planet formation in older environments.

 - **Abstract**
 The architecture of planetary systems depends on the evolution of the disks in which they form. In this work, we develop a population synthesis approach to interpret the AGE-PRO measurements of disk gas mass and size considering two scenarios: turbulence-driven evolution with photoevaporative winds and MHD disk-wind-driven evolution. A systematic method is proposed to constrain the distribution of disk parameters from the disk fractions, accretion rates, disk gas masses, and CO gas sizes. We find that turbulence-driven accretion with initially compact disks ($R_0 \simeq 5-20~$au), low mass-loss rates, and relatively long viscous timescales ($t_{\nu,0} \simeq 0.4-3~$Myr or $\alpha_{SS} \simeq 2-4 \times 10^{-4}$) can reproduce the disk fraction and gas sizes. However, the distribution of apparent disk lifetime defined as the $M_D/\dot{M}_*$ ratio is severely overestimated by turbulence-driven models. On the other hand, MHD wind-driven accretion can reproduce the bulk properties of the disk populations from Ophiuchus to Upper Sco assuming compact disks with an initial magnetization of about $\beta \simeq 10^5$ ($\alpha_{DW} \simeq 0.5-1 \times 10^{-3}$) and a magnetic field that declines with time. More studies are needed to confirm the low masses found by AGE-PRO, notably for compact disks that question turbulence-driven accretion. The constrained synthetic disk populations can now be used for realistic planet population models to interpret the properties of planetary systems on a statistical basis.

 One important key in understanding a galaxy's evolution is to study the consequences of its past dynamical interactions that influenced its shape. By measuring the metallicity distribution of stellar populations with different ages, one can learn about these interactions. The Magellanic Clouds, being the nearest pair of interacting dwarf galaxies with a morphology characterised by different tidal and kinematic sub-structures as well as a vast range of stellar populations, represent an excellent place to study the consequences of dwarf-dwarf galaxy interactions and with their large host, the Milky Way. We aim to determine the metallicities ([Fe/H]) of red giant branch (old) and supergiant (young) stars covering the entire galaxies, estimate their radial metallicity gradients and produce homogeneous metallicity maps. We use the XP spectra from Gaia Data Release 3 to calculate synthetic Strömgren magnitudes from the application of the GaiaXPy tool and adopt calibration relations from the literature to estimate the metallicities. We present photometric metallicity maps for ~90,000 young stars and ~270,000 old stars within ~11 deg of the Small Magellanic Cloud and ~20 deg of the Large Magellanic Cloud from a homogeneous dataset. We find that the overall radial metallicity gradients decrease linearly in agreement with previous studies. We apply piecewise-regression fitting to derive the gradients within different radial regions. The overall metallicity gradients, traced by young and old stars, decrease from the centre to the outskirts of both galaxies. However, they show multiple breakpoints depicting regions following different and sometime opposite trends. These are associated to the structure of the galaxies, their history of star formation and chemical evolution but may be influenced by a low number of sources, especially at the centre (due to crowding) and in the outermost regions.

 - **Abstract**
 Variability of millimetre wavelength continuum emission from Class II protoplanetary disks is extremely rare, and when detected it is usually interpreted as originating from non-thermal emission mechanisms that relate to the host star itself rather than its disk. During observations made as part of the AGE-PRO ALMA Large program, significant variability in the brightness of the 2MASS J16202863-2442087 system was detected between individual executions. We report the observed properties of the variability detected at millimetre wavelengths and investigate potential driving mechanisms. To investigate the nature of the variability we construct a light curve from the continuum observations and analyse imaged constructed from both flaring and quiescent emission. We characterise the dust disk around the star through analysis in the image and visibility plane, and carry out kinematic analysis of the CO(2-1) emission from the gas disk. The continuum flux decays by a factor of 8 in less than an hour, and by a factor of 13 within 8 days. The peak brightness coincides with an expected brightness maximum extrapolated from the periodicity of previously observed optical variability. The flare is most likely the product of synchrotron emission in the close vicinity of the star. The nature of the millimetre flare closely resembles those detected in very close binary systems, and may be due to the interaction of magnetic fields in an as yet undetected binary. Alternatively if the central host is a single-star object, the flare may be due to the interaction of magnetic field loops at the stellar surface or a strong accretion burst.

 Cold gaseous systems play important roles in galaxy evolution by possibly providing fuel to ignite active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity and star-formation. In this work, we analyze [CII]$158\rm \mu m$ and continuum observations from ALMA for a sample of four radio AGN at $z \approx 3.5$, focusing on eight associated companion cloud systems discovered within projected distances of tens of kiloparsecs or less. The spatial distribution of these companions indicates that the majority of cold gas is not located at the AGN position, i.e., not in their host galaxies. With the assistance of [CII] at 0.2" resolution, we further confirm the gas-poor nature of the hosts by re-analyzing archival [CI] (a tracer of H$_{2}$) at $\sim2"$ resolution. Our sample has [CII] luminosities in a range of $2.8\times10^{8}<L_{\rm [CII]}/L_{\odot}<4.2\times10^{9}$. The $L_{\rm [CII]}/L_{\rm IR}$ ratio, $\sim 9.4\times10^{-4}$, is consistent with sources discussed in the literature. Our findings show the gas-poor radio AGN hosts have nearby gas-rich companions. We propose that these companions, which may be stripped clouds in merger process and by interaction with the energy output from the AGN, could also be a trigger of radio-loud AGN. They may also be a signature of negative AGN feedback (e.g., shock heating) on these infalling companions and on the host galaxy. In general, our analysis shows that powerful AGN at and before Cosmic Noon are impacting and being impacted by cold gaseous clouds in their circum-galactic or proto-intracluster media.
