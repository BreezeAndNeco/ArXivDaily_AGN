 - **Abstract**
 Observations of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at high redshifts challenge standard seeding scenarios. We examine a dissipative self-interacting dark matter (dSIDM) model in which gravothermal collapse leads to the formation of massive BH seeds ab initio. We utilize a semi-analytical framework to predict properties of the dSIDM-seeded SMBH population. Billion solar mass quasars are reproduced along with low-mass faint active galactic nuclei (known as little red dots) with SMBH-to-galaxy stellar mass ratios consistent with recent James Webb Space Telescope observations. To match the abundance of the observed bright quasars, a percent-level duty-cycle is suggested, implying a large population of dormant SMBHs. The gravitational wave (GW) signals from mergers of these massive SMBHs can be detected by LISA while remaining within the NANOGrav constraints on the GW background. These results provide testable signatures of DM-driven SMBH formation, offering a pathway to probe hidden-sector physics through SMBH and GW observables.

 - **Abstract**
 The dense cores of globular clusters (GCs) are efficient environments for the production of exotic stellar populations, including millisecond pulsars (MSPs), low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) and cataclysmic variables (CVs). Most of these objects likely form through two- and three-body interactions and are useful tracers of the cluster's dynamical evolution. In this work we explore the exotic object population in the galactic GC NGC 362, searching for the optical counterpart of 33 X-ray sources identified within 1 arcmin from the cluster center. To this aim, we exploit a large Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data-set, obtained in eight different epochs and covering a wavelength range from near UV to the optical I band. To identify the most promising counterparts we follow a multi-step analysis, which is based on four main ingredients, namely positional coincidence, position in the colour-magnitude-diagrams (CMDs), H$\alpha$ excess and photometric variability. In addition, we complement the photometric analysis with spectroscopic information coming from the analysis of MUSE radial velocity (RV) curves. Thanks to this multi-diagnostic approach, we are able to identify 28 high-confidence optical counterparts, including several candidate MSPs, active binaries (ABs) and CVs. The most intriguing counterparts include a candidate black widow (BW) system, an eclipsing binary blue straggler, and a system in outburst, potentially representing either a LMXB or a nova eruption from a CV. The candidate MSPs proposed in this work will contribute to ongoing radio analyses with MeerKAT for the identification and detailed study of MSPs in NGC 362.

 - **Abstract**
 [abridged] AGN feedback is a crucial ingredient for understanding galaxy evolution. However, a complete quantitative time-dependent framework, including the dependence of such feedback on AGN, host galaxy, and host halo properties, is yet to be developed. Using the complete sample of 682 radio AGN from the LOFAR-eFEDS survey ($z<0.4$), we derive the average jet power of massive galaxies and its variation as a function of stellar mass ($M_*$), halo mass ($M_h$) and radio morphology. We compare the incidence distributions of compact and complex radio AGN as a function of specific black hole kinetic power, $\lambda_{\rm Jet}$, and synthesise, for the first time, the radio luminosity function (RLF) by $M_*$ and radio morphology. Our RLF and derived total radio AGN kinetic luminosity density, $\log \Omega_{\rm kin}/[\rm {W~Mpc^{-3}}]=32.15_{-0.34}^{+0.18}$, align with previous work. We find that kinetic feedback from radio AGN dominates over any plausible inventory of radiatively-driven feedback for galaxies with $\log M_*/M_\odot > 10.6$. More specifically, it is the compact radio AGN which dominate this global kinetic energy budget for all but the most massive galaxies ($10.6 < \log M_*/M_{\odot} < 11.5$). Subsequently, we compare the average injected jet energy against the galaxy and halo binding energy, and against the total thermal energy of the host gas within halos. We find that radio AGN cannot fully unbind their host galaxies nor host halos. However, they have enough energy to impact the global thermodynamical heating and cooling balance in small halos and significantly contribute to offsetting local cooling flows in even the most massive clusters cores. Overall, our findings provide important insights on jet powering, accretion processes and black hole-galaxy coevolution via AGN feedback, as well as a clear observational benchmark to calibrate AGN feedback simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 The interstellar medium within $\rm\approx 15 \; pc$ of the Sun consists of a complex of fifteen diffuse, partially ionized clouds. Located within the Local Bubble, these clouds, known as the Cluster of Local Interstellar Clouds (CLIC), constitute the interstellar environment impinging upon our heliosphere. While each individual cloud can be modeled with a distinct velocity vector, the complex demonstrates a coherent bulk motion suggestive of a common origin. Here we examine two theories for the origin of the CLIC: that it formed due to an ionization front associated with nearby Strömgren spheres and/or due to a nearby supernova explosion that occurred within the pre-evacuated cavity of the Local Bubble. Tracing back the trajectory of the clouds, we disfavor a purely Strömgren sphere origin, given the CLIC's position interior to the surface of the most significant nearby Stromgren sphere and its motion transverse to the sphere's trajectory. Turning to a supernova origin, we model the formation of the CLIC assuming individual clouds have been swept up over time due to the expansion of a supernova remnant in its pressure-driven snowplow phase. We find that the 3D spatial-dynamical properties of the CLIC can be explained by the most recent supernova that exploded in the nearby Upper Centaurus Lupus cluster $\approx \rm 1.2 \; Myr$ ago and propagated into an ambient density of $n \approx 0.04 \;\rm cm^{-3}$. Our model predicts that the formation of the individual CLIC clouds occurred progressively over the past $1 \; \rm Myr$ and offers a natural explanation for the observed distribution, column density, temperature, and magnetic field structure of the complex.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy interaction and merging have clear effects on the systems involved. We find an increase in the star formation rate (SFR), potential ignition of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and significant morphology changes. However, at what stage during interactions or mergers these changes begin to occur remains an open question. With a combination of machine learning and visual classification, we select a sample of 3,162 interacting and merging galaxies in the Cosmic Evolutionary Survey (COSMOS) field across a redshift range of 0.0 - 1.2. We divide this sample into four distinct stages of interaction based on their morphology, each stage representing a different phase of the dynamical timescale. We use the rich ancillary data available in COSMOS to probe the relation between interaction stage, stellar mass, SFR, and AGN fraction. We find that the distribution of SFRs rapidly change with stage for mass distributions consistent with being drawn from the same parent sample. This is driven by a decrease in the fraction of red sequence galaxies (from 17% as close pairs to 1.4% during merging) and an increase in the fraction of starburst galaxies (from 7% to 32%). We find the AGN fraction increases by a factor of 1.2 only at coalescence. We find the effects of interaction peak at the point of closest approach and coalescence of the two systems. We show that the point in time of the underlying dynamical timescale - and its related morphology - is as important to consider as its projected separation.
#### Time-Dependent AGN Disc Winds II -- Effects of Photoionization

 - **Abstract**
 We use a combination of radiation hydrodynamics (rad-HD) and photoionization modeling to study line-driven disc winds for a range of black hole masses. We refined previous models by incorporating heating, cooling, and radiation forces from spectral lines calculated using a photoionization code, assuming that composite AGN spectra irradiate the gas. For black holes with masses $3 \times 10^{6} \lesssim {\rm M_{BH}/M_{\odot}} \lesssim 10^{8}$, the mass loss rate, ${\rm \dot{M}_w}$ increases proportionally with the disk Eddington fraction, $\Gamma$. The insensitivity of ${\rm \dot{M}_w}$ to the hardness of the spectral energy distribution (SED) arises because the central region is dominated by radiation in the frequency range with ample spectral lines for the range of $M_{BH}$ considered here. Disc winds are suppressed or fail outside the above mass range because of a dearth of line-driving photons. We find \emph{stronger} winds, both in terms of ${\rm \dot{M}_w}$ and wind velocity compared to previous disc wind models. Our winds are stronger because of an enhanced line force from including many spectral lines in the X-ray band. These lines were unavailable and, hence, unaccounted for in previous photoionization studies and their subsequent application to AGN wind models. For $\Gamma \gtrsim 0.4$, ${\rm \dot{M}_w}$ is higher than the assumed disc accretion rate, implying that the wind feeds back strongly. Our findings indicate the necessity of utilizing comprehensive and current atomic data along with a more thorough approach to radiation transfer - both spatially and temporally - to accurately calculate the line force.
#### Direction-Dependent Faraday Synthesis

 - **Abstract**
 Modern radio interferometers enable high-resolution polarization imaging, offering insights into cosmic magnetism through Rotation Measure (RM) synthesis. Traditional 2+1D RM synthesis treats the 2D spatial and 1D spectral transforms separately. A fully 3D approach transforms data directly from visibility-frequency space to sky-Faraday depth space using a 3D Fourier transform. Faraday synthesis uses the full dataset for improved reconstruction but requires a 3D deconvolution algorithm to subtract artifacts from the residual image. Applying this method to modern interferometers also requires corrections for direction-dependent effects (DDEs). We extend Faraday synthesis by incorporating DDE corrections, enabling accurate polarized imaging in the presence of instrumental and ionospheric effects. We implement this method within DDFACET, introducing a direction-dependent deconvolution algorithm (DDFSCLEAN) that applies DDE corrections in a faceted framework. Additionally, we parameterize the CLEAN components and evaluate the model over a larger set of frequency channels, naturally correcting for bandwidth depolarization. The method is tested on both synthetic and real data. Our results show that Faraday synthesis enables deeper deconvolution, reduces artifacts, and increases dynamic range. The depolarization correction improves recovery of polarized flux, allowing coarser frequency resolution without loss of sensitivity at high Faraday depths. From the 3D reconstruction, we identify a polarized source in a LOFAR Surveys pointing not detected by earlier RM surveys. Faraday synthesis is memory-intensive due to the large transforms between the visibility domain and the Faraday cube, and is only now becoming practical. Nevertheless, our implementation achieves comparable or faster runtimes than the 2+1D approach, making it a competitive alternative for polarization imaging.
#### Evidence for evolutionary pathway-dependent black hole scaling relations

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations have identified an abundance of high-redshift active galactic nuclei (AGN) with supermassive black holes (BHs) that are over-massive compared to the local BH mass$-$total stellar mass ($M_{\mathrm{BH}}-M_\star$) relation. $M_{\mathrm{BH}}$ measurements at high-$z$ are critical for probing the growth histories of BHs and their host galaxies, including BH seeding and evolution of the $M_{\mathrm{BH}}-M_\star$ relation. However, BH masses in high-$z$ AGN are generally estimated from single-epoch measurements, which are anchored to local relations based on reverberation mapping and carry large systematic uncertainties. Alternate $M_{\mathrm{BH}}$ detection methods such as dynamical measurements are more reliable but currently only possible in the local Universe or with strongly lensed systems. Recently, dynamical $M_{\mathrm{BH}}$ measurements were made in a $z\sim2$ lensed quiescent galaxy as well as a sample of six local galaxies identified as likely relics of common quiescent red nugget galaxies at cosmic noon. We compare the $z\sim2$ red nugget and relic BHs to recent results for $4<z<11$ AGN, quasars, and Little Red Dots. Intriguingly, the $z\sim2$ galaxy and local relic galaxies all lie on both the local $M_{\mathrm{BH}}-M_\star$ relation for bulges and the $4<z<7$ $M_{\mathrm{BH}}-M_\star$ relation. Our results suggest the $M_{\mathrm{BH}}-M_\star$ relation for bulges was likely in place at high-$z$ and indicate careful consideration of different evolutionary pathways is needed when building BH scaling relations. While improvements to $M_{\mathrm{BH}}$ estimates in AGN will increase our confidence in high-$z$ BH masses, detecting BHs in relic galaxies and lensed galaxies presents a complementary probe of the high-$z$ relations.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar Magnetism affects all spectral types and exists and varies throughout the evolution of stars. Magnetic fields can affect not only the interior of stars, but also their circumstellar environments. In this chapter, we concentrate on the magnetic fields that can be measured at the surface of stars through the influence of the Zeeman effect on their spectra. We provide a brief introduction to the Zeeman effect and its associated light polarization. We discuss the state-of-the-art spectropolarimetric techniques that are used to detect, measure, and characterize surface stellar magnetic fields. We then present one of the most outstanding problem in stellar physics, mainly the origins of magnetic fields in massive OBA stars. We describe our current knowledge of the properties of known magnetic massive stars, such as their incidence, field distribution, topology, etc., and offer an outlook on the impact of stellar evolution on stellar magnetism.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an updated repository of sub-mJy extragalactic radio source counts between $150$ MHz and $10$ GHz, incorporating recent advances in radio surveys and observational techniques. By compiling and refining previous datasets, we provide a comprehensive catalog that enhances the understanding of faint radio-source populations, including Dusty Star-Forming Galaxies (DSFGs) and Radio-Quiet Active Galactic Nuclei (RQAGNs), from intermediate to high redshifts. Our analysis accounts for observational biases, such as resolution effects and Eddington bias, ensuring improved accuracy in flux-density estimations. We also discuss the implications of new-generation radio telescopes, such as the Square-Kilometer Array Observatory (SKAO) and its precursors and pathfinders, to further resolve these populations. Our collection contributes to constraining evolutionary models of radio sources, highlighting the increasing role of polarization studies in distinguishing different classes. This work serves as a key reference for future deep radio surveys targeting the faintest end of the extragalactic radio sky.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an imaging algorithm for polarimetric interferometric data from radio telescopes. It is based on Bayesian statistics and thereby able to provide uncertainties and to incorporate prior information such as positivity of the total emission (Stokes I) or consistency constraints (polarized fraction can only be between 0% and 100%). By comparing our results to the output of the de-facto standard algorithm called CLEAN, we show that these constraints paired with a consistent treatment of measurement uncertainties throughout the algorithm significantly improve image quality. In particular, our method reveals that depolarization canals in CLEAN images do not necessarily indicate a true absence of polarized emission, e.g., after frequency averaging, but can also stem from uncertainty in the polarization direction. This demonstrates that our Bayesian approach can distinguish between true depolarization and mere uncertainty, providing a more informative representation of polarization structures.

 - **Abstract**
 The Astro2020 Decadal Survey declared that the baryon cycle is one of the top-priority science topics for current astrophysics. Space instruments with both high spectral resolution and high throughput in the ultraviolet are required for investigations of low density warm and cold gas present in both the \underline{inner} regions of the baryon cycle (interstellar medium, star-exoplanet interactions, pre-main sequence stars, stellar winds, flows and structures driven by supernovae) and the \underline{outer} regions (outflows of matter and energy from galaxies, circumgalactic media). The Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph on HST has pioneered such studies, but STIS has its limitations and the lifetime of HST is limited. There is a pressing need for future large instruments with high spectral resolution ($R\approx 100,000$) in the 120--320~nm wavelength band such as the present STIS E140H and E230H capabilities, but with increased throughput to study gas in sight lines to faint sources such as M dwarf stars and circumgalactic clouds. Multi-object spectroscopy at high spectral resolution could enhance observational efficiency. This document describes some of the scientific results obtained with STIS and the new science that an enhanced instrument on a large telescope such as HWO could accomplish. We provide examples of the resolution needed for these science investigations.
#### Polarization Position Angle Swing and the Rotating Vector Model of Repeating Fast Radio Bursts

 - **Abstract**
 Fast radio bursts (FRBs), typically highly polarized, usually have a nearly constant polarization position angle (PA) during each burst. Some bursts show significant PA variations, and one of them was claimed to have a PA variation pattern consistent with the prediction of the rotating vector model (RVM) commonly adopted to fit the PA variations in radio pulsars. We systematically study the PA evolution pattern of 1727 bursts from three active repeating FRB sources monitored by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST). We identify 46 bursts whose PA variations are fully consistent with the RVM. However, the inferred geometrical parameters and rotation periods derived from these RVM fitting are inconsistent from each other. This suggests that the magnetosphere of the FRB central engine is constantly distorted by the FRB emitter, and the magnetic configuration is dynamically evolving.
#### Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk) XXI: Limited role of streamers in mass supply to the disk in the Class 0 protostar IRAS 16544-1604

 - **Abstract**
 Asymmetric and narrow infalling structures, often called streamers, have been observed in several Class 0/I protostars, which is not expected in the classical star formation picture. Their origin and impact on the disk formation remain observationally unclear. By combining data from the James Cleark Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), we investigate the physical properties of the streamers and parental dense core in the Class 0 protostar, IRAS 16544$-$1604. Three prominent streamers associated to the disk with lengths between 2800 to 5800 au, are identified on the northern side of the protostar in the C$^{18}$O emission. Their mass and mass infalling rates are estimated to be in the range of (1-4)$\times$10$^{-3}$ $M_\odot$ and (1-5)$\times$10$^{-8}$ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, respectively. Infall signatures are also observed in the more diffuse extended protostellar envelope observed with the ALMA from the comparison to the infalling and rotating envelope model. The parental dense core detected by the JCMT observation has a mass of $\sim$0.5 $M_\odot$, sub to transonic turbulence of $\mathcal{M}$ $=$ 0.8-1.1, and a mass-to-flux ratio of 2-6. Our results show that the streamers in IRAS 16544-1604 only possess 2% of the entire dense core mass and contribute less than 10% of the mass infalling rate of the protostellar envelope. Therefore, the streamers in IRAS 16544-1604 play a minor role in the mass accretion process onto the disk, in contrast to those streamers observed in other sources and those formed in numerical simulations of collapsing dense cores with similar turbulence and magnetic field strengths.

 - **Abstract**
 As planetary nebulae (PNe) evolve, they develop slow and strong dust-driven stellar winds, making the joint study of dust and gas essential for understanding their nature. As a pilot investigation, we selected PN K 3-54 as our target, the only known PN in the Milky Way to exhibit infrared emission from both graphene (C$_{24}$) and fullerene (C$_{60}$). The gas is traced via molecular line emissions from $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, and C$^{18}$O ($J = 1 \rightarrow 0$), observed using the 13.7 m telescope of the Purple Mountain Observatory. We investigate the dynamics of this PN and identify a bipolar outflow. Preliminary results suggest that the large dynamical timescale of the outflow and the weak shock environment may account for the simultaneous survival of C$_{24}$ and C$_{60}$ within and around PN K 3-54.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the brightening behavior of long-period comets as a function of dynamical age, defined by the original reciprocal semimajor axis, $1/a_0$. Our goal is to test long-standing claims about comet behavior using a large number of available measurements. We use a large set of photometric observations to compute and analyze global and local brightening curves for 272 long-period comets. Observed magnitudes are fitted with a linear model in log heliocentric distance, from which we derive brightening parameters for each comet. We categorize the sample into dynamically new, intermediate, and old comets, comparing their brightening behavior. We also examine the relationships between dynamical age and other orbital and physical parameters. Dynamically new comets are seen to brighten more slowly than old comets, particularly within 3 au from the Sun. The brightening rate of new comets appears to vary with heliocentric distance. New comets are intrinsically brighter than old comets, and exhibit a tighter correlation between brightening parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations of the solar wind ions by the SPAN-I instruments on board the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) spacecraft at solar perihelia (Encounters) 4 and closer find ample evidence of complex anisotropic non-Maxwellian velocity distributions that consist of core, beam, and `hammerhead' (i.e., anisotropic beam) populations. The proton core populations are anisotropic, with T_perp/T||>1, and the beams have super-Alfvenic speed relative to the core (we provide an example from Encounter 17). The alpha-particle population show similar features as the protons. These unstable VDFs are associated with enhanced, right-hand (RH) and left-hand (LH) polarized ion-scale kinetic wave activity, detected by the FIELDS instrument. Motivated by PSP observations, we employ nonlinear hybrid models to investigate the evolution of the anisotropic hot-beam VDFs and model the growth and the nonlinear stage of ion kinetic instabilities in several linearly unstable cases. The models are initialized with ion VDFs motivated by the observational parameters. We find rapidly growing (in terms of proton gyroperiods) combined ion-cyclotron (IC) and magnetosonic (MS) instabilities, which produce LH and RH ion-scale wave spectra, respectively. The modeled ion VDFs in the nonlinear stage of the evolution are qualitatively in agreement with PSP observations of the anisotropic core and `hammerhead' velocity distributions, quantifying the effect of the ion kinetic instabilities on wind plasma heating close to the Sun. We conclude that the wave-particle interactions play an important role in the energy transfer between the magnetic energy (waves) and random particle motion leading to anisotropic solar wind plasma heating.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic fields are often invoked as playing a primary role in star formation and in the formation of high-mass stars. We investigate the effect of magnetic fields on the formation of high-mass cores using the 3-dimensional smoothed particle magnetohydrodynamics (SPMHD) code PHANTOM. We follow the collapse of six molecular clouds of mass 1000 M$_{\odot}$, four of which are initially magnetized with mass-to-flux ratios 3, 5, 10 and 100, respectively, and two purely hydrodynamic clouds with varying initial strengths of turbulence. We then apply an in-house clump-finding algorithm to the 3D SPH data in order to quantify the differences in mass and properties of the cores across the degrees of magnetic and turbulent support. We find that although the magnetic fields cause differences in the global cloud evolution, the masses and properties of the cores which form are broadly similar across the different initial conditions. Cores initially form with masses comparable to the initial thermal Jeans mass of the clouds, and then slowly increase in mass with time. We find that regardless of initial magnetization, the fields become dynamically relevant at densities of $\rho > 1\times10^{-17}$ g cm$^{-3}$ - comparable to core densities - and channel material along the field lines, decreasing the stable magnetic Jeans mass, such that the limiting factor for fragmentation is the thermal Jeans mass. We conclude that magnetic fields are not capable of forming and supporting initially high-mass cores against fragmentation.

 Magnetic reconnection is a key process that drives the energy release in solar flares. This process can occur at multiple locations along the coronal loop. The reconnection generates energetic electrons capable of exciting wave modes and emissions as they propagate through the loop. In this follow-up study, we investigate the influence of the injection site location of these energetic electrons - either at the looptop (LT) or at the leg of the loop around a footpoint (FP) - on the excitation of wave modes especially the second harmonic emissions (X2) in coronal loops. Our simulations reveal that the injection location significantly impacts the spatial distribution and intensity of excited wave modes. When electrons are injected at the LT, electromagnetic X2, and Z modes dominate along the loop, with minimal excitation of Langmuir waves (Yousefzadeh et al. 2021; 2022). Conversely, the present study reveals that injection close to FP leads to a strong Langmuir wave excitation throughout the loop, particularly as electrons ascend toward the LT. We find that X2 and Z modes are consistently excited at the injection site with different intensities, regardless of the injection location. However, electron injection near the FP scenario creates favorable conditions for significant Langmuir wave generation, potentially leading to plasma emission under specific circumstances. These findings emphasize the importance of electron injection location in determining the properties of the excited and emitted waves in solar coronal loops.

 Solar flares are major space weather events that result from the explosive conversion of stored magnetic energy into bulk motion, plasma heating, and particle acceleration. While the standard flare model has proven highly successful in explaining key morphological features of flare observations, many aspects of the energy release are not yet understood. In particular, the turbulent three-dimensional structure of the flare current sheet is thought to play an important role in fast reconnection, particle acceleration, and bursty dynamics. Although direct diagnosis of the magnetic field dynamics in the corona remains highly challenging, rich information may be gleaned from flare ribbons, which represent the chromospheric imprints of reconnection in the corona. Intriguingly, recent solar imaging observations have revealed a diversity of fine structure in flare ribbons that hints at corresponding complexity in the reconnection region. We present high-resolution three-dimensional MHD simulations of an eruptive flare and describe our efforts to interpret fine-scale ribbon features in terms of the current sheet dynamics. In our model, the current sheet is characterized by many coherent magnetic structures known as plasmoids. We derive a model analogue for ribbons by generating a time series of field-line length maps (L-maps) and identifying abrupt shortenings as flare reconnection events. We thereby demonstrate that plasmoids imprint transient 'spirals' along the analogue of the ribbon front, with a morphology consistent with observed fine structure. We discuss the implications of these results for interpreting SolO, IRIS, and DKIST observations of explosive flare energy release.

 - **Abstract**
 High redshift Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are expected to be extremely powerful probes of our Universe. However, while a significant number of FRBs are expected to exist at high redshift, detecting them has been difficult, with only a handful robustly confirmed at redshifts greater than one. In many other fields, gravitational lensing from galaxy clusters has enabled high redshift detections by magnifying background sources. In this work we forecast the populations of FRBs expected to be detected by CHIME and upcoming instrument CHORD, for blank fields and by lensing through a range of strong lensing galaxy clusters, based on existing, observationally driven cluster models. We find that the presence of a galaxy cluster of mass $M\geq5\times10^{14} M_\odot$ within the detection beam of a transit telescope will approximately double the rate of detected high redshift ($z\geq1$ CHIME, $z\geq2$ CHORD) FRBs for that beam. Consequently, we find that knowledge of cluster positions can be used by instruments like CHIME or CHORD in tandem with novel observational strategies to isolate a sample of high redshift FRBs with $\gtrsim50\%$ purity at rate of $\lesssim3$ per year. This would provide a statistically high redshift sample of mostly gravitationally lensed FRBs, that would be ideal candidates for optical follow-up, constraining the FRB-star formation relation and for use in cosmological studies including measuring $H_0$, characterising dark matter substructures and probing reionization.

 - **Abstract**
 Cold neutral hydrogen (HI) is a crucial precursor for molecular gas formation and can be studied via HI absorption. This study investigates HI absorption in low column density regions of the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds (SMC and LMC) using the Galactic-ASKAP HI (GASKAP-HI) survey, conducted by the Australian Square Kilometer Array Pathfinder (ASKAP). We select 10 SMC directions in the outer regions and 18 LMC directions, with 4 in the outskirts and 14 within the main disk. Using the radiative transfer method, we decompose the emission and absorption spectra into individual cold neutral medium (CNM) and warm neutral medium (WNM) components. In the SMC, we find HI peak optical depths of 0.09-1.16, spin temperatures of ~20-50 K, and CNM fractions of 1-11%. In the LMC, optical depths range from 0.03 to 3.55, spin temperatures from ~10 to 100 K, and CNM fractions from 1% to 100%. The SMC's low CNM fractions likely result from its low metallicity and large line-of-sight depth. Additionally, the SMC's outskirts show lower CNM fractions than the main body, potentially due to increased CNM evaporation influenced by the hot Magellanic Corona. Shell motions dominate the kinematics of the majority of CNM clouds in this study and likely supply cold HI to the Magellanic Stream. In the LMC, high CNM fraction clouds are found near supergiant shells, where thermal instability induced by stellar feedback promotes WNM-to-CNM transition. Although no carbon monoxide (CO) has been detected, enhanced dust shielding in these areas helps maintain the cold HI.

 - **Abstract**
 We conduct an analysis of over 60,000 dwarf galaxies (7<=log(M_*/M_\odot)<=10) in search of photometric variability indicative of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Using data from the Young Supernova Experiment (YSE), a time domain survey on the Pan-STARRS telescopes, we construct light curves for each galaxy in up to four bands (griz) where available. We select objects with AGN-like variability by fitting each light curve to a damped random walk (DRW) model. After quality cuts and removing transient contaminants, we identify 1100 variability-selected AGN candidates (representing 2.4% of the available sample). We analyze their spectra to measure various emission lines and calculate black hole (BH) masses, finding general agreement with previously found mass scaling-relations and nine potential IMBH candidates. Furthermore, we re-analyze the light curves for our candidates to calculate the dampening timescale tau_DRW associated with the DRW and see a similar correlation between this value and the BH mass. Finally, we estimate the active fraction as a function of stellar mass and see evidence that active fraction increases with host mass.

 - **Abstract**
 Highly ionized X-ray wind signatures have been found in the soft states of high-inclination Black Hole Low Mass X-ray Binaries (BHLMXBs) for more than two decades. Yet signs of a systematic evolution of the outflow itself along the outburst remain elusive, due to the limited sampling of individual sources and the necessity to consider the broad-band evolution of the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED). We perform an holistic analysis of archival X-ray wind signatures in the most observed wind-emitting transient BHLMXB to date, 4U 1630-47 . The combination of Chandra, NICER, NuSTAR, Suzaku, and XMM-Newton, complemented in hard X-rays by Swift/BAT and INTEGRAL, spans more than 200 individual days over 9 individual outbursts, and provides a near complete broad-band coverage of the brighter portion of the outburst. Our results show that the hard X-rays allow to define "soft" states with ubiquitous wind detections, and their contribution is strongly correlated with the Equivalent Width (EW) of the lines. We then constrain the evolution of the outflow in a set of representative observations, using thermal stability curves and photoionization modeling. The former confirms that the switch to unstable SEDs occurs well after the wind signatures disappear, to the point where the last canonical hard states are thermally stable. The latter shows that intrinsic changes in the outflow are required to explain the main correlations of the line EWs, be it with luminosity or the hard X-rays. These behaviors are seen systematically over all outbursts and confirm individual links between the wind properties, the thermal disk, and the corona.
