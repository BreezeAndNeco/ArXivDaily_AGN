#### Are Helium Atmospheres Hiding as Volatile-rich in Current Exoplanet Analysis Frameworks?
 - **Authors:** Julien de Wit, Aaron Householder, Prajwal Niraula

Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

 - **Abstract**
 The increasing number of detailed exoplanet observations offers an opportunity to refine our analyses and interpretations, and uncover previously-hidden trends. One such trend is unexpectedly high water abundances ($\sim$1$-$10\%) for several hot Jupiters. Here, we show that such atmospheres may instead be helium-rich, and the perceived high water abundances simply biases in analyses compensating for ``ad hocly'' fixed helium-to-hydrogen ratio (He/H$_2$ = 0.157). As transmission spectra constrain the atmospheric scale height ($H$), a helium-enriched atmosphere can be misinterpreted as H$_2$-dominated water-rich to bring the mean molecular weight ($\mu$) to intermediate values ($\sim$4$-$15) when He/H$_2$ is fixed. We present a proof-of-concept reanalysis of HD~209458~b's JWST transmission spectrum treating He/H$_2$ as a free parameter, resulting in sets of solutions with helium enrichment and non-extreme water abundance. The He-enhancement found requires an order of magnitude less enrichment/evolution than does a water abundance of 10\%, suggesting that the He-rich hypothesis is a viable alternative. We argue that He enhancement must be considered to reliably constrain atmospheric composition, be sensitive to a more diverse planetary population, and ultimately yield robust metallicity trends to inform formation/evolution pathways. Looking ahead, we suggest leveraging insights from differences in pressure-broadening effects, outflow measurements, and atmospheric chemistry to help disentangle reliably between He- and volatile-rich atmospheres -- while recognizing that existing opacity/outflow/chemistry models may need targeted upgrades to reach the required fidelity level.

 - **Abstract**
 We present spatially-resolved rest-frame optical emission line maps of four galaxies at $z \sim 2$ observed with Keck/OSIRIS to study the physical conditions of the ISM at Cosmic Noon. Our analysis of strong emission line ratios in these galaxies reveals an offset from the local star-forming locus on the BPT diagram, but agrees with other star-forming galaxies at similar redshifts. Despite the offset towards higher [O III]$\lambda5008$/H$\beta$ and [N II]$\lambda6585$/H$\alpha$, these strong-line ratios remain consistent with or below the maximum starburst threshold even in the inner $\sim 1$ kpc region of the galaxies, providing no compelling evidence for central AGN activity. The galaxies also exhibit flat radial gas-phase metallicity gradients, consistent with previous studies of $z \sim 2$ galaxies and suggesting efficient radial mixing possibly driven by strong outflows from intense star formation. Overall, our results reveal the highly star-forming nature of these galaxies, with the potential to launch outflows that flatten metallicity gradients through significant radial gas mixing. Future observations with JWST/NIRSpec are crucial to detect fainter emission lines at higher spatial resolution to further constrain the physical processes and ionization mechanisms that shape the ISM during Cosmic Noon.
#### Ultrahigh Energy Cosmic Ray Production in Binary Neutron Star Mergers

 - **Abstract**
 We predict the spectrum and composition of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays (UCRs for short) generated in a binary neutron star merger, exploiting the highly constrained initial conditions to make quantitative predictions for the cutoff energy for various nuclei. The key mechanism producing UCRs heavier than helium is acceleration in the magnetized turbulent outflow outside the jets. We find the rigidity cutoff of this component is $\mathcal{R}_{\rm cut} \equiv E_{\rm cut}/eZ \approx 6-9$ EV, consistent with the measured value $\mathcal{R}_{\rm cut} = 6.8^{+5.8}_{-2.8}\,$EV from fitting data. This agreement strengthens the case that BNS mergers are the main site of UCR production. The jets may also be capable of accelerating particles to ultrahigh energy: these UCRs would be protons and/or helium, in a ratio that depends on the neutron star equation of state. We estimate the cutoff energies of such a component to be $E_{\rm cut}\approx\! 10\,$EeV for p and $\approx\! 30\,$EeV for He. Such a jet component may explain the hint of a secondary light population at higher energy found in the analysis of Muzio et al. (2019). With more precise data, the locus of production of helium and intermediate mass nuclei can be inferred from their rigidity structure, and the predicted small deviations from a pure Peters Cycle can be checked. Predicting the relative abundances of different elements and the total energy in UCRs per merger event is feasible, but beyond the scope of this paper. This scenario predicts that each neutrino above 1 PEV is co-directional with a gravitational wave arriving ~1 day earlier, and that the highest energy UCRs have masses heavier than iron.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational wave (GW) neutron star mergers with an associated electromagnetic counterpart constitute powerful probes of binary evolution, the production sites of heavy elements, general relativity, and the expansion of the universe. Only a handful of candidate GW binary mergers during the fourth LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA observing run (O4) so far are believed to include a neutron star. We present optical-near infrared follow-up observations of the candidate neutron-star black hole GW merger S250206dm. This is the first high-significance mass gap neutron star-black hole candidate observed by multiple GW detectors (thus having a significantly smaller sky localization than one-detector events), offering the first opportunity to effectively follow up a GW event of this kind. Our GW MultiMessenger Astronomy DECam Survey (GW-MMADS) campaign consisted of a wide-field search using the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) and T80-South (T80S), as well as galaxy-targeted observations using the Southern Astrophysical Research (SOAR) imager and the Wendelstein 2.1m 3-channel camera. No viable kilonova counterpart was found in our observations. We use our observation depths to place competitive constraints on kilonova models similar to or brighter than the GW170817 kilonova AT 2017gfo within our observed fields, ruling out 100\% of such models with SOAR galaxy-targeted observations and $\sim43$\% (48\%) with DECam (DECam and T80S).

 - **Abstract**
 We present the DeepDive program, in which we obtained deep ($1-3$ hours) JWST/NIRSpec G235M/F170LP spectra for 10 primary massive ($\log{(M_\star/M_\odot)}=10.8-11.5$) quiescent galaxies at $z\sim3-4$. A novel reduction procedure extends the nominal wavelength coverage of G235M beyond H$\alpha$ and [NII] at $z\sim4$, revealing weak, narrow H$\alpha$ lines indicative of low star formation rates (${\rm SFR}\sim0-5\, M_\odot\, {\rm yr^{-1}}$). Two out of 10 primary targets have broad H$\alpha$ lines, indicating the presence of AGNs. We also conduct an archival search of quiescent galaxies observed with NIRSpec gratings in the DAWN JWST Archive, which provides a statistical context for interpreting the DeepDive targets. This archival search provides a spectroscopic sample of 140 quiescent galaxies spanning $1<z<5$ and covering more than an order of magnitude in stellar mass. We revisit the selection of quiescent galaxies based on rest-frame $UVJ$ colors, specific star formation rates, and the detection of the 4000Å spectral break, finding $\sim90\%$ overlap between these criteria. The sample of a total of 150 quiescent galaxies constructed in this study shows that those at $z\sim3-5$, including the DeepDive targets, typically exhibit weaker 4000Å breaks and bluer colors than their lower-redshift counterparts, indicating generally younger stellar populations. Stacked spectra of sources grouped by the $D_n4000$ index reveal faint Iron and Magnesium absorption line features in the stellar continuum even for the low $D_n4000$ ($D_n4000<1.35$) subsample at high redshift ($z\sim3$). In addition, higher $D_n4000$ subsamples show fainter nebular emission lines. These results demonstrate that medium-resolution NIRSpec spectroscopy is essential for robustly characterizing the diversity and evolution of early quiescent galaxies. All data from this study will be made publicly available.
#### Blending effects on shear measurement synergy between Euclid-like and LSST-like surveys

 - **Abstract**
 Weak gravitational lensing is a powerful probe for constraining cosmological parameters, but its success relies on accurate shear measurements. In this paper, we use image simulations to investigate how a joint analysis of high-resolution space-based and deep ground-based imaging can improve shear estimation. We simulate two scenarios: a grid-based setup, where galaxies are placed on a regular grid to mimic an idealised, blending-free scenario, and a random setup, where galaxies are randomly distributed to capture the impact of blending. Comparing these cases, we find that blending introduces significant biases, particularly in LSST-like data due to its larger point spread function. This highlights the importance of including realistic blending effects when evaluating the performance of joint analyses. Using simulations that account for blending, we find that the most effective catalogue-level synergy is achieved by combining all galaxies detected in either survey. This approach yields an effective galaxy number density of $44.08~\rm arcmin^{-2}$ over the magnitude range of 20.0 to 27.5, compared to $39.17~\rm arcmin^{-2}$ for LSST-like data alone and $30.31~\rm arcmin^{-2}$ for \textit{Euclid}-like data alone. Restricting the analysis to only the overlapping sources detected in both surveys results in a gain of ${\sim}12\%$ compared to using either survey alone. While this joint-object approach is suboptimal at the catalogue level, it may become more effective in pixel-level analyses, where a joint fit to individual galaxy shapes can better leverage the complementary strengths of both data sets. Studying such pixel-level combinations, with realistic blending effects properly accounted for, remains a promising direction for future work.

 - **Abstract**
 The analysis of the meridional displacement velocity of individual solar pores and sunspots has been performed. In the period May 2010\,-\,March 2025 of observations in the continuum of the \textit{Solar Dynamics Observatory/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager} (SDO/HMI), we identified more than $3.6\cdot 10^{5}$ sunspots and pores for analysis and tracked their displacement. The velocity of the meridional displacement of spots $v_{\rm m}$ depends on their magnetic polarity, latitude, and stage of development. For sunspots and pores of trailing polarity, the velocity of movement is on average directed toward the poles. For such spots, the dependence of the velocity on latitude can be represented by linear regressions for pores: $v^{\rm pr}_{\rm tr} \approx 2.0+0.62\cdot \theta^{\rm o}$ m s$^{-1}$; for sunspots: $v^{\rm sp}_{\rm tr}\approx 0.02+0.94\cdot \theta ^{\rm o}$ m s$^{-1}$. For sunspots and pores of leading polarity, the dependence is non-monotonic in nature on latitude. For pores: $v^{\rm pr}_{\rm ld}\approx 0.35-11.7\cdot {\rm sin}(\theta)+16.5\cdot {\rm sin}^{\rm 2} (\theta) +76.5\cdot {\rm sin}^3 (\theta)-32.7\cdot {\rm sin}^{4}(\theta )$ m s$^{-1}$; for sunspots: $v^{\rm sp}_{\rm ld}\approx -0.35-18.3\cdot {\rm sin}(\theta)+32.2\cdot {\rm sin}^{\rm 2}(\theta) +71.4\cdot {\rm sin}^{\rm 3} (\theta)-6.7\cdot {\rm sin}^{\rm 4}(\theta)$ m s$^{-1}$. The highest speed of meridional movement to the poles is observed for sunspots of trailing polarity during the phase of growth of the sunspot area. The velocity of the meridional movement depends on their area, reaching a maximum for an area of $S\approx 80 - 100$ $\mu$sh.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a study aimed at quantifying the detectability of radio counterparts of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers with total masses $\lesssim 3$\,M$_{\odot}$, which may form neutron star (NS) remnants. We focus on mergers localized by gravitational-wave (GW) observations to sky areas $\lesssim 10$\,deg$^2$, a precision that greatly facilitates optical counterpart identification and enables radio discovery even without detections at other wavelengths. Widely separated GW detectors are essential for building samples of well-localized BNS mergers accessible to US-based radio telescopes, with minimum yearly detection rates (assuming the smallest values of the BNS local merger rate) ranging from a few with current GW detectors to hundreds with next-generation GW instruments. Current GW networks limit well-localized detections to $z\lesssim 0.2$, while next-generation GW detectors extend the reach to $z\lesssim 0.8$, encompassing the median redshift of short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). With next-generation radio arrays operating at a several tens of GHz and providing an order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity compared to the most sensitive ones available today, short GRB-like jet afterglows can be detected for a large fraction of the considered BNS mergers. At lower radio frequencies, detections with current radio interferometric arrays are feasible, though subject to synchrotron self-absorption effects. The enhanced sensitivity and survey speed of future radio interferometers operating at a few GHz, combined with the higher detection rate of well-localized BNSs enabled by next-generation GW observatories, are key to probing disk-wind and dynamical ejecta afterglows, as well as remnant diversity.

 - **Abstract**
 Based on a unified description of various accretion flows, we find a long-ignored solution - the effectively optically thin accretion flow, occurring at accretion rates around Eddington value. As a consequence of radiation-pressure dominance, the density in a standard thin disc (SSD) decreases with the increase of accretion rates, making the innermost region effectively optically thin. Further increase in accretion rate leads to a rise of the temperature so that the Compton cooling is able to balance the accretion released energy. We demonstrate that the effectively optically thin flow is characterized by moderate temperature and large scattering optical depth, producing a multi-color Wien spectrum. For an appropriate accretion rate, the accretion flow transforms from an outer SSD to an inner effectively optically thin flow. Thus, the spectra of the whole accretion flow exhibit two components, i.e., a multi-color Wien spectrum at higher frequency and a multi-color blackbody, the former could provide an alternative origin of soft X-ray excess or formation of warm corona in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Our stability analysis proves it is thermally stable and viscously unstable, indicating its existence in accreting systems. We show that effectively optically thin accretion flow exists in supermassive black holes for accretion rates around 0.1 to 10 times Eddington value, bridging the SSD at low accretion rates and slim disc at high rates. By comparing the predictions and average spectra of AGN, we constrain the viscosity parameter to be $\alpha \sim 0.03$, in good agreement with that derived from observed variability.
#### How Do Ionizing Photons Escape from Star-Forming Galaxies?

 - **Abstract**
 The Epoch of Reionization marks the last major phase transition in the early Universe, during which the majority of neutral hydrogen once filling the intergalactic medium was ionized by the first galaxies. The James Webb Space Telescope is now identifying promising galaxy candidates capable of producing sufficient ionizing photons to drive this transformation. However, the fraction of these photons that escape into intergalactic space--the escape fraction--remains highly uncertain. Stellar feedback is thought to play a critical role in carving low-density channels that allow ionizing radiation to escape, but the dominant mechanisms, their operation, and their connection to observable signatures are not well understood. Local analogs of high-redshift galaxies offer a powerful alternative for studying these processes, since ionizing radiation is unobservable at high redshift due to intergalactic absorption. However, current UV space-based instrumentation lacks the spatial resolution and sensitivity required to fully address this problem. The core challenge lies in the multiscale nature of LyC escape: ionizing photons are generated on scales of 1-100 pc in super star clusters but must traverse the circumgalactic medium which can extend beyond 100 kpc. A UV integral field unit (IFU) spectrograph capable of resolving galaxies across these scales is necessary--and uniquely achievable with the proposed Habitable Worlds Observatory. In this article, we outline the scientific motivation, observables, and observational capabilities needed to make progress on these fundamental questions.
#### Unveiling the Nature and Fate of the Almost-Dark Cloud AGC 226178 through HI Mapping

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of extragalactic, almost dark HI clouds with extreme gas-to-stellar mass ratios remains poorly understood. We investigate the nature and fate of the "almost dark" cloud AGC 226178, projected within the Virgo cluster, with an HI-to-stellar mass ratio of ~1000. We present deep single-dish HI mapping from the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST), complemented by high-resolution interferometric data from the Very Large Array (VLA), as part of the Atomic gas in Virgo Interacting Dwarf galaxies (AVID) project. These observations provide the highest-quality HI analysis to date of such a cloud, combining resolution and sensitivity. FAST data reveal a short, low-velocity tail toward the dwarf galaxy VCC 2034, previously proposed as a possible origin for AGC 226178. However, VCC 2034 shows a line-of-sight asymmetric HI feature and cometary morphology indicating a stripping event unrelated to AGC 226178. VLA data reveal a velocity gradient across AGC 226178 and a clumpy internal structure. The velocity dispersion exceeds the thermal linewidth, implying turbulence or unresolved motions. The cloud cannot be gravitationally bound by atomic gas alone. The resolved HI clumps follow standard HI mass-star formation rate and mass-size relations, with those forming stars reaching surface densities above the threshold for self-shielding. We conclude that AGC 226178 is a free-floating HI cloud of unknown origin. The system appears to be in the process of disintegration. It is likely located well outside the Virgo cluster, as the preservation of its extended HI morphology within the cluster environment would otherwise require a substantial reservoir of unseen molecular gas with a mass exceeding that of the observed HI content. While confinement pressure from the hot intracluster medium may aid its stability, it is unlikely to be the dominant factor preventing its disruption.
#### A systematic bias in template-based RV extraction algorithms

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper we identify and explore a previously unidentified, multi meter-per-second, systematic correlation between time and RVs inferred through TM and LBL methods. We evaluate the influence of the data-driven stellar template in the RV bias and hypothesize on the possible sources of this effect. We first use the s-BART pipeline to extract RVs from three different datasets gathered over four nights of ESPRESSO and HARPS observations. Then, we demonstrate that the effect can be recovered on a larger sample of 19 targets, totaling 4124 ESPRESSO observations spread throughout 38 nights. We also showcase the presence of the bias in RVs extracted with the SERVAL and ARVE pipelines. Lastly, we explore the construction of the stellar template through the 5 years of ESPRESSO observations of HD10700, totalling more than 2000 observations. We find that a systematic quasi-linear bias affects the RV extraction with slopes that vary from -0.3 m/s-1/h-1 to -52 m/s-1/h-1 in our sample. This trend is not observed in CCF RVs and appears when all observations of a given star are collected within a short time-period (timescales of hours). We show that this systematic contamination exists in the RV time-series of two different template-matching pipelines, one line-by-line pipeline, and that it is agnostic to the spectrograph. We also find that this effect is connected with the construction of the stellar template, as we are able to mitigate it through a careful selection of the observations used to construct it. Our results suggest that a contamination of micro-telluric features, coupled other sources of correlated noise, could be the driving factor of this effect. We also show that this effect does not impact the usual usage of template-matching for the detection and characterization of exoplanets. Other short-timescale science cases can however be severely affected.

 - **Abstract**
 Mapping the spatial distributions and abundances of complex organic molecules in hot cores and hot corinos is crucial for understanding the astrochemical pathways and the inheritance of prebiotic material by nascent planetary systems. However, the line-rich spectra from these sources pose significant challenges for robustly fitting molecular parameters due to severe line blending and unidentified lines. We present an efficient framework, Bayesian Active Spectral-cube Inference and Learning (BASIL), for estimating molecular parameter maps for hundreds of molecules based on the local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) model, applied to wideband spectral datacubes of line-rich sources. We adopted stochastic variational inference to infer molecular parameters from spectra at individual positions, balancing between fitting accuracy and computational speed. For obtaining parameter maps, instead of querying every location or pixel, we introduced an active learning framework based on Bayesian quadrature and its parallelization. Specifically, we assessed and selected the locations or pixels of spectrum that are most informative for estimating the entire set of parameter maps by training a Gaussian processes model. By greedily selecting locations with maximum information gain, we achieve sublinear convergence. We benchmarked BASIL on a large synthetic datacube and demonstrated that it produces accurate 468 molecular parameter maps from 117 molecules within ~180 hours, orders of magnitude faster than traditional pixel-by-pixel fitting using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, with visually reliable results emerging in just ~20 hours. Additional training iterations provide progressively more accurate results. This quick visualization meets the demands of big data in modern astronomical surveys.
#### On the origin of short-lived cocoon in 3C84: powered by tidal disruption events ?

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.23317

 - **Abstract**
 We evaluated the jet power and the density of ambient matter in 3C 84 by using the momentum balance along the jet axis and the transonic condition for the cocoons observed at two different scales (approximately 1 and 6 parsec scales). For the inner cocoon, we precisely determined the ratio of jet power to ambient density $L_{\rm j}/n_{\rm a}$ to be $(0.3-0.7)\times 10^{43}\,{\rm erg}\,{\rm s}^{-1}\,{\rm cm}^3$. Similarly, for the outer cocoon, we found that this value is more than an order of magnitude larger at $(0.9-3.7)\times 10^{44}\,{\rm erg}\,{\rm s}^{-1}\,{\rm cm}^3$. This indicates that the outer cocoon is formed by a powerful jet that propagates through an ambient density of $20-300\,{\rm cm}^{-3}$ with a jet power of $10^{45-46.5}\,{\rm erg}\,{\rm s}^{-1}$. On the other hand, the inner cocoon is formed by a weaker jet with a power of $10^{43-44}\,{\rm erg}\,{\rm s}^{-1}$, propagating through a relatively low-density environment of $6-20\, {\rm cm}^{-3}$. These results suggest that: 1) with respect to the difference in $n_{\rm a}$, it appears to support the hypothesis that the inner cocoon, recently formed about 10 years ago, is expanding in the low-density cocoon created by the jet emitted about 25-50 years ago. 2) to achieve the short-lived and high $L_{\rm j}$ that generated the outer cocoon, a large mass accretion rate must be required over a short period to activate the jet. These may imply the extreme accretion event driven by the tidal disruption events (TDEs) of massive stars and/or the disk instability.

 - **Abstract**
 The recent detection of the ultra-high-energy neutrino event KM3-230213A ($\sim$220 PeV) by KM3NeT telescope poses a challenge to conventional astrophysical models, particularly in light of the absence of similar $\gtrsim$100 PeV events in IceCube data, despite its larger exposure. We propose a novel mechanism in which binary black hole mergers act as transient neutrino sources via gravitationally induced electroweak vacuum instability. In this scenario, the extreme spacetime curvature near the horizons during the final inspiral phase destabilizes the Higgs vacuum, triggering nucleation of true-vacuum bubbles. Collisions between these bubbles produce microscopic black holes that rapidly evaporate via Hawking radiation, emitting intense, short-lived bursts of neutrinos with energies exceeding 100 PeV. The resulting neutrino fluence follows a heavy-tailed distribution, allowing rare but highly luminous sources to account for events like KM3-230213A while remaining consistent with IceCube's non-detections. This framework links gravitational wave sources to ultra-high-energy neutrino production and suggests that future multi-messenger observations may detect electromagnetic signatures from microscopic black hole evaporation.

 Context: A large number of isolated black holes (IBHs) are expected to populate the Galaxy. However, only one has been confirmed by the analysis of a microlensing event, and no confirmed emission detection from an IBH has been reported so far. Aims: We analysed the detectability of electromagnetic signatures from IBHs moving in the Galaxy. Methods: We considered accretion from the interstellar medium onto an IBH and assumed the formation of an outflow. We modelled the accretion process and the interaction of the outflow with the surrounding medium on large scales, including mechanical feedback on the accretion process. Furthermore, we also calculated the emission from three different regions: the accretion region, the radiation from the outflow medium interaction structure, and the emission of relativistic particles that diffuse in the surrounding medium. Results: Multiwavelength emission associated with Galactic IBHs can be detected in systems moving through a very dense medium. Thermal emission from accretion could be observed in the mid infrared and in hard X rays with current and forthcoming observatories. Thermal and non thermal emission from the outflow medium shock could also be detected in the radio and millimetre ranges. Moreover, detection of the emission from particles diffusing in a dense medium could be feasible in gamma rays. Applying our model to the IBH associated with the gravitational microlensing event MOA2011BLG191 OGLE2011BLG0462, we inferred that radio and infrared detection of the IBH is plausible. Also, we derived that IBHs could be modest Galactic cosmic ray contributors, potentially reaching a 1% contribution at 1 PeV. Finally, by extending our model to primordial black holes, we conclude that efficient leptonic acceleration in their outflow medium interactions would rule them out as a major dark matter component.

 - **Abstract**
 The unstable isotope $^{60}$Fe, with a half-life of 2.6 million years, is produced primarily in supernova explosions. The observed presence of $^{60}$Fe in cosmic rays and its detection in deep-sea crusts and sediments suggest two possible scenarios: either the direct acceleration of $^{60}$Fe from supernova ejecta or its enrichment in the circumstellar material surrounding supernova progenitors, which indicates cosmic ray production in clusters of supernovae. Focusing on the latter scenario, we consider an environment shaped by successive supernova explosions, reminiscent of the Local Bubble around the time of the most recent supernova explosion. We independently tracked the evolution of the $^{60}$Fe mass ratio within the Local Bubble using passive scalars. To investigate the spectra of protons and $^{60}$Fe, we explicitly modelled cosmic-ray acceleration and transport at the remnant of the last supernova by simultaneously solving the hydrodynamical equations for the supernova outflow and the transport equations for cosmic rays, scattering turbulence, and large-scale magnetic field, using the time-dependent acceleration code RATPaC. The main uncertainty in our prediction of the local $^{60}$Fe flux at about $pc=1$ GeV/nuc is the magnetic-field structure in the Local Bubble and the cosmic-ray diffusion beyond the approximately $100$ kyr of evolution covered by our study. We found that if the standard galactic propagation applies, the local $^{60}$Fe flux would be around 3% of that measured. If there is a sustained reduction in the diffusion coefficient at and near the Local Bubble, then the expected $^{60}$Fe flux could be up to 30% of that measured.

 - **Abstract**
 Using both analytical and numerical means, we demonstrate that linear stability analysis of a hydrodynamic stratified atmosphere or a 1D coronal loop model in non-adiabatic settings features a thermal continuum corresponding to highly localized eigenfunctions. This thermal continuum can be precomputed, involving the net heat-loss function and its partial derivatives, and is the generalization of the thermal instability introduced by~\citet{Parker1953}. We account for a thermal imbalance, directly affecting thermal instability growthrates. We present completely general equations that govern all eigenmodes, including non-adiabatically affected p- and g-modes of the stratified settings. We intend to clarify how linear thermal instability is relevant for solar loops that show spontaneous in-situ condensations, and eliminate recent confusion on specific isochoric routes to linear instability alongside other thermal instability channels. The thermal continuum, previously identified as a crucial ingredient in magnetohydrodynamic eigenmode spectra for coronal loops and atmospheres, drives multithermal aspects across our universe, such as forming solar coronal rain and prominences, or cold cloud creation in intracluster to interstellar medium environments.

 - **Abstract**
 Numerical simulations can follow the evolution of fluid motions through the intricacies of developed turbulence. However, they are rather costly to run, especially in 3D. In the past two decades, generative models have emerged which produce synthetic random flows at a computational cost equivalent to no more than a few time-steps of a simulation. These simplified models qualitatively bear some characteristics of turbulent flows in specific contexts (incompressible 3D hydrodynamics or magnetohydrodynamics), but generally struggle with the synthesis of coherent structures. We aim at generating random fields (e.g. velocity, density, magnetic fields, etc.) with realistic physical properties for a large variety of governing partial differential equations and at a small cost relative to time-resolved simulations. We propose a set of approximations applied to given sets of partial differential equations, and test the validity of our method in the simplest framework: 2D decaying incompressible hydrodynamical turbulence. We compare results of 2D decaying simulations with snapshots of our synthetic turbulence. We assess quantitatively the difference first with standard statistical tools: power spectra, increments and structure functions. These indicators can be reproduced by our method during up to about a third of the turnover time scale. We also consider recently developed scattering transforms statistics, able to efficiently characterise non-Gaussian structures. This reveals more significant discrepancy, which can however be bridged by bootstrapping. Finally, the number of Fourier transforms necessary for one synthesis scales logarithmically in the resolution, compared to linearly for time-resolved simulations. We have designed a multiscale turbulence synthesis (MuScaTS) method to efficiently short-circuit costly numerical simulations to produce realistic instantaneous fields.

 - **Abstract**
 In recent years supergranulation has emerged as one of the biggest challenges for the detection of Earth-twins in radial velocity planet searches. We used eight years of Sun-as-a-star radial velocity observations from HARPS-N to measure the quiet-Sun's granulation and supergranulation properties of most of its 11-year activity cycle, after correcting for the effects of magnetically active regions using two independent methods. In both cases, we observe a clear, order of magnitude variation in the time-scale of the supergranulation component, which is largest at activity minimum and is strongly anti-correlated with the relative Sunspot number. We also explored a range of observational strategies which could be employed to characterise supergranulation in stars other than the Sun, showing that a comparatively long observing campaign of at least 23 nights is required, but that up to 10 stars can be monitored simultaneously in the process. We conclude by discussing plausible explanations for the "supergranulation" cycle.

 - **Abstract**
 The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), being a nearby and actively star-forming satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, is an ideal site to observe the multi-phase interstellar medium (ISM) of a galaxy across the electromagnetic spectrum. We aim to exploit the available SRG/eROSITA all-sky survey data to study the distribution, composition and properties of the diffuse X-ray emitting hot gas in the LMC. We construct multi-band X-ray images of the LMC, reflecting the morphology and temperatures of the diffuse hot gas. By performing spatially resolved X-ray spectroscopy of 175 regions, we constrain the distribution, physical state, and composition of the hot ISM phase throughout the LMC. We combine our constraints with multiwavelength data to obtain a comprehensive view of the different ISM phases. We measure a total X-ray luminosity of the hot ISM phase of $1.9\times10^{38}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$ ($0.2-5.0\,\mathrm{keV}$ band), and constrain its thermal energy to around $5\times10^{54}\,\mathrm{erg}$. The typical density and temperature of the X-ray emitting plasma are around $5\times10^{-3}\,\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ and $0.25\,\mathrm{keV}$, respectively, with both exhibiting broad peaks in the southeast of the LMC. The observed degree of X-ray absorption correlates strongly with the distribution of foreground HI gas, whereas a spatial anticorrelation between the hot and cold ISM phases is visible on sub-kpc scales within the disk. The abundances of light metals show a strong gradient throughout the LMC, with the north and east exhibiting a strong $\alpha$-enhancement, as expected from observed massive stellar populations there. In contrast, the enigmatic ``X-ray spur'' exhibits a local deficit in $\alpha$-elements, and a peak in hot-gas pressure at $P/k\sim10^5\,\mathrm{K\,cm^{-3}}$, consistent with a dominant energy input through tidally driven gas collisions.

 The NEID Earth Twin Survey (NETS) has been delivering a rich set of precise radial velocity (RV) measurements for 41 bright, nearby main sequence stars. Here, we describe the status of the survey after three years on sky and we present the full set of RV measurements and accompanying stellar activity indicators. We discuss intermediate survey diagnostics, including calibration of the known RV zero point offset introduced following the Contreras fire in 2022 and the identification of an undiagnosed and previously unknown zero point offset in 2021. An analysis of our data set using exttt{RVSearch} demonstrates that for these target stars, NEID is independently sensitive to nearly all known planets with periods shorter than the NETS observing baseline. We also highlight a number of newly detected RV signals, which present exciting opportunities for future investigations.
#### Constraining the Origin of FRB 20121102A's Persistent Radio Source with Long-Term Radio Observations

 - **Abstract**
 The persistent radio source (PRS) associated with FRB 20121102A, the first precisely localized repeating fast radio burst (FRB), provides key constraints on both its local environment and the nature of the underlying FRB engine. We present a seven-year (2016-2023) temporal analysis of the PRS, combining new uGMRT observations with archival data across L-band frequencies. We find no statistically significant long-term trend in its L-band flux density. The observed variability is consistent with refractive interstellar scintillation, and the data do not require the PRS to be a source exhibiting strong intrinsic variability. This stability challenges models predicting rapid fading from evolving magnetized outflows, such as those powered by young magnetars or relativistic shocks. Our low-frequency observations show no evidence for spectral evolution between 1.4 GHz and 745 MHz, with a measured spectral index of $\alpha = -0.15 \pm 0.08$, in agreement with values reported from earlier observations in 2016-2017. The PRS remains compact, exhibits a flat radio spectrum, and-if powered by an intermediate-mass black hole accreting at a low Eddington ratio-its radio and X-ray properties are broadly consistent with the fundamental plane of radio-loud AGNs. While not conclusive, this scenario represents a viable alternative to magnetar wind nebula models and warrants further investigation. Furthermore, we find no statistically significant correlation between FRB burst activity and the luminosity of associated PRSs among repeating sources. This apparent decoupling challenges simple progenitor models that directly link bursts and persistent emission. Together, these results suggest that the FRB engine and PRS may in some systems originate from physically distinct sources, underscoring the need for flexible models to explain the diverse environments of repeating FRBs.
#### Spectropolarimetric synthesis of forbidden lines in MHD models of coronal bright points

 - **Abstract**
 The inference of the magnetic field vector from spectropolarimetric observations is crucial for understanding the physical processes governing the solar corona. We investigate which information on the magnetic fields of coronal bright points (CBP) can be gained from the intensity and polarization of the Fe XIII 10747 A, Fe XIV 5303 A, Si X 14301 A, and Si IX 39343 A forbidden lines. We apply the P-CORONA synthesis code to a CBP model in the very low corona, obtained with the Bifrost code, and to a larger global model to study the impact of the outer coronal material along the line of sight (LoS). The enhanced density within the CBP produces an intensity brightening, but suppresses the linear polarization. The circular polarization from such regions often approaches 0.1% of the intensity. The contribution from the coronal material along the LoS depends strongly on its temperature, and is weaker for lines with a peak response at higher temperatures (Fe10747 at 1.7 MK; Fe5303 at 2 MK). The weak field approximation (WFA) provides information on the longitudinal magnetic fields in the strongest-emitting spatial intervals along the LoS, and is more reliable in the regions of the CBP where the field does not change sign. This tends to coincide with the regions where there is a strong correlation between the circular polarization and the wavelength derivative of the intensity. Considering roughly 30 minutes of time evolution, the CBP signals are somewhat attenuated but are still identifiable, while the area where the WFA can be suitably applied remains substantial. The circular polarization of the Fe5303 and especially Fe10747 lines are valuable diagnostics for the magnetic fields in the higher-temperature regions of the CBP, which could be exploited with future coronagraphs with similar capabilities to Cryo-NIRSP/DKIST, but designed to observe below 1.05 solar radii.

 - **Abstract**
 Modeling the broadband emission of blazars has become increasingly challenging with the advent of multimessenger observations. Building upon previous successes in applying convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to leptonic emission scenarios, we present an efficient CNN-based approach for modeling blazar emission under proton synchrotron and hybrid lepto-hadronic frameworks. Our CNN is trained on extensive numerical simulations generated by SOPRANO, which span a comprehensive parameter space accounting for the injection and all significant cooling processes of electrons and protons. The trained CNN captures complex interactions involving both primary and secondary particles, effectively reproducing electromagnetic and neutrino emissions. This allows for rapid and thorough exploration of the parameter space characteristic of hadronic and hybrid emission scenarios. The effectiveness of the trained CNN is demonstrated through fitting the spectral energy distributions of two prominent blazars, TXS 0506+059 and PKS 0735+178, both associated with IceCube neutrino detections. The modeling is conducted under assumptions of constant neutrino flux across distinct energy ranges, as well as by adopting a fitting that incorporates the expected neutrino event count through a Poisson likelihood method. The trained CNN is integrated into the Markarian Multiwavelength Data Center (MMDC; this https URL), offering a robust tool for the astrophysical community to explore blazar jet physics within a hadronic framework.

 - **Abstract**
 Avalanche models running in a self-organized critical regime have proven powerful in reproducing the power-law distributions and scale invariance that characterize the statistical properties of solar flares. They are often interpreted as representing an individual active region of the Sun. As a result, this class of models has rarely been applied to describe sympathetic flares $\unicode{x2014}$ solar eruptions that occur in close spatial and temporal proximity, seemingly driven by their mutual interaction. In this study, we investigate the phenomenon of sympathetic flaring using avalanche models and compare their statistical properties with observations of sympathetic flares on the Sun. We developed a novel avalanche model featuring two connected lattices, each representing a distinct active region. This connectivity allows the transfer of nodal variable between the lattices, simulating the non-local effects expected to occur during sympathetic flares. Our results show that under strong connectivity, the lattices exhibit temporal synchronization, with correlations between their avalanche energies. Furthermore, increasing the connectivity between the lattices results in an excess of avalanches at short waiting times. A quantitative comparison with observational data suggests that only a weak connectivity allows our model to replicate the observed solar waiting time distributions. Consequently, we propose that if magnetic connectivity between distinct active regions drives sympathetic flaring on the Sun, it must remain relatively weak.

 - **Abstract**
 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are believed to be powered by accretion of matter onto a supermassive black hole. A fundamental ingredient in shaping our understanding of AGN is their variability across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Variability studies have the potential to help us understand the geometry of the emitting regions (in various energy bands), their causal relations, and the physics of the accretion processes. This review focuses on the observational properties of AGN variability in the optical/UV/X-ray bands (where most of the AGN luminosity is emitted) and their dependence on the AGN physical parameters (i.e. mass, luminosity, accretion rate). We also discuss possible interpretations in the context of accreting compact systems, and we review the use of variability as a tool to discover AGN and trace their properties across cosmic time, using both ground and space facilities. Finally, we discuss the opportunities and challenges provided by current and next-generation optical/X-ray surveys, to use variability as an effective tool to probe the growth of super massive black holes in the Universe.
#### A possible two-fold scenario for the disc-corona of the luminous AGN 1H 0419--577: a high-density disc or a warm corona

 - **Abstract**
 [abridged] 1H 0419-577 is a highly-accreting, luminous BLS1 AGN. This study aims to characterise its disc-corona system using, for the first time, simultaneous XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations, performed in May and November 2018. We conducted high-resolution grating spectroscopy to identify potential soft X-ray absorption and emission features. To measure the hot corona temperatures from the spectral analysis above 3 keV, we also included data from a previous NuSTAR observation from June 2015. We characterised the disc-corona system properties by analysing the broadband spectra and the SED from UV to hard X-rays. 1H 0419-577 was observed in a bare-like high-flux state at both epochs, with negligible neutral and ionised absorption along its line of sight at both Galactic and AGN rest-frames. However, several soft X-ray emission lines were detected, notably a broad and intense OVII line indicating an accretion disc origin at only a few tens of gravitational radii. The broadband X-ray spectra revealed a prominent, absorption-free smooth soft X-ray excess, a weak Fe Kalpha complex, and a lack of a Compton hump. Fitting data above 3 keV yielded apparent moderate hot corona temperatures of ~20-30 keV for the 2018 and 2015 observations, depending on the model applied. The 2018 X-ray broadband spectra were well reproduced by either a relativistic reflection model with a high-density accretion disc (~10^18 cm^-2), or a hybrid model combining warm and hot coronae with relativistic reflection. We performed the SED analysis for the latter scenario, which indicated that both the hot and warm coronae would have a small spatial extent. Both scenarios can successfully reproduce the two 2018 observations of 1H 0419-577, but they imply very different physical conditions, for example, in terms of disc density, temperature and accretion power released in the hot corona and the origin of the UV emission.
#### Anchoring Stellar Age Indicators: A Cross-Calibration of [C/N] and Gyrochronology Ages via the Age-Velocity-Dispersion Relation

 - **Abstract**
 Determining stellar ages is challenging, as it depends on other stellar parameters in a non-linear way and often relies on stellar evolution models to infer the underlying relation between these parameters and age. This complexity increases when comparing different age-dating methods, as they rely on distinct indicators and are often applicable to non-overlapping regions of the color-magnitude diagram. Moreover, many empirical calibration methods rely on pre-determined ages, often from open clusters or asteroseismology, which only cover a limited parameter space. Fortunately, the age-velocity-dispersion relation (AVR), in which the velocity dispersion increases with age, is a universal feature among stars of all evolutionary stages. In this paper, we 1) explore the parameter space in which [C/N] and gyrochronology are applicable, extending beyond the domains probed by asteroseismology and open clusters, and 2) assess whether the traditionally assumed [C/N] and gyrochronology relations yield ages on a consistent physical scale, after calibrating both using the same AVR. We find gyrochronology can be applied to all partially convective stars after they have converged onto the slow rotating sequence and before they experience weakened magnetic braking; [C/N] can be used to infer ages for all giants with metallicity > -0.8 dex and [C/N] < -0.05 dex, and can be used as an age-indicator down to [Fe/H] of -1 dex if only selecting the low-$\alpha$ disk. Lastly, ages obtained from [C/N] and gyrochronology agree within uncertainty after accounting for systematic offsets.

 - **Abstract**
 Precise measurement of the Hubble parameter will enable stringent tests of the standard model for cosmology. Standard sirens, using the luminosity distances measured by gravitational-wave observations of compact binary mergers, are expected to provide such measurements independently in the next decade. With the ground- and space-based gravitational wave observatories, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) network and the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), different types of standard sirens altogether will place constraints across a wide redshift range. In this paper, we forecast the precisions of standard siren Hubble parameter measurements and compare various scenarios, accounting for the dominant sources of systematic uncertainty. Specifically, we find a $2\%$ constraint on $H_0$, a $1.5-3\%$ constraint on $H(z)$ at $z=1$, and a $3-5\%$ constraint on $H(z)$ at $z=7$ when combining LVK and LISA standard sirens with precise redshift measurements from electromagnetic counterpart observations. We do not find a significant improvement when including standard sirens with no EM counterpart, but which rely on features in the black hole mass distribution, and the potential systematics introduced by the possible redshift evolution of such features could further degrade the measurement accuracy if not properly accounted for.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxies form due to the continuous accretion of gaseous material towards the centre of dark matter haloes, which gives rise to stellar discs once the gas reaches high density. Analysis of stellar age distribution shows that stars in the inner regions of the disc are born at earlier times, in contrast to those found in the outer regions, which constitute a younger population. This scheme, typical of galactic formation processes, is known as the "inside-out" scenario and is closely related to the global properties of a significant fraction of the population of spiral galaxies. In this study, we analyse model galaxies from the Auriga project, a set of high-resolution, magnetohydrodynamic cosmological simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies, to investigate the distribution of metals at $z=0$. Since different galactic components were subjected to different formation histories, we focus on the distribution of metals in the halo, bulge, and disc using a dynamical decomposition method based on the degree of rotation of the stars and their gravitational potential.

 We use [CII] observations of a large QSO sample to segregate sources by host galaxy mass, aiming to identify those in the most massive hosts. [CII] luminosity, a known tracer of molecular gas, is taken as a proxy for host mass and used to rank 190 QSOs at z>5.9, spanning a 6-mag UV luminosity range (-22<Muv<-28). Particularly valuable are ALMA data from a cycle-10 CISTERN program, providing [CII] coverage for 46 UV-faint (M_{UV,AB}>-24.5) and 25 especially UV-faint (Muv>-23.5) QSOs, improving statistics by 5x and 6x, respectively. Taking massive host galaxies to be those where L[CII]>1.8x10^9 Lsol (median L[CII] of UV-bright QSOs), we identify 61 QSOs, including 13 which are UV-faint and 7 especially UV-faint. Using these selections and recent QSO luminosity functions (LFs), we present the first characterization of UV luminosity distribution for QSOs in massive host galaxies and quantify [CII] LFs for both UV-bright and UV-faint QSOs. While ~3% of massive-host QSOs are UV-bright (Muv<-26), >~85% are UV-faint (Muv>-24.5). This wide dispersion in UV luminosities reflects variations in dust obscuration, accretion efficiency, and black hole mass. Though spectroscopy is needed for definitive conclusions, black hole mass appears to be the dominant factor driving variations in the UV luminosity, based on 34 [CII]-luminous (L[CII]>1.8x10^9 Lsol) QSOs distributed across a ~3-mag baseline in UV luminosity and with measured MBH. At Muv~-23, the median extrapolated log10 (MBH/Msol) is 8.1+/-0.4, consistent with the local relation. SMBHs in UV-bright QSOs thus appear to be ~15(-9)(+25)x more massive than typical for massive host galaxies at z~6.

 - **Abstract**
 Since the discovery of the first exoplanet orbiting a Sun-like star, the confirmation of nearly 6000 exoplanets to date - and their diversity - has revolutionized our knowledge of planetary systems in the past three decades. Nevertheless, the majority of these planets are around mature stars (${\gtrsim}1$ Gyr), where the planet birth environments have already dissipated. Indeed, we have only confirmed 2 forming planets (i.e., protoplanets; ${\lesssim}10$ Myr) residing in one single system. In comparison, we have imaged over 200 protoplanetary disks in the past decade, with many of them hosting substructures such as spirals and gaps which suggest the existence of protoplanets. To understand the early stages of planet formation, the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) - with its high-contrast imaging and integral field spectroscopy capabilities - presents a unique opportunity to explore the demographics of the natal stages of planet formation and their birth environments. We propose to image protoplanets within substructured protoplanetary disks using HWO via direct imaging, and characterize them (i.e., protoplanets, protoplanetary disks, circumplanetary disks) using integral field spectroscopy and spectropolarimetry. This effort will dramatically extend current population of protoplanets, probing and characterizing over 200 protoplanets. By expanding the number of protoplanets by two orders of magnitude, these observations will test and refine planet formation theory and planet-disk interaction theory, and further motivate planet migration studies together with existing mature planets. The results will offer critical insight into planetary system formation and evolution, and help understand the origin of our own Solar System.
