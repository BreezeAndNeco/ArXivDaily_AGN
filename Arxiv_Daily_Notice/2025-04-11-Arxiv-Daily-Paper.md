 - **Abstract**
 The interstellar medium (ISM) of our Galaxy is magnetized, compressible and turbulent, influencing many key ISM properties, like star formation, cosmic ray transport, and metal and phase mixing. Yet, basic statistics describing compressible, magnetized turbulence remain uncertain. Utilizing grid resolutions up to $10,080^3$ cells, we simulate highly-compressible, magnetized ISM-style turbulence with a magnetic field maintained by a small-scale dynamo. We measure two coexisting kinetic energy cascades, $\mathcal{E}_{\rm kin}(k) \propto k^{-n}$, in the turbulence, separating the plasma into scales that are non-locally interacting, supersonic and weakly magnetized $(n=2.01\pm 0.03\approx 2)$ and locally interacting, subsonic and highly magnetized $(n=1.465\pm 0.002\approx 3/2)$, where $k$ is the wavenumber. We show that the $3/2$ spectrum can be explained with scale-dependent kinetic energy fluxes and velocity-magnetic field alignment. On the highly magnetized modes, the magnetic energy spectrum forms a local cascade $(n=1.798\pm 0.001\approx 9/5)$, deviating from any known \textit{ab initio} theory. With a new generation of radio telescopes coming online, these results provide a means to directly test if the ISM in our Galaxy is maintained by the compressible turbulent motions from within it.

 - **Abstract**
 Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are rapid, recurring X-ray bursts from supermassive black holes, believed to result from interactions between accretion disks and surrounding matter. The galaxy SDSS1335+0728, previously stable for two decades, exhibited an increase in optical brightness in December 2019, followed by persistent Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN)-like variability for 5 years, suggesting the activation of a $\sim$10$^6\;M_\odot$ black hole. From February 2024, X-ray emission has been detected, revealing extreme $\sim$4.5-day QPEs with the highest fluxes and amplitudes, longest time scales, largest integrated energies, and a $\sim$25-day super-period. Low-significance UV variations are reported for the first time in a QPE host, likely related to the long timescales and large radii from which the emission originates. This discovery broadens the possible formation channels for QPEs, suggesting they are not linked solely to tidal disruption events but more generally to newly formed accretion flows, which we are witnessing in real time in a turn-on AGN candidate.
#### Galactic Accelerations from the GD-1 Stream Suggest a Tilted Dark Matter Halo

 - **Abstract**
 Cold dark matter halos are expected to be triaxial and often tilted relative to the stellar disk. Stellar streams provide a sensitive tracer of the Milky Way's halo shape, though models for the Galactic potential are typically limited to simple, symmetric functional forms. Here, we measure the Galactic acceleration field along the GD-1 stellar stream using a direct differentiation of the stream's track in phase-space. Using a fully data-driven catalog of stream members from Gaia, SDSS, LAMOST, and DESI, we map the stream in 6D phase-space. We fit splines to the stream track, and infer cylindrical acceleration components $a_R = -2.5 \pm_{0.1}^{0.2}, \ a_z = -1.8\pm 0.1, \ a_\phi = 0.2\pm 0.1~\rm{km \ s^{-1} \ Myr^{-1}}$ at $(R,z,\phi) = (11.9~\rm{kpc}, 7.3~\rm{kpc}, 171.1~\rm{deg})$. We measure mass enclosed within $14~\rm{kpc}$ of $1.4\pm 0.1 \times 10^{11} M_\odot$ and z-axis density flattening of $q_{\rho, z} = 0.81\pm^{0.06}_{0.03}$, both consistent with previous estimates. However, we find a 2$\sigma$ deviation from an axisymmetric acceleration field, which can be explained by a triaxial dark matter halo with axis ratios 1:0.75:0.70. The major axis of the halo is consistent with a tilt of $18~\rm{deg}$ above the Galactic plane in the direction of the Sun. The magnitude and direction of the tilt are consistent with measurements of the Milky Way's stellar halo from Gaia and the H3 survey. A tilted triaxial halo has important consequences for orbit-integration-based studies of the Galaxy, and can be further tested by deriving acceleration constraints from multiple streams.

 - **Abstract**
 Direct imaging campaigns executed with James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will enable the study of the faintest observable exoplanets yet. To assist observers in the JWST proposal process, we present an in-depth exploration of the effects of moderate contrast binary (visual and physical) systems on JWST NIRCam coronagraphic Reference Differential Imaging (RDI) methods. All work in this paper is based on simulation data generated using the Python package PanCAKE, in addition to a variety of custom scripts which we have made publicly available on GitHub. Presenting both contrast curves and more involved 'heatmaps' of sensitivity loss, we present quantifiable measurements for how a binary companion will impact contrast both totally and locally, as a function of magnitude, separation, and position angle. Observers can use results in this work to estimate the impact of a known binary, and in some cases will find that PSF subtraction can still be reliably performed. We have found several scenarios where JWST NIRCam coronagraphic RDI PSF subtraction can be viably performed using a binary reference and make several suggestions. The brightest binary companions analyzed, with a relative brightness of 1e-3, resulted in the worst local sensitivity loss of 3.02 units of magnitude. The faintest binary companions looked at, 1e-6 relative brightness, have almost no effect on local sensitivity. Changing position angle impacts sensitivity loss by 0.5 to 0.3 depending on companion flux. Binary companion separation considerations should be on a case-by-case science goal basis. This work also discusses the trade space for these suggestions in detail.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the HST ACS G800L grism spectroscopy observation of the faint active galactic nuclei (AGN) candidates in the COSMOS field at redshift of 6 selected by the point-source morphology and the photometry drop-off at 8000Å. Among the sample of 7 objects, only one is detected by multiple bands, and has similar shape of spectral energy distribution as the so-called ``little red dots'' JWST selected AGN candidates, but our object is 3 magnitude brighter than the JWST sample. We draw the upper limit of the AGN luminosity function $\Phi=1.1\times 10^{-7}$Mpc$^3$ mag$^{-1}$ for $M_{UV}$=$-21$ at redshift of 6. The rest of the sample shows inconsistent flux density when comparing magnitudes of HST ACS F814W to the Subaru $i$-band and $z$-band magnitudes combined. The HST ACS G800L grism observation shows that this inconsistency cannot be created from an emission line. Therefore, we speculate that these objects are transients with the light curve decay timescale at most 6 years in observed frame.
#### Rapid inference and comparison of gravitational-wave population models with neural variational posteriors

 - **Abstract**
 The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA catalog has been analyzed with an abundance of different population models due to theoretical uncertainty in the formation of gravitational-wave sources. To expedite model exploration, we introduce an efficient and accurate variational Bayesian approach that learns the population posterior with a normalizing flow and serves as a drop-in replacement for existing samplers. With hardware acceleration, inference takes just seconds for the current set of black-hole mergers and readily scales to larger catalogs. The trained posteriors provide an arbitrary number of independent samples with exact probability densities, unlike established stochastic sampling algorithms that otherwise match with Jensen-Shannon divergences below 0.1 nats in our 14-dimensional parameter space, while requiring up to three orders of magnitude fewer likelihood evaluations and as few as $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$. Provided the posterior support is covered, discrepancies can be addressed with smoothed importance sampling, which quantifies a goodness-of-fit metric for the variational approximation while also estimating the evidence for Bayesian model selection. Neural variational inference thus enables interactive development, analysis, and comparison of population models, making it a useful tool for astrophysical interpretation of current and future gravitational-wave observations.
#### Magnetic Webs in Stellar Radiative Zones

 - **Abstract**
 Rotational evolution of stellar radiative zones is an old puzzle. We argue that angular momentum (AM) transport by turbulent processes induced by differential rotation is insufficient, and propose that a key role is played by ``magnetic webs." We define magnetic webs as stable magnetic configurations that enforce corotation of their coupled mass shells. Stable magnetic configurations naturally form through relaxation of helical magnetic fields deposited in parts of radiative zones. We discuss the conditions for a magnetic configuration to be sufficiently sturdy to prevent the build up of differential rotation, and conclude that these conditions are easily met in stellar interiors. Low mass stars on the red giant branch (RGB) likely have their compact cores coupled to the lower part of their extended radiative mantle by a magnetic web that was deposited by the receding zone of core convection on the main sequence. This results in moderate core rotation that is broadly consistent with asteroseismic observations, as we illustrate with a stellar evolution model with mass $1.6M_\odot$. Evolving massive stars host more complicated patterns of convective zones that may leave behind many webs, transporting AM towards the surface. Efficient web formation likely results in most massive stars dying with magnetized and slowly rotating cores.
#### MHD simulations of the slow-rise phase of solar eruptions initiated from a sheared magnetic arcade

 - **Abstract**
 Before solar eruptions, a short-term slow-rise phase is often observed, during which the pre-eruption structure ascends at speeds much greater than the photospheric motions but much less than those of the eruption phase. Numerical magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the coronal evolution driven by photospheric motions up to eruptions have been used to explain the slow-rise phase, but their bottom driving speeds are much larger than realistic photospheric values. Therefore, it remains an open question how the excessively fast bottom driving impacts the slow-rise phase. Here we modelled the slow-rise phase before eruption initiated from a continuously sheared magnetic arcade. In particular, we performed a series of experiments with the bottom driving speed unprecedentedly approaching the photospheric value of around $1$ km s$^{-1}$. The simulations confirmed that the slow-rise phase is an ideal MHD process, i.e., a manifestation of the growing expansion of the sheared arcade in the process of approaching a fully open field state. The overlying field line above the core flux has a slow-rise speed modulated by the driving speed's magnitude but is always over an order of magnitude larger than the driving speed. The core field also expands with speed much higher than the driving speed but much lower than that of the overlying field. By incrementally reducing the bottom-driving speed to realistic photospheric values, we anticipate better matches between the simulated slow-rise speeds and some observed ones.
#### Polarization Angle Orthogonal Jumps in Fast Radio Bursts

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, polarization angle (PA) orthogonal jumps over millisecond timescale were discovered from three bursts of a repeating fast radio burst source FRB 20201124A by the FAST telescope. We investigate the physical implications of this phenomenon. In general, PA jumps can arise from the superposition of two electromagnetic waves, either coherently or incoherently, as the dominance of the two orthogonal modes switches. In the coherent case, PA jumps occur when linear polarization reaches a minimum and circular polarization peaks, with the total polarization degree conserved. However, incoherent superposition can lead to depolarization. The observations seem to be more consistent with incoherent superposition. The amplitudes of the two orthogonal modes are required to be comparable when jumps occur, placing constraints on the intrinsic radiation mechanisms. We provide general constraints on FRB emission and propagation mechanisms based on the data. Physically, it is difficult to produce PA jumps by generating two orthogonal modes within millisecond timescales, and a geometric effect due to sweeping line-of-sight is a more plausible reason. This requires the emission region to be within the magnetosphere of a spinning central engine, likely a magnetar. The two orthogonal modes may be produced by intrinsic radiation mechanisms or Alfvén-O-mode transition. Plasma birefringence is not easy to achieve when the plasma is moving relativistically. Curvature radiation predicts $|E_{\rm X}/E_{\rm O}|\gtrsim1$, and is difficult to produce jumps; whereas inverse Compton scattering can achieve the transition amplitude ratio $|E_{\rm X}/E_{\rm O}|=1$ to allow jumps to occur under special geometric configurations.

 - **Abstract**
 The number of resident space objects is rising at an alarming rate. Mega-constellations and breakup events are proliferating in most orbital regimes, and safe navigation is becoming increasingly problematic. It is important to be able to track RSOs accurately and at an affordable computational cost. Orbital dynamics are highly nonlinear, and current operational methods assume Gaussian representations of the objects' states and employ linearizations which cease to hold true in observation-free propagation. Monte Carlo-based filters can provide a means to approximate the a posteriori probability distribution of the states more accurately by providing support in the portion of the state space which overlaps the most with the processed observations. Moreover, dynamical models are not able to capture the full extent of realistic forces experienced in the near-Earth space environment, and hence fully deterministic propagation methods may fail to achieve the desired accuracy. By modeling orbital dynamics as a stochastic system and solving it using stochastic numerical integrators, we are able to simultaneously estimate the scale of the process noise incurred by the assumed uncertainty in the system, and robustly track the state of the spacecraft. In order to find an adequate balance between accuracy and computational cost, we propose three algorithms which are capable of tracking a space object and estimating the magnitude of the system's uncertainty. The proposed filters are successfully applied to a LEO scenario, demonstrating the ability to accurately track a spacecraft state and estimate the scale of the uncertainty online, in various simulation setups.
#### How to identify the object with mass range of $(2.2-3)M_\odot$ in the merger of compact star systems

 - **Abstract**
 High-frequency gravitational-wave (GW) radiation has been detected by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA in the merger of compact stars. However, two GW events, GW190814 and GW200210, the mass of one companion object falls into the mass region of $(2.2-3)\rm~M_\odot$, and how to identify such object (e.g., as a low-mass black hole (BH) or a massive neutron star (NS)) remains an open question. In this paper, we propose a method to identify the mystery compact object (MCO) with the mass region of $(2.2-3)\rm~M_\odot$ in a binary system via the possible electromagnetic (EM) radiations before and after the mergers. A multi-band EM emission can be produced with $L\propto(-t)^{7/4}$ (or $L\propto(-t)^{-5/4}$) during the inspiral phase due to the BH battery (or interaction magnetospheres) mechanism, and a bright (or dark) kilonova emission is powered by radioactive decay with ejecta mass ratio $q>1.7$ (or $q<1.7$) during the post-merge state when MCO is as a low-mass BH (or massive NS) to merger with NS. Moreover, by considering the merger system between MCO and a BH when MCO is a massive NS, we find that it requires the BH with high spin (e.g., $a\sim0.8-0.99$) to make sure the tidal disruption event (TDE) occurred, and a multi-band precursor emission and bright kilonova emission can also be produced during the inspiral phase and post-merge state, respectively. In any case, no matter which mechanism we adopt, such precursor emissions are too weak to be detected by most current telescopes unless the distance is close enough.
#### Millimeter emission from supermassive black hole coronae

 - **Abstract**
 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) host accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs). The accretion can lead to the formation of a hot, X-ray emitting corona close to the SMBH capable of accelerating relativistic electrons. Observations in the millimetre (mm) band can probe its synchrotron emission. We provide a framework to derive physical information of SMBH coronae by modelling their spectral energy distribution (SED) from radio to far infrared frequencies. We also explore the possibilities of deriving additional information from mm observations, such as the SMBH mass, and studying high-redshift lensed sources. We introduce a corona emission model based on a one-zone spherical region with a hybrid thermal and non-thermal plasma. We investigate in detail how the corona SED depends on different parameters such as size, opacity, and magnetic field strength. Other galactic emission components from dust, ionised gas and diffuse relativistic electrons are also included in the SED fitting scheme. We apply our code consistently to a sample of radio-quiet AGN with strong indications of a coronal component in the mm. The detected mm emission from SMBH coronae is consistent with having a non-thermal relativistic particle population with an energy density that is ~0.5-10% of that in the thermal plasma. This requires magnetic energy densities close to equipartition with the thermal gas, and corona sizes of 60-250 gravitational radii. The model can also reproduce the observed correlation between mm emission and SMBH mass when accounting for uncertainties in the corona size. The mm band offers a unique window into the physics of SMBH coronae, enabling the study of highly dust-obscured sources and high-redshift lensed quasars. Gaining a deeper understanding of the relativistic particle population in SMBH coronae can provide key insights into their potential multiwavelength and neutrino emission.
#### Magnetic Fields of Satellite Galaxies Stronger Than Comparable Centrals in TNG100

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic fields exist in and around galaxies, but the properties of these fields have not been fully explored due to the challenges inherent in observing and modeling them. In this Note, we explore the differences in magnetic field strength of central and satellite galaxies from the magnetohydrodynamic TNG100 simulation. We find that on average, magnetic fields in satellite galaxies are roughly an order of magnitude stronger than those of central galaxies with comparable masses. The difference is greater for satellites that have already approached within $1 R_{200}$ of their host galaxies. These results indicate that magnetic fields in satellite galaxies are amplified by environmental processes as they fall into a host halo.
#### Baryon asymmetry constraints on magnetic field from the Electroweak epoch

 - **Abstract**
 Decay of helical (hyper)magnetic fields that may have been present in the Universe during the Electroweak epoch can contribute to generation of the baryon asymmetry of the Universe. We revise constraints on the strength and correlation length of such fields from the requirement that their decay does not lead to over-production of the baryon asymmetry. We show that the helical fields with strength down to 1e-5 of the maximal possible strength during the Electroweak epoch should have had their correlation at least ~1e-6 of the Hubble radius during this epoch. For weaker fields this lower bound on the correlation length relaxes proportionally to the square of magnetic field strength. A field with parameters saturating the bound may actually be responsible for the baryon asymmetry observed today. We show that relic of such a field, surviving in the present day Universe in the form of intergalactic magnetic field detectable with Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory, may have the strength up to 10-100 pG and can have parameters needed to affect the cosmological recombination and relax the Hubble tension. We also show that there is no constraint on the parameters of helical or non-helical magnetic fields stemming from the requirement that the baryon isocurvature perturbations produced by such fields during the Electroweak epoch are within the observational limits.
