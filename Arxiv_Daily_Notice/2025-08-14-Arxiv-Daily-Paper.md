#### Probing ALP-photon couplings in Neutron Stars: scalar versus pseudoscalar cases

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the distribution of an interacting axion-like massive field within a magnetized Neutron Star. For this we consider the effect of an intense density-dependent axially symmetric stellar magnetic field ${\bf B}(r,\theta)$ adding another much weaker, but non-vanishing, electric field. We particularize the latter for the case when a finite chiral charge density is present. The axion field is thus coupled to a generic function $Q(F_0,G_0)$ depending on Lorentz invariants $F_0, G_0$ which can be constructed from these electromagnetic fields. From this, the static axion field equations are solved as function of stellar radial coordinate and angular direction, $a(r,\theta)$, using a prescribed linear form for $Q$. In addition, we use a semi-analytical approach to calculate the stellar structure in this hybrid system where pressure components are treated under a perturbative scheme, provided induced deformations with respect to spherical symmetry are tiny. Our results show that the axion couplings to magnetic and electric fields along with its mass, critically determine the axion spatial distribution. Furthermore, we focus on the possibility that the axion field might accumulate in specific outer regions of the star, particularly within the crust, where it could form a condensate. We explore the possible presence of magnetic flux tubes from superconductor phases in this outer layers and qualitatively show they may enhance local conversion into photons. We explore prospects of detectability through indirect methods.

 - **Abstract**
 Exoplanets with and without a magnetic field are predicted to form, behave, and evolve very differently. Therefore, there is great need to directly constrain these fields to holistically understand the properties of exoplanets including their potential habitability. This goal aligns with the Astro2020 Decadal Survey recommendations. Observing planetary auroral radio emissions is among the most promising detection methods, but decades of searching have yet to yield a conclusive detection, though promising hints are now emerging from ground-based radio telescopes. However, these ground-based efforts are fundamentally limited by Earth's ionosphere, which blocks the low-frequency signals (<10 MHz) expected from terrestrial and Neptune-like exoplanets. In this white paper, we outline a strategy to overcome this barrier by utilizing the unique environment of the Moon. We discuss how the upcoming LuSEE-Night and ROLSES pathfinder missions will study our Solar System's planets as exoplanet analogs and place the first meaningful upper limits on exoplanetary radio flux below 10 MHz. Furthermore, we explore the revolutionary potential of the proposed future lunar arrays FarView and FARSIDE. For example, FarView will be sensitive enough to study the magnetic fields of a diverse set of exoplanets (super-Earths to gas giants) and an order of magnitude more Jupiter-like planets than ground-based telescopes, providing crucial tests for dynamo theory. Most significantly, FARSIDE will be able to detect the magnetospheres of nearby terrestrial exoplanets, offering a powerful synergy with atmospheric characterization efforts by JWST and HWO to fully assess their potential habitability. By opening this unexplored low-frequency window, radio astronomy from the Moon is poised to transform the field of exoplanet magnetospheric science. [Abridged]
#### Evolution of a Long-Lived Deep-Seated Main-Sequence Magnetic Field During White Dwarf Cooling

 - **Abstract**
 We study the evolution of white dwarf (WD) magnetic fields that originate from core-convective dynamos during the main-sequence. Using stellar evolution and WD cooling models combined with magnetic field diffusion calculations, we demonstrate that a surviving field from the main-sequence can account for various features observed in magnetic WDs. In particular, the earlier emergence of stronger magnetic fields in more massive WDs, compared to older, less massive, and less magnetic ones, can be explained by this framework. This is because the magnetic boundary at the onset of WD cooling lies deeper in less massive WDs, resulting in a slower and weaker evolution of the surface magnetic field due to increasing electrical conductivity over time. We further show that many of the magnetic field strengths observed across different WD samples can be reproduced if the deep-seated field generated during the main sequence is comparable to predictions from magnetohydrodynamic simulations of core-convective dynamos, or if equipartition provides a valid scaling for the main-sequence dynamo. Additionally, our predictions for surface magnetic fields vary by a factor of 2 to 4 when higher-order modes of poloidal magnetic field expansion and turbulent diffusion driven by crystallization-induced convection are included. These effects should therefore be considered when investigating the origin of magnetic fields in individual WDs.
#### Primordial planet spin driven by boundary layer effects in a decretion disc

 - **Abstract**
 Accretion of material from a protoplanetary disc on to a forming giant planet can spin the planet up to close to its breakup rate, $\Omega_{\rm b}=(G M_{\rm p}/R_{\rm p}^3)$, where $M_{\rm p}$ is the mass and $R_{\rm p}$ is the radius of the planet. After the protoplanetary disc dissipates, the rapidly rotating planet may eject a decretion (outflowing) disc in a similar way to a Be star. Boundary layer effects in a hydrodynamic disc allow for decretion disc formation at spin rates below the breakup spin rate of the planet. The decretion disc exerts a torque on the planet that slows its spin to an equilibrium value that is sensitive to the planet temperature. By considering steady state circumplanetary decretion disc solutions, we show that the equilibrium spin rate for planets is around $0.4\,\Omega_{\rm b}$ for $H/R=0.2$ and around $0.2\,\Omega_{\rm b}$ for $H/R=0.3$, where $H$ is the disc scale height at radius $R$. These values are in line with the spins of the giant planets in the solar system and observed exoplanet spins.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of a polarization study based upon relativistic magnetohydrodynamic modelling of jets running into hydrostatic, spherically symmetric cluster atmospheres. For the first time in a numerical simulation, we derive Faraday rotation measure maps (RM maps) from model cluster atmospheres based upon the universal pressure profile (UPP), incorporating a temperature profile for a 'typical' self-similar atmosphere described by only one parameter: M500. We compare our simulated polarization products with current observational data from Very Large Array (VLA) and LOw Frequency ARay (LOFAR), as well as continuing investigations from our previous work, such as the detectability of the Laing Garrington effect. We also studied the variation of mean fractional polarization with cluster mass and jet power. We produce simulated Stokes Q and U channel images and using the Rotation Measure (RM) synthesis technique we create RM maps. These data provide insight into what we should expect of current and future high-resolution polarimetric studies of active galactic nucleus (AGN) outflows as we were able to probe the limitations of the RM synthesis technique by comparing it with the RM map direct from our simulations. Highlights of our study include clear reproduction of polarization enhancements towards the edges of radio lobes for suitable conditions and a demonstration that complex lobe morphologies with multiple emission and Faraday active regions interspersed as might be expected in some pole-on or perhaps precessing sources should be distinguishable in observations with current technology. Given that the UPP is our most representative general cluster atmosphere, these numerical simulations, and the polarimetric properties derived from them, represent the most realistic yet for spherically symmetric atmospheres.

 - **Abstract**
 Detecting Population III (Pop. III) stars remains a major observational challenge. Their Balmer series recombination line emission, redshifted into the infrared at $z \sim 5-11$, is a potential tracer. JWST/NIRSpec offers the first opportunity to detect such lines, provided fluxes exceed instrumental sensitivity. This study aims to model the expected luminosities of the first four Balmer series transitions from Pop. III star-forming halos and assess their detectability with JWST/NIRSpec across $5 \leq z \leq 11$. We use the semi-analytical code A-SLOTH with merger trees constructed from the extended Press-Schechter (EPS) formalism and cosmological N-body simulations targeting Milky Way-like halos and the halo population in a 8~Mpc$/h$ box. Predicted fluxes are compared to JWST detection limits derived from the Exposure Time Calculator (ETC) assuming a 10,000 s NIRSpec exposure at a signal-to-noise ratio of 5. For our default model parameters, Pop. III H$\alpha$ fluxes peak at $\sim10^{-21}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$, 2-3 orders of magnitude below the JWST detection threshold ($\sim6 \times 10^{-19}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$). The fluxes in the other Balmer series lines are weaker than H$\alpha$ and hence are also not detectable. Among the model parameters that we explore, the ionizing photon escape fraction $f_{\mathrm{esc,III}}$ has the strongest effect on Pop. III Balmer series fluxes when changed: reducing $f_\mathrm{esc,III}$ from 0.9 to 0.1 increases the fluxes by $\gtrsim$1 order of magnitude. However, even in this case, the lines remain undetectable. Balmer series lines powered by emission from Pop. III stars will be undetectable by JWST without strong lensing ($\mu \gtrsim 10$). A-SLOTH provides a useful tool to predict emission strengths and assess the detectability of Pop. III stars across cosmic history.
#### Dynamos driven by top-heavy double-diffusive convection in the strong-field regime

 - **Abstract**
 The magnetic fields of terrestrial planets are generated in their liquid cores through dynamo action driven by thermal and compositional convection. The coexistence of these two buoyancy sources gives rise to double-diffusive convection (DDC) due to the contrast between thermal and compositional diffusivities. However, most dynamo simulations adopt the co-density model, where the two diffusivities are assumed to be equal. In this study, we performed both hydrodynamic and dynamo simulations of top-heavy DDC in a rotating spherical shell with the Lewis number $Le=100$, and compared them with corresponding co-density models. In the hydrodynamic regime, the convective flow morphology is strongly influenced by the nature of the buoyancy sources. However, our dynamo simulations in the strong-field regime demonstrate that the co-density and DDC models yield qualitatively similar magnetic fields at comparable magnetic Reynolds numbers, albeit with some differences in detail. These numerical models further justify the use of the co-density model in planetary dynamo simulations. Finally, we demonstrate that dynamo models based on DDC and co-density produce similar magnetic fields and secular variations at the core-mantle boundary. This suggests that it may not be possible to distinguish the buoyancy sources responsible for planetary dynamos based solely on magnetic field observations.
#### Stingrays in the radio sky: Two unusual diffuse radio relic sources in the direction of the Magellanic Stream

 - **Abstract**
 We present the discovery of two extended, low surface brightness radio continuum sources, each consisting of a near-circular body and an extended tail of emission, nicknamed Stingray 1 (ASKAP J0129-5350) and Stingray 2 (ASKAP J0245-5642). Both are found in the direction of the Magellanic Stream (MS) and were discovered in the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) survey at 944 MHz. We combine the ASKAP data with low-frequency radio observations from the GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky MWA Survey (GLEAM) to conduct a radio continuum analysis. We explore both Galactic/near Galactic scenarios, including runaway or circumgalactic supernova remnants (SNRs) and parentless pulsar-wind nebulae (PWNe), and extragalactic scenarios including radio active galactic nuclei (AGNs), dying radio galaxies, galaxy clusters, galaxy pairs or groups, head-tail radio galaxies, and Odd Radio Circles (ORCs), as well as the possibility that the morphology is due to a chance alignment. The Stingrays exhibit non-thermal emission with spectral indices of $\alpha$ = -0.89 $\pm$ 0.09 for Stingray 1 and $\alpha$ = -1.77 $\pm$ 0.06 for Stingray 2. We find that none of the proposed scenarios can explain all of the observed properties, however we determine it most likely that their shape is caused by some kind of complex environmental interaction. The most likely scenario from the available data is that of a head-tail radio galaxy, but more data is required for a definitive classification.
#### Thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect in the circumgalactic medium -- II: dependence on star formation

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.09514

 - **Abstract**
 We measure thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) Effect in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of $\approx$2.5 million $\rm M_{200}$=$\rm 10^{12-14}\,M_\odot$ WISE$\times$DESI galaxies out to $z$=1.2. We split the sample into quiescent (0.7 million) and star-forming (1.8 million) galaxies, exploring the relation between the thermal pressure of the CGM and star formation for the first time. We develop and implement a novel probabilistic approach to cross-correlate the galaxy catalog with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope+Planck data by taking into account the uncertainties in redshift, mass, and star formation rate. The S/N of the stacked Compton-$y$ value in the CGM varies from 4.9 to 18.5, depending on the sample size and the CGM signal strength within the relevant mass bin. We detect the CGM signal down to $\rm M_{200}=10^{12.3}\,M_\odot$, and provide stringent upper limit at $\rm M_{200}<10^{12.3}\,M_\odot$. The data fit well with the standard GNFW profile of thermal pressure and do not require a flatter or steeper profile. This suggests a significant impact of cooling and the absence of dominant feedback. In galaxies with $\rm M_{200}\approx10^{12.3-12.8}\,M_\odot$ halos, the volume filling CGM is likely the largest contributor to the $galactic$ baryons at their virial temperatures of $\sim$10$^{6-6.4}\rm\,K$. For $\rm M_{200}>10^{12.8}\,M_\odot$ halos, the most massive phase of the CGM is likely at a sub-virial temperature of $\rm\gtrsim 10^6\,K$. The thermal energy of the CGM of quiescent galaxies follows the self-similar relation with mass, but the star-forming galaxies deviate from this relation. This indicates that the impact of non-gravitational factors varies among halos of different degrees of star-forming activity.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a GPU-accelerated implementation of a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) solver using directive-based programming with OpenMP target offloading. The solver is integrated into the DISPATCH framework, which organises the computational domain into a collection of asynchronously updated patches. To reduce GPU kernel launch overhead, patches are grouped into "bunches" that are updated collectively. While porting the particular solver required a complete code refactoring, it yielded performance gains on both GPU and CPU. A stand-alone mini-app achieved a 7.3x speed-up compared to a single NVIDIA A100 GPU to seven AMD 7F72 Rome CPU cores. Within the full DISPATCH framework, the GPU-accelerated MHD Bunch solver showed excellent agreement with the CPU-based reference implementation on standard test problems such as the Sod shock tube and Orszag-Tang vortex. In large-scale 3D tests, the GPU implementation achieved a 9.8x overall speedup, comparing one GPU to 12 CPU cores, with the core MHD update routine being two orders of magnitude faster on the GPU than on a single CPU core. These results demonstrate that OpenMP offloading can provide substantial performance improvements for astrophysical codes while maintaining portability and accuracy. The work also demonstrates how new codes should be structured to allow simple and efficient directive-based GPU offloading.
#### Linking planet formation to exoplanet characteristics: C/O as a diagnostic of planet formation

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09587

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.09587

 - **Abstract**
 Gas-giant exoplanets are test cases for theories of planet formation as their atmospheres are proposed to carry signatures of their formation within the protoplanetary disk. The metallicity and C/O are key diagnostics, allowing to distinguish formation location within the disk (e.g., relative to snowlines), and mechanism (e.g., core accretion versus gravitational instability). We can now probe the composition of the planet-forming regions of disks, and that in gas-giant exoplanets, to scrutinise these theories and diagnostics. So far, ALMA has revealed that the outer disk regions are typically metal-depleted and O-poor, whereas JWST is showing that the inner disk regions around Sun-like stars are mostly O-rich. Further, JWST is showing that most transiting gas-giant planets are typically metal-enriched and O-rich, consistent with formation at/within the water snowline and pollution by icy bodies. There is emerging an arguably "conventional" picture of gas-giant planet formation for transiting planets, to be confirmed, of course, with future data.
#### A dual AGN at z = 5.4 associated with a Lyman-alpha Nebula in the Center of a Cosmic Filament

 - **Abstract**
 Predictions from current theories and simulations suggest that dual AGN systems are exceedingly rare at high redshifts. The intense radiation and powerful outflows from AGNs regulate star formation, heat the interstellar medium, and drive massive gas outflows that shape the host galaxy and its surroundings. One manifestation of AGN feedback is the creation of extended Ly$\alpha$ nebulae. However, identifying these systems at high-$z$ is challenging. Here, we report a remarkable dual AGN candidate at $z \sim 5.4$ using JWST NIRCam and NIRSpec, with a separation of $\sim1.7$ arcseconds ($\sim10.4$ pkpc). This is one of the highest spectroscopically confirmed redshift dual AGNs discovered. Photometric SED fitting shows excellent agreement with AGN templates, strongly suggesting a rare dual AGN system. BPT diagrams and high ionisation lines further support the presence of AGNs. VLT/MUSE observations reveal strong extended Ly$\alpha$ emission, extending to $>22$ kpc, making it one of the most extended Ly$\alpha$ nebulae at $z \sim 6$. This provides observational evidence of anisotropic AGN-driven photoionization or shocks. The high Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction also indicates an AGN outflow. This dual AGN candidate is also associated with a well-defined overdensity, potentially at the center of a $z \sim 5.4$ protocluster or filamentary structure node. Further analysis indicates the fraction of dual AGNs is significantly higher than theoretically expected at high redshifts. This discovery provides a new opportunity to study dual AGN interactions and their impact on the circumgalactic medium and cosmic structure evolution.
#### Powerful Radio Sources as Probes of Black Hole Physics

 - **Abstract**
 Powerful jetted radio sources for which the luminosity in directed kinetic energy has been empirically determined, independent of assumptions, are considered. The total outflow lifetime of each source determined in the context of detailed cosmological studies was found to depend only upon the luminosity in directed kinetic energy ($L$). The distributions of $L$, total outflow lifetime, and total outflow energy each have a broad range of values, as do the supermassive black hole masses. The total outflow energy relative to the black hole mass is a small number with a small dispersion. Three explanations of these remarkable results are considered. This could indicate (1) the efficiencies with which black hole irreducible mass is increased and spin mass energy is extracted during the outflow event, (2) that the merger of two supermassive black holes occurs over a timescale commensurate with the independently determined outflow lifetime and that these mergers lead to the production of the low-frequency gravitational wave background, or (3) that feedback shuts off black hole accretion due to energy injected into the ambient medium.
#### Tight correlation of star formation with [Ci] and CO lines across cosmic time

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Cold molecular gas tracers, such as CI and CO lines, have been widely used to infer specific characteristics of the ISM and to derive star-formation relations among galaxies. Aims. However, there is still a lack of systematic studies of the star-formation scaling relation of CO and [CI] lines across cosmic time on multiple physical scales. Methods. We used observations of the ground state transitions of [CI], CO, and [CII], for 885 sources collected from the literature, to infer possible correlations between line luminosities of $\rm L^{'}_{[CI](1-0)}, \rm L^{'}_{CO(1-0)}$, and $\rm L^{'}_{[CII]}$ with star formation rates (SFR). With linear regression, we fit the relations between SFR and molecular mass derived from CO, CI, and CII lines. Results. The relation between [CI] and CO-based total molecular masses is weakly superlinear. Nevertheless, they can be calibrated against each other. For $\rm \alpha_{CO} = 0.8$ and $4.0\ \rm {M}_{\odot}\,({K}\,{km}\,{s}^{-1}\,{pc}^2)^{-1}$ we derive $\alpha_{\rm [CI]} = 3.9$ and $\sim$$17\ \rm {M}_{\odot}\,({K}\,{km}\,{s}^{-1}\,{pc}^2)^{-1}$ , respectively. Using the \emph{lmfit} package, we derived relation slopes of SFR--$\rm L^{'}_{[CI](1-0)}$, SFR--$\rm L^{'}_{CO(1-0)}$, and SFR--$\rm L^{'}_{[CII](1-0)}$ to be $\rm \beta$ = 1.06 $\pm$ 0.02, 1.24 $\pm$ 0.02, and 0.74 $\pm$ 0.02, respectively. With a Bayesian-inference \emph{linmix} method, we find consistent results. Conclusions. Our relations for [CI](1-0) and CO(1-0) indicate that they trace similar molecular gas contents, across different redshifts and different types of galaxies. This suggests that these correlations do not have strong evolution with cosmic time.
