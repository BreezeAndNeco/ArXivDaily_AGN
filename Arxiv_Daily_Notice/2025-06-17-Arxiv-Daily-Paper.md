 - **Abstract**
 The spin of a black hole (BH) encodes information about its formation and evolution history. Yet the understanding of the distribution of BH spins in X-ray binaries (XBs), of the models used to measure spin, and of their impact on systematic uncertainties remains incomplete. In this work, we expand on previous analyses of the entire NuSTAR archive of accreting BH XBs. Prior work compiled a sample of 245 spectral fits using the relativistic reflection method for NuSTAR observations of 36 BH systems. Here, we aim to probe two aspects: the connection between BH spin and binary system properties, and the relationship between parameters in spectral fits. We identify moderate negative correlations between spin uncertainty and both BH mass and system inclination, and a moderate positive correlation with distance. We also point out tentative multi-dimensional degeneracies between inclination, disk density, Fe abundance, ionization, and the presence or absence of absorption features from ionized outflows linked to disk winds. Lastly, we provide a comprehensive view of the observed distribution of BH spins in XBs, in comparison to spins inferred from gravitational waves. We find that the distribution of BH spins in XBs can be described by a Beta distribution with $\alpha=5.66$ and $\beta=1.09$. This data set is highly complex, and the analysis presented here does not fully explore all potential parameter correlations. We make the full data set available to the community to encourage further exploration.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an extension of the pop-cosmos model for the evolving galaxy population up to redshift $z\sim6$. The model is trained on distributions of observed colors and magnitudes, from 26-band photometry of $\sim420,000$ galaxies in the COSMOS2020 catalog with Spitzer IRAC $\textit{Ch. 1}<26$. The generative model includes a flexible distribution over 16 stellar population synthesis (SPS) parameters, and a depth-dependent photometric uncertainty model, both represented using score-based diffusion models. We use the trained model to predict scaling relationships for the galaxy population, such as the stellar mass function, star-forming main sequence, and gas-phase and stellar metallicity vs. mass relations, demonstrating reasonable-to-excellent agreement with previously published results. We explore the connection between mid-infrared emission from active galactic nuclei (AGN) and star-formation rate, finding high AGN activity for galaxies above the star-forming main sequence at $1\lesssim z\lesssim 2$. Using the trained population model as a prior distribution, we perform inference of the redshifts and SPS parameters for 429,669 COSMOS2020 galaxies, including 39,588 with publicly available spectroscopic redshifts. The resulting redshift estimates exhibit minimal bias ($\text{median}[\Delta_z]=-8\times10^{-4}$), scatter ($\sigma_\text{MAD}=0.0132$), and outlier fraction ($6.19\%$) for the full $0<z<6$ spectroscopic compilation. These results establish that pop-cosmos can achieve the accuracy and realism needed to forward-model modern wide--deep surveys for Stage IV cosmology. We publicly release pop-cosmos software, mock galaxy catalogs, and COSMOS2020 redshift and SPS parameter posteriors.

 - **Abstract**
 Uncovering bright quasars' host galaxies at cosmic noon is challenging because of the high contrast between the quasar and its host and redshifted light, making them primarily visible in the infrared. We present JWST NIRSpec integral field unit (IFU) observations of six extremely red quasars (ERQs) at $z=2.4-2.9$ and two dust-obscured quasars at lower redshifts. Using image decomposition across the spectral range, we successfully separate quasar and host galaxy continuum emission, model host morphologies, and extract spectra. The ERQs and obscured quasars have compact host galaxies with half-light radii of 1.4$-$2.9 kpc and stellar masses of 10$^{10.6-10.9}$ $M_{\odot}$. Their stellar masses are consistent with the average stellar mass of quasar hosts as expected from abundance matching and clustering analysis. Most of the quasars in our sample exhibit significant spatial offsets (0.4$-$1.3 kpc) between the quasar and host galaxy, potentially caused by post-merger dynamics or non-uniform dust obscuration. The ERQs reside 0.5$-$2 dex above the local black hole-stellar mass relation, similar to other heavily obscured populations such as HotDOGs, optically selected quasars at cosmic noon, and high-redshift SMBH candidates identified with JWST. However, this "over-massive" feature might be attributed to selection bias. Compared to HST-based studies, our JWST measurements reveal more compact host galaxies, smaller Sersic indices, and lower stellar masses, likely because of improved resolution, more accurate modeling, and minimal line contamination. These findings highlight the unique capabilities of JWST IFU in revealing quasar host galaxy properties and potential evolutionary stages of obscured quasars at cosmic noon.
#### The optical constants and grain sizes of interstellar dust measured directly using the dust scattered x-ray halo of GRB 221009A

 - **Abstract**
 X-ray scattering is a powerful probe of the optical constants and grain size distribution of interstellar dust. Bright, transient sources are excellent tools for this, since they fade rapidly, leaving only the expanding scattered x-ray halo. Here, we analyse the dust-scattered x-ray halo data of the unprecedentedly bright $\gamma$-ray burst, GRB 221009A, using anomalous diffraction theory to measure the grain size distribution of dust in the Galaxy as well as the complex refractive index, $m$, and use these results to infer the likely composition. We find a complex refractive index, $m=n+ik$ at several x-ray energies, finding $k_{1\,\mathrm{keV}}= (2.7 \pm 0.7)\times10^{-4}$ and $1-n_{1\,\mathrm{keV}}= (9 \pm 2)\times 10^{-4}$, strongly inconsistent with the commonly employed assumptions of the Rayleigh-Gans approximation. These results lie in the expected range for interstellar dust compositions dominated by carbon, magnesium silicates, and iron. The absorption results suggest a substantial mass fraction of iron at $35\pm7\%$. The MRN distribution fit returns a maximum grain radius, $a_{\rm max}=0.24\pm 0.01\,\mu$m; all fits strongly rule out models with $\sim0.4\,\mu$m grains for this sightline. The soft x-ray spectrum of the prompt GRB can also be inferred from the fitting, with the best-fit providing a spectral slope that is consistent with the slope of the low energy side of the best-fit Band model of the directly measured prompt emission. Forcing a different grain size or composition than the best fit results in an inferred prompt spectrum different to the observed prompt emission. The refractive index is consistent with standard average dust compositions, showing that x-ray scattering is an effective tool to measure interstellar dust optical properties. [abridged]

 - **Abstract**
 The gas-phase metallicity gradients of galaxies have been extensively studied over the past four decades both in the local and high-redshift universe, as they trace the baryon cycle and growth of galaxies. With the unprecedented spatial resolution and sensitivity of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), it is now possible to measure metallicity and its radial gradients out to redshifts as high as $z = 9$. Here, we present a sample of 456 spectroscopically confirmed galaxies from redshifts $1.5 \lesssim z \lesssim 9$ that are spatially resolved on sub-kiloparsec (kpc) scales by deep JWST NIRCam or NIRISS Wide Field Slitless Spectroscopy (WFSS). Synthesizing these new JWST observations with legacy observations from the literature, we observe that at redshift $z > 5$, galaxy centers are more metal-rich, exhibiting negative metallicity gradients of $\sim-0.4$ dex kpc$^{-1}$. These gradients flatten over time, reaching near-zero around $z \approx 2$, coinciding with the peak of the cosmic star formation rate. Beyond this point, the gradients become negative again at lower redshifts approaching $z=0$. This evolution likely reflects transitions in galaxy formation modes: an inside-out growth phase dominated by intense central star formation with inefficient feedback and limited gas mixing during ``cosmic dawn", enhanced gas mixing due to feedback-driven wind and gas accretion at ``cosmic noon", and a later phase of slow evolution and reduced feedback toward the present day. These physical processes including gas accretion and feedback not only regulate star and galaxy formation on cosmic scale, but also shape the evolutionary pathways of individual galaxies over cosmic time.

 - **Abstract**
 JWST has enabled a new era of understanding high-z galaxy and black hole evolution with more than 30 high-z quasar host galaxy detections. Many of these observations imply galaxies with black holes that are overmassive compared to their low-z counterparts. However, the bright quasar point source removal may cause significant biases in these stellar mass measurements. We develop a simulation-based inference method to disentangle the quasar host galaxy stellar mass measurements from observational biases during the point source removal. We use the BlueTides simulation to generate mock images and perform point source removal on thousands of simulated high-z quasar host galaxies, constructing corrected host magnitude posteriors. We find that JWST photometry tends to either correctly recover or modestly misestimate host magnitudes, with a maximum magnitude underestimate of 0.21 mag. With our corrected magnitude posteriors, we perform SED fitting on each quasar host galaxy and compare the stellar mass measurement before and after the correction. We find that stellar mass estimates are generally robust, or overestimated by $\leq0.3$ dex. We also find that the stellar masses of a subset of hosts (J1120+0641, J0844-0132, J0911+0152, and J1146-0005) remain unconstrained, as key photometric bands provide only flux upper limits. Understanding these biases is essential to uncovering the evolutionary pathways of high-z quasars with their hosts.

 - **Abstract**
 We present 90 GHz continuum imaging of 119 star-forming regions in 30 nearby galaxies observed with MUSTANG-2 on the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope as part of the Star Formation in Radio Survey. The 90 GHz data were combined with 3, 15, and 33 GHz data taken previously by the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array to decompose radio spectra on $\approx$0.8 kpc scales into their synchrotron, free-free, and thermal dust emission components. This was done using three scenarios: (i) a power law fit from 3 to 33 GHz, (ii) Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) fitting from 3 to 90 GHz with a thermal dust component, and (iii) MCMC fitting from 3 to 33 GHz without a thermal dust component. For these cases, we find a median thermal (free-free) emission fraction at 33 GHz of (i) $88 \pm 2$% with a scatter of 17%, (ii) $76\pm 3$% with a scatter of 25%, and (iii) $84\pm 2$% with a scatter of 18%. From this we conclude that, on average, free-free, not thermal dust, remains the dominant emission component at 33 GHz. While scenario (ii) yields a thermal fraction that is $\approx$10% larger than scenario (iii), this difference decreases to $\approx$5% after AGN are removed. Consequently, star formation rates measured with thermal fractions at 33 GHz are only mildly biased high without 90 GHz data for the spectral decomposition. Furthermore, a power law fit of data from 3 to 33 GHz still provides a reliable estimate of the free-free emission at 33 GHz.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of a little red dot (LRD), dubbed BiRD ('big red dot'), at $z=2.33$ in the field around the $z=6.3$ quasar SDSSJ1030+0524. Using NIRCam images, we identified it as a bright outlier in the $F200W-F356W$ color vs $F356W$ magnitude diagram of point sources in the field. The NIRCam/WFSS spectrum reveals the emission from HeI$\lambda 10830$ and PaG line, both showing a narrow and a broad ($FWHM\gtrsim 2000\ \rm kms^{-1}$) component. The HeI line is affected by an absorption feature, tracing dense gas with HeI column density in the $2^3S$ level $N\sim 0.5-1.2\times 10^{14}\rm cm^{-2}$, depending on the location of the absorber, which is outflowing at the speed of $\Delta v \sim -830\ \rm kms^{-1}$. As observed in the majority of LRDs, BiRD does not show X-ray or radio emission. The BH mass and the bolometric luminosity, both inferred from the PaG broad component, amount to $M_{\rm BH}\sim 10^8\rm M_{\odot}$ and $L_{\rm bol}\sim 2.9\times 10^{45}\rm ergs^{-1}$, respectively. Intriguingly, BiRD presents strict analogies with other two LRDs spectroscopically confirmed at cosmic noon, GN-28074 ("Rosetta Stone") at $z=2.26$ and RUBIES-BLAGN-1 at $z=3.1$. The blueshifted HeI absorption detected in all three sources suggests that gas outflows may be common in LRDs. We derive a first estimate of the space density of LRDs at $z<3$ based on JWST data, as a function of $L_{\rm bol}$ and BH mass. The space density is only a factor of $\sim 2-3$ lower than that of UV-selected quasars with comparable $L_{\rm bol}$ and $z$, meaning that the contribution of LRDs to the broader AGN population is also relevant at cosmic noon. A similar trend is also observed in terms of BH masses. If, as suggested by recent theories, LRDs probe the very first and rapid growth of black hole seeds, our finding may suggest that the formation of black hole seeds remains efficient at least up to cosmic noon.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy clusters host a hot, diffuse plasma with poorly understood viscosity and magnetic field amplification. Astrophysical plasmas are often modeled with magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), but low collision rates in environments like the intracluster medium (ICM) hinder thermodynamic equilibrium, causing pressure anisotropies and high viscosity. High-$\beta$ plasmas, dominated by thermal pressure, are prone to instabilities (e.g., firehose, mirror) that limit anisotropy, reduce viscosity, and enable small-scale dynamo-driven magnetic amplification. This study examines viscosity evolution in the ICM during turbulent magnetic field amplification. We performed 3D MHD simulations of forced turbulence with an initially weak, uniform magnetic field. Using the CGL-MHD framework, we incorporate anisotropic pressure dynamics and instability-driven anisotropy limitation. We analyze effective viscosity and dynamo evolution, comparing results with Braginskii-MHD and uniform-viscosity MHD. Results show viscosity decreases over time, allowing magnetic field amplification to saturation levels similar to non-viscous MHD. Viscosity distribution becomes bimodal, reflecting (i) collisional values and (ii) turbulence-dominated values proportional to $10^{-4} L_{\rm turb} U_{\rm turb}$ in unstable regions. At saturation, 60% of plasma retains collisional viscosity. Braginskii-MHD reproduces similar magnetic amplification and viscosity structures. However, uniform-viscosity MHD, where viscosity equals the mean saturated CGL-MHD value, fails to capture the turbulence inertial range. These findings highlight the need for anisotropic viscosity models in studying ICM processes like magnetic topology, cosmic ray transport, and AGN-driven shocks. Moreover, our CGL-MHD and Braginskii-MHD models match the Coma cluster density fluctuation spectrum, reinforcing its weakly collisional nature.

 We present an analysis of the polarization of three black widow pulsars, PSRs B1957+20, J2055+3829 and J1544+4937 at 1250\,MHz using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). Radio eclipses for PSRs B1957+20 and J2055+3829 are detected, while the radio emission for J1544+4937 is detected throughout the eclipse. We study the polarization and dispersion measure properties of the pulsars near and during the eclipse. The position angle of the linear polarization is observed to shift at the eclipse boundary in all of these three pulsars implying a lower limit line-of-sight magnetic field strength of the eclipse medium of approximately a few mG to tens of mG. We also find evidence that the magnetic field in the eclipse medium of PSRs B1957+20 and J1544+4937 reverses.

 - **Abstract**
 In the standard model of solar eruptive events, coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and flares are associated with each other through magnetic reconnection initiated by erupting flux ropes. Observations also reveal an increasing association ratio between flares and CMEs with flare intensity. However, the fundamental relationship between flares and CMEs, and that between thermal and nonthermal processes, remains unknown. Here we investigate energetic C-class flares (ECFs) -- Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) C-class flares with hard X-ray (HXR) emissions above 30 keV -- using observations from Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory/Hard X-ray Imager (HXI), Solar Dynamic Observatory, and GOES. Among 1331 C-class flares detected by HXI, 127 ECFs (9.5%) were identified for statistical analysis of their properties and associations with CMEs and other flare-related features. Our statistical results reveal that ECFs have relatively shorter durations and harder spectra (the mean electron power-law index is 4.65), with no significant correlation between soft X-ray flux and nonthermal parameters (e.g., HXR peak flux). Among the 127 events, 53 (42%) were associated with type III bursts, 38 (30%) with jets, at least 13 (~11%) with 360 nm brightenings, and only 5 (~4%) with CMEs. Crucially, all five CME events were narrow CMEs associated with jets. The surprising correlation between these ECFs and CMEs suggests that noneruptive or confined magnetic field configurations in these flares may favor electron acceleration, resulting in harder X-ray this http URL discuss the potential formation mechanisms and efficient electron acceleration processes in these atypical flares, providing valuable insights into nonstandard flare behavior.

 - **Abstract**
 A numerical framework to calculate the height and potential of the vacuum inner gap is proposed here. The results show that small mountains on a pulsar's polar cap tend to significantly influence the properties of the inner vacuum gap, making it easier for sparks to form. In this scenario, the magnetospheric activity observed from the pulsars PSR J0250$+$5854 and PSR J2144$-$3933, which lie below the pulsar death line, would be reproduced, and the irregular discharge behaviour in other polar cap regions could also be understood. Furthermore, the presence of small mountains could provide a new way to probe the puzzling state of supranuclear matter inside pulsars. In order to have stable mountains on the surface, pulsars might be made of solid strangeon matter, which is favoured by both the charge neutrality and the flavour symmetry of quarks.
#### The peculiar hard state behaviour of the black hole X-ray binary Swift J1727.8$-$1613

 - **Abstract**
 Tracking the correlation between radio and X-ray luminosities during black hole X-ray binary outbursts is a key diagnostic of the coupling between accretion inflows (traced by X-rays) and relativistic jet outflows (traced by radio). We present the radio--X-ray correlation of the black hole low-mass X-ray binary Swift~J1727.8$-$1613 during its 2023--2024 outburst. Our observations span a broad dynamic range, covering $\sim$4 orders of magnitude in radio luminosity and $\sim$6.5 in X-ray luminosity. This source follows an unusually radio-quiet track, exhibiting significantly lower radio luminosities at a given X-ray luminosity than both the standard (radio-loud) track and most previously known radio-quiet systems. Across most of the considered distance range ($D {\sim} 1.5--4.3$ kpc), Swift~J1727.8$-$1613 appears to be the most radio-quiet black hole binary identified to date. For distances ${\geq} 4$ kpc, while Swift~J1727.8$-$1613 becomes comparable to one other extremely radio-quiet system, its peak X-ray luminosity (${\gtrsim} 5{\times}10^{38}$ erg/s) exceeds that of any previously reported hard-state black hole low-mass X-ray binary, emphasising the extremity of this outburst. Additionally, for the first time in a radio-quiet system, we identify the onset of X-ray spectral softening to coincide with a change in trajectory through the radio--X-ray plane. We assess several proposed explanations for radio-quiet behaviour in black hole systems in light of this dataset. As with other such sources, however, no single mechanism fully accounts for the observed properties, highlighting the importance of regular monitoring and the value of comprehensive (quasi-)simultaneous datasets.

 - **Abstract**
 The data from the FAST and MeerKAT surveys has significantly increased the number of radio pulsars for which the polarization characteristics of their mean profiles have been determined in detail. This has allowed us to confirm earlier conclusions both about the nature of propagation of two orthogonal modes in the pulsar magnetospheres and about the mechanism of particle production in neutron star polar regions and their evolutionary features. We can now say with even greater confidence that mean profiles formed by the O-mode are significantly wider than those formed by the X-mode. Moreover, the observations confirm the validity of the classical Ruderman-Sutherland vacuum model of particle generation, as well as the evolution of the inclination angles of the magnetic axis to the rotation one in the direction of $90^{\circ}$.

 - **Abstract**
 A recent study on the dynamics of the quasi-stationary component (QSC) in the jet of BL~ Lacertae highlighted its significance in evaluating the physical properties of relativistic transverse waves in the parsec-scale jet. Motivated by this finding, we selected a different type of blazar, the flat-spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) 3C~279, which hosts a QSC at an angular median distance of 0.35~mas from the radio core, as revealed by 27 years of VLBA monitoring data at 15~GHz. We investigate the positional scatter and dynamics of a QSC in the 3C~279 jet, aiming to detect the presence of a relativistic transverse wave and estimate its characteristics. We employ an analytical statistical method to estimate the mean intrinsic speed of the QSC, while moving average and refinement methods are used to smooth its trajectory. Analysis of the QSC position scatter shows that the jet axis change its direction by about $21\degr$ over 27 years and jet mean intrinsic full opening angle is $\approx 0.30\degr \pm 0.03\degr$. The apparent displacement vectors of the QSC exhibit strong asymmetry and anisotropy along the jet direction, indicating pronounced anisotropic displacements of the core along the jet axis. We estimated the mean intrinsic speed of the QSC to be superluminal, $\overline{\beta_{\rm s}} \approx 15$ in units of the speed of light, which, within the framework of the seagull-on-wave model, is interpreted as evidence for a relativistic transverse wave propagating through the QSC. Analysis of the reversing trajectory of the QSC enables the classification and characterization of reversal patterns, which, in turn, allows the determination of key transverse wave parameters such as frequency, amplitude, inclination angle, and magnetic energy of the wave (abbrev.).

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of repeating Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) is an open question, with observations suggesting that at least some are associated with old stellar populations. It has been proposed that some repeating FRBs may be produced by interactions of the binary neutron star magnetospheres decades to centuries before the coalescence. These systems would also emit centi-Hertz gravitational waves during this period, which can be detectable by space-borne gravitational wave detectors. We explore the prospects of using current and future space-borne gravitational wave detectors, such as TianQin, LISA, and DECIGO, to test this FRB formation hypothesis. Focusing on nearby galaxies like M81, which hosts a repeating FRB source in a globular cluster, we calculate the detection capabilities for binary neutron star systems. Our analysis reveals that while missions like TianQin and LISA face limitations in horizon distance, changing detector pointing direction could significantly enhance detection probabilities. Considering the chance of a Milky Way-like galaxy coincidentally containing a BNS within 100 years before merger is only $3\times10^{-5}$ to $5\times10^{-3}$, if a signal is detected originating from M81, we can establish the link between FRB and binary neutron stars with a significance level of at least 2.81$\sigma$, or a Bayes factor of $4\times10^6 - 7\times10^8$ / $5\times10^2 - 10^5$ against the background model with optimistic/realistic assumptions. Next-generation detectors such as DECIGO offer enhanced capabilities and should easily detect these systems in M81 and beyond. Our work highlights the critical role of space-borne gravitational wave missions in unraveling FRB origins.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations presented in Cendes et al. (2024a) show that optically selected tidal disruption events (TDEs) commonly produce delayed radio emission that can peak years post-disruption. Here, we explore the multi-wavelength properties of a sample of radio-observed optically selected TDEs to shed light on the physical process(es) responsible for the late-rising radio emission. We combine new late-time X-ray observations with archival optical, UV, X-ray, and radio data to conclude that a diversity of accretion-driven outflows may power delayed radio emission in TDEs. Simultaneous X-ray data and modeling of the UV/optical emission suggest that some late radio outflows may be launched by a delayed phase of super-Eddington accretion onto the central supermassive black hole (SMBH), while others may result from a state transition to a "low-hard" radiatively inefficient accretion flow or the deceleration of an off-axis relativistic jet. We additionally find weak statistical evidence that TDEs with delayed radio emission have larger optical/UV photospheric radii than other TDEs and are less likely to exhibit helium emission lines at early times, possibly also supporting the hypothesis that the onset of SMBH accretion is delayed in these systems. Our results have implications for our understanding of state changes in SMBH accretion flows, the circularization timescale for TDE debris, and the prevalence of off-axis jets in TDEs, and motivates systematic, long-term monitoring of these unique transients. The brightest objects in our sample are also detected in the VLA Sky Survey (VLASS), demonstrating that all-sky radio surveys can play an important role in discovering unexpected radio properties of the TDE population.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we test the cosmic distance duality relation (CDDR), as required by the Etherington reciprocity theorem, which connects the angular diameter distance and the luminosity distance via the relation \( D_{\rm L}(z) = D_{\rm A}(z)(1+z)^2 \). Our analysis is based on the latest baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements provided by the Dark Energy Survey (DES), the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS)/Extended BOSS (eBOSS), and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) surveys. Specifically, an unbiased test of the CDDR is performed through a novel, model-independent method inspired by the two-point diagnostic approach, with DES-SN5YR and Pantheon type Ia supernova (SN Ia) sample reconstructed using the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) technique. This methodology effectively eliminates all nuisance parameters, including the sound horizon scale \( r_{\rm d} \) from BAO and the absolute magnitude \( M_{\rm B} \) from SN Ia. A set of \( N-1 \) independent CDDR ratios \( \eta_{ij} \) are constructed for statistical analysis. At the current observational level, no significant deviation from the CDDR is observed at low redshifts, whereas we find positive evidence ($>2\sigma$ C.L.) of deviation from the CDDR at two high redshifts ($z=2.33$ and $z=2.334$). Therefore, our results confirm that the BAO measurement provides a powerful tool to test such fundamental relation in modern cosmology.
#### Search for very-high-energy photon clusters and transients outside the galactic plane in the Fermi-LAT data

 - **Abstract**
 We present a search for spatio-temporal clusters in 16 years of Fermi-LAT very high-energy (VHE; $E>100$ GeV) data using the DBSCAN algorithm, focusing on high Galactic latitude ($|b|>10^{\circ}$) clusters with $\geq5$ events and transient doublets (two events within $\leq 3$ days). Of 107 detected clusters, two correspond to previously unidentified VHE sources: weak BL Lacertae objects 4FGL J0039.1-2219 and 4FGL J0212.2-0219, promising targets for next-generation VHE observatories. Due to low VHE photon background, even doublets with a duration of several days exhibited high statistical significance. While most of the 114 detected doublets originated from bright TeV emitters (e.g., Mrk 421, Mrk 501), we identified six VHE flares lacking TeVCat associations. Five of these flares correlate with sources from the Third Catalog of Fermi-LAT High-Energy Sources (3FHL), while one 'orphan' flare lacks a high-energy (HE; $E > 10$ GeV) source counterpart. Some of these flares reached extreme luminosities of $\mathcal{O}(10^{47} \mathrm{erg~s^{-1}})$. No consistent temporal correlation emerged between HE and VHE activity: HE flares preceded, coincided with, or followed VHE emission across sources, with some showing no HE counterpart. Remarkably, 3FHL J0308.4+0408 (NGC 1218) is a Seyfert Type I galaxy, while no object of this class was known VHE emitter before. The 'orphan' flare without any known HE source in the vicinity may originate from NGC 5549, a low-luminosity LINER galaxy. Both sources expand the limited sample of non-blazar AGN detected at VHE energies.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent hydrodynamical simulations of isolated barred disc galaxies have suggested a structural change in the distribution of the interstellar medium (ISM) around a stellar mass M$_{*}$ of $10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$. In the higher-mass regime (M$_{*} \geq 10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$), we observe the formation of a central gas and stellar disc with a typical size of a few hundred parsecs connected through lanes to the ends of the stellar bar. In the lower-mass regime (M$_{*} < 10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$), such an inner disc is absent and the gas component exhibits a more chaotic distribution. Observations of nearby star-forming galaxies support the existence of such a change. These inner gas discs may represent an important intermediate scale connecting the large kiloparsec-scale structures with the nuclear (sub-parsec) region, transporting gas inwards to fuel the central supermassive black hole (SMBH). For this work, we used an extended set of high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations of isolated disc galaxies with initial properties (i.e. stellar mass, gas fraction, stellar disc scale length, and the bulge mass fraction) with properties covering the range of galaxies in the PHANGS sample to investigate this change of regime. We studied the physical properties of the star-forming ISM in both stellar mass regimes and extracted a few physical tracers: the inner Lindblad resonance (ILR), the probability distribution function (PDF), the virial parameter, and the Mach number. In line with observations, we confirm a structure transition in the simulations that occurs between a stellar mass of $10^{9.5}$ and $10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$. We show that the physical origin of this change of regime is driven by stellar feedback and its contribution relative to the underlying gravitational potential.

 - **Abstract**
 The stellar initial mass function (IMF) is one of the most important astrophysical distribution function, and is defined as the mass distribution for stars formed in a single star-formation event and when they just enter the main-sequence stage. The measurement of IMF is challenging even in the solar neighbourhood where IMF can be extracted by star-counting. This is because the definition of the IMF should be handled cautiously, and there are multiple corrections should be made from observation to a well-founded measurement. We present a new parametrisation of the stellar IMF in the 100-pc solar neighbourhood, leveraging the astrometric and photometric data from \textsl{Gaia} DR3: we model the colour-magnitude diagram of the field star population while accounting for observational uncertainties, Malmquist bias, Lutz-Kelker bias, the effect of varying mass-luminosity relation caused by mixture of different metallicity, and the effect of unresolved binaries. In particular, we synthesise the binaries with a process imitating the dynamical evolution observed in star clusters to model their present-day mass-ratio distribution. We derive a stellar IMF consistent with canonical IMFs but with significantly reduced uncertainties: $\alpha_1=0.81^{+0.06}_{-0.05}$, $\alpha_2=2.12^{+0.04}_{-0.04}$, and a break point at $m_{\mathrm{break}}=0.41^{+0.01}_{-0.01}$ $\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$. Our model also constrains the binary fraction to $\sim$25\% and the \textsl{Gaia} DR3 angular resolution to $1.31^{+0.24}_{-0.29}$ arcsec. We also provide the $\xi$-parameter for our IMF to be $0.5075_{-0.0051}^{+0.0112}$ for the users to compare our result with other work.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, the non-potential magnetic field parameters of active region NOAA 9077 are investigated; this AR experienced a super-strong X5.7 solar flare. Using advanced extrapolation techniques, the 3D magnetic field structure from vector magnetograms is obtained from the Solar Magnetic Field Telescope (SMFT) at Huairou Solar Observing Station (HSOS). Then various non-potential parameters are calculated, including current density, shear angle, quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs), twist, and field line helicity. By analyzing the spatial and temporal distributions of these parameters, we aim to shed light on the relationship between magnetic field properties and solar flare occurrence. Our findings reveal that high twist and complex magnetic field configurations are prevalent before flares, while these features tend to weaken after the eruption. Additionally, we observe decreases in helicity and free energy after the flare, while the free energy peaks approximately 1.5 days prior to the onset of the flare. Furthermore, we investigate the distribution of quasi-separatrix layers and twist, finding high degrees of complexity before flares. Multiple patterns of high current density regions suggest unstable magnetic structures prone to flaring, coinciding with shear angle distribution. Relative field line helicity patterns exhibit distinct characteristics compared to current density, concentrating before flares and diverging afterward. Overall, our results highlight the contrasting nature of current density and relative field line helicity patterns in relation to solar flares, in addition to the aforementioned feature in the set of commonly derived non-potential parameters for this particular event.

 - **Abstract**
 We used laser ablation to fabricate sub-wavelength structure anti-reflection coating (SWS-ARC) on a 5 cm diameter alumina lens. With an aspect ratio of 2.5, the SWS-ARC are designed to give a broad-band low reflectance response between 110 and 290 GHz. SWS shape measurements conducted on both sides of the lens give 303 $\mu$m pitch and total height between 750 and 790 $\mu$m, matching or exceeding the aspect ratio design values. Millimeter-wave transmittance measurements in a band between 140 and 260 GHz show the increase in transmittance expected with the ARC when compared to finite element analysis electromagnetic simulations. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of SWS-ARC on an alumina lens, opening the path for implementing the technique for larger diameter lenses.
#### Acceleration and Collimation of the Two-Sided Jets in the Nearby Low-luminosity Active Galactic Nucleus NGC 4261 (3C 270)

 - **Abstract**
 We study the acceleration and collimation of the two-sided jets in the nearby low-luminosity active galactic nucleus NGC 4261 (3C 270) using archival multifrequency, multi-epoch Very Long Baseline Array data. By applying multiple analysis methods and incorporating results from the literature, we robustly identify a parabolic-to-conical structural transition in both the jet and counterjet, with the transition occurring at $(1.23\pm0.24)\,$pc or $(8.1\pm1.6)\times10^3\,R_{\rm s}$ (Schwarzschild radii) for the jet and $(0.97\pm0.29)\,$pc or $(6.4\pm1.9)\times10^3\,R_{\rm s}$ for the counterjet. Assuming that the brightness asymmetry between the twin jets is primarily due to relativistic Doppler (de)boosting, we derive the jet velocity field at distances of $\sim (10^3-2\times10^4)\,R_{\rm s}$ based on the jet-to-counterjet brightness ratio and spectral index. Although local kinematic variations are present, the jet shows an overall acceleration to relativistic speeds from $\sim 10^3$ to $\sim8\times10^3\,R_{\rm s}$, with a maximum Lorentz factor of $\Gamma_{\rm max} \approx 2.6$. Beyond this region, the jet gradually decelerates to sub-relativistic speeds. These results support the existence of a (sub)parsec-scale ($\lesssim 1.5\,$pc) acceleration and collimation zone (ACZ) in NGC 4261, where the jet is accelerated via magnetic-to-kinetic energy conversion while being confined by external pressure. A brief comparison with M 87 suggests that the ACZ in NGC 4261 may represent a scaled-down analogue of that in M 87.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a structural analysis of 138 compact elliptical galaxies (cEs) in the redshift range of $z < 0.05$ using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR12 data. We perform single- and double-component Sérsic model fitting to their SDSS $r$-band surface brightness profiles. By dividing cEs into those with [cE(w)] and without [cE(w/o)] a bright host galaxy, we find a significant structural dichotomy: the majority ($\sim$85\%) of cE(w)s exhibit single-component profiles, while a similar proportion ($\sim$85\%) of isolated cE(w/o)s display double-component profiles, characterized by a compact, inner component and a diffuse, disk-like outer component. These results suggest that host-associated cE(w)s primarily form through the tidal stripping of larger progenitors, resulting in a compact bulge-like core. In contrast, isolated cE(w/o)s appear to form intrinsically at early epochs, likely through gas-rich mergers, and retain disk-like outer structures. The Sérsic index distribution of cE(w)s with single-component structure indicates progenitor types ranging from pseudo-bulge to classical bulge, supported by differences in stellar populations. A small fraction of cEs, including double-component cE(w)s and single-component cE(w/o)s, suggests complex evolutionary channels involving environmental capture or ejection. Our results emphasize that the structural characteristics of cEs, specifically the presence or absence of an extended outer envelope, serve as a crucial diagnostic tool to distinguish tidally stripped remnants from intrinsically formed low-mass cEs in isolation.

 - **Abstract**
 We examine a modified late-Universe dynamics where dark energy decays into dark matter, within the framework of metric $f(R)$-gravity in the Jordan frame. After a detailed analysis of the modified $\Lambda \text{CDM}$ model, we introduce a theoretical diagnostic tool to capture the emergence of an effective running Hubble constant as a function of redshift. We then compare this theoretical model with the 40-bin analysis of the Supernova Pantheon sample. This comparison allows us to determine the value of the additional free parameter that appears in our model, beyond those of the standard $\Lambda \text{CDM}$ model. Our modified late Universe dynamics provides a good-quality fit to the binned data, improving upon the previous phenomenological interpretation based on a power-law decay. However, unlike the power-law model, our approach cannot be extrapolated to the recombination redshift to match the Hubble constant measured by the Planck satellite. In fact, the dynamics resulting from the binned Pantheon sample analysis address only weakly the Hubble tension between the SH0ES and the Planck Collaboration values of the Hubble constant. Here we provide a convincing representation of the observed deviation of the cosmological dynamics from the $\Lambda$CDM-one, as it out-stands from the low redshift observed sources.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the anisotropic diffusion of cosmic rays in the large-scale Galactic magnetic field, where diffusion occurs at different rates along and across the magnetic field lines. To model this process, we use stochastic differential equations to describe cosmic ray propagation and solve them numerically. The Galactic magnetic field is modeled using the Jansson-Farrar prescription. In this study, we focus on the impact of perpendicular diffusion on the residence time of cosmic rays in the Galaxy. This allows us to estimate how anisotropic diffusion influences both the residence time and the total amount of matter (grammage) traversed by a typical cosmic ray during its journey through the Galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 We predict the non-thermal pressure (NTP) induced in the cores of galaxy clusters by kinetic jet feedback from an active galactic nucleus (AGN). We model a population of Fanaroff-Riley type I jets when sampling power-law distributions in jet power and age, which we evolve in time with a two-phase jet-lobe model. We couple the energy of each jet outburst to the surrounding gas inside spherical shells, allowing us to estimate the fraction of NTP to total pressure induced in the cluster. We predict the mean profile for this NTP fraction over the source population in a variety of cluster environments and for different AGN jet duty cycles. For typical gas and dark matter profiles, the mean NTP fraction peaks at ~4-6% when the AGN jets are active for 10-30% of the total AGN lifecycle. These predictions are in good agreement with observational constraints, suggesting that AGN feedback imparts only small non-thermal contributions to the cluster's core. Furthermore, we find a relationship between the peak in the mean NTP fraction and the AGN jet duty cycle in a given cluster environment. Applying this to Hitomi measurements of the NTP in the Perseus cluster, we infer an AGN jet duty cycle that is consistent with independent evidence of Perseus' AGN jet activity. We propose this as a novel approach for observationally inferring the past AGN activity of real clusters from their observed NTP fraction and environmental profiles.

 - **Abstract**
 We present cosmological constraints from Dark Energy Survey Year 3 (DES Y3) weak lensing data using persistent homology, a topological data analysis technique that tracks how features like clusters and voids evolve across density thresholds. For the first time, we apply spherical persistent homology to galaxy survey data through the algorithm TopoS2, which is optimized for curved-sky analyses and HEALPix compatibility. Employing a simulation-based inference framework with the Gower Street simulation suite, specifically designed to mimic DES Y3 data properties, we extract topological summary statistics from convergence maps across multiple smoothing scales and redshift bins. After neural network compression of these statistics, we estimate the likelihood function and validate our analysis against baryonic feedback effects, finding minimal biases (under $0.3\sigma$) in the $\Omega_\mathrm{m}-S_8$ plane. Assuming the $w$CDM model, our combined Betti numbers and second moments analysis yields $S_8 = 0.821 \pm 0.018$ and $\Omega_\mathrm{m} = 0.304\pm0.037$-constraints 70% tighter than those from cosmic shear two-point statistics in the same parameter plane. Our results demonstrate that topological methods provide a powerful and robust framework for extracting cosmological information, with our spherical methodology readily applicable to upcoming Stage IV wide-field galaxy surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a spectral-timing analysis of two NICER observations of the weakly magnetized neutron star low-mass X-ray binary Cygnus X-2. During these observations, we detect a rapid transition from a narrow 50-Hz horizontal-branch oscillation to a broad 5-Hz normal-branch oscillation, accompanied by an increase in source flux and a decrease in spectral hardness. Thanks to the large effective area of NICER, we are able to conduct a detailed comparison of the spectra associated with different types of quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) on short timescales. By fitting the spectra with a model that includes a disc and Comptonization components plus two emission lines, we find that the parameters of the disc component do not change significantly during the transition. However, assuming a fixed electron temperature, the optical depth of the Comptonization component decreases significantly. This drop in optical depth may be attributed to the expansion of the boundary layer or spreading this http URL addition, we find that the rms spectra for both the HBO and NBO are hard, suggesting that the boundary layer or spreading layer is driving the variability. We discuss the potential physical origin of the different types of QPOs.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetar phenomena are likely intertwined with the location and structure of magnetospheric currents. While general-relativistic effects may be important in shaping the force-free equilibria describing static configurations, most studies have been restricted to axial symmetry. Using a novel methodology based on physics-informed neural networks, fully three-dimensional configurations of varying stellar compactness are constructed. Realistic profiles for surface currents, qualitatively capturing the geometry of observed hotspots, are applied as boundary conditions to deduce the amount of free energy available to fuel outburst activity. It is found that the lowest-energy solution branches permit only a $\approx 30\%$ excess relative to current-starved solutions in axisymmetric cases with global twists, regardless of compactness, reducing to $\approx 5\%$ in 3D models with localised spots. Accounting for redshift reductions to their inferred dipole moments from timing data, explaining magnetar burst energetics therefore becomes more difficult unless the field hosts non-negligible multipoles. Discussions on other aspects of magnetar phenomena are also provided.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of the spectral and timing analyses of the accreting X-ray pulsar, 2S 1417-624, during the 2018 and 2021 outbursts with Insight-HXMT. We find that the pulse profiles in all energy bands exhibit clear double-peaked structures at low flux states. In the 1-10 keV band, the pulse profiles evolve from double to triple peaks at a flux level of $\sim$4.1$\ \times \ 10^{-9}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, and from triple to quadruple peaks at $\sim$6.4$\ \times \ 10^{-9}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. In the 10-30 keV and 30-100 keV bands, the pulse profiles become narrower at the first transition flux level, followed by a stark transition to quadruple-peaked and triple-peaked structures around the second flux level, respectively. The change of the pulse profile {during the second transition} reveals the transition of the emission pattern from the sub-critical (pencil beam) to the supercritical (fan beam) regime. By performing the binary orbital fitting of the observed spin periods, we provide new measurements of the orbital parameters from the 2021 outburst. Applying different accretion torque models and using the critical luminosity inferred from the pulse profile transitions, we derive a self-consistent distance of {2S 1417-624} in the range of approximately 12.0-15.0~kpc, based on the magnetic field strength derived from the cyclotron resonance scattering feature (CRSF). From the estimated distance of 13 kpc and Gaia's distance of 7.4 kpc, we can infer the observed transition luminosity of \((1.0-1.4) \times 10^{38} \, \mathrm{erg \, s^{-1}}\) and \((3.0-5.0) \times 10^{37} \, \mathrm{erg \, s^{-1}}\), respectively, and compare them with theoretical models. The spectral continuum parameters and the hardness ratio also show significant transitions around the second transition, strongly supporting a change in the accretion regime.

 - **Abstract**
 Resonant Drag Instabilities (RDIs) in protoplanetary discs are driven by the aerodynamic back-reaction of dust on gas and occur when the relative dust-gas motion resonate with a wave mode intrinsic to the gas fluid. Axisymmetric models indicate that the RDI generates filamentary perturbations, leading to grain clumping and planetesimal formation. Motivated by these findings, we investigate the dust-gas interaction in a non-axisymmetric inviscid protoplanetary disc with an embedded low-mass planet ($M_{\mathrm{p}}\in[0.3, 3] M_\oplus$, here $M_\oplus$ is the Earth mass). We conduct global 3D high-resolution two-fluid simulations, with the dust being parametrized by the Stokes number $\mathrm{St}\in[0.01,0.5]$. We find that planetary waves (PWs; also known as Rossby waves), which propagate along the downstream separatrices of the horseshoe region, resonate with the streaming motion and trigger the RDI. The consequent development of a global-scale filamentary dust distribution does not sensitively depend on the Stokes number, nor does it depend on the fast dust settling that takes place in an inviscid disc. The rapid onset of this instability, which is comparable to the dynamical orbital time-scale, suppresses the formation of asymmetric structures in the dust in the vicinity of the planet (such as dust voids and filaments). Additionally, we find that the dust feedback enables buoyancy resonances in an otherwise non-buoyant (globally isothermal) disc. Therefore, our results provide the first numerical evidence of RDIs generation driven by planetary waves.

 - **Abstract**
 A tidal disruption event (TDE) occurs when a star travels too close to a supermassive black hole. In some cases, accretion of the disrupted material onto the black hole launches a relativistic jet. In this paper, we present a long term observing campaign to study the radio and sub-millimeter emission associated with the fifth jetted/relativistic TDE: AT2022cmc. Our campaign reveals a long lived counterpart. We fit three different models to our data: a non-thermal jet, a spherical outflow consisting of both thermal and non-thermal electrons, and a jet with thermal and non-thermal electrons. We find that the data is best described by a relativistic spherical outflow propagating into an environment with a density profile following R^-1.8. Comparison of AT2022cmc to other TDEs finds agreement in the density profile of the environment but also that AT2022cmc is twice as energetic as the other well-studied relativistic TDE Swift J1644. Our observations of AT2022cmc allow a thermal electron population to be inferred for the first time in a jetted transient providing, new insights into the microphysics of relativistic transients jets.

 We present new color transformations between select near-infrared filters on JWST/NIRCam, Euclid/NISP, Roman/WFI, HST, and ground-based $izY+IJHK_S$, for a total of 105 unique filter combinations. Additionally, we apply these transformations to predict the color-magnitude relation of the tip of the red giant branch as seen with JWST, Euclid, and Roman based on theoretical results for HST and 2MASS filters; for JWST we find good agreement with empirical results in the literature. We also find typical residual dispersion around these transformations of 0.01 mag for Cepheid and RR Lyrae variables and RGB stars, but up to 0.1 mag for O- and C-rich TP-AGB stars.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the CLASH sample of galaxy clusters using a new deprojection method for weak gravitational lensing observations. This method is non-parametric, allowing us to infer mass profiles, or equivalently circular velocities, without having to assume a specific halo profile. While this method assumes spherical symmetry, we show that, on average, triaxiality is unlikely to significantly affect our results. We use this method to study the total mass profiles of the CLASH clusters, as well as the relation between their total and baryonic components: (1) We find that the implied circular velocities are consistent with being approximately flat at large radii, akin to the rotation curves of galaxies. (2) We infer radially resolved baryonic mass fractions, finding that these vary significantly from cluster to cluster and depend strongly on the details of the X-ray gas mass profiles. Since the gas mass profiles are poorly constrained at large radii, it is unclear whether the CLASH clusters reach the cosmic baryon fraction expected in $\Lambda$CDM. (3) The non-parametric masses are consistent with the stellar mass--halo mass relation expected in $\Lambda$CDM; fitting parametric NFW halos to the non-parametric mass profiles gives results in overall agreement with the expected mass-concentration relation, though the concentrations are relatively poorly constrained. (4) Galaxy clusters systematically deviate from the Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation (BTFR) and the Radial Acceleration Relation (RAR) defined by galaxies, but the magnitude of the offset depends strongly on the gas mass extrapolation at large radii. Contrary to some previous results based on hydrostatic equilibrium, we find that galaxy clusters may fall on the same BTFR and RAR as galaxies if one adds a suitable positive baryonic mass component.

 - **Abstract**
 Quasar outflows can play a crucial role in the evolution of their host galaxies through various feedback processes. This effect is expected to be particularly important when the universe was only 2-3 billion years old, during the period known as cosmic noon. By utilizing observations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopy Instrument (DESI), we conduct a survey of high-ionization quasar outflows at cosmic noon, with the aim of doubling the current sample of such outflows with distance and energetics determination. We also aim to compare these properties to those derived from spatially resolved outflows in similar quasars probed through Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS). In a sample of 130 quasars we detect signatures of high-ionization outflows in the form of a S IV trough in eight objects. We characterize the physical conditions of these outflows by determining their total hydrogen column density ($N_H$), ionization parameter ($U_H$), and electron number density ($n_e$). The detected outflows show complex kinematic structures with a wide range in blueshifted velocities (100$-$4600 km s$^{-1}$). We locate five out of the eight outflows at distances between 240$-$5500 pc away from the central source. From the combined sample of 15 high-ionization S IV outflows at cosmic noon, we find a high fraction (up to 46 %) of them to be powerful enough to contribute significantly to multi-stage AGN feedback processes. Their mass outflow rates and kinetic luminosities are also found to be consistent with spatially resolved outflows in a luminosity and redshift matched sample of quasars. Comparison with previous spectra reveals interesting variations in some objects, with two cases of emerging high-velocity broad absorption line features with velocities of $-$8000 and $-$39,000 km s$^{-1}$. An impressive case of four line-locked Si IV outflow systems is also revealed in one of the objects.
#### A Halpha metric for identifying dormant black holes in X-ray transients

 - **Abstract**
 Dormant black holes (BHs) in X-ray transients can be identified by the presence of broad Ha emission lines from quiescent accretion discs. Unfortunately, short-period cataclysmic variables (CVs) can also produce broad Ha lines, especially when viewed at high inclinations, and are thus a major source of contamination. Here we compare the full width at half maximum (FWHM) and equivalent width (EW) of the Ha line in a sample of 20 quiescent BH transients and 354 CVs (305 from SDSS I to IV) with secure orbital periods (Porb) and find that: (1) FWHM and EW values decrease with Porb, and (2) for a given Porb both parameters are typically larger in BH transients than in CVs. We also compile spectral types for 17 low-mass companions in BH transients from the literature and derive an empirical Porb-Teff calibration. Using this, we conclude that the decrease in EW with Porb is mostly driven by the dilution of the Ha flux by the donor star continuum, which dominates the r-band spectrum for Porb>~0.2 d. At shorter periods, the larger contribution of the disc to the total r-band flux introduces significant scatter in the EWs due to the changing visibility of the disc projected area with binary inclination. On the other hand, the larger EWs observed in BHs can be explained by their extreme mass ratios (which limit the fractional contribution of the companion to the total flux) and the absence of a white dwarf component (important at Porb<~0.085 d). Finally, we present a tentative metric, based on Ha FWHM and EW information, and provide optimal cuts to select ~80 % of the BH X-ray transients, while rejecting ~78 % of the CVs in our sample. Such a metric, combined with other multi-frequency diagnostics, can help detect new dormant BH X-ray transients in blind large-scale surveys such as HaWKs and its pathfinder, Mini-HaWKs.
