 - **Abstract**
 In dwarf galaxy models, outflows expel metal-enriched interstellar medium (ISM) into the circumgalactic medium (CGM) to reproduce their observed low metallicities, but measurements of dwarf CGM properties are scarce. We present a study of the CGM of an isolated dwarf at $z=0.5723$ with a stellar mass of $\approx5\times10^7\rm\,M_{\odot}$ and star-formation rate ($\approx0.05\,\rm M_\odot\,yr^{-1}$) and ISM metallicity ($\rm [O/H]\approx-0.9$) consistent with the star-forming main sequence and mass-metallicity relation. A background quasar sightline with archival UV spectra probes the dwarf's CGM at a projected distance of 28 kpc, corresponding to approximately half of the estimated virial radius. The dwarf's CGM is detected in H I, intermediate metal ions of C III, O III, and O IV, and kinematically broader, highly-ionized O VI, but is undetected in N IV and Ne VIII. Photoionization modeling of the intermediate ions indicates a modest volume-filling factor ($\sim 6\%$ along the sightline or $\sim 2\%$ globally), and a mass of $\sim2\times10^8 {\rm\,M_\odot}$, $\sim4\times$ higher than the dwarf's stellar mass, but $\sim10\times$ less than the highly ionized CGM. The O VI kinematics are comparable to the dwarf's estimated virial velocity, suggesting it is likely associated with cool, photoionized, and volume-filling CGM, with bulk motion or turbulence dominating over thermal pressure. The metallicity inferred for the intermediate ions is $\rm [O/H]=-0.6$, but with low relative abundances of $\rm [C/O]=-0.6$ and $\rm [N/O]<-0.9$. The [N/O] is below levels expected of the dwarf's ISM, but consistent with core-collapse supernova ejecta, suggesting that supernova-enriched gas escaped the dwarf without mixing significantly with ISM enriched in nitrogen from evolved, low-mass stars.

 - **Abstract**
 The dynamics of the intra-cluster medium (ICM), the hot plasma that fills galaxy clusters, are shaped by gravity-driven cluster mergers and feedback from supermassive black holes (SMBH) in the cluster cores. XRISM measurements of ICM velocities in several clusters offer insights into these processes. We compare XRISM measurements for nine galaxy clusters (Virgo, Perseus, Centaurus, Hydra A, PKS\,0745--19, A2029, Coma, A2319, Ophiuchus) with predictions from three state-of-the-art cosmological simulation suites, TNG-Cluster, The Three Hundred Project GADGET-X, and GIZMO-SIMBA, that employ different models of feedback. In cool cores, XRISM reveals systematically lower velocity dispersions than the simulations predict, with all ten measurements below the median simulated values by a factor $1.5-1.7$ on average and all falling within the bottom $10\%$ of the predicted distributions. The observed kinetic-to-total pressure ratio is also lower, with a median value of $2.2\%$, compared to the predicted $5.0-6.5\%$ for the three simulations. Outside the cool cores and in non-cool-core clusters, simulations show better agreement with XRISM measurements, except for the outskirts of the relaxed, cool-core cluster A2029, which exhibits an exceptionally low kinetic pressure support ($<1\%$), with none of the simulated systems in either of the three suites reaching such low levels. The non-cool-core Coma and A2319 exhibit dispersions at the lower end but within the simulated spread. Our comparison suggests that the three numerical models may overestimate the kinetic effects of SMBH feedback in cluster cores. Additional XRISM observations of non-cool-core clusters will clarify if there is a systematic tension in the gravity-dominated regime as well.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on phase-resolved optical spectroscopy and photometry in the R and B bands of the white dwarf candidate ZTF 185139.81+171430.3. The source has been reported to be variable with a large amplitude of close to 1 magnitude, in the R band, and a short period of 12.37 min. We confirm this period and interpret it as the spin period of the white dwarf. The optical spectrum shows emission lines from hydrogen and helium superposed on a featureless continuum. The continuum changes shape throughout a cycle, such that it is redder when the source is bright. There is tentative evidence for Doppler shifts in the emission lines during the spin cycle with an amplitude of a few tens of km s$^{-1}$. Notably, the H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ lines exhibit different radial velocity amplitudes, suggesting that they come from different emission regions. We also identify a candidate orbital period of 1.00 hr, based on potential orbital sidebands. These features - Doppler shifts modulated at the spin frequency, brightness variations, and continuum shape changes - are consistent with the accretion curtain model, in which material is funneled from a truncated inner disc along magnetic field lines onto the magnetic poles of the white dwarf.

 - **Abstract**
 Now detected out to redshifts of $z\sim 14.5$, the rest-frame ultraviolet and optical spectra of galaxies encode numerous physical properties of the interstellar medium (ISM). Accurately extracting these properties from spectra remains a key challenge that numerical simulations are uniquely suited to address. We present a study of the observed ISM of galaxies in MEGATRON: a suite of cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulations coupled to on-the-fly non-equilibrium thermochemistry, with multiple prescriptions for star formation/feedback and parsec-scale resolution; capable of directly predicting spectroscopic properties of early galaxies. We find that irrespective of feedback physics used, the ISM of high-redshift galaxies is denser, less metal enriched, and subject to higher ionization parameters and radiation fields compared to similar mass galaxies in the local Universe -- in agreement with interpretations of JWST observations. Using common observational techniques to infer bulk galaxy properties, we find that ISM gas density controls the slope of the mass-metallicity relation. Similarly, at the densities reached in some high-redshift galaxies, O32 becomes a density tracer rather than one of ionization parameter. This motivates the use of other line ratios like C43 and N43 to infer the ionization state of the gas. Finally, various feedback models populate different regions of strong-line diagnostic diagrams as the line ratios are sensitive to the feedback-modulated density-temperature structure of the ISM. Therefore, observed strong-line diagnostics can provide a strong constraint on the underlying physics of star formation and feedback in the high-redshift Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Little Red Dots (LRDs) are a new class of compact extragalactic objects, with a v-shaped optical spectral energy distribution breaking close to the Balmer break wavelength, and broad, typically exponentially-shaped lines. They are believed to be supermassive black holes surrounded by very dense, ionized gas, leading us to explore for any departures from Case B recombination by examining the ratios of multiple hydrogen Balmer lines: $H\alpha$, $H\beta$, $H\gamma$, and $H\delta$. We analyze a dozen high-S/N LRDs with JWST/NIRSpec, measuring Balmer ratios in the seven objects with coverage of at least three lines. We decompose the line ratios into their respective broad and narrow components. Broad line ratios are consistent with Case B plus dust extinction in all objects but one, RUBIES EGS-49140, which departs from Case B expectations by more than $5\sigma$. The narrow components are consistent with minimal dust attenuation, while two objects exhibit narrow $H\alpha$/$H\beta \approx 1.8$. Such low decrements are observed in highly ionized density bounded nebulae, associated with starburst environments. Nevertheless, both flat decrement cases can be reconciled assuming an unresolved absorption feature. RUBIES EGS-49140, shows a high broad $H\alpha$/$H\beta$, but $H\gamma$/$H\alpha$ and $H\delta$/$H\alpha$ ratios are lower than expected for extinction-modified Case B, hinting at an unphysically steep dust law. These line ratios may be due to increased optical depth in the Balmer lines, as a direct effect of high density (log$n_e$ > 9) gas surrounding the black hole. If Case B recombination does hold in most LRDs, they must be moderate-to-heavily dust obscured ($A_V\simeq1-8$) while the host-galaxy should be dust-free, suggesting that the extinction in the broad lines is local to the LRD and not due to the general ISM of the host galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 The Little Red Dot (LRD) paradigm comprises three main unknowns that are intrinsically connected: (1) What is the nature of these sources? (2) How do they form? (3) How do they evolve? Larger spectroscopic samples and high-resolution data are needed to delve deeper into the mechanisms ruling these sources. Understanding their formation and evolution requires identifying the rise and fall of the key features that characterize these systems, such as their compactness and ``V''-shaped spectral energy distributions. In this work, we present a galaxy system nicknamed The Stingray that was identified in the Canadian NIRISS Unbiased Cluster Survey (CANUCS). This group contains three sources at $z_{\mathrm{spec}} = 5.12$, including an active galactic nucleus (AGN), a Balmer break galaxy, and a star-forming satellite. The latter resembles a Building Block System in which interactions boost stellar mass and black hole mass growth beyond what is expected from secular processes alone. The AGN in this system exhibits features indicative of a transitional object, bridging a normal AGN and an LRD phase. These are a blue rest-frame ultraviolet slope, compact size, and a broad H$\alpha$ line (all of which are characteristic of LRDs), but a flatter rest-frame optical slope compared to that observed in LRDs. The features in this source point to the emergence or fading of an LRD, potentially triggered by environmental effects.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we present a numerical simulation of an impulsively driven chromospheric jet in the solar atmosphere using the non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations coupled with frequency- and angle-averaged radiation transport equations. These include the dynamics of the radiation energy density and radiation flux. The jet is initiated by a localized Gaussian pulse applied to the vertical velocity component in the upper chromosphere (y = 1.75 Mm), producing a collimated plasma structure that exhibits characteristics similar to macrospicules. We focus on the formation and evolution of the chromospheric jet as it propagates through an optically thin region encompassing the upper chromosphere and solar corona, where both the Planck-averaged absorption and Rosseland-averaged scattering opacities are low. Although radiation transport terms only slightly affect the jet's morphology, they play a significant role in governing radiative processes in the corona. In particular, radiation transport contributes to the dissipation of the chromospheric jet, which effectively acts as a radiative cooling mechanism as the jet evolves through the optically thin solar corona.

 - **Abstract**
 We present integral field spectroscopy of ionized gas components in AGC 111629, an edge-on low surface brightness galaxy (LSBG) with a stellar mass of 5.7$\times$10$^{8}$ M$_{\odot}$. AGC 111629 displays an irregular H$\alpha$ morphology and an arch-like structure in the extraplanar region, which is absent in continuous stellar image. The irregular H$\alpha$ morphology may be related to a past merger event with its satellite galaxy AGC 748815. A peanut-shaped structure at the center in the integrated [OIII]$\lambda$5007 map, with a position angle that differs from that of the main stellar disk. This structure exhibits a higher [OIII]$\lambda$5007/H$\beta$ flux ratio, a larger equivalent width (EW) of [OIII]$\lambda$5007, and a lower H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ flux radio ($<$ 2.86). Some spaxels associated with the peanut-shaped structure fall within the composite region of the BPT diagram based on [NII]$\lambda$6583. These features may be associated with the central AGN. Additionally, a sub-peak in the southern disk is clearly visible in the [OIII]$\lambda$5007 map. An extended region ($\sim$ 2 kpc) with an extremely low value of H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ flux ratio is observed near this sub-peak. We interpret the sub-peak as a superbubble likely driven by supernova explosions in the southern disk. We derive the gas-phase metallicity, 12+log(O/H), using the [NII]$\lambda$6583/H$\alpha$ diagnostic and find that AGC 111629 exhibits low central metallicity. This may result from feedback associated with AGN activity and supernova explosions.
#### Formation of A Nuclear Star Cluster Through A Merger Event In The Low Surface Brightness Galaxy AGC 223218

 - **Abstract**
 We present the properties of the nuclear star cluster (NSC) in the low surface brightness galaxy AGC 223218. The disk of the galaxy can be modeled using two S$\acute{\rm e}$rsic components with distinct central positions: one representing the inner bright disk and the other corresponding to the extended outer disk. We estimate the stellar masses of the NSC and the host galaxy using two methods: spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting and mass-to-light versus color relations (MLCRs). The stellar mass ratio of the NSC to AGC 223218 is 0.094 based on the SED method and 0.072 using MLCRs. The NSC presents a younger stellar population and a lower [Fe/H] value than the host, as determined from SDSS and LAMOST spectra analysis using pPXF fitting. AGC 223218 is located at the boundary between the Seyfert and star-forming regions in the [SII]-BPT diagram, whereas in the [NII]-BPT diagram, it falls in the track of star-forming SDSS galaxies. This suggests the presence of strong shocks in AGC 223218. We propose that the NSC in AGC 223218 may have formed as a result of a merger event. Furthermore, the observed X-ray luminosity of AGC 223218 with eROSITA is two orders of magnitude higher than the expected X-ray luminosity from X-ray binaries, suggesting the presence of an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) in the NSC. To account for the observed X-ray luminosity, we estimate the IMBH accretion rate to be approximately 0.001.

 - **Abstract**
 Three-dimensional magnetic fields (3D B-fields) are essential to understand the formation and evolution of the interstellar medium and multi-scale star formation; however, the accurate measurement of 3D B-fields is still challenging. The angle of dust polarization by magnetically aligned grains provides the projected B-fields onto the plane-of-sky, while the degree of dust polarization provides the B-field's inclination angles with respect to the line-of-sight. Our previous theoretical studies proposed a new method of probing 3D B-fields using dust polarization combined with the Radiative Torque (RAT) alignment theory and demonstrated the accurate inference of B-field inclination angles using synthetic polarization data. In this paper, we report the first application of the new technique to study 3D B-fields and dust properties in the G11.11-0.12 filament (hereafter G11) from starlight polarization observations taken by ISRF/SIRPOL at $2.19\,\rm\mu m$. Using both observed starlight polarization and optical dust extinction curve from Gaia mission, we constrained the maximum grain size of $0.25\,\rm\mu m$ and the grain elongation with an axial ratio of $s\gtrsim 1.4$ in the outer regions of G11. We calculated the alignment properties in the G11 by using the \textsc{DustPOL\_py} code based on the RAT theory. The B-field's inclination angles are then inferred from the observed starlight polarization efficiency when the grain alignment is included, showing the inclined B-fields in the G11 with a mean angle of $\sim 50$ degrees. From these inferred inclination angles, we found evidence of the local 3D arc-shaped B-field structure toward the sightline. These findings are important for fully understanding 3D B-field's roles in the formation and evolution of massive filamentary clouds.

 - **Abstract**
 IC 10 X-1, NGC 300 X-1, and Cyg X-3 represent a unique class of X-ray binaries consisting of a stellar-mass black hole (BH) accreting material from a Wolf-Rayet (WR) star companion. These systems are particularly intriguing due to their short orbital periods (less than 1.5 d), making them promising progenitors of gravitational wave (GW) sources detectable by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) network. With a newly implemented prescription for accretion efficiency in the standard Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) framework and a corrected treatment of dynamical tides, we present for the \textit{first} time detailed binary evolution models to diagnose their properties at different evolutionary states and evaluate their fates as potential GW sources detectable by the LVK network. With additional constraints on the observed properties of IC 10 X-1 and NGC 300 X-1, we determine that the upper limit of the BH mass in these systems (IC 10 X-1: $M_{\rm BH} \lesssim 25\, M_\odot$, NGC 300 X-1: $M_{\rm BH} \lesssim 15\, M_\odot$) is much lower than previously estimated. Both systems are expected to form binary black holes (BBHs) that will merge within a Hubble time, unless the BH in NGC 300 X-1 has a mass of $9\,M_\odot$, the lower limit estimated in a previous study based on the continuum-fitting method employing a relativistic slim-disc model. For Cyg X-3, we find that the upper limit on the BH spin magnitude cannot exceed 0.6. Interestingly, the WR star in Cyg X-3 is likely to form a lower-mass gap BH, and the resulting binary BH system will merge within the Hubble time.

 - **Abstract**
 Both jets and ionized outflows in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are thought to play important roles in affecting the star formation and evolution of host galaxies, but their relationship is still unclear. As a pilot study, we performed a detailed spectral analysis for a radio-loud (RL) AGN 3C~59 ($z=0.1096$) by systematically considering various factors that may affect the fitting results, and thereby establishing a general spectral fitting strategy for subsequent research with larger sample. 3C~59 is one rare target for simultaneously studying jets and warm absorbers (WAs) that is one type of ionized outflows. Based on the multi-wavelength data from near-infrared (NIR) to hard X-ray bands detected by DESI, GALEX, and XMM-Newton, we used SPEX code to build broadband continuum models and perform photoionization modeling with PION code to constrain the physical parameters of WAs in 3C~59. We found two WAs with ionization parameter of $\log [\xi/(\rm{erg\ cm\ s}^{-1})] = 2.65^{+0.10}_{-0.09}$ and $1.65\pm 0.11$, respectively, and their outflowing velocities are $v_{\rm out} = -528^{+163}_{-222}\ \rm{km\ s}^{-1}$ and $-228^{+121}_{-122}\ \rm{km\ s}^{-1}$, respectively. These WAs are located between outer torus and narrow (emission-)line region, and their positive $v_{\rm out}$-$\xi$ relation can be explained by the radiation-pressure-driven mechanism. We found that the estimations of these physical properties are affected by the different spectral fitting strategies, such as the inclusion of NIR to ultra-violet data, the choice of energy range of spectrum, or the composition of the spectral energy distribution. Based on the same fitting strategy, this work presents a comparative study of outflow driven mechanism between a RL AGN (3C 59) and a radio-quiet AGN (NGC 3227), which suggests a similar driven mechanism of their WA outflows and a negligible role of jets in this process.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first systematic search for "changing-look" ("CL") behavior in the broad He ii {\lambda}4686 emission line in quasars, utilizing repeated spectroscopy from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The He ii line, originating from high-ionization gas and powered by extreme ultraviolet photons, serves as a sensitive tracer of changes in the ionizing continuum. After applying strict spectral selection criteria and visual inspection to a parent sample of over 9,000 quasars with multi-epoch spectra, we identify a sample of 34 He ii "changing-look" quasars that show a significant appearance or disappearance of the broad He ii {\lambda}4686 line. Compared with previously known H\{beta} "CL" quasars, the He ii "CL" sample exhibits similarly strong continuum variability and broad-line flux changes, yet shows a preference for higher Eddington ratios and lower host-galaxy contamination. These results highlight the value of He ii line in studying the central variable engines of AGNs and uncovering a more complete census of extreme quasar variability. A comparison with H\{beta} "CL" further underscores the profound selection biases inherent in "changing-look" studies, especially those associated with line strength, host-galaxy contamination, and spectral signal-to-noise ratio.

 - **Abstract**
 Historically employed spectroscopic architectures used for large field of view mapping spectroscopy in millimetere and sub-millimetre astronomy suffer from significant drawbacks. On-chip filterbank spectrometers are a promising technology in this respect; however, they must overcome an orders-of-magnitude increase in detector counts, efficiency loss due to dielectric properties, and stringent fabrication tolerances that currently limit scaling to resolutions of order 1000 over a large array. We propose coupling a medium-resolution Fourier transform spectrometer to a low-resolution filterbank spectrometer focal plane, which serves as a post-dispersion element. In this arrangement, medium resolution imaging spectroscopy is provided by the Fourier transform spectrometer, while the low resolution filterbank spectrometer serves to decrease the photon noise inherent in typical broadband Fourier transform spectrometer measurements by over an order of magnitude. This is achieved while maintaining the excellent imaging advantages of both architectures. We present predicted mapping speeds for a filterbank-dispersed Fourier transform spectrometer from a ground-based site and a balloon-borne platform. We also demonstrate the potential that an instrument of this type has for an R~1000 line intensity mapping experiment using the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope as an example platform. We demonstrate that a filterbank-dispersed Fourier transform spectrometer would be capable of R~1000 measurements of CO power spectra with a signal-to-noise ratio of 10--100 with surveys of $10^5$--$10^6$ spectrometer hours.

 Ultra-high-energy (UHE), exceeding 100 TeV (10^12 electronvolts), {\gamma}-rays manifests extreme particle acceleration in astrophysical sources. Recent observations by {\gamma}-ray telescopes, particularly by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO), have revealed a few tens of UHE sources, indicating numerous Galactic sources capable of accelerating particles to PeV (10^15 electronvolts) energies. However, discerning the dominant acceleration mechanisms (leptonic versus hadronic), the relative contributions of specific source classes, and the role of particle transport in shaping their observed emission are central goals of modern UHE astrophysics. Here we report the discovery of a giant UHE {\gamma}-ray emitter at -17.5° off the Galactic plane - a region where UHE {\gamma}-ray sources are rarely found. The emitter exhibits a distinctive asymmetric shape, resembling a giant "Peanut" spanning 0.45° \times 4.6°, indicative of anisotropic particle distribution over a large area. A highly aged millisecond pulsar (MSP) J0218+4232 is the sole candidate accelerator positionally coincident with the Peanut region. Its association with UHE {\gamma}-rays extending to 0.7 PeV, if confirmed, would provide the first evidence of a millisecond pulsar powering PeV particles. Such a finding challenges prevailing models, which posit that millisecond pulsars cannot sustain acceleration to PeV energies. The detection reveals fundamental gaps in understanding particle acceleration, cosmic-ray transport, and interstellar magnetic field effects, potentially revealing new PeV accelerator (PeVatron) classes.

 Aims. The accretion disk of low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs) is a radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF). Our goal is to find evidence of RIAF radiation from LLAGNs with jets and analyze their radiation properties, which also adds samples to future research on LLAGNs. Methods. Weconducted an analysis of the X-ray data obtained from NuSTAR and XMM-Newton observations of NGC 315 and NGC 4261, encompassing both timing and spectral investigations. The joint X-ray spectra of the two LLAGNs were fitted using various functional forms and radiative models in XSPEC. Results. No significant variability on timescales of days is observed for both NGC 315 and NGC 4261. The X-ray continuum emission of NGC 315 is suitable for cutoff power-law (PL) fitting, yielding a cutoff energy of Ecut = 18.45 keV, which is the lowest value found in LLAGNssofar. In contrast, the X-ray continuum of NGC 4261 is composed of two PL components, with no signs of a cutoff energy. A prominent neutral Fe K{\alpha} line is observed in NGC 315, while an ionized Fe XXV line is seen in NGC 4261. The derived reflection fractions are R = 0.61 for NGC 315 and R = 0.18 for NGC 4579. Neither NGC 315 nor NGC 4261 shows evidence of a Compton reflection bump. Conclusions. The X-ray spectral characteristics support the RIAF emission as the dominant origin of the X-rays in both sources, although an additional soft PL component originating from the inner jet is observed in NGC 4261. The higher reflection fraction compared to other LLAGNs, along with the detection of a neutral Fe K{\alpha} line, suggests the existence of a truncated accretion disk with a relatively small radius in NGC 315. Bremsstrahlung radiation appears to be the dominant cooling mechanism for the plasma in NGC315, while Comptonization within the RIAF is more likely responsible for the X-ray emission in NGC 4261.

 - **Abstract**
 H2 is the most abundant molecule in the interstellar medium and is a useful tool to study photodissociation regions, where radiative feedback from massive stars on molecular clouds is dominant. The James Webb Space Telescope, with its high spatial resolution, sensitivity, and wavelength coverage provides unique access to the detection of most of H2 lines and the analysis of its spatial morphology. Our goal is to use H2 line emission detected with the JWST in the Horsehead nebula to constrain the physical parameters (e.g., extinction, gas temperature, thermal pressure) throughout the PDR and its geometry. The study of H2 morphology reveals that FUV-pumped lines peak closer to the edge of the PDR than thermalized lines. From H2 lines, we estimate the value of extinction throughout the PDR. We find that AV is increasing from the edge of the PDR to the second and third H2 filaments. Then, we study the H2 excitation in different regions across the PDR. The temperature profile shows that the observed gas temperature is quite constant throughout the PDR, with a slight decline in each of the dissociation fronts. This study also reveals that the OPR is far from equilibrium. We observe a spatial separation of para and ortho rovibrational levels, indicating that efficient ortho-para conversion and preferential ortho self-shielding are driving the spatial variations of the OPR. Finally, we derive a thermal pressure in the first filament around P > 6x10$^6$ K cm$^{-3}$, about ten times higher than that of the ionized gas. We highlight that template stationary 1D PDR models cannot account for the intrinsic 2D structure and the very high temperature observed in the Horsehead nebula. We argue the highly excited, over-pressurized H2 gas at the edge of the PDR interface could originate from the mixing between the cold and hot phase induced by the photo-evaporation of the cloud.

 - **Abstract**
 (Abridged)We explore the potential of optical variability selection methods to identify AGN, including those challenging to detect with conventional techniques. Using the unprecedented combination of depth, sky coverage, and cadence of the ZTF survey, we target even starlight-dominated AGN, known for their redder colours, weaker variability signals, and difficult nuclear photometry due to their resolved hosts. We perform aperture photometry on ZTF reference-subtracted images for 40 million sources across 8,000 deg^2, assemble light curves and classify objects employing an RF algorithm into 14 classes, including 341,938 candidate AGN. We compare variability metrics derived from our photometry to those obtained from ZTF Data Release light curves (DR11-psf), to assess the impact of our analysis. We find that the fraction of low-z quiescent galaxies exhibiting significant variability drops dramatically (from 98\% of the sample to 7\%) when replacing the DR11-psf light curves with our difference image, aperture photometry (DI-Ap) version. The overall number of variable low-z AGN remains high (99\% when using DR11-psf lightcurves, 83\% when using DI-Ap), however, implying that our photometry can detect the fainter variability in host dominated AGN. The classifier effectively distinguishes between AGN and other sources, demonstrating high recovery rates even for AGN in resolved nearby galaxies. AGN candidates in eROSITA's eFEDS field, detected in X-rays and bright enough for ZTF optical observations, were classified as AGN (79\%) and non-variable galaxies (20\%). These groups show a 2 dex difference in X-ray luminosity but not in X-ray flux. A significant fraction of X-ray AGN are optically too faint for ZTF, and conversely, a quarter of ZTF AGN in the eFEDS area lack X-ray detections, highlighting a wide range of X-ray-to-optical flux ratios in AGN.

 - **Abstract**
 We present new broad-band X-ray results aimed at the identification and characterization of four poorly studied hard X-ray transients discovered by INTEGRAL: IGR J16426+6536, IGR J09446-2636, IGR J21268+6203, and IGR J02447+7046. The key properties and X-ray behavior of these sources have remained largely unknown until now. We investigated the temporal, spectral, and energetic characteristics of their hard X-ray outbursts detected above 20 keV by INTEGRAL. In addition, we performed a systematic analysis of unpublished archival soft X-ray observations below 10 keV, enabling a full exploration of their large INTEGRAL error circles in search of the most likely soft X-ray counterparts. Within their arcsecond-sized X-ray error circles, we identified single optical/near-infrared counterparts for each source. We analyzed their photometric properties to constrain the nature of the systems. Our results show that the X-ray properties of these four transients are inconsistent with the previously proposed extragalactic AGN origin, and instead support a Galactic nature for all of them. Specifically, we propose a very faint X-ray transient classification for IGR J16426+6536, a nearby flaring star for IGR J09446-2636 and IGR J21268+6203, finally a gamma-ray binary nature for IGR J02447+7046.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a systematic reassessment of 5,062 high-Galactic latitude gamma-ray sources from the Fermi-LAT 4FGL-DR4 catalog using Firmamento, a web-based platform for multi-frequency source discovery and analysis. Our goal is to provide an independent evaluation of LAT gamma-ray source associations through alternative spectral and spatial methods that combine recent and legacy survey data, supplemented by human supervision of spectral energy distributions (SEDs), source morphology, flux variability, and template-based comparisons. Firmamento confirms the 4FGL-DR4 and 4LAC-DR3 counterparts or unassociated sources in 4,493 cases (88.8%), demonstrating the robustness of both approaches. Beyond this general agreement, we identify 421 new blazar counterparts among previously unassociated sources, thereby reducing the fraction of unidentified extragalactic Fermi-LAT sources from 25% to 17%. In addition, in 64 cases we find alternative blazar associations, while in 49 instances we do not confirm the 4FGL-DR4 association. For all confirmed blazar counterparts we provide homogeneous estimates of synchrotron peak frequency and peak flux using machine-learning and template-based methods; these agree with 4LAC-DR3 values in most cases, though significant discrepancies appear for a few dozen sources, often due to improved X-ray coverage. The primary outcome of this work is the 1st Firmamento LAT AGN table (1FLAT), made publicly available through the Firmamento platform (this https URL), where all related multi-wavelength data and images are available. The project involved extensive manual validation and benefited from the active participation of graduate and undergraduate students, highlighting the platform's value for both research and education.

 - **Abstract**
 Active repeating Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), with their large number of bursts, burst energy distribution, and their potential energy evolution, offer critical insights into the FRBs emission mechanisms. Traditional pipelines search for bursts through conducting dedispersion trials and looking for signals above certain fluence thresholds, both of which could result in missing weak and narrow-band bursts. In order to improve the completeness of the burst set, we develop an End-to-end DedispersE-agnostic Nonparametric AI model (EDEN), which directly detect bursts from dynamic spectrum and is the first detection pipeline that operates without attempting dedispersion. We apply EDEN to archival FAST L-band observations during the extreme active phase of the repeating source FRB 20121102A, resulting in the largest burst set for any FRB to date, which contains 5,927 individual bursts, tripling the original burst set. The much enhanced completeness enables a refined analysis of the temporal behavior of energy distribution, revealing that the bimodal energy distribution remains stable over time. It is rather an intrinsic feature of the emission mechanisms than a consequence of co-evolving with burst rate.

 - **Abstract**
 Starspots trace stellar magnetic activity and influence both stellar evolution and exoplanet characterization. While occultation-based spot analyses have been applied to individual systems, comparative studies remain limited. We apply the StarryStarryProcess Bayesian surface-mapping framework to archival Kepler light curves of two planet hosts, Kepler-63 and Kepler-17, extending the validation established on TOI-3884 (Paper I). Across both systems, we infer characteristic spot radii smaller than 10 degrees. The latitudinal spot distributions of these G dwarfs show bimodal belts: Kepler-63 near 30 degrees and Kepler-17 near 15 degrees. Our analysis yields stellar obliquity measurements in excellent agreement with previous studies, validating our methodology and demonstrating that transit-based surface mapping can simultaneously recover planetary parameters, stellar orientations, and magnetic morphologies. Together, these results reveal a range of stellar geometries from nearly aligned (Kepler-17) to highly misaligned (Kepler-63).

 - **Abstract**
 Strongly lensed supernovae (glSNe) provide a powerful, independent method to measure the Hubble constant, $H_{0}$, through time delays between their multiple images. The accuracy of this measurement depends critically on both the precision of time delay estimation and the robustness of lens modeling. In many current cluster-scale modeling algorithms, all multiple images used for modeling are simplified as point sources to reduce computational costs. In the first paper of the CURLING program, we demonstrated that such a point-like approximation can introduce significant uncertainties and biases in both magnification reconstruction and cosmological inference. In this study, we explore how such simplifications affect $H_0$ measurements from glSNe. We simulate a lensed supernova at $z=1.95$, lensed by a galaxy cluster at $z=0.336$, assuming time delays are measured from LSST-like light curves. The lens model is constructed using JWST-like imaging data, utilizing both Lenstool and a pixelated method developed in CURLING. Under a fiducial cosmology with $H_0=70\rm \ km \ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}$, the Lenstool model yields $H_0=69.91^{+6.27}_{-5.50}\rm \ km\ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}$, whereas the pixelated framework improves the precision by over an order of magnitude, $H_0=70.39^{+0.82}_{-0.60}\rm \ km \ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}$. Our results indicate that in the next-generation observations (e.g., JWST), uncertainties from lens modeling dominate the error budget for $H_0$ inference, emphasizing the importance of incorporating the extended surface brightness of multiple images to fully leverage the potential of glSNe for cosmology.

 - **Abstract**
 The production site and process responsible for the highly variable high-energy emission observed from blazar jets are still debated. Gravitational lenses can be used as microscopes to investigate the nature of such sources. We study the broad-band spectral properties and the high-energy variability of the gravitationally-lensed blazar PKS 1830-211, for which radio observations have revealed two images, to put constraints on the jet physics and the existence of a gravitationally-induced time delay and magnification ratio between the images. We utilize Swift/XRT, Nustar, and Fermi-LAT observations from 2016 and 2019 to compare periods of low activity and high activity in PKS 1830-211. Short-timescale variability is elucidated with an unbinned power spectrum analysis of time-tagged NuSTAR photon data. To study the gravitationally-induced time delay in the gamma-ray light curve observed with Fermi-LAT, we improve existing autocorrelation function based methods. Our modified auto-correlation method yields a delay of t_0=21.1 +/- 0.1 d and magnification factor a=0.13 +/- 0.01. These parameters remain time-invariant. In data from 2016 and 2019, the X-ray spectra remain remarkably stable, contrasting with extreme changes in gamma-rays. Both states can be fitted with a single component from Comptonisation of infrared emission from the dusty torus, with different gamma-ray states arising solely from a shift in the break of the electron energy distribution. The detection of a consistent lag throughout the whole light curve suggests that they originate from a persistent location in the jet.

 - **Abstract**
 Young accreting planetary-mass objects are thought to draw material from a circumplanetary disk (CPD) composed of gas and dust. While the gas within the disk is expected to disperse within the first million years, strong accretion has nonetheless been detected in older systems, including the 30--45 Myr-old planetary-mass companion Delorme 1 AB b. We conducted spectroscopic observations with JWST/MIRI to investigate the presence of circumplanetary material around this young, accreting planet, and to characterize the planet's atmospheric properties and composition. We perform forward modeling using atmospheric models to characterize the planet's atmosphere. Beyond 10 microns, the SED becomes dominated by this CPD rather than the planet itself. We detect strong emission from HCN and C$_2$H$_2$, while no O-bearing species are observed in the CPD spectrum, suggesting the gas in the CPD has an elevated C/O. We also identify spatially extended H$_2$ emission around the planet, tracing warm gas, with indications that it may be at a higher temperature than the non-extended component. The mid-infrared spectrum of the planetary-mass companion Delorme 1 AB b reveals the first detection of bright C-bearing species in a CPD, together with an outflow traced by H$_2$ extended emission, that could be interpreted as a disk wind. The hot dust continuum emission suggests an inner cavity in the CPD. The presence of warm gas in the CPD provides constraints on the disk's chemical composition and physical conditions, opening up new avenues for disk studies. The study of these long-lived "Peter Pan" disks will enhance our understanding of how accretion persists in evolved low-mass systems, shedding light on their formation, longevity, and evolutionary pathways in planetary systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Optical emission-line diagnostic diagrams, such as the classical BPT, are widely used to identify ionisation mechanisms in galaxies but often suffer from degeneracies, especially when multiple sources coexist. We critically evaluate the effectiveness of these diagnostics in distinguishing star-forming galaxies, retired galaxies (RGs), and active galactic nuclei (AGNs), and propose refined methods to reduce misclassifications. Using a large sample of nearby galaxies from the NASA-Sloan Atlas cross-matched with SDSS spectroscopy, we define representative subsamples of late-type/star-forming galaxies, early-type/RGs, and multiwavelength-selected AGNs. Their distributions are analysed across traditional and modern diagnostics, including WHaN, WHaD, and the newly introduced WHaO diagram, which combine H{\alpha} equivalent width with [N II]/H{\alpha}, {\sigma}(H{\alpha}), and [O III]/[O II], respectively. Quantitative comparisons reveal that classical BPT diagrams overestimate star-forming galaxies by ~10% and misclassify up to 45% of AGNs and nearly all RGs. Diagnostics incorporating EW(H{\alpha}) achieve improved accuracy, reducing misclassifications to {\sim} 20\ % for AGNs and {\sim} 15\% for RGs. A revised classification scheme based on EW(H{\alpha}) thresholds and consistent WHaD/WHaO results yields the highest purity (8-25% misclassifications) and better reflects underlying physical conditions. Our analysis demonstrates that BPT-based methods fail to reliably separate ionisation mechanisms, particularly in galaxies hosting weak AGNs or evolved stellar populations. Updated EW(H{\alpha})-based diagnostics offer a more accurate framework for studying galaxy ionisation and should replace traditional schemes in future population studies.

 - **Abstract**
 The migration of planets within their nascent protoplanetary disks is a fundamental process that shapes the final architecture of planetary systems. However, studying this phenomenon through direct hydrodynamical simulations is computationally demanding, with traditional methods on fixed grids being ill-suited for tracking planet migration over long timescales due to their high cost and limited domain. In this work, we present a self-consistent comoving framework designed to overcome these challenges. Our method employs a coordinate transformation that scales with the planet's evolving semi-major axis, keeping the planet stationary with respect to its local computational grid. This transforms the standard hydrodynamic equations by introducing a source term that accounts for the inertial forces of the non-inertial reference frame. We implement this framework in the FARGO3D code and validate it through a benchmark test, demonstrating excellent agreement with conventional fixed-grid simulations until the latter are compromised by boundary effects. Our analysis shows that the comoving method can be over an order of magnitude more computationally efficient, dramatically reducing the cost of simulating migrating planets. Furthermore, the framework's adaptability enables efficient, high-resolution studies of planets on eccentric orbits by keeping them stationary within the computational grid. This framework serves as both a powerful numerical and theoretical tool, simplifying the time-dependent flow around a migrating planet that offers clearer physical insight. It enables long-term, self-consistent studies of planet-disk interaction, representing a crucial step towards performing planet-population synthesis based on full hydrodynamical simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 We evaluate the underlying assumptions for the identification of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) through near- and mid-infrared photometry and spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting out to z ~ 3. For massive galaxies, log(M) > 9.5, our high resolution spectra of the rest optical range generally confirm the results of SED fitting, which relies primarily on excesses above the stellar emission between 1 and 6 microns to identify AGN. However, the method is undermined if the redshift used for the SED fitting is incorrect. Low mass galaxies, log(M) < 9:5, can contain relatively warm dust that emits in the 4 - 6 micron range. We show that the potential contamination of AGN samples by purely star forming low-mass galaxies can be avoided by the use of the infrared properties of Haro 11 as a limiting star-forming SED template. However, relatively few star forming galaxies emit as strongly in the 3 - 6 micron range as this template, so this could result in missing some obscured AGNs to avoid a minor contamination. Including the behavior of the galaxies at rest lamda ~ 13.5 microns can mitigate this problem and yield more complete samples of bona fide AGN. JWST/MIRI supports this approach out to z ~ 0.6.
