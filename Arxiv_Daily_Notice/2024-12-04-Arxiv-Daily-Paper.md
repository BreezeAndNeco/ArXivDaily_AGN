 - **Abstract**
 We use the star formation rate-stellar mass relation ($SFR - {M_ * }$) of galaxies to measure their luminosity distances as well as estimate cosmological parameters. We obtain a sample of 341 high-redshift galaxies at $5 < z < 14$, and 51 others at $1.8 < z < 3.5$ from the JWST observations, which can be used to investigate the correlation between the star formation rate and stellar mass, and determine their cosmological distance. The relation $SFR \propto {\kern 1pt} {({M_ * }/{M_ \odot })^\gamma }$ can be applied to check the nonlinear correlation between the star formation rate and stellar mass ${M_ * }$ of galaxies and give their distance. On the other hand, it also can be used to test if the $SFR - {M_ * }$ relation depends on the absolute UV magnitude ${M_{UV}}$, and the data suggest that the $SFR $ is positively correlated with stellar mass, the $SFR - {M_ * }$ relation of the high-redshift galaxies has an absolute magnitude dependence. Finally, we apply a combination of galaxies and Type Ia supernova (SNIa) Pantheon to test the property of dark energy concerning whether or not its density deviates from the constant, and give the statistical results.

 - **Abstract**
 JWST has revealed a population of compact `Little Red Dots' (LRDs) at $z\gtrsim4$, with red rest-frame optical and blue UV colors. These objects are likely compact dusty starbursts or heavily reddened AGNs, playing a pivotal role in early black hole growth, dust production, and stellar assembly. We introduce a new photometric selection to identify LRDs over a broad range in redshifts and rest-frame UV-to-NIR colors enabling a more complete census of the population. This method identifies 248 LRDs with F444W$<27$ mag over 263 arcmin$^2$ in the JADES, PRIMER-COSMOS, and UDS fields with MIRI coverage, increasing the number density by $\times$1.7 compared to previous samples, suggesting that previous census were underestimated. Most LRDs are detected in MIRI/F770W but only 7% (17) are detected in F1800W. We use MIRI-based rest-frame [1$-$3 $\mu$m] colors to trace dust emission. F1800W-detected LRDs have a median [1$-$3 $\mu$m]$=1.5$ mag, with a broad scatter indicative of diverse dust emission properties. About 20% exhibit [1$-$3 $\mu$m]$<1$ mag colors consistent with negligible dust emission, but the majority show significant dust emission at 3 $\mu$m (f$^{\rm dust}_{3\mu m}\lesssim0.8$) from the galaxy ISM or a hot-dust-deficient AGN torus. A correlation between bluer UV-to-NIR colors and stronger IR emission suggests that the bluest LRDs may resemble unobscured QSOs. We report a LRD at $z_{\rm spec}=3.1386$, detected in MIRI, Spitzer/MIPS, and Herschel/PACS. Its IR SED rises steeply at $\lambda_{\rm rest}>6~\mu$m and peaks near $\sim40~\mu$m, providing the first direct evidence of warm dust emission (T$=50-100$ K) in a LRD.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmological analyses of redshift space clustering data are primarily based on using luminous ``red'' galaxies (LRGs) and ``blue'' emission line galaxies (ELGs) to trace underlying dark matter. Using the large high-fidelity high-resolution MillenniumTNG (MTNG) and Astrid simulations, we study these galaxies with the effective field theory (EFT)-based field level forward model. We confirm that both red and blue galaxies can be accurately modeled with EFT at the field level and their parameters match those of the phenomenological halo-based models. Specifically, we consider the state of the art Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) and High Mass Quenched (HMQ) models for the red and blue galaxies, respectively. Our results explicitly confirm the validity of the halo-based models on large scales beyond the two-point statistics. In addition, we validate the field-level HOD/HMQ-based priors for EFT full-shape analysis. We find that the local bias parameters of the ELGs are in tension with the predictions of the LRG-like HOD models and present a simple analytic argument explaining this phenomenology. We also confirm that ELGs exhibit weaker non-linear redshift-space distortions (``fingers-of-God''), suggesting that a significant fraction of their data should be perturbative. We find that the response of EFT parameters to galaxy selection is sensitive to assumptions about baryonic feedback, suggesting that a detailed understanding of feedback processes is necessary for robust predictions of EFT parameters. Finally, using neural density estimation based on paired HOD-EFT parameter samples, we obtain optimal HOD models that reproduce the clustering of Astrid and MTNG galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 Increasing the angular resolution of an interferometric array requires placing its elements at large separations. This often leads to sparse coverage and introduces challenges to reconstructing images from interferometric data. We introduce a new interferometric imaging algorithm, KRISP, that is based on kernel methods, is statistically robust, and is agnostic to the underlying image. The algorithm reconstructs the complete Fourier map up to the maximum observed baseline length based entirely on the data without tuning by a user or training on prior images and reproduces images with high fidelity. KRISP works efficiently for many sparse array configurations even in the presence of significant image structure as long as the typical baseline separation is comparable to or less than the correlation length of the Fourier map, which is inversely proportional to the size of the target image.

 - **Abstract**
 Significant mass loss in the red supergiant (RSG) phase has great influence on the evolution of massive stars and their final fate as supernovae. We present near-infrared interferometric imaging of the circumstellar environment of the dust-enshrouded RSG WOH G64 in the Large Magellanic Cloud. WOH G64 was observed with the GRAVITY instrument at ESO's Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) at 2.0--2.45 micron. We succeeded in imaging the innermost circumstellar environment of WOH G64 -- the first interferometric imaging of an RSG outside the Milky Way. The reconstructed image reveals elongated compact emission with a semimajor and semiminor axis of ~2 and ~1.5 mas (~13 and 9 stellar radii), respectively. The GRAVITY data show that the stellar flux contribution at 2.2 micron at the time of our observations in 2020 is much lower than predicted by the optically and geometrically thick dust torus model based on the VLTI/MIDI data taken in 2005 and 2007. We found a significant change in the near-infrared spectrum of WOH G64: while the (spectro)photometric data taken at 1--2.5 micron before 2003 show the spectrum of the central RSG with H2O absorption, the spectra and JHK' photometric data taken after 2016 are characterized by a monotonically rising continuum with very weak signatures of H2O. This spectral change likely took place between December 2009 and 2016. On the other hand, the mid-infrared spectrum obtained in 2022 with VLT/VISIR agrees well with the spectra obtained before 2007. The compact emission imaged with GRAVITY and the near-infrared spectral change suggest the formation of hot new dust close to the star, which gives rise to the monotonically rising near-infrared continuum and the high obscuration of the central star. The elongation of the emission may be due to the presence of a bipolar outflow or effects of an unseen companion.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of tidal disruption events (TDEs) on a timescale of years after the main flare show evidence of continued activity in the form of optical/UV emission, quasi-periodic eruptions, and delayed radio flares. Motivated by this, we explore the time evolution of these disks using semi-analytic models to follow the changing disk properties and feeding rate to the central black hole (BH). We find that thermal instabilities typically begin $\sim150-250\,{\rm days}$ after the TDE, causing the disk to cycle between high and low accretion states for up to $\sim10-20\,{\rm yrs}$. The high state is super-Eddington, which may be associated with outflows that eject $\sim10^{-3}-10^{-1}\,M_\odot$ with a range of velocities of $\sim0.03-0.3c$ over a span of a couple of days and produce radio flares. In the low state, the accretion rate slowly grows over many months to years as continued fallback accretion builds the mass of the disk. In this phase, the disk may reach luminosities of $\sim10^{41}-10^{42}\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$ in the UV as seen in some late-time observations. We highlight the importance of the iron-opacity "bump" at $\approx2\times10^5\,{\rm K}$ in generating sufficiently high luminosities. This work suggests that joint optical/UV observations with radio monitoring could be key for following the disk state as the radio flares are produced.

 - **Abstract**
 Binary black hole (BBH) evolution in the discs of active galactic nuclei (AGN) is a promising channel for gravitational wave (GW)-driven mergers. It is however unclear whether binaries interacting with the surrounding disc undergo orbital contraction or expansion. We develop a simple analytic model of accreting BBHs in AGN discs to follow the orbital evolution from the disc-dominated regime at large separations into the GW-driven regime at small separations (the coupled `disc+GW'-driven evolution). We obtain that accreting binaries expand in thick discs with aspect ratio greater than a critical value ($> h_\mathrm{crit}$); whereas accreting binaries contract and eventually merge in thin discs ($< h_\mathrm{crit}$). Interestingly, accreting BBHs can experience faster mergers compared to non-accreting counterparts, with a non-monotonic dependence on the disc aspect ratio. The orbital contraction is usually coupled with eccentricity growth in the disc-dominated regime, which lead to accelerated inspirals in the GW-driven regime. We quantify the resulting BBH merger timescales in AGN discs ($\tau_\mathrm{merger} \sim 10^5 - 10^7$ yr) and estimate the associated GW merger rates ($\mathcal{R} \sim (0.2 - 5) \, \text{Gpc}^{-3} \text{yr}^{-1}$). Overall, accreting binaries may efficiently contract and merge in thin discs, hence this particular BBH-in-AGN channel may provide a non-negligible contribution to the observed GW merger event rate.

 - **Abstract**
 Data derived from general relativistic MHD simulations of accretion onto black holes can be used as input to a post-processing scheme that predicts the radiated spectrum. Combining a relativistic Compton-scattering radiation transfer solution in the corona with detailed local atmosphere solutions incorporating local ionization and thermal balance within the disk photosphere, it is possible to study both spectral formation and intrinsic spectral variability in the radiation from relativistic accretion disks. With this method, we find that radiatively-efficient systems with black holes of $10M_\odot$ accreting at $\approx 0.01$ in Eddington units produce spectra very similar to those observed in the hard states of X-ray binaries. The spectral shape above 10keV is well-described by a power-law with an exponential cutoff. Intrinsic turbulent variations lead to order-unity fluctuations in bolometric luminosity, logarithmic spectral slope fluctuations over a range $\approx 0.15$, and factor of 2 changes in the cut-off energy on timescales $\sim 50\, (M_{\rm BH}/10 M_\odot)$ms. Within the corona, the range of gas temperature spans more than an order of magnitude. The wide distribution of temperatures is central to defining the spectrum: the logarithmic spectral slope is harder by $\sim 0.3$ and the cut-off energy larger by a factor $\sim 10 - 30$ than if the coronal temperature everywhere were its mass-weighted mean.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar filaments are spectacular objects in the solar atmosphere, consisting of accumulations of cool, dense, and partially ionized plasma suspended in the hot solar corona against gravity. The magnetic structures that support the filament material remain elusive, partly due to the lack of high resolution magnetic field measurements in the chromosphere and corona. In this study, we reconstruct the magnetic structures of a solar intermediate filament using EUV observations and two different methods, to follow the injection of hot material from a B-class solar flare. Our analysis reveals the fine-scale magnetic structures of the filament, including a compact set of mutually wrapped magnetic fields encasing the cool filament material, two groups of helical magnetic structures intertwining with the main filament, and a series of arched magnetic loops positioned along the filament. Additionally, we also find that the northern footpoints of the helical structures are rooted in the same location, while their southern footpoints are rooted in different areas. The results obtained in this study offer new insights into the formation and eruption mechanisms of solar filaments.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the spectroscopic analysis of ten satellite galaxy candidates in the sphere of influence of the Sombrero galaxy (M104, NGC4594), based on data obtained with IFUM (Integral Field Units for Magellan). Based on their newly-observed recessional velocities, we confirm that nine of these candidates are satellite galaxies of M104, with one being a background dwarf galaxy. All ten dwarfs have stellar masses $2\times10^{7}\,M_{\odot}$ to $1\times10^{9}\,M_{\odot}$ and mean weighted metallicities $-1.7<\langle{[\mathrm{M/H}]}\rangle<-0.3$. Although these dwarfs are predominantly old, with stellar populations $\sim5-11\,$Gyr. However, this sample contains a local example of a low-mass "Green Pea" candidate, it exhibits extreme optical emission features and broad emission line features ($\sigma\sim250\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$) reminiscent of high-redshift Ly$\alpha$/LyC photon leaking galaxies. Using the newly-acquired recessional velocities of the nine satellites of M104, we find no evidence of coherent satellite motions unlike other nearby $L_*$ galaxy environments. Given the small sample, this results does not statistically rule out such coherent motions. There remain 60 satellite candidates of M104 for which future spectroscopy can more reliably test for such motion. Using the observed dwarf galaxies as tracers of the gravitational potential of M104, we estimate the dynamical mass of M104, $M_{dyn}=(12.4\pm6.5)\times10^{12}M_{\odot}$, and find that, making a reasonable estimate of M104's gas mass, $>90\%$ of its baryons are missing. These results agree with previous measurements of M104's dynamical mass.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar-mass black holes descend from high-mass stars, most of which had stellar binary companions. However, the number of those binary systems that survive the binary evolution and black hole formation is uncertain by multiple orders of magnitude. The survival rate is particularly uncertain for massive stars with low-mass companions, which are thought to be the progenitors of most black hole X-ray binaries. We present a search for close black hole companions (separations less than 20 solar radii) to AFGK-type stars in TESS, i.e. the non-accreting counterparts to and progenitors of low-mass X-ray binaries. Such black holes can be detected by the tidally induced ellipsoidal deformation of the visible star, and the ensuing photometric light-curve variations. From an initial sample of 4.7 million TESS stars, we have selected 457 candidates for such variations. However, spectroscopic followup of 251 of them shows that none are consistent with a close black hole companion. On the basis of this non-detection, we determine (2 $\sigma$ confidence) that fewer than one in $10^5$ Solar-type stars in the Solar neighbourhood host a short-period black hole companion. This upper limit is in tension with a number of ``optimistic'' population models in the literature that predict short-period black hole companions around one in $10^{4-5}$ stars. Our limits are still consistent with other models that predict only a few in $10^{7-8}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Super-Alfvenic turbulence is important for many astrophysical objects, particularly galaxy clusters. In this paper, we explore the accuracy of Synchrotron Intensity Gradients (SIGs) and X-ray intensity gradients to map magnetic fields in super-Alfvenic turbulence for a set of astrophysically relevant parameters of turbulent driving. Analyzing our synthetic observations, we report a good accuracy for both techniques. Our results are suggestive that other types of Gradient Technique (GT) can be successfully employed to trace magnetic fields within super-Alfvenic sub-sonic turbulence.

 - **Abstract**
 Current reverberation mapping (RM) studies primarily focus on single emission lines, particularly the \hb\ line, which may not fully reveal the geometry and kinematic properties of the broad-line region (BLR). To overcome this limitation, we conducted multiline RM observations on two highly variable active galactic nuclei (AGNs), KUG 1141+371 and UGC 3374, using the Lijiang 2.4 m telescope. Our goal was to investigate the detailed structure of different regions within the BLR. We measured the time lags of multiple broad emission lines (\ha, \hb, \hg, \hei, and \heii) and found clear evidence of radial ionization stratification in the BLRs of both AGNs. Velocity-resolved RM analysis revealed distinct geometry and kinematics between the inner and outer regions of the BLRs. Assuming that velocity-resolved lags reflect the kinematics of BLR, our observations indicate that: (1) in KUG 1141+371, the inner BLR exhibits outflow signatures, while the outer region is consistent with virialized motion; (2) in UGC 3374, the inner region displays virial motion, while the outer region shows inflow. Furthermore, we detected ``breathing" behavior in the outer BLR regions of both AGN, while the inner BLR regions show ``anti-breathing", which may be linked to intrinsic BLR properties. We discuss these findings in the context of various BLR formation models, highlighting importance of long-term, multiline RM campaigns in understanding of BLR structure and evolution. Additionally, our results suggest that the observed stratification in BLR geometry and kinematics may contribute to the scatter in black hole mass estimates and the rapid changes in velocity-resolved RM signatures reported in recent studies.

 - **Abstract**
 We conduct the first-ever Pulsar Polarization Array (PPA) analysis to detect the ultralight Axion-Like Dark Matter (ALDM) using the polarization data of 22 millisecond pulsars from the third data release of Parkes Pulsar Timing Array. As one of the major dark matter candidates, the ultralight ALDM exhibits a pronounced wave nature on astronomical scales and offers a promising solution to small-scale structure issues within local galaxies. While the linearly polarized pulsar light travels through the ALDM galactic halo, its position angle (PA) can be subject to an oscillation induced by the ALDM Chern-Simons coupling with electromagnetic field. The PPA is thus especially suited for detecting the ultralight ALDM by correlating polarization data across the arrayed pulsars. To accomplish this task, we develop an advanced Bayesian analysis framework that allows us to construct pulsar PA residual time series, model noise contributions properly and search for pulsar cross-correlations. We find that for an ALDM density of $\rho_0=0.4\,\textrm{GeV}/\textrm{cm}^3$, the Parkes PPA offers the best global limits on the ALDM Chern-Simons coupling, namely $\lesssim 10^{-13.5}-10^{-12.2}~{\rm GeV}^{-1}$, for the mass range of $10^{-22} - 10^{-21}~{\rm eV}$. The crucial role of pulsar cross-correlation in recognizing the nature of the derived limits is also highlighted.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultra-light axion-like particles (ALPs) can be a viable solution to the dark matter problem. The scalar field associated with ALPs, coupled to the electromagnetic field, acts as an active birefringent medium, altering the polarisation properties of light through which it propagates. In particular, oscillations of the axionic field induce monochromatic variations of the plane of linearly polarised radiation of astrophysical signals. The radio emission of millisecond pulsars provides an excellent tool to search for such manifestations, given their high fractional linear polarisation and negligible fluctuations of their polarisation properties. We have searched for the evidence of ALPs in the polarimetry measurements of pulsars collected and preprocessed for the European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA) campaign. Focusing on the twelve brightest sources in linear polarisation, we searched for an astrophysical signal from axions using both frequentist and Bayesian statistical frameworks. For the frequentist analysis, which uses Lomb-Scargle periodograms at its core, no statistically significant signal has been found. The model used for the Bayesian analysis has been adjusted to accommodate multiple deterministic systematics that may be present in the data. A statistically significant signal has been found in the dataset of multiple pulsars with common frequency between $10^{-8}$ Hz and $2\times10^{-8}$ Hz, which can most likely be explained by the residual Faraday rotation in the terrestrial ionosphere. Strong bounds on the coupling constant $g_{a\gamma}$, in the same ballpark as other searches, have been obtained in the mass range between $6\times10^{-24}$ eV and $5\times10^{-21}$ eV. We conclude by discussing problems that can limit the sensitivity of our search for ultra-light axions in the polarimetry data of pulsars, and possible ways to resolve them.

 - **Abstract**
 Rotation-powered pulsars represent the main class of identified gamma-ray sources in the Galaxy. The wealth of observational data collected by the AGILE and Fermi gamma-ray space telescopes in the GeV range, and by ground-based Cherenkov telescopes in the TeV band provide invaluable insights into how relativistic plasmas dissipate and accelerate particles. Decoding the information contained in the gamma-ray pulses profile is an important step to understand how pulsars work. In this study, we aim at putting an ab initio plasma model of pulsar magnetospheres to the test, in light of the most recent gamma-ray observations in the GeV and TeV bands. To this end, we present of a new series of global particle-in-cell simulations of an inclined pulsar magnetosphere. High-quality synthetic pulse profiles in the synchrotron and inverse Compton channels are reconstructed to study in greater details their morphology and their energy dependence. We also perform a fit of observed lightcurves with the model, using the third Fermi-LAT gamma-ray pulsar catalog. Reconnection in the wind current sheet powers synchrotron and inverse Compton emission. The modeled pulse profiles reproduce some of the salient features of observed gamma-ray pulsars, including the mysterious Vela-like lightcurves, such as: the generic double-peaked structure, the presence of a bridge or third peak in between the main pulses, the pulse narrowing with increasing energy. The bolometric synchrotron radiative efficiency is strictly limited by the reconnection rate. Our global kinetic simulations are able to match observed pulse profiles. Such direct comparisons will help drive and focus future simulation developments.

 - **Abstract**
 We compare two candidate nonlinearities for regulating the solar cycle within the Babcock-Leighton paradigm: tilt quenching (whereby the tilt of active regions is reduced in stronger cycles) and latitude quenching (whereby flux emerges at higher latitudes in stronger solar cycles). Digitized historical observations are used to build a database of individual magnetic plage regions from 1923 to 1985. The regions are selected by thresholding in Ca II K synoptic maps, with polarities constrained using Mount Wilson Observatory sunspot measurements. The resulting data show weak evidence for tilt quenching, but much stronger evidence for latitude-quenching. Further, we use proxy observations of the polar field from faculae to construct a best-fit surface flux transport model driven by our database of emerging regions. A better fit is obtained when the sunspot measurements are used, compared to a reference model where all polarities are filled using Hale's Law. The optimization suggests clearly that the "dynamo effectivity range" of the Sun during this period should be less than 10 degrees; this is also consistent with latitude quenching being dominant over tilt quenching.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of LAMOST J171013.211+532646.04 (hereafter J1710), a binary system comprising a hot subdwarf B star (sdB) and a white dwarf (WD) companion. Multi-epoch spectroscopy reveals an orbital period of 109.20279 minutes, consistent with TESS and ZTF photometric data, marking it as the sixth detached system known to harbor a WD companion with a period less than two hours. J1710 is remarkably close to Earth, situated at a distance of only \(350.68^{+4.20}_{-4.21} \, \mathrm{pc}\), with a GAIA G-band magnitude of 12.59, rendering it conducive for continuous observations. The spectral temperature is around 25164 K, in agreement with SED fitting results (\(25301^{+839}_{-743} \, \mathrm{K}\)). The TESS light curve displays ellipsoidal variation and Doppler beaming without eclipsing features. Through fitting the TESS light curve using the Wilson-Devinney code, we determined the masses for the sdB (\(M_1 = 0.44^{+0.06}_{-0.07} \, M_{\odot}\)) and the compact object (\(M_2 = 0.54^{+0.10}_{-0.07} \, M_{\odot}\)), with the compact object likely being a WD. Furthermore, MESA models suggest that the sdB, with a helium core mass of 0.431 \(M_{\odot}\) and a hydrogen envelope mass of \(1.3 \times 10^{-3}\, M_{\odot}\), is in the early helium main-sequence phase. The MESA binary evolution shows that the J1710 system is expected to evolve into a double white dwarf system, making it an important source of low-frequency gravitational waves.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Radio galaxies with visible two-sided jet structures, such as NGC 1052, are sources of particular interest to study the collimation and shock structure of active galactic nuclei jets. High-resolution very-long-baseline interferometry observations of such sources can resolve and study the jet collimation profile and probe different physical mechanisms. Aims. In this paper, we study the physics of double-sided radio sources at parsec scales, and in particular investigate whether propagating shocks can give rise to the observed asymmetry between jet and counterjet. Methods. We carry out special relativistic hydrodynamic simulations and perform radiative transfer calculations of an over-pressured perturbed jet. During the radiative transfer calculations we incorporate both thermal and nonthermal emission while taking the finite speed of light into account. To further compare our results to observations, we create more realistic synthetic data including the properties of the observing array as well as the image reconstruction via multifrequency regularized maximum likelihood methods. We finally introduce a semi-automatized method for tracking jet components and extracting jet kinematics. Results. We show that propagating shocks in an inherently symmetric double-sided jet can lead to partially asymmetric jet collimation profiles due to time delay effects and relativistic beaming. These asymmetries may appear on specific epochs, with one jet evolving near conically and the other one parabolically (width profile evolving with a slope of 1 and 0.5, respectively). However, these spurious asymmetries are not significant when observing the source evolve for an extended amount of time. Conclusions. Purely observational effects are not enough to explain a persisting asymmetry in the jet collimation profile of double-sided jet sources and hint at evidence for asymmetrically launched jets.

 - **Abstract**
 After a merger of two massive black holes (MBHs), the remnant receives a gravitational wave (GW) recoil kick that can have a strong effect on its future evolution. The magnitude of the kick ($v_\mathrm{recoil}$) depends on the mass ratio and the alignment of the spins and orbital angular momenta, therefore on the previous evolution of the MBHs. We investigate the cosmic effect of GW recoil by running for the first time a high-resolution cosmological simulation including GW recoil that depends on the MBH spins (evolved through accretion and mergers), masses and dynamics computed self-consistently. We also run a twin simulation without GW recoil. The simulations are run down to $z=4.4$. We find that GW recoil reduces the growth of merger remnants, and can have a significant effect on the MBH-galaxy correlations and the merger rate. We find large recoil kicks across all galaxy masses in the simulation, up to a few $10^{11}\,\rm M_\odot$. The effect of recoil can be significant even if the MBHs are embedded in a rotationally supported gaseous structure. We investigate the dynamics of recoiling MBHs and find that MBHs remain in the centre of the host galaxy for low $v_\mathrm{recoil}/v_\mathrm{esc}$ and escape rapidly for high $v_\mathrm{recoil}/v_\mathrm{esc}$. Only if $v_\mathrm{recoil}$ is comparable to $v_\mathrm{esc}$ the MBHs escape the central region of the galaxy but might remain as wandering MBHs until the end of the simulation. Recoiling MBHs are a significant fraction of the wandering MBH population. Although the dynamics of recoiling MBHs may be complex, some retain their initial radial orbits but are difficult to discern from other wandering MBHs on radial orbits. Others scatter with the halo substructure or circularise in the asymmetric potential. Our work highlights the importance of including GW recoil in cosmological simulation models.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a catalogue of photometric redshifts for galaxies from DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys, which includes $\sim0.18$ billion sources covering 14,000 ${\rm deg}^2$. The photometric redshifts, along with their uncertainties, are estimated through galaxy images in three optical bands ($g$, $r$ and $z$) from DESI and two near-infrared bands ($W1$ and $W2$) from WISE using a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN). The training of BNN is performed by above images and their corresponding spectroscopic redshifts given in DESI Early Data Release (EDR). Our results show that categorizing galaxies into individual groups based on their inherent characteristics and estimating their photo-$z$s within their group separately can effectively improve the performance. Specifically, the galaxies are categorized into four distinct groups based on DESI's target selection criteria: Bright Galaxy Sample (BGS), Luminous Red Galaxies (LRG), Emission Line Galaxies (ELG) and a group comprising the remaining sources, referred to as NON. As measured by outliers of $|\Delta z| > 0.15 (1 + z_{\rm true})$, accuracy $\sigma_{\rm NMAD}$ and mean uncertainty $\overline{E}$ for BNN, we achieve low outlier percentage, high accuracy and low uncertainty: 0.14%, 0.018 and 0.0212 for BGS and 0.45%, 0.026 and 0.0293 for LRG respectively, surpassing results without categorization. However, the photo-$z$s for ELG cannot be reliably estimated, showing result of $>15\%$, $\sim0.1$ and $\sim0.1$ irrespective of training strategy. On the other hand, NON sources can reach 1.9%, 0.039 and 0.0445 when a magnitude cut of $z<21.3$ is applied. Our findings demonstrate that estimating photo-$z$s directly from galaxy images is significantly potential, and to achieve high-quality photo-$z$ measurement for ongoing and future large-scale imaging survey, it is sensible to implement categorization of sources based on their characteristics.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding how galaxies form and evolve is at the heart of modern astronomy. With the advent of large-scale surveys and simulations, remarkable progress has been made in the last few decades. Despite this, the physical processes behind the phenomena, and particularly their importance, remain far from known, as correlations have primarily been established rather than the underlying causality. We address this challenge by applying the causal inference framework. Specifically, we tackle the fundamental open question of whether galaxy formation and evolution depends more on nature (i.e., internal processes) or nurture (i.e., external processes), by estimating the causal effect of environment on star-formation rate in the IllustrisTNG simulations. To do so, we develop a comprehensive causal model and employ cutting-edge techniques from epidemiology to overcome the long-standing problem of disentangling nature and nurture. We find that the causal effect is negative and substantial, with environment suppressing the SFR by a maximal factor of $\sim100$. While the overall effect at $z=0$ is negative, in the early universe, environment is discovered to have a positive impact, boosting star formation by a factor of $\sim10$ at $z\sim1$ and by even greater amounts at higher redshifts. Furthermore, we show that: (i) nature also plays an important role, as ignoring it underestimates the causal effect in intermediate-density environments by a factor of $\sim2$, (ii) controlling for the stellar mass at a snapshot in time, as is common in the literature, is not only insufficient to disentangle nature and nurture but actually has an adverse effect, though (iii) stellar mass is an adequate proxy of the effects of nature. Finally, this work may prove a useful blueprint for extracting causal insights in other fields that deal with dynamical systems with closed feedback loops, such as the Earth's climate.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations reveal a rapid dust build-up in high-redshift galaxies (z > 4), challenging current models of galaxy formation. While our understanding of dust production and destruction in the interstellar medium (ISM) is advancing, probing baryonic processes in the early Universe remains a complex task. We characterize the evolution of 98 z~5 star-forming galaxies observed as part of the ALPINE survey by constraining the physical processes underpinning the gas and dust production, consumption, and destruction in their ISM. We make use of chemical evolution models to simultaneously reproduce the observed dust and gas content. For each galaxy, we estimate initial gas mass, inflows and outflows, and efficiencies of dust growth and destruction. We test the models with the canonical Chabrier and top-heavy initial mass functions (IMFs), with the latter enabling rapid dust production on shorter timescales. Our models successfully reproduce gas and dust content in older galaxies (> 600 Myr) regardless of the IMF, with Type II SNe as the primary dust source and no dust growth in ISM with moderate inflow of primordial gas. In case of intermediate-age galaxies (300 - 600 Myr), we reproduce the gas and dust content through Type II SNe and dust growth in ISM, though we observe an over-prediction of dust mass in older galaxies, potentially indicating an unaccounted dust destruction mechanism and/or an overestimation of the observed dust masses. The number of young galaxies (< 300 Myr) reproduced, increases for models assuming top-heavy IMF but with maximal prescriptions of dust production. Galactic outflows are necessary to reproduce observed gas and dust masses. The Chabrier IMF models reproduce 65% of galaxies, while top-heavy IMF models improve this to 93%, easing tensions with observations. Upcoming JWST data will refine these models by resolving degeneracies in intrinsic galaxy properties.

 - **Abstract**
 The precise measurement of the sky-averaged HI absorption signal between 50 and 200 MHz is the primary goal of global 21-cm cosmology. This measurement has the potential to unravel the underlying physics of cosmic structure formation and evolution during the Cosmic Dawn. It is, however, hindered by various non-smooth, frequency-dependent effects, whose structures resemble those of the signal. One such effect is the leakage of polarised foregrounds into the measured intensity signal: polarised foreground emission undergoes Faraday rotation as it passes through the magnetic fields of the interstellar medium, imprinting a chromatic structure in the relevant frequency range which complicates the extraction of the cosmological HI absorption feature. We investigate the effect of polarised Galactic foregrounds on extracting the global 21-cm signal from simulated data using REACH's data analysis pipeline; the Radio Experiment for the Analysis of Cosmic Hydrogen (REACH) is an experiment designed to detect the sky-averaged 21-cm HI signal from the early Universe using physically informed models. Using the REACH pipeline, we successfully recover an injected global 21-cm signal with an amplitude of approximately 0.16 K, centred between 80 and 120 MHz, achieving a low root-mean-square error (less than 30\% of the injected signal strength) in all the tested cases. This includes scenarios with simulated polarised Galactic diffuse emissions and polarised point source emissions, provided the overall polarisation fraction is below $\sim 3\%$. The linear mixing of contamination, caused by the superposition of multiple patches with varying strengths of Faraday rotation, produces patterns that are more distinct from the global signal. This distinction makes global signal recovery easier compared to contamination resulting from a single, slow oscillation pattern.

 - **Abstract**
 [Abridged] Our view of dust in primordial galaxies is limited towards a few tens of z~7 galaxies, pre-selected from UV-optical observations, and are thus not necessarily representative of the bulk of the sources at these redshifts. In this work, we aim at constraining the dust properties of galaxies at 6<z<12 by making the most of the A3COSMOS database in the JADES/GOODS-South field. We stacked ALMA band 6 and 7 observations of 4464 galaxies covered by the A3COSMOS database and used the measurements as constraints to perform UV-to-FIR SED modelling. We obtain tentative signals for the brightest UV galaxies (MUV<-19mag) as well as for the most massive ones (log Mstar>9) at 6<z<7, and upper limits for fainter (MUV>-19mag), lower mass sources (log Mstar<9), and at higher redshift (z>7). Fitting these 6<z<7 galaxies with ALMA constraints results in lower star formation rates (-0.4dex) and FUV attenuation (-0.5mag) for galaxies with log Mstar>8, compared to the fit without FIR. We extend the LIR vs MUV relation down to MUV=-19mag and show a tentative breakdown of the relation at fainter UV magnitudes. The positions of the JADES z~6.5 sample on the IRX versus beta and IRX versus Mstar diagrams are consistent with those of the ALPINE (z~5.5) and REBELS (z~6.5) samples, suggesting that the dust composition and content of our mass-selected sample are similar to these UV-selected galaxies. Extending our analysis of the infrared properties to z>7 galaxies, we find a non-evolution of beta with redshift in the MUV range probed by our sample (-17.24+/-0.62) and highlight the fact that samples from the literature are not representative of the bulk of galaxy populations at z>6. We confirm a linear relation between AV and 1/sSFR with a flatter slope than previously reported due to the use of ALMA constraints. Our results suggest that rapid and significant dust production has already happened by z~7.

 - **Abstract**
 Robust inference of galaxy stellar masses from photometry is crucial for constraints on galaxy assembly across cosmic time. Here, we test a commonly-used Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) fitting code, using simulated galaxies from the SPHINX20 cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulation, with JWST NIRCam photometry forward-modelled with radiative transfer. Fitting the synthetic photometry with various star formation history models, we show that recovered stellar masses are, encouragingly, generally robust to within a factor of ~3 for galaxies in the range M*~10^7-10^9M_sol at z=5-10. These results are in stark contrast to recent work claiming that stellar masses can be underestimated by as much as an order of magnitude in these mass and redshift ranges. However, while >90% of masses are recovered to within 0.5dex, there are notable systematic trends, with stellar masses typically overestimated for low-mass galaxies (M*<~10^8M_sol) and slightly underestimated for high-mass galaxies (M*>~10^9M_sol). We demonstrate that these trends arise due to the SED fitting code poorly modelling the impact of strong emission lines on broadband photometry. These systematic trends, which exist for all star formation history parametrisations tested, have a tilting effect on the inferred stellar mass function, with number densities of massive galaxies underestimated (particularly at the lowest redshifts studied) and number densities of lower-mass galaxies typically overestimated. Overall, this work suggests that we should be optimistic about our ability to infer the masses of high-z galaxies observed with JWST (notwithstanding contamination from AGN) but careful when modelling the impact of strong emission lines on broadband photometry.

 - **Abstract**
 A multi-wavelength, multi-scale study of the Mon R2 hub-filament system (HFS) reveals a spiral structure, with the central hub containing more mass than its filaments. ALMA C$^{18}$O(1-0) emission reveals several accreting filaments connected to a molecular ring (size $\sim$0.18 pc $\times$ 0.26 pc). The molecular ring surrounds the infrared (IR) ring (size $\sim$0.12 pc $\times$ 0.16 pc), which is not usually observed. The IR ring encircles IR dark regions and a population of embedded near-IR sources, including the massive stars IRS 1 and IRS 2. ALMA HNC(3-2) line data reveal a mirrored B-shaped feature (extent $\sim$19000 AU $\times$ 39000 AU) toward the eastern part of the molecular ring, suggesting expansion at $\sim$2.25 km s$^{-1}$. Distinct HNC sub-structures in both redshifted and blueshifted velocity components are investigated toward the B-shaped feature. The presence of these braid-like substructures in each velocity component strongly suggests instability in photon-dominated regions. A dusty shell-like feature (extent $\sim$0.04 pc $\times$ 0.07 pc; mass $\sim$7 M$_{\odot}$) hosting IRS 1 is identified in the ALMA 1.14 mm continuum map, centered toward the base of the B-shaped feature. The IR and dense molecular rings are likely shaped by feedback from massive stars, driven by high pressure values between 10$^{-8}$-10$^{-10}$ dynes cm$^{-2}$, observed within a 1 pc range of the B0 ZAMS star powering the ultracompact HII region. Overall, these outcomes support that the Mon R2 HFS transitioned from IR-quiet to IR-bright, driven by the interaction between gas accretion and feedback from massive stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Metallicity plays a crucial role in the evolution of massive stars and their final core-collapse supernova (CCSN) explosions. Integral-field-unit (IFU) spectroscopy can provide a spatially resolved view of SN host galaxies and serve as a powerful tool to study SN metallicities. Early transient surveys targeted bright galaxies with high star formation and SN rates; as a result, the discovered SNe are significantly biased toward high metallicities. More recently, the untargeted, wide-field transient surveys, such as ASAS-SN and ZTF, have discovered a large number of SNe without such a bias. In this work, we construct a large and unbiased sample of SNe discovered by (quasi-) untargted searches, consisting of 209 SNe of Types II (with unknown subtypes), IIP, IIn, IIb, Ib and Ic at z $\leq$ 0.02 with VLT/MUSE observations. This is currently the largest CCSN sample with IFU observations. With the strong-line method, we reveal the spatially-resolved metallicity maps of the SN host galaxies and acquire accurate metallicity measurements for the SN sites. Our results show that the SN metallicities range from 12 + log(O/H) = 8.1 to 8.7 dex, and the metallicity distributions for different SN types are very close to each other, with mean and median values of 8.4 - 8.5 dex. We carefully analysed the stochastic sampling effect, showing that our large sample size narrows the 1$\sigma$ uncertainty down to only 0.05 dex. The apparent metallicity differences among SN types are all within 3$\sigma$ uncertainties and the metallicity distributions for different SN types are all consistent with being randomly drawn from the same reference distribution. This suggests that metallicity plays a minor role in the origin of different CCSN types and some other metallicity-insensitive processes, such as binary interaction, dominate the distinction of CCSN types.

 - **Abstract**
 Observational campaigns hunting the elusive reservoirs of cold gas in the host galaxies of quasars at the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) are crucial to study the formation and evolution of the first massive systems at early epochs. We present new Northern Extended Millimetre Array (NOEMA) observations tracing CO(6--5), CO(7--6) emission lines, and the underlying continuum in five of the eight quasars at redshift $z>7$ known to date, thus completing the survey of the cold molecular gas reservoir in the host galaxies of the first quasars. Combining NOEMA observations with archival Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) data available, we model the far-infrared spectral energy distribution with a modified blackbody to measure dust properties and star formation rates. We use CO and [CII] lines to derive molecular gas masses, which we compare with results from semi-analytical models and observations of galaxies at different epochs. No statistically significant detection of CO emission lines was reported for the five quasars in this sample, resulting in a relatively low amount of cold molecular gas in the host when compared with galaxies at later epochs. Nonetheless, gas-to-dust ratios are consistent with the local value, suggesting that the scaling relation between dust and cold gas holds up to $z>7$. Quasars at the EoR show star formation efficiencies which are among the highest observed so far, but comparable with that observed in luminous quasar at Cosmic Noon and that predicted for the brightest ($L_{bol}>3\times10^{46}$ erg s$^{-1}$) quasar objects drawn from the semi-analytical model GAEA. Quasar host galaxies at the EoR are undergoing an intense phase of star formation, which suggests a strong coupling between the luminous phase of the quasar and the rapid growth of the host.

 - **Abstract**
 In the last decade, we have been able to probe further down the galaxy luminosity function than ever before and expand into the regime of ultra-faint dwarfs (UFDs), which are some of the best probes we have of small-scale cosmology and galaxy formation. Digital sky surveys have enabled the discovery and study of these incredibly low-mass, highly dark-matter dominated systems around the Local Group, but it is critical that we expand the satellite census further out to understand if Milky Way and M31 satellites are representative of dwarf populations in the local Universe. Using data from HST/ACS, we present updated characterization of four satellite systems in the M81 group. These systems - D1005+68, D1006+69, DWJ0954+6821, and D1009+68 - were previously discovered using ground-based Subaru HSC data as overdensities in M81's halo and are now confirmed with HST/ACS by this work. These are all faint (M_V >= -7.9) and consistent with old (~13 Gyr), metal-poor ([M/H] < -1.5) populations. Each system possesses relatively unusual features - including one of the most concentrated satellite galaxies with a Sersic index of n ~ 5, one of the most elliptical galaxies outside the Local Group with an e ~ 0.6, and one of the most compact galaxies for its magnitude. Two of the satellites have very low surface brightness, lower than most known galaxies in this absolute magnitude range. This work previews the scientific promise of the upcoming Rubin Observatory and Roman Telescope for illuminating the diversity of UFDs in the Local Volume and beyond.
