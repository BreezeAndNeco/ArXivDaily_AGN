#### Hybrid Approaches for Black Hole Spin Estimation: From Classical Spectroscopy to Physics-Informed Machine Learning

 - **Abstract**
 The measurement of black hole spin is considered one of the key problems in relativistic astrophysics. Existing methods, such as continuum fitting, X-ray reflection spectroscopy, and quasi-periodic oscillation analysis, suffer from limitations in accuracy, interpretability, and scalability. In this work, a hybrid approach is proposed in which theoretical models based on the Teukolsky formalism are integrated with Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). A PINN model is developed to solve the linearized spin problem in the scalar case, with physical constraints directly embedded into the training process. Annotated data are not required; instead, the model is trained using the differential operator and boundary conditions as supervision. It is demonstrated that the PINN converges reliably, with residual loss values below 10 and a root mean squared error (RMSE) on the order of $10^{-7}$. Benchmarking results indicate that the proposed method outperforms both classical and data-driven machine learning approaches in terms of AUC and sensitivity, while also exhibiting superior interpretability, generalizability, and adherence to physical principles, with moderate computational cost. Potential extensions include integration with general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) solvers and application to real observational data. These findings support the viability of physics-based machine learning as a robust framework for accurate and interpretable black hole spin estimation.

 - **Abstract**
 We describe the second data release (DR2) of the FIRE-2 cosmological zoom-in simulations of galaxy formation, from the Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE) project, available at this http URL. DR2 includes all snapshots for most simulations, starting at z ~ 99, with all snapshot time spacings <~ 25 Myr. The Core suite -- comprising 14 Milky Way-mass galaxies, 5 SMC/LMC-mass galaxies, and 4 lower-mass galaxies -- includes 601 snapshots to z = 0. For the Core suite, we also release resimulations with physics variations: (1) dark-matter-only versions; (2) a modified ultraviolet background with later reionization at z = 7.8; (3) magnetohydrodynamics, anisotropic conduction, and viscosity in gas; and (4) a model for cosmic-ray injection, transport, and feedback (assuming a constant diffusion coefficient). The Massive Halo suite now includes 8 massive galaxies with 278 snapshots to z = 1. The High Redshift suite includes 34 simulations: in addition to the 22 simulations run to z = 5, we now include 12 additional simulations run to z = 7 and z = 9. Most simulations include catalogs of (sub)halos and galaxies at all available snapshots, and most Core simulations to z = 0 include full halo merger trees.
#### Towards Accurate Asteroseismic Masses for Luminous Giants

 - **Abstract**
 Asteroseismology, the study of stellar oscillations, provides high-precision measurements of masses and ages for red giants. Scaling relations are a powerful tool for measuring fundamental stellar parameters, and the derived radii are in good agreement with fundamental data for low-luminosity giants. However, for luminous red giant branch (RGB) stars, there are clear systematic offsets. In APOKASC-3, the third joint spectroscopic and asteroseismic catalog for evolved stars in the Kepler fields, we tied asteroseismic radii to a reference system based on Gaia astrometry by introducing correction factors. This work proposes an alternative formulation of the correction scheme, which substantially reduces the sensitivity of the results to the technique used to infer mean density from frequency spacings. Compared to APOKASC-3, our adjusted correction scheme also reduces fractional discrepancies in median masses and ages of lower RGB and upper RGB within the $\alpha$-rich population from $6.65\%$ to $1.72\%$ and from $-21.81\%$ to $-9.55\%$, respectively. For the $\alpha$-poor population, the corrected mass scale leads to an improved agreement between theory and observation of the surface carbon-to-nitrogen abundance ratio, a significant diagnostic of the first dredge-up.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the optical variability characteristics of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) from the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) AGN catalogue by utilising approximately five years of optical light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) survey. We investigate dependencies of the long-term optical variability amplitudes and timescales on (i) supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass, luminosity, and Eddington ratio to explore the influence of accretion disk dynamics and radiative processes; (ii) X-ray properties, such as spectral photon indices and fluxes, to study the effect of high-energy emission mechanisms; and (iii) radio characteristics, such as integrated fluxes and radio loudness, which indicate jet activity. Our findings confirm a positive correlation between the variability time scale and both the SMBH mass and luminosity, suggesting that these physical parameters significantly impact the optical variability timescale. Conversely, no significant dependence is found between optical variability and X-ray properties, indicating that high-energy processes may not substantially influence long-term optical variability. Additionally, a weak anti-correlation between optical variability and radio parameters suggests that jet activity has a negligible effect on causing long-term AGN variability. These results support the hypothesis that long-term optical variability in AGN is primarily governed by thermal emission from the accretion disk. Further investigations with larger samples are essential to refine these correlations and develop robust physical models integrating black hole properties, accretion disk physics, and multi-wavelength radiative transfer.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational lensing of short astrophysical transients provides a uniquely direct avenue for searching for primordial black holes (PBHs) across a vast range of masses. While past search efforts have focused on particular source classes-such as fast radio bursts (FRBs) and gamma-ray burst spikes-no systematic, multi-wavelength survey has compared their relative potential for PBH discovery. We present here a broad assessment of transient lensing search opportunities, spanning more than twenty decades in photon frequency and over twelve orders of magnitude in PBH mass. For each class, we determine the accessible PBH mass window by accounting for wave-optics suppression and time-delay resolution limits, and we estimate potential sensitivities to the PBH abundance using representative event rates, distances, and optical depths. Our survey includes low-frequency radio events (FRBs, pulsar giant pulses, planetary cyclotron bursts), optical/infrared signals, and high-energy phenomena (gamma-ray burst spikes, fast X-ray transients, TeV blazar flares). We synthesize these results in a unified mass-abundance diagram and comprehensive tables summarizing both physical reach and observational requirements. This work serves as a roadmap for optimizing future multi-wavelength lensing searches, guiding the design of instruments and strategies to explore the PBH dark matter hypothesis across its remaining viable parameter space.
#### Mapping Jet-Gas Coupling and energetic ionized outflows in High-Redshift Radio Galaxies with JWST/NIRSpec

 - **Abstract**
 We present spatially resolved maps of morphology, kinematics, and energetics of warm ionized gas in six powerful radio galaxies at z=3.5-4, using JWST/NIRSpec IFU to quantify jet-driven feedback in the early universe. All sources exhibit broad [OIII] emission-line profiles with W80 (line width) values of 950-2500 km/s across $\sim$10s of kpc, signifying large-scale outflows. The outflowing nebulae are preferentially aligned with the radio jet axis, suggesting jet-driven origin. On average, the regions with the broadest lines and highest velocities are co-spatial with radio lobes or cores, and exhibit the strongest kinetic power. Ionized gas masses associated with the outflows span 1 to 8 $\times 10^{9} \ M_\odot$, with total mass outflow rates of 80-950 Msun/yr and kinetic powers between 10^{43.2} and 10^{45.0} erg/s. The outflow kinetic power corresponds to 0.15%-2% of the AGN bolometric luminosity, sufficient to impact galaxy evolution. However, only $\lesssim 1$\% of the jet mechanical energy couples to the warm ionized gas via outflows, consistent with predictions from hydrodynamic simulations. A large fraction of the jet energy may instead reside in shock-heated hot gas, supported by X-ray detection, or used to thermalize the gas and produce the observed emission-line nebulae. Our results demonstrate that radio jets in massive, gas-rich systems at high-redshift can inject significant kinetic and thermal energy to the surroundings, providing direct evidence for jet-driven feedback operating during the peak epoch of galaxy formation.
#### Shear Particle Acceleration in Structured Gamma-Ray Burst Jets: III. The Radiation Physics of Bright Prompt Optical Flash

 - **Abstract**
 The radiation physics of bright prompt optical emission of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) remains a puzzle. Assuming that the GRB ejecta is structured, we investigated this issue by characterizing the ejecta as an ultra-relativistic uniform jet core surrounded by a mild-relativistic cocoon. The mixed jet-cocoon (MJC) region can accelerate particles through the shear acceleration mechanism. Parameterizing the radial velocity profile of the MJC region with an exponential function and assuming a uniform magnetic field configuration, we show that the synchrotron radiation of the shear-accelerated electrons can produce a bright optical flash. Emission of the self-synchrotron Compton (SSC) process of the electron population can result in an X-ray excess and an extra MeV-GeV gamma-ray flash relative to the Band function component in the keV-MeV band, which is attributed to the synchrotron radiation of the shock-accelerated electrons in the jet core. Our model reasonably represents the extremely bright optical flash and spectral characteristics of GRBs 990123, 080319B, and 130427A. The inferred magnetic field strength of the MJC region is above $10^{5}$ G, potentially suggesting that the jets of these GRBs are highly magnetized.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar activity drives space weather, affecting Earth's magnetosphere and technological infrastructure, which makes accurate solar flare forecasting critical. Current space weather models under-utilize multi-modal solar data, lack iterative enhancement via expert knowledge, and rely heavily on human forecasters under the Observation-Orientation-Decision-Action (OODA) paradigm. Here we present the "Solar Activity AI Forecaster", a scalable dual data-model driven framework built on foundational models, integrating expert knowledge to autonomously replicate human forecasting tasks with quantifiable outputs. It is implemented in the OODA paradigm and comprises three modules: a Situational Perception Module that generates daily solar situation awareness maps by integrating multi-modal observations; In-Depth Analysis Tools that characterize key solar features (active regions, coronal holes, filaments); and a Flare Prediction Module that forecasts strong flares for the full solar disk and active regions. Executed within a few minutes, the model outperforms or matches human forecasters in generalization across multi-source data, forecast accuracy, and operational efficiency. This work establishes a new paradigm for AI-based space weather forecasting, demonstrating AI's potential to enhance forecast accuracy and efficiency, and paving the way for autonomous operational forecasting systems.

 - **Abstract**
 We used the NSF Jansky Very Large Array at a frequency $\nu =$ 22\,GHz to study the nearest billion-solar-mass black hole, in the early-type galaxy NGC\,3115 at a distance of 9.7\,Mpc. We localize a faint continuum nucleus, with flux density $S_{\rm 22\,GHz} = 48.2\pm6.4\,\mu$Jy, to a FWHM diameter $d_{\rm 22\,GHz} <$ 59\,mas (2.8\,pc). We find no evidence for adjacent emission within a stagnation region of radius $R_{\rm sta} \sim$ 360\,mas (17\,pc) identified in a recent hydrodynamic simulation tailored to NGC\,3115. Within that region, the simulated gas flow developed into an advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF). The nucleus' luminosity density $L_{\rm 22\,GHz} = 5.4 \times 10^{17}\,\rm W\,Hz^{-1}$ is about 60 times that of Sagittarius\,A$^\star$. The nucleus' spectral index $\alpha_{\rm 10\,GHz}^{\rm 22\,GHz} = -1.85\pm0.18$ ($S_\nu \propto \nu^\alpha$) indicates optically-thin synchrotron emission. The spectral energy distribution of the nucleus peaks near $\nu_{\rm peak} =$ 9\,GHz. Modeling this radio peak as an ADAF implies a black hole mass $M_{\rm ADAF} = (1.2\pm0.2) \times 10^9\,M_\odot$, consistent with previous estimates of $(1-2) \times 10^9\,M_\odot$ from stellar or hot-gas dynamics. Also, the Eddington-scaled accretion rate for NGC\,3115, $\dot{M}_{\rm ADAF}/\dot{M}_{\rm Edd} = 1.2^{+1.0}_{-0.6} \times 10^{-8}$, is about 4-8 times lower than recent estimates for Sagittarius\,A$^\star$.
#### Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk) XXII: Keplerian disk, disk structures and jets/outflows in the Class 0 protostar IRAS 04166+2706

 - **Abstract**
 We present ALMA observations of the Class 0 protostar IRAS 04166+2706, obtained as part of the ALMA large program Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk). These observations were made in the 1.3 mm dust continuum and molecular lines at angular resolutions of $\sim 0.05''$ ($\sim 8$ au) and $\sim 0.16''$ ($\sim25$ au), respectively. The continuum emission shows a disk-like structure with a radius of $\sim22$ au. Kinematical analysis of $^{13}$CO(2-1), C$^{18}$O(2-1), H$_2$CO (3$_{0,3}$-2$_{0,2}$), CH$_3$OH (4$_2$-3$_1$) emission demonstrates that these molecular lines trace the infalling-rotating envelope and possibly a Keplerian disk, enabling us to estimate the protostar mass to be $0.15 \rm{M_\odot} < \rm{M_\star} < 0.39 M_\odot$. The dusty disk is found to exhibit a brightness asymmetry along its minor axis in the continuum emission, probably caused by a flared distribution of the dust and the high optical depth of the dust emission. In addition, the CO(2-1) and SiO(5-4) emissions show knotty and wiggling motions in the jets. Our high angular resolution observations revealed the most recent mass ejection events, which have occurred within the last $\sim 25$ years.

 - **Abstract**
 The Cosmology Redshift Survey of the 4-metre Multi-Object Spectroscopic Telescope (4MOST-CRS) will provide redshift measurements of galaxies and quasars over 5700{\degsq} in the southern hemisphere. As targets for the 4MOST-CRS, we present a selection of an $r<19.25$ magnitude limited sample of Bright Galaxies (BG) and a colour selected sample of Luminous Red Galaxies (LRG) based on DESI Legacy Survey DR10.1 photometric data, in the redshift ranges $0.1<z<0.5$ and $0.4<z<1$, respectively. These samples are selected using the $g$, $r$, $z$, and $W1$ (from unWISE) photometric bands. For BGs, the star--galaxy separation is performed based on Gaia and Tycho-2 star catalogues. Following 4MOST requirements, the target densities of BGs and LRGs are 250{\mdegsq} and 400{\mdegsq}, respectively. We quantified the stellar contamination to be $<2-4\%$ for both galaxy samples using data from the first DESI data release. Using angular clustering, we show that both samples are robust against imaging systematics, confirming a low stellar contamination. Finally, we provide forecasts of the baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) and growth of structure ($\sigma_8$) measurements from the 4MOST-CRS alone and in combination with DESI. From the 4MOST-CRS, we expect 3\% and 25\% precision on BAO and $\sigma_8$ measurements, respectively. Combining 4MOST-CRS with DESI improves the constraints from DESI alone by 12$\%$ in the 0.4 < z < 0.8 redshift range, leading to the most stringent constraints on BAO measurements from spectroscopic galaxy clustering.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyzed X-ray data from Chandra, XMM-Newton, NICER, and NuSTAR to characterize the properties of the pulsar PSR J1838$-$0655 and its pulsar wind nebula (PWN) associated with HESS J1837$-$069. Based on 5.5 years of NICER monitoring, we detected a glitch around MJD 59300, characterized by a fractional frequency jump of approximately $2\times 10^{-6}$. We constructed semi-phase-coherent timing solutions for pre- and post-glitch epochs, allowing for phase alignment of multi-instrument data and a subsequent measurement of the pulsed spectrum of the pulsar. This analysis confirmed previously-reported spectral curvature and revealed a peak energy of $73^{+85}_{-26}$ keV in the pulsar's spectral energy distribution (SED), based on a logpar model fit of the pulsed spectrum. We discuss these findings within the framework of pulsar magnetospheric emission scenarios. The PWN's X-ray spectrum is well-described by a power law with a photon index of $2.1\pm0.3$, softer than previously-reported measurements. We also characterized the X-ray emission from another extended X-ray source AX J1837.3$-$0652 within the extent of HESS J1837$-$069. Based on the spatial and spectral properties of these X-ray sources, we propose a leptonic emission scenario for HESS J1837$-$069 and demonstrate its feasibility through SED modeling. Finally, we discuss the implications of our model results and alternative scenarios for the gamma-ray emission.
#### No Metallicity Preference in Fast Radio Burst Host Galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration extragalactic radio transients of unknown origin, and studying their host galaxies could offer clues to constrain progenitor models. Among various host properties, gas-phase metallicity is a key factor influencing stellar evolution and the production of transients. We analyze the largest uniformly selected sample of FRB host galaxies to date, measuring oxygen abundances (12+log(O/H) = 8.04-8.84) for 40 hosts using consistent emission-line diagnostics. Using a volume-limited subsample, we compare the distributions of stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), and metallicity to a control sample of star-forming galaxies matched in the same selection criteria. We find that FRB host galaxies span a wide range in metallicity and are broadly consistent with the SFR-weighted mass-metallicity relation of the star-forming galaxy population. Contrary to the earlier claim in the literature, we find no clear lower bound on metallicity, suggesting that metallicity alone does not strictly regulate FRB production. Encouragingly, this implies FRBs can form even in low-metallicity, high-redshift galaxies, supporting their potential as probes of matter distribution across cosmic time. Additionally, we find marginal ($\sim$2$\sigma$) evidence for a -0.09 $\pm$ 0.04 dex metallicity offset from the fundamental metallicity relation, likely due to suppressed SFRs at fixed mass and metallicity rather than metal deficiency. This offset resembles that observed in local post-merger galaxies, and may reflect a post-starburst phase following galaxy interactions, where FRB progenitors formed during the starburst produce FRBs after a 100-500 Myr delay, consistent with observed delay-time distributions and favoring binary evolution channels over core-collapse supernovae.
#### Revisiting Two Decades of GRB Observations: Assessing Missed Very High-Energy Detections and Future Prospects

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are bright flashes of electromagnetic radiation originating from the core collapse of massive stars or the merger of compact objects. It has long been theorized that GRBs can emit very high-energy (VHE) gamma rays that can reach the TeV level. Although current-generation Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs), such as H.E.S.S., have been observing GRBs since 2002, the first detection of GRBs by IACTs occurred only 16 years later, in 2018, raising the question of why no detections were made during these years. We investigate all GRBs detected by the Swift Observatory with redshift measurements over the past two decades. Using the phenomenological relationship between X-ray and gamma rays and taking into consideration extragalactic background light absorption effects and instrument response functions, we search for any missed opportunities for GRBs that could have been detected by the three IACTs: H.E.S.S., MAGIC, and VERITAS, and present the best candidates. We find that the missing detections can be explained by the low rate of detectable GRBs at VHE, which we quantify as < 1 per year. We also find that with the future Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), this rate can increase to 4 per year.

 - **Abstract**
 The rise of direct detection of gravitational waves (GWs) started a new era in multi-messenger astrophysics. Like GWs, many other astrophysical transient sources suffer from poor localization, which can span tens to thousands of square degrees in the sky. Moreover, as the detection horizon for these transients widens and the detection rate increases, current electromagnetic follow-up facilities require tools to optimize the follow-up of poorly localized events and save valuable telescope time for their time-domain astrophysics programs. We present \texttt{tilepy}, a Python library, and a tool to optimize the follow-up of poorly localized transient events. \texttt{tilepy} is used for GWs as well as other poorly localized events such as gamma-ray bursts detected by Fermi-GBM and neutrino candidates from IceCube. \texttt{tilepy} has also been optimized to integrate smoothly with multiple ground-based observatories operating individually or simultaneously with diverse observational configurations. In this contribution, we introduce the latest developments from \texttt{tilepy}, mainly the ability to operate with space-based observatories while taking into consideration factors such as Earth, Sun, and Moon occultation and South Atlantic Anomaly passage. We present innovations to the platform, handling a variety of field of view shapes, the possibility of optimizing observation scheduling with artificial intelligence tools and examples of its use on transient astrophysical events.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the finding of a linear, non-axisymmetric, global instability in gas discs around stars, which may be relevant to other astrophysical discs. It takes the form of an $m=1$ mode that grows in the disc density distribution while the star-barycentre distance rises exponentially with a characteristic timescale that is orders of magnitude longer than the orbital period. We present results of hydrodynamical simulations with various codes and numerical methods, using either barycentric or stellocentric reference frames, with or without the disc's self gravity: all simulations consistently show an unstable mode growing exponentially. The instability disappears if, and only if, the reflex motion of the star due to the disc's asymmetry is not taken into account in the simulations. For this reason we refer to this instability as the reflex instability. We identify a feedback loop as a possible origin, whereby the acceleration of the star excites the eccentricity of the disc, yielding an $m=1$ mode in the density distribution which, in turn, pulls the star. The growth timescale of the instability decreases with increasing disc mass and is a few hundred orbits for disc-to-star mass ratios of a few percent. If truly physical, and not due to a numerical artifact that would be common to all the codes we have employed, the reflex instability could have a dramatic impact on protoplanetary discs evolution and planetary formation.

We discuss constraints from Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) $\gamma$-ray upper limits on the size of the radiation zone and the maximum energies of accelerated cosmic rays, as well as the resulting neutrino productions from TDEs and candidates, including AT 2019dsg, AT 2019fdr, AT 2019aalc, and AT 2021lwx. The Fermi upper limits correspond to a generic neutrino detection rate of $\lesssim0.01-0.1$ per TDE. Additionally, we explore multi-wavelength modeling of jetted TDEs with luminous X-ray afterglows, another TDE subclass, by incorporating the dynamics of structured jets with time-dependent energy injection. We also examine the connection between neutrinos and their multi-wavelength counterparts, highlighting implications for future multi-messenger discoveries with IceCube, IceCube-Gen2, KM3NeT, and Fermi-LAT.

 - **Abstract**
 Active region NOAA 13842 produced two successive solar flares: an X7.1-class flare on October 1, 2024, and an X9.0-class flare on October 3, 2024. This study continues our previous simulation work that successfully reproduced the X7.1-class solar flare (Matsumoto et al. 2025). In this study, we performed a data-constrained magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation using the nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF) as the initial condition to investigate the X9.0-class solar flare. The NLFFF showed the sheared field lines, resulting in the tether-cutting reconnection, the magnetic flux ropes (MFRs), and eventually led to eruption. The magnetic reconnection during the pre-eruption phase plays a critical role in accelerating the subsequent eruption, which is driven by torus instability and magnetic reconnection. Furthermore, our simulation results are consistent with several observational features associated with the X9.0 flare. This simulation could reproduce diverse phenomena associated with the X9.0 flare, including the tether-cutting reconnection, the flare ribbons and the flare loops, the transverse field enhancement, and the remote brightening away from the flare ribbons. However, the initial trigger, magnetic flux emergence, was inferred from observations rather than explicitly modeled, and future comprehensive simulations should incorporate this mechanism directly.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the role of high-redshift protoclusters in cosmic reionization is essential to unveiling the early stages of structure formation. Using deep imaging and spectroscopy from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) JADES Deep Survey in GOODS-South, we identify two prominent protoclusters at z>7 and investigate their environmental properties in comparison to field galaxies. Protocluster members exhibit systematically higher ionizing photon production efficiency ($\xi_{\text{ion}}$) and inflated [OIII]/H$\beta$ ratios at fixed UV magnitude or stellar mass, likely driven by young, metal-poor stellar populations and intense star formation. Despite these properties, their Ly$\alpha$ emission is weak or absent, and they show high proximate neutral hydrogen column densities, suggesting insufficient ionizing output to maintain ionized bubbles. We also find that a strong Ly$\alpha$ emitter (LAE), JADES-GS-z7-LA, may lie within the same ionized region as one protocluster. Although their Lyman continuum escape fractions ($f_{\mathrm{esc}} \sim 0.1$) are comparable to those of LAEs, individual protocluster galaxies are faint ($M_{\mathrm{UV}} > -19$) and low-mass ($\log(M_*/M_\odot) \sim 8.5$). The enhanced number density within protoclusters boosts the local UV luminosity density by nearly 1 dex. The surrounding gas remains largely neutral, suggesting that reionization was highly patchy and modulated by environment. The protocluster galaxies likely host ionization-bounded nebulae with holes, suppressing Ly$\alpha$ visibility, in contrast to field galaxies that are more consistent with density-bounded nebulae.

 - **Abstract**
 With the knowledge and statistical precision derived from two decades of measurement, the Pierre Auger Observatory has significantly deepened our understanding of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays while unearthing an increasingly complex astrophysical landscape and exposing tensions with hadronic interaction models. The field now demands the mass of individual cosmic-ray primaries as an observable with an exposure that only the 3000-square-kilometer surface array of the Observatory can provide. Access to the primary mass hinges on the disentanglement of the electromagnetic and muonic components of extensive air showers. To achieve this, scintillator and radio detectors have been installed atop each existing water-Cherenkov detector of the surface array, whose dynamic range has also been enhanced through the installation of small-area PMTs. Additionally, the timing and signal resolution of all detector stations have been improved through upgraded station electronics, and underground muon counters have been installed in a region of the array with denser spacing. As the commissioning of the final components of AugerPrime reaches its conclusion and the enhanced array comes fully online, we present the realization of its design, its performance, and the first results from this now multi-hybrid observatory.

 - **Abstract**
 Differential rotation is a key driver of magnetic activity and dynamo processes in the Sun and other stars, especially as the rate differs across the solar layers, but also in active regions. We aim to accurately quantify the velocity at which round {\alpha}-spots traverse the solar disk as a function of their latitude, and compare these rates to those of the quiet-Sun and other sunspot types. We then extend this work to other stars and investigate how differential rotation affects the modulation of stellar light curves by introducing a generalized stellar differential rotation law. We manually identify and track 105 {\alpha}-sunspots in the 6173 Å continuum using the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) aboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). We measure the angular velocities of each spot through center-of-mass and geometric ellipse-fitting methods to derive a differential rotation law for round {\alpha}-sunspots. Results. Using over a decade of HMI data we derive a differential rotation law for {\alpha}-sunspots. When compared to previous measurements we find that {\alpha}-sunspots rotate 1.56% faster than the surrounding quiet-Sun, but 1.35% slower than the average sunspot population. This supports the hypothesis that the depth at which flux tubes are anchored influences sunspot motions across the solar disk. We extend this analysis to other stars by introducing a scaling law based on the rotation rates of these stars. This scaling law is implemented into the Stellar Activity Grid for Exoplanets (SAGE) code to illustrate how differential rotation alters the photometric modulation of active stars. Our findings emphasize the necessity of considering differential rotation effects when modeling stellar activity and exoplanet transit signatures

 - **Abstract**
 We describe the numerical algorithms of a global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) code utilizing the Yin-Yang grid, called the Yin-Yang Magnetic Flux Eruption (Yin-Yang-MFE) code, suitable for modeling the large-scale dynamical processes of the solar corona and the solar wind. It is a single-fluid MHD code taking into account the non-adiabatic effects of the solar corona, including the electron heat conduction, optically thin radiative cooling, and empirical coronal heating. We describe the numerical algorithms used to solve the set of MHD equations (with the semi-relativistic correction, or the Boris correction) in each of the partial spherical shell Yin Yang domains, and the method for updating the boundary conditions in the ghost-zones of the two overlapping domains with the code parallelized with the message passing interface (MPI). We validate the code performance with a set of standard test problems, and finally present a solar wind solution with a dipolar magnetic flux distribution at the solar surface, representative of solar minimum configuration.

 - **Abstract**
 Turbulent coronae of supermassive black holes can accelerate non-thermal particles to high energies and produce observable radiation, but capturing this process is challenging due to comparable timescales of acceleration, cooling, and the development of cascades. We present a time-dependent numerical framework that self-consistently couples proton acceleration -- modeled by the Fokker-Planck equation -- with leptonic-hadronic radiation. For the neutrino-emitting Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068, we reproduce the neutrino spectrum observed by IceCube, while satisfying gamma-ray constraints. We also consider a transient corona scenario, potentially emerging in non-jetted tidal disruption events like AT 2019dsg, and show that early-stage cascade feedback can impact proton acceleration and radiation processes in weaker coronae, producing delayed optical/ultraviolet, X-ray, and neutrino emissions of $\mathcal O(100~\rm d)$. This flexible code efficiently models multi-messenger signals from both steady and transient astrophysical sources, providing insights in combining particle acceleration and radiation mechanisms.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the imprint of magnetic fields on gravitational waves emitted during the inspiral phase of eccentric binary neutron star systems. While observations indicate that neutron stars typically exhibit strong magnetic fields in the range of $10^{14}$-$10^{15}\,\mathrm{G}$, theoretical models allow for fields as high as $ \sim 10^{17-18}\,\mathrm{G}$. In binaries, the fate of these fields depends on the formation pathway: in systems formed through isolated evolution, magnetic fields may decay over long inspiral timescales. In contrast, binaries formed via dynamical capture can retain substantial eccentricity and strong fields until merger, potentially altering the gravitational waveform. We consider two magnetic effects: magnetic interaction between the neutron stars and electromagnetic radiation from the system's effective dipole, and identify regimes where each dominates. Using a perturbative framework, we compute the associated energy loss and gravitational wave phase evolution. We find that for binaries with strong and comparable magnetic fields, $10^{14}\,\mathrm{G}$ fields may be detectable up to $\sim 10 \, \mathrm{Mpc}$ with DECIGO and the Einstein Telescope, while $10^{15}\,\mathrm{G}$ fields extend the reach to several hundred Mpc. For extreme fields of $10^{16}\,\mathrm{G}$, third-generation detectors could be sensitive out to Gpc scales. In contrast, LIGO is limited to galactic distances: $10^{15}\,\mathrm{G}$ fields are detectable only within $\sim 100\,\mathrm{kpc}$, and only ultrastrong fields ($\sim 10^{16}$-$10^{17}\,\mathrm{G}$) are potentially observable at Gpc distances. In highly asymmetric systems, where dipole radiation dominates, the gravitational wave dephasing is significantly suppressed, reducing the detection horizon. These findings suggest that current and future gravitational wave observatories may be capable of identifying magnetized binary systems.
