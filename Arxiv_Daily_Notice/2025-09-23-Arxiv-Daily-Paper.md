 - **Abstract**
 We present new Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging of three recently discovered star-forming dwarf galaxies beyond the Local Group: Pavo, Corvus A, and Kamino. The discovery of Kamino is reported here for the first time. They rank among the most isolated faint dwarf galaxies known, hence they provide unique opportunities to study galaxy evolution at the smallest scales, free from environmental effects of more massive galaxies. Our HST data reach $\sim$2-4 magnitudes below the tip of the red giant branch for each dwarf, allowing us to measure their distances, structural properties, and recent star formation histories (SFHs). All three galaxies contain a complex stellar population of young and old stars, and are typical of field galaxies in this mass regime ($M_V=-10.62\pm0.08$ and $D=2.16^{+0.08}_{-0.07}$ Mpc for Pavo, $M_V=-10.91\pm0.10$ and $D=3.34\pm0.11$ Mpc for Corvus A, and $M_V=-12.02\pm0.12$ and $D=6.50^{+0.15}_{-0.11}$ Mpc for Kamino). Our HST-derived SFHs reveal differences among the three dwarfs: Pavo and Kamino show relatively steady, continuous star formation, while Corvus A formed $\sim$$60$% of its stellar mass by 10 Gyr ago. These results align with theoretical predictions of diverse evolutionary pathways for isolated low-mass galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 Synchrotron emission is seen in a vast array of astrophysical transients, such as gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), radio supernovae, neutron star (NS) mergers, tidal disruption events (TDEs), and fast blue optical transients (FBOTs). Despite the ubiquity of synchrotron-emitting sources, modeling of the emergent flux from these events often relies on simplified analytic approximations. These approximations are inaccurate for high-velocity shocks, where special-relativistic effects are important. Properly incorporating these effects considerably complicates calculations, and generally requires a numerical treatment. In this work we present a novel numerical model which solves the full radiative-transfer problem in synchrotron-emitting shocks, accounting for all relativistic effects. This `full-volume' model is capable of calculating synchrotron emission from a shock of arbitrary velocity, and is designed to be flexible and applicable to a wide range of astrophysical sources. Using this new code, we evaluate the accuracy of more commonly-used approximate models. We find that the full-volume treatment is generally necessary once the shock proper-velocity exceeds $(\Gamma\beta)_{\rm sh}\gtrsim 0.1$, and that approximate models can be inaccurate by $\gtrsim$ an order-of-magnitude in trans-relativistic shocks. This implies that there may be a bias in the inferred physical properties of some FBOTs, jetted TDEs, and other relativistic explosions, where approximate analytic models are typically employed. The code associated with our model is made publicly available, and can be used to study the growing population of relativistic synchrotron-emitting transients.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent work has established large samples of astrometrically confirmed RR Lyrae and type-II Cepheid members of Galactic globular clusters (GCs). Any given GC can contain multiple such stars at once, notably RR Lyrae stars pulsating in the fundamental mode (RRab) or the first overtone (RRc), and type-II Cepheids (T2Cep) of BL Her and W Vir types. Here, we present the first joint calibration of the Leavitt laws (LLs) exhibited by 802 RRab, 345 RRc, and 21 T2Cep stars anchored to trigonometric parallaxes. Using the third data release of the ESA Gaia mission (GDR3), we have calibrated the intercepts of the RRab and RRc Leavitt laws in the reddening-free Gaia Wesenheit magnitude to better than 1.0% in distance, and that of T2Cep to 1.3%, using a global fit to all data. The absolute scale is set by 37 nearby GCs with high-accuracy parallaxes while 56 additional GCs provide constraints on LL slopes as well as the LL intercept differences of RRc and T2Cep relative to RRab stars. Our global fit yields homogeneous high-accuracy distances of 93 GCs that show no evidence of bias for Gaia parallaxes of distant GCs. Control of systematics was demonstrated by 31 alternative fit variants, notably involving different treatments of metallicity effects, as well as by Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis. Our results suggest that photometric metallicities of RR Lyrae stars require further improvements while also exhibiting possible signs of intra-cluster chemical inhomogeneity. This work lays the foundation for exploiting RRab, RRc, and T2Cep stars as high-accuracy standard candles for near-field cosmology and the extragalactic distance scale.
#### A HyperFlash and ÈCLAT view of the local environment and energetics of the repeating FRB 20240619D

 - **Abstract**
 Time-variable propagation effects provide a window into the local plasma environments of repeating fast radio burst (FRB) sources. Here we report high-cadence observations of FRB 20240619D, as part of the HyperFlash and ÉCLAT programs. We observed for $500$h and detected $217$ bursts, including $10$ bursts with high fluence ($>25$ Jy ms) and implied energy. We track burst-to-burst variations in dispersion measure (DM) and rotation measure (RM), from which we constrain the parallel magnetic field strength in the source's local environment: $0.32\pm0.19$ mG. Apparent DM variations between sub-bursts in a single bright event are interpreted as coming from plasma lensing or variable emission height. We also identify two distinct scintillation screens along the line of sight, one associated with the Milky Way and the other likely located in the FRB's host galaxy or local environment. Together, these (time-variable) propagation effects reveal that FRB 20240619D is embedded in a dense, turbulent and highly magnetised plasma. The source's environment is more dynamic than that measured for many other (repeating) FRB sources, but less extreme compared to several repeaters that are associated with a compact, persistent radio source. FRB 20240619D's cumulative burst fluence distribution shows a power-law break, with a flat tail at high energies. Along with previous studies, this emphasises a common feature in the burst energy distribution of hyperactive repeaters. Using the break in the burst fluence distribution, we estimate a source redshift of $z=0.042$-$0.240$. We discuss FRB 20240619D's nature in the context of similar studies of other repeating FRBs.

 - **Abstract**
 The Energetic Particle Radiation Environment Model (EPREM) solves the focused transport equation (FTE) on a Lagrangian grid in a frame co-moving with the solar wind plasma and simulates the acceleration and transport of solar energetic particles (SEP) in the heliosphere. When not coupled to an external magnetohydrodynamic model, EPREM functions in an uncoupled mode where an ideal cone-shock is injected into a homogeneous background solar wind. We carried out an analysis of the effects of multiple physical parameters in producing widespread SEP events simulated by the uncoupled EPREM using a relatively simple model of a strong magnetized shock propagating radially outward through the inner heliosphere to produce the requisite MHD quantities for EPREM's sophisticated model of proton acceleration and transport. We compared a baseline simulation with seven variations in which the value of a single parameter differed from its baseline value. All simulations exhibit complex profiles of SEP flux as a function of time and energy, with clear dependence on parameters related to diffusion, mean free path, and shock profile. Moreover, while all simulations exhibit significant longitudinal spread in SEP flux, for certain parameter values there exists a decrease or absence in SEP flux at observers located >=90 degrees from the shock origin. Relating the differences in SEP flux to the specific values of each parameter in the simulations provides insight into the morphology of observed SEP events and the state of the solar wind through which the driving CME propagates.

 - **Abstract**
 Routine measurements of the magnetic field of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) have been a key challenge in solar physics. Making such measurements is important both from a space weather perspective and for understanding the detailed evolution of the CME. In spite of significant efforts and multiple proposed methods, achieving this goal has not been possible to date. Here we report the first possible detection of gyroresonance emission from a CME. Assuming that the emission is happening at the third harmonic, we estimate that the magnetic field strength ranges from 7.9--5.6 G between 4.9-7.5 $R_\odot$. We also demonstrate that this high magnetic field is not the average magnetic field inside the CME, but most probably is related to small magnetic islands, which are also being observed more frequently with the availability of high-resolution and high-quality white-light images.

 - **Abstract**
 The impact of energy exchange among the relevant fluid components: baryonic matter, fermionic dark matter (DM), and dark energy (DE) on the internal structure of neutron stars is investigated. Using a representative DM mass $m_{\chi} = 10$ GeV and a barotropic DE relation, we add source terms Qi to the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations and examine three cases: (i) noninteracting fluids (Model I), (ii) fully interacting baryon plus DM and DM with DE fluids with optional DM self repulsion (Model II), and (iii) a unified dark sector coupled to baryons (Model III). Two effects dominate: softening by massive, pressure-poor DM, and additional softening/ and binding from DE with negative pressures. Model I isolates these baselines. In Model II, exchange terms self regulate, making the mass radius curves nearly independent of the coupling parameter $\alpha$ for nearly five orders of magnitude. Model III breaks this $\alpha$ degeneracy: a sizable vacuum fraction suppresses the baryonic pressure gradient, reducing both the maximum mass and radii, whereas a pure-DM core is less sensitive. We outline when dark interactions can leave observable, macroscopic imprints.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxies with high star-formation rate surface densities often host large-scale outflows that redistribute energy, momentum, and baryons between the interstellar medium and the halo, making them a key feedback channel regulating galaxy evolution. Despite their importance, the driving physics behind galactic outflows and their interaction with the surrounding halo is yet to be fully understood. In particular, the influence of a pre-existing reservoir of cosmic rays (CRs) in galaxy halos has not been clearly established. We determine the conditions required to launch outflows in the presence of halo CRs and investigate how CR pressure gradients modify outflow speeds. We find that CR halos suppress the development of large-scale, CR-driven winds and redirect CR feedback toward local recycling flows. Slow outflows are therefore more likely in young galaxies lacking extended CR halos, while fast winds in intense starbursts are dominated by momentum injection and largely unaffected by halo CRs.

 - **Abstract**
 Theoretical and experimental foundations of the hypothesis about the origin of the magnetic fields of the Earth and other astrophysical objects, proposed in the early 20th century by W. Sutherland, A. Einstein, and independently by Yu.S. Vladimirov, are discussed in the paper. According to this hypothesis, the electric charges of the electron and proton slightly differ in magnitude, leading to the emergence of a magnetic field in rotating astrophysical objects. The theoretical justification of the Sutherland-Einstein hypothesis is presented in a simplified version of the 6D Kaluza-Klein theory, taking into account the consequences of the Kerr-Newman metric. The analysis shows that a fundamental dipole-type magnetic field should arise around any massive rotating body. However, in real astrophysical objects, such a field is largely screened and distorted by induced charges and currents. As an application, we consider the problem of determining the magnetic fields of hot Jupiters, since the strong tidal effects in these giant exoplanets should result in approximately similar screening mechanisms.

 - **Abstract**
 We present GDCluster, a fully automated algorithm for decomposing spectral-line datacube of interstellar gas into coherent structures. Assuming a multi-Gaussian nature of observed spectra, GDCluster employs and augments the derivative spectroscopy technique for precise parameter estimation, incorporates spatial-continuity constraints during spectral fitting, and extends these constraints to spatial clustering. This approach effectively resolves velocity blending structures in PPV space-particularly critical for ubiquitous HI spectra where emissions from multiple phases are severely blended. Applied to the all-sky HI4PI data, a 10 degree times 10 degree CRAFTS survey region, and a 45 degree times 10 degree MWISP survey region, GDCluster extracts 45,299, 2247, and 47,119 structures in HI and CO (1-0), respectively. Comparative analyses demonstrate GDCluster's superiority over DBSCAN in separating overlapping spectra with complex velocity components.

 - **Abstract**
 Accreting black holes are thought to swallow matter in the form of a disk and a hot cloud of plasma that glows brightly in X-rays, known as the corona. The X-ray emitting region is far too small to be directly imaged, but rapid variability of the X-ray signal can be used to infer the geometry by measuring time lags caused by material propagating towards the black hole and by coronal X-rays reflecting off the disk to imprint a reverberation lag. Reverberation lags can be recognized by characteristic spectral features, including an iron emission line at $\sim 6.4$ keV and a broad Compton hump peaking at $\sim 30$ keV. These reverberation features have both previously been detected for a few supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). However, it is much more challenging to detect reverberation lags from stellar-mass black holes because they are more than a million times smaller. Previous reverberation lag measurements for stellar-mass black holes in X-ray binary systems have thus been limited to energies below 10 keV. Here we report on the first detection of the Compton hump reverberation feature from an X-ray binary, achieved by measuring lags in the broad energy range of $\sim 1-150$ keV. The accompanying detection of an iron line feature confirms the scenario of X-ray reverberation and provides strong evidence that the accretion flows in AGNs and X-ray binaries are governed by an ubiquitous process. Reverberation lags are prominent only in the most rapid variability, whereas lags in the slower variability are commonly attributed to propagating mass accretion rate perturbations. Our lag measurements up to the highest energy to date reveal that this lag in the slower variability evolves dramatically on timescales of days.
#### Investigation of the Axe-shaped Radio Galaxy J1051+5523 with uGMRT

 - **Abstract**
 We present a multi-frequency study of the bent-tail radio galaxy J1051+5523, located in the galaxy cluster WHL J105147.4+552309. This wide-angle tail (WAT) galaxy exhibits a complex radio morphology, characterised by a right-angled bend in the northern jet, which resembles an axe, and multiple kinks in the southern jet, as observed in the deep uGMRT radio observations. The radio power of J1051+5523 at 150 MHz is estimated to be $2.91 \times 10^{25}\,\mathrm{W\,Hz^{-1}}$, placing it in the transition zone between FRI and FRII radio galaxies. The spectral index map reveals a flat core and relatively flat lobes, which may indicate ongoing particle acceleration or a relatively young population of relativistic electrons in the lobes. Further, we estimate the equipartition magnetic fields, and spectral ages of the northern and southern lobes to be approximately 150 Myr and 153 Myr, respectively, suggesting a long-lived radio source with sustained AGN activity. A relative velocity of 278 $\pm$ 2643 $\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ is obtained for the host galaxy. Due to the large uncertainty associated with the relative velocity estimates, the contribution of ram pressure to the jet bending remains inconclusive. The low mass of the host cluster ($\sim 2 \times 10^{14}\,M_\odot$) and the lack of diffuse X-ray emission indicate a reduced likelihood of major mergers, but minor mergers or interactions remain possible. We propose that the observed WAT morphology of J1051+5523 is likely shaped by a combination of ram pressure and/or buoyant forces within the cluster environment.

 - **Abstract**
 The Zirè experiment onboard NUSES space mission has several science goals, including the measurements of charged particles and light nuclei from few up to hundreds of MeVs, for the study of low-energy cosmic rays, space weather phenomena, and possible magnetosphere-lithosphere-ionosphere coupling signals. Furthermore, the experiment intends to test new tools for the detection of photons in the energy range of about 0.03-50 MeV, allowing the investigation of transient phenomena like gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). A high-density segmented calorimeter exploiting novel scintillator crystals and silicon photomultiplier technology for the readout system will serve this purpose along its main task of calorimetric energy measurement of the cosmic-ray charged particles. In this work, we discuss the functionality of the calorimeter as a GRB monitor through the calculation of its performance in terms of effective area, sensitivity, and timing response for the transient outbursts.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar-mass binary black hole (BBH) mergers occurring within the disks of active galactic nuclei (AGN) are promising sources for gravitational waves detectable by the LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA (LVK) interferometers. Some of these events have also been potentially associated with transient electromagnetic flares, indicating that BBH mergers in dense environments may be promising sources of multi-messenger signals. To investigate the prospects for electromagnetic emission from these systems, we study the dynamics of accretion flows onto BBHs embedded in AGN disks using numerical simulations. Although recent studies have explored this scenario, they often employ simplified disk models that neglect magnetic fields. In this work, we examine how strong magnetic fields influence and regulate the accretion onto such binary systems. In this context, we conduct three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical local shearing-box simulations of a binary black hole system embedded within a magnetized disk of an AGN. We observe that the dynamically important magnetic fields can drive the formation of well-collimated outflows capable of penetrating the vertical extent of the AGN disk. However, outflow generation is not ubiquitous and strongly depends on the radial distance of the binary from the supermassive black hole (SMBH). In particular, binaries placed at a larger distance from the central SMBH show relatively more transient accretion and the formation of stronger spiral shocks. Furthermore, accretion behavior onto the binary system via individual circum-singular disks (CSDs) is also modulated by local AGN disk properties. Our simulations highlight the importance of shear velocity in the amplification of the toroidal magnetic field component, which plays a crucial role in governing the outflow strength.

 - **Abstract**
 In this article, we present the results of an analysis of chemical abundances and a search for magnetic fields in eight field blue horizontal-branch (BHB) stars: BD\,+01$^{\circ}$0548, HD\,74721, HD\,86986, HD\,87112, HD\,93329, HD\,109995, HD\,161817, and HD\,167105. This study is based on high-resolution optical spectra obtained with ESPaDOnS at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. We first calculated the average chemical element abundance, the rotational velocity, and the radial velocity of the stars using the ZEEMAN2 spectrum synthesis code with the PHOENIX model atmospheres. We then studied the abundances of titanium and iron inferred from individual lines in the spectra of each star and their variations with their predicted formation depths $\tau_{\rm 5000}$. Similarly to the BHB stars cooler than 11500~K observed in globular clusters, no clear observational evidence of vertical stratification is detected in the atmosphere of these stars. In the second part of this project, we searched for the presence of a magnetic field in the stars applying the Least-Squares Deconvolution technique on the Stokes $I$ and $V$ spectra. The measured mean longitudinal magnetic field uncertainties, ranging from 8 to 30~G, effectively rule out the presence of an organized magnetic field in these targets with a strength larger than a few 100~G.
#### Identifying rocky planets and water worlds among sub-Neptune-sized exoplanets with the Habitable Worlds Observatory

 - **Abstract**
 Astronomers are debating whether the plentiful "sub-Neptune" exoplanets -- worlds a bit larger than Earth but smaller than Neptune -- are predominantly rocky planets, water-rich "ocean worlds," or gas-enshrouded mini-Neptunes. This question is crucial because such sub-Neptune-sized planets are among the most common in our galaxy, yet we have no analog in our own solar system, making them a key to understanding planet formation and diversity. It also directly impacts the search for habitable worlds: larger-than-Earth planets with solid surfaces or oceans could support life, whereas gas-rich mini-Neptunes likely cannot. However, distinguishing these types using only a planet's mass and radius is very challenging, because different compositions can produce similar densities, leaving a world's nature ambiguous with current data. The proposed Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), a future NASA flagship telescope, offers a solution. HWO could directly image and spectroscopically analyze starlight reflected from 50~100 sub-Neptunes around nearby stars, aiming to reveal their atmospheric compositions and potential surfaces. Using visible and near-infrared spectroscopy along with sensitive polarimetry, HWO would detect atmospheric gases (such as water vapor, methane, and carbon dioxide) and search for telltale surface signatures, including rock absorption features and the characteristic reflectivity patterns of oceans. By analyzing these signals, we could determine whether sub-Neptunes are large rocky planets or water worlds rather than gas-dominated mini-Neptunes. Crucially, expanding the search beyond Earth-sized planets to include these abundant sub-Neptunes may uncover entirely new classes of potentially habitable worlds, directly advancing HWO's mission to identify and characterize planets that could support life.
#### Magnetic flux ropes within reconnection exhausts close to the centers of heliospheric current sheets near the Sun

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the relationship between magnetic flux ropes and magnetic reconnection is fundamental to both space and astrophysical plasma studies. In this study, we report on two consecutive heliospheric current sheet (HCS) crossings by Parker Solar Probe (PSP), separated by ~10.5 hours, at a heliocentric distance of ~12 solar radii. For each crossing, we identified a series of flux ropes embedded within reconnection exhausts on the sunward side of X-line. Their passage durations are <20sec, corresponding to spatial scales of a few thousands kilometers, still larger by three orders of magnitude than ion inertial length. This identification was possible particularly during intervals when PSP was closest to the HCS center. These flux ropes are distinguishable from the background exhausts by enhancements in magnetic field strength, significantly in the guide field component, travel speed slightly faster (typically by <10km/s) than surrounding outflows, and often accompanied by, though not always, increased density and reduced temperature. We attribute their origin to secondary reconnection within the exhausts and subsequent merging of smaller flux ropes into larger structures, consistent with predictions by various simulations. We suggest that such flux ropes are most readily identifiable at the HCS center where the background magnetic field is weakest so that the relative enhancement in flux rope field becomes most prominent. This observational advantage is particularly notable closer to the Sun where the high ambient magnetic field strength can otherwise obscure such structures unless the spacecraft trajectory remains within the HCS central region for a sufficient duration.

 - **Abstract**
 The reverberation mapping (RM) is the most promising method to measure the mass of supermassive black hole in the center of active galaxy nuclei (AGNs). However, the dominant jet component hinders the application of RM method for blazars. In this work, we present a new algorithm to disentangle the contributions of the accretion disk and relativistic jet in blazars by analyzing the optical spectroscopic data. Applying this method to two flat-spectrum radio quasars, PKS 1510-089 and PKS 0736+017, we find that the H$\gamma$ variability in PKS 1510-089 lags behind the disk by approximately 116 days, while the H$\beta$ line exhibits a lag of about 52 days relative to the disk in PKS 0736+017. Based on these measured time lags, we estimate that the black hole masses are about $1.8 \times 10^8\ M_\odot$ for PKS 1510-089 and about $7.0 \times 10^7\ M_\odot$ for PKS 0736+017, respectively. This method paves the way to apply the RM method for blazars, and improves the understanding of disk and jet activities.

 - **Abstract**
 We present spatially resolved Keck/NIRC2 images of a stellar occultation by Titan on September 5, 2022 and compare them to predictions from concurrent ALMA observations and a suite of General Circulation Model (GCM) simulations. ALMA data and GCM simulations can predict middle atmosphere zonal wind distributions, which in turn produce diagnostic occultation image sequences. We construct an occultation forward model using the temperature profile measured by the Huygens Atmospheric Structure Instrument, which is then distorted using latitudinal zonal wind profiles from the ALMA data or GCM simulations. The occultation forward model yields simulated light distributions around Titan's limb, which we compare directly to the light distributions observed during the occultation. The GCM zonal wind profile corresponding to slightly before the time of the stellar occultation provides the best overall match to the data. The ALMA wind profile provides the best match to the occultation data when only the ingress data were considered, but is not the best match when data from ingress and egress are combined. Our data support the presence of stronger winds in the southern hemisphere during late northern summer.

 - **Abstract**
 A galaxy's mid-IR spectrum encodes key information on its radiation field, star formation, and dust properties. Characterizing this spectrum therefore offers strong constraints on a galaxy's activity. This project describes a diagnostic tool for identifying main-sequence (MS) star-forming galaxies (SFGs) in the local Universe using IR dust emission features that are characteristic of galaxy activity. A physically-motivated sample of mock galaxy spectra has been generated to simulate the IR emission of SFGs. Using this sample, we developed a diagnostic tool for identifying MS SFGs based on machine learning methods. Custom photometric bands were defined to target dust emission features, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and the dust continuum. Three bands were chosen to trace PAH features at 6.2 {\mu}m, 7.7 {\mu}m, 8.6 {\mu}m, and 11.3 {\mu}m, along with an additional band to probe the radiation field strength responsible for heating the dust. This diagnostic was subsequently applied to observed galaxies to evaluate its effectiveness in real-world applications. Our diagnostic achieves high performance, with an accuracy of 90.9% on MS SFGs (observed sample of SFGs). Additionally, it shows low contamination, with only 16.2% of AGN galaxies being misidentified as SF. Combining observational data with stellar population synthesis models enables the creation of physically-motivated samples of SFGs that match the spectral properties of real galaxies. By positioning custom photometric bands targeting key dust features, our diagnostic can extract valuable information without the need to measure emission lines. Although PAHs are sensitive indicators of star formation and interstellar medium radiation hardness, PAH emission alone is insufficient for identifying MS SFGs. Finally, we developed a physically-motivated spectral library of MS SFGs spanning from UV to FIR wavelengths.

 - **Abstract**
 Space-borne gravitational wave detections raise new questions for heliophysics: how the Sun-Terrestrial space environment affect gravitational wave detection, and to what extent? Space-borne gravitational wave detectors use laser interferometry to measure displacement variations between two free test masses caused by gravitational waves. Space-borne gravitational wave detectors require extremely high measurement accuracy, making it necessary to take into account the effects of space plasma and magnetic field. On one hand, laser propagation through space plasma can induce optical path difference noise, affecting distance measurement accuracy. On the other hand, interactions between space magnetic field and the test masses can generate acceleration noise. This review introduces studies on laser propagation noise and space magnetic acceleration noise in space gravitational wave detection. And this review presents a method, time-delay interferometry, to suppress laser propagation noise.
#### Radiation Mediated Shock and Planar Shock Breakout in the Presence of Atomic Transition Lines

 - **Abstract**
 We numerically study fast Newtonian radiation mediated shocks (RMS - v/c~0.2) in two simplified problems in the context of supernova shock breakout; (1) An RMS traveling in a uniform medium, and (2) an RMS escaping a powerlaw density profile in planar geometry (\rho~x^n). Both problems were previously solved in the literature assuming a fully ionized plasma medium emitting Bremstrahllung. It was shown that at high shock velocities photons can deviate from local thermal equilibrium (LTE) and reach distributions peaked at many keV. In this study we incorporate, for the first time, opacity from bound species of heavy elements (solar-like composition) into these two problems, at times drastically augmenting the photon production due to bound-free and bound-bound radiative processes. We use a previously developed hydrodynamically coupled multi-group radiative diffusion code, including inelastic Compton scattering and frequency-dependent opacity from the publicly available TOPS table. Adding a more realistic opacity leads the radiation to maintain LTE at higher velocities in comparison to the fully ionized problem. In the planar SBO problem this opacity can reduce the emission temperature by half and even an order of magnitude. This result is important for the observation of supernova shock breakout emission. The SED of SN envelope breakout will very likely remain in LTE for explosions in red super giant stars without stellar wind (and part of blue super giant star explosions), making X-Ray observations less likely in these cases by orders of magnitude relative to previous predictions. We provide a semi-analytic description for the SED in the case where LTE is maintained. A correct shock-breakout calculation requires opacity tables that include bound yet highly ionized species, ruling out the use of certain line tables (such as the commonly used Kurucz table).

 - **Abstract**
 In astrophysics, line opacity is a primary source of uncertainty in theoretical calculations of radiative transfer. Much of this uncertainty is dominated by the inability to resolve the width and separation in frequency of sharp atomic transition lines, leading to the common use of approximate frequency-averaged treatments for the lines. In a previous paper, we calculated shock-cooling emission following explosions in core-collapse supernovae using a mult-group radiative transfer code, and compared the results to those of the similar and often used STELLA code from the literature. We found important differences in the spectral energy distribution (SED) resulting from different choices of line opacity treatment. In our code, we used in the emissivity a frequency-binned average of a high-resolution opacity, while in STELLA the often-used Eastman Pinto 1993 (EP93) prescription was employed. In this short letter we revisit this comparison, essentially reproducing STELLA bound-free (photoionization) and bound-bound (line transition) opacities. We show the importance of introducing micro-plasma electron excitation level cutoffs in the equation of state (EOS). We also argue that EP93 is useful for estimating photon mean free-path in the presence of a forest of lines, but that it can underestimate photon production and reprocessing rates (emissivity) by orders of magnitude. To our knowledge, no fully-consistent coarse-frequency solution currently exists for line modeling in these systems. Finally, we describe new features in our updated publicly available high-resolution frequency-dependent opacity table.

 - **Abstract**
 Wide-separation lensed quasars (WSLQs) are a rare subclass of strongly lensed quasars produced by massive galaxy clusters. They provide valuable probes of dark-matter halos and quasar host galaxies. However, only about ten WSLQ systems are currently known, which limits further studies. To enlarge the sample from wide-area surveys, we developed a catalog-based pipeline and applied it to the CatNorth database, a catalog of quasar candidates constructed from Gaia DR3. CatNorth contains 1,545,514 quasar candidates with about 90% purity and a Gaia G-band limiting magnitude of roughly 21. The pipeline has three stages. First, we identify groups with separations between 10 and 72 arcsec using a HEALPix grid with 25.6 arcsec spacing and a friends-of-friends search. We then filter by intra-group color and spectral similarity, reducing the 1,545,514 sources to 14,244 groups while retaining all known, discoverable WSLQs. Finally, a visual check, guided by image geometry and the presence of likely foreground lenses, yields the candidate list with quality labels. We identify 333 new WSLQ candidates with separations from 10 to 56.8 arcsec. Using available SDSS DR16 and DESI DR1 spectroscopy, we uncover two new candidate systems; the remaining 331 candidates lack sufficient spectra and are labeled as 45 grade A, 98 grade B, and 188 grade C. We also compile 29 confirmed dual quasars as a by-product. When feasible, we plan follow-up spectroscopy and deeper imaging to confirm WSLQs among these candidates and enable the related science.

 - **Abstract**
 Intergalactic weak magnetic fields can have non-negligible effects on the electromagnetic cascades induced by blazar gamma-ray emission. Secondary electrons and positrons are produced by primary gamma rays of energies ~TeV and can be magnetically deflected out of the line of sight to the observer. However, these leptons can perturb the background intergalactic medium (IGM), resulting in the growth of plasma instabilities, which can also influence the electromagnetic cascade. The resulting gamma-ray spectrum, observable in the GeV-TeV energy range, can bear imprints of these two competing phenomena: deflection by the intergalactic magnetic field and plasma instability cooling. We present the results of numerical simulations that incorporate the combined impact of these two processes on the propagated gamma-ray spectrum of the blazar 1ES 0229+200.
#### Role of sunspot latitude versus tilt in determining the polar field and amplitude of the next cycle: Cause of the weak Solar Cycle 20

 - **Abstract**
 One prominent feature of solar cycle is its irregular variation in its cycle strength, making it challenging to predict the amplitude of the next cycle. Studies show that fluctuations and nonlinearity in generating poloidal field throughout the decay and dispersal of tilted sunspots produce variation in the solar cycle. The flux, latitudinal position, and tilt angle of sunspots are the primary parameters that determine the polar field and, thus, the next solar cycle strength. By analysing the observed sunspots and polar field proxy, we show that the nonlinearity in the poloidal field generation becomes important for strong cycles. Except for strong cycles, we can reasonably predict the polar field at the end of the cycle (and thus the next cycle strength) using the total sunspot area alone. Combining the mean tilt angle and latitude positions with the sunspot area, we can predict the polar field of Cycles 15 -- 24 (or the amplitude of sunspot Cycles 16-25) with reasonable accuracy except for Cycle 23 for which the average tilt angle cannot predict the polar field. For Cycles 15--22, we show that the average tilt angle variation dominates over the latitude variation in determining the polar field of a cycle. In particular, the reduction of tilt in Cycle 19 was the primary cause of the following weak cycle (Cycle 20). Thus, we conclude that tilt quenching is essential in regulating the solar cycle strength in the solar dynamo.

 - **Abstract**
 Bipolar Magnetic Regions (BMRs) that appear on the solar photosphere are surface manifestations of the solar internal magnetic field. With modern observations and continuous data streams, the study of BMRs has moved from manual sunspot catalogs to automated detection and tracking methods. In this work, we present an additional module to the existing BMR tracking algorithm, AutoTAB, that focuses on identifying emerging signatures of BMRs. Specifically, for regions newly detected on the solar disk, this module backtracks the BMRs to their point of emergence. From a total of about 12000 BMRs identified by AutoTAB, we successfully backtracked 3080 cases. Within this backtracked sample, we find two distinct populations. One group shows the expected behaviour of emerging regions, in which the magnetic flux increases significantly during the emerging phase. The other group consists of BMRs whose flux, however, does not exhibit substantial growth during their evolution. We classify these as non-emerging BMRs and examine their statistical properties separately. Our analysis shows that these non-emerging BMRs do not display any preferred tilt angle distribution nor show systematic latitudinal tilt dependence, in contrast to the trends typically associated with emerging BMRs. This indicates that including such regions in statistical studies of BMR properties can distort or mask the underlying physical characteristics. We therefore emphasise the importance of excluding the non-emerging population from the whole dataset when analysing the statistical behaviour of BMRs.

 - **Abstract**
 Using a two-fluid approach, we consider the properties of relativistically nonlinear (arbitrary $a_0$), circularly polarized electromagnetic waves propagating along magnetic field in electron-ion and pair plasmas. Dispersion relations depend on how wave intensity scales with frequency, $a_0 (\omega)$. For superluminal branches, the nonlinear effects reduce the cut-off frequency, while the general form of the dispersion relations $\omega(k)$ remains similar to the linear case. For subluminal waves, whistlers and Alfven, a new effect appears: dispersion curves effectively terminate at finite $\omega^\ast - k^\ast$ due to current starvation. Qualitatively, subluminal modes with fluctuating electric field larger than the guide field, $E_w (\omega) \geq B_0$, cannot propagate.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we report multiwavelength and multipoint observations of the prominence eruption originating from active region 11163, which generated an M3.5 class flare and a coronal mass ejection (CME) on 2011 February 24. The prominence lifts off and propagates nonradially in the southeast direction. Using the revised cone model, we carry out three-dimensional reconstructions of the icecream-like prominence. The latitudinal inclination angle decreases from $\sim$60$\degr$ to $\sim$37$\degr$, indicating that the prominence tends to propagate more radially. The longitudinal inclination angle almost keeps constant (-6$\degr$). The highly inclined prominence eruption and the related CME drive an extreme ultraviolet (EUV) wave, which propagates southward at speeds of $\sim$381.60 km s$^{-1}$ and $\sim$398.59 km s$^{-1}$ observed in 193 Å and 304 Å, respectively. The M3.5 class flare presents quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) in soft X-ray, hard X-ray, EUV, and radio wavelengths with periods of 80$-$120 s. Cotemporary with the flare QPPs, a thin current sheet and multiple plasmoids are observed following the eruptive prominence. Combining with the appearance of drifting pulsation structure, the QPPs are most probably generated by quasi-periodic magnetic reconnection and particle accelerations as a result of plasmoids in the current sheet.

 - **Abstract**
 Analysis of radio emission from tidal disruption events allows for detailed constraints on the properties of ejected outflows and the host environment surrounding the black hole. However, the late-time radio behaviour of tidal disruption events is not well-studied due to a lack of observations. In this work we present long-term radio monitoring observations of the tidal disruption event AT2019azh spanning 1167-2159 days post disruption. We fit a physically motivated synchrotron model to the radio spectra at each epoch, and model the decay of the light curve under the assumption that the outflow transitions into the non-relativistic Sedov-Taylor regime at late times. Through this modelling we obtain strong constraints on the density profile of the circumnuclear medium, finding an unusually flat density profile proportional to $r^{0.24^{+0.11}_{-0.15}}$. Overall we find that unlike some tidal disruption events, AT2019azh does not show late time re-brightening up to 6 years post-disruption. The Sedov-Taylor light curve decay model provides a good fit to the data, motivating the assumption that the outflow was produced by a single ejection of material close to the time of stellar disruption. From forward modelling the evolution of the radio light curve decay we predict that the radio afterglow from AT2019azh should be detectable for decades at its current rate of evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 It is well-known that star-forming galaxies (SFGs) exhibit a tight correlation between their radio and infrared emissions, commonly referred to as the infrared-radio correlation (IRRC). Recent empirical studies have reported a dependence of the IRRC on the galaxy stellar mass, in which more massive galaxies tend to show lower infrared-to-radio ratios (qIR) with respect to less massive galaxies. One possible, yet unexplored, explanation is a residual contamination of the radio emission from active galactic nuclei (AGN), not captured through "radio-excess" diagnostics. To investigate this hypothesis, we aim to statistically quantify the contribution of AGN emission to the radio luminosities of SFGs located within the scatter of the IRRC. Our VLBA program "AGN-sCAN" has targeted 500 galaxies that follow the qIR distribution of the IRRC, i.e., with no prior evidence for radio-excess AGN emission based on low-resolution (~ arcsec) VLA radio imaging. Our VLBA 1.4 GHz observations reach a 5-sigma sensitivity limit of 25 microJy/beam, corresponding to a radio brightness temperature of Tb ~ 10^5 K. This classification serves as a robust AGN diagnostic, regardless of the host galaxy's star formation rate. We detect four VLBA sources in the deepest regions, which are also the faintest VLBI-detected AGN in SFGs to date. The effective AGN detection rate is 9%, when considering a control sample matched in mass and sensitivity, which is in good agreement with the extrapolation of previous radio AGN number counts. Despite the non-negligible AGN flux contamination (~ 30%) in our individual VLBA detections, we find that the peak of the qIR distribution is completely unaffected by this correction. We conclude that residual AGN contamination from non-radio-excess AGN is unlikely to be the primary driver of the M* - dependent IRRC.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a multiphase, resolved study of the galactic wind extending from the nearby starburst galaxy NGC 4666. For this we use VLT/MUSE observations from the GECKOS program and HI data from the WALLABY survey. We identify both ionised and HI gas in a biconical structure extending to at least $z\sim$8 kpc from the galaxy disk, with increasing velocity offsets above the midplane in both phases, consistent with a multiphase wind. The measured electron density, using [SII], differs significantly from standard expectations of galactic winds. We find electron density declines from the galaxy centre to $\sim2$ kpc, then rises again, remaining high ($\sim100-300$ cm$^{-3}$) out to $\sim$5 kpc. We find that HI dominates the mass loading. The total HI mass outflow rate (above $z~>2$ kpc) is between $5-13~M_{\odot}~\rm yr^{-1}$, accounting for uncertainties from disk-blurring and group interactions. The total ionised mass outflow rate (traced by H$\alpha$) is between $0.5~M_{\odot}~\rm yr^{-1}$ and $5~M_{\odot}~\rm yr^{-1}$, depending on $n_e(z)$ assumptions. From ALMA/ACA observations, we place an upper-limit on CO flux in the outflow which correlates to $\lesssim2.9~M_{\odot}~\rm yr^{-1}$. We also show that the entire outflow is not limited to the bicone, but a secondary starburst at the edge generates a more widespread outflow, which should be included in simulations. The cool gas in NGC 4666 wind has insufficient velocity to escape the halo of a galaxy of its mass, especially because most of the mass is present in the slower atomic phase. This strong biconical wind contributes to gas cycling around the galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy mergers are believed to play an important role in triggering rapid supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth. As merging nuclei approach each other, the physical properties of the participating galaxies and the associated SMBH growth are expected to evolve significantly. This study measures and characterizes these physical properties throughout the merger sequence. We constructed multiwavelength Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs) from hard X-rays to the far-infrared (FIR) for a sample of 72 nearby Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) host galaxies. The sample comprises 64 interacting systems, including single AGNs in mergers and dual AGNs, with nuclear separations $\leq$30 kpc, as well as eight isolated active galaxies with merging features. We carefully adapted available photometric measurements at each wavelength to account for their complex morphologies and varying spatial resolutions, to perform SED fitting using CIGALE, aimed to derive critical physical properties. Our results reveal that merging galaxies hosting AGN(s) show deviations from the star-forming main sequence, and a wide range of star formation rates (SFRs). Both AGN activity and star formation are significantly influenced by the merger process, but these effects are more prominent in major, mass ratios $<$4:1, interactions. We find that the projected nuclear separation is not a good tracer of the merger stage. Instead, morphological classification accurately assesses the merger progression. Based on this morphological analysis, late-stage mergers exhibit elevated SFRs (5.1$\times$), AGN luminosities (2.4$\times$), and nuclear obscuration (2.8$\times$) compared to earlier stages, supporting previous findings and reinforcing the link between merger-driven galaxy evolution and SMBH growth.

 - **Abstract**
 Seyfert-starburst composite galaxies host two promising phenomena of non-thermal high-energy radiation. In this regard the IceCube observation of high-energy neutrinos from the direction of the Seyfert-starburst composite galaxy NGC 1068 is not surprising. More recently, another Seyfert-starburst composite galaxy, NGC 7469, has shown hints for neutrino emission at even higher energies. Theoretical investigations could clarify that their so-called AGN corona is the most-likely origin of these neutrinos due to the need of being partially $\gamma$-ray opaque. In this work, we present an updated version of our Seyfert-starburst composite model from 2022, that accounts for a proper treatment of the stochastic acceleration processes in the AGN corona and the secondary electrons and positrons from leptonic radiation processes. Moreover, we use a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach to study the parameter space of these two potential high-energy neutrino sources under consideration of the given prior knowledge. In the case of NGC 1068, we can successfully explain its non-thermal observational features, where both its AGN corona and starburst ring are needed to account for the observations at high- energies. In the case of NGC 7469, the high-energy signatures can only be explained assuming a small coronal radius and the including external $\gamma\gamma$-pair attenuation. In general, both sources exhibit a strong influence of the $\gamma$-ray opaqueness on the results, highlighting the need for an accurate treatment of the intrinsic coronal X-ray field and the spatial extent of the $\gamma$-ray production site.

 - **Abstract**
 Plasma turbulence cascading from MHD to kinetic scales in the heliospheric plasma is believed to play a key role in coronal heating and fast solar wind acceleration, but the properties of the turbulence remain poorly constrained by observations. Here we compare the ion-scale density fluctuation levels inferred from the properties of solar radio bursts with the magnetic field fluctuation levels obtained through in-situ measurements in the inner heliosphere. We find that the observed magnetic and density fluctuation amplitudes are consistent with excitation by kinetic Alfvén waves and/or KAW structures over broad range of distances from the Sun. We then use the radio diagnostics and the KAW scenario to deduce the radial variation of magnetic fluctuation amplitudes in regions close to the Sun where in-situ measurements cannot be obtained. Further, we calculate the energy cascade rate (plasma heating rate) profile over a region that extends from the low corona ($\sim 0.1$~R$_\odot$) into the heliosphere (out to $\sim 1$~au), and compare it to the energy deposition rate required to drive the solar wind. The cascade rate agrees with the available in-situ measurements and also provides predictions closer than $\sim 10$~R$_\odot$ where in-situ approaches are not available. The results provide unique diagnostics of the ion-scale plasma turbulence amplitude and energy cascade rate spanning over three orders of magnitude in solar distance.

 - **Abstract**
 We examine the first three BepiColombo Mercury flybys Using data from the Miniature Ion Precipitation Analyzer (MIPA), an ion mass analyzer in the Search for Exospheric Refilling and Natural Abundances (SERENA) package on the Mercury Planetary Orbiter (MPO) designed to study magnetospheric dynamics. These flybys all passed from dusk to dawn through the nightside equatorial region but were noticeably different from each other. In the first flyby, we observe a low latitude boundary layer and $\sim$1 keV ions near closest approach. For flybys 2 and 3 we see ions up to 14 keV in the same location, including freshly injected precipitating ions inside the loss cone. High time resolution data from flyby 3 show variations consistent with bursty bulk flows 10s long and occurring over $\sim30$s periods, the first such observation in this region. MIPA data demonstrate that high-energy injection processes are an important source of precipitation ions at Mercury.
#### The Role of the Convective Kissing Instability in Cataclysmic Variable Evolution

 - **Abstract**
 The convective kissing instability (CKI) is postulated to occur in low mass stars around the fully convective transition. Non-equilibrium $^{3}$He burning leads to the merging of core and envelope convective zones, which causes abrupt decreases in the stellar radius. It has been suggested by van Saders & Pinsonneault (2012) that these effects may be relevant for cataclysmic variables (CVs). We have performed stellar evolution modeling to study the role of the CKI in CV evolution. We find that the CKI has no effect on normal CVs which evolve via magnetic braking and gravitational radiation above the period gap. CKI cycles either do not occur or are abruptly halted once mass transfer begins. If only gravitational radiation is considered, the CKI does occur. The abrupt radius changes can cause detachment phases which produce small period gaps with widths of a few minutes. We describe how the size of the period gaps is controlled by the $^{3}$He profiles of the secondaries. We also discuss how the results of this study apply to the evolution of strong field polars, where the magnetic field of the white dwarf is strong enough to suppress magnetic braking.

 - **Abstract**
 The extragalactic background is composed of the emission from all astrophysical sources, both resolved and unresolved, in addition to any diffuse components. In the last decade, there has been significant progress in our understanding of the cosmic history of extragalactic emissions associated with stellar evolution and accretion onto supermassive black holes, largely enabled by the extensive body of multi-wavelength data. The brightness of the extragalactic sky is now measured in photons, neutrinos, and cosmic rays, using observatories on the ground, in the sea, and in the ice, satellites in Earth orbit, and probes at the edge of the solar system. This wealth of disparate data is essential to unraveling the mysteries of the source populations that contribute to the extragalactic background. In this contribution, we present an open database containing the most comprehensive collection of measurements of the extragalactic background spectrum to date. The combination of multi-messenger measurements over 27 frequency decades allows us to estimate the energy density of most extragalactic background components with an uncertainty of less than 30%. We explore the consistency of this cosmic inventory of the observed fields of relativistic particles populating the Universe with the cosmic history of star formation and accretion around supermassive black holes. Models incorporating these cosmic histories, as well as the redshift-dependent luminosity functions of extragalactic sources, currently match the electromagnetic component of the extragalactic background spectrum over 14 frequency decades, from the near UV to sub-TeV gamma rays. The knowledge gained from synthetic population models in the electromagnetic bands may become a crucial tool for understanding the origin of the most energetic extragalactic messengers, neutrinos and ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays.
