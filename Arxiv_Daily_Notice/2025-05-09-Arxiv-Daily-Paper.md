#### Cluster Lensing Mass Inversion (CLUMI+): Combining Dynamics and Weak Lensing around Galaxy Clusters
 - **Authors:** Keiichi Umetsu, Michele Pizzardo, Antonaldo Diaferio, Margaret J. Geller

 - **Abstract**
 We present CLUMI+, a self-consistent, multi-probe methodology for reconstructing the mass distribution in and around galaxy clusters by combining gravitational lensing and dynamical observations. Building on the joint-likelihood framework of Umetsu (2013), CLUMI+ integrates weak-lensing shear and magnification data with projected escape velocity measurements in the cluster infall region, yielding tighter constraints on the gravitational potential without relying on equilibrium assumptions. The mass distribution is modeled using a flexible, piecewise-defined convergence profile that characterizes the azimuthally averaged surface mass density within the lensing field, transitioning to a projected power-law form at larger radii where phase-space constraints complement lensing. Additional strong-lensing constraints are incorporated via central aperture-mass measurements, enabling full-scale mass reconstruction from the cluster core to the outskirts. We validate CLUMI+ using synthetic weak-lensing and phase-space data for a massive cluster from the IllustrisTNG simulations, demonstrating unbiased recovery of projected and three-dimensional mass profiles and achieving 10%--30% improvement in precision at large radii. As a case study, we apply CLUMI+ to Abell 2261, combining Subaru and Hubble Space Telescope weak+strong lensing data with spectroscopic measurements from the Hectospec Cluster Survey. This analysis demonstrates the power of multi-probe, equilibrium-free modeling for robust cluster mass reconstruction.
#### Physical Conditions of the Ionized Superwind in NGC 253 with VLT/MUSE

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of the H$\alpha$-emitting ionized gas in the warm phase of the NGC 253 outflow using integral field spectroscopy from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE). In each spaxel, we decompose H$\alpha$, [N II], and [S II] emission lines into a system of up to 3 Gaussian components, accounting for the velocity contributions due to the disk and both intercepted walls of an outflow cone. In the approaching southern lobe of the outflow, we find maximum deprojected outflow velocities down to ~ -500 km/s. Velocity gradients of this outflowing gas range from ~ -350 to -550 km/s/kpc with increasing distance from the nucleus. Additionally, [N II]/H$\alpha$ and [S II]/H$\alpha$ integrated line ratios are suggestive of shocks as the dominant ionization source throughout the wind. Electron densities, inferred from the [S II] doublet, peak at 2100 cm$^{-3}$ near the nucleus and reach $\lesssim 50 $cm$^{-3}$ in the wind. Finally, at an uncertainty of 0.3 dex on the inferred mass of $4\times10^{5}$ M$_{\odot}$, the mass-outflow rate of the H$\alpha$-emitting gas in the southern outflow lobe is ~ 0.4 M$_{\odot}$/year. This yields a mass-loading factor of $\eta$ ~ 0.1 and a ~ 2% starburst energy efficiency.

 - **Abstract**
 The long-term dynamical future of the Sun's planets has been simulated and statistically analyzed in great detail, but most prior work considers the solar system as completely isolated, neglecting the potential influence of field star passages. To understand the dynamical significance of field star encounters, we simulate several thousand realizations of the modern solar system in the presence of passing field stars for 5 Gyrs. We find that the impulse gradient of the strongest stellar encounter largely determines the net dynamical effect of field stars. Because the expected strength of such an encounter is uncertain by multiple orders of magnitude, the possible significance of field stars can be large. Our simulations indicate that isolated models of the solar system can underestimate the degree of our giant planets' future secular orbital changes by over an order of magnitude. In addition, our planets and Pluto are significantly less stable than previously thought. Field stars transform Pluto from a completely stable object over 5 Gyrs to one with a ~5% instability probability. Furthermore, field stars increase the odds of Mercury's instability by ~50-80%. We also find a ~0.3% chance that Mars will be lost through collision or ejection and a ~0.2% probability that Earth will be involved in a planetary collision or ejected. Compared to previously studied instabilities in isolated solar systems models, those induced by field stars are much more likely to involve the loss of multiple planets. In addition, they typically happen sooner in our solar system's future, making field star passages the most likely cause of instability for the next 4-4.5 Gyrs.
#### SRG/ART-XC discovery of pulsations from RX J0535.0-6700: another X-ray pulsar in the LMC

 - **Abstract**
 Using the Mikhail Pavlinsky ART-XC onboard the SRG observatory we have detected, for the first time, X-ray pulsations with a period of ~106 s from the poorly-studied high-mass X-ray binary RX J0535.0-6700 located in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), thus proving that the accretor is a neutron star with strong magnetic field. Pulsations with similar period were also found in archival archival data from Chandra and XMM-Newton telescopes. Using photometry from WISE we shown that the source demonstrate significant variability in IR during the last twenty years, which could be caused by a secular evolution of the decretion disk. This discovery makes RX J0535.0-6700 another member of the large family of X-ray pulsars with Be-type companions in the LMC.
#### Constraining the environment of compact binary mergers with self-lensing signatures

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational waves (GWs) from coalescing binary black holes (BBHs) can come from different environments. GWs interact gravitationally with astrophysical objects, which makes it possible to use gravitational lensing by nearby objects (self-lensing) to learn about their environments. We quantify the probability of self-lensing through the optical depth $\tau$ for the main channels of detectable GWs at frequencies $f_{\rm GW}\sim (1-10^3)\,{\rm Hz}$. We then analyze the detectability of the lensing effect (imprint). In star clusters, the probability of self-lensing by stellar-mass black holes (BHs) is low ($\tau\simeq10^{-7}$), even when taking into account nearby BHs in resonant interactions ($\tau\simeq 10^{-5}$). Additionally, the lensing imprint of a stellar-mass lens (diffraction and interference) is too marginal to be detectable by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detectors and most Einstein Telescope signals. For a massive BH lens in the center of a cluster, the probability can reach $\tau\simeq 10^{-4}$ either via von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai induced mergers of BBHs orbiting a central massive BH or BBHs formed as GW captures in single-single interactions in the Bahcall-Wolf cusp of a nuclear cluster, likely eccentric. For self-lensing by a supermassive BH for BBHs in the migration trap of an AGN (active galactic nucleus) disk, $\tau \simeq 10^{-2}$. The imprint of these massive lenses are two images that are easily detectable already in current detectors. Moreover, AGN disk merger signals have a distinct linear $h_+$ polarization. The probability depends on the extent of the detectability through the threshold impact parameter $y_{\rm max}$, which can increase for future detectors. We conclude that constraining the environment of BBHs is possible by combining self-lensing imprints with other waveform signatures such as eccentricity and polarization.
#### SHELLQs. Bridging the gap: JWST unveils obscured quasars in the most luminous galaxies at z > 6

 - **Abstract**
 The unprecedented sensitivity of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has uncovered a surprisingly abundant population of mildly obscured, low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the epoch of reionization (EoR). However, the link between these objects and classical unobscured quasars remains a mystery. Here we report the discovery of obscured quasars hosted by the most luminous galaxies at $z > 6$, possibly bridging the gap between the two AGN populations. The 13 objects presented here were originally selected from a rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) imaging survey over $>$1000 deg$^2$, and were known to have luminous ($>10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$) narrow Ly$\alpha$ emission. With JWST/NIRSpec follow-up observations, we found that nine of them exhibit a broad component in H I Balmer lines and He I lines, but not in [O III] and other forbidden lines. Mild dust obscuration ($0 < A_V < 3$) is inferred from the Balmer decrements. The estimated intrinsic luminosities suggest that our broad line (BL) objects are the long-sought UV-obscured counterparts of luminous quasars in the EoR. They host supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with masses $10^{7.8 - 9.1} M_\odot$, undergoing sub-Eddington to Eddington accretion. Most of the BL objects are spatially unresolved, and are close to "little red dots" with their blue rest-UV and red rest-optical colors. We estimate the AGN number density among similarly luminous Ly$\alpha$ emitters to be larger than $2 \times 10^{-8}$ Mpc$^{-3}$. This density is comparable to that of classical quasars with similar continuum luminosities, suggesting that a substantial fraction of active SMBHs are obscured in the EoR and have been overlooked in past rest-UV surveys.
#### Subaru High-z Exploration of Low-Luminosity Quasars (SHELLQs) XXII. Chandra observations of narrow-line quasar candidates at z>6

 - **Abstract**
 We report on Chandra X-ray observations of four narrow-line quasar candidates at z~6, selected from the SHELLQs project, based on the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam survey. These objects are characterised by narrow (FWHM<310 km/s), luminous (>1e44 erg/s) Lya and faint UV continuum (M_1450 = -22 - -21), prompting us to examine whether they are obscured luminous AGN at the epoch of reionization. However, none of these objects were detected by Chandra, giving an upper limit to their rest-frame 2-10 keV luminosity (Lx) of 2e44 erg/s (2 sigma), assuming a spectral slope Gamma=2. Subsequent rest-frame optical spectroscopy of these objects by the JWST-NIRSpec, presented in a companion paper, show weak broad Balmer emission at the base of narrow cores. With the scaling relation for low-redshift AGN, the observed strong [OIII]5007 flux of these sources would predict Lx to be around 1e45 erg/s, which is well above the Chandra upper limits. These optical spectra and X-ray quietness are reminiscent of JWST-selected broad-line AGN. We attribute the weak broad Balmer emission to the broad-line regions hidden partially by optically-thick obscuring matter which also hides the optical and X-ray continuum emission from the accretion disc. Compton-thick obscuration, which would strongly suppress X-ray emission, could be due to a dense inter-stellar medium that is often present in galaxies at high redshifts. Alternatively, the same effect could be obtained from an inflated disc at the innermost radii in a supercritical accretion flow, when the disc is viewed at inclined angles.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the discovery and analysis of the sixth microlensing two-planet system, KMT-2022-BLG-1818Lb,c, detected by a follow-up program targeting high-magnification events. Both planets are subject to the well-known ''Close/Wide'' degeneracy, although for the first planet, which has a super-Jovian mass ratio of $q_2 \simeq 5\times 10^{-3}$ in both solutions, the Close topology, with a normalized separation of $s\simeq 0.70$, is clearly preferred by $\Delta\chi^2=26$. However, contrary to all previous two-planet microlensing systems, the mass ratio for the second planet, $q_3$, is substantially (factor of $\sim 10$) different for the Close and Wide topologies of the first planet. While this degeneracy is resolved in the present case due to high-cadence follow-up observations, the appearance of this new degeneracy indicates the need for caution in the analysis of future two-planet systems. A Bayesian analysis suggests that the host is likely a K-dwarf star in the Galactic disk. The first planet is probably a super-Jupiter on a Jupiter-like orbit, while the second planet is a Saturn-class planet on either a Mercury-like or Saturn-like orbit.

 - **Abstract**
 One of the most remarkable results from the \emph{James Webb Space Telescope} has been the discovery of a large population of compact sources exhibiting strong broad H$\alpha$ emission, typically interpreted to be low-luminosity broad-line (Type 1) active galactic nuclei (BLAGN). An important question is whether these observations are in tension with galaxy formation models, and if so how? While comparisons have been made using physical properties (i.e.~black hole mass and accretion rate) inferred from observations, these require the use of SED modelling assumptions, or locally inferred scaling relations, which may be unjustified, at least in the distant high-redshift Universe. In this work we take an alternative approach and forward model predictions from the First Light And Reionisation Epoch Simulations (FLARES) suite of cosmological hydrodynamical zoom simulations to predict the observable properties of BLAGN. We achieve this by first coupling \flares\ with the \qsosed\ model to predict the ionising photon luminosities of high-redshift ($z>5$) AGN. To model the observed broad H$\alpha$ emission we then assume a constant conversion factor and covering fraction, and the fraction of AGN that have observable broad-lines. With a reasonable choice of these parameters, \flares\ is able to reproduce observational constraints on the H$\alpha$ luminosity function and equivalent width distribution at $z=5$.
#### Decoding the molecular torus of NGC 1068: Insights into its structure and kinematics from high-resolution ALMA observations

 - **Abstract**
 We dissect the kinematics and morphology of the molecular gas within the near-nuclear region of NGC 1068 to understand the mechanisms in the central AGN that might be fueling it, and the impact of its energy output on the surrounding molecular gas. We present high angular and spectral resolution ALMA observations of the HCO$^+$4->3 and CO 3->2 molecular lines in the near-nuclear region of the prototype Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 1068. The spatial resolution (1.1~pc) is almost two times better than that of previous works studying the same molecular lines at the same transitions and is the highest resolution achievable with ALMA at these frequencies. Our analysis focuses on moment maps, position-velocity (PV) diagrams, and spectra obtained at the position of the nuclear continuum source, along with a simple kinematic model developed using the 3DBarolo software. Our observations reveal significant asymmetry between the eastern and western sides of the nuclear disc in terms of morphology, velocity, and line intensity. The broad lines seen in the inner 2 pc could be accounted for by either beam smearing or highly turbulent gas in this region. Outside this radius the mean velocities drop to $\pm$30 km/s, which cannot be explained by asymmetric drift. We find low velocity connections extending to 13 pc suggesting interactions with larger scale structures. The CO/HCO$^+$ line ratio at the nucleus reported here are extremely low compared to values in the literature of the same galaxy at lower spatial resolutions.
#### The Emergence of Little Red Dots from Binary Massive Black Holes

 - **Abstract**
 Little red dots (LRDs) are a newly identified class of broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGN) with a distinctive v-shape spectrum characterized by red optical and blue UV continuum emission. Their high abundance at redshifts of $z\sim6-8$ and decline at lower redshifts suggest a transient origin. We propose that the spectral shape of LRDs originates from compact binary black hole systems, where each black hole is surrounded by a mini-disk and embedded in a larger circum-binary disk. With a binary separation of $\lesssim 10^3$ Schwarzschild radii, the Wien tail of a $T\simeq 5000~{\rm K}$ blackbody spectrum at the inner edge of the circum-binary disk produces the red optical emission, while the mini-disks power the UV continuum. Binary torques carve out a gap between the circum-binary disk and mini-disks, setting the turnover wavelength of the v-shaped spectrum around the Balmer limit. This scenario naturally reproduces LRD spectra requiring only modest dust attenuation ($A_V\lesssim 1$ mag), resolving overestimated luminosities for LRDs in previous studies and alleviating a tension with the so-called Soltan argument. This model predicts a distinct spectral evolution as the binary orbit decays through binary-disk interactions and gravitational waves (GWs), linking early-stage "proto-LRD" binaries to the broader AGN population and late-stage "LRD-descendants" to coalescing binaries detectable in GW experiments.
#### Late-blooming magnetars: awakening as ultra-long period objects after a dormant cooling epoch

 - **Abstract**
 Ultra-long period transients (ULPs) are an elusive class of compact objects uncovered by radio surveys. While magnetars are a leading candidate for isolated ULPs, several observational properties challenge the established evolutionary framework: (i) low quiescent X-ray luminosities, (ii) $\sim$~hour-long rotational periods, and (iii) highly-variable radio flux. It is shown via magnetothermal modelling that, if electric currents thread the fluid core at the time of crust freezing, the neutron star remains multiband silent for an initial period of approximately 0.1 Myr while cooling passively. Once the crust becomes cold enough, the Hall effect begins to dominate the magnetic evolution, triggering crustal failures that inject magnetospheric twist that initiates radio pulsing while depleting rotational kinetic energy from an already-slow star. Depending on where electric currents circulate, such 'late-blooming' magnetars manifesting as Galactic ULPs may thus form a distinct branch from soft gamma repeaters and anomalous X-ray pulsars.
#### Significant reflection and absorption effects in the X-ray emission of the Intermediate Polar IGR J17195-4100

 - **Abstract**
 X-ray emission is from shock-heated plasma in magnetic cataclysmic variables, and is processed by absorption and scattering before reaching the observer. We investigate these effects in the X-ray emission of the Intermediate Polar IGR J17195-4100 by carrying out the X-ray spectral analysis, spin modulation and hardness ratio. We present high-sensitivity broadband X-ray spectral analysis by combining NuSTAR and XMM-Newton observations in the 0.3-78.0 keV energy range. The X-ray spectral analysis is performed using six composite models, including the angle-dependent reflection model (reflect), multi-temperature plasma emission models (CEVMKL, MKCFLOW), and photoionised and/or neutral partially covering absorption models (zxipcf, pcfabs) within XSPEC. We examine also the spin modulation in four energy ranges and the hardness ratio, to determine the absorption and scattering effects. We find that the spectrum is best modelled with a reflection amplitude ($\Omega$) of 0.58 $^{+0.38}_{-0.26}$, an ionisation parameter, log($\xi$), of 1.46$^{+0.44}_{-0.23}$ with an equivalent hydrogen column density of 3.09$^{+2.26}_{-0.68}$ $\times$ 10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$, a neutral absorber, and a multi-temperature plasma temperature of 27.14$^{+2.0}_{-2.13}$ keV. In addition, we detect effects of electron scattering in the NuSTAR band, leading to modulation amplitude of about a steady 9$\%$ that increases up to 15$\%$ after 20 keV. We stress that these effects significantly affect the X-ray emission of intermediate polars and should be considered to obtain a good representation of the intrinsic spectrum.
#### Resolution of the Solar Convective Conundrum? New Results Using the Time-Distance Deep-Focus Method

 - **Abstract**
 We re-examine the deep-focus methodology of time-distance helioseismology previously used to estimate the power spectrum of the solar convection at a depth of about 30 Mm, which was found to be significantly weaker than predicted by theory and simulations. The Global Acoustic, Linearized Euler (GALE) and Eulerian Lagrangian (EULAG) codes are used to generate ground-truth simulations through which the accuracy of the convective power spectrum can be evaluated. This validation process shows that the power spectrum diverges significantly from ground truth beyond spatial scales corresponding to the spherical harmonic degree $\ell=15$ - $30$ because of the limited resolution of helioseismic measurements. However, the power estimated at larger spatial scales ($\ell<15$) is sufficiently accurate. We then apply the methodology to solar data and find a spectrum that is substantially stronger than previously reported. We discuss some possible differences in methodology that might have led to the initial under-estimation of solar convective power. The new spectra are in line with recent hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic simulations of solar convection and also consistent with the previous inferences obtained by the ring-diagram local-helioseismology method.
