#### A long time ago in an LAE far, far away: a signpost of early reionization or a nascent AGN at $z=13$?

 - **Abstract**
 The JADES survey recently reported the discovery of JADES-GS-z13-1-LA at $z = 13$, the highest redshift Ly$\alpha$ emitter (LAE) ever observed. This observation suggests that either the intergalactic medium (IGM) surrounding JADES-GS-z13-1-LA is highly ionized, or the galaxy's intrinsic Ly$\alpha$ emission properties are extreme. We use radiative transfer simulations of reionization that capture the distribution of ionized gas in the $z = 13$ IGM to investigate the implications of JADES-GS-z13-1-LA for reionization. We find that if JADES-GS-z13-1-LA is a typical star forming galaxy (SFG) with properties characteristic of LAEs at $z \sim 6$, its detection suggests that the universe is $\gtrsim 5\%$ ionized by $z = 13$. We also investigate the possibility that the extreme properties of JADES-GS-z13-1-LA are driven by an AGN. Using a simple analysis based on the fact that AGN are expected to produce more ionizing photons than SFGs, we estimate that the likelihood that JADES-GS-z13-1-LA hosts an AGN is $88\%$, $66\%$, and $33\%$ if the IGM is $< 1\%$, $\approx 5\%$ and $\approx 25\%$ ionized, respectively. We also highlight other features in the spectrum of JADES-GS-z13-1-LA that may be indicative of AGN activity, including strong Ly$\alpha$ damping wing absorption extending to $\sim 1300$ angstroms, and a possible CII*$\lambda1335$ emission line. Our findings strongly motivate dedicated follow-up observations of JADES-GS-z13-1-LA to determine whether it hosts an AGN.

 - **Abstract**
 A comprehensive account of the cosmic star-formation history demands an accurate census of dust-enshrouded star formation over cosmic time. We provide strong new constraints from a large sample of 777 red galaxies, selected based on their dust-reddened, rest-frame UV-optical emission. This sample of 777 galaxies spans $1 < z < 8$ and is selected from PRIMER JWST NIRCam and HST COSMOS optical data, ensuring robust colour criteria. The SEDs indicate that these dust-reddened galaxies are star-forming, with median $\mathrm{SFR \sim 40M_{\odot}yr^{-1}}$ and stellar mass $\log(M_{*}/M_{\odot}) = 10.3^{+0.6}_{-0.8}$; each exceeds the corresponding medians of the full JWST-detected population by over two dex. Our sample thus clearly shows that red galaxies dominate the high-mass end: they comprise 72 \% of galaxies with $\log(M/M_{\odot}) > 10$ at $z = 3.3$, rising to 91\% by $z \sim 7$ (albeit with large uncertainties at the highest redshifts). Crucially, we find that the number density of massive red star-forming galaxies at $z \sim 6$ is sufficient to explain the abundance of quiescent galaxies at $z > 3$, consistent with typical quenching timescales allowed in the $\mathrm{\sim 1Gyr}$ interval from $z \sim 6$ to $z \sim 3$. This large abundance yields a substantial contribution to the cosmic star-formation rate density: at $z \sim 4$, red galaxies provide $\mathrm {\rho_{SFR} = 3.9^{+0.6}_{-0.5} \times 10^{-2} M_{\odot} yr^{-1}Mpc^{-3}}$, and at $z \sim 5$ they supply nearly 40 \% of the total $\rho_{SFR}$. This exceeds the contribution of bright sub(mm)-selected dusty star-forming galaxies by more than an order of magnitude. Future deeper and wider ALMA surveys will provide further opportunities to strengthen and extend our results in our quest to fully quantify the contribution of dust-obscured activity to $\rho_{\mathrm{SFR}}$ at high redshifts.

 - **Abstract**
 Binary supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are consequences of galaxy mergers and dominate the low-frequency gravitational wave background. Finding binary SMBHs in existing time-domain observations has proven difficult, as their periodic, electromagnetic signals can be confused with the natural variability of single quasars. In this work, we investigate the effects of host-galaxy contamination and survey design (cadence and duration) on the detectability of binary SMBHs with the upcoming Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). We simulate millions of LSST light curves of single and binary quasars, with a distribution of quasar and host-galaxy properties motivated by empirical observations and the anticipated LSST detection space. We then apply simple sinusoidal curve fits as a potential, computationally inexpensive detection method. We find that host-galaxy contamination will increase false-positive rates and decrease binary parameter recovery rates. Lower mass, lower luminosity binary systems are most likely to be negatively affected by host galaxy contamination. We also find that monitoring duration affects binary detection more than survey effective cadence for this detection method. As the light curve duration increases, false-positive rates are suppressed and binary parameter recovery rates, especially for binary period, are improved. Increasing the light curve duration from 5 to 10 yrs shows the most dramatic improvement for successful binary detection and false-positive rejection, with additional improvement from extending the light curve duration to 20 yrs. The observation duration increase is especially critical for recovering binary periods that are longer than a decade.
#### Can dynamic dark energy explain the $S_8$ tension, the `lensing is low' effect, or strong baryon feedback?

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the impact of a DESI motivated dynamic dark energy cosmology on three cosmological anomalies, the $S_8$ tension, the `lensing is low' effect, and observations of strong baryonic feedback. We analyze how these observations vary in $\Lambda$CDM versus dynamic dark energy. We find that the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal is reduced by up to 7% with respect to galaxy clustering and that cosmic shear is suppressed by 14%. These differences are primarily caused by changes to cosmological distance measures which enter the lensing efficiency kernels. In contrast, we find that dynamic dark energy increases the thermal Sunyaev Zeldovich signal by about 15%, but that this is insufficient to substantially reduce the magnitude of baryonic effects. Thus, we find that dynamic dark energy may help explain two out of these three cosmological anomalies. DESI's dynamic dark energy has an important impact on cosmic expansion at $z\lesssim 0.5$, a regime where baryon acoustic oscillations are limited by the small volume. Because lensing is sensitive to distances, in addition to growth, we argue that lensing measurements are a promising alternative to constrain expansion deviations from $\Lambda$ at low redshifts.
#### Excavating The Ruins: an Ancient $z=2.675$ Galaxy Which Formed in the First 500 Myr

 - **Abstract**
 We present the analysis of an ancient galaxy at $z=2.675$ which we dub ``Eridu.'' Simultaneously modeling the JWST/NIRSpec G140M and G235M spectra from the SMILES program and $0.4-25\ \mu\mathrm{m}$ HST, JWST/NIRCam, and JWST/MIRI photometry from the the JADES+SMILES photometric catalogs shows that Eridu is massive and quiescent with stellar mass $\log(M_*/\mathrm{M_\odot})=10.96^{+0.01}_{-0.01}$ and average star formation rate $<1\ \mathrm{M_\odot\ yr^{-1}}$ over the last 100 Myr. Star formation histories inferred from various models produce disconcertingly early and fast formation within $\sim300$ Myr of the Big Bang and quenching 2 Gyr prior to observation ($z\sim10$). This stellar mass assembly implies that the progenitor of Eridu had $M_*\approx10^{11}\ \mathrm{M_\odot}$ at $z>10$, nearly two orders of magnitude more than the most massive current high redshift observations. From Eridu's spectrum we infer $\mathrm{[Mg/Fe]} =+0.65^{+0.20}_{-0.19}$, indicating its stellar population is extremely $\alpha$-enhanced, which is consistent with the rapid formation timescale inferred from its star formation history. Eridu inhabits a massive protostructure which offers additional explanations for rapid mass assembly and quenching via environmental mechanisms, e.g. major mergers. Though its inferred formation is at odds with observations of the brightest cosmic dawn galaxies, we anticipate that future high-redshift galaxy formation models and sophisticated stellar population modeling codes will unearth how Eridu formed at the dawn of time.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The advent of the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) will increase the collecting area by more than an order of magnitude compared to the individual Unit Telescopes of the Very Large Telescope (VLT). Fainter spectrophotometric standard stars than those currently available in the V = 11 to 13 mag (K = 12 to 14 mag) range are required for spectroscopic observations with instruments such as the Multi-AO Imaging Camera for Deep Observations (MICADO) on the ELT, notably in the near-infrared wavelength regime. Aims. We identify suitable spectrophotometric standard stars among white dwarfs with hydrogen atmospheres (DA white dwarfs) in the magnitude range K =14 to 16 mag and provide reference data based on stellar model atmospheres. Methods. We observed 24 candidate DA white dwarfs with the X-shooter instrument on the VLT, covering the wavelength range 300 nm to 2480 nm in three arms. We took care to include stars at latitudes below and above -25 degrees to allow observations for all wind directions at the location of the ELT. The spectra were analysed using model fluxes from 3D pure-hydrogen local thermodynamic equilibrium model atmospheres and multi-band photometry. From the sample of observed targets, we selected 14 reliable flux calibrators. For these targets, the residuals from the match between the model best-fit models and the observed spectra across the full wavelength range are < 3%, with the exception of the UV regions affected by the ozone Huggins bands (300 nm - 340 nm) and regions contaminated by telluric lines. Results. We have identified and fully characterised 14 DA white dwarfs that can be used as spectrophotometric standard stars for the MICADO instrument as well as any other future instrument with similar requirements in the brightness range, K = 14 to 16 mag (Vegamag), and provide reference fluxes

 - **Abstract**
 We present a method for accurately and precisely inferring photometric dust extinction towards stars at mid-to-high Galactic latitudes using probabilistic machine learning to model the colour-magnitude distribution of zero-extinction stars in these regions. Photometric dust maps rely on a robust method for inferring stellar reddening. At high Galactic latitudes, where extinction is low, such inferences are particularly susceptible to contamination from modelling errors and prior assumptions, potentially introducing artificial structure into dust maps. In this work, we demonstrate the use of normalising flows to learn the conditional probability distribution of the photometric colour-magnitude relations of zero-extinction stars, conditioned on Galactic cylindrical coordinates for stars within 2.5 kpc at mid-to-high Galactic latitudes. By using the normalising flow to model the colour-magnitude diagram, we infer the posterior distribution of dust extinction towards stars along different lines of sight by marginalising over the flow. We validate our method using data from Gaia, Pan-STARRS, and 2MASS, showing that we recover unbiased posteriors and successfully detect dust along the line of sight in two calibration regions at mid-Galactic latitude that have been extensively studied in the context of polarisation surveys.
#### Fast Radio Bursts from non-resonant Alfvén waves and synchrotron maser emission in the magnetar wind

 - **Abstract**
 Non-resonant interactions between Alfvén waves and a relativistic plasma result in the formation of the population inversions necessary for synchrotron maser emission (SME) across a wide range of magnetisations and temperatures. We calculate the peak frequencies of the SME resulting from this interaction and show that the characteristic frequencies and energetics of fast radio bursts (FRBs) can be produced in the relativistic wind of a magnetar using this mechanism. Wind Lorentz factors of $\gamma_w\gtrsim310$ are shown to be necessary to explain observed FRBs. Emission is possible at temperatures of $\theta = k_bT/mc^2\lesssim 0.02$. We further examine the periods and magnetic fields of the central magnetar and demonstrate that the optimal values of these properties align with the observed magnetar population provided that the magnetosphere is disturbed by the flaring activity. These results allow the properties of the environment such as temperature and magnetisation to be probed from the observed FRB frequency and luminosity.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study we investigate the axisymmetric, weakly turbulent state of settled particle layers in a localized model of a protoplanetary disk. We focus on conditions in which the large-scale axisymmetric filaments typically associated with the streaming instability (SI) either cannot form or have not yet developed. Under these circumstances, we observe small-scale particle clumping consistent with turbulent concentration (TC), in which short particle filaments collect along regions of high gas strain rate and enclose gas-only voids exhibiting coherent vorticity. Despite varying particle Stokes numbers $\St_K$ which are defined relative to the Keplerian frequency, the {\it effective} Stokes numbers within voids, $\St_\omega$ -- defined instead relative to the local gas vorticity -- consistently center around 0.3. The latter coincides with the special value identified in prior statistical studies of TC as the scale where particle clustering is most intermittent. This convergence likely reflects how particle feedback structures and sustains voids -- an effect possibly distinctive to axisymmetric configurations. A timescale comparison reveals that in simulations with midplane particle-to-gas density ratios below unity and $\St_K \ll 1$, SI growth rates are 1 -- 2 orders of magnitude slower than the turbulent overturn frequencies at the driving scale. This disparity appears to effectively rule out SI as the primary driver of turbulence in these cases. Instead, we suggest the Symmetric Instability (SymI) may be responsible. We further observe that for St$_K\ll 1$, TC is a persistent feature of turbulent particle layers , and that Roche-exceeding small-scale fluctuations within large-scale SI filaments reported in the literature are in fact not SI, but expressions of TC amplified by the elevated particle densities within those large-scale structures.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the highest-resolution H$\alpha$ observations of a solar flare to date, collected during the decay phase of an X1.3-class flare on 8 August 2024 at 20:12 UT. Observations with the Visible Broadband Imager at the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope reveal dark coronal loop strands at unprecedented spatial resolution in the flare arcade above highly structured chromospheric flare ribbons. After surveying the 20 best-seeing images, we calculate a mean loop width near the top of the arcade of 48.2 km, with a minimum loop width of ~21 km and distribution mode of ~43 km. The distributions of loop widths observed by the DKIST in our study are often symmetric about the mean loop width. This is initial evidence that the DKIST may be capable of resolving the fundamental scale of coronal loops, although further investigation is required to confirm this result. We demonstrate that the resolving power of the DKIST represents a significant step towards advancing modern flare models and our understanding of fine structure in the coronal magnetic field.
#### Evolution of magnetized hub-filament systems: Comparing the observed properties of W3(OH), W3 Main, and S 106

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we examine three cluster-forming hub-filament systems (HFS) - W3(OH), W3 Main, and S 106 - spanning evolutionary stages from early to advanced, with a focus on their magnetic field (B-field) structures and filament line-mass distributions. Our goal is to identify indicators of HFS evolution, particularly within their hubs, as star formation progresses. Our analysis combines observations of dense star-forming gas and young stellar populations. We present new JCMT/POL-2 observations of 850micron dust polarized emission to probe magnetic field morphology and dense gas structures. Archival infrared and radio data are also used to trace star formation activity. We derive radial column density profiles centered on the hubs to define distinct filament and hub regions. We then analyze histograms of line mass, polarization intensity (PI), polarization fraction (PF), and the relative orientation between B-fields and filaments. As HFS evolve, we observe changes in the filament line-mass function (FLMF), PF, and B-field-filament alignment - especially within the hub, which also increases in size. Massive bipolar outflows and radiation bubbles reshape the plane-of-sky B-fields, aligning them with cavity walls and shells, consistent with known rearrangements near HII regions. We also find a notable similarity between hub sizes and young cluster radii. "Double-node" star formation - where two subregions within a hub show different evolutionary stages - emerges as a common HFS feature. We present evidence for its widespread occurrence across several well-studied, nearby star-forming clouds.
#### Fast radio bursts by stellar wind microlensing of a faint background source

 - **Abstract**
 By assuming the inverse square law of solar wind plasma density as representative of other stars, it is shown that just outside a star the {\it outward} deflection of a passing radio signal at $\nu\approx 1$~GHz (which is capable of penetrating the plasma) is about 5 times larger than the gravitational inward deflection by the star, and the ensuing lens equation which takes both effects into account is a cubic polynomial with three roots and a new strong lensing caustic. The geometric optics approach is valid for a radio source size $\lesssim 1$~pc. Microlensing magnification of a steady background source occurs typically over a timescale of milliseconds, resulting in $\approx 80$ Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) per day over the whole sky, which can only perturb the isotropy of FRB distribution at the several \% level. Moreover, repeating FRBs could be triggered by the periodic interception of the line-of-sight of the background source by members of a binary system. The temporal signatures of such FRBs are consistent with the power spectrum of solar wind density fluctuations on corresponding scales, except the mean density of the wind is a few times higher than the solar value.
#### Impacts of Atmospheric Carbon Species and Stellar Type on Climates of Terrestrial Planets

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.05975

 - **Abstract**
 The climates of terrestrial planets are largely determined by the composition of their atmospheres and spectral types of their host stars. Previous studies suggest a wide range of carbon species abundances (CO\textsubscript{2}, CO, and CH\textsubscript{4}) can result from variations in reducing fluxes and stellar spectral types which influence photochemistry. However, a systematic investigation of how varying carbon species, particularly CO, affect planetary climates across wide parameter spaces remains limited. Here, we employ a one-dimensional radiative-convective equilibrium model to examine the dependence of planetary climate on the abundances of carbon species and host star type. We find that CO, due to weak absorption of stellar radiation, induces only moderate changes in stratospheric temperature, while its effect on surface temperature is negligible. Under Earth-like $p_\mathrm{N_2}$ (where $p_\mathrm{i}$ is the partial pressure on the surface of species i), for cases with fixed $p_\mathrm{CO_2}$, increase in CO leads to surface cooling on planets orbiting Sun-like stars unless the sum of $p_\mathrm{CO_2}$ and $p_\mathrm{CH_4}$ exceeds $\sim$1 bar. Whereas it results in surface warming for planets around M-type stars. When the total pressure of carbon species is fixed, converting CO\textsubscript{2} or CH\textsubscript{4} into CO always induces cooling. These effects arise from a combination of CO Rayleigh scattering, pressure broadening of greenhouse gas absorption lines, and \textcolor{red}{varying water vapor levels}. We further discuss how CO- and CH\textsubscript{4}-driven cooling (warming) can trigger positive (negative) climate-photochemistry feedback, influencing atmospheric evolution. Additionally, we suggest CO-rich planets may be less susceptible to water loss and atmospheric oxidation due to lower stratospheric water vapor content.
#### Radio continuum and \HI 21-cm line observations of a nearby luminous infrared galaxy IRAS 17526+3253

 - **Abstract**
 We present results from our EVN and GMRT observations of the radio continuum and spectral line emission in IRAS 17526+3253, along with an analysis of its arcsecond-scale radio properties using archival VLA data. The EVN observations detected radio continuum emission from both the northwest (NW) and southeast (SE) nuclei. The NW nucleus shows two components with high brightness temperatures and radio luminosities, likely indicating the presence of an AGN core and jet. Meanwhile, our EVN observation failed to detect the OH line emission, possibly due to radio frequency interference and/or the emission being partly resolved out and below our detection limit. The multi-band radio spectral energy distribution (SED) deviates from a single power-law at low frequencies, suggesting low-frequency absorption. The GMRT spectral line data reveal both \HI absorption and emission. The \HI emission is diffuse and shows a velocity gradient from about 7500 \kms in the NW to 7800 \kms in the SE nucleus. On larger scales, the \HI emission extends about 4' along the NW-SE direction, with the southeastern extension matching the optical tidal tail. In addition, the weak \HI absorption features show broad line profiles, possibly due to overlapping \HI gas from the two nuclei. The aforementioned results are consistent with properties of intermediate-stage mergers reported in the literature.

 - **Abstract**
 Low-velocity large-scale shocks impacting on the ISM may efficiently shape molecular clouds and trigger star formation within them. These shocks, both driven by galactic bubbles and/or cloud-cloud collisions, leave specific signatures in the gas morphology and kinematics. Observational studies of such signatures are crucial to investigate if and how shocks affect the clouds formation process and trigger their future star formation. We have analysed the shocked and dense gas tracers SiO(2-1) and H13CO+(1-0) emission toward the IRDC G035.39-00.33, using new, larger-scale maps obtained with the 30m telescope at the Instituto de Radioastronomìa Millimétrica. We find that the dense gas is organised into a northern and a southern filament having different velocities and tilted orientation with respect to each other. The two filaments are spatially separated yet connected by a faint bridge feature also seen in a position-velocity diagram extracted across the cloud. This bridge-feature, typical of cloud-cloud collisions, also coincides with a very spectrally narrow SiO-traced emission. The northern filament is suggested to be interacting with the nearby supernova remnant G035.6-0.4. Toward the southern filament, we also report the presence of a parsec-scale, spectrally narrow SiO emission likely driven by the interaction between this filament and a nearby expanding shell. The shell is visible in the 1.3 GHz and 610 MHz continuum images and our preliminary analysis suggests it may be the relic of a supernova remnant. We conclude that the two filaments represent the densest part of two colliding clouds, pushed toward each other by nearby Supernova Remnants. We speculate that this cloud-cloud collision driven by stellar feedback may have assembled the infrared dark cloud. We also evaluate the possibility that star formation may have been triggered within G035.39-00.33 by the collision.

 - **Abstract**
 We developed a one-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation code to investigate the long-term evolution of protoplanetary disks with low computational cost. In this simulation code, the physical processes necessary for protostellar formation and protoplanetary disk evolution, such as magnetic braking, non-ideal MHD effects, and angular momentum transport due to viscosity, are implemented. Using this simulation code, we performed the simulations of the long-term evolution of protoplanetary disks starting from the molecular cloud. Our simulation results suggest that the disk size and mass are a few tens of au and $\sim 0.01 M_\odot$ at $10^5$ years after protostellar formation. These values were relatively consistent with observations. The disk evolves through magnetic braking, and its radial profiles are consistent with the analytical solutions of previous studies. Our simulation code will be an important tool for studying the long-term evolution of protoplanetary disks.

 - **Abstract**
 Relativistic shocks are considered efficient accelerators of charged particles and play crucial roles in high-energy astrophysical phenomena, such as gamma-ray bursts and pulsar winds. This study focuses on positron accelerations in magnetized relativistic shocks in electron-positron-ion plasma. Employing one-dimensional ab initio particle-in-cell simulations, we found a preferential positron acceleration through an interaction with the wakefield associated with a precursor wave in the upstream region. Test particle simulations revealed that the selective acceleration occurs for sufficiently large amplitudes of the wakefield. The mechanism can be understood as the relativistic $\boldsymbol{E}\times\boldsymbol{B}$ acceleration formulated in the upstream frame. A theoretical analysis of the positron acceleration in astrophysical contexts is presented, supporting ultra-relativistic shocks in pulsar winds as a primary source for the high-energy positron excess.

 - **Abstract**
 We analytically model stationary and axisymmetric active galactic nucleus jets, assuming energy conservation along each magnetic flux tube. Using very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations and published general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we constrain the evolution of the bulk Lorentz factor, the magnetization parameter, and the magnetic field strength along the jet. We then infer the electron density, emission coefficient, and absorption coefficient at each point, and integrate the radiative transfer equation to compute the spectral energy distribution (SED) and the core shift of the synchrotron emission from the relativistic jet. Applying the method to the M87 jet, we find that the hot plasmas are injected at the altitude of seven Schwarzschild radii from the black hole (BH), that the M87 jet is likely composed of a pair plasma, and that the jet flowline geometry is quasi-parabolic as reported at much greater distances. Fitting the nonthermal fraction of the leptonic jet as a function of position, we also find that most of the radio photons are emitted within 1000 Schwarzschild radii from the BH. Although hadronic jets do not reproduce all the VLBI observations consistently in our model, we also discuss that their heavy mass allows a stronger magnetic field within the observational constraints, leading to an inverted SED in sub-millimeter wavelengths by the thermal emission from the jet base. It is therefore implied that contemporaneous observations of the M87 jet with Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and VLBI could discriminate the jet composition and its collimation within the central 100 Schwarzschild radii.

 - **Abstract**
 The recent detection of GW230529 suggests that black hole-neutron star mergers may involve low-mass black holes, potentially producing detectable electromagnetic counterparts. Motivated by this, we perform eleven fully general-relativistic hydrodynamic simulations with and without neutrino treatment, targeting the inferred chirp mass of GW230529. We systematically vary the black hole spin from $a_{\mathrm{BH}} = 0.0$ to $0.8$ in steps of $0.1$, making this the most comprehensive study of spin effects in black hole-neutron star mergers to date. We confirm our earlier findings of fast-moving ejecta ($v \geq 0.6\,c$) in this parameter regime and demonstrate a clear spin dependence, with fast-ejecta masses reaching up to $\qty{\sim e-3}{\Mass\Sun}$ for $a_{\mathrm{BH}} = 0.8$. Most notably, we identify for the first time the presence of spiral wave-driven ejecta in black hole-neutron star mergers -- a phenomenon previously reported only in binary neutron star systems. The mass of this component grows significantly with spin, reaching levels up to $\qty{\sim 7e-3}{\Mass\Sun}$. These results establish a new spin-enhanced mechanism for powering blue kilonova emission in black hole-neutron star mergers, significantly extending the range of systems expected to produce observable electromagnetic counterparts.

 - **Abstract**
 The triggers of starburst episodes are a key component to our understanding of the baryon cycle in galaxies. Galaxy mergers are a commonly suggested catalyst for starbursts, but once the galaxies coalesce into a single kinematically disturbed system, their merger history can be difficult to assess. This is particularly true for dwarf galaxies, which are expected to dominate the merger rate at all redshifts due to their large numbers. One such dwarf galaxy undergoing an enigmatic starburst episode is Henize 2-10, which appears to be isolated. Possible scenarios that might have caused the starburst episode include a previous merger or stochastic processes within the galaxy itself, such as self-regulation via feedback processes. We present new VLA 21-cm observations and unpublished archival CARMA CO data to investigate the dynamical state and star formation activity in the galaxy. We do not detect an HI tail consistent with the structure reported by Kobulnicky et al. (1995), which was suggested as evidence for a merger or interaction, but rather these new observations indicate an extended HI distribution. We also find that the HI appears dynamically decoupled from an extended CO feature (inferred to be a tidal tail in previous work), suggesting large-scale dynamical processes of some type are affecting the gas in this system. We provide a meta-analysis of available results to enhance our understanding of what might be triggering the starburst episode in Henize 2-10, and speculate that the large CO feature could be falling into the galaxy and potentially trigger starburst activity.
