 - **Abstract**
 We present high-resolution Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array observations of the 22 GHz $\mathrm{H_2O}$ maser line in the extended Sagittarius B2 cloud. We detect 499 $\mathrm{H_2O}$ masers across the observed velocities between -39 and 172 km s$^{-1}$. To investigate the nature of the masers, we analyze their spatial distribution and cross-match with catalogs of HII regions and protostellar cores. 62% of masers are associated with protostellar cores and 32% with HII regions. The nature of the remaining 6% of sources was not established, but is likely associated with protostellar cores. Based on the spatial extent of the groups of masers, we classify them as either outflow-associated or young stellar object (YSO)-associated. We identify 144 unique sites of maser emission: 23 are associated with HII regions and 94 with protostellar cores, of which 33 are associated with protostellar outflows and 18 with YSOs. The outflow-associated $\mathrm{H_2O}$ maser emission is confined to within $<2000$ au of the central continuum source, despite shocked SiO emission extending over tens of thousands of au. The YSO-associated masers show a lack of detections at $5 < V_{rel} < 30$ km s$^{-1}$, which we suggest may be due to maser self-absorption. We show how $\mathrm{H_2O}$ masers trace the large-scale material flow in Sgr B2 N (North) also seen in SiO and mm continuum emission. Finally, we find that protostellar cores with associated $\mathrm{H_2O}$ masers tend to have brighter 3 mm continuum emission on average, although there is no strong correlation between maser brightness and continuum flux.

 - **Abstract**
 A small fraction of red dwarfs younger than 100 million years show structured, periodic optical light curves suggestive of transiting opaque material that corotates with the star. However, the composition, origin, and even the existence of this material are uncertain. The main alternative hypothesis is that these complex periodic variables (CPVs) are explained by complex distributions of bright or dark regions on the stellar surfaces. Here, we present time-series spectroscopy and photometry of a rapidly-rotating ($P$=3.9 hr) CPV, TIC 141146667. The spectra show sinusoidal time-varying H$\alpha$ emission at twice to four times the star's equatorial velocity, providing direct evidence for cool ($\lesssim$10$^4$ K) plasma clumps trapped in corotation around a CPV. These data support the idea that young, rapidly-rotating M dwarfs can sustain warped tori of cool plasma, similar to other rapidly-rotating magnetic stars. Outstanding questions include whether dust clumps in these plasma tori explain CPV light curves, and whether the tori originate from the star or are fed by external sources. Rough estimates suggest $\gtrsim$10% of M dwarfs host similar structures during their early lives.

 - **Abstract**
 This work focuses on the detection of X-ray Supernova Remnants (SNRs) in the galaxy NGC 7793 and the study of their properties. X-ray SNRs in galaxies beyond the Local Group are rare, mainly due to the limited sensitivity of current X-ray instruments. Additionally, their identification requires an optical counterpart, making incomplete optical identification methods an extra challenge. Detecting X-ray SNRs in other galaxies is crucial for understanding their feedback in different evolutionary phases and gaining insights into their local interstellar medium. In NGC 7793, only one X-ray SNR was previously known, while a recent study reported nearly 240 optical SNRs. The discovery of a new, larger optical SNR sample motivated a re-examination of the X-ray SNR population by comparing optical SNRs with X-ray sources. To identify X-ray SNRs, we utilised Chandra's spatial resolution and analysed all available archival data of NGC 7793, totaling 229.9 ks over 19 years. After data reduction, we performed source detection and analysis, searching for X-ray sources coinciding with optical SNRs. We also used XMM-Newton for spectral analysis of the confirmed and candidate SNRs. We detected 58 X-ray sources down to an observed luminosity of $\sim 1.5\times 10^{36}\, erg\, s^{-1}$. Among them, five X-ray counterparts to optical SNRs were identified, all presenting soft emission (<1.2 keV) with no short- or long-term variability. One corresponds to the previously known X-ray SNR, while four are newly detected. Spectral modeling of two SNRs shows thermal spectra exceeding 2.5 million K, with strong OVII, OVIII, and NeIX emission lines. A correlation between density, X-ray luminosity, and source softness was observed. We also report X-ray emission from supernova 2008bk, refining its position, and suggest two candidate X-ray SNRs with soft, non-variable spectra, one resembling the identified X-ray SNRs.

 - **Abstract**
 Current cosmological simulations rely on active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback to quench star formation and match observed stellar mass distributions, but models for AGN feedback are poorly constrained. The circumgalactic medium (CGM) provides a helpful laboratory to study this process, as its metallicity, temperature, and density distributions are directly impacted by AGN. Recent observations from the eROSITA instrument provide constraints on these distributions through measurements of extended soft X-ray emission. Here, we generate synthetic eROSITA observations from the EAGLE and SIMBA cosmological simulations, comparing them against observations of galaxies stacked by stellar mass, halo mass, and star-formation rate. SIMBA outperforms EAGLE in matching observed surface brightness profiles in general, but neither simulation consistently agrees with observations across the full range of galaxy properties we studied. We find that variations in CGM X-ray emission between simulations are driven by density differences at $R \lesssim 0.2 R_{200c} $, and temperature and metallicity changes at larger radii. We directly model predicted contributions from X-ray binaries (XRBs), finding that the hot plasma contributes $\approx$ 20 times more to the CGM X-ray luminosity than XRBs, except at $M_*<10^{11} M_\odot$, where the contamination from XRBs becomes more significant.

 - **Abstract**
 CO(1-0) and CO(2-1) are commonly used as bulk molecular gas tracers. The CO line ratios (especially CO(2-1)/CO(1-0) - $R_{21}$) vary within and among galaxies, yet previous studies on $R_{21}$ and alike often rely on measurements constructed by combining data from facilities with substantial relative calibration uncertainties that have the same order as physical line ratio variations. Hence robustly determining systematic $R_{21}$ variations is challenging. Here, we compare CO(1-0) and CO(2-1) mapping data from ALMA for 14 nearby galaxies, at a common physical resolution of 1.7 kpc. Our dataset includes new ALMA (7m+TP) CO(1-0) maps of 12 galaxies. We investigate $R_{21}$ variation to understand its dependence on global galaxy properties, kpc-scale environmental factors, and its correlation with star formation rate (SFR) surface density and metallicity. We find that the galaxy-to-galaxy scatter is 0.05 dex. This is lower than previous studies which reported over 0.1 dex variation, likely reflecting significant flux calibration uncertainties in single-dish surveys. Within individual galaxies, $R_{21}$ has a typical mean value of ~0.64 and 0.1 dex variation, with an increase to ~0.75 towards galactic centers. We find strong correlations between $R_{21}$ and various galactic parameters, particularly SFR surface density, which shows a power-law slope of 0.10-0.11 depending on the adopted binning/fitting methods. Our findings suggest that, for studies covering main sequence galaxy samples, assuming a fixed $R_{21}$=0.64 does not significantly bias kpc-scale molecular gas mass estimates from CO(2-1). Instead, systematic uncertainties from flux calibration and the CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor account for more systematic scatter of CO-derived molecular gas properties.

 - **Abstract**
 Finding the injection threshold for diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) of electrons in collisionless shocks has been a longstanding unsolved problem. Using first-principles kinetic simulations, we identify the conditions for electron injection into DSA and quantify the evolution of the nonthermal tail in self-generated electromagnetic turbulence. By analyzing electron trajectories and their momentum gain during shock-recrossing cycles, we demonstrate that electrons start participating in DSA when their speed is large enough to overrun the shock. We develop a minimal model showing that speed-dependent injection reproduces nonthermal electron spectra observed in kinetic simulations. Our findings establish a new criterion for electron DSA, which has broad implications for the nonthermal emission of shock-powered space/astrophysical systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Do all Fast Radio Burst (FRB) sources repeat? We present evidence that FRB sources follow a Zipf-like distribution, in which the number density of sources is approximately inversely proportional to their burst rate above a fixed energy threshold-even though both the burst rate and number density span many orders of magnitude individually. We introduce a model-independent framework that predicts the distribution of observed fluences and distances, and repetition rates of an FRB population based on an assumed burst rate distribution per source. Using parameters derived directly from observations, this framework simultaneously explains several key features of the FRB population: (i) The observed ratio of repeaters to apparent non-repeaters; (ii) The much lower ratio of apparent non-repeaters to the total number of Soft Gamma Repeater (SGR) sources within the observable Universe; And (iii) the slightly smaller average distances of known repeaters compared to non-repeaters. We further explore how survey parameters, such as radio sensitivity and observation time, influence these statistics. Notably, we find that the fraction of repeaters rises only mildly with improved sensitivity or longer exposure. This weak dependence could be misinterpreted as evidence that not all FRBs repeat. Overall, our results support the idea that a single population-likely magnetars-can account for the full observed diversity of FRB activity, from very inactive FRB sources like SGR 1935+2154 to the most active repeaters.

 - **Abstract**
 Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are typically identified through their distinctive X-ray or radio emissions, mid-infrared (MIR) colors, or emission lines. However, each method captures different subsets of AGN due to signal-to-noise (SNR) limitations, redshift coverage, and extinction effects, underscoring the necessity for a multi-wavelength approach for comprehensive AGN samples. This study explores the effectiveness of spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting as a robust method for AGN identification. Using {\tt CIGALE} optical-MIR SED fits on DESI Early Data Release galaxies, we compare SED-based AGN selection ({\tt AGNFRAC} $\geq0.1$) with traditional methods including BPT diagrams, WISE colors, X-ray, and radio diagnostics. SED fitting identifies $\sim 70\%$ of narrow/broad-line AGN and 87\% of WISE-selected AGN. Incorporating high SNR WISE photometry reduces star-forming galaxy contamination from 62\% to 15\%. Initially, $\sim50\%$ of SED-AGN candidates are undetected by standard methods, but additional diagnostics classify $\sim85\%$ of these sources, revealing LINERs and retired galaxies potentially representing evolved systems with weak AGN activity. Further spectroscopic and multi-wavelength analysis will be essential to determine the true AGN nature of these sources. SED fitting provides complementary AGN identification, unifying multi-wavelength AGN selections. This approach enables more complete -- albeit with some contamination -- AGN samples essential for upcoming large-scale surveys where spectroscopic diagnostics may be limited.

 - **Abstract**
 The massive Local Group galaxies both host substantially fewer satellites than the subhalos expected from the cold dark matter paradigm, and the recent investigations have highlighted the interplay between baryons and dark matter. We investigate the processes that make subhalos starless, using high-resolution cosmological simulations. We found that the number of satellites around Milky Way analogs closely aligns with observations, which accords with recent studies. In our simulations, the majority of subhalos are devoid of stars, i.e., "starless." We first examined supernova feedback and the environmental effects associated with subhalos' orbital motion as candidates of origin. However, neither seems to be the main driver. Supernova feedback causes a reduction of cold gas in "starred" subhalos, but its impact is not significant. In the case of starless subhalos, supernova feedback is irrelevant because most of them do not have in-situ star formation in the first place. The orbital motion in dense environments causes gas removal in all subhalos but is not enough to remove pre-existing stars. The key is found to be the effect of reionization instead. Starless subhalos are initially born in regions that are less efficient in accreting matter. This makes them lack sufficiently dense gas to self-shield from UV background heating, preventing their gas from cooling below the star formation threshold. This indicates that starless subhalos are not made but born.

 - **Abstract**
 Binary neutron star (BNS) mergers can result in the formation of long-lived magnetar remnants which can enhance neutrino and electromagnetic (EM) emissions. In this work, we study the resulting multi-wavelength EM emissions and the prospects of their detectability in the current and upcoming EM telescopes. We model the pulsar-wind neubla system where the long-lived pulsar with dipolar magnetic fields of $10^{13} - 10^{15}$ G (magnetar) spins down and is surrounded by an outward expanding nebula and kilonova ejecta. Although at early times post the merger, the EM signatures are unobservable due to heavy attenuation, they become observable on timescales of $\mathcal{O}(1 - 10)$ days after the merger. We find that the survey and follow-up observations have horizon distances $\gtrsim 1\ \rm Gpc$ for most of the wavebands and conclude that the detection prospects for such long-lived remnants in the electromagnetic channel are promising. This is of crucial importance for multi-messenger observations from BNS mergers to constrain the physical parameters of the remnants. Furthermore, we highlight how observations across the electromagnetic band can uniquely identify magnetar-powered transients resulting from BNS mergers and establish concrete associations of the detected gravitational wave signatures with such transients.

 - **Abstract**
 Hybrid Foreground Residual Subtraction (HyFoReS) is a new family of algorithms designed to remove systematics-induced foreground contamination for 21-cm intensity mapping data. Previously, the algorithm was shown to be effective in mitigating beam perturbations in sky maps from the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME). In this study, we apply HyFoReS to CHIME simulations and test the algorithm's ability to mitigate antenna gain-type systematics in polarized visibilities. Simulating a two-cylinder telescope similar to the CHIME pathfinder, we find that HyFoReS reduces foreground bias caused by bandpass perturbations to a level below the thermal noise, provided that the RMS value of the perturbations is on the order of $10^{-4}$ or lower. When tested with complex antenna-dependent gain errors, HyFoReS can reduce residual foreground bias in the power spectrum by up to three orders of magnitude. While noise bias and second-order perturbations are currently the limiting factors for the algorithm, we have demonstrated that HyFoReS can suppress gain-induced foreground leakage in polarized data from 21-cm telescopes, aiding in the detection of the 21-cm auto-power spectrum for hydrogen intensity mapping experiments.

 - **Abstract**
 Jupiter-family comets (JFCs) have orbital periods of less than 20 years and therefore undergo more frequent sublimation compared to other comet populations. The JFCs therefore represent the ideal dynamical population for investigating the dust production rates at high-cadence. We analyzed observations by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) of 74 JFCs that reached perihelion in 2022 and 2023. The work contained in this study builds upon our previous work (Gillan et al. 2024), for a total of 116 JFCs over a four-year period. Using the Afrho parameter, we measured the dust production rates of each JFC as a function of heliocentric distance. We found that there remained a clear preference for JFCs to reach their maximum A(0)frho post-perihelion, with 170P/Christensen, 254P/McNaught and P/2020 WJ5 (Lemmon) reaching a maximum A(0)frho between 200-400 days after perihelion. However, all JFCs reached their maximum dust production within 10% of their orbital period relative to perihelion. Fitting A(0)fp as a function of Rh^n, we measured statistically significant differences in the distribution of pre-perihelion and post-perihelion activity index n, with average activity indices of -5.2 +/- 4.5 and -3.2 +/- 2.7 respectively. We derived upper limits for the nuclear radii of comets 444P/WISE-PANSTARRS and 459P/Catalina as Rn \leq 1.5 +/- 0.2 km and Rn \leq 1.7 +/- 0.1 km respectively. We measured six outbursts in comets 97P/Metcalf-Brewington, 99P/Kowal 1, 118P/Shoemaker-Levy 4, 285P/LINEAR and 382P/Larson. From our four years of observing JFC outbursts in the ATLAS data, the average increase in magnitude was - 1.3 +/- 0.8.
#### Down But Not Out: The Case of Long-Period Comet C/2021 O3 (Panstarrs)

 - **Abstract**
 We combine ground- and space-based observations of long-period comet C/2021 O3 (Panstarrs) (perihelion distance 0.287 au) in order to investigate its reported near-perihelion destruction. Pre-perihelion photometric observations show a remarkably small heliocentric dependence of the scattered light, $\propto r_H^{-s}$ with $s = 2.59\pm0.21$, distinct from values reported in other long-period comets, for which $s$ = 4 is the canonical standard. The index is smaller than expected of coma production by equilibrium sublimation of either supervolatiles (for which $s \sim$ 4 is expected), or water ice ($s \sim$ 6 to 8) across the $\sim$4 au to 2 au range. The absolute magnitude deduced from the pre-perihelion data is $H$ = 13.0$\pm$0.3 (coma scattering cross-section $\sim$225 km$^2$ for an assumed geometric albedo 0.04) while, after perihelion, the cross-section fades by a factor of 25 to $H$ = 16.5 ($\sim$9 km$^2$). STEREO spacecraft observations near perihelion show a long debris trail whose properties are consistent with forward scattering from radius $\sim$7 $\mu$m particles. The data show that the nucleus of C/2021 O3 was not destroyed at perihelion. Although the lightcurve from 3.9 au inbound to 0.8 au outbound cannot be uniquely interpreted, a simple and plausible explanation is provided by seasonal dimming on a nucleus having high obliquity and an asymmetric distribution of near-surface volatiles. The survival of the nucleus against rotational disruption suggests a pre-perihelion nucleus radius $r_n \gtrsim$ 1.0 km while the photometric limit to the radius of the nucleus after perihelion is $r_n < 1.7$ km (geometric albedo 0.04 assumed).

 - **Abstract**
 We present our study of the XRISM observation of the Seyfert-1 galaxy NGC 3783. For the first time, XRISM's Resolve microcalorimeter enables a detailed characterization of the highly ionized outflows in this active galactic nucleus. Our analysis constrains their outflow and turbulent velocities, along with their ionization parameter $\xi$ and column density $N_{\rm H}$. The high-resolution Resolve spectrum reveals a distinct series of Fe absorption lines between 6.4 and 7.8 keV, ranging from Fe XVIII to Fe XXVI. At lower energies, absorption features from Si, S, and Ar are also detected. Our spectroscopy and photoionization modeling of the time-averaged Resolve spectrum uncover six outflow components, five of which exhibit relatively narrow absorption lines, with outflow velocities ranging from 560 to 1170 km/s. In addition, a broad absorption feature is detected, which is consistent with Fe XXVI outflowing at 14,300 km/s (0.05 $c$). This component carries a kinetic luminosity of 0.8-3% of the bolometric luminosity. Our analysis of the Resolve spectrum shows that more highly ionized absorption lines are intrinsically broader than those of lower ionization species, indicating that the turbulent velocity of the six outflow components (ranging from 0 to 3500 km/s) increases with $\xi$. Furthermore, we find that the $N_{\rm H}$ of the outflows generally declines with $\xi$ up to $\log \xi = 3.2$, but rises beyond this point, suggesting a complex ionization structure. Examination of the absorption profile of the Fe XXV resonance line reveals intriguing similarities to UV absorption lines (Ly$\alpha$ and C IV) observed by the HST, from which we infer that the outflows are clumpy in nature. Our XRISM/Resolve results support a 'hybrid wind' scenario, in which the outflows have multiple origins and driving mechanisms. We explore various interpretations of our findings within AGN wind models.

 - **Abstract**
 Millisecond magnetars, one of the potential candidates for the central engine of Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), can experience significant magnetic field enhancement shortly after their formation. In some cases, this evolution is further influenced by the accretion of stellar debris, which modifies the dipole magnetic field strength. During a hypercritical accretion phase that lasts seconds or longer after the progenitor explosion, a thin crust may form, submerging the magnetic field (the so-called magnetic burial scenario). Once hypercritical accretion ceases, the buried field can diffuse back through the crust, delaying the external dipole's reactivation. On the other hand, observations have shown that relativistic outflows ejected by these objects and decelerated by the circumburst environment cause a late and temporary emission known as afterglow. This work investigates how the submergence and subsequent reemergence of the magnetar magnetic field, on a few years timescales, affect the GRB afterglow dynamics. Specifically, we apply this phenomenological scenario to the late-time X-ray excess observed approximately three years post-burst in GW170817/GRB 170817A, exploring how the evolving magnetic field strength may contribute to this emission. Our modelling of GRB 170817A indicates that $\gtrsim90$ percent of the external dipole flux was initially buried, re-emerging on a timescale $\tau_{B}=3-40$ yr and restoring a surface field $B\simeq(2-5)\times10^{15}\,$G; the late-time X-ray brightening is far better reproduced by this scenario than by models without burial.

 - **Abstract**
 The Sun is an important calibrator for the theory of stellar structure and evolution. However, the accuracy of our solar evolution models is tightly linked to the physical ingredients that enter their computations. This include, amongst other, the equation of state, the opacities, the transport of chemicals and the modelling of turbulent convection. Deriving model-independent probes of these ingredients is therefore crucial to further test the quality of these ingredients and potentially reveal their shortcomings using observational data. We aim at providing additional constraints on the thermodynamical properties of the solar plasma at the base of the solar convective zone using a revised helioseismic indicator mimicking the properties of the specific entropy in the envelope. We derive a revised entropy proxy for the solar convective envelope, directly accessible using helioseismic structure inversions. We then use solar evolutionary models with various modifications of input physics to study the properties of proxy of the entropy in the convective envelope. We find that the entropy proxy for the solar convective envelope allows to invalidate adiabatic overshooting as a solution to the solar modelling problem and strongly points towards the need for revised opacities. Our results show that this new indicator is a strong diagnostic of the overall evolution of the thermodynamical conditions at the base of the convective zone. The new entropy proxy indicator allows for a more accurate characterisation of the conditions at the base of the solar convective zone. While it already allows to rule out overshooting as a solution to the solar modelling problem, its sensitivity to the shape of the opacity modification and the evolution of the properties at the base of the convective zone makes it a powerful helioseismic diagnostic for solar models.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The bright heads of penumbral filaments, penumbral grains (PGs), are manifestations of hot plasma flows rising to the surface. They are observed to move horizontally toward the sunspot umbra or away from it. Recent analyses of observations indicate that the direction of this motion is related to the inclination of the surrounding magnetic field. Aims. The penumbra of a sunspot simulated by the radiative magnetohydrodynamic code MURaM is analysed to get typical physical conditions in PGs, compare them to those in the surroundings, describe their spatial distribution, and study their evolution. Methods. We use time series of images that map intensity, temperature, magnetic field vector, and velocity vector in horizontal slices at the visible surface, in subsurface layers, and in vertical cuts through the simulation box to track PGs and compare, statistically and in individual cases, the physical quantities inside them with those in the surroundings. Results. The statistical analysis of simulation results provides average values of temperature, magnetic field strength and inclination, vertical velocity, and their changes with radial distance from the spot centre. We find a subtle difference between simulated PGs with opposite directions of motions when comparing the magnetic field inclinations inside and outside the PGs. The case studies, documented by movies, show that the differences of inclinations and the direction of motions may change during the lifetime of some PGs and that the turbulence in the surface layers introduces some randomness in the apparent motions of PGs.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a realistic simulation of an SKA-Low cosmic dawn/epoch of reionisation (CD/EoR) observation, which can be used to further the development of foreground-mitigation approaches. The simulation corresponds to a deep (1000 h) integration pointing over the 106 MHz-196 MHz frequency range. The sky components include the CD/EoR signal, extragalactic foreground emission featuring strong (over 5 Jy at 150 MHz) out-of-field sources and in-field sources down to 1 microJy at 150 MHz, and Galactic emission from the GSM2016 model complemented with small-scales structure beyond its native $\sim 1$ deg resolution from a magneto-hydrodynamic simulation of the interstellar medium. Modeled errors include a partial de-mixing of the out-of-field sources, direction-dependent calibration errors leading to residual ionospheric effects, and direction-independent gain calibration errors, on top of thermal noise. Simulated observations are delivered as visibilities as well as imaging products with natural weighting. The true, uncorrupted, CD/EoR signal is also delivered, to allow an assessment of the efficacy of foreground-mitigation approaches. The codes used to generate these simulations are also delivered, so that new simulated datasets can be produced. This simulation has been the basis for the SKA Science Data Challenge 3a (SDC3a), which addressed foreground removal.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a theoretical framework for the formation of X-ray linear polarization in black hole (BH) source. The X-ray linear polarization originates from up-scatterings of initially soft photons within a hot, optically thick Compton cloud (CC) characterized by a flat geometry. The IXPE observations of several BHs X-ray binaries and of one Seyfert-1 galaxy confirm our theoretical prediction regarding values of the linear polarization P. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate that the main physical parameters of these Galactic and extragalactic sources can be derived without any free parameter using the polarization and X-ray spectral measurements. We estimate the CC optical depth, {\tau}0 for all BHs observed by IXPE, using the plot of P vs {\mu} = cos i, where i is an observer inclination with respect to the normal, and considering the values P for a given source. Using X ray spectral analysis, we obtain the photon index {\Gamma} and, analytically determined the CC plasma temperature kBTe. Different BHs (Cyg X 1, 4U 1630 47, LMC X 1, 4U 1957+115, Swift J1727.8 1613, GX 339 4) and the Seyfert 1 NGC 4151 exhibited polarization between 1 and 8 percent level nearly independently of energy. kBTe is in the range between 5 and 90 keV with a smaller value in High/Soft State with respect to Low/Hard State. We find a similarity between the physical parameter and the IXPE findings and we provide evidence suggesting that the CC exhibits a flat geometry.

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most powerful electromagnetic outbursts in the Universe and emit a vast amount of their energy in the form of gamma rays. Their duration is extremely short on cosmic timescales, but they show a wealth of time variability in their light curves. Properties of this variability may carry information about the processes the gamma rays emerge from, which are still poorly understood. This research investigates the redshift-corrected gamma-ray light curves of 159 long GRBs, observed with the Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor on the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope between 2008 and 2023. We calculate the average power-density spectrum (PDS) of different groups of GRBs that are distinguished based on fluence, peak rate, duration, redshift, and the different GRB phases. Almost all redshift-corrected spectra reveal a power-law behavior with high-frequency power-law indices distributed around $\sim -1.9$. The precursor phase and redshift-corrected short bursts exhibit a shallower power law with index $\sim -1.3$, potentially due to the limited statistics that these samples represent. Only in some cases, the high-frequency index is still consistent with the $-5/3$ (Kolmogorov) slope, found by earlier studies and linked to the appearance of fully developed turbulence.

 - **Abstract**
 Previous ambient solar wind (SW) validation studies have reported on discrepancies between modeled and observed SW conditions at L1. They indicated that a major source of discrepancies stems from how we model the solar corona. Thus, enhancing predictive capabilities demands a thorough examination of coronal modeling. The Wang-Sheeley-Arge (WSA) model has been a workhorse model that provides the near-Sun SW conditions. An important component of it is the Potential Field Source Surface (PFSS) model. This study analyzes 15 different Carrington Rotations(CRs), and presents detailed analysis of CR 2052 to identify WSA model settings that lead to successful and erroneous SW predictions at Earth. For the events studied, we show that increasing the models grid resolution improves the open-close boundary identification. This results in better predicting the onset and duration of high-speed streams (HSSs). In addition, we find an optimized source surface height (R$_{ss}$) (lying between 1.8-3.1 R$_{\odot}$) further enhances HSS prediction accuracy for the studied events. A detailed analysis shows that changes in R$_{ss}$, (a) changes the Great Circle Angular Distance (GCAD) maps (at the solar surface) of the associated coronal holes and (b) changes the foot-point locations of the magnetic connectivities to the sub-Earth locations. These factors change the near-Sun SW speed, that eventually leads to uncertainties in speeds near Earth. We also investigate the usefulness of coronal hole observations in constraining R$_{ss}$ and SW solutions at Earth, and highlight their underutilized value in guiding the selection of magnetic maps for improved ambient solar wind modeling at L1.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar accretion plays an important role in the early stages of stellar evolution, particularly in Classical T Tauri Stars (CTTSs). Accretion of a CTTS can be related to different physical parameters such as effective temperature (T$_{\text{eff}}$), age, abundance of hydrogen, etc. We can infer how accretion works by examining it across different wavelength regions. Accretion can be traced using veiling, a parameter that measures how excess emission from accretion affects the photospheric spectrum of CTTS. In this study, we selected a sample of CTTSs, Weak-line T Tauri Stars (WTTSs), and field stars, observed as a part of the SDSS-V Milky Way Mapper using the BOSS spectrograph. We measured veiling for CTTSs through comparing them to theoretical spectra. Next, we assessed the effect of veiling on different stellar properties, including wavelength, H$\alpha$ emission, effective temperature, and age. We investigated how veiling changes with these parameters and what the physical reasons behind the changes can be. Finally, we evaluated how our findings align with existing accretion shock models. This study highlights veiling as a critical diagnostic tool for understanding accretion in young stars.
#### Axisymmetric Cooling of Neutron Stars with Strong Magnetic Fields

 - **Abstract**
 We study the cooling evolution of neutron stars with strong poloidal magnetic fields (with strength not far from observed values) using the full general relativity 2-dimensional \textit{Astreus} code, which solves consistently Einstein's and Maxwell's equations. We find that central magnetic fields with strengths $3-4\times10^{17}$ G, corresponding to surface magnetic fields $7-8\times10^{16}$, can significantly modify the cooling behavior of neutron stars, leading to stars with similar masses but different magnetic fields to exhibit different thermal evolution. We show a non-linear increase in the thermal relaxation time with increasing magnetic fields and that this behavior is associated with the reduction of the Direct Urca process in stars with strong magnetic fields. This is a novel result in which we can observe the magnetic field influence on the thermal evolution of stars, even if it is not strong enough to affect the Fermi distribution of particles.
#### A Theoretical Three-Dimensional Diagram to Separate Star Formation, Active Galactic Nuclei, and Shocks in Galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 The excitation sources in galaxies are frequently mixed due to AGN and stellar feedback, including star formation, active galactic nuclei (AGNs), and shock excitation. Disentangling the star formation, AGN, and shocks in galaxy integral-field spectra (IFU) at optical wavelengths is crucial to expanding the galaxy sample for AGN and stellar feedback studies, given the lack of multiwavelength observations for most of the galaxies that are observed in optical wavelengths. Previous methods to address this issue either have a limited application range or are highly uncertain in separating AGN from shock excitation (D'Agostino et al. 2019; Johnston et al. 2023). Here, we propose a theoretical three-dimensional (3D) diagram. This theoretical 3D diagram overcomes the limitations of previous methods and can simultaneously separate star formation, AGNs, and shocks in active galaxies. Along with the separation, the new theoretical 3D diagram also constrains the gas metallicity, ionization parameter, and gas pressure within the galaxy. By applying the Very Large Telescope (VLT)/MUSE IFU data and the Wide Field Spectrograph IFU data for NGC5728 on the theoretical 3D diagram, we find a star-forming ring surrounding the galaxy center with a projected radius of $\sim$1 kpc in the sky plane, an AGN ionized-bicone extended up to $\sim$2 kpc from the nuclear center, and a fast shock dominated disk region at the base of the AGN outflow, which is likely associated with a nuclear accretion disk or a result of jet-ISM interaction. The theoretical 3D diagram opens a new window to study the interplay among star formation, AGN, and shocks in active galaxies.
