 - **Abstract**
 A primary goal of exoplanet science is to measure the atmospheric composition of gas giants in order to infer their formation and migration histories. Common diagnostics for planet formation are the atmospheric metallicity ([M/H]) and the carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio as measured through transit or emission spectroscopy. The C/O ratio in particular can be used to approximately place a planet's initial formation radius from the stellar host, but a given C/O ratio may not be unique to formation location. This degeneracy can be broken by combining measurements of both the C/O ratio and the atmospheric refractory-to-volatile ratio. We report the measurement of both quantities for the atmosphere of the canonical ultra hot Jupiter WASP-121 b using the high resolution (R=45,000) IGRINS instrument on Gemini South. Probing the planet's direct thermal emission in both pre- and post-secondary eclipse orbital phases, we infer that WASP-121 b has a significantly super-stellar C/O ratio of 0.70$^{+0.07}_{-0.10}$ and a moderately super-stellar refractory-to-volatile ratio at 3.83$^{+3.62}_{-1.67} \times$ stellar. This combination is most consistent with formation between the soot line and H$_2$O snow line, but we cannot rule out formation between the H$_2$O and CO snow lines or beyond the CO snow line. We also measure velocity offsets between H$_2$O, CO, and OH, potentially an effect of chemical inhomogeneity on the planet day side. This study highlights the ability to measure both C/O and refractory-to-volatile ratios via high resolution spectroscopy in the near-infrared H and K bands.

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of nonthermal broadening in solar spectra is one of the long-standing questions in solar physics. Various processes have been invoked - including unresolved flows, waves, and turbulent processes - but definitive answers are lacking. To investigate the physical processes responsible for nonthermal broadening, we examine its relation with the angle between the magnetic field and the line of sight in three different closed-field regions above plage regions at different locations on the solar disk. We obtained the nonthermal width of transition-region Si IV 1403 Å spectra observed in active regions by the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph, after subtraction of the thermal and instrumental line broadening. To investigate the dependence of the measured broadening on the viewing angle between the line of sight and magnetic field direction, we determined the magnetic field direction at transition-region heights using nonlinear force-free extrapolations based on the observed photospheric vector magnetic field taken by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory. We found that the nonthermal broadening shows a correlation with downward motion (redshifts)and alignment between the magnetic field and the observer's line-of-sight direction. Based on the observed correlations, we suggest that velocity gradients within plasma flowing down along the magnetic field may lead to a significant portion of the observed nonthermal broadening of transition-region spectral lines in closed fields above plage regions.
#### Blue Monsters at $z>10$. Where has all their dust gone?

 - **Abstract**
 The properties of luminous, blue (a.k.a. Blue Monsters), super-early galaxies at redshift $z>10$ have been successfully explained by the attenuation-free model (AFM) in which dust is pushed to kpc-scales by radiation-driven outflows. As an alternative to AFM, here we assess whether *attenuation-free* conditions can be replaced by a *dust-free* scenario in which dust is produced in very limited amounts and/or later destroyed in the interstellar medium. To this aim we compare the predicted values of the dust-to-stellar mass ratio, $\xi_d$, with those measured in 15 galaxies at $z>10$ from JWST spectra, when outflows are not included. Our model constrains $\xi_d$ as a function of several parameters by allowing wide variations in the IMF, dust/metal production, and dust destruction for a set of SN progenitor models and explosion energies. We find $\log \xi_d \approx -2.2$ for all systems, indicative of the dominant role of SN dust production over destruction in these early galaxies. Such value is strikingly different from the data, which instead indicate $\log \xi_d < -4$. We conclude that dust destruction alone can hardly explain the transparency of Blue Monsters. Other mechanisms, such as outflows, might be required.

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a model that can describe the entire range of FRBs, from non-repeating to highly prolific repeaters. Coherent radio waves in these bursts are produced in the polar cap region of a magnetar, where magnetic field lines are open. The angle between the rotation and magnetic axes, relative to the angular size of the polar cap region, partially determines the repetition rate and polarization properties of FRBs. We discuss how many of the properties of repeating FRBs - such as their lack of periodicity, energetics, small PA swing, spectro-temporal correlation and inferred low source density are explained by this model. The systematic PA swing and the periodic modulation of long duration bursts from non-repeaters are also natural outcomes. We derive a lower limit of about 400 on the Lorentz factor of FRB sources using this model for bursts with a linear polarization degree greater than 95%.
#### Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays from Neutrino-Emitting Tidal Disruption Events

 - **Abstract**
 We revisit the Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Ray (UHECRs) production in Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) in the light of recent neutrino-TDE associations. We use an isotropically emitting source-propagation model, which has been developed to describe the neutrino production in AT2019dsg, AT2019fdr, and AT2019aalc. These TDEs have strong dust echoes in the infrared range, which are potentially linked with the neutrino production. A mechanism where neutrinos originate from cosmic ray scattering on infrared photons implies cosmic rays in the ultra-high energy range, thus suggesting a natural connection with the observed UHECR. We extrapolate the three TDE associations to a population of neutrino- and UHECR-emitting TDEs, and postulate that these TDEs power the UHECRs. We then infer the source composition, population parameters, and local rates that are needed to describe UHECR data. We find that UHECR data point towards a mix of light to mid-heavy injection isotopes, which could be found, e.g., in oxygen-neon-magnesium white dwarfs, and to a contribution of at least two groups of TDEs with different characteristics, dominated by AT2019aalc-type events. The required local TDE rates of ${\mathcal O}(10^2)~\mathrm{Gpc^{-3} \, yr^{-1}}$, however, are more indicative of the disruption of main sequence stars. We propose an enhanced efficiency in the acceleration of heavier nuclei that could address this discrepancy. The predicted diffuse neutrino fluxes suggest a population of astrophysical neutrino sources that can be observed by future radio neutrino detection experiments.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first collisionless realization of black hole accretion consistent with a persistent magnetically arrested disk state. The accretion flow, consisting of an ion-electron disk plasma combined with magnetospheric pair creation effects, is simulated using first-principles general-relativistic particle-in-cell methods. The axisymmetric simulation is evolved over significant dynamical timescales during which a quasi-steady accretion state is reached with several magnetic flux eruption cycles. We include a realistic treatment of inverse Compton scattering and pair production, which allows for studying the interaction between the collisionless accretion flow and the pair-loaded jet. Our findings indicate that magnetic flux eruptions associated with equatorial magnetic reconnection within the black hole magnetosphere and the formation of spark gaps are locations of maximal particle acceleration. Flux eruptions, starting near the central black hole, can trigger Kelvin-Helmholtz-like vortices at the jet-disk interface that facilitate efficient mixing between disk and jet plasma. Transient periods of increased pair production following the magnetic flux eruptions and reconnection events are responsible for most of the highly accelerated particles.

 - **Abstract**
 Low-metallicity environments are subject to inefficient cooling. They also have low dust-to-gas ratios and therefore less efficient photoelectric (PE) heating than in solar-neighbourhood conditions, where PE heating is one of the most important heating processes in the warm neutral interstellar medium (ISM). We perform magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of stratified ISM patches with a gas metallicity of 0.02 Z$_\odot$ as part of the SILCC project. The simulations include non-equilibrium chemistry, heating, and cooling of the low-temperature ISM as well as anisotropic cosmic ray (CR) transport, and stellar tracks. We include stellar feedback in the form of far-UV and ionising (FUV and EUV) radiation, massive star winds, supernovae, and CR injection. From the local CR energy density, we compute a CR heating rate that is variable in space and time. In this way, we can compare the relative impact of PE and CR heating on the metal-poor ISM and find that CR heating can dominate over PE heating. Models with a uniform CR ionisation rate suppress or severely delay star formation, since they provide a larger amount of energy to the ISM due to CR heating. Models with a variable CR ionisation rate form stars predominantly in pristine regions with low PE heating and CR ionisation rates where the metal-poor gas is able to cool efficiently. Because of the low metallicity, the amount of formed stars in all runs is not enough to trigger outflows of gas from the mid-plane.
#### OGLE-BLAP-001 and ZGP-BLAP-08: two possible magnetic blue large-amplitude pulsators

 - **Abstract**
 Blue large-amplitude pulsators (BLAPs) are a newly discovered group of compact pulsating stars whose origin needs to be explained. Of the existing evolutionary scenarios that could lead to the formation of BLAPs, there are two in which BLAPs are the products of the merger of two stars, either a main sequence star and a helium white dwarf or two low-mass helium white dwarfs. Among over a hundred known BLAPs, three equidistant in frequency modes had been found in one, OGLE-BLAP-001. We show that similar three equidistant in frequency modes exist in yet another BLAP, ZGP-BLAP-08. This perfect separation in frequency is a strong argument to explain the modes in terms of an oblique pulsator model. This model is supported by the character of the changes of the pulsation amplitude and phase with the rotational phase. Consequently, we hypothesize that these two BLAPs are magnetic, as equidistant in frequency pulsation modes should be observed in the presence of a magnetic field whose axis of symmetry does not coincide with the rotation axis. A logical consequence of this hypothesis is to postulate that these two BLAPs could have originated in a merger scenario, just how the origin of magnetic white dwarfs is explained. We also find that period changes in both stars cannot be interpreted by a constant rate of period change and discuss the possible origin of these changes.
#### Limiting Rotation Rate of Neutron Stars from Crust Breaking and Gravitational Waves

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.19111

 - **Abstract**
 Neutron stars are not observed to spin faster than about half their breakup rate. This limiting rotational frequency may be related to the strength of their crusts. As a star spins up from accretion, centrifugal forces stress the crust. We perform finite-element simulations of rotating neutron stars and find that the crust fails at rotation rates about half the breakup rate. We argue that this crust failure is asymmetric and produces a significant ellipticity (fractional difference in moments of inertia). A rotating star, with this ellipticity, radiates gravitational waves that limit further spin up. These stars may be promising sources for LIGO / VIRGO and next generation gravitational wave detectors.
#### Chemical enrichment by collapsars as the origin of the unusually high [Ba/Fe] in a massive star cluster of the dwarf galaxy NGC 1569

 - **Abstract**
 The super star cluster NGC1569-B has recently been observed to have an extremely high [Ba/Fe]. We consider that the observed high [Ba/Fe] ($\sim$ 1.3) is due to the chemical enrichment of giant molecular clouds by either collapsars, neutron star mergers, or magneto-rotational supernovae, and thereby investigate which of the three polluters can best reproduce the observed [Ba/Fe]. Since it is found that collapsars can best reproduce such an extremely high Ba abundance, we numerically investigate the star cluster formation in NGC1569 using chemodynamical simulations of merging dwarf galaxies with chemical enrichment by collapsars. The principal results are as follows. First, a cluster of the same scale as NGC1569-B was found to match both the observed [Ba/Fe] and [Fe/H] values, the best cluster having [Ba/Fe]= 1.3 $\pm$ 0.2 and [Fe/H] = $-$0.7 $\pm$ 0.2. This simulation used a core-collapse supernova per collapsar rate of 70, a standard initial mass function and an initial metallicity of [Fe/H]=-1.5. Second, a prediction of the Eu abundance of NGC1569-B is made: [Eu/Fe]= 1.9 $\pm$ 0.2. These results are shown to be invariant under a change in the orbit parameters used for the merger. The need for a merger to promote the star formation that leads to the synthesis of the Ba and the star cluster formation is confirmed. Collapsars can not only better explain [Ba/Fe] but also be consistent with the observed star formation rate and stellar mass of the dwarf galaxy.
#### NeutralUniverseMachine: Predictions of HI gas in Different Theoretical Models

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the distribution and evolution of HI gas in different theoretical models, including hydro-dynamical simulations (Illustris-TNG and SIMBA), semi-analytic models (GAEA), and the empirical models ( NeutralUniverseMachine; NUM). By comparing model predictions for the HI mass function (HIMF), HI-halo and HI-stellar mass relations, conditional HI mass function (CHIMF) and the halo occupation distribution (HOD) of HI-selected galaxies, we find that all models show reasonable agreement with the observed HIMF at $z\sim0$, but the differences become much larger at higher redshifts of $z=1$ and $z=2$. The HIMF of NUM shows remarkable agreement with the observation at $z=1$, whereas other models predict much lower amplitudes of HIMF at the high-mass end. Comparisons of CHIMF distributions indicate that the HIMF is dominated by halos of $10< \log(M_{\rm vir}/M_\odot) <11$ and $11< \log(M_{\rm vir}/M_\odot)<12$ at the low- and high-mass ends, respectively. From the HI HODs of central galaxies, we find that TNG100 overpredicts the number of central galaxies with high $M_{\rm HI}$ in massive halos and GAEA shows a very strong depletion of HI gas in quenched centrals of massive halos. The main cause of the differences is the AGN feedback mechanisms implemented in different models.
#### Cold day-side winds shape large leading streams in evaporating exoplanet atmospheres

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations of planetary atmospheres in HAT-P-32 b and HAT-P-67 b reveal extensive outflows reaching up to hundreds of planetary radii. The helium 1083 nm light curves for these planets, captured across their full orbits, show notable asymmetries: both planets display more pronounced pre-transit than post-transit absorptions, with HAT-P-67 b being the more extreme case of that geometry. Using three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamic simulations, we identify key factors influencing the formation of a dense leading outflow stream and characterize its morphology. Our models suggest that such a geometry of escaped material is caused by a relatively cold outflow of high mass-loss rate, launched preferentially from the planet's day side. From the simulations we calculate synthetic He I 1083 nm spectra that show large absorption depths and irregular line profiles due to complex gas kinematics. We find that the measurements of the He I 1083 nm equivalent width and the velocity shift relative to the planet's rest frame, observed over a significant portion of the planet's orbital phase, can provide important constraints on the outflow properties and its interaction with the stellar wind.
#### Binary neutron star merger offsets from their host galaxies. GW 170817 as a case study

 - **Abstract**
 Aims. The locations of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers within their host galaxies encode the systemic kicks that these systems received in the supernova aftermath. We investigate how the galactic potential and the systemic kicks shape the offset distribution of BNS mergers with a case study of GW 170817 and its host NGC 4993. Methods. We derived dynamical constraints on the host potential from integral field spectroscopy with Jeans anisotropic modelling. We evolved the trajectories of synthetic BNSs from the BPASS code in the galactic potential, using two different kick prescriptions to investigate how the observed offsets might differentiate between these two possibilities. The simulation was repeated after swapping the host potential with that of a dwarf galaxy, to test the effect of the potential on the offsets. Results. The location of GW 170817 is entirely consistent with our predictions, regardless of large or small kicks, because the strong potential of NGC 4993 is only diagnostic of very large kicks. In galaxies of similar or greater mass, large offsets can constrain large kicks, while small offsets do not provide much information. In an old dwarf galaxy, on the other hand, small offsets can constrain small kicks, while large offsets would prevent host association.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic fields are considered to be key components of massive stars, with a far-reaching impact on their evolution and ultimate fate. A magnetic mechanism was suggested for the collimated explosion of massive stars, relevant for long-duration gamma-ray bursts, X-ray flashes, and asymmetric core collapse supernovae. However, the origin of the observed stable, globally organized magnetic fields in massive stars is still a matter of debate: it has been argued that they can be fossil, dynamo generated, or generated by strong binary interactions or merging events. Taking into account that multiplicity is a fundamental characteristic of massive stars, observational evidence is accumulating that the magnetism originates through interaction between the system components, both during the initial mass transfer or when the stellar cores merge.
#### Nutation-orbit resonances: The origin of the chaotic rotation of Hyperion and the barrel instability

 - **Abstract**
 While numerous planetary and asteroid satellites show evidence for non-trivial rotation states, none are as emblematic as Hyperion, which has long been held as the most striking example of chaotic spin-orbit evolution in the Solar System. Nevertheless, an analytically tractable theory of the full 3D spin-orbit dynamics of Hyperion has not been developed. We derive the Hamiltonian for a spinning axisymmetric satellite in the gravitational potential of a planet without assuming planar or principal axis rotation and without averaging over the spin period. Using this model, we demonstrate the emergence of resonances between the nutation and orbital frequencies that act as the primary drivers of the spin dynamics. This analysis reveals that, contrary to long-held belief, Hyperion is not tumbling chaotically. Instead, it lies near or in a nutation-orbit resonance that is first-order in eccentricity, allowing it to rotate quasi-regularly. The most reliable observations are consistent with either nonchaotic motion or chaos that is orders of magnitude smaller than originally claimed. A separate phenomenon, the so-called barrel instability, is shown to be related to a different set of nutation-orbit resonances that generalize the planar spin-orbit resonances. Finally, we show that changes in spin states over long timescales are best understood by considering chaotic diffusion of quasi-conserved quantities.

 - **Abstract**
 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are objects located in the heart of galaxies which emit powerful and complex radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum. Understanding AGN has become a topic of interest due to their importance in galactic evolution and their ability to act as a probe to the distant Universe. Within the next few years, wide-field surveys such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) at the Rubin Vera Observatory are expected to increase the number of known AGN to $\mathcal{O} (10^{7})$ and the number of strongly lensed AGN to $\mathcal{O} (10^{4})$. In this paper we introduce \texttt{Amoeba}: an AGN Model of Optical Emission Beyond steady-state Accretion discs. The goal of \texttt{Amoeba} is to provide a modular and flexible modelling environment for AGN, in which all components can interact with each other. Through this work we describe the framework for major AGN components to vary self-consistently and keep flux distributions to connect these components to spatial dependent processes. We model properties beyond traditional single-component models, such as the reverberation of the corona's bending power law power spectrum through the accretion disc and broad line region (BLR). We simulate obscuration by the dusty torus and differential magnification of the disc and BLR due to microlensing. These features are joined together to create some of the most realistic light curve simulations to date. \texttt{Amoeba} takes a step forward in AGN modelling by joining the accretion disc, BLR, torus, intrinsic signal, and microlensing into a coherent model.
#### The threshold for pulsar radio emission is determined by the Goldreich-Julian charge density

 - **Abstract**
 A recent phenomenological study of radio emission from normal and millisecond pulsars by Karastergiou et al has lead these authors to state that they are unable to exclude a common physics process as the source although the rotation periods and magnetic fields of these two classes are very different. This has bearing on the nature of that source and it is the purpose the present Letter to explore this problem further, specifically for the ion-proton model and for all those models that assume electron-positron pair creation above the polar cap. The ion-proton model satisfies this commonality whereas pair creation does not. We mention briefly some consequences of these findings.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a strategy for estimating the mass per unit length along supercluster-scale filaments that are oriented across the sky, based on mock redshift surveys of 264 filaments from the Millennium simulation. In our fiducial scenario, we place each simulated filament at a distance of 300 Mpc, perpendicular to the line of sight, and calculate the redshift dispersion using galaxies with magnitudes r<19.5. Some regions are dynamically complicated in ways that interfere with finding a simple relationship between dispersion sigma and linear mass density mu. However, by examining individual overlapping segments along the filaments, we find a relationship that allows us to successfully predict log(mu) from log(sigma) with a scatter of about +/- 0.20 dex, for ~ 70% of the regions along filaments. This relationship is robust to changes in the distance to the filament if the physical segment length and the absolute magnitude for galaxy selection are held constant. The relationship between redshift dispersion and mass is similar to that obtained for a simple analytical model where filaments are dynamically relaxed, and we examine the possibility that the galaxies are indeed relaxed within the gravitational potential of the filament. We find that this is not the case; galaxy dynamics are strongly effected by infall to the filament and by orbits within groups and clusters
#### Planet Migration in Windy Discs

 - **Abstract**
 Accretion of protoplanetary discs (PPDs) could be driven by MHD disc winds rather than turbulent viscosity. With a dynamical prescription for angular momentum transport induced by disc winds, we perform 2D simulations of PPDs to systematically investigate the rate and direction of planet migration in a windy disc. We find that the the strength of disc winds influences the corotation region similarly to the "desaturation" effect of viscosity. The magnitude and direction of torque depend sensitively on the hierarchy between the radial advection timescale across the horseshoe due to disc wind $\tau_{\rm dw}$, the horsehoe libration timescale $\tau_{\rm lib}$ and U-turn timescale $\tau_{\rm U-turn}$. Initially, as wind strength increases and the advection timescale shortens, a non-linear horseshoe drag emerges when $\tau_{\rm dw} \lesssim \tau_{\rm lib}$, which tends to drive strong outward migration. Subsequently, the drag becomes linear and planets typically still migrate inward when $\tau_{\rm dw} \lesssim \tau_{\rm U-turn} \sim \tau_{\rm lib}h$, where $h$ is the disc aspect ratio. For a planet with mass ratio of $\sim 10^{-5}$, the zone of outward migration sandwiched between inner and outer inward migration zones corresponds to $\sim $ 10-100 au in a PPD with accretion rates between $10^{-8}$ and $10^{-7}$ $M_\odot \text{yr}^{-1}$.
