 - **Abstract**
 We present a spectroscopic study of the ``Disco Ball'' (SMDG0038365-064207), a rotationally-supported, red-sequence, ultra-diffuse galaxy (UDG) with a nuclear star cluster (NSC), multiple stellar clusters, and active star-forming regions using data obtained with KCWI on the Keck II Telescope. We calculate that the galaxy hosts $34\pm11$ ``globular" clusters. Kinematic measurements confirm rotation with a peak rotational velocity of at least 53km s$^{-1}$ and a dynamical mass within $r_{\rm e}$ of at least $10^{9.3 \pm 0.2}M_{\odot}$. Our dynamical estimates of the halo mass are consistent with that obtained using the number of globular clusters and together suggest $M_{\rm h}=10^{11.1\pm0.2}M_{\odot}$. The NSC may exhibit signatures of weak AGN activity. Our findings challenge two common assumptions: (1) clusters in some UDGs may be younger than generally assumed, and thus more luminous than standard globular clusters (GCs), affecting GC counts and the derived GC luminosity function in these UDGs, and (2) quiescent UDGs can be rotationally supported, making kinematic measurements viewing-angle dependent in such cases. The Disco Ball, while unremarkable in mass, size, projected structural properties, or color, reveals surprising complexity, highlighting the need for detailed studies of more UDGs.

 - **Abstract**
 We use the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) to detect $\rm CO(1-0)$, $\rm CO(3-2)$, and rest-frame 349-GHz continuum emission from an HI-selected galaxy, DLA1020+2733g, at $z\approx2.3568$ in the field of the $z=2.3553$ damped Lyman-$\alpha$ absorber (DLA) towards QSO J1020+2733. The VLA $\rm CO(1-0)$ detection yields a molecular gas mass of $(2.84\pm0.42)\times10^{11}\times(\alpha_{\rm CO}/4.36)\,\rm{M_\odot}$, the largest ever measured in an HI-selected galaxy. The DLA metallicity is $+0.28 \pm 0.16$, from the ZnII$\, \lambda2026$Å absorption line detected in a Keck Echellette Spectrograph and Imager spectrum. This continues the trend of high-metallicity DLAs being frequently associated with massive galaxies. We obtain a star-formation rate (SFR) of $\lesssim400~$M$_\odot~$yr$^{-1}$ from the rest-frame 349-GHz continuum emission, and a relatively long molecular gas depletion timescale of $\gtrsim0.6~$Gyr. The excitation of the J=3 rotational level is sub-thermal, with $r_{31}\equiv{L'_{\rm{CO(3-2)}}/L'_{\rm{CO(1-0)}}}=0.513\pm0.081$, suggesting that DLA1020+2733g has a low SFR surface density. The large velocity spread of the CO lines, $\approx500~\rm km~s^{-1}$, and the long molecular gas depletion timescale suggest that DLA1020+2733g is likely to be a cold rotating-disk galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 Using data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES), we tentatively detect two molecular hydrogen (H$_2$) fluorescent emission features in high-redshift galaxies at 2.3 and 3.1$\sigma$. These features consist of many blended emission lines that result from the de-excitation cascade of H$_2$ molecules that have absorbed Lyman-Werner band photons. Our study targets galaxies at redshifts $z \geq 7$ galaxies of the early Universe, as they host some of the most extreme conditions in terms of star formation, molecular gas content, and the possible presence of outflows driven by starbursts and active galactic nuclei. To enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of H$_2$ emission features in the rest-frame wavelength range of 155-191 nm, we stack JWST/NIRSpec spectra from $z=7.0-13.4$. These stacked spectra also exhibit atomic emission features, such as CIV emission with a P-Cygni profile, as well as CIII], OIII], and HeII. The presence of these features and the slightly blue-shifted fluorescent H$_2$ lines suggest active multiphase atomic and molecular outflows may be common at these redshifts. Our results suggest that it is possible to search for FUV fluorescent H$_2$ lines in high redshift galaxies using JWST, which would enable the characterization of interstellar radiation fields, densities, and temperatures in extreme photodissociation environments.

 - **Abstract**
 Significant theoretical and observational efforts are underway to investigate the properties of turbulence in the hot plasma that pervades galaxy clusters. Spectroscopy has been used to study the projected line-of-sight velocities in both the hot intracluster medium and the cold gas phase using optical and X-ray telescopes. In this paper, we characterize the velocity structure functions of the multiphase intracluster medium in a simulated galaxy cluster core and study the effects of projections on the hot and cold phase of the gas. To do so, we use the fiducial run of the XMAGNET suite, a collection of exascale magneto-hydrodynamical simulations of a cool-core cluster, to compute velocity structure functions. The simulation includes radiative cooling as well as a model for active galactic nuclei feedback. Examining three-dimensional and line-of-sight velocity structure functions, we find no clear correlation between the behavior of the hot ($10^6\, \mathrm{K}\, \leq T \leq 10^8 \, \mathrm{K}$) and cold ($T\leq 10^5$ K) phases VSFs. Assuming a power law model for the VSF, we find that the power law index $m$ of the cold phase varies significantly throughout the 4 Gyr simulation time. We compare our VSFs with observations using mock optical and X-ray images, and conclude that projection effects significantly impact the amplitude and power law index of both the hot and cold phases. In the cold phase, applying a Gaussian smoothing filter to model effects of atmospheric seeing increases significantly the power law index of the projected VSF at scales below the filter's kernel size. Moreover, the VSF amplitude and power law index vary significantly depending on the viewing orientation. We conclude that observational biases such as projection effects, atmospheric seeing and the viewing angle cannot be ignored when interpreting line-of-sight velocity structure of the intracluster medium.

 - **Abstract**
 Parker Solar Probe is a mission designed to explore properties of the solar wind closer than ever before. Detailed particle observations from the Solar Probe Cup (SPC) have primarily focused on examining the proton population in the solar wind. However, several periods throughout the Parker mission have indicated that SPC has observed a pronounced and distinctive population of fully ionized helium, He$^{2+}$. Minor ions are imprinted with properties of the solar wind's source region, as well as mechanisms active during outflow, making them sensitive markers of its origin and formation at the Sun. Through a detailed analysis of the He$^{2+}$ velocity distributions functions, this work examines periods where significant and persistent He$^{2+}$ peaks are observed with SPC. We compute the helium abundance and examine the stream's bulk speed, density, temperature, magnetic field topology, and electron strahl properties to identify distinctive solar wind features that can provide insight to their solar source. We find that nearly all periods exhibit an elevated mean helium composition ($8.34\%$) compared to typical solar wind and a majority ($\sim87\%$) of these periods are connected to coronal mass ejections, with the highest abundance reaching $23.1\%$. The helium abundance and number of events increases as the solar cycle approaches maximum with a weak dependence on speed. Additionally, the events not associated with a CME are clustered near the heliospheric current sheet suggesting they are connected to streamer belt outflows. However, there are currently no theoretical explanations that fully describe the range of depleted and elevated helium abundances observed.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the luminosity function and volumetric rate of a sample of Type IIP supernovae (SNe) from the Zwicky Transient Facility Census of the Local Universe survey (CLU). This is the largest sample of Type IIP SNe from a systematic volume-limited survey to-date. The final sample includes 330 Type IIP SNe and 36 low-luminosity Type II (LLIIP) SNe with $M_{\textrm{r,peak}}>-16$ mag, which triples the literature sample of LLIIP SNe. The fraction of LLIIP SNe is $19^{+3}_{-4}\%$ of the total CLU Type IIP SNe population ($8^{+1}_{-2}\%$ of all core-collapse SNe). This implies that while LLIIP SNe likely represent the fate of core-collapse SNe of $8-12$ \Msun\ progenitors, they alone cannot account for the fate of all massive stars in this mass range. To derive an absolute rate, we estimate the ZTF pipeline efficiency as a function of the apparent magnitude and the local surface brightness. We derive a volumetric rate of $(3.9_{-0.4}^{+0.4}) \times 10^{4}\ \textrm{Gpc}^{-3}\ \textrm{yr}^{-1}$ for Type IIP SNe and $(7.3_{-0.6}^{+0.6}) \times 10^{3}\ \textrm{Gpc}^{-3}\ \textrm{yr}^{-1}$ for LLIIP SNe. Now that the rate of LLIIP SNe is robustly derived, the unresolved discrepancy between core-collapse SN rates and star-formation rates cannot be explained by LLIIP SNe alone.

 - **Abstract**
 In the coming years, surveys such as the Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) are expected to increase the number of observed Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) substantially. We employ Monte Carlo integration to calculate the unlensed and lensed TDE rate as a function of limiting magnitude in $u$, $g$, $r$, and $i$-bands. We investigate the impact of multiple luminosity models, black hole mass functions (BHMFs), and flare temperatures on the TDE rate. Notably, this includes a semi-analytical model, which enables the determination of the TDE temperature in terms of black hole (BH) mass. We predict the highest unlensed TDE rate to be in $g$-band. It ranges from $16$ to $5,440\;\mathrm{yr}^{-1}\;(20,000\;\mathrm{deg}^2)^{-1}$ for the Zwicky Transient Facility, being more consistent with the observed rate at the low end. For LSST, we expect a rate in $g$-band between $3,580$ and $82,060\;\mathrm{yr}^{-1}\;(20,000\;\mathrm{deg}^2)^{-1}$. A higher theoretical prediction is understandable, as we do not consider observational effects such as completeness. The unlensed and lensed TDE rates are insensitive to the redshift evolution of the BHMF, even for LSST limiting magnitudes. The best band for detecting lensed TDEs is also $g$-band. Its predicted rates range from $0.43$ to $15\;\mathrm{yr}^{-1}\;(20,000\;\mathrm{deg}^2)^{-1}$ for LSST. The scatter of predicted rates reduces when we consider the fraction of lensed TDEs; that is, a few in ten thousand TDEs will be lensed. Despite the large scatter in the rates of lensed TDEs, our comprehensive considerations of multiple models suggest that lensed TDEs will occur in the $10$-year LSST lifetime, providing an exciting prospect for detecting such events. We expect the median redshift of a lensed TDE to be between $1.5$ and $2$. In this paper, we additionally report on lensed TDE properties, such as the BH mass and time delays.
#### A Full AGN Feedback Prescription for Numerical Models: Negative, Positive and Hot Gas-Ejection Mode

 - **Abstract**
 We build upon the state-of-the-art semi-analytic model \texttt{FEGA24} (Formation and Evolution of GAlaxies, \citealt{contini2024d}), which integrates the latest prescriptions relevant to galaxy formation and evolution, alongside a comprehensive AGN feedback model. This model incorporates three modes of feedback: negative (preventing excessive cooling), positive (enhancing star formation), and hot gas ejection (expelling gas beyond the virial radius of halos). These modes operate in a coordinated manner: the negative mode regulates the cooling process, the positive mode promotes bursts of star formation, and the hot gas ejection mode expels gas beyond the virial radius when the AGN is sufficiently powerful. Our updated semi-analytic model, \texttt{FEGA25}, retains the qualitative and quantitative consistency of the analyses presented in \cite{contini2024d}, while delivering more robust results. Notably, \texttt{FEGA25} provides a more detailed characterization of the fraction of red galaxies as a function of stellar mass, predicts a main sequence of star-forming galaxies more consistent with observations, and estimates the fraction of hot gas in halos closer to observed values. These findings underscore the importance of a physical mechanism capable of ejecting hot gas beyond the virialized region of dark matter halos without significantly altering the stellar and cold gas components. Such a mechanism is crucial to ensure the proper functioning of other processes, such as cooling and star formation. Since supernova feedback is already modeled at its maximum efficiency, AGN feedback emerges as the natural candidate for this role.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of the cluster X-ray morphology and active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity in nine $z\sim1$ galaxy clusters from the Massive and Distant Clusters of $WISE$ Survey (MaDCoWS) observed with $Chandra$. Using photon asymmetry ($A_{\text{phot}}$) to quantify X-ray morphologies, we find evidence that the four most dynamically disturbed clusters are likely to be mergers. Employing a luminosity cut of $7.6\times10^{42}$ erg/s to identify AGN in the 0.7-7.0 keV, we show that the majority of these clusters host excess AGN compared to the local field. We use the cumulative number-count ($\log N-\log S$) model to predict AGN incidence in cluster isophotes under this luminosity cut. Our analysis finds evidence (at $> 2\sigma$) of a positive correlation between AGN surface densities and photon asymmetry, suggesting that a disturbed cluster environment plays a pivotal role in regulating AGN triggering. Studying AGN incidence in cluster X-ray isophotes equivalent in area to $1.0r_{500}$, we find that the AGN space density inversely scales with cluster mass as $\sim M^{-0.5^{+0.18}_{-0.18}}$ at the 3.18$\sigma$ level. Finally, when we separately explore the cluster mass dependence of excess AGN surface density in disturbed and relaxed clusters, we see tentative evidence that the two morphologically distinct sub-populations exhibit diverging trends, especially near the outskirts, likely due to cluster merger-driven AGN triggering/suppression.

 - **Abstract**
 The rotational distribution of asteroids as a function of their size is used {as a diagnostic of} their physical properties and evolution. Recent photometric surveys from the Gaia mission, allowing observation of asteroids with long spin periods (for example $\geq 24$h), found an excessive group of slow rotators and a gap separating them from faster rotators, which is unexplained by current theories. Here we developed an asteroid rotational evolution model capable of reproducing the observed distribution. {We suggest that this distribution is regulated by the competition between collisions and internal friction dampening of "tumblers" -asteroids with unstable rotation vectors, and that the slow rotator group is mainly populated by tumblers.} {We constrain the product of the rigidity and quality factor, which relates to the body's viscosity, to $\mu Q \sim 4 \times 10^9~$Pa. This number, two orders of magnitude smaller than the one assumed for monolithic boulders,} implies that {rubble pile} asteroids could have a porous structure or a thick regolith layer, and undergo stronger tidal effects.

 I will demonstrate the effectiveness of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) when training data are scarce or noisy. The training data can be located either at the boundaries or within the domain. Additionally, PINNs can be used as an inverse method to determine unknown coefficients in the equations. This study will highlight the application of PINNs in modeling magnetohydrodynamic processes relevant to strongly magnetized plasmas, such as those found in the solar corona.

 - **Abstract**
 The dominant fraction of the extragalactic $\gamma$-ray sources are blazars, active galactic nuclei with jets inclined at a small angle to the line of sight. Apart from blazars, a few dozen narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1) and a number of radio galaxies are associated with $\gamma$-ray sources. The identification of $\gamma$-ray sources requires multiwavelength follow-up observations since several candidates could reside within the relatively large $\gamma$-ray localisation area. The $\gamma$-ray source 4FGL 0959.6+4606 was originally associated with a radio galaxy. However, follow-up multiwavelength work suggested a nearby NLS1 as the more probable origin of the $\gamma$-ray emission. We performed high-resolution very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observation at 5 GHz of both proposed counterparts of 4FGL 0959.6+4606. We clearly detected the NLS1 source SDSS J095909.51+460014.3 with relativistically boosted jet emission. On the other hand, we did not detect milliarcsecond-scale compact emission in the radio galaxy 2MASX J09591976+4603515. Our VLBI imaging results suggest that the NLS1 object is the origin of the $\gamma$-ray emission in 4FGL 0959.6+4606.

 - **Abstract**
 IceCube-Gen2, the next generation extension of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory at the South Pole, offers a unique scientific potential for cosmic-ray physics at PeV to EeV energies complementing the main science case of neutrino astronomy. The cosmic-ray science case will be enabled by a surface array on top of an extended optical array deep in the polar ice. The optical array measures TeV muons of air showers, and the surface array primarily measures the electromagnetic shower component and low-energy muons. The design of the surface array foresees scintillation panels providing a full-efficiency threshold for near-vertical proton showers of 0.5 PeV and radio antennas increasing the measurement accuracy for the electromagnetic shower component in the energy range of the Galactic-to-extragalactic transition. Compared to IceCube, the aperture for air showers measured in coincidence with the surface and optical arrays will increase by a factor of 30, due to the larger area and angular acceptance in zenith angle. The science potential includes both, the particle physics of air showers, such as prompt muons, and the astrophysics of the highest energy Galactic cosmic-rays, enabled by the higher sensitivity for the mass composition and anisotropy of cosmic rays, and by the search for PeV photons. This proceeding summarizes the science case and design of the surface array as presented in the recently released IceCube-Gen2 Technical Design Report: this https URL
#### Radio Detection of ultra-high-energy Cosmic-Ray Air Showers

 - **Abstract**
 Radio antennas have become a standard tool for the detection of cosmic-ray air showers in the energy range above $10^{16}\,$eV. The radio signal of these air showers is generated mostly due to the deflection of electrons and positrons in the geomagnetic field, and contains information about the energy and the depth of the maximum of the air showers. Unlike the traditional air-Cherenkov and air-fluorescence techniques for the electromagnetic shower component, radio detection is not restricted to clear nights, and recent experiments have demonstrated that the measurement accuracy can compete with these traditional techniques. Numerous particle detector arrays for air showers have thus been or will be complemented by radio antennas. In particular when combined with muon detectors, the complementary information provided by the radio antennas can enhance the total accuracy for the arrival direction, energy and mass of the primary cosmic rays. Digitization and computational techniques have been crucial for this recent progress, and radio detection will play an important role in next-generation experiments for ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. Moreover, stand-alone radio experiments are under development and will search for ultra-high-energy photons and neutrinos in addition to cosmic rays. This article provides a brief introduction to the physics of the radio emission of air showers, an overview of air-shower observatories using radio antennas, and highlights some of their recent results.

 - **Abstract**
 We present $I$-band time-series photometric variability studies of three known nearby ($\sim$ 140 pc) and young ( $\sim$ 1 Myr) brown dwarfs (BD) in the Taurus star-forming region in the Perseus Molecular Cloud. From 10 nights of observations over a time span of 10 years, with a typical run of 3 to 6 hours each night, we estimated that the BDs show unstable short-scale periodicity from 1.5 to 4.8 hours. Using the long-term photometry from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), we have conducted a time-resolved variability analysis of CFHT-BD-Tau 3 and CFHT-BD-Tau 4, revealing orbital periods of $\sim$ 0.96 days and $\sim$ 3 days respectively, consistent with earlier studies. We also found two superflares in TESS sector 43 data for CFHT-BD-Tau 4 and estimated the flare energies as $7.09\times10^{35}$ erg and $3.75\times10^{36}$ erg. A magnetic field of $\sim3.39 ~kG$ is required to generate such flare energies on this BD. We performed spot modelling analysis on CFHT-BD-Tau 3 and CFHT-BD-Tau 4 to address the variability detected in the data using the package BASSMAN. Spectral energy distribution and infrared colours of the sources suggest that they have a sufficient amount of circumstellar material around them.

 - **Abstract**
 A glitch is a rare and sudden increase in the otherwise steadily decreasing rotation rate of a pulsar. Its cause is widely attributed to the transfer of angular momentum to the crust of the star from the array of superfluid vortices enclosed within. The magnitude of such an increase defines the size of the glitch. The distribution of glitch sizes in individual pulsars, the power-law being the most argued for, is shrouded in uncertainty due to the small sample size. From a Bayesian perspective, we revisit the data for PSR J0537-6910, the pulsar with the most glitches, and find a bimodality in the distribution, reminiscent of the Bactrian camel. To understand this bimodality, we use a superfluid vortex simulator and study three independent neutron star paradigms: (i) Annular variation in pinning strength to account for the predicted differences between the crust and the core; (ii) Sectorial triggers to mimic local disturbances; and (iii) Stress-waves to model global disturbances. We find that annular variation in pinning introduces a bimodality in the glitch-size distribution and that sectorial triggers do so weakly. Stress-waves do not lead to any such features for the range of parameters tested. This provides us with new insights into the effects of various perturbations on the vortex dynamics and the glitch statistics of neutron stars.

 - **Abstract**
 The characteristic timescale ($\tau$) of continuum variability of the accretion disk in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is known to be related to the thermal timescale, which is predicted to scale with AGN luminosity ($L$) and restframe wavelength ($\lambda_{\rm RF}$) as $t_{\rm th} \propto L^{0.5} \lambda_{\rm RF}^2$ in the standard disk model. Using multi-epoch spectroscopic data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Reverberation Mapping project, we construct ultraviolet ensemble structure functions of luminous AGNs as a function of their luminosity and wavelength. Assuming that AGNs exhibit a single universal structure function when $\Delta t$ is normalized by $\tau$, wherein $\tau \propto L^{a} \lambda_{\rm RF}^{b}$, we find $a=0.50\pm0.03$ and $b=1.42\pm0.09$. While the value of $a$ aligns with the prediction from the standard disk model, $b$ is significantly smaller than expected, suggesting that the radial temperature (color) profile of the accretion disk is significantly steeper (shallower) than the standard disk model. Notably, this discrepancy with theory has been observed in previous studies based on spectroscopic reverberation mapping and gravitational microlensing. Although no current model of accretion disks fully matches our results, our findings provide valuable constraints for testing future physical models.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the timing and spectral analyses of the NICER, NuSTAR, and IXPE observations of the magnetar 1E 1841-045 covering 82 days following its August 2024 bursting activity as well as radio observations utilizing MeerKAT and Effelsberg. We supplement our study with a historical NuSTAR and all 2024 pre-outburst NICER observations. The outburst is marked by an X-ray flux enhancement of a factor 1.6 compared to the historical level, predominantly driven by a newly-formed non-thermal emitting component with a photon index $\Gamma=1.5$. This flux showed a 20% decay at the end of our monitoring campaign. The radio monitoring did not reveal any pulsed radio emission with an upper-limit of 20 mJy and 50 mJy ms on the mean flux density and single pulse fluence, respectively. We detect a spin-up glitch at outburst onset with a $\Delta\nu=6.1\times10^{-8}$ Hz and a $\Delta\dot{\nu}=-1.4\times10^{-14}$ Hz s$^{-1}$, consistent with the near-universality of this behavior among the continuously-monitored magnetars. Most intriguingly, the 1E 1841-045 2-10 keV pulse profile is markedly different compared to pre-outburst; it shows a new, narrow (0.1 cycles) peak that appears to shift towards merging with the main, persistently-present, pulse. This is the second case of pulse-peak migration observed in magnetars after SGR 1830$-$0645, and the two sources exhibit a similar rate of phase shift. This implies that this phenomenon is not unique and might present itself in the broader population. The newly-formed peak for 1E 1841-045 is non-thermal, with emission extending to $\gtrsim20$ keV, in contrast to the case of SGR 1830$-$0645. Our results are consistent with an untwisting magnetic field bundle with migration towards the magnetic pole, perhaps accompanied by plastic motion of the crust.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we conduct a detailed study on the effect of Radiative Torque Disruption (RATD) mechanism on the fragmentation of micrometer-sized dust grains into nanoparticles within the heliosphere. We start by estimating the disruption timescales for dust grains under various centrifugal stresses. Our numerical calculations demonstrate that RATD is a highly effective mechanism for breaking down micrometer-sized grains, producing nanoparticles more efficiently than other fragmentation processes. RATD also prevents micrometer-sized grains from being expelled by radiation pressure. Our findings indicate that the location of the present water snow line depends not only on temperature but also on the size of dust grains. For smaller grains, the snow line can shift outward beyond the position defined by thermal sublimation. Furthermore, we model the size distribution of dust grains modified by the RATD mechanism using a simplified model, showing that rotational disruption significantly decreases the number density of micrometer-sized grains while substantially increasing the number density of sub-micrometer-sized grains. However, the fraction of dust grains aligned at high-$J$ attractors by radiative torques less than 80\% can considerably weaken the effect of RATD on the grain size distribution. Finally, we suggest several experiments that could potentially test the RATD mechanism and discuss the uncertainties of our model in more realistic applications to heliospheric dust.
