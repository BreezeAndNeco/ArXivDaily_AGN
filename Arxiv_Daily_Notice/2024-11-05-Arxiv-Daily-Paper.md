 - **Abstract**
 Using early data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey, we search for AGN signatures in 410,757 line-emitting galaxies. By employing the BPT emission-line ratio diagnostic diagram, we identify AGN in 75,928/296,261 ($\approx$25.6%) high-mass ($\log (M_{\star}/\rm M_{\odot}) >$ 9.5) and 2,444/114,496 ($\approx$2.1%) dwarf ($\log (M_{\star}/\rm M_{\odot}) \leq$ 9.5) galaxies. Of these AGN candidates, 4,181 sources exhibit a broad H$\alpha$ component, allowing us to estimate their BH masses via virial techniques. This study more than triples the census of dwarf AGN as well as that of intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH; $M_{\rm BH} \le 10^6~\rm M_{\odot}$) candidates, spanning a broad discovery space in stellar mass (7 $< \log (M_{\star}/\rm M_{\odot}) <$ 12) and redshift (0.001 $< \rm z <$ 0.45). The observed AGN fraction in dwarf galaxies ($\approx$2.1%) is nearly four times higher than prior estimates, primarily due to DESI's smaller fiber size, which enables the detection of lower luminosity dwarf AGN candidates. We also extend the $M_{\rm BH}$ - $M_{\star}$ scaling relation down to $\log (M_{\star}/\rm M_{\odot}) \approx$ 8.5 and $\log (M_{\rm BH}/M_{\odot}) \approx$ 4.4, with our results aligning well with previous low-redshift studies. The large statistical sample of dwarf AGN candidates from current and future DESI releases will be invaluable for enhancing our understanding of galaxy evolution at the low-mass end of the galaxy mass function.

 - **Abstract**
 High-velocity outflows are ubiquitous in star-forming galaxies at cosmic noon, but are not as common in passive galaxies at the same epoch. Using optical spectra of galaxies selected from the UKIDSS Ultra Deep Survey (UDS) at z > 1, we perform a stacking analysis to investigate the transition in outflow properties along a quenching time sequence. To do this, we use MgII (2800 A) absorption profiles to investigate outflow properties as a function of time since the last major burst of star formation (tburst). We find evidence for high-velocity outflows in the star-forming progenitor population (vout ~ 1400 $\pm$ 210 km/s), for recently quenched galaxies with tburst < 0.6 Gyr (vout ~ 990 $\pm$ 250 km/s), and for older quenched galaxies with 0.6 < tburst < 1 Gyr (vout ~ 1400 $\pm$ 220 km/s). The oldest galaxies (tburst > 1 Gyr) show no evidence for significant outflows. Our samples show no signs of AGN in optical observations, suggesting that any AGN in these galaxies have very short duty cycles, and were 'off' when observed. The presence of significant outflows in the older quenched galaxies (tburst > 0.6 Gyr) is difficult to explain with starburst activity, however, and may indicate energy input from episodic AGN activity as the starburst fades.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of Faraday rotation and synchrotron emission in galaxy clusters imply large-scale magnetic fields with $\mu\mathrm{G}$ strengths possibly extending back to $z=4$. Non-radiative cosmological simulations of galaxy clusters show a comparably slow magnetic field growth that only saturates at late times. We include galaxy formation physics and find a significantly accelerated magnetic field growth. We identify three crucial stages in the magnetic field evolution. 1) At high redshift, the central dominant galaxy serves as the prime agent that magnetizes not only its immediate vicinity but also most of the forming protocluster through a combination of a small-scale dynamo induced by gravitationally driven, compressive turbulence and stellar and active galactic nuclei feedback that distribute the magnetic field via outflows. 2) This process continues as other galaxies merge into the forming cluster in subsequent epochs, thereby transporting their previously amplified magnetic field to the intracluster medium (ICM) through ram pressure stripping and galactic winds. 3) At lower redshift, gas accretion and frequent cluster mergers trigger additional small-scale dynamo processes, thereby preventing the decay of the magnetic field and fostering the increase of the magnetic coherence scale. We show that the magnetic field observed today in the weakly collisional ICM is consistently amplified on collisional scales. Initially, this occurs in the collisional interstellar medium during protocluster assembly, and later in the ICM on the magnetic coherence scale, which always exceeds the particle mean free path, supporting the use of magneto-hydrodynamics for studying the cluster dynamo. We generate synthetic Faraday rotation measure observations of protoclusters, highlighting the potential for studying magnetic field growth during the onset of cluster formation at cosmic dawn.

 - **Abstract**
 We present observations of the high-mass star-forming region S255IR, which harbors the $\sim$20 M$_\odot$ protostar NIRS3, where a disk-mediated accretion burst was recorded several years ago, with the angular resolution of $\sim$15 mas, which corresponds to $\sim$25 au and is almost an order of magnitude better than in the previous studies of this object. The observations were performed with ALMA at a wavelength of 0.9 mm in continuum and in several molecular lines. In the continuum we detected the central bright source (brightness temperature $\sim$850 K) elongated along the jet direction and two pairs of bright knots in the jet lobes. These pairs of knots imply a double ejection from NIRS3 with the time interval of $\sim$1.5 years. The orientation of the jet differs by $\sim$20$^\circ$ from that on larger scales, as mentioned also in some other recent works. The 0.9 mm continuum emission of the central source represents a mixture of the dust thermal emission and free-free emission of the ionized gas. Properties of the free-free emission are typical for hypercompact H II regions. In the continuum emission of the knots in the jet the free-free component apparently dominates. In the molecular lines a sub-Keplerian disk around NIRS3 about 400 au in diameter is observed. The absorption features in the molecular lines towards the central bright source may indicate an infall. The molecular line emission appears very inhomogeneous at small scales, which may indicate a small-scale clumpiness in the disk.

 - **Abstract**
 We present steady-state solutions for a one-dimensional, magnetically-driven accretion disk wind model based on magnetohydrodynamic equations. We assume a geometrically thin, gas-pressure-dominated accretion disk, incorporating both magnetic braking and turbulent viscosity introduced by an extended alpha-viscosity prescription. Additionally, the vertical stress parameter is assumed to scale with the disk aspect ratio. We confirm that the derived solutions result in standard disk solutions when the wind is absent. We find that the mass accretion rate decreases as the disk mass falls inward, while the mass loss rate increases with radius. The disk spectrum emitted from the magnetically-driven disk wind can be observed without interference from the wind medium because the wind is significantly optically thin. The spectral luminosity is proportional to $\nu^{1/3}$ in the intermediate, multicolor-blackbody wavebands, in the absence of wind, as predicted by standard disk theory. However, in the presence of wind, it follows a different power-law dependence on frequency over the same range. A deviation from the spectral slope of $1/3$, particularly a negative spectral slope, is a clear indicator of the presence of a magnetically driven wind. We also discuss an observational strategy to test our model with multi-wavelength observations.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the effects of the magnetic field and the redshift on the propagation of galactic and extragalactic cosmic rays (CRs) in a modified theory of gravity (MTG) and an alternative theory of gravity (ATG) framework. For this purpose, we consider the $f(R)$ gravity and the $f(Q)$ gravity theories. We utilise these two MTG and ATG to compute the density enhancement factor of CRs as a function of the magnetic field and the redshift. For this work, we take the magnetic field strength from $1-100$ nG, while $0-2.5$ for the redshift. For each of these parameters, we take $100$ bins within their considered range for the computation. The enhancement parameter for the mixed composition of heavy nuclei up to Fe is also taken into account for this work. Further, we compute the $E^3$ magnified diffusive flux for $150$ sources separated by a distance $d_\text{s}$ for the different cosmological models. For the fitting with observational data from the Pierre Auger Observatory (PAO) and Telescope Array (TA), we parameterized some set that consists of the redshift $z$, the separation distances $d_\text{s}$ between the $150$ sources, and the maximum cutoff energy $E_{\text{max}}$. For each case, a residue plot and $\chi^2$ value are also added to check the goodness of fitting. A comparative analysis of considered models has been performed in each of the cases along with the $\Lambda$CDM model. The considered MTG and ATG models produce notable and fascinating outcomes, with the $f(Q)$ model showing the highest CR density enhancement and the lowest reduced chi-squared value when fitted to PAO and TA data of UHECRs flux. This research provides new perspectives on the connections between high-energy physics, astrophysics, and cosmology.

 - **Abstract**
 The identification of large numbers of localised transient EUV brightenings, with small spatial scales, in the quiet-Sun corona has been one of the key early results from Solar Orbiter. However, much is still unknown about these events. Here, we aim to better understand EUV brightenings by investigating their spatial distributions, specifically whether they occur co-spatial with specific line-of-sight magnetic field topologies in the photospheric network. EUV brightenings are detected using an automated algorithm applied to a high-cadence (3 s) dataset sampled over ~30 min on 8 March 2022 by the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager's 17.4 nm EUV High Resolution Imager. Data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory's Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager and Atmospheric Imaging Assembly are used to provide context about the line-of-sight magnetic field and for alignment purposes. We found a total of 5064 EUV brightenings within this dataset that are directly comparable to events reported previously in the literature. These events occurred within around 0.015-0.020 % of pixels for any given frame. We compared eight different thresholds to split the EUV brightenings into four different categories related to the line-of-sight magnetic field. Using our preferred threshold, we found that 627 EUV brightenings (12.4 %) occurred co-spatial with Strong Bipolar configurations and 967 EUV brightenings (19.1 %) occurred in Weak Field regions. Fewer than 10 % of EUV brightenings occurred co-spatial with Unipolar line-of-sight magnetic field no matter what threshold was used. Of the 627 Strong Bipolar EUV Brightenings, 54 were found to occur co-spatial with cancellation whilst 57 occurred co-spatial with emergence. EUV brightenings preferentially occur co-spatial with the strong line-of-sight magnetic field in the photospheric network. They do not, though, predominantly occur co-spatial with (cancelling) bi-poles.

 - **Abstract**
 The objective of the coronagraphic IFU of RISTRETTO is to enable High Dispersion Coronagraphy of planets at a distance of 2$\lambda$/D from their star, without compromising on transmission. The new idea of a PIAA Nuller (PIAAN) allows contrast down to 10$^{-5}$ over large bandwidth $\ge$ 25%, with high transmission $\ge$ 70% at the distance of 2$\lambda$/D. While RISTRETTO will be installed on a VLT, this development is of tremendous importance for fully exploiting future ELTs XAO. We will discuss our PIAAN prototyping activities. This covers 1) the characterisation of our 2nd set of IFU bundles, with 3D-printed MLAs; 2) the characterisation of our first PIAA optics; 3) the integration of a high contrast bench, planned for prototyping of Front-End control strategies; 4) the characterisation of the PIAAN system on the bench.

 - **Abstract**
 The formation mechanism of interstellar formamide (NH$_2$CHO), a key prebiotic precursor, is currently a matter of hot debate within the astrochemistry community, with both gas-phase and grain-surface chemical pathways having been proposed as its dominant formation route. The aim of the present study is to place firm observational constraints on the formation pathways leading to formamide thanks to new interferometric observations of the molecular outflow driven by the protostellar binary L1157. We employed the IRAM NOEMA interferometer to map the entire southern outflow of L1157, which contains three main shocked regions with increasing post-shock age: B0, B1, and B2. This allowed us to measure how the abundance of formamide, that of acetaldehyde (CH$_3$CHO), and the ratio of the two, vary with time in this region. In order to gain a greater understanding of the most likely formation routes of formamide, we ran a grid of astrochemical models and compared these to our observations. A comparison between observations and astrochemical modelling indicates that there are two possible scenarios: one in which the amount of formamide observed can be explained by gas-phase-only chemistry, and more specifically via the reaction H$_2$CO + NH$_2$ $\rightarrow$ NH$_2$CHO + H$_2$, and another in which part of the observed formamide originates from surface chemistry and part from gas-phase chemistry. Surface chemistry alone cannot account for the abundance of formamide that we measure. While grain-surface chemistry cannot be ruled out, the present study brings definitive proof that gas-phase chemistry does work in L1157-B and acts efficiently in the production of this molecular species.
#### Probing Broadband Spectral Energy Distribution and Variability of Mrk\,501 in the low flux state

 - **Abstract**
 We conducted a multi-wavelength analysis of the blazar Mrk\,501, utilizing observations from \emph{Astro}Sat (SXT, LAXPC), \emph{Swift-UVOT}, and \emph{Fermi-LAT} during the period August 15, 2016 to March 27, 2022. The resulting multi-wavelength light curve revealed relatively low activity of the source across the electromagnetic spectrum. Notably, logparabola and broken power-law models provided a better fit to the joint X-ray spectra from \emph{Astro}Sat-SXT/LAXPC instruments compared to the power-law model. During the low activity state, the source showed the characteristic harder when brighter trend at the X-ray energies. To gain insights into underlying physical processes responsible for the broadband emission, we performed a detailed broadband spectral analysis using the convolved one-zone leptonic model with different forms of particle distributions such as logparabola (LP), broken power-law (BPL), power-law model with maximum energy ($\xi_{max}$), and energy-dependent acceleration (EDA) models. Our analysis revealed similar reduced-$\chi^2$ values for the four particle distributions. The LP and EDA models exhibited the lowest jet powers. The correlation analyses conducted for the LP and BPL models revealed that there is a positive correlation between jet power and bulk Lorentz factor. Specifically, in the LP model, jet power proved independent of $\gamma_{min}$, whereas in the broken power-law model, jet power decreased with an increase in $\gamma_{min}$. The jet power in the LP/EDA particle distribution is nearly 10 percent of the Eddington luminosity of a $10^7$ M$_\odot$ black hole. This result suggests that the jet could potentially be fueled by accretion processes.

 - **Abstract**
 The Vela pulsar (J0835-4510) is known to exhibit variations in Faraday rotation and dispersion on multi-decade timescales due to the changing sightline through the surrounding Vela supernova remnant and the Gum Nebula. Until now, variations in Faraday rotation towards Vela have not been studied on timescales less than around a decade. We present the results of a high-cadence observing campaign carried out with the Aperture Array Verification System 2 (AAVS2), a prototype SKA-Low station, which received a significant bandwidth upgrade in 2022. We collected observations of the Vela pulsar and PSR J0630-2834 (a nearby pulsar located outside the Gum Nebula), spanning $\sim 1\,\mathrm{yr}$ and $\sim 0.3\,\mathrm{yr}$ respectively, and searched for linear trends in the rotation measure (RM) as a function of time. We do not detect any significant trends on this timescale ($\sim$months) for either pulsar, but the constraints could be greatly improved with more accurate ionospheric models. For the Vela pulsar, the combination of our data and historical data from the published literature have enabled us to model long-term correlated trends in RM and dispersion measure (DM) over the past two decades. We detect a change in DM of $\sim 0.3\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}\,\mathrm{pc}$ which corresponds to a change in electron density of $\sim 10^5\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ on a transverse length scale of $\sim$1-2 au. The apparent magnetic field strength in the time-varying region changes from $240^{+30}_{-20}\,\mu\mathrm{G}$ to $-6.2^{+0.7}_{-0.9}\,\mu\mathrm{G}$ over the time span of the data set. As well as providing an important validation of polarimetry, this work highlights the pulsar monitoring capabilities of SKA-Low stations, and the niche science opportunities they offer for high-precision polarimetry and probing the microstructure of the magneto-ionic interstellar medium.

 - **Abstract**
 Numerical simulations have shown that the strength of planetary magnetic fields depends on the convective energy flux emerging from planetary interiors. Here we model the interior structure of gas giant planets using \texttt{MESA}, to determine the convective energy flux that can drive the generation of magnetic field. This flux is then incorporated in the Christensen et al. dynamo formalism to estimate the maximum dipolar magnetic field $B^\mathrm{(max)}_\mathrm{dip}$ of our simulated planets. First, we explore how the surface field of intensely irradiated hot Jupiters ($\sim 300 M_\oplus$) and hot Neptunes ($\sim 20 M_\oplus$) evolve as they age. Assuming an orbital separation of 0.1 au, for the hot Jupiters, we find that $B^\mathrm{(max)}_\mathrm{dip}$ evolves from 240 G at 500 Myr to 120 G at 5~Gyr. For hot Neptunes, the magnetic field evolves from 11 G at young ages and dies out at $\gtrsim$ 2 Gyr. Furthermore, we also investigate the effects of atmospheric mass fraction, atmospheric evaporation, orbital separations $\alpha$ and additional planetary masses on the derived $B^\mathrm{(max)}_\mathrm{dip}$. We found that $B^\mathrm{(max)}_\mathrm{dip}$ increases with $\alpha$ for very close-in planets and plateaus out after that. Higher atmospheric mass fractions lead in general to stronger surface fields, because they allow for more extensive dynamo regions and stronger convection.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar energetic particles (SEPs) associated with solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are key agents of space weather phenomena, posing severe threats to spacecraft and astronauts. Recent observations by Parker Solar Probe (PSP) indicate that the magnetic flux ropes of a CME can trap energetic particles and act as barriers, preventing other particles from crossing. In this paper, we introduce the novel COCONUT+PARADISE model to investigate the confinement of energetic particles within a flux rope and the effects of cross-field diffusion (CFD) on particle transport in the solar corona, particularly in the presence of a CME. Using the global magnetohydrodynamic coronal model COCONUT, we generate background configurations containing a CME modeled as a Titov-Démoulin flux rope (TDFR). We then utilize the particle transport code PARADISE to inject monoenergetic 100 keV protons inside one of the TDFR legs near its footpoint and evolve the particles through the COCONUT backgrounds. To study CFD, we employ two different approaches regarding the perpendicular proton mean free path (MFP): a constant MFP and a Larmor radius-dependent MFP. We contrast these results with those obtained without CFD. While particles remain fully trapped within the TDFR without CFD, we find that even relatively small perpendicular MFP values allow particles on the outer layers to escape. In contrast, the initially interior trapped particles stay largely confined. Finally, we highlight how our model and this paper's results are relevant for future research on particle acceleration and transport in an extended domain encompassing both the corona and inner heliosphere.

 - **Abstract**
 Propagation of interplanetary (IP) shocks, particularly those driven by coronal mass ejections (CMEs), is still an outstanding question in heliophysics and space weather forecasting. Here we address effects of the ambient solar wind on the propagation of two similar CME-driven shocks from the Sun to Earth. The two shock events (CME03: April 3, 2010 and CME12: July 12, 2012) have the following properties: Both events (1) were driven by a halo CME (i.e., source location is near the Sun-Earth line), (2) had a CME source in the southern hemisphere, (3) had a similar transit time (~2 days) to Earth, (4) occurred in a non-quiet solar period, and (5) led to a severe geomagnetic storm. The initial (near the Sun) propagation speed, as measured by coronagraph images, was slower (by ~300 km/s) for CME03 than CME12, but it took about the same amount of traveling time for both events to reach Earth. According to the in-situ solar wind observations from the Wind spacecraft, the CME03-driven shock was associated with a faster solar wind upstream of the shock than the CME12-driven shock. This is also demonstrated in our global MHD simulations. Analysis of our simulation result indicates that the drag force indirectly plays an important role in the shock propagation. The present study suggests that in addition to the initial CME propagation speed near the Sun the shock speed (in the inertial frame) and the ambient solar wind condition, in particular the solar wind speed, are the key to timing the arrival of CME-driven-shock events.
