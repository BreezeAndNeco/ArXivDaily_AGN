 - **Abstract**
 JWST has uncovered large numbers of compact galaxies at high redshift with broad hydrogen/helium lines. These include the enigmatic population known as "little red dots" (LRDs). Their nature is debated, but they are thought to be powered by supermassive black holes (SMBHs) or intense star formation. They exhibit unusual properties for SMBHs, such as black holes that are overmassive for their host galaxies and extremely weak X-ray and radio emission. Using the highest-quality JWST spectra, we show here that the lines are broadened by electron scattering with a narrow intrinsic line core. The data require high electron column densities and compact sizes (light days), which, when coupled with their high luminosities can only be explained by SMBH accretion. The narrow intrinsic cores of the lines imply upper limits on the black hole masses of $10^{5-7}$ $M_{\odot}$, two orders of magnitude lower than previous estimates. These are among the lowest mass SMBHs known at high redshift and suggest that this is a population of young, rapidly growing SMBHs. They are enshrouded in a dense cocoon of ionized gas, probably related to their youth, from which they are accreting close to the Eddington limit. Reprocessed nebular emission from the dense cocoon dominates the optical spectrum, explaining most LRD spectral characteristics and helping to suppress radio and X-ray emission.

 - **Abstract**
 The physical processes that led to the formation of billion solar mass black holes within the first 700 million years of cosmic time remain a puzzle. Several theoretical scenarios have been proposed to seed and rapidly grow black holes, but direct observations of these mechanisms remain elusive. Here we present a source 660 million years after the Big Bang that displays singular properties: among the largest Hydrogen Balmer breaks reported at any redshift, broad multi-peaked H$\beta$ emission, and Balmer line absorption in multiple transitions. We model this source as a "black hole star" (BH*) where the Balmer break and absorption features are a result of extremely dense, turbulent gas forming a dust-free "atmosphere" around a supermassive black hole. This source may provide evidence of an early black hole embedded in dense gas -- a theoretical configuration proposed to rapidly grow black holes via super-Eddington accretion. Radiation from the BH* appears to dominate almost all observed light, leaving limited room for contribution from its host galaxy. We demonstrate that the recently discovered "Little Red Dots" (LRDs) with perplexing spectral energy distributions can be explained as BH*s embedded in relatively brighter host galaxies. This source provides evidence that black hole masses in the LRDs may be over-estimated by orders of magnitude -- the BH* is effectively dust-free contrary to the steep dust corrections applied while modeling LRDs, and the physics that gives rise to the complex line shapes and luminosities may deviate from assumptions underlying standard scaling relations.
#### A remarkable Ruby: Absorption in dense gas, rather than evolved stars, drives the extreme Balmer break of a Little Red Dot at $z=3.5$

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of the rest-optical emission of compact, red, high-redshift sources known as `little red dots' (LRDs) poses a major puzzle. If interpreted as starlight, it would imply that LRDs would constitute the densest stellar systems in the Universe. However, alternative models suggest active galactic nuclei (AGN) may instead power the rest-optical continuum. Here, we present JWST/NIRSpec, NIRCam and MIRI observations from the RUBIES and PRIMER programs of The Cliff: a bright LRD at $z=3.55$ with an exceptional Balmer break, twice as strong as that of any high-redshift source previously observed. The spectra also reveal broad Hydrogen (H$\alpha\ \rm FWHM\sim1500$km/s) and He I emission, but no significant metal lines. We demonstrate that massive evolved stellar populations cannot explain the observed spectrum, even when considering unusually steep and strong dust attenuation, or reasonable variations in the initial mass function. Moreover, the formally best-fit stellar mass and compact size ($M_*\sim10^{10.5}\,M_\odot,\ r_{e}\sim40\,$pc) would imply densities at which near-monthly stellar collisions might lead to significant X-ray emission. We argue that the Balmer break, emission lines, and H$\alpha$ absorption line are instead most plausibly explained by a `black hole star' (BH*) scenario, in which dense gas surrounds a powerful ionising source. In contrast to recently proposed BH* models of dust-reddened AGN, we show that spectral fits in the rest UV to near-infrared favour an intrinsically redder continuum over strong dust reddening. This may point to a super-Eddington accreting massive black hole or, possibly, the presence of (super)massive stars in a nuclear star cluster. The Cliff is the clearest evidence to date that at least some LRDs are not ultra-dense, massive galaxies, and are instead powered by a central ionising source embedded in dense, absorbing gas.
#### Looking for the γ-Ray Cascades of the KM3-230213A Neutrino Source

 - **Abstract**
 The extreme energy of the KM3-230213A event could transform our understanding of the most energetic sources in the Universe. However, it also reveals an inconsistency between the KM3NeT detection and strong IceCube constraints on the ultra-high energy neutrino flux. The most congruous explanation for the KM3NeT and IceCube data requires KM3-230213A to be produced by a (potentially transient) source fortuitously located in a region where the KM3NeT acceptance is maximized. In hadronic models of ultra-high-energy neutrino production, such a source would also produce a bright {\gamma}-ray signal, which would cascade to GeV--TeV energies due to interactions with extragalactic background light. We utilize the {\gamma}-Cascade package to model the spectrum, spatial extension, and time-delay of such a source, and scan a region surrounding the KM3NeT event to search for a consistent {\gamma}-ray signal. We find no convincing evidence for a comparable \textit{Fermi}-LAT source and place constraints on a combination of the source redshift and the intergalactic magnetic field strength between the source and Earth.

 - **Abstract**
 The baryonic Tully Fisher relation (bTFR) provides an empirical connection between baryonic mass and dynamical mass (measured by the maximum rotation velocity) for galaxies. Due to the impact of baryonic feedback in the shallower potential wells of dwarf galaxies, the bTFR is predicted to turn down at low masses from the extrapolated power-law relation at high masses. The low-mass end of the bTFR is poorly constrained due to small samples and difficulty in connecting the galaxy's gas kinematics to its dark matter halo. Simulations can help us understand this connection and interpret observations. We measure the bTFR with 66 dwarf galaxies from the Marvel-ous and Marvelous Massive Dwarfs hydrodynamic simulations. Our sample has M$_\star = 10^6-10^9$ M$_\odot$, and is mostly gas dominated. We compare five velocity methods: V$_\text{out,circ}$ (spatially resolved mass-enclosed), V$_\text{out,mid}$ (spatially resolved midplane gravitational potential), and unresolved HI linewidths at different percentages of the peak flux (W$_\text{10}$, W$_\text{20}$, and W$_\text{50}$). We find an intrinsic turndown in the bTFR for maximum halo speeds $\lesssim 50$ km s$^{-1}$ (or total baryonic mass, M$_\text{bary}\lesssim 10^{8.5}$ M$_\odot$). We find that observing HI in lower-mass galaxies to the conventional surface density limit of 1M$_\odot$pc$^{-2}$ is not enough to detect a turndown in the bTFR; none of the HI velocity methods (spatially resolved or unresolved) recover the turndown, and we find bTFR slopes consistent with observations of higher-mass galaxies. However, we predict that the turndown can be recovered by resolved rotation curves if the HI limit is $\lesssim 0.08$ M$_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$, which is within the sensitivity of current HI surveys like FEASTS and MHONGOOSE.

 - **Abstract**
 Radiation is crucial not only for observing astrophysical objects, but also for transporting energy and momentum. However, accurate on-the-fly radiation transport in astrophysical simulations is challenging and computationally expensive. Here we introduce AREPO-IDORT (Implicit Discrete Ordinates Radiation Transport), a scheme coupled to the explicit magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) solver in the 3D moving-mesh code AREPO. The discrete ordinates scheme means we directly solve for the specific intensities along discrete directions. We solve the time-dependent relativistic radiation transport equation via an implicit Jacobi-like iterative finite-volume solver, which overcomes the small radiation time-steps needed by explicit methods. Compared to commonly-used moment-based methods, e.g. flux-limited diffusion or M1 closure, this scheme has the advantage of correctly capturing the direction of radiation in both optically-thick and thin regions. It is based on the scheme by Jiang 2021 for the adaptive mesh refinement code ATHENA++, but we generalize the scheme to support (1) an unstructured moving-mesh, (2) local time-stepping, and (3) general equations of state. We show various test problems that commonly-used moment-based methods fail to reproduce accurately. To apply the scheme to a real astrophysics problem, we show the first global 3D radiation hydrodynamic simulation of the entire convective envelope of a red supergiant star. (abridged) For this problem, the radiation module only takes less than half of the total computational cost. Our current scheme assumes grey radiation, is first-order accurate in both time and space (abridged). We expect our scheme will enable more accurate multi-scale radiation MHD simulations involving supersonic bulk motions, ranging from planet formation in protoplanetary disks, stars and associated transients, to accretion flows near black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 We examine the star cluster populations in the three nearby galaxies IC 342, NGC 2403, and Holmberg II, observed as part of the Euclid Early Release Observations programme. Our main focus is on old globular clusters (GCs), for which the wide field-of-view and excellent image quality of Euclid offer substantial advantages over previous work. For IC 342 this is the first study of stellar clusters other than its nuclear cluster. After selection based on size and magnitude criteria, followed by visual inspection, we identify 111 old (> 1 Gyr) GC candidates in IC 342, 50 in NGC 2403 (of which 15 were previously known), and 7 in Holmberg II. In addition, a number of younger and/or intermediate-age candidates are identified. The colour distributions of GC candidates in the two larger galaxies show hints of bimodality with peaks at IE-HE = 0.36 and 0.79 (IC 342) and IE-HE = 0.36 and 0.80 (NGC 2403), corresponding to metallicities of [Fe/H]=-1.5 and [Fe/H]=-0.5, similar to those of the metal-poor and metal-rich GC subpopulations in the Milky Way. The luminosity functions of our GC candidates exhibit an excess of relatively faint objects, relative to a canonical, approximately Gaussian GC luminosity function (GCLF). The excess objects may be similar to those previously identified in other galaxies. The specific frequency of classical old GCs in IC 342, as determined based on the brighter half of the GCLF, appears to be unusually low with SN=0.2-0.3. The combined luminosity function of young and intermediate-age clusters in all three galaxies is consistent with a power-law distribution, dN/dL ~ L^(-2.3+/-0.1) and the total numbers of young clusters brighter than M(IE)=-8 in NGC 2403 and Holmberg II are comparable with those found in their Local Group counterparts, that is, M33 and the Small Magellanic Cloud, respectively.
#### Unravelling the dynamics of cosmic vortices: Probing a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in the jet of 3C 84

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the creation of relativistic jets originating from active galactic nuclei, require a thorough understanding of the accompanying plasma instabilities. Our high sensitivity, high resolution, global very long baseline interferometry observations of the jet in the radio galaxy 3C 84 enable us to study its inner morphology, which resembles a thread-like pattern. We find that this pattern can be described by a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, consisting of four instability modes. Our model favours a jet described by a Mach number of $M_\textrm{j} = 5.0\pm1.7$ and a sound speed of $\alpha_\textrm{j} = 0.14\pm0.06$. With it, we are able to describe the internal structure of 3C 84 and to tentatively connect the origin of the instability to accretion disc activity.

 - **Abstract**
 The physico-chemical properties of the planetary nebula (PN) NGC 3242 are investigated in both 1D and 2D, using Integral Field Unit (IFU) data. This PN has a complex morphology with multiple shells and contains a pair of structures with a lower degree of ionization compared to the main nebular components. These structures are known as low ionization structures (LISs), and their origin is still a mystery. With the capabilities provided by IFU spectroscopy, we aim to gain a better understanding of the behavior of nebular properties in the LISs. Data from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) at the Very Large Telescope (VLT) were used in order to perform a spatially resolved physico-chemical analysis of NGC 3242 both in 2D, through the analysis of emission line maps, and in 1D, simulating long-slit spectroscopy, with pseudo-slits. Through the deeper investigation of MUSE data, we detect new structures perpendicular to the pair of LISs of NGC 3242, which are mainly seen in the light of [S III] and [N II]. In addition, two arc-like structures are revealed. Moreover, an inner jet-like structure is found through its [Fe III] emission. The interaction of the jet with the rim may be related to the formation of knots and blobs. The higher value of Te, is estimated from the [S III] diagnostic lines, followed by Te ([N II]), Te(H I) and finally Te (He I). In all cases, Te is higher at the inner nebular structures. Regarding electron density, ne, is lower at the LISs, while an increase is observed at the nebular rim. Diagnostic diagrams confirm that NGC 3242 is a highly ionized nebula. Moreover, the MUSE data unveiled for the first time in this PN, the atomic line [C I] {\lambda}8727, primarily emitted from the LISs. This finding suggests that these structures may consist of a molecular core surrounded by neutral and ionized gas
#### Evolution of Shock Structures and QPOs After Halting BHL Accretion onto Kerr Black Hole

 - **Abstract**
 One of the mechanisms responsible for disk formation around the black holes is Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) this http URL fact that BHL accretion can be interrupted by various astrophysical phenomena, such as stellar winds or astrophysical jets, makes it crucial to study the behavior of shock cones formed by BHL accretion around black holes once the accretion process is halted. Investigating the new plasma structures that emerge in these scenarios can provide insights into observational results. In this context, a new plasma structure forming around the Kerr black hole has been numerically modeled as a function of the black hole spin parameter and the asymptotic velocity of BHL accretion. The numerical analysis revealed that high spin (a/M=0.9) and supersonic flow ( M > 1) are necessary conditions for low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (LFQPOs) formation. On the other hand, the fundamental mode of the high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (HFQPOs) are found to be independent of both the black hole spin and asymptotic velocity and are instead governed by general relativistic effects. Additionally, the study demonstrated that for 3:2 and 2:1 resonance states to form, nonlinear couplings needs to be occurred when the black hole rotates rapidly. These couplings produce harmonic frequencies, providing an explanation for the observed quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) resonances in black hole binaries. These findings align with precession models and nonlinear resonance models, both of which play a crucial role in QPO generation. Finally, the LFQPOs and HFQPOs obtained from numerical simulations are consistent with the observed QPO frequencies in the microquasars GRS 1915+105 and XTE J1550-564, as well as in the AGN REJ1034+396, which harbors a supermassive black hole at its center.

 - **Abstract**
 Calibration of instrumental polarization is critical for measuring polarized radio emissions from astrophysical sources to extract the magnetic field information in astrophysical, heliospheric, and terrestrial plasmas. At meter wavelengths, calibration of radio polarimetric observations is particularly challenging because of the scarcity of bright polarized sources due to significant Faraday depolarization. Here, we present a novel formalism for polarization calibration using an unpolarized sky model. The formalism is specifically designed for wide-field, low-frequency instruments like the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR), New Extension in Nançay Upgrading LoFAR (NenuFAR), Owens Valley Radio Observatory - Long Wavelength Array (OVRO-LWA), low-frequency telescope of the Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO-low), etc. By leveraging the apparent polarization of the unpolarized sky induced by the polarized primary beam of the radio telescope, this method avoids dependence on bright polarized calibrators. It is also immune to ionospheric Faraday rotation. The validation of the approach via MWA observations confirms the accuracy of the method. This formalism provides a robust framework for low-frequency polarization calibration. It addresses the longstanding calibration challenges and advances the field of low-frequency polarimetry by enabling polarization studies of astrophysical radio sources.

 - **Abstract**
 In deep, ground-based imaging, about 15%-30% of object detections are expected to correspond to two or more true objects - these are called ``unrecognized blends''. We use Machine Learning algorithms to detect unrecognized blends in deep ground-based photometry using only catalog-level information: colors, magnitude, and size. We compare the performance of Self Organizing Map, Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbors, and Anomaly Detection algorithms. We test all algorithms on 9-band ($uBVri^{+}z^{++}YJH$) and 1-size (flux_radius in $\textit{i}$-band) measurements of the ground-based COSMOS catalog, and use COSMOS HST data as the truth for unrecognized blend. We find that 17% of objects in the ground-based COSMOS catalog are unrecognized blends. We show that some unrecognized blends can be identified as such using only catalog-level information; but not all blends can be easily identified. Nonetheless, our methods can be used to improve sample purity, and can identify approximately 30% to 80% of unrecognized blends while rejecting 10% to 50% of all detected galaxies (blended or unblended). The results are similar when only optical bands ($uBVri^{+}z^{++}$) and the size information is available. We also investigate the ability of these algorithms to remove photo-z outliers (identified with spectroscopic redshifts), and find that algorithms targeting color outliers perform better than algorithms targeting unrecognized blends. Our method can offer a cleaner galaxy sample with lower blending rates for future cosmological surveys such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), and can potentially improve the accuracy on cosmological parameter constraints at a moderate cost of precision.

 We present the Deep-learning Transient Astronomical Object (Deep-TAO), a dataset of 1,249,079 annotated images from the Catalina Real-time Transient Survey, including 3,807 transient and 12,500 non-transient sequences. Deep-TAO has been curated to provide a clean, open-access, and user-friendly resource for benchmarking deep learning models. Deep-TAO covers transient classes such as blazars, active galactic nuclei, cataclysmic variables, supernovae, and events of indeterminate nature. The dataset is publicly available in FITS format, with Python routines and Jupyter notebooks for easy data manipulation. Using Deep-TAO, a baseline Convolutional Neural Network outperformed traditional random forest classifiers trained on light curves, demonstrating its potential for advancing transient classification.

 Maintaining wavefront stability while directly imaging exoplanets over long exposure times is an ongoing problem in the field of high-contrast imaging. Robust and efficient high-order wavefront sensing and control systems are required for maintaining wavefront stability to counteract mechanical and thermal instabilities. Dark zone maintenance (DZM) has been proposed to address quasi-static optical aberrations and maintain high levels of contrast for coronagraphic space telescopes. To further experimentally test this approach for future missions, such as the Habitable Worlds Observatory, this paper quantifies the differences between the theoretical closed-loop contrast bounds and DZM performance on the High-contrast Imager for Complex Aperture Telescopes(HiCAT) testbed. The quantification of DZM is achieved by traversing important parameters of the system, specifically the total direct photon rate entering the aperture of the instrument, ranging from $1.85 \times 10^6$ to $1.85 \times 10^8$ photons per second, and the wavefront error drift rate, ranging from $\sigma_{drift}$ = 0.3 - 3 $nm/\sqrt{iteration}$, injected via the deformable mirror actuators. This is tested on the HiCAT testbed by injecting random walk drifts using two Boston Micromachines kilo deformable mirrors (DMs). The parameter scan is run on the HiCAT simulator and the HiCAT testbed where the corresponding results are compared to the model-based theoretical contrast bounds to analyze discrepancies. The results indicate an approximate one and a half order of magnitude difference between the theoretical bounds and testbed results.

 - **Abstract**
 We examined dust polarisation within the planetary nebula (PN) K 3-35 using the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA). This investigation aimed to identify and trace the magnetic field within the PN, as it potentially plays a crucial role in shaping this bipolar nebula. Our findings include a marginal detection of the polarised region and low fractional polarisation (peaking at 1.4%). Assuming a certain level of validity, we observed well-organised dust grains aligned along the equatorial plane of the PN, indicating a magnetic field alignment with the outflows. The limited polarisation detection at submillimeter wavelengths in this PN and others may be attributed to a pronounced optical depth. However, our K 3-35 analysis with the code DUSTY does not seem to support this idea. We also modelled the SED of K3-35, and our best-fit models included a mixture of silicates and amorphous carbon. The grains of amorphous carbon are less susceptible to alignment with the magnetic field, which could, at least partially, explain the observed low polarisation. The models presented in this article should be considered preliminary, and a more advanced approach is needed for a more complete interpretation of the results.

 - **Abstract**
 Unstable states of the solar coronal magnetic field structure result in various flare behaviors. In this study, we compared the confined and eruptive flares that occurred under similar magnetic circumstances in the active region 12673, on 2017 September 6, using the twist number, decay index, and height of magnetic field lines to identify observational behaviors of the flare eruption. We investigated the parameters from the magnetic field lines involved in an initial energy release, which were identified from the positions of the core of flare ribbons, i.e., flare kernels. The magnetic field lines were derived by nonlinear force-free field modeling calculated from the photospheric vector magnetic field obtained by the Solar Dynamics Observatory SDO/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager, and flare kernels were identified from the 1600 angstrom data obtained by the SDO/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly. The twist number of all the magnetic field lines in the confined flare was below 0.6; however, the twist number in seven out of twenty-four magnetic field lines in the eruptive flare was greater than 0.6. These lines were tall. It is found that the decay index is not a clear discriminator of the confined and eruptive flares. Our study suggests that some magnetic field lines in the kink instability state may be important for eruptive flares, and that taller magnetic field lines may promote flare eruption.

 - **Abstract**
 There is a candidate electromagnetic counterpart to the binary black hole merger GW190521, identified as ZTF19abanrhr within AGN J124942.3 + 344929. Additionally, GW190514 is proposed as a plausible precursor merger to GW190521 within a hierarchical merger scenario. In this study, we investigate the potential association between GW190514 and GW190521 as a hierarchical triple merger associated with ZTF19abanrhr, taking into account of sky position, distance, and mass of the sources using a Bayesian criterion. Our analysis reveals that the association is favored over a random coincidence, with a log Bayes factor of 16.8, corresponding to an odds ratio of $\sim$$199:1$, assuming an astrophysical prior odds of $10^{-5}$. Notably, when accounting for the primary masses of the two gravitational wave events as potential products of mergers in the AGN formation channel, the Bayes factor increases significantly, further enhancing the preference for this association by a factor of $\sim$$10^2$, corresponding to a log Bayes factor of 21.5 and an odds ratio of $\sim$$2\times10^4:1$. Our results suggest strong evidence for the first hierarchical triple merger associated with an electromagnetic counterpart in the AGN formation channel. This work is crucial for understanding the formation mechanisms of massive black holes, the role of AGNs in hierarchical mergers, and the implications of multi-messenger astronomy.

 - **Abstract**
 Sound speed can be an important tool in unraveling the nature of matter that exists at the cores of neutron stars. In this study, we investigate three major classes of equations of state; monotonous, non-monotonous and discontinuous depending on the nature of the sound speed in neutron stars. The monotonous EoS refers to hadronic models, the non-monotonous refers to the quarkyonic or smooth crossover models and discontinuous refers to discontinuous first-order phase transition models. We generate a large ensemble of EoS for three classes with the model agnostic speed of sound interpolation approach. Our main aim is to check which class of EoS is most favoured by present astrophysical bounds. It is seen that although non-monotonous and discontinuous is favoured thermodynamically, the usual neutron star observations like mass-radius, and f-mode oscillation fail to provide a satisfactory result. The universal relations are also seen to be futile as they show considerable spread and significant overlaps among the different classes. The Bayesian analysis shows slight bias towards the non-monotonous model but fails to provide a decisive answer.

 - **Abstract**
 Three-dimensional special relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations are performed to investigate properties of the downstream turbulence generated by the interaction between a relativistic shock wave and multiple clumps. We analyze the properties of the downstream turbulence by performing the Helmholtz decomposition. It is shown that, in contrast to the non-relativistic shock case, the amplitude of compressive modes is comparable to that of solenoidal modes for the relativistic shock. In addition, many reflected shocks propagate in the downstream region. The strength of the compressive mode, the solenoidal mode, the reflected shock waves, and the amplified magnetic field depend on the amplitude of the upstream density fluctuations. Our simulation results suggest that the wide distribution of the ratio of the magnetic energy to the shock kinetic energy, $\epsilon_B$, in gamma-ray burst afterglows is due to the diversity of the gamma-ray burst environment. Furthermore, the inhomogeneity of density around high-energy astrophysical objects affects the spectrum of accelerated particles because the reflected shock and turbulence can inject and accelerate non-thermal particles in the shock downstream region. The probability distribution of the downstream quantities, power spectra of turbulence, and vortex generation are also analyzed and discussed in this work.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive analysis of the preheating dynamics and associated gravitational wave signatures in the Higgs--$R^2$ inflationary model. Using lattice simulations, we investigate the post-inflationary evolution of the system across the parameter space, covering both the Higgs-like and $R^2$-like scenarios. We demonstrate that the efficiency of preheating is significantly dependent on the nonminimal coupling parameter $\xi$. As the $\xi$ parameter increases, moving from the $R^2$-like regime to the Higgs-like regime, we observe more efficient preheating. Through detailed numerical computations, efficient preheating is shown to lead to stronger gravitational wave production. The amplitude of the gravitational wave spectrum varies by several orders of magnitude as we move from the $R^2$-like regime to the Higgs-like regime. The resultant gravitational wave signatures can serve as a potential observational probe to distinguish between different parameter regimes of the Higgs--$R^2$ model.
#### External tides: an important driver of velocity dispersion in molecular clouds

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.16937

 - **Abstract**
 Using the 3D density distribution derived from the 3D dust map of the solar neighborhood, the gravitational potential is obtained by solving the Poisson equation, from which the tidal tensor is computed. In the optimal decomposition, the external tidal tensor follows the same formalism as that of a point mass. The average tidal strength of the clouds, derived from both tidal tensor analysis and pixel-by-pixel computation, shows consistent results. The equivalent velocity dispersion of the clouds, estimated from the average tidal strength, is comparable in magnitude to the velocity dispersion measured from CO (1-0) line emission. This suggests that tidal effects from surrounding material may play a significant role in driving velocity dispersion within the clouds. Future studies should carefully consider these tidal effects in star-forming regions.

 Weak lensing galaxy surveys are currently undergoing a dramatic revolution as the dawn of the Stage-IV surveys are upon us. Hence, ensuring that our analysis methods are as accurate and precise as the raw data is of upmost importance. This motivated the development of a new implementation of the quadratic maximum likelihood power spectrum estimation technique, the application of the theoretical uncertainties approach to mitigate baryonic feedback biases, and to re-evaluating the criterion from which binary scale cuts are derived when aiming to eliminate baryonic biases. These techniques maximise the available information from weak lensing observations while minimising potential systematic biases, and shows how this PhD thesis contributes to the advancement of weak lensing cosmology.

 - **Abstract**
 Short-period massive binary stars are predicted to undergo chemically homogeneous evolution (CHE), making them prime candidates for producing binary black holes (BBHs) that may merge within the age of the Universe. Most of these binaries have a tertiary companion, and here we explore how a nearby third body possibly influences this evolutionary channel. Our analysis combines analytic treatments of triple dynamics with insights from detailed stellar evolution models, focusing on the role of the von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai mechanism while also accounting for tidal and general relativistic apsidal precession. We examine the dynamics of triples at three critical evolutionary stages: the zero-age main sequence, shortly after the main sequence, and at the time of BBH formation. We find that, for triples having outer orbital periods less than 70 d(120 d), the inner binary can merge during(or after) the main-sequence stage, leading to a hydrogen-rich(helium-rich) stellar merger. If a stellar merger is avoided, the inner binary may eventually form a BBH. In mildly hierarchical triples, with outer periods of around 100 d, the tertiary component can trigger a rapid merger of the BBH on timescales comparable to the outer orbital period. Stellar tides play a crucial role in determining the fate of the inner binary in such tight triple systems, as they can suppress the perturbative effects of the third star. When tidal forces damp the oscillations induced by the tertiary, the BBH merger may occur soon after stellar collapse. Notably, these outcomes are not restricted to CHE binaries but can also apply to any BBH formed from stars in tight orbits. Mergers in these systems are characterized by the proximity of a tertiary companion and the presence of recently ejected gas, making them promising candidates for electromagnetic counterparts and gravitational-wave signals influenced by nearby tertiary objects.

 - **Abstract**
 We present results of numerical relativity simulations of core collapse of rotating magnetized white dwarfs (WDs) in three dimension, aiming at discussing the explosion dynamics and associate multi-messenger signals: gravitational waves (GWs), neutrinos, and electromagnetic counterparts. All WDs initiate gravitational collapse due to electron captures and then experience prompt type explosions after the proto neutron star formation. We observe the explosions dominated by a bipolar structure and the emergence of strong spiral waves in rapidly rotating models. The spiral waves facilitate to increase both the explosion energy and ejecta mass, though the final values still fall in the category of low explosion energy supernovae with small ejecta mass. The spiral waves also produce strong GWs, which may expand the horizon distance of such events against GWs up to $\sim 10$ Mpc for third-generation ground-based detectors. Additionally as an intriguing implication, we demonstrate that such accretion or merger induced collapse of WDs might be able to explain some of the rapidly evolving optical transients, such as fast blue optical transients (FBOTs), as previously suggested. Based on the simulation results together with several assumptions, we confirm that the magnetar may account for the brighter side of observed FBOTs, while a combination of ejecta-envelope interaction which can be also followed by radioactive decay of heavy elements synthesized along with the explosion might still explain the fainter branch even in the absence of magnetar formation.

 - **Abstract**
 We consider stably rotating highly magnetised neutron stars and glitching pulsars. We discuss the prospects for detecting continuous gravitational waves from these sources below 20 Hz with next-generation ground-based facilities such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer and space-based observatories such as DECIGO and Big Bang Observer. We demonstrate that these constitute interesting science targets. We use a robust sensitivity estimation method for future searches based on demonstrated performance. We show that the spin-down upper limit on the gravitational wave amplitude of more than 90% of all highly magnetised pulsars and magnetars suitable for a years-long fully coherent search, exceeds the smallest gravitational wave amplitude estimated detectable with DECIGO and Big Bang Observer. We find that the hidden magnetar candidate PSR J1852+0040 can be detected by Cosmic Explorer if it is emitting at least at 20% of its spin-down luminosity. Finally, post-glitch transient continuous gravitational waves from magnetars are an interesting target for deci-Hz detectors, with all but one of the recorded glitches giving rise to a spin-down limit signal above the smallest detectable level.

 This paper presents the first combined detections of CO$_2$, CO, XCN and water ices beyond the local Universe. We find gas-phase CO in addition to the solid phase CO. Our source, SSTXFLS J172458.3+591545, is a $z=0.494$ star-forming galaxy which also hosts a deeply obscured AGN. The profiles of its ice features are consistent with those of other Galactic and local galaxy sources and the implied ice mantle composition is similar to that of even more obscured sources. The ice features indicate the presence of a compact nucleus in our galaxy and allow us to place constraints on its density and temperature ($n>10^5$cm$^{-3}$ and $T=20-90K$). We infer the visual extinction towards this nucleus to be $A_V\approx6-7$. An observed plot of $\tau_{Si}$ vs. $\tau_{CO2}/\tau_{Si}$ can be viewed as a probe for both the total dustiness of a system as well as the clumpiness of the dust along the line of sight. This paper highlights the potential of using {\sl JWST} MIRI spectra to study the dust composition and geometric distribution of sources beyond the local Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Galactic halos host faint substructures, such as stellar streams and shells, which provide insights into the hierarchical assembly history of galaxies. To date, such features have been identified in external galaxies by visual inspection. However, with the advent of larger and deeper surveys and the associated increase in data volume, this methodology is becoming impractical. Aims. Here we aim to develop an automated method to detect low surface brightness features in galactic stellar halos. Moreover, we seek to quantify its performance when considering progressively more complex data sets, including different stellar disc orientations and redshifts. Methods. We develop the Stream Automatic Detection with Convolutional Neural Networks, SAD-CNN. This tool is trained on mock surface brightness maps obtained from simulations of the Auriga Project. The model incorporates transfer learning, data augmentation and balanced datasets to optimise its detection capabilities at surface brightness limiting magnitudes ranging from 27 to 31 mag arcsec^-2. Results. The iterative training approach, coupled with transfer learning, allowed the model to adapt to increasingly challenging datasets, achieving precision and recall metrics above 80% in all considered scenarios. The use of a well-balanced training dataset is critical for mitigating biases, ensuring that the CNN accurately distinguishes between galaxies with and without streams. Conclusions. SAD-CNN is a reliable and scalable tool for automating the detection of faint substructures in galactic halos. Its adaptability makes it well-suited for future applications, including the analysis of data from upcoming large astronomical surveys (such as LSST, JWT).

 - **Abstract**
 Positive lags between the arrival time of different photon energies are commonly observed in Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), where soft photons lag behind harder ones. However, some GRBs exhibit the opposite behavior. In particular, Fermi LAT observations have revealed that high-energy photons often have a delayed onset. We explore spectral lags as a tool to identify emission components, analyzing Fermi GBM and LAT Low Energy (LLE) data. Using the Discrete Correlation Function method, we compute spectral lags in four energy bands (10 keV-100 MeV) for 70 GRBs from the LLE Catalog. Lags between 10 keV and 1 MeV are mostly positive (76%), possibly due to a hard-to-soft spectral evolution. However, lags between the LLE band (30-100 MeV) and GBM (10-100 keV) vary: 40% are positive, while 37% are negative. These negative lags suggest the delayed emergence of an additional high-energy component. Spectral analysis of 56 GRBs reveals that negative lags correspond to an LLE spectral index harder than the GBM high-energy power law. LLE spectral lags can thus serve as a diagnostic tool to identify and characterize emission components, emphasizing the importance of combining temporal and spectral analyses to better understand GRB emission mechanisms.

 - **Abstract**
 A knowledge of polarization properties of coherent radio waves escaping pulsar polar caps is crucial for calculating radiative transfer through the magnetosphere and for obtaining specific predictions of observable radio properties. We describe the pair cascades in the pulsar polar cap, and for the first time, determine the Stokes parameters of the escaping radio waves from first-principle kinetic simulations for a pulsar with an inclination angle of the magnetic axis 60°. Our model provides a quantitative and qualitative explanation of the observed pulsar radio powers and spectra, the pulse profiles and polarization curves, their temporal variability, the strong Stokes L and weak Stokes V polarization components, as well as the fact that linear polarization decreases with frequency and the non-existence of a radius to frequency relationship. We find that the radio emission from the polar cap can produce a diverse range of observed pulsar properties, including single or double peaked profiles. Most of the Stokes V curves from our simulations appear to be antisymmetric, but symmetric curves are also present at some viewing angles. Although the PA swing of the radiation from the polar cap can be fitted by the rotating vector model (RVM) for most viewing angles, the angles obtained from the RVM do not correspond to the angular distance of the observer from the magnetic axis. Instead, the PA is directly related to the plasma flows in the polar cap and not to the dipole geometry of the magnetic field. The observed range of other polarization features, in addition to our results, can be explained by propagation effects which are not part of the simulation. Our simulations demonstrate that pair discharges determine the majority of its typically observed properties. The usage of RVM for estimations of the magnetic field geometry from observations needs to be reevaluated.

 - **Abstract**
 The derivation of precise stellar ages is considered the current major challenge to reconstruct the chronology of the Milky Way. Color-magnitude diagram (CMD)-fitting offers a robust alternative to individual age determinations via the derivation of dynamically evolved star formation histories (deSFH) and age-metallicity distributions (Gallart et al. 2024). Our new suite of routines, this http URL, specifically developed to analyse Gaia CMDs, produce deSFHs which are robust against sensible changes in the input parameters and extremely precise, providing an unprecedentedly detailed characterization of the successive events of star formation that, since its early evolution, have shaped the current Milky Way. Also important is the fact that, thanks to the high completeness of the Gaia photometric data, this http URL provides the actual number of stars and the mass involved in the different events of star formation. The current analysis of the deSFH for stellar populations within 100 pc of the Sun, as well as for kinematically selected stars in the thin disk, thick disk, and halo, allows us to sketch a tentative picture of Milky Way evolution. The findings indicate that star formation commenced very early in a thick disk, with a small fraction of stars having [M/H]<-0.5 forming more than 12 Gyr ago. This phase culminated in a more prominent 12 Gyr old population with [M/H]~-0.5. Approximately 11 Gyr ago, the merger with GSE triggered an intense burst of star formation, generating most of the thick disk mass and enriching its metallicity to solar levels. Subsequently, the bulk of the star formation in the thin disk started and continues with a somewhat episodic behaviour up to the present time.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic background radiation, both diffuse and discrete in nature, produced at different cosmic epochs before and after recombination, provides key information on the evolution of cosmic structures. We discuss the main classes of sources that contribute to the extragalactic background light from radio to sub-millimetre wavelenghs and the currently open question on the level of the cosmic radio background spectrum. The redshifted 21cm line signal from cosmological neutral Hydrogen during the primeval phases of cosmic structures as a probe of the cosmological reionisation process is presented, along with the route for confident detection of this signal. We then describe the basic formalism and the feasibility to study via a differential approach, based mainly on dipole analysis, the tiny imprints in the CB spectrum expected from a variety of cosmological and astrophysical processes at work during the early phases of cosmic perturbation and structure evolution. Finally, we discuss the identification of high-redshift sub-millimetre lensed galaxies with extreme magnifications in the Planck maps and their use for the comprehension of fundamental processes in early galaxy formation and evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Asteroid (16) Psyche is a metal-rich body that might record an ancient coherent magnetization if some relict crust or mantle is preserved. Herein, we use magnetohydrodynamic simulations to predict (16) Psyche's field, assuming it has such relicts that were magnetized after nebula dispersal via one of two distinct pathways: i. an early solar wind-induced magnetization imparted after a larger body was impacted, forming the present-day asteroid and ii. a core dynamo magnetization imparted in an asteroid that is either presently largely intact or was a rubble pile. For pathway (i) we find the field to be predominantly dipolar and spin axis-aligned. For pathway (ii) we find the field to be either dipolar and spin axis-misaligned, or highly multipolar. Field topology and orientation may thus reveal key details of the nature and history of (16) Psyche, and our framework is broadly applicable to the study of magnetic fields from other asteroids.

 - **Abstract**
 We present new Hubble Space Telescope/Wide Field Camera 3 G141 grism observations for COBRA1411+3415, originally identified as a high-redshift cluster candidate in the Clusters Occupied by Bent Radio AGN (COBRA) survey using radio, infrared, and optical data. We spectroscopically identify seven cluster members within a 0.5 Mpc radius with grism redshifts in the range $1.8006 \leq z_{grism} \leq 1.8175$, consistent with COBRA1411+3415 being a high-redshift cluster with a mean redshift of $\langle z_{grism}\rangle = 1.8106 \pm 0.0006$. The detection of seven galaxies within this small redshift range is significant above the background distribution of galaxies at the level of 5$\sigma$. The line-of-sight velocity dispersion of the cluster is found to be $\sigma_{\parallel} = 701^{+347}_{-138}$ km/s with a virial mass of $M_{200} \approx 2.2^{+3.3}_{-1.3}\times 10^{14}$ M$_{\odot}$. However, the mass may be lower if the cluster is still in formation. In projected phase-space, we also identify two possible infalling members of COBRA1411+3415 and two additional structures at $z\sim 1.73$ and $z\sim 1.88$. The similar spatial distributions and small projected separation from the main cluster suggest they could be a part of the same large-scale filament and together may form a protocluster system that could eventually merge to form a single, massive cluster. COBRA1411+3415 is the highest redshift cluster to be spectroscopically confirmed using a bent, double-lobed radio source as a cluster tracer.

 - **Abstract**
 Hypervelocity stars (HVSs) ejected from the Galactic Center (GC) at speeds faster than the Galactic escape velocity are useful tools to provide insight into the Milky Way's dark matter halo. However, most characterizations of HVS orbits assume static models of the Milky Way's gravitational potential. In this work, we assess the influence of the Galactic bar and the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) on HVS trajectories, comparing them with those from an axisymmetric potential. We simulate 28,000 HVSs ejected over the last 100 Myr and find that ignoring the bar and LMC can cause their apparent ejection location to drift by up to 100 pc. Applying two standard HVS potential fitting methods to our sample shows that they are unable to perform as designed when non-axisymmetric effects are neglected. We calculate the angle between HVS Galactocentric position and velocity and find the LMC and bar can induce a deflection angle of up to several degrees. Using mock Gaia Data Release 4 observations, however, we show that this deflection is too small in magnitude to be measured in the near future without significantly improved observational uncertainties, particularly in heliocentric distance. Our results emphasize the need to account for the bar and LMC in modeling the Galactic potential using HVSs as a tracer.
