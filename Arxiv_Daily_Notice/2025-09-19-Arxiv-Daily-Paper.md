#### Segmentation of the spacecraft transfer problem through overdetermined and continuity constraints based on the Theory of Functional Connections

 - **Abstract**
 This paper introduces a segmented approach for solving constrained orbit transfer problems. The segments are connected through continuity constraints under the Theory of Functional Connections (TFC) mathematical framework that performs linear functional interpolation. This approach is further enhanced by a general vector formulation, from where the constrained functional is derived considering also a set of linear overdetermined constraints. Since we constrain vector instead of coordinates, this methodology allows to apply TFC to multiple and complex constraints composed by any types of nonlinear components included. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method on Earth-to-Moon transfers, showing that this segmented approach achieves solutions with several orders of magnitude greater accuracy and efficiency in comparison with unsegmented orbit transfers.
#### Dichotomy in Long-Lived Radio Emission from Tidal Disruption Events AT 2020zso and AT 2021sdu: Multi-Component Outflows vs. Host Contamination

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed radio study of the tidal disruption events (TDEs) AT 2020zso and AT 2021sdu. Both exhibit transient radio emission beginning shortly after optical discovery and persisting for several years. For AT 2020zso, we identify two distinct radio flares. The first arises soon after the optical peak, reaching a maximum $\sim1$ year post-discovery before fading. The second flare appears $\sim800$ days after discovery and results in the brief presence of two distinct components in the radio spectra, providing strong evidence for physically separate outflows. Both flares are consistent with non-relativistic outflows, with velocities $v\approx0.1-0.2c$ and energies $E\sim10^{49}$ erg, propagating through a Bondi-like circumnuclear medium. Our analysis supports a scenario in which the first outflow is accretion-driven, launched while the TDE disk is accreting at a relatively high Eddington fraction, whereas the second outflow is associated with a transition to an advection-dominated accretion flow. In contrast, the radio emission from AT 2021sdu is best explained by a slower ($v\approx0.03c$), less energetic outflow ($E\sim10^{48}$ erg), combined with diffuse, non-variable host emission that becomes dominant $\sim500$ days after discovery. Assuming free expansion, we infer an outflow launch date preceding the optical discovery date. This suggests that the outflow may originate from either the unbound stellar debris ejected during disruption or, alternatively, from a decelerating outflow. Our findings demonstrate the diversity of outflow properties in TDEs and highlight the observational challenges of interpreting late-time radio variability in the presence of host galaxy contamination.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic rays (CRs), from active galactic nuclei (AGN) jets and supernovae (SNe), serve as a significant feedback mechanism influencing emission lines in narrow line region (NLR) clouds. These highly energetic particles, propelled by shocks, heat the interstellar medium (ISM) and modify its chemical composition. This study investigates the role of CRs, particularly in their ability to excite gas and align with observed line ratios across UV and optical diagnostics. We employ CLOUDY to explore CR ionization rate, ionization parameter, and initial hydrogen density effects on optical and mid-infrared (MIR) emission. Our analysis includes high-quality optical data from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) for NGC 5728, supplemented by infrared observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Our previous results indicate that CRs are instrumental in heating the inner regions of gas clouds, enhancing emission of low-ionization optical lines. Mid-infrared data reveal that emission lines like [Ar II] and [Ne II] within the JWST Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) field of view are sensitive to CRs. In contrast, high-ionization lines (for example, [Ne V]) serve as robust tracers of photoionization insensitive to CRs. Moreover, mixed optical and MIR diagnostics offer insight into the relative roles of CRs and shocks, which often produce similar signatures in emission lines. We find that while both mechanisms can elevate certain line ratios, their influence on MIR diagnostics diverges: shocks and CRs affect low-ionization lines differently, allowing for a better understanding when multi-wavelength data are available. Our approach not only helps to resolve the degeneracy between metallicity and CR ionization but also enables the potential differentiation of shocks and CR-driven processes in AGN.

 - **Abstract**
 The radio-frequency emissions produced by particle showers on Earth, resulting from cosmic rays (CRs) and ultra-high energy neutrinos (UHE-$\nu$) originating from astrophysical sources share significant similarities, enabling radio detectors initially designed for UHE-$\nu$ searches to also study CRs. The Askaryan Radio Array (ARA), an experiment currently operating within the ice at the South Pole, is primarily designed to detect UHE-$\nu$s. To date, ARA has deployed five stations, with each station equipped with antennas installed at depths up to 200 meters in the ice. Data recorded by ARA Station-2 (A2) suggest a potential CR origin for a subset of events identified in a UHE-$\nu$ search. This subset includes a double-pulse event potentially from a downward propagating CR-induced air shower, with in-air geomagnetic emission followed by in-ice Askaryan emission producing the two pulses. A detailed investigation of this CR candidate event using comprehensive simulations has been conducted with the goal of identifying the parameters of a CR-induced air shower that best match the experimentally observed quantities. We simulate predicted CR signals in ARA by combining an impacting CR shower simulation framework (FAERIE) with a realistic detector simulation (AraSim). We determine the event topology based on the vertex reconstruction of both the putative geomagnetic and Askaryan signals. After inferring the event geometry, we show that the simulation matches the observed time structure of the event (channel-by-channel relative signal arrival times) for the recorded event.

 - **Abstract**
 Deep JWST imaging of the massive galaxy cluster MACS0417.5-1154, at redshift z=0.443, reveals a huge population of globular clusters (GCs) and Ultra-Compact Dwarfs (UCDs) primarily distributed around its single central giant galaxy (BCG). We present NIRCam/SWC photometry of the GC system in four bands (F090W, F115W, F150W, F200W). The spatial distribution of the system matches well in radial and ellipticity profile with the high elongation (b/a = 0.5) of the BCG halo light. The total GC population within MACS0417 is estimated to be near 1.5 x 10^5, similar to the systems in Abell 2744, Coma, and other galaxy clusters with comparable masses. With similar results for GC photometry in hand from other lensing clusters at a range of redshifts, it is now possible to trace on purely observational grounds the luminosity evolution of GC systems over many Gigayears of lookback time, as seen through their color-magnitude diagrams. We show this sequence for five systems reaching to lookback times of more than 7 Gyr. A systematic change in the GC/UCD sequence with lookback time is clearly visible, near what is expected for age-fading of a simple stellar population with time. Lastly, we evaluate the effectiveness of the various JWST NIRCam filters for broadband photometry of GC systems as a function of redshift, as an aid to planning further studies.
#### Dynamical Mechanism of Episodic Gas Accretion to the Central Region of Spiral Galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 We performed \textit{N}-body/SPH simulations of isolated spiral galaxies with various bulge-to-disk mass ratios ($M_{\rm bulge}/M_{\rm disk}$) from 0.02 to 0.2 to investigate mass transport from galactic scales (10 kpc) down to circumnuclear disk scales ($\lesssim$ 100 pc). Our analysis revealed these main findings, (1) Gravitational torque from stellar spiral arms causes gas accretion with $\sim1$ $M_\odot$ ${\rm yr}^{-1}$ along the gas spiral arms from a few kpc to a few 100 pc scale. The density of accreting gas is a few 100 ${\rm cm^{-3}}$, comparable to the gas arms. The pressure gradient force is over an order of magnitude weaker than the stellar gravitational torque. (2) Gravitational torque from barred structure causes episodic gas clump accretion with $\sim1$ $M_\odot$ ${\rm yr}^{-1}$ on timescales of 10 Myr from kpc to a few 100 pc scale. The densities of these clumps exceed 700 ${\rm cm^{-3}}$, and this accretion occurs along elliptical orbits with a delayed phase relative to the bar potential \citep{wada1994}. (3) Episodic gas clumpy accretion is important for galactic center instability, confirmed by $M_{\rm bulge}/M_{\rm disk}$ = 0.02 but not by $M_{\rm bulge}/M_{\rm disk}$ = 0.1 and 0.2. This difference occurs because in the bulge-dominated potentials, bar instability is suppressed, and rapid gas clumps accretion does not occur. These findings suggest that gas clump accretion events driven by bars could be a source of high-density gas to the galactic center of the spiral galaxy, potentially promoting temporary activity in the galactic center.

 - **Abstract**
 Accretion discs in strong gravity ubiquitously produce winds, seen as blueshifted absorption lines in the X-ray band of both stellar mass X-ray binaries (black holes and neutron stars), and supermassive black holes. Some of the most powerful winds (termed Eddington winds) are expected to arise from systems where radiation pressure is sufficient to unbind material from the inner disc ($L\gtrsim L_{\rm Edd}$). These winds should be extremely fast and carry a large amount of kinetic power, which, when associated with supermassive black holes, would make them a prime contender for the feedback mechanism linking the growth of those black holes with their host galaxies. Here we show the XRISM Resolve spectrum of the Galactic neutron star X-ray binary, GX 13+1, which reveals one of the densest winds ever seen in absorption lines. This Compton-thick wind significantly attenuates the flux, making it appear faint, although it is intrinsically more luminous than usual ($L\gtrsim L_{\rm Edd}$). However, the wind is extremely slow, more consistent with the predictions of thermal-radiative winds launched by X-ray irradiation of the outer disc, than with the expected Eddington wind driven by radiation pressure from the inner disc. This puts new constraints on the origin of winds from bright accretion flows in binaries, but also highlights the very different origin required for the ultrafast ($v\sim 0.3c$) winds seen in recent Resolve observations of a supermassive black hole at similarly high Eddington ratio.
#### The effect of collisional cooling of energetic electrons on radio emission from the centrifugal magnetospheres of magnetic hot stars

 - **Abstract**
 This paper extends our previous study of gyro-emission by energetic electrons in the magnetospheres of rapidly rotating, magnetic massive stars, through a quantitative analysis of the role of Coulomb collisions with thermal electrons from stellar wind material trapped within the centrifugal magnetosphere (CM). For a dipolar field with aligned magnetic and rotational axes, we show that both gyro-cooling along magnetic loops and Coulomb cooling in the CM layer have nearly the same dependence on the magnitude and radial variation of magnetic field, implying that their ratio is a global parameter that is largely independent of the field. Analytic analysis shows that, for electrons introduced near the CM layer around a magnetic loop apex, collisional cooling is more important for electrons with high pitch angle, while more field-aligned electrons cool by gyro-emission near their mirror point close to the loop base. Numerical models that assume a gyrotropic initial deposition with a gaussian distribution in both radius and loop co-latitude show the residual gyro-emission is generally strongest near the loop base, with highly relativistic electrons suffering much lower collisional losses than lower-energy electrons that are only mildly relativistic. Finally, we briefly discuss the potential applicability of this formalism to magnetic ultracool dwarfs, for which VLBI observations indicate incoherent radio emission to be concentrated around the magnetic equator, in contrast to our predictions here for magnetic hot stars. We suggest that this difference could be attributed to either a lower ambient density of thermal electrons, or more highly relativistic non-thermal electrons, both of which would reduce the relative importance of the collisional cooling explored here.
#### The Stochastic Dissipation Model for the Steady State Neutrino and Multi-Wavelength Emission of TXS 0506+056

 - **Abstract**
 The blazar TXS 0506+056 has been suggested to be a potential high-energy neutrino source thanks to the observations of IceCube, which found outburst-like neutrino emissions during 2014-2015 and 2017 in the transient emission search, and a $3.5\sigma$ local significance in a 10-year time-integrated search. The conventional one-zone jet model cannot explain the observed neutrino flux during outbursts due to the constraint from the X-ray flux, leading to proposals of multi-zone models (e.g. two-zone model) with multiple radiation zones. In literature, it has been shown that multi-zone models may consistently explain the high-state neutrino emission and the multi-wavelength emission of TXS 0506+056, while the quasi-steady-state long-term emission has not been well studied. In this work, we investigate a physically based model for the quasi-steady-state neutrino and electromagnetic radiation under the same framework, and successfully reproduce the multi-messenger emission of TXS 0506+056.

 - **Abstract**
 Relatively blue light extends beyond a spiral disk from a radius of ~5 kpc out to ~14 kpc from the center of NGC 1275. Analyses of its spectrum and broadband colors reveal a population of young stars having sub-solar metallicities superposed on a dominant population of old stars having super-solar metallicities. The young stars have a characteristic age of ~160 Myr and may span ages of a few hundred Myr, similar to that of stars comprising the central spiral disk, and a total mass about one-third that of this disk for a combined stellar mass (at birth) of ~4 $\times$ 10$^9$ $\rm M_\odot$. A multitude of arc-like features embedded in the extended blue light have brightnesses comparable to the somewhat older (~500 Myr) super star clusters (SSCs) projected against the central spiral disk. The SSCs have a relatively shallow mass function, suggesting that the tidal disruption of an initially larger population that we estimate could have had an initial total mass (far) exceeding ~1 $\times$ 10$^9$ $\rm M_\odot$ gave rise to the extended blue light -- the arc-like features corresponding to stellar streams tracing disrupted star clusters -- and perhaps also the central spiral disk. We speculate that, beginning about 500 Myr ago, an enhanced episode of AGN activity in NGC 1275, leaving still visible X-ray bubbles, induced vigorous cooling of the intracluster medium to fuel the formation of numerous star clusters: many were tidally disrupted to leave bluish light at the inner region of this galaxy, with the survivors being the SSCs projected against the central spiral disk.

 - **Abstract**
 Interstellar dust plays a central role in the evolution of galaxies by shaping star formation, altering observed stellar properties, and redistributing radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum. In the Milky Way, dust is concentrated in the Galactic disk and often associated with large-scale structures such as spiral arms and molecular clouds. Here we present a detailed analysis of the vertical distribution and substructure of interstellar dust using a sample of approximately 23 million stars from literature with high-precision extinction measurements. We derive three-dimensional dust density profiles along various sightlines and fit vertical dust distributions using both single and double exponential disk models across 12 Galactocentric radial bins from $\sim$6 to $\sim$12\,kpc. We show that a two-component disk model--comprising a ``thin'' and a ``thick'' dust disk--provides a better fit to the vertical dust profile than a single exponential disk, as indicated by Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) comparisons. The thin and thick disks have average scale heights of $81.0 \pm 6.7$\,pc and $152.0 \pm 7.0$\,pc, respectively. Our results also identify significant dust substructures, which align well with known spiral arms, molecular clouds, and star-forming regions.

 - **Abstract**
 Population III (or Pop. III) stars, the first stellar generation built up from metal-free primordial gas, first started to form at redshifts z ~ 30. They formed primarily in small dark matter halos with masses of a few million solar masses. The cooling of the gas in these halos was dominated on all scales by molecular hydrogen. Current theoretical models indicate that Pop. III stars typically formed in small clusters with a logarithmically flat mass function due to widespread fragmentation in the protostellar accretion disks around these primordial stars. Massive Pop. III stars are thought to have played a pivotal role in shaping the early Universe, as their feedback regulates subsequent star formation, although the immediate effects of this feedback remain uncertain. Direct detection of Pop. III stars is challenging, but our chances of detecting at least a few Pop. III supernovae within the next decade are brighter. Indirect approaches based on stellar archaeology or gravitational wave detections offer promising constraints. Current observations suggest that most massive Pop. III stars ended their lives as core-collapse supernovae rather than pair-instability supernovae, offering insight into the initial mass function and evolutionary pathways of these primordial stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) can have multiple consequences on very-high energy gamma rays' emission, propagation, and detection, such as energy-dependent photon group velocity, photon instability, vacuum birefringence, and modified electromagnetic interaction. Depending on the underlying theoretical model, several of these effects can coexist. Nevertheless, in experimental tests of LIV, each effect is tested separately and independently. Here, we are performing a search for traces of several coexisting effects in a single analysis. We present our analysis method based on artificial neural networks and put our very first results in the context of experimental searches for LIV.
#### Magnetic activity and differential rotation of HIP12653

 - **Abstract**
 We present a spectroscopic and photometric study of HIP12653 to investigate its magnetic cycle and differential rotation. Using HARPS archival spectra matched with MARCS-AMBER theoretical templates, we derive the stellar parameters (Teff, logg, FeH, and vsini) of the target. The S-index, an activity indicator based on the emission of the CaII H&K lines, is fitted to determine the magnetic cycle and rotation periods. We refine the magnetic cycle period to 5799.20 \pm 0.88 d and suggest the existence of a secondary, shorter cycle of 674.6922 \pm 0.0098 d, making HIP12653 the youngest star known to exhibit such a short activity cycle. During the minimum activity phase, a rotation period of 4.8 d is estimated. This is notably different from the 7-day period obtained when measurements during minimum activity are excluded, suggesting that these two periods are rotation periods at different latitudes. To explore this hypothesis, we introduce a novel light curve fitting method that incorporates multiple harmonics to model different spot configurations. Applied to synthetic light curves, the method recovers at least two rotation periods close to the true input values in 92.1% of cases. The inferred rotation shear shows a median deviation of 0.0011 \pm 0.0003 and a standard deviation of 0.0177 \pm 0.0002 from the true value. Applying this approach to TESS photometric data from 2018 to 2023, we detect three distinct rotation periods, 4.8 d, 5.7 d, and 7.7 d, (along with a signal at 3.75 d interpreted as its first harmonic), consistent with spots located at different latitudes. Assuming a solar-like differential rotation, we estimate an inclination of 34.0 \pm 1.8^\circ and a rotational shear of \alpha = 0.38 \pm 0.01. These results confirm the 4.8-d period and demonstrate that differential rotation can be constrained by tracking rotation period changes across different phases of the magnetic cycle.

 - **Abstract**
 Globular clusters (GCs) are dense star clusters found in all massive galaxies. Recent work has established that they follow a tight relation between their internal stellar velocity dispersion $\sigma$ and luminosity, enabling accurate distance measurements. In this work, we aim to apply this GC velocity dispersion (GCVD) distance method to measure the distance to M 104 (NGC 4594, the Sombrero galaxy). We have measured internal stellar velocity dispersions for 85 globular clusters (GCs) and one ultra-compact dwarf galaxy around M 104 using high-resolution multi-object integrated-light spectroscopy with FLAMES/GIRAFFE on the Very Large Telescope. The measured velocity dispersions range from $\sigma = 4 - 30$ km s$^{-1}$, with a mean uncertainty of $\Delta\sigma = 2.5$ km s$^{-1}$. For a subset of 77 GCs with $V$-band magnitudes and reliable velocity dispersion measurements above $\sigma > 4$ km s$^{-1}$, we constructed the $M_V$-$\sigma$ relation to measure the distance to M 104, finding $D=9.00\pm0.29$ (stat.) $\pm0.26$ (sys.) Mpc. The GCs follow the Milky Way and M 31 $M_V-\sigma$ relation closely, with the exception of the luminous ultra-compact dwarf SUCD1, which is nearly one magnitude brighter than the mean relation. 29 GCs in the sample have sizes determined from Hubble Space Telescope imaging which allowed us to determine their masses and $V$-band dynamical mass-to-light ratios (M/L$_V$). We find a mean $<M/L_V> = 2.6 \pm 0.8 M_{\odot}/L_{\odot}$ for the luminous ($M_V < -8$ mag) M 104 GCs, which is higher than the Milky Way GCs, but is reminiscent of the brightest GCs in Centaurus A. With the exception of SUCD1, the GCs of M 104 follow the GCVD relation irrespective of their mass-to-light ratio.

 - **Abstract**
 The Pierre Auger Observatory has recently undergone a major upgrade, called AugerPrime, tailored to answer the current most pressing questions in the ultra-high-energy cosmic ray (UHECR) detection. The AugerPrime upgrade consists of the addition, on top of each station, of a scintillator detector, to separate the muonic and electromagnetic component of the shower for better primary identification, and of a radio detector to measure the emission of air showers in 30-80 MHz range. An additional small diameter photomultiplier is installed in each station to increase the dynamic range for signal detection. New electronic modules, installed on all stations, provide a sufficient number of channels for the readout of the additional detectors, as well as faster sampling, increased dynamic range and processing capability. In this contribution we summarize the performance of the new electronic modules with respect to the requirements, describe the verification procedure and give the results in the laboratory tests compared to the performance in the field.

 - **Abstract**
 Claims of anisotropy in the Hubble constant have been made based on direct distance tracers such as Tully-Fisher galaxies and Type Ia supernovae. We revisit these using the CosmicFlows-4 Tully-Fisher W1 subsample, 2MTF and SFI++ Tully-Fisher catalogues, and the Pantheon+ supernova compilation (restricted to $z < 0.05$), including a dipole in either the Tully-Fisher zero-point or the standardised supernova absolute magnitude. Our forward-modelling framework jointly calibrates the distance relation, marginalises over distances, and accounts for peculiar velocities using a linear-theory reconstruction. We compare the anisotropic and isotropic model using the Bayesian evidence. In the CosmicFlows-4 sample, we infer a zero-point dipole of amplitude $0.087 \pm 0.019$ mag, or $4.1\pm0.9$ per cent when expressed as a dipole in the Hubble parameter. This is consistent with previous estimates but at higher significance: model comparison yields odds of $877\!:\!1$ in favour of including the zero-point dipole. In Pantheon+ we infer zero-point dipole amplitude of $0.049 \pm 0.013$ mag, or $2.3\pm 0.6$ per cent when expressed as a dipole in the Hubble parameter. However, by allowing for a radially varying velocity dipole, we show that the anisotropic model captures local flow features (or possibly systematics) in the data rather than an actual linearly growing effective bulk flow caused by anisotropy in the zero-point or expansion rate. Inferring a more general bulk flow curve we find results fully consistent with expectations from the standard cosmological model.

 - **Abstract**
 Double-source-plane strong gravitational lenses (DSPLs), with two sources at different redshifts, are independent cosmological probes of the dark energy equation of state parameter $w$ and the matter density parameter $\Omega_{\rm m}$. We present the lens model for the DSPL AGEL035346$-$170639 and infer cosmological constraints from this system for flat $\Lambda$CDM and flat $w$CDM cosmologies. From the joint posterior of $w$ and $\Omega_{\rm m}$ in the flat $w$CDM cosmology, we extract the following median values and 1$\sigma$ uncertainties: $w = -1.52^{+0.49}_{-0.33}$ and $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.192^{+0.305}_{-0.131}$ from AGEL0353 alone. Combining our measurements with two previously analyzed DSPLs, we present the joint constraint on these parameters from a sample of three, the largest galaxy-scale DSPL sample used for cosmological measurement to date. The combined precision of $w$ from three DSPLs is higher by 15% over AGEL0353 alone. Combining DSPL and cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements improves the precision of $w$ from CMB-only constraints by 39%, demonstrating the complementarity of DSPLs with the CMB. Despite their promising constraining power, DSPLs are limited by sample size, with only a handful discovered so far. Although ongoing and near-future wide-area sky surveys will increase the number of known DSPLs by up to two orders of magnitude, these systems will still require dedicated high-resolution imaging and spectroscopic follow-ups like those presented in this paper. Our ASTRO 3D Galaxy Evolution with Lenses (AGEL) collaboration is undertaking such follow-up campaigns for several newly discovered DSPLs and will provide cosmological measurements from larger samples of DSPLs in the future.

 - **Abstract**
 Reliable estimation of stellar surface gravity (log $g$) for a large sample is crucial for evaluating stellar evolution models and understanding galactic structure; However, it is not easy to accomplish due to the difficulty in gathering a large spectroscopic data set. Photometric sky survey using a specific filter, on the other hand, can play a substantial role in the assessment of log $g$. The Stellar Abundances and Galactic Evolution Survey (SAGES) utilizes eight filters to provide accurate stellar parameters for $\sim10^{7}$ stars, with its DDO51 intermediate-band filter specifically designed for robust log $g$ determination. In this work, the observed SAGES $u_{\rm SC}$ and $v_{\rm SAGES}$ photometry, the synthetic photometry in $g$, $r$, $i$, and DDO51 bands derived from \textit{Gaia} XP spectra are employed to investigate the importance of the DDO51 filter in the determination of log $g$. We applied machine-learning-based extinction correction and employed XGBoost models, trained on stellar parameters from LAMOST, to predict log $g$ using photometric data. By comparing model predicted log $g$ with LAMOST values, we find that including DDO51 filter improve the accuracies of log $g$ estimates by 21.0\% (from 0.224\,dex to 0.177\,dex) overall, and by 26.5\% (from 0.302\,dex to 0.222\,dex ) for GK-type stars, as compared to those obtained without DDO51. The DDO51 filter is also validated to be particularly effective for metal-poor stars ([Fe/H]$<$-1.0), where it significantly mitigates systematic biases. Our findings highlight the diagnostic power of the SAGES DDO51 filter, providing enhanced stellar characterization vital for future in-depth studies of the Milky Way.

 - **Abstract**
 Complex organic molecules (COMs) are thought to be the precursors of pre-biotic molecules and are observed in many protostellar sources. For this paper we studied the formation of COMs during star formation and their evolution in the midplane of the circumstellar disk up to the end of the Class I stage. We used the Analytical Protostellar Environment (APE) code to perform analytical simulations of star formation and the Nautilus code to model the chemical evolution. Most COMs mainly form during the collapse or in the disk, except the lightest (CH3CCH, C3H6, CH3OH, CH3CHO, CH3OCH3, C2H5OH, CH3CN, CH3NC, C2H3CN, and CH3SH), which are significantly inherited by the disk from the prestellar phase. Over the first 150 kyr of the disk, the abundances of several COMs in the midplane vary negligibly (e.g., CH3CCH, CH3OH, and CH3CN), while others experience a variation of one order of magnitude (e.g., C2H3CHO HOCH2CHO, and CH3COCH2OH). Changing physical conditions also have an impact on the abundance profiles of COMs in the disk, and their inheritance. For example, increasing the temperature of the molecular cloud from 10 K to 15 K significantly promotes the formation of COMs in the prestellar phase, notably c-C2H4O and N-bearing species. Conversely, increasing the cloud mass from 2 Msol to 5 Msol only has a minor effect on the disk abundances in the early stages.
#### Influence of the Spectral Energy Distribution of Reionization-Era Sources on the Lyman-$α$ Forest

 - **Abstract**
 Interpreting Lyman-$\alpha$ forest properties during the epoch of reionization requires assumptions about the spectral energy distribution (SED) of ionizing sources. These are often simplified to blackbody or power-law spectra, potentially overlooking contributions from high-energy processes. In this work, we investigate how different SED models of reionization-era sources shape the thermal and ionization state of the intergalactic medium (IGM) and imprint on the Ly$\alpha$ forest during the late stages of reionization. We perform $3D$ radiative transfer simulations with CRASH, post-processed on Sherwood-type hydrodynamical outputs, exploring both physically motivated SEDs including X-ray binaries, Bremsstrahlung from shock-heated interstellar medium, and binary stars and idealized blackbody and power-law spectra. While the large-scale morphology of ionized regions is broadly similar across all models, harder spectral components extend partially ionized zones, produce larger He III regions, and heat the surrounding IGM. By adopting simplified spectra there is the risk of underestimating the contribution of high-energy sources, which subtly alter the effective optical depth, the flux power, and the local transmissivity, potentially biasing constraints on the thermal and ionization history of the IGM. The differences across models are most pronounced in the behavior of the proximity zone and in the power at intermediate scales, offering the most promising diagnostics to disentangle source populations. With upcoming high precision measurements from ELT and DESI, realistic SED modelling will be essential for robustly connecting Ly$\alpha$ forest observations to the sources driving the end of reionization.
