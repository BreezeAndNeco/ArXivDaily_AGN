 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the dynamical behavior of strange quark matter (SQM) objects, such as stars and planets, when subjected to radial oscillations induced by tidal interactions in stellar systems. Our study demonstrates that SQM objects can efficiently convert mechanical energy into hadronic energy due to the critical mass density at their surfaces of 4.7*10^{14} g/cm^3, below which SQM becomes unstable and decays into photons, hadrons, and leptons. We show that even small-amplitude radial oscillations, with a radius change of as little as 0.1%, can result in significant excitation energies near the surface of SQM stars. This excitation energy is rapidly converted into electromagnetic energy over short timescales approximately 1 ms, potentially leading to observable astrophysical phenomena. Higher amplitude oscillations may cause fragmentation or dissolution of SQM stars, which has important implications for the evolution of binary systems containing SQM objects and the emission of gravitational waves.

 - **Abstract**
 We present 1,800 multiwavelength Type Ib/c supernovae light curve models obtained by running the radiation transport code Sedona and varying the mass distribution, velocity profile, and abundance ejecta profiles of helium star progenitors. To create a flexible but physically-informed grid, we use autoencoders to construct a representation of ejecta profiles derived from stellar evolution models. We present simulated nearest-neighbor multiband light curves matches to SN 1994I, SN 2007gr, and iPTF13bvn to demonstrate that realistic light curves can be generated in our grid. We show that the ejecta velocity distribution, in particular, strongly influences the light curve, while variation in Ni-56 alone has a limited impact on the bolometric light curve, even in extreme and unphysical mixing schemes; however, mixing can modestly impact color evolution. Finally, we show that the Ni-56 mass, ejecta mass, and both the magnitude and structure of ejecta velocity distribution can be inferred from the multiband light curves, enabling improved inference over widely used semianalytical models.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the propagation of cosmic rays (CRs) through a simulation of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence at unprecedented resolution of $10{,}240^3$. We drive turbulence that is subsonic and super-Alfvénic, characterized by $\delta B_{\rm rms}/B_0=2$. The high resolution enables an extended inertial range such that the Alfvén scale $l_A$, where $\delta B (l_A)\approx B_0$, is well resolved. This allows us to properly capture how the cascade transitions from large amplitudes on large scales to small amplitudes on small scales. We find that sharp bends in the magnetic field are key mediators of particle transport even on small scales via resonant curvature scattering. We further find that particle scattering in the turbulence shows strong hints of self-similarity: (1) the diffusion has weak energy dependence over almost two decades in particle energy and (2) the particles' random walk exhibits a broad power-law distribution of collision times such that the diffusion is dominated by the rarest, long-distance excursions. Our results suggest that large-amplitude MHD turbulence can provide efficient scattering over a wide range of CR energies and may help explain many CR observations above a $\sim$TeV: the flattening of the B/C spectrum, the hardening of CR primary spectra and the weak dependence of arrival anisotropy on CR energy.
#### The Discovery of Little Red Dots in the Local Universe: Signatures of Cool Gas Envelopes

 - **Abstract**
 JWST observations have revealed a population of high-redshift "little red dots" (LRDs) that challenge conventional AGN models. We report the discovery of three local LRDs at $z = 0.1-0.2$, initially selected from the SDSS database, with follow-up optical/near-IR spectroscopy and photometry. They exhibit properties fully consistent with those of high-redshift LRDs, including broad hydrogen and helium emission lines, compact morphologies, V-shaped UV-optical SED, declining near-IR continua, and no significant variability. Two sources were targeted but not detected in X-rays with statistical significance. All three sources show blue-shifted He I absorption, while two exhibit H$\alpha$ and Na D absorption lines. We detect full Balmer and Paschen line series in all three objects, along with abundant narrow [Fe II] emission in two. The emission line analyses suggest narrow lines originate from AGN-powered metal-poor regions with minimal dust; broad lines come from inner regions with exceptionally high density or atypical dust properties; and [Fe II] emission arises from dense gas between broad and narrow-line regions. One of our objects, J1025+1402 (nicknamed "The Egg"), shows extremely high equivalent width Na D, K I, Fe II, and Ca II triplet absorption lines, suggesting the presence of a cool ($\sim$5000 K), metal-enriched gas envelope. The optical/near-IR continua of these LRDs are also consistent with theoretical models featuring an atmosphere around black holes. The WISE-detected IR emission is consistent with weak dust emission of $T \sim 10^2-10^3$ K. We propose a conceptual model consisting of a largely thermalized cool-gas envelope surrounding the central black hole and an extended emission line region with high-density outflowing gas to explain the observed properties of these local LRDs.
#### WISDOM Project -- XXV. Improving the CO-dynamical supermassive black hole mass measurement in the galaxy NGC 1574 using high spatial resolution ALMA observations

 - **Abstract**
 We present a molecular gas dynamical supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass measurement in the nearby barred lenticular galaxy NGC 1574, using Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array observations of the $^{12}$CO(2-1) emission line with synthesised beam full-widths at half-maximum of $0.''078\times0.''070$ ($\approx7.5\times6.7$ pc$^2$). The observations are the first to spatially resolve the SMBH's sphere of influence (SoI), resulting in an unambiguous detection of the Keplerian velocity increase due to the SMBH towards the centre of the gas disc. We also detect a previously known large-scale kinematic twist of the CO velocity map, due to a position angle (PA) warp and possible mild non-circular motions, and we resolve a PA warp within the central $0.''2\times0.''2$ of the galaxy, larger than that inferred from previous intermediate-resolution data. By forward modelling the data cube, we infer a SMBH mass of $(6.2\pm1.2)\times10^7$ M$_\odot$ ($1\sigma$ confidence interval), slightly smaller than but statistically consistent with the SMBH mass derived from the previous intermediate-resolution data that did not resolve the SoI, and slightly outside the $1\sigma$ scatter of the SMBH mass -- stellar velocity dispersion relation. Our measurement thus emphasises the importance of observations that spatially resolve the SMBH SoI for accurate SMBH mass measurements and gas dynamical modelling.
#### Machine-learning inference of stellar properties using integrated photometric and spectroscopic data

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar astrophysics relies on diverse observational modalities-primarily photometric light curves and spectroscopic data-from which fundamental stellar properties are inferred. While machine learning (ML) has advanced analysis within individual modalities, the complementary information encoded across modalities remains largely underexploited. We present DESA (Dual Embedding model for Stellar Astrophysics), a novel multi-modal foundation model that integrates light curves and spectra to learn a unified, physically meaningful latent space for stars. DESA first trains separate modality-specific encoders using a hybrid supervised/self-supervised scheme, and then aligns them through DualFormer, a transformer-based cross-modal integration module tailored for astrophysical data. DualFormer combines cross- and self-attention, a novel dual-projection alignment loss, and a projection-space eigendecomposition that yields physically structured embeddings. We demonstrate that DESA significantly outperforms leading unimodal and self-supervised baselines across a range of tasks. In zero- and few-shot settings, DESA's learned representations recover stellar color-magnitude and Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams with high fidelity ($R^2 = 0.92$ for photometric regressions). In full fine-tuning, DESA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for binary star detection (AUC = $0.99$, AP = $1.00$) and stellar age prediction (RMSE = $0.94$ Gyr). As a compelling case, DESA naturally separates synchronized binaries from young stars, two populations with nearly identical light curves, purely from their embedded positions in UMAP space, without requiring external kinematic or luminosity information. DESA thus offers a powerful new framework for multimodal, data-driven stellar population analysis, enabling both accurate prediction and novel discovery.
#### Roles of SN and AGN Feedback in Shaping the Baryonic Content in a Wide Range of Dark Matter Halo Mass

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.10673

 - **Abstract**
 We build upon FEGA25 (Contini et al 2025), a previously introduced semi-analytic model for galaxy formation and evolution, focusing on its enhanced treatment of supernova and active galactic nucleus feedback mechanisms. In addition to the traditional AGN feedback modes, negative (suppressing cooling), and the new positive mode (triggering star formation), we introduce two implementations of a third mode: the ejection of hot gas beyond the virial radius, AGNeject1 and AGNeject2. This component addresses a longstanding issue in semi-analytic models and hydrodynamical simulations: the overestimation of hot gas fractions in low and intermediate mass halos. FEGA25 is calibrated via MCMC using a suite of cosmological N-body simulations YS50HR, YS200, and YS300, and a comprehensive set of observed stellar mass functions across a wide redshift range. We find that supernova feedback dominates gas ejection in halos with logM_{halo} < approximately 12, while AGN feedback becomes increasingly important at higher halo masses. The AGNeject2 model, which activates primarily at late times, redshift < 1, reproduces a characteristic cavity, a U shaped feature in the baryon fraction at redshift zero, similar to trends observed in simulations like SIMBA and IllustrisTNG. Conversely, AGNeject1 yields a smoother, redshift independent evolution. Both models preserve the stellar and cold gas components and successfully reproduce the stellar to halo mass relation up to redshift 3. Our results emphasize that a physically motivated AGN driven mechanism capable of selectively removing hot gas is essential to accurately model the baryon cycle, particularly in intermediate halo mass regimes.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed analysis of the most luminous and obscured Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) detected in the ultra-hard X-ray band (14-195 keV) by Swift/BAT. Our sample comprises 21 X-ray luminous (log $L_X/{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}>44.6$, 2-10 keV) AGNs at $z<0.6$, optically classified as Seyfert 1.9-2. Using NuSTAR, XMM-Newton, Suzaku, and Chandra, we constrain AGN properties such as absorption column density $N_H$, photon index $\Gamma$, intrinsic $L_X$, covering factor, and iron K$\alpha$ equivalent width. For sources with black hole mass estimates (12/20), we find a weak correlation between $\Gamma$ and Eddington ratio ($\lambda_{Edd}$). Of these, six ($50\pm13\%$) lie in the $N_H$-$\lambda_{Edd}$ "forbidden region'' and exhibit a combined higher prevalence of $N_H$ variability and outflow signatures, suggesting a transitional phase where AGN feedback may be clearing the obscuring material. For the 13/21 sources with multi-epoch X-ray spectra, $82^{+6}_{-16}\%$ exhibit variability in either 2-10 keV flux ($73^{+9}_{-16}\%$) or line-of-sight $N_H$ ($33^{+15}_{-10}\%$). For the 20/21 sources with available near-UV/optical spectroscopy, we detect [NeV]$\lambda$3426 in 17 ($85^{+5}_{-11}\%$), confirming its reliability to probe AGN emission even in heavily obscured systems. When normalized to the same [OIII]$\lambda$5007 peak flux as $z = 2$-$9$ narrow-line AGNs identified with JWST, our sample exhibits significantly stronger [NeV]$\lambda$3426 emission, suggesting that high-redshift obscured AGNs may be intrinsically weaker in [NeV]$\lambda$3426 or that [NeV]$\lambda$3426 is more challenging to detect in those environments. The sources presented here serve as a benchmark for high-redshift analogs, showing the potential of [NeV]$\lambda$3426 to reveal obscured AGNs and the need for future missions to expand X-ray studies into the high-redshift Universe.
#### Structural evolution of quiescent galaxies at intermediate redshift at UV and red rest-frame wavelengths

 - **Abstract**
 We model the wavelength dependence of structural parameters for a mass-limited sample ($M_\star>10^{10}M_\odot$) of $\sim27,000$ quiescent galaxies with $0.2 < z < 0.6$ using $grizy$ photometry from Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam and dense spectroscopy from the HectoMAP survey. Based on Sérsic profile fits in all five bands, we estimate the circularized half-light radius $R_{e,c}$ and Sérsic index $n$ in two rest-frames: UV (3500 Å) and red (7000 Å). Combined with $M_\star$, $z$, and D$_n4000$, $R_{e,c}$ and $n$ enable exploration of the evolution in the structural properties - stellar mass correlations for quiescent galaxies with different stellar population ages. At intermediate redshift, quiescent galaxies at all stellar masses show a systematic decline in $R_{e,c}$ and rise in $n$ with rest-frame wavelength. These structural variations are stronger for galaxies that recently joined the quiescent population (newcomers) than for the descendants of galaxies that are already quiescent at the survey limit, $z \sim 0.6$ (aging population). The combined evidence supports inside-out quenching as the dominant mechanism halting star formation during this epoch. The typical size of a $M_\star\sim10^{11}M_\odot$ quiescent galaxy increases by $\sim30\%$ between $z \sim 0.6$ and $z \sim 0.2$ in the red and remains constant in the UV; newcomers are $\sim20\%$ larger than the aging population. In the UV, quiescent galaxies maintain a constant $n\sim4$ for the aging population and $n\sim2$ for newcomers; in the red, both subpopulations have de Vaucouleurs profiles. Our findings link newcomers to their direct progenitors in the star-forming population. For the aging population, we suggest minor mergers with progressively redder satellites at lower redshifts as the primary driver of quiescent galaxy evolution. Forthcoming sensitive large-area imaging surveys will allow testing this prediction.
#### Insights for Early Massive Black Hole Growth from JWST Detection of the [Ne v] λ3427 Emission Line

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.10681

 - **Abstract**
 We use the narrow [Ne v] $\lambda$3427 emission line detected in the recently published JWST spectra of two galaxies, at z = 6.9 and 5.6, to study the key properties of the active galactic nuclei (AGN) and the supermassive black holes in their centers. Using a new empirical scaling linking the [Ne v] line emission with AGN accretion-driven (continuum) emission, derived from a highly complete low-redshift AGN sample, we show that the [Ne v] emission in the two z > 5 galaxies implies total (bolometric) AGN luminosities of order L_bol~(4-8)x10^45 erg/s. Assuming that the radiation emitted from these systems is Eddington limited, the (minimal) black hole masses are of order M_BH>10^7 M_sun. Combined with the published stellar masses of the galaxies, estimated from dedicated fitting of their spectral energy distributions, the implied BH-to-stellar mass ratios are of order M_BH/M_host~0.1-1. This is considerably higher than what is found in the local Universe, but is consistent with the general trend seen in some other z > 5 AGN. Given the intrinsic weakness of the [Ne v] line and the nature of the [Ne v]-to-L_bol scaling, any (rare) detection of the [Ne v] $\lambda$3427 line at z > 5 would translate to similarly high AGN luminosities and SMBH masses, thus providing a unique observational path for studying luminous AGN well into the epoch of reionization, including obscured sources.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations have unveiled a population of pulsars with spin periods of a few minutes to hours that lie beyond the traditional ``death line.'' If they originate from neutron stars (NSs), the existence of such ultra-long period pulsars (ULPs) challenges our current understanding of NS evolution and emission. In this work, we propose a new channel for disk formation based on NSs born in close binaries with main-sequence companion stars. Using a hydrodynamic simulation of supernova-companion interactions, we show that a newborn NS may gravitationally capture gas as it moves through the complex density field shaped by the explosion. For a binary separation of $20\rm~R_\odot$ and a companion mass of $4\rm~M_\odot$, we find the occurrence fraction for disk formation around unbound NSs to be $\sim10\%$. By modeling the disk evolution and its interaction with the NS, we find a bimodal distribution in spin periods: canonical pulsars with $P\lesssim10\rm\,s$ are the ones who lack disks or whose magnetospheres never interacted with the disk, and ULPs with $10^3\lesssim P<10^5\rm\,s$ are produced when the system undergoes a short-lived ``propeller'' phase during which the NS undergoes rapid spin-down. Such ULPs are formed under strong initial dipolar magnetic field strengths $B_0\gtrsim10^{14}\rm\,G$, with a formation rate of $10^{-4}\rm\,yr^{-1}$ in the Milky Way. We also find that a small population of pulsars with moderate magnetic field strengths ($10^{13}\lesssim~B_0\lesssim10^{14}\rm\,G$) and relatively slow initial periods ($P_0\gtrsim0.1\rm\,s$) evolve to $P\sim10^2\rm\,s$, filling the gap between the bimodal distribution. Thus, our model provides a unified explanation for pulsars beyond the ``death line.''
#### Fine-structure Line Atlas for Multi-wavelength Extragalactic Study (FLAMES) I: Comprehensive Low and High Redshift Catalogs and Empirical Relations for Probing Gas Conditions

 - **Abstract**
 Far-infrared (FIR) and mid-infrared (MIR) fine-structure lines (FSLs) are widely used for studying galaxies nearby and faraway. However, interpreting these lines is complicated by factors including sample and data bias, mismatch between resolved calibrations and unresolved observations, limitations in generalizing from case studies, and unresolved issues like the origin of [C II] emission and the so-called ``deficit.''In this series of papers, we assemble and analyze the most comprehensive atlas of FSL data to date. We explore their empirical correlations (paper I), compare them with photoionization models that cover multiphase gas (paper II), and discuss their physical origins and the new perspectives they offer for studying physical properties (paper III). The first paper introduces value-added catalogs of global FSL data of low- and high-z galaxies compiled from the literature, covering most of the existing observations, supplemented with ancillary ultraviolet to FIR information. Our analysis focus on commonly used diagnostics, such as electron density, radiation field strength, metallicity, and electron temperature. We present their distributions across different galaxy samples and redshifts, and cross-validate the reliability of these diagnostics in measuring physical conditions. By examining empirical relations, we identify the contribution of active galactic nuclei (AGN) to the FIR FSLs [O III]88 and [O I]63, and reveal a bias in density measurements. FIR FSLs show good concordance with their optical counterparts. Our findings indicate that variations in FSL ratios are primarily driven by the relative abundances of emitting ions, underscoring their value as tracers of metallicity and radiation field strength. Finally, we compare the FIR FSL properties of low- and high-z galaxies, discussing both their similarities and differences.

 - **Abstract**
 Detection of extensive air showers with radio antennas is an appealing technique in cosmic ray physics. However, because of the high level of measurement noise, current reconstruction methods still leave room for improvement. Furthermore, reconstruction efforts typically focus only on a single aspect of the signal, such as the energy fluence or arrival time. Bayesian inference is then a natural choice for a holistic approach to reconstruction, yet, this problem would be ill-posed, since the electric field is a continuous quantity. Information Field Theory provides the solution for this by providing a statistical framework to deal with discretised fields in the continuum limit. We are currently developing models for this novel approach to reconstructing extensive air showers. The model described here is based on the best current understanding of the emission mechanisms: It uses parametrisations of the lateral signal strength distribution, charge-excess contribution and spectral shape. Shower-to-shower fluctuations and narrowband RFI are modelled using Gaussian processes. Combined with a detailed detector description, this model can infer not only the electric field, but also the shower geometry, electromagnetic energy and position of shower maximum. Another big achievement of this approach is its ability to naturally provide uncertainties for the reconstruction, which has been shown to be difficult in more traditional methods. With such an open framework and robust computational methods based in Information Field Theory, it will also be easy to incorporate new insights and additional data, such as timing distributions or particle detector data, in the future. This approach has a high potential to exploit the full information content of a complex detector with rigorous statistical methods, in a way that directly includes domain knowledge.

 - **Abstract**
 Scaling relations with the bag constant parameter are investigated for Strange Quark Matter (SQM) stars in the presence of gravitationally strong magnetic fields minimally coupled with matter, considering both massless and massive strange quark scenarios. Assuming a simple model for such coupling under the approximation of spherical symmetry, a phenomenological scaling formula for the maximum mass of stars is derived as a function of the surface magnetic field and the strange quark mass. This formula is applicable for all formally admissible values of the free parameters, and strict scaling with the bag constant is retained only for a vanishing strange quark mass. As a byproduct of this study, the mathematical structure of the equation of state for the relativistic SQM model with a massive strange quark is revisited without approximations. It is observed that the contribution of the electron term to the energy density cannot be neglected in the theoretical limit of large strange quark masses. Consequently, the maximum mass of SQM stars increases with sufficiently large strange quark mass, contrasting with the behavior observed for low strange quark masses.
#### Impact of Cosmic Ray-driven Outflows on Lyman-$α$ Emission in Cosmological Simulations

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic ray (CR) feedback has been proposed as a powerful mechanism for driving warm gas outflows in galaxies. We use cosmological magnetohydrodynamic simulations to investigate the impact of CR feedback on neutral hydrogen (HI) in a $10^{11}\,M_\odot$ dark matter halo at $2<z<4$. To this end, we post-process the simulations with ionizing radiative transfer and perform Monte Carlo Lyman-$\alpha$ (Lya) transfer calculations. CR feedback reduces HI column densities around young stars, thereby allowing more Lya photons to escape and consequently offering a better match to the Lya luminosities of observed Lya emitters. Although galaxies with CR-driven outflows have more extended HI in the circumgalactic medium, two Lya line properties sensitive to optical depth and gas kinematics - the location of the red peak in velocity space ($v_\mathrm{red}$) and relative strength of the blue-to-red peaks ($B/R$) - cannot distinguish between the CR-driven and non-CR simulations. This is because Lya photons propagate preferentially along low HI density channels created by the ionizing radiation, thereby limiting the scattering with volume-filling HI. In contrast, the observed low flux ratios between the valley and peak and the surface brightness profiles are better reproduced in the model with CR-driven outflows because the Lya photons interact more before escaping, rather than being destroyed by dust as is the case in the non-CR simulation. We discuss the potential cause of the paucity of sightlines in simulations that exhibit prominent red peaks and large $v_\mathrm{red}$, which may require the presence of more volume-filling HI.

 We fit the cosmic-ray spectrum measured with the Pierre Auger Observatory's surface detectors above an energy of $10^{17}$ eV, along with composition information inferred from the depth of shower maximum measured with its fluorescence detectors above an energy threshold of $10^{17.8}$ eV. We consider astrophysical scenarios with two distinct extragalactic source populations: one dominating the flux above a few EeV, and the other dominating at lower energies, with representative nuclei being injected at the sources with power-law spectra and rigidity-dependent cutoffs. The high-energy population exhibits a hard source injection spectrum and a relatively heavy composition, while the low-energy population exhibits a softer spectrum and a lighter composition. Extending the fit down to the low energies considered here shows the potential to test the energy region towards the Galactic to extragalactic transition with the data of the Pierre Auger Observatory. In particular, the Galactic contribution is expected to be still sizable at the lowest energies considered, and the extragalactic contribution needs to become suppressed for decreasing energies, an effect that could naturally result from a magnetic-horizon-induced suppression.

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most luminous astrophysical transients, known to be associated with core collapse of massive stars or mergers of two compact objects such as two neutron stars. They are followed by multi-wavelength afterglow emission originating from the deceleration of the relativistic jets by the ambient medium. The study of after emission offers crucial insights into the physics of relativistic shocks, the properties of the circumburst environment, as well as the physical and geometrical structure of relativistic jets, as well as the viewing geometry of the observer. We present VegasAfterglow, a newly developed, high-performance C++ framework designed for modeling GRB afterglows with flexibility and computational efficiency as keynotes of design. The framework self-consistently solves forward and reverse shock dynamics and calculates synchrotron (including self-absorption or all spectral regimes) and inverse Compton radiation (including Klein-Nishina corrections); it can handle arbitrary user-defined ambient density profiles, central engine activity histories, viewing angles, and the jet structures of energy, Lorentz factor, and magnetization profiles. It supports both relativistic and non-relativistic regimes and includes lateral jet spreading effects. In this paper, we describe the numerical implementation of the framework and assess its computational performance. Our results demonstrate that VegasAfterglow is well-suited for interpreting current and future multi-wavelength observations in the era of multi-messenger astronomy.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations and theoretical simulations suggest that the large scale environment plays a significant role in how galaxies form and evolve and, in particular, whether and when galaxies host an actively accreting supermassive black hole in their center (i.e., an Active Galactic Nucleus, or AGN). One signature of AGN activity is luminosity variability, which appears in the mid-infrared (mid-IR) when circumnuclear dust reprocesses UV and optical photons from the AGN accretion disk. We present here a suite of constraints on the fraction of AGN activity in the most underdense regions of the universe (cosmic voids) relative to the rest of the universe (cosmic walls) by using ~12 years of combined multi-epoch data from AllWISE and NEOWISE to quantify mid-IR variability. We find clear evidence for a larger mid-IR variability-AGN fraction among high and moderate-luminosity void galaxies compared to their wall counterparts. We also show that mid-IR variability identifies a rather large and unique population of AGNs, the majority of which have eluded detection using more traditional AGN-selection methods such as single-epoch mid-IR color selection. The fraction of these newly-recovered AGNs is larger among galaxies in voids, suggesting once again more prolific AGN activity in the most underdense large scale structures of the universe.

 - **Abstract**
 We couple a simplified model for the galactic chemical evolution, with software that models the condensation of dust in protoplanetary disks and software that models the interior structure of planets in order to estimate the effects that the galactic chemical evolution has on the properties of planets as they form over time. We find that the early abundance of elements formed from the evolution and death of high-mass stars (such as Oxygen, Silicon, and Magnesium) yields planets with larger mantles and smaller cores. The later addition of elements produced in low-mass stars (such as Iron and Nickel) causes the planet cores to become relatively larger. The result is planets that orbit older stars are less dense than planets orbiting younger stars. These results are broadly consistent with recent observations of planet properties from stars of varying ages.

 - **Abstract**
 The Ly$\alpha$ Tomography IMACS Survey (LATIS) has produced large 3D maps of the intergalactic medium (IGM), providing a new window on the cosmic web at $z\sim2.5$. A key advantage of Ly$\alpha$ tomography is that it enables the discovery of overdense regions without the need to detect their galaxy members in spectroscopic surveys, circumventing possible selection biases. We use these maps to identify 37 IGM-selected overdensities as regions of strong and spatially coherent Ly$\alpha$ absorption. Simulations indicate that 85% of these are protoclusters, defined as the progenitors of $z=0$ halos with mass $M_{\rm desc} > 10^{14} M_{\odot}$, and that nearly all of the rest are protogroups ($10^{13.5} < M_{\rm desc} / M_{\odot} < 10^{14}$). We estimate the masses and space densities of the IGM-selected overdensities and show they are in accordance with mock surveys. We investigate the LATIS counterparts of some previously reported protoclusters, including the proto-supercluster Hyperion. We identify a new component of Hyperion beyond its previously known extent. We show that the Ly$\alpha$ transmission of the galaxy density peaks within Hyperion is consistent with a simple physical model (the fluctuating Gunn-Peterson approximation), suggesting that active galactic nucleus feedback or other processes have not affected the large-scale gas ionization within this structure as whole. The LATIS catalog represents an order-of-magnitude increase in the number of IGM-selected protogroups and protoclusters and will enable new investigations of the connections between galaxies and their large-scale environments at cosmic noon.

 - **Abstract**
 The physical mechanisms that regulate the collapse of high-mass parsec-scale clumps and allow them to form clusters of new stars represent a crucial aspect of star formation. To investigate these mechanisms, we developed the Rosetta Stone project: an end-to-end (simulations-observations) framework that is based on the systematic production of realistic synthetic observations of clump fragmentation and their comparison with real data. In this work, we compare ALMA 1.3mm continuum dust emission observations from the SQUALO survey with a new set of 24 radiative magnetohydrodynamical simulations of high-mass clump fragmentation, post-processed using the CASA software to mimic the observing strategy of SQUALO. The simulations were initialized combining typical values of clump mass (500,1000 solar masses) and radius (~0.4pc) with two levels of turbulence (Mach number of 7,10) and three levels of magnetization (mass-to-flux ratio of ~3,10,100). Following the clump evolution over time with two random seeds projected along three orthogonal directions, we produced a collection of 732 synthetic fields. The synthetic observations of clump fragmentation at ~7000AU revealed between 2 and 14 fragments per field. Among the initial conditions of the simulations, magnetic fields have the largest impact on the fragment multiplicity at these scales. In advanced stages of clump evolution, a lower number of fragments is preferentially associated with magnetized clumps. Fragments identified at ~7000AU correspond to individual or multiple sink particles in ~75% of the cases, suggesting that not all fragments are actively forming stars. Both sinks and fragments accrete mass throughout the whole clump evolution, favoring a scenario in which fragments are not isolated from the environment. Our study demonstrates the importance of synthetic observations in interpreting results from interferometric observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Young, solar-like stars in the pre-main sequence (PMS) stage exhibit vigorous magnetic activity that significantly influences their circumstellar environments and the processes of planetary formation and evolution. In binary systems, tidal forces and magnetic interactions can further shape the magnetic geometry. We report a longitudinal preference of star spots, chromospheric activities, and flares in the active single-lined spectroscopic PMS binary system V2279 Cyg, based on long-term photometric observations from \textit{Kepler} and \textit{TESS} alongside spectroscopic data from LAMOST. The system is classified as a weak-line T Tauri binary, with component masses estimated at 0.86 $M_\odot$ and 0.27 $M_\odot$. V2279 Cyg's nearly circular orbit is synchronized with its 4.126-day rotational period. Observations reveal large star spot regions clustered near the far-side hemisphere. Spectroscopic data show strong, double-peak H$\alpha$ emission, the strength of which is highly correlated with star spot distribution, indicating the presence of an active longitude on the primary star. We also mapped the prominence structure co-rotating with the primary star, suggesting a dense structure close to the near-side hemisphere. Furthermore, we identify an inactive longitude of flares during the 4-year \textit{Kepler} observations, where the frequency of flare activity is significantly reduced after the superior conjunction, marking the first such identification in active binary systems. Additionally, a white light superflare, releasing energy of $2.5 \times 10^{37}$ erg, was detected in \textit{TESS} observations. These findings provide valuable insights into the magnetic field geometry and dynamo processes in PMS binaries, underscoring the critical role of tidal interactions in shaping magnetic activities.

 - **Abstract**
 The Near-Infrared Spectrometer and Photometer (NISP) onboard Euclid includes several optical elements in its path, which introduce artefacts into the data from non-nominal light paths. To ensure uncontaminated source photometry, these artefacts must be accurately accounted for. This paper focuses on two specific optical features in NISP's photometric data (NISP-P): ghosts caused by the telescope's dichroic beamsplitter, and the bandpass filters within the NISP fore-optics. Both ghost types exhibit a characteristic morphology and are offset from the originating stars. The offsets are well modelled using 2D polynomials, with only stars brighter than approximately 10 magnitudes in each filter producing significant ghost contributions. The masking radii for these ghosts depend on both the source-star brightness and the filter wavelength, ranging from 20 to 40 pixels. We present the final relations and models used in the near-infrared (NIR) data pipeline to mask these ghosts for Euclid's Quick Data Release (Q1).

 - **Abstract**
 Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are a class of X-ray repeating burst phenomena discovered in recent years. Many models have been proposed to study this phenomenon, there remains significant debate regarding the physical origin of QPEs. In our previous work, we developed a disk instability model with a large-scale magnetic field and successfully reproduced the light curves and spectral characteristics of several QPE sources. We further investigate the model in this work, aiming to explain two key observational features: the dispersion in eruption periods and the peak temperatures during eruptions. The model reveals critical thresholds ($\dot{M}_{\rm crit}$, $\beta_{1,\rm crit}$) that separate systems into stable regimes with minimal period variations and unstable regimes where periods are highly sensitive to accretion rate and magnetic field parameter, while peak temperatures remain nearly constant across the parameter space. This framework successfully explains both the regular eruptions observed in sources like GSN 069 and the stochastic behavior in sources like eRO-QPE1, and simultaneously accounting for the observed temperature stability during long-term QPEs evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 A newly born millisecond magnetar has been proposed as one possible central engine of some gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with X-ray plateau emission. In this work, we systematically analyzed the \emph{Swift}/XRT data of long GRBs with plateau emission that were detected before 2023 December, and estimated the magnetar parameters by considering the $R/I$ evolutionary effects, and investigated possible relationships among these parameters and their relation to the GRB jet and magnetar wind radiation. We found that neglecting the evolutionary effects of $R/I$ can lead to systematic overestimation or underestimation of magnetar parameters such as magnetic field strength ($B_p$), spin period ($P_0$), and ellipticity ($\epsilon$) from 20% to 50%. We also found that some tight correlations among different magnetar parameters, as well as between the GRB jet emission and the magnetar wind emission for our selected Equation of states (EoSs). The universal correlations suggest that a nascent magnetar with the faster $P_0$, lower $B_p$, and lower $\epsilon$ are more inclined to power more energetic GRB jet, and the ellipticity deformation and initial spin period of newborn magnetar are likely to originate from the magnetically-induced distortion and correspond to the equilibrium spin period as a result of interaction between the magnetar and its accretion disk, respectively. Finally, we found that the GW signals from the remnants of those GW-dominated GRBs with redshift measurements cannot reach aLIGO sensitivity threshold, and only two cases (GRBs 150323A and 170607A) can reach ET sensitivity threshold. Future GW observations could not only offer the first smoking gun that a protomagnetar can serve as the central engine of GRBs, but could also play a crucial role in precisely constraining the neutron EoS.

 HF QPOs are among the most intriguing phenomena observed in LMXBs containing BHs or neutron stars. In this work, we investigate charged particles' dynamics in the nearby of a Schwarzschild-like BH embedded in a uniform magnetic field and surrounded on all sides by CDM. Thereby gaining deeper insight into the influence of magnetic and DM distributions on observable phenomena near compact objects. We first present a modified metric, which incorporates the effects of a CDM ... We compute the fundamental oscillation frequencies-radial, latitudinal, Keplerian, and Larmor-and demonstrate how their variation depends on the combined influence of CDM and magnetic field strength. The resulting frequency structure allows us to identify resonance radii associated with HF QPOs, particularly those in 3:2 ratios observed in microquasars. We assess several theoretical models for QPO generation, including the (ER), Relativistic Precession (RP), Tidal Disruption (TD), and Warped Disk (WD) models. A comparative fit of observational data from GRS 1915+105, H1743-322, XTE 1550-564, and GRO 1655-40 demonstrate that the TD and WD models provide the best match for HF QPOs in the presence of moderate magnetic flux ($B' = 0.1$), while the other models except ER fit better in weak-field scenarios. Our results highlight the importance of including both magnetic and dark matter (DM) effects in strong-field astrophysics and support the use of HF QPOs as sensitive probes of BH environments. This study opens new perspectives for exploring particle dynamics, accretion disk structure ...

 - **Abstract**
 In the framework of exploiting Very High Energy (VHE) gamma-ray observations of extragalactic sources to infer constraints on the intensity of cosmological background radiations, as well as on deviations from the standard model of particles and physical interactions (like violations of Lorentz invariance and axion-like particles -- LIV and ALPs), we discuss here possible contaminant effects due to the presence of radiations fields from local sources. We specifically model and analyze the foreground radiations produced inside the host galaxy of the VHE source and the cosmic environment itself hosting the source, as well as radiations produced in the Milky Way, along the VHE source's observational line-of-sights. Our analysis shows that such contaminant foregrounds may indeed impact on observations of only the very local Active Galactic Nuclei (e.g. Centaurus A), but not significantly those in the Virgo cluster (M87) and beyond.

 - **Abstract**
 The black hole X-ray binary MAXI J1820$+$070 began its first recorded outburst in March 2018, and remained an active radio, X-ray, and optical source for over four years. Due to the low distance to the source and its intrinsically high luminosity MAXI J1820$+$070 was observed extensively over this time period, resulting in high-cadence and quasi-simultaneous observations across the electromagnetic spectrum. These data sets provide the opportunity to probe the connection between accretion and the launch of jets in greater detail than for the majority of black hole X-ray binaries. In this work we present radio (Arcminute Microkelvin Imager Large Array, MeerKAT), X-ray (Swift), and optical (Las Cumbres Observatory) observations of MAXI J1820$+$070 throughout its entire outburst, including its initial hard state, subsequent soft state, and further hard-state-only re-brightenings (covering March 2018 to August 2022). Due to the regularity and temporal density of our observational data we are able to create a Radio - X-ray - Optical activity plane where we find a high degree of correlation between the three wave bands during the hard states, and observe hysteresis as MAXI J1820$+$070 enters and exits the soft state. Based on the morphology of the optical light curves we see evidence for optical jet contributions during the soft-to-hard state transition, as well as fading optical emission well before the hard to soft transition. We establish that the remarkably similar profiles of the re-brightening events are broadly consistent with modified disk instability models where irradiation from the inner accretion disk is included.

 - **Abstract**
 Witness reports of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) occasionally associate UAP sightings with local electromagnetic interferences, such as spinning magnetic compasses onboard aircraft or sudden malfunctions of mechanical vehicles. These reports have motivated the incorporation of a magnetometer into the instrumentation suite of the Galileo Project (GP), a Harvard-led scientific collaboration whose aim is to collect and analyze multi-sensor data that collectively could help elucidate the nature of UAP. The goal of the GP magnetometry investigation is to identify magnetic anomalies that cannot be readily explained in terms of a natural or human-made origin, and analyze these jointly with the data collected from the other modalities. These include an ensemble of visible and infrared cameras, a broadband acoustic system and a weather-monitoring system. Here, we present GP's first geomagnetic variometer station, deployed at the GP observatory in Colorado, USA. We describe the calibration and deployment of the instrumentation, which consists of a vector magnetometer and its data acquisition system, and the collection and processing of the data. Moreover, we present and discuss examples of the magnetic field data obtained over a period of 6 months, including data recorded during the May 2024 G5 extreme geomagnetic storm. We find that the data meet and even surpass the requirements laid out in GP's Science Traceability Matrix. Key to the evaluation of our data is the proximity of the variometer station to the USGS magnetic observatory in Boulder, Colorado. By comparing the two sets of data, we find that they are of similar quality. Having established the proper functioning of the first GP variometer station, we will use it as the model for variometer stations at future GP observatories.

 Aims. Quasar catalogues from narrow-band photometric data are used in a variety of applications, including targeting for spectroscopic follow-up, measurements of supermassive black hole masses, or Baryon Acoustic Oscillations. Here, we present the final quasar catalogue, including redshift estimates, from the miniJPAS Data Release constructed using several flavours of machine-learning algorithms. Methods. In this work, we use a machine learning algorithm to classify quasars, optimally combining the output of 8 individual algorithms. We assess the relative importance of the different classifiers. We include results from 3 different redshift estimators to also provide improved photometric redshifts. We compare our final catalogue against both simulated data and real spectroscopic data. Our main comparison metric is the $f_1$ score, which balances the catalogue purity and completeness. Results. We evaluate the performance of the combined algorithm using synthetic data. In this scenario, the combined algorithm outperforms the rest of the codes, reaching $f_1=0.88$ and $f_1=0.79$ for high- and low-z quasars (with $z\geq2.1$ and $z<2.1$, respectively) down to magnitude $r=23.5$. We further evaluate its performance against real spectroscopic data, finding different performances. We conclude that our simulated data is not realistic enough and that a new version of the mocks would improve the performance. Our redshift estimates on mocks suggest a typical uncertainty of $\sigma_{\rm NMAD} =0.11$, which, according to our results with real data, could be significantly smaller (as low as $\sigma_{\rm NMAD}=0.02$). We note that the data sample is still not large enough for a full statistical consideration.

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray binaries present emission that is variable and can reach UHE. The processes behind the acceleration of the particles that produce this very energetic radiation are yet to be understood. We probe the properties of the particle accelerator and the UHE photon emitter in the gamma-ray binary LS 5039. From the properties of the binary system and the UHE radiation detected by HAWC, we used analytical tools to investigate how these properties constrain the emission and acceleration regions, namely the role of synchrotron losses, particle confinement, and the accelerated particle spectrum, and propose an acceleration scenario that can relax the derived constraints. The modest target densities for hadronic processes and the overall gamma-ray orbital variability favor inverse Compton scattering of ultraviolet photons from the massive companion star by highly relativistic electrons. The acceleration of the highest energy electrons implies a constraint on synchrotron cooling in the acceleration region, which can set an upper limit on its magnetic field. Moreover, the detected variability requires very strong particle confinement in both the acceleration and emission regions, which sets a lower limit on their magnetic fields that is barely consistent with the synchrotron cooling constraint from acceleration. Synchrotron losses may be higher in the emitting region if it is separated from the accelerator, but this requires a very hard particle injection spectrum. A scenario for LS 5039 of the kind proposed by Derishev and collaborators, in which an ultrarelativistic magnetized outflow accelerates leptons injected within the outflow by gammagamma absorption, provides a viable mechanism to accelerate very energetic electrons. This mechanism relaxes the acceleration and confinement requirements by reducing the impact of synchrotron cooling, and can generate the required particle spectrum.

 - **Abstract**
 We present direct measurements of the intrinsic alignments (IA) of over 2 million spectroscopic galaxies using DESI Data Release 1 and imaging from four lensing surveys: DES, HSC, KiDS, and SDSS. In this uniquely data-rich regime, we take initial steps towards a more tailored IA modelling approach by building a library of IA measurements across colour, luminosity, stellar mass, and redshift. We map the dependence between galaxy type -- in terms of rest-frame colour, strength of the 4000 Angstrom break, and specific star formation rate -- and IA amplitude; the bluest galaxies have an alignment consistent with zero, across low (0.05<z<0.5) and high (0.8<z<1.55) redshifts. In order to construct cosmic shear samples that are minimally impacted by IA but maintain maximum sample size and statistical power, we map the dependence of alignment with colour purity. Red, quenched galaxies are strongly aligned and the amplitude of the signal increases with luminosity, which is tightly correlated with stellar mass in our catalogues. For DESI galaxies between 0<z<1.5, trends in luminosity and colour alone are sufficient to explain the alignments we measure -- with no need for an explicit redshift dependence. In a companion paper (Jeffrey et al., in prep), we perform detailed modelling of the IA signals with significant detections, including model comparison. Finally, to direct efforts for future IA measurements, we juxtapose the colour-magnitude-redshift coverage of existing IA measurements against modern and future lensing surveys.
