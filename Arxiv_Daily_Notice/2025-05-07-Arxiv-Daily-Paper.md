#### Magnetic field amplification during a turbulent collapse

 - **Abstract**
 The question of whether a dynamo can be triggered by gravitational collapse is of great interest, especially for the early Universe. Here, we employ supercomoving coordinates to study the magnetic field amplification from decaying turbulence during gravitational collapse. We perform three-dimensional simulations and show that for large magnetic Reynolds numbers, there can be exponential growth of the comoving magnetic field with conformal time before the decay of turbulence impedes further amplification. The collapse dynamics only affects the nonlinear feedback from the Lorentz force, which diminishes more rapidly for shorter collapse times, allowing nearly kinematic continued growth. We also confirm that helical turbulence is more efficient in driving dynamo action than nonhelical turbulence, but this difference decreases for larger collapse times. We also show that for nearly irrotational flows, dynamo amplification is still possible, but it is always associated with a growth of vorticity -- even if it still remains very small. In nonmagnetic runs, the growth of vorticity is associated with viscosity and grows with the Mach number. In the presence of magnetic fields, vorticity emerges from the curl of the Lorentz force.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a spectroscopic search for broad H$\alpha$ emitters at z~3.7-6.5 in the GOODS-N field, utilizing JWST/NIRCam slitless spectroscopy from FRESCO and CONGRESS, complemented by JADES imaging. We identify 19 broad H$\alpha$ emitters with FWHM > 1000 km/s at z~4-5.5, including 9 new sources. The black hole masses and AGN bolometric luminosities, inferred from the broad H$\alpha$ components, indicate that most sources are accreting at ~10% of the Eddington limit. We derive their host stellar masses via SED fitting and find higher $M_{BH}/M_{*}$ ratios relative to the local $M_{BH}$-$M_{*}$ relations, consistent with previous studies. We find that 42% of the sample do not satisfy the widely-used color selection criteria for Little Red Dots (LRDs), with the majority of these sources lacking the characteristic steep red slope. A comparison of the average SEDs between our sample and LRDs selected in the same field reveals that the steep red slopes observed in some LRDs are likely due to line-boosting effects as previously suggested. Furthermore, we find that 68% of color-selected LRDs with H$\alpha$ detections in the NIRCam/Grism spectra do not exhibit broad-line features. While the limited sensitivity of the grism spectra may hinder the detection of broad-line components in faint sources, our findings still highlight the enigmatic nature of the LRD population.
#### The Large-scale Environments of Low-luminosity AGNs at $3.9 < z < 6$ and Implications for Their Host Dark Matter Halos from a Complete NIRCam Grism Redshift Survey

 - **Abstract**
 We study the large-scale environments and clustering properties of 28 low-luminosity AGNs at $z=3.9-6$ in the GOODS-N field. Our sample, identified from the JWST NIRCam Imaging and WFSS data in CONGRESS and FRESCO surveys with either broad H$\alpha$ emission lines or V-shape continua, are compared to 782 H$\alpha$ emitters (HAEs) selected from the same data. These AGNs are located in diverse large-scale environments and do not preferentially reside in denser environments compared to HAEs. Their overdensity field, $\delta$, averaged over (15 $h^{-1}$cMpc)$^3$, ranges from $-0.56$ to 10.56, and shows no clear correlation with broad-line luminosity, black hole (BH) masses, or the AGN fraction. It suggests that $> 10$ cMpc structures do not significantly influence BH growth. We measure the two-point cross-correlation function of AGNs with HAEs, finding a comparable amplitude to that of the HAE auto-correlation. This indicates similar bias parameters and host dark matter halo masses for AGNs and HAEs. The correlation length of field AGNs is 4.26 $h^{-1}$cMpc, and 7.66 $h^{-1}$cMpc at $3.9 < z < 5$ and $5 < z < 6$, respectively. We infer a median host dark matter halo mass of $\log (M_h/M_\odot)\approx 11.0-11.2$ and host stellar masses of $\log (M_\star/M_\odot) \approx 8.4-8.6$ by comparing with the UniverseMachine simulation. Our clustering analysis suggests that low-luminosity AGNs at high redshift reside in normal star-forming galaxies with overmassive BHs. They represent an intrinsically distinct population from luminous quasars and could be a common phase in galaxy evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper examines the evolution of cosmic filaments across redshifts 1, 0.5, and 0 using the IllustrisTNG100-1 magneto-hydrodynamical simulation. To achieve this, we introduce GrAviPaSt, a simple and efficient filament identification method that leverages gravitational potential, an A*-like path-finding algorithm, and spanning trees. Applying this method to galaxy distributions at different redshifts allows us to analyze various filament properties, including their length, thickness, mass density contrast, and radial profile. Additionally, we investigate dynamic characteristics such as the mean distance of filament galaxies from the skeleton, their weighted mean velocity, and velocity trends normalized by their positions within the filaments. Our findings reveal the evolution of cosmic filaments from redshift 1 to 0, highlighting key differences across classifications. In particular, we examine the mass density contrast radial profile of filaments connecting two galaxy groups and those linking two galaxy clusters, identifying distinct differences in profile shape between these categories. Furthermore, in the context of weighted mean velocity, we analyze cosmic filaments exhibiting either negative or positive weighted mean velocity, demonstrating their differing evolutionary trends in terms of the mean distance of filament galaxies from the skeleton.
#### The role of magnetic field and stellar feedback in the evolution of filamentary structures in collapsing star-forming clouds

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Filaments are common features in molecular clouds and they play a key role in star formation (SF). Studying their life cycle is essential to fully understand the SF process. Aims: We aim to characterise the impact of magnetic field ($B$) and stellar feedback on the evolution of filamentary structures in star-forming clouds. Methods: We performed two numerical simulations of a collapsing $10^4\,$M$_\odot$ cloud with different mass-to-flux ratios ($\mu=2$ and $\mu=8$), including early stellar feedback (jets and HII regions). Using DisPerSE, we extracted the three-dimensional filamentary network and analysed its properties as it evolves throughout the SF event. Results: We observed that the filamentary network in the simulations follow two distinct evolutionary pathways. In the strongly magnetised case, the cloud maintains a sparser filamentary network, and the arising filaments are predominantly perpendicular to $B$ lines. With a weak field, the cloud develops a single central hub, with converging filaments favouring a parallel alignment relative to $B$. Furthermore, while always accreting, filaments exhibit faster flows towards the hub relative to the surrounding gas. In the weakly magnetised run, the central hub dominates the dynamics, and filaments exhibit faster flows as they approach the central hub. Finally, once the expanding HII region impacts the filaments, they align to $B$ independently of the initial configuration. Conclusions: Magnetic fields play a critical role in shaping the structure and dynamics of molecular clouds. Stronger magnetic fields slow the cloud's evolution and inhibit the formation of central hubs, promoting a broader filamentary network instead. However, ionising feedback dominates the late-stage evolution, overriding the initial differences and dictating the final filament configuration.

 - **Abstract**
 We are on the cusp of detecting gravitational waves (GWs) from individual massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna and pulsar-timing arrays. These MBHBs may be surrounded by circumbinary disks and minidisks, the electromagnetic emission from which are essential for localizing the MBHBs on the sky. Here we present the first radiative magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) minidisk simulation that directly solves the radiative transfer equation on discretized grid rays. The simulation examines one of the minidisks in an equal-mass $2\times10^7\,M_\odot$ MBHB separated by 100 gravitational radii. Minidisks simulated with and without radiative effects resemble each other qualitatively but differ in several key aspects. The RMHD minidisk is denser and geometrically thinner than the magnetohydrodynamics minidisk. Furthermore, the RMHD minidisk, with a nonaxisymmetric photosphere and temperature distribution, produces an anisotropic illumination pattern. As a result, the observed radiative flux of two RMHD minidisks orbiting each other varies at half the binary orbital period, a feature independent of relativistic boosting and lensing effects. Such periodic light curves, if identified in upcoming optical transient surveys, could reveal the existence of MBHBs on the way to merger, particularly if they are in a constant phase relation with detected GWs.
#### Probing the co-evolution of SMBHs and their hosts from scaling relations pairwise residuals: dominance of stellar velocity dispersion and host halo mass

 - **Abstract**
 The correlations between Supermassive Black Holes (SMBHs) and their host galaxies still defy our understanding from both the observational and theoretical perspectives. Here we perform pairwise residual analysis on the latest sample of local inactive galaxies with a uniform calibration of their photometric properties and with dynamically measured masses of their central SMBHs. The residuals reveal that stellar velocity dispersion $\sigma$ and, possibly host dark matter halo mass $M_{\rm halo}$, appear as the galactic properties most correlated with SMBH mass, with a secondary (weaker) correlation with spheroidal (bulge) mass $M_{\rm sph}$, as also corroborated by additional Machine Learning tests. These findings may favour energetic/kinetic feedback from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) as the main driver in shaping SMBH scaling relations. Two state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations, inclusive of kinetic AGN feedback, are able to broadly capture the mean trends observed in the residuals, although they tend to either favour $M_{\rm sph}$ as the most fundamental property, or generate too flat residuals. Increasing AGN feedback kinetic output does not improve the comparison with the data. In the Appendix we also show that the galaxies with dynamically measured SMBHs are biased high in $\sigma$ at fixed luminosity with respect to the full sample of local galaxies, proving that this bias is not a byproduct of stellar mass discrepancies. Overall, our results suggest that probing the SMBH-galaxy scaling relations in terms of total stellar mass alone may induce biases, and that either current data sets are incomplete, and/or that more insightful modelling is required to fully reproduce observations.

 - **Abstract**
 The formation channels of the gravitational-wave (GW) sources detected by LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (LVK) remain poorly constrained. Active galactic nucleus (AGN) has been proposed as one of the potential hosts but the fraction of GW events originating from AGNs has not been quantified. Here, we constrain the AGN-origin fraction $f_{\rm agn}$ by analyzing the spatial correlation between GW source localizations ($O1\!-\!O4$a) and AGN distributions (SDSS DR16). We find evidence of an excess of low-luminosity ($L_{\rm bol} \le 10^{45}~\!\mathrm{erg~s}^{-1}$) as well as low-Eddington ratio ($\lambda_{\rm Edd} \le 0.05$) AGNs around the LVK events, the explanation of which requires $f_{\rm agn} = 0.39^{+0.41}_{-0.32}$ and $0.29^{+0.40}_{-0.25}$ (90\% confidence level) of the LVK events originating from these respective AGN populations. Monte Carlo simulations confirm that this correlation is unlikely to arise from random coincidence, further supported by anomalous variation of the error of $f_{\rm agn}$ with GW event counts. These results provide the first observational evidence for GW sources coming from either low-luminosity or low-accretion-rate AGNs, offering critical insights into the environmental dependencies of the formation of GW sources.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) have captivated researchers for decades due to their exceptionally high luminosities and unique spectral characteristics. Some of these sources defy expectations by exhibiting super-Eddington luminosities with respect to stellar mass sources even in their low-hard state. Numerical steady-state calculations suggest that ULXs in this state can be explained as highly magnetized advective accretion sources around stellar-mass black holes. To explore this further, we employ GRMHD simulations using the publicly available code, BHAC (Black Hole Accretion Code), to model the behavior of highly magnetized advective accretion flows around a black hole. Our simulations demonstrate that such systems can indeed produce the intense luminosities observed in ULXs. Additionally, we validate that the magnetic fields required for these high emissions are of the order of $10^7$ Gauss, consistent with previous numerical steady-state findings.

 - **Abstract**
 We present panchromatic optical $+$ near-infrared (NIR) $+$ mid-infrared (MIR) observations of the intermediate-luminosity Type Iax supernova (SN Iax) 2024pxl and the extremely low-luminosity SN Iax 2024vjm. JWST observations provide unprecedented MIR spectroscopy of SN Iax, spanning from $+$11 to $+$42 days past maximum light. We detect forbidden emission lines in the MIR at these early times while the optical and NIR are dominated by permitted lines with an absorption component. Panchromatic spectra at early times can thus simultaneously show nebular and photospheric lines, probing both inner and outer layers of the ejecta. We identify spectral lines not seen before in SN Iax, including [Mg II] 4.76 $\mu$m, [Mg II] 9.71 $\mu$m, [Ne II] 12.81 $\mu$m, and isolated O I 2.76 $\mu$m that traces unburned material. Forbidden emission lines of all species are centrally peaked with similar kinematic distributions, indicating that the ejecta are well mixed in both SN 2024pxl and SN 2024vjm, a hallmark of pure deflagration explosion models. Radiative transfer modeling of SN 2024pxl shows good agreement with a weak deflagration of a near-Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf, but additional IR flux is needed to match the observations, potentially attributable to a surviving remnant. We favor a weak deflagration origin for SN 2024vjm because of its panchromatic spectral similarity to SN 2024pxl, despite the large difference in luminosity. However, our comparison weak deflagration models are all too luminous and rapidly fading compared to SN 2024vjm; future modeling should push to even weaker explosions and include the contribution of a bound remnant. Our observations demonstrate the diagnostic power of panchromatic spectroscopy for unveiling explosion physics in thermonuclear supernovae.

 - **Abstract**
 The process of mass-exchange between the components of High Mass X-ray Binary (HMXB) systems with neutron stars undergoing wind-fed accretion is discussed. The X-ray luminosity of these systems allows us to evaluate the mass capture rate by the neutron star from the stellar wind of its massive companion and set limits on the relative velocity between the neutron star and the wind. We find that the upper limit to the wind velocity in the orbital plane during the high state of the X-ray source is in the range 120--1000 km/s, which is by a factor of 2--4 lower than both the terminal wind velocity and the speed of the wind flowing out from the polar regions of massive stars for all the objects under investigation. This finding is valid not only for the systems with Be stars, but also for those system in which the optical components do not exhibit the Be phenomenon. We also show that the lower limit to the radial wind velocity in these systems can unlikely be smaller than a few per cent of the orbital velocity of the neutron star. This provide us with a new constraint on the mass-transfer process in the outflowing disks of Be-type stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Globular clusters (GCs) provide statistically significant coeval populations of stars spanning various evolutionary stages, allowing robust constraints on stellar evolution model parameters and ages. We analyze eight old Milky Way GCs with metallicities between [Fe/H] $=-2.31$ and $-0.77$ by comparing theoretical isochrone sets from the Dartmouth Stellar Evolution Program to HST observations. The theoretical isochrones include uncertainties introduced by $21$ stellar evolution parameters such as convective mixing, opacity, diffusion, and nuclear reactions, capturing much of the quantifiable physics used in our code. For each isochrone, we construct synthetic color-magnitude diagrams (CMD) near the main-sequence turn-off region and apply two full-CMD-fitting methods to fit HST ACS data across a range of distance and reddening and measure the absolute age of each GC from the resulting posterior distribution, which accounts for uncertainties in the stellar models, observations, and fitting method. The resulting best-fitting absolute ages range from $\approx 11.5$ to $13.5$ Gyr, with a typical error of $0.5-0.75$ Gyr; the data show a clear trend toward older ages at lower metallicities. Notably, distance and reddening account for over $50\%$ of the uncertainty in age determination in each case, with metallicity, $\alpha$ abundance, mixing length, and helium diffusion being the most important stellar physics parameters for the error budget. We also provide an absolute age-metallicity relation for Milky Way GCs.

 - **Abstract**
 The presence of infrared excesses around stars directly correlates to spatially-resolved imaging detections of circumstellar disks at both mm and optical/near-infrared wavelengths. High contrast imagers have resolved dozens of circumstellar disks with scattered light polarimetric imaging. Many of these detections are members of the Scorpius-Centaurus OB association, demonstrating it to be a rich sample for investigating planetary system architectures and planet-disk interactions. With the goal of expanding the sample of directly imaged debris disks in Scorpius-Centaurus, we conducted the Disks In Scorpius-Centaurus Survey (DISCS) leveraging knowledge of high-IR excesses and the power of high contrast polarimetric differential imaging. In combination with the GPIES polarimetric disk survey, we observe seven new Scorpius-Centaurus targets to achieve a 60% complete survey of debris disks with IR excesses exceeding $2.5\times10^{-4}$, resolving four new debris disks. HD 98363, HD 109832, and HD 146181 are resolved for the first time, and HD 112810 is resolved for the first time in polarized intensity. We identify morphological structures that may be indications of planet-disk interactions. We place the systems in the greater context of resolved debris disks, identifying factors of ten differences in scattered light contrast for a given IR excess and implying gaps in our understanding of the smallest and largest dust grains of a system. We conclude that while thermal emission measurements are correlated with scattered light detection, they poorly predict the magnitude of scattered light brightness. We also establish Scorpius-Centaurus debris disks as critical benchmarks in understanding the properties of disks in the scattering regime.
#### Automatic detection of Ellerman bombs using Deep Learning

 - **Abstract**
 Ellerman bombs (EBs) are observable signatures of photospheric small-scale magnetic reconnection events. The reliable automatic detection of EBs would enable the study of the impact of magnetic reconnection on the Sun's dynamics. We aim to develop a method to automatically detect EBs in H$\alpha$ observations from the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST) and in SDO/AIA observations using the 1600Å, 1700Å, 171Å and 304Å passbands. We trained models based on neural networks (NNs) to perform automatic detection of EBs. Additionally, we used different types of NNs to study how different properties contribute to the detection of EBs. We find that for SST observations, the NN-based models are proficient at detecting EBs. With sufficiently high spectral resolution, the spatial context is not required to detect EBs. However, as we degrade the spectral and spatial resolution, the spatial information becomes more important. Models that include both dimensions perform best. For SDO/AIA, the models struggle to reliably distinguish between EBs and bright patches of different origin. Permutation feature importance revealed that the H$\alpha$ line wings (around $\pm$1 Å from line center) are the most informative features for EB detection. For the SDO/AIA case, the 1600Å channel is the most relevant one when used in combination with 171Å and 304Å. The combination of the four different SDO/AIA passbands is not informative enough to accurately classify EBs. From our analysis of a few sample SDO/AIA 1600Å and 1700Å light curves, we conclude that inclusion of the temporal variation may be a significant step towards establishing an effective EB detection method that can be applied to the extensive SDO/AIA database of observations.

 - **Abstract**
 We argue that $^{23}$Na is a potentially significant source of galactic axions. For temperatures $\gtrsim 7 \times 10^8$K -- characteristic of carbon burning in the massive progenitors of supernovae and ONeMg white dwarfs -- the 440 keV first excited state of $^{23}$Na is thermally populated, with its repeated decays pumping stellar energy into escaping axions. Odd-A nuclear abundances are typically very low in high-temperature stellar environments (or absent entirely due to burn-up). $^{23}$Na is an exception: $\approx 0.1 M_\odot$ of the isotope is synthesized during carbon burning then maintained at $\approx 10^9$K for times ranging up to $6 \times 10^4$y. Using MESA simulations, a galactic model, and sampling over progenitor masses, locations, and evolutionary stages, we find a continuous flux at earth of $\langle \phi_a \rangle \approx 22$/cm$^2$s for $g^\mathrm{eff}_{aNN} = 10^{-9}$. Some fraction of these axions convert to photons as they propagate through the galactic magnetic field, producing a distinctive 440 keV line $\gamma$ ray detectable by all-sky detectors like the Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI). Assuming a 1$\mu$G galactic magnetic field and a sufficiently light axion mass, we find that COSI will be able to probe $| g_{aNN}^\mathrm{eff} g_{a \gamma \gamma} | \gtrsim1.8 \times 10^{-22}$ GeV$^{-1}$ at $3\sigma$ after two years of surveying.

 Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) have become the most precise distance indicators in astrophysics due to their incredible observational homogeneity. Increasing discovery rates, however, have revealed multiple sub-populations with spectroscopic properties that are both diverse and difficult to interpret using existing physical models. These peculiar events are hard to identify from sparsely sampled observations and can introduce systematics in cosmological analyses if not flagged early; they are also of broader importance for building a cohesive understanding of thermonuclear explosions. In this work, we introduce DiTSNe-Ia, a variational diffusion-based generative model conditioned on light curve observations and trained to reproduce the observed spectral diversity of SNe Ia. In experiments with realistic light curves and spectra from radiative transfer simulations, DiTSNe-Ia achieves significantly more accurate reconstructions than the widely used SALT3 templates across a broad range of observation phases (from 10 days before peak light to 30 days after it). DiTSNe-Ia yields a mean squared error of 0.108 across all phases-five times lower than SALT3's 0.508-and an after-peak error of just 0.0191, an order of magnitude smaller than SALT3's 0.305. Additionally, our model produces well-calibrated credible intervals with near-nominal coverage, particularly at post-peak phases. DiTSNe-Ia is a powerful tool for rapidly inferring the spectral properties of SNe Ia and other transient astrophysical phenomena for which a physical description does not yet exist.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the morphological properties of 17 spectroscopically confirmed massive quiescent galaxies ($10.2 < \log(M_{\ast}/M_{\odot}) < 11.2$) at $3.0 < z < 4.3$, observed with JWST/NIRSpec and NIRCam. Using Sérsic profile fits to the F277W and F444W imaging, we derive the size-mass relation and find typical sizes of $\sim$0.6-0.8 kpc at $M_{\ast} = 5 \times 10^{10}~M_{\odot}$, consistent with a factor of $\sim$7 growth from $z \sim 4$ to the present day, including a factor of $\sim$2 by $z \sim 2$. Galaxies with earlier formation times ($z_{50} \gtrsim 5$) tend to be larger (up to 0.3 dex above the relation), while late-forming galaxies are more compact. Using a random forest regressor, we identify local environmental density, quantified by $\log(1+\delta^{\prime}_{3})$ from the distances to the three nearest neighbors, as the strongest predictor of bulge-to-total ratio ($B/T$), which ranges from 0.25 to 1. Applying the same method to the IllustrisTNG simulation, the ex-situ stellar mass fraction ($f_{\ast,\mathrm{ex\text{-}situ}}$) -- a proxy for mergers -- is the dominant predictor of $B/T$. Galaxies with high $B/T$ in dense environments show bursty star formation and short quenching timescales ($\lesssim0.4$ Gyr), consistent with bulge growth via merger-induced starbursts; in simulations, such galaxies exhibit elevated ex-situ fractions ($\sim20\%$-$30\%$). In contrast, some high-$B/T$ galaxies in intermediate-density environments have low ex-situ fractions, suggesting that additional mechanisms -- such as violent disk instabilities -- may contribute. These findings point to multiple bulge growth pathways at high redshift, unified by rapid gas accretion, central starbursts, and AGN feedback, as predicted by cosmological simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a catalog of quasar pairs (QPs) constructed from the DESI DR1 quasar sample, which includes approximately 1.6 million spectroscopically confirmed quasars. Using a redshift-dependent self-matching procedure and applying physical constraints on projected separation (up to 110 kpc) and line-of-sight velocity difference (up to 2000 km/s), we identified 1,842 candidate quasar pairs. Each pair is spectroscopically confirmed, providing reliable redshift and velocity information. We visually classified these systems using DESI Legacy Imaging and SPARCL spectral data into four categories: QP (quasar pairs), QPC (quasar pair candidates), LQC (lensed quasar candidates), and Uncertain. The redshift distribution peaks at around z = 1 to 2.5, and 64.3 percent of QPs have line-of-sight velocity differences below 600 km/s, suggesting that many systems may be physically associated. This catalog provides a statistically meaningful sample for future studies of dual AGNs, gravitational lensing, and quasar clustering.
#### It's not just a phase: oblique pulsations in magnetic red giants and other stochastic oscillators

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic fields play a significant role in stellar evolution. In the last few years, asteroseismology has enabled the measurement of strong magnetic fields $10^4$--$10^6\,\mathrm{G}$ in the cores of dozens of red giants, and is the only known way to directly measure internal stellar magnetic fields. However, current data are still interpreted assuming that these fields are too weak or too axisymmetric to affect the orientation of the pulsations (i.e., make the pulsations ``oblique''), rendering stronger field strengths beyond the reach of existing asteroseismic searches. We show that, even when an oblique pulsator is also stochastic (such as in a red giant with a strong non-axisymmetric magnetic field), geometric effects will cause the signal to contain frequency components which remain in perfect relative phase with each other. This perfect phase relationship persists even over timescales in which stochasticity erases absolute phase information. This perfect relative coherence is a distinctive observational signature of oblique pulsation that does not require a model for mode frequencies to search for. However, due to its dependence on phase, this effect will not be evident in the power spectral density alone, and phase information should be retained in order to detect it. Coherence-based searches for oblique pulsations may pave the way to measurements of magnetic fields of currently inaccessible strengths in red giants, as well as some main-sequence and compact pulsators.
#### The Physical Nature of the Off-centered Extended Emission Associated with the Little Red Dots

 - **Abstract**
 A significant fraction of little red dots (LRDs) exhibit nearby extended emission of unknown origin. If physically associated with the LRD, this component may trace stellar emission from an off-centered host galaxy, neighboring companions, or nebular gas illuminated by the active nucleus. We investigate the detailed spectral energy distribution of the extended emission near four LRDs in the JWST UNCOVER and MegaScience surveys. We accurately decompose the extended emission from the dominant point source by simultaneously fitting the images in eight broad-band and nine medium-band filters. After considering both the results from photometric redshift fitting and the probability of galaxies at different redshift overlapping, we confirm that the off-centered blobs in three sources are physically associated with the LRDs, with two of them showing strong [\ion{O}{3}] $\lambda\lambda 4959,\,5007$ emission captured by the medium-band filters. While the spectral energy distributions of all three blobs can be modeled assuming star-forming galaxies with stellar mass $\sim 10^8\,M_{\odot}$, the exceptionally strong [\ion{O}{3}] emission of two sources is best interpreted as pure nebular emission from low-density ($n<10\, {\rm cm}^{-3}$), low-metallicity ($Z\approx 0.05\,Z_{\odot}$) gas photoionized by the ultraviolet radiation from the nearby LRD. Adopting LRD halo masses constrained by clustering measurements and theoretical considerations, we estimate a typical baryonic halo mass accretion rate of $\sim 2-9\, M_{\odot}\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$. If the halo accretion rate is sustained to $z=4$ and stars form with an efficiency of 10\%, the accreted gas would form a galaxy with stellar mass $\sim 10^9\,M_{\odot}$, potentially rendering them spatially resolved at lower redshift.
#### A pilot method to determine the high mass end of the Stellar Initial Mass Function in galaxies using UVIT, H$α$-MUSE observations and applied to NGC628

 - **Abstract**
 We present a pilot method to estimate the high-mass initial mass function (IMF) across the arm, interarm, and spur regions in galaxies and apply it to NGC 628. We extracted star-forming complexes (SFCs) from H$\alpha$ VLT/MUSE and UVIT (FUV and NUV) observations of NGC 628 and used ALMA observations to define the molecular gas distribution. We find that the extinction-corrected H$\alpha$ and FUV luminosities correlate well. Using the fact that O stars have a shorter lifetime (10$^7$ yr) compared to B stars (10$^8$ yr), we estimated the approximate number of O stars from H$\alpha$ emission, and the number of B0 ($M_{*} > 10 M_{\odot}$), and B1 ($10 M_{\odot} \geq M_{*} \geq 3 M_{\odot}$) stars using FUV, NUV observations. We derived the IMF index ($\alpha$) for different regions using O to B0 ($\alpha_{1}$) and B0 to B1 ($\alpha_{2}$) stellar ratios. Our findings indicate that if we assume H$\alpha$ arises only from O8-type stars, the resulting $\alpha_{1}$ value is consistent with the canonical IMF index. It steepens when we assume O stars with masses up to 100 $M_{\odot}$ with mean $\alpha_{1}= 3.16 \pm 0.62$. However, the $\alpha_{2}$ does not change for large variations in the O-star population, and the mean $\alpha= 2.64 \pm 0.14$. When we include only blue SFCs ($ FUV-NUV\leq0.3$), mean $\alpha_{2}$ is $2.43 \pm 0.06$. The IMF variation for SFCs in arms and spurs is insignificant. We also find that $\alpha_{2}$ correlates with different properties of the SFCs, the most prominent being the extinction-corrected UV color (FUV-NUV).

 - **Abstract**
 Compact Symmetric Objects (CSOs) are a distinct category of jetted active galactic nuclei (AGN) whose optical variability characteristics have not been well investigated. We present here the results of our investigation on the optical flux and colour variability properties of a bona fide sample of 38 CSOs. We used the g-, r- and i-bands data from the Zwicky Transient Facility survey that spans a duration of about 5 years. We also considered a comparison sub-sample of blazars that includes 5 flat spectrum radio quasars and 12 BL Lac objects with redshifts and g-band magnitudes similar to the limited sub-sample of 9 CSOs. These two sub-samples of AGN, chosen for this comparative study of their long-term optical variability, represent different orientations of their relativistic jets with respect to the observer. We found that both CSOs and blazars exhibit optical flux variations, although variability of CSOs is lower than that of blazars. The observed variability in both CSOs and blazars is attributed to the relativistic jets and the increased optical variations in blazars relative to CSOs are likely due to beaming effects. CSOs and blazars exhibit similar colour variations, with both of them showing a bluer when brighter trend. Such a colour variability pattern is expected due to processes associated with their relativistic jets.

 - **Abstract**
 We used ALMA to perform a line survey of the high-mass star forming region Sgr B2(N), called ReMoCA. We modeled under the assumption of LTE the spectra obtained toward the sources embedded in the secondary hot core Sgr B2(N2). We compared the chemical composition of these sources to that of sources from the literature and to predictions of the chemical kinetics model MAGICKAL. We detected up to 58 molecules toward Sgr B2(N2)'s hot cores, including up to 24 COMs, as well as many less abundant isotopologs. The compositions of some pairs of sources are well correlated, but differences also exist in particular for HNCO and NH2CHO. The abundances of series of homologous molecules drop by about one order of magnitude at each further step in complexity. The nondetection of radicals yields stringent constraints on the models. The comparison to the chemical models confirms previous evidence of a high cosmic-ray ionization rate in Sgr B2(N). The comparison to sources from the literature gives new insight into chemical differentiation. The composition of most hot cores of Sgr B2(N2) is tightly correlated to that of the hot core G31.41+0.31 and the hot corino IRAS 16293-2422B after normalizing the abundances by classes of molecules (O-, N-, O+N-, and S-bearing). There is no overall correlation between Sgr B2(N2) and the shocked region G+0.693-0.027 also located in Sgr B2, and even less with the cold starless core TMC-1. The class of N-bearing species reveals the largest variance among the four classes of molecules. The S-bearing class shows in contrast the smallest variance. These results imply that the class of N-bearing molecules reacts more sensitively to shocks, low-temperature gas phase chemistry after non-thermal desorption, or density. The abundance shifts observed between the N- and O-bearing molecules may indicate how violently and completely the ice mantles are desorbed. [abridged]

 - **Abstract**
 A comprehensive understanding of solar coronal heating and charged particle acceleration remains one of the most critical challenges in space and astrophysical plasma physics. In this study, we explore the contribution of Alfvén waves, both in their kinetic (KAWs) and inertial (IAWs) regimes, to particle acceleration processes that ultimately lead to coronal heating. Using a kinetic plasma framework based on the generalized Vlasov-Maxwell model, we analyze the dynamics of these waves with a focus on the perpendicular components of the Poynting flux vectors and the net resonance speed of the particles. Our results show that both the magnitude and dissipation rate of the Poynting flux for KAWs and IAWs decrease with increasing electron-to-ion temperature ratio (T_e/T_i) and normalized perpendicular electron inertial length (c k_x / omega_pe). We evaluate the associated electric potentials and find that KAWs are significantly influenced in the high wavenumber (k_x rho_i) regime. IAWs, on the other hand, show a decrease in electric potential along the magnetic field and an increase across it when the perpendicular electric field (E_x) is enhanced. We also determine the net resonant speeds of particles in the perpendicular direction and show that these wave-particle interactions can efficiently heat the solar corona over large distances (R_Sun). Finally, we quantify the power transported by KAWs and IAWs through solar flux loop tubes, finding that both wave types deliver greater energy with increasing T_e/T_i and c k_x / omega_pe. These findings offer deeper insights into wave-driven heating and are relevant to solar wind and magnetospheric physics.

 - **Abstract**
 Blue horizontal-branch (BHB) stars are ideal tracers for mapping the structure of Galactic stellar halo. Traditionally, BHB sample stars are built from large-scale spectroscopic surveys utilizing their spectral features, however, the resulting sample sizes have been quite limited. In this paper, we construct a catalog of BHB stars based on synthetic colors $(u-v)_{0}$ and $(g-i)_{0}$ in SkyMapper photometric systems, which are convolved from Gaia XP spectra. A total of 49,733 BHB stars are selected from nearly the entire sky (excluding regions of low Galactic latitudes $|b| \le 8^{\circ}$ with heavy reddening), with a completeness and purity exceeding 90\%. Using member stars of globular clusters with precise distance determinations, we carefully calibrate the relationship between the $g$-band absolute magnitude and $(g-i)_{0}$, achieving a precision of 0.11\,mag, which corresponds to a 5\% uncertainty in distance. This relation is applied to derive distances for all BHB stars in the constructed sample. Given current capabilities of Gaia XP observations, the constructed BHB sample is primarily located within 20 kpc, enabling detailed mapping of the inner stellar halo. To extend this depth to the outer halo or even the edge of our Galaxy, we explore the potential of the Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST) and its broad-band photometry for detecting BHB stars. Using mock data from synthetic spectra, we find that it is feasible to distinguish BHB stars from blue stragglers (BS) stars using CSST near-ultraviolet bands ($NUV, u$) photometry. Thanks to the deep limiting magnitude of CSST, its data will provide a groundbreaking perspective on our Galaxy, particularly regarding the outer halo, in an unprecedented volume.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar flares are among the most powerful and dynamic events in the solar system, resulting from the sudden release of magnetic energy stored in the Sun's atmosphere. These energetic bursts of electromagnetic radiation can release up to 10^32 erg of energy, impacting space weather and posing risks to technological infrastructure and therefore require accurate forecasting of solar flare occurrences and intensities. This study evaluates the predictive performance of three machine learning algorithms: Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) for classifying solar flares into 4 categories (B, C, M, X). Using the dataset of 13 SHARP parameters, the effectiveness of the models was evaluated in binary and multiclass classification tasks. The analysis utilized 8 principal components (PC), capturing 95% of data variance, and 100 PCs, capturing 97.5% of variance. Our approach uniquely combines binary and multiclass classification with different levels of dimensionality reduction, an innovative methodology not previously explored in the context of solar flare prediction. Employing a 10-fold stratified cross-validation and grid search for hyperparameter tuning ensured robust model evaluation. Our findings indicate that Random Forest and XGBoost consistently demonstrate strong performance across all metrics, benefiting significantly from increased dimensionality. The insights of this study enhance future research by optimizing dimensionality reduction techniques and informing model selection for astrophysical tasks. By integrating this newly acquired knowledge into future research, more accurate space weather forecasting systems can be developed, along with a deeper understanding of solar physics.

 - **Abstract**
 Deuterated molecules can be used to study the physical conditions and the astro-chemical evolution of molecular clouds. large-sample surveys for deuterated molecules are needed to understand the enhancement of deuterated molecules from diffuse molecular gas to cold cores. A single-pointing survey toward the 559 Planck cold clumps of the Early Cold Core Catalogue (ECC) has been conducted using the Arizona Radio Observatory 12-meter telescope, focusing on the $J$=1-0 transitions of DCO$^+$ and DCN. The survey included observations of 309 cores for DCO$^+$ and DCN 1-0 simultaneously, followed by 71 of these cores where DCO$^+$ 1-0 was detected for H$^{13}$CO$^+$ and H$^{13}$CN 1-0 simultaneously, aiming to determine the deuterated fraction ($D_{\rm frac}$). Additionally, 250 cores were observed for DCO$^+$, DCN, H$^{13}$CO$^+$ and H$^{13}$CN 1-0 simultaneously. Among the 309 sources, DCO$^+$ and DCN 1-0 were detected in 79 and 11 sources, with a detection rates of 25.6 % and 3.6 % respectively. In the 250 sources observed for all four species, DCO$^+$, DCN, H$^{13}$CO$^+$ and H$^{13}$CN 1-0 were detected in 58, 9, 57 and 13 sources, with a detection rate of 23.2 %, 3.6 %, 22.8 % and 5.2 % respectively. The $D_{\rm frac}$(HCO$^+$) values in 112 sources range from 0.89 % to 7.4 % with a median value of 3.1 %, while $D_{\rm frac}$(HCN) values in 11 sources range from 1.5 % to 5.5 % with a median value of 2.3 %. The line widths of DCO$^+$ and H$^{13}$CO$^+$ 1-0 detections are mostly within 1 km s$^{-1}$. The similarity in $D_{\rm frac}$ values between HCO$^+$ and HCN indicates that the higher detection rate of DCO$^+$ 1-0 compared with DCN 1-0 is due to the lower critical density of DCO$^+$ 1-0. We suggest that the enhancement of DCO$^+$ and DCN likely begins in the early diffuse stage of the molecular cloud, rather than during the cold core formation stage.

 - **Abstract**
 Distance measurements to extragalactic systems that are both accurate and precise are cornerstones of modern astrophysics, underpinning the calibration of standard candles and the determination of the Hubble constant. Dwarf galaxies, such as Wolf-Lundmark-Melotte (WLM) and Sextans A, provide valuable laboratories for testing distance scales across different stellar populations. In this work, we utilize the high sensitivity and spatial resolution of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to measure the distances to WLM and Sextans A using the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) method. Adopting the TRGB absolute magnitude calibrated by NGC 4258, we determine distance moduli of $\mu_{\mathrm{0,WLM}} = 24.977 \pm 0.018 (\mathrm{stat}) \pm 0.056 (\mathrm{sys})$ mag for WLM and $\mu_{\mathrm{0,SexA}} = 25.740 \pm 0.011 (\mathrm{stat}) \pm 0.057 (\mathrm{sys})$ mag for Sextans A. Our results are consistent within a 3% distance uncertainty with previous measurements based on TRGB, Cepheids, and J-Region Asymptotic Giant Branch (JAGB) methods. With improved distance measurements in the future, these two galaxies have the potential to serve as additional anchor points for TRGB calibration, aiming to reduce the TRGB-based distance uncertainty to below 2%.
#### Response of the solar atmosphere to flux emergence: With emergence-driven prominence formation

 - **Abstract**
 Flux emergence is crucial for the formation of solar active regions and triggering of various eruptions. However, the detailed mechanisms by which flux emergence drives these eruptions remain unclear and require numerical investigation. Using 2.5-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we investigate the interaction between emerging flux and background magnetic fields and dynamics of the induced eruptions. By systematically varying the strength and angle of the emerging magnetic field relative to the background field, we investigate its impact on the initiation and evolution of solar eruptions. The simulations show that magnetic reconnection between the emerging flux and background field drives the formation of current sheets, magnetic islands and multithermal jets. Stronger magnetic fields result in earlier eruptions, more energetic jets, and enhanced heating. The formation and ejection of magnetic islands affect the structure and dynamics of the jet. When the hot and cool components of jets reach the other footpoint of magnetic loops, they will generate spicules near the transition region. Varying the angle between the emerging flux and the background field, we find that larger angles delay filament ascent and eruption timing but facilitate filament formation. Filaments form a hot shell and oscillate with a period of 10 minutes driven by periodic plasma ejections. Repetitive reconnection events inject cold plasma into the self-consistently formed filament channel, introducing a new prominence formation mechanism by flux-emergence-fed injection. Our analysis highlights the dynamic interplay between magnetic reconnection, plasma cooling and heating, and filament dynamics. These findings provide insights into solar eruptions and their observational signatures, emphasizing the role of multi-thermal structures in the corona.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the Faraday rotation measure (RM) variability of flat spectrum radio quasar 1633+382 on 5 epochs spanning from 2004 to 2008. We used 4 to 43~GHz VLBI polarization data from VLBA. Core RM across 4 to 15 GHz scales with a power index $a\sim2$, for $a$ in RM$\propto \nu^a$. We detected sign changes across epochs, both in the core and in the jet region. RM time variability in the core and jet region are not correlated, hence limiting the size of a possible Faraday screen. We relate the core RM variability to a new component emerging from the core region. For the jet region, we consider the jet-medium interaction to be a less likely cause of the RM variability because of the uniform spectral index distribution. The observed RM value variation requires a huge fluctuation in electron density or magnetic field, hence a foreground Faraday screen is less favoured. We further discuss other possibilities of the RM variability based on jet kinematics.

 - **Abstract**
 Rocky exoplanets accessible to characterisation often lie on close-in orbits where tidal heating within their interiors is significant, with the L 98-59 planetary system being a prime example. As a long-term energy source for ongoing mantle melting and outgassing, tidal heating has been considered as a way to replenish lost atmospheres on rocky planets around active M-dwarfs. We simulate the early evolution of L 98-59 b, c and d using a time-evolved interior-atmosphere modelling framework, with a self-consistent implementation of tidal heating and redox-controlled outgassing. Emerging from our calculations is a novel self-limiting mechanism between radiative cooling, tidal heating, and mantle rheology, which we term the 'radiation-tide-rheology feedback'. Our coupled modelling yields self-limiting tidal heating estimates that are up to two orders of magnitude lower than previous calculations, and yet are still large enough to enable the extension of primordial magma oceans to Gyr timescales. Comparisons with a semi-analytic model demonstrate that this negative feedback is a robust mechanism which can probe a given planet's initial conditions, atmospheric composition, and interior structure. The orbit and instellation of the sub-Venus L 98-59 b likely place it in a regime where tidal heating has kept the planet molten up to the present day, even if it were to have lost its atmosphere. For c and d, a long-lived magma ocean can be induced by tides only with additional atmospheric regulation of energy transport.

 - **Abstract**
 The nuclear regions of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) likely host clumpy clouds that occasionally obscure the central X-ray source, causing eclipse events. These events offer a unique opportunity to study the properties and origins of such clouds. However, these transient events are rarely reported due to the need for extensive, long-term X-ray monitoring for years. Here, we conduct a systematic search for eclipse events in 40 AGNs well-monitored by the Swift X-ray Telescope (XRT) over the past 20 years, comprising a total of $\sim$11,000 observations. Our selection criteria rely on significant variations in X-ray flux and spectral shape. We identify 3 high-confidence events in 3 AGNs and 8 candidates in 6 AGNs, all in type I AGNs. The observed clouds have column densities of $N_{\rm H}~\sim$ (0.2 $-$ 31.2) $\times$ 10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ and ionization degrees of log $\xi$ $\sim$ (-1.3 $-$ 2.2). For the 5 events with well-constrained duration, their distances from the central black hole range from (2.4 $-$ 179) $\times$ 10$^{4}$ $R_{\rm g}$, with 2 clouds near the dust sublimation zone, 2 farther out. Interestingly, we find tentative correlations between the cloud properties (i.e. ionization state and column density) and the black hole mass and mass accretion rate, implying their strong connection to the accretion process, potentially via outflows. Our study also demonstrates the potential of the new X-ray all-sky monitor, Einstein Probe, in providing more detection and physical constraints for such events.

 - **Abstract**
 Planet migration within inner protoplanetary disks significantly influences exoplanet architectures. We investigate various migration mechanisms for young planets close to young stars. To quantify the stochastic migration driven by turbulent disks, we incorporate planets into existing 3-D MHD disk simulations of magnetospheric accretion. Besides the stochastic torque, we identify periodic torques from slowly evolving disk substructures farther out. We quantify these turbulent torques analytically using a modified Gaussian process. Then, using the disk structure in our simulation, we calculate migration timescales of various processes, including the smooth Type I/II migration, planet-star tidal interaction, magnetic dipole-dipole interaction, unipolar induction, and aerodynamical drag with the magnetosphere. Since our inner MHD turbulent disk reveals a very low surface density ($\sim 0.01$ g/cm$^{2}$), the resulting disk migration is significantly slower than previously estimated. Earth-mass planets have the migration timescale in the inner MHD turbulent disk exceeding the Hubble time, effectively stalling at the deadzone inner boundary ($R_{\mathrm{DZIB}}$). Only giant planets could migrate inward within the turbulent disk, and may stall at the magnetospheric truncation radius ($R_T$). A simplified planet population synthesis demonstrates that, at the end of the disk phase, all planets around solar-mass stars typically stall at $\lesssim$0.1 au since $R_T\sim R_{\mathrm{DZIB}}$. However, around 2 $M_{\odot}$ stars, higher-mass planets stall significantly closer to the star compared to low-mass planets, due to $R_T\ll R_{\mathrm{DZIB}}$. These results are consistent with recent observations on exoplanet demographics around different types of stars. Finally, turbulence in the low-density disk is unable to break the resonant planets, and thus young planets in resonances may be abundant.

 - **Abstract**
 We present results from a large spectroscopic survey of the nearest young association to the Sun, Upper Scorpius, conducted using 2dF/HERMES on the Anglo-Australian Telescope. We use spectroscopic youth criteria such as Li-equivalent widths to identify >1000 pre-main sequence (PMS) members across the region and measure radial velocities, combining these with Gaia EDR3 5-parameter astrometry to obtain 6D kinematic information. We separate confirmed PMS association members into distinct kinematic groups and measure expansion and rotation trends in each. We find strong evidence for asymmetric expansion in several groups and derive expansion timescales from the greatest rates of expansion in each group. We also trace the past motion of these groups using an epicycle approximation and estimate the time since their most compact configuration. These kinematic properties are compared to literature ages and the star formation history of Upper Scorpius is discussed. We find evidence that a scenario in which star formation in the subgroups of Upper Scorpius proceeded independently, either by self-instability or external feedback from Upper Centaurus-Lupus, is more likely than a recently proposed "cluster chain" scenario in which these subgroups have triggered each other.
