 - **Abstract**
 This white paper was submitted to NASA's Search For Life Science Analysis Group (SFL-SAG): To ensure that the first mission designed to seek signs of extant life since 1976 is able to produce an unambiguous biological interpretation, the SFL-SAG is tasked with identifying the most high-confidence, agnostic biosignatures which are targetable, detectable, and measurable in Martian subsurface mid-latitude ice. To aid in this effort, this white paper highlights three examples of target materials or phenomena, along with associated instrument concepts, which the SFL-SAG shall prioritize in its efforts to define the appropriate astrobiological strategy. These include 1) polyelectrolyte informational biopolymers, 2) macromolecular biological homochirality, and 3) chiral-specific metabolic reactions. The Agnostic Life Finding Association (ALFA) and University of Florida (UF) support the development of instrumentation that seeks these high-confidence biosignatures.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a multiwavelength spectroscopic survey of 23 luminous mid-infrared-selected Type-2 quasars at redshifts z = 0.88 to 3.49. The targets were selected in the SDSS Stripe 82 field based on their bright WISE W4 detections (flux > 5 mJy) and extremely faint or red optical counterparts (e.g., r > 23 or r - W4 > 8.4), designed to identify heavily obscured quasars. Deep near-infrared (Gemini/GNIRS) and optical (Keck/LRIS and KCWI) spectroscopy confirm 23 out of 24 candidates as Type-2 quasars in this redshift range, including 12 objects at z > 2. The spectra exhibit strong rest-frame UV and optical emission lines (Ly-alpha, C IV, [O III], H-alpha) with a wide range of line widths, indicating significant spectral diversity. Approximately one-third of the sample (8 of 23) shows broad H-alpha emission (FWHM > 2000 km/s) despite their Type-2 classification, while the rest have only narrow lines (FWHM < 2000 km/s) characteristic of classical obscured quasars. Notably, these broad-line Type-2 quasars share similar spectral energy distributions with the JWST-discovered "little red dot" (LRD) AGNs, suggesting that our sample could be lower-redshift analogues of the heavily obscured broad-line AGNs uncovered by JWST. We also find that the [O III] 5007 angstrom emission is relatively weak for their high bolometric luminosities, deviating from trends seen in lower-redshift Type-2 QSOs. A new composite spectrum for Type-2 QSOs is built using our sample. Overall, our results demonstrate that mid-IR selection efficiently uncovers a diverse population of obscured quasars and that spectroscopic follow-up is crucial for revealing their true nature. This study provides new insights into heavily obscured SMBH growth at cosmic noon and bridges the gap to the obscured AGN populations now being revealed by JWST.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of energy-dependent photon time delays from distant flaring sources provide significant constraints on Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV). Such effects originate from modified vacuum dispersion relations, causing differences in propagation times for photons emitted simultaneously from gamma-ray bursts, active galactic nuclei, or pulsars. These modifications are often parametrized within a general framework by an effective quantum gravity energy scale $E_{QG,n}$. While such general constraints are well established in the LIV literature, their translation into specific coefficients of alternative theoretical frameworks, such as the Standard-Model Extension (SME), is rarely carried out. In particular, existing bounds on the quadratic case ($n=2$) of $E_{QG,n}$ can be systematically converted into constraints on the non-birefringent, CPT-conserving SME coefficients $c^{(6)}_{(I)jm}$. This work provides a concise overview of the relevant SME formalism and introduces a transparent conversion method from $E_{QG,2}$ to SME parameters. We review the most stringent time-of-flight-based bounds on $E_{QG,n}$ and standardize them by accounting for systematics, applying missing prefactors, and transforming results into two-sided Gaussian uncertainties where needed. We then use these standardized constraints, along with additional bounds from the literature, to improve bounds on the individual SME coefficients of the photon sector by about an order of magnitude. A consistent methodology is developed to perform this conversion from the general LIV framework to the SME formalism.

 - **Abstract**
 Faraday rotation measure synthesis is a well-known approach originated in Burn (1966) and later developed by Sokoloff et al. (1998) and Brentjens \& de Bruyn (2005) for studying magnetic fields. This work presents a complementary approach--the polarization frequency analysis (PFA)--allowing the properties of the turbulent magnetic field, which are difficult for Burn's original approach. Based on synthetic polarization observation of MHD turbulence simulation data, we study the influence of the coupling effect between density and magnetic field on synchrotron polarization dispersion. By applying the PFA to different simulated interstellar turbulence environments, we find that the PFA technique can reveal the scaling slope of the turbulent magnetic field in the case of a weak coupling effect and can also reflect the scaling slope of the rotation measure in the case of a strong coupling effect. Since avoiding the influence of Faraday depolarization, the PFA technique is a promising way to uncover turbulence properties using observational data from the Low-Frequency Array for Radio Astronomy and the Square Kilometer Array.
#### The Diversity of Metal-Enrichment and Abundance Patterns at High Redshift: A Magellan Survey of Gas-rich Galaxies Traced by Damped Lyman-alpha Absorbers at z~5

 - **Abstract**
 A powerful technique to trace the signatures of the first stars is through the metal enrichment in concentrated reservoirs of hydrogen, such as the damped Lyman-alpha absorbers (DLAs) in the early universe. We conducted a survey aimed at discovering DLAs along sight lines to high-z quasars in order to measure element abundances at z>4. Here we report our first results from this survey for 10 DLAs with redshifts of ~4.2-5.0. We determine abundances of C, O, Si, S, and Fe, and thereby the metallicities and dust depletions. We find that DLA metallicities at z>4.5 show a wide diversity spanning ~3 orders of magnitude. The metallicities of DLAs at 3.7<z<5.3 show a larger dispersion compared to that at lower redshifts. Combining our sample with the literature, we find a relatively smooth evolution of metallicity with redshift out to z~5.3, with a tentative (~2 sigma) indication of a slight rise in metallicity at 4.5<z<5.3. The relative abundances exhibit C enhancement for both metal-poor and metal-enriched DLAs. In addition, alpha-element enhancement is evident in some DLAs, including a DLA at z=4.7 with a super-solar metallicity. Comparing [C/O] and [Si/O] with model predictions, 4 DLAs in our survey seem consistent with a non-zero Pop III contribution (3 with >=30% Pop-III contribution). Combining our sample and the literature, we find the dust depletion strength and dust-to-metal ratios to correlate positively with the total (gas+solid phase) metallicity, confirming the presence of metal-rich, dusty DLAs even at ~1 billion years after the Big Bang.
#### Re-examination of the CO absorption line in the M87 nucleus

 - **Abstract**
 We analyzed the archival ALMA data of the nuclear region of M87 and evaluate the molecular gas content from the CO(2--1) absorption line. We found an enigmatic variability in the absorption line depth between two epochs separated by only two months. We reexamined the dataset used in the analysis and found that the bandpass calibration source within the same dataset also revealed a similar absorption line structure. Furthermore, we observed a rise in the system noise temperature spectrum. We concluded that the absorption line structure identified in a previous study, and attributed to CO(2--1), does not originate from M87 but instead results from telluric contamination, and that we still have only the upper limit on the molecular gas around the nucleus of M87.

 - **Abstract**
 Intergalactic wandering stars (IWSs) within 10 Mpc remain a poorly explored area of astronomy. Such stars, if they exist, are supposed to be wandering objects as they are not bounded by the gravitational potential of any galaxy. We set out to conduct dedicated studies for unraveling such a wandering stellar population. As the first paper of the series, in the present work we model the distance distribution and luminosity function of IWSs formed via the Hills mechanism of the Galactic central massive black hole (GCMBH). We implement a numerical simulation to generate IWSs taking the ejection history of the GCMBH and the stellar evolution process into consideration, and present their luminosity function in the distance range of 200kpc - 10Mpc. Our results suggest that a few hundred thousand IWSs have been generated by the GCMBH via the Hills mechanism in the past 14 billion years. These IWSs have an apparent magnitude peaking at 30 to 35 mag in SDSS $r-$band, which are hard to detect. However, a few thousand of them at the bright end are detectable by upcoming wide-field deep surveys, such as China Space Station Telescope (CSST) and Vera Rubin Observatory (LSST). The forthcoming discovery of such a wandering stellar population will open a door for precise understanding of the matter constitution of the nearby intergalactic space and the dynamical history of galaxies in the local universe.
#### On ore-bearing asteroid remnants in lunar craters

 - **Abstract**
 We modify the probabilistic formalism developed by Elvis (2014) to estimate the number of lunar craters that contain ore-bearing asteroid remnants. When we consider craters at or above a threshold diameter of 1 km, we estimate an upper limit of ${\sim}6,500$ craters with asteroid remnants containing significant amounts of platinum group metals and an upper limit of ${\sim}3,400$ craters with asteroid remnants that contain significant amounts of water in the form of hydrated minerals. For a more conservative threshold of 5 km, we estimate $\lesssim400$ craters with asteroid remnants that contain significant amounts of platinum group metals. These values are one to two orders of magnitude larger than the number of ore-bearing near-Earth asteroids estimated by Elvis (2014), implying that it may be more advantageous, and hence more profitable, to mine asteroids that have impacted the Moon rather than the ones that are in orbit.

 - **Abstract**
 Active Galactic Nucleus jets have long be thought to exhibit a conical jet shape, but recently, several jets were found to have a transition from parabolic to conical structure. As more sources are investigated, this collimation profile appears to represent a common paradigm. Previous works suggest that the Bondi radius may serve as an indicator of the transition location, although discrepancies have been observed in some sources. To explore this further, we selected CTA 102 for which existing literature presents mixed evidence regarding the presence of a jet geometry break. We investigated the jet width profile of CTA 102 to study the possible transition changes in the jet, thereby improving the understanding of connection between Bondi radius and jet transition. We used multi-frequency VLBA images of CTA 102 at 2, 5, and 8 (single epoch), and 15, 22 and 43 GHz (stacked). The jet width profile was modeled with a single power law $W_{jet}\propto r^{\epsilon}$ yielding a power-law index of $\epsilon=0.69\pm0.02$, indicative of a quasi-parabolic geometry with no clear transition to a conical regime. The absence of discernible structural break around the Bondi radius implies that the physical conditions associated with the radius alone are insufficient to explain the jet collimation behaviour. On the other hand, we observe oscillatory features in the jet width profile, suggesting the influence of additional physical processes beyond gravitational confinement. These findings contribute to a more nuanced understanding of jet collimation in AGN and highlight the complexity of jet-environment interactions.
#### Protostellar Outflows at the EarliesT Stages (POETS). VIII. The jets in the intermediate-mass star-forming region G105.42+9.88 (alias LkHα 234)

 - **Abstract**
 Our aim is to investigate the protostellar jets inside the young stellar object (YSO) cluster G105.42+9.88 (alias LkH$\alpha$ 234). This is one of the least luminous targets of the Protostellar Outflows at the EarliesT Stages (POETS) survey, which has been recently carried out to study young outflow emission on scales of 10-100 au. The combination of multi-epoch water maser very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations with sensitive Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA) continuum and Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) H$_2$ 2.12 $\mu$m observations, allows us to study the protostellar outflows from the intermediate-mass binary system VLA 3A and 3B, separated by ~0.22", and from VLA 2, an intermediate-mass YSO placed ~1" to northwest of VLA 3. Toward VLA 2, the 2001 and 2011 Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations consistently show that the water masers are tracing a jet. The analysis of the 3D flow velocities proves that the jet is magneto-centrifugally launched in a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) disk wind (DW). We infer launch radii in the range 10-50 au for the streamlines traced by the water masers. The global VLBI 2023 water maser observations indicate that the jet propagation can be hindered by a very dense clump placed northeast of VLA 2 and that is consistent with the large-scale LBT H$_2$ emission, tracing only the southwest lobe of the VLA 2 jet. Instead, the parallel jets emitted by the nearby YSOs VLA 3A and 3B can be reliably tracked with the H$_2$ emission at scales of a few 10" to both the southwest and the northeast. In particular, northeast of VLA 3 the direction of these two jets crosses a linear chain of spaced H$_2$ knots, which is a clear signature of an episodic jet. The variable ejection from VLA 3B, witnessed by the water masers at scales of ~10 au, could be the origin of the episodic jet observed at larger scales.

 - **Abstract**
 The Querying Underlying mechanisms of massive star formation with ALMA-Resolved gas Kinematics and Structures (QUARKS) survey observed 139 infrared-bright (IR-bright) massive protoclusters at 1.3 mm wavelength with ALMA. This study investigates clump-to-core fragmentation and searches for candidate high-mass starless cores within IR-bright clumps using combined ALMA 12-m (C-2) and Atacama Compact Array (ACA) 7-m data, providing $\sim$ 1 arcsec ($\sim\rm0.02~pc$ at 3.7 kpc) resolution and $\sim\rm0.6\,mJy\,beam^{-1}$ continuum sensitivity ($\sim 0.3~M_{\odot}$ at 30 K). We identified 1562 compact cores from 1.3 mm continuum emission using getsf. Observed linear core separations ($\lambda_{\rm obs}$) are significantly less than the thermal Jeans length ($\lambda_{\rm J}$), with the $\lambda_{\rm obs}/\lambda_{\rm J}$ ratios peaking at $\sim0.2$. This indicates that thermal Jeans fragmentation has taken place within the IR-bright protocluster clumps studied here. The observed low ratio of $\lambda_{\rm obs}/\lambda_{\rm J}\ll 1$ could be the result of evolving core separation or hierarchical fragmentation. Based on associated signatures of star formation (e.g., outflows and ionized gas), we classified cores into three categories: 127 starless, 971 warm, and 464 evolved cores. Two starless cores have mass exceeding 16$\,M_{\odot}$, and represent high-mass candidates. The scarcity of such candidates suggests that competitive accretion-type models could be more applicable than turbulent core accretion-type models in high-mass star formation within these IR-bright protocluster clumps.

 - **Abstract**
 Observing large scale structure in redshift space gives rise to the well known redshift space distortions whereby a spherical distribution of galaxies is distorted into an ellipsoid along the line of sight of the observer. This effect is important on linear scales and so can be thought of as a Newtonian correction to the density perturbation even though their physical origin is in the Doppler effect. On larger scales subtler aspects of the Doppler and gravitational redshift effects give rise to further distortions in redshift space. These further contort objects beyond an ellipsoidal compression, into shapes with broken line-of-sight symmetry such as an egg- or bean-like shapes. In this paper, we aim to qualitatively picture how large over-dense regions, including clusters or superclusters, and under-dense regions, such as voids, undergoing infall or outflow respectively, become distorted in redshift space when higher-order relativistic effects are taken into account. This will contribute when analysing structure in real space such as stacking voids which are no longer radially symmetric when these effects are included.

 - **Abstract**
 X-ray and EUV solar flare emission cause increases in the Earth's dayside ionospheric electron density. While the response of the lower ionosphere to X-rays is well studied, the delay between EUV flare emission and the response of the ionospheric F-region has not been investigated. Here, we calculate the delays between incident He II 304 Angstrom emission, and the TEC response for 10 powerful solar flares, all of which exhibit delays under 1 minute. We assess these delays in relation to multiple solar and geophysical factors, and find a strong negative correlation (-0.85) between delay and He II flux change and a moderate negative correlation (-0.55) with rate of increase in He II flux. Additionally, flare magnitude and the X-ray-to-He II flux ratio at peak He II emission show strong negative correlations (-0.80 and -0.75, respectively). We also identify longer delays for flares occurring closer to the summer solstice. These results may have applications in upper-ionospheric recombination rate calculations, atmospheric modelling, and other solar-terrestrial studies. We highlight the importance of incident EUV and X-ray flux parameters on the response time of the ionospheric electron content, and these findings may also have implications for mitigating disruptions in communication and navigation systems.

 - **Abstract**
 This letter presents hybrid and fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations of fast-mode compressible turbulence. Turbulence damping at magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) scales closely follows linear transit-time damping theory. Despite strong phase steepening, turbulence sustains robust cross-scale energy cascading. These findings resolve the long-standing question about the validity of classical wave theories in strongly nonlinear regimes and overturn the common presumption that wave steepening disrupts compressible turbulence cascade, thereby providing a more complete picture of MHD turbulence.

 - **Abstract**
 The knowledge of the X-ray properties of the hot gas halos of early-type galaxies has significantly advanced in the past years, for large and homogeneously investigated samples. We compare these results with the X-ray properties of an exploratory set of gas evolution models in realistic early-type galaxies, produced with our high-resolution 2D hydrodynamical code MACER that includes AGN feedback and accretion from a circumgalactic medium. The model X-ray emission and absorption are integrated along the line of sight, to obtain maps of the surface brightness Sigma_X and temperature Tx. The X-ray diagnostics considered are the luminosity and average temperature for the whole galaxy (Lx and <Tx>) and within 5 optical effective radii (Lx5 and <Tx5>), and the circularized profiles Sigma_X(R) and Tx(R). The values for Lx, Lx5, <Tx>, and <Tx5> compare very well with those observed. The Sigma_X(R) and Tx(R) also present qualitative similarities with those of the representative galaxy NGC5129, and of ETGs with the most commonly observed shape for Tx(R): Sigma_X(R) matches the observed profile over many optical effective radii Re, and Tx(R) reproduces the characteristic bump that peaks at R=(1 - 3)Re. Inside the peak position, Tx(R) declines towards the center, but the explored models are systematically hotter by ~30%; possible explanations for this discrepancy are discussed. Interestingly, Sigma_X(R) and Tx(R) as large as observed outside of R~Re are reproduced only with significant accretion from a circumgalactic medium, highlighting its importance.
#### Detectability of compact intermediate-mass black hole binaries as low-frequency gravitational wave sources: the influence of dynamical friction of dark matter

 - **Abstract**
 The black hole (BH) spin could significantly change the density of dark matter (DM) in its vicinity, creating a mini-spike of the density of DM. The dynamical friction (DF) between DM and the companion star of a BH can provide an efficient loss of angular momentum, driving the BH-main sequence (MS) star binary to evolve toward a compact orbit system. We investigate the influence of the DF of DM on the detectability of intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH)-MS binaries as low-frequency gravitational wave (GW) sources. Taking into account the DF of DM, we employ the detailed binary evolution code MESA to model the evolution of a large number of IMBH-MS binaries. Our simulation shows that the DF of DM can drive those IMBH-MS binaries to evolve toward low-frequency GW sources for a low donor-star mass, a high spike index, or a short initial orbital period. When the spike index $\gamma=1.60$, those IMBH-MS binaries with donor-star masses of $1.0-3.4~ M_{\odot}$ and initial orbital periods of $0.65-16.82~ \rm days$ could potentially evolve into visible LISA sources within a distance of $10~\rm kpc$. The DF of DM can enlarge the initial parameter space and prolong the bifurcation periods. In the low-frequency GW source stage, the X-ray luminosities of those IMBH X-ray binaries are $\sim 10^{35}-10^{36}~\rm erg\,s^{-1}$, hence they are ideal multimessenger objects.
#### Coronal Cells in Coronal Holes: Systematic Analysis and Implications for Coronal Evolution

 - **Abstract**
 Using advanced processing techniques, we analyze high-cadence, high-resolution extreme ultraviolet images and show that, throughout the solar cycle, mid-latitude coronal holes (CHs) are made up of ubiquitous and space-filling funnel-shaped structures (or cells) anchored to unipolar magnetic flux concentrations in network lanes. We demonstrate that the coronal cells, previously documented in the magnetically closed regions, as well as coronal plumes, inside CHs, are a particular manifestation of ubiquitous cells. The cell properties depend on the magnetic field intensity at their footpoint and connectivity in the corona, either closing in opposite polarity regions (CF-cells) or extending to form open-field (OF-cells). The OF-cells reach size scales on the order of super-granules and are characterized by dark lanes delimiting ray-like features both showing, at different levels, persistent jet-like ejections. The cells' lifetime mirrors that of magnetic flux concentrations revealed by magnetograms, slowly emerging and then disappearing in a matter of a few hours to a few days in a one-to-one correspondence. When a cell forms along the CH boundary, it can alter the CH boundary by shrinking or expanding the CH by an approximately supergranular cell unit. Therefore, coronal cells can contribute to the dynamics of CH boundary. We contextualize these observations in a "coronal cell" theory potentially able to provide an explanation for fine scale coronal structures and jetting activity in polar coronal holes.

 - **Abstract**
 We perform two-dimensional global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations including the full nonideal MHD effects (Ohmic diffusion, Hall effect, and ambipolar diffusion) and approximate radiation transport to understand the dynamics and thermal structure of the inner protoplanetary disks (PPDs). We have developed a simple radiative transfer model for PPDs that reasonably treats stellar non-thermal (XUV), stellar thermal (optical/infrared), and re-emitted radiations, reproducing the temperature structures from Monte Carlo radiative transfer. Our simulations show fast one-sided surface accretion ($\sim 10\%$ of Keplerian velocity) and asymmetric disk winds when the vertical magnetic field is aligned with the disk angular momentum. The asymmetry is due to the failure of the wind on the side with the accretion layer. On the accreting surface, clumps are repeatedly generated and accrete, driven by radiative feedback. For the anti-aligned fields, surface accretion becomes more moderate and time-variable, while the winds remain largely symmetric. For the thermal structure, accretion heating does not affect the disk temperature in any of our runs. This is because (1) the accretion energy dissipates via Joule heating at 2--3 gas scale heights, where low optical depth enables efficient radiative cooling, and (2) the winds remove $\gtrsim 10\%$ of the accretion energy. In contrast, the winds enhance radiative heating by elevating the irradiation front. These results highlight the importance of coupling between gas dynamics and radiation transport in PPDs, and provide observable magnetic activities such as fast episodic accretion, wind asymmetry, and molecular survival in XUV-irradiated winds.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of the globular cluster (GC) population in the galaxy cluster RXJ 2129.7+0005 (z = 0.234) based on JWST NIRCam imaging in three filters: F115W, F150W, and F200W. We use this material to provide a detailed look at the color-magnitude distribution of the GCs and their spatial distribution around the central giant galaxy. We identified 3,160 GC candidates brighter than F150W=29.5, and assessed photometric completeness through artificial star tests. We determined that the GCs follow a radial power-law distribution with an index of $1.58 \pm 0.04$, with the redder GCs exhibiting a slightly greater central concentration. Their spatial distribution is also highly elliptical, closely following the shape of the BCG halo light.

 - **Abstract**
 Binary black holes (BBHs) forming in the accretion disks of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) represent a promising channel for gravitational-wave production. BBHs are typically expected to originate at migration traps, i.e. radial locations where the Type I migration of embedded stellar-mass black holes (BHs) transitions from outwards to inwards. In this work, we test this assumption by explicitly simulating the radial migration of BH pairs in AGN disks under different torque prescriptions, including thermal effects and the switch to Type II migration. We quantify where and when binaries form as a function of supermassive BH (SMBH) mass, disk viscosity, and migrating BH mass. We find that while the majority of pair-up events occur near migration traps, a substantial fraction takes place elsewhere in the disk, particularly for high-viscosity disks ($\alpha=0.1-0.4$) and SMBHs with mass above a threshold of $10^{7.5}$ solar masses, where differential migration is most efficient. The inclusion of thermal torques favors pair-up in outer locations of the disk and facilitates rapid pair-up. We also investigate hierarchical BBH formation, showing that higher-generation pair-ups are more tightly clustered around trap locations. Our results provide realistic prescriptions for BBH pair-up locations and timescales, highlighting the limitations of assuming fixed BBH formation sites.

 - **Abstract**
 In most nearby galaxies, photometry of the integrated light of their globular clusters (GCs) has been obtained in only two filters, yielding just a single color index. However, NGC 4874, the brightest central galaxy in the Coma cluster, now has Hubble Space Telescope (HST) photometry available in ten filters, giving us a special opportunity to test SED fitting procedures on GCs in distant galaxies. We fitted 29 of the brightest GCs with a library of SEDs from E-MILES and calculated the best-fit metallicity and mass of each cluster. Using the fitted masses and luminosities derived from the reddest magnitudes, in the flat portion of the GC spectrum, we also calculated inferred mass-to-light ratios for our sample GCs; these were in the range (M/L) $\simeq 2 - 4$, slightly larger than the average values for Milky Way GCs but within the conventional range.

 - **Abstract**
 NASA's Lucy spacecraft is en route to conduct the first close encounter with Jupiter's Trojans. While most scheduled flybys lie in the $L_4$ cloud, the only $L_5$ target is the Patroclus-Menoetius binary. Since each flyby offers unique insights into target and population properties unattainable from Earth, we examine the feasibility of including an additional, yet unknown, $L_5$ target while minimizing the impact on Lucy's primary mission. We use the background $L_5$ Trojans brighter than the completeness limit to model their absolute magnitude, spatial, and orbital distributions. A semi-analytical approach estimates the number of Trojans accessible to Lucy for a given $\Delta v$ budget in both pre- and post-Patroclus scenarios. Our results indicate that, while it is unlikely that any suitable Trojan lies on Lucy's nominal path, a moderate $\Delta v$ investment ($35-50\,\mathrm{m/s}$) could enable a sub-kilometer ($500-700\,\mathrm{m}$) flyby prior to the Patroclus encounter. Post-Patroclus, the likelihood of a similar flyby is $\sim60\%$ for $\Delta v\sim$ 50 m/s. Simulations with synthetic Trojans reveal that potential targets cluster near the node opposite to the encounter window, producing an optimal search period in late 2026 for both scenarios. Surveying the densest $10\%$ of this region would require under 5 nights with Subaru/HSC or under 2 nights with Rubin, using shift-and-stack techniques. A successful sub-kilometric flyby would expand Lucy's Trojan target size range and provide new constraints on collisional evolution and the long-standing asymmetry in the $L_4/L_5$ clouds. This nodal-clustering strategy could guide target searches in future Lucy extensions or other planetary flyby missions.
#### On the Efficiency of Producing Gamma-Ray Bursts from Isolated Population III Stars

 - **Abstract**
 The rate of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) from isolated Pop III stars is not well known, as it depends on our poor understanding of their initial mass function (IMF), rotation rates, stellar evolution, and mass loss. A sub-population of massive ($M_{\rm ZAMS}\gtrsim20M_\odot$) Pop III stars is expected to suffer core-collapse and launch a relativistic jet that would power a GRB. In the collapsar scenario, a key requirement is that the pre-supernova star imparts sufficient angular momentum to the remnant black hole to form an accretion disc and launch a relativistic jet, which demands rapid initial rotation of the progenitor star and suppression of line-driven mass loss during its chemically homogeneous evolution. Here we explore a grid of stellar evolution models of Pop III stars with masses $20\leq M_{\rm ZAMS}/M_\odot \leq 100$, which are initially rotating with surface angular velocities $0.6\leq \Omega_0/\Omega_{\rm crit}\leq 0.9$, where centrifugally-driven mass loss ensues for $\Omega>\Omega_{\rm crit}$. Realistic accretion and jet propagation models are used to derive the initial black hole masses and spins, and jet breakout times for these stars. The GRB production efficiency is obtained over a phase space comprising progenitor initial mass, rotation, and wind efficiency. For modest wind efficiency of $\eta_{\rm wind}=0.45-0.35$, the Pop III GRB production efficiency is $\eta_{\rm GRB}\sim10^{-5}-3\times10^{-4}\,M_\odot^{-1}$, respectively, for a top-heavy IMF. This yields an observable all-sky equivalent rate of $\sim2-40\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$ by \textit{Swift}, with 75\% of the GRBs located at $z\lesssim8$. If the actual observed rate is much lower, then this would imply $\eta_{\rm wind}>0.45$, which leads to significant loss of mass and angular momentum that renders isolated Pop III stars incapable of producing GRBs and favours a binary scenario instead.
