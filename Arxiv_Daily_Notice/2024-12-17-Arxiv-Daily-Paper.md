 - **Abstract**
 We use high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations to model feedback from Seyfert-type supermassive black hole (SMBH) jets onto galaxies with identical dark matter (DM) halos of log(M/M$_\odot$) ~ 11.8. The low mass, ~10$^6$ M$_\odot$, seed SMBHs, have been introduced when the parent DM halos have reached log(M/M$_\odot$) ~ 11, at z ~ 3.7. In a controlled experiment, we vary only the efficiency of the SMBH accretion and focus on galaxies and their immediate environment properties. Our results show that the AGN jet feedback has a substantial effect on the basic properties of Seyfert-type galaxies, such as morphology, gas fraction and distribution, star formation rate and distribution, bulge-to-disk ratio, DM halo baryon fraction, and properties of circumgalactic medium (CGM) and beyond. These have been compared to a galaxy with supernovae only feedback. We focus on the energy deposition by the jet in the ISM and IGM, and follow the expansion of the multiple jet cocoons to 2 Mpc. We find that the jet-ISM interaction gradually pushes the star formation to larger radii with increasing accretion efficiency, which results in increased mass of the outer stellar disk, which is best fit as a double-exponential disk. Furthermore, we compare our galaxies and their properties with the observed nearby Seyfert galaxies, including the scaling relations, and find a close agreement, although statistical analysis of observed Seyferts is currently missing. In a forthcoming paper, we focus on evolution of these objects at z<10 and study the effect of the SMBH seeding redshift on galaxy evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 With the advent of time-domain astronomy and the game-changing next generation of telescopes, we have unprecedented opportunities to explore the most energetic events in our Universe through electromagnetic radiation, gravitational waves, and neutrinos. These are elementary particles, which exist in three different flavors and change the latter as they propagate in the dense core of astrophysical sources as well as en route to Earth. To capitalize on existing and upcoming multi-messenger opportunities, it is crucial to understand: 1. the role of neutrinos in explosive transient sources as well as in the synthesis of the elements heavier than iron; 2. the impact of neutrino physics on the multi-messenger observables; 3. the information on the source physics carried by the detectable neutrino signal. In this review, the status of this exciting and fast-moving field is outlined, focusing on astrophysical sources linked to collapsing massive stars and neutron-star mergers. In light of the upcoming plethora of multi-messenger data, outstanding open issues concerning the optimization of multi-messenger detection strategies are discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 Many classical Be stars acquire their very rapid rotation by mass and angular-momentum transfer in massive binaries. Short-lived intermediate-phase objects have only been discovered recently. Data archives and the literature have been searched for additional candidates exhibiting this patterns. Thirteen candidates were identified at various confidence levels. Adding to the two known systems identified as classical Be star+pre-subdwarf binaries (LB-1 and HR6819), two more (V742Cas, HD44637) could be confirmed with interferometry, with V742Cas setting a new record for the smallest visually observed angular semi-major axis, at a=0.663mas. Two further ones (V447Sct, V1362Cyg) are not resolved interferometrically, but other evidence puts them at the same confidence level as LB-1. V2174Cyg is a candidate with very high confidence, but was not observed interferometrically. The remaining ones are either candidates with varying levels of confidence. Of a mostly magnitude complete sample of 328 Be stars, 0.5-1% are found to have recently completed the mass overflow that led to their formation. Another 5% are systems with compact subdwarf companions, i.e., further evolved after a previous overflow, and possibly two more percent harbor white dwarfs. All these systems are of early B-subtypes, however, and if the original sample is restricted to early subtypes (136 objects), these percentages increase by a factor of about 2.5, while dropping to zero for the mid and late subtypes (together 204 objects). This strongly suggests that early- vs. mid- and late-type Be stars have differently weighted channels to acquire their rapid rotation, namely binary interaction vs. evolutionary spin-up.
#### ALMA/SCUBA-2 COSMOS Survey: Properties of X-ray- and SED-selected AGNs in Bright Submillimeter Galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the properties of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the brightest submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) in the COSMOS field. We utilize the bright sample of ALMA/SCUBA-2 COSMOS Survey (AS2COSMOS), which consists of 260 SMGs with $S_{\mathrm{870}\, \mu \mathrm{m}}=0.7\text{--}19.2\,\mathrm{mJy}$ at $z=0\text{--}6$. We perform optical to millimeter spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling for the whole sample. We identify 24 AGN-host galaxies from the SEDs. Supplemented by 23 X-ray detected AGNs (X-ray AGNs), we construct an overall sample of 40 AGN-host galaxies. The X-ray luminosity upper bounds indicate that the X-ray undetected SED-identified AGNs are likely to be nearly Compton thick or have unusually suppressed X-ray emission. From visual classification, we identify $25^{+6}_{-5}$\% of the SMGs without AGNs as major merger candidates. This fraction is almost consistent with the general galaxy population at $z\sim2$, suggesting that major mergers are not necessarily required for the enhanced star formation in SMGs. We also identify $47^{+16}_{-15}$\% of the AGN hosts as major merger candidates, which is about twice as high as that in the SMGs without AGNs. This suggests that major mergers play a key role in triggering AGN activity in bright SMGs.

 - **Abstract**
 The gravitational time delays of macro-lenses can be used to constrain the rest mass of the photon with high accuracy. Assuming a point-mass $+$ external shear lens model, we prove that an upper limit of the photon mass can be derived directly from two observables--the time delay $\Delta t$ and the leading-to-trailing flux ratio $R$ of strongly lensed fast radio bursts (FRBs). Using the observed values of $\Delta t$ and $R$ of a lensed FRB candidate, i.e., FRB 20190308C, as a reference, we obtain a strict upper limit of the photon mass between $m_\gamma < 5.3 \times {10}^{-42}\,\rm kg$, for a given external shear strength of $\gamma' = 0.01$, and $m_{\gamma} < 2.1 \times 10^{-41}-2.4 \times 10^{-42}\,\text{kg}$, within the external shear range of $0<\gamma'<1$. This provides the most stringent limit to date on the photon mass through gravitational lensing time delays, improving by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude the previous results obtained from lensed active galactic nuclei.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a qualitative comparison between the host and black hole properties of radio galaxies in the MeerKAT GigaHertz Tiered Extragalactic Exploration~(MIGHTEE) survey with the radio galaxy population in the SIMBA suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. The MIGHTEE data includes a $\sim$1deg$^{2}$ pointing of the COSMOS field observed at 1.28GHz with the MeerKAT radio telescope and cross-matched with multi-wavelength counterparts to provide classifications of high and low excitation radio galaxies (HERGs and LERGs) along with their corresponding host properties. We compare the properties of the MIGHTEE HERGs and LERGs with that predicted by the SIMBA simulations where HERGs and LERGs are defined as radio galaxies dominated by cold or hot mode accretion respectively. We consider stellar masses $\;{M}_{*}$, star formation rates SFR, AGN bolometric luminosity $L_{\rm bol}$, and Eddington fraction $f_{\rm Edd}$, as a function of 1.4GHz radio luminosity and redshift. In both MIGHTEE and SIMBA, the properties of HERGs and LERGs are similar across all properties apart from SFRs due to differences in host cold gas content in SIMBA. We predict a population of HERGs with low $f_{\rm Edd}$ in SIMBA that are confirmed in the MIGHTEE observations and tied to the faint population at low $z$. The predictions from SIMBA with the MIGHTEE observations describe a regime where our understanding of the radio galaxy dichotomy breaks down, challenging our understanding of the role of AGN accretion and feedback in the faint population of radio galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 Molecular gas, as the fuel for star formation, and its relationship with atomic gas are crucial for understanding how galaxies regulate their star forming (SF) activities. We conducted IRAM 30m observations of 23 nearby spiral galaxies from the CHANG-ES project to investigatet the distribution of molecular gas and the Kennicutt-Schmidt law. Combining these results with atomic gas masses from previous studies, we aim to investigate the scaling relations that connect the molecular and atomic gas masses with stellar masses and the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation. Based on spatially resolved observations of the three CO lines, we calculated the total molecular gas masses, the ratios between different CO lines, and derived physical parameters such as temperature and optical depth. The median line ratios for nuclear/disk regions are 8.6/6.1 (^{12}\mathrm{CO}/^{13}\mathrm{CO}\ J=1{-}0) and 0.53/0.39 (^{12}\mathrm{CO}\ J=2{-}1/J=1{-}0). Molecular gas mass derived from ^{13}\mathrm{CO} is correlated but systematically lower than that from ^{12}\mathrm{CO}. Most galaxies follow the spatially resolved SF scaling relation with a median gas depletion timescale of approximately 1 Gyr, while a few exhibit shorter timescales of approximately 0.1 Gyr. The molecular-to-atomic gas mass ratio correlates strongly with stellar mass, consistent with previous studies. Galaxies with lower stellar masses show an excess of atomic gas, indicating less efficient conversion to molecular gas. Most galaxies tightly follow the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation, but NGC 2992 and NGC 4594 deviate from the relation due to different physical factors. We find that the ratio of the cold gas (comprising molecular and atomic gas) to the total baryon mass decreases with the gravitational potential of the galaxy, as traced by rotation velocity, which could be due to gas consumption in SF or being heated to the hot phase.
#### Vertical Shear Instability in Thermally-Stratified Protoplanetary Disks: I. A Linear Stability Analysis

 - **Abstract**
 Vertical shear instability (VSI), driven by a vertical gradient of rotational angular velocity, is a promising source of turbulence in protoplanetary disks. We examine the semi-global stability of thermally stratified disks and find that the VSI consists of surface and body modes: surface modes are confined to regions of strong shear, while body modes extend perturbations across the disk, consistent with the previous findings. In thermally stratified disks, surface modes bifurcate into two branches. The branch associated with the strongest shear at mid-height exhibits a higher growth rate compared to the branch near the surfaces. Surface modes generally grow rapidly and require a high radial wave number $k_R$, whereas body mode growth rates increase as $k_R$ decreases. Thermal stratification enhances the growth rates of both surface and body modes and boosts VSI-driven radial kinetic energy relative to vertical energy. Our results suggest that simulations will initially favor surface modes with large $k_R$, followed by an increase in body modes with smaller $k_R$, with faster progression in more thermal stratified disks.

 - **Abstract**
 We conduct three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the nonlinear outcomes and observability of vertical shear instability (VSI) in protoplanetary disks. Our models include both vertically isothermal and thermally stratified disks, with the latter representing realistic conditions featuring a hotter atmosphere above the midplane. We find that the VSI grows more rapidly and becomes stronger in thermally stratified disks due to enhanced shear, resulting in higher levels of turbulence. At saturation, the turbulence stress reaches $\alpha_{R\phi}\gtrsim 10^{-3}$, more than an order of magnitude stronger than the isothermal case. The saturated turbulence is more pronounced near the disk surfaces than at the midplane. On synthetic velocity residual maps, obtained by subtracting the Keplerian rotational velocity, perturbations driven by the VSI manifest as axisymmetric rings in isothermal disks and as ring segments in thermally stratified disks. The latter are visible at disk inclinations as high as $45^\circ$ in thermally stratified disks. The amplitudes of these residual velocities range from $\sim 50$ to $\sim100$ $\mathrm{m\ s}^{-1}$ at a $20^\circ$ inclination, with larger values corresponding to greater thermal stratification. The magnitude of the observed velocity residual increases with the optical depth of the tracer used, as optically thick lines probe the regions near the disk surfaces.

 - **Abstract**
 It is well-known that the cores of massive stars sustain a stellar dynamo with a complex magnetic field configuration. However, the same cannot be said for the field's strength and geometry at the convective-radiative boundary, which are crucial when performing asteroseismic inference. In this Letter, we present three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of a 7 solar mass mid-main sequence star, with particular attention given to the convective-radiative boundary in the near-core region. Our simulations reveal that the toroidal magnetic field is significantly stronger than the poloidal field in this region, contrary to recent assumptions. Moreover, the rotational shear layer, also important for asteroseismic inference, is specifically confined within the extent of the buoyancy frequency peak. These results, which are based on the inferred properties of HD 43317, have widespread implications for asteroseismic studies of rotation, mixing and magnetism in stars. While we expect our results to be broadly applicable across stars with similar buoyancy frequency profiles and stellar masses, we also expect the MHD parameters and the initial stellar rotation rate to impact the geometry of the field and differential rotation at the convective-radiative interface.
#### De-Biasing Structure Function Estimates From Sparse Time Series of the Solar Wind: A Data-Driven Approach

 - **Abstract**
 Structure functions, which represent the moments of the increments of a stochastic process, are essential complementary statistics to power spectra for analysing the self-similar behaviour of a time series. However, many real-world environmental datasets, such as those collected by spacecraft monitoring the solar wind, contain gaps, which inevitably corrupt the statistics. The nature of this corruption for structure functions remains poorly understood - indeed, often overlooked. Here we simulate gaps in a large set of magnetic field intervals from Parker Solar Probe in order to characterize the behaviour of the structure function of a sparse time series of solar wind turbulence. We quantify the resultant error with regards to the overall shape of the structure function, and its slope in the inertial range. Noting the consistent underestimation of the true curve when using linear interpolation, we demonstrate the ability of an empirical correction factor to de-bias these estimates. This correction, "learnt" from the data from a single spacecraft, is shown to generalize well to data from a solar wind regime elsewhere in the heliosphere, producing smaller errors, on average, for missing fractions >25%. Given this success, we apply the correction to gap-affected Voyager intervals from the inner heliosheath and local interstellar medium, obtaining spectral indices similar to those from previous studies. This work provides a tool for future studies of fragmented solar wind time series, such as those from Voyager, MAVEN, and OMNI, as well as sparsely-sampled astrophysical and geophysical processes more generally.

 - **Abstract**
 Ram pressure stripped galaxies are rare cases of environmental evolution in action. However, our ability to understand these galaxies is limited by the small number of identified galaxies experiencing ram pressure stripping (RPS). Our aim is to explore the efficacy of citizen science classifications in identifying ram pressure stripped galaxies, and use this to aid in motivating new samples of ram pressure stripped candidates. We compile a sample of over 200 known ram pressure stripped galaxies from existing literature, with morphological classifications obtained from Galaxy Zoo. We compare these galaxies with magnitude and redshift-matched comparison cluster and field galaxies. Additionally, we create a sample of SDSS cluster galaxies, with morphological classifications similar to known ram pressure stripped galaxies, and compare the fraction of potential new RPS candidates against control samples. We find that ram pressure stripped galaxies exhibit a higher proportion of odd and irregular morphological classifications compared to field and cluster comparison samples. This trend is particularly pronounced in galaxies displaying strong optical ram pressure stripping features, but absent from galaxies with only radio tails. We find that SDSS galaxies with Galaxy Zoo classifications consistent with the known RPS galaxies have a higher fraction of visible ram pressure stripping features ($19\%$) compared with other cluster galaxies ($12\%$) when classified by experts. We identify 101 new ram pressure stripping candidate galaxies through these expert classifications. We demonstrate that indirect morphological classifications from citizen science projects can increase the efficiency in which new stripping candidates are found. Projects such as Galaxy Zoo can aid in the identification of ram pressure stripped galaxies that are key to understanding galaxy evolution in clusters.
#### Africanus II. QuartiCal: calibrating radio interferometer data at scale using Numba and Dask

 - **Abstract**
 Calibration of radio interferometer data ought to be a solved problem; it has been an integral part of data reduction for some time. However, as larger, more sensitive radio interferometers are conceived and built, the calibration problem grows in both size and difficulty. The increasing size can be attributed to the fact that the data volume scales quadratically with the number of antennas in an array. Additionally, new instruments may have up to two orders of magnitude more channels than their predecessors. Simultaneously, increasing sensitivity is making calibration more challenging: low-level RFI and calibration artefacts (in the resulting images) which would previously have been subsumed by the noise may now limit dynamic range and, ultimately, the derived science. It is against this backdrop that we introduce QuartiCal: a new Python package implementing radio interferometric calibration routines. QuartiCal improves upon its predecessor, CubiCal, in terms of both flexibility and performance. Whilst the same mathematical framework - complex optimization using Wirtinger derivatives - is in use, the approach has been refined to support arbitrary length chains of parameterized gain terms. QuartiCal utilizes Dask, a library for parallel computing in Python, to express calibration as an embarrassingly parallel task graph. These task graphs can (with some constraints) be mapped onto a number of different hardware configurations, allowing QuartiCal to scale from running locally on consumer hardware to a distributed, cloud-based cluster. QuartiCal's qualitative behaviour is demonstrated using MeerKAT observations of PSR J2009-2026. These qualitative results are followed by an analysis of QuartiCal's performance in terms of wall time and memory footprint for a number of calibration scenarios and hardware configurations.
#### Africanus IV. The Stimela2 framework: scalable and reproducible workflows, from local to cloud compute

 - **Abstract**
 Stimela2 is a new-generation framework for developing data reduction workflows. It is designed for radio astronomy data but can be adapted for other data processing applications. Stimela2 aims at the middle ground between ease of development, human readability, and enabling robust, scalable and reproducible workflows. It represents workflows by linear, concise and intuitive YAML-format "recipes". Atomic data reduction tasks (binary executables, Python functions and code, and CASA tasks) are described by YAML-format "cab definitions" detailing each task's "schema" (inputs and outputs). Stimela2 provides a rich syntax for chaining tasks together, and encourages a high degree of modularity: recipes may be nested into other recipes, and configuration is cleanly separated from recipe logic. Tasks can be executed natively or in isolated environments using containerization technologies such as Apptainer. The container images are open-source and maintained through a companion package called cult-cargo. This enables the development of system-agnostic and fully reproducible workflows. Stimela2 facilitates the deployment of scalable, distributed workflows by interfacing with the Slurm scheduler and the Kubernetes API. The latter allows workflows to be readily deployed in the cloud. Previous papers in this series used Stimela2 as the underlying technology to run workflows on the AWS cloud. This paper presents an overview of Stimela2's design, architecture and use in the radio astronomy context.

 - **Abstract**
 Bayesian analysis has begun to be more widely adopted in X-ray spectroscopy, but it has largely been constrained to relatively simple physical models due to limitations in X-ray modelling software and computation time. As a result, Bayesian analysis of numerical models with high physics complexity have remained out of reach. This is a challenge, for example when modelling the X-ray emission of accreting black hole X-ray binaries, where the slow model computations severely limit explorations of parameter space and may bias the inference of astrophysical parameters. Here, we present RTFAST-Spectra: a neural network emulator that acts as a drop in replacement for the spectral portion of the black hole X-ray reverberation model RTDIST. This is the first emulator for the reltrans model suite and the first emulator for a state-of-the-art x-ray reflection model incorporating relativistic effects with 17 physically meaningful model parameters. We use Principal Component Analysis to create a light-weight neural network that is able to preserve correlations between complex atomic lines and simple continuum, enabling consistent modelling of key parameters of scientific interest. We achieve a $\mathcal{O}(10^2)$ times speed up over the original model in the most conservative conditions with $\mathcal{O}(1\%)$ precision over all 17 free parameters in the original numerical model, taking full posterior fits from months to hours. We employ Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling to show how we can better explore the posteriors of model parameters in simulated data and discuss the complexities in interpreting the model when fitting real data.

 - **Abstract**
 Sympathetic solar flares are eruptions that occur nearby in space and time, driven by an apparent interaction between the active regions in which they are triggered. Their statistical existence on the Sun has yet to be firmly established. The main goal of this paper is to identify a statistical signature of sympathetic flares, characterize their properties and determine a potential mechanism driving their interaction. We perform a statistical analysis of a large number of flares observed by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) and the Spectrometer Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX) on Solar Orbiter during solar cycle 24 and 25. We examine the spatiotemporal distribution of consecutive flare pairs across solar cycle phases and hemispheres, along with the propagation velocity of potential causal interactions and the relationship between flare magnitudes. We observe an excess of hemispheric flares separated by about 30 degrees of longitude and triggered in less than 1.5 hours from each other. This peak in angular separation varies with the solar cycle phase and hemisphere. Moreover, we identify a deficit of transequatorial events separated by 25-30 degrees in latitude and less than 5 degrees in longitude, a phenomenon we term unsympathetic flares. We provide strong statistical evidence for the existence of sympathetic flares on the Sun, demonstrating that their occurrence rate reaches approximately 5% across the three instruments used in this study. Additionally, we propose an interpretation of the observed angular scale of the sympathetic phenomenon, based on the separation between magnetic field line footpoints derived from potential field source surface extrapolations.

MIRAC-5 is a novel ground-based instrument that utilizes a state-of-the-art GeoSnap (2 - 13 microns) HgCdTe detector with adaptive optics support from MAPS to study protoplanetary disks, wide-orbit brown dwarfs, planetary companions in the contrast-limit, and a wide range of other astrophysical objects. We have used MIRAC-5 on six engineering observing runs, improving its performance and defining operating procedures. We characterize key aspects of MIRAC-5's performance, including verification that the total telescope, atmosphere, instrument, and detector throughput is approximately 10%. Following a planned dichroic upgrade, the system will have a throughput of 20% and background limiting magnitudes (for SNR = 5 and 8 hour exposure times) of 18.0, 15.6, and 12.6 for the L', M', and N' filters, respectively. The detector pixels experience 1/f noise but, if the astrophysical scene is properly modulated via chopping and nodding sequences, it is less than 10% the Poisson noise from the observed background in an 85 Hz frame. We achieve close to diffraction-limited performance in the N-band and all bands are expected to reach diffraction-limited performance following the adaptive optics system commissioning. We also present an exposure time calculator calibrated to the on-sky results. In its current state, MIRAC-5 will be capable of achieving several scientific objectives including the observation of warm wide-orbit companions. Once the adaptive optics is commissioned and a coronagraph installed in 2025, MIRAC-5 will have contrast-limited performance comparable to JWST, opening new and complementary science investigations for close-in companions.

 - **Abstract**
 The Near-Earth Asteroid (NEA) 2024 PT5 is on an Earth-like orbit which remained in Earth's immediate vicinity for several months at the end of 2024. PT5's orbit is challenging to populate with asteroids originating from the Main Belt and is more commonly associated with rocket bodies mistakenly identified as natural objects or with debris ejected from impacts on the Moon. We obtained visible and near-infrared reflectance spectra of PT5 with the Lowell Discovery Telescope and NASA Infrared Telescope Facility on 2024 August 16. The combined reflectance spectrum matches lunar samples but does not match any known asteroid types -- it is pyroxene-rich while asteroids of comparable spectral redness are olivine-rich. Moreover, the amount of solar radiation pressure observed on the PT5 trajectory is orders of magnitude lower than what would be expected for an artificial object. We therefore conclude that 2024 PT5 is ejecta from an impact on the Moon, thus making PT5 the second NEA suggested to be sourced from the surface of the Moon. While one object might be an outlier, two suggest that there is an underlying population to be characterized. Long-term predictions of the position of 2024 PT5 are challenging due to the slow Earth encounters characteristic of objects in these orbits. A population of near-Earth objects which are sourced by the Moon would be important to characterize for understanding how impacts work on our nearest neighbor and for identifying the source regions of asteroids and meteorites from this under-studied population of objects on very Earth-like orbits.

 - **Abstract**
 Considering inflationary magnetogenesis induced by time-dependent kinetic and axial couplings of a massless Abelian vector boson field breaking the conformal invariance we show in this Letter that, surprisingly, the spectral shape of the primordial magnetic field power spectrum is insensitive to the post-inflationary history, namely the barotropic parameter ($w$) and the gauge coupling functions of the post-inflationary era.
