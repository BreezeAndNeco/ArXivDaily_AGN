 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of the GIGAPYX-4600 image sensor in space environment, more specifically under different types of irradiations (protons and heavy ions). The GIGAPYX-4600 is a state-of-the-art 46M pixel multi-purpose, backside illuminated CMOS image sensor. The sensor features high-speed (200 fps), low-noise (< 2e-rms), rolling shutter readout. It has been fabricated using 65 nm node CMOS technology, making use of capacitive deep trench isolation, thus exhibiting good MTF as well as excellent dark current characteristics. The GIGAPYX image sensor family is meant to be easily scalable thanks to a novel use of stitching technology. The assessed sensor features an impressive 46 Mpixels, but the sensor family is meant to be scaled up to 220 M pixels. The idea of this study was to investigate the radiation hardness of a commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) image sensor that could be suitable for space-borne applications, such as earth observation or satellite vicinity surveillance. In the near future a radiation hard readout electronic for this sensor family will be made available off-the-shelf by Pyxalis. This presentation will overview the different sensor key performances evolutions after proton irradiation up to a total fluence of 2.3e11 p+/cm${}^2$ (62 MeV): dark current, dark current non-uniformity (DCNU), noise, non-linearity, saturation charge and photo-response non-uniformity (PRNU). As expected, degradations mostly occur on the dark current, DCNU and temporal noise. The orders of magnitude of the degradation are in the range of the already published high performance CIS technologies. Results obtained from heavy ions irradiations will demonstrate that the GIGAPYX is not only latch-up free at least up to 57 Mev.cm2/mg, but resistant to the blooming effects induced by a SET at pixel level thanks to its capacitive deep trench isolations. Various SEE effects have been studied, demonstrating encouraging results for such COTS device in order to fly, in particular in GEO orbit. All these radiations results will be used as inputs in designing space camera based on the GIGAPYX sensors, compatible with multiple-mission types.

 - **Abstract**
 The existence of axion-like particles (ALPs) can be probed from their signatures in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) due to the photon-ALP resonant conversion over the mass range of ALPs that matches with the effective mass of photons in the plasma in the astrophysical systems. Such a conversion can also occur in the Milky Way halo and disk and can cause a unique spatial and spectral distortion. The signal is highly non-Gaussian and cannot be measured precisely by the usual power-spectrum approach. We devise a new technique to search for this signal from the upcoming full-sky CMB experiment LiteBIRD using its multi-frequency band using a template-based spatial profile of the ALP distortion signal. This technique captures the large-scale non-Gaussian aspects of the ALP distortion signal in terms of a spatial template and makes it possible to search for any non-zero ALP signal. We show that the inference of the ALP coupling using the template-based technique from LiteBIRD can provide constraints on the coupling constant approximately $ g_{a\gamma} < 6.5 \times 10^{-12} \, \mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ for ALP masses below $10^{-14}$ eV at 95\% confidence interval which is an order of magnitude better than the current bounds from CERN Axion Solar Telescope (CAST) at $g_{a\gamma} < 6.6 \times 10^{-11} \, \mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$, This shows the capability of future multi-band CMB experiment LiteBIRD in opening the discovery space towards physics beyond the standard model.

 - **Abstract**
 Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) are approaching the sensitivity required to resolve for the first time gravitational wave (GW) signals from individual supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries. However, the large uncertainty in the localisation of the source will make the identification of its host environment challenging. We show how the posterior probability function of binary parameters inferred by the standard GW analysis can be converted into distributions of apparent magnitudes of the host galaxy in the infrared (IR) and optical bands. We do so for two different scenarios: one in which the host is a regular early-type galaxy (ETG), and one in which the binary resides in an active galactic nucleus (AGN). We estimate the binary parameter space PTAs can cover in the near and intermediate future and estimate whether their hosts will be detectable in all-sky electromagnetic surveys. A PTA with a baseline of 20 years and 116 pulsars, resembling the upcoming data release of the International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA)can detect binaries out to a luminosity distance of 2Gpc (which corresponds to a redshift of $z \approx 0.36$) under the most optimistic scenario for detection, while a PTA with a baseline of 30 years and 200 pulsars can reach out to a maximum distance slightly greater than 3Gpc ($z \approx 0.53$). We find that the host galaxies of all binaries that are detectable by a PTA with a baseline of 20 years are above the threshold for the WISE and SuperCOSMOS, and therefore they are expected to be present in those surveys, if they lie outside the Milky Way plane. 2MASS becomes incomplete for hosts of binary systems more massive than $10^{9.8}$ solar masses located at a luminosity distance from Earth greater than 1 Gpc. The EM surveys become slightly more incomplete when we consider the sensitivity of PTAs with baselines of 25 and 30 years, as PTAs can detect binaries to larger distances.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first large-scale, high-resolution simulations of dusty, star formation feedback-driven galactic outflows. Using the Cholla hydrodynamics code, we investigate dust sputtering in these environments for grains ranging in size from $1-0.001~{\mu\mathrm{m}}$. We compare results for two feedback models: one representative of low-redshift nuclear starburst galaxies and one similar to high-redshift main sequence galaxies. In general, our simulations show that multi-phase outflows are capable of safely transporting a vast majority of their dust to large distances ($\sim10~\textrm{kpc}$) from the disk. This work also shows that environmental shielding in cool gas clouds boosts dust survival rates significantly. The evolutionary path of dust depends strongly on grain size. Large grains ($a\geq0.1~{\mu\mathrm{m}}$) can be transported efficiently in all phases. Smaller grains, however, experience significant destruction in the hotter phases. $0.001~{\mu\mathrm{m}}$ grains in particular are quickly sputtered in all but the coolest gas, resulting in these grains strongly tracing the cool phase in outflows. These results may also indicate the importance of in-situ formation mechanisms, such as shattering, for the small dust grains and PAHs observed in emission throughout outflows in nearby galaxies. Surprisingly, we find that the hot phase dominates the transport of dust that survives to populate the CGM.

 - **Abstract**
 Coronal simulations of the solar maximum struggle with poor numerical stability and low computational efficiency since the magnetic field is more complex and stronger and coronal structures evolve more rapidly. This paper aims to enhance the numerical stability of the time-evolving COCONUT coronal model to mitigate these issues, to evaluate differences between the time-evolving and quasi-steady-state coronal simulation results, and to assess the impact of spatial resolution on global MHD coronal modelling of solar this http URL enhancing the positivity-preserving property of the time-evolving COCONUT, we employ it to simulate the evolution of coronal structures from the solar surface to 0.1 AU over two CRs around the May 2024 solar storm event. These simulations are performed on unstructured meshes containing 6.06, 1.52, and 0.38 M cells to assess the impact of grid resolution. We also conduct a quasi-steady-state coronal simulation, treating the solar surface as a rigidly rotating spherical shell, to demonstrate the impact of magnetic flux emergence and cancellation in global coronal simulations. Comparison with observations further validates the reliability of this this http URL paper demonstrates that incorporating magnetic field evolution in inner-boundary conditions can significantly improve the fidelity of global MHD coronal simulations around solar maximum. The simulated magnetic field strength using a refined mesh with 6.06 M cells can be more than 40% stronger than that in the coarser mesh with 0.38 M cells. A time step of 5 minutes and the mesh containing 1.5 M cells can effectively capture the evolution of large-scale coronal structures and small-sized dipoles. Thus, this model shows promise for accurately conducting real-time global coronal simulations of solar maximum, making it suitable for practical applications.

 - **Abstract**
 Asteroseismology, the study of stellar vibrations, is a method which can probe the structure deformation and internal rotation of stars. Salient among the seismic inferences of rotation from TESS observations are TIC 408165734, whose equatorial rotation rate is 10\% faster than the pole, and TIC 307930890, which has significant radial shear and shows a decreasing spin rate outward through its envelope. We also measure structural deformation in fifteen stars, nine of which are oblate, a finding consistent with expectations for relatively fast-rotating, non-magnetic stars. The difference between polar and equatorial radii in TIC 47639058 is 130 times larger than that for the Sun. The remaining six stars display splittings consistent with a prolate shape (surprisingly), possibly indicating the presence of equatorial toroidal magnetic fields. These inferences provide constraints for numerical simulations and new insights to guide theories of $\delta$ Scuti structure and rotation.

 - **Abstract**
 WISE 0855-0714 is the coldest known brown dwarf, located 2.28 pc from the solar system. Discovered by the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) in 2014 (Luhman 2014), the object is of interest to scientists because of its low temperature ($\approx270$ K), proximity to the solar system, small mass ($\sim3-10\: M_{J}$), and high proper motion. The first observations of W0855 by WISE in 2010 are heavily contaminated by a background source. With 10.5 years of observations following the NEOWISE reactivation in 2013 (Mainzer et al., 2014), we present a robust analysis of W0855's flux and color unobstructed by this background source. We obtain W1 = 19.3 and W1-W2 = 5.4 magnitudes with an error of 0.37 magnitudes.

 - **Abstract**
 The He I line at 1.08 $\mu$m is a valuable tracer of atmospheric escape in exoplanet atmospheres. We expand past networks used to predict the absorbing He(2$^3S$) by including, firstly, processes that involve H$_2$ and some molecular ions and, secondly, the interaction of photoelectrons with the atmosphere. We survey the literature on the chemical-collisional-radiative processes that govern the production-loss of He(2$^3S$). We simulate the atmospheric outflow from the Neptune-sized GJ 436 b by coupling a hydrodynamic model that solves the bulk properties of the gas and a Monte Carlo model that tracks the energy degradation of the photoelectrons. We identify Penning ionization of H as a key He(2$^3S$) loss process at GJ 436 b and update its rate coefficient to a value consistent with the most recent available cross sections. The update affects notably the predicted strength of the He I line. For GJ 436 b, photoelectron-driven processes (mainly ionization and excitation) modify the He(2$^3S$) population in layers too deep to affect the in-transit spectrum. The situation might be different for other atmospheres though. The spectral energy distribution of GJ 436 has a strong effect on the predicted in-transit signal. The published non-detections of the He I line for GJ 436 b are reasonably consistent with our model predictions for a solar-metallicity atmosphere when the model adopts a recently proposed spectral energy distribution. The interpretation of the He I line at 1.08 $\mu$m is model-dependent. Our revised network provides a general framework to extract more robust conclusions from measurements of this line, especially in atmospheres where H$_2$ remains abundant to high altitudes. We will explore additional, previously-ignored processes in future work.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work we use particle-in-cell (PIC) numerical simulations to study interaction of a spatially uniform electron beam with a rotational magnetic hole in a form of a Harris current sheet. We vary width of the Harris current sheet to investigate how this affects the quasi-linear relaxation, i.e. plateau formation of the bump-on-tail unstable electron beam. We find that when width of the Harris current sheet approaches and becomes smaller than the electron gyro-radius, quasi-linear relaxation becomes hampered and a positive slope in the electron velocity distribution function (VDF) persists. We explain this by the effects of non-conservation of electron magnetic moment, which, as recent works suggest, can maintain the positive slope of the VDF. In part, this can explain why some electron beams in the solar wind travel much longer distances than predicted by the quasi-linear theory, at least in those cases when the electron beams slide along the current sheets that are abundant when the different-speed solar wind streams interact with each other.
#### EP241021a: A catastrophic collapse/merger of compact star binary leading to the formation of a remnant millisecond magnetar?

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of fast X-ray transients (FXRTs) with the Einstein Probe have successfully led to the discovery of some unusual extragalactic optical transients. EP241021a is a newly discovered FXRT that was featured by a significant bump around ten days in both optical and X-ray bands. This timescale and the exceptionally high peak bolometric luminosity up to $\sim \rm 10^{44}erg~s^{-1}$ of the optical bump make it somewhat similar to fast blue optical transients, but still distinctive from them by its relatively red color. We then suggest that the multi-wavelength bump of EP241021a could represent an explosion-type transient, while the underlying power-law decaying component of the optical and X-ray emission as well as the total radio emission are produced by a moderately relativistic jet. By fitting the observed multi-wavelength light curves, it is found that the explosion ejecta that produce the thermal optical emission can have a mass of $\sim0.03~M_{\odot}$, an expanding velocity of $\sim0.25~c$, and an optical opacity of $\sim12~\rm cm^2g^{-1}$, which was continuously powered by a rapidly rotating and highly magnetized neutron star (NS; i.e., a magnetar). In addition to heating the explosion ejecta, the magnetar also provided the dominant contribution to the observed X-ray rebrightening through the non-thermal emission of its wind. These properties suggest that the explosion may result from a catastrophic collapse/merger of a compact star system, which led to the formation of a millisecond magnetar, and the possible progenitor could be an accreting white dwarf (WD) or a binary consisting of double WDs, double NSs, or a WD and an NS.

 - **Abstract**
 The formation and early evolution of Jupiter played a pivotal role in sculpting the large-scale architecture of the solar system, intertwining the narrative of Jovian early years with the broader story of the solar system's origins. The details and chronology of Jupiter's formation, however, remain elusive, primarily due to the inherent uncertainties of accretionary models, highlighting the need for independent constraints. Here we show that by analyzing the dynamics of Jupiter's satellites concurrently with its angular momentum budget, we can infer Jupiter's radius and interior state at the time of proto-solar nebula's dissipation. In particular, our calculations reveal that Jupiter was $2$ to $2.5$ times as large as it is today, 3.8 million years after the formation of the first solids in the solar system. Our model further indicates that young Jupiter possessed a magnetic field of approximately $B_{\rm{J}}^{\dagger} \approx 21$ mT (a factor of $\sim50$ higher than its present-day value) and was accreting material through a circum-Jovian disk at a rate of $\dot{M} = 1.2-2.4$ Jupiter masses per million years. Our findings are fully consistent with the core-accretion theory of giant planet formation and provide an evolutionary snapshot that pins down properties of the Jovian system at the end of the protosolar nebula's lifetime.

 - **Abstract**
 We present global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of accretion disks with a strong toroidal magnetic field using an equation of state that fixes the gas thermal scale height. The disk forms from the inflow of a rotating magnetized gas cloud with a toroidal magnetic field. We find that the system maintains a moderately strong mean azimuthal field in the midplane, with plasma-$\beta\sim1$, trans-Alfvénic fluctuations, and large accretion stresses $\alpha\sim0.1$. The azimuthal field in the disk is continuously escaping along the vertical direction but is also replenished via a local dynamo. The inflowing gas initially forms a strongly magnetized Keplerian disk with $\beta\ll1$ and $\alpha \gg 1$. The disk gradually collapses from the inside out over $\sim 50-80$ orbits to form a moderately magnetized disk with $\beta\sim1$ and $\alpha\sim0.1$. Radial advection of azimuthal magnetic field can maintain $\beta\lesssim1$ exterior to the circularization radius but not inside of it. Inclusion of a net initial vertical magnetic field can lead to an even more strongly magnetized disk midplane, consistent with previous work. When the gas thermal scale is not resolved ($\lesssim 4$ cells per thermal scale height), however, the disk remains highly magnetized with $\beta \ll 1 $. We discuss our results in the context of related shearing box simulations and other global disk simulations. The level of angular momentum transport found here is consistent with that inferred observationally in dwarf novae and X-ray transient outbursts, unlike simulations of weakly magnetized accretion disks.
#### Formation of a Possible Black-hole Ultracompact X-ray Binary with the Shortest Orbital Period

 - **Abstract**
 In the bulge of M31, the Chandra observations discovered a possible black hole (BH) ultracompact X-ray binary (UCXB) Seq.1 with an orbital period of 7.7 minutes and a maximum X-ray luminosity $L_{\rm X}=1.09^{+0.02}_{-0.01}\times10^{38}~ \rm erg\,s^{-1}$ in the $0.5-8$ keV band. The minimum orbital period of the BH UCXBs predicted by the standard magnetic braking (MB) model is longer than 8.3 minutes. In this work, we investigate whether the convection- and rotation-boosted (CARB) MB prescription can account for the formation of a BH UCXB like Seq.1. Our detailed stellar evolution models indicate that the CARB MB law can drive isolated BH-main sequence (MS) binaries to evolve toward BH UCXBs with an orbital period of $7.7~ \rm minutes$, in which a low-mass white dwarf transfers the material onto a BH in a short-term mass transfer episode, producing an X-ray luminosity of $10^{38}~\rm erg\,s^{-1}$. We also obtain an initial parameter space of BH-MS binaries as the progenitors of Seq.1 in the donor-star masses and orbital periods plane, which can be applied to future population synthesis simulations. If Seq.1 is indeed a BH UCXB, future spaceborne gravitational wave (GW) detectors can detect the low-frequency GW signals from this source, and a tidal disruption event will be expected after 0.12 Myr.
#### The Composite Spectrum of the Little Red Dots from an Inner Standard Disk and an Outer Gravitationally Unstable Disk

 - **Abstract**
 One of the most mysterious results from observations of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is the detection of numerous, high-redshift, very red, extremely compact, broad-line sources termed ``little red dots'' (LRDs). It is unclear whether the LRDs belong to an active galactic nucleus (AGN) or simply a collection of very compact star clusters. We build spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for 29 LRDs at $z \approx 3-8.5$ based on JWST photometric and spectroscopic observations. We find that the V-shaped SEDs of these LRDs exhibit a roughly similar break frequency at $\nu_{\rm b}=10^{14.96\pm0.06}$ Hz, which corresponds to $\lambda_{\rm b}=3287_{-424}^{+487} \textÅ$ in the rest frame. We propose that this unique SED can be explained by the combination of an inner standard disk and an outer gravitationally unstable accretion disk with Toomre parameter $Q\sim1$. The outer disk has a temperature of $\sim2000-4000$ K for typical AGN parameters, which can well reproduce the near-infrared to optical bump as observed in LRDs. This model can naturally explain the strong infrared to optical emission and the V-shaped SED with a similar break frequency $\simeq 10^{15}$ Hz for LRDs without invoking strong dust extinction or unusual stellar contribution from a host galaxy. Most LRDs stay in sub-Eddington state based on the SED modeling, which are intrinsically weak in X-rays.

 - **Abstract**
 The system TIC 470710327 is comprised of three main-sequence OB stars, with an inner compact 1.10 d eclipsing binary and a non-eclipsing tertiary on a 52.04 d orbit. With the tertiary mass of 14.5-16 $M_{\odot}$ and both components in the inner eclipsing binary with individual masses of 6--7 and 5.5-6.3 $M_{\odot}$, it is currently the most massive compact system known. The formation scenario of such a compact triple is uncertain. It has been suggested that `2 + 2' quadruple dynamics can lead to a stellar merger in the initially more massive binary and finally result in a highly magnetised tertiary. Our study confirms the presence of a kG-order magnetic field in the tertiary and the slow rotation typical for massive magnetic stars. We conclude that finding massive merger candidates by studies of dynamics in compact, multiple-star systems is an efficient way to understand the evolution of massive stellar multiplicity and the generation of magnetic fields.
#### The Dichotomy in the Nuclear and Host Galaxy Properties of High-redshift Quasars

 - **Abstract**
 The early growth of high-redshift quasars and their host galaxies raises critical questions about their cosmic evolution. We exploit the angular resolution and sensitivity of NIRCam to investigate the host galaxies of 31 quasars at $4\lesssim z\lesssim7$ drawn from multiple JWST surveys. Using a new multi-band forward-modeling code (\textsc{GalfitS}) that incorporates physically motivated priors, we securely detect and quantify the host emission in 30 objects, while simultaneously characterizing the nuclear spectral energy distribution. The host galaxies of high-redshift quasars are $\sim 0.3$~dex more compact than star-forming galaxies of comparable mass. A striking dichotomy emerges: luminous ``blue'' quasars ($L_{5100}\gtrsim10^{45}\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$) reside in bulge-dominated galaxies ($n \approx 5$) and exhibit a narrow range of ultraviolet nuclear slopes (median $\beta_{\rm UV} \approx -1.4$), while fainter ``red'' quasars inhabit disk-like hosts ($n\approx 1$) and display a broad range of slopes ($\beta_{\rm UV}\approx-2$ to 4). These two populations differ markedly in their black hole-to-stellar mass ratios, with high-luminosity quasars showing $M_{\mathrm{BH}}/M_\ast = 1.2\%$ compared to $4.7\%$ for lower luminosity sources, placing them collectively $\sim$0.6~dex above the local $M_{\mathrm{BH}}-M_\ast$ relation. This offset likely reflects rapid black hole growth in early gas-rich environments, where feedback from the active galactic nucleus becomes effective only after substantial gas depletion. Our findings suggest that the observed dichotomy, whether due to intrinsic spectral differences or dust extinction, fundamentally shapes the coevolution of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies in the early Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 These lecture notes provide an overview of high-energy astrophysical processes involving axions, axion-like particles (ALPs), and other weakly interacting slim particles (WISPs) focusing on their potential observational signatures in astrophysical environments. After introducing key concepts in high-energy astrophysics, we present the fundamental properties of WISPs, emphasizing their phenomenological implications. Particular attention is given to ALP-photon conversion in strong magnetic fields and the possible decay signatures of ALPs in sources such as active galactic nuclei, galaxy clusters, and cosmic-ray accelerators. These effects can lead to distinctive modifications in astrophysical spectra, spatial distributions, and polarization patterns, providing unique probes of physics beyond the Standard Model. We discuss their role in dark matter scenarios and their potential impact on high-energy observations. The lecture series is supplemented by hands-on tutorials, including exercises on axion electrodynamics and an analysis of gamma-ray data from NGC 1275 to search for ALP-photon conversion signatures.

 - **Abstract**
 Shocks in the solar corona can accelerate electrons that in turn generate radio emission known as type II radio bursts. The characteristics and morphology of these radio bursts in the dynamic spectrum reflect the evolution of the shock itself, together with the properties of the local corona where it propagates. In this work, we study the evolution of a complex type II radio burst showing a multi-lane structure, to find the locations where the radio emission is produced and relate them to the properties of the local environment. Using radio imaging, we track separately each lane composing the type II burst and relate the position of the emission to the properties of the ambient medium such as density, Alfven speed, and magnetic field. We show that the radio burst morphology in the dynamic spectrum changes with time and it is related to the complexity of the local environment. The initial stage of the radio emission show a single lane in the spectrum, while the latter stages of the radio signature evolve in a multi-lane scenario. The radio imaging reveals how the initial stage of the radio emission separates with time into different locations along the shock front as the density and orientation of the magnetic field change along the shock propagation. At the time where the spectrum shows a multi-lane shape, we found a clear separation of the imaged radio sources. By combining radio imaging with the properties of the local corona, we described the evolution of a type II radio burst and, for the first time, identified three distinct radio emission regions above the CME front. Two regions were located at the flanks, producing earlier radio emission than the central position, in accordance with the complexity of density and Alfven speed values in the regions where radio emission is generated. This unprecedented observation provides new insights into the nature of multi-lane type II bursts.

 - **Abstract**
 As the fields of stellar and exoplanetary study grow and revolutionary new detection instruments are created, it is imperative that a homogeneous, precise source of stellar parameters is available. This first work of the gr8stars collaboration presents the all-sky magnitude limited sample of 5645 bright FGKM dwarfs, along with homogeneously derived spectroscopic parameters of a subset of 1716 targets visible from the Northern hemisphere. We have collected high-resolution archival and new spectra from several instruments. Spectrosocpic parameters are determined using the PAWS pipeline, employing both the curve-of-growth equivalent width method, and the spectral synthesis method. We achieve median uncertainties of 106K in stellar effective temperature, 0.08 dex in surface gravity, and 0.03 dex in metallicity. This paper also presents photometric stellar parameters for these dwarfs, determined using SED fitting. The full gr8stars sample selection, including derived spectroscopic and photometric parameters, is made available through an interactive online database. We also perform a kinematic analysis to classify these stars according to their Galactic component.

 - **Abstract**
 Terrestrial planets within the Venus zone surrounding M dwarf stars can retain surface ice caps on the perpetual dark side if atmospheric heat transport is inefficient, {as suggested by previous global climate simulations \citep[e.g.,][]{leconte2013}.} This condition is {proposed} to play a role in the potential regional habitability of these planets. However, the amount of surface ice may be limited by considering the water condensed from the steam atmosphere in a runaway greenhouse state, and the physical mechanism for triggering the condensation process is not clear. Here, we use a two-column moist radiative-convective-subsiding model to investigate the water condensation process on tidally locked planets from the runaway greenhouse state. We find that the water condensation process is characterized by two distinct equilibrium states under the same {incoming stellar flux}. The initiation of condensation corresponds to a warm, unstable state exhibiting positive Planck feedback, whereas the termination phase corresponds to a cold, stable state exhibiting negative Planck feedback. We further show that the surface water mass in the collapsed state {decreases with the} incoming stellar flux, background surface pressure, and optical thickness of non-condensible greenhouse gases, with a global equivalent depth of less than $\sim 20$ cm. Our two-column approach provides a straightforward way to understand the water evolution on Venus zone planets around M dwarfs.

 - **Abstract**
 Seismic isolation is crucial for gravitational wave detectors as it minimizes ground vibrations, enabling the detection of faint gravitational wave signals. An active seismic isolation platform for precision measurement experiments is described. The table features piezo actuation along five degrees of freedom: three translational actuations and two tip-tilt degrees of freedom along the horizontal axes. It is stiff in rotation about the vertical axes. A seismometer is used to sense table motion. Piezo actuators are used to suppress seismic noise with feedback control bandwidth of 0.3 to 3 Hz. Suppression levels ranging from 21 to 36 dB of seismic noise within the frequency range of 0.5 to 1.3 Hz are demonstrated, as measured by a witness seismometer on the table, with the suppression direction along the axis of the longitudinal translation of the suspended mirror on the table. The suppression results in 1 $\mathrm{\mathrm{nm/\sqrt{Hz}}}$ residual horizontal motion at 1 Hz. Limitations such as tilt-to-translation coupling that prevent actuation over the desired range of 0.03 to 3 Hz are discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 Emission from within the plunging region of black hole accretion flows has recently been detected in two X-ray binary systems. There is, furthermore, a possible discrepancy between the inferred spins of gravitational wave and electromagnetically detected black holes. Motivated by these two results we demonstrate, using theoretical calculations, numerical simulations and observational data, that the inclusion of emission from within the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) results in a black hole with a low spin producing a thermal continuum X-ray spectrum that mimics that produced by a much more rapidly rotating black hole surrounded by a disk with no emission from within the ISCO. We demonstrate this explicitly using the observed X-ray spectrum of a canonical soft-state high mass X-ray binary system M33 X-7. A vanishing ISCO temperature model requires a high spin $a_\bullet = 0.84\pm0.05$, as has been found previously in the literature. However, a disk around a Schwarzschild black hole can equally well (in fact slightly better) describe the data, provided that photons emitted from within the plunging region are included, and the ISCO stress is in line with that seen in numerical simulations of the accretion process. We then present an analysis of two further soft-state X-ray binaries (MAXI J1820+070 and MAXI J0637$-$430) which require the presence of intra-ISCO emission at high statistical significance. These two sources sit on the low-spin moderate-stress part of the degeneracy exhibited by M33 X-7, suggesting that when high quality data are available the high-spin low-stress region of parameter space is ruled out. We discuss how future advances in numerical simulations and data modelling will be essential to determining the spin of X-ray binary black holes which may well be systematically lower than current continuum fitting methods suggest.

 - **Abstract**
 We derive the star formation history (SFH) and chemical evolution history (CEH) of the Ursa Minor (UMi) dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dSph). We detect two distinct stellar populations that exist over 6 times half-light radius from its center. The results are obtained by applying a newly developed algorithm to the deep and wide-field photometric dataset taken with Hyper Suprime-Cam on the Subaru Telescope. The algorithm employs the genetic algorithm and the simulated annealing to minimize a $\chi^{2}$ value between the observed color-magnitude diagram (CMD) and synthetic CMD generated from the stellar isochrones. The age and metallicity resolutions are set to $0.5$ Gyr and $0.1$ dex, respectively. The accuracy assessment with mock galaxies shows that it returns the peaks of metallicity distributions and star formation period within 1 $\sigma$ of input value in the case of a single population. In tests with two populations, two distinct metallicity peaks are identified without an offset from the input values, indicating the robustness of this algorithm. The detected two populations in the UMi dSph have the metallicity peaks of [Fe/H] = $-2.2$ and $-2.5$; the metal-rich population started its star formation about 1 Gyr later than the metal-poor one. The SFH of both metal-rich and metal-poor populations varies with distance from the center of the UMi dSph, without any age-gradients. These results suggest that the UMi dSph underwent a complex formation process, contrary to the simple formation history of dwarf galaxies previously thought.

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of compact millimeter (mm) continuum emission from radio-quiet AGNs (RQAGNs) is still not fully understood. Changing-state AGNs (CSAGNs) display rapid and strong variability, which can allow us to investigate the origin of the mm emission. We present here the results of the first study of the mm continuum variability of a CSAGN using archival ALMA band 6 ($\sim 230$ GHz) observations of NGC 1566 obtained in 2014-2023. We find a positive correlation between the mm and X-ray flux with an intrinsic scatter of 0.05 dex ($1\sigma$), suggesting a common origin. The mm spectral index ($\alpha_{\rm mm}$) is found in the range of $0.13\pm0.38$ to $-0.26\pm0.53$, consistent with a compact optically thick synchrotron source. No significant correlation was found between the $\alpha_{\rm mm}$ and the mm flux. The mm/X-ray ratio also shows no clear link to the Eddington ratio but is higher in the low-accretion state. We discuss several scenarios about the origin of the mm emission in NGC 1566. We find that synchrotron emission in the magnetized X-ray corona appears to be the most probable origin of mm emission, confirming that mm emission can be used as a tracer of AGN activity in RQAGNs.

 - **Abstract**
 This study investigates the radio spectral properties of \textit{K}$_{S}$-selected star-forming galaxies (SFGs) in the XMM-LSS field using extensive multiwavelength data. By employing various diagnostics, SFGs are distinguished from quiescent galaxies and AGN across seven redshift bins ($\rm{0.1\leq\,\textit{z}\,\leq\,3.0}$). The broadband radio frequency spectral energy distribution is analysed at observer-frame frequencies from 144 to 1500 MHz using median stacking techniques correcting for median flux boosting. We investigate the relationship between the radio spectral index, $\alpha$ (where $S\propto\nu^{\alpha}$) and redshift ($z$). Our analysis reveals no significant inverse correlation between $\alpha$ and $z$, indicating that the radio spectrum remains independent with varying redshift. We fit the stacked median radio SEDs with a power law (\textit{PL}), curved power law (\textit{CPL}) and double power law (\textit{DPL}) models. For the \textit{DPL} and \textit{CPL} models, we observe a consistent steepening of the low-frequency spectral index across all redshift bins. For the \textit{CPL} model, the curvature term $q$ is greater than zero in all redshift bins. Model comparisons indicate that spectra are generally well fitted by all the models considered. At 1500 MHz, SFGs display both a steep synchrotron component and a flat free-free emission component, with a thermal fraction consistently around 11$\%$ to 18$\%$. Further deep radio observations, with higher resolution to better deal with source blending and confusion noise and wider frequency coverage to better separate non-thermal and thermal radio emission, are required to reveal the detailed physical processes, thus clarifying the nature of radio sources.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the origin and evolution of magnetic fields on cosmological scales opens up a window into the physics of the early Universe. Numerical simulations of such fields require a careful treatment to faithfully solve the equations of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) without introducing numerical artefacts. In this paper, we study the growth of the magnetic fields in controlled kinematic dynamo setups using both smoothed particle hydrodynamics implementations in the SWIFT code. We assess the quality of the reconstructed solution in the Roberts flow case against the reference implementation in the Pencil code and find generally a good agreement. Similarly, we reproduce the known features of the more complex ABC flow. Using a simple induction-diffusion balance model to analyse the results, we construct an "overwinding" trigger metric to locally detect regions where the magnetic diffusion cannot counteract the expected induction because of limitations in the method's ability to resolve magnetic field gradients. This metric is then used to identify the necessary resolution and resistivity levels to counteract the overwinding problem. We finally apply this metric to adiabatic cosmological simulations and discuss the resolution requirements needed to resolve the growth of the primordial fields without artefacts.

 - **Abstract**
 During the early stages of star formation, accretion processes such as infall from the envelope and molecular streamers, and ejection of matter through winds and jets take place simultaneously. The Class 0/I binary [BHB2007] 11 shows evidence for accretion and ejection at the scales of the circumbinary disk and the inner close binary. Recent H$_2$CO observations showed two elongated structures with hints of outflowing motion almost perpendicular to the main CO outflow, which is launched from the circumbinary disk. With the aim of verifying the nature of these elongated structures, we analyze the line emission of H$^{13}$CO$^+$, CCH, c-C$_3$H$_2$ and SiO observed with ALMA within the Large Program FAUST. These molecules trace material moving at velocities close to the ambient cloud velocity. The images of H$^{13}$CO$^+$, CCH, c-C$_3$H$_2$ show the elongated structures, whose gas kinematics are consistent with outflowing motions and with rotation in the opposite sense to the main CO outflow. The derived mass loss rate from these large-scale structures is $(1.8\pm0.5)\times10^{-6}M_{\odot}\textrm{ yr}^{-1}$, in agreement with those measured in outflows driven by Class 0/I protostars. The SiO image reveals compact emission close to the binary system, with a slight elongation aligned with the larger-scale structures. This suggests that SiO is released from the sputtering of dust grains in the shocked material at the base of the potential new outflow, with a relative abundance of $\geq(0.11-2.0)\times10^{-9}$. However, higher angular and spectral resolution observations are needed to accurately estimate the outflow launching radius and its powering source. Given the location and the abundance of the SiO emission, we propose that the second outflow may be launched from inside the circumbinary disk, likely by the less massive companion, which is actively accreting material from its surroundings.

 - **Abstract**
 Polarization behaviour shows a transition in the pulsar population, where energetic sources with higher spin-down energy loss, $\dot{E} > 10^{34}$ erg~s$^{-1}$, often have fractional linear polarisation ($L/I$) close to 100\%, while below this range $L/I$ is usually lower than 50\%. The polarisation behaviour has been primarily studied at higher frequencies above 1 GHz, and in this work we explore the single pulse polarisation behaviour in pulsars with $\dot{E} > 5\times10^{33}$ erg~s$^{-1}$ at a lower frequency range of 300-750 MHz. The polarisation behaviour can be divided into two categories, the first with $L/I>$ 70\% where the polarisation position angle (PPA) follows a single track, and a second group with $L/I <$ 70\% and scattered PPA behaviour with or without orthogonal modes. However, there are some single pulses in the first category that also have lower $L/I$ and exhibit the presence of two polarisation modes along orthogonal tracks. The radio emission in pulsars arises due to coherent curvature radiation (CCR) from charge bunches, which develops due to non-linear instabilities in the pulsar plasma forming charge separated envelope solitons. The CCR excites orthogonally polarised X and O modes oriented perpendicular and parallel to the magnetic field line planes, that detach in the plasma and propagate independently. The O-mode is seven times stronger than the X-mode but gets damped in the medium. We show that incoherent mixing of the X and O modes with different levels of damping can reproduce the observed polarisation features in the energetic pulsar population.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new method for estimating galaxy cluster masses using weak-lensing magnification. The effect of weak-lensing magnification introduces a correlation between the position of foreground galaxy clusters and the density of background sources. Therefore, cluster masses can be inferred through observations of these correlations. In this work, we introduce a method that allows us to considerably reduce noise correlations between different radial bins of the cluster magnification signal via a Wiener filtering of our observed magnification field on large scales. This method can reduce the uncertainty on the estimated galaxy cluster mass and it can also be applied to cluster mass estimation for weak-lensing shear. The method was applied to Hyper-Suprime Cam galaxies and CAMIRA clusters detected within the Hyper-Suprime Cam survey (HSC). With HSC data, we find that our filtering method significantly reduces the correlation of noise between radial magnification bins. The estimated cluster mass is consistent between the filtered and unfiltered methods, with similar errors between the two methods as our current measurement errors contain significant contributions from the irreducible shot-noise. For deeper surveys, the effects of shot noise will be less important and this method will lead to greater improvements on the estimated cluster mass.
