 - **Abstract**
 The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), with its extensive optical monitoring capabilities, has provided an unprecedented opportunity to study the long-term variability of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). In this work, we present a comparative analysis of optical colour and brightness variability for $\mathrm{log(L_{Bol})}-z$ matched samples, consisting of 2095 Narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies similar to Broad-line Seyfert 1s (NLSy1_A) and 538 NLSy1_B galaxies matched with quasars (QSOs). The corresponding respective control samples of consist of 2380 Broad-line Seyfert 1 (BLSy1) galaxies and 741 QSOs. Using over six years of r-band and g-band light curves from the ZTF Data Release 22 (DR22), we characterize flux variability, fractional flux variability, and amplitude of temporal variability for each source in the samples. Our results indicate that BLSy1 galaxies exhibit significantly stronger variability compared to NLSy1_As, and similarly, QSOs show more variability than do NLSy1_Bs. To probe colour variability, we utilize quasi-simultaneous light curves, with half-hour epoch differences between $g$- and $r$-band measurements where colour index was evaluated using linear regression in magnitude-magnitude space. We find that large majorities of these sources -- 96% of NLSy1_A, 95% of BLSy1, 94% of NLSy1_B, and 91% of QSOs -- exhibit a clear "bluer-when-brighter" (BWB) trend. Furthermore, rest-frame structure function analysis reveals that BLSy1 galaxies are $1.42\pm0.06$ times more variable than NLSy1_A, while QSOs are $1.41\pm0.01$ times more variable than NLSy1_B. These results can provide valuable insights into the variability properties of AGN subclasses and their underlying physical drivers.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the presence of supermassive black hole (SMBH) binary signatures and the feasibility of identifying them through X-ray reflection spectra. The X-ray emitting region is modeled as a set of two mini-disks bound to the individual SMBHs separated by 100 $GM/c^2$ and the spectra calculated as a function of the mass, mass ratio, and total accretion rate of the binary. The X-ray reflection features are strongly influenced by the accretion-inversion phenomenon expected in SMBH binaries, which results in a wide range of ionization conditions in the two mini-disks. These are imprinted in the resulting composite spectra and the double-peaked and time-variable relativistic Fe K$\alpha$ line profiles. To test whether these features can be used as evidence for the presence of an SMBH binary, we fit mock 100\,ks observations with a single AGN model. For a $10^9$ $M_\odot$ binary targeted by Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs), at $z=0.1$ the single AGN model clearly fails to fit the data, while at $z=1$ the fit is acceptable but unable to converge on the SMBH spin. For a $10^6$ $M_\odot$ binary, a progenitor of a \textit{Laser Interferometer Space Antenna} (\textit{LISA}) source, spectral fitting is only possible at $z=0.1$, with the outcomes similar to the PTA binary at $z=1$. We also find that PTA binaries can be expected to show a distinct X-ray spectral variability in multi-epoch observations, whereas for \textit{LISA} precursors, orbital averaging results in the loss of spectral variability signatures.

 - **Abstract**
 Protoplanetary disks around luminous young A-type stars are prime observational laboratories to determine the abundances of complex organic molecules (COMs) present during planet formation. In contrast to their lower stellar mass counterparts, these warmer disks contain the sublimation fronts of complex molecules such as CH3OH on spatial scales accessible with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). We present ALMA observations of the Herbig Ae disk HD 100453 that uncover a rich reservoir of COMs sublimating from the dust cavity edge. In addition to CH3OH, we detect 13CH3OH for the first time in a Class II disk, revealing a factor of three enhancement of 13C in the disk large organics. A tentative detection of CH2DOH is also reported, resulting in a D/H of 1-2%, which is consistent with the expected deuterium enhancement from the low temperature CH3OH formation in molecular clouds and with the deuteration of CH3OH measured in comets. The detection of methyl-formate (CH3OCHO), at only a few percent level of CH3OH is an order of magnitude lower compared to claims towards other organic-rich Herbig Ae disks but is more in line with organic abundance patterns towards the earlier stages of star formation. Together these data provide multiple lines of evidence that disks, and therefore the planet and comet-forming materials, contain inherited interstellar ices and perhaps the strongest evidence to date that much of the interstellar organic ice composition survives the early stages of planet formation.
#### Long-term multiwavelength observations of 1ES 1218+304: physical implications of the flux and spectral variability

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents the results of a detailed timing and spectral analysis of the TeV-detected blazar 1ES 1218+304, focused on the observations performed with the different instruments onboard the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory in the period 2005-2024. The source showed various strengths of X-ray flaring activity and 0.3-10\,keV states differing by a factor up to 20 in brightness, exceeding a level of 2.7$\times$10$^{-10}$erg cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ and representing the 3rd brightest blazar during the strongest flare. We detected tens of intraday variability instances, the majority of which occurred on sub-hour timescales and were consistent with the shock-in-jet scenario. The spectral properties were strongly and fastly variable, characterized by a frequent occurrence of very hard photon indices in the 0.3-10 keV and Fermi 0.3-300 GeV bands. The source exhibited very fast transitions of logparabolic-to-powerlaw spectra or conversely, possibly caused by changes of magnetic field properties over small spatial scales or by turbulence-driven relativistic magnetic reconnection. We detected various spectral features, which demonstrate the importance of the first-order Fermi mechanism operating by the magnetic field of changing confinement efficiencies and by the electron populations with different initial energy distributions, stochastic acceleration and cooling processes. In some periods, the source showed a softening at higher GeV-band energies, possibly due to the inverse-Compton upscatter of X-ray photons in the Klein-Nishina regime reflected in the positive correlation between X-ray and high-energy emissions.
#### What determines the brightness of magnetically open solar corona?: Insights from three-dimensional radiative MHD simulations and observations

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the relationship between solar coronal holes and open-field regions using three-dimensional radiative magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations combined with remote-sensing observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). Our numerical simulations reveal that magnetically open regions in the corona can exhibit brightness comparable to quiet regions, challenging the conventional view that open-field regions are inherently dark coronal holes. We find that the coronal brightness is primarily determined by the total energy input from photospheric magnetic activities, such as the small-scale dynamo, rather than differences in dissipative processes within the corona. Using synthesized EUV intensity maps, we show that brightness thresholds commonly used to identify coronal holes may overlook open-field regions, especially at lower spatial resolutions. Observational analysis utilizing SDO/HMI and AIA synoptic maps supports our simulation results, demonstrating that magnetic field extrapolation techniques, such as the Potential Field Source Surface (PFSS) model, are sensitive to the chosen parameters, including the source surface height. We suggest that discrepancies in estimates of open magnetic flux (the ``open flux problem'') arise both from the modeling assumptions in coronal magnetic field extrapolation and systematic biases in solar surface magnetic field observations. Our findings indicate the need for reconsidering criteria used to identify coronal holes as indicators of open-field regions to better characterize the solar open magnetic flux.
#### Out on a Limb: The Signatures of East-West Asymmetries in Transmission Spectra from General Circulation Models

 - **Abstract**
 In the era of JWST, observations of hot Jupiter atmospheres are becoming increasingly precise. As a result, the signature of limb asymmetries due to temperature or abundance differences and the presence of aerosols can now be directly measured using transmission spectroscopy. Using a grid of general circulation models (GCMs) with varying irradiation temperature (1500 K - 4000 K) and prescriptions of cloud formation, we simulate 3D ingress/egress and morning/evening-limb transmission spectra. We aim to assess the impact that clouds, 3D temperature structure, and non-uniform distribution of gases have on the observed spectra, and how these inhomogeneities can be identified. A second goal is to assess the relative merits of two separate methods (ingress/egress v.s. morning/evening-limb spectroscopy) for isolating atmospheric asymmetries. From our models, it is evident that an east-west temperature difference is the leading order effect for producing ingress/egress or morning/evening-limb spectral differences. We additionally find that clouds contribute strongly to the observed limb asymmetry at moderate irradiation temperatures in our grid ($\sim 2000 \mathrm{K} < T_{\mathrm{irr}} < 3500 \mathrm{K}). At lower temperatures clouds equally dominate the optical depth on both limbs, while at higher temperatures the entire terminator region remains cloud-free. We develop limb asymmetry metrics that can be used to assess the degree of east-west asymmetry for a given planet and predict trends in these metrics with respect to irradiation temperature that are indicative of various physical processes. Our results are useful for predicting and diagnosing the signatures of limb asymmetries in JWST spectra.
#### The LUNIS-AGN Catalog: Trends of emission line velocity dispersion and surface brightness within the circumnuclear regions of Seyfert galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 We present a catalog of Local Universe Near-Infrared Seyfert (LUNIS) \textit{K-}band integral field unit (IFU) data of 88 nearby Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), curated from SINFONI/VLT and OSIRIS/Keck archival datasets. This catalog includes both type 1 and 2 Seyfert AGN probed down to scales of tens of parsecs with z $<$ 0.02 and spanning over five orders of magnitude in L$_{14-195keV}$ AGN luminosity. As part of this catalog we make publicly available for all galaxies the processed datacubes, a central 200 pc integrated spectrum, and two-dimensional maps of flux, velocity, and velocity dispersion for H$_2$ 1-0 S(1) 2.1218 $\mu$m, [Si VI] 1.9641 $\mu$m, and Br-$\gamma$ 2.1655 $\mu$m. The morphology and geometry of [Si VI], a tracer of AGN outflows, are reported for the 66$\%$ of galaxies with extended emission. We utilize this large sample to probe the behavior of molecular and ionized gas, identifying trends in the properties of the circumnuclear gas (surface brightness and velocity dispersion) with fundamental AGN properties (obscuration and X-ray luminosity). While there is significant variation in circumnuclear gas characteristics across the sample, we find molecular hydrogen to be less centrally concentrated and exhibit lower velocity dispersion relative to ionized gas. In addition, we find elevated molecular hydrogen surface brightness and decreased [Si VI] velocity dispersion in obscured relative to unobscured AGN. The [Si VI] and Br-$\gamma$ emission scale with L$_{14-195keV}$ X-ray luminosity, which, along with the elevated velocity dispersion compared to the molecular gas, verifies an association with AGN outflow processes.

 - **Abstract**
 When binaries are injected into low-angular-momentum orbits around a central supermassive black hole (SMBH), various outcomes can occur, including binary tidal breakup, double stellar disruptions and stellar collision. We use hydrodynamical simulations to study stellar collisions triggered by binary-SMBH encounters, examining both head-on and grazing collisions in deep ($\beta_b=5$) and gentle ($\beta_b=0.6$) encounters, where $\beta_b$ is the ratio of the binary tidal disruption radius to the binary pericenter distance to the SMBH. Head-on collisions consistently result in appreciable mass loss ($\sim 5\%$) and a single merger remnant. Grazing collisions in deep encounters typically leave two strongly disturbed stars with comparable mass loss, while in gentle encounters, multiple collisions eventually produce a single remnant with minimal mass loss ($\lesssim 1\%$). All merger remnants feature extended envelopes, making them susceptible to partial tidal disruptions when they return to the SMBH. The morphology and orbital energy distribution of collision-induced debris differ significantly from those of tidal disruption event (TDE) debris of single stars. Approximately half of the collision-generated debris falls back onto the SMBH, exhibiting a distinct time evolution of the fallback rate. We suggest that such mass loss and fallback can generate electromagnetic flares that mimic weak TDEs.

 - **Abstract**
 Dusty stellar point sources are a significant stage in stellar evolution and contribute to the metal enrichment of galaxies. These objects can be classified using photometric and spectroscopic observations with color-magnitude diagrams (CMD) and infrared excesses in spectral energy distributions (SED). We employed supervised machine learning spectral classification to categorize dusty stellar sources, including young stellar objects (YSOs) and evolved stars (oxygen- and carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch stars, AGBs), red supergiants (RSGs), and post-AGB (PAGB) stars in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, based on spectroscopic labeled data from the Surveying the Agents of Galaxy Evolution (SAGE) project, which used 12 multiwavelength filters and 618 stellar objects. Despite missing values and uncertainties in the SAGE spectral datasets, we achieved accurate classifications. To address small and imbalanced spectral catalogs, we used the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to generate synthetic data points. Among models applied before and after data augmentation, the Probabilistic Random Forest (PRF), a tuned Random Forest (RF), achieved the highest total accuracy, reaching $\mathbf{89\%}$ based on recall in categorizing dusty stellar sources. Using SMOTE does not improve the best model's accuracy for the CAGB, PAGB, and RSG classes; it remains $\mathbf{100\%}$, $\mathbf{100\%}$, and $\mathbf{88\%}$, respectively, but shows variations for OAGB and YSO classes. We also collected photometric labeled data similar to the training dataset, classifying them using the top four PRF models with over $\mathbf{87\%}$ accuracy. Multiwavelength data from several studies were classified using a consensus model integrating four top models to present common labels as final predictions.

 - **Abstract**
 Multi-line spectropolarimetric observations allow for the simultaneous inference of the magnetic field at different layers of the solar atmosphere and provide insight into how these layers are magnetically coupled. The new upgrade of the Gregor Infrared Spectrograph (GRIS) instrument offers such a possibility, allowing for the simultaneous observation of the Ca II line at 8542 A, the Si I line at 10827 A, and the He I triplet at 10830 A in addition to some additional weaker spectral lines that can probe deeper in the photosphere. Because these spectral lines are sensitive to the plasma properties at different regions of the solar atmosphere, their combined analysis can help understand the stratification of its thermal and magnetic properties from the photosphere to the chromosphere. This work showcases recent observations of the upgraded GRIS at the active region AR13724, which shows the instrument's potential for unravelling the most minute details of solar phenomena. In particular, we analyse the spatial distribution of the polarisation signals as well as the distribution of Stokes profiles for different regimes of the magnetic field strength. We also conduct a preliminary data analysis using relatively simple and approximate methods.
#### The impact of ultraviolet suppression on the rates and properties of strongly lensed Type IIn supernovae detected by LSST

 - **Abstract**
 Upcoming wide-field time-domain surveys, such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) are expected to discover up to two orders of magnitude more strongly lensed supernovae per year than have so far been observed. Of these, Type IIn supernovae have been predicted to be detected more frequently than any other supernova type, despite their small relative detection fraction amongst non-lensed supernovae. However, previous studies that predict a large population of lensed Type IIn supernova detections model their time evolving spectrum as a pure blackbody. In reality, there is a deficit in the UV flux of supernovae relative to the blackbody continuum due to line-blanketing from iron-group elements in the ejecta and scattering effects. In this work we quantify the effect of this UV suppression on the detection rates by LSST of a simulated population of strongly lensed Type IIn supernovae, relative to a pure blackbody model, using a mock LSST observing run. With a blackbody model, we predict to detect $\sim$70 lensed Type IIn supernova per year with LSST. By modelling a similar UV deficit to that seen in superluminous supernovae, we recover 60 - 80% of the detections obtained using a pure blackbody model, of which $\sim$10 detections per year are sufficiently bright ($m_\textrm{i} < 22.5$ mag) and detected early enough (> 5 observations before lightcurve peak) to enable high-cadence spectroscopic follow up.
#### Feasibility of Self-Calibration for ngVLA Dynamic Range Requirements

 - **Abstract**
 The ngVLA is a new interferometric radio astronomy facility with transformative capabilities, being developed by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory. It combines two orders of magnitude in frequency coverage, over 1.2 - 116 GHz, with unprecedented sensitivity, spatial resolution and spatial frequency coverage, opening up new discovery space, impacting nearly every area of astrophysics. The high sensitivity that enables the path breaking science goals, which in turn lead to stringent instrument requirements, also open up new approaches to meeting them, previously only possible in limited contexts. Chief among the requirements are the image dynamic range specifications of 45 dB and 35 dB at 8 GHz and 27 GHz in single pointing and mosaiced observations. As the baseline calibration strategy to meet these requirements, we leverage the high ngVLA sensitivity through routine use of self-calibration on short time scales to counter atmospheric delay fluctuations. We recognize the broader nature of the problem - requiring a certain dynamic range, DR, at a targeted science noise level {\sigma}_science presupposes the presence of bright emission in the field at a corresponding level of detected interferometric flux of \sim DR \times {\sigma}_science, by definition. With the problem posed broadly in this way, one can derive a general limit without recourse to background source counts and the attendant Poisson fluctuations of their occurrence, and which depends only on the number of antennas in the array and the science noise level of the observation, independent of the observing band, primary beam size and antenna SEFDs. This memo formally explores these ideas as the main strategy to achieve the ngVLA image dynamic range requirements.

As the baseline calibration strategy to meet these requirements, we leverage the high ngVLA sensitivity through routine use of self-calibration on short time scales to counter atmospheric delay fluctuations and pointing self-calibration to correct for pointing errors. A key benefit of leveraging self-calibration techniques, where possible, is the a reduction in system complexity of a range of subsystems, which in turn improves system reliability. Self-calibration also promises the possibility of attaining thermal noise limited dynamic range performance in some cases. This presentation provides the bases for these approaches, illustrating them to make the case for their application to the ngVLA in parallel.

 - **Abstract**
 Measurement of environmental parameters is one of the basic requirements for the proper operation of a telescope. This memo is intended to provide guidance for the measurement accuracy requirements in the context of the ngVLA. It relies on previous work for ALMA (Mangum, 2001) and EVLA (Butler \& Perley, 2008) and a review of the subject by Mangum \& Wallace (2015). The local operational environment can be broadly divided into two categories: electromagnetic and physical. Meteorological parameters (weather) primarily constitute the physical environmental component and radio frequency interference (RFI) is the essential element of the electromagnetic environment. This memo focuses on the weather component and does not address the RFI, safety and physical infrastructure components. Under weather, the relevant topics are (1) the correction to pointing arising from refraction in the atmosphere (2) the different delays in the arrival times of signals at different antennas due to propagation in the atmosphere (3) monitoring weather parameters to provide operations support, e.g. in determining prevalence of precision or normal conditions, dynamic scheduling and the choice of antennas to constitute a sub-array with a given set of characteristics, among others, and (4) archival. Here we restrict ourselves to the first two topics which impact the data obtained and its calibration.
#### The galaxy bias profile of cosmic voids

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic voids are underdense regions within the large-scale structure of the Universe, spanning a wide range of physical scales - from a few megaparsecs (Mpc) to the largest observable structures. Their distinctive properties make them valuable cosmological probes and unique laboratories for galaxy formation studies. A key aspect to investigate in this context is the galaxy bias, $b$, within voids - that is, how galaxies in these underdense regions trace the underlying dark-matter density field. We want to measure the dependence of the large-scale galaxy bias on the distance to the void center, and to evaluate whether this bias profile varies with the void properties and identification procedure. We apply a void identification scheme based on spherical overdensities to galaxy data from the IllustrisTNG magnetohydrodynamical simulation. For the clustering measurement, we use an object-by-object estimate of large-scale galaxy bias, which offers significant advantages over the standard method based on ratios of correlation functions or power spectra. We find that the average large-scale bias of galaxies inside voids tends to increase with void-centric distance when normalized by the void radius. For the entire galaxy population within voids, the average bias rises with the density of the surrounding environment and, consequently, decreases with increasing void size. Due to this environmental dependence, the average galaxy bias inside S-type voids - embedded in large-scale overdense regions - is significantly higher ($\langle b\rangle_{\rm in} > 0$) at all distances compared to R-type voids, which are surrounded by underdense regions ($\langle b\rangle_{\rm in} < 0$). The bias profile for S-type voids is also slightly steeper. Since both types of voids host halo populations of similar mass, the measured difference in bias can be interpreted as a secondary bias effect.

 - **Abstract**
 The 21cm forest, narrow absorption features in the spectra of high redshift radio sources caused by intervening neutral hydrogen, offers a unique probe of the intergalactic medium and small-scale structures during reionization. While traditional power spectrum methods have been widely used for analyzing the 21cm forest, these techniques are limited in capturing the non-Gaussian nature of the signal. In this work, we introduce the Wavelet Scattering Transform (WST) as a novel diagnostic tool for the 21cm forest, which allows for the extraction of higher-order statistical features that power spectrum methods cannot easily capture. By decomposing simulated brightness temperature spectra into a hierarchy of scattering coefficients, the WST isolates both local intensity fluctuations (first-order coefficients) and scale-scale correlations (second-order coefficients), revealing the complex, multi-scale non-Gaussian interactions inherent in the 21cm forest. This approach enhances the power of 21cm forest in distinguishing between different cosmological models, such as Cold Dark Matter (CDM) and Warm Dark Matter (WDM), as well as scenarios with enhanced X-ray heating. Unlike traditional methods, which focus primarily on Gaussian statistics, the WST captures richer astrophysical and cosmological information. Our analysis shows that WST can significantly improve constraints on key parameters, such as the X-ray heating efficiency and the WDM particle mass, providing deeper insights into the early stages of cosmic structure formation.

 - **Abstract**
 We performed star counts in the region of the open cluster NGC 3532. The ranges of trigonometric parallaxes and proper motions containing all the stars of the cluster were determined using the stars with 5- and 6-parameter Gaia DR3 solutions. The estimated radius of the cluster was R_c=178+-3 arcminutes and the number of cluster stars was N_c=2200+-40. We estimate the number of stars with poor astrometric solutions that may be members of the cluster. For this purpose, we analyze the surface density distribution of stars with two-parameter Gaia DR3 solutions, stars with the parameter RUWE>1.4, and stars with large relative errors of trigonometric parallaxes in the vicinity of the cluster. We are looking for stars that fall within the area of the color-magnitude diagram occupied by probable members of the NGC 3532 cluster from the Hant&Reffert sample. The radial surface density profile plotted with such stars shows the concentration of stars toward the cluster center. An analysis of the profile yields an estimate of 2150+-230 stars that may be cluster members. Thus, nearly one half of cluster members can be lost when the probable members are selected only by exact astrometric data of Gaia DR3. Among these lost stars, there may be a significant number of unresolved binary and multiple systems.

 - **Abstract**
 We have discovered a substantial sodium doublet (Na D $\lambda\lambda$5890, 5896Å)-traced neutral outflow in a quenching galaxy JADES-GS-206183 at $z=1.317$ in GOODS-S field. Its JWST NIRSpec/MSA spectrum shows a significantly blueshifted and deep Na D absorption, revealing a neutral outflow with a velocity of $v_{\rm out}=828^{+79}_{-49}\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ and a mass outflow rate of $\log(\dot{M}_{\rm out}/\mathrm{M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}})=2.40^{+0.11}_{-0.16}$. The mass outflow rate of this outflow is higher than any of the neutral outflows identified previously beyond $z\sim1$ by the same line diagnostic and is comparable with those in local galaxies with extremely strong star formation activities or luminous AGN. Nonetheless, the best-fit SED modeling of JADES-GS-206183, based on its multi-band photometry from HST/ACS to JWST/NIRCam, suggests that the host galaxy now is quenched, and the Paschen $\alpha$ (Pa$\alpha$) emission in the FRESCO NIRCam grism spectrum confirms its current low star formation rate ($10.78\pm 0.55\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}}$). More surprisingly, optical line ratio diagnostics indicate that the current AGN activity of JADES-GS-206183, if present, is weak. Even though we tentatively detect a broad component of the H$\alpha$ line, it is more likely tracing the ionized outflow than an AGN. The results demonstrate that the Na D outflow in JADES-GS-206183 is highly unlikely to be driven by current star formation or nuclear activity. Instead, we propose that the outflow that we are witnessing in JADES-GS-206183 may be a long-lasting fossil outflow, powered by previous AGN activity that has recently shut down.

 - **Abstract**
 Once per 10,000-100,000 years, an unlucky star may experience a close encounter with a supermassive black hole (SMBH), partially or fully tearing apart the star in an exceedingly brief, bright interaction called a tidal disruption event (TDE). Remnants of partial TDEs are expected to be plentiful in our Galactic Center, where at least six unexplained, diffuse, star-like "G objects" have already been detected which may have formed via interactions between stars and the SMBH. Using numerical simulations, this work aims to identify the characteristics of TDE remnants. We take 3D hydrodynamic FLASH models of partially disrupted stars and map them into the 1D stellar evolution code MESA to examine the properties of these remnants from tens to billions of years after the TDE. The remnants initially exhibit a brief, highly luminous phase, followed by an extended cooling period as they return to stable hydrogen burning. During the initial stage (< 10,000 yr) their luminosities increase by orders of magnitude, making them intriguing candidates to explain a fraction of the mysterious G objects. Notably, mild TDEs are the most common and result in the brightest remnants during this initial phase. However, most remnants exist in a long-lived stage where they are only modestly offset in temperature and luminosity compared to main-sequence stars of equivalent mass. Nonetheless, our results indicate remnants will sustain abnormal, metal-enriched envelopes that may be discernible through spectroscopic analysis. Identifying TDE survivors within the Milky Way could further illuminate some of the most gravitationally intense encounters in the Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the X-ray polarization properties of the high-synchrotron-peaked BL Lac H 1426+428, based on two-epoch observational data from the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). For the first observation, only an upper limit of polarization degree ($\Pi_{\rm X}$), $\Pi_{\rm X}<19.5\%$, at the 99\% confidence level (C.L.) is determined. In contrast, for the second observation, we derive $\Pi_{\rm X}=20.6\%\pm2.9\%$ with a polarization angle ($\psi_{\rm X}$) of $\psi_{\rm X}=116.1^{\circ}\pm4.1^{\circ}$ at a C.L. of 7.1 $\sigma$. The time-resolved and energy-resolved polarization analysis reveals no significant variation in $\psi_{\rm X}$ and no detectable polarization within narrower energy bins for the first observation, while the polarization during the second observation is predominantly dominated by low-energy photons. Furthermore, the X-rays during the second observation are found to be in a higher flux state with a harder spectrum compared to that observed during the first observation, consistent with a {\it harder-when-brighter} behavior. We propose that the plasma responsible for the X-ray emission during the first observation propagates downstream and encounters a shock, leading to electron acceleration and more ordered of the magnetic fields. The enhanced X-ray emission observed during the second observation is produced by shock-accelerated electrons within an ordered magnetic field region via synchrotron radiation. No significant detection of polarization during the first IXPE observation may be due to the limited number of detected photons.

 - **Abstract**
 The thorough understanding on the initiation of coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which is manifested as a slow rise of pre-eruptive structures before the impulsive ejection in kinematics, is the key for forecasting the solar eruptions. In our previous work, we showed that the slow rise of a hot flux rope with coronal mass density is caused by the moderate magnetic reconnection occurring in the hyperbolic flux tube (HFT) combined with the torus instability. However, it remains unclear how the initiation process varies when a filament is present in the pre-eruptive flux rope. In this work, we reveal the complete initiation route of a CME containing filament mass with a state-of-the-art full-magnetohydrodynamics simulation. The comprehensive analyses show that the filament mass has an important impact on the CME initiation through triggering and driving the slow rise of flux rope with its drainage, besides the contributions of HFT reconnection and torus instability. Finally, in combination with our previous work, we propose that the enhanced drainage of filament mass and various features related to the HFT reconnection, such as, the split of pre-eruptive structure and the pre-flare loops and X-ray emissions, can serve as the precursors of CME initiation in observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Laboratory searching for dark matter is crucial for understanding several fundamental conundrums in physics and cosmology. Most cavity-based haloscope searches focus on the frequency range below 10 GHz, while the parameter space with higher frequency remains rarely explored, due to the challenges lying in the fabrication of microwave cavities. Here we report the first Q-band haloscope searching for dark photons with a 33.141 GHz cavity. A novel coupling tuning structure separated from the cavity was designed so as not to degrade the quality factor of the cavity. We have established the most stringent constraints $\chi<2.5\times10^{-12}$ at a confidence level of 90$\%$ in the frequency range from 33.139 GHz to 33.143 GHz, corresponding to the mass of dark photons ranging from 137.05 $\mu$eV to 137.07 $\mu$eV. The results surpass the previous astronomical constraints by nearly three orders of magnitude. This work has demonstrated the feasibility of dark matter haloscopes at Q band. In the future, the constraints can be further improved by more than one order of magnitude through low-temperature experiments, and the setup can be extended to search for axions, axion-like particles, and high-frequency gravitational waves.

 - **Abstract**
 The eruption of solar prominences can eject substantial mass and magnetic field into interplanetary space and cause geomagnetic storms. However, various questions about prominences and their eruption mechanism remain unclear. In particular, what causes the intriguing Doppler bullseye pattern in prominences has not yet been solved, despite some preliminary studies proposing that they are probably associated with counterstreaming mass flows. Previous studies are mainly based on single-angle and short timescale observations, making it difficult to determine the physical origin of Doppler bullseye patterns in prominences. Here, taking advantage of stereoscopic observations taken by the Solar Dynamics Observatory and the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory and a three-dimensional numerical simulation, we investigate the origin of prominence Doppler bullseye pattern by tracing a long-lived transequatorial filament/prominence from July 23 to August 4, 2012. We find that repeated coronal jets at one end of the prominence can launch the Doppler bullseye pattern. It is evidenced in our observations and simulation that during the forward traveling of jet plasma along the helical magnetic field structure of the prominence, part of the ejecting plasma can not pass through the apex of the prominence due to the insufficient kinetic energy and therefore forms a backward-moving mass flow along the same or neighboring magnetic field lines. This process finally forms counterstreaming mass flows in on-disk filaments. When the on-disk filament rotates to the solar limb to be a prominence, the counterstreaming mass flows are naturally observed as a Doppler bullseye pattern.

 - **Abstract**
 The prompt emission of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is supposed to be released from the relativistic jet launched from the central engine. Apart from the non-thermal nature of the spectra in a majority of GRBs, there is evidence for the presence of quasi-thermal components in the prompt emission of a few GRBs according to observations by Fermi satellite. On the other hand, the GRB jet has been revealed as structured in recent research. The theoretical observed spectra of photosphere emissions by an off-axis observer and the dependence of the spectra on the viewing angle under the assumption of structured jets remain unexplored. In this paper, we numerically calculate the instantaneous photosphere spectra by different viewing angles from a structured jet, from which relevant temporal and spectral characteristics are derived. Moreover, we address the necessity of proper treatment of the outflow boundary in the photosphere emission scenario. Furthermore, our calculations suggest that the Einstein Probe and Space-based multi-band astronomical Variable Object Monitor will have the capability to detect the short GRBs similar to GRB 170817A up to a luminosity distance of 200Mpc if the off-axis viewing angle is less than 10 degrees.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of infrared-bright dust-obscured galaxies (DOGs) with $(i - [22])_{\rm AB} \geq 7.0$. Using photometry from the deep and wide Ultraviolet Near-Infrared Optical Northern Survey, combined with near-IR and mid-IR data from the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, we successfully identified 382 DOGs in $\sim$ 170 deg$^2$. Among them, the vast majority (376 DOGs) were classified into two subclasses: bump DOGs (132/376) and power-law (PL) DOGs (244/376), which are dominated by star formation and active galactic nucleus (AGN), respectively. Through the SED analysis, we found that roughly half (120/244) of the PL DOGs show ``broken'' power-law SEDs. The significant red slope from optical to near-IR in the SEDs of these ``broken power-law DOGs'' (BPL DOGs) probably reflects their large amount of dust extinction. In other words, BPL DOGs are more heavily obscured AGNs, compared to PL DOGs with non-broken power-law SEDs.

 - **Abstract**
 Slow magnetoacoustic waves (SMAWs) have been considered in the past as a possible candidate for chromospheric heating. This study analyzes 20 active regions observed between 2012 and 2016 to examine the amplitude and energy flux variation of SMAWs in the umbral atmosphere. Six different wavelength channels from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory, covering regions from the photosphere to the low corona, were utilized for this purpose. The wave amplitude estimations show a gradual increase in 3-minute oscillation amplitude, peaking between 700--900 km, followed by a steady decrease; at altitudes greater than 1800 km, the amplitude appears to increase and then decrease again. The corresponding energy flux, on the other hand, displays a steady and monotonous decrease with a significant reduction in value from approximately $3.32 \pm 0.50~\mathrm{kW,m^{-2}}$ near the photosphere to about $(6.47 \pm 3.16) \times 10^{-4}~\mathrm{W,m^{-2}}$ at an altitude of 2585 km. This decay may be attributed to radiative damping and shock dissipation in the lower altitudes, and thermal conduction and viscosity in the higher altitudes. The missing flux is a factor of 3--15 lower than that required to counterbalance the chromospheric radiative losses.

 - **Abstract**
 Filaments are special plasma phenomena embedded in the solar atmosphere, characterized by unique thermodynamic properties and magnetic structures. Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations are useful to investigate the eruption mechanisms of filaments. We conduct a data-constrained zero-$\beta$ MHD simulation in spherical coordinates to investigate a C3.5 class flare triggered by an eruptive filament on 2022 August 15 in a decaying weak active region 13079. We reconstruct the three-dimensional coronal magnetic field using vector magnetograms and synoptic maps from the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (SDO/HMI). We transform vector magnetic field into Stonyhurst heliographic spherical coordinates combined with a synoptic map and constructed a potential field source surface (PFSS) model with a magnetic flux rope (MFR) embedded using the Regularized Biot--Savart Laws (RBSL). Subsequently, we conduct a spherical zero-$\beta$ MHD simulation using the Message Passing Interface Adaptive Mesh Refinement Versatile Advection Code (MPI-AMRVAC) and replicated the entire dynamic process of the filament eruption consistent with observations. With the calculation of time-distance profile, Qusai-Separatrix Layers (QSL), and synthetic radiation from simulated current density, we find a good agreement between our simulation and observations in terms of dynamics and magnetic topology. Technically, we provide a useful method of advanced data-constrained simulation of weak active regions in spherical coordinates. Scientifically, the model allows us to quantitatively describe and diagnose the entire process of filament eruption.
#### Multiwavelength Observations of the Precursors Before the Eruptive X4.9 Limb Solar Flare on 25 February, 2014: Current Sheet, Eruptive Filament, Flare and Eruption Onset in the Frame of the Tether-Cutting Magnetic Reconnection Scenario

 - **Abstract**
 We present multiwavelength analysis of the pre-flare phase and onset of the powerful X4.9 near-limb eruptive solar flare on February 25, 2014, revealing the tether-cutting (TC) geometry. We aim at determining relationship between the region of pre-flare energy release with the regions where the flare started to develop, and to investigate a detailed chronology of energy release during the pre-flare time interval and the beginning of the impulse phase. Using X-ray, ultraviolet and radio microwave data we found that the pre-flare energy release site was compact and localized in the vicinity of TC interaction of magnetic structures near the polarity inversion line. The analysis indicates that a pre-flare current sheet (CS) could be in this region. Good correspondence between the location of the pre-flare and flare emission sources visible at the very beginning of the impulsive phase is shown. We found relationship between dynamics of the energy release in the pre-flare CS and formation of the future flare eruptive structure. The growth of the magnetic flux rope was associated with activation of plasma emissions, flows and an increase of UV radiation fluxes from the region where the pre-flare CS was located. The eruptive flux rope gradually grew due to feeding by magnetized plasma ejected from the reconnecting pre-flare CS. Finally, it is shown that the most probable trigger of the eruption was a local fast microflare-like magnetic reconnection in the pre-flare CS. Some local instability in the pre-flare sheet could lead to a transition from the slow to fast reconnection regime. As a result, an ejection from the sheet was initiated and the eruptive flux rope lost its stability. Then, the eruptive flux rope itself initiated formation of the main reconnecting flare CS as in the Standard Flare Model during its movement, and intense emissions associated with the impulsive phase were observed.

 - **Abstract**
 This work investigates a potential time dependence of the absolute magnitude of Type Ia Supernovae (SN Ia). Employing the Gaussian Process approach, we obtain the SN Ia absolute magnitude and its derivative as a function of redshift. The data set considered in the analysis comprises measurements of apparent magnitude from SN Ia, Hubble rate from cosmic chronometers, and the ratio between angular and radial distances from Large-Scale Structure data (BAO and voids). Our findings reveal good compatibility between the reconstructed SN Ia absolute magnitudes and a constant value. However, the mean value obtained from the Gaussian Process reconstruction is $M=-19.456\pm 0.059$, which is $3.2\sigma$ apart from local measurements by Pantheon+SH0ES. This incompatibility may be directly associated to the $\Lambda$CDM model and local data, as it does not appear in either model-dependent or model-independent estimates of the absolute magnitude based on early universe data. Furthermore, we assess the implications of a variable $M$ within the context of modified gravity theories. Considering the local estimate of the absolute magnitude, we find $\sim3\sigma$ tension supporting departures from General Relativity in analyzing scenarios involving modified gravity theories with variations in Planck mass through Newton's constant.

 - **Abstract**
 Compact Obscured Nuclei (CONs) are heavily obscured infrared cores that have been found in local (ultra)luminous infrared galaxies (U/LIRGs). They show bright emission from vibrationally excited rotational transitions of HCN, known as HCN-vib, and are thought to harbor Compton Thick (CT, $N_{\text{H}} \geq 10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$) active galactic nuclei (AGN) or extreme compact starbursts. We explore the potential evolutionary link between CONs and CT AGN by searching for CONs in hard X-ray-confirmed CT AGN from the Great Observatories All-sky LIRG Survey (GOALS). Here, we present new Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Band 6 observations that targeted HCN-vib emission in four hard X-ray-confirmed CT AGN. We analyze these objects together with literature HCN-vib measurements of five additional hard X-ray-confirmed CT AGN from the GOALS sample. We do not detect any CONs in this combined sample of nine CT AGN. We then explore a proposed evolutionary sequence in which CONs evolve into X-ray-detectable CT AGN once outflows and feedback reduce the column densities of the enshrouding gas. We find, however, no evidence of well-developed dense molecular outflows in the observed CT AGN. While this could suggest that CT AGN are not universally linked to CONs, it could also be explained by a short duty cycle for molecular outflows.
