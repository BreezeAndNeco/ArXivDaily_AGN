#### The Three-mm Ultimate Mopra Milky Way Survey. III. Data Release 6, An Atlas of Physical Conditions, Global Mass Conversion Laws, and 3D Physical Architecture of the Molecular ISM in the Fourth Quadrant

 - **Abstract**
 We present Data Release 6 of ThrUMMS, consisting of complete data cubes and various moments of line emission ($^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, C$^{18}$O) from molecular clouds, across 60$^{\circ}$$\times$2$^{\circ}$ of the Fourth Quadrant (4Q) of the Milky Way at a resolution of 72$''$ in (l,b) and 0.09 kms$^{-1}$ in V$_{LSR}$. From LTE radiative transfer analysis of the data cubes, we compute cubes and moments of the lines' opacity, excitation temperature, and column density $N_{12CO}$. Combining $I_{12CO}$ and $N_{12CO}$ data, we derive a global mass conversion law $N$=$N_{0}I^{p}$, where $N_{0}$$\approx$10$^{18}$mol/m$^{2}$ and $p$=2 at this resolution. We argue that the standard linear $N$=$XI$ is only approximately valid: $p$$\sim$1.5-1.0 at coarser resolutions or in atypical locations, such as Galactic Center clouds. Also, the velocity dispersion distributions are very different between $I_{12CO}$ and $N_{12CO}$, the former preferentially tracing more diffuse molecular gas. We re-evaluated Galactic rotation parameters for the 4Q, defining a new ``BGT'' model, and deprojected the (l,V) data onto (l,d) and (x,y) grids using standard kinematic procedures. To automate distance disambiguation inside the solar circle, we developed a simple $\zeta^{+}$ discriminator function and applied it to our deprojections. We discovered two previously unrecognised features of the molecular cloud population: widespread ripples in the midplane of wavelength 4kpc and amplitude 50pc, potentially generated by the last perigalactic passage of the Sgr dwarf; and three distant, massive molecular structures, the Far Ara clouds, two of which exhibit an exceptional velocity gradient, possibly arising in a massive spiral feather or a gas-rich dwarf galaxy $\sim$20--300kpc beyond the disk.
#### The THESAN-ZOOM project: central starbursts and inside-out quenching govern galaxy sizes in the early Universe

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the evolution of galaxy sizes at high redshift ($3<z<13$) using the high-resolution THESAN-ZOOM radiation-hydrodynamics simulations, focusing on the mass range of $10^6\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot} < \mathrm{M}_{\ast} < 10^{10}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. Our analysis reveals that galaxy size growth is tightly coupled to bursty star formation. Galaxies above the star-forming main sequence experience rapid central compaction during starbursts, followed by inside-out quenching and spatially extended star formation that leads to expansion, causing oscillatory behavior around the size-mass relation. Notably, we find a positive intrinsic size-mass relation at high redshift, consistent with observations but in tension with large-volume simulations. We attribute this discrepancy to the bursty star formation captured by our multi-phase interstellar medium framework, but missing from simulations using the effective equation-of-state approach with hydrodynamically decoupled feedback. We also find that the normalization of the size-mass relation follows a double power law as a function of redshift, with a break at $z\approx6$, because the majority of galaxies at $z>6$ show rising star-formation histories, and therefore are in a compaction phase. We demonstrate that H$\alpha$ emission is systematically extended relative to the UV continuum by a median factor of 1.7, consistent with recent JWST studies. However, in contrast to previous interpretations that link extended H$\alpha$ sizes to inside-out growth, we find that Lyman-continuum (LyC) emission is spatially disconnected from H$\alpha$. Instead, a simple Strömgren sphere argument reproduces observed trends, suggesting that extreme LyC production during central starbursts is the primary driver of extended nebular emission.

 - **Abstract**
 Individual stars located near the caustics of galaxy clusters can undergo extreme magnification when crossing micro-caustics, rendering them observable even at cosmological distances. Though most massive stars are likely reside in binary systems rather than as single star, the influence of binary star system on magnification events is severely under-explored. In this work, we simulate the light curves produced by detached binary stars crossing micro-caustics, aiming to characterize their unique observational this http URL high-resolution magnification maps generated by the GPU-PMO-CAUSTIC algorithm and PARSEC stellar models with red-shifted magnitude, we examined the impact of binary star parameters and crossing geometries on microlensing magnification patterns. Our simulations reveal that binary stars produce diverse light curve features, including overlapping peaks, plateau-like structures, and time-variable color-magnitude differences. These features, particularly the distinct temporal variations in spectral energy distributions, offer diagnostic tools for distinguishing binary systems from single this http URL further demonstrate the potential of multi-band photometry using the Chinese Space Station Telescope's Multi-Channel Imager (CSST-MCI) to capture these this http URL findings provide theoretical support for identifying binary systems in future caustic-crossing events, enabling more accurate characterization of high-redshift stellar populations.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the potential of lunar-based gravitational-wave detectors to broaden the multi-messenger astrophysics landscape by detecting mergers of massive ($\gtrsim 1~M_{\odot}$) double white dwarf (WD) binaries. These systems are potential progenitors of Type Ia supernovae and could serve as independent probes of cosmic expansion. We examine two proposed lunar gravitational-wave detector concepts operating in the sub-hertz band (0.1-1 Hz): the Gravitational-Wave Lunar Observatory for Cosmology (a proxy for suspended test mass detectors) and the Lunar Gravitational-Wave Antenna (a proxy for seismic array detectors). Using both contact and Roche lobe overflow merger scenarios, we estimate that these detectors could reach distances of up to ~1 Gpc for the most massive mergers. We show that lunar detectors could observe up to dozens of massive WD mergers annually, including those originating from globular clusters. Lunar detectors would constrain the masses of these WDs with an unprecedented accuracy of one part in a million. Furthermore, these detectors would provide early warnings of weeks before merger, including sky-localization of square arcminute resolution, enabling a new era of coordinated multi-messenger follow-up of electromagnetic transients-whether they evolve into Type Ia supernovae or accretion-induced collapse events.
#### Extended atomic carbon around molecular clouds

 - **Abstract**
 Models predict that atomic carbon occurs at the surface and in the process of the formation of molecular clouds, making its fine structure transitions a diagnostic of cloud formation. We study the distribution of atomic carbon in a small inconspicuous region towards the outer Galaxy that might be representative for a large fraction of the molecular gas of the Milky Way that is not directly affected by star formation. We observed a small strip of 5 arcminutes in the ``Forgotten Quadrant'', the third quadrant of the Milky Way, with the APEX telescope in the $^3P_1-^3P_0$ [CI] transition of atomic carbon and the $J=2-1$ transition of the three most abundant CO isotopologues and compared their distribution with existing measurements of gas column density and of ionized carbon. The atomic carbon shows a very smooth distribution with the smallest gradient along the strip compared to the other lines. It is always brighter than $^{13}$CO and in one velocity-component even brighter than CO. In contrast to observations of many star-forming regions, the [CI] emission seems to extend beyond the molecular gas, in line with the models of photon-dominated regions (PDRs). However, a standard PDR model fit to the observations fails because the models either predict more molecular gas, traced through C$^{18}$O, or more diffuse gas, traced through [CII], than observed. The carbon-budget in the gas phase does not add up to the same column seen through dust emission. To understand the [CI] emission from galaxies it is necessary to get the full statistics for the quiescent gas outside of the star-forming regions that behaves significantly different from dense gas exposed to high ultraviolet fields.

 - **Abstract**
 The magnetic field morphology of relativistic jets can be studied with circular polarization (CP). Recent 3D relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) simulations coupled with radiative transfer calculations make strong predictions about the level (and morphology) of the jet's CP emission. These simulations show that the sign of CP and the electric vector position angle (EVPA) are both sensitive to the jet's magnetic field morphology within the radio core. We probe this theory by exploring if the jet's radio core EVPA orientation is consistent with the observed sign of the core CP in deep full-track polarimetric observations. We aim to probe the nature of linear polarization and CP in the innermost regions of jets from a small sample of nine blazars. This sample includes sources that have exhibited: (i) positive CP, (ii) negative CP, or (iii) positive & negative CP simultaneously in the radio core region. Nine blazar sources were observed using the VLBA at both 15 GHz and 23 GHz. Our self-calibration relies on a physically based model applied in DoG-HiT resulting in more accurate gains. We consider compact Stokes V structures instead of assuming it to be zero, which is crucial given the significant non-zero CP fraction observed at long baselines. We observe robust, relatively high degrees of fractional circular polarization m_c=(0.32 +- 0.2)% at 15 GHz and m_c=(0.59 +-0.56)% at 23 GHz. We observe consistent polarized structure and EVPA orientation over time when comparing our analysis with archival MOJAVE data. Theoretical predictions indicate a clear favored toroidal magnetic field orientation within the extended jet emission of the reconstructed signal of the blazar 0149+218. The jet structures of 1127-145 and 0528+134, even in superresolution, exhibit characteristics aligned with helical or poloidal magnetic nature.

 - **Abstract**
 The Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey (GBTDS) of the Roman Space Telescope will take high cadence data of the Galactic bulge. We investigate the asteroseismic potential of this survey for red giants. We simulate the detectability of global asteroseismic frequencies, $\nu_{\mathrm{max}}$ and $\Delta\nu$, by modify ing Kepler data to match nominal GBTDS observing strategies, considering different noise models, observing cadences, and detection algorithms. Our baseline case, using conservative assumptions, consistently leads to asteroseismic $\nu_{\mathrm{max}}$ detection probabilities above 80% for red clump and red giant branch stars brighter than 16th magnitude in Roman's F146 filter. We then inject these detection probabilities into a Galaxia model of the bulge to estimate asteroseismic yields. For our nominal case, we detect 290,000 stars in total, with 185,000 detections in the bulge. Different assumptions give bulge yields from 135,000 to 349,000 stars. For stars with measured $\nu_{\mathrm{max}}$, we find that we can recover $\Delta\nu$ in 21% to 42% of red clump stars, and 69% to 92% of RGB stars. Implications for survey strategy and asteroseismic population studies are discussed more.

 - **Abstract**
 The Global Oscillations at Low Frequencies instrument aboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory has provided over two decades of continuous, high-precision data, enabling detailed measurements of the Sun's oscillation frequencies. These oscillations, analyzed through Doppler velocity shifts, offer invaluable insights into the Sun's internal structure and dynamics using the methods of helioseismology. This methodology has been extended beyond the Sun to the study of other stars, leveraging data from various space missions. Notably, NASA's Kepler mission, in operation from 2009 until 2018, observed over 500,000 stars, analyzing brightness variations over time and generating a vast database for asteroseismic studies. This investigation focuses on the solar-type star KIC 6106415, comparing its oscillation frequencies with those derived from GOLF data. By analyzing frequency patterns and mode lifetimes, we explore the similarities and differences in internal structures, stellar evolution, and magnetic activity cycles between KIC 6106415 and the Sun. Our analysis reveals that KIC 6106415 exhibits starspot numbers similar to the Sun, peaking at an estimated 175, which is consistent with its faster rotation rate. The data suggest that KIC 6106415 may have shorter magnetic activity cycles than the Sun, reinforcing the established link between stellar rotation and magnetic field generation in solar-type stars.

 - **Abstract**
 We carry out a search for spatial coincidence between high energy neutrinos detected by the IceCube neutrino detector (using the publicly available 10-year muon track data) and 33 magnetars, including two extragalactic ones. We use the unbinned maximum likelihood method for our analysis. We do not find any such spatial association between any of the galactic magnetars and IceCube-detected neutrinos. Therefore, we conclude that none of the known galactic or extragalactic magnetars contribute to the diffuse neutrino flux observed in IceCube.

 - **Abstract**
 Primordial black holes (PBH) accretion in the late Universe can lead to significant mass growth. A larger mass further accelerates the accretion radiation output for PBHs with initial masses greater than one solar mass, potentially leading to a stringent energy-dumping constraint derived from observations of the cosmic microwave background. The energy injected via PBH accretion is capable of ionizing and heating the intergalactic medium (IGM), ultimately affecting the optical depth of cosmic reionization and the 21-cm signal. This work investigates primordial black hole mass growth using the Bondi-Hoyle accretion model and accounts for additional ionization and heating induced by PBHs. We derive stringent PBH abundance limits using an upper limit on optical depth set by Planck 2018 CMB measurements. We find that accretion growth significantly strengthens late-time observational constraints for primordial black holes with initial masses ranging from several solar masses up to $10^4$ solar masses. The PBH fraction of the Universe's unobserved mass content can be constrained to $f_\mathrm{PBH, ini}\sim 10^{-2}$ to $10^{-7}$ in this mass range, and when not accounting for mass evolution our constraints can be weakened by up to one order of magnitude. In addition, we show that PBH mass growth will lead to an observable impact on the predicted hydrogen 21-cm brightness temperature.

 - **Abstract**
 The X-ray quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) is a remarkable form of variability in systems of compact object accretion. RE J1034+396, harboring the most significant X-ray QPO in active galactic nuclei (AGNs), is the most noteworthy source for in-depth analysis of AGN X-ray QPO properties. A long-term evolution of its QPO has been observed over the course of the observations. However, the short-term variability of its QPO properties remains unexplored within each observation that has long good time intervals (GTIs). We collect 12 XMM-Newton observations of RE J1034+396 with GTIs longer than 60 ks from publicly available data and conduct a detailed wavelet analysis focusing on the short-time modulation of the QPO. The QPO signals are found to undergo amplitude modulation in both the soft and hard bands, with a typical timescale of 17 ks. The soft flux is significantly higher when the hard QPO is present. They are highly correlated, with an average cross-correlation function (CCF) peak coefficient of 0.61 and a lag of approximately 3 ks. This novel finding provides fresh insights into the potential connection between the components of the corona emitting soft and hard X-ray photons. The CCF lag between the soft flux and the hard QPO evolves across the observations, potentially sharing the same origin as the previously observed interconnected evolution between QPO frequency and time lag.

 - **Abstract**
 We carry out an imaging survey of six globular clusters (GCs) with a limit magnitude to 22 mag at the 5 sigma level, down to the main sequence stars of the respective cluster, as one of the pilot observing program of the Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST). This paper present the early results of this survey, where we investigate the tidal characters at the periphery of the clusters NGC 4147, NGC 5024, NGC 5053, NGC 5272, NGC 5904 and NGC 6341. We present the estimated number density of cluster candidates and their spatial distribution. We confirm the presence of tidal arms in NGC 4147 and NGC 5904 and identify several intriguing potential tidal structures in NGC 4147, NGC 5024, NGC 5272, corroborated the elliptical morphology of the periphery of NGC 6341. Our findings underscore the WFST's capability for probing faint structural features in GCs, paving the way for future in-depth studies, especially for the search of the large scale tidal streams associated with the clusters with the future wide field survey.

 - **Abstract**
 We acquired 450 {\mu}m and 850 {\mu}m dust continuum polarization observations toward the inner region of the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) as part of the B-Fields In Star-Forming Region Observations (BISTRO) survey using the POL-2 polarimeter on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope. These observations encompassed three dense structures: the 20 km s{^{-1}} cloud (20MC), 50 km s{^{-1}} cloud (50MC), and circumnuclear disk (CND). Our aim is to investigate the magnetic field morphology and strength in the inner region of the CMZ using polarized dust continuum and the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method. The magnetic field morphology is highly ordered in all three dense regions. The plane-of-sky magnetic field strengths are {\sim}1 mG for the 20MC and the 50MC, and {\sim}2 mG for the CND. We compare the energy contributions of turbulence, gravity, and thermal motion with that of the magnetic field using the plasma {\beta}, mass-to-flux ratio, and Alfvén Mach number. The outcomes reveal the magnetic field stands out as the predominant factor within the inner region of the CMZ. The dominance of the magnetic field may explain the low star-forming rate in the CMZ. We further investigate the dust grain alignment efficiency by exploring the relationship between polarization fraction and total intensity. The results suggest that dust grains are well aligned with the magnetic fields.

 - **Abstract**
 We achieved the first VLBI detections of the ground vibrational state ($v=0$) $^{28}$SiO (hereafter, SiO) and $^{29}$SiO masers of the $J=1\rightarrow 0$ rotational transitions, towards the 25 \Msun ~red supergiant (RSG) star, VY Canis Majoris (VY CMa), taking advantage of the high sensitivity of the VLBI Exploration of Radio Astrometry (VERA) telescopes that coordinate with the Nobeyama 45 m telescope. In addition, we successfully detected the SiO $J=1\rightarrow 0$ transition in the $v=3$ state towards VY CMa for the first time with VLBI. The SiO $J=1\rightarrow 0$ maser spot in $v=0$ state was detected in the cross-power spectra taken with the baselines involving the Nobeyama 45-m telescope. The combination of previously reported absolute astrometry and the relative astrometry technique allowed us to derive the location of the SiO $v=0$ maser spot, {(RA, DEC) = ( 7${\rm ^h}$ 22${\rm ^m}$ 58.$^{\rm s}$32, $-$25$^{\circ}$ 46$^{\prime}$ 3.$^{\prime\prime}$4) in J2000 at an absolute positional accuracy of $\sim$100 milliarcseconds (mas). The SiO $v=0$ maser spot is offset by the amount of ($\Delta$RA, $\Delta$DEC)=($-$150, $-$300) (mas) to the southwest of the stellar position, suggesting that the $v = 0$ maser spot is associated with its outflow activity.} This observational study demonstrates that the brightest SiO $v=0$ maser spot is compact (3 mas), producing an extremely high brightness of $\sim$ 10$^7$ K. This indicates that the SiO $v=0$ maser action may originate from strong shocks in the stellar wind emanating from this extreme RSG that leads to its intense mass ejection.

 - **Abstract**
 The spatial extension of active regions (ARs) of the Sun can vary from one case to the next. This is a problem when studying solar flares with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as they generally use input images of a fixed size. Different processes can be performed to retrieve a database with homogeneous-sized data, such as resizing. Unfortunately, key features can be lost or distorted during these processes. This can lead to a deterioration of the ability of CNNs to classify flares of different soft X-ray classes, especially those from ARs with complex structures. Our work aims to implement and test a CNN architecture that retains the full features of the original resolution of the input images. We compare the performance of two CNN architectures for solar flare prediction: the first is a traditional CNN with resized input whereas the other implements a spatial pyramid pooling (SPP) layer without any input resizing. Both are trained on the Spaceweather HMI Active Region Patch line-of-sight magnetogram database. We also study two cases of binary classification. In the first case, our model distinguishes ARs producing flares in less than 24h of class greater or equal to C1.0 from ARs producing flares in more than 24h or never; in the second case, it distinguishes ARs producing flares in less than 24h of class greater or equal to M1.0 from the other ARs. Our models implementing an SPP layer outperform the traditional CNN models when predicting flares greater or equal to C1.0 within 24h. However, their performances degrade sharply along the other models studied in this paper, when trained to classify images greater or equal to M1.0 flares. The degradation in SPP models when classifying only images greater or equal to M1.0 flares as positive may be attributed to its success in identifying features that appear in ARs a few hours before the flare, independently of their soft X-ray class.

 - **Abstract**
 The conversion of CMB photons to axions (or axion-like particles (ALPs)) can lead to a unique spectral distortion in the temperature and polarization sky which can be explored in upcoming CMB experiments. In this work we have developed a numerical simulation-based technique of photons to ALPs conversion in the galaxy clusters and show for the first time that this physical process can lead to large non-Gaussian signal in the temperature and polarization field, which is impacted by the presence of inhomogeneities and turbulence in the electron density and magnetic field. Our simulation-based technique can simulate the theoretical signal for different scenarios of cluster electron density and magnetic field turbulence and provides testable predictions to discover ALPs from galaxy clusters using spatially non-Gaussian and anisotropic spectral distortion of the microwave sky. We show that the presence of turbulence in the magnetic field and electron density can impact the Gaussian part of the signal captured in terms of the angular power spectra of the signal by more than an order of magnitude. Also, the presence of turbulence in different clusters will lead the temperature and polarization fluctuations around the cluster region to have varying non-Gaussian distribution, with peaks and tails different from the Gaussian statistics of the CMB anisotropy. This new numerical technique has made it possible to calculate also the non-Gaussian signals and can be used in future CMB analysis in synergy with X-ray and radio observations to unveil ALPs coupling with photons in the currently unexplored ranges, for the masses between about $10^{-14}$ eV--$10^{-11}$ eV.

 Dust grains embedded in gas flow give rise to a class of hydrodynamic instabilities that can occur whenever there exists a relative velocity between gas and dust. These instabilities have predominantly been studied for single grain sizes, for which a strong interaction can be found between drifting dust and a travelling gas wave, leading to fast-growing perturbations (growth rates $\propto \sqrt{\mu}$) even at small dust-to-gas ratios $\mu$. They are called resonant drag instabilities. We focus on the acoustic resonant drag instability, which is potentially important in AGB star outflows, around supernova remnants and star clusters in starburst galaxies. We study the acoustic resonant drag instability, taking into account a continuous spectrum of grain sizes, to determine whether it survives in the polydisperse regime and how the resulting growth rates compare to the monodisperse case. We solve the linear equations for a polydisperse fluid for the acoustic drag instability, focusing on small dust-to-gas ratios. Size distributions of realistic width turn the fast-growing perturbations $\propto \sqrt{\mu}$ of the monodisperse limit into slower growing perturbations $\propto \mu$ due to the fact that the backreaction on the gas involves an integration over the resonance. Furthermore, the large wave numbers that grow fastest in the monodisperse regime are stabilized by a size distribution, severely limiting the growth rates in the polydisperse regime. The acoustic resonant drag instability turns from a singularly perturbed problem in $\mu$ in the monodisperse limit into a regular perturbation for a sufficiently wide size distribution. It can still grow exponentially in the polydisperse regime, but at a slower pace compared to the single size case.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding galactic magnetic fields is essential for interpreting feedback processes in galaxies. Despite their importance, the exact structure of these fields, particularly in galactic halos, remains unclear. Accurate descriptions are crucial for understanding the interaction between star formation and halo magnetisation. By systematically analysing the polarisation patterns in halos of nearby galaxies, we aim to deepen the understanding of the interplay between galactic magnetic fields and star formation processes. We provide an analytical description of the observed X-shaped halos. Based on radio polarimetry data, we classify the polarisation patterns of a sample of edge-on galaxies, by using a newly introduced three-class system: disc dominated, small-scale, and X-shaped. We then fit X-shaped patterns to the polarisation data for galaxies classified as X-shaped and explore links between the polarisation patterns and other physical properties of these galaxies. The classification process shows that 11 out of 18 analysed galaxies display an X-shaped polarisation pattern. Galaxies classified as disc dominated seem less efficient at forming stars than expected for their stellar mass and rotate faster than galaxies with similarly sized HI-discs. X-shape modelling reveals that the polarisation patterns are best fitted by a constant-angle model, and we observe a correlation between the X-shape opening angle and star formation rate surface density indicating the interplay between the star formation in the disc and the magnetisation of the galactic halo. The analysis of polarisation patterns in nearby galaxies reveals that most exhibit an X-shaped configuration, indicating a common magnetic field structure in galactic halos. The introduced models capture the X-shaped morphology and reveal the link between the X-shape's opening angle and star formation rate surface density.

 - **Abstract**
 The recent discovery of large-amplitude pulsations in faint blue stars (BLAPs) provides both challenges for stellar pulsation theory and opportunities to explore the late evolution of low-mass stars. This paper explores the radial-mode stability of stars across parameter space occupied by BLAPs. Models are constructed for homogeneous stellar envelopes and are agnostic of evolution. Linear non-adiabatic models demonstrate the major requirement for pulsations to be enrichment of iron and nickel in the driving zone to a few times the solar abundance. There is no constraint on mass. Non-linear models demonstrate that BLAP pulsations will be of large amplitude and will show strong shocks at minimum radius. A variety of light-curve shapes are found across the BLAP instability strip, accounting for the variety observed. Linearised period relations are derived from the non-linear models. The phase of maximum luminosity relative to minimum radius is correlated with effective temperature ($T_{\rm eff}$), preceding for cool stars and following for hot stars, and split if close to minimum radius. In both linear and non-linear cases, most models pulsate in the fundamental mode (F). First-overtone (1H) pulsations are excited on the low luminosity blue side of the instability region and become more prevalent at higher mass. The period ratio $P_{\rm 1H}/P_{\rm F}=0.81$ contrasts with the classical Cepheid value (0.70 - 0.75). The transition from F to 1H mode pulsations follows a period-mass relation; the F-mode pulsators adjacent to the transition show a reverse shock. At high $T_{\rm eff}$ some non-linear models show unstable overtone modes up to 5H and multi-mode behaviour. The linear and non-linear analyses concur on the red-edge of the instability region, but the non-linear blue edge is hotter.

 - **Abstract**
 Axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) have gained substantial attention as potential candidates for cold dark matter. The ALP field can exhibit fluctuations stemming from initial conditions. These initial field fluctuations hold the potential to give rise to gravitationally bound configurations known as axion miniclusters (AMC). While this proposition is widely accepted in the post-inflationary Peccei-Quinn symmetry-breaking scenario, uncertainties persist regarding the pre-inflationary scenario, where the effects of the initial field fluctuations may be suppressed by inflation. In this study, we investigate the influence of adiabatic temperature fluctuations of the primordial plasma on the evolution of axion density perturbations and their power spectrum, aiming to explore the possibility of AMC formation in the pre-inflationary scenario. Our analysis reveals that the impact of adiabatic temperature fluctuations becomes significant when $f_{\rm a} / H_{\rm inf} \gtrsim 1.25 \times 10^4$ and surpasses that of quantum fluctuations by up to five orders of magnitude on large scales. This emphasizes the possibility of also forming AMC within the pre-inflationary scenario. Consequently, a detection of AMC would not reliably differentiate between the pre- and post-inflationary origin of axions.

 - **Abstract**
 The James Webb Space Telescope has detected massive black holes (BHs) with masses of $\sim 10^{6-8}~M_\odot$ within the first billion years of the universe. One of the remarkable findings is the identification of "Little Red Dots" (LRDs), a unique class of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with distinct characteristics representing a key phase in the formation and growth of early BHs. Here, we analyze the occurrence rate of LRDs, which emerge around redshifts $z \sim 6-8$ and sharply decline at $z < 4$. We find that this trend follows a log-normal distribution, commonly observed in phenomena driven by stochastic and random factors. We propose a hypothesis that the first one or two AGN events associated with newly-formed seed BHs are observed as LRDs and their unique features fade in the subsequent episodes. This naturally explains the cosmic evolution of AGN abundance over $0 < z < 5$, which follows $\propto (1+z)^{-5/2}$ due to the cumulative effect of recurring AGN activity. The unique characteristics of LRDs are likely linked to the dense gas environments around the seed BHs, which create strong absorption features in the broad-line emission and enable super-Eddington accretion bursts, ultimately yielding the observed overmassive nature of BHs compared to the local relationship.

 - **Abstract**
 The ALMAGAL Large Program has observed 1017 high-mass star-forming regions distributed throughout the Galaxy, sampling different evolutionary stages and environmental conditions. In this work, we present the acquisition and processing of the ALMAGAL data. The main goal is to set up a robust pipeline that generates science-ready products, with a good and uniform quality across the whole sample. ALMAGAL observations were performed with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). Each field was observed in three different telescope arrays, being sensitive to spatial scales ranging from 1000 au up to 0.1 pc. The spectral setup allows sensitive imaging of the continuum emission at 219 GHz, and it covers multiple molecular spectral lines observed in four different spectral windows that span about 4 GHz in frequency coverage. We have designed a Python-based processing workflow to calibrate and image these observational data. This ALMAGAL pipeline includes an improved continuum determination, suited for line-rich sources; an automatic self-calibration process that improves the dynamical range of the final images; and the combination of data from different telescope arrays to produce science-ready, fully combined images. The fully combined products have spatial resolutions in the range 800-2000 au, and mass sensitivities in the range 0.02-0.07 Mo. We also present a first analysis of the spectral line information included in the ALMAGAL setup, and its potential for future scientific studies. As an example, specific spectral lines at 1000 au scales resolve the presence of multiple outflows in clusters and will help us to search for disk candidates around massive protostars. Moreover, the broad frequency bands provide information on the chemical richness of the different cluster members, which can be used to study the chemical evolution during the formation process of star clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 We describe observations and physical characteristics of Earth-crossing asteroid 2024 YR$_4$, discovered on 2024 December 27 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System. The asteroid has semi-major axis, $a$ = 2.52 au, eccentricity, $e$ = 0.66, inclination $i$ = 3.41$^{\circ}$, and a $\sim$0.003 au Earth minimum orbit intersection distance. We obtained g, r, i, and Z imaging with the Gemini South/Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph on 2025 February 7. We measured a g-i spectral slope of 13$\pm$3 $\%$/100 nm, and color indices g-r = 0.70$\pm$0.10, r-i = 0.25$\pm$0.06, i-Z = -0.27$\pm$0.10. 2024 YR$_4$ has a spectrum that best matches R-type and Sa-type asteroids and a diameter of $\sim$30-65 m using our measured absolute magnitude of 23.9$\pm$0.3, and assuming an albedo of 0.15-0.4. The lightcurve of 2024 YR$_4$ shows $\sim$0.4 mag variations with a rotation period of $\sim$1170 s. We use photometry of 2024 YR$_4$ from Gemini and other sources taken between 2024 December to 2025 February to determine the asteroid's spin vector and shape, finding that it has an oblate, $\sim$3:1 a:c axial ratio and a pole direction of $\lambda$, $\beta$ = $\sim$42$^{\circ}$, $\sim$-25$^{\circ}$. Finally, we compare the orbital elements of 2024 YR$_4$ with the NEO population model and find that its most likely sources are resonances between the inner and central Main Belt.
