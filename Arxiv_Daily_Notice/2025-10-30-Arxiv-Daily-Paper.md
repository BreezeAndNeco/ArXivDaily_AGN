 - **Abstract**
 We investigate accretion disk winds commonly observed in galactic black hole (BH) X-ray binaries (XRB), which manifest as blueshifted absorption features in X-ray spectra. We model these winds as ideal magnetohydrodynamic outflows of hot plasma driven by global magnetic fields threading the accretion disk around the BH. Using Monte Carlo simulations with MONACO, we solve three-dimensional radiative transfer equations to determine the large-scale ionization structure that produces the observed ionic column densities. Focusing on the high/soft state of the BH XRB, where disk emission provides the dominant source of ionizing X-rays, we calculated synthetic spectra showing resonance absorption and scattered emission from ions in various charge states. Our results demonstrate that systems viewed at high polar angles exhibit prominent multi-ion absorption lines with asymmetric profiles, accompanied by P-Cygni-like emission features that partially reproduce the characteristics seen in the observed spectra. This further implies that even a dense disk wind with a high polar angle is unlikely to be saturated due to effective scattering.

 - **Abstract**
 Pulsar Timing Array experiments are rapidly approaching the era of gravitational wave background anisotropy detection. The timing residuals of each pulsar are an integrated measure of the gravitational-wave power across all angular scales. However, due to the limited number of monitored pulsars, current analyses are only able to reconstruct the angular structure of the background at large scales. We show analytically that this mismatch between the integrated all-sky signal and the truncated reconstruction introduces a previously unaccounted source of systematic bias in anisotropic background map reconstruction. The source of this systematic error, that we call ''small-scale leakage'', is the intrinsic presence of unaccounted gravitational wave power at scales smaller than the reconstructed scales. This unmodeled power leaks into large-scale modes, artificially increasing the recovered value of the inferred angular power spectrum by at least one order of magnitude in a wide range of scales. Importantly, this effect is fundamentally independent of the geometry of the pulsar configuration, the anisotropy reconstruction method, the use of different regularization schemes, and the presence of pulsar noise. As the quality of pulsar timing array experiments improves, a robust understanding of small-scale leakage will become paramount for reliable detection and characterization of the gravitational wave background. Thus, the theoretical formalism developed here will be essential to estimate the magnitude of this systematic uncertainty in anisotropy searches.

 - **Abstract**
 The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) North Ecliptic Pole (NEP) Time-Domain Field (TDF) has been monitored by NuSTAR and XMM-Newton with a regular cadence for five years starting in 2019. The survey has accumulated 3.5Ms of NuSTAR exposure and 228 ks quasi-simultaneous XMM-Newton observations covering 0.31 deg^2. This paper presents the results from the most recent two-years' 2Ms NuSTAR and 166 ks XMM observations in NuSTAR cycles 8 and 9. These observations reached a 20%-area flux of 2.20 x 10^-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1 in the 8-24 keV band. 75 NuSTAR sources and 274 XMM-Newton sources are detected at 99% reliability level. The logN-logS measured in cycles 8+9 are consistent with those measured in the previous cycle 5+6 NuSTAR NEP survey, but in a larger area (0.3 deg^2 compared with 0.19 deg^2). The slope of the cycles 8+9 8-24 keV logN-logS curve is flatter than other works ({\alpha}89 = 1.13 +/- 0.46), but is consistent with the Euclidean value of {\alpha} = 1.50. In addition, we found ~36% of the NuSTAR sources to be heavily obscured (NH >= 10^23 cm^-2). The Compton-thick (NH >= 10^24 cm^-2) (CT-) AGN fraction is 9+18-8% in the NEP-TDF, which is consistent with the measurements in previous surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a time-resolved, joint Swift-Fermi spectral study of GRB 241030A (z=1.411) that cleanly isolates the synchrotron origin of its prompt emission and favors a matter-dominated, internal-shock scenario. The light curve shows two episodes separated by a quiescent gap. Episode I (0-45 s) is well described by a single power law with photon index $\simeq -3/2$, consistent with the fast-cooling synchrotron slope below the peak. Episode II (100-200 s), exhibits two robust spectral breaks: a low-energy break at $E_{b}$$\sim$$2-3$ keV that remains nearly constant in time, and a spectral peak $E_{p}$ that tracks the flux within pulses but steps down between them. The photon indices below and above $E_{b}$ cluster around -2/3 and -3/2, respectively, as expected for fast-cooling synchrotron emission. The burst displays an unusually small (consistent with zero) spectral lag across GBM bands. At later times ($\geq 230$ s), the spectrum softens toward $\sim-2.7$, as expected when the observing band lies above both $\nu_m$ and $\nu_c$. These behaviors are difficult to reconcile with a globally magnetized outflow with a decaying field, which naturally produces hard-to-soft Ep evolution, growing $\nu_c$, and appreciable lags. By contrast, internal shocks with a roughly steady effective magnetic field and a time-variable minimum electron Lorentz factor (equivalently, e.g., a varying fraction of accelerated electrons simultaneously account for (i) the stable $E_{b}$, (ii) the intensity-tracking yet step-down $E_{p}$, (iii) the canonical -2/3 and -3/2 slopes, and (iv) the near-zero lag.

 - **Abstract**
 The diminishing of star formation is accompanied by size differentiating, as quiescent galaxies are more compact than star-forming galaxies at fixed stellar mass. In order to understand how galaxy quenching is related to galaxy sizes, we performed a demographic study of 46 massive quiescent central galaxies with stellar mass from $10^{10.5}\rm M_\odot$ to $10^{11}\rm M_\odot$ in the TNG50 simulation. We found that, in addition to the triggering active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback, galaxy size is also a major determinant of the quenching process, as small and compact galaxies are immediately quenched by the kinetic AGN feedback, while galaxies with large sizes are still active until strangulated by the cutoff of new gas replenishment. Further spatially resolved inspection reveals that this short and intense kinetic AGN feedback can only suppress the star formation within 1-2 kpc, resulting in this size-dependent effect of quenching. We also identify a long-term effect of a few Gyr timescale that the gas inflow rate is progressively suppressed after triggering kinetic feedback, which appears to effectively quench large galaxies entirely. We conclude that kinetic AGN feedback has two key roles in quenching: a short-term, intense effect that quenches the central 2 kpc region, and a long-term effect that suppresses the gas inflow rate and further quenches the entire galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 Thanks to new advances in astronomical imaging, we can now routinely explore disk galaxy profiles about two magnitudes deeper than the data available 20 years ago. In this regard, it is an opportune time to reevaluate the past classifications of different surface brightness Types. In this paper, we explore the stellar mass profiles of a sample of disk galaxies with similar stellar masses ($\sim$10$^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$) using IAC Stripe82 Legacy Project data. We find that Type I, II-CT, and III-d galaxies exhibit edges at surface brightnesses $\mu_g$(R$_{edge}$)$\sim$26.5 mag/arcsec$^2$ and surface mass densities $\Sigma$(R$_{edge}$)$\sim$0.5-1 M$_{\odot}$/pc$^2$. These surface brightnesses were outside the range of typical SDSS images and, therefore, unstudied. The present data suggest (although the statistics are inconclusive) that the main difference between the previous profile Types is the presence of either a more or a less intense bulge. Half of the Type II-CT galaxies are Sc, whereas half of the Type III-d galaxies are Sb. Finally, Type III-d galaxies have low mass surface density disks ($\Sigma$($\Delta$ $R_{\mathrm{exp}}$)$\sim$0.5 M$_{\odot}$/pc$^2$) and are bluer $(g-r)_0$=0.32$\pm$0.02 than the other Types ($(g-r)_0$=0.42$\pm$0.02 for Type I and II-CT), suggesting that their disks probably formed later in time.

 - **Abstract**
 The study of solar active regions (ARs) is of central importance to a range of fundamental science, as well as the practical applications of space weather. Active region emergence and life cycles are two areas of particular interest, yet the lack of consistent full-Sun observations has made long-term studies of active regions difficult. Here, we present results from a study to identify and characterize long-lived active regions (LLARs), defined as those which were observed during at least two consecutive Carrington rotations and which did not undergo significant successive flux emergence once the decay phase began. Such active regions accounted for 13% of all NOAA-identified ARs between 2011 and 2019, and their distribution closely follows the annual sunspot number. This implies that LLARs are produced by the same basic driving processes as regular ARs. LLAR areas tend to be significantly larger and contain more magnetic flux compared to other ARs, but the two categories have similar magnetic complexity distributions. The most striking result, however, is that LLARs are 3-6 times more likely than other ARs to be the source of a solar flare of GOES class C or greater. This highlights the importance of studying what makes a LLAR and how to identify them at emergence with a view towards improved space weather forecasting. The further implications of these findings for AR heating spatial and temporal patterns will be explored in an upcoming study.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first high-resolution X-ray spectrum of NGC 7213 obtained with XRISM/Resolve, supported by simultaneous XMM-Newton, NuSTAR, and SOAR optical data. The XRISM spectrum resolves the neutral Fe\,K$\alpha$ into two components: a narrow core ($\rm FWHM = 650_{-220}^{+240}\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$) consistent with emission at the dust sublimation radius, and a broader, asymmetric line best described by disk-like emission from $\sim 100\,\rm R_{g}$. This disk component mirrors the profile of the double-peaked H$\alpha$ line observed in the optical. In addition, we detect broadened Fe XXV and Fe XXVI emission lines whose inferred locations bridge the gap between the inner disk and the optical broad-line region. The weak narrow Fe K$\alpha$ equivalent width ($\rm EW = 32 \pm 6\,eV$) and absence of a Compton hump imply a low-covering-fraction, Compton-thin torus. Together, these results reveal a radially stratified structure in NGC 7213, spanning nearly four orders of magnitude in radius, and place the source in an intermediate accretion state ($\rm \lambda_{Edd} = 0.001-0.01$) where the inner disk and BLR remain, while the torus shows signs of dissipation.
#### Numerical Studies on the Radio Afterglows in TDE: Bow Shock

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of radio afterglows or delayed radio flares in tidal disruption events (TDEs) is not fully understood. They could be generated either by a forward shock (FS) propagating into diffuse circumnuclear medium (CNM), or a bow shock (BS) around a dense cloud, each of which is fundamentally different. To elucidate the distinctions between these two scenarios, we conducted two-fluid simulations incorporating relativistic electrons to investigate the spatial evolution of these electrons after being accelerated by shock. Based on their spatial distribution, we performed radiative transfer calculations to obtain the synchrotron spectra. In Paper I (Mou 2025), we reported the results for the FS scenario; in this article, we focus on the BS scenario. Compared to that from the FS, the radio emission from the BS exhibits a higher peak frequency, and its flux shows a much steeper rise and a more rapid decline. The radio flux from the BS also responds to fluctuations in the outflow. The combined effects of the BS and FS substantially alter radio spectra, causing significant deviations from the single-zone emission model, and in some cases producing double-peaked or flat-top features in spectra. This study highlights the importance of the BS, and inspires a novel approach for probing dense gas on sub-parsec scales in galactic nuclei by decomposing the BS radio spectrum to reveal the conditions of circumnuclear dense gas.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic reconnection is a proposed mechanism for nanojets associated with coronal heating. We investigate the characteristics of reconnection-driven nanojets just before and during a prominence eruption using the High Resolution Imager (HRI) of the Extreme Ultraviolet imager (EUI) aboard Solar Orbiter during its perihelion on September 30, 2024. Extreme UV (EUV) images at unprecedented high spatial and temporal resolution from \hrieuv were analysed. The dimensions and propagation speeds of nanojets were estimated and used to estimate the kinetic energies. Nanojet activity was compared with GOES X-ray flux to assess its relation to flare evolution. The high spatial and temporal resolution in the EUV was found to be essential to fully capture the properties and numbers of reconnection nanojets. Approximately 120 nanojets were detected during the eruption, with 40 analysed in detail. Nanojets exhibited lengths of $200 - 5000$~km, widths of $200 - 500$~km and durations of $2-12$~s. Instant velocities ranged from 150 km~s$^{-1}- 600~$km~s$^{-1}$ with kinetic energies reaching $1.56\times10^{27}$~erg. These nanojets are faster, longer, more energetic and more numerous compared to previous studies. We also find clear signatures of acceleration and deceleration, reflecting magnetic tension release and reach of new equilibria. Reconnection events during the eruption were found to be more frequent and energetically intense. Pre-flare nanojet clustering indicates small-scale reconnection may precede large eruptive activity. These results suggest that nanojets also occur in fully ionised coronal plasma, playing a role in both quiescent and eruptive solar activity.
#### Magnetic Fields in Massive Star-forming Regions (MagMaR). VI. Magnetic Field Dragging in the Filamentary High-mass Star-forming Region G35.20--0.74N due to Gravity

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the magnetic field orientation and strength in the massive star-forming region G35.20-0.74N (G35), using polarized dust emission data obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) as part of the Magnetic fields in Massive star-forming Regions (MagMaR) survey. The G35 region shows a filamentary structure (a length of $\sim$0.1 pc) with six bright cores located along the filament's long axis. Magnetic field strengths across the G35 region range from 0.2 to 4.4 mG with a mean value of 0.8 $\pm$ 0.4 mG. The mass-to-flux ratio ($\lambda$) varies from 0.1 to 6.0 the critical value. The highest values are found locally around cores, whereas the remains of the filament are subcritical. A H$^{13}$CO$^+$ (3--2) velocity gradient of 29 km s$^{-1}$ pc$^{-1}$ is evident along the filament's long axis, aligned with the magnetic field direction. At larger scales ($\sim$0.1 pc), the magnetic field lines appear roughly perpendicular to the filament's long axis, in contrast to the smaller-scale structure ($\sim$0.003 pc) traced by ALMA. The magnetic field lines could be dragged along the filament as a result of the gas motion induced by the gravitational potential of the filament. Six cores in the filament have similar spacings between 0.02--0.04 pc. The initial filament fragmentation could have produced a core spacing of 0.06 pc, following filament fragmentation theory, and the current core spacing is the result of cores comoving with the gas along the filament. This core migration could occur in a few 10$^4$ years, consistent with high-mass star formation time scales.
#### XRISM Spectroscopy of the Stellar-mass Black Hole GRS 1915+105

 - **Abstract**
 GRS 1915$+$105 was the stellar-mass black hole that best reproduced key phenomena that are also observed in Type-1 active galactic nuclei. In recent years, however, it has evolved to resemble a Type-2 or Compton-thick AGN. Herein, we report on the first XRISM observation of GRS 1915$+$105. The high-resolution Resolve calorimeter spectrum reveals that a sub-Eddington central engine is covered by a layer of warm, Compton-thick gas. With the obscuration acting as a coronagraph, numerous strong, narrow emission lines from He-like and H-like charge states of Si, S, Ar, Ca, Cr, Mn, Fe, and Ni dominate the spectrum. Radiative recombination continuum (RRC) features are also observed, signaling that much of the emitting gas is photoionized. The line spectrum can be fit by three photoionized emission zones, with broadening and bulk velocities suggestive of an origin in the outer disk atmosphere and/or a slow wind at $r \simeq 10^{6}~GM/c^{2}$. The Fe XXV He-$\alpha$ and Fe XXVI Ly-$\alpha$ lines have a broad base that may indicate some emission from $r \sim 3\times 10^{3}~GM/c^{2}$. These results broadly support a picture wherein the current state in GRS 1915$+$105 is due to obscuration by the irradiated outer disk. This could arise through disk thickening if the Eddington fraction is higher than inferred, but it is more likely due to a warped, precessing disk that has brought the outer disk into the line of sight. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of this interpretation and our modeling, and possible explanations of some potentially novel spectral features.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the long-term variability of the known Changing Look Active Galactic Nuclei (CL AGN) Mrk 1018, whose second change we discovered as part of the Close AGN Reference Survey (CARS). Collating over a hundred years worth of photometry from scanned photographic plates and five modern surveys we find a historic outburst between ~1935-1960, with variation in Johnson B magnitude of ~0.8 that is consistent with Mrk 1018's brightness before and after its latest changing look event in the early 2010s. Using the combined modern and historic data, a Generalised Lomb-Scargle suggests broad feature with P = 29-47 years. Its width and stability across tests, as well as the turn-on speed and bright phase duration of the historic event suggests a timescale associated with long-term modulation, such as via rapid flickering in the accretion rate caused by the Chaotic Cold Accretion model rather than a strictly periodic CL mechanism driving changes in Mrk 1018. We also use the modern photometry to constrain Mrk 1018's latest turn-off duration to less than ~1.9 years, providing further support for a CL mechanism with rapid transition timescales, such as a changing mode of accretion.

 - **Abstract**
 Accretion near black holes (BHs) is multidimensional, with turbulence, resistivity, thermal transport, and dust dynamics all playing essential roles. In cold accretion discs (ADs) or the region of an AD where magnetic fields (MFs) are negligible (or absent), hydrodynamic (HD) turbulence is probably dominating. However, Magneto-rotational instability (MRI) is the primary cause of turbulence in ADs. Significant velocity variations and rapid pressure changes are characteristics of turbulent flows, which allow better mixing and more angular momentum (AM) and energy transfer. Also, in accretion flow (AF), the interaction between turbulence and resistivity determines the efficiency of energy dissipation and heat transfer. Radiation, convection, and thermal conduction (TC) are the heat transport modes existing in AFs, where TC enables energy transfer in accreting materials via heat flux. Moreover, convection, also generated by turbulence, significantly impacts the stability of the AD and its vertical structure. The disc may be affected by radiation from the AD surrounding the BH when X-ray emission occurs. The emission from the disc is also affected by dust particles. Dust grains near BH are exposed to high temperatures and intense radiation, which might affect the flow characteristics, as seen in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). This chapter highlights the combined effect of turbulence, resistivity, transport mechanisms, and dust particles on BH AF. Future studies in this field must thoroughly investigate how dust, transport mechanisms, and turbulence interact in the BH accretion system.

 - **Abstract**
 Observational studies of HII region-molecular cloud interactions constrain models of feedback and quantify its impact on the surrounding environment. A recent hypothesis proposes that a characteristic spectral signature in ground state hyperfine lines of hydroxyl (OH) -- the OH flip -- may trace gas that is dynamically interacting with an expanding HII region, offering a new means of probing such interactions. We explore this hypothesis using dedicated Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) observations of three Galactic HII regions, G049.205$-$0.343, G034.256+0.145 and G024.471+0.492, in 1--2 GHz continuum emission, all four 18-cm ground-state OH lines, and multiple hydrogen radio recombination lines. A Gaussian decomposition of the molecular gas data reveals complex OH emission and absorption across our targets. We detect the OH flip towards two of our sources, G049.205$-$0.343 and G034.256+0.145, finding agreement between key predictions of flip hypothesis and the observed multi-wavelength spectra, kinematics and morphology. Specifically, we demonstrate a strong spatial and kinematic association between the OH flip and the ionized gas of the HII regions -- the first time this has been demonstrated for resolved sources -- and evidence from $^{13}$CO(1--0) data that the expected OH component originates from the non-disturbed gas of the parent cloud. While we detect no flip in G024.471+0.492, we do find evidence of interacting molecular gas traced by OH, providing further support for OH's ability to trace HII region-molecular cloud interactions.

 This study investigates the origin of gas fueling secondary star formation, i.e., rejuvenation in nearby galaxies. From the MaNGA IFU survey, we use stellar absorption features D$_n$4000 and H$\delta_A$ to identify regions that started the rejuvenation within the last $\sim$200~Myr. We compare the gas-phase metallicity, metallicity gradients, environments, and H\Romannum{1} gas fractions of the rejuvenating galaxies (RJGs) to controlled star-forming and quiescent galaxy samples. We demonstrate that, for the majority of RJGs, the rejuvenating gas is originally in the galaxy rather than accreted gas. The evidence includes: (1) gas metallicities consistent with the mass-metallicity relation of SF galaxies; (2) metallicity gradients that are not flattened, arguing against radial inflows; (3) gas velocities in rejuvenating regions consistent with their surroundings, and (4) high H\Romannum{1} gas fractions comparable to SF galaxies, indicating a pre-existing reservoir. Furthermore, we find no evidence that the rejuvenating events are triggered by tidal interactions with neighbors. While internal processes appear to dominate, we also present a clear example of rejuvenation triggered by gas accretion. The galaxy MaNGA 12080-12705 hosts a low-metallicity, kinematically distinct star-forming region in an overall old, massive galaxy, providing unambiguous evidence of an external origin, such as accretion or a minor merger. Our analysis demonstrates that using D$_n$4000 and EW(H$\delta_A$) provides a reliable way to identify current rejuvenation events in large spectroscopic surveys. The method will enable statistical studies to understand rejuvenation across cosmic time.

 - **Abstract**
 We have observed the low-mass molecular cloud core G204.4-11.3A2-NE (G204NE) in the direction of Orion B giant molecular cloud with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array in Band 6. The $\rm 1.3\ mm$ continuum images and visibilities unveil a compact central structure with a radius of $\sim$12 au, while showing no signature of binarity down to 18 au. The bolometric temperature and luminosity of this source are derived to be ${\sim}$33 K and $\sim$1.15 $~L_{\odot}$, respectively. Chemical stratification is observed in dense gas tracers, with C$^{18}$O emission peaking at the continuum position surrounded by the spatially extended emission of N$_2$D$^+$ and DCO$^+$. This implies that the core is in a very early evolutionary stage in which $\rm CO$ depletion occurs in most regions except for a small area heated by the central source. The envelope kinematics indicates a rotating and infalling structure with a central protostar mass of 0.08-0.1 $M_{\odot}$. The protostar drives a collimated outflow traced by CO, SiO, SO, and H$_2$CO, with misaligned blueshifted and redshifted lobes exhibiting a pair of bow-like patterns. High-velocity jets, extending up to 720 au, are detected in CO, SiO, and SO lines. The jet launching region is likely within twice of the dust sublimation zone. The absence of a binary signature suggests the outflows and jets are driven by a single protostar, although a close binary cannot be ruled out. The observed deflection of the outflows and jet is likely due to turbulent accretion in a moderately magnetized core.

 - **Abstract**
 X-ray observations of the tidal disruption event (TDE) candidate AT 2019avd show drastic variabilities in flux and spectral shape over hundreds of days, providing clues on the accretion disc-corona evolution. We utilize a disc-corona model, in which a fraction of the gravitational energy released in the disc is transported into the hot corona above/below. Some soft photons emitted from the disc are upscattered to X-ray photons by the hot electrons in the optically thin corona. By fitting the NICER observations of AT 2019avd during epochs when the spectra exhibit significant hardening, we derive the evolution of the mass accretion rate, $\dot{m}$, and the coronal energy fraction, $f$. Our results show that $f$ decreases with increasing $\dot{m}$, which is qualitatively consistent with that observed in active galactic nuclei (AGNs), while the slope of this source, $f\propto \dot{m}^{-0.30}$, is much shallower than that of AGNs. We also find that the non-thermal X-ray spectrum in this source is significantly softer than those typically seen in AGNs and black-hole X-ray binaries. We argue that these quantitative differences can be a powerful diagnostic of the underlying magnetic turbulence, which may imply a stronger magnetic field within the TDE accretion disc than that in typical AGNs. It is also found that the evolution of the fitted neutral hydrogen column density follows a similar pattern to that of the accretion rate evolution, which may reflect the accumulation of absorbing material originating from the inflowing streams of stellar debris and/or other related sources.

 - **Abstract**
 The Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) is a Compton telescope designed to survey the 0.2 - 5 MeV sky, consisting of a compact array of cross-strip germanium detectors. It is planned to be launched in 2027 into an equatorial low-Earth (530 km) orbit with a prime mission duration of 2 years. The observation of MeV gamma rays is dominated by background, mostly from extragalactic and atmospheric photon but also from the activation of the detector materials induced by cosmic-ray interactions. Thus, background simulation and identification are crucial for the data analysis. In this work we perform Monte Carlo simulations of the background for the first 3 months in orbit, and we extrapolate the results to 2 years in orbit, in order to determine the build-up of the activation due to long-lived isotopes. We determine the rates of events induced by the background that are reconstructed as Compton events in the simulated COSI data. We find that the extragalactic background photons dominate at low energies (<660 keV), while delayed activation from cosmic-ray primaries (proton/alpha) and albedo photons dominate at higher energies. As part of this work, a comparison at low latitude (<1 deg) between recent measurement of the SAA by the High-Energy Particle Detector (HEPD-01) on board the China Seismo-Electromagnetic Satellite (CSES-01) and the AP9/AE9 model has been made, showing an overestimation of the flux by a factor 9 by the model. The systematic uncertainties associated with these components are quantified. This work marks a major step forward in estimating and understanding the expected background rates for the COSI satellite mission.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Current exoplanet surveys are focused on detecting small exoplanets orbiting in the liquid-water habitable zones of their host stars. Despite the recent significant advancements in instrumental developments, the current limitation in detecting these exoplanets is the intrinsic variability of the host star itself. Aims. Our aim is to use the full CARMENES guaranteed time observations (GTO) data set spanning more than 8 years of observations of over 350 stars to investigate the wavelength dependence of high-precision radial velocities (RV), as stellar activity features should exhibit a wavelength dependence while the RV variation due to an orbiting planet will be wavelength independent. Methods. We use the chromatic index (CRX) to quantify the slope of the measured RVs as a function of logarithmic wavelength. We investigate the dependence of the CRX in the full CARMENES GTO sample on 24 stellar activity indices in the visible and near-infrared channels of the CARMENES spectrograph and each star's stellar parameters. We also present an updated convective turnover time scaling for the calculation of the stellar Rossby number for M dwarfs. Results. Our results show that approximately 17\% of GTO stars show a strong or a moderate correlation between CRX and RV. We can improve the measured RVs by a factor of up to nearly 4 in rms by subtracting the RV predicted by the CRX-RV correlation from the measured RVs. Mid M dwarfs with moderate rotational velocities, moderate CRX-gradients and quasi-stable activity features have the best rms improvement factors. Conclusions. We conclude that the CRX is a powerful diagnostic in mitigation of stellar activity and the search for low mass rocky planets.

 - **Abstract**
 We review major achievements in our understanding of multiphase coronal plasma, where cool-dense and hot-tenuous matter coexists, brought about by advances in modeling and theory, inspired by observations. We give an overview of models that self-consistently form solar (or stellar) prominences and filaments, or (postflare) coronal rain, and clarify how these different phenomena share a common physical origin, relating radiative losses and coronal heating. While we do not fully understand the coronal heating, multi-dimensional models of solar prominence and rain formation demonstrate how thermal instability triggers condensations, and how their morphology may reveal aspects of the applied heating at play. We emphasize how the many pathways to linear instability due to combined ingredients of heat-loss, gravity, flows, and magnetic topologies are all involved in the resulting nonlinear magnetohydrodynamics. We provide some challenges to future model efforts, especially concerning prominence fine structure, internal dynamics, and their overall lifecycle.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have begun to reveal a surprising morphological diversity in galaxies within the first billion years after the Big Bang, including indications of structural maturity previously thought to arise much later. These findings raise fundamental questions about when and how well-known structural components of galaxy morphology, such as bulges and disks, first emerged. However, directly identifying and resolving such structures at z $>$ 6 remains challenging due to limited spatial resolution and sensitivity. In this work, we present a clear and robust morphological analysis of a sample of 190 galaxies at z $>=$ 6, demonstrating that distinct bulge and disk components were already beginning to emerge during this early epoch. Using multi-component light profile fitting, we model the radial brightness distributions of a subset (20) of galaxies with an inner spheroidal (Sersic) component and an underlying exponential disk. These systems exhibit high bulge-to-total (B/T) light ratios (~ 0.47) and central stellar mass surface densities (~ 2.82*10$^{8}$ M$_{sun}$ kpc$^{-2}$ ) - values close to those of nearby quiescent galaxies. Combined with their intense central star formation rate surface densities (~ 1.26*10$^{1}$ M$_{sun}$ yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$ ), our results indicate a rapid building of inner stellar mass and bulge assembly within these young systems. We propose that these early bulge-disk galaxies represent progenitors of massive star-forming and quiescent systems observed at lower redshifts. Their subsequent evolution may proceed through physical processes such as disk growth, compaction, quenching, or bulge-disk co-evolution, driven by both internal dynamics and external interactions.

 - **Abstract**
 Brown dwarfs display Jupiter-like auroral phenomena, such as rotationally modulated electron cyclotron maser radio emission. Radio observations of cyclotron maser emission can be used to measure their magnetic field strength, topology, and to deduce the presence of magnetically interacting exoplanets. Observations of the coldest brown dwarfs (spectral types T and Y) are especially intriguing, as their magnetospheric phenomena could closely resemble those of gas-giant exoplanets. Here we report observations made over ten epochs, amounting to 44 hours, of WISEP J101905.63+652954.2 (J1019+65 hereinafter) using the LOFAR telescope between 120 and 168 MHz. J1019+65 is a methane dwarf binary (T5.5+T7) whose radio emission was originally detected in a single-epoch LOFAR observation to be highly circular polarised and rotationally modulated at $\approx 3$h. Unexpectedly, our long-term monitoring reveals an additional periodic signature at $\approx 0.787$h. We consider several explanations for the second period and suggest that it could be the rotationally modulated emission of the second brown dwarf in the binary, although follow-up infrared observations are necessary to confirm this hypothesis. In addition, the data also allow us to statistically estimate the duty cycle and observed radio-loud fraction of the 120-168\,MHz cyclotron emission from methane dwarfs to be $\langle D \rangle = 0.030^{+0.034}_{-0.030}$ and $F^{'}_{\rm radio} = 0.088^{+0.168}_{-0.088}$ respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the analysis of 900 ks high-resolution RGS XMM-Newton observations of the nearby Seyfert galaxy Mrk 509 with the use of a self-consistent warm absorber (WA) model. We perform a physically motivated approach to the modeling of WA as a stratified medium in constant total pressure (CTP) regime. Powerful outflows are fundamental ingredients of any active galactic nuclei (AGN) structure. They may significantly affect the cosmological environment of their host galaxy. High-resolution X-ray data are best suited for outflow's studies, and the observed absorption lines on heavy elements are evidence of the physical properties of an absorbing gas. Our models allow us to fit continuum shapes bounded together with the line profiles, which gives additional constraints on the gas structure of WA in this source. In this work, we benchmark and test the CTP model on the soft X-ray spectrum of Mrk 509. A grid of synthetic absorbed spectra was computed with the photoionization code Titan assuming that the system was under CTP. As an illuminating spectral energy distribution (SED), we used the most actual multiwavelength observations available for Mrk 509. We apply these models to the high-resolution spectrum of the WA in the Mrk 509, taking into account cold/warm/hot Galactic absorption on the way to the observer. CTP gas with $\log \xi_{0} \sim 1.9$, defined on the cloud surface, fits the data well. A higher ionization component is needed for Ne X absorption. The best-fit model is optically thin with $\log N_{\rm H }= 20.456 \pm 0.016$. The lines are non-saturated, and the CTP spectral fit aligns with previous analyses of Mrk 509 with a constant density WA. The model constrains the gas density, placing the WA cloud at 0.02 pc, consistent with the inner broad line region and the thickening region of the accretion disk.

 - **Abstract**
 The Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager (SO/PHI) onboard Solar Orbiter is a spectropolarimeter scanning the Fe I line at 617.3 nm, providing data of the solar photosphere. The same line is sampled by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and many other on-ground instruments. In this paper, we aim at assessing the consistency between line-of-sight (LoS) velocity measurements from the two instruments. Reliable measurements of up and down flows from SO/PHI are crucial and unique when Solar Orbiter is facing the far side of the Sun. Also, a combination of measurements from two vantage points to study horizontal flows must rely on consistent observations. For this purpose, we compare the LoS velocity measured by SO/PHI's High Resolution Telescope (SO/PHI-HRT) and SDO/HMI on 29 March 2023, when Solar Orbiter was crossing the Sun-Earth line at a distance of 0.39 au from the Sun. Because such co-alignments are rare, this configuration offered an almost unique opportunity to directly compare data products from both telescopes. The data are aligned and remapped to allow a pixel-by-pixel comparison of the whole time series of 4 hours length. Temporal and spatial variations are considered for a direct combination of the measurements. The LoS velocity distributions are evaluated and a clear linear relation is found between the two instruments with a slope of 0.94 and a correlation of 90%. We find that the signals form at similar heights, with a separation of 10$\pm$12 km, which is larger than previous estimates. A close-up look at the penumbra of a sunspot and its Evershed flow is presented. We conclude that the signals inferred by SO/PHI-HRT and SDO/HMI show very good agreement and high correlation when instrumental effects and large-scale velocities on the Sun are properly accounted for.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations suggest that planetary engulfment by a giant star may produce radiation that resembles subluminous red novae. We present three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of the interaction between an eccentric $5 \,M_J$ giant planet and its $1\,M_\odot$ red-giant host star. The planet's pericenter is initially $60\%$ of the stellar radius and is fully engulfed after tens of orbits. Once inside the stellar envelope, the planet generates pressure disturbances that steepen into shocks, ejecting material from the envelope. We use post-processing to calculate the light curves produced by planetary engulfment. We find that the hot stellar ejecta enhances the stellar luminosity by several orders of magnitude. A prolonged hydrogen recombination plateau appears when the ejecta cools to about $10^4\,\rm{K}$. The late-time rapid dimming of the light curve follows dust formation, which obscures the radiation. For planets with lower eccentricity, the orbital decay proceeds more slowly, although the observable properties remain similar.

 A review of publications devoted to the study of the characteristics of the Radcliffe wave has been given. The advent of mass measurements of radial velocities of stars has recently led to a number of interesting results obtained from the analysis of spatial velocities of stars and open star clusters. An important place in the study has been given to issues related to the clarification of the direct or indirect influence of magnetic fields on the process of formation of the Radcliffe wave. The hypothesis of Parker instability of the galactic magnetic field as one of the reasons for the formation of wave-type inhomogeneities in the galactic disk has been discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 We combine weak lensing, galaxy clustering, cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing, and their cross-correlations (so-called 6$\times$2pt) to constrain cosmology and baryonic feedback scenarios using data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Y3 Maglim catalog and the Planck satellite PR4 data release. We include all data points in the DES Y3 cosmic shear two-point correlation function (2PCF) down to 2.$^\prime$5 and model baryonic feedback processes via principal components (PCs) that are constructed from the ANTILLES simulations. We find a tight correlation between the amplitude of the first PC $Q_1$ and mean normalized baryon mass fraction $\bar{Y_\mathrm{b}}=\bar{f}_\mathrm{b}/(\Omega_\mathrm{b}/\Omega_\mathrm{m})$ from the ANTILLES simulations and employ an independent $\bar{Y_\mathrm{b}}$ measurement from Akino et al. (2022) as a prior of $Q_1$. We train a neural network $6\times2$pt emulator to boost the analysis speed by $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$, which enables us to run an impressive number of simulated analyses to validate our analysis against various systematics. For our 6$\times$2pt analysis, we find $S_8=0.8073\pm0.0094$ when including a $Q_1$ prior from $\bar{Y_\mathrm{b}}$ observations. This level of cosmological constraining power allows us to put tight constraints on the strength of baryonic feedback. We find $Q_1=0.025^{+0.024}_{-0.029}$ for our 6$\times$2pt analysis and $Q_1=0.043\pm{0.016}$ when combining with external information from Planck, ACT, DESI. All these results indicate weak feedback, e.g., the tensions to Illustris ($Q_1=0.095$) and OWLS AGN T8.7 ($Q_1=0.137$) are 2.9$\sigma$-3.3$\sigma$ and 4.7$\sigma$-5.9$\sigma$, respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 Turbulence is a ubiquitous process that transfers energy across many spatial and temporal scales, thereby influencing particle transport and heating. Recent progress has improved our understanding of the anisotropy of turbulence with respect to the mean magnetic field; however, its exact form and implications for magnetic topology and energy transfer remain unclear. In this Letter, we investigate the nature of magnetic anisotropy in compressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence within low-$\beta$ solar wind using Cluster spacecraft measurements. By decomposing small-amplitude fluctuations into Alfvén and compressible modes, we reveal that the anisotropy is strongly mode dependent: quasi-parallel (`slab') energy contains both Alfvén and compressible modes, whereas quasi-perpendicular (`two-dimensional'; 2D) energy is almost purely Alfvénic, a feature closely linked to collisionless damping of compressible modes. These findings elucidate the physical origin of the long-standing `slab+2D' empirical model and offer a new perspective on the turbulence cascade across the full three-dimensional wavevector space.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the properties of extreme emission line galaxies (EELGs) at $z=4-9$ and their role in reionization. Compact, low-mass galaxies with intense optical emission lines are linked to elevated specific star formation rates (sSFRs) and recent bursts of star formation. Feedback in these systems may enable the leakage of ionizing radiation into the intergalactic medium. Using JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy from the CAPERS, CEERS, and RUBIES surveys, we compile 160 NIRCam-selected EELGs in the EGS field. These galaxies show extreme rest-frame equivalent widths (EWs), with a median EW([O III]+H${\beta}$)=1616Å and EW(H${\alpha}$)=763Å. They are low-mass (median log(M$_{\star}$/M$_{\odot}$)=8.26) with high sSFRs (median 43 Gyr$^{-1}$), above the $z\sim6$ main sequence. UV slopes are diverse, with a mean $\beta=-2.0$, and only 7% have extremely blue continua ($\beta<-2.6$). Emission-line diagnostics suggest stellar populations as the primary ionizing source, although an AGN fraction of 14% is found. These galaxies are efficient ionizing photon producers, with mean log($\xi_{\rm ion}$ [Hz erg$^{-1}$])=25.34, exceeding typical values at similar redshifts. Escape fractions, however, are heterogeneous: 9% of EELGs show escape fractions $>$10% for both Ly${\alpha}$ and LyC photons, while 82% lack detectable Ly${\alpha}$ emission. The median inferred LyC escape fraction is modest (4.4%) but enhanced in super-Eddington systems with sSFR >25 Gyr$^{-1}$. The galaxies are extremely compact, with a median effective radius of 0.49 kpc, and exhibit a recent star-formation burst. Our analysis indicates that sSFR and star-formation rate surface density are the primary drivers of their extreme emission line strengths.

 - **Abstract**
 The expansion history of the Universe prior to Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) remains largely unconstrained. The high-energy post-inflationary era may involve multiple distinct epochs, each characterized by a different equation of state (EoS). A key prediction of inflation is the generation of tensor perturbations that later manifest as a stochastic background of primordial gravitational waves (GWs). The large-scale amplitude and small-scale spectral tilt ($n_{\rm GW}$) of these GWs encode the inflationary energy scale and the subsequent expansion history, respectively. A soft post-inflationary EoS ($w<1/3$) yields red-tilted GW spectra ($n_{\rm GW}<0$), while a stiff EoS ($w>1/3$) results in a blue-tilt ($n_{\rm GW}>0$). In our previous work [arXiv:2407.07956], we developed an analytical framework for computing the GW spectral energy density, $\Omega_{\rm GW}(f)$, for multiple post-inflationary transitions ($w_1 \to w_2 \to \cdots \to w_n \to 1/3$), focusing on the parameter space relevant for future GW observations. In this paper, we extend that framework to systematically investigate the $morphological~diversity$ of inflationary GW spectra generated by multi-epoch post-inflationary histories. Remaining model agnostic, we demonstrate that a wide variety of spectral shapes, ranging from convex and concave monotonic profiles to multi-peaked non-monotonic spectra, can naturally emerge depending on the sequence and duration of these epochs. We also introduce GWInSpect, a publicly available Python package that computes $\Omega_{\rm GW}(f)$ for arbitrary sequences of EoS transitions, providing a practical tool to study the pre-BBN expansion history of the Universe.

 Powerful, large-scale relativistic jets are usually associated with massive, old elliptical galaxies. This paradigm has recently been challenged by the identification of narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLSy1) galaxies, thought to be young active galactic nuclei with low-mass black holes, harboring relativistic jets. Among them, sources hosting $>$100 kpc radio jets are extremely rare. Here, we report the discovery of large-scale, double-lobed radio structures in 33 NLSy1s with the projected linear size of at least 100 kpc from a recently published catalog of 22656 NLSy1 galaxies. These 33 include 29 confirmed double-lobed sources and 4 candidates whose radio structure requires further study. We suggest that their low black hole masses are unlikely to be due to their small angles of inclination to the line of sight. These enigmatic sources were identified by examining the radio observations taken with the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty centimeters, Very Large Array Sky Survey, Low Frequency Array, and Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey. Among them, the NLSy1 source J1318+2626 ($z=0.62$) is found to host a radio jet with the projected linear size of 4.3 Mpc, making it the only NLSy1 galaxy hosting a Mpc-scale radio jet known as of today. We conclude that future observations of NLSy1 sources with the next generation of sensitive telescopes may reveal a much larger population harboring large-scale jets, thus providing crucial clues on their origin, propagation, and interaction with the ambient environment.

 - **Abstract**
 A recent asteroseismic analysis suggests that Kepler-56 -- a planet-hosting red giant -- exhibits a unique spin structure: (1) the spin axes of the core and envelope are misaligned; and (2) the envelope rotates approximately an order of magnitude faster than typical red giants. In this paper, we investigate a feasible scenario to reproduce this spin structure by estimating the amount of the angular momentum (AM) supply from the planets through the simplified calculation of the time evolution of AM. As a result, unless the tidal efficiency is extremely high, we show that the tidal interactions between the known close-in planets (Kepler-56 b and c) are insufficient to supply the AM required to accelerate Kepler-56 from the spin rate observed in typical red giants. We also show that the engulfment of a hot Jupiter can be expected to provide sufficient AM supply for the acceleration ant that the mass and orbit of the engulfed hot Jupiter are constrained by a mass of 0.5-2 Jupiter masses and an orbital period of 1-6 days. On the other hand, if Kepler 56 was already rapidly spinning before entering the RG stage and requires no acceleration, the obliquity damping by the known close-in planets can reproduce the spin structure of Kepler-56. Even in such cases, planetary engulfment during the MS stage might be involved in achieving rapid spin before the tidal alignment. These discussions demonstrate the importance of Kepler-56 as a candidate for planetary engulfment that may leave traces of its spin structure.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a simulation-based forward-modeling framework for cosmological inference from optical galaxy-cluster samples, and apply it to the abundance and weak-lensing signals of DES-Y1 redMaPPer clusters. The model embeds cosmology-dependent optical selection using a counts-in-cylinders approach, while also accounting for cluster miscentering and baryonic feedback in lensing. Applied to DES-Y1, and assuming a flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, we obtain $\Omega_m=0.254^{+0.026}_{-0.020}$ and $\sigma_8=0.826^{+0.030}_{-0.034}$, consistent with a broad suite of low-redshift structure measurements, including recent full-shape analyses, the DES/KiDS/HSC 3$\times$2 results, and most cluster-abundance studies. Our results are also consistent with \textit{Planck}, with the difference being significant at $2.58\sigma$. These results establish simulation-based forward-modeling of cluster abundances as a promising new tool for precision cosmology with Stage~IV survey data.

 - **Abstract**
 We present analysis of JWST NIRCam and NIRSpec observations of the galaxy SXDF-NB1006-2 at $z = 7.212$, as part of the Reionization and the ISM/Stellar Origins with JWST and ALMA (RIOJA) project. We derive the physical properties by conducting spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, revealing that our target is a young (age $\sim2$ Myr) starburst galaxy with intense radiation field. We detect multiple nebular emission lines from NIRSpec IFS data. We identify a robust broad component of [O III]$\lambda5008$ emission, indicating the presence of ionized gas outflows. The derived gas depletion time of a few hundred Myr implies that our target could be one of the progenitors of massive quiescent galaxies at $z\sim4-5$ identified by recent JWST observations. The spatial distribution of optical and far-infrared (FIR) [O III] emission lines differs in morphology, likely resulting from different critical densities and inhomogeneous density distributions within the galaxy. Potential old stellar populations may be necessary to account for the derived metallicity of $\sim0.2\,\rm{Z}_\odot$, and their presence can be confirmed by future MIRI observations. Including our target, star-forming galaxies at $z>6$ detected by ALMA are generally very young but more massive and brighter in UV than galaxies identified by only JWST. The ALMA-detected galaxies may also have a steeper mass-metallicity relation. These findings suggest that the ALMA-detected galaxies may have experienced more efficient mass assembly processes in their evolutionary pathways.
#### Radiation-dominated polar emitting region of an accreting X-ray pulsar -- I. Polarization- and spectrum-dependent structure, and the emergent continuum

 - **Abstract**
 The radiation-dominated polar emitting region of an accreting X-ray pulsar is simulated numerically in the framework of a three-dimensional (geometrically two-dimensional) model. The radiative transfer within the emitting region and the structure of the latter are calculated with the use of the self-consistent algorithm developed earlier. The magnetic scattering cross sections dependent on the photon energy and polarization have been incorporated. Second-order bulk Comptonization over entire emitting region, induced Compton scattering, the switching of the polarization modes, free-free processes, the cyclotron emission because of electron-proton collisions, and a realistic shape of the accretion channel have been taken into account. The case of a dipole magnetic field is considered. It is shown that the induced Compton effect can play a notable role in establishing the electron temperature in the post-shock zone. Within the model shock wave, a higher electron temperature is achieved than in the post-shock zone by means of the bulk-heating mechanism. The photons, gained the energy in the shock wave and above it due to bulk motion effects and the thermal Doppler effect, are responsible for the formation of high-energy regions in the emergent continuum of the polarization modes.
