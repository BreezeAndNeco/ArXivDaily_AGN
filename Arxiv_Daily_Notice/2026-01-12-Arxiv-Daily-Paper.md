#### Interaction of the central jet with the surrounding gas in the protostellar outflow from IRAS 04166+2706

 - **Abstract**
 $Context.$ The outflow from the Class 0 protostar IRAS 04166+2706 (hereafter IRAS 04166) contains a remarkably symmetric jet-like component of extremely high-velocity (EHV) gas. $Aims.$ We studied the IRAS 04166 outflow and investigated the relation between its EHV component and the slower outflow gas. $Methods.$ We mosaicked the CO(2--1) emission from the IRAS 04166 outflow using the 12m and the Compact Arrays of ALMA. We also developed a ballistic toy model of the gas ejected laterally from a jet to interpret the data. $Results.$ In agreement with previous observations, the ALMA data show that the slow outflow component is distributed in two opposed conical lobes and has a shear-flow pattern with velocity increasing toward the axis. The EHV gas consists of a series of arc-like condensations that span the full width of the conical lobes and merge with their walls, suggesting that the fast and slow outflow components are physically connected. In addition, position--velocity diagrams along the outflow axis show finger-like extensions that connect the EHV emission with the origin of the diagram, as if part of the EHV gas had been decelerated by its interaction with the low-velocity outflow. A ballistic model can reproduce these finger-like extensions assuming that the EHV gas consists of jet material that has been ejected laterally over a short period of time and has transferred part of its momentum to the surrounding shear flow. $Conclusions.$ The EHV gas in the IRAS 04166 outflow seems to play a role in the acceleration of the slower gas component. The presence of similar finger-like extensions in the position-velocity diagrams of other outflows suggests that this process may be occurring in other systems, even if the EHV component is not seen because it has an atomic composition.

 - **Abstract**
 Multiwavelength observations, from radio to X-rays, have revealed the presence of multiphase high-velocity gas near the center of the Milky Way likely associated with powerful galactic outflows. This region offers a unique laboratory to study the physics of feedback and the nature of multiphase winds in detail. To this end, we have developed physically motivated semi-analytical models of a multiphase outflow consisting of a hot gas phase ($T \gg 10^6$ K) that embeds colder clouds ($T \sim 5000$ K). Our models include the gravitational potential of the Milky Way; the drag force exerted by the hot phase onto the cold clouds; and the exchange of mass, momentum, and energy between gas phases. Using Bayesian inference, we compared the predictions of our models with observations of a population of HI high-velocity clouds detected up to $\sim$1.5 kpc above the Galactic plane near the Galactic center. We find that a class of supernova-driven winds launched by star formation in the central molecular zone can successfully reproduce the observed velocities, spatial distribution, and masses of the clouds. In our two-phase models, the mass and energy loading factors of both phases are consistent with recent theoretical expectations. The cold clouds are accelerated by the hot wind via ram pressure drag and via accretion of high-velocity material, resulting from the turbulent mixing and subsequent cooling. However, this interaction also leads to gradual cloud disruption, with smaller clouds losing over 70\% of their initial mass by the time they reach $\sim$2 kpc.

 - **Abstract**
 Reionization marks one of the most important phase transitions in the history of the Universe, during which neutral baryonic matter was transformed into ionized plasma. While star-forming galaxies are widely regarded as the primary drivers of this process, the extent to which active galactic nuclei (AGNs) contribute remains a subject of ongoing investigation. In this study, we integrate a physically motivated AGN spectral energy distribution (SED) model with state-of-the-art observations to reassess the contribution of AGNs to cosmic reionization. Our findings indicate that adopting a more sophisticated AGN SED model could substantially increase the predicted ionizing photon output by a factor of 3$\sim$4, elevating AGNs to a more significant role ($\approx$20\%) in maintaining reionization than previously estimated. The inclusion of abundant faint AGNs further amplifies this contribution by a factor of a few. These conclusions remain robust across a wide range of accretion rates and ionizing photon escape fractions. Collectively, our results suggest that AGNs may have played a more prominent and previously underestimated role in the reionization of the Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Despite early theoretical expectations that large-scale, massive outflows would be triggered by accretion onto black holes and neutron stars, their presence was not firmly established until the 2000s. Since then, they have been recognised as a common, perhaps ubiquitous, feature of accretion discs in X-ray binaries. Over the past two decades, our understanding of these outflows has expanded significantly, with their associated phenomenology now observed across the X-ray, ultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared regimes. In this review, we provide a comprehensive summary of the observational properties of both low- and high-ionisation winds, treating each separately as well as part of a broader phenomenon, and place these findings in the context of current theoretical modelling. We discuss their close connection with disc atmospheres, their impact on the accretion process, and their role within the broader framework that includes the radio jet and the different accretion flow configurations and states. We also address current challenges and outline some of the anticipated developments, particularly those linked to upcoming observational facilities.

 - **Abstract**
 General relativity is exquisitely tested in strong-field regimes, yet its validity on cosmological scales remains largely unexplored. Upcoming wide and deep large-scale structure surveys will access the ultra-large, linear scales where relativistic effects - Doppler terms, gravitational redshift, lensing magnification, and potential evolution - leave significant imprints in the clustering of galaxies. These signatures represent unique probes of spacetime that are inaccessible to standard Newtonian analyses but increasingly important as survey volumes grow. We outline the scientific potential of next-generation facilities, such as those envisioned within ESO's Expanding Horizons programme, to deliver the first robust measurements of relativistic effects in large-scale structure through multi-tracer power spectra and the single-tracer bispectrum of high-redshift Lyman-break galaxies. Detecting these contributions would open a new window on gravity, enabling precision tests of general relativity and its alternatives on cosmological scales in the 2040s.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The solar atmosphere is gravitationally stratified and consists of several layers at temperatures different by orders of magnitude. Consequently, the solar atmospheric plasma changes from weakly ionized in the photosphere, partially ionized in the chromosphere, to eventually fully ionized in the corona. However, it is still not trivial to integrate ionization and recombination processes into multi-fluid solar plasma models with gravitational stratification. Aims. We intend to provide a method for constructing multi-fluid-multi-species gravitational stratification that satisfies ionization equilibrium and hydrostatic equilibrium at the same time, avoiding causing non-physical disturbances and numerical instability due to initial in-equilibria. Methods. We assume that collisional interactions between fluids are sufficient for coupling all fluids when there is no high-frequency external driving force imposed. Ionization fractions can be (I) calculated assuming ionization in statistical equilibrium at any given temperature, or (II) extracted from other atmospheric models. A simple numerical integration routine is then designed and used to construct multi-fluid-multi-species gravitational stratifications. Results. A gravitational stratification constructed using the present numerical integration routine can be in hydrostatic equilibrium with any given ionization fractions of multi-species plasmas. Meanwhile, without any dynamic driving force, fluid decoupling appears in the transition region of the constructed stratification, while the total velocity of all fluids remains zero. Conclusions. A gravitational stratification constructed using the present routine can be used in multi-fluid-multi-species models to study specific dynamics without being affected by initial in-equilibria.

 - **Abstract**
 The spectrophotometric flux calibration of recent spectroscopic surveys has reached a limiting systematic precision of approximately 1-3 percent, and is often biased near the wavelengths associated with H I Balmer absorption. As we prepare for the next generation of imaging and spectroscopic surveys, and high-precision cosmology experiments, we must find a way to address this systematic. Towards this goal, we have identified a global network of 29 bright (G < 17.5) featureless white dwarf stars that have a spectral energy distribution consistent with an almost pure blackbody form over the entire optical and near-infrared wavelength range. Based on this sample, we have computed the systematic uncertainty and AB magnitude offsets associated with Gaia, SDSS, SMSS, PanSTARRS, DES, and 2MASS, and we have also checked the consistency of our objects with both GALEX and WISE. The magnitude range of the featureless stars reported here are ideally suited to observations taken with the forthcoming generation of extremely large telescopes, as well as calibrating the survey data acquired by the Rubin, Euclid and Roman observatories. Finally, all of the high-precision spectrophotometric standard stars reported here have been included in the latest release of the PypeIt data reduction pipeline.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we quantify the effects of solar wind expansion on the dispersive properties of the three normal modes of ideal MHD using the Expanding Box Model, under a background magnetic field that follows the Parker spiral geometry. From the linearized MHD-EBM equations, we construct the dispersion tensor and derive analytical expressions for the eigenfrequencies $\omega(k,R)$, magnetic compressibility $C_B$, and the ratio of the parallel electric field to the perpendicular magnetic field $|\delta E_\parallel|/|\delta B_\perp|$ of the magnetosonic modes to quantify how radial solar wind expansion reshapes the character of compressive fluctuations in the solar wind. Magnetic compressibility increases with heliocentric distance, and this trend shows a better alignment with in-situ observations when expansion is included from the MHD-EBM framework. $C_B$ shows a well-defined minimum at small radii and then increases linearly with distance, which naturally reproduces the observed transition from Alfvénic to compressive fluctuations between $\sim$0.3-1 AU. The ratio $|\delta E_\parallel|/|\delta B_\perp|$ reveals opposite behaviors for the fast and slow modes: while the fast mode becomes more electrostatic with increasing distance, the slow mode evolves to a more magnetically dominated character. Expansion reduces the growth of their electromagnetic/compressive balance at large radii. Our results demonstrate that solar wind expansion actively redistributes energy between magnetically compressive modes and purely transverse fluctuations with respect to the background magnetic field, playing a major role in shaping the radial evolution of wave dynamics throughout the inner heliosphere.

 - **Abstract**
 The density distribution within molecular clouds offers critical insights into their underlying physical processes, which are essential for understanding star formation. As a statistical measure of column density on the cloud scale, the shape and evolution of the column density probability density function (N-PDF) serve as important tools for understanding the dynamics between turbulence and gravity. Here we investigate the N-PDFs of Cygnus-X using the column density map obtained from Herschel, supplemented by HI and Young Stellar Objects (YSO) data. We find that the N-PDFs of Cygnus-X and four sub-regions display log-normal + power-law shapes, indicating the combined effects of turbulence and gravity in sculpting the density structure. We find evidence that the power-law segment of the N-PDFs flattens over time, and the transitional column density can be seen as a unique and stable star formation threshold specific to each molecular cloud. These results not only clarify the physical state of Cygnus-X but also emphasize the utility of the N-PDF as a statistical diagnostic tool, as it is an accessible indicator of evolutionary stages and star formation thresholds in molecular clouds.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.05363

 - **Abstract**
 Type I superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) are a diverse class of exceptionally bright massive star explosions, which typically exhibit absorption from ionised oxygen in their early spectra. While their photometric properties (luminosity and duration) both span an order of magnitude, population studies suggest that these distributions are continuous. However, spectroscopic samples have shown some indications of distinct sub-types, either through similarity to certain prototype objects, or in terms of their velocity evolution. Here we show that a well-observed SLSN, PTF12dam, completely changes its O II absorption profile as it rises to maximum light, moving from one proposed sub-type to another. This supports an interpretation where spectroscopic diversity is driven by the ejecta temperature at maximum light, rather than fundamental differences in the explosion or progenitor. Motivated by this, we develop a new diagnostic, the Brightness-Timescale-Temperature-Radius diagram, and a simple toy model for the evolution of the photospheric velocity, to show that diversity in the light curve rise time (likely due to differences in ejected mass) naturally explains why SLSNe with broader light curves generally have weaker O II lines, lower photospheric velocities after maximum, and slower changes in photospheric velocity over time. We show that the velocity distribution of the known SLSN population favours a relatively flat ejecta density profile, consistent with a hot bubble inflated by a central engine.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the successful detection of the "Arid" Meteor Shower (IAU\#1130 ARD), predicted to emerge for the first time in 2021, using a publicly accessible YouTube live camera developed by us. This live camera, installed on the Subaru Telescope dome in the summit region of Maunakea, Hawai'i, features a wide field of view (70 deg by 40 deg) and high sensitivity, capable of observing stars fainter than 6th magnitude. Meteor detection was performed in two ways: visual inspection by citizen viewers and subsequent validation through automated detection. As a result, we confirmed that the number of meteors appearing from near the predicted radiant increased by more than six times (~9 sigma) compared to the preceding and following days. Our observation time was 4-5 hours after the predicted peak (solar longitude = 193.9 deg), providing clear data indicating that the activity had not yet declined. Optical observations at this time from the Northern Hemisphere are extremely limited and unique, making our observation point valuable. The meteors are characterized as slow and faint appearance, but several brighter meteors with wakes were also observed. Simulations tracing the dust trails from the parent body, Comet 15P/Finlay, suggest that our detection can be explained by either the dust trails released in 2008 or 2014, both requiring high ejection velocities. However, during the comet's 2008 return, its activity was exceptionally quiet, making a high-velocity dust ejection questionable. On the other hand, multiple large outbursts were observed during the 2014 return, at which time a certain amount of high-velocity dust release is expected. We conclude that the dust source of the meteor shower detected in Hawai'i this time is likely attributable to high-velocity (~67 m s-1) dust ejected during the 2014 outburst.
#### The Cosmic-ray Knee as a Local Signature of Nearby PeVatrons

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.05435

 - **Abstract**
 A "knee" in the cosmic-ray spectrum, characterized by a sudden steepening of the spectral shape at $\sim 4$ PeV, may be interpreted either as a global feature of Galactic cosmic rays or as a local signature. In the former scenario, cosmic-ray spectra throughout the Galaxy would be similar to that observed in the solar neighborhood, and the knee would be a common feature of the cosmic-ray sea. In the latter scenario, the PeV cosmic-ray flux varies across the Galactic disk, and the knee is dominantly contributed by a small number of nearby sources. By simulating cosmic-ray propagation in the Galactic magnetic field and interstellar medium, we show that the two scenarios correspond to different regimes of the birth rate of PeV proton accelerators and depend on the presence of powerful nearby sources. By comparison with both cosmic-ray and gamma-ray observations, we find that a local knee would be best explained by sources located at distances of order $\sim1$ kpc and with ages in the range 0.1-1 Myr, with the Cygnus Cocoon being a particularly promising candidate.
#### Structural Tilting and Depth-Dependent Behavior of Equatorial Rossby Waves

 - **Abstract**
 Over the past decade, solar equatorial Rossby waves have been unambiguously identified and are considered potential diagnostics of solar interior dynamics. We investigate their inclined structure and temporal evolution in the solar interior across multiple depths using approximately 14.5 yr of ring-diagram (RD) and time-distance (TD) helioseismology data from SDO/HMI. Normalized phase differences and cross power are computed from filtered spherical harmonic coefficients of radial vorticity to probe the structural tilt and power of Rossby waves. We find a systematic and robust depth-dependent phase behavior that shows no clear significant correlation with the solar cycle, while the depth-dependent cross power exhibits a positive correlation with the solar cycle for both datasets. Our results show that deeper depths lead in phase over shallower ones, with increasing negative phases with depth. We infer that Rossby waves exhibit a retrograde tilt relative to the Sun's rotation that is stable throughout the solar cycle. Analogous small tilts have been noted in planetary atmospheres and in magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the Sun, indicating that this behavior is not uncommon in rotating, stratified bodies and has implications for angular momentum and energy transport in the solar interior.

 - **Abstract**
 High-precision photometric standard stars play a key role in enabling accurate photometric calibration and advancing various fields of astronomy. However, due to limitations in calibration methods and the limited availability and underuse of high-precision reference data, existing photometric standard stars may suffer from insufficient numbers, systematic errors exceeding 10 milli-magnitude (mmag), limited photometric band coverage, or incomplete sky coverage, among other issues. To overcome these limitations, we have constructed the largest (over 200 million stars, 1000 times the widely recognized Landolt standards in the same magnitude range), most precise (better than 10 mmag), and most comprehensive (over 200 bands, nearly 40 times the coverage of traditional standards) all-sky standard stars. Based on standards, we have calibrated multiple survey datasets to mmag precision, and subsequently developed a complete sky distribution of stars for the Pan-STARRS system. This database, the BEst STars Database (BEST), is expected to pave the way for achieving mmag-level - or even higher - photometric precision in large-scale surveys, and to play a central role in shaping a high-precision astronomical measurement framework.
#### Backlighting young stellar objects in the Central Molecular Zone: an ensemble-averaged abundance structure of methanol ices

 - **Abstract**
 The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) contains a substantial reservoir of dense molecular gas, where numerous young stellar objects (YSOs) and dense cloud cores have been identified. However, the large distance and severe foreground extinction complicate interpretation of infrared ice absorption features tracing chemical and evolutionary properties of these embedded objects. To better characterise YSOs and dense cores in this region, we combined spectra from multiple YSOs, each likely backlit by a giant star, allowing us to probe their outer layers and derive an ensemble-averaged ice abundance profile. We obtained L-band spectra of 15 point-like sources with extremely red colours using Gemini/GNIRS, enabling measurements of the CH3OH absorption feature at 3.535 micron. To better constrain the foreground extinction and H$_2$O ice column densities, we combined these data with K-band and mid-infrared spectra using NASA/IRTF and Spitzer/IRS. We found that the CH$_3$OH abundance in the CH$_3$OH-CO$_2$ ice mixture is 2 to 5 percent, confirming that it is systematically lower than those typically observed in the Galactic disk. Furthermore, by using the local excess of foreground extinction as a proxy for the projected distance between a backlit source and the centre of a YSO, we found that the CH$_3$OH abundance relative to solid CO$_2$ remains near 10 percent in the inner regions of the envelope, but increases sharply to about 30 percent in the outer regions. The relatively low methanol ice abundance may reflect the unique chemical environment of the CMZ. However, our results offer an alternative interpretation: since our sample is biased towards massive and luminous YSOs, intense heating from the central protostar may have caused substantial sublimation of methanol ice in the inner regions of their envelopes, thereby systematically lowering the observed CH$_3$OH/H$_2$O ice ratios.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are among the most energetic phenomena in the solar system, often impacting space weather and terrestrial technologies. In this study, we utilize SunPy, an open-source Python library for solar physics, to analyze solar active regions and their correlation with flare and CME events observed on 4th January 2025. Data from GOES, SDO (AIA and HMI), Solar Oribter (STIX), e-CALLISTO, Aditya L1 (SUIT), and SOHO are processed to track flare intensity, active region evolution, shock wave and CME dynamics. The analyzed flare is identified as an X1.8-class event, and our study highlights key magnetic precursors that led to it. This work enhances understanding of solar eruption precursors and supports future predictive models for space weather forecasting.
#### Data post-processing gain resulting from the patchy nature of speckles

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.05598

 - **Abstract**
 The data post-processing gain is an important parameter for exposure time calculations used to inform the design of the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). Assuming azimuthally symmetric noise properties is a common simplifying assumption for such simulations, which neglects the patchy nature of the residual diffracted starlight; i.e., speckles. Fortunately, patchiness might prove to be an opportunity that improves the overall sensitivity of observatory assuming photon-noise limited speckle subtraction. We illustrate this effect in the context of angular differential imaging (ADI), which is one of the possible observing strategies being considered for the detection and characterization of exo-Earth with HWO. We show that combining observations of two observatory roll angles leads to a gain in signal-to-noise greater than $\sqrt{2}$ when the patchy starlight dominates other noise sources. The gain can be closer to x2 when the starlight dominates the noise budget by more than an order of magnitude. In other words, combining good and bad observations is better than combining two average ones. This statement is very general as it is a direct consequence of combining data with a weighted mean. It applies more broadly to any combination of observations with varying noise level.
#### Dust-obscured radio-emitting tidal disruption event coincident with a high-energy neutrino event

 - **Abstract**
 Despite the growing number of high-energy neutrinos (TeV-PeV) detected by IceCube, their astrophysical origins remain largely unidentified. Recent observations have linked a few tidal disruption events (TDEs) to the production of high-energy neutrino emission, all of which display dust-reprocessed infrared flares, indicating a dust- and gas-rich environment. By cross-matching the neutrino events and a sample of mid-infrared outbursts in nearby galaxies with transient radio flares, we uncover an optically obscured TDE candidate, SDSS J151345.75 $+$ 311125.2, which shows both spatial and temporal coincidence with the sub-PeV neutrino event IC170514B. Using a standard equipartition analysis of the synchrotron spectral evolution spanning 605 days post mid-infrared discovery, we find a little evolution in the radio-emitting region, with a kinetic energy up to $10^{51}$ erg, depending on the outflow geometry and shock acceleration efficiency assumed. High-resolution European VLBI Network imaging reveals a compact radio emission that is unresolved at a scale of $<$ 2.1 pc, with a brightness temperature of $T_b>5\times10^6$ K, suggesting that the observed late-time radio emission might originate from the interaction between a decelerating outflow and a dense circumnuclear medium. If the association is genuine, the neutrino production is possibly related to the acceleration of protons through pp collisions during the outflow expanding process, implying that the outflow-cloud interaction could provide a physical site with a high-density environment for producing the sub-PeV neutrinos. Such a scenario can be tested with future identifications of radio transients coincident with high-energy neutrinos.
#### Energy Bounds from Relative Magnetic Helicity in Spherical Shells

 - **Abstract**
 Relative magnetic helicity is commonly used in solar physics to avoid the well known gauge ambiguity of standard magnetic helicity in magnetically open domains. But its physical interpretation is difficult owing to the invocation of a reference field. For the specific case of spherical shell domains (with potential reference field), relative helicity may be written intrinsically in terms of the magnetic field alone, without the need to calculate the reference field or its vector potential. We use this intrinsic expression to prove that non-zero relative helicity implies lower bounds for both magnetic energy and free magnetic energy, generalizing the important Arnol'd inequality known for closed-field magnetic helicity. Further, we derive a stronger energy bound by spatially decomposing the relative helicity over a magnetic partition of the domain to obtain a new ideal invariant which we call unsigned helicity. The bounds are illustrated with analytical linear force-free fields (that maximize relative helicity for given boundary conditions) as well as a non-potential data-driven model of the solar corona. These bounds confirm that both relative helicity and the unsigned helicity can influence the dynamics in the solar corona.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a milliarcsecond-resolution radio survey of 17 high-redshift (4 < z < 5.4) blazar candidates observed with the European Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) Network at 5 GHz. The primary objective of this study was to investigate the nature of these distant active galactic nuclei (AGN) and to confirm their blazar nature. Utilizing the technique of VLBI, we obtained high-resolution radio images of compact core and core-jet structures. To confirm the classification of these sources, we collected multi-band archival data, including total radio flux densities from single-dish and low-resolution interferometric surveys, optical astrometric positions from Gaia, and X-ray data. These diagnostics collectively help distinguish between blazars and misaligned jetted AGN. We were able to measure the core brightness temperatures and found that 11 objects show the Doppler-boosted emission expected from blazars. For five additional sources, we do not see evidence of Doppler boosting even if X-ray data suggest that the source is a blazar. These could be either borderline objects or variability may have affected the classifications, considering that VLBI and X-ray data are not simultaneous. Finally, for the two remaining objects the data suggest a non-blazar classification. Our findings confirm that a significant fraction of these high-redshift radio-loud quasars are blazars and mainly characterized by compact core structures. Overall, the VLBI classifcations are consistent with the X-ray classes. This study further increases the sample of VLBI-imaged radio quasars at z > 4 by ~10%, offering valuable on the population of AGN in the early Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar-mass black holes (BHs) can form from the near-complete collapse of massive stars, causing them to abruptly disappear. The star M31-2014-DS1 in the Andromeda galaxy was reported to exhibit such a disappearance between 2014 and 2022, with properties consistent with the failed explosion of a $\approx 12 - 13$ M$_\odot$ yellow supergiant leading to the formation of a $\approx 5$ M$_\odot$ BH. We present mid-infrared (MIR) observations of the remnant obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and X-ray observations from the Chandra X-ray Observatory in 2024. The JWST MIRI/NIRSpec data reveal an extremely red source, showing strong blueshifted absorption from molecular gas (CO, CO$_2$, H$_2$O, SO$_2$) and deep silicate dust features. Modeling the dust continuum confirms continued bolometric fading of the central source to $\log(L/L_\odot)\approx3.88$ ($\approx7-8$% of the progenitor luminosity), surrounded by a dust shell spanning $\approx40-200$ au. Modeling of the molecular gas indicates $\sim 0.1$ M$_\odot$ of gas expanding at $\approx 100$ km s$^{-1}$ near the inner edge of the dust shell. No X-ray source is detected down to a luminosity limit of $L_X\lesssim1.5\times10^{35}$ erg s$^{-1}$. We show that the panchromatic observations are explained by (i) a low-energy ($\approx10^{46}$ erg) ejection of the outer H-rich progenitor envelope and (ii) a fading central BH powered by inefficient ($\sim0.1$% in mass) accretion of loosely bound fallback material. The analysis robustly establishes the bolometric fading of M31-2014-DS1 and provides the first cohesive insights into BH formation via low-energy explosions and long-term fallback.

 - **Abstract**
 The recent microcalorimetric X-ray observations of the Coma cluster by XRISM have sparked active discussion regarding the physical origin of its gas velocity features. Here, we demonstrate that an off-axis minor merger in its early phase $-$ when the infalling subhalo is near its primary apocenter and the stripped tail is not yet mixed with the main cluster atmosphere $-$ can drive intracluster gas motions generally consistent with the XRISM results. These include a pronounced velocity gradient and an approximately uniform velocity dispersion of $\simeq100-200\,\rm{km\,s^{-1}}$ in the cluster core. Our merger scenario was originally suggested in Lyskova et al. (2019) to reproduce the major X-ray morphological features of Coma. In addition, we introduce a simple and robust diagnostic of intracluster gas motions based on the ratio of the line-of-sight velocity to the velocity dispersion.

 - **Abstract**
 The structure of the accretion disk in AGN is still an unsolved question, especially how it may change with Eddington ratio. Here we examine the accretion disk in the super-Eddington AGN I Zw 1 using reverberation mapping of the optical continuum. We use three years of optical monitoring with Las Cumbres Observatory at sub-day cadence in $uBgVriz_s$. The lag-wavelength spectrum, calculated using the cross correlation method and PyROA, shows a $u$-band excess. PyROA lags are equally well fitted with a thin and slim disk profile. The UV/optical AGN spectral energy distribution is consistent with a thin disk. The disk size at 4495 Å for a thin disk model is $4.23\pm0.24\:\mathrm{ld}$ and for a slim disk model is $1.71\pm0.09\:\mathrm{ld}$, larger by a factor of $2-4$ than the fiducial disk size of $1.07\pm0.15\:\mathrm{ld}$ as determined using the Eddington ratio. We find evidence of different size scales probed with different variability timescales. Lags evaluated at longer variability timescales increase as do frequency-resolved lags at low frequencies, which we interpret as an additional secondary reprocessor at large radii consistent with the broad-line region (BLR) in I Zw 1. The high frequency lags, predicted well with just a disk, are fit with a thin disk profile and a size of $0.61\pm0.37\:\mathrm{ld}$. This indicates that the actual disk size may be on the order of the fiducial size. We also collate the most extensive set of directly measured internal sizes of an AGN, from optical to mid-infrared with reverberation mapping and optical interferometry. Assuming that the disk is indeed the fiducial size, these show little evidence that the accretion disk extends into the BLR significantly, tentatively disfavouring the failed radiatively accelerated dust driven outflow BLR formation model.
#### Feasibility of event-by-event primary mass discrimination using radio observables and supervised machine learning

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we investigate the feasibility of event-by-event primary mass discrimination using radio observables only. Although the analysis does not require an explicit reconstruction of the shower maximum ($X_{max}$), the discrimination power still arises from the sensitivity of the radio observables to the longitudinal development of the extensive air shower (EAS). Such radio-based approaches could be particularly relevant for radio-only experiments, such as GRAND. To assess this feasibility, we obtained conservative upper limits for the discrimination accuracy using a supervised machine-learning (ML) algorithm, namely a random forest (RF). The input features used were the peak electric fields and the spectral slopes, which have complementary discrimination power, along with the antenna distances to the shower axis. The RF was trained and tested using large event sets generated by the fast radio emission simulation and simplified detector response implemented in the RDSim framework. We obtained discrimination accuracies between 81\% and 96\% over the studied zenith range, even after normalizing each shower by its own electromagnetic energy. Since the analysis includes deliberately conservative choices, such as a large 10\% uncertainty on the reconstructed EM energy, these quoted values should be interpreted as conservative upper limits suitable for a feasibility assessment. Our results demonstrate that event-by-event primary mass discrimination using radio observables is, in principle, feasible.
#### Radial differential rotation leading to dipole collapse in pre-main-sequence stars

 - **Abstract**
 Despite progress in the observations of stellar magnetic fields, their physical mechanisms remain poorly understood. During the pre-main sequence (PMS) phase, the inner layers of stars contract and a radiative core gradually develops. In contrast, the convective envelope is gradually braked through magnetic interactions with the accretion disk and winds. With developing differential rotation inside the star, PMS phase is thus a critical period for magnetic properties of stars when strong initial dipoles can get perturbed, leading to the observed diversity in the magnetism on the main sequence (MS). In this work, we study the impact of differential rotation on such fields. We perform three-dimensional anelastic convective dynamo simulations of rotating spherical shells with an imposed differential rotation (shear) between the boundaries. Density, gravity profiles and convective zone thicknesses were set close to those predicted in PMS low-mass stars by one-dimensional stellar evolution code Cesam2k20. Our results show that radial differential rotation can induce dipole collapse leading to weaker, oscillatory magnetic fields. Differential rotation seems to perturb $\alpha^2$ dynamo mechanism, responsible for dipolar magnetic fields, by shearing poloidal field lines and by affecting turbulent magnetic transport processes. This collapse is moderated by the relative importance of shear compared to the vigor of convective motions, with exact stability criterion depending on the field strength and the size of the radiative core. Applying DNS-based stability criterion in PMS stellar evolution models, we qualitatively reproduce the trends observed in the magnetic topologies of low-mass stars when assuming an efficient internal angular momentum redistribution. This suggests that stellar magnetic properties are intimately related to the PMS angular momentum evolution.
#### An Improved UV-Optical Diagnostic for Rejuvenating Galaxies in the Local Universe and Implications for Galaxy Evolution

 - **Abstract**
 Rejuvenating galaxies are important probes of galaxy evolution, yet identifying them observationally is challenging as constraining recent star formation histories requires both photometric and spectroscopic data. We present a method for identifying rejuvenating galaxies in the local Universe using ultraviolet (UV) imaging and optical spectroscopy, building on a recent selection that identifies a system as rejuvenating if it is quenched in the near-UV (NUV; tracing $\sim\!100\,\mathrm{Myr}$ timescales) but star-forming in H$\alpha$ (tracing $\sim\!10\,\mathrm{Myr}$ timescales). Shortly after a star formation episode, however, the NUV is dominated by the same massive stars that power H$\alpha$, so these indicators do not always trace distinct timescales. To address this, we derive a relation that predicts the NUV emission associated with the ionizing O-star population traced by H$\alpha$, enabling us to isolate the NUV contribution from longer-lived stars (primarily B/A stars with $M\lesssim\!20\,M_\odot$). Subtracting the predicted O-star NUV from the dust-corrected NUV yields a more reliable rejuvenation diagnostic. Using this method, we identify $\sim\!10^{4}$ rejuvenating galaxies in a sample of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) galaxies ($\sim\!4.5\%$). These galaxies have intermediate stellar masses and are found primarily in lower-density environments, becoming increasingly rare toward the centers of groups and clusters. Rejuvenating galaxies also exhibit systematically lower gas-phase metallicities, consistent with fueling by the accretion of metal-poor gas.

 - **Abstract**
 Blazars, a type of active galactic nuclei (AGN) with relativistic jets pointed at the observer, exhibit flux variability across the electromagnetic spectrum due to particle acceleration in their jets. Power spectral density (PSD) studies show breaks at specific frequencies, particularly in X-rays, linked to the accretion regime and black hole mass. However, very-high-energy gamma-ray PSD breaks remain unexplored due to current instrument limitations. The Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), with up to ten times greater sensitivity compared to current generation instruments, will allow precise PSD reconstruction and unprecedented study of blazar flares. These flares reveal key insights into particle acceleration, photon production, and jet properties. The AGN monitoring and flare programs in CTAO's Key Science Project aim to deepen our understanding of blazar emissions.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the identification of a pair of faint little red dots (LRDs), dubbed Red Eyes, in a strongly-lensed galaxy at $z\sim7$ behind the PLCKG004.5-10.5 cluster, identified from the JWST Treasury program VENUS. Red Eyes are spatially resolved on the image plane with distinct colors, while the critical curve lies far north of Red Eyes, clearly requiring two different LRDs rather than a single LRD. Red Eyes is an extremely close pair of LRDs separated by $\sim70\,\mathrm{pc}$ in the source plane with a magnification of $\mu\sim20$, which consistently explains another counter-image detected to the north-west. Red Eyes is hosted in a typical star-forming galaxy with $M_{\mathrm{UV,int}}\sim -19$, but its own UV emission is very faint ($M_{\mathrm{UV,int}} \gtrsim -16$). Moreover, Red Eyes does not reside at the galaxy center but lies at an offset position of approximately one effective radius $R_{\mathrm{e}}$ away from the galaxy center. If observed without lensing, Red Eyes would appear as a typical star-forming galaxy at $z\sim 7$ with $M_{\mathrm{UV}}\sim -19$, showing no apparent LRD signatures in either morphology or SED. These results suggest that multiple off-center LRDs, similar to Red Eyes, may be commonly hidden in a typical high-$z$ star-forming galaxy. In this case, various plausible scenarios may emerge, one of which is that intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) with $M_\mathrm{BH}\sim10^{4\text{--}6}\,M_\odot$ may form in star clusters on a stellar disk and contribute to the growth of the central supermassive black hole via mergers, with some IMBHs detectable as luminous LRDs in a sufficiently active and massive phase.

 - **Abstract**
 Over the next two decades, gravitational-wave (GW) observations are expected to evolve from a discovery-driven endeavour into a precision tool for astrophysics, cosmology, and fundamental physics. Current second-generation ground-based detectors have established the existence of compact-binary mergers and enabled GW multi-messenger astronomy, but they remain limited in sensitivity, redshift reach, frequency coverage, and duty cycle. These limitations prevent them from addressing many fundamental open questions in cosmology. By the 2040s, wide-field electromagnetic surveys will have mapped the luminous Universe with unprecedented depth and accuracy. Nevertheless, key problems including the nature of dark matter, the physical origin of cosmic acceleration, the properties of gravity on cosmological scales, and the physical conditions of the earliest moments after the Big Bang will remain only partially constrained by electromagnetic observations alone. Progress on these fronts requires access to physical processes and epochs that do not emit light. Gravitational waves provide a unique and complementary observational channel: they propagate over cosmological distances largely unaffected by intervening matter, probe extreme astrophysical environments, and respond directly to the geometry of spacetime. In this context, next-generation GW observatories such as the Einstein Telescope (ET) will be transformative for European astronomy. Operating at sensitivities and frequencies beyond existing detectors, ET will observe binary black holes and neutron stars out to previously inaccessible redshifts, enable continuous high signal-to-noise monitoring of compact sources, and detect gravitational-wave backgrounds of astrophysical and cosmological origin. Together with space-based detectors, ET will play a central role in advancing our understanding of cosmic evolution and fundamental physics.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational wave events with electromagnetic counterparts provide direct measurements of the Hubble diagram. We demonstrate that incorporating weak lensing into bright standard siren analyses allows measurements of cosmological parameters that do not influence the mean luminosity distance-redshift relation but do impact the cosmic structures. In particular, we examine the prospects for measuring the standard deviation of matter perturbations $\sigma_8$, in addition to the Hubble constant and the matter abundance. We find that a $10\%$ measurement of $\sigma_8$ would be feasible with ET, provided a population of $300$ neutron star binaries with electromagnetic counterparts is observed. With LISA, the measurement of $\sigma_8$ would have $30\%$ accuracy, assuming a population of $12$ massive black hole binaries with electromagnetic counterparts is observed.
