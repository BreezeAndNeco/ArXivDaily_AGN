#### An Investigation into the Low-Mass Fundamental Metallicity Relation in the Local and High-z Universe

 - **Abstract**
 Recent JWST/NIRSpec observations have revealed high-$z$ star-forming galaxies depart from the Fundamental Metallicity Relation (FMR), yet the $z = 0$ FMR has not been well-characterized in the low-mass regime ($\rm log(M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) \lesssim 9$) for an appropriate comparison of low- and high-$z$ systems. We attempt to rectify this limitation through a meta-analysis, providing a local, observational comparison for future high-$z$ FMR studies. We analyzed common FMR fitting methods for $\sim 700$ [OIII]$\lambda 4363$ emitters with $\rm log(M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) \lesssim 9$ at $z \sim 0$. We find no evidence of the FMR below $\rm log(M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) \lesssim 9$ through any method, suggesting that slowly-evolving, quasi-steady state gas reservoirs are not yet established. We simultaneously find a weak positive correlation between metallicity and star formation, and that these systems are gas-rich with substantial diversity in effective yields ($y_{\rm eff}$) spanning $\rm \sim 3~dex$. We demonstrate increasing $y_{\rm eff}$ correlates with decreasing FMR offsets, which in the context of the analytical and non-equilibrium gas models of Dalcanton et al. (2007), indicates a scenario where star formation bursts rapidly return and eject metals from the ISM before subsequent gas-balancing. Pristine infall diluting the ISM metal-content cannot lead to the $y_{\rm eff}$ diversity we measure, and thus is not the primary process behind FMR deviations. Our results suggest low-$\rm M_{\star}$ systems, regardless of redshift, depart from a steady-state gas reservoir shaping the canonical FMR, in which metallicity variations are primarily driven by star formation and enriched outflows. With this characterization, we demonstrate $z \gtrsim 3$ [OIII]$\lambda 4363$ systems are indeed more metal-poor than $z \sim 0$ counterparts ($\rm \Delta 12+log(O/H) = 0.3~dex$) at fixed $\rm M_{\star}$.
#### Impact of Neutrino Flavor Conversions on Neutron Star Merger Dynamics, Ejecta, Nucleosynthesis, and Multi-Messenger Signals

 - **Abstract**
 We present numerical relativity simulations of binary neutron star mergers incorporating neutrino flavor transformations triggered by fast flavor instability, quantum many-body effects, or potential beyond standard model physics. In both long-lived and short-lived remnant scenarios, neutrino flavor conversions modify species-dependent neutrino luminosities and mean energies, and drive the matter towards more neutron rich conditions. They produce up to $300\%$ more neutron rich ejecta and significantly boost the r-process yields, especially in low-density, near-equatorial outflows. We identify regions unstable to fast flavor instabilities and find that these instabilities persist despite flavor conversions. We further test the sensitivity to the equilibration timescale of the flavor conversions, finding that slower flavor conversions can interact with thermodynamic equilibration, and increase the neutron richness of the ejecta. Flavor conversions may also contribute to stronger gravitational wave and neutrino emissions, pointing to a correlation between neutrino transport and merger dynamics. These results highlight the potential impact of flavor conversions while motivating future work to improve on theoretical understanding of flavor instabilities in global simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the orbital eccentricity evolution of supermassive black hole binaries within galactic environments. We analyze the dynamics in triaxial merger remnants and subsequent interactions with geometrically thick nuclear discs. We confirm that gravitational torques in triaxial potentials efficiently extract angular momentum, resulting in binary formation with high initial eccentricities. We then analyze the binary-disc interaction using a 3D analytical framework incorporating the Airy formalism and potential softening. We present a self-consistent derivation demonstrating that the 3D suppression of high-order torques leads to distinct scalings with disc thickness ($h$): migration rates $\tau_a^{-1} \propto h^{-3}$ and eccentricity damping rates $\tau_e^{-1} \propto h^{-5}$. This establishes a timescale hierarchy, $\tau_e/\tau_a \propto h^2$. For typical parameters ($h\approx 0.2$), eccentricity damping is significantly faster than orbital decay ($\tau_e \approx 0.04 \, \tau_a$). We further develop a wavelet-based formalism to quantify the impact of disc inhomogeneities arising from accretion feedback and turbulence. We derive the stochastic torque variance in the wavelet domain and employ a Fokker-Planck analysis to determine the equilibrium eccentricity distribution. While stochastic fluctuations counteract deterministic damping, the strong damping imposed by the thick disc geometry ensures the equilibrium eccentricity remains small unless the fluctuations are highly non-linear. Hence, even if born highly eccentric, SMBHBs are rapidly circularized. This circularization trap forces binaries to approach the gravitational wave-dominated regime on nearly circular orbits, prolonging the total merger timescale. This introduces a substantial cosmological delay governed by stellar relaxation, which impacts detection rates and the modeling of SMBH assembly in cosmological frameworks.
#### Gradus.jl: spacetime-agnostic general relativistic ray-tracing for X-ray spectral modelling

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.15049

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce this http URL, an open-source and publicly available general relativistic ray-tracing toolkit for spectral modelling in arbitrary spacetimes. Our software is written in the Julia programming language, making use of forward-mode automatic differentiation for computing the Christoffel symbols during geodesic integration, and for propagating derivatives through the entire ray-tracer. Relevant numerical methods are detailed, and our models are validated using a number of tests and comparisons to other codes. The differentiability is used to optimally calculate Cunningham transfer functions -- used to efficiently pre-compute relativistic effects in spectral models. A method is described for calculating such transfer functions for disc with non-zero vertical height, including the treatment of self-obscuration. An extension of the transfer function formalism that includes timing information is described, and used to calculate high-resolution reverberation lag spectra for a lamppost corona. The lag-frequency and lag-energy spectra for a Shakura-Sunyaev accretion disc with various lamppost heights and Eddington ratios are calculated, and the general impact of disc thickness in reflection models is discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 Some compact stars may contain deconfined quark matter, forming hybrid stars or quark stars. If the quark matter forms an inhomogeneous condensate in the crystalline color superconducting phase, its rigidity may be high enough to noticeably alter the stellar properties. In this paper, we investigate whether these elastic stars follow the universal relations, i.e., relations insensitive to equations of state, that have been well established for fluid stars. We improve upon previous studies by allowing quark matter in the background, static, and spherically symmetric configuration to be sheared. Such background shear can be treated in the form of an effective pressure anisotropy. We then calculate the moment of inertia $I$, tidal deformability ${\lambda}_2$, and spin-induced quadrupole moment $Q$ of these models with pressure anisotropy. The $I$-${\lambda}_2$-$Q$ universal relations for the elastic hybrid (quark) star models are valid up to a variation of $\approx2\,(3)\%$, larger than that for typical fluid star models, when the maximal magnitude of quark matter shear modulus is considered in the crystalline color superconducting phase from realistic calculations. The uncertainty in universal relations related to the stellar compactness for these elastic star models, on the other hand, remain comparable to those for typical fluid star models. Our results demonstrate the validity of universal relations for hybrid stars and quark stars with a realistic degree of pressure anisotropy due to the crystalline color superconducting quark matter.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the formulation, algorithm and numerical tests of the magnetohydrodynamic-particle-in-cell (MHD-PIC) method with particles treated under the guiding center approximation, which we term the MHD-gPIC method, and it is implemented in the Athena++ MHD code. The new MHD-gPIC model consists of thermal (cold) fluid and high-energy particles whose dynamics are integrated through guiding center equations including drift motion, with carefully evaluated source terms as particle backreaction. The code is validated with a series of tests, and it is expected to be primarily applicable to study particle acceleration and transport in systems where gyro-resonance is considered insignificant. We also present preliminary studies of particle acceleration during non-relativistic magnetic reconnection.

 - **Abstract**
 The correlation between optical starlight polarization and polarized thermal dust emission can be used to infer intrinsic dust properties. This correlation is quantified by the ratio Rp/p, which has been measured to be 5.42 +/- 0.05 MJy sr^-1 at 353 GHz when averaged over large areas of the sky. We investigate this correlation using newly published stellar polarimetric data densely sampling a continuous sky region of ~4 square degrees at intermediate Galactic latitude. We combine RoboPol optical polarization measurements for 1,430 stars with submillimeter data from the Planck satellite at 353 GHz. We perform linear fits between the Planck (Qs, Us) and optical (qv, uv) Stokes parameters, accounting for the differences in resolution between the two datasets as well as the distribution of clouds along the line of sight. We find that in this region of the sky the Rp/p value is 3.67 +/- 0.05 MJy sr^-1, indicating a significantly shallower slope than that found previously using different stellar samples. We also find significant differences in the fitted slopes when fitting the Qs-qv and Us-uv data separately. We explore two explanations using mock data: miscalibration of polarization angle and variations in Rp/p along the line of sight due to multiple clouds. We show that the former can produce differences in the correlations of Qs-qv and Us-uv, but large miscalibration angles would be needed to reproduce the magnitude of the observed differences. Our simulations favor the interpretation that Rp/p differs between the two dominant clouds that overlap on the sky in this region. The difference in Rp/p suggests that the two clouds may have distinct dust polarimetric properties. With knowledge from the tomographic decomposition of the stellar polarization, we find that one cloud appears to dominate the correlation of Us-uv, while both clouds contribute to the correlation of the Qs-qv data.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar flares are intense bursts of radiation caused by magnetic reconnection events on active stars. They are especially frequent on M dwarfs, where they can strongly influence planetary habitability. Flare frequency distributions (FFDs) are usually modeled as power laws, but recent studies have proposed alternatives such as lognormal distributions, implying different flare mechanisms and planetary impacts. This work investigates which statistical distribution best describes flare occurrences on M dwarfs, considering both equivalent duration (ED), the quantity directly measured from photometry, and bolometric energy, which is more relevant for habitability assesments. We analyzed 110 M dwarfs observed with TESS and CHEOPS, detecting 5,620 flares. Complex events were decomposed, detection biases corrected, and FFDs from both missions scaled to build a combined distribution spanning nearly 10 orders of magnitude in bolometric energy. ED-based FFDs follow a power law, reflecting intrinsic photometric flare occurrence. However, bolometric energy-based FFDs deviate from a pure power law, being better described by a lognormal distribution or, more accurately, by a truncated power law with a break near $10^{33}$ erg, the typical superflare threshold. This truncation suggests a change in flare-generation physics between regular flares and superflares, with implications for the cumulative impact on exoplanetary atmospheres. The apparent low-energy flattening previously attributed to lognormal behavior arises from observational biases, while the drop in flare frequency above $10^{35}$ erg remains unexplained, possibly reflecting an intrinsic cutoff or current observational limits. The upcoming PLATO mission will be well suited to probe both regimes.

 - **Abstract**
 We report our near-infrared (NIR) follow-up observations of the gravitational wave (GW) event S240422ed using the Subaru Telescope/MOIRCS. S240422ed was initially classified as a black hole-neutron star merger with $>$ 99% probability of electromagnetic wave emission. We started follow-up observations 7.8 hours after the event. Over two nights, we observed 206 nearby galaxies in $Y$ and $K_{\rm s}$ bands down to about 21.4 and 21.1 AB mag (3$\sigma$), respectively. The total completeness of our survey based on galaxy $B$-band luminosity is 22%. As a result of our observations, five candidate counterparts were identified. We show that properties of these five objects are not consistent with kilonova such as AT2017gfo. Four objects are consistent with known classes of transients such as supernovae or dwarf nova outbursts. On the other hand, the nature of the remaining one object, which shows a red color and rapid decline, remains unclear. Although later analyses of GW signal reclassified S240422ed as likely terrestrial noise, our NIR observations provide valuable lessons for future NIR surveys for GW sources. We demonstrate that deep NIR follow-up observations as presented in this work would effectively constrain the presence of red kilonova even at 200 Mpc distance. We also discuss the importance of deep and wide NIR reference images and of understanding the properties and frequency of Galactic transients.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Planetary nebulae are shells ejected by low- and intermediate-mass stars. The slow wind ejected by the asymptotic giant branch star is compressed by a fast stellar wind to produce an expanding gaseous shell surrounding a hot bubble. The shell is a source of thermal radio emission which shows a spectral index between -0.1 and 2. Only two planetary nebulae are known to show non-thermal radio emission indicating magnetic fields and non-thermal electrons. Aims. The aim of this paper is verification of presence of magnetic fields of planetary nebulae. Magnetic fields can have a significant influence on shaping planetary nebulae. Methods. We observed a sample of northern planetary nebulae in radio continuum at 144 MHz with the Low Frequency Array. We combined our observations with archival observations at higher frequencies. Results. The spectral indices in 30 planetary nebulae were below -0.1, indicating non-thermal radio emission. The majority of this sample consists of bipolar planetary nebulae, which are known to originate from binary central stars. Most of the nebulae have sizes larger than 20 arcsec. Magnetic fields and nonthermal emission may be common in smaller planetary nebulae, but can be suppressed by thermal emission. Our results suggest that different mechanisms can be responsible for the origin of magnetic fields and non-thermal emission in planetary nebulae.

 - **Abstract**
 Aims. Studying protostellar objects in their earliest stages, particularly during the Class 0 phase, provides key insight into the beginnings of planet formation and dust evolution. Disentangling the various components, however, is particularly challenging. High spatial and spectral resolution observations of molecular line emission with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) are therefore crucial for probing their complex environments. Methods. In this work, we present high-resolution ($\sim$30 au) ALMA observations at 1.3 millimeters of the Class 0 protostellar system IRAS4A2. Results. We detected large, well-traced outflows in HCN (3-2), H$_{2}$CO$(2_{1~2}-1_{1~1})$, and HCO$^{+}$ (3-2), along with numerous complex organic molecules (COMs) tracing central, more compact regions. Using moment maps, we analyzed the kinematics and spatial distributions of the molecular emission, revealing a wide range of spatial scales, from compact structures within the IRAS4A2 core at $\sim$8 au in radius, to extended $\sim$5000 au outflow emission. Specifically, we find that CH$_{3}$CDO and CH$_{3}$OCHO could be both good tracers of the disk, possibly tracing its rotation. Lines of OCS (22-21), SO$_{2}~(13_{3~11}-13_{2~12})$, HCN, H$_{2}$CO, and HCO$^{+}$, show more extended structures around IRAS4A2, likely tracing the envelope, disk, accretion shocks, the base of an outflow, and the outflow itself. Conclusions. Most COMs appear to trace distinct inner regions near the central protostar, while other molecules trace more extended structures, such as the envelope or outflows. The kinematics, emission patterns, and position-velocity diagrams suggest that individual molecules trace multiple components simultaneously, making it challenging to disentangle their true origins. Altogether, these findings highlight the complex spatial distribution within the IRAS4A2 system. Abridged.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission from cosmic ray (CR) protons scattering off the gas in the intracluster and intergalactic medium (ICM and IGM) remains out of reach for current observations. Detecting this emission would provide constraints on intergalactic magnetic fields as well as dark matter interaction models. Aims: We aim to provide estimates for diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission in the Fermi-LAT band from galaxy clusters and the cosmic web in the local Universe. Methods: In this work we show results from the first cosmological MHD simulation with an on-the-fly spectral CR model. We model CR injection at shocks, account for adiabatic energy changes and advection of CR protons, and obtain their $\gamma$-ray emissivity directly from the simulated CR energy density and spectra. For this we use constrained initial conditions, which evolve in a field closely resembling that of the local Universe, allowing direct comparison to Fermi-LAT data on massive clusters. Results: We find CR proton acceleration at all structure formation and accretion shocks in galaxy clusters and cosmic web filaments. These protons provide the basis for diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission in these regimes. The absolute value of the diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission in our simulation lies a few orders of magnitude below the current upper limits found by Fermi-LAT. Under the assumption of our model, a sensitivity of $F_\gamma < 10^{-11} \: \gamma~ \text{s}^{-1}~\text{cm}^{-2}$ is required for a detection of diffuse emission in Coma.
#### Glycolaldehyde and ethanol toward the L1157 outflow: resolved images and constraints on glycolaldehyde formation

 - **Abstract**
 Two main formation routes have been proposed for interstellar complex organic molecules (iCOMs): on dust grain surfaces and in the gas phase. Observing such molecules in protostellar outflow shock regions - provided that their ages are well-constrained - can help distinguish between these pathways by probing chemical evolution over time. This study focuses on the potential daughter-mother relationship of glycolaldehyde (CH$_2$OHCHO) and ethanol (C$_2$H$_5$OH), previously proposed in the literature. We test whether gas-phase reactions converting ethanol into glycolaldehyde derived in these works can explain the observed abundance of the latter in star-forming regions. We target the southern outflow of L1157, which hosts three shock regions, B0, B1 and B2, of increasing ages: about 900, 1500 and 2300 yr. We obtained high-resolution IRAM NOEMA maps of three lines of glycolaldehyde and one line of ethanol. We derived their abundances in the three shocks and used a pseudo time-dependent astrochemical model to simulate gas-phase and grain-surface formation scenarios for glycolaldehyde. Ethanol is assumed to form on grains and be released in the gas by shocks, where it is gradually converted into glycolaldehyde via the ethanol-tree reaction network. We present the first spatially resolved maps of glycolaldehyde and ethanol in the L1157 southern outflow, and more generally toward solar-like star forming regions. The abundance ratio [CH$_2$OHCHO]/[C$_2$H$_5$OH] increases from B1 to B2, consistent with model predictions. However, the model cannot reproduce all three shocked regions simultaneously, suggesting that one of the assumptions of our model, such as the same excitation temperature and grain composition in B0, B1 and B2, or gas temperature evolution, is wrong. Nonetheless, our modeling rules out the possibility that all the observed gaseous glycolaldehyde is a grain-surface product.

 - **Abstract**
 Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are the oldest but fastest pulsars known to date. To explain how these pulsars could be formed, a new hypothesis was formulated: the recycling of pulsars, i.e the fact that a pulsar could accrete matter from a companion and been spun up. In this paper, we developed a population synthesis algorithm for pulsars which belong to a binary, in order to check whether most of the observed recycled pulsars were formed via an accretion mechanism and derive statistics about their properties, that are difficult to obtain through observations. We also make predictions for future surveys. Toward the presented objectives, we use the code Stellar EVolution for N-body (SEVN) to take into account all the binary processes and our own code to evolve each pulsar self-consistently by taking into account the secular evolution of a force-free magnetosphere, the magnetic field decay, gravitational braking and spatial evolution. Each pulsar is born in binary with a main sequence companion, and evolve to present time. The radio and $\gamma$-ray emission locations were modeled by the polar cap geometry and striped wind model, respectively. Our simulations seem to reproduce well the population of radio and $\gamma$-ray pulsars observed in the selected surveys. We also found that there should be less than $330$ unidentified pulsars in the Fourth Fermi-LAT catalogue of $\gamma$-ray sources (4FGL). High values of the viewing angle $\zeta$ seem to be needed to be able to observe the recycled pulsars, and it also seems difficult to observe recycled pulsars with an aligned rotation axis and magnetic axis (i.e., $\chi \leq 10$°). We find that only a small fraction, approximately $\sim 7.5\times10^{-3}$ %, of oxygen-neon white dwarfs (ONeWDs) in binary systems appear to contribute to the population of mildly recycled pulsars through accretion-induced collapse.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the serendipitous discovery of two RR Lyrae stars exhibiting significant s-process element enrichment, a rare class previously represented solely by TY Gruis. Our goal is to characterise these objects chemically and dynamically, exploring their origins and evolutionary histories. Using high-resolution spectroscopy from HERMES@AAT and UVES@VLT, we derived detailed chemical abundances of key s-process elements, carbon along with $\alpha$-elements. We also employed Gaia DR3 astrometric data to analyse their kinematics, orbital properties, and classify their Galactic population membership. We compared observational results with theoretical asymptotic giant branch nucleosynthesis models to interpret their enrichment patterns. Both stars exhibit clear signatures of s-process enrichment, with significant overabundances in second-peak elements such as Ba and La compared to first-peak Y and Zr. Comparison with AGB nucleosynthesis models suggests their progenitors experienced pollution of s-process-rich material, consistent with early binary interactions. However, notable discrepancies in dilution factors highlight the need for more refined low-metallicity asymptotic giant branch (AGB) models. We also explore and discuss alternative scenarios, including sub-luminous post-AGB-like evolution or double episodes of mass this http URL findings confirm the existence of s-process-enhanced RR Lyrae stars and demonstrate the importance of combining chemical and dynamical diagnostics to unveil their complex evolutionary pathways. Future detailed binary evolution modelling and long-term orbital monitoring are essential to resolve their formation scenarios and assess the role of binarity in the evolution of pulsating variables.

 - **Abstract**
 The anisotropies of the Cosmic Neutrino Background (C$\nu$B) offer an ideal tool to test non-standard neutrino interactions, since they directly trace the perturbations in the neutrino distribution function. Here, we study how invisible neutrino decays impact the C$\nu$B anisotropies, in a framework where neutrinos decay non-relativistically to dark radiation and lighter neutrinos in a manner consistent with the measured mass splittings. For this purpose, we perform the first implementation of such a late-time neutrino decay scenario within a linear Einstein-Boltzmann solver, and compute the C$\nu$B angular power spectra from the Boltzmann hierarchy solutions for a range of lifetimes and decay channels. We find that neutrino decays leave very strong signatures on the C$\nu$B angular spectra, about two orders of magnitude larger than on the CMB angular spectra, particularly for lifetimes comparable to the age of the Universe. We show that a future polarized tritium target run of the PTOLEMY experiment, with sufficient counting statistics to measure just the first $\sim 15$ multipoles of the neutrino sky map, could test neutrino decay models that remain undetectable with CMB data.

 Baryonic feedback remains one of the largest uncertainties in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, with different prescriptions producing divergent predictions for the fraction of gas expelled from halos, the radial extent of the gas expulsion and the impact on large scale matter clustering. We present the first systematic study of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect across a wide range of simulations (FLAMINGO, ANTILLES, BAHAMAS, SIMBA, FABLE and their variants), and compare them directly to DESI Year 1 + ACT kSZ measurements. We ensure a like-for-like comparison with observations by developing a robust methodology that accounts for the halo mass selection using galaxy-galaxy lensing, cosmic variance, miscentering and satellites, establishing the kSZ effect as a new benchmark for the simulations. We find that fiducial feedback models are disfavoured by >3 sigma, while simulations with more powerful AGN feedback within the FLAMINGO and BAHAMAS suites, as well as SIMBA, reproduce the observed kSZ signal within <2 sigma. We use the ANTILLES simulation suite to demonstrate that the amplitude of the kSZ effect is a strong predictor of matter power spectrum suppression, competitive with baryon fraction metrics. These results establish the kSZ as a critical probe for evaluating feedback physics and for advancing the fidelity of cosmological simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 The lensed Sunburst Arc ($z = 2.369$) hosts a young ($\sim2$--$4\,\rm Myr$), massive ($M_\star \sim 10^7\,M_\odot$), compact ($R_{\rm eff} \sim 8\,\rm pc$) Lyman-continuum (LyC) leaking super star cluster, which powers a compact ($< 10\,\rm pc$), high-pressure nebula at sub-solar metallicity $\sim0.2\,Z_\odot$ and with an anomalously elevated nitrogen-to-oxygen ratio $\log({\rm N/O}) \sim -0.2$. We present semi-analytic models and 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations with radiative feedback in an attempt to reproduce this system. The results indicate that the progenitor giant molecular cloud (GMC) may have $M_{\rm cloud} \gtrsim 3 \times 10^7\,M_\odot$ and $R_{\rm cloud} \sim 70\,\rm pc$, corresponding to a surface density $\sim10^3$--$10^4\,M_\odot\,{\rm pc}^{-2}$. Incorporating feedback from individual Very Massive Stars (VMSs; $\ge 100\,M_\odot$) sampled from the Kroupa initial mass function, we find that their winds rapidly enrich $\sim 10^4\,M_\odot$ of nearby gas with nitrogen ($\sim 1\,$dex) and helium ($\sim 0.1$--$0.2\,$dex). In the first $1$--$3\,$Myr, some cold gas falls to the system center where a central cluster builds up from sub-cluster mergers. There, the gas is photoionized, pressurized, and chemically enriched by the newly formed VMSs, before being radiatively expelled in the next $\sim1\,\rm Myr$. We find that both VMS feedback and a high-surface-density progenitor GMC are necessary to reproduce the observed nebular properties, such as high N/O, high pressure, and stellar proximity. Low metallicity ($Z \le 0.004$) may be essential to avoid overproduction of carbon from WC stars. Such enrichment processes localized to compact starburst events may have caused strong nitrogen emission from dense ionized gas as observed in high-redshift galaxies such as GN-z11 and GS_3073.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent BAO observations from DESI DR2 either hint at a possible dynamical dark energy component, which would worsen the Hubble tension, or at a 95\% credible interval for the summed neutrino mass hardly compatible with neutrino oscillation experiments. In this context, it is interesting to investigate constraints on neutrino masses, dark energy and the Hubble parameter that are agnostic to some aspects of the cosmological model. Here we choose to be agnostic to the value of the sound horizon at recombination, while sticking to standard assumptions regarding the time of recombination and the growth of structures. To be consistent, we also disregard information on the full shape of the CMB temperature and polarization spectrum on sub-degree scale. With such agnostic and conservative assumptions, we find that: (i) the dark energy evolution is well constrained by uncalibrated data on angular and luminosity distances, with a mild preference for dynamical dark energy, independently of the value of the sound horizon; (ii) large values of the Hubble rate are favored, $H_0=76.0^{+4.5}_{-4.3}$ km/s/Mpc (68\%CL), together with low values of the sound horizon, $r_{\rm s}=129.2^{+6.7}_{-8.1}$ Mpc (68\%CL); the SH0ES value of $H_0$ is thus marginally preferred over the low value returned by the standard inverse distance ladder analysis; (iii) the cosmological neutrino mass bound relaxes to $\sum m_\nu <1.6$ eV (95\%CL) and becomes well compatible with the normal and inverted neutrino mass schemes.

 - **Abstract**
 The robust association of electromagnetic candidates discovered during follow-up of gravitational-wave alerts is challenging, not only due to the large sky areas and broad distance uncertainties, but also due to the tens to hundreds of unrelated optical transients that are observed per event. We present a Bayesian ranking method to identify electromagnetic counterparts to GW events using only location information. The framework combines three-dimensional gravitational wave skymaps with host-galaxy information, a morphology-aware host association, empirical offset priors, and peculiar velocity corrections. We apply the method to GW170817 where it ranks AT2017gfo as the top candidate and correctly selects NGC\,4993 as the host. The approach is directly applicable to transient candidates with only location information and enables more efficient follow-up with prioritized candidates and leads to more reliable counterpart identification in current and future observing runs.
