 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic fields play a crucial role in planetary evolution and habitability. While the intrinsic magnetic fields of solar system planets are relatively well understood, the magnetic properties of exoplanets remain largely unconstrained, despite their potential ubiquity. Detecting exoplanetary magnetic fields is essential to advancing our understanding of planetary habitability beyond the solar system. This paper focuses on two promising spectropolarimetric techniques for detecting magnetic fields in hot exoplanets: direct detection through polarization signatures in the He I 1083 nm triplet and indirect detection via star-planet magnetic interactions manifesting as stellar hot spots. The direct method is particularly suited to close-in gas giants, leveraging the Hanle and Zeeman effects to detect low-amplitude magnetic fields. The indirect method can apply to both giant and low-mass planets by identifying magnetic connectivity-induced features in the stellar atmosphere. Although the interpretation of current detections remain tentative, upcoming high-resolution spectropolarimetric capabilities in the UV and near-infrared, particularly with future missions like HWO, promise to enable definitive measurements of exoplanetary magnetic fields. These advancements will open new avenues for probing the magnetic environments of exoplanets and their implications for atmospheric retention and habitability.

 - **Abstract**
 JWST MIRI 15 micron time-series eclipse photometry presents a powerful way to probe for the presence of atmospheres on low-temperature rocky exoplanets orbiting nearby stars. Here, we introduce a novel technique, frame-normalized principal component analysis (FN-PCA) to analyze and detrend these MIRI time-series observations. Using the FN-PCA technique, we perform a uniform reanalysis of the published MIRI 15 micron observations of LHS 1478 b, TOI-1468 b, LHS 1140 c, TRAPPIST-1 b, and TRAPPIST-1 c using our new data reduction pipeline (Erebus) and compare them to different potential atmospheric and surface compositions. We also investigate additional public data sets with the sole purpose of understanding the instrument systematics affecting MIRI. We identify and categorize important detector-level systematics in the observations that are generally present across all 17 analyzed eclipse observations, which we illustrate as eigenimage/eigenvalue pairs in the FN-PCA. One of these eigenimage/eigenvalue pairs corresponds to the prominent ramp effect at the beginning of the time-series observations which has widely been reported for JWST and Spitzer photometry. For JWST/MIRI, we show that the detector settling time scales exponentially with the apparent magnitude of the target star $T_\mathrm{set} \mathrm{[hours]} = 0.063\exp^{0.427\cdot m_K} -0.657$. This uniform reanalysis and investigation of JWST/MIRI systematics is done in preparation for the 500 hour Rocky Worlds DDT survey, to demonstrate a data-driven systematic model usable across all MIRI 15 micron datasets.

 - **Abstract**
 Third-generation gravitational wave (GW) observatories such as the Einstein Telescope (ET) and Cosmic Explorer (CE) will detect hundreds of thousands of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers, reaching redshifts beyond $z\sim3$. To fully exploit joint GW and electromagnetic (EM) detections, dedicated strategies and adapted EM facilities are essential. We investigate the role of Integral Field and Multi-Object Spectroscopy (IFS and MOS) with the Wide-field Spectroscopic Telescope (WST) on next generation GW multi-messenger (MM) observations. We consider simulations of BNS populations, their GW detections with ET(+CE), and their EM counterparts: kilonovae (KNe) and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We consider two strategies: one in synergy with wide-field photometric surveys, and a galaxy-targeted one exploiting WST high multiplexing. We estimate the number of galaxies in GW error volumes, and identify observational challenges and mitigation strategies. We find that WST can detect KNe up to $z\sim0.4$ and $m_{\mathrm{AB}}\sim25$, and GRB afterglows beyond $z>1$ for $\Theta_{\mathrm{view}}\lesssim15^\circ$. KN observations are best scheduled 12-24 hours post-merger. For poorly localised GRBs, WST IFS can aid the identification. Mini-IFUs and galaxy catalogues complete to $z\leq0.5$ are key to EM counterpart detection. Even at low $z$, the number of galaxies can be huge-thousands at $z<0.1$, tens of thousands at $z<0.2$. Events at $z<0.3$ with localisation $<10$deg$^{2}$ are golden cases for WST, requiring few exposures to target all galaxies. Detecting and characterising EM counterparts of BNS detected in the extended volume explored by next-generation interferometers will be challenging. We show that high-sensitivity, wide-field, high-multiplex spectroscopic facilities are powerful instruments to fully exploit the new multi-messenger science opportunities enabled by next generation GW detectors.

 - **Abstract**
 The vast amount of energy released by active galactic nuclei (AGN) is increasingly recognized as a key driver of evolution not only in massive galaxies and clusters, but also in low-mass dwarf galaxies. Despite this, their role in the early stages of galaxy formation and in self-regulating the rapid growth of the first and abundant supermassive black holes (SMBHs) remains poorly understood. Through new high-resolution zoom-in cosmological simulations, we follow the co-evolution of $10^5 M_\odot$ black hole seeds with their host galaxy. The simulated suite progressively spans physics ranging from no AGN feedback and Eddington-limited thermal feedback, to more complex setups including non-Eddington-limited thermal, kinetic and radiative feedback. Across all our models, we find that black hole seeds efficiently reach masses of $\sim10^7 M_\odot$ by z=8. Although they exhibit notably different mass growth histories, these latter seem unimpeded by the presence of AGN feedback. The simulation including radiative feedback is the most distinct, with super-Eddington episodes driving fast and mass-loaded gas outflows (exceeding 2500 km $s^{-1}$) up to $\sim$50 kpc, along with minor stellar mass suppression in the host galaxy. Our measurements are in broad agreement with moderate luminosity quasars recently observed by JWST, producing overmassive black holes, dynamical masses of $\sim10^{9.5} M_\odot$, and high, though short-lived, Eddington fraction accretion rates. These results advocate for a scenario where AGN feedback allows for rapid SMBH growth during the reionisation era, while driving winds that extend deep into the intergalactic medium - shaping host galaxies as well as more distant surroundings.

 - **Abstract**
 Most of the visible mass in a typical spiral galaxy is distributed in a thin disk, with a radial extent much larger than its thickness. While the planar disk structure, including non-axisymmetric features such as spiral structure, has been studied extensively, the vertical structure has not received comparable attention. This review aims to give a comprehensive, pedagogic introduction to the rich topic of vertical structure of a galactic disk in hydrostatic equilibrium and discuss the theoretical developments in this field in the context of recent observations. A realistic multi-component disk plus halo model of a galaxy has been developed and studied by us in detail. This takes account of both stars and interstellar gas, treated as isothermal components with different velocity dispersions, which are gravitationally coupled; further, the disk is in the gravitational field of the dark matter halo. This review focuses on this model and the results from it in different physical cases. The gas and halo crucially affect the resulting self-consistent stellar distribution such that it is vertically constrained to be closer to the mid-plane and has a steeper profile than in the standard one-component case, in agreement with modern observations. A typical stellar disk is shown to flare by a factor of few within the visible radial extent of the disk. These robust results question the sech^2 profile and a constant scale height, routinely used in the literature, for convenience. In an important application, the observed HI gas scale height is used as a constraint on the model which helps determine the shape and the density profile of the dark matter halo for galaxies. Finally, we outline some key, open questions which can be addressed in the near future using the above model, and new observational data -- for example, from IFU surveys and JWST -- for a better understanding of this topic.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a robust, apples-to-apples comparison between the photometric properties of the intracluster light (ICL) in the TNG300 magnetohydrodynamic cosmological simulation and those in Wendelstein Wide Field Imager (WWFI) observations. This is accomplished by generating synthetic $g'$-band images of 40 massive ($\log\left(M_{\rm 200, crit}/{\rm M}_{\odot}\right) > 14.5$) TNG300 clusters at $z \approx 0.06$, closely mimicking WWFI observations, and then performing identical photometric calculations on the synthetic and real images. Importantly, we apply the same observationally motivated satellite-masking procedure to both data-sets, which effectively removes any possible biases introduced by the halo finder. We first analyze the light distribution of the `smooth' stellar component of each cluster, composed of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) plus the ICL, and find that it tends to be about twice as extended in TNG300 than in observations, while also being approximately 1 $g'$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$ brighter. We then quantify $f_{\rm ICL}$, the ICL fraction relative to the BCG+ICL, by considering several ICL definitions: (i) the light dimmer than a surface brightness cut at 27 $g'$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$, (ii) the excess light over a de Vaucouleurs profile, (iii) the light beyond twice the half-light radius ($2 r_{\rm half}$), and (iv) the light beyond a fixed circular aperture of 30, 50, or 100 kpc. For most definitions, the median $f_{\rm ICL}$ is consistent between simulation and observations. However, the observations exhibit larger scatter in $f_{\rm ICL}$, which we attribute primarily to observational uncertainties in the total BCG+ICL luminosity rather than `true' cluster-to-cluster variation in the real Universe. We also find that most methods yield median $f_{\rm ICL}$ values near 0.3, which is consistent with a BCG/ICL transition radius around $2 r_{\rm half}$.

 Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are highly energetic, extremely short-lived bursts of radio flashes. Despite extensive research, the exact cause of these outbursts remains speculative. The high luminosity, short duration, and high dispersion measure of these events suggest they result from extreme, high-energy extragalactic sources, such as highly magnetized and rapidly spinning neutron stars known as magnetars. The number of detected FRBs, including repeating ones, has grown rapidly in recent years. Except for FRB 20200428D, and FRB-like radio burst that is associated to Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154, no multi-wavelength counterpart to any FRB has been detected yet. The High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) telescope has developed a {program} to follow up FRBs searching for their gamma-ray counterparts, helping to uncover the nature of FRBs and FRB sources. This paper provides an overview of the searches for FRB sources conducted by H.E.S.S., including follow-up observations and simultaneous multi-wavelength campaigns with radio and X-ray observatories. Among the FRB sources observed by H.E.S.S., nine are localized with redshifts ranging between 0.11 and 0.492 from 2015 to 2022. No significant very high energy (VHE) emission was detected during these observations. We report constraints on the VHE luminosity ranging from $10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and $10^{48}$ erg s$^{-1}$, placing limits on the FRB's region persistent VHE emission and potential FRB afterglow emission across timescales from hours to years.

 - **Abstract**
 The existence of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) is predicted by various cosmological and evolutionary scenarios for active galactic nuclei. These objects are considered as contributors into the gravitational wave (GW) background and emitters of discrete GW bursts. Yet, SMBHBs remain a rather elusive class of extragalactic objects. Previously we have identified the quasar J2102+6015 as potential SMBHB system based on its oscillating astrometric pattern. We analysed the available VLBI astrometry data and identified another case of astrometric oscillations in the source J0204+1514. We assume these oscillations as manifestations of orbital motion in a binary systems. We estimated parameters of the suspected SMBHB in this source and applied basic theoretical models for projecting its evolution toward coalescence. We also develop a toy model of SMBHB consistent with the discovered astrometric oscillations and give quantitative predictions of GW emission of such the source using the case of J0204+1514 as an example. As an ad hoc result, we also provide a re-assessed estimate of the redshift of J2102+6015, z=1.42. A toy model of the object containing SMBHB with parameters consistent with the observed astrometric oscillations of the source J0204+1514 enabled us to consider GW emission as the cause of the system's orbital evolution. Astrometric VLBI monitoring has an appreciable potential for future detections of SMBHBs as multi-messenger targets for both electromagnetic (in radio domain) and gravitational wave astronomy. To outline the contours of a future physical model connecting SMBHB with detectable GW manifestations, we apply the toy model to the source J0204+1514. We also provide justification for aiming future space-borne VLBI missions toward direct imaging of SMBHBs as a synergistic contribution into future multi-messenger studies involving prospective GW facilities.

 - **Abstract**
 The Juno spacecraft provides a unique opportunity to explore the mechanisms generating Jupiter's aurorae. Past analyses of Juno data immensely advanced our understanding of its auroral acceleration processes, however, few studies utilized multiple instruments on Juno in a joint systematic analysis. This study uses measurements from the Juno Ultraviolet Spectrograph (UVS), the Jupiter Energetic particle Detector Instrument (JEDI), and the Juno Magnetometer (MAG) from the first 20 perijoves. On magnetic field lines associated with the diffuse aurora, we consistently find small-scale magnetic field fluctuations with amplitudes of up to 100 nT on time scales of seconds to 1 minute. On magnetic field lines directly linked to the main emission, the electron distribution is field-aligned, mostly broad-band in energy, and accompanied by large-scale magnetic field perturbations of several 100 nT on time scales of tens of min (except one case). These large-scale perturbations are generally associated with quasistatic field-aligned electric currents. Small-scale magnetic fields are not resolved over the main emission zone closer than radial distances 4 Jovian radii due to the digitization limit of the magnetometer. However, in all cases where Juno crosses the main auroral field lines beyond 4RJ, the digitization limit is significantly reduced and we detect small-scale magnetic field fluctuations of 2 nT to 10 nT consistent with a turbulent spectrum. Associated energy fluxes projected to Jupiter can exceed 1000 mW/m2. The general broad-band nature of the electron distributions and the consistent presence of small-scale magnetic field fluctuations over the main emission support that wave-particle interaction can dominantely contribute to power Jupiter's auroral processes.

 - **Abstract**
 NGC 4527 is a nearby edge-on spiral galaxy with both starburst and AGN features, hosting a LINER nucleus. We present a radio study of the large-scale structure and nuclear region of this galaxy, based on new uGMRT observations at 700 and 1230 MHz. Our continuum maps reveal extended emission tracing the stellar disk, with no evidence of a radio halo. The spectral index distribution and the presence of PAHs across the disk are consistent with ongoing star formation. In the nuclear region we resolve three compact sources: one at the galactic centre and two symmetrically aligned with the major axis at $\sim400$ pc. The spectral index values and the destruction of PAHs in the central source, together with previously detected X-rays emission, suggest the presence of a low-luminosity AGN. The two off-centre sources are consistent with a star formation ring, coincident with a molecular gas ring previously reported. We explore a scenario where super-Eddington accretion onto the black hole drives a dense wind that falls back onto the disk, triggering star formation in a circumnuclear ring.

 - **Abstract**
 The Oblate Schwarzschild (OS) approximation is a method often used to compute the flux of X-rays emitted from a rapidly rotating neutron star. In this approximation, the oblate shape of the rotating star is embedded in the Schwarzschild metric, which is used to compute the redshift of photon energies as they propagate from the star to the telescope. In this paper, we demonstrate that there are small errors introduced by the standard treatment of photon redshift in the OS approximation and provide a simple method to correct these errors. These errors are constant in phase, so this results in a constant absolute reduction in the flux. For PSR J0740+6620, the most rapidly spinning of the pulsars observed by NICER, we estimate the flux errors are less than 1\%, which is an order of magnitude smaller than the uncertainty in the distance, so this does not affect the mass and radius constraints found for this pulsar. The errors for the other pulsars observed by NICER are even smaller. However, this correction should be included when analyzing data for more rapidly rotating X-ray pulsars with spin frequencies near 600 Hz.

 - **Abstract**
 The Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory has detected very high-energy (VHE) gamma rays from NGC 4278, which is known to host a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (AGN). Having only very weak radio jets, the origin of its VHE gamma rays is unclear. In this paper we first show that NGC 4278 has a massive molecular cloud surrounding the nucleus by analyzing data taken with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. We then assume that cosmic ray protons are accelerated in a radiatively inefficient accretion flow around the supermassive black hole, which diffuse into the molecular cloud and produce gamma rays and neutrinos via $pp$ interactions. We model the gamma-ray spectra and find that the observations can be explained by such hadronic processes if the AGN activity was higher in the past than at present, and the diffusion coefficient in the molecular cloud is appreciably smaller than in the Milky Way interstellar medium. However, we also show that the high-energy neutrinos co-produced with the gamma rays are unlikely to be detectable even with IceCube-Gen2.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we report multi-year polarization measurements of four repeating FRBs initially discovered by CHIME: FRBs~20190117A, 20190208A, 20190303A, and 20190417A. We observed the four repeating FRBs with FAST, detecting a total of 66 bursts. Two bursts from FRB~20190417A exhibit a circular polarization signal-to-noise ratio greater than 7, with the highest circular polarization fraction recorded at 35.7%. While the bursts from FRBs 20190208A and 20190303A are highly linearly polarized, those from FRBs~20190117A and 20190417A show depolarization due to multi-path propagation, with \sigma_{\mathrm{RM}} = 2.78 \pm 0.05 rad m$^{-2}$ and 5.19 \pm 0.09 rad m$^{-2}$, respectively. The linear polarization distributions among five repeating FRB--FRBs~20190208A, 20190303A, 20201124A, 20220912A, and 20240114A--are nearly identical but show distinct differences from those of non-repeating FRBs. FRBs~20190117A, 20190303A, and 20190417A exhibit substantial rotation measure (RM) variations between bursts, joining other repeating FRBs in this behavior. Combining these findings with published results, 64% of repeating FRBs show RM variations greater than 50 rad m$^{-2}$, and 21\% exhibit RM reversals. A significant proportion of repeating FRBs reside in a dynamic magneto-ionic environment. The structure function of RM variations shows a power-law index of $\gamma \sim (0-0.8)$, corresponding to a shallow power spectrum $\alpha = -(\gamma + 2) \sim -(2.0-2.8)$ of turbulence, if the RM variations are attributed to turbulence. This suggests that the variations are dominated by small-scale RM density fluctuations. We perform K-S tests comparing the RMs of repeating and non-repeating FRBs, which reveal a marginal dichotomy in the distribution of their this http URL caution that the observed dichotomy may be due to the small sample size and selection biases.

 The role of magnetic fields in regulating the formation of massive stars remains much debated. Here we present sub-millimeter polarimetric observations with JCMT-POL2 at $850\:\mu$m of 13 regions of massive star formation selected from the SOFIA Massive (SOMA) star formation survey, yielding a total of 29 massive protostars. Our investigation of the $p'-I$ relationship suggests that grain alignment persists up to the highest intensities. We examine the relative orientations between polarization-inferred magnetic field direction and source column density elongation direction on small and large scales. On small scales, we find a bimodal distribution of these relative orientations, i.e., with an excess of near-parallel and near-perpendicular orientations. By applying a one-sample Kuiper test and Monte Carlo simulations to compare to a relative orientation distribution drawn from a uniform distribution, we statistically confirm this bimodal distribution, independent of the methods to measure structural orientation. This bimodal distribution suggests that magnetic fields are dynamically important on the local scales ($\lesssim 0.6\:$pc) of massive protostellar cores. We also examine how basic polarization properties of overall degree of polarization and local dispersion in polarization vector orientations depend on intrinsic protostellar properties inferred from spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling. We find a statistically significant anti-correlation between the debiased polarized fraction and the luminosity to mass ratio, $L_{\rm bol}/M_{\rm env}$, which hints at a change in the dust properties for protostellar objects at different evolutionary stages.

 - **Abstract**
 Relativistic pair beams created in the intergalactic medium (IGM) by TeV gamma rays from blazars are expected to produce a detectable GeV-scale electromagnetic cascade, but the cascade component is absent in the spectra of many hard-spectrum TeV-emitting blazars. One common explanation is that weak intergalactic magnetic fields deflect the electron-positron pairs away from our line of sight. An alternative possibility is that electrostatic beam-plasma instabilities drain the energy of these pairs before a cascade can develop. Recent studies have shown that beam scattering by oblique electrostatic modes leads to minimal energy loss. But these modes might be suppressed by linear Landau damping (LLD) due to MeV-scale cosmic-ray electrons in the IGM. In this work, we explore the impact of LLD on the energy-loss efficiency of plasma instabilities in pair beams associated with 1ES 0229+200. We find that LLD effectively suppresses oblique electrostatic modes, while quasi-parallel ones grow to larger amplitudes. In this way, LLD enhances the energy-loss efficiency of the instability by more than an order of magnitude.

 - **Abstract**
 The super-soft source (SSS) phase of a nova eruption, observed a few days after the outburst, usually displays an absorbed X-ray thermal continuum with absorption features, emitted by the white dwarf (WD) atmosphere. However, the X-ray spectra of many novae in this phase display additional emission lines which likely originate from shocks in the novae ejecta. When the shocked plasma interacts with cold gas, narrow radiative recombination continua (RRCs) and charge exchange (CX) emission are observed. We present the analysis of high-resolution ChandraLETG X-ray grating spectra of Nova Sco 2023, observed 128 and 183 days after the optical peak, on 2023 August and October. At both epochs, the absorbed X-ray thermal continuum is well described by a Non-Local Thermal Equilibrium atmosphere model with a temperature T=750,000 K (kT = 65 eV). On day 128, the atmosphere is found to be outflowing at v=-3500 km s^-1. On day 183, the atmosphere brightened by a factor of ~2 and slowed down to v=-1500$ km s^-1. The discrete emission features of the spectrum consist of the C^+5, N^+5, and N^+6 RRCs, indicating a cold electron temperature of kT_e=1 eV on day 128, and kT_e=20 eV on day 183. The observed line series of H-like and He-like C^+5, N^+5, N^+6, and O^+6 show enhanced intensities of high-n (principal quantum number) transitions, consistent with a CX model of hot ions at kT~100 eV. The velocity shift of the CX lines remained at v=+-3000 km s^-1, which can be explained by a bipolar outflow. After Nova Ret 2020 (YZ Ret), Nova Sco 2023 is yet another nova in which we have found exquisite evidence of CX in astrophysical ionized plasma.

 - **Abstract**
 The accretion disks of active galactic nuclei (AGN) are widely considered the ideal environments for binary black hole (BBH) mergers and the only plausible sites for their electromagnetic (EM) counterparts. Graham et al.(2023) identified seven AGN flares that are potentially associated with gravitational-wave (GW) events detected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) Collaboration during the third observing run. In this article, utilizing an additional three years of Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) public data after their discovery, we conduct an updated analysis and find that only three flares can be identified. By implementing a joint analysis of optical and GW data through a Bayesian framework, we find two flares exhibit a strong correlation with GW events, with no secondary flares observed in their host AGN up to 2024 October 31. Combining these two most robust associations, we derive a Hubble constant measurement of $H_{0}= 72.1^{+23.9}_{-23.1} \ \mathrm{km \ s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}}$ and incorporating the multi-messenger event GW170817 improves the precision to $H_{0}=73.5^{+9.8}_{-6.9} \ \mathrm{km \ s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}}$. Both results are consistent with existing measurements reported in the literature.

 - **Abstract**
 X-ray reflection spectroscopy has evolved as one of the leading methods to measure black hole spins. However, the question is whether its measurements are subjected to systematic biases, especially considering the possible discrepancy between the spin measurements inferred with this technique and those from gravitational wave observations. In this work, we use general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of thin accretion disks around spinning black holes for modeling the accretion process, and then we simulate NuSTAR observations to test the capability of modern reflection models in recovering the input spins. For the first time, we model the electron density and ionization profiles from GRMHD-simulated disks. Our study reveals that current reflection models work well only for fast-rotating black holes. We model the corona as the base of the jet and we find that reflection models with lamppost emissivity profiles fail to recover the correct black hole spins. Reflection models with broken power-law emissivity profiles perform better. As we increase the complexity of the simulated models, it is more difficult to recover the correct input spins, pointing towards the need to update our current reflection models with more advanced accretion disks and coronal geometries.
#### Frequency separation ratios do not suppress magnetic activity effects in solar-like stars

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic activity effects are typically neglected in asteroseismic modelling of solar-type stars, presuming that these effects can be accounted for in the parametrisation of the surface effects. It was however demonstrated that magnetic activity can have a significant impact on the asteroseismic characterisation using both forward and inverse techniques. We investigated whether frequency separation ratios, which are commonly used to efficiently suppress surface effects, are also able to suppress magnetic activity effects. Based on GOLF and BiSON observations of the Sun-as-a-star, we performed asteroseismic characterisations using frequency separation ratios as constraints to measure the apparent temporal evolution of the stellar parameters and their correlation with the 10.7 cm radio flux. Frequency separation ratios do not suppress the effects of magnetic activity. Both $r_{01}$ and $r_{02}$ ratios exhibit a clear signature of the magnetic activity cycle. Consequently, when these ratios are employed as constraints in asteroseismic modelling, magnetic activity effects are propagated to the stellar characterisation. Additionally, most stellar parameters correlate with the activity cycle, unlike the direct fitting of individual frequencies. Magnetic activity effects significantly impact asteroseismic characterisation, regardless of whether forward modelling or inverse methods are used. Standard techniques to suppress surface effects have proven ineffective against magnetic activity influences and systematic uncertainties of 4.7%, 2.9%, and 1.0% should be considered for the stellar age, mass, and radius, respectively. In preparation for future space-based photometry missions, it is therefore essential to enhance our theoretical understanding of these effects and develop a modelling procedure capable of accounting for or efficiently suppressing them.

 - **Abstract**
 Spherically symmetric accretion incorporating self-gravity constitutes a three-point boundary value problem (TPBVP) governed by constraints at the outer boundary, sonic point, and accretor surface. Previous studies have two limitations: either employing an incorrect formula for self-gravity potential in analytical treatments, or introducing additional input parameters in numerical implementations to circumvent solving the full TPBVP. To address these issues, we present a self-consistent TPBVP formulation, solved using the relaxation method. We also derive approximate analytical formulae that enable rapid estimates of self-gravity effects. Our analysis identifies a dimensionless parameter $\beta \equiv 2G \bar{\rho} r_\mathrm{out}^2/a_\mathrm{out}^2$ that characterizes the strength of self-gravity, where $\bar{\rho}$ and $r_\mathrm{out}$ are the mean density and outer radius of the flow, respectively, and $a_\mathrm{out}$ is the adiabatic sound speed of the external medium. For practical estimation, $\bar{\rho}$ may be approximated by the external medium density $\rho_\mathrm{out}$. We identify an upper limit for $\beta$, beyond which steady accretion becomes unsustainable -- a behavior consistent with classical gravitational instability that previous studies failed to capture. The accretion rate enhancement decreases monotonically as the adiabatic index $\gamma$ increases. For $\gamma=5/3$, self-gravity ceases to augment the accretion rate. These theoretical predictions are validated by our numerical solutions. We further apply our results to two astrophysical scenarios: hyper-Eddington accretion onto supermassive black hole seeds in the early Universe, where self-gravity is significant; and accretion onto stellar-mass objects embedded in active galactic nuclei (AGN) disks, where self-gravity is non-negligible under certain conditions and should be evaluated using $\beta$.

 - **Abstract**
 Although the differential rotation rate on the solar surface has long been studied using optical and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) observations, associating these measurements to specific atmospheric heights remains challenging due to the temperature-dependent emission of tracers observed in EUV wavelengths. Radio observations, being primarily influenced by coherent plasma processes and/or thermal bremsstrahlung, offer a more height-stable diagnostic and thus provide an independent means to test and validate rotational trends observed at other EUV wavelengths. We aim to characterize the differential rotation profile of the upper chromosphere using cleaned solar full-disc 17 GHz radio imaging from the Nobeyama Radioheliograph (NoRH), spanning a little over two solar cycles (1992 - 2020). A tracer-independent method based on automated image correlation was employed on daily full-disc 17 GHz radio maps. Our results suggest that the upper chromosphere rotates significantly faster than the photosphere at all latitudes, with a relatively flatter latitudinal profile. A very weak anti-correlation between the equatorial rotation rate and solar activity is also observed. Our findings reaffirm the potential of radio observations to probe the dynamics of the solar chromosphere with reduced height ambiguity. The overlap of the equatorial rotation rate found in this study with that for $304$ Å in the EUV regime lends additional support to the view that the equatorial rotation rates increase with height above the photosphere. Future coordinated studies at wavelengths with better-constrained height formation will be crucial for further understanding the complex dynamics of the solar atmosphere.

 - **Abstract**
 Probing the nature of dark matter (DM) remains an outstanding problem in modern cosmology. The 21 cm signal, as a sensitive tracer of neutral hydrogen during cosmic dawn, provides a unique means to investigate DM nature during this critical epoch. Annihilation and decay of DM particles, as well as Hawking radiation of primordial black holes (PBHs), can modify the thermal and ionization histories of the early universe, leaving distinctive imprints on the 21 cm power spectrum. Therefore, the redshifted 21 cm power spectrum serves as a powerful tool to investigate such DM processes. In this work, we systematically assess the potential of the upcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA) to constrain DM and PBH parameters using the 21 cm power spectrum. Assuming $10,000$ hours of integration time, the SKA is projected to reach sensitivities of $\langle\sigma v\rangle \leq 10^{-28}\,{\rm cm}^{3}\,{\rm s}^{-1}$ and $\tau\geq 10^{28}\,{\rm seconds}$, for $10\,{\rm GeV}$ DM particles. It can also probe PBHs with masses of $10^{16}\,\mathrm{g}$ and abundances $f_{\mathrm{PBH}} \leq 10^{-6}$. These results indicate that the SKA could place constraints on DM annihilation, decay, and PBH Hawking radiation that are up to two to three orders of magnitude stronger than current limits. Furthermore, the SKA is expected to exceed existing bounds on sub-GeV DM and to probe Hawking radiation from PBHs with masses above $10^{17}\,{\rm g}$, which are otherwise inaccessible by conventional cosmological probes. Overall, the SKA holds great promise for advancing our understanding of both DM particles and PBHs, potentially offering new insights into the fundamental nature of DM.

 - **Abstract**
 Blazars are a subclass of active galactic nuclei (AGN) that emit non-thermal radiation through relativistic jets, characterized by rapid flux and polarization variability. Extreme high synchrotron-peaked blazars (EHSPs), with synchrotron peaks exceeding 10$^{17}$ Hz, are essential for understanding the full range of blazar phenomena and testing jet physics models. However, the number of known extreme blazars is small, so this class of objects remains poorly studied. This work aims to systematically identify and characterize the most extreme $\gamma$-ray blazars using data from the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. The focus is on spectral hardening, where the $\gamma$-ray spectrum becomes harder at higher energies, particularly during flaring episodes. This represents the first dedicated analysis of spectral hardening across a population of EHSPs, as previous studies explored it only in individual sources. We analyze 138 blazars selected from the 4FGL-DR2 catalog with high synchrotron peak frequencies and well-sampled light curves. Flaring periods are automatically identified, and each flare is analyzed, with the significance of spectral hardening assessed through a test statistic based on the likelihood ratio of two spectral models. We identify two flaring episodes with indications of spectral hardening, in 4FGL J0238.4$-$3116 and PKS 2155$-$304, the latter detected independently by both methods but referring to the same period. These events are consistent with expectations from statistical fluctuations, suggesting that spectral hardening is a rare occurrence (< 0.1 %). These results constrain its frequency and support a smoothly varying power-law blazar emission model, motivating future multi-wavelength studies to clarify whether these rare flares reflect distinct physical processes within blazar jets.

 - **Abstract**
 We report initial observations aimed at the characterization of a third interstellar object candidate. This object, 3I/ATLAS -- also C/2025 N1 (ATLAS) -- , was discovered on 2025 July 1 UT and has an orbital eccentricity of $e\sim6.2$, perihelion of $q\sim 1.35$ au, inclination of $\sim175^\circ$, and hyperbolic velocity of $V_\infty\sim 60$ km s$^{-1}$. 3I/ATLAS has an absolute magnitude of $H_V\sim12$, which corresponds to a nuclear radius of $\sim10\text{ km}$, assuming an asteroid-like albedo of $p\sim0.05$. The discovery of this object implies a spatial number density of $n_0\sim10^{-3}$ au$^{-3}$ for objects with radii greater than or equal to that of 3I/ATLAS. We report deep stacked images obtained using the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope that display faint activity. Using images obtained from the Las Cumbres Observatory 0.36 m telescopes at Haleakala and the 2.0 m Faulkes Telescope North, we find a small light curve variation of less than 0.2 mag for the object over a $\sim29$ h time span. The visible/near-infrared spectral slope of the object is red, comparable to 1I/`Oumuamua. The object will be observable until September 2025, unobservable near perihelion due to low solar elongation, and observable again in November. This limitation unfortunately prohibits detailed observations at perihelion when the activity of 3I/ATLAS is likely to peak. Based on the experience of 1I/`Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, we ask the community to maintain a constant observational presence while possible with photometric, spectroscopic, and polarimetric methods. Such observational data would constrain the (i) light curve, (ii) onset and variation of activity, and (iii) nongravitational effects. It is essential that the community collaborate to rapidly and comprehensively characterize these properties of 3I/ATLAS.

 - **Abstract**
 Astrophysical flares are one of the possible prominent source classes of ultra-high-energy (UHE, $E > 10^{17}$ eV) cosmic rays, which can be detected by recording clusters of extensive air showers in arrays of detectors. The search for sources of neutral particles offers distinct advantages over searching for sources of charged particles, as the former traverse cosmic distances undeflected by magnetic fields. While no cosmic-ray photons exceeding $10^{17}$ eV have been definitively detected, identifying the clustering of events in cosmic-ray data would provide compelling evidence for their existence. We compare two analysis methods for detecting direction-time clustering in UHE extensive air showers: an approach that examines multiplets, and the stacking method, which analyzes sets of doublets that are not necessarily consecutive, thus making it sensitive to multiple flares. Both techniques combine time-clustering algorithms with unbinned likelihood study. Background events (initiated by hadrons) can be more efficiently distinguished from photon-induced events (signals) by using a photon tag that employs probability distribution functions to classify each event as more likely to be initiated by either a photon or a hadron. We demonstrate that these methods can effectively distinguish between events initiated by photons and those initiated by hadrons (background), and can accurately reproduce both the number of photon events within flares and their duration. We calculate the discovery potentials, i.e., the number of events required to identify a photon flare. The methods discussed can be used to search for cosmic ray sources and/or improve limits on the fluxes of UHE photons.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new framework to incorporate feedback from massive interacting binaries in simulations of star cluster formation. Our new feedback model adds binary stellar evolution to the cluster formation code Torch, and couples it in AMUSE to the pre-existing modules for collisional stellar dynamics, magnetohydrodynamics, and mechanical and radiative feedback. Our model accounts for the effects of mass transfer on the stars' mass loss rates, their radiation spectra, and the timing of core-collapse supernovae. It also injects mass lost through non-conservative mass transfer and common envelope ejection into the interstellar medium. We demonstrate the use of our feedback model through simulations of isolated binaries in a gaseous medium, and of embedded clusters of massive binaries. Feedback from interacting binaries efficiently couples with the surrounding interstellar medium. It increases the size of HII regions, increases the kinetic and thermal energy of the gas, and increases the pressure within HII regions compared to models that use single star stellar evolution. Those differences arise from the ionizing radiation, which increases by three orders of magnitude, resulting in HII regions that expand due to thermal pressure rather than radiation pressure. The effects of stellar dynamics and the gravitational potential of the background gas cause the evolution of individual binaries to deviate from the predictions made by secular evolution, impacting the subsequent feedback from the binary. We conclude that massive interacting binaries are an important source of feedback in cluster-forming regions, and must be considered when studying the emerging timescales of young star clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 Early multi-wavelength observations offer crucial insights into the nature of the relativistic jets responsible for gamma-ray bursts and their interaction with the surrounding this http URL present data of GRB 240825A from 17 space- and ground-based telescopes/instruments, covering wavelengths from NIR/optical to X-ray and GeV, and spanning from the prompt emission to the afterglow phase triggered by Swift and Fermi. The early afterglow observations were carried out by SVOM/C-GFT, and spectroscopic observations of the afterglow by GTC, VLT, and TNG determined the redshift of the burst ($z = 0.659$) later.A comprehensive analysis of the prompt emission spectrum observed by Swift-BAT and Fermi-GBM/LAT reveals a rare and significant high-energy cutoff at ~76 MeV. Assuming this cutoff is due to $\gamma\gamma$ absorption allows us to place an upper limit on the initial Lorentz factor, $\Gamma_0 < 245$. The optical/NIR and GeV afterglow light curves be described by the standard external shock model, with early-time emission dominated by a reverse shock (RS) and a subsequent transition to forward shock (FS) emission. Our afterglow modelling yields a consistent estimate of the initial Lorentz factor ($\Gamma_{\rm 0} \sim 234$). Furthermore, the RS-to-FS magnetic field ratio ($\mathcal{R}_B \sim 302$) indicates that the reverse shock region is significantly more magnetized than the FS region. An isotropic-equivalent kinetic energy of $E_{\text{k,iso}} = 5.25 \times 10^{54}$ erg is derived, and the corresponding $\gamma$-ray radiation efficiency is estimated to be $\eta_{\gamma}$ = 3.1%. On the other hand, the standard afterglow model can not reproduce the X-ray light curve of GRB 240825A, calling for improved models to characterize all multi-wavelength data.
