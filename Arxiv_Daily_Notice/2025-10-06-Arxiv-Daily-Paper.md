 - **Abstract**
 It is often understood that supernova (SN) feedback in galaxies is responsible for regulating star formation and generating gaseous outflows. However, a detailed look at their effect on the local interstellar medium (ISM) on small mass scales in simulations shows that these processes proceed in clearly distinct channels. We demonstrate this finding in two independent simulations with solar-mass resolution, LYRA and RIGEL, of an isolated dwarf galaxy. Focusing on the immediate environment surrounding SNe, our findings suggest that the large-scale effect of a given SN on the galaxy is best predicted by its immediate local density. Outflows are driven by SNe in diffuse regions expanding to their cooling radii on large (\sim kpc) scales, while dense star-forming regions are disrupted in a localized (\sim pc) manner. However, these separate feedback channels are only distinguishable at very high numerical resolutions capable of following scales <<10^3 \msun. On larger scales, ISM densities are greatly mis-estimated, and differences between local environments of SNe become severely washed out. We demonstrate the practical implications of this effect by comparing with a mid-resolution simulation (Mptcl. \sim 200 \msun) of the same dwarf using the SMUGGLE model. The coarse-resolution simulation cannot self-consistently determine whether a given SN is responsible for generating outflows or suppressing star formation, suggesting that emergent galaxy physics such as star formation regulation through hot-phase outflows is fundamentally unresolvable by subgrid stellar feedback models, without appealing directly to simulations with highly resolved ISM.
#### DIPSY: A new Disc Instability Population SYnthesis, II. The Populations of Companions Formed Through Disc Instability

 - **Abstract**
 We applied the global end-to-end model described in Paper~I of this series to perform a population synthesis of companions formed via disc instability (DI). By using initial conditions compatible with both observations and hydrodynamical simulations, and by studying a large range of primary masses (0.05-5 Msol), we can provide quantitative predictions of the outcome of DI. In the baseline population, we find that ~10 % of the discs fragment, and about half of these end up with a surviving companion after 100 Myr. 75\% of the companions are in the brown dwarf regime, 15 % are low-mass stars, and 10 % planets. At distances larger than ~100 au, DI produces planetary-mass companions on a low percent level. Inside of 100 AU, however, planetary-mass companions are very rare (low per mill level). The average companion mass is ~30 Mj scaling weakly with stellar mass. Most of the initial fragments do not survive on a Myr timescale; they either collide with other fragments or are ejected, resulting in a population of free-floating objects (about 1-2 per star). We also quantify several variant populations to critically assess some of our assumptions used in the baseline population. DI appears to be a key mechanism in the formation of distant companions with masses ranging from low-mass stars down to the planetary regime, contributing, however, only marginally to planetary mass objects inside of 100 AU. Our results are sensitive to a number of physical processes, which are not completely understood. Two of them, gas accretion and clump-clump collisions, are particularly important and need to be investigated further. Magnetic fields and heavy-element accretion have not been considered in our study, although they are also expected to affect the inferred population. We suggest acknowledging the importance of the gravito-turbulent phase, which most protoplanetary discs experience.

 - **Abstract**
 The supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the giant elliptical galaxy M87 is one of the most well-studied in the local universe, but the stellar- and gas-dynamical SMBH mass measurements disagree. As this galaxy is a key anchor for the upper end of the SMBH mass$-$host galaxy relations, we revisit the central $3''\times 3''$ ($\sim 240\times240$ pc) region of M87 with the Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) integral field unit (IFU) on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We implement several improvements to the reduction pipeline and obtain high signal-to-noise spectra ($S/N \sim 150$) in single $0.''05 $ spaxels across much of the NIRSpec field of view. We measure the detailed shape of the stellar line-of-sight velocity distribution, parameterized by Gauss-Hermite moments up to $h_8$, in $\sim 2800$ spatial bins, substantially improving upon the prior high angular resolution studies of the M87 stellar kinematics. The NIRSpec data reveal velocities with $V \sim \pm 45$ km s$^{-1}$, velocity dispersions that rise sharply to $\sim$$420$ km s$^{-1}$ at a projected radius of 0.$''$45 (36 pc), and a slight elevation in $h_4$ toward the nucleus. We comprehensively test the robustness of the kinematics, including using multiple velocity template libraries and adopting different polynomials to adjust the template spectra. We find that the NIRSpec stellar kinematics seamlessly transition to recently measured large-scale stellar kinematics from optical Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI) IFU data. These combined NIRSpec and KCWI kinematics provide continuous coverage from parsec to kiloparsec scales and will critically constrain future stellar-dynamical models of M87.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a fast and robust analytic framework for predicting surface brightness (SB) of emission lines in galactic winds as a function of radius up to $\sim 100$ kpc out in the circum-galactic medium. We model multi-phase structure in galactic winds by capturing emission from both the volume-filling hot phase (T $\sim 10^{6-7}$ K) and turbulent radiative mixing layers that host intermediate temperature gas at the boundaries of cold clouds (T $\sim 10^4$ K). Our multi-phase framework makes significantly different predictions of emission signatures compared to traditional single-phase models. We emphasize how ram pressure equilibrium between the cold clouds and hot wind in supersonic outflows, non-equilibrium ionization effects, and energy budgets other than mechanical energy from core-collapse supernovae affect our SB predictions and allow us to better match OVI observations in the literature. Our framework reveals that the optimal galactic wind properties that facilitate OVI emission observations above a detection limit of $\sim 10^{-18} \ \rm{erg \ s^{-1} \ cm^{-2} \ arcsec^{-2}}$ are star formation rate surface density $1 \lesssim \dot{\Sigma}_{\ast} \lesssim 20 \ M_{\odot}\ \rm{yr^{-1}\ kpc^{-2}}$, hot phase mass loading factor $\eta_{\rm M,hot} \sim 0.2 - 0.4$, and thermalization efficiency factor $\eta_{\rm E} \gtrsim 0.8$. These findings are consistent with existing observations and can help inform future target selections.

 - **Abstract**
 The 4MOST Cosmology Redshift Survey (CRS) will obtain nearly 5.4 million spectroscopic redshifts over $\sim5700$\,deg$^2$ to map large-scale structure and enable measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs), growth rates via redshift-space distortions, and cross-correlations with weak-lensing surveys. We validate the target selections, photometry, masking, systematics and redshift distributions of the CRS Bright Galaxy (BG) and Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) target catalogues selected from DESI Legacy Surveys DR10.1 imaging. We measure the angular two-point correlation function, test masking strategies, and recover redshift distributions via cross-correlation with DESI DR1 spectroscopy. For BG, we adopt Legacy Survey \texttt{MASKBITS} that veto bright stars, SGA large galaxies, and globular clusters; for LRG, we pair these with an unWISE W1 artefact mask. These choices suppress small-scale excess power without imprinting large-scale modes. A Limber-scaling test across BG $r$-band magnitude slices shows that, after applying the scaling, the $w(\theta)$ curves collapse to a near-common power law over the fitted angular range, demonstrating photometric uniformity with depth and consistency between the North (NGC) and South (SGC) Galactic Caps. Cross-correlations with DESI spectroscopy recover the expected $N(z)$, with higher shot noise at the brightest magnitudes. For LRGs, angular clustering in photo-$z$ slices ($0.4\le z<1.0$) is mutually consistent between the DECaLS and DES footprints at fixed $z$ and is well described by an approximate power law once photo-$z$ smearing is accounted for; halo-occupation fits yield results consistent with recent LRG studies. Together, these tests indicate that the masks and target selections yield uniform clustering statistics, supporting precision large-scale structure analyses with 4MOST CRS.

 - **Abstract**
 Active galactic nuclei (AGN), star formation (SF), and galaxy interactions can drive turbulence in the gas of the ISM, which in turn plays a role in the SF within galaxies. The impact on molecular gas is of particular importance, as it serves as the primary fuel for SF. Our goal is to investigate the origin of turbulence and the emission of molecular gas, as well as low- and intermediate-ionization gas, in the inner few kpc of both AGN hosts and SF galaxies. We use JWST MIRI/MRS observations of a sample consisting of 54 galaxies at z<0.1. We present fluxes of the H2 S(5)6.9091, [Ar II]6.9853, [FeII]5.3403, and [Ar III]8.9914 lines, along with velocity dispersion from W80. For galaxies with coronal emission, [Mg V]5.6098 is also included. Line ratios are compared to photoionization and shock models to explore the origin of the gas emission. AGNs exhibit broader emission lines than SFGs, with the largest velocity dispersions observed in radio-strong (RS) AGNs. H2 gas is less turbulent compared to ionized gas, while coronal gas presents higher velocity dispersions. The W80 values for the ionized gas exhibits a decrease from the nucleus out to radii of approximately 0.5--1 kpc, followed by an outward increase up to 2-3 kpc. In contrast, the H2 line widths generally display increasing profiles with distance from the center. Correlations W80 and line ratios such as H2 S(5)/[ArII] and [FeII]/[ArII] indicate that the most turbulent gas is associated with shocks, enhancing H2 and [FeII] emissions. We speculate that these shocked gas regions are produced by AGN outflows and jet-cloud interactions in AGN-dominated sources, while in SFGs, they may be created by stellar winds and mergers. This shock-induced gas heating may be an important mechanism of AGN (or stellar) feedback, preventing the gas from cooling and forming new stars.
#### The origin of the galaxy size-stellar metallicity relation: A semi-analytical perspective

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar metallicity encodes the integrated effects of gas inflow, star formation, and feedback-driven outflow, yet its connection to galaxy structure remains poorly understood. Using SDSS-IV MaNGA, we present the direct observational evidence that, at fixed stellar mass, smaller central galaxies are systematically more metal-rich, with a Spearman's rank correlation coefficient reaching $R_{\rm s}\approx -0.4$. The semi-analytical model L-GALAXIES reproduces this anti-correlation, albeit with a stronger amplitude ($R_{\rm s}\approx -0.8$). Within this framework, the trend cannot be explained by differences in gravitational potential depth or star formation history. Instead, smaller galaxies attain higher stellar metallicities because their elevated star formation efficiencies accelerate chemical enrichment, and, at fixed stellar mass, they inhabit less massive haloes, which makes their recycled inflows more metal-rich. The gas-regulator model demonstrates that star formation efficiency affects stellar metallicity when the system has not long remained in equilibrium, which is shown to be the case for central galaxies with $M_{\rm star}\lesssim 10^{10.5}\rm M_\odot$ in both L-GALAXIES and observation. The model also suggests a testable signature that, at fixed stellar mass, larger or lower-metallicity galaxies should inhabit more massive haloes than their smaller and higher-metallicity counterparts, providing a direct and testable imprint of the galaxy size-stellar metallicity relation on the galaxy-halo connection.
#### A Mid-Infrared Spectroscopic Study of Young Stellar Objects in the SMC Region NGC 346: JWST Detects Dust, Accretion, Ices and Outflows

 - **Abstract**
 We present mid-infrared spectroscopic observations of intermediate- to high-mass young stellar objects (YSOs) in the low-metallicity star-forming region NGC 346 located within the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). We conduct these integral-field-unit observations with the Mid-Infrared Instrument Medium Resolution Spectroscopy instrument on board JWST. The brightest and most active star-forming region in the SMC, NGC 346 has a metallicity of $\sim$1/5 $Z_{\odot}$, analogous to the era when star formation in the early Universe ($z$$\simeq$2) peaked. We discuss the emission and absorption features present in the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of five YSOs with coverage from 4.9-27.9$\mu$m and three other sources with partial spectral coverage. Via SED model-fitting, we estimate their parameters, finding masses ranging from 2.9-18.0 M$_{\odot}$. These targets show dusty silicates, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and ices of CO$_2$, CO, H$_2$O and CH$_3$OH in their protostellar envelopes. We measure emission from H$_2$ and atomic fine-structure lines, suggesting the presence of protostellar jets and outflows. We detect H I lines indicating ongoing accretion and estimate accretion rates for each source which range from 2.50x10$^{-6}$-2.23x10$^{-4}$ M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ based on H I (7-6) line emission. We present evidence for a $\sim$30,000AU protostellar jet traced by fine-structure, H I and H$_2$ emission about the YSO Y535, the first detection of a resolved protostellar outflow in the SMC, and the most distant yet detected.

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce microJAX, the first fully differentiable implementation of the image-centered ray-shooting (ICRS) algorithm for gravitational microlensing. Built on JAX and its XLA just-in-time compiler, microJAX exploits GPU parallelism while providing exact gradients through automatic differentiation. The current release supports binary- and triple-lens geometries, including limb-darkened extended-source effects, and delivers magnifications that remain differentiable for all model parameters. Benchmarks show that microJAX matches the accuracy of established packages and attains up to a factor of $\sim$5-6 speed-up in the small-source, limb-darkened regime on an NVIDIA A100 GPU. Since the model is fully differentiable, it integrates seamlessly with probabilistic programming frameworks, enabling scalable Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and variational inference workflows. Although the present work focuses on standard microlensing magnification models, the modular architecture is designed to support upcoming implementations of microlensing higher-order effects, while remaining compatible with external likelihood frameworks that incorporate advanced noise models. microJAX thus provides a robust foundation for precise and large-scale surveys anticipated in the coming decade, including the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, where scalable, physically self-consistent inference will be essential for maximizing scientific return.

 - **Abstract**
 Multi-wavelength and multi-messenger astrophysics have experienced rapid growth over the past decade, seeking a complete picture of different cosmic phenomena. Transient sources, in particular, benefit from the input of multi-messenger observations, offering complementary perspectives on the same event while maximizing the detection probability of a rapidly fading signal. In this context, Gravitational Wave (GW) detections serve as perfect triggers for potential counterpart detections. Notably, a GW alert could be associated with a Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB), jetted cataclysmic events produced either by the collision of a binary neutron star system or a core-collapse supernova. These sources also radiate across the electromagnetic spectrum, allowing detection by X- and gamma-ray instruments aboard various satellites and thus enabling multi-wavelength triggering opportunities. The strong interest in minimizing reaction time to capture the full-time evolution of the emission, together with the often challenging localization uncertainties of the alerts, underscores the need for rapid and well-coordinated follow-up programs such as the one developed by the H.E.S.S. Collaboration. This contribution will give an overview of the transient follow-up strategy carried out by the H.E.S.S. Collaboration, from the external alert trigger and the automatic reaction of the observatory to the various analysis steps of the obtained observations. To illustrate this comprehensive strategy, we will show two examples of follow-up observations of both GRBs and GWs, highlighting key results and challenges in the search for an associated high-energy gamma-ray emission.

 - **Abstract**
 Most M dwarfs show higher chromospheric activity, often exceeding solar levels. Characterizing stellar activity is essential, particularly since these stars are prime targets in the search for habitable exoplanets. We investigate the stellar activity of active M dwarfs using TESS photometry combined with spectroscopic observations. We explore relations between flare occurrence rate (FOR), flare energies, rotation period, starspot filling factor, and chromospheric indicators. We also examine correlations between flare amplitude, duration, and cumulative flare frequency distributions to probe the mechanisms behind magnetic activity. We find that FOR is flat across spectral types M0-M4 but declines for cooler M dwarfs. Rapid rotators ($P_{\rm rot} < 1$ day) display significantly higher FOR and flare activity. M dwarfs with higher FOR tend to have lower flare amplitudes, suggesting that frequent flares are generally less energetic. For stars with 0.15--0.76 $M_\odot$, the median $L_{H\alpha}/L_{\rm bol}$ varies by a factor of 2.5 across mass bins of 0.1 $M_\odot$, while $\Delta$EW decreases by 92\%. The cumulative flare frequency distributions show a decrease in the power-law slope from M0 to M5, with $\alpha$ ranging from 1.68 to 1.95. Our results indicate a transition in stellar activity near M4, where stronger H$\alpha$ emission coincides with higher FOR. We confirm that chromospheric and flare activity follow a power-law relation, highlighting the interplay between magnetic fields and flaring in M dwarfs. We also find that fast rotators sustain frequent flaring through strong dynamos, and that highly active stars dissipate magnetic energy via numerous low-energy flares rather than rare high-energy ones.
#### Ultra-strong MgII absorbers trace both inflowing and outflowing gas: insights from dual down-the-barrel and quasar sightlines

 - **Abstract**
 We present Keck/LRIS spectroscopy of seven isolated galaxy--quasar pairs at $0.4 \leq z \leq 0.6$, each exhibiting ultra-strong MgII absorption ($W_{r,2796} \geq 3$ Å), probing both down-the-barrel and transverse gas flows. Down-the-barrel galaxy spectra reveal outflows in three galaxies ($v = 19$ to $311$ km s$^{-1}$) and inflows in five ($v = 61$ to $361$ km s$^{-1}$), including one system showing inflows and outflows simultaneously. All galaxies with detected inflows are below the star-forming main sequence, suggesting that they might be actively replenishing their gas reservoirs. Outflows have a mean covering fraction of $C_{f, \rm out}=0.5$, whereas inflows show a lower average of $C_{f, \rm in}=0.3$. Mass flow rates span $\dot{M}_{\rm in} = 0.01-1.18$ $M_{\odot} \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ for inflows and $\dot{M}_{\rm out} = 0.23-1.03$ $M_{\odot}\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ for outflows, yielding mass loading factors below unity and implying these galaxies cannot sustain their current level of star-formation rates. These results are based on the T $\sim 10^4$ K photoionised gas phase traced by MgII; additional accreting/outflowing material in other gas phases may also be present, but remains undetected in this study. Quasar sightlines consistently show redshifted inflow components and blueshifted outflow components, demonstrating that ultra-strong MgII absorbers trace baryon cycling out to impact parameters of $D = 15$ -- 31 kpc. Moreover, the unexpectedly high prevalence of inflows suggests that ultra-strong MgII absorbers offer a powerful strategy for future surveys to systematically map inflow and outflow cycles across cosmic time.

 - **Abstract**
 We present results from uGMRT 685 MHz observations of 87 QSOs belonging to the Palomar Green (PG) quasar sample with $z<0.5$. Radio emission is detected in all sources except for 3 radio-quiet (RQ) sources, viz., PG 0043+039, PG 1121+422, and PG 1552+085. The radio-loud (RL) $-$ RQ dichotomy persists at 685 MHz with only 1 source, PG 1216+069, changing its classification from RQ to RL. Approximately 1/3 of the detected RQ quasars display AGN-dominated radio emission while the rest may show additional contributions from stellar-related processes. Consistent with this, the RL and RQ quasars occupy distinct tracks on the `fundamental plane' of black hole activity. We find that RL quasars have $\log_{10}(L_{685\,\mathrm{MHz}}/\mathrm{W\,Hz}^{-1}) > 25.5$, while RQ quasars have ${\log_{10}(L_{685\,\mathrm{MHz}}/\mathrm{W\,Hz}^{-1})} <23.5$. Furthermore, the radio sizes display the RQ$-$RL divide as well with RQ sources typically having sizes $\lesssim30$ kpc, with only 16 ($\sim22$%) RQ sources having sizes between 30 and 100 kpc where there is an overlap with RL quasar sizes. A strong correlation exists between 685 MHz radio luminosity and black hole mass which is tightened when accretion rate is considered, highlighting the important role played by the accretion rate and accretion disk structure in jet production. We found no difference in the minimum-energy magnetic field strengths of the radio cores of RL and RQ quasars; however, different assumptions of source volume and volume filling factors may apply. High-resolution X-ray observations and radio-X-ray flux comparisons are needed to independently test the `magnetic flux paradigm'.

 - **Abstract**
 Self-lensing (SL) represents a powerful technique for detecting compact objects in binary systems through gravitational microlensing effects, when a compact companion transits in front of its luminous partner. We present the first comprehensive study of SL probability within globular cluster (GC) environments, utilizing synthetic stellar populations from MOCCA simulations to predict detection rates for the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT). Our analysis incorporates finite-size lens effects for white dwarf (WD) lenses and the specific observational characteristics of the ELT/MICADO instrument. We find that present-day GCs contain 1-50 SL sources with magnifications $\mu_\mathrm{sl} > 1+10^{-8}$, strongly dependent on initial binary fraction, with systems dominated by WD lenses paired with low-mass main-sequence companions. The predicted populations exhibit characteristic bimodal magnitude distributions with peaks at $m \approx 24$ and 32 mag at 10 kpc distance, and typical Einstein ring crossing times of $\tau_\mathrm{eff} \sim 2$ hours. ELT observations should achieve detection efficiency of 0.015-10 sources in $\sim150$ nearby GC after a year of observations depending on distance and survey strategy, with nearby clusters ($D \lesssim 10$ kpc) offering the highest yields. Multi-year monitoring campaigns with daily cadence provide order-of-magnitude improvements over single observations through enhanced photometric precision and increased detection probability. Our results demonstrate that coordinated ELT surveys of Galactic GCs represent a viable approach for probing hidden binary populations and compact object demographics in dense stellar environments, with comprehensive programs potentially yielding up to 10-100 well-characterized SL sources after first 5 years of observations suitable for statistical studies of binary evolution in extreme environments.

 - **Abstract**
 One of the most remarkable discoveries of JWST is a population of compact, red sources at z > 4, commonly referred to as Little Red Dots (LRDs). Spectroscopic identifications reported that most LRDs are active galactic nuclei (AGNs), which are preferentially found around z~6 and could imply a key phase in the formation and growth of black holes (BHs) in the early universe. Photometric surveys at lower redshift have recently been carried out to trace their evolution across cosmic time, and a small number of LRDs have been spectroscopically identified at both Cosmic Noon and in the local universe. Here we report the discovery of one of the lowest-z analogs of LRDs, J204837.26-002437.2 (hereafter J2048) at z = 0.4332, using new Gemini-N/GMOS IFU observations combined with archival multi-band photometric SED data. The GMOS data reveal extended blue emission from starburst with a star formation rate of 400 Msun yr-1, together with an extended, highly fast ionized outflow. This is the first spectroscopic confirmation of extended host emission and outflow in an LRD-like galaxy, providing a unique laboratory for understanding the nature of their high-redshift counterparts. Moreover, J2048 would host an extremely overmassive BH with a BH-to-stellar mass ratio of 0.6, with the BH mass and host stellar mass estimated to be 10^10.2 and 10^10.4 Msun, respectively. We discuss the origin and evolutionary fate of J2048, and the implications that such low-z analogs have for interpreting the properties of high-z LRDs.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational lens flux ratio anomalies are a powerful probe of small-scale mass structures within lens galaxies. These anomalies are often attributed to dark matter subhalos, but the baryonic components of the lens can also play a significant role. This study investigates the impact of galactic bars, a common feature in spiral galaxies, on flux ratio anomalies. We conduct a systematic analysis using a sample of 21 barred galaxies from the high-resolution Auriga cosmological simulations. First, we model the projected mass distribution of these galaxies with the Multi-Gaussian Expansion formalism. This method yields smooth lens potentials that preserve the primary bar structure while mitigating numerical noise. We then perform strong lensing simulations and quantify the flux ratio anomalies by measuring their deviation from the theoretical cusp-caustic relation. To characterize the structural properties of the bars, we use a Fourier decomposition of the surface mass density in the bar region. Our primary finding is a strong, statistically significant correlation between the magnitude of the flux ratio anomaly and the strength of higher-order even Fourier modes. Specifically, the strengths of the boxy/peanut and hexapole components show an exceptionally tight correlation with the flux anomaly, with Spearman correlation coefficients of r=0.85 and 0.89, and p-values on the order of 1e-6 and 1e-8, respectively. This demonstrates that flux ratio anomalies are highly sensitive to the complex, non-axisymmetric features of galactic bars. We conclude that the flux ratio anomaly can be a powerful indicator of a galactic bar's complex morphology. Failing to account for a bar's complex morphology can lead to a misinterpretation of the lensing signature, potentially causing an overestimation of the dark matter subhalo population.

 - **Abstract**
 Type II radio bursts are signatures of shock waves generated by solar eruptions, observed at radio wavelengths. While metric (m) type II bursts originate in the lower corona, their longer-wavelength (up to kilometers) counterparts extend into interplanetary space. A rare but valuable feature observed in some type II bursts is band splitting in their dynamic spectra, which provides crucial insights into physical parameters such as shock speed, Alfvén Mach number, Alfvén speed, and coronal magnetic field strength (B). In this study, we investigate band-splitting in 44 m-type II radio bursts observed by the Radio Solar Telescope Network during solar cycle 24 (2009 -- 2019). These events exhibit splitting in both fundamental and harmonic bands and are analyzed under both perpendicular and parallel shocks. All events are associated to solar flares and 41 (93 \%) with the coronal mass ejections. Shock speeds, derived using a hybrid coronal density model proposed by \cite{Vrsnak2004}, range from $\approx$ 350 to 1727 \kms. The relative bandwidth (BDW) of the split bands remains constant with frequency and height. Alfvén Mach numbers indicate moderate shock strength (1.06 -- 3.38), while Alfvén speeds and $B$ vary from $\approx$ 230 -- 1294 \kms\ and $\approx$ 0.48 -- 7.13 G, respectively. Power-law relationships are established as $BDW \propto f_L^{-0.4}$ and $BDW \propto R^{\sim1}$, while the coronal magnetic field decreases with height as $B \propto R^{\sim-3}$. These results enhance our understanding of shock dynamics and magnetic field structures in the solar corona.

 - **Abstract**
 Quasi-periodic fast propagating magnetosonic waves (QFPs) were discovered in the solar corona in EUV since the launch of SDO spacecraft more than a decade ago. The QFP waves are associated with flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) providing information on flare pulsations as well as on the magnetic field by MHD wave seismology. Previous models of QFP waves used primarily idealized magnetic active region structures. However, more realistic active region numerical models are needed to improve the application of coronal seismology to observations of waves in coronal structures. Here, we extend the previous models by including realistic magnetic configuration based on an observed coronal active region in a case study using AR 11166 observed on March 10, 2011 by SDO/AIA, using potential field extrapolation of photospheric magnetic field with realistic gravitationally stratified density structure { with typical coronal temperature} in our resistive 3D MHD model. We aim at reproducing the observed QFPs properties, such as directionality, propagation, reflection, nonlinearity, and damping of these waves. We model various forms of excitation of QFPs through time dependent boundary conditions, and localized pulses at the base of the corona. We produce synthetic emission measure (EM) maps from the 3D MHD modeling results to facilitate comparison to EUV observations. We find that the present more realistic model provides better qualitative agreement with observations compared to previous idealized models, improving the study of QFP wave excitation, propagation and damping in coronal ARs, with potential applications to coronal seismology.

 - **Abstract**
 In the last few years, a few supermassive black holes (SMBHs) have shown short-term (of the order of hours) X-ray variability. Given the limited size of the sample, every new addition to this class of SMBHs can bring invaluable information. Within the context of an automated search for X-ray sources showing flux variability in the \textit{Chandra} archive, we identified peculiar variability patterns in 2MASX J12571076+2724177 (J1257), a SMBH in the Coma cluster, during observations performed in 2020. We investigated the long-term evolution of the flux, together with the evolution of the spectral parameters throughout the \textit{Chandra} and \textit{XMM-Newton} observations, which cover a time span of approximately 20 years. We found that J1257 has repeatedly shown peculiar variability over the last 20 years, on typical timescales of $\simeq20-25$ ks. From our spectral analysis, we found hints of a softer-when-brighter behaviour and of two well-separated flux states. We suggest that J1257 might represent a new addition to the ever-growing size of relatively low mass SMBHs ($M\simeq10^6-10^7\mathrm{M}_\odot$) showing extreme, possibly quasi-periodic X-ray variability on short time scales. The available dataset does not allow for a definitive classification of the nature of the variability. However, given the observed properties, it could either represent a quasi-periodic oscillation at particularly low frequency or be associated with quasi-periodic eruptions in an AGN with peculiar spectral properties.

 - **Abstract**
 The recent detection of refractory molecules in massive star-forming regions provides a means of probing the innermost regions of disks around massive stars. These detections also make it possible to explore the chemical composition of refractories through gas-phase observations. In this regard, identifying refractory compounds containing sulfur could reveal potential connections between sulfur and refractories, as well as help determine the sulfur budget in these extreme environments. We find convincing evidence of a reliable detection of CaS, and tentative detections of KS and KSH in the disk G351.77-mm1. These are the first ever identifications of these species in the interstellar medium. The CaS, KS, and KSH column densities are about 3 orders of magnitude lower than those of the abundant sulfur compounds SO$_2$, CH$_3$SH and SiS, proving that these species are not the major reservoir of sulfur at the spatial scales probed by our observations. Higher angular resolution observations at different wavelengths are required to confirm these detections, which are of paramount importance to gain insights into the formation of gas-phase refractory molecules.
#### Fluorescent Fe K line emission of gamma Cas stars II. Predictions for magnetic interactions and white-dwarf accretion scenarios

 - **Abstract**
 About 12 percent of the early-type Be stars, so-called gamma Cas stars, exhibit an unusually hard and bright thermal X-ray emission that could result from accretion onto a white dwarf companion or from magnetic interactions between the Be star and its decretion disk. Exploring the full power of high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy of gamma Cas stars requires comparison of observations of the fluorescent Fe Kalpha emission lines near 6.4 keV with synthetic profiles of this line complex computed in the framework of the magnetic interaction and the accreting WD scenarios. For the latter, we further distinguish between accretion onto a non-magnetic and a magnetic WD. Our models account for different reservoirs of reprocessing material: the Be circumstellar decretion disk, the Be photosphere, an accretion disk around the WD companion, a magnetically channelled accretion flow and the WD photosphere. We find considerably different line properties for the different scenarios. For a non-magnetic accreting WD, the global Fe Kalpha complex is extremely broad, reaching a full width of 140 eV, whilst it is ~ 40 eV for the magnetic star-disk interaction and the magnetic accreting WD cases. In the magnetic star-disk interaction, the line centroid follows the orbital motion of the Be star, whereas it moves along with the WD in the case of an accreting WD. For gamma Cas, given the 15 times larger amplitude of the WD orbital motion, the shift in position for an accreting WD should be easily detectable with high-resolution spectrographs such as Resolve on XRISM, but remains essentially undetectable for the magnetic star-disk interaction. Upcoming high-resolution spectroscopy of the fluorescent Fe Kalpha emission lines in the X-ray spectra of gamma Cas stars will thus allow to distinguish between the competing scenarios.

 - **Abstract**
 The persistence of radiative signatures in giant radio galaxies remains a frontier topic of research, with contemporary telescopes revealing intricate features that require investigation. This study aims to examine the emission characteristics of simulated GRGs, and correlate them with their underlying 3D dynamical properties. Sky-projected continuum and polarization maps at 1 GHz were computed from five 3D-RMHD simulations by integrating the synthesized emissivity data along the line of sight, with the integration path chosen to reflect the GRG evolution in the sky plane. The emissivities were derived from these RMHD simulations, featuring FR-I and FR-II jets injected from different locations of the large-scale environment. The jet-cocoon morphologies are strongly shaped by the triaxiality of the environment, resulting in features like wings and asymmetric cocoons, thereby making morphology a crucial indicator of GRG formation mechanisms. The decollimation of the bulk flow in GRG jets gives rise to intricate cocoon features, most notably filamentary structures-magnetically dominated threads with lifespans of a few Myr. High-jet-power cases frequently display enhanced emission zones at mid-cocoon distances (alongside warmspots around the jet-head), contradicting the interpretations of the GRG as a restarting source. In such cases, examining the lateral intensity variation of the cocoon may reveal the source's state, with a gradual decrease in emission suggesting a low-active stage. This study highlights that applying a simple radio power-jet power relation to a statistical GRG sample is unfeasible, as it depends on growth conditions of individual GRGs. Effects such as inverse-Compton CMB cooling and matter entrainment significantly impact the long-term emission persistence of GRGs. The diminishing fractional polarization with GRG evolution reflects increasing turbulence in the cocoon.

 - **Abstract**
 In addition to the radio continuum emission of the thin galactic disk, vertically extended emission is ubiquitous in starforming disk galaxies. This halo emission can represent an important fraction of the total emission of the galaxy The cosmic ray electrons (CRe) responsible for the radio continuum emission are produced within the thin disk and transported into the halo. We made an attempt to reconstruct the radial properties of radio continuum halos in nearly edge-on galaxies where the star formation rate (SFR) distribution can be deprojected and the vertical radio continuum emission is well distinct from the disk emission. The deprojected SFR distribution is convolved with a Gaussian kernel to take CRe diffusion within the galactic disk into account and a vertical profile of the radio continuum emissivity is added to the disk emission. The three-dimensional emission distribution is then projected on the sky and compared to VLA radio continuum observations at 20 and 6 cm. We found that overall the halo emission contains information on the underlying distribution of the star formation rate. The majority of our galaxies show flaring radio continuum halos. Except for one galaxy, our Virgo galaxies follow the trend of increasing effective height with increasing radio continuum size found by the CHANG-ES collaboration. We confirm that radio continuum halos can represent a significant fraction of the total radio continuum emission of a starforming spiral galaxy. At 20 cm and 6 cm between 30 and 70 of the total radio continuum emission originate in the halo. We propose a halo classification based on the height ratio and SI between 20 and 6cm. If we interpret the vertical structures of the large-scale magnetic field within the disk-halo and halo types as a sign of a galactic outflow or wind, all galaxies except one most probably harbor an advection-dominated halo.

 - **Abstract**
 Observing giant HII regions at fine spatial scales uncovers detailed structures and reveals variations in ionization, abundance, and dynamical properties of ionized gas and the effect of stellar feedback. Using emission line data of M33 observed with SITELLE as part of the Star-formation, Ionized Gas, and Nebular Abundances Legacy Survey (SIGNALS), we present maps of the principal optical emission line ratios for NGC 604, the most luminous HII region in M33. The excitation maps align well with the H$\alpha$ morphology and are clearly related to the location of the central stellar cluster and secondary stellar groups. The maps of ionization-sensitive line ratios show substantial variations across the face of NGC 604. We demonstrate that these variations are unlikely to be due to chemical inhomogeneities but are primarily caused by changes in ionization, which in turn affect the observed line ratios. We present the H$\alpha$ kinematics of the region and connect it to the excitation structure, showing how the dynamic motions influence the spatial distribution of ionized gas. We note two distinct sources identified in these excitation maps: a known supernova remnant and a previously unknown planetary nebula. Such parsec-scale features contribute only a small percentage to the overall light and would remain undetected without the use of high-resolution spatial data. Throughout the paper, we make comparisons to and raise concerns about single-aperture and long-slit spectroscopic measurements of giant HII regions, highlighting the limitations and potential inaccuracies of such methods.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive investigation of the magnetic cycle of the young, active solar analogue $\iota$ Horologii ($\iota$ Hor) based on intensive spectropolarimetric monitoring using HARPSpol. Over a nearly three-year campaign, the technique of Zeeman-Doppler Imaging (ZDI) was used to reconstruct 18 maps of the large-scale surface magnetic field of the star. These maps trace the evolution of the magnetic field morphology over approximately 139 stellar rotations. Our analysis uncovers pronounced temporal evolution, including multiple polarity reversals and changes in field strength and geometry. We examine the evolution of the poloidal and toroidal field components, with the toroidal component showing strong modulation in concert with the chromospheric activity. Furthermore, for the first time, we reconstruct stellar magnetic butterfly diagrams which are used to trace the migration of large-scale magnetic features across the stellar surface, determining a magnetic polarity reversal timescale of roughly 100 rotations ($\sim773$ d). In addition, by tracking the field-weighted latitudinal positions, we obtain the first estimates of the large-scale flow properties on a star other than the Sun, identifying possible pole-ward and equator-ward drift speeds for different field polarities. These results provide critical insights into the dynamo processes operating in young solar-type stars and offer a direct comparison with the solar magnetic cycle.

 - **Abstract**
 The Virgo Cluster is the nearest cool core cluster that features two well-studied sloshing cold fronts at radii of $r \approx 30$ kpc and $r \approx 90$ kpc, respectively. In this work, we present results of XMM-Newton mosaic observations of a third, southwestern, cold front at a radius of $r \approx 250$ kpc, originally discovered with Suzaku. All three cold fronts are likely to be parts of an enormous swirling pattern, rooted in the core. The comparison with a numerical simulation of a binary cluster merger indicates that these cold fronts were produced in the same single event $-$ likely the infall of M49 from the northwest of Virgo and it is now re-entering the cluster from the south. This outermost cold front has probably survived for $2-3$ Gyr since the disturbance. We identified single sharp edges in the surface brightness profiles of the southern and southwestern sections of the cold front, whereas the western section is better characterized with double edges. This implies that magnetic fields have preserved the leading edge of the cold front, while its western side is beginning to split into two cold fronts likely due to Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. The slopes of the 2D power spectrum of the X-ray surface brightness fluctuations, derived for the brighter side of the cold front, are consistent with the expectation from Kolmogorov turbulence. Our findings highlight the role of cold fronts in shaping the thermal dynamics of the intracluster medium beyond the cluster core, which has important implications for cluster cosmology. Next-generation X-ray observatories, such as the proposed AXIS mission, will be ideal for identifying and characterizing ancient cold fronts.

 - **Abstract**
 The equipartition model is widely used to estimate magnetic field strength from synchrotron intensity in radio galaxies, yet the validity of its underlying assumptions remains uncertain. Using an Arepo simulation which incorporates a two-moment cosmic ray (CR) transport scheme and a multiphase interstellar medium, we compare magnetic fields inferred from synthetic synchrotron emission maps with the true fields in the simulation. Starting from the derivation of the equipartition formula, we find that the deviation between the equipartition magnetic field and the true magnetic field depends only weakly on the ratio of the magnetic to the CR energy density. In practice, for both face-on and edge-on projections, the equipartition model slightly overestimates the total synchrotron-weighted magnetic field with mean offsets of 32% (0.17 dex) and 36% (0.2 dex), even though the energy equipartition does not hold locally. Beyond these average offsets, a clear trend emerges in edge-on projections that the model underestimates the field in the disk and overestimates it in the halo. Our results demonstrate that the validity of the equipartition model depends only weakly on the strict fulfillment of energy equipartition, and that the equipartition model remains a practical method for estimating magnetic field strengths in face-on projection maps based on our CR-magnetohydrodynamics simulation.
