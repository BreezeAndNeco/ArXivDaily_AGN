#### New estimates of the spin and accretion rate of the black hole M87*
 - **Authors:** Michael Drew, Joshua S. Stanway, Brett A. Patterson, Timothy J. Walton, Derek Ward-Thompson
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17035

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.17035

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper we use the imaging results of M87* from the EHT to calculate the rotational velocity of the inner edge of the accretion disk and find a value of $\sim$0.14c. We then calculate the dimensionless spin parameter, $a$, of the black hole, obtaining a value of $a \sim 0.8$. We deduce that this is probably a lower limit. We go on to use the results of the EHT polarization study of the magnetic field direction in the accretion disk of M87* as a proxy for the direction of motion of the spiralling accreting matter in this highly ionized disk. This direction is defined by the vector sum of the tangential rotation velocity and the inward radial accretion velocity. We thus calculate the accretion velocity to be $\sim$ (7 $\pm$ 0.7) $\times$ $10^7$~ms$^{-1}$. We go on to estimate a range of values for the accretion rate from the inner disk to be $\sim$4 $\times$ 10$^{-5}$ to $\sim$4 $\times$ 10$^{-1}$ M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$, and a range of values for the accretion power to be $\sim$10$^{34}$ to 10$^{38}$ J/s. This is the same range as the power of the jet, making it consistent with accretion-driven jet models.
#### Caught in the act: detections of recoiling supermassive black holes from simulations

 - **Abstract**
 We study the detectability of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with masses of $M_{\bullet}\gtrsim 10^{9}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ displaced by gravitational wave recoil kicks $(v_{\rm kick}=0\mathrm{-}2000\,\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1})$ in simulations of merging massive $(M_{\star}>10^{11}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot)$ early-type galaxies. The used KETJU code combines the GADGET-4 fast multiple gravity solver with accurate regularised integration and post-Newtonian corrections (up to PN3.5) around SMBHs. The ejected SMBHs carry clusters of bound stellar material (black hole recoil clusters, BRCs) with masses in the range of $10^6 \lesssim M_{\text{BRC}} \lesssim 10^7\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ and sizes of several $10\,\mathrm{pc}$. For recoil velocities up to $60\%$ of the galaxy escape velocity, the BRCs are detectable in mock photometric images at a Euclid-like resolution up to redshift $z \sim 1.0$. By Monte Carlo sampling the observability for different recoil directions and magnitudes, we predict that in $\sim20\%$ of instances the BRCs are photometrically detectable, most likely for kicks with SMBH apocentres less than the galaxy effective radius. BRCs occupy distinct regions in the stellar mass/velocity dispersion vs. size relations of known star clusters and galaxies. An enhanced velocity dispersion in excess of $\sigma \sim 600\,\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}$ coinciding with the SMBH position provides the best evidence for an SMBH-hosting stellar system, effectively distinguishing BRCs from other faint stellar systems. BRCs are promising candidates to observe the aftermath of the yet-undetected mergers of the most massive SMBHs and we estimate that up to 8000 BRCs might be observable below $z\lesssim 0.6$ with large-scale photometric surveys such as Euclid and upcoming high-resolution imaging and spectroscopy with the Extremely Large Telescope.

 - **Abstract**
 Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) have now been discovered out to redshift $z=13$, and are valuable probes of the reionization history at redshifts beyond the reach of other currently available tracers. Most inferences of the neutral hydrogen fraction from LAE observations rely on one-point and two-point statistics like the luminosity function and the power spectrum. We present here an analysis of the bispectrum of high-redshift LAEs and demonstrate its sensitivity to the Epoch of Reionization. We use the Sherwood-Relics suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations post-processed with the GPU-based radiative transfer code ATON-HE to generate realistic LAE mock catalogues for a wide range of reionization models, varying the ionization history and the source populations, including contributions of AGN to hydrogen reionization. We demonstrate that the bispectrum provides greater sensitivity than the power spectrum to both the timing and spatial morphology of reionization. Using reduced-$\chi^2$ analysis we further show that the bispectrum also responds more strongly to variations in source population and AGN contribution, apparently more efficiently capturing morphological features missed by two-point statistics. The redshift evolution of the bispectrum reflects the increased clustering of ionizing sources at earlier epochs. The sensitivity of the bispectrum to peculiar velocities underscores the importance of velocity corrections in comparisons to observations. Our findings demonstrate that the LAE bispectrum is a powerful higher-order statistic for probing reionization through current and future LAE surveys using telescopes such as Subaru and JWST.

 - **Abstract**
 The Milky Way Backup Program (MWBP), a survey currently underway with the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) on the Nicholas U. Mayall 4-m Telescope, works at the margins of the DESI Main surveys to obtain spectra of millions of additional stars from the Gaia catalog. Efficiently utilizing twilight times (<18 deg) and poor weather conditions, the MWBP extends the range of stellar sources studied to both brighter magnitudes and lower Galactic latitude and declination than the stars studied in DESI's Main Milky Way Survey. While the MWBP prioritizes candidate giant stars selected from the Gaia catalog (using color and parallax criteria), it also includes an unbiased sample of bright stars (i.e., 11.2 < G < 16 mag) as well as fainter sources (to G < 19 mag). As of March 1, 2025, the survey had obtained spectra of ~7 million stars, approximately 1.2 million of which are included in the DESI Data Release 1. The full survey, when completed, will cover an area of more than 21,000 square degrees and include approximately 10 million Gaia sources, roughly equal to the number of stellar spectra obtained through the DESI Main Survey, while only utilizing <9% of all DESI observing time.

 - **Abstract**
 Studying metal-poor galaxies is crucial for understanding the physical mechanisms driving the evolution of galaxies. Most observational works in dwarf galaxies employ integral field unit data to investigate gas physics in the entire galaxy body. However, previous studies have not explored the detailed spatially resolved properties of individual extragalactic HII regions. We study the only known HII region in the SagDIG dIrr, a metal-poor dwarf galaxy of the local universe, using VIMOS-IFU/VLT and EFOSC2/NTT archival data. We aim to probe the structure of the gaseous nebulae to (i) give insights into the physical processes shaping its gas dynamics, and (ii) relate these mechanisms to the low gas-phase metallicity content estimated with the direct method. The H$\beta$ emission line map shows two clumps as a biconic-like structure aligned across the same axis. The [OIII]$\lambda$5007 map, on the other hand, shows a more symmetric structure. Radial flux density profiles exhibit signatures of ionized stratification. By comparing the gas structure with the stellar population in the same region, the young stellar population ($<700$ Myr) are found closer to the edges of the biconic-like structure. We estimate 12+log(O/H) = $7.23\pm0.04$ dex with the direct method, considering the whole nebula. Temperature fluctuations are detected, as variations of $T_{e}$ from $\sim 23400$K to $\sim 22000$K, and oxygen abundances from 7.24$\pm0.05$ to 7.50$\pm0.14$ dex, from the centre to the outskirts, respectively. In addition, SagDIG is in line with the low-mass end of the MZR. The observed stratification, the distribution of young MS stars, and the metal-poor content of the HII region suggest that the evolution of SagDIG seems to be actively shaped by stellar feedback processes, likely as the result of extragalactic HII regions being subject to the same gas physics as HII regions of the Milky-Way.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a spectroscopic investigation of 25 objects previously reported as possible Planetary Nebulae (PNe) in recent catalogs to obtain their physical properties and to establish their true nature. We found 11 objects showing intense emission lines, 11 where it was not possible to measure $\mathrm{H{\beta}}$, and three where no lines are present. We have used diagnostic diagrams to confirm the true PN nature for eight objects. We obtained elemental abundances for three objects whose values are in agreement with the PNe mean values for our Galaxy. Four objects show [N II] $\lambda$6583 more intense than $\mathrm{H{\alpha}}$, and for two of them, this can be explained by the presence of shocks in the gas. Finally, we report angular sizes based on $\mathrm{H{\alpha}}$ and [O III] $\lambda$5007 emission.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the statistical analysis of quasar photoevaporation at $z\sim2.2$ by comparing the density of surrounding Ly$\alpha$ Emitters (LAEs) and continuum-selected galaxies, based on the imaging data of Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Subaru Strategic Program (SSP) and CFHT Large Area $U$-band Deep Survey (CLAUDS). We select 18 quasars from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) in the HSC Deep/UltraDeep fields, normalize the LAE/continuum-selected galaxy distribution around each quasar with the quasar proximity size, stack them, and then measure the average densities of the galaxies. As a result, we find that the density of LAEs is $\gtrsim 5 \sigma$ lower than that of continuum-selected galaxies within the quasar proximity region. Within the quasar proximity region, we find that the LAEs with high Ly$\alpha$ equivalent widths (EWs) are less dense than those with low EWs at the 3$\sigma$ level and that LAEs with EW of $\gtrsim150$ Å(rest-frame) are predominantly scarce. Finally, we find that both LAEs and continuum-selected galaxies have smaller densities when they are closer to quasars. We argue that the photoevaporation effect is more effective for smaller dark matter haloes predominantly hosting LAEs, but that it may also affect larger haloes.

 - **Abstract**
 High-mass star formation involves complex processes, with the hot core phase playing a crucial role in chemical enrichment and the formation of complex organic molecules. However, molecular inventories in hot cores remain limited. Using data from the ALMA Three-millimeter Observations of Massive Star-forming regions survey (ATOMS), the molecular composition and evolutionary stages of two distinct millimeter continuum sources in the high-mass star forming region G336.99-00.03 have been characterized. MM1, with 19 distinct molecular species detected, along with 8 isotopologues and several vibrationally/torsionally excited states, has been identified as a hot core. MM2 with only 5 species identified, was defined as a HII region. Isotopic ratios in MM1 were derived, with $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ranging from 16.0 to 29.2, $^{16}$O/$^{18}$O at 47.7, and $^{32}$S/$^{34}$S at 19.2. Molecular abundances in MM1 show strong agreement with other sources and three-phase warm-up chemical models within an order of magnitude for most species. Formation pathways of key molecules were explored, revealing chemical links and reaction networks. This study provides a detailed molecular inventory of two millimeter continuum sources, shedding light on the chemical diversity and evolutionary processes in high-mass star-forming regions. The derived molecular parameters and isotopic ratios offer benchmarks for astrochemical models, paving the way for further investigation into the formation and evolution of complex organic molecules during the hot core phase.

 - **Abstract**
 Accretion onto supermassive black hole (SMBH) releases energy via radiation, jets or winds, providing feedback effects on the circumnuclear gas environment. However, the dynamics of accreting gas on sub-parsec scales near the SMBH remains poorly understood. With high-resolution X-ray spectra of Mrk 3, we detect a fast inflowing ionized absorber characterized by redshifted Fe XXV and Fe XXVI absorption lines. Photoionization modeling reveals the inflowing absorber is located at $\lesssim0.04-0.74\rm~pc$ and is decelerating from $6.1\pm0.5\times10^3\rm~km~s^{-1}$ to $3.4\pm0.3\times10^3\rm~km~s^{-1}$ over 11 years. Only $\sim0.6$\%--$3$\% of the inflowing material is estimated to reach the event horizon. This direct evidence of sub-parsec scale fueling inflow bridges the gap between the torus and the outer accretion disk. Furthermore, a $0.86$-keV gas component with sub-solar metallicity ($Z\sim0.22$), outflowing at a velocity of $\sim330\rm~km~s^{-1}$, is detected in the soft X-ray band. It may corresponds to the [O III] biconical outflow in the narrow-line region. A putative ultra-fast disk wind outside our line-of-sight, or clouds within the broad-line region, are promising candidates for decelerating the inflowing absorber.

 - **Abstract**
 In large-scale galaxy surveys, particularly deep ground-based photometric studies, galaxy blending is inevitable and poses a potential primary systematic uncertainty for upcoming surveys. Current deblenders predominantly rely on analytical modeling of galaxy profiles, facing limitations due to inflexible and imprecise models. We present a novel approach using a U-net structured transformer-based network for deblending astronomical images, which we term the CAT-deblender. It was trained using both RGB and grz-band images, spanning two distinct data formats from the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS) database, including galaxies with diverse morphologies. Our method requires only the approximate central coordinates of each target galaxy, bypassing assumptions on neighboring source counts. Post-deblending, our RGB images retain a high signal-to-noise peak, showing superior structural similarity to ground truth. For multi-band images, the ellipticity of central galaxies and median reconstruction error for the r-band consistently lie within +/-0.025 to +/-0.25, revealing minimal pixel residuals. In our comparison focused on flux recovery, our model shows a mere 1 percent error in magnitude recovery for quadruply blended galaxies, significantly outperforming SExtractor's higher error rate of 4.8 percent. By cross-matching with publicly accessible overlapping galaxy catalogs from the DECaLS database, we successfully deblended 433 overlapping galaxies. Furthermore, we demonstrated effective deblending of 63,733 blended galaxy images randomly selected from the DECaLS database.
#### How Reconnection-Unfavored Magnetic Flux Emergence Suppresses Solar Filament Eruptions

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic flux emergence is traditionally considered a key trigger of solar filament eruptions; however, its role in suppressing filament eruptions remains less understood. Using multi-wavelength observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory, this study investigates a unique case of flux emergence below a quiescent filament from January 3 to 5, 2016, where the newly emerging magnetic flux suppressed rather than promoted the eruption of the filament. It is found that the emerging magnetic bipole within the filament channel directly interacted and reconnected with the overlying filament magnetic field and produced a series of two-sided coronal jets along the filament axis. Instead of eruption, the filament kept stable but broke into two segments at the reconnection site. Further magnetic cancellation or recession of the emerged bipole allowed the filament to recover its original structure. Our analysis results revealed that the flux emergence suppressed the filament eruption by reducing the upward net force. The formation and evolution of filament fine structures, such as filament threads, are closely linked to the reconnection processes between the emerging bipole and the horizontal magnetic field of the filament. This study provides direct observational evidence for the stabilization of solar filaments driven by flux emergence, offering new insights into the dual role of magnetic emergence in triggering and suppressing solar eruptions.
#### SN 2023gpw: exploring the diversity and power sources of hydrogen-rich superluminous supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 We present our observations and analysis of SN~2023gpw, a hydrogen-rich superluminous supernova (SLSN~II) with broad emission lines in its post-peak spectra. Unlike previously observed SLSNe~II, its light curve suggests an abrupt drop during a solar conjunction between $\sim$80 and $\sim$180~d after the light-curve peak, possibly analogous to a normal hydrogen-rich supernova (SN). Spectra taken at and before the peak show hydrogen and helium `flash' emission lines attributed to early interaction with a dense confined circumstellar medium (CSM). A well-observed ultraviolet excess appears as these lines disappear, also as a result of CSM interaction. The blackbody photosphere expands roughly at the same velocity throughout the observations, indicating little or no bulk deceleration. This velocity is much higher than what is seen in spectral lines, suggesting asymmetry in the ejecta. The high total radiated energy ($\gtrsim9\times10^{50}$~erg) and aforementioned lack of bulk deceleration in SN~2023gpw are difficult to reconcile with a neutrino-driven SN simply combined with efficient conversion from kinetic energy to emission through interaction. This suggests an additional energy source such as a central engine. While magnetar-powered models qualitatively similar to SN~2023gpw exist, more modeling work is required to determine if they can reproduce the observed properties in combination with early interaction. The required energy might alternatively be provided by accretion onto a black hole created in the collapse of a massive progenitor star.
#### Hidden magnetic fields of the quiet Sun derived from Hanle depolarization of lines of the "second solar spectrum" at the limb from Pic du Midi observations

 - **Abstract**
 This paper is based on a dataset of many strongly polarized solar lines belonging to the ''second solar spectrum'', i.e. the spectrum near the limb in linear scattering polarization. The observations were done at the Pic du Midi Turret Dome in 2006. The solar spectra were recorded at high spectral resolution (R = 400000) with the spectrograph slit orthogonal to the solar limb, so that $\mu$ = cos$\theta$ continuously varied from 0 .0 to 0.45. The crystal liquid polarimeter delivered the linear polarization rate (Q/I). Strong lines such as CaII 3934 Å, CaI 4227 Å, SrI 4607 Å, SrII 4078 Å, BaII 4554 Å were studied. We measured the Hanle depolarization with the help of models predicting the polarization envelope with no magnetic field and we got values in the range 13-25 Gauss for the unresolved turbulent magnetic field, and we found that it often decreases towards the limb, revealing an altitude gradient. This present analysis was not yet published and spectra shown here become freely available to the research community.

 - **Abstract**
 General-purpose large language models, despite their broad capabilities, often struggle with specialized domain knowledge, a limitation particularly pronounced in more accessible, lower-parameter versions. This gap hinders their deployment as effective agents in demanding fields such as astronomy. Building on our prior work with AstroSage-8B, this study introduces AstroSage-70B, a significantly larger and more advanced domain-specialized natural-language AI assistant. It is designed for research and education across astronomy, astrophysics, space science, astroparticle physics, cosmology, and astronomical instrumentation. Developed from the Llama-3.1-70B foundation, AstroSage-70B underwent extensive continued pre-training on a vast corpus of astronomical literature, followed by supervised fine-tuning and model merging. Beyond its 70-billion parameter scale, this model incorporates refined datasets, judiciously chosen learning hyperparameters, and improved training procedures, achieving state-of-the-art performance on complex astronomical tasks. Notably, we integrated reasoning chains into the SFT dataset, enabling AstroSage-70B to either answer the user query immediately, or first emit a human-readable thought process. Evaluated on the AstroMLab-1 benchmark -- comprising 4,425 questions from literature withheld during training -- AstroSage-70B achieves state-of-the-art performance. It surpasses all other tested open-weight and proprietary models, including leading systems like o3, Gemini-2.5-Pro, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, Deepseek-R1, and Qwen-3-235B, even those with API costs two orders of magnitude higher. This work demonstrates that domain specialization, when applied to large-scale models, can enable them to outperform generalist counterparts in specialized knowledge areas like astronomy, thereby advancing the frontier of AI capabilities in the field.

 - **Abstract**
 Ambient dark matter (DM) around binary black holes can imprint characteristic signatures on gravitational waves emitted from their merger. The exact signature depends sensitively on the DM density profile around the black holes. We run very high resolution cosmological hydrodynamics simulations of first star formation that follow the collapse of a $3\times10^{5}\,M_\odot$ mini-halo from $z=49$ to $z\simeq22$. Our flagship model achieves a DM particle mass of $3.7\times10^{-4}\,M_\odot$ and resolves the inner-most structure down to $0.02\,$pc. We show that the halo experiences a two-stage gravitational collapse, where a rotating, constant-density core with $r\lesssim3\,$pc is formed first, surrounded by an extended outskirts. Baryonic infall toward the center continues to raise the local Keplerian velocity and promotes adiabatic contraction of DM. The resulting density profile has an approximately power-law shape of $\rho_{\rm dm} \propto r^{-0.6}$ inside $\sim\!1\,$this http URL find that a piecewise power-law fit reproduces the simulation result to better than 10\%, and also find numerical convergence down to $\simeq\!0.01\,$pc. The DM density profile is typical for ordinary Pop~III halos, but our additional simulations reveal that inner slope varies significantly with halo-to-halo scatter, and the effect of Lyman-Werner irradiation and of supersonic baryon-DM streaming velocities, implying a wide distribution of slopes rather than a single universal curve. The large variation should be considered when calculating the predicted DM-induced dephasing of gravitational waves by up to an order of magnitude relative to the classical analytic model of the DM spike.
#### An improved Seyfert-LINER classification line in the [N~{\sc ii}] BPT diagram

 - **Abstract**
 In this manuscript, an improved Seyfert-LINER classification line (= S-L line) is proposed in the [N~{\sc ii}] BPT diagram, based on a sample of 47,968 low redshift narrow emission line galaxies from SDSS DR16, motivated by different S-L lines reported in the [N~{\sc ii}] BPT diagram through different methods. The method proposed by Kewley et al. in 2006 is firstly applied, however, the method cannot lead to an accepted S-L line in the [N~{\sc ii}] BPT diagram. Meanwhile, the S-L lines proposed by Schawinski et al. in 2007 and Cid Fernandes et al. in 2010 in the [N~{\sc ii}] BPT diagram are different from each other. Therefore, it is meaningful to check which proposed S-L line is better or to determine an improved one in the [N~{\sc ii}] BPT diagram by a new method. In this manuscript, Seyferts and LINERs that have already been classified in the [S~{\sc ii}] and/or [O~{\sc i}] BPT diagrams can be visualized in the [N~{\sc ii}] BPT diagram, leading the intersection boundary of the two contour maps to be considered as the S-L line in the [N~{\sc ii}] BPT diagram. Rather than the previously proposed S-L lines, the new S-L line can lead to more efficient and harmonious classifications of Seyferts and LINERs, especially in the composite galaxy region, in the [N~{\sc ii}] BPT diagram. Furthermore, based on the discussed S-L lines, the number ratio of Type-2 Seyferts to Type-2 LINERs differs significantly from that of Type-1 Seyferts to Type-1 LINERs in the [N~{\sc ii}] BPT diagram, suggesting that about 90$\%$ of Type-2 LINERs are non-AGN-related objects, true Type-2 AGNs, or objects exhibiting both Seyfert and LINER characteristics.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations of the repeating fast radio burst FRB 20201124A by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) revealed a second-scale periodic modulation ($\sim$1.7\,s) in burst activity during two distinct observational windows. We find that these two periodic activity epochs temporally coincide with the transitional states of the source's Faraday rotation measure (RM), and the chance coincidence is only about 0.07$\%$. This correlation is can be understood within the magnetar/Be-star binary system framework. Considering that only the polar cap region can remain stable for such an extended period, we apply a coherent linear periodic evolution model to jointly constrain the initial burst period \( P_0 \) and the period derivative \( \dot{P} \) across both observation windows (MJD 59310 and MJD 59347). We obtain spin parameters consistent with blind search results: an initial spin period $P_0 = 1.7060155$\,s at the reference time and spin period derivative $\dot{P} = 6.1393 \times 10^{-10}$\,s\,s$^{-1}$. We conclude that during these two observational windows, the magnetar was just crossing the disk of the Be star. The disk-magnetar interaction at these two geometric positions interaction may surpress the multi-polar magnetic fields at low latitudes of the magnetar, which enhances the dominance of the polar cap region emissions and makes the periodic activity detectable.

 - **Abstract**
 The recent detection of very high energy (VHE, $>$ 100 GeV) $\gamma$-ray emission from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) has provided new insights into afterglow physics. Understanding the temporal and spectral evolution of VHE GRBs requires detailed modelling of multiwavelength observations spanning radio to VHE $\gamma$ rays. Previous studies on afterglow emission of VHE GRBs were interpreted using a range of frameworks, including single- and multi-zone jet configurations, synchrotron radiation from forward and reverse shocks, synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) processes, as well as hadronic emission processes. We conducted a detailed multiwavelength modelling of five long-duration VHE GRBs - GRB 180720B, GRB 190114C, GRB 190829A, GRB 201216C and GRB 221009A; using the NAIMA code and modifications to it. The code deals with single-zone synchrotron radiation, SSC and external Compton (EC) radiation with complete Klein Nishina cross-section, extragalactic background light correction, and the Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. Our analysis constrains key parameters governing the emission and surrounding environments of these GRBs. The results indicate that SSC is the dominant VHE emission mechanism, with negligible contribution from EC. Most VHE GRBs are well described by the forward shock model in a spherical jet configuration, where constant density interstellar medium is preferred over wind medium. Additionally, we find that VHE GRBs tend to occur in environments with lower magnetic fields and higher ambient medium densities. Interestingly, VHE GRBs lie at the edge of the 3-$\sigma$ region of the $E_{\rm k,iso}$ - $\epsilon_B$ correlation observed in other energetic GRBs. Our model slightly over predicts the radio fluxes, indicating that a more complicated modelling might be required in some cases. These findings provide crucial constraints on VHE GRB emission sites and mechanisms (Abridged).
