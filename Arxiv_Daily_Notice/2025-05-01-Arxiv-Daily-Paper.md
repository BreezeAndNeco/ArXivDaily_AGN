 - **Abstract**
 In this study, colour-magnitude relations (CMRs) for DA-type white dwarfs in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) photometric system were investigated. For this purpose, the SDSS data for 20,247 white dwarf stars, as provided in the study by Anguiano et al. (2017), were matched with the Gaia third data release (Gaia DR3) catalogue to obtain trigonometric parallax ($\varpi$) data. The SDSS $ugriz$ magnitudes of the stars were corrected for interstellar extinction using dust maps provided for the Milky Way, and distances from the Sun to the stars were calculated. The SDSS magnitudes were thus corrected for the effects of interstellar extinction. For the calibration of the stars, 5,516 white dwarf stars were selected, with apparent magnitudes brighter than $g_0=21$ mag and relative parallax errors measured to better than $\sigma_\varpi/\varpi=0.1$. Subsequently, three separate CMRs were derived for the absolute magnitudes $M_{\rm g}$, $M_{\rm r}$, and $M_{\rm i}$, each calibrated to two-colour indices. The coefficient of determination ($R^2$) of the obtained CMRs are highly reliable in the bf range of 0.86 to 0.95. Moreover, the standard deviations of the differences between the absolute magnitudes obtained from the relations and the original ones of the calibration stars range from 0.26 to 0.37 mag.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a spectral stacking analysis of galaxies at $z\geq6$ observed with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We curate a sample of $64$ galaxies spanning redshifts $z_{\rm spec} = 6.0 - 9.4$ which have NIRSpec medium resolution data. The stacks achieve sufficient signal-to-noise to measure equivalent widths (EW) and velocity centroids ($v_{\rm{cen}}$) of low-ionization species (LIS) absorption features, transmitted Lyman-alpha ($\rm{Ly\alpha}$) emission, and nebular emission lines. Overall, we find our sample has weaker LIS absorption lines ($\rm{EW}(\rm{LIS}) \approx 1 Å$), smaller $v_{\rm{cen,LIS}} \approx -20 \pm 50~ \rm{km} \; \rm{s}^{-1}$, and significantly suppressed $\rm{Ly\alpha}$ emission ($\rm{EW}(\rm{Ly\alpha}) \approx 5~Å$), compared to similar studies undertaken at lower redshift. The weaker LIS absorption may suggest a lower covering fraction of HI and larger escape fraction of ionizing photons from our sample. Additionally, the smaller blueshifted $v_{\rm{cen,LIS}}$ indicates less prevalent or weaker outflows in $z>6$ galaxies. Stacking our sub-sample of $\rm{Ly\alpha}$ emitters (LAEs), we find high EW$(\rm{H}\beta) \approx 170 \pm 4~Å$ and a detection of nebular $\rm{C}\; \rm{IV}$ emission suggesting higher $\xi_{ion}$ in LAEs at $z>6$. This work showcases the enormous potential for stacked JWST spectra revealing properties of galaxies and their diffuse interstellar medium in the epoch of reionization.

 - **Abstract**
 The intergalactic medium (IGM) underwent intense heating that resulted in pressure disequilibrium in the wake of ionization fronts during cosmic reionization. The dynamical relaxation to restore pressure balance may have driven small-scale turbulence and, hence, the amplification of intergalactic magnetic fields. We investigate this possibility using a suite of $\approx 100$ pc resolution radiation-hydrodynamics simulations of IGM gas dynamics. We show that as the spatial resolution improves beyond that achieved with most prior studies, much of the IGM becomes turbulent unless it was pre-heated to $\gg 100~$K before reionization. In our most turbulent simulations, we find that the gas energy spectrum follows the expected $k^{-5/3}$ Kolmogorov scaling to the simulation's resolution, and the eddy turnover time of the turbulence is $< 1$ Gyr at $k \approx 1 ~$kpc$^{-1}$. Turbulence will grow magnetic fields, and we show that the fields grown by reionization-driven turbulence could explain lower limits on IGM B-field strengths from observations of TeV blazars.

 - **Abstract**
 Electromagnetic emissions from astrophysical sources at cosmological distances can be used to estimate the photon mass, $m_{\gamma}$. In this paper, we combine measurements of the dispersion measure ($\mathrm{DM}$) of fast radio bursts (FRB) with the luminosity distance from type Ia supernovae (SNe) to investigate update constraints on the photon rest mass. We derive the expression of $\mathrm{DM}$ dependence concerning a non-vanishing photon mass from a cosmological-model independent approach and constrain the parameter $m_{\gamma}$ from measurements of 68 well-localized FRBs and 1048 SNe data from the Pantheon compilation. We consider two scenarios for the baryon fraction in the intergalactic medium ($f_{\mathrm{IGM}}$): one where the value is fixed according to recent reports and another where it is treated as a free parameter, $f_{\mathrm{IGM}} = f_{\mathrm{IGM,0}}$. In the latter case, we find $m_{\gamma} = (29.4_{-15.5}^{+5.80}) \times 10^{-51}$ kg, at $1\sigma$ level. Our results also demonstrate an anticorrelation between $f_{\mathrm{IGM}}$ and $m_{\gamma}$, which highlights the importance of analyzing a larger sample of FRBs for a more comprehensive understanding of their properties.

 - **Abstract**
 Supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) at the centers of galaxies emit continuous gravitational waves (GWs) at nanohertz frequencies, and ongoing pulsar timing array (PTA) experiments aim to detect the first individual system. Identifying the exact host galaxy of a SMBHB detected in GWs is paramount for a variety of multi-messenger science cases, but it will be challenging due to the large number of candidate galaxies in the sky localization region. Here, we apply recent insights on the distinct characteristics of SMBHB host galaxies to archival galaxy datasets, to predict which nearby massive galaxies are most likely to host SMBHBs detectable by PTAs. Specifically, we use archival galaxy IFU surveys to search for nearby galaxies with distinct stellar kinematic signatures of SMBHB host galaxies, as informed by cosmological simulations. These distinct stellar kinematic signatures, including slow rotation and strong kinematic/photometric misalignments, are a hallmark of recent major galaxy mergers that led to the formation of SMBHBs in these galaxies. We produce a list of nearby massive galaxies that may currently host SMBHBs, ranked by a combination of their host galaxy stellar kinematic properties and their hypothetical GW strain. We discuss how our ranked list can be used (1) for targeted searches for individual sources of continuous GWs by PTAs, (2) to corroborate candidate SMBHBs identified through other approaches, and (3) to select candidate recoiling AGN and closely-separated (<100 pc) dual AGN for telescope follow-up confirmation.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel way to fit solar flare X-ray spectra that offers more sensitivity to physical flare parameters than traditional approaches to spectroscopy. We decouple physically distinct emission types in solar flare X-ray spectra using timing behaviors, a technique we call time-decomposed spectroscopy. By fitting the shapes of particular time series to others across a time interval, we extract X-ray emission of distinct physical origins before any forward modeling. We perform spectroscopy on the original and time-decomposed spectra and find good agreement, with physical reasons for the few disagreements. In general, the time decomposition technique provides more precise results than those of traditional spectroscopy. The thermal and nonthermal energies are better constrained by more than an order of magnitude using the time decomposition approach, relative to traditional spectroscopy. We explain mathematically how and why the technique works using the multifractal formalism, and show that fractality is one way to choose appropriate light curves for this analysis. We speculate about applications to different wavelengths for solar data analysis, as well as applications to other physics subfields and domains.

 - **Abstract**
 Using three-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations with electron and proton thermodynamics, we probe the inner radial and vertical structure of weakly magnetized geometrically thin accretion discs around rapidly spinning black holes. We find that the thin, cold disc transitions to a thick, hot accretion flow at a radius dependent on the mass accretion rate. At high accretion rates, the disc truncates close to the innermost stable circular orbit $r\approx2r_g$, demonstrating that even in the canonical thin disc model, the plunging region should be treated with two-temperature physics. At intermediate accretion rates, the transition radius moves outward by a factor of two to $r\approx 5r_g$, forming a radiatively inefficient inner flow. The simulations also reveal extended cooling along the surface of the disc out to $\sim10r_g$, with 40% of the total cooling at intermediate accretion rates occurring above the disc body. These results have implications for X-ray binary state transitions and the physical origin of the X-ray corona.
#### Reevaluating UMa3/U1: star cluster or the smallest known galaxy?

 - **Abstract**
 Ursa Major III/UNIONS 1 (UMa3/U1) is the faintest Milky Way satellite discovered to date, exhibiting a half-light radius of 3 $\pm$ 1 pc and an absolute V-band magnitude of +2.2 $\pm$ 0.4. Previous studies suggest UMa3/U1 is a dwarf galaxy, based on its large internal velocity dispersion and the improbability (indicated by dynamical cluster simulations) of its long-term survival if it were a dark-matter-free star cluster. In this paper, we model the evolution of UMa3/U1 as a star cluster using collisional N-body simulations that include a description of stellar evolution and the external tidal field of the Milky Way, with some simulations including primordial binaries. We find that UMa3/U1 has a substantial remaining lifetime of 2.7 $\pm$ 0.4 Gyr, primarily due to the retention of compact stellar remnants within the cluster. This retention is facilitated by mass segregation and the preferential loss of low-mass stars. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the observed large velocity dispersion of UMa3/U1 can be successfully reproduced. These results support the possibility that UMa3/U1 is a self-gravitating star cluster. Our simulations reveal that modelling UMa3/U1 as a dark matter free star cluster produces a markedly altered present-day mass function, driven by a strong depletion of low-mass stars. However, the degree of mass segregation among the visible stars is not statistically significant. We therefore recommend that future observations of UMa3/U1 and other very small Milky Way satellites focus on measuring their present-day mass functions to determine their nature.

 - **Abstract**
 Primordial power spectra with low power at long wavelengths can alleviate lensing anomaly. However the extent to which data favours such a primordial spectra is not clear. In this work, we investigate power suppression and related mitigation of lensing anomaly with the help of phenomenological models which are valid over scales of interest. We consider simple extensions to nearly scale invariant power spectra such as those which includes running and running of running of spectral index. We perform Bayesian analysis of these models, which are agnostic about power suppression, with various data sets and show that data tend to choose parameters which leads to power suppression at low multipoles. We then analyse the significance of these findings using information criteria. Further, we investigate the ability of near-ultimate future CMB missions such as ECHO to put tighter constraints on these models. We conclude that we can make stronger conclusions about the presence of power suppression in the future by studying such simple phenomenological models.

 This paper describes advances in solar magnetography and developments in instrumental techniques of polarimetry and spectroscopy made at Paris-Meudon observatory in the second half of the twentieth century. The adventure started from Lyot expertise and extended progressively to the measurement of vector magnetic fields using various and improving polarimetric techniques (such as beam exchange or grid) or new spectroscopic methods (such as the MSDP imaging slicer), at Meudon and Pic du Midi, ending by the achievement of the state-of-the-art optimized and polarization free telescope THEMIS in 1999.

 - **Abstract**
 Rapid uniformly-rotating neutron stars are expected to be formed for instance in the collapse of some massive stars, the accretion of some compact object binaries, and some double neutron star mergers. The huge amount of the rotational energy has been widely believed to be the source of some cosmic gamma-ray bursts and superluminous supernovae. Benefited from the tight constraints on the equation of state of the neutron star matter set by the latest multi-messenger data, the chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT) and perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD), here we present the maximum gravitational mass as well as the kinetic rotational energy for a neutron star at a given spin period. Our nonparametric EOS analysis reveals that the critical Keplerian configurations ($\Omega_{\rm kep}^{\rm crit}=1.00\pm0.07\times 10^{4}~ {\rm rad/s}$) can sustain maximum gravitational masses of $M_{\rm kep}^{\rm crit}=2.76^{+0.11}_{-0.09} M_\odot$ with corresponding rotational energy reaching $E_{\rm rot,kep}^{\rm crit}=2.38^{+0.25}_{-0.24}\times 10^{53}$. However, the maximum rotational energy that can be feasibly extracted from a neutron star is limited to $1.40^{+0.15}_{-0.13}\times 10^{53}$ erg, which holds for a baryon mass of $2.68^{+0.10}_{-0.09}M_\odot$. All these parameters, obtained via the nonparametric reconstruction of the equation of state, are at the $68.3\%$ confidence level and the adoption of a quarkonic model yields rather similar results. These findings are found to have already set some intriguing constraints on the millisecond magnetar interpretation of some exciting data.

 - **Abstract**
 Coronal heating has puzzled solar physicists for decades. The question of why the Sun's upper atmosphere is significantly hotter than its lower atmosphere remains a key mystery. It is commonly believed that the source of coronal heating comes from the Sun's magnetic field, and more complex magnetic dynamics is more efficient in heating. In an earlier work we studied the secondary (or finer-scale) flux emergence identified in five ephemeral regions (ERs), selected during the last solar minimum (Yang et al. 2024). Here we further explore the atmospheric response to the secondary flux emergences (SFEs) that were identified in the first paper. We further reveal that approximately 80 percent of the 172 identified SFEs are associated with atmospheric heating events. The heating is most likely associated with magnetic reconnection involved in the SFE. Overall, a solar quiet region is heated by several hundred thousand degrees, during flux emergence of an ER.
#### Collisions with tidal disruption event disks: implications for quasi-periodic X-ray eruptions

 - **Abstract**
 A popular class of models for interpreting quasi-periodic X-ray eruptions from galactic nuclei (QPEs) invoke collisions between an object on an extreme mass ratio inspiral (EMRI) and an accretion disk around a supermassive black hole. There are strong links between QPE systems and those disks which formed following a tidal disruption event (TDE), and at least two events (AT2019qiz and AT2022upj) are known to have occurred following an otherwise typical TDE. We show that the fact that these disks were formed following a TDE strongly constrains their properties, more so than previous models have assumed. Models based on steady-state AGN-like disks have mass contents which grow strongly with size $M_{\rm disk}\propto R_{\rm out}^{7/2}$ and do not conserve the mass or angular momentum of the disrupted star. A very different scaling must be satisfied by a TDE disk in order to conserve the disrupted stars angular momentum, $M_{\rm disk} \propto R_{\rm out}^{-1/2}$. These constraints substantially change the predicted scaling relationships between QPE observables (luminosity, duration, energy, temperature) and the QPE period. They also allow QPE observables to be written in terms of the properties of the two stars assumed to be involved (the one tidally disrupted and the one on an EMRI), making plausibility tests of these models possible. We show that these modifications to the disk structure imply that (i) QPEs cannot be powered by collisions between an orbiting black hole and a TDE disk, (ii) QPEs also cannot be powered by collisions between the surface of a stellar EMRI and a TDE disk. A framework in which the collisions are between a TDE disk and a star which has puffed up to fill its Hills sphere with a trailing debris stream (as seen in recent simulations) cannot be ruled out from the data, and should be the focus of further study.
#### Rapid Spectral Evolution of SGR 1935+2154 During its 2022 Outburst

 - **Abstract**
 During the 2022 outburst of SGR 1935+2154, a Fast-Radio-Burst-like event (FRB 20221014A) and X-ray activities occurred between two spin-up glitches, suggesting these glitches may connect to multiwavelength phenomenology. However, the mechanisms altering the magnetar's magnetosphere to enable radio emission remain unclear. This study presents high-cadence NICER and NuSTAR observations revealing spectral changes in burst and persistent emission. Hardness ratio and spectral analysis reveal significant changes during an "intermediate flare" 2.5 hours before FRB 20221014A. This 80-second flare, releasing $>(6.3\pm0.2)\times10^{40}$ erg, coincides with a rapid spectral softening in both burst and persistent emission and a notable decrease in burst occurrence rate. The intermediate flare is bright enough to be detected if placed at a few Mpc, and would appear as a fast X-ray transient. This implies that the connection between magnetar X-ray activity and FRBs can be observed in the local Universe. Post-flare burst spectra peak near 5 keV, resembling the characteristics of the FRB-associated X-ray burst of 2020. Such change persisted for a few hours, implying magnetospheric evolution on similar timescales. However, no radio emission was detected from post-flare bursts, suggesting that FRB emission requires conditions beyond peculiar short bursts. The burst waiting times exhibit a broken power-law distribution, likely resulting from contamination by enhanced persistent emission. Although the bursts appear randomly distributed in the spin phase, the hardness ratio profile as a function of spin phase follows that of the persistent emission, indicating that X-ray bursts originate at low altitudes.

 - **Abstract**
 Intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) are a missing link in black hole demographics, with only tentative observational evidence to date. Dense stellar clusters such as IRS 13E near the Galactic Center are promising IMBH hosts, where accretion is likely driven by winds from nearby Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. Yet, the dynamics of such wind-fed systems remain largely unexplored. We investigate how high-velocity stellar winds, magnetic fields, and metallicity-dependent radiative cooling influence gas dynamics and black hole accretion in compact WR clusters. Using three-dimensional (magneto)hydrodynamic simulations, we model each WR star as a source of mass, momentum, energy, and magnetic flux, and include a cooling function that depends on chemical abundance. We compare isotropic versus disk-like stellar distributions to explore the impact of cluster geometry. Across all models, we find that the accretion rate onto the IMBH is suppressed by up to five orders of magnitude relative to the total stellar mass-loss rate. Turbulent, shock-heated outflows driven by wind-wind collisions dominate the flow, expelling most injected gas. While enhanced cooling in high-metallicity runs promotes the formation of dense clumps, these structures are typically unable to reach the black hole. The system's integrated X-ray luminosity is dominated by colliding WR winds, masking the IMBH's radiative signature. Accretion occurs in short-lived, quasi-periodic episodes triggered by close stellar passages, but even these flares remain difficult to detect against the luminous wind background. Our results naturally explain the low detectability of IMBHs in compact WR clusters and provide theoretical predictions to guide future X-ray and infrared observational strategies.
#### The case of AT2022wtn: a Tidal Disruption Event in an interacting galaxy

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results from our multi-wavelength monitoring campaign of the transient AT2022wtn, discovered by the Zwicky Transient Facility in the nucleus of SDSSJ232323.79+104107.7, the less massive galaxy in an active merging pair with a mass ratio of ~10:1. AT2022wtn shows spectroscopic and photometric properties consistent with a X-ray faint N-strong TDE-H+He with a number of peculiarities. Specifically, a 30-days long plateau at maximum luminosity, a corresponding dip in temperature and the development of a double-horned N III+ He II line profile. Strong and time-evolving velocity offsets in the TDE broad emission lines and the detection of a transient radio emission, indicate the presence of outflows. Overall, the observed properties are consistent with the full disruption of a low-mass star by a ~10$^{6}$ M$_{\odot}$ SMBH followed by an efficient disk formation and the launch of a quasi-spherical reprocessing envelope of fast expanding outflowing material. The observed differences between the He II and the Hydrogen and N III lines can be explained either with a spatial separation of the lines emitting region or with a late-time reveal of shocks from the returning debris streams, as the photosphere recedes. Finally, we present an extensive analysis of the hosting environment and discuss the implications for the discovery of two TDEs in interacting galaxy pairs, finding indication for an over-representation of TDEs in these systems. The AT2022wtn host galaxy properties suggest that it is in the early stages of the merger, therefore we may be witnessing the initial enhanced rate of TDEs in interacting galaxies before the post-starburst phase.

 - **Abstract**
 The search for robust evidence of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) is crucial for understanding black hole seeding process and the formation of supermassive black holes in the early Universe. NGC 4395 and POX 52 are two prototypical IMBH hosts, both exhibiting multi-line evidence of low-mass black hole activity. Here, we report the first detection of mid-infrared (MIR) lags in response to optical variability, with measurements of $3.0^{+2.4}_{-1.9}$ days for NGC 4395 and $35.2^{+14.2}_{-11.7}$ days for POX~52 at $3.4$ $\mu$m, respectively, using archival optical data and observations from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). This detection provides the first reverberation evidence of low-mass black hole activity in POX 52. The time lags of these two low-mass, low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) generally follow the extent of the $R_{\rm dust}-L_{\rm 5100}$ relation found in higher-mass AGNs. Based on an empirical relation between the broad-line region and dusty torus size, we constrain the black hole mass of POX 52 to log($M_{\rm BH}$/$M_\odot$) = 5.5 $\pm$ 0.37 (systemic and statistical errors), confirming its IMBH nature. Furthermore, long-term optical continuum monitoring of POX 52 reveals a mild inter-band lag of $\lesssim$ 1 day. However, no significant intranight variability was detected during its one-night, high-cadence monitoring, which we attribute to the longer duty cycle of fast variability in POX 52 compared to that in NGC 4395.

 Using very long baseline interferometry, the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration has resolved the shadows of two supermassive black holes. Model comparison is traditionally performed in image space, where imaging algorithms introduce uncertainties in the recovered structure. Here, we develop a deep learning framework to perform parameter inference in visibility space, directly using the data measured by the interferometer without introducing potential errors and biases from image reconstruction. First, we train and validate our framework on synthetic data derived from general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) simulations that vary in magnetic field state, spin, and $R_\mathrm{high}$. Applying these models to the real data obtained during the 2017 EHT campaign, and only considering total intensity, we do not derive meaningful constraints on either of these parameters. At present, our method is limited both by theoretical uncertainties in the GRMHD simulations and variation between snapshots of the same underlying physical model. However, we demonstrate that spin and $R_\mathrm{high}$ could be recovered using this framework through continuous monitoring of our sources, which mitigates variations due to turbulence. In future work, we anticipate that including spectral or polarimetric information will greatly improve the performance of this framework.

 - **Abstract**
 Sub-solar mass black holes could show up in gravitational observations in future and near-solar mass black holes might have been involved in the events GW190425 and GW190814. Since they cannot form from the stellar evolution, their creation requires exotic mechanisms. One such mechanism involves the capture of dark matter particles by stellar objects and their thermalization. When the criterion for the collapse of these dark matter particles is satisfied, a tiny endoparasitic black hole (EBH) forms and then it accretes matter from the host. The EBH may transmute the host into a black hole of nearly the same mass as the host or lesser, depending on the type of accretion. We examine this complex and poorly explored accretion mechanism, considering the effects of rotation and viscosity but ignoring some other effects, such as those of pressure and magnetic field, as the first step. Using a general framework to assess the effects of rotation and viscosity on accretion, we show that the accretion could be stalled in some white dwarfs, but not in neutron stars. The stalled accretion should cause an opening in the host's polar regions, the extent of which depends on the mass and spin of the host.

 - **Abstract**
 We present StarryStarryProcess, a novel hierarchical Bayesian framework for mapping stellar surfaces using exoplanet transit light curves. While previous methods relied solely on stellar rotational light curves--which contain limited information about spot properties -- our approach leverages planetary transits as probes of stellar surfaces. When a planet crosses a spot during transit, it creates a distinctive change in the light curve that directly reveals spot properties. Our model integrates planetary transit modeling with stellar variability analysis by combining the spherical harmonic surface map representation from starry, the probabilistic approach to spot properties of StarryProcess, and a comprehensive transit model that accounts for spot-crossing events during transits. We demonstrate through synthetic data experiments that our model successfully recovers spot distributions, stellar orientation, and spot physical properties. We extend the framework to handle evolving stellar surfaces through time-dependent modeling. Applying our method to TESS observations of TOI-3884, we find evidence for high-latitude spot concentrations and significant spin-orbit misalignment. The transit-based approach overcomes fundamental limitations of previous models by providing constraints on spot properties that would remain hidden in the null space of rotational light curves alone. This methodology enables more accurate exoplanet characterization by disentangling stellar activity due to starspots from planetary signals while simultaneously providing insights into stellar magnetic activity patterns.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Fine-scale structures of the solar chromosphere, particularly fibrils, are known to host various types of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves that can transport energy to the corona. In particular, absorption features observed in the H{\alpha} channel have been widely detected that exhibit transverse oscillations. Aims. We aimed to detect a high-frequency transverse oscillation in fibrils. Methods. We conducted a case study on a high-frequency transverse oscillation in a chromospheric fibril. A chromospheric fibril was observed on 24 August 2018, in the H{\alpha} spectral line, with the prototype Microlensed Hyperspectral Imager (MiHI) at the Swedish 1- meter Solar Telescope. The MiHI instrument is an integral field spectrograph capable of achieving ultra-high resolution simultaneously in the spatial, temporal, and spectral domains. Results. The detected oscillation characteristics include a period of 15 s and a displacement amplitude of 42 km. Using the bisector method, we derived Doppler velocities and determined that the polarisation of the oscillation was elliptical. Conclusions. The energy contained in the oscillation ranges from 390 to 2300 W/m2, which is not sufficient to balance radiative losses of the chromosphere.
