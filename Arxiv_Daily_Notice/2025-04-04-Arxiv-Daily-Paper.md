#### In-situ vs. ex-situ drivers of galaxy quenching: ubiquity of main sequence and critical black hole mass from the FLAMINGO simulation

 - **Abstract**
 Exploiting a large sample of 5.3 million galaxies with $M_\ast\,{=}\,10^{10-11}\,{\rm M}_\odot$ from the highest-resolution FLAMINGO simulation, we carry out a statistical analysis of quiescent and star-forming galaxies to explore quenching mechanisms. From redshift $z\,{\simeq}\,7$ to 0, we find that the median star-formation rate of main-sequence galaxies is independent of the environment and of whether a galaxy is a central or satellite, whereas the fraction of quiescent galaxies is highly sensitive to both. By employing Random Forest (RF) classifiers, we demonstrate that black hole (BH) feedback is the most responsible quenching mechanism for both centrals and satellites, while halo mass is the second most significant. For satellites, a notable importance given by RF to stellar mass implies in-situ pre-quenching rather than ex-situ preprocessing prior to infall to the current host halo. In the cosmic afternoon of $z\,{=}\,$0--1, we identify two distinct regimes of evolution: at $M_{\rm BH}\,{\gtrsim}\,10^7\,{\rm M}_\odot$, essentially all galaxies are quenched regardless of their environment; at $M_{\rm BH}\,{\lesssim}\,10^7\,{\rm M}_\odot$, quenching is determined mainly by halo mass. Galaxies undergo a sharp transition from the main sequence to quiescence once their BH mass reaches $M_{\rm BH}\,{\simeq}\,10^7\,{\rm M}_\odot$ (typically when $M_\ast\,{\simeq}\,10^{10.5}\,{\rm M}_\odot$ and $M_{\rm h}\,{\simeq}\,10^{12}\,{\rm M}_\odot$) with a short quenching timescale of ${<}$1 Gyr. This transition is driven by a sudden change in the gas mass in the inner circum-galactic medium. Our results indicate that galaxy quenching arises from a combination of in-situ and ex-situ physical processes.

 - **Abstract**
 There has been growing evidence that the rich star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds contain significant fractions of rapidly rotating stars. In this work, we aim to constrain these fractions by studying the colour-magnitude diagrams of four star clusters, selected among those with the most striking signatures of fast rotators. Using isochrones derived from PARSEC v2.0 stellar tracks, we generate distinct stellar populations, each covering a limited interval of initial rotation rates $\omega_\mathrm{i}$, referred to as 'Partial Models' (PMs). Using optimization algorithms and Monte Carlo Markov Chains, PMs are combined to create the final best-fitting model. In our analysis, we adopt two key assumptions: a uniform age and an isotropic distribution of stellar spin axes within each cluster. The solutions are allowed to explore the entire range of $\omega_\mathrm{i}$, and different values of age, metallicity, distance and foreground extinction. We find that the rotational velocity distributions in all four clusters reveal a high fraction of stars with $\omega_\mathrm{i}$ close to the break-up value, in all cases. Specifically, the fraction of stars with $\omega_\mathrm{i}>0.7$ exceeds $80\%$ in the clusters NGC 419 of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) and NGC 1831 and NGC 1866 of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). For NGC 2203 of the LMC, this fraction is smaller, although it still exceeds $50\%$, confirming that also this cluster is mainly populated by fast-rotating stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Binary stars are gravitationally bound stellar systems where the evolution of each component can significantly influence the evolution of its companion and the system as a whole. In certain cases, the evolution of these systems can lead to the formation of a red giant-white dwarf system, which may exhibit symbiotic characteristics. The primary goal of this work is to contribute in a statistical way to the estimation of the symbiotic system (SySt) population in the Milky Way and in the dwarf galaxies of the Local Group (LG). Additionally, we aim to infer the maximum contribution of SySt to Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) events. Given the significant discrepancies in previous estimates, we propose two distinct approaches to constrain the expected SySt population: one empirical and another theoretical. These approaches are designed to provide a robust estimation of the SySt population. For the Milky Way, we utilized position and velocity data of known SySts to determine their distribution. Based on these properties, we constrained the lower limit for the Galactic SySt population in the range of 800--4,100. Our theoretical approach, which relies on the properties of zero-age main-sequence binaries and known binary evolutionary paths, suggests a SySt population of $(53\pm6)\times10^3$ SySt in the Galaxy. The statistical SySt populations for LG dwarf galaxies are one to four orders of magnitude lower, primarily dependent on the galaxies' bolometric luminosity and, to a lesser extent, their binary fraction and metallicity. In this work, the contribution of the single-degenerate channel of SNe Ia from symbiotic progenitors is estimated to be of the order of 1\% for the Galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 In the first three papers of this series, we investigated the formation of photospheric neutral iron lines in different atmospheres ranging from idealised flux tube models to complex three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (3D MHD) simulations. The overarching goal was to understand the role of Non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (NLTE) and horizontal radiative transfer (RT) effects in the formation of these lines. In the present paper, we extend this investigation using a high resolution MHD simulation, with a grid spacing much smaller than the currently resolvable scales by telescopes. We aim to understand whether the horizontal RT effects imposes an intrinsic limit on the small scale structures that can be observed by telescopes, by spatially smearing out these structures in the solar atmosphere. We synthesize the Stokes profiles of two iron line pairs, one at 525 nm and other at 630 nm in 3-D NLTE. We compare our results with those in previous papers and check the impact of horizontal transfer on the quality of the images. Our results with the high resolution simulations align with those inferred from lower resolution simulations in the previous papers of this series. The spatial smearing due to horizontal RT, although present, is quite small. The degradation caused by the point spread function of a telescope is much stronger. In the photospheric layers, we do not see an image degradation caused by horizontal RT that is large enough to smear out the small scale structures in the simulation box. The current generation telescopes with spatial resolutions smaller than the horizontal photon mean free path should in principle be able to observe the small scale structures, at least in the photosphere.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Dust grains are key components of the interstellar medium and play a central role in star formation, acting as catalysts for chemical reactions and as building blocks of planets. Extinction curves are essential for characterizing dust properties, but mid-infrared (MIR) extinction remains poorly constrained in protostellar environments. Gas-phase line ratios from embedded protostellar jets provide a spatially resolved method for probing extinction through protostellar envelopes, complementing background starlight approaches. Aims: We aim to derive MIR extinction curves along sightlines toward a protostellar jet embedded in an envelope and assess whether they differ from those in dense molecular clouds. Methods: We analyze JWST NIRSpec IFU and MIRI MRS observations of four positions along the blue-shifted TMC1A jet. We extract observed [Fe II] line intensities and model intrinsic ratios using the Cloudy spectral synthesis code across a range of electron densities and temperatures. By comparing observed near-IR (NIR) and MIR line ratios to Cloudy predictions, we infer the relative extinction between NIR and MIR wavelengths. Results: Electron densities (ne) derived from NIR [Fe II] lines range from ~5 x 10^4 to ~5 x 10^3 cm^-3 at scales <~350 AU. MIR extinction values show stronger reddening than the empirical dark cloud curve from McClure (2009) at similar ne and temperatures (~10^3 to 10^4 K). If MIR emission arises from cooler, lower-density gas, extinction curves remain consistent with background starlight measurements. Conclusions: This method enables spatially resolved MIR extinction curves in embedded protostellar systems. Results suggest either a change in dust size distribution (e.g., from grain growth) or that MIR emission originates from cooler, less dense regions than NIR emission. (Abstract shortened for arXiv.

 - **Abstract**
 Here, we present several examples of unusual evolutionary patterns in solar coronal loops that resemble cross-field drift motions. These loops were simultaneously observed from two vantage points by two different spacecraft: the High-Resolution Imager (HRI$_{EUV}$) of the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager aboard the Solar Orbiter and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) aboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory. Across all these events, a recurring pattern is observed: Initially, a thin, strand-like structure detaches and shifts several megameters (Mm) away from a main or parent loop. During this period, the parent loop remains intact in its original position. After a few minutes, the shifted strand reverses its direction and returns to the location of the parent loop. Key features of this `split-drift' type evolution are: (i) the presence of kink oscillations in the loops before and after the split events, (ii) a sudden split motion at about 30~km.s$^{-1}$, with additional slow drifts, either away from or back to the parent loops, at around 5~km.s$^{-1}$. Co-temporal photospheric magnetic field data obtained from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) reveal that during such split-drift evolution, one of the loop points in the photosphere moves back and forth between nearby magnetic polarities. While the exact cause of this `split-drift' phenomenon is still unclear, the consistent patterns observed in its characteristics indicate that there may be a broader physical mechanism at play. This underscores the need for further investigation through both observational studies and numerical simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 Energetic bursts from strongly magnetized neutron stars, known as magnetars, are typically detected in clusters. Once an active episode begins, anywhere from a few to thousands of hard X-ray bursts can occur over durations ranging from days to months. The temporal clustering of these recurrent bursts during an active episode suggests an underlying mechanism that triggers multiple bursts in rapid succession. These burst clusters are likely crucial for understanding the processes driving magnetar activity. In this study, we investigate the repetitive short X-ray burst behavior of magnetars through crustal interactions, employing the cellular automaton model for the magnetar crust proposed by Lander (2023). Our simulations, based on physically motivated criteria, successfully reproduce burst clustering. Additionally, the durations and energetics of active episodes in our simulations agree well with observational data. We discuss the potential physical mechanisms underlying burst clusters observed in numerous magnetars, as well as the reactivations of an individual magnetar.

 - **Abstract**
 Pulsar halos are regions around middle-aged pulsars extending out to tens of parsecs. The large extent of the halos and well-defined central cosmic-ray accelerators make this new class of Galactic sources an ideal laboratory for studying cosmic-ray transport. LHAASO J0621+3755 is a candidate pulsar halo associated with the middle-aged gamma-ray pulsar PSR J0622+3749. We observed LHAASO J0621+3755 with VERITAS and XMM-Newton in the TeV and X-ray bands, respectively. For this work, we developed a novel background estimation technique for imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope observations of such extended sources. No halo emission was detected with VERITAS (0.3--10 TeV) or XMM-Newton (2--7 keV) within 1 degree and 10 arcmin around PSR J0622+3749, respectively. Combined with the LHAASO-KM2A and Fermi-LAT data, VERITAS flux upper limits establish a spectral break at ~1--10 TeV, a unique feature compared with Geminga, the most studied pulsar halo. We model the gamma-ray spectrum and LHAASO-KM2A surface brightness as inverse Compton emission and find suppressed diffusion around the pulsar, similar to Geminga. A smaller diffusion suppression zone and harder electron injection spectrum than Geminga are necessary to reproduce the spectral cutoff. A magnetic field <= 1 uG is required by our XMM-Newton observation and synchrotron spectral modeling, consistent with Geminga. Our findings support slower diffusion and lower magnetic field around pulsar halos than the Galactic averages, hinting at magnetohydrodynamic turbulence around pulsars. Additionally, we report the detection of an X-ray point source spatially coincident with PSR J0622+3749, whose periodicity is consistent with the gamma-ray spin period of 333.2 ms. The soft spectrum of this source suggests a thermal origin.

 - **Abstract**
 We conducted targeted fast radio burst (FRB) and pulsar searches on eight pulsing ultraluminous X-ray sources (PULXs) using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST) and the Parkes 64-meter Radio Telescope (Murriyang) to investigate whether PULXs could be progenitors of FRBs. FAST carried out 12 observations of four PULXs, totaling 8 hours, while Parkes conducted 12 observations of the remaining four PULXs, totaling 11 hours. No significant signals were detected through single-pulse and periodic searches, covering a dispersion measure (DM) range of 0-5000 pc cm$^{-3}$, placing stringent upper limits on the radio flux density from these sources. The results imply that accretion processes and dense stellar winds in PULXs likely suppress or attenuate potential coherent emission in radio band. Additionally, the beaming factor and luminosity of FRBs associated with PULXs, as well as the highly relativistic and magnetized nature of their outflows, may limit detectability. Non-detection yielded from the observations covering the full orbital phases of PULXs can also constrain the theoretical models that link FRB emission to highly magnetized neutron stars in binary systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Self-interacting dark matter (SIDM), through gravothermal evolution driven by elastic self-scatterings, offers a compelling explanation for the observed diversity of inner halo densities. In this work, we investigate SIDM dynamics in a two-component dark matter model with mass ratios of order unity, motivated by an asymmetric dark matter framework that naturally evades constraints from relic abundance and mediator decay, while enabling strong, velocity-dependent self-interactions. We show that cross-component scatterings significantly enhance mass segregation, driving the formation of dense, core collapsed-like halos. This effect couples naturally to SIDM-induced diversity, introducing a new mechanism for generating structural variations beyond those arising from gravothermal evolution alone. Our results reveal a novel mechanism for reconciling SIDM with small-scale observational tensions by enabling shifts in central densities while preserving the flexibility to generate diverse halo structures. We further highlight that halo structural diversity may serve as a diagnostic of dark sector composition, opening a new observational window into the particle nature of SIDM.

 - **Abstract**
 Accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) regulate the evolution of their host galaxies through powerful outflows and multi-phase feedback. This process plays a crucial role in shaping SMBH-galaxy co-evolution across cosmic time, but direct evidence linking nuclear winds to large-scale cold gas outflows, particularly in high-redshift quasars, has remained elusive. Here we present statistical evidence of a connection between nuclear winds and large-scale cold gas outflows in quasars at $z \sim 5.5$. Using stacked [C II] 158 $\mu$m emission profiles from ALMA observations, which trace galactic-scale neutral gas, we compare broad absorption line (BAL) quasars -- tracing parsec- to sub-kiloparsec-scale nuclear winds -- with non-BAL quasars. The BAL stack reveals a significant (S/N=4.45) broad component in the [C II] emission, indicating high-velocity neutral gas outflows with a velocity offset of $\Delta v_{\rm b} = -2.1 \times 10^2 \, \rm km\,s^{-1}$ and a full width at half maximum of $1.18 \times 10^3 \, \rm km\,s^{-1}$, while the non-BAL stack shows no such feature. We estimate that a few percent up to one-quarter of the BAL wind energy is transferred to neutral gas on kiloparsec scales. These findings provide direct observational evidence that nuclear winds couple with galactic-scale neutral gas flows, supporting multi-phase AGN feedback models. This mechanism may contribute to explaining the diversity of $M_{\rm BH}/M_*$ ratios observed in some luminous AGN recently observed by JWST, compared to the Magorrian relation.

 We present FluxCT V2.0, an updated web tool for identifying contaminating flux in Kepler and TESS target pixel files. FluxCT V2.0 focuses on enhancing functionality, user experience, and data processing capabilities. We resolved existing issues to allow for an extended user base, removed known bugs, and extended the tool to any TESS pixel file, allowing the user to search any TESS point object. A batch code for TESS is now available on the companion GitHub. Additional output parameters, such as amplitude dilution and a magnitude cut, have been added to the tool, allowing users more freedom to analyze the possible effects of target sources.

 - **Abstract**
 An analytical cancellation nanoflare model has recently been established to show the fundamental role that ubiquitous small-scale cancellation nanoflares play in solar atmospheric heating. Although this model is well-supported by simulations, observational evidence is needed to deepen our understanding of cancellation nanoflares. We present observations of a small-scale cancellation nanoflare event, analyzing its magnetic topology evolution, triggers, and physical parameters. Using coordinated observations from Solar Dynamics Observatory and Goode Solar Telescope, we identify a photospheric flow-driven cancellation event with a flux cancellation rate of ~10^{15} Mx/s and a heating rate of 8.7 x 10^6 erg cm^{-2} s^{-1}. The event shows the characteristic transition from $\pi$-shaped to X-shaped magnetic configuration before forming a two arcsecs current sheet, closely matching model predictions. This event provides critical observational support for the cancellation nanoflare model and its role in solar atmospheric heating.
#### Size and shape of the trans-Neptunian object (470316) 2007 OC10: Comparison with thermal data

 - **Abstract**
 The shapes of only 12 trans-Neptunian objects have been directly measured, offering crucial insights into their internal structure. These properties are strongly connected to the processes that shaped the early Solar System, and provide important clues about its evolution. The aim of the present work is to characterise the size, shape, geometric albedo, and beaming parameter of the TNO (470316) 2007 OC10 . We compared these values to the effective diameter and geometric albedo obtained from thermal data by the TNOs are Cool survey. We also combined occultation and thermal data to constrain the size of a putative unresolved satellite. We predicted an occultation of the star Gaia DR3 2727866328215869952 by 2007 OC10 on 2022 August 22. Four stations detected the occultation. We implemented an elliptical shape model for the projection of 2007 OC10. Following a Bayesian approach, we obtained the posterior probability density in the model parameter space using a Markov chain Monte Carlo method. The elliptical limb of 2007 OC10 has semi-axes of $ 215^{+10}_{-7} \times 141 ^{+24}_{-23}$ km, and thus the projected axis ratio is $b/a = 0.58^{+0.16}_{-0.16}$. The area-equivalent diameter is $330^{+56}_{-55}$,km. From our own absolute magnitude value of $H_V = 5.40 \pm 0.02$, the geometric albedo is $p_V = 11.2 ^{+2.1}_{-5.0}$ %. Combining the occultation results with thermal data, we constrain the beaming parameter to $\eta = 1.42^{+0.75}_{-0.58}$. Occultation data reveal that the star is double. The secondary star has a position angle with respect to the primary of $56^{+3}_{-17}$ degrees, has an angular separation of $57^{+4}_{-11}$ mas, and is $1.18^{+0.07}_{-0.07}$ magnitudes fainter than the primary.

 - **Abstract**
 Type II radio bursts are the indicator of adverse space weather in a stellar system. These radio bursts are the consequence of shock wave acceleration due to the coronal mass ejection (CME). Here, we perform a series of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of a CME-driven star-planet system in order to investigate the modulation in radio burst mechanism by a close-in exoplanetary system. We use a model for the stellar wind with a close-in exoplanet, and a CME model based on the eruption of a flux rope. We are able to generate synthetic radio burst images from our MHD simulations. We find that radio burst like phenomena is most likely to be observed for moderately active solar like stars and close-in exoplanetary systems have significant influence on the nature of radio burst spectrum. We find that when the planetary field is not too strong, the planetary magnetosphere is pushing against the CME, increasing its density so the radio burst is visible at higher frequencies. When the planetary field is very strong, the large magnetosphere does not leave room for the CME shock to evolve so the radio burst is more visible in the lower frequencies associated with the weak compression at the flanks of the CME shock. In case of highly active solar-like stars, strong overlying stellar fields weakens the solar-like CME shock, thus generates very weak (almost non-visible) radio burst signals. For HD 189733 (moderate stellar field), only intensity difference is visible when the CME arrives the planet. We also do not find significant modulation in the radio emission by a close-in exoplanet system when the stellar magnetic field is complex. In summary, our result suggests that the nature of the radio burst spectrum is highly dependent on the topology of the stellar magnetic field and the close-in exoplanetary magnetic field strength.

 - **Abstract**
 The generation of merger shocks is a natural outcome of the hierarchical process of structure formation. As time elapses cosmic structures grow in mass and size via mergers and through the continuous accretion of material onto the potential wells of dark matter haloes. In particular, some dynamically-perturbed galaxy clusters exhibit spectacular non-thermal radio features known as radio relics that are believed to trace cluster merger shocks at different stages of evolution. These radio shocks are thought to be illuminated by the acceleration of cosmic ray electrons in the presence of intracluster magnetic fields. In this contribution, we analyse a large sample of hydrodynamical, cosmological re-simulations of merging galaxy clusters belonging to The Three Hundred Project to study the median evolution of radio relics as a function of cluster mass and redshift. This synthetic cluster merger sample enables us to compute in detail the luminosity output of radio shocks from their onset at core passage to demise.

 - **Abstract**
 GRB 170519A was discovered by \emph{Swift}/BAT, and then observed by \emph{Swift}/XRT, \emph{Swift}/UVOT, and ground-based telescopes. We report Lick/KAIT observations of GRB 170519A, and make temporal analysis and spectral joint fits of its multiwavelength light curves. The observations present a relatively complete afterglow structure, including two X-ray flares (Flares I and II), optical onset (Slice 1), normal decay (Slices 2 and 3), and a possible jet break. The spectrum of the bright X-ray flare (Flare II) indicates that a thermal component exists at $t = 190$--240~s. \textbf{The blackbody emits in the photospheric radius $R_{\rm ph}\sim 10^{11}$ cm,} and its temperature ($kT$) decreases with time from \textbf{1.08 to 0.37 keV, its Lorentz factor of blackbody ($\Gamma_{\rm BB}$) decreases with time from 67.71 to 46.70. The luminosity of the blackbody ($L_{\rm BB}$), $kT$ and $\Gamma_{\rm BB}$ follow the relations $\bf L_{\rm BB} \propto kT^{2.49\pm 0.03}$ and $\Gamma_{\rm BB}\propto L_{\rm BB}^{0.27}$ (estimated from \cite{fan2012}).} In the optical light curves, there is an onset bump in the early-time afterglow, rising with an index $\alpha_{O,1} \approx -0.43$ and peaking $\sim1174.9$ s since the BAT trigger. The bump then decays with $\bf \alpha_{O,2} \approx 0.88$ in the normal decay phase, and the X-ray flux decays with a similar index of $\bf \alpha_{X,1} \approx 0.95$. There is no obvious spectral evolution in the normal decay phases, with photon index $\hat{\Gamma} = 1.86$ and 1.92 in Slices 2 and 3, respectively. We find that the multiwavelength light curves of the GRB 170519A afterglow can be well fitted by an external shock with time-dependent $\epsilon_B$. In the early afterglow, the value of $\epsilon_B$ decays rapidly from $\bf 4.29\times10^{-2}$ to $\bf 8.23\times10^{-3}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic rays (CR), both solar and Galactic, have an ionising effect on the Earth's atmosphere and are thought to be important for prebiotic molecule production. In particular, the $\rm{H_2}$-dominated atmosphere following an ocean-vaporising impact is considered favourable to prebiotic molecule formation. We model solar and Galactic CR transport through a post-impact early Earth atmosphere at 200Myr. We aim to identify the differences in the resulting ionisation rates, $\zeta$, particularly at the Earth's surface during a period when the Sun was very active. We use a Monte Carlo model to describe CR transport through the early Earth atmosphere, giving the CR spectra as a function of altitude. We calculate $\zeta$ and the ion-pair production rate, $Q$, as a function of altitude due to Galactic and solar CR. The Galactic and solar CR spectra are both affected by the Sun's rotation rate, $\Omega$, because the solar wind velocity and magnetic field strength both depend on $\Omega$ and influence CR transport. We consider a range of input spectra resulting from the range of possible $\Omega$, from $3.5-15\, \Omega_{\rm{\odot}}$. To account for the possibility that the Galactic CR spectrum outside the Solar System varies over Gyr timescales, we compare top-of-atmosphere $\zeta$ resulting from two different scenarios. We also consider the suppression of the CR spectra by a planetary magnetic field. We find that $\zeta$ and $Q$ due to CR are dominated by solar CR in the early Earth atmosphere for most cases. The corresponding $\zeta$ at the early Earth's surface ranges from $5 \times 10^{-21}\rm{s^{-1}}$ for $\Omega = 3.5\,\Omega_{\rm{\odot}}$ to $1 \times 10^{-16}\rm{s^{-1}}$ for $\Omega = 15\,\Omega_{\rm{\odot}}$. Thus if the young Sun was a fast rotator, it is likely that solar CR had a significant effect on the chemistry at the Earth's surface at the time when life is likely to have formed.

 - **Abstract**
 Spectropolarimetric techniques are a mainstay of astrophysical inquiry, ranging from Solar System objects to the Cosmic Background Radiation. This review highlights applications of stellar polarimetry for massive hot stars, particularly in the context of ultraviolet (UV) spaceborne missions. The prevalence of binarity in the massive star population and uncertainties regarding the degree of rotational criticality among hot stars raises important questions about stellar interactions, interior structure, and even the lifetimes of evolutionary phases. These uncertainties have consequences for stellar population synthesis calculations. Spectropolarimetry is a key tool for extracting information about stellar and binary geometries. We review methodologies involving electron scattering in circumstellar envelopes; gravity darkening from rapid rotation; spectral line effects including the (a) "line effect", (b) Ohman effect, and (c) Hanle effect; and the imprint of interstellar polarization on measurements. Finally, we describe the Polstar UV spectropolarimetric SMEX mission concept as one means for employing these diagnostics to clarify the state of high rotation and its impacts for massive stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Vortex flows are structures associated with the rotation of the plasma and/or the magnetic field that are present throughout the solar atmosphere. In recent years, their study has become increasingly important, as they are present on a wide variety of temporal and spatial scales and can connect several layers of the solar atmosphere. In this work, we focused on the detection and analysis of these structures in an automatic way. We use realistic 3D MHD numerical simulations obtained with the Mancha3D code at different magnetic field configurations and spatial resolutions. The vortex detection has been performed using the novel SWIRL code. We have been able to determine multiple structures associated with small and large scale vortices that extend in height in our simulations. We performed a statistical analysis of these structures, quantifying their number and typical sizes, as well as their temperature and heating profiles, confirming their importance in the energy transport.

 - **Abstract**
 We derived radial profiles and inner/outer gradients of various stellar population (SP) properties for 124 bright dwarf galaxies, $10^{7.53}\leq M_*/M_\odot\leq 10^{9.06}$, from the MaNDala sample, using integral field spectroscopy observations. Given the complex structure of dwarf galaxies, we used four different methods to derive SP radial profiles: two based on concentric elliptical rings, and two exploiting the spatially resolved data. For each method, we applied four approaches to calculate the inner ($0 \leq R/R_e \leq 1$) and outer ($0.75 \leq R/R_e \leq 1.5$) gradients of: luminosity- and mass-weighted age and stellar metallicity, dust attenuation, $D_{n4000}$ index, stellar mass and star formation rate (SFR) surface densities, and specific SFR. While the PSF has a minor impact on the SP gradients, the methodology for characterizing radial profiles significantly affects them. At fixed property, differences in inner gradients from concentric rings methods are $\sim0.05\text{-}0.1 \text{ dex/}R_e$, while outer gradients can reach $0.5\text{-}1 \text{ dex/}R_e$, relative to the median of all gradients of that property, $\text{med}\left(\{\nabla \mathcal{G}\}_i\right)$. Spatially resolved methods yield smaller differences, $\lesssim0.1 \text{ dex/}R_e$. For some SP gradients, e.g. $\nabla_\text{SFR}$, the dispersion among the methods is comparable to $\text{med}\left(\{\nabla \mathcal{G}\}_i\right)$. While it is not possible to select a single preferred method for determining SP gradients, we suggest to use $\text{med}\left(\{\nabla \mathcal{G}\}_i\right)$ for each SP property. The resulting median age and metallicity suggest that, overall, bright dwarfs experienced moderate inside-out formation, and significant early SF from low-metallicity gas with outward radial migration of old SPs. The derived SP gradients provide strong constraints on feedback mechanisms in dwarf galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) influence their host galaxies through winds and jets that can drive molecular outflows, traceable with CO line emissions using the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). Recent studies leveraging ALMA data have proposed a three-dimensional outflow geometry in the nearby Seyfert II galaxy NGC 1068, a key target for AGN unification theories. Using ALMA observations of CO(2-1), CO(3-2), and CO(6-5) transitions at roughly 0.1 arcseconds (approximately 7 parsecs) resolution, we analyzed the temperature, density, and kinematics of NGC 1068's circumnuclear disk (CND), focusing on the molecular outflow. Through local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) analysis, we derived column densities and rotational temperatures, indicating optically thin gas and CO-to-H2 (XCO) conversion factors between 4.8 and 9.6 times smaller than the Milky Way value. The inferred molecular mass outflow rate is mostly below 5.5 solar masses per year, with the dominant contribution northeast of the AGN. After subtracting the rotation curve of the CND, we modeled averaged line profiles in each region using single and multi-component Gaussian fits. Several profiles within or near the AGN wind bicone required multiple components with significant velocity shifts, suggesting multi-component complex outflow kinematics. We observe lateral variation in CO kinematics along the AGN wind bicone and a misalignment between the molecular and ionized outflow directions. These results imply that the dynamic impact of the ionized AGN wind on the molecular gas in the CND may be limited. However, the molecular outflow shows a complex, asymmetric structure.

 - **Abstract**
 The Sextans dwarf spheroidal galaxy has been challenging to study in a comprehensive way as it is highly extended on the sky, with an uncertain but large tidal radius of between 80-160 arcminutes (or 3-4kpc), and an extremely low central surface brightness of SigmaV = 26.2 mag/arcsec2. Here we present a new homogeneous survey of 41 VLT/FLAMES multi-fibre spectroscopic pointings that contain 2108 individual spectra, and combined with Gaia DR3 photometry and astrometry we present v-los measurements for 333 individual Red Giant Branch stars that are consistent with membership in the Sextans dwarf spheroidal galaxy. In addition, we provide the metallicity, [Fe/H], determined from the two strongest CaII triplet lines, for 312 of these stars. We look again at the global characteristics of Sextans, deriving a mean line-of-sight velocity of <v-los> = +227.1km/s and a mean metallicity of <[Fe/H]> = -2.37. The metallicity distribution is clearly double peaked, with the highest peak at [Fe/H]= -2.81 and another broader peak at [Fe/H]= -2.09. Thus it appears that Sextans hosts two populations and the superposition leads to a radial variation in the mean metallicity, with the more metal rich population being centrally concentrated. In addition there is an intriguing group of 9 probable members in the outer region of Sextans at higher [Fe/H] than the mean in this region. If this group could be confirmed as members they would eliminate the metallicity gradient. We also look again at the Colour-Magnitude Diagram of the resolved stellar population in Sextans. We also look again at the relation between Sextans and the intriguingly nearby globular cluster, Pal3. The global properties of Sextans have not changed significantly compared to previous studies, but they are now more precise, and the sample of known members in the outer regions is now more complete.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the X-ray variability of the supergiant X-ray binary 4U 1907+09 using the new NuSTAR observation of 2024. The source had a relatively stable flux level during previous NuSTAR observations, but the flux varied significantly during the current one. The light curve exhibits dips (off-state) and flares (on-state). The phase-coherent timing analysis during the on-state yields a pulse period of $443.99(4)~\mathrm{s}$, showing the pulsar's continued spin-down. The pulse profiles show an asymmetric double-peaked structure with a phase separation of 0.47 between the two peaks. A cyclotron resonance scattering feature (CRSF) is also detected at $\sim 17.6~\mathrm{keV}$, along with its harmonic at $\sim 38~\mathrm{keV}$, persisting across all flux states. Flux-resolved spectroscopy reveals that the CRSF remains constant despite a 25-fold change in flux. The spectral parameters like photon index and e-fold energy are out of phase with the pulse shape, whereas cutoff energy is in phase with the pulse shape. The source's luminosity during the on-state is $2.85 \times 10^{35}~\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}}$, consistent with a "pencil" beam radiation pattern expected at this flux level from a collisionless gas-mediated shock. These results offer further insights into the accretion dynamics and magnetic field geometry of this system.
#### North+Lone Star Supernova Host Survey I: Local Host-Galaxy H$α$ Surface Brightness and the Hubble Residuals of Type Ia Supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 We present optical integral-field unit (IFU) spectroscopy acquired with the George and Cynthia Mitchell Spectrograph on the Harlan J. Smith telescope at McDonald Observatory of 94 galaxies (0.01 < z < 0.058) that have hosted Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). We selected host galaxies with star-forming morphology, consistent with the criteria used by Riess et al. (2022). We measured the H${\alpha}$ surface brightness of each host galaxy within 1 kpc of the location of the supernova. Using distances from the Pantheon+ sample, we find a step in Hubble residuals compared to local H${\alpha}$ surface brightness of -0.097 $\pm$ 0.051 mag at 1.9${\sigma}$ significance in a sample of 73 host galaxies, where SNe in environments with smaller H${\alpha}$ surface brightness are, on average, less luminous after correction for light-curve shape and color. Almost all of the SNe in our sample were discovered by targeted surveys. Using an independent sample primarily from the untargeted Nearby Supernova Factory survey, Rigault et al. (2020) found a step of 0.045 $\pm$ 0.029 mag where SNe in passive environments are instead brighter, which is in 2.4${\sigma}$ tension with our measurement. Rigault et al. (2013) designated SNe Ia comparatively small HRs (< -0.1) and faint local H${\alpha}$ surface brightness (SB) (<log10(H${\alpha}$ SB/(erg$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$kpc$^2$))=38.32 as the M$_2$ population. SNe that would be classified as M$_2$ are less highly represented in our sample (7% versus 21%). When we include an additional twelve early-type galaxies, the number of M$_2$ SNe is almost doubled, although the tension with the HR step measured by Rigault et al. (2020) persists at 1.7${\sigma}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Inspired by recent studies of the Milky Way--LMC interaction and its implications for the Milky Way's global dynamical history, we investigate how the massive satellite galaxy M33 influences Andromeda's (M31) center of mass (COM) position and velocity as it passes through M31's halo. Using recent 6-dimensional phase space measurements for both galaxies, we use backward integration to revisit M33's orbital history in a massive M31 potential ($3\times10^{12}\,M_{\odot}$) for the first time. As previously concluded, we find that a first infall orbit is still the most statistically significant ($\gtrsim$ 90%) orbital solution for M33, except for a high mass M31 combined with M31 proper motions from HST (as opposed to Gaia), where there is a greater likelihood (~65%) of a previous encounter. However, the minimum distance between M33 and M31 during this passage is typically $\geq$ 100 kpc, two to three times larger than the distance required to explain M33's warped stellar and gaseous disks. We quantify the magnitude and direction of M31's evolving COM position ($R_{COM}$) and velocity ($V_{COM}$) owing to M33, finding $R_{COM}\approx$100-150 kpc at maximum and $V_{COM}\approx$20-40 km s$^{-1}$. Furthermore, we explore the implications of this phenomenon for the M31 satellite system, specifically whether M33's gravitational influence is linked to the lopsided distribution of M31 satellites and whether M33 significantly perturbs the orbits of other M31 satellites. While M33 alone may not explain the lopsided nature of M31's satellite system, its dynamical impact is non-negligible and must be accounted for in future dynamical studies of the M31 system.
