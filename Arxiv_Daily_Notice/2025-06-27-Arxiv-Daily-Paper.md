#### Probing Equatorial Ionospheric TEC at Sub-GHz Frequencies with Wide-Band (B4) uGMRT Interferometric Data

 - **Abstract**
 Phase stability at low radio frequencies is severely impacted by ionospheric propagation delays. Radio interferometers such as the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) are capable of detecting changes in the ionosphere's total electron content (TEC) over larger spatial scales and with greater sensitivity compared to conventional tools like the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). Thanks to its unique design featuring both a dense central array and long outer arms-and its strategic location, the GMRT is particularly well-suited for studying the sensitive ionospheric region located between the northern peak of the Equatorial Ionization Anomaly (EIA) and the magnetic equator. In this study, we observe the bright flux calibrator 3C48 for ten hours to characterize and study the low-latitude ionosphere with the upgraded GMRT (uGMRT). We outline the methods used for wideband data reduction and processing to accurately measure differential TEC (dTEC) between antenna pairs, achieving a precision of less than 1 mTECU for the central square antennas and approximately 1 mTECU for the arm antennas. The measured dTEC values are used to estimate the TEC gradient across the GMRT arm antennas. We measure the ionospheric phase structure function and find a power-law slope of $\beta = 1.72$, indicating deviations from pure Kolmogorov turbulence. The inferred diffractive scale the spatial separation over which the phase variance reaches $1 \text{rad}^2$ is 6.66 km. A small diffractive scale implies high phase variability across the field of view and reduced temporal coherence, which poses challenges for calibration and imaging.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar-mass black holes (BHs) represent the natural end states of massive stars. It is estimated that $10^8$ stellar-mass BHs are present in the Milky Way galaxy, a significant fraction of which are expected to be isolated. Despite their expected abundance, only about 20 have been detected so far - mostly in binary systems - with just one confirmed isolated black hole (IsoBH) identified via astrometric microlensing. In this study, we investigate the potential for detecting electromagnetic emissions from IsoBHs by generating synthetic model spectra of their emissions in different types of interstellar medium environments. These model spectra are then compared with current observational capabilities. We show that photons emitted by IsoBHs - especially those accreting material in dense environments or within the Solar neighborhood - should be readily detectable. However, confidently identifying these sources remains highly challenging. We conclude that a number of IsoBHs must already exist in current astronomical catalogs but have not been identified as such. We outline possible strategies for detection and identification of IsoBHs using the current and upcoming telescopes.

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate beam modeling is important in many radio astronomy applications. In this paper, we focus on beam modeling for 21-cm intensity mapping experiments using radio interferometers, though the techniques also apply to single dish experiments with small modifications. In 21-cm intensity mapping, beam models are usually determined from highly detailed electromagnetic simulations of the receiver system. However, these simulations are expensive, and therefore have limited ability to describe practical imperfections in the beam pattern. We present a fully analytic Bayesian inference framework to infer a beam pattern from the interferometric visibilities assuming a particular sky model and that the beam pattern for all elements is identical, allowing one to capture deviations from the ideal beam for relatively low computational cost. We represent the beam using a sparse Fourier-Bessel basis on a projection of the hemisphere to the unit disc, but the framework applies to any linear basis expansion of the primary beam. We test the framework on simulated visibilities from an unpolarized sky, ignoring mutual coupling of array elements. We successfully recover the simulated, perturbed power beam when the sky model is perfect. Briefly exploring sky model inaccuracies, we find that beam inferences are sensitive to them, so we suggest jointly modeling uncertainties in the sky and beam in related inference tasks.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast neutrino flavor conversion may impact the explosion mechanism and nucleosynthesis in core-collapse supernovae. A necessary condition for fast flavor conversion is the presence of crossings in the angular distribution of the electron-neutrino lepton number (ELN crossing). Because of the computational costs, flavor-dependent angular distributions are not computed by the vast majority of state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations; instead, angular distributions are reconstructed employing approximate methods in post-processing. In this work, we evaluate the performance of four methods adopted to diagnose the existence of ELN crossings. For selected post-bounce times, we extract the fluid and thermodynamic properties from spherically symmetric supernova simulations for an $18.6 M_\odot$ progenitor, testing cases with and without muons as well as with and without mixing-length treatment of proto-neutron star convection. We compare the occurrence of crossings in the angular distributions obtained by solving the Boltzmann equations with those in distributions reconstructed from angular moments of our Boltzmann solutions by using the maximum entropy and Minerbo schemes, and also with crossings identified via a polynomial weighting function applied to the angular moments. Our results show that the polynomial method and the Minerbo closure scheme have severe limitations. The maximum entropy approach captures most of the forward crossings, although it fails to reproduce or misidentifies crossings in a subset of our models. These findings highlight the need for robust modeling of the neutrino angular properties in order to assess the impact of flavor conversion on the supernova mechanism.

 - **Abstract**
 The origins of merging compact binaries observed by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA gravitational-wave detectors remain uncertain, with multiple astrophysical channels possibly contributing to the merger rate. Formation processes can imprint nontrivial correlations in the underlying distribution of source properties, but current understanding of the overall population relies heavily on simplified and uncorrelated parametric models. In this work, we use PixelPop-a high-resolution Bayesian nonparametric model with minimal assumptions-to analyze multidimensional correlations in the astrophysical distribution of masses, spins, and redshifts of black-hole mergers from mock gravitational-wave catalogs constructed using population-synthesis simulations. With full parameter estimation on 400 detections at current sensitivities, we show explicitly that neglecting population-level correlations biases inference. In contrast, modeling all significant correlations with PixelPop allows us to correctly measure the astrophysical merger rate across all source parameters. We then propose a nonparametric method to distinguish between different formation channels by comparing the PixelPop results back to astrophysical simulations. For our simulated catalog, we find that only formation channels with significantly different physical processes are distinguishable, whereas channels that share evolutionary stages are not. Given the substantial uncertainties in source formation, our results highlight the necessity of multidimensional astrophysics-agnostic models like PixelPop for robust interpretation of gravitational-wave catalogs.
#### Dynamical friction and massive black hole orbits: analytical predictions and numerical solutions

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the orbital decay of a massive BH embedded in a dark matter halo and a stellar bulge, using both analytical and numerical simulations with the aim of developing and validating a reliable dynamical friction (DF) correction across simulation resolutions. We develop a Python-based library to solve the equations of motion of the BH and provide an analytical framework for the numerical results. Then, we carry out simulations at different resolutions and for different softening choices using the Tree-PM code OpenGADGET3, where we implement an improved DF correction based on a kernel-weighted local density estimation. Our results demonstrate that the DF correction significantly accelerates BH sinking and ensures convergence with increasing resolution, closely matching analytical predictions. We find that in low-resolution regimes - particularly when the BH mass is smaller than that of the background particles - our DF model still effectively controls BH dynamics. Contrary to expectations, the inclusion of a stellar bulge can delay sinking due to numerical heating, an effect partially mitigated by the DF correction. We conclude that our refined DF implementation provides a robust framework for modeling BH dynamics both in controlled simulation setups of galaxies and in large-scale cosmological simulations. This will be crucial for future simulation campaigns, to enable more accurate predictions of AGN accretion and feedback, and to estimate gravitational-wave event rates.

 - **Abstract**
 Modern observatories are designed to deliver increasingly detailed views of astrophysical signals. To fully realize the potential of these observations, principled data-analysis methods are required to effectively separate and reconstruct the underlying astrophysical components from data corrupted by noise and instrumental effects. In this work, we introduce a novel multi-frequency Bayesian model of the sky emission field that leverages latent-space tension as an indicator of model misspecification, enabling automated separation of diffuse, point-like, and extended astrophysical emission components across wavelength bands. Deviations from latent-space prior expectations are used as diagnostics for model misspecification, thus systematically guiding the introduction of new sky components, such as point-like and extended sources. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on synthetic multi-frequency imaging data and apply it to observational X-ray data from the eROSITA Early Data Release (EDR) of the SN1987A region in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Our results highlight the method's capability to reconstruct astrophysical components with high accuracy, achieving sub-pixel localization of point sources, robust separation of extended emission, and detailed uncertainty quantification. The developed methodology offers a general and well-founded framework applicable to a wide variety of astronomical datasets, and is therefore well suited to support the analysis needs of next-generation multi-wavelength and multi-messenger surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the ultimate I-band calibration of the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) standard candle. Our calibration is based on photometry from the outer parts of the Large Magellanic Cloud, 2.75<r<6.5 degs from the center, collected during the OGLE-IV phase of the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment. Outer regions of the LMC have large advantages compared to the previous attempts of the TRGB calibrations using the red giants from the central parts of this galaxy. The interstellar reddening in these regions is much lower and more uniform, stellar crowding is lower and the outer parts of the LMC can be accurately described as a flat disk within the reasonable distance from the LMC center. The number of red giants in the upper part of the red giant branch in our LMC region is large, ~140 000, making it possible to determine of the tip magnitude with high accuracy. Our ultimate I-band calibration of the TRGB is: M_{I,TRGB}=-4.022 +- 0.006 (stat.) +- 0.033 (syst.) mag. We also provide its values for different techniques of the determination of the tip magnitude. The accuracy of our calibration is mostly limited by the accuracy of the distance to the LMC (~1%) and can be improved in the future. We test our calibration by comparing it with the TRGB in the Small Magellanic Cloud and NGC 4258, i.e., the galaxies with precise geometric distance determination, and find excellent agreement. Finally, we refine the main determinations of the Hubble constant, H_0, with the TRGB using our new calibration of the I-band TRGB brightness.
#### The Importance of the Population III Initial Mass Function in Determining the Characteristics of the Earliest Galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 We use large-scale cosmological simulations to study the prospect of observing Population III (Pop III) bright galaxies with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). To quantify the impact of radiative transfer (RT), we compare a simulation that includes moment-based RT with one in which RT is handled approximately. Both simulations include a subgrid model of turbulent mixing, which is essential in tracking the formation of Pop III stars. We find that RT has a minor impact on our results and that the overall star formation rate densities for both simulations are in fair agreement with observations and other simulations. While our overall galaxy luminosity functions are consistent with current high-redshift observations, we predict a drop of a factor of at least 6 in detectable galaxy counts at $z = 14$ as compared to $z = 12$ at $M_{ab}$ $\le$ -16. Modeling Pop III stars according to a lognormal, top-heavy initial mass function (IMF), we find that these stars contribute no more than about 1 percent of the flux of potentially detectable lensed galaxies at $z = 12$-14 with $M_{ab} \le -15$. This is because a top-heavy Pop III IMF results in 99 percent of Pop III stellar mass being recycled within 10 Myr, well before the approx. 30 Myr timescale on which galaxies recover from supernova feedback and heating. These effects conspire to quickly extinguish Pop III star formation, making their detection difficult even for JWST.
#### A Black Hole is Born: 3D GRMHD Simulation of Black Hole Formation from Core-Collapse

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first three-dimensional, fully general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (3D GRMHD) simulation of a black hole (BH) formed from the collapsed core of a massive star. The ability to self-consistently capture the birth of a compact remnant in 3D is crucial for modeling natal BH properties (including masses, spins, and kicks), which are of particular interest in the era of gravitational wave astronomy. However, such simulations have remained elusive due to extreme computational challenges and demands. We employ the GPU-accelerated dynamical-spacetime GRMHD code GRaM-X to follow the collapse, core-bounce, shock propagation, and eventual BH formation of a massive stellar progenitor in full 3D. We initialize our simulation by mapping a one-dimensional (1D) model of a star with a zero-age-main-sequence mass of $45 M_\odot$ to 3D. We use moderate rotation (consistent with expectations from stellar evolution modeling) and a relatively weak dipolar magnetic field. The collapsing core drives a shock that reaches a maximum radius of roughly 170 km before stalling and does not lead to a successful explosion. The proto-neutron star accretes matter before collapsing to form a BH $t_{BH} \approx 325$ ms after core-bounce. The time of BH formation and initial BH mass are remarkably similar to those obtained with GR1D, a 1D general-relativistic neutrino-hydrodynamics code, to which we compare our results. We track the horizon of the newborn BH after formation and calculate a steady kick velocity of $v_{kick} \approx 72$ km/s and a mass of $M_{BH} \approx 2.62 M_\odot$, which is still rising at the end of the simulation.

 - **Abstract**
 Multiple stellar systems are common especially among O and B stars. In order to accurately describe their dynamics, interactions among components must be accounted for. In this work, we describe the new dynamical model in Phoebe, which could be used just for this purpose. The n-body model is based on the Reboundx numerical integrator and accounts for mutual perturbations, oblateness, relativistic effects, or light-time effects. The initial conditions can be set up as hierarchical or two-pairs geometry. For comparison purposes, we also provide a simplified keplerian model. Photometric computations work similarly as before, with Roche distortions for pairs of components (or for centres of mass, if hierarchical), and all mutual eclipses. If the time span of observations is long enough, so that perturbations (precession, resonances) are manifested in eclipse timings or durations, this allows to construct order-of-magnitude more precise models of stellar systems. This draft refers to a development version of Phoebe, available at this https URL . It is not yet included in the official Phoebe repository!
#### Blowing star formation away in AGN Hosts (BAH) -- III: Feeding and feedback in 3C\:293 observed with JWST NIRSpec

 - **Abstract**
 We use JWST/NIRSpec observations of the radio galaxy 3C 293 to map the emission, extinction, and kinematics of hot molecular and ionized gas, as well as stellar kinematics, within the inner ~ 2 kpc. The stellar velocity field is well described by a rotating disk model, with its kinematical center offset by ~ 0.5 arcsec from the continuum peak. The hot molecular gas is traced by the H$_2$2.12$\mu$m emission line, and the ionized gas by [Fe II]1.64$\mu$m and Pa$\alpha$. The gas presents three main kinematic components: a rotating disk seen as a narrow component ($\sigma$ ~ 100 kms$^{-1}$); a blueshifted broad outflow ($\sigma$ ~ 250 kms$^{-1}$); and a fast ionized outflow as a very broad component ($\sigma$ ~ 640 kms$^{-1}$). Extinction maps reveal high A$_V$ values, up to ~ 35, spatially coincident with dust lanes seen in optical images. In addition to the disk and outflows components, inflows along the dust lanes are detected in H$_2$ gas, with a mass inflow rate of $\dot{M}_{in}$ ~ 8 x 10$^{-3}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, comparable to the AGN accretion rate. For the outflows, we derive peak mass-outflow rates of 0.14 $\pm$ 0.04 M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ (molecular) and 5.5 $\pm$ 1.44 M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ (ionized). The outflow, driven by the radio jet, has a kinetic power of 4.5% of the jet power - enough to suppress star formation. Our results highlight 3C 293's turbulent post-merger history and JWST's unique capability to probe dust-obscured AGN.
#### An Accretion Flare Interpretation for the UHE Neutrino Event KM3-230213A

 - **Abstract**
 We study the origin of the ultra-high-energy (UHE) astrophysical neutrino event KM3-230213A detected by KM3NeT, focusing on MRC 0614-083 which has been pinpointed as the closest blazar to the neutrino localization. A joint interpretation of the optical, infrared, and X-ray light curves suggests that MRC 0614-083 has undergone a super-Eddington accretion flare accompanied by efficient proton acceleration. That flare has initiated a delayed infrared echo within the surrounding dust torus, which serves as a target for photomeson ($p\gamma$) interactions such that a self-consistent picture emerges: the predicted UHE neutrino flux is at the level expected from joint $E^{-2}$ fit with the IceCube measurements at lower energies, the variable nature of the event alleviates the tension with IceCube limits, and the accompanying electromagnetic cascade describes the X-ray flare around the neutrino detection time. Since a key remaining uncertainty is the unknown redshift of the source, we strongly encourage optical/ultraviolet spectroscopic measurements to determine its redshift.

 - **Abstract**
 Aims. With the aim to reveal the effects of the magnetic field to the multi-band activity of dwarf stars, we search for associated radio emission for an extensive list of 14 915 brown dwarfs and 15 124 flaring stars. Methods. We utilised the first and second epoch catalogues and radio maps from all three epochs of the VLASS, supplemented with X-ray catalogues based on observations by the ROSAT, eROSITA, and XMM-Newton space telescopes, and 2-minute cadence optical light curves from the TESS mission. The radio-detected sub-sample was queried for concurrent TESS observations, and sources with coinciding light-curves were studied individually. Results. We found no associated radio emission for brown dwarfs, and found 55 radio counterparts for the sample of flaring stars, out of which seven have coincident TESS observations. The radio-detected sample follows both the radio-X-ray and the period-activity relations. We found a strong correlation between the radio powers and the stellar parameters of surface gravity, radius, and mass. We found no connection between the flare rate and the radio variability. For radio-detected stars with available effective temperatures and rotational periods, we estimated gyrochronological ages, which resulted in values of Tgyro < 1 Gyr, with the majority of the sample being younger than 150 Myr. We found no strong connection between the occurrence of optical flares and radio variability for the individually studied stars. Conclusions. We conclude that radio emission from intermediate-to-late type flaring stars is of synchrotron nature, and shares a common origin with X-ray processes. It is created by a predominantly young stellar population, and is the collective contribution of stellar flares, accretion, and coronal heating.

 - **Abstract**
 M31 hosts a rich population of outer halo ($R_{\rm{proj}} > 25$ kpc) globular clusters (GCs), many of which show strong evidence for spatial and/or kinematical associations with large-scale tidal debris features. We present deep Hubble Space Telescope photometry of 48 halo GCs, including 18 with clear ties to stellar streams and 13 with potential associations. Using the colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), we quantify the horizontal branch (HB) morphologies and employ new empirical relationships, calibrated on Milky Way (MW) GCs, to consistently derive metallicities and line-of-sight extinctions. We find a remarkable correlation between HB morphology and the presence of substructure: GCs with very red HBs are almost exclusively associated with substructure, while non-substructure GCs have extended blue HBs. This provides the first direct evidence that red HB halo clusters originate from satellite accretion, a notion introduced nearly 50 years ago from MW studies which has remained unconfirmed until now. In addition to a more metal-rich tail, the substructure GC sample also contains a few clusters with very low metallicities and red HBs, unlike any objects known in the MW. We suggest these are recently accreted young clusters, supporting the growing evidence that M31 has experienced a more prolonged accretion history than the MW.
#### Hiding behind a curtain of dust: Gas and dust properties of an ultra-luminous strongly-lensed z = 3.75 galaxy behind the Milky Way disk

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed analysis of J154506, a strongly lensed submillimeter galaxy (SMG) behind the Lupus-I molecular cloud, and characterization of its physical properties. Using a combination of archival and new data (including sub-arcsecond resolution ($\sim0.75$) ALMA observations, VLT/MUSE and FORS2 optical data, as well as spectral scans from the ACA and the LMT) we identify two high-significance (SNR>5) emission lines at 97.0 and 145.5 GHz, corresponding to CO(4-3) and CO(6-5), respectively. These detections yield a spectroscopic redshift of $z_{\rm{spec}}=3.7515\pm 0.0005$. We also report the detection of the [CII] 158 $\mu$m fine-structure line at 400 GHz using the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX), further confirming the redshift and providing insights into J154506's physical properties. By modeling ALMA Band 6 and 7 continuum data in the uv-plane, we derive an average magnification factor of $6.0 \pm 0.4$ and our analysis reveals a relatively cold dust ($\sim$37 K) in a starburst galaxy with a high intrinsic dust mass ($\sim2.5\times10^{9}~\rm{M}_{\odot}$) and infrared (IR) luminosity ($\sim6\times10^{12}~\rm{L}_{\odot}$). The dust SED is best reproduced by a model dominated by moderately dense molecular gas ($10^2-10^4\rm{cm}^{-3}$), indicating that the far-infrared emission arises primarily from diffuse regions rather than compact, high-pressure environments typical of extreme starbursts or AGN. This is supported by the close-to-unity ratio between the dust and kinetic temperatures, which argues against highly energetic heating mechanisms. The CO excitation ladder peaks close to CO(5-4) and is dominated by slightly denser molecular gas. Our results underscore the unique power of far-IR and submillimeter observations to both uncover and characterize scarce, strongly lensed, high-redshift galaxies, even when obscured by foreground molecular clouds.

 - **Abstract**
 The Galactic Center and inner disk of the Milky Way contain complex stellar populations obscured by heavy dust extinction. To study their chemical composition, high-resolution near-infrared (near-IR) spectroscopy is necessary. Expanding the set of elements measurable in the near-IR, especially neutron-capture elements, improves our ability to trace nucleosynthesis and Galactic chemical evolution. This work aims to identify and characterize a spectral line suitable for determining rubidium (Rb) abundances. Rb is produced in roughly equal parts by the r- and s-processes. We analyze high-resolution (R = 45,000) IGRINS near-IR spectra of 40 M giants in the solar neighborhood, most observed with Gemini South. We perform spectral synthesis of the Rb I line at 15289.48 A, using new log(gf) values and including an astrophysical calibration of the blending Fe I lines. The resulting [Rb/Fe] ratios are compared to other neutron-capture elements and interpreted with chemical evolution models. We demonstrate that the used Rb line is a reliable abundance indicator in M giants and the coolest K giants, but becomes too weak at higher temperatures. [Rb/Fe] shows a decreasing trend with metallicity, mirroring that of ytterbium (Yb), another mixed r-/s-process element. Our results agree with optical studies, validating the use of this near-IR line. Comparisons with chemical evolution models confirm that both s- and r-process sources are needed to explain the Rb trend. This work adds Rb to the list of elements measurable in high-resolution H- and K-band spectra, enabling studies of one more neutron-capture element in dust-obscured regions like the Galactic Center and inner disk.

 - **Abstract**
 The Statistical-likelihood Exoplanetary Habitability Index (SEPHI) serves as a valuable tool for prioritizing targets for further study and identifying potentially habitable environments. In this paper, we present SEPHI 2.0, which incorporates several key improvements: (1) updated methods for estimating exoplanet internal structures and magnetic fields; (2) the inclusion of orbital eccentricity in assessing the potential for liquid water on an exoplanet's surface; and (3) a new exoplanet mass-radius relationship. SEPHI 2.0 retains its probabilistic framework and combines the different subindexes by selecting the most restrictive one. In SEPHI 2.0, atmospheric retention is consolidated into a single index that incorporates both thermal (Jeans escape) and nonthermal (stellar wind and magnetic effect) processes. Recent advancements in estimating exoplanet internal structures and magnetic fields have been integrated. Additionally, a new empirical exoplanet mass-radius relationship is introduced. All this is incorporated into the SADE code, which uses key data on exoplanets and their host stars to assess habitability and prioritize targets for further study, providing a comprehensive output of an exoplanetary system's physical characteristics. SADE is available as a free online tool. Notably, this is the first approach to including estimated exoplanet magnetic 8elds in a habitability index. The SADE software facilitates the identification of potentially habitable exoplanets. Among the 5500+ confirmed exoplanets, only a few-such as Kepler-62f and GJ 514b achieve SEPHI 2.0 scores close to 1. It is also noticeable that, according to our studies, TRAPPIST-1 f and g are ranked higher than TRAPPIST-1 e in terms of habitability potential.

 - **Abstract**
 3C 403 is a well known FRII radio galaxy, whose jets extend up to the kpc scale. In this letter, we present its identification as the second most significant source among the more than 150 inspected using the 15-year neutrino dataset of the ANTARES Collaboration, possibly making it the first radio galaxy with neutrino emission. Following the previous association of blazars with netrinos events, we aimed at studying the jet properties and its possible role in neutrino production. We collected multi-scale radio observations to assess the properties of the jet from the kpc to pc scale. Moreover, the high-energy properties of its AGN were inspected. Through the analysis of the jet orientation on the different scales, we verified that neither the inner nor the extended jet seems to have a viewing angle close to the line of sight. Instead, the jet seems to lie on the plane of the sky. In addition, we tested the recently proposed scaling relation between neutrino and hard X-rays fluxes, identified for blazars and Seyfert galaxies, against the measured fluxes for 3C 304. We found that the source lies in the region between blazars and Seyferts, altough the current upper limit on neutrino flux does not allow us to be conclusive on the correlation. In these regards, 3C 403 is an intermediate case between the previous cases of neutrino associations, providing a useful test case for future models.

 - **Abstract**
 Spicules are thin, elongated jet-like features seen in observations of the solar atmosphere, at the interface between the solar photosphere and the corona. These features exhibit highly complex dynamics and are a necessary connecting link between the cooler, denser solar chromosphere and the extremely hot, tenuous corona. In this work, we explore the spatial and temporal relation between solar spicules and magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) shocks using data from a 2D radiative MHD (rMHD) simulation of the solar atmosphere driven by solar convection. Here, we demonstrate, through direct identification, that slow MHD shocks, which propagate along magnetic field lines, are regions of strong positive vertical acceleration of the plasma that forms the tip of the spicule material during its rise phase. We quantify the effect of pressure and Lorentz forces on the acceleration of the plasma inside the shocks during the rise of spicules. The causality between spicule and shock propagation in the atmosphere of the model is also investigated. It is further shown that the strength of these shocks may play a vital role in determining the height of the spicules, supporting the idea that shocks act as drivers of some spicules. In addition, we also find the presence of structures similar to propagating coronal disturbances (PCDs) in the simulation, linked with the spicules. Here, PCDs appear to be associated with the shock waves driving the spicules that subsequently propagate into the corona and have similar speeds to those reported in observations.
#### Natal kick by early-asymmetrical pairs of jets to the neutron star of supernova remnant S147

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze the bipolar morphology of the jet-shaped core-collapse supernova (CCSN) remnant (CCSNR) S147 and its neutron star (NS) kick velocity, and suggest that two pairs of unequal, opposite jets contributed to the NS kick velocity. This kick by early asymmetrical pairs (kick-BEAP) of jets mechanism operates within the framework of the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM). We examine the prominent pair of large ears and, based on their flat structure rather than the more common conical structure of ears, conclude that two pairs of jets close in angle inflated the two opposite ears. We connect two opposite X-ray bright zones by an additional axis to create the full point-symmetric morphology of CCSNR S147. We propose that the two unequal jets that formed the X-ray bright zones imparted the first kick-BEAP, while the two pairs of jets that formed the ears imparted the second kick-BEAP. The two kick velocities are of about equal magnitude of ~450 km/s, which implies very energetic jets. Such jets can excite gravitational waves that present detectors can detect from the Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds. We use the morphology we identify to estimate the CCSNR age at 23,000 yr. Our results strengthen the JJEM.
