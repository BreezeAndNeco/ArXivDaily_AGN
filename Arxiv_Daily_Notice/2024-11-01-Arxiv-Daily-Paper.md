 - **Abstract**
 The discovery and localization of FRB20240209A by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Fast Radio Burst (CHIME/FRB) experiment marks the first repeating FRB localized with the CHIME/FRB Outriggers and adds to the small sample of repeating FRBs with associated host galaxies. Here we present Keck and Gemini observations of the host that reveal a redshift $z=0.1384\pm0.0004$. We perform stellar population modeling to jointly fit the optical through mid-infrared data of the host and infer a median stellar mass log$(M_*/{\rm M_{\odot}})=11.34\pm0.01$ and a mass-weighted stellar population age $\sim11$Gyr, corresponding to the most massive and oldest FRB host discovered to date. Coupled with a star formation rate $<0.36\,{\rm M_{\odot}\ yr^{-1}}$, the specific star formation rate $<10^{-11.8}\rm\ yr^{-1}$ classifies the host as quiescent. Through surface brightness profile modeling, we determine an elliptical galaxy morphology, marking the host as the first confirmed elliptical FRB host. The discovery of a quiescent early-type host galaxy within a transient class predominantly characterized by late-type star-forming hosts is reminiscent of short-duration gamma-ray bursts, Type Ia supernovae, and ultraluminous X-ray sources. Based on these shared host demographics, coupled with a large offset as demonstrated in our companion paper, we conclude that preferred progenitors for FRB20240209A include magnetars formed through merging binary neutron stars/white dwarfs or the accretion-induced collapse of a white dwarf, or a luminous X-ray binary. Together with FRB20200120E localized to a globular cluster in M81, our findings provide strong evidence that some fraction of FRBs may arise from a process distinct from the core collapse of massive stars.

 - **Abstract**
 We cross-correlate a low-contamination subset of the VST ATLAS g < 22.5 quasar catalogue with g < 21.5 galaxy clusters, r < 21 galaxies and r < 19.5 Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) to probe their halo mass profiles via quasar magnification bias caused by weak lensing. In the case of galaxy clusters we find that at small scales their mass profiles are well fitted by Navarro, Frenk and White (NFW) models with masses within the expected range. For the galaxies, we find consistency with previous SDSS-based results for the galaxy-quasar cross-correlation and the galaxy auto-correlation functions. Disagreement as to whether the cross-correlation results are in tension with $\Lambda$CDM appears due to different assumptions as to whether galaxies trace mass. We conclude that halo occupation distribution (HOD) models fit the galaxy - quasar lensing results better than models where galaxies trace the mass. We further test the cluster and galaxy HOD models in the 2-halo range using the Planck Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) lensing map, finding that the cross-correlation with both the poorest clusters and the galaxies may be marginally over-predicted by the above HOD models. Finally, we measure the magnification bias of LRGs using both quasar and CMB lensing and find that the observed quasar lensing amplitude may be $\approx 2\times$ too high and, on larger scales, the CMB lensing amplitude may be too low to be explained by a standard LRG HOD model.

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce new high-resolution galaxy simulations accelerated by a surrogate model that reduces the computation cost by approximately 75 percent. Massive stars with a Zero Age Main Sequence mass of about 8 solar masses and above explode as core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), which play a critical role in galaxy formation. The energy released by CCSNe is essential for regulating star formation and driving feedback processes in the interstellar medium (ISM). However, the short integration timesteps required for SNe feedback present significant bottlenecks in star-by-star galaxy simulations that aim to capture individual stellar dynamics and the inhomogeneous shell expansion of SNe within the turbulent ISM. Our new framework combines direct numerical simulations and surrogate modeling, including machine learning and Gibbs sampling. The star formation history and the time evolution of outflow rates in the galaxy match those obtained from resolved direct numerical simulations. Our new approach achieves high-resolution fidelity while reducing computational costs, effectively bridging the physical scale gap and enabling multi-scale simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 We exploit the VST ATLAS quasar/QSO catalogue to perform three measurements of the quasar halo mass profile. First, we make a new estimate of the angular auto-correlation function of $\approx230,000$ ATLAS quasars with $z_{photo}\lesssim 2.5$ and $17<g<22$. By comparing with the $\Lambda$CDM mass clustering correlation function, we measure the quasar bias to be $b_Q\approx2.1$, implying a quasar halo mass of $M_{halo}\approx8.5\times10^{11}$h$^{-1} M_\odot$. Second, we cross-correlate these $z\approx1.7$ ATLAS quasars with the Planck Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) lensing maps, detecting a somewhat stronger signal at $4'<\theta<60'$ than previous authors. Scaling these authors' model fit to our data we estimate a quasar host halo mass of $M_{halo}\approx8.3\times10^{11}h^{-1}$M$_{\odot}$. Third, we fit Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) model parameters to our quasar auto-correlation function and from the derived halo mass function we estimate a quasar halo mass of $M_{halo}\approx2.5\times10^{12}$h$^{-1} M_\odot$. We then compare our HOD model prediction to our quasar-CMB lensing result, confirming their consistency. We find that most ($\approx2/3$) QSOs have halo masses within a factor of $\approx3$ of this average mass. An analysis based on the probability of X-ray detections of AGN in galaxies and the galaxy stellar mass function gives a similarly small mass range. Finally, we compare the quasar halo mass and luminosity functions and suggest that gravitational growth may produce the constant space density with redshift seen in the quasar luminosity function.

 - **Abstract**
 We utilize the now substantial amount of astrophysical observations of neutron stars (NSs), along with perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (pQCD) calculations at high density, to directly constrain the NS Equation of State (EoS). To this end, we construct non-parametric EoS priors by using Gaussian processes trained on 75 EoSs, which includes models with either hadrons, hyperons or quarks at high densities. We create a prior using the full EoS sample (model-agnostic), and one prior for each EoS family to test model discrimination. These are then utilized in a Bayesian updating scheme by first performing a complete analysis of the binary NS merger event GW170817 with minimal assumptions, and sequentially adding information from X-ray and radio NS observations, along with pQCD calculations. Besides providing standard constraints, such as the pressure at twice nuclear saturation density $p(2\rho_\text{sat})=4.3^{+0.6}_{-0.6}\,\times 10^{34}\text{dyne/cm}^{2}$, at $95\%$ confidence level, for the model agnostic prior, our methodology also allows the constraining of EoS properties such as phase transitions and differentiation among quark, hyperonic or hadronic models.

 - **Abstract**
 Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) in gamma rays can have multiple consequences, such as energy-dependent photon group velocity, photon instability, vacuum birefringence, and modified electromagnetic interaction. Depending on how LIV is introduced, several of these effects can occur simultaneously. Nevertheless, in experimental tests of LIV, each effect is tested separately and independently. For the first time, we are attempting to test for two effects in a single analysis: modified gamma-ray absorption and energy-dependent photon group velocity. In doing so, we are using artificial neural networks. In this contribution, we discuss our experiences with using machine learning for this purpose and present our very first results.

 - **Abstract**
 Cloud formation and magnetic effects are both expected to significantly impact the structures and observable properties of hot Jupiter atmospheres. For some hot Jupiters, thermal ionization and condensation can coexist in a single atmosphere, and both processes are important. We present a grid of general circulation models across a wide range of irradiation temperatures with and without incorporating the effects of magnetism and cloud formation to investigate how these processes work in tandem. We find that clouds are present in the atmosphere at all modeled irradiation temperatures, while magnetic effects are negligible for planets with irradiation temperatures cooler than 2000 K. At and above this threshold, clouds and magnetic fields shape atmospheres together, with mutual feedback. Models that include magnetism, through their influence on the temperature structure, produce more longitudinally symmetric dayside cloud coverage and more equatorially concentrated clouds on the nightside and morning terminator. To indicate how these processes would affect observables, we generate bolometric thermal and reflected phase curves from these models. The combination of clouds and magnetic effects increases thermal phase curve amplitudes and decreases peak offsets more than either process does individually.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of polarization position angle ($\theta$) standards made from 2014 to 2023 with the High Precision Polarimetric Instrument (HIPPI) and other HIPPI-class polarimeters in both hemispheres are used to investigate their variability. Multi-band data were first used to thoroughly recalibrate the instrument performance by bench-marking against carefully selected literature data. A novel Co-ordinate Difference Matrix (CDM) approach - which combines pairs of points - was then used to amalgamate monochromatic ($g^\prime$ band) observations from many observing runs and re-determine $\theta$ for 17 standard stars. The CDM algorithm was then integrated into a fitting routine and used to establish the impact of stellar variability on the measured position angle scatter. The approach yields variability detections for stars on long time scales that appear stable over short runs. The best position angle standards are $\ell$ Car, $o$ Sco, HD 154445, HD 161056 and $\iota^1$ Sco which are stable to $\leq$ 0.123$^\circ$. Position angle variability of 0.27-0.82$^\circ$, significant at the 3-$\sigma$ level, is found for 5 standards, including the Luminous Blue Variable HD 160529 and all but one of the other B/A-type supergiants (HD 80558, HD 111613, HD 183143 and 55 Cyg), most of which also appear likely to be variable in polarization magnitude ($p$) - there is no preferred orientation for the polarization in these objects, which are all classified as $\alpha$ Cygni variables. Despite this we make six key recommendations for observers - relating to data acquisition, processing and reporting - that will allow them to use these standards to achieve $<$ 0.1$^\circ$ precision in the telescope position angle with similar instrumentation, and allow data sets to be combined more accurately.

 - **Abstract**
 The INTEGRAL satellite has collected a large amount of data on magnetars in our Galaxy, spanning more than 20 years starting from 2003. The large data set obtained with the IBIS/ISGRI instrument at energies above 20 keV allows us to study both the properties and long-term evolution of their persistent hard X-ray emission and the population characteristics of the short bursts emitted during active periods. We are carrying out a comprehensive analysis of the observed magnetars, exploiting the most recent calibrations and analysis software. Here we report on the long term evolution of the hard X-ray flux of the magnetars detected with ISGRI and the results of a sensitive search for short bursts in SGR J1935+2154.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Mass is the most critical physical parameter in the evolution of a star. Since stars form in clusters their Initial Mass Function (IMF) is decisive in their evolution. Aims. Use Gaia DR3-based stellar masses_mass flame and the stellar members found for fifteen nearby open clusters from Paper I, to estimate their mass segregation and distribution. Methods. For each cluster, the single stars' main sequence was fitted with a moving straight line weighted fit to the Color-Magnitude Diagram, stars brighter than the residuals dispersion were taken as binaries. Single stars masses were obtained from a cubic spline fit to the mass_flame vs. G magnitude data. For binary stars, the individual masses of each component were estimated using simulated-based inference. We used the minimum spanning tree concept to measure the mass segregation of each cluster. From the stellar mass distribution, an estimate of the power-law coefficient that best describes it was used to characterize the IMF. Results. Mass segregation is visible in all the clusters, the older ones have about 50% of their most massive stars segregated, while younger ones extend from about 30% to 55%. The IMF of the studied clusters is well described by a power-law of index 2.09. Conclusions. Significant mass segregation, from one-third to one-half of its most massive population is present in open clusters as young as > 10 Myr. Mass segregation may be strong for only a few of the most massive stars or less intense but extended to a larger fraction of those, it may start as early as 0.20 of the relaxation time of the cluster and progress over time by increasing both the number of the most massive stars affected and their amount of segregation. Older open clusters show evidence of binary disruption as time progresses.

 We present measurements of the microlensing optical depth and event rate toward the Galactic bulge using the dataset from the 2006--2014 MOA-II survey, which covers 22 bulge fields spanning ~42 deg^2 between -5 deg < l < 10 deg and -7 deg < b < -1 deg. In the central region with |l|<5 deg, we estimate an optical depth of {\tau} = [1.75+-0.04]*10^-6exp[(0.34+-0.02)(3 deg-|b|)] and an event rate of {\Gamma} = [16.08+-0.28]*10^-6exp[(0.44+-0.02)(3 deg-|b|)] star^-1 year^-1 using a sample consisting of 3525 microlensing events, with Einstein radius crossing times of tE < 760 days and source star magnitude of IsWe confirm our results are consistent with the latest measurements from OGLE-IV 8 year dataset (Mróz et al. 2019). We find our result is inconsistent with a prediction based on Galactic models, especially in the central region with |b|<3 deg. These results can be used to improve the Galactic bulge model, and more central regions can be further elucidated by future microlensing experiments, such as The PRime-focus Infrared Microlensing Experiment (PRIME) and Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope.
#### Detection of the extended $\gamma$-ray emission from the new supernova remnant G321.3-3.9 with Fermi-LAT

 - **Abstract**
 With the 15 yrs of Pass 8 data recorded by the {\em Fermi} Large Area Telescope, we report the detection of an extended gigaelectronvolt emission component with a 68\% containment radius of $0^{\circ}\!.85$, which is spatially associated with the newly identified supernova remnant (SNR) G321.3-3.9. The $\gamma$-ray spectrum is best described by a log-parabola model in the energy range of 100 MeV - 1 TeV, which shows a significant spectral curvature at $\sim$ 1 GeV. Either a leptonic or a hadronic model could explain the multi-wavelength data of G321.3-3.9, while the leptonic model predicts a too low strength of magnetic field. Also considering the flat radio spectrum of G321.3-3.9 and the $\gamma$-ray upper limit in the low energy band, the hadronic model is favored. The spatial coincidence between the $\gamma$-ray morphology and the diffuse thermal X-ray emission of G321.3-3.9 and the curved gigaelectronvolt $\gamma$-ray spectrum of it make G321.3-3.9 to be similar to the typical middle-aged SNRs interacting with molecular clouds. Such characteristics provide another evidence of the potential hadronic origin for its $\gamma$-ray emission. While there is no molecular cloud detected around G321.3-3.9, which challenges the hadronic model.

 - **Abstract**
 The initial spin periods of newborn magnetars are \textbf{strongly associated with the origin of their strong magnetic fields, both of which can affect the electromagnetic radiation and gravitational waves (GWs) emitted at their birth.} Combining the upper limit $E_{\rm SNR}\lesssim10^{51}$ erg on the explosion energies of \textbf{the supernova (SN) remnants around slowly-spinning magnetars} with a detailed investigation on the evolution of newborn magnetars, we set constraints on the initial spin periods of magnetars \textbf{born in weak SN explosions}. Depending on the conversion efficiency $\eta$ of the electromagnetic energy of \textbf{these} newborn magnetars into the kinetic energy of SN ejecta, the minimum initial spin periods of \textbf{these} newborn magnetars are $P_{\rm i, min}\simeq 5-6$ ms for an ideal efficiency $\eta=1$, $P_{\rm i, min}\simeq 3-4$ ms for a possible efficiency $\eta=0.4$, and $P_{\rm i, min}\simeq 1-2$ ms for a relatively low efficiency $\eta=0.1$. \textbf{Based on these constraints and adopting reasonable values for the physical parameters of the newborn magnetars, we find that their GW radiation at $\nu_{\rm e,1}=\nu$ may be undetectable by the Einstein Telescope (ET) since the maximum signal-to-noise ratio (${\rm S/N}$) is only 2.41 even the sources are located at a very close distance of 5 Mpc, where $\nu$ are the spin frequencies of the magnetars. At such a distance, the GWs emitted at $\nu_{\rm e,2}=2\nu$ from the newborn magnetars with dipole fields $B_{\rm d}=5\times10^{14}$ and $10^{15}$ G may be detectable by the ET because ${\rm S/N}$ are 10.01 and 19.85, respectively. However, if these newborn magnetars are located at $20$ Mpc away in the Virgo supercluster, no GWs could be detected by the ET due to low ${\rm S/N}$.
#### Constraints on the internal physics of neutron stars from the observational data of several young pulsars: the role of a power-law decaying dipole magnetic field

 - **Abstract**
 The observational data (e.g., the timing data and magnetic tilt angles $\chi$) of young pulsars can be used to probe some critical issues about the internal physics of neutron stars (NSs), for instance, the number of precession cycles $\xi$ and the internal magnetic field configuration (IMFC) of NSs. Evolution of the dipole magnetic field $B_{\rm d}$ of NSs may play an important role in determining the final results. In this work, a power-law form is adopted to describe the decay of $B_{\rm d}$. In such a scenario, the IMFC and $\xi$ of young pulsars with an ordinary $B_{\rm d}\sim10^{12}-\-10^{13}$ G and a steady braking index $n$ are investigated. Since the tilt angle change rates $\dot{\chi}$ of pulsars with $n<3$ can be theoretically predicted, a test on the power-law decay model can thus be made by comparing the theoretical values to that obtained from observations. However, such a comparison can only be made on the Crab pulsar currently, and the results show that the power-law decay model is inconsistent with the Crab's observations. We suggest that rather than decay, the Crab's $B_{\rm d}$ should increase with time at a rate $\sim12-14$ G/s. A definite conclusion on the validity of the power-law decay model for pulsars with ordinary $B_{\rm d}$ may be given if $\dot{\chi}$ of other pulsars could be measured.

 - **Abstract**
 We present $[OIII]/H_{\rm \beta}$ emision line flux ratio predictions for galaxies at $z \sim 7-9$ using the MAPPINGS V v5.2.0 photoionization modelling code combined with an analytic galaxy formation model. Properties such as pressure and ionization parameter that determine emission line properties are thought to evolve towards high redshift. In order to determine the range of expected interstellar conditions we extend previous modelling of the Star Formation Rate Density (SFRD) function to calculate the metallicity and ionization parameter, and incorporate the potential impact of turbulence on the density of the ISM. To validate our emission line predictions we calculate the [OIII] line luminosity and its dependence on UV luminosity, as well as the flux ratio $[OIII]/H_{\rm \beta}$ and its variation with the line luminosity, finding that both reproduce recent JWST observations from the FRESCO survey. We also use our model to predict the number counts of emission line galaxies across a range of redshift as well as the dependence of $[OIII]/H_{\rm \beta}$ on ionization parameter and metallicity. Finally, we show that the dependence of flux ratio on luminosity may provide a diagnostic of turbulent motion in galactic discs.
#### Investigating the neutron star physics through observations of several young pulsars in the dipole-field re-emergence scenario

 - **Abstract**
 The observed timing data, magnetic tilt angle $\chi$, and age of young pulsars could be used to probe some important issues about neutron star (NS) physics, e.g., the NS internal magnetic field configuration, and the number of precession cycles $\xi$. \textbf{Both} quantities are critical in studying the continuous gravitational wave emission from pulsars, and the latter generally characterizes the mutual interactions between superfluid neutrons and other particles in the NS interior. The timing behavior of pulsars can be influenced by the dipole field evolution, which instead of decaying, may increase with time. An increase in the dipole field may result from the re-emergence of the initial dipole field $B_{\rm d,i}$ that was buried into the NS interior shortly after the birth of the NS. In this work, the field re-emergence scenario $\xi$ and the internal field configuration of several young pulsars, as well as their $B_{\rm d, i}$ are investigated by assuming typical accreted masses $\Delta M$. Moreover, since the Crab pulsar has an exactly known age and its tilt angle change rate can be inferred from observations, we can set stringent constraints on its $\xi$, $B_{\rm d,i}$, and $\Delta M$. Although for other young pulsars without exactly known ages and tilt angle change rates, these quantities cannot be accurately determined, we find that their $\xi$ are generally within $\sim10^4-10^6$, and some of them probably have magnetar-strength $B_{\rm d,i}$. Our work could be important for investigating the transient emissions associated with NSs, the origin of strong magnetic fields of NSs, pulsar population, continuous gravitational wave emission from pulsars, and accretion under extreme conditions in principle.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze the evolution of red and blue galaxies in different cosmic web environments from redshift $z=3$ to $z=0$ using the IllustrisTNG simulation. We use Otsu's method to classify the red or blue galaxies at each redshift and determine their geometric environments from the eigenvalues of the deformation tensor. Our analysis shows that initially, blue galaxies are more common in clusters followed by filaments, sheets and voids. However, this trend reverses at lower redshifts, with red fractions rising earlier in denser environments. At $z<1$, most massive galaxies ($\log(\frac{M_{*}}{M_{\odot}})>10.5$) are quenched across all environments. In contrast, low-mass galaxies ( $\log(\frac{M_{*}}{M_{\odot}})<10.5$) are more influenced by their environment, with clusters hosting the highest red galaxy fractions at low redshifts. We observe a slower mass growth for low-mass galaxies in clusters at $z<1$. Filaments show relative red fractions (RRF) comparable to clusters at low masses, but host nearly $60\%$ of low-mass blue galaxies, representing a diverse galaxy population. It implies that less intense environmental quenching in filaments allows galaxies to experience a broader range of evolutionary stages. Despite being the densest environment, clusters display the highest relative blue fraction (RBF) for high-mass galaxies, likely due to interactions or mergers that can temporarily rejuvenate star formation in some of them. The $(u-r)$ colour distribution transitions from unimodal to bimodal by redshift $z=2$ across all environments. At $z<1$, clusters exhibit the highest median colour and lowest median specific star formation rate (sSFR), with stellar mass being the primary driver of colour evolution in massive galaxies. Our study suggests that stellar mass governs quenching in high-mass galaxies, while a complex interplay of mass and environment shapes the evolution of low-mass galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar magnetic activity follows regular cycles of about 11 years with an inversion of polarity in the poles every 22 years. This changing surface magnetism impacts the properties of the acoustic modes. The acoustic mode frequency shifts are a good proxy of the magnetic cycle. In this Letter we investigate solar magnetic activity cycles 23 and 24 through the evolution of the frequency shifts of low-degree modes (l= 0, 1, and 2) in three frequency bands. These bands probe properties between 74 and 1575 km beneath the surface. The analysis was carried out using observations from the space instrument Global Oscillations at Low Frequency and the ground-based Birmingham Solar Oscillations Network and Global Oscillation Network Group. The frequency shifts of radial modes suggest that changes in the magnetic field amplitude and configuration likely occur near the Sun's surface rather than near its core. The maximum shifts of solar cycle 24 occurred earlier at mid and high latitudes (relative to the equator) and about 1550 km beneath the photosphere. At this depth but near the equator, this maximum aligns with the surface activity but has a stronger magnitude. At around 74 km deep, the behaviour near the equator mirrors the behaviour at the surface, while at higher latitudes, it matches the strength of cycle 23.

 - **Abstract**
 Deneb (alpha Cygni) is a bright (V magnitude 1.25) blue-white supergiant (spectral type A2 Ia) which shows variability in both radial velocity and photometric measurements. H. Abt reviewed radial velocity measurements by Paddock (1935) using the Lick observatory 36-inch telescope spectrograph during 1927-1935. Abt noticed resumptions of pulsations with a dominant quasi-period of around 12 days that occur at intervals of around 70 days, and damp out after a few cycles. These resumptions appear to happen at arbitrary phase. Perhaps another event like this was captured in a shorter series of radial velocity measurements by Abt in 1956. We examined subsequent radial velocity and photometric data available in the literature, along with photometric measurements by the TESS spacecraft and V-magnitude observations by AAVSO observers. We find some evidence for periodic resumptions of larger-amplitude pulsations in these data. However, longer contiguous data sets combined with more frequent sampling are needed to confirm this periodicity in resumption of pulsations, and to help answer many more questions about Deneb and the alpha Cygni variables.

 - **Abstract**
 An unresolved question in studies of active galactic nuclei (AGN) is whether their different classes probe different evolutionary stages of black hole--host galaxy interaction. We present the projected two-point cross-correlation function between a sample of Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI)-matched AGN selected from Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) optical + Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer ($WISE$) mid-IR photometry, and DESI-designated luminous red galaxies, for $z\in 0.5-1.0$. The total overlap area is 43.4 deg$^2$, including $\sim27,000$ spectroscopic LRGs in our redshift range. We visually classified 1,991 matched HSC-DESI objects in our redshift range, spectroscopically confirming that 1,517 ($76\%$) of them are AGN. Of these 1,517 objects, $73\%$ are broad-line AGN, $27\%$ are obscured AGN. We infer that the parent HSC+$WISE$ AGN catalog has a number density of at least $\sim 240$ deg$^{-2}$, confirming it is one of the most complete optical/infrared AGN catalog to date. We investigate the AGN clustering as a function of the spectroscopic classification and infer the halo mass for each sample. The inferred average mass of the halos $\langle M_h\rangle$ that host unobscured broad-line AGN ($M_h \approx 10^{13.4}h^{-1}M_\odot$) is $\sim 5.5\times$ larger than the halos that host obscured AGN ($M_h \approx 10^{12.6}\, h^{-1}M_\odot$), at $2.8\sigma$ significance, in the same sense as our prior work based on photometric redshifts. This suggests that we may relax our concerns about systematic shifts in the inferred redshift distribution producing this halo mass difference. While we do not yet find statistically significant spectroscopic evidence that unobscured AGN reside in more massive halos than their obscured counterparts, further analyses are necessary to distinguish if more complex evolutionary histories are needed to model these AGN populations.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the properties of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) is key for many aspects of planetary science, particularly planetary defense. Our current knowledge of NEA sizes and regolith properties is heavily dependent on simple thermal models. These models are often used to analyze data from missions such as NEOWISE because they are well suited to deal with large volumes of data. However, simple model results based on NEOWISE data may be inconsistent with results based on other types of observation in some cases. In this work, we seek to better understand these potential inconsistencies, as well as the situations for which they are most prevalent. We do this by comparing simple model results based on Infrared Telescope Facility SpeX data to similar results based on NEOWISE data. This is carried out for six NEAs that represent a range of spectral types, shapes, and rotation states. We find that models based on SpeX and NEOWISE data for these six objects are inconsistent in some cases, even though the SpeX results are consistent with other methods and observations. We find that objects observed at fainter magnitudes and objects with more primitive compositions are more likely to produce inconsistent fits. These results highlight the importance of better understanding the limitations of simple models as applied to large survey data sets like NEOWISE. This is particularly true as we move into an era where our understanding of the NEA population will be dominated by future large surveys such as NEO Surveyor.

 - **Abstract**
 The measurement of type Ia supernovae magnitudes provides cosmological distances, which can be used to constrain dark energy parameters. Large photometric surveys require a substantial improvement in the calibration precision of their photometry to reduce systematic uncertainties in cosmological constraints. The StarDICE experiment is designed to establish accurate broadband flux references for these surveys, aiming for sub-percent precision in magnitude measurements. This requires a precise measurement of the filter bandpasses of both the StarDICE and survey instruments with sub-nanometer accuracy. To that end, we have developed the Collimated Beam Projector (CBP), an optical device capable of calibrating the throughput of an astronomical telescope and of its filters. The CBP is built from a tunable laser source and a reversed telescope to emit a parallel monochromatic light beam that is continuously monitored in flux and wavelength. The CBP output light flux is measured using a large area photodiode, previously calibrated relative to a NIST photodiode. We derive the StarDICE telescope throughput and filter transmissions from the CBP measurements, anchoring it to the absolute calibration provided by the NIST. After analyzing the systematic uncertainties, we achieved sub-nanometer accuracy in determining filter central wavelengths, measured each filter transmission with a precision of 0.5% per 1nm bin, and detected out-of-band leakages at 0.01%. Furthermore, we have synthesized the equivalent transmission for full pupil illumination from four sample positions in the StarDICE telescope mirror, with an accuracy of approximately 0.2nm for central wavelengths and 7mmag for broadband fluxes. We demonstrated our ability to characterize a telescope throughput down to the mmag, and paved the way for future developments, such as a portable CBP version for in-situ transmission monitoring.
