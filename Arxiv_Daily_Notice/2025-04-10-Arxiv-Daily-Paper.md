 - **Abstract**
 We present a new, Bayesian analysis of the highest-resolution optical spectrum of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) binary candidate PG 1302-102, obtained with ESPRESSO@VLT (R \simeq 138, 000). Our methodology, based on robust Bayesian model selection, reveals the presence of multiple narrow emission lines at the expected redshift of the source and confirms (for H\{beta}) and detects (for H{\gamma}) the presence of redshifted broad components. Additionally, we have discovered a very broad and, if it is associated with the H\{beta}, very redshifted component at {\lambda} \simeq 5000Å. We evaluate two scenarios for explaining the observed broad emission line (BEL) in PG 1302-102. In the case in which the redshifted BEL asymmetry arises from the orbital motion of a putative binary, our measurements coupled with simple estimates of the broad-line region (BLR) sizes suggest that the individual black hole BLRs are either settled in a single BLR or in the process of merging and, therefore truncated and highly disturbed. Alternatively, in the scenario of a single SMBH, we explain the distorted emission of the BELs with a nonsymmetric distribution of the BLR clouds; namely, a thin disk with a spiral perturbation. This BLR configuration is statistically preferred over any empirical multi-Gaussian fit and simultaneously explains the asymmetric emission of the H{\beta} and H{\gamma} close to the bulk of the line and any additional excess (or the lack of it, in the case of the H{\gamma}) at much longer wavelengths. The physical origins of the perturbation are unclear, and a connection with the possible presence of a black hole binary cannot be ruled out. Given the growing evidence from theoretical and observational works demonstrating the common presence of disturbed BLRs in active galactic nuclei, we argue that an origin related to self-gravitating instabilities may be more plausible.
#### Positive Feedback II: How Dust Coagulation inside Vortices Can Form Planetesimals at Low Metallicity

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of planetesimals ($\sim$100 km planet building blocks) has confounded astronomers for decades, as numerous growth barriers appear to impede their formation. In a recent paper we proposed a novel interaction where the streaming instability (SI) and dust coagulation work in tandem, with each one changing the environment in a way that benefits the other. This mechanism proved effective at forming planetesimals in the fragmentation-limited inner disk, but much less effective in the drift-limited outer disk, concluding that dust traps may be key to forming planets at wide orbital separations. Here we explore a different hypothesis: That vortices host a feedback loop in which a vortex traps dust, boosting dust coagulation, which in turn boosts vortex trapping. We combine an analytic model of vortex trapping with an analytic model of fragmentation limited grain growth that accounts for how dust concentration dampens gas turbulence. We find a powerful synergy between vortex trapping and dust growth. For $\alpha \le 10^{-3}$ and solar-like metallicity this feedback loop consistently takes the grain size and dust density into the planetesimal formation region of the streaming instability (SI). Only in the regime of strong turbulence ($\alpha \ge 3\times 10^{-3}$) does the system often converge to a steady state below the SI criterion. The combination of vortex trapping with dust coagulation is an even more powerful mechanism than the one involving the SI. It is effective at lower metallicity and across the whole disk -- anywhere that vortices form.

 - **Abstract**
 Environmental quenching -- where interactions with other galaxies and/or the intra-cluster medium (ICM) suppress star formation in low-mass galaxies -- has long been proposed as the primary driver to establish the red sequence for low-mass galaxies within clusters at low redshift ($z<1$). However, we still do not know whether these environmental quenching mechanisms are also active at higher redshifts in proto-cluster environments that have yet to fully virialize. In large part, this regime has remained unexplored due to observational limitations; however, the James Webb Space Telescope has recently opened a new window into the role of environmental quenching on low-mass (log(M$_{\star}$/M$_{\odot}$)$<$9.5) galaxies at cosmic noon ($2 < z < 3$). Here, we use data from the JWST UNCOVER and MegaScience programs to directly probe the role of environmental quenching on low-mass galaxies in a newly-discovered $z\approx 2.6$ overdensity. Leveraging the deep imaging and R $\sim$ 15 spectrophotometry enabled by these JWST/NIRCam data, we analyze the stellar populations and inferred star formation histories (SFHs) of 20 low-mass (8.5$<$log(M$_{\star}$/M$_{\odot}$)$\leq$9.0) quiescent galaxies in the overdense environment and compare to a similar sample of 18 such galaxies in the field. The SFHs of quiescent galaxies in the proto-cluster and field across the entire probed stellar mass regime (8.5$<$log(M$_{\star}$/M$_{\odot}$)$\leq$11.0) are indistinguishable, demonstrating that the environment at cosmic noon is not yet accelerating quenching compared to the field. This is consistent with expectations that proto-clusters at $z>2$ have yet to virialize and develop a dense enough environment to efficiently quench low-mass galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 Active galactic nuclei (AGN) can accelerate protons to energies of $\sim$ 10-100 TeV, with secondary production of high-energy neutrinos. If the acceleration is driven by magnetized turbulence, the main properties of the resulting proton and neutrino spectra can be deduced based on insights from particle-in-cell simulations of magnetized turbulence. We have previously shown that these properties are consistent with the TeV~neutrino signal observed from the nearby active galaxy NGC 1068. In this work, we extend this result to a population study. We show that the produced neutrino flux depends mainly on the energetics of the corona -- the relative fraction of X-ray, magnetic, and non-thermal proton energy -- and on the spectral energy distribution of the AGN. We find that coronae with similar properties can explain neutrinos from the candidate AGN for which IceCube has reported an excess, albeit less significant than NGC 1068. Building on this framework, we show how the neutrino signal evolves with the AGN luminosity, and use this AGN sequence to predict the diffuse neutrino flux from the extragalactic population, showing that it can account for the diffuse neutrino signal observed by IceCube in the $\sim$1-100 TeV energy range.
#### Can a time evolving, asymmetric broad line region mimic a massive black hole binary?

 - **Abstract**
 Gas within the influence sphere of accreting massive black holes is responsible for the emission of the broad lines observed in optical-UV spectra of unobscured active galactic nuclei. Since the region contributing the most to the broad emission lines (i.e. the broad line region) depends on the active galactic nucleus luminosity, the study of broad line reverberation to a varying continuum can map the morphology and kinematics of gas at sub-pc scales. In this study, we modify a preexisting model for disc-like broad line regions, including non-axisymmetric structures, by adopting an emissivity profile that mimics the observed luminosity-radius relation. This makes our implementation particularly well suited for the analysis of multi-epoch spectroscopic campaigns. After validating the model, we use it to check if strongly non-axisymmetric, single broad line regions could mimic the short time-scale evolution expected from massive black hole binaries. We explore different orientations and anisotropy degrees of the broad line region, as well as different light curve patterns of the continuum to which the broad line region responds. Our analysis confirms that recently proposed algorithms designed to search for massive black hole binaries in large multi-epoch spectroscopic data are not contaminated by false positives ascribed to anisotropic broad line regions around single MBHs.
#### MACER3D -- an upgrade of MACER2D with enhanced subgrid models and gas physics -- and its application to simulating AGN feedback in a massive elliptical galaxy

 - **Abstract**
 We present MACER3D (Multiscale AGN-regulated Cosmic Ecosystem Resolver in 3D), a new suite of three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations that study active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback on galactic scales over Gyr duration, with major enhancement in subgrid models and gas physics over its predecessor -- MACER (Massive AGN Controlled Ellipticals Resolved) which is in two dimensions (hereafter MACER2D). MACER3D resolves gas dynamics from within the Bondi radius ($\sim 25\,\mathrm{pc}$) to halo scales. Combined with black hole accretion theory, it enables an accurate calculation of AGN outputs and subsequently their large-scale feedback effects. We present results from simulating an isolated elliptical galaxy with different feedback configurations. In the fiducial model with both AGN and supernova (SN) feedback, the temporal evolution of AGN luminosity and star formation rate are strongly correlated, suggesting shared dependence on the availability of gas supply for SMBH accretion and star formation. AGN duty cycles of several percent with a single-cycle timescale of $\sim 10^2\,\mathrm{Myr}$ agree with observations, while models with only AGN or SN feedback fail to reproduce observed cycles. While all models maintain a quiescent galaxy state, fiducial AGN+SN feedback model results in higher star formation than no-SN feedback, suggesting SN feedback, when acting synergistically with AGN feedback, may positively impact star formation. Combined AGN and SN feedback enhances halo-scale metal enrichment compared to single-feedback models. The simulated X-ray properties match observations and predict transient cavities produced by cold-mode AGN winds from past burst events. The differences between the results obtained by MACER2D and MACER3D are also discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 The properties of active region nests -- locations on the Sun with recurring flux emergence -- are poorly constrained by observations from Earth alone. ESA's Solar Orbiter now monitors the Sun's far-side for extended periods of time; facilitating observations of the entire Sun. We combined observations from near-Earth satellites and Solar Orbiter to evaluate the contribution of a long-lived active region nest to the Sun's global flaring activity. We identified a location in Carrington coordinates with episodic bursts of flux emergence throughout 2022. The combined observations allowed near-continuous monitoring of this region from April to October; during its most active period. GOES and SolO/STIX were used to compare its flaring activity to that of the entire Sun. The region's morphology was extracted from SDO/AIA and SolO/EUI extreme ultraviolet images and combined with magnetic field measurements from SDO/HMI and SolO/PHI to assess its unsigned magnetic flux. The active region nest grew in complexity from January to May due to repeated flux emergence events; with a peak unsigned magnetic flux of $5\times10^{22}$Mx. The region was responsible for 40% of the observed solar flares in 2022, including five months where it produced 50-70% of all flares over the entire Sun (during the near-continuous monitoring window). Of the 17 complex flaring NOAA active regions in 2022 this region contained 10 but occupied less than 20% of the area in the active latitudes. Active region nests can maintain a high rate of flaring activity for several solar rotations and are more likely to produce complex active regions that can trigger X-class solar flares. Improving the identification and monitoring of long-lived active region nests would benefit short to medium term space weather forecasts.
#### MOA-2010-BLG-328: Keck and HST Expose the Limits of Occams Razor in Microlensing

 - **Abstract**
 We present high resolution follow-up data of the planetary microlensing event MOA-2010-BLG-328, using Keck and the Hubble. Keck data, taken 8 years after the event, reveal a strong lens detection enabling a direct measurement of lens flux and source-lens relative proper motion. We find the relative source-lens proper motion to be $\mu_{\rm rel, Hel} = 4.07 \pm 0.34\ \rm mas\ yr^{-1}$, with the lens being $\sim10$ times fainter than the source. The lens was very faint in the Hubble passbands, and the small lens-source separation of $\sim$35 mas made its detection difficult. However, we obtained estimates of the lens magnitudes in Hubble bands by constraining its location to match the Keck K-band detection. The original analysis by \citet{Furusawa2013} reports a degenerate light curve, with several viable models depending on higher-order effects. We attempt to break the degeneracy by remodeling the event using constraints from follow-up data. Our best fit model includes parallax, orbital motion, xallarap and the magnification of a source companion. Models omitting any of these are excluded. However, even with a lens detection the solution remains unclear, as the degeneracy between a nearby late M dwarf and a distant early M dwarf in the disk persists, and cannot be broken with NIR data alone. We conclude the lens is either a $\sim0.2\ M_{\odot}$ star at $2-3$kpc, or a $\sim0.5\ M_{\odot}$ star at $4-5$kpc. This study highlights the importance of multi-band data and comprehensive modeling to resolve microlensing degeneracies.
#### Quadrupole signature as a kinematic diagnostic to constrain bar properties : implication for the Milky Way

 - **Abstract**
 The presence of a 'butterfly' or a quadrupole structure in the stellar mean radial velocity field of the Milky Way is well known from the Gaia and the APOGEE surveys. Past studies indicated that a stellar bar can excite such a quadrupole feature in the $<V_R>$ distribution. However, a systematic study investigating the co-evolution of bar and quadrupole structure is largely missing. Furthermore, whether this quadrupole structure in $<V_R>$ can be used as a robust kinematic diagnostic to constrain bar properties, particularly for the Milky Way, is still beyond our grasp. Here, we investigate the bar-induced quadrupole feature using a suite of isolated N-body models forming prominent bars and a sample of Milky Way-like barred galaxies from the TNG50 cosmological simulation. We demonstrate that the properties of the quadrupole (strength, length, and orientation) are strongly correlated with the bar properties, regardless of the choice of the stellar tracer population; thereby making the quadrupole feature an excellent kinematic diagnostic for constraining the bar properties. In presence of spirals, the estimator which takes into account the phase-angle of m=4 Fourier moment, serves as a more appropriate estimator for measuring the length of the quadrupole. Further, we constructed a novel Gaia-like mock dataset from a simulated bar model while incorporating the dust extinction and the broad trends of observational errors of the Gaia survey. The quadrupole properties (strength and length) estimated from those Gaia-like mock data are larger (~35-45 percent) when compared with their true values. We determined that the majority of this effect is due to the uncertainty in parallax measurement. This demonstrates the potential caveat of inferring Milky Way's bar properties by using the stellar kinematic information from the Gaia DR3 without properly accounting for the observational uncertainties.
#### Exploring the dynamical state of Galactic open clusters using Gaia DR3 and observational parameters

 - **Abstract**
 Galactic open clusters (OCs) are subject to internal and external destructive effects that gradually deplete their stellar content, leaving imprints on their structure. To investigate their dynamical state from an observational perspective, we employed Gaia DR3 data to perform a comprehensive analysis of 174 OCs (~10% of Dias et al.'s 2021 catalogue). We employed radial density profiles and astrometrically decontaminated colour-magnitude diagrams to derive structural parameters, distance, mass and time-related quantities. We explored the parameters space and searched for connections relating the clusters' structure with the internal evolutionary state and the external Galactic tidal field. Correlations were verified after segregating the sample according to the Galactocentric distance and half-light to Jacobi radius ratio ($r_h/R_J$). This tidal filling ratio decreases with both the cluster mass and dynamical age. At a given evolutionary stage, OCs with larger $r_h/R_J$ tend to present larger fractions of mass loss due to dynamical effects. Regarding the impact of the external conditions, we identified different evaporation regimes: for ambient densities ($\rho_{\rm{amb}}$) larger than ~0.1M$_{\odot}$/pc$^3$, clusters tend to be more tidally filled as they are subject to weaker tidal stresses. For $\rho_{\rm{amb}}$ $\lesssim$ 0.1M$_{\odot}$/pc$^3$, the opposite occurs: $R_J$ increases for smaller $\rho_{\rm{amb}}$, causing $r_h/R_J$ to decrease. In turn, two-body relaxation tends to compact the cluster core, which is less sensitive to variations of the external potential. The higher the degree of central concentration, the larger the number of relaxation times a cluster takes until its dissolution.

 - **Abstract**
 We preform a systematic search for galactic-scale quasar pairs and small-scale (<3 arcsec) lenses using the SDSS DR16 quasar catalog and Gaia DR3. Candidate double quasars (both are unobscured) are identified as Gaia resolved pairs around spectroscopically confirmed SDSS quasars ($L_{\rm bol} > 10^{44.5} \ {\rm erg \ s^{-1}}$) at $0.5 < z \lesssim 4.5$. Gaia astrometric information and SDSS spectral decomposition are used to exclude foreground star superpositions, which dominate ($\gtrsim 80\%$ of) the pair sample. We identify $136$ double quasar candidates from $1120$ Gaia-resolved pairs after a magnitude and redshift cut of $G<20.5$ and $z>0.5$ (803 double quasars out of 2,497 pairs without any cuts applied) with separations of $\sim$ 0.3 - 3 arcsec, corresponding to projected physical separations of $\sim$ 3 - 30 kpc at the median redshift of the sample of $z = 1.7$. We estimate an overall double quasar (lens and physical pairs combined) fraction using this sample, corrected for pair-resolving completeness, of $5.7_{-0.3}^{+0.3} \times 10^{-4}$ (bootstrapping errors). This double quasar fraction increases toward smaller separations, consistent with earlier findings. We also find little redshift evolution of the double quasar fraction for the luminous SDSS sample, consistent with previous observations and simulation predictions. However, the observed fraction is lower than simulation predictions by $\sim$0.8 - 1.6 dex, suggesting a significant population of obscured quasar pairs are missed in our search. Future wide-area space missions targeting both unobscured and obscured quasar pairs at sub-arcsec resolutions will reveal this population of obscured quasar pairs, and extend to much lower AGN luminosities.

 - **Abstract**
 Super-sensitive observations of bright pulsars by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) have revealed weak radio emission continuously emerged in the rotation phases between the main pulse and interpulse of an rotating neutron star. We develop a model for the polarized radio emission radiated from different heights in the pulsar magnetosphere and examine emission intensity distribution over the whole rotation phases of pulsars seen from all directions by the line of sight. We find that for pulsars with small periods and the magnetosphere filled with much more relativistic particles, the polarized radio emission can be generated in all rotation phases for both the aligned and perpendicular rotating neutron stars. When the line of sight cuts the pulsar emission beam between the rotation and magnetic axes, the polarization angles have the same sense of variation gradient for the ``main'' pulse and ``interpulse''. If the line of sight cuts the beams between the inclined magnetic axis and the equator, the opposite senses can be found for the main pulse and interpulse. In addition to the pulsed emission, we find persistent radio emission generated in the pulsar magnetosphere. The model can naturally explain the emission across the entire rotation phases.

 - **Abstract**
 Mergers are fundamental to our understanding of the processes driving the evolution of the structure and morphology of galaxies, star formation, AGN activity, and the redistribution of stellar mass in the Universe. Determining the fraction and properties of mergers across cosmic time is critical to understanding the formation of the Universe we observe today. This fraction and its evolution also provide inputs and constraints for cosmological simulations, crucial for theoretical models of galaxy evolution. We present robust estimates of major close-pair fractions and merger rates at $0.2 < z < 0.9$ in the Deep Extragalactic VIsible Legacy Survey (DEVILS). We identify major mergers by selecting close-pairs with a projected spatial separation $r_{\mathrm{sep}} < 20$ h$^{-1}$ kpc and a radial velocity separation $v_{\mathrm{sep}} < 500$ km s$^{-1}$. For galaxies with stellar masses of log$_{10}$($M_\star$/$M_\odot$) = 10.66 $\pm$ 0.25 dex, we find a major close-pair fraction of $\approx 0.021$ at $0.2 < z < 0.34$ using a highly complete, unbiased spectroscopic sample. We extend these estimates to $0.2 < z < 0.9$ by combining the full probability distribution of redshifts for galaxies with high-quality spectroscopic, photometric, or grism measurements. Fitting a power-law $\gamma_{m} = A(1 + z)^m$, we find $A = 0.024 \pm 0.001$ and $m = 0.55 \pm 0.22$. Consistent with previous results, the shallow slope suggests weak redshift evolution in the merger fraction. When comparing with large hydrodynamical simulations, we also find consistent results. We convert close-pair fractions to merger rates using several literature prescriptions for merger timescales and provide all measurements for future studies.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are bright millisecond radio events of unknown extra-galactic origin. Magnetars are one of the main contenders. Some sources, the repeaters, produce multiple events but so far generally without the characteristic periodicity that one could associate with the spin of a neutron star. We fit a geometrical model to the two main repeaters of the CHIME/FRB catalogue, namely FRB 20180814A and FRB 20180916B. Assuming the bursts originate from a magnetar's magnetosphere, we constrain the spin and magnetic parameters of the star which are encoded into burst spectro-temporal morphologies. We estimate that a very strong toroidal magnetic component together with spin periods of respectively $2.3_{-0.5}^{+0.5} ~ \rm s$ and $0.8_{-0.2}^{+0.1} ~ \rm s$ best explain the data. We argue that this points towards young magnetars with super-twisted magnetospheres.

 - **Abstract**
 The RS CVn type binary star GT Mus was observed during its quiescence using the Resolve X-ray microcalorimeter spectrometer onboard XRISM. The main and satellite lines of the Fe XXIV--XXVI K-shell transitions were resolved for the first time from stellar sources. We conducted line ratio analysis to investigate any deviations from collisional onization equilibrium (CIE) and Maxwell electron energy distribution with a single-temperature. By using five combinations of direct excitation lines and dielectronic recombination satellite lines in three line complexes (Fe He$\alpha$, Ly$\alpha$, and He$\beta$), we found that the plasma is well characterized by two-temperature thermal plasmas with temperatures of 1.7 and 4.3 keV, which is consistent with a thermal broadening of Fe XXV and the broadband fitting results in the 1.7--10 keV band. Other forms of deviation from a single-temperature plasma, such as different ionization and electron temperatures or the $\kappa$ distribution for the electron energy distributions, are not favored, which is reasonable for stellar coronae at quiescence. This study demonstrates the utility of the Fe K-shell line ratio diagnostics to probe plasma conditions using X-ray microcalorimeters.
#### A multi-scale view of the magnetic field morphology in the hot molecular core G31.41+0.31

 - **Abstract**
 Multiscale studies of the morphology and strength of the magnetic field are crucial to properly unveil its role and relative importance in high-mass star and cluster formation. G31.41+0.31 (G31) is a hub-filament system that hosts a high-mass protocluster embedded in a hot molecular core (HMC). G31 is one of the few sources showing a clear hourglass morphology of the magnetic field on scales between 1000 au and a few 100 au in previous interferometric observations. This strongly suggests a field-regulated collapse. To complete the study of the magnetic field properties in this high-mass star-forming region, we carried out observations with the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope $850 \mu$m of the polarized dust emission. These observations had a spatial resolution of $\sim$0.2 pc at 3.75 kpc. The aim was to study the magnetic field in the whole cloud and to compare the magnetic field orientation toward the HMC from $\sim$50,000 au to $\sim$260 au scales. The large-scale ($\sim$5 pc) orientation of the magnetic field toward the position of the HMC is consistent with that observed at the core ($\sim$4,000 au) and circumstellar ($\sim$260 au) scales. The self-similarity of the magnetic field orientation at these different scales might arise from the brightest sources in the protocluster, whose collapse is dragging the magnetic field. These sources dominate the gravitational potential and the collapse in the HMC. The cloud-scale magnetic field strength of the G31 hub-filament system, which we estimated using the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method, is in the range 0.04--0.09 mG. The magnetic field orientation in the star-forming region shows a bimodal distribution, and it changes from an NW--SE direction in the north to an E--W direction in the south [abridged abstract].

 - **Abstract**
 One of the most important effects shaping small-scale galaxy clustering is galaxy assembly bias, which refers to the dependence of galaxy clustering on halo properties. We investigate this effect using galaxy samples selected according to stellar mass, r-band magnitude, and broad-band colors from the largest hydrodynamical simulation of the IllustrisTNG suite. We find that galaxy assembly bias depends strongly upon the selection criteria, number density, and redshift of the sample, increasing or decreasing the clustering by as much as 25%. Interestingly, no single secondary halo property fully captures the strength of this effect for any galaxy population. Therefore, empirical approaches modeling galaxy assembly bias as a function of a single halo property cannot reproduce predictions from hydrodynamical simulations. We then study how galaxy assembly bias emerges from the interplay of halo assembly bias -- the dependence of halo clustering on properties other than mass -- and occupancy variation -- the correlation between galaxy occupation and secondary halo properties -- and provide an analytical expression that predicts the amount of galaxy assembly bias caused by any halo property. This expression facilitates understanding the dependence of galaxy assembly bias on halo properties and enables the straightforward incorporation of this effect into halo model approaches.

 - **Abstract**
 Using cosmological hydrodynamic simulations with radiative transfer, we investigate star formation and overdensity ($\delta$) in Coma-type cluster progenitors from $z=14$ to 6. Our simulations reproduce observed $M_{\rm star}$-SFR relations and $\delta$ at these redshifts. We find: (1) protocluster (PC) and mean-density field (MF) galaxies show similar $M_{\rm star}$-SFR relations, with PC galaxies extending to higher $M_{\rm star}$ and SFR. (2) UV-bright PC galaxies ($M_{\rm UV}\lesssim -20$~mag) have $>2$ mag higher UV attenuation and shallower UV slopes than MF galaxies. (3) $\delta$ increases with redshift, depending on observational parameters (e.g., $\delta\sim50$ at $z=14$ to $\delta\sim3$ at $z=6$ for a search volume of $\sim3000$~cMpc$^3$ and a limiting magnitude of $M_{\rm UV}=-17$~mag). These results indicate that enhanced star formation in PCs is driven by massive galaxy overdensity, not anomalously high specific SFR. While simulated $\delta$ agrees with observed PC candidates (potential Coma progenitors), some MF galaxies show comparable $\delta$. We propose a robust PC identification method using both $\delta$ and $M_{\rm star}$ of the most massive member. Critical $M_{\rm star}$ thresholds for Coma progenitors are estimated ($10^{7.1}$ to $10^{10.2}$ M$_\odot$ from $z=14$ to 6). Comparison with JWST observations suggests GS-z14-0 and GS-z14-1, the current highest redshift holders, are likely progenitors of Coma-type clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 Hot cores represent critical astrophysical environments for high-mass star formation, distinguished by their rich spectra of organic molecular emission lines. We aim to utilize high-angular resolution molecular line data from ALMA to identify hot cores, with a particular focus on weak-emission candidates, and to provide one of the largest samples of hot core candidates. We propose to use spectral stacking and imaging techniques of complex organic molecules (COMs) in the ALMA-ATOMS survey, including line identification & weights, segmentation of line datacubes, resampling, stacking and normalization, moment 0 maps, and data analysis, to search for hot core candidates. We classify cores with dense emission of CH3OH and at least one molecule from the other six molecules as hot core candidates. In addition to the existing sample of 60 strong hot cores from the ALMA-ATOMS survey, we have detected 40 new weak candidates through stacking. All hot core candidates display compact emission from at least one of the other six COM species. For the strong sample, the stacking method provides molecular column density estimates that are consistent with previous fitting results. For the newly identified weak candidates, all species except CH3CHO show compact emission in the stacked image, which cannot be fully resolved spatially. These weak candidates exhibit column densities of COMs that are approximately one order of magnitude lower than those of the strong sample. The entire hot core sample, including the weak candidates, reveals tight correlations between the compact emission of CH3OH and other COM species, suggesting they may share a similar chemical environment for COMs, with CH3OH potentially acting as a precursor for other COMs. The molecular line stacking technique is used to identify hot core candidates in this work, leading to the identification of 40 new hot core candidates.

 - **Abstract**
 It is shown for the first time that the stripped helium stars with masses 2 to 7 solar mass which are formed in close binary systems in the so-called case B of mass-exchange and retained low-mass hydrogen-helium envelopes, experience nonlinear radial pulsations. Pulsations are excited by the kappa-mechanism due to helium ionization. The region of pulsation instability extends over Hertzsprung-Russel diagram from the red giants branch to the region of effective temperatures from about 30,000 K to about 50,000 K. Variations of stellar luminosity should be observed mostly in the ultraviolet. The amplitudes of pulsations of the studied models reach 0.8 stellar magnitude and increase, as the stellar radii decrease. Pulsation periods of stars with effective temperatures exceeding 10,000 K range from 0.17 to 8.5 day and decrease with decreasing radii. The stars have substantially larger effective temperatures than their companions, which could be Be-stars. They are components of relatively wide binaries with orbital periods up to several years. The number of pulsating moderate-mass stripped helium stars in the Galaxy is about 1000.

 - **Abstract**
 The understanding of galaxy properties and evolution is contingent on knowing the initial mass function (IMF), and yet to date, the IMF is constrained only to local galaxies. Individual stars are now becoming routinely detected at cosmological distances, where luminous stars such as supergiants in background galaxies critically lensed by galaxy clusters are temporarily further magnified by huge factors up to $10^{4}$ by intra-cluster stars, thus being detected as transients. The detection rate of these events depends on the abundance of luminous stars in the background galaxy and is thus sensitive to the IMF and the star formation history (SFH), especially for the blue supergiants detected as transients in the rest-frame UV/optical filters. As a proof of concept, we use simple SFH and IMF models constrained by spectral energy distribution (SED) to see how well we can predict the {\it HST} and {\it JWST} transient detection rate in a lensed arc dubbed ``Spock'' ($z = 1.0054$). We find that demanding a simultaneously fit of SED and rest-frame UV/optical transient detection rate places constraints on the IMF, independent of the assumed simple SFH model. We conclude our Bayesian likelihood analysis indicates that the data definitively prefer the ``Spock'' galaxy to have a Salpeter IMF ($\alpha = 2.35$) rather than a Top-heavy IMF ($\alpha = 1$) -- what is thought to be the case in the early universe -- given our methodology and assumptions with no clear excess of supergiants above the standard IMF.

 - **Abstract**
 Highly magnified stars ($\mu$ $>$ 100) are now outinely identified as transient events at cosmological distances thanks to microlensing by intra-cluster stars near the critical curves of galaxy clusters. Using the {\it James Webb} Space Telescope (JWST) in combination with the {\it Hubble} Space Telescope (HST), we outline here an analytical framework that is applied to the Warhol arc (at $z=0.94$) in the MACS 0416 galaxy cluster (at $z=0.396)$ where over a dozen microlensed stars have been detected to date. This method is general and can be applied to other lensed arcs. Within this lensed galaxy we fit the spatially resolved SED spanned by eight JWST-NIRCam filters combined with three ACS filters, for accurate lensed star predictions in 2D. With this tool we can generate 2D maps of microlensed stars for well resolved arcs in general, including dependence on wavelength and limiting apparent magnitude, for comparison with with planned cadenced campaigns for JWST and Hubble, for constraining directly the IMF and the level of dark matter substructure.

 - **Abstract**
 X-ray synchrotron radiation is expected to be highly polarized. Thanks to the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE), it is now possible to evaluate the degree of X-ray polarization in sources such as supernova remnants (SNRs). Jointly using IXPE data and high-resolution Chandra observations, we perform a spatially resolved spectropolarimetric analysis of SNR Cassiopeia A (Cas A). We focus in the 3-6 keV energy band on regions near the shell dominated by nonthermal synchrotron emission. By combining IXPE's polarization sensitivity with Chandra's higher spatial and spectral resolution, we constrain the local polarization degree (PD) and polarization angle (PA) across the remnant. Our analysis reveals PD values ranging locally from 10% to 26%, showing significant regional variations that underscore the complex magnetic field morphology of Cas A. The polarization vectors indicate a predominantly radial magnetic field, consistent with previous studies. Thanks to the improved modeling of thermal contamination using Chandra data, we retrieve higher PD values compared to earlier IXPE analysis and more significant detections with respect to the standard IXPEOBSSIM analysis. Finally, we also estimate the degree of magnetic turbulence {\eta} from the measured photon index and PD, under the assumption of an isotropic fluctuating field across the shell of Cas A.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of our study of ASASSN-14dx, a previously known but poorly characterised cataclysmic variable (CV). The source was observed as part of an ongoing high-time-resolution photometric survey of CVs, which revealed that, in addition to the known 82.8min orbital period, it also exhibits other transient periods, the strongest of which around 4 and 14 min. Here, we report our findings resulting from a multifaceted follow-up programme consisting of optical spectroscopy, spectropolarimetry, imaging polarimetry, and multicolour fast photometry. We find that the source displays complex optical variability, which is best explained by the presence of a massive white dwarf exhibiting non-radial pulsations. An intermediate polar-like scenario involving a spinning magnetic white dwarf can be ruled out based on the detected changes in the observed periods. Based on our optical spectroscopy, we can constrain the mass and effective temperature of the white dwarf to be ~1.1 Msol and 16 100 K, respectively. The overall intrinsic flux level of the source is unusually high, suggesting that there remains significant residual emission from the accretion disc and/or the white dwarf even ten years after the 2014 outburst. Finally, we cannot detect any spectroscopic signatures from the donor star, making ASASSN-14dx a possible period bouncer system evolving towards a longer orbital period.
