#### Positive AGN Feedback Enhances Star Formation in Starburst Dwarf Galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 The role of active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback in dwarf galaxies remains poorly understood, with conventional wisdom suggesting it primarily suppresses star formation. Using high-resolution MACER3D simulations that directly resolve the Bondi radius, we demonstrate that AGN feedback can significantly enhance rather than suppress star formation in starburst dwarf galaxies. Our simulations reveal that AGN feedback increases global star formation rates by approximately 25% when comparing our models with both AGN and supernova feedback to those with only supernova feedback. This enhancement occurs through AGN-driven outflows creating compressed gas regions where efficient cooling preserves the high density while quickly radiating away thermal energy, creating ideal conditions for star formation. This positive feedback mechanism operates in gas-rich starburst environments with efficient cooling and moderate AGN energy input that compresses gas without expelling it from the galaxy. Critically, it requires both AGN and supernova feedback working in concert: without SN feedback to regulate black hole activity, AGN outflows become too powerful and expel gas rather than compress it. Our results closely match observations of the starburst dwarf galaxy Henize 2-10, where similar shock-compressed regions of enhanced star formation have been observed. These findings challenge conventional understanding of AGN feedback and suggest that AGN may play a previously unrecognized role in accelerating star formation during active phases of dwarf galaxy evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way, exhibits daily energetic flares characterized by non-thermal emission in the infrared and X-ray bands. While the underlying accretion flow is a Radiatively Inefficient Accretion Flow (RIAF) peaking at radio frequencies, the mechanism powering these non-thermal transients remains debated. Stellar dynamics predict a population of faint brown dwarfs orbiting Sgr A*. These objects are progenitors of Extremely Large Mass Ratio Inspirals (XMRIs), crucial sources of low-frequency gravitational waves for the future Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission. We investigate whether the tidal stripping of brown dwarfs provides a viable fueling mechanism for the observed flares. Here we present high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations of grazing tidal interactions coupled with a parameterized non-thermal radiation model. We demonstrate that the dynamics of the tidal fallback and subsequent viscous evolution naturally reproduce the fundamental temporal characteristics of observed flares: the peak luminosity and the characteristic 1-hour duration. We show that this fueling mechanism is dynamically viable and energetically consistent, placing strong constraints on the required efficiency of the non-thermal emission process, suggesting extreme radiative inefficiency. These findings provide compelling evidence for a hidden population of brown dwarfs in the Galactic Center. Crucially, the observed high flare frequency implies tight orbits characteristic of advanced inspirals. This establishes a direct link between electromagnetic transients and active gravitational wave sources, alerting the LISA consortium years in advance to the presence of specific XMRI systems promising exceptionally high signal-to-noise ratios for precision tests of general relativity.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Dust grains undergo significant growth in star-forming environments, especially in dense regions prone to gravitational collapse. Although dust is generally assumed to represent $1 \%$ of the gas mass, dust density variations are expected on small scales due to differential dynamics with the gas, leading to enhanced coagulation rates in regions of dust enrichment. Aims: We aim to investigate the clumping of charged dust in the turbulent magnetized dense regions of the interstellar medium. Methods: We develop a dusty model that goes beyond the standard non-ideal MHD and use the code {\ttfamily shark} to perform multifluid 1D simulations of a single size charged dust species and neutral gas with large scale driven turbulence and including ion-neutral friction. Results: We identify a mechanism similar to the parametric instability that efficiently forms dust clumps even in presence of dissipative processes. Such strong clumping survives and is sustained when driving turbulence, and thus high levels of dust concentration are produced due to compressive magnetic effects in regions of shocks. Dust density enhancements are favored by a high transverse-to-longitudinal magnetic ratio which is controlled by: transverse Mach number and plasma parameter. We find that a substantial fraction of dust experiences a density increase of more than a factor of 10 under reasonable conditions, thus promoting dust growth. Conclusion: Our novel dusty non-ideal MHD model shows that dust grains (main charge carriers) are subject to small-scale compressive magnetic effects driven by a parametric instability - like mechanism in regions of shocks, and consequently experience high density enhancements in turbulent environments that go beyond those permitted by pure hydrodynamical processes, making in-situ formation of large grains (sub-mm) in protostellar envelopes a plausible scenario.

 - **Abstract**
 The interaction of post-explosion supernova ejecta with the surrounding circumstellar medium creates emission across the electromagnetic spectrum. Since the circumstellar medium is created by the mass lost from the progenitor star, it carries tell-tale signatures of the progenitor. Consequently, observations and modeling of radiation produced by the interaction in various types of supernovae have provided valuable insights into their progenitors. Detailed studies have shown that the interaction in supernovae begins and sustains over various timescales and lengthscales, with differing mass-loss rates in distinct sub-classes. This reveals diverse progenitor histories for these stellar explosions. This review paper summarizes various supernova subtypes, linking them to stellar death pathways, and presents an updated supernova classification diagram. We then present a multi-wavelength study of circumstellar interaction in different supernova classes. We also present unpublished Chandra X-ray as well as radio observations of a type IIn supernova, SN 2010jl, which allow us to extend its circumstellar interaction studies to about 7 years post-explosion. The new data indicates that the extreme mass-loss rate 0.1 Msun/yr in SN 2010jl, reported by Chandra et al. (2015), commenced within the last 300 years before the explosion. We summarize the current status of the field and argue that via detailed studies of the circumstellar interaction, a.k.a. Time Machine technique, one of the big mysteries of stellar evolution, i.e., mapping supernovae progenitors to their explosive outcomes can be solved.
#### The Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey (NGVS). XL. The Morphological Classification of Virgo Cluster Galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 We present a study of morphologies, based on deep $u^{*}g^{\prime}i^{\prime}z^{\prime}$ imaging of the Virgo Cluster from the Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey (NGVS), for 3689 Virgo cluster members spanning a mass range of $\sim$$10^{11}M_{\odot}$ to $\sim$$10^5~M_{\odot}$. Our analysis introduces a new, two-component visual classification scheme developed to capture the morphological diversity of galaxies over more than six orders of magnitude in stellar mass. Our morphological classifications use two parameters to describe the global structure and star formation activity of each galaxy. Structural sub-codes denote features such as spiral arms, bars, disks, shells, streams, while star formation sub-codes indicate the form and location of the current star formation activity (e.g., in cores, clumps, filaments, etc). These visual classifications rely on deep $g^\prime$-band images, supplemented by $u^{*}g^{\prime}i^{\prime}$ color images, as well as unsharp-masked images for a subset of objects. We compare our classifications to previous results for bright member galaxies that used more established schemes, finding good agreement. We also measure quantitative classification statistics (e.g., CASGM$_{20}$) for a subset of the brighter galaxies, and present catalogs for some galaxy types of special interest, including structurally compact galaxies, ultra-diffuse galaxies, candidate ultra-compact dwarf transition objects, as well as candidate post-merger systems. These morphological classifications may be useful as a training set in the application of machine learning tools to the next generation of wide-field imaging surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 Sunspots are the standard measure of solar magnetic activity, which are also used to estimate solar spectral irradiance over centennial time scales. However, because of the lack of homogeneous, century-long spectral measurements, the long-term relation of sunspots and spectral irradiance has not been independently validated. Here we aim to study the relation between sunspots and solar extreme ultra-violet (EUV) irradiance during the last 130 years, over the latest Gleissberg cycle, also called the Modern Maximum, when sunspot cycle heights varied by a factor of 2.5. We calculate the daily variation of the geomagnetic declination at six reliable, long-running stations, whose amplitude (or range) can be used as a centennial proxy of solar EUV irradiance. We also compare this geomagnetic proxy to the solar MgII index of EUV irradiance over the 40-year interval of overlap. We find that sunspot activity dominated over EUV irradiance when cycle heights increased in the early 20th century during the growth and maximum of the Modern Maximum, but EUV irradiance dominated over sunspots during the decay of the MM, when cycle heights decreased in the late 1900s. Our results suggest that the spot-facula ratio varies during Gleissberg cycle -type large oscillations of solar/stellar activity. This modifies the estimated stellar evolution of the relation between brightness and chromospheric activity of the Sun and Sun-like stars.

 - **Abstract**
 The Catalina Real-time Transient Survey (CRTS) carried out a public survey for optical transients between 2007 and 2019, discovering more than 16,000 transient candidates. Here we present the spectra and highlight the results of the spectroscopic follow-up of CRTS extragalactic transients. As expected, we find that the bulk of these transients are normal supernovae. However, as we prioritised transients exhibiting unusual features or environments during our spectroscopic follow-up, we focus on the rarer types of transients. These objects include more than a dozen type-I superluminous supernovae and dozens of type-I and II supernovae that underwent circumstellar medium interactions. We highlight several specific supernovae, including a new analysis of SN 2008iy, a type-IIn which exhibited a bright pre-supernova outburst event similar to SN 2009ip and lasted more than 1800 days; CSS111225:140122+161705, a type-I supernova that showed an extreme 2.5 magnitude rebrightening event more than 200 days after its initial outburst; and SN 2009ny, a type-Ibn supernova that exhibited strong helium emission lines similar to SN 2002ao. We confirm our previous finding that numerous CRTS transients are associated with galaxies of extremely low luminosity. We discuss the difficulty in determining the origin of transients associated with outbursts in active galactic nuclei (AGN), tidal disruption events, and type-IIn supernovae. As an example, we present CSS150120:110008+385352, a CRTS transient similar to CSS100217:102913+404220 that occurred within a quiescent AGN and peaked at Mv = -23.6.

 - **Abstract**
 The solar wind is a dynamic plasma outflow that shapes heliospheric conditions and drives space weather. Identifying its large-scale phenomena is crucial, yet the increasing volume of high-cadence Parker Solar Probe (PSP) observations poses challenges for scalable, interpretable analysis. We present a pipeline combining symbolic compression, density-based clustering, and human-in-the-loop validation. Applied to 2018-2024 PSP data, it efficiently processes over 150 GB of magnetic and plasma measurements, recovering known structures, detecting uncatalogued CMEs and transient events, and demonstrating robustness across multiple time scales. A key outcome is the systematic use of the magnetic deflection angle ($\theta_B$) as a unifying metric across solar wind phenomena. This framework provides a scalable, interpretable, expert-validated approach to solar wind analysis, producing expanded event catalogs and supporting improved space weather forecasting. The code and configuration files used in this study are publicly available to support reproducibility.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar wind backmapping is a critical technique for analyzing the origin of the solar wind and space weather events by correlating in situ measurements with solar remote-sensing observations. This technique typically traces magnetic field lines using a heliospheric magnetic field (HMF) model coupled with a coronal magnetic field (CMF). However, the impact of different HMF and CMF configurations on backmapping uncentainty-particularly regarding high-latitude solar wind-remains inadequately quantified. This study comprehensively evaluates solar wind backmapping by combining two HMF models (Parker spiral, Fisk-type) with three CMF models (Potential Field Source Surface (PFSS), Potential Field Current Sheet (PFCS), Current Sheet Source Surface (CSSS)). Our analysis primarily uses in situ measurements from Ulysses and remote-sensing data from STEREO-A. Key findings are that: (1) while both Fisk and Parker HMF models show comparable consistency with measured magnetic field strength and polarity, they produce certain longitudinal displacements in their back-mapped footpoints on the source surface (2.5$R_{\odot}$); (2) For CMF models (PFSS, PFCS, CSSS), predicted photospheric footpoints exhibit minor variations for high/mid-latitude solar wind but some divergences for ecliptic/low-latitude wind; (3) All three CMF models link high/mid-latitude wind to active regions or coronal holes, yet associate a fraction of ecliptic/low-latitude wind with quiet-Sun regions; (4) Ecliptic/low-latitude sources show significantly stronger dependence on the PFSS source surface height compared to high-latitude wind. These results demonstrate that simpler models (PFSS + Parker) appear reasonably adequate for polar coronal hole wind studies, while low-latitude/ecliptic solar wind exhibits the heightened sensitivity to model choices.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first experimental evidence for in-ice Askaryan radiation -- coherent charge-excess radio emission -- from high-energy particle cascades developing in the Antarctic ice sheet. In 208 days of data recorded with the phased-array instrument of the Askaryan Radio Array, a previous analysis has incidentally identified 13 events with impulsive radiofrequency signals originating from below the ice surface. We here present a detailed reanalysis of these events. The observed event rate, radiation arrival directions, signal shape, spectral content, and electric field polarization are consistent with in-ice Askaryan radiation from cosmic ray air shower cores impacting the ice sheet. For the brightest events, the angular radiation pattern favors an extended cascade-like emitter over a pointlike source. An origin from the geomagnetic separation of charges in cosmic ray air showers is disfavored by the arrival directions and polarization. Considering the arrival angles, timing properties, and the impulsive nature of the passing events, the event rate is inconsistent with the estimation of the combined background from thermal noise events and on-surface events at the level of $5.1\,\sigma$.
#### Dissipation and particle acceleration at intermittent structures with velocity and magnetic shear: Interaction of Kelvin-Helmholtz and Drift-Kink instabilities

 - **Abstract**
 We present two-dimensional (2D) particle-in-cell simulations of a magnetized, collisionless, relativistic pair plasma subjected to combined velocity and magnetic-field shear, a scenario typical at intermittent structures in plasma turbulence. We create conditions where only the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) and Drift-Kink (DK) instabilities can develop, while tearing modes are forbidden. The interaction of DKI and KHI generates qualitatively new structures, marked by a thickened shear layer with very weak electromagnetic field, modulated by KH vortices. Over a range of moderately strong velocity shears explored, the interaction of DKI and KHI results in a significant enhancement of dissipation over cases with only velocity shear or only magnetic shear. Moreover, we observe a new and efficient way of particle acceleration where particles are stochastically accelerated by the motional electric field exterior to the shear layer as they meander in an S-shaped pattern in and out of it. This process takes advantage of the bent geometry of the shear layer caused by the DK-KHI interaction and is responsible for most of the highest-energy particles produced in our simulations. These results further our understanding of dissipation and particle acceleration at intermittent structures, which are present in plasma turbulence across a wide range of astrophysical contexts such as in AGN jet sheaths, potentially relevant to limb-brightened emission, etc., and highlight the sensitivity of dissipation to multiple interacting instabilities, thus providing a strong motivation for further studies of their nonlinear interaction at the kinetic level.
#### Supernovae Driven Winds Impede Lyman Continuum Escape from Dwarf Galaxies in First 10 Myr

 - **Abstract**
 Observations suggest that UV-bright, compact star-forming galaxies produce enough ionizing (Lyman continuum; LyC) photons to reionize the Universe. Yet, the efficiency of LyC escape and the roles of radiation, stellar winds, and supernovae remain uncertain. Using medium-resolution spectra of six nearly identical local star-forming galaxies, we directly trace, for the first time, the evolution of a multiphase wind through individual spectral lines alongside measurements of the LyC escape fraction. We find that LyC escape peaks early, during a period dominated by intense radiation and stellar winds but lacking a fast galactic wind. As the starbursts age, supernovae drive and accelerate the wind, progressively suppressing LyC escape. These results highlight the need for cosmological simulations to incorporate early feedback as a key driver of reionization.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the relationship among the jet magnetic field, black hole spin, black hole mass, Eddington ratio, and optical variability timescales in jetted active galactic nuclei (AGNs). By fitting a damped random walk (DRW) model to the g-band light curves, we obtain the characteristic variability timescale ($\tau_{\rm DRW}$) for 41 jetted AGNs with precise supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass measurements. Our main results are as follows: (i) Our analysis reveals a significant correlation between the jet magnetic field ($B_{\rm 1pc}$), black hole spin ($j$) and the characteristic variability timescale within our sample. These findings suggest that the optical variability of jetted AGNs is influenced by the jet magnetic field and black hole spin. Furthermore, the characteristic variability timescale aligns with the electron escape timescale, as evidenced by the relationship between the characteristic variability timescale and jet magnetic field ($\tau_{\rm DRW}\propto B_{\rm 1pc}^{0.76\pm0.22}$). (ii) We confirm a significant correlation between the characteristic variability timescale and SMBH mass, expressed as: $\log \rm \tau_{\rm DRW} = 0.52(\pm0.21)\log M _{\rm BH}/M_{\rm \odot}-3.12(\pm1.90)$, with an intrinsic scatter of 0.08 dex. The slope of this relationship is consistent with that between the thermal timescale and black hole mass. Our results support the hypothesis that magnetorotational instability (MRI) fluctuations drive the intrinsic variability observed in the light curves emitted by the AGNs accretion disk.

 - **Abstract**
 The electromagnetic detection of circumbinary disks around pre-merger binary black holes (BBHs) relies on theoretical predictions. These are generally obtained through expensive numerical simulations, but simple or fast toy models are lacking to unleash the potential of these theoretical advances for observational purposes. We aim to present a simple toy model to compute the electromagnetic variability of circumbinary disks around circular-orbit BBHs at relativistic separations, focusing on the impact of disk non-axisymmetries. We assume that the disk is threaded by spiral arms and hosts a hotspot linked to an overdense structure (the {\lq}lump{\rq}) preferably reported in binaries close to equal mass. We build a simple temperature distribution, and estimate its thermal emission, perceived by a distant observer, via a ray-tracing code in a BBH approximate metric. We propose a toy model reproducing the main lightcurve features and show it is consistent with 2D general-hydrodynamical simulations under the assumption of compressional heating and expansional cooling except for purely dynamical effects such as the binary-lump beat. The lightcurve exhibits a main modulation at the lump's period (i.e. a few times the orbital period), due to relativistic Doppler effect, and a shorter one at the orbital-like period, due to spiral arms or the beat. These are more prominent in the optical/UV band for a total binary mass $M\, {=} \, 10^{4-10}\mathrm{M_\odot}$, where the disk energy spectrum peaks. For $M=10^{9}\mathrm{M_\odot}$, a $4\%$-amplitude lump modulation is detectable with the Vera Rubin Observatory after six months of observation, up to $z\, {=}\, 0.5$. We proposed a new, simple toy model that can be used, for instance, to test the compatibility of the periodicity of BBH candidate sources with a circumbinary disk origin.

 - **Abstract**
 The AGN Space Telescope and Optical Reverberation Mapping 2 (STORM 2) campaign targeted Mrk 817 with intensive multi-wavelength monitoring and found its soft X-ray emission to be strongly absorbed. We present results from 157 near-IR spectra with an average cadence of a few days. Whereas the hot dust reverberation signal as tracked by the continuum flux does not have a clear response, we recover a dust reverberation radius of $\sim 90$ light-days from the blackbody dust temperature light-curve. This radius is consistent with previous photometric reverberation mapping results when Mrk 817 was in an unobscured state. The heating/cooling process we observe indicates that the inner limit of the dusty torus is set by a process other than sublimation, rendering it a luminosity-invariant `dusty wall' of a carbonaceous composition. Assuming thermal equilibrium for dust optically thick to the incident radiation, we derive a luminosity of $\sim 6 \times 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ for the source heating it. This luminosity is similar to that of the obscured spectral energy distribution, assuming a disk with an Eddington accretion rate of $\dot{m} \sim 0.2$. Alternatively, the dust is illuminated by an unobscured lower luminosity disk with $\dot{m} \sim 0.1$, which permits the UV/optical continuum lags in the high-obscuration state to be dominated by diffuse emission from the broad-line region. Finally, we find hot dust extended on scales $> 140-350$ pc, associated with the rotating disk of ionised gas we observe in spatially-resolved [SIII] $\lambda 9531$ images. Its likely origin is in the compact bulge of the barred spiral host galaxy, where it is heated by a nuclear starburst.

 - **Abstract**
 Young massive star clusters (YMSCs) can produce gamma rays in the very-high-energy (VHE, E>100 GeV) range and have been proposed as sources that can accelerate cosmic rays up to PeV energies. Observations with current instruments have lead to the detection of only a few YMSCs but future instruments should significantly increase this number. However, the details of the production of the VHE emission are not well understood: What is the spectrum of accelerated particles? What is the efficiency of cosmic-ray production? What fraction of the wind luminosity is converted into the turbulent magnetic field? To address these questions, we simulate the population of YMSCs in the gamma-ray domain, by means of Monte Carlo methods, and apply the constraints based on the subsample of YMSCs currently detected at TeV energies. We confront our simulated populations with the catalogue of the H.E.S.S. Galactic Plane Survey and the First LHAASO Catalogue of Gamma-Ray Sources, allowing us to investigate crucial aspects of particle acceleration at YMSCs.

 - **Abstract**
 Prominence seismology, applied to the large-amplitude longitudinal oscillation, is used to indirectly diagnose the geometry and strength of the magnetic fields inside the prominence. In this paper, combining imaging and spectroscopic data, the magnetic field configuration of a quiescent prominence is revealed by large-amplitude longitudinal oscillations observed in end view on 2023 December 4. Particularly, the prominence oscillation involved blueshift velocities in Dopplergrams and horizontal motions in extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) images. Originally, the prominence oscillation was triggered by the collision and heating of an adjoining hot structure associated with two coronal jets. The oscillation involved two groups of signals with similar oscillatory parameters, a three-dimensional (3D) initial amplitude of 40 Mm and a 3D velocity amplitude of 48 km/s, both lasting for 4 cycles with a period of 77 minutes, with a phase difference of pi/4. While the angle between 3D velocities and the prominence axis ranges from 10 to 30. Two methods, utilizing time-distance diagrams and velocity fields, are employed to calculate the curvature radius of magnetic dips supporting the prominence materials. Both methods yield similar value ranges and trends from the bottom to the top of magnetic dips, with the curvature radius increasing from 90 Mm to 220 Mm, then decreasing to 10 Mm, with transverse magnetic field strength 25 Gauss. From this, the realistic 3D geometry of the prominence magnetic dips is determined to be sinusoidal. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first accurate calculation of the 3D curvature radius and geometry of the prominence magnetic dips based on longitudinal oscillatory motions.

 - **Abstract**
 Binary black holes (BBHs) in the vicinity of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) are particularly interesting systems from both a cosmological and astrophysical point of view. Matter and radiation fields within the dense AGN environment could produce electromagnetic and neutrino emission in addition to gravitational waves (GWs). Moreover, interactions between BBHs and AGN accretion disks are expected to influence BBH formation channels and merger rates. Understanding these sources could help explain the unexpectedly high BBH masses observed through GWs by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaborations. We present a search for coincident gravitational-wave and neutrino emission from AGNs. Our innovative approach combines information from gravitational-wave data, neutrino observations, and AGN optical catalogs to increase the chances of identifying potential sources and studying their properties. We assess the sensitivity of the search using subthreshold gravitational-wave candidates from LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA data, neutrino event candidates from public IceCube Neutrino Observatory data and AGN candidates from the Quaia catalog. A confident detection of such an event would mark a breakthrough in multi-messenger astronomy.

 - **Abstract**
 Low Earth Orbit satellite (LEOsat) mega-constellations are considered to be an unavoidable source of contamination for survey observations to be carried out by the China Space Station Telescope (CSST) over the next decade. This study reconstructs satellite trail profiles based on simulated parameters, including brightness levels and orbital altitudes, in combination with multi-band simulated images. Compared to our previous work, the simulated images in this study more accurately replicate the realistic observational conditions of CSST and extend beyond single-band analysis. Variations in LEOsat trail brightness, source brightness, background noise, and source density across different bands result in differing levels of accuracy in trail reconstruction and subsequently affect the reliability of photometric measurements. The reconstructed trail profiles are subsequently applied to correct the contaminated regions. Simulation results reveal varying levels of contamination effects across different bands following LEOsat trail correction, including both reconstruction and subtraction. To evaluate the effectiveness of the correction, we quantified the fraction of affected sources using two metrics: (1) magnitude errors greater than 0.01 mag attributable to LEOsats, and (2) LEOsat-induced noise exceeding 10% of other noise contributions. Following trail repair, the analysis reveals a reduction of over 50% in the fraction of affected sources in the NUV band for both 550 km and 1200 km altitudes, assuming a maximum brightness of 7 in the V band. In the i band, the reduction exceeds 30%. The degree of improvement varies across spectral bands, and depends on both satellite altitude and the adopted brightness model.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the prospects for detecting continuous gravitational waves (GWs) from Sco X-1 and evaluate the most likely waveform- and progenitor- parameters. We study the evolution of different Sco X-1 progenitors, identifying those that give rise to detectable signals. We model the spin evolution of the neutron star (NS) by the accretion torque and the GW torque. We consider two mechanisms for generating the non-axisymmetry responsible for the GW torque: i) magnetic mountains and ii) deformation after crustal breakage. Both torques are intertwined with the binary evolution, which we trace from the formation of the NS in a binary system with a main-sequence companion. We do this with MESA, starting from a set of initial binary configurations. At current sensitivity, a magnetic ellipticity of $\varepsilon\gtrsim 10^{-6}$ is necessary for detection. The highest frequency at which we have detectable signals increases with the accretion efficiency $\eta$, and it can be as high as 360Hz. At 3G (Cosmic Explorer/Einstein telescope) sensitivity, less deformed Sco X-1 NSs, with ellipticities as small as $6\cdot 10^{-9}$, are detectable, but the waveform highly depends on the binary system: the highest frequency of detectable signals spans the very broad range 600-1700Hz, strongly depending on $\eta$ and mass of the progenitor donor star $M^d$. If $\eta\leq$30%, the crust does not break. When $\eta\in$[40%,60%] only progenitors with $M^d\geq[1.1,1.5]M_{\odot}$ present crustal breakage, while if $\eta\geq$70% all crusts break. In some systems the crust breaks during their Sco X-1 phase. If Sco X-1 were one of those systems, it would be emitting a very loud GW signal sweeping from O(1000)Hz down to torque-balance frequencies. We estimate current detection probability for this signal to be under 1%; this probability increases substantially -- to around 41% -- with third-generation detectors.

 - **Abstract**
 Vertical mixing disrupts the thermochemical equilibrium and introduces additional heat flux that alters exoplanetary atmospheric temperatures. We investigate how this mixing-induced heat flux affects atmospheric chemistry. Temperature increase in the lower atmosphere by the mixing-induced heat flux alters species abundances there and modifies those in the upper atmosphere through vertical transport. In the lower atmosphere, most species follow thermodynamic equilibrium with temperature changes. In the upper layers, species mixing ratios depend on the positions of quenching levels relative to the regions exhibiting significant mixing-induced temperature variations. When the quenching level resides within such region (e.g. CO, $\rm CH_4$, and $\rm H_2O$ with strong mixing), the mixing ratios in the upper atmosphere are modified due to changes in the quenched ratios affected by the temperature variation in the lower atmosphere. This alters the mixing ratio of other species (e.g. NO and $\rm CO_2$) through the chemical reaction network, whose quenching occurs in the region without much temperature change. The mixing ratios of $\rm CH_4$, $\rm H_2O$, and $\rm NH_3$ decrease in the lower atmosphere with increasing mixing heat flux, similarly reducing these ratios in the upper atmosphere. Conversely, the mixing ratios of CO, $\rm CO_2$, and NO rise in the lower atmosphere, with CO and $\rm CO_2$ also increasing in the upper levels, although NO decreases. Weaker host star irradiation lowers the overall temperature of the planet, allowing a smaller mixing to have a similar effect. We conclude that understanding the vertical mixing heat flux is essential for accurate atmospheric chemistry modeling and retrieval.

 - **Abstract**
 Double radio relics, pairs of diffuse radio features located on opposite sides of merging galaxy clusters, are a rare subclass of radio relics that are believed to trace merger shocks and provide valuable constraints on plasma acceleration models and merger history. With the number of known double relics growing in recent and upcoming radio surveys, statistical analyses of their properties are becoming feasible. In this study, we utilize the cosmological magnetohydrodynamics zoom-in simulations TNG-Cluster, in combination with TNG300-1, to examine the statistical properties of double radio relics. The simulated double relic pairs exhibit a wide range of luminosity ratios, broadly consistent with the observations. We find that the two relics in a given double system often differ significantly in their shock properties and magnetic field strengths. This diversity implies that the observed brightness asymmetry in the pair cannot be explained by a single factor alone, but instead reflects an interplay of multiple physical parameters. Nevertheless, double radio relics tend to align with the collision axis within $\sim30^{\circ}$ and their separation ($d_{\rm drr}$) correlates tightly with the time since collision (TSC) as ${\rm TSC~[Gyr]} = 0.52 d_{\rm drr}/R_{500\rm c} - 0.24$, allowing it to be inferred with an accuracy of $\sim0.2~\rm Gyr$. With the statistical samples of simulated radio relics, we predict that low-mass clusters will constitute the dominant population of double radio relic systems detected with upcoming surveys such as SKA. These results demonstrate that double radio relics can serve as robust probes of merger dynamics and plasma acceleration, and that simulations provide critical guidance for interpreting the large samples expected from next-generation radio surveys.
#### Exploring the Co-SIMP dark matter model using the 21-cm signal from dark ages

 - **Abstract**
 The redshifted 21-cm signal from the dark ages offers a powerful probe of cosmological models and the underlying dark matter microphysics. We investigate deviations from the standard $\Lambda$CDM prediction, an absorption trough of approximately $-40.6\,\mathrm{mK}$ at redshift $z \simeq 85.6$, in the context of co-SIMP dark matter. The strength of co-SIMP interactions, quantified by the parameter $C_{\rm int}$, enhances the absorption depth and shifts the trough to higher redshifts. For example, a model with $C_{\rm int}=1.0$ produces a minimum brightness temperature of $-50.6\,\mathrm{mK}$ at $z \simeq 86.2$. The 21-cm power spectrum increases with $C_{\rm int}$ in addition to the global signal. We assess the detectability of these signatures using signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and Fisher matrix forecasts. The maximum SNR reaches $\sim 15.7$ for $C_{\rm int}=1.0$ for the global signal. Fisher forecast for $1,000$ hours of integration time shows that this model can be distinguished from a null-signal at $4.3\sigma$ and from the $\Lambda$CDM model case at $1.6 \sigma$, with order-of-magnitude improvements for 100,000 hours of integration. For the 21-cm power spectrum, our forecasts reveal complementary trends; with a modest setup (collecting area of $5\,\mathrm{km}^2$ and 1,000 hours of integration time), the $C_{\rm int}=1.0$ model can be detected at $4.63\sigma$ and differentiated from the standard scenario at $1.78 \sigma$. These findings highlight the potential of the 21-cm cosmology to probe the properties of dark matter and demonstrate that upcoming dark ages experiments, particularly space-based and lunar observations, can offer a promising avenue to test co-SIMP models.
#### Predicted observational effects of rapid rotation for Be stars

 - **Abstract**
 We conduct a systematic study on the effects of rapid rotation on predicted Be star observables. We use the three-dimensional Monte Carlo radiative transfer code, \textsc{hdust}, to model a comprehensive range of Be star subtypes at varying rotation rates. Using these models, we predict $V$ magnitude and photometric color, H$\alpha$ line profiles, and polarization at UV wavelengths as well as in the $V$-band for Be stars from B0 to B8. For each spectral subtype, we investigate the effects of disk density on the produced observables. We find that reddening and brightening effects of gravity darkening may cause rapidly-rotating stars to appear more evolved than they truly are. Rotational effects on the H$\alpha$ line profile shape may reduce line intensity for Be stars viewed at low inclinations and increase line intensity for those viewed at high inclinations. Additionally, rapid rotation can significantly impact the measured equivalent width of the line produced by a star with a moderate to high density disk, especially at high inclinations. When the star-disk system is viewed near edge-on, gravity darkening can result in stronger H$\alpha$ emission than would otherwise be expected for a disk of a given density. We also find that the competing effects of rapid rotation and H\,\textsc{i} opacity cause the slope of the polarized continuum (the polarization color) to be very sensitive to changes in the stellar rotation rate. This quantity offers a strong diagnostic for the rotation rate of Be stars.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new framework for modeling the chemical enrichment histories of galaxies by integrating the chemical evolution with resolved star formation histories (SFHs) derived from color-magnitude diagrams. This novel approach links the time evolution of the metallicity of the star-forming ISM to the cumulative stellar mass formed in the galaxy, enabling a physically motivated, self-consistent description of chemical evolution. We apply this methodology to four isolated, gas-rich Local Group dwarf galaxies -- WLM, Aquarius, Leo A, and Leo P -- using deep HST and JWST imaging. For WLM, Aquarius, and Leo A, we independently validate our metallicity evolution results using ages and metallicities of individual red giant stars with spectroscopic measurements, finding good agreement. We quantify systematic uncertainties by repeating our analysis with multiple stellar evolution and bolometric correction libraries. We then compare the observed chemical enrichment histories to predictions from the TNG50 and FIREbox cosmological hydrodynamic simulations and the Galacticus semi-analytic model. We find that the enrichment history of WLM is best reproduced by the FIREbox simulation, while TNG50 and Galacticus predict higher metallicities at early times. Our results suggest that differences in stellar feedback and metal recycling prescriptions drive significant variation in the predicted chemical enrichment of dwarf galaxies, particularly at early times. This work demonstrates the power of combining resolved SFHs with physically motivated chemical evolution models to constrain galaxy formation physics and highlights the need for further observational and theoretical studies of metal retention and recycling in low-mass dwarf galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 Little Red Dots, discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope, are hypothesized to be active galactic nuclei containing a supermassive black hole, possibly surrounded by a dense stellar cluster, large amounts of gas, and likely by a population of stellar-mass black holes. We develop a simple nuclear star cluster model to evolve the rapid mass growth of black hole seeds into the supermassive regime. The combined processes of tidal disruption events, black hole captures, and gas accretion are accounted for self-consistently in our model. Given the observed number density of Little Red Dots, and under reasonable assumptions, we predict at least a few tens of tidal disruption events and at least a few black hole captures at $z=4$-$6$, with a tidal disruption event rate an order of magnitude larger than the black hole capture rate. We also estimate the uncertainties in these estimates. Finally, we comment on the low x-ray luminosity of Little Red Dots.
