 - **Abstract**
 Observations with modern radio interferometers are uncovering the intricate morphology of synchrotron sources in galaxy clusters, both those arising from the intracluster medium (ICM) and those associated with member galaxies. Moreover, in addition to the well-known radio tails from active galactic nuclei, radio continuum tails from jellyfish galaxies are being efficiently detected in nearby clusters and groups. Our goal is to investigate the radio emission from the Ophiuchus cluster, a massive, sloshing cluster in the local Universe ($z=0.0296$) that hosts a diffuse mini halo at its center. To achieve this, we analyzed a 7.25 h MeerKAT L-band observation, producing sensitive images at 1.28 GHz with multiple resolutions. A catalog of spectroscopically confirmed cluster galaxies was used to identify and study the member galaxies detected in radio. We discover thin threads of synchrotron emission embedded in the mini halo, two of which may be connected to the brightest cluster galaxy. We also report the first identification of jellyfish galaxies in Ophiuchus, detecting six galaxies with radio continuum tails, one of which extending for $\sim$64 kpc at 1.28 GHz, making it one of the longest detected at such a high frequency. Finally, we propose an alternative scenario to explain the origin of a bright amorphous radio source, previously classified as a radio phoenix, aided by the comparison with recent simulations of radio jets undergoing kink instability. In Ophiuchus thin threads have been observed within the diffuse emission; a similar result was obtained in Perseus, another nearby cluster hosting a mini halo, suggesting that these structures may be a common feature in this kind of sources. Moreover, radio continuum observations have proven effective in detecting the first jellyfish galaxies in both systems.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we present a homogeneous analysis of close-in Neptune planets. To do this, we compile a sample of TESS-observed planets using a ranking criterion which takes into account the planet's period, radius, and the visual magnitude of its host star. We use archival and new HARPS data to ensure every target in this sample has precise radial velocities. This yields a total of 64 targets, 46 of which are confirmed planets and 18 of which show no significant radial velocity signal. We explore the mass-radius distribution, planetary density, stellar host metallicity, and stellar and planetary companions of our targets. We find 26$\%$ of our sample are in multi-planet systems, which are typically seen for planets located near the lower edge of the Neptunian desert. We define a 'gold' subset of our sample consisting of 33 confirmed planets with planetary radii between 2$R_{\oplus}$ and 10$R_{\oplus}$. With these targets, we calculate envelope mass fractions (EMF) using the GAS gianT modeL for Interiors (GASTLI). We find a clear split in EMF between planets with equilibrium temperatures below and above 1300~K, equivalent to an orbital period of $\sim$3.5~days. Below this period, EMFs are consistent with zero, while above they typically range from 20$\%$ to 40$\%$, scaling linearly with the planetary mass. The orbital period separating these two populations coincides with the transition between the Neptunian desert and the recently identified Neptunian ridge, further suggesting that different formation and/or evolution mechanisms are at play for Neptune planets across different close-in orbital regions.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a multiwavelength analysis of the galaxy cluster Abell 795 (z=0.1374), known for its extended (200 kpc) radio emission with a steep spectral index of unclear origin surrounding the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG), and for sloshing features observed by Chandra. We used new JVLA 1.5 GHz, archival GMRT 325 MHz, and XMM-Newton data to investigate the nature of the radio emission and the dynamical state of the intracluster medium. Our X-ray surface brightness analysis revealed an azimuthally asymmetric excess extending to 650 kpc from the center, possibly related to the sloshing spiral, although the existing data did not allow us to confirm the presence of a cold front. We also detected a previously unknown galaxy group located 1 Mpc northwest of the cluster. Its X-ray emission was well fitted by a $\beta$-model ($\beta$=0.52$\pm$0.17), and the spectral analysis revealed a thermal plasma temperature kT=1.08$\pm$0.08 keV and metallicity Z=0.13$\pm$0.06 Z$_{\odot}$. We investigated the possibility that this group acted as the perturber that triggered the sloshing in Abell 795, and we showed that the velocity distribution of member galaxies supports the dynamically unrelaxed nature of Abell 795. The analysis of JVLA 1.5 GHz and GMRT 325 MHz images confirmed the presence of extended radio emission with largest linear size 200 kpc, preferentially extended toward southwest and terminating in a sub-component ("SW blob"). We measured the spectral indices, finding $\alpha_{Ext}$=-2.24$\pm$0.13 for the diffuse extended emission, and $\alpha_{SWb}$=-2.10$\pm$0.13 for the SW blob. These ultra-steep spectral index values, coupled with the complex morphology and cospatiality with the radio-loud AGN present in the BCG, suggest that this emission could be classified as a radio phoenix, possibly arising from adiabatic compression of an ancient AGN radio lobe due to the presence of sloshing motions.

 - **Abstract**
 Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) exhibits frequent flaring activity across the electromagnetic spectrum, often associated with a localized region of strong emission, known as a hot spot. We aim to establish an empirical relationship linking key parameters of this phenomenon -- emission radius, inclination, and black hole spin -- to the observed angle difference between the primary and secondary image ($\Delta PA$) that an interferometric array could resolve. Using the numerical radiative transfer code IPOLE, we generated a library of more than 900 models with varying system parameters and computed the position angle difference on the sky between the primary and secondary images of the hot spot. We find that the average $\Delta PA$ over a full period is insensitive to inclination. This result significantly simplifies potential spin measurements which might otherwise have large dependencies on inclination. Additionally, we derive a relation connecting spin to $\Delta PA$, given the period and emission radius of the hot spot, with an accuracy of less than $5^\circ$ in most cases. Finally, we present a mock observation to showcase the potential of this relation for spin inference. Our results provide a novel approach for black hole spin measurements using high-resolution observations, such as future movies of Sgr A* obtained with the Event Horizon Telescope, next-generation Event Horizon Telescope, and Black Hole Explorer.

 - **Abstract**
 The low-mass end of low-mass galaxies is largely unexplored in AGN studies, but it is essential for extending our understanding of the black hole-galaxy coevolution. We surveyed the 3D-HST catalog and collected a sample of 546 dwarf galaxies with stellar masses log(M$_*$/\(M_\odot\))$<$8.7, residing in the GOODS-South deep field. We then used the unprecedented depth of Chandra available in the GOODS-South field to search for AGN. We carefully investigated the factors that could play roles in the AGN detectability, such as Chandra's point-spread function and the redshift- and off-axis-dependent detection limits. We identified 16 X-ray sources that are likely associated with AGN activity. Next, we evaluated the environment density of each galaxy by computing tidal indices. We uncovered a dramatic impact of the environment on AGN triggering as dwarfs from high-density environments showed an AGN fraction of 22.5\%, while the median stellar mass of this subset of dwarfs is only log(M$_*$/\(M_\odot\))=8.1. In contrast, the low-density environment dwarfs showed an AGN fraction of only 1.4\%, in line with typically reported values from the literature. This highlights the fact that massive central black holes are ubiquitous even at the lowest mass scales and demonstrates the importance of the environment in triggering black hole accretion, as well as the necessity for deep X-ray data and proper evaluation of the X-ray data quality. Alternatively, even if the detected X-ray sources are related to stellar mass accretors rather than AGN, the environmental dependence persists, signaling the impact of the environment on galaxy evolution and star formation processes at the lowest mass scales. Additionally, we stacked the X-ray images of non-detected galaxies from high- and low-density environments, revealing similar trends.
#### Modeling of lightcurves from reconnection-powered very high energy flares from M87*

 - **Abstract**
 The black hole at the center of M87 is observed to flare regularly in the very high energy (VHE) band, with photon energies $\gtrsim 100$ GeV. The rapid variability, which can be as short as $2$ days in the VHE lightcurve constrains some of the flares to originate close to the black hole. Magnetic reconnection is a promising candidate for explaining the flares, where the VHE emission comes from background soft photons that Inverse Compton (IC) scatter off of high energy electron-positron pairs in the reconnecting current sheet. In this work, we ray trace photons from a current sheet near the black hole event horizon during a flux eruption in a magnetically arrested state in a general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulation. We incorporate beaming of the Compton up-scattered photons, based on results from radiative kinetic simulations of relativistic reconnection. We then construct VHE lightcurves that account for the dynamics of the current sheet and lensing from general-relativistic effects. We find that most of the flux originates in the inner $5$ gravitational radii, and beaming is essential to explain the observed flux from the strongest VHE flares. The ray traced lightcurves show features resulting from the changing volume of the reconnecting current sheet on timescales that can be consistent with observations. Furthermore, we find that the amount of beaming depends strongly on two effects: the current sheet inclination with respect to the observer and the anisotropy in the direction of motion of the accelerated particles.

 - **Abstract**
 Dynamics of stellar mass black holes (sBHs) embedded in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) could produce highly eccentric orbits near the central supermassive black hole, leading to repeated close encounters that emit gravitational waves in the LIGO frequency band. Many works have focused on the mergers of sBH in the disk that produce gravitational waves; however, sBHs in hyperbolic orbits also emit gravitational-wave \bremss{} that can be detected by ground-based interferometers like LIGO. In this work, we analyze the scattering of sBHs in an AGN disk as they migrate inside the disk, focusing on gravitational-wave \bremss{} emission. We determine how the gravitational-wave emission depends on the different parameters of the scattering experiments, such as the mass of the supermassive black hole and the sBH migration rate and mass ratio. We find that scattering with detectable gravitational-wave \bremss{} is more frequent around lower mass SMBHs ($\sim 10^{5-6}$M$_\odot$). We then conduct a suite of Monte Carlo simulations and estimated the rate for ground-based gravitational-wave detections to be in the range of 0.08 - 1194 $\text{Gpc}^{-3} \text{ yr}^{-1}$, depending on migration forces and detection thresholds, with large uncertainties accounting for variations in possible AGN environments. The expected rate for our {\tt Fiducial} parameters is 3.2 $\text{Gpc}^{-3} \text{ yr}^{-1}$. Finally, we provide first-principle gravitational wave templates produced by the encounters.
#### $R_{\rm e}$. II. Understanding (IC 3475)-type galaxy, aka ultra-diffuse galaxy, structural scaling relations

 - **Abstract**
 It is explained why ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs), a subset of (IC 3475)-type galaxies, do not have unexpectedly large sizes but large sizes that are in line with expectations from the curved size-luminosity relation defined by brighter early-type galaxies (ETGs). UDGs extend the faint end of the (absolute magnitude, $\mathfrak{M}$)-log(Sérsic index, $n$) and $\mathfrak{M}$-(central surface brightness, $\mu_{\rm 0}$) relations defined by ETGs, leading to the large effective half-light radii, $R_{\rm e}$, in UDGs. It is detailed how the scatter in $\mu_{\rm 0}$, at a given $\mathfrak{M}$, relates to variations in the galaxies' values of $n$ and effective surface brightness, $\mu_{\rm e}$. These variations map into changes in $R_{\rm e}$ and produce the scatter about the $\mathfrak{M}$-$R_{\rm e}$ relation at fixed $\mathfrak{M}$. Similarly, the scatter in $\mathfrak{M}$, at fixed $\mu_{\rm 0}$ and $n$, can be mapped into changes in $R_{\rm e}$. The increased scatter about the faint end of the $\mathfrak{M}$-$R_{\rm e}$ relation and the smaller scatter about $\mathfrak{M}$-(isophotal radii, $R_{\rm iso}$) relations are explained. Artificial and potentially misleading size-luminosity relations for UDGs are also addressed. The suggestion that there may be two types of UDG appears ill-founded, arising from the scatter about the $\mathfrak{M}$-$\mu_{\rm 0}$ relation, which persists at all magnitudes. Hopefully, the understanding presented here will prove helpful for interpreting the many low surface brightness galaxies that the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope will detect.

 - **Abstract**
 With current observational methods it is not possible to directly measure the magnetic field in the solar corona with sufficient accuracy. Therefore, coronal magnetic field models have to rely on extrapolation methods using photospheric magnetograms as boundary conditions. In recent years, due to the increased resolution of observations and the need to resolve non-force-free lower regions of the solar atmosphere, there have been increased efforts to use magnetohydrostatic (MHS) field models instead of force-free extrapolation methods. Although numerical methods to calculateMHS solutions can deal with non-linear problems and hence provide more accurate models, analytical three-dimensional MHS equilibria can also be used as a numerically relatively "cheap" complementary method. In this paper, we present an extrapolation method based on a family of analytical MHS equilibria that allows for a transition from a non-force-free region to a force-free region. We demonstrate how asymptotic forms of the solutions can help to increase the numerical efficiency of the method.

 - **Abstract**
 As the closest Earth-like exoplanet within the habitable zone of the M-dwarf star TRAPPIST-1, TRAPPIST-1e exhibits a magnetic field topology that is dependent on space weather conditions. Variations in these conditions influence its habitability and contribute to its radio emissions. Our objective is to analyze the response of different terrestrial magnetosphere structures of TRAPPIST-1e to various space weather conditions, including events analogous to coronal mass ejections (CMEs). We assess its habitability by computing the magnetopause standoff distance and predict the resulting radio emissions using scaling laws. This study provides some priors for future radio observations. We perform three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the TRAPPIST-1e system using the PLUTO code in spherical coordinates. Our analysis indicates that the predicted habitability and radio emission of TRAPPIST-1e strongly depend on the planet's magnetic field intensity and magnetic axis inclination. Within sub-Alfvenic, super-Alfvenic, and transitional stellar wind regimes, the radio emission intensity positively correlates with both planetary magnetic field strength and axial tilt, while planetary habitability, quantified by the magnetopause standoff distance, shows a positive correlation with magnetic field strength and a negative correlation with magnetic axis tilt...
#### On the origin of long-term modulation in the Sun's magnetic activity cycle

 - **Abstract**
 One of the most striking manifestations of orderly behavior emerging out of complex interactions in any astrophysical system is the 11-year cycle of sunspots. However, direct sunspot observations and reconstructions of long-term solar activity clearly exhibit amplitude fluctuations beyond the decadal timescale -- which may be termed as supradecadal modulation. Whether this long-term modulation in the Sun's magnetic activity results from nonlinear mechanisms or stochastic perturbations remains controversial and a matter of active debate. Utilizing multi-millennial scale kinematic dynamo simulations based on the Babcock-Leighton paradigm -- in the likely (near-critical) regime of operation of the solar dynamo -- we demonstrate that this supradecadal modulation in solar activity cannot be explained by nonlinear mechanisms alone; stochastic forcing is essential for the manifestation of observed long-term fluctuations in the near-critical dynamo regime. Our findings substantiate some independent observational and theoretical investigations, and provide additional insights into temporal dynamics associated with a plethora of natural phenomena in astronomy and planetary systems arising from weakly nonlinear, non-deterministic processes.

 - **Abstract**
 Quasars are variable and their variability can both constrain their physical properties and help to identify them. We look for ways to efficiently identify quasars exhibiting consistent variability over multi-year time-scales, based on a small number of epochs. Using infrared (IR) is desirable to avoid bias against reddened objects. We compare the apparent brightness of known quasars that have been observed with two IR surveys, covering up to a twenty-year baseline: the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS; 1997-2001) and the VISTA Hemisphere Survey (VHS; 2009-2017). We look at the previous studies of the selected variable quasars to see if their variable behaviour is known and when available we use multi-epoch monitoring with the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) to obtain a measure of optical variability of individual objects. We build a sample of ~2500 quasars that show statistically significant variability between the 2MASS and VHS. About 1500 of these come from the new Quaia sample based on Gaia spectra and about 1/3 of these have hardly been studied. The Quaia sample constitutes the main product of this work. Based on ensemble variability and structure function analysis we demonstrate that the selected objects in our sample are representative of the typical quasar population and show behaviour, consistent with other quasar samples. Our analysis strengthens previous results, for example that variability decreases with the rest-frame wavelength and that it exhibits peaks for certain absolute magnitudes of the quasars. Similarly, the structure function shows an increase in variability for rest-frame time lags below ~1500 d and a decrease for longer lags, just like in previous studies. Our selection, even though it is based on two epochs only, seems to be surprisingly robust, showing up to ~11% contamination by quasars that show stable non-variable behaviour in ZTF.

 - **Abstract**
 Radiometers are crucial instruments in radio astronomy, forming the primary component of nearly all radio telescopes. They measure the intensity of electromagnetic radiation, converting this radiation into electrical signals. A radiometer's primary components are an antenna and a Low Noise Amplifier (LNA), which is the core of the ``receiver'' chain. Instrumental effects introduced by the receiver are typically corrected or removed during calibration. However, impedance mismatches between the antenna and receiver can introduce unwanted signal reflections and distortions. Traditional calibration methods, such as Dicke switching, alternate the receiver input between the antenna and a well-characterised reference source to mitigate errors by comparison. Recent advances in Machine Learning (ML) offer promising alternatives. Neural networks, which are trained using known signal sources, provide a powerful means to model and calibrate complex systems where traditional analytical approaches struggle. These methods are especially relevant for detecting the faint sky-averaged 21-cm signal from atomic hydrogen at high redshifts. This is one of the main challenges in observational Cosmology today. Here, for the first time, we introduce and test a machine learning-based calibration framework capable of achieving the precision required for radiometric experiments aiming to detect the 21-cm line.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a ``cyclic zoom'' method to capture the dynamics of accretion flows onto black holes across a vast range of spatial and temporal scales in general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations. In this method, we cyclically zoom out (derefine) and zoom in (refine) the simulation domain while using a central mask region containing a careful treatment of the coarsened fluid variables to preserve the small-scale physics, particularly the magnetic field dynamics. The method can accelerate GRMHD simulations by $\gtrsim 10^5$ times for problems with large scale separation. We demonstrate the validity of the technique using a series of tests, including spherically symmetric Bondi accretion, the Blandford-Znajek monopole, magnetized turbulent Bondi accretion, accretion of a magnetized rotating torus, and the long-term evolution of an accreting torus about both Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes. As applications, we simulate Bondi and rotating torus accretion onto black holes from galactic scales, covering an extremely large dynamic range. In Bondi accretion, the accretion rate is suppressed relative to the Bondi rate by $\sim(10r_\mathrm{g}/r_\mathrm{B})^{1/2}$ with a feedback power of $\sim 0.01 \dot{M} c^2$ for vanishing spin, and $\sim 0.1 \dot{M} c^2$ for spin $a\approx0.9$. In the long-term evolution of a rotating torus, the accretion rate decreases with time as $\dot{M}\propto t^{-2}$ on timescales much longer than the viscous timescale, demonstrating that our method can capture not only quasi-steady problems but also secular evolution. Our new method likewise holds significant promise for applications to many other problems that need to cover vast spatial and temporal scales.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we analyze the ongoing brightening of the poorly studied symbiotic star V4141 Sgr and examine its long-term variability. We present new low-resolution spectroscopic observations of the system in its bright state and combine them with multi-color photometric data from our observations, ASAS-SN, ATLAS, and Gaia DR3. To investigate its long-term evolution, we also incorporate historical data, including photographic plates, constructing a light curve spanning more than a century. Our analysis reveals that V4141 Sgr has undergone multiple outbursts, with at least one exhibiting characteristics typical of "slow" symbiotic novae. The current outburst is characterized by the ejection of optically thick material and possibly bipolar jets, a phenomenon observed in only a small fraction of symbiotic stars. These findings establish V4141 Sgr as an intriguing target for continued monitoring.

 - **Abstract**
 Symbiotic stars, interacting binaries composed of a cool giant and a hot compact companion, exhibit complex variability across the electromagnetic spectrum. Over the past decades, large-scale photometric and spectroscopic surveys from ground- and space-based observatories have significantly advanced their discovery and characterization. These datasets have transformed the search for new symbiotic candidates, providing extensive time-domain information crucial for their classification and analysis. This review highlights recent observational results that have expanded the known population of symbiotic stars, refined classification criteria, and enhanced our understanding of their variability. Despite these advances, fundamental questions remain regarding their long-term evolution, mass transfer and accretion processes, or their potential role as progenitors of Type Ia supernovae. With ongoing and upcoming surveys, the coming years promise new discoveries and a more comprehensive picture of these intriguing interacting systems.

 - **Abstract**
 We address the question whether the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) can operate in the near-surface shear layer (NSSL) of the Sun and how it affects the interaction with the dynamo process. Using hydromagnetic mean-field simulations of $\alpha\Omega$-type dynamos in rotating shearing-periodic boxes, we show that for negative shear, the MRI can operate above a certain critical shear parameter. This parameter scales inversely with the equipartition magnetic field strength above which $\alpha$ quenching set in. Like the usual $\Omega$ effect, the MRI produces toroidal magnetic field, but in our Cartesian cases it is found to reduce the resulting magnetic field strength and thus to suppress the dynamo process. In view of the application to the solar NSSL, we conclude that the turbulent magnetic diffusivity may be too large for the MRI to be excited and that therefore only the standard $\Omega$ effect is expected to operate.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of an isolated millisecond pulsar M15O (J2129+1210O) from the globular cluster M15 (NGC 7078) with a period of $\sim$11.06686 ms and a dispersion measure of $\sim$67.44 cm$^{-3}$ pc. Its spin period is so close to the $10^{\text{th}}$ harmonic of the bright pulsar M15A ($\sim$11.06647 ms) and thus missed in previous pulsar search. We suggest adding the spectrum in the pulsar candidate diagnostic plot to identify new signals near the harmonics. M15O has the first spin frequency derivative and the second spin frequency derivative,being 1.79191(5) $\times$ $10^{-14}$ Hz $s^{-2}$ and 3.3133(6)$\times$ $10^{-23}$ Hz $s^{-3}$, respectively. Its projected distance from the optical centre of M15 is the closest among all the pulsars in M15. The origin can be something from the center of the massive and core-collapsed globular cluster M15.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic-ray air shower detection with the low-frequency part of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) radio telescope is envisioned to yield very high precision measurements of the particle composition of cosmic rays between $10^{16}$ and $10^{18}$ eV. This is made possible by the extreme antenna density of the core of SKA-Low, surpassing the current most dense radio air shower observatory LOFAR by over an order of magnitude. In order to make these measurements, the technical implementation of this observation mode and the development of reconstruction methods have to happen hand-in-hand. As a first lower limit of what is obtainable, we apply the current most precise reconstruction methods as used at LOFAR to a first complete simulation of air shower signals for the SKA-Low array. We describe this simulation setup and discuss the obtainable accuracy and resolution. A special focus is put on effects of the dynamic range of the system, beamforming methods to lower the energy threshold, as well as the limits to the mass composition accuracy given by statistical and systematic uncertainties.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observational advances, such as Gaia DR3 GSP-Spec, have highlighted the potential of chemical abundances in tracing and revealing the structure of spiral arms. Building on these studies, we aim to trace the Milky Way's inner spiral arms using chemical abundance data from the Gaia-ESO Survey (GES). By mapping over-densities in [Fe/H] and [Mg/Fe], we seek to identify spiral arms in both radial and vertical planes, detect substructures, and compare our results with recent Galactic chemical evolution models. We used chemical abundance data from the Gaia-ESO Survey to create spatial maps of [Fe/H], [Mg/H], and [Mg/Fe] excess across the Galactic inner disc. We compared our results with the spiral arm models proposed by Spitoni et al. (2023) and Barbillon et al. (2024). For the first time, the inner spiral arms were revealed using chemical abundance patterns. We detected [Fe/H] enhancements and [Mg/Fe] under-abundances that consistently trace the Scutum and Sagittarius arms. A connecting spur between these arms is observed in the [Mg/H] plane. The alignment between our observations and the results of our 2D chemical evolution models reinforces the significance of spiral arm transits in driving both azimuthal and radial variations in chemical abundances. Our results confirm that spiral arms can be traced using stellar chemical abundances with GES data, providing a new perspective on the structure of the inner Galaxy. The consistency between enhanced [Fe/H] and lower [Mg/Fe] ratios, as observed in previous studies, further strengthens the reliability of our findings. The observed spur, bifurcation, and vertical substructures align well with recent models and studies, indicating that chemical maps can significantly contribute to our understanding of Galactic spiral arms.

 - **Abstract**
 We identified known Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs) and Centaurs in the complete Dark Energy Survey (DES) year six catalog (DES Y6) through the Sky Body Tracker (SkyBoT) tool. We classified our dataset of 144 objects into a widely used 4-class taxonomic system of TNOs. No such previous classification was available in the literature for most of these objects. From absolute magnitudes and average albedos, an estimation of the diameters of all these objects is obtained. Correlations involving colours, orbital parameters, dynamical classes and sizes are also discussed. In particular, our largest reddest object has a diameter of $390^{+68}_{-53}$ km and our largest cold classical, $255^{+19}_{-17}$ km. Also, a weak correlation between colour and inclination is found within the population of resonant TNOs in addition to weak correlations between colour and phase slope in different bands.
