 - **Abstract**
 JWST has revealed a new high-redshift population called little red dots (LRDs). Since LRDs may be in the early phase of black hole growth, identifying them in the early universe is crucial for understanding the formation of the first supermassive black holes. However, no robust LRD candidates have been identified at $z>10$, because commonly-used NIRCam photometry covers wavelengths up to $\sim5\,{\rm \mu m}$ and is insufficient to capture the characteristic V-shaped spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of LRDs. In this study, we present the first search for $z\gtrsim10$ LRD candidates using both NIRCam and MIRI imaging from COSMOS-Web, which provides the largest joint NIRCam-MIRI coverage to date ($0.20\,{\rm deg^2}$). Taking advantage of MIRI/F770W to remove contaminants, we identify one robust candidate, CW-LRD-z10 at $z_{\rm phot}=10.5^{+0.7}_{-0.6}$ with $M_{\rm UV}=-19.9^{+0.1}_{-0.2}\,{\rm mag}$. CW-LRD-z10 exhibits a compact morphology, a distinct V-shaped SED, and a non-detection in F115W, all consistent with being an LRD at $z\sim10$. Based on this discovery, we place the first constraint on the number density of LRDs at $z\sim10$ with $M_{\rm UV}\sim-20$ of $1.2^{+2.7}_{-1.0}\times10^{-6}\,{\rm Mpc^{-3}\,mag^{-1}}$, suggesting that the fraction of LRDs among the overall galaxy population increases with redshift, reaching $\sim3\%$ at $z\sim10$. Although deep spectroscopy is necessary to confirm the redshift and the nature of CW-LRD-z10, our results imply that LRDs may be a common population at $z>10$, playing a key role in the first supermassive black hole formation.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the kilonova emission resulting from outflows produced in a three-dimensional (3D) general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulation of a hypermassive neutron star (HMNS) remnant. We map the outflows into the FLASH hydrodynamics code to model their expansion in axisymmetry, and study the effects of employing different $r$-process heating rates. Except for the highest heating rate prescription, we find no significant differences with respect to overall ejecta dynamics and morphology compared to the simulation without heating. Once homologous expansion is attained, typically after $\sim$ 2s for these ejecta, we map the outflows to the Sedona radiative transfer code and compute the spectral evolution of the kilonova and broadband light curves in various LSST bands. The kilonova properties depend on the remnant lifetime, with peak luminosities and peak timescales increasing for longer-lived remnants that produce more massive ejecta. For all models, there is a strong dependence of both the bolometric and broadband light curves on the viewing angle. While the short-lived (12ms) remnant produces higher luminosities when viewed from angles closer to the pole, longer-lived remnants (240ms and 2.5s) are more luminous when viewed from angles closer to the equator. Our results highlight the importance of self-consistent, long-term modeling of merger ejecta, and taking viewing-angle dependence into account when interpreting observed kilonova light curves. We find that magnetized outflows from a HMNS -- if it survives long enough -- could explain blue kilonovae, such as the blue emission seen in AT2017gfo.
#### Discovery of an $\rm[Fe/H] \sim -4.8$ Star in $Gaia$ XP Spectra

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the discovery of GDR3_526285 ($Gaia$ DR3 Source ID 5262850721755411072), a star with $\rm[Fe/H] = -4.82 \pm 0.25$ and one of the lowest metal ($\text{atomic number} > 2$) mass fractions ever found ($Z_{\rm GDR3\_526585} \lesssim 1.0 \times 10^{-6}$). We first identified it as an ultra metal-poor (UMP; $\rm[Fe/H] < -4$) red giant-branch (RGB) star candidate in the $Gaia$ BP/RP (XP) spectro-photometric catalog ($Gaia$ $G$ magnitude $\approx$15). A combination of multi-band photometry and high-resolution spectroscopic analysis under local thermodynamic equilibrium confirmed the status of GDR3_526285 as a distant ($\approx$24 kpc from the Sun) RGB star ($T_{\rm eff} = 4596\,{\rm K}$, $\log g = 0.88$) in the Milky Way's outer halo. We obtain only an upper limit for the carbon abundance of $\rm[C/H] < -4.32$, resulting in $\rm[C/Fe] < +0.50$. A correction for the evolutionary carbon depletion ($\Delta \rm[C/Fe] = +0.68$) brings the nominal carbon-to-iron ratio upper limit to $\rm[C/Fe]_{\rm cor} < +1.18$. Given its extraordinarily low [C/H], GDR3_526285 likely formed from gas cooled via dust grains rather than fine structure line cooling. The kinematics of GDR3_526285 suggests that this star was either dynamically perturbed by the infall of the Magellanic system or was formerly a member of the Magellanic Clouds and was later stripped by the Milky Way. Our results showcase the potential of an all-sky search for low-metallicity targets with $Gaia$ XP and confirm that the methodology described here is an useful "treasure map" for finding additional UMP stars.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents the first study of the most massive globular cluster (GC) in the Milky Way, omega Centauri, employing recently acquired JWST deep images. By combining these data with archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images, we derived proper motions (PMs) for a significant portion of the JWST field. Our analysis of the colour-magnitude diagram (CMD) reveals two prominent sequences extending from a magnitude F322W2 ~ 17.5 to the bottom of the main sequence (MS). These sequences correspond to the two main stellar populations of omega Centauri: the bMS (He-rich) and rMS (He-normal) populations. The two sequences intersect at the MS knee (F322W2 ~ 19.5) and change positions for lower magnitudes, with the bMS luminosity function (LF) ending at least ~0.5 magnitudes brighter than the rMS LF. We identified a third group of stars (named gMS) along the main sequence located between the two primary ones and conducted a detailed analysis of the LFs and MFs for these three stellar populations. The LFs of these sequences show similar trends, with the rMS being the most populated and the bMS the least. The MFs display distinct power-law slopes: the rMS is well fitted by a single power-law while the gMS and the bMS are characterised by MFs steeper than that of the rMS for masses larger than 0.2 solar masses and flatter MFs for smaller masses. The flattening around ~0.2 solar masses for the gMS and the bMS might be a real feature of the MFs of these populations or due to uncertainties in the adopted mass-luminosity relationship (MLR). The variation in the slope of the MFs of the gMS and bMS contributes to the steepening (flattening) of the combined MF for masses higher (lower) than 0.2 solar masses.

 - **Abstract**
 While much work has gone into associating neutrino emission with various sources, very few sources have emerged. With the recent publication of IceCube Event Catalog (IceCat-1), the IceCube neutrino observatory has released a list of the most promising astrophysical neutrino events since operations began in 2010. Using the archival data from the High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) gamma-ray observatory, we perform a coincidence search for gamma rays and neutrinos using a Bayesian Block algorithm with the public IceCube alerts from IceCat-1 and the Astrophysical Multi-messenger Observatory Network (AMON). Of the 350 alerts considered, 25 detections were found, with 1 coinciding with the flaring HAWC source Markarian 421, an active galactic nuclei. We present the performance of this method and a discussion of physics implications.

 - **Abstract**
 We compute the full cosmic trajectories of the early Universe across the QCD phase diagram as the plasma cools from $T\simeq500\,$MeV to $30\,$MeV, assuming $\beta$-equilibrated matter. The trajectories are obtained by simultaneously solving baryon-number, electric-charge, and lepton-asymmetry conservation, closed by a state-of-the-art lattice-QCD equation of state: a fourth-order Taylor expansion in the chemical potentials that merges the latest $(2\!+\!1)$-flavor susceptibilities with charm-quark contributions, thus delivering a consistent $(2\!+\!1\!+\!1)$-flavor equation of state. Results are compared with an ideal quark-gluon plasma and with a hadron-resonance gas to highlight interaction effects. Two cases of primordial lepton asymmetries are analyzed: a symmetric configuration $(\ell_e=\ell_\mu=\ell_\tau=\ell/3)$ and an asymmetric one $(\ell_e=0,\;\ell_\mu=-\ell_\tau)$. Increasing $|\ell|$ systematically drives the trajectories toward larger values of $\mu_B$ and more negative $\mu_Q$. In the asymmetric case, a non-monotonic bounce develops when the $\tau$ chemical potential reaches $m_\tau$, generating a maximum in $\mu_B(T)$, the position of which depends on $\ell_\tau$. Assuming a modest $\mu_{Q}$-dependence of the lattice-QCD critical end point estimates (obtained at $\mu_{Q} = 0$), the trajectories for all lepton asymmetries explored ($|\ell|\lesssim 0.1$) lie to their left, implying that in a standard cosmological scenario the QCD transition is almost certainly a smooth crossover. Nevertheless, we estimate the magnitude of baryon and lepton asymmetries needed to obtain a cosmic trajectory closer to the QCD critical point, providing inputs for future studies of the strong-interaction epoch.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive multiwavelength analysis of GRB 240825A, a bright gamma-ray burst (GRB) detected by Fermi and Swift, with a prompt duration ($T_{\rm 90}$ ~ 4 sec in 50-300 keV) near the boundary separating short and long GRBs, prompting a detailed investigation into its classification and progenitor. Using classical prompt metrics (duration, minimum variability timescale (MVT), lag, and spectral hardness) and modern classification techniques (machine-learning (ML) based t-SNE, support vector machine, energy-hardness-duration, and $\epsilon \equiv E_{\gamma,\mathrm{iso},52} / E_{p,z,2}^{5/3}$), we find GRB 240825A exhibits hybrid characteristics. The short MVT (13.830 $\pm$ 1.574 ms), rest-frame duration, and ML-based classification indicate a merger-like or ambiguous nature, while its energetics and position on the Amati relation favor a collapsar origin. We conducted deep optical and NIR photometric and spectroscopic late-time search for an associated supernova (SN)/kilonova (KN) and the host galaxy using 10.4 m GTC and 8.4 m binocular LBT telescopes. No bright SN (like SN 1998bw) is detected down to stringent limits (e.g., $m_r > 26.1$ mag at 17.59 days), despite a redshift of $z$ = 0.659 measured from GTC spectroscopy. Host galaxy SED modeling with Prospector indicates a massive, dusty, and star-forming galaxy-typical of collapsar GRB hosts, though with low sSFR and large offset. We compare these findings with hybrid events like GRB 211211A, GRB 230307A, GRB 200826A, including SNe-GRBs, and conclude that GRB 240825A likely originated from a massive star collapse, with the associated supernova obscured by a dusty host environment or low luminosity SN with absolute magnitude M$_{V}$ fainter than -18.0. This study emphasizes the need for multiwavelength follow-up and a multi-layered classification to determine GRB progenitors.

 - **Abstract**
 With over two dozen detections in the Milky Way, double neutron stars (DNSs) provide a unique window into massive binary evolution. We use the POSYDON binary population synthesis code to model DNS populations and compare them to the observed Galactic sample. By tracing their origins to underlying single and binary star physics, we place constraints on the detailed evolutionary stages leading to DNS formation. Our study reveals a bifurcation within the well-known common envelope formation channel for DNSs, which naturally explains an observed split in the orbital periods of the Galactic systems. The two sub-channels are defined by whether the donor star has a helium core (Case B mass transfer) or a carbon-oxygen core (Case C) at the onset of the common envelope, with only the helium core systems eventually merging due to gravitational wave-modulated orbital decay. However, producing DNSs through both sub-channels requires either a generous core definition of $\simeq$ 30% H-fraction or a high common envelope ejection efficiency of $\alpha_{\rm CE}\gtrsim1.2$. By testing different supernova kick velocity models, we find that galactic DNSs are best reproduced using a prescription that favors low velocity kicks ($\lesssim 50 \, \rm km/s$), in agreement with previous studies. Furthermore, our models indicate that merging DNSs are born from a stripped progenitor with a median pre-supernova envelope mass $\sim$ 0.2$M_{\odot}$. Our results highlight the value of detailed evolutionary models for improving our understanding of exotic binary star formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Soft X-ray emission from neutron stars affords powerful diagnostic tools for uncovering their surface and interior properties, as well as their geometric configurations. In the atmospheres of neutron stars, the presence of magnetic fields alters the photon-electron scattering cross sections, resulting in non-trivial angular dependence of intensity and polarization of the emergent signals. This paper presents recent developments of our Monte Carlo simulation, MAGTHOMSCATT, which tracks the complex electric field vector for each photon during its transport. Our analysis encompasses the anisotropy and polarization characteristics of X-ray emission for field strengths ranging from non-magnetic to extremely magnetized regimes that are germane to magnetars. In the very low field domain, we reproduced the numerical solution to the radiative transfer equation for non-magnetic Thomson scattering, and provided analytical fits for the angular dependence of the intensity and the polarization degree. These fits can be useful for studies of millisecond pulsars and magnetic white dwarfs. By implementing a refined injection protocol, we show that, in the magnetar regime, the simulated intensity and polarization pulse profiles of emission from extended surface regions becomes invariant with respect to the ratio of photon ($\omega$) and electron cyclotron ($\omega_{\rm B}$) frequencies once $\omega / \omega_{\rm B} \lesssim 0.01$. This circumvents the need for simulations pertinent to really high magnetic field strengths, which are inherently slower. Our approach will be employed elsewhere to model observational data to constrain neutron star geometric parameters and properties of emitting hot spots on their surfaces.

 - **Abstract**
 The Subaru-Asahi StarCam is a high-sensitivity live-streaming camera for meteor observation, installed on the dome of the Subaru Telescope at the summit area of Maunakea, Hawai'i. Although it was originally intended to share the Maunakea night sky with the public, including the local Hawai'i community, the system quickly demonstrated its potential for scientific research, owing to its highly sensitive video capabilities and the exceptional fraction of clear nights at the site. The core of the StarCam system features a Sony FX3 camera body paired with an F1.4 wide-angle lens, offering a field of view of 70 deg by 40 deg. Leveraging a state-of-the-art, high-sensitivity CMOS sensor and a bright lens, the system is capable of capturing stars as faint as magnitude 8 in real-time, with an effective frame rate of 15--30 fps. Live streaming via YouTube began in April 2021, and the feed is constantly monitored by more than a hundred viewers at any given nighttime. This has enabled the camera to be used not only for observing regular meteor showers but also for monitoring scientifically important phenomena such as fireballs or unexpected meteor outbursts. Notable scientific achievements include: 1) Detection of the new Arid meteor shower in 2021, 2) Identification of a sub-peak activity in the Gamma-Perseid meteor shower (2021), 3) Detection of the 2022 Tau-Herculid meteor shower outburst, 4) Confirmation of the activity of the Andromedid meteor shower (2021), and 5) Multiple detections of meteor cluster phenomena. We discuss the potential and the future scope of StarCam as an open-access, real-time data platform for citizen science in meteor observations.
#### Signature of a magnetar central engine with precession motion in the X-ray emission of GRB 220711B

 - **Abstract**
 The $\gamma$-ray light curve of long-duration GRB 220711B, is characterized by a multi-peaked structure with a duration lasting $\sim$105 seconds. More interestingly, the X-ray afterglow light curve is composed of a plateau emission smoothly connected with a $\sim t^{-2}$ segment overlapping some flares followed by an extremely steep decay. By analysing the light curves of both prompt emission and X-ray afterglow, no high-confidence-level quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) signals are found in the light curves of the prompt emission (e.g., BAT and GBM), but it is found that a QPO signal at $\sim$ 50 s above 6$\sigma$ confidence level indeed exist in the X-ray afterglow. Here, we propose that a supra-massive magnetar as the central engine of GRB 220711B with precession motion is a good interpretation of the features of the X-ray emission. The initial plateau emission and followed decay segment, as well as the extremely steep-decay segment, are consistent with the physical process of supra-massive magnetar spin-down and then collapse into black hole. Moreover, the QPO signal in the X-ray emission can be explained as an effect of the precession motion of the magnetar. If this is the case, one can derive various magnetar parameters such as the initial period ($P_{\rm{0}}$) and surface magnetic field strength ($B_{\rm{p}}$) within a pseudo-redshift range of [1.08, 4.27]. By considering beaming corrections with jet opening angle $5^{\circ}$, we find that $P_{\rm{0}}$ and $B_{\rm{p}}$ lie within the range of [1.87, 6.25] ms and [$1.47\times 10^{16}$, $3.09\times 10^{16}$] G, respectively. The parameter of $B_{\rm{p}}$ is slightly larger than that of other typical long-duration GRBs, but $P_{\rm{0}}$ fall in a reasonable range.
#### A Joint Search for the Electromagnetic Counterpart to the Gravitational-Wave Binary Black-Hole Merger Candidate S250328ae with the Dark Energy Camera and the Prime Focus Spectrograph

 - **Abstract**
 The first detection of an optical counterpart to a gravitational wave signal revealed that collaborative efforts between instruments with different specializations provide a unique opportunity to acquire impactful multi-messenger data. We present results of such a joint search with the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) and Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS) for the optical counterpart of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA event S250328ae, a binary black hole merger candidate of high significance detected at a distance of 511$\pm$82 Mpc and localized within an area of 3 (15) square degrees at 50% (90%) confidence. We observed the 90% confidence area with DECam and identified 36 high-confidence transient candidates after image processing, candidate selection, and candidate vetting. We observed with PFS to obtain optical spectra of DECam candidates, Swift-XRT candidates, and potential host galaxies of S250328ae. In total, 3897 targets were observed by seven pointings covering ~50% of the 90% confidence area. After template fitting and visual inspection, we identified 12 SNe, 159 QSOs, 2975 galaxies, and 131 stars. With the joint observations of DECam and PFS, we found variability in 12 SNe, 139 QSOs, 37 galaxies, and 2 stars. We do not identify any confident optical counterparts, though the association is not ruled out for three variable candidates that are not observed by PFS and 6 QSO candidates without clear variability if the optical counterpart of S250328ae is faint. Despite the lack of confident optical counterparts, this paper serves as a framework for future collaborations between wide-field imagers and multi-object spectrographs to maximize multi-messenger analyses.

 - **Abstract**
 Using a 3D non-linear mean-field solar dynamo model, we investigate the magnetic helicity flux and magnetic twist, and tilt parameters of bipolar magnetic regions (BMRs) emerging from the solar convection zone due to the magnetic buoyancy instability. The twist and tilt of the BMR magnetic field are modeled as a result of an effective electromotive force along the rising part of the toroidal magnetic field. This force generates the poloidal field that tilts the whole magnetic configuration. We find that variations of BMR's twist and tilt determine the magnitude and the sign of the magnetic helicity flux on the solar surface. The model shows that the helicity flux associated with the BMR's tilt/twist is the dominant contribution to the BMR helicity at the beginning of the BMR's evolution, while the effect of differential rotation is the main source of the helicity flux at the final stage of the BMR's evolution. We discuss the implications of these effects on the basic properties and variations of the hemispheric helicity rule of active regions on the solar surface.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the geometrical effects affecting the production and absorption of gamma-ray radiation emitted in inverse Compton scattering in the synchrotron-self-Compton process. We evaluate the effect of the anisotropy of the radiation field seen by the scattering electrons homogeneously distributed in the emission region. Next, we also consider inhomogeneous distribution of electrons and investigate the effect of it in the spherically symmetric emission region. We also study a cylindrical shape of the emission region and its effect on the isotropy of the emitted radiation. We obtain simple numerical factors that scale the emission for different assumptions about the geometry of the emission region and the distribution of the emitting electrons. For a 3D Gaussian spatial distribution of the electrons we obtain 0.222 times lower flux than for homogeneous emission region. Finally, we also evaluate the absorption of the radiation produced in the different scenarios, and compare the full calculations with the two most commonly assumed simplifications. We find that for cases when the absorption is lesser than by one order of magnitude, the full calculations for homogeneous sphere can be well approximated with homogeneously-emitting slab, while the absorption in the case of 3D Gaussian distribution of electrons is significantly weaker.

 - **Abstract**
 Studying stream interaction regions (SIRs), from their inception and the dynamics of their development, can provide insight into solar-terrestrial connections. Some in-situ instruments on the Solar Orbiter (SolO) space mission are designed to measure solar wind (SW) and interplanetary magnetic field parameters along the flight path. These instruments are ideal for studying the dynamics of SIR evolution at heliocentric distances of 0.28-1.0 AU and with changes in heliolatitude of 0^{\circ} - 33^{\circ}. To address the challenges of promptly identifying SIRs and predicting their arrival time on Earth, we consider using trigger events from the Radio and Plasma Wave (RPW)/SolO instrument, which are transmitted in telemetry data packages. We suggest that multiple activations of the trigger mode (SBM1 mode) in the RPW instrument over an interval of up to four hours may reflect the fine structure of large-scale events in SW. Such events can serve as markers for the spacecraft's location within the SIR. In this regard, the 2023 analysis revealed that multiple activations of the SBM1 trigger mode throughout the day accounted for more than 50\% of the total number of days for which such events were recorded. Of this number, 63\% were events when the trigger algorithm was prompted repeatedly within a time interval of up to four hours. A comparison of the registration times of SBM1 trigger events with the SW parameters obtained from the SWA-PAS and MAG instruments showed that repeated activations of the trigger algorithm occurred at the stream interface surface when a high-speed SW stream and a formed compression region were present.

 - **Abstract**
 The space-based CUbesat Solar Polarimeter (CUSP) mission aims to measure the linear polarization of solar flares in the hard X-ray band by means of a Compton scattering polarimeter. CUSP will allow to study the magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration in the flaring magnetic structures of our star with its unprecedented sensitivity to solar flare polarization. CUSP is a project in the framework of the Alcor Program of the Italian Space Agency aimed to develop new CubeSat missions. It has been proposed as a constellation of a two Cubesat mission to monitor the Sun for Space Weather, and will proceed with a single-satellite asset in its baseline implementation. In the frame of CUSP's Phase B study, that started in December 2024 for a 1-year period, we present the development status of this dual-phase polarimeter. Preliminary laboratory results using two chains of acquisition will be discussed. The first chain of acquisition, based on the Hamamatsu R7600 multi-anode photomultiplier tubes coupled to plastic scintillator bars and read out by the MAROC-3A ASIC, is used to detect the Compton scattering of incoming photons. On the other hand, GAGG crystals coupled to avalanche photo-diodes with a readout based on the SKIROC-2A ASIC are used to absorb the scattered photons. By reconstructing the azimuthal scattering direction for many incoming photons, one can infer the linear polarization degree and angle of the source. We will discuss the calibration results obtained with our prototype detector by using well-known radioactive isotopes, allowing us to assess the performances of our detector over the full 25-100 keV energy range.

CUSP will allow to study the magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration in the flaring magnetic structures of our star. CUSP is a project in the framework of the Alcor Program of the Italian Space Agency aimed to develop new CubeSat missions. CUSP undergoing the Phase B started in December 2024 that will last for 12 month. The Compton polarimeter of the CUSP payload performs coincidence measurements between plastic scintilaltors and GaGG(Ce) crystals to derive the polarization of X-rays. These sensors are readout by Multi Anode Photomultiplier Tubes (MAPMTs) and Avalanche Photodiodes (APDs) respectively. Both sensors need an HV power supply up to -1~kV (for the MAPMT) and +500~V (for the APD). We tested precision regulated High Voltage DC/DC Converters by HVM Technology Inc. with Sub-Miniature Case Size ($0.85''\times0.85''\times0.60''$) of the SMHV series. These modules are compact and suited for CubeSat missions.

 - **Abstract**
 Lorentz symmetry is a cornerstone of modern physics, and testing its validity remains a critical endeavor. In this work, we analyze the photon time-of-flight and time-shift data from LHAASO observations of Gamma-Ray Burst GRB 221009A to search for signatures of Lorentz violation. We employed the DisCan (dispersion cancellation) method with various information entropies as cost functions, designating the results obtained with Shannon entropy as our representative outcome. This choice is attributed to the parameter-free statistical properties of Shannon entropy, which has demonstrated remarkable stability as we continually refine and enhance our methodology. In the absence of more detailed data and physical context, it provides more stable and reliable results. We constrain the energy scale associated with Lorentz invariance violation. Our results yield 95\% confidence level lower limits of $E_{\text{QG},1} > 5.4 \times 10^{19} \, \text{GeV}$ (subluminal) and $E_{\text{QG},1} > 2.7 \times 10^{19} \, \text{GeV}$ (superluminal) for the linear case ($n$=1), and $E_{\text{QG},2} > 10.0 \times 10^{12} \, \text{GeV}$ (subluminal) and $E_{\text{QG},2} > 2.4 \times 10^{12} \, \text{GeV}$ (superluminal) for the quadratic case ($n$=2). Subsequently, we incorporated WCDA photons and the Knuth binning method to further optimize and complement our approach, while also performing filter using information entropies. Furthermore, we demonstrate that employing different information entropy measures as cost functions does not alter the order of magnitude of these constraints.

 - **Abstract**
 The magnitude gap between the central and satellite galaxies encodes information about the mass accretion history of a dark matter halo, and serves as a useful observational probe for the mass distribution in a halo. In this work, we perform the first weak lensing test of the connections between the magnitude gap and the halo profile. We measure the halo profiles of isolated central galaxies (ICGs) selected primarily from the SDSS Main Galaxy Sample. Halo mass and concentration are inferred by fitting stacked lensing profiles in bins of central luminosity, $L_\mathrm{c}$, and the central-satellite magnitude gap, $L_\mathrm{gap}$. We detect dependence on the magnitude gap in both halo properties. The dependence is the strongest in the ICG luminosity range of $10^{10.3}<L_\mathrm{c}[h^{-2}L_\odot]\leq 10^{10.7}$, where halos with smaller gaps have higher masses and lower concentrations. When $10^{10.7} <L_c[h^{-2}L_\odot] \leq 10^{11.1}$, however, no significant gap dependence is detected. In the range of $10^{9.9}<L_\mathrm{c}[h^{-2}L_\odot] \leq 10^{10.3}$, a disordering of the gap dependence is marginally observable. We compare the observational results with predictions by two lightcone catalogs built from the Illustris TNG300 and the Millennium simulations. The gap dependence in the two mock samples show overall consistency with observations, but neither matches them in all $L_\mathrm{c}$ bins to a quantitative level. We also compare the significance of the gap dependence on halo mass and concentration and find that our measurement prefers gap dependence in both parameters, while the halo mass dependence is preferred over the concentration if only one of the two dependencies is allowed.
#### On type 1 active galactic nuclei with double-peaked [O~{\sc iii}]. II. properties of long-term optical variability

 - **Abstract**
 Double-peaked \oiii~profiles could potentially indicate kiloparsec-scale dual AGNs. We analyze long-term optical light curves of 35 type 1 AGNs with such features from our recent catalog in Zheng et al. (2025). These light curves are obtained from the Catalina Sky Survey and modeled using a Damped Random Walk (DRW) process. A control sample of 210 normal type 1 AGNs matched in redshift, intrinsic luminosity, and black hole mass is also studied. If the double-peaked \oiii~are caused by two type 1 AGNs (dual type 1 AGN), then the combined variability from the two AGNs would be expected to differ from that of a single type 1 AGN. However, there is no statistically significant difference in the variability timescale $\tau$ and intrinsic variability amplitude $\sigma$ between these double-peaked AGNs and the control sample of 210 normal type 1 AGNs. Crucially, computer simulations reveal that dual AGN systems systematically produce lower variability amplitudes than single AGNs, which is inconsistent with the observed variability properties of our double-peaked \oiii~sample. Moreover, simulations suggest that the fraction of dual type 1 AGNs is $\sim$ 3\%, indicating that double-peaked \oiii~may not be a reliable indicator of dual type 1 AGNs in these systems. However, this does not rule out the possibility that some objects may still host dual AGNs involving other combinations, such as type 1+type 2 AGNs. Future studies with larger samples and higher-quality light curves will help clarify the true nature of these systems.

 - **Abstract**
 The Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy is undoubtedly being disrupted in the tidal field of the Milky Way. The Milky Way disc is also found to be in a state of disequilibrium. The role of the Sagittarius in driving or contributing to this disequilibrium has been extensively investigated. Most of these studies, however, assume an initially near-equilibrium disc. It was also hypothesized that the passage of Sagittarius could have increased the star-forming activity in the Solar Neighbourhood. We check whether galaxies that have undergone cosmological evolution are affected by interactions analogous to those between the Sagittarius and the Milky Way. We use the high-resolution simulation TNG50 to look for pairs similar to the Milky Way and Sagittarius. We search within redshift z=1-0 for discs from the MW/M31 sample that interacted with a satellite more massive than 10 billion Msun, had a pericenter smaller than 50 kpc, and was on an approximately polar orbit. We exclude cases where, within 1 Gyr of the pericenter, a similar interaction occurred. In 90 percent of cases, a passage of the Sagittarius analogue had no significant effect on either the vertical velocity field of the disc or the star formation history. A response in vertical stellar kinematics can be found mostly in cold discs and mildly correlates with the strength of interactions. For star formation, the studied interactions had an effect only when little to no star formation was ongoing prior to the interaction, often due to previously disturbed star-forming discs, e.g., from AGN activity. Our results indicate that stellar discs in TNG50 are frequently vertically perturbed preceding pericenter passages of Sagittarius analogues. Future studies using other simulations and extragalactic surveys will help establish whether vertical disequilibrium is a common feature of disc galaxies or an artifact of the specific setup studied.

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of large scale magnetic fields in the Universe is widely thought to be from early Universe processes, like inflation or phase transitions. These magnetic fields evolve via magnetohydrodynamic processes until the epoch of recombination. When structures begin to form in the later Universe, the conservation of magnetic flux amplifies the magnetic fields via the adiabatic collapse of gravitationally bound gas clouds hosting the magnetic fields and moves them to smaller scales. In this work, we have semi-analytically studied this forward cascade effect, considering simple models of gravitational collapse of structures. We find that this simple model is able to reproduce the general qualitative features of the evolution of the magnetic field spectrum as seen from magnetized cosmological simulations.
#### A Novel Formation Channel for Supermassive Black Hole Binaries in the Early Universe via Primordial Black Holes

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel formation channel for supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries in the early Universe, driven by primordial black holes (PBHs). Using high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations, we explore the role of massive PBHs ($m_{\rm BH} \sim 10^6 M_\odot$) in catalyzing the formation of direct-collapse black holes (DCBHs), providing a natural in situ pathway for binary SMBH formation. PBHs enhance local overdensities, accelerate structure formation, and exert thermal feedback on the surrounding medium via accretion. Lyman-Werner (LW) radiation from accreting PBHs suppresses H$2$ cooling, shifting the dominant gas coolant to atomic hydrogen. When combined with significant baryon--dark matter streaming velocities ($v_{\rm b\chi} \gtrsim 0.8 \sigma_{\rm b\chi}$, where $\sigma_{\rm b\chi}$ is the root-mean-square streaming velocity), these effects facilitate the formation of dense, gravitationally unstable, atomically cooling gas clouds in the PBH wake. These clouds exhibit sustained high inflow rates ($\dot{M}_{\rm infall} \gtrsim 10^{-2}-10^{-1} M_\odot \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$), providing ideal conditions for DCBH formation from rapidly growing supermassive stars of $\sim 10^5 M_\odot$ at redshift $z\sim 10-20$. The resulting systems form SMBH binaries with initial mass ratios $q\sim O(0.1)$ and separations of $\sim 10$ pc. Such PBH--DCBH binaries provide testable predictions for JWST and ALMA, potentially explaining high-$z$ sources such as Little Red Dots, and represent gravitational-wave sources for future missions like LISA and TianQin, bridging early-Universe black hole physics, multi-messenger astronomy, and dark matter theory.

 The CUbesat Solar Polarimeter (CUSP) aims to measure the linear polarization of solar flares in the 25-100 keV X-ray band using a Compton scattering polarimeter. CUSP will allow us to study the magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration in the flaring magnetic structures of our star by providing high-sensitivity polarization measurements. CUSP is a project in the framework of the Alcor Program of the Italian Space Agency aimed to develop innovative CubeSat technologies and missions. As part of CUSPs Phase B study, which began in December 2024 and will continue for one year, we present the development status of the Geant4 based simulator to accurately simulate the detectors response and initial results on the sensitivity of the instrument. Geant4 Monte Carlo simulation is used to assess the physical interactions of the source photons with the detector and the passive materials. We implemented a detailed CUSP Mass Model within Geant4 to simulate and estimate the instruments sensitivity, correcting the geometric effects of the instrument. We also evaluated the effect of backscattering shielding on the sensitivity to optimize the mass model of the instrument.

 - **Abstract**
 The Earth's earliest magnetic field may have originated in a basal magma ocean, a layer of silicate melt surround the core that could have persisted for billions of years. Recent studies show that the electrical conductivity of liquid with a bulk silicate Earth composition exceeds 10000 S/m at basal magma ocean conditions, potentially surprising the threshold for dynamo activity. Over most of its history however, the basal magma ocean is more enriched in iron than the bulk silicate Earth, due to iron's incompatibility in the mineral assemblages of the lower mantle. Using ab-initio molecular dynamics calculations, we examine how iron content affects the silicate dynamo hypothesis. We investigate how the electrical conductivity of silicate liquid changes with iron enrichment, at pressures and temperatures relevant for Earth's basal magma ocean. We also compute the electronic contribution to the thermal conductivity , to evaluate convective instability of basal magma oceans. Finally, we apply our results to model the thermal and magnetic evolution of Earth's basal magma ocean over time.
