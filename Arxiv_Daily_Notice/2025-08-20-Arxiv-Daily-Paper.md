#### MrMARTIAN: A Multi-resolution Mass Reconstruction Algorithm Combining Free-form and Analytic Components
 - **Authors:** Sangjun Cha, M. James Jee
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13262

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.13262

 - **Abstract**
 We present ${\tt MrMARTIAN}$ (Multi-resolution MAximum-entropy Reconstruction Technique Integrating Analytic Node), a new hybrid strong lensing (SL) modeling algorithm. By incorporating physically motivated analytic nodes into the free-form method ${\tt MARS}$, ${\tt MrMARTIAN}$ enables stable and flexible mass reconstructions while mitigating oversmoothing in the inner mass profile. Its multi-resolution framework increases the degrees of freedom in regions with denser strong lensing constraints, thereby enhancing computational efficiency for a fixed number of free parameters. We evaluate the performance of ${\tt MrMARTIAN}$ using publicly available simulated SL data and find that it consistently outperforms ${\tt MARS}$ in recovering both mass and magnification. In particular, it delivers significantly more stable reconstructions when multiple images are sparsely distributed. Finally, we apply ${\tt MrMARTIAN}$ to the galaxy cluster MACS J0416.1--2403, incorporating two analytic nodes centered on the northeastern and southwestern BCGs. Our mass model, constrained by 412 multiple images, achieves an image-plane rms scatter of ~0".11, the smallest to date for this dataset.
#### Earth-Mass Planets in Tandem Disks

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents a new terrestrial planet formation theory demonstrating that Earth-mass planets form naturally in tandem protosolar disks. Our model builds upon tandem planet formation theory (Ebisuzaki and Imaeda 2017; Imaeda and Ebisuzaki 2017a,b, 2018), incorporating magneto-rotational instability (MRI) suppression (Balbus and Hawley 1991; Hawley and Balbus 1991), porous particle aggregation (Okuzumi et al. 2012; Kataoka et al. 2013), and standard planet formation mechanisms (e.g., Safronov 1969; Hayashi et al. 1985). In a tandem proto-solar disk, planets form at two distinct locations: the inner and outer edges of the MRI-suppressed region, where solid particles accumulate. The inner edge produces rocky planets, while the outer edge forms gas giants. When planetesimals reach Earth-sized mass at the inner MRI edge, they migrate outward due to gas disk torque. For a protosolar disk accretion rate of M_dot = 10^-7.08 solar masses per year (Case D), the total solid mass at the inner MRI edge reaches 1.99 Earth masses, producing two Earth-mass planets. This result closely matches the solar system's terrestrial planet distribution (Earth and Venus), which comprises 92% of total terrestrial planet mass, providing strong support for our formation mechanism.

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a formation pathway linking black holes (BHs) observed in gravitational-wave (GW) mergers, wide BH-stellar systems uncovered by Gaia, and accreting low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). In this scenario, a stellar-mass BH binary undergoes isolated binary evolution and merges while hosting a distant, dynamically unimportant tertiary stellar companion. The tertiary becomes relevant only after the merger, when the remnant BH receives a GW recoil kick. Depending on the kick velocity and system configuration, the outcome can be: (i) a bright electromagnetic (EM) counterpart to the GW merger; (ii) an LMXB; (iii) a wide BH-stellar companion resembling the Gaia BH population; or (iv) an unbound, isolated BH. Modeling the three-body dynamics, we find that $\sim 0.02\%$ of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) mergers may be followed by an EM counterpart within $\sim$10 days, produced by tidal disruption of the star by the BH. The flare is likely brightest in the optical-UV and lasts days to weeks; in some cases, partial disruption causes recurring flares with a period of $\sim$2 months. We further estimate that this channel can produce $\sim 1-10\%$ of Gaia BH systems in the Milky Way. This scenario provides the first physically motivated link between GW sources, Gaia BHs, and some X-ray binaries, and predicts a rare but robust pathway for EM counterparts to binary BH mergers, potentially detectable in LVK's O5 run.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.13277

 - **Abstract**
 We present SPARCS, which combines the moment-based radiative transfer method SPH-M1RT with the non-equilibrium metal chemistry solver CHIMES in the modern highly-parallel astrophysical code SWIFT. SPARCS enables on-the-fly radiation hydrodynamics simulations, with multi-frequency ultraviolet radiative transfer coupled with all ionisation states of 11 major elements, in the presence of dust, cosmic ray ionization and heating, and self-gravity. Direct radiation pressure on gas and dust is also accounted for. We validate SPARCS against analytic solutions and standard photo-ionization codes such as CLOUDY in idealized tests. As an example application, we simulate an ionization front propagating through an inhomogeneous interstellar medium with solar metallicity. We produce mock optical emission line observations with the level population calculation code HyLight and the diagnostic radiative transfer code RADMC3D. We find that non-equilibrium effects and inhomogeneities can boost the low ion fractions by up to an order of magnitude. Possible applications of SPARCS include studying the dynamical impact of radiation on gas in star-forming regions, and in the interstellar and circumgalactic medium, as well as interpreting line diagnostics in such environments, and galactic or AGN outflows.
#### VIPCALs: A fully-automated calibration pipeline for VLBI data

 - **Abstract**
 Very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) is a powerful technique that can achieve sub-milliarcsecond resolution. However, it requires complex and often manual post-correlation calibration to correct for instrumental, geometric, and propagation-related errors. Unlike connected-element interferometers, VLBI arrays typically provide raw visibilities rather than science-ready data, and existing pipelines are largely semi-automated and reliant on user supervision. We present VIPCALs, a fully automated, end-to-end calibration pipeline for continuum VLBI data that operates without human intervention or prior knowledge of the dataset. Designed for scalability to thousands of sources and heterogeneous archival observations, VIPCALs addresses the needs of initiatives such as the Search for Milli-Lenses (SMILE) project. Implemented in Python using ParselTongue, VIPCALs reproduces the standard AIPS calibration workflow in a fully unsupervised mode. Besides the usual calibration tasks, the pipeline also performs automatic reference antenna selection, calibrator identification, and generates diagnostic outputs for inspection. We validated it on a representative sample of Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) data corresponding to 1 000 sources from the SMILE project. VIPCALs successfully calibrated observations of 955 of the test sources across multiple frequency bands. Over 91% of the calibrated datasets achieved successful fringe fitting on target in at least half of the solutions attempted. The median ratio of calibrated visibilities to initial total visibilities was 0.87. The average processing time was below 10 minutes per dataset, demonstrating both efficiency and scalability. VIPCALs enables robust, reproducible, and fully automated calibration of VLBI continuum data, significantly lowering the entry barrier for VLBI science and making large-scale projects like SMILE feasible.

 - **Abstract**
 Significant advances in observational capabilities are continuously transforming our understanding of the dense environment of galaxy clusters and its impact on individual galaxies. Discerning between intrinsic and externally-induced properties of galaxies, including their gas kinematics, is a key diagnostic in the field of galaxy evolution. In this work, we present MeerKAT HI spectral line observations of the redshift z $\sim$ 0.042 galaxy cluster Abell 3408. A total of 64 galaxies are detected in HI in this X-ray-luminous galaxy cluster (L$_{X}$ $\sim$ 3 $\times$ 10$^{43}$ ergs s$^{-1}$). We model the HI morphology and gas kinematics of the individual galaxies, using a semi-automated pipeline based on CANNUBI and pyBBarolo. The pipeline was developed and tested as part of this study. Of the 64 galaxies detected in the cluster, we successfully modelled 16, while the remaining galaxies exhibit disturbed HI morphologies, insufficient angular or velocity resolution. We combine the galaxies with converged kinematic fits with 67 field galaxies from the MeerKAT spectral line survey early science data ($\langle$z$\rangle$ = 0.0435) to produce a measurement of the Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation (bTFr) that encompasses a broader range of environment and provides a useful comparison. We find a slope ($\alpha$ = 3.66$^{+0.32}_{-0.28}$) for this relation, which is consistent with that found from the MIGHTEE bTFr derived from the same definition. Interestingly, HI detections of the Abell 3408 galaxy cluster galaxies are seen to extend the bTFr of the MIGHTEE sample, both in mass and velocity, despite their cluster environment.
#### Stable magnetic fields and changing starspots on Vega -- An ultra-deep decadal survey at Pic du Midi and OHP

 - **Abstract**
 Monitoring magnetic and activity variations in A- and B-type stars with ultra-weak magnetic fields is essential to understand the origin and evolution of these fields in this region of the HR diagram, with Vega standing as the prototype of this category. We collected high-resolution spectroscopic and spectropolarimetric data with SOPHIE (OHP, 2018) and with NARVAL/NEO-NARVAL (TBL, 2018, 2023, and 2024), yielding a total of 13108 individual spectra. Magnetic field maps were reconstructed using the Zeeman-Doppler Imaging method, while brightness maps were derived with a dedicated code developed for this purpose. The average magnetic field confirms a negative radial-field spot at the pole with stable strength, while the maps reveal the long-term stability of an oblique dipole together with smaller magnetic structures consistently detected across observing epochs. In contrast, brightness maps show strong variations in the location of surface spots on timescales of years, possibly shorter, although the spot contrast remains nearly unchanged between 2012, 2018, 2023, and 2024, with a normalized spectral amplitude of 0.0003. No direct correlation between magnetic and brightness features could be established in the simultaneous SOPHIE and NARVAL dataset of 2018. These results suggest that Vega hosts both a persistent fossil magnetic field and a dynamo-generated component, most likely concentrated in equatorial regions.

 - **Abstract**
 Young neutron stars born with magnetic fields $B\gtrsim 10^{16}$ G become hyperactive as the field inside the star evolves through ambipolar diffusion on a timescale $\sim 10^9$ s. We simulate this process numerically and find that it can eject magnetic loops from the star. The internal magnetic field first diffuses to the crust surrounding the liquid core and then erupts from the surface, taking a significant amount of crustal material with it. The eruption involves magnetic reconnection, generating a giant gamma-ray flare. A significant fraction of the eruption energy is carried by the neutron-rich crustal material, which must go through a phase of decompression and nuclear heating. The massive ejecta should produce additional emission components after the giant flare, including radioactively powered gamma-rays, optical emission, and much later a radio afterglow. The predicted eruptions may rarely happen in observed magnetars in our galaxy, which are relatively old and rarely produce giant flares. The model can, however, explain the extremely powerful flare from SGR 1806-20 in December 2004, its ejecta mass, and afterglow. More active, younger magnetars may produce frequent crustal eruptions and form unusual nebulae. Such hyperactive magnetars are candidates for the central engines of cosmological fast radio bursts (FRBs). We argue that each eruption launches an ultrarelativistic magnetosonic pulse leading the ejecta and steepening into a relativistic shock capable of emitting an FRB.

 - **Abstract**
 MRC 0600-399, in the merging galaxy cluster Abell 3376, is one of the unique Head-Tail radio galaxies having abruptly bending structures, the origin of which is still under discussion. A previous study suggested that the interaction between the jets and the magnetic fields on the cold front has produced such an outstanding feature; however, it is still not known how the jet propagates the long distance keeping the sharp shape. In this study, we performed a polarization analysis of MRC 0600-399 and a nearby radio source using MeerKAT L-band data. To interpret the Faraday structure, we constructed the Pseudo-3D visualization map of the reconstructed Faraday dispersion function 3D cube. MRC 0600-399 has a complicated Faraday depth structure, and some of the Faraday depth features are in good agreement with the 2D structure on the celestial sphere. For the northern jet of MRC 0600-399, the Faraday depth values show a clear gap at the tip region. Based on the polarization analysis and comparison with the other observation, we concluded that the synchrotron radiation from the tip region of the northern jet originates from the magnetic field on the cold front.
#### High-Resolution Observation of Solar Prominence Plumes Induced by Enhanced Spicular Activity

 - **Abstract**
 Solar prominences are the most prominent large-scale structures observed above the solar limb in emission in chromospheric lines but in absorption in coronal lines. At the bottom of prominences often appears a bubble, with plumes occasionally rising from the prominence-bubble interface. The plumes may potentially play an important role in the mass supply and thermodynamic evolution of prominences, but their nature and generation mechanism are elusive. Here we use the high-resolution H-alpha observations obtained by the New Vacuum Solar Telescope (NVST) to investigate a quiescent prominence with bubbles and plumes on 8 November 2022. Within an interval of about two hours, enhanced spicular activity disturb the prominence-bubble interface, producing bursts of small-scale plumes rising through the prominence. Characterized by clustered spicules jetting at higher speeds (sometimes exceeding the typical chromopsheric Alfven speed) and longer life-time (over 15 minutes), the enhanced spicular activity differs markedly from regular spicules. We hence conjecture that the enhanced spicular activity may drive shock waves, which trigger the magnetic Richtmyer-Meshkov instability at the prominence-bubble interface, leading to the formation of small-scale plumes. These observations provide evidence that the enhanced spicular activity plays a potentially important role in the dynamic evolution of bubbles and plumes, thereby participating in the mass supply of solar prominences.
#### Little Red reionization factories

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.13541

 - **Abstract**
 In this note, we suggest the possibility that an elucidation of the nature of the numerous Little Red Dots (LRDs) at high redshifts, may facilitate the resolution of another concurrent cosmic puzzle, namely reionization. Specifically, it is hypothesized that intergalactic HI gas is compelled by the tidal field associated with a growing gravitational entropy, in the form of gas streams, into colliding at the LRD sites. The resulting shock heating and compression encourage starburst activities, which subsequently photo-ionize the gas into HII, that in turn shines into the rest-optical via bremsstrahlung radiation within the minimal-timescale-cutoff (i.e., red) regime, before escaping back into the intergalactic space, propelled by the newly fusion-injected energy.
#### X-ray selected broad absorption line quasars in SDSS-V: BALs and non-BALs span the same range of X-ray properties

 - **Abstract**
 Broad absorption line (BAL) quasars are often considered X-ray weak relative to their optical/UV luminosity, whether intrinsically (i.e., the coronal emission is fainter) or due to large column densities of absorbing material. The SDSS-V is providing optical spectroscopy for samples of quasar candidates identified by eROSITA as well as Chandra, XMM or Swift, making the resulting datasets ideal for characterising the BAL quasar population within an X-ray selected sample. We use the Balnicity Index (BI) to identify the BAL quasars based on absorption of the CIV $\lambda\,1549$ emission line in the optical spectra, finding 143 BAL quasars in our sample of 2317 X-ray selected quasars within $1.5\le z \le3.5$. This observed BAL fraction of $\approx$ 6 per cent is comparable to that found in optically selected samples. We also identify absorption systems via the Absorption Index (AI) which includes mini-BALs and NALs, finding 954 quasars with AI $>0$. We consider the CIV emission space (equivalent width vs. blueshift) to study the BAL outflows within the context of the radiatively driven accretion disc-wind model. X-ray selection excludes the highest outflow velocities in emission but includes the full range of absorption velocities which we suggest is consistent with the BAL gas being located further from the X-ray corona than the emitting gas. We observe both X-ray weak and X-ray strong BALs (via the optical-to-X-ray spectral slope, $\alpha_\text{ox}$) and detect little evidence for differing column densities between the BAL and non-BAL quasars, suggesting the BALs and non-BALs have the same shielding gas and intrinsic X-ray emission.

 - **Abstract**
 Color ratios derived from molecular hydrogen emissions provide valuable diagnostics for the energy of precipitating electrons and the structure of the auroral atmosphere. We aim to characterize the horizontal and vertical variability of hydrocarbon absorption in Jupiter's auroral atmosphere using ultraviolet data from the Juno-UVS spectrograph and to investigate potential departures from the expected structure. We constructed color ratio maps sensitive to CH$_4$ and C$_2$H$_2$ absorptions for perijoves (PJs) 6 and 10, two of Juno's close approaches to Jupiter, by integrating auroral H$_2$ emission over hydrocarbon-sensitive spectral intervals. For CH$_4$, we redefined the absorbed spectral band, replacing the traditionally used 125-130 nm interval with 135-140 nm, in order to mitigate higher-order calibration issues. In regions of intense auroral brightness, we developed a correction method to account for spectral distortion due to detector non-linearities at high fluxes. CH$_4$ and C$_2$H$_2$ absorptions generally follow the expected vertical distribution, with the CH$_4$ density extending to higher altitudes than C$_2$H$_2$. However, several localized regions show unexpected spatial distribution of the absorption. In PJ6, such anomalies are attributed to instrumental non-linearities. After correction, the CR distributions become consistent with standard hydrocarbon vertical distributions. In PJ10, however, some anomalous patterns persist despite correction. Spectral modeling indicates that these can be explained by modifying the relative abundances of CH$_4$ and C$_2$H$_2$, suggesting horizontal compositional variability and possible deviations in homopause altitude between species. These findings underscore the importance of accounting for local atmospheric composition when interpreting ultraviolet auroral spectra and retrieving electron energy distributions.
#### The Hidden Role of Anisotropies in Shaping Structure Formation in Cosmological N-Body Simulations

 - **Abstract**
 Initial conditions in cosmological $N$-body simulations are typically generated by displacing particles from a regular cubic lattice using a correlated field derived from the linear power spectrum, often via the Zel'dovich approximation. While this procedure reproduces the target two-point statistics (e.g., the power spectrum or correlation function), it introduces subtle anisotropies due to the underlying lattice structure. These anisotropies, invisible to angle-averaged diagnostics, become evident through directional measures such as the Angular Distribution of Pairwise Distances. Analyzing two Cold Dark Matter simulations with varying resolutions, initial redshifts, and box sizes, we show that these anisotropies are not erased but are amplified by gravitational evolution. They seed filamentary structures that persist into the linear regime, remaining visible even at redshift $z = 0$. Our findings demonstrate that such features are numerical artifacts -- emerging from the anisotropic coupling between the displacement field and the lattice -- not genuine predictions of an isotropic cosmological model. These results underscore the importance of critically reassessing how initial conditions are constructed, particularly when probing the large-scale, quasi-linear regime of structure formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Coronal mass ejections (CMEs), as crucial drivers of space weather, necessitate a comprehensive understanding of their initiation and evolution in the solar corona, in order to better predict their propagation. Solar Cycle 24 exhibited lower sunspot numbers compared to Solar Cycle 23, along with a decrease in the heliospheric magnetic pressure. Consequently, a higher frequency of weak CMEs was observed during Solar Cycle 24. Forecasting CMEs is vital, and various methods, primarily involving the study of the global magnetic parameters using datasets like Space-weather Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager Active Region Patches (SHARP), have been employed in earlier works. In this study, we perform numerical simulations of CMEs within a magnetohydrodynamics framework using Message Passing Interface - Adaptive Mesh Refinement Versatile Advection Code (MPI-AMRVAC) in 2.5 dimensions. By employing the breakout model for CME initiation, we introduce a multipolar magnetic field configuration within a background bipolar magnetic field, inducing shear to trigger the CME eruption. Our investigation focuses on understanding the impact of the background global magnetic field on CME eruptions. Furthermore, we analyze the evolution of various global magnetic parameters in distinct scenarios (failed eruption, single eruption, multiple eruptions) resulting from varying amounts of helicity injection in the form of shear at the base of the magnetic arcade system. Our findings reveal that an increase in the strength of the background poloidal magnetic field constrains CME eruptions. Furthermore, we establish that the growth rate of absolute net current helicity is the crucial factor that determines the likelihood of CME eruptions.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutrino astronomy is a vibrant field of study in astrophysics, offering unique insights into the Universe's most energetic phenomena. The combination of a low cross section and zero electromagnetic charge ensure that a neutrino retains most information about its original source while traversing the universe. On the other hand, these low cross sections, combined with a reduced flux at higher energies, make the neutrino one of the most elusive particles to detect in the standard model. The Radio Neutrino Observatory in Greenland (RNO-G) aims to detect sporadic neutrino interactions in the Greenlandic ice sheet by means of electromagnetic signals in the radio frequency range, induced by the produced charged secondary particles. The low incoming neutrino flux forces the detector to set a low trigger threshold, leading to the measured data being overwhelmed by thermal noise fluctuations. Hence, a sophisticated and robust filter is needed to differentiate between neutrino-like signals and noise. In this contribution we present the current work on the development of such a filter, based on a convolutional neural network architecture. The network employed uses real RNO-G data and simulated neutrino signals to categorize measured data as noise or neutrino-like events.
#### Learning to Estimate Photospheric Vector Fields from Line-of-Sight Magnetograms

 - **Abstract**
 Solar photospheric line-of-sight magnetograms are easier to estimate than full vector magnetograms since the line-of-sight component (Blos) can be obtained from total intensity and circular polarization signals, unlike the perpendicular component (Bperp), which depends on harder-to-measure linear polarization. Unfortunately, the line of sight component by itself is not physically meaningful, as it is just one component of the underlying vector and one whose relationship to gravity changes pixel-to-pixel. To produce an estimate of the radial component (Br) a common ``correction'' is often applied that assumes the field is radial, which is nearly always false. This paper investigates recovering full vector field information from Blos by building on the recent SuperSynthIA approach that was originally used with Stokes vectors as input for simultaneous inversion and disambiguation. As input, the method accepts one or more line-of-sight magnetograms and associated metadata; as output, our method estimates full vector field in heliographic components, meaning that the physically-relevant vector components are returned without need for further disambiguation steps or component transforms. We demonstrate the ability to produce good estimates of the full vector field on unseen examples from both HMI and GONG, including examples that predate the Solar Dynamics Observatory mission. Our results show that learning is not a replacement for a dedicated vector-field observing facilities, but may serve to unlock information from past data and at the very least, provide more accurate Br maps from Blos than are created using the simple viewing angle assumption.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. EUV late phase (ELP) flares exhibit a second peak in warm coronal emissions minutes to hours after the main peak of the flare. This phase is all but negligible, yet it is still poorly understood what role it plays across the solar cycle and what governs it. Aims. We present a statistical analysis of ELP flares over four years between May 2010 and May 2014 based on properties like eruptivity, magnetic configuration, and late-phase duration, delay and strength in order to understand what influences the likelihood of this class of flares and their behavior on a general scale. Methods. We primarily make use of data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory's (SDO) Extreme-ultraviolet Variability Experiment (EVE), as well as complimentary spatial information provided by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA), to assess relationships between the various parameters and see if ELP flares differ from the general flare population. We quantify the criteria for ELP flare definition and determine its characteristics. Results. Our analysis shows that about 10% of all flares with a GOES class greater than or equal to C3.0 experience an EUV late phase (179 out of 1803). This percentage decreases from solar minimum to solar maximum. C-class flares are considerably less likely to be identified as ELP flares than their higher-energetic counterparts, which is in line with previous investigations. The majority of this type of flares is confined (67%), more so than in the general flare population (greater than or equal to C5.0). There appears to be a (linear) relationship between the late-phase delay and its duration. The ratio of the emission peak of the late and main flare phase lies between 0.3 and 5.9, and exceeds 1 in 71.5% of cases, which is considerably higher than previously reported.

 - **Abstract**
 The physical origin of fast radio bursts (FRBs) remains uncertain. Although multiwavelength observations offer critical diagnostics and have been widely conducted, only Galactic FRB~20200428D is associated with an X-ray burst from the magnetar SGR J1935+2154. Here, we present multiwavelength follow-up observations of the nearby bright FRB~20250316A, including the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), Einstein Probe (EP) X-ray mission, Chandra X-ray Observatory, Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST) and Space Variable Object Monitor/Visible Telescope (SVOM/VT). A 13.08-hour FAST follow-up observational campaign suggests that this burst is likely a one-off event. A prompt EP follow-up and multi-epoch observational campaign totaling $>$ 100 ks led to the detection of an X-ray source within the angular resolution of its Follow-up X-ray Telescope (FXT, $10^{\prime\prime}$). A subsequent Chandra observation revealed this source to be offset by $7^{\prime\prime}$ from the FRB position, and established a 0.5-10 keV flux upper limit of $7.6\times 10^{-15}$ $\rm erg\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}$ at the FRB position, corresponding to $\sim 10^{39}$ $\rm erg\,s^{-1}$ at the 40 Mpc distance of the host galaxy NGC~4141. These results set one of the most stringent limits on X-ray emission from a non-repeating FRB, disfavoring ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs) as counterparts of apparently one-off FRBs and offering critical insights into afterglow models. Our study suggests that an arcsecond localization of both the FRB and its potential X-ray counterpart is essential for exploring the X-ray counterpart of an FRB.
