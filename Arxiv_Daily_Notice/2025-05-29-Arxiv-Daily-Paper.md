#### GalSBI-SPS: a stellar population synthesis-based galaxy population model for cosmology and galaxy evolution applications

 - **Abstract**
 Next generation photometric and spectroscopic surveys will enable unprecedented tests of the concordance cosmological model and of galaxy formation and evolution. Fully exploiting their potential requires a precise understanding of the selection effects on galaxies and biases on measurements of their properties, required, above all, for accurate estimates of redshift distributions n(z). Forward-modelling offers a powerful framework to simultaneously recover galaxy n(z)s and characterise the observed galaxy population. We present GalSBI-SPS, a new SPS-based galaxy population model that generates realistic galaxy catalogues, which we use to forward-model HSC data in the COSMOS field. GalSBI-SPS samples galaxy physical properties, computes magnitudes with ProSpect, and simulates HSC images in the COSMOS field with UFig. We measure photometric properties consistently in real data and simulations. We compare redshift distributions, photometric and physical properties to observations and to GalSBI. GalSBI-SPS reproduces the observed grizy magnitude, colour, and size distributions down to i<23. Median differences in magnitudes and colours remain below 0.14 mag, with the model covering the full colour space spanned by HSC. Galaxy sizes are offset by 0.2 arcsec on average and some tension exists in the g-r colour, but the latter is comparable to that seen in GalSBI. Redshift distributions show a mild positive offset (0.01-0.08) in the mean. GalSBI-SPS qualitatively reproduces the stellar mass-SFR and size-stellar mass relations seen in COSMOS2020. GalSBI-SPS provides a realistic, survey-independent galaxy population description at a Stage-III depth using only parameters from the literature. Its predictive power will improve significantly when constrained against observed data using SBI, providing accurate redshift distributions satisfying the stringent requirements set by Stage IV surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 In the course of studying the 3C 220.3 lensing system, spectra were obtained with the Binospec instrument on the MMT for 511 additional objects in 3C 220.3's vicinity. These gave 146 good-quality galaxy redshifts and identified 126 Galactic stars. The galaxy redshift histogram shows a peak near 3C 220.3's redshift, but there is no evidence for or against a galaxy group within 2 Mpc of 3C 220.3 itself. The spectra revealed 12 AGN candidates including a likely $z\approx4.64$ broad-line QSO. Visible and near-infrared imaging with HST allowed morphological classifications of 14 galaxies. One system is a potential analog of the Milky Way-LMC system with stellar mass ratio $\sim$0.6.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a parameter survey of fragmentation in collapsar disks, using a revised version of the Chen & Beloborodov (2007) model that determines the structure of steady state hyperaccretion disks in a general relativistic and neutrino cooled framework. We map out the range of disk conditions leading to gravitational instability alongside an exploration of the dimensionless cooling time $\beta$, which together determine whether fragmentation is likely to occur. We estimate the initial mass and density of fragments, finding that they occupy a unique region in the space of self-gravitating compact objects, with masses $M_{\rm f} \sim 10^{-3} M_\odot -10^{-1} M_\odot$ and densities $\rho_{\rm f}\sim 10^8-10^{11}~{\rm g~cm}^{-3}$. We then calculate their migration and mass growth (via Bondi-Hoyle accretion) as they inspiral through the collapsar disk. During a fragment's migration to the central black hole, it can grow its mass up to a range $M_{\rm f}\sim 10^{-1} M_\odot - 1 M_\odot$. In most cases, the final fragment mass is larger than the minimum cold stable neutron star mass but much smaller than any observed neutron star. The fragment briefly achieves peak accretion rates comparable to (or even larger than) that of the central engine. We propose that these bound fragments may give rise to observable astrophysical phenomena, and we approximately model two of these: (i) gamma ray burst variability produced by a secondary, fragment-launched jet; (ii) the generation of non-vacuum gravitational waveforms accompanied by electromagnetic counterparts.

 - **Abstract**
 To better understand how galaxies assemble their structure and evolve over cosmic time, we present a new catalog of morphological measurements for over 340,000 sources spanning $0 < z < 12$, derived from deep JWST NIRCam imaging across four major extragalactic fields (CEERS, PRIMER-UDS, PRIMER-COSMOS, GOODS) compiled in the DAWN JWST Archive (DJA). We perform two-dimensional surface brightness fitting for all galaxies in a uniform, flux-limited sample. Each galaxy is modeled with both a Sérsic profile and a two-component (bulge and disk) decomposition, yielding consistent structural parameters - including effective radius, Sérsic index, axis ratio, and bulge-to-total ratio ($B/T$). To demonstrate the scientific application of our morphology catalogs, we combined these measurements with DJA photometric redshifts, physical parameters and rest-frame colors, and investigated the relation between total, bulge and disk sizes, Sérsic index ($n_S$), star formation activity, and redshift. Bulge-dominated galaxies (high $n_S$ and $B/T$) predominantly occupy the quiescent region of the $UVJ$ diagram, while disk-dominated galaxies are mostly star-forming. A significant bimodality persists, with quiescent disks and compact, bulge-dominated star-forming galaxies observed out to $z > 3$. Quiescent galaxies also show significantly higher stellar mass surface densities, nearly an order of magnitude greater at $z \sim 4$ than at $z \sim 1$. Our results confirm a strong and evolving link between morphology and star formation activity, and support a scenario in which bulge growth and quenching are closely connected. This work is a highly valuable addition to the DJA, adding a morphological dimension to this rich dataset and thus enabling a wider scientific application.

 - **Abstract**
 Absorption outflows in quasars play an important role in understanding active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback and their influence on galaxy evolution. The unprecedented spectral data provided by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) opens new avenues to explore these outflows. We analyze five low-ionization absorption outflow systems in four intermediate-redshift quasars (2 < z < 3) using the data obtained by DESI in order to characterize their physical properties and energetics, and also to assess their role in AGN feedback. We use the spectra from DESI's Early Data Release to determine the ionic column densities, total hydrogen column densities, electron number densities, and ionization parameters via photoionization modeling and absorption line analysis. We derive the outflows' distance from the AGN, and its kinematic properties: mass-flow rates, kinetic luminosity, and momentum flux. Our study identifies five distinct mini-broad absorption line outflow systems, hosted by four quasars. The identified outflows exhibit hydrogen column densities of \log (N_H) = 20.0-20.7[cm^{-2}], ionization parameters of log (U_H) = -2.7 to -2.1, and electron number densities of log (n_e) =1.45-2.85[cm^{-2}]. The distances of the outflows from the central source are between 4.5 to 31 kpc, and the kinetic luminosities range from 2\times10^{-6} to 5\times10^{-3} of the Eddington luminosity. The outflows in J1407 and J1032 show the largest kinetic luminosities, with momentum flux ratios (\dot{p} / \dot{p}_{rad}) of about 2 and 0.2, respectively. Our findings highlight the vital role of DESI data in uncovering the diversity and significance of quasar outflows in galaxy evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) serve as powerful probes of distant galaxies. Their luminous afterglow pinpoints galaxies independent of luminosity, in contrast to most flux-limited surveys. Nevertheless, GRB-selected galaxy samples are not free from bias, instead tracing the conditions favoured by the progenitor stars. Characterising the galaxy populations traced by GRBs is therefore important both to effectively use GRBs as probes as well as to place stronger constraints on the progenitor stars capable of forming long GRBs. Spatially-resolved spectroscopic observations with integral field units (IFUs) provide valuable insights into the interstellar medium and stellar populations of GRB host galaxies. In this paper we present results of the first two GRB host galaxies observed with the JWST/NIRSpec IFU with a spatial resolution of ~ 1.6 kpc; the hosts of GRB 150403A and GRB 050820A at redshifts z ~ 2.06 and z ~ 2.61, respectively. The data reveal two complex galaxy environments made up of two or more star forming galaxies that are likely interacting given their small spatial separation (< 20 kpc) and line of sight velocity offsets (< 100 km/s). The measured gas-phase metallicity, star formation rates (SFRs), and key diagnostic line ratios for each of the detected galaxies are overall consistent with the properties of other star forming galaxies and GRB hosts at z > 2. However, differences in the SFR and metallicities of the interacting galaxies highlight the importance of spatially resolved observations in order to accurately characterise the galaxy properties traced by GRBs.

 - **Abstract**
 Satellite galaxies endure powerful environmental tidal forces that drive mass stripping of their outer regions. Consequently, satellites located in central regions of galaxy clusters or groups, where the tidal field is strongest, are expected to retain their central dense regions while losing their outskirts. This process produces a spatial segregation in the mean mass density with the cluster-centric distance (the $\bar{\rho}-r$ relation). To test this hypothesis, we combined semi-analytical satellite orbital models with cosmological galaxy simulations. We find that not only the mean total mass densities ($\bar{\rho}$), but also the mean stellar mass densities ($\bar{\rho}^{\star}$) of satellites exhibit this distance-dependent segregation ($\bar{\rho}^{\star}-r$). The correlation traces the host's tidal field out to a characteristic transition radius at $\Re_{\star}$ $\approx$ $0.5$ $R_{\rm vir}$, beyond which the satellite population's density profile can have a slight increase or remain flat, reflecting the weakened tidal influence in the outskirts of galaxy clusters and beyond. We compare these predictions with observational data from satellites in the Virgo and Fornax galaxy clusters, as well as the Andromeda and Milky Way systems. Consistent trends in the satellite mean stellar mass densities are observed across these environments. Furthermore, the transition radius serves as a photometric diagnostic tool: it identifies regions where the stellar components of satellites underwent significant tidal processing and probes the gravitational field strength of the host halo.

 - **Abstract**
 Aims. This study investigates the magnetic evolution of solar active regions (ARs), with a particular focus on understanding how the magnetic morphology of simple and complex ARs changes throughout their lifetime. Methods. To analyse the magnetic evolution of ARs, we developed a Magnetic Evolution Method (MEM) that segments each region's lifetime into three phases: growth, main, and recovery. The method was applied to ARs observed between January 1996 and December 2020. Results. We found that complex active regions (CARs) have a mean lifetime of approximately 24 days, which is 8 days longer than that of simple active regions (SARs). Most CARs (94%) first appear with a simple magnetic structure and remain in this configuration for about 3 days (growth phase), before transitioning into complex structures for around 5 days (main phase), after which they typically revert to a simple state (recovery phase). The average lifetimes of SARs and CARs show no significant difference between solar cycles 23 and 24, suggesting that active region lifetimes are independent of the solar cycle. Conclusions. By tracking the full magnetic evolution of ARs, our study reveals that CARs typically become magnetically complex around three days after emergence and remain in that state for a limited but critical period. This temporal structure, uncovered using a novel method that follows ARs throughout their full development, provides important context for identifying the magnetic conditions associated with increased eruptive potential. The results offer a foundation for improving the forecasting of solar flares and magnetic clouds, and suggest that the magnetic evolution of ARs is largely independent of the solar cycle.

 - **Abstract**
 The Sunspot Solar Observatory Data Archive (SSODA) stores data acquired with the suite of instruments at the Richard B. Dunn Solar Telescope (DST) from February 2018 to the present. The instrumentation at the DST continues to provide high cadence imaging, spectroscopy, and polarimetry of the solar photosphere and chromosphere across a wavelength range from 3500Å to 11,000Å. At time of writing, the archive contains approximately 374 TiB of data across more than 520 observing days (starting on February 1, 2018). These numbers are approximate as the DST remains operational, and is actively adding new data to the archive. The SSODA includes both raw and calibrated data. A subset of the archive contains the results of photospheric and chromospheric spectropolarimetric inversions using the Hazel-2.0 code to obtain maps of magnetic fields, temperatures, and velocity flows. The SSODA represents a unique resource for the investigation of plasma processes throughout the solar atmosphere, the origin of space weather events, and the properties of active regions throughout the rise of Solar Cycle 25.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays, UHECR, are charged particles with energies between $\sim10^{18}\,{\rm eV}$ and $\sim3\times10^{20}\,{\rm eV}\sim50\,{\rm J}$. They exhibit fundamental physics at energies inaccessible to terrestrial accelerators, challenge experimental physics and connect strongly to astronomical observations through electromagnetic, neutrino and even gravitational wave channels. There has been much theoretical and observational progress in the sixty years that have elapsed since the discovery of UHECR, to divine their nature and identify their sources. The highest energy UHECR appear to be heavy nuclei with rigidity extending up to $\sim10\,{\rm EV}$; A significant ($6.9\sigma$) dipole anisotropy has been measured but our poor understanding of the Galactic magnetic fields makes this hard to interpret; The UHECR luminosity density is $\sim 10^{44}$ erg Mpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ which constrains explanations of their origin; The most promising acceleration mechanisms involve diffusive shock acceleration and unipolar induction; The most promising sources include intergalactic accretion shocks, and relativistic jets from stellar-mass or supermassive black holes. We explore the prospects for using the highest energy events, combined with multimessenger astronomy, to help us solve the riddle of UHECR.

 - **Abstract**
 This study investigates the projected, quasi-symmetric $\sim\rm46\,kpc$-scale diffuse radio lobes surrounding the giant elliptical galaxy M\,87, utilizing well-sampled wideband ($\rm 60\,MHz-10.55\,GHz$) observations from MWA and VLA, supplemented by data from LOFAR and Effelsberg. The observed structures feature sharp edges and filaments, with nearly uniform and moderately steep spectral indices ($\alpha$, mostly within $-1.2\leq\alpha\leq-0.8$), indicating turbulence. Well-sampled radio spectra for the lobes' diffuse region are derived using the continuous injection (CI) model (with $\alpha_{\rm inj}\simeq-0.86$ and $\nu_{\rm b}\simeq1.72\rm\,GHz$), and for its three localized regions using the impulsive injection model (e.g., JP model). From energy equipartition analysis, we estimate the typical magnetic field strength in the lobes' diffuse region to be $B_{\rm eq}\simeq10\,\mu\rm G$. The age of the lobes is estimated as $\sim30-50\,\rm~Myr$, based on lifetimes derived from the CI and JP models and sound crossing time. Outflow powers of $\sim(0.2-2)\times10^{44}\,\rm erg\,s^{-1}$ for the lobes' diffuse components and $\sim(1-11)\times10^{44}\,\rm erg\,s^{-1}$ for the whole source are calculated. With this power assessment, we conclude that the galactic stellar wind has a negligible effect, the active galactic nucleus (AGN)-driven jet can provide the necessary energy for the whole system. Furthermore, we argue that while the wind driven by current AGN activity is unlikely to power the lobes' diffuse components, an average enhancement of AGN activity by a factor of $\sim 10^2$ over the past $\sim 30-50$ Myr remains plausible.
#### Deep Extragalactic VIsible Legacy Survey (DEVILS): The sSFR-M$_{\star}$ plane part II: Starbursts, SFHs and AGN Feedback

 - **Abstract**
 In part I of this series we discussed the variation of star-formation histories (SFHs) across the specific star formation rate - stellar mass plane (sSFR-M$_{\star}$) using the Deep Extragalactic VIsible Legacy Survey (DEVILS). Here we explore the physical mechanisms that are likely driving these observational trends, by comparing the properties of galaxies with common recent SFH shapes. Overall, we find that the processes shaping the movement of galaxies through the sSFR-M$_{\star}$ plane can be be largely split into two stellar mass regimes, bounded by the minimum SFR dispersion ($\sigma_{SFR}$) point. At lower stellar masses we find that large $\sigma_{SFR}$ values are likely observed due to a combination of stochastic star-formation processes and a large variety in absolute sSFR values, but relatively constant/flat SFHs. While at higher stellar masses we see strong observational evidence that Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are associated with rapidly declining SFHs, and that these galaxies reside in the high $\sigma_{SFR}$ region of the plane. As such, we suggest that AGN feedback, leading to galaxy quenching, is the primary driver of the high $\sigma_{SFR}$ values. These results are consistent with previous theoretical interpretations of the $\sigma_{SFR}$-M$_{\star}$ relation.
#### Understanding gas mixing in the circumgalactic medium

 - **Abstract**
 We study gas mixing in a simulated Milky Way-mass galaxy's circumgalactic medium (CGM) using cosmological zoom-in simulations. We insert tracer dyes in the CGM with different gas flows (shearing, coherent, and static) and diverse physical properties to track gas mixing and find that shearing flows generally exhibit a higher dye spread. We then correlate the extent and shape of dye spread with local gas properties for a generalised understanding of gas mixing. The velocity dispersion and magnitude of traceless symmetric shear (shear deformation) tensors in small regions (<5 kpc) around the dye injection locations most accurately predict the extent of dye spread after 200 Myr (Spearman rank 0.87). We use this to determine diffusivity calibration constants for subgrid-scale mixing models. While the dye shape after 200 Myr aligns well with velocity and magnetic field dispersion, the best alignment occurs with the dispersion of eigenvectors representing stretching (from traceless symmetric shear tensor) and plane-of-rotation (from antisymmetric shear or vorticity tensor) in large regions (>10 kpc) around the dye injection locations. Therefore, shear-related statistics and velocity dispersion are the properties best able to predict both the extent and shape of mixed gas in our simulations. Our dyes spread roughly linearly with time, suggesting superdiffusive behaviour in the CGM, potentially due to turbulent and large-scale coherent flows. We calculate physical Reynolds numbers of 10^2-10^3 using gas properties in the CGM of our simulations, which a resolution of a few hundred pc could resolve, but our 1 kpc resolution leads to significant numerical mixing. However, our correlation results are robust to changes in resolution. These results can be used to predict diffusion coefficients from local gas properties to model processes like magnetic field diffusion, heat transport, and metal mixing.

 - **Abstract**
 During the fall of late-type galaxies into clusters, they can experiment a variety of evolutionary mechanisms according their local environment. Consequently, studying the UV emission and the cold gas of late-type galaxies provide key insights in the evolution of short-lived starburst and galaxy quenching. In this work, we conduted a study of two 28' fields observed with UVIT-AstroSat in the central region of the Abell cluster A496 ($z=0.033$), including HI, data from NRAO VLA. We reported 22 cluster members detected in FUV; all of them are detected in HI, or have upper limits for the HI-mass. We find our FUV detected galaxies generally have higher specific star formation rates than other star forming galaxies. Most of the FUV galaxies with masses above 10$^9 \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$,and showing high sSFR have no close neighbors, pointing at RPS as the dominant mechanism affecting them. In contrast, most of the low-mass FUV objects present at least one companion, suggesting that tidal interactions also play an important role in the triggering of infalling galaxies. Combining the FUV-SFR with the HI properties of the observed galaxies in A496 we identify an evolutionary sequence consisting of five stages: (1) Pre-triggering, (2) Initial SF-triggering, (3) Peak of star-formation, (4) SF-fading, and (5) SF-quenching. During this path, normal gas-rich objects reach a gas-deficiency phase with SFR well below the main sequence. This process, prior to becoming a full passive galaxy, can be accomplished within a few 10$^{8}$ yr.

 - **Abstract**
 Mass drainage is frequently observed in solar filaments. During filament eruptions, falling material most likely flows along magnetic field lines, which may provide important clues for the magnetic structures of filaments. Here we study three filament eruptions exhibiting significant mass draining, often manifested as falling threads at a constant speed ranging between 30--300 km/s. We found that most of the falling material lands onto the hooked segments of flare ribbons, only a small fraction lands inside the hooks, and almost none lands onto the straight segments of ribbons. Based on these observations we surmise that before eruptions most of the filament mass is entrained by field lines threading the quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs), which wrap around the filament field and whose footpoints are mapped by the hooked ribbons, and that the magnetic reconnection involving these field lines is the major cause of the mass drainage during eruptions. Additionally, the light curves of the hooked ribbons suggest that during eruptions the earlier (later) QSL boundary of filaments is threaded by mass-loaded (depleted) field lines. By assuming that the constant-speed motion is due to a drag force balancing the gravity, we proposed a simplified analytical model to estimate the density contrast of the falling material. The estimated density contrast is then fed into a numerical model, in which filament threads fall along vertical magnetic field lines through a gravitationally stratified atmosphere. The resultant falling speeds, however, are short of observed values, which calls for further investigations.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutron stars (NSs) are thought to receive natal kicks at their formation in supernovae. In order to investigate the magnitude of these kicks, we analyze the proper motions and distance estimates -- either through parallax or dispersion measures -- of young isolated pulsars and infer their three-dimensional velocities relative to their local standard of rest. We find that the velocities based on parallax distances of pulsars younger than $10$ Myr follow a log-normal distribution with a mean of $\ln\left(v/\text{km}/\text{s}^{-1}\right)=5.60\pm0.12$ and a standard deviation of $0.68\pm0.10$, peaking at ${\sim}150$--$200$ km s$^{-1}$, which we adopt as our fiducial kick distribution. Using a previously established method that infers kick magnitudes through the eccentricity of Galactic trajectories, we also estimate the kick velocities of older pulsars, which we find to be consistent with our fiducial kick distribution. A log-normal fit to all pulsars with ages below $40$ Myr yields a more constraining (but possibly more prone to systematic errors) fit with mean and standard deviation of $5.67\pm0.10$ and $0.59\pm0.08$, respectively. Moreover, we (1) resolve the tension between our results and the Maxwellian distribution found by Hobbs et al. (2005), which has a ${\sim}50\%$ higher median velocity, by showing that their analysis is missing a Jacobian needed to correct for its logarithmic histogram bin sizes, and (2) argue that the bimodality found by others is not statistically significant and that previous results are consistent with our inferred kick distribution, effectively reconciling the literature on observed NS kicks.

 We report on optically selected stellar candidates of SARAO MeerKAT 1.3 GHz radio continuum survey sources of the Galactic plane. Stellar counterparts to radio sources are selected by cross-matching the MeerKAT source positions with \textit{Gaia} DR3, using two approaches. The first approach evaluated the probability of chance alignments between the radio survey and \textit{Gaia} sources and used AllWISE infrared colour-colour information to select potential stellar candidates. The second approach utilized a Monte Carlo method to evaluate the cross-matching reliability probability, based on populations of known radio-emitting stars. From the combined approaches, we found 629 potential stellar counterparts, of which 169 have existing SIMBAD classifications, making it the largest Galactic plane radio-optical crossmatch sample to date. A colour-magnitude analysis of the sample revealed a diverse population of stellar objects, ranging from massive OB stars, main-sequence stars, giants, young stellar objects, emission line stars, red dwarfs and white dwarfs. Some of the proposed optical counterparts include chromospherically/coronally active stars, for example RS CVn binaries, BY Dra systems, YSOs and flare stars, which typically exhibit radio emission. Based on Gaia's low-resolution spectroscopy, some of the stars show strong H$\alpha$ emission, indicating they are magnetically active, consistent with them being radio emitters. While MeerKAT's sensitivity and survey speed make it ideal for detecting faint radio sources, its angular resolution limits accurate counterpart identification for crowded fields such as the Galactic Plane. Higher frequency, and, thereby, better spatial resolution, radio observations plus circular polarization would be required to strengthen the associations.

 - **Abstract**
 We present two new radio continuum images obtained with Apertif at 1.4 GHz. The images, produced with a direction-dependent calibration pipeline, cover 136 square degrees of the Lockman Hole and 24 square degrees of the ELAIS-N fields, with an average resolution of 17x12" and residual noise of 33 uJy/beam. With the improved depth of the images we found in total 63692 radio sources, many of which are detected for the first time at this frequency. With the addition of the previously published Apertif catalog for the Bootes field, we cross-match with the LOFAR deep-fields value-added catalogs at 150 MHz, resulting in a homogeneous sample of 10196 common sources with spectral index estimates, one of the largest to date. We analyze and discuss the correlations between spectral index, redshift, linear sources size, and radio luminosity, taking into account biases of flux-density-limited surveys. Our results suggest that the observed correlation between spectral index and redshift of active galactic nuclei can be attributed to the Malmquist bias reflecting an intrinsic relation between radio luminosity and the spectral index. We also find a correlation between spectral index and linear source size with more compact sources having steeper spectra.

 - **Abstract**
 The circumstellar envelopes (CSEs) of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars harbour a rich variety of molecules and are sites of complex chemistry. Our current understanding of the circumstellar chemical processes of carbon-rich AGB stars is predominantly based on observations of a single star, IRC+10216, often regarded as an archetypical carbon star. We aim to estimate stellar and circumstellar properties for five carbon stars, and constrain their circumstellar CS abundances. This study compares the CS abundances among the sources, informs circumstellar chemical models, and helps to assess if IRC+10216 is a good representative of the physics and chemistry of carbon star CSEs. We modelled the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and CO line emission to derive the stellar and outflow properties. Using these, we then retrieved CS abundance profiles with detailed radiative transfer modelling, imposing spatial and excitation constraints from ALMA and single-dish observations. We obtain good fits to the SEDs and CO lines for all sources and reproduce the CS line emission across various transitions and apertures, yielding robust estimates of the CS abundance profiles. Peak CS fractional abundances range from 1$\times$10$^{-6}$ - 4$\times$10$^{-6}$, with e-folding radii of 1.8$\times$10$^{16}$ - 6.8$\times$10$^{16}$ cm. We also derive reliable $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C and $^{32}$S/$^{34}$S ratios from CS isotopologue modelling. Our results refine previous single-dish CS abundance estimates and improve the relative uncertainty on the CS e-folding radius for IRAS 07454$-$7112 by a factor of $\sim$2.5. Chemical models reproduce our estimates of the CS radial extent, corroborating the CS photodissociation framework used therein. We find no significant differences between the derived CS abundance profiles for IRC+10216 and the rest of the sample, apart from the expected density-driven variations.

 - **Abstract**
 Precise cosmological constraints from type Ia supernovae require adequately accurate corrections for host-galaxy extinction. Modelling these corrections is challenged by the problem of disentangling supernova intrinsic colours from host-galaxy interstellar this http URL latter is commonly modelled in a probabilistic way assuming an exponential distribution exp(-E(B-V)/\tau) as a universal prior which is applied across all types of supernova host galaxies. We test the robustness of the exponential model and its universality against predictions based on simulating dust and type Ia supernova distributions in host galaxies of different morphological types. We find substantial differences between predicted interstellar reddening in late- and early-type host galaxies, primarily driven by the stellar-to-dust mass ratios. The mean simulated reddening in late-type galaxies matches well those derived from type Ia supernova observations, but it is significantly lower for early-type host galaxies. The reddening distributions exhibit an excess of sight lines with vanishing reddening with respect to the exponential model, although the difference is quite mild for late-type galaxies. On the other hand, the distribution may peak at E(B-V)>0 when considering a population of young type Ia supernovae originating from lower heights within the dust disc. We demonstrate that assuming a universal reddening prior distribution for modeling peak magnitude-colour relation, which is currently a common practice, gives rise to a spurious scatter in the derived extinction properties. It may also bias relative distances between supernovae originating from different host-galaxy populations. The discrepancy between the simulated reddening in average early-type host galaxies and the observed occurrence of reddened supernovae suggests that reddening does not originate from interstellar dust expected in these galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 Intermittency has been studied extensively in the fast and slow solar winds but to a far lesser extent in interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs). While ICMEs are often characterized by their relatively smooth, large-scale magnetic flux rope structures, a spectrum of fluctuations is nonetheless present at smaller scales. We have examined kurtosis and its scaling exponents at magnetohydrodynamic inertial scales in 49 ICMEs observed between 0.25 and 1 au by Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter, and compared the results to those obtained for the ICME sheath regions and ambient solar wind intervals. Kurtosis behaves similarly in all intervals studied and presents a universal behavior typical of intermittent time series. The ICMEs displayed a radially invariant level of intermittency, suggesting that they are relatively static, well-developed turbulent environments. In the sheath regions, the level of intermittency increased with distance, indicating that the turbulence is not yet fully developed at small heliocentric distances. In addition to intermittent fluctuations related to turbulence, the sheath regions may possess a population of non-turbulent structures that increase the absolute value of kurtosis.

 - **Abstract**
 Bright SMGs contribute significantly to the star formation rate (SFR) density (20-50\%) and stellar mass density ($\sim$ 30-50\%) at $z=$ 2-4 with SFRs$\ge 1000$ M$_\odot$,yr$^{-1}$ and stellar masses of $\sim 10^{11}$-$10^{12}$ M$_\odot$. The number of bright SMGs with such high SFRs is hard to reconcile with the standard models of galaxy formation and evolution. In this paper we provide evidence that, in a small sample of 12 bright SMGs, the SFRs derived from spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting are significantly higher than those obtained using low-frequency radio emission as a proxy for star formation. Using the International LOFAR Telescope (ILT), which allows imaging at 144 MHz with sub-arcsecond angular resolution, we have produced deep images of a small sample of bright SMGs in the North Ecliptic Pole (NEP) field extracted from the NEPSC2 survey. For all 12 SMGs, we find radio-emitting mid-infrared galaxies at distances from a few arcseconds down to sub-arcsecond scales from the SMG and/or the presence of a radio-emitting AGN. The SFRs derived from the radio emission of the SMG, disentangled from the AGN-related radio emission, are systematically lower by a factor of $\sim 5$ (median value) than those derived from the multi-band SED fitting. We discuss whether our assumptions might be, at least in part, responsible for the observed discrepancy. We argue that the radio-derived SFRs are not systematically underestimated but can be affected by a significant dispersion ($0.3-0.5$ dex). Considering these new SFR estimates, the offset of the specific SFR of the 12 bright SMGs from the star-forming galaxy main sequence ($\Delta\mathrm{(SSFR)}$) is significantly reduced, with all 12 bright SMGs which are only a factor of 2 more star-forming than the main sequence galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 The solar wind (SW) is a vital component of space weather, providing a background for solar transients such as coronal mass ejections, stream interaction regions, and energetic particles propagating toward Earth. Accurate prediction of space weather events requires a precise description and thorough understanding of physical processes occurring in the ambient SW plasma. Ensemble simulations of the three-dimensional SW flow are performed using an empirically-driven magnetohydrodynamic heliosphere model implemented in the Multi-Scale Fluid-Kinetic Simulation Suite (MS-FLUKSS). The effect of uncertainties in the photospheric boundary conditions on the simulation outcome is investigated. The results are in good overall agreement with the observations from the Parker Solar Probe, Solar Orbiter, Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory, and OMNI data at Earth, specifically during 2020-2021. This makes it possible to shed more light on the properties of the SW propagating through the heliosphere and perspectives for improving space weather forecasts.

 - **Abstract**
 The impact of metallicity on the Cepheid Leavitt law (LL) and, in turn, the Hubble constant, has been the subject of much recent debate. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of metallicity effects on Cepheid LLs based on synthetic Cepheid populations computed using Geneva models and the SYCLIST tool. We computed 296 co-eval populations in the age range of 5-300 Myr for metallicities representative of the Sun, the LMC, and the SMC ($Z \in [0.014, 0.006, 0.002]$). We computed LLs in fourteen optical-to-infrared passbands and five reddening-free Wesenheit magnitudes. All Cepheid populations take into account distributions of rotation rates and companion stars. We show excellent agreement between the predicted populations and key observational constraints from the literature. Our simulations predict a significant LL slope-metallicity dependence ($\beta_{\rm M} > 0$) that renders LLs steeper at lower metallicity at all wavelengths. Importantly, $\beta_{\rm M} \ne 0$ implies that the intercept-metallicity dependence, $\alpha_{\rm M}$, depends on pivot period; an issue not previously considered. Comparison with $\alpha_{\rm M}$ measurements in individual passbands reported in the literature yields acceptable agreement on the order of agreement found among different observational studies. The wavelength dependence and magnitude of the disagreement suggests a possible origin in reddening-related systematics. Conversely, we report excellent agreement between our $\alpha_{\rm M} = -0.20 \pm 0.03$ mag dex$^{-1}$ and the value determined by the SH0ES distance ladder in the reddening-free H-band Wesenheit magnitude ($-0.217 \pm 0.046$), the currently tightest and conceptually simplest empirical constraint.
#### Dust Budget Crisis in Little Red Dots

 - **Abstract**
 Little red dots (LRDs), a population of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) recently identified by JWST, are characterized by their compact morphology and red optical continuum emission, which is often interpreted as evidence for significant dust extinction of $A_V \gtrsim 3$ mag. However, the dust-reddened AGN scenario is increasingly challenged by their faint near-to-far infrared emission and a potential "dust budget crisis" in cases when the host galaxy is either undetectably low-mass or absent. In this study, we re-evaluate the dust extinction level in LRDs by modeling the UV-to-infrared spectra for various extinction laws and a broad range of dusty distribution parameters. Comparing the predicted infrared fluxes with observational data from the JWST MIRI, Herschel, and ALMA, our analysis finds that the visual extinction is tightly constrained to $A_V \lesssim 1.0$ mag for A2744-45924 and $A_V \lesssim 1.5$ mag for RUBIES-BLAGN-1 under the SMC extinction laws, with slightly weaker constraints for those with gray extinction in the UV range. The revised $A_V$ values yield a radiative efficiencies of $10\%$ for the LRD population, easing the tension with the Soltan argument for the bulk AGN population at lower redshifts. Moreover, this moderate extinction (or dust-free) scenario, with reprocessed emission spectra testable by future far-infrared observatories, provides a paradigm shift in understanding their natures, environments, and evolutionary pathways of massive black holes in the early universe.
