 - **Abstract**
 As wide-field optical surveys such as Vera Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) begin operations, time-domain astronomy is facing a data revolution, paving the road for new, expanded variability studies. This work leverages the complementary power of optical variability and color selection to identify active galactic nuclei (AGN), focusing on optimizing the identification of obscured AGN, typically more challenging to distinguish from inactive galaxies based on optical variability alone. The analysis is designed to provide valuable insights in the context of performance preview for the LSST, albeit using a scaled-down version of the LSST dataset. We present the first combined AGN selection based on g+r+i band light curves from the VST-COSMOS survey, spanning 3.3 yr. We identify AGN candidates independently in each band using a random forest (RF) classifier trained on features mainly related to optical variability, along with six optical/infrared colors and a morphology indicator. We subsequently merge the three band-specific samples in order to enhance selection purity and reliability. We then focus on defining a subset of features that significantly improve the identification of obscured AGN. The RF classifiers yield a consistent performance across the three bands, highlighting the critical role of contamination. Using the combined three-band plus color selection we successfully recover $58^{+9}_{-8}\%$ of all AGN and $69^{+10}_{-8}\%$ of the known obscured AGN that have been independently confirmed in all three bands. When requiring confirmation in two out of the three bands, these fractions increase to $69^{+10}_{-8}\%$ and $80^{+10}_{-9}\%$, respectively. We also demonstrate that, while combining variability features with colors is crucial to improve obscured AGN selection, relying solely on color features returns a markedly higher contamination rate.

 - **Abstract**
 Active galactic nuclei (AGN) and star formation feedback may heat and remove gas from galaxies in a process that quenches ongoing star formation and shapes the evolution of galaxies. Potential impacts from these processes can be seen in the complex and interconnected signatures of AGN and star formation activity throughout a galaxy. Here, we analyze archival integral field unit (IFU) data for the nearby Seyfert galaxy, NGC 1365, as observed with the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) instrument on the Very Large Telescope (VLT). Our analysis probes the ionization and kinematic properties of NGC 1365 at high spatial resolution over unprecedentedly large physical scales (approximately 40 kpc), allowing us to trace the effects of feedback throughout nearly an entire galaxy. We use these optical IFU data in conjunction with observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and Chandra X-ray Observatory to analyze and compare maps of emission line flux, ionization state, star formation, and gas kinematics. In doing so, we identify a region of BPT-identified unexpectedly high ionization relative to surrounding areas in the star forming arms, and work to identify its source, finding that shock heating may play a significant role. Results from this analysis allow us to place constraints on the relative impact of AGN and star formation processes on the star forming gas in NGC 1365, as well as begin to inform our understanding on the global impacts of feedback in galaxy populations as a whole.
#### Assessment of DKIST/VTF Capabilities for the Detection of Local Acoustic Source Wavefronts

 - **Abstract**
 Recent studies have demonstrated that temporal filtering can successfully identify local-acoustic-source wavefronts in radiative magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the solar photosphere. Extending this capability to observations promises new insight into the stochastic excitation of solar p-modes, the source depth distribution below the photosphere, and the dominant physical processes underlying acoustic wave excitation. Such measurements would also enable improved characterization of the complex wavefield in the lower chromosphere and open the possibility of ultra-local helioseismic diagnostics. In this work, we assess an observational strategy for the detection of local acoustic wavefronts on the Sun using the National Science Foundation's Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope's Visible Tunable Filter (DKIST/VTF). Because wavefront identification requires high spatial and temporal resolution and is limited by the small amplitudes of the wave perturbations, we focus on identifying specific wavelength combinations within spectral lines that maximize the sensitivity to the wave signal at the atmospheric heights where that signal is highest while minimizing contamination by atmospheric variability at other heights. Under the cadence and spectral resolution constraints of DKIST/VTF observations and for the particular simulated wavefront we examine, this approach suggests two possible strategies for the detection of acoustic wavefronts in solar observations: fast monochromatic imaging at 6302.425 A, or ordered interleaved observations in the blue wing of either the Fe I 6302.5 A or Fe I 5250.6 A line (between 6302.419 A and 6302.465 A, or between 5250.579 A and 5250.607 A respectively).

 - **Abstract**
 We build a catalog of massive (M>$8~$M$_\odot$) main sequence stars in the \mbox{metal-poor} ($\sim0.1~$Z$_\odot$) dwarf irregular galaxy Sextans A. HST WFC3 UV photometry in the 275 and 336 nm wideband filters is arranged in a Color-Magnitude Diagram (CMD), and overlaid on top of stellar evolutionary tracks from the MIST library. The star properties (mass, age, etc.) are computed with a Finite Element (FE) interpolation of the stellar tracks. The FE method, originally developed for solid mechanics problems, provides a general framework for interpolating fields inside domains of complex geometry. Besides the interpolated properties, the algorithm computes their gradients with respect to the photometry. These sensitivities provide a direct an efficient estimate of the associated uncertainties. Our catalog contains 655 stars, with the most massive one estimated at $58\pm11~$M$_\odot$. A comparison with a ground-based spectroscopic census of OB stars yields only 8 matches, evidencing the minimal overlap between both datasets. The mass estimates derived from the UV CMD and the spectral classification are in good agreement for the majority of O-type stars found in both datasets. Our catalog provides an extensive list of candidates for followup spectroscopic observation, which could improve our understanding of the early evolutionary stages of massive \mbox{low-metallicity} stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Sunspots are obvious observable manifestations of the toroidal magnetic field generated through the dynamo in the convection zone. They appear in different sizes, having a wide distribution in their area. We analyse the sunspot group area of the past 13 cycles and the Bipolar Magnetic Region (BMR) flux for Cycles 23 and 24 to explore their area and flux distributions and connect with the theory. We find that, in general, the group area and BMR flux are statistically larger in the rising phase than in the declining phase of the solar cycle. This implies that the rising phase of the solar cycle is prone to drive more intense space weather. We further show that the mean and median of the area distribution during the rising phase are dependent on cycle strength. However, the distribution mean and median are cycle strength-independent or weakly dependent during the decline phases of the solar cycles, particularly during the last three years when the latitudinal bands of all cycles migrate towards the equator along the same trajectory. These results support the theoretical model of nonlinear flux loss due to flux emergence, which explains why solar cycles rise differently but decay similarly.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed model atmosphere analysis of hot white dwarfs in the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 1. Our sample includes 19,321 unique targets with $G_{\rm BP}-G_{\rm RP}\leq0$. We use the DESI spectra along with Gaia parallaxes and SDSS, Pan-STARRS, and SkyMapper photometry to perform spectroscopic and photometric fits. We find a significant discrepancy between the photometric and spectroscopic masses for DA white dwarfs (a systematic offset of 0.05-$0.06~M_\odot$), indicating problems with the broad hydrogen line profiles in DESI spectroscopy data. Our photometric fits are consistent with a peak at the canonical mass of $0.6~M_\odot$. A remarkable feature of the mass distribution is the prevalence of magnetic white dwarfs among the ultramassive DA population and that of warm DQs in the non-DA distribution. We identify 70 DQs in the DESI hot white dwarf sample, including 9 DAQs with carbon and hydrogen atmospheres. We constrain the ratio of non-DA to DA white dwarfs as a function of temperature, and discuss the implications for the spectral evolution of white dwarfs in the temperature range $10^5-10^4$ K. We also discuss unusual objects in the sample, including metal-rich white dwarfs and extremely low mass white dwarfs. This analysis provides the first look at the large sample of Gaia-selected white dwarf candidates that will be observed with multiplexed spectroscopic surveys like DESI, SDSS-V, 4MOST, and WEAVE over the next several years.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a systematic study of the evolution of the corona geometry in nine black hole X-ray binaries (BHXRBs) using archival data from NICER. We identify 171 observations exhibiting quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) across various spectral states and model the time-averaged energy spectra of the source, as well as the energy-dependent rms and phase-lag spectra of the QPO, with the time-dependent Comptonization model vKompthdk. This allows us to simultaneously constrain the corona size and feedback fraction during outbursts. By using the power color hue diagnostics, we identify different spectral states, and observe that the QPO frequency increases from $\sim$0.1 Hz to $\sim$10 Hz in the low-hard and hard-intermediate states (LHS and HIMS), and remains approximately constant at 4--5~Hz in the soft-intermediate state (SIMS). The corona size shows significant evolution: the corona is large ($\sim10^4$--$10^5$ km) in the LHS, contracts rapidly to $\sim10^3$ km in the HIMS, and exhibits a flare-like expansion near the HIMS-to-SIMS transition. In the SIMS and high-soft state (HSS), the corona becomes compact and stable (4000--8000~km). The feedback fraction of the corona photons increases during the periods in which the corona contracts and decreases during the periods in which the corona expands, indicating a change of the disk-corona coupling. Our results are consistent with previous QPO-based studies using vKompthdk on some individual sources. This work, however, provides the first view of the coronal evolution across outbursts for a diverse BHXRB sample, offering critical insights into coronal behavior as a function of the spectral state of the source.
#### Clump-Scale Dust Attenuation in Epoch of Reionization Galaxies: Spatially Resolved Properties from FirstLight Simulations

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding dust attenuation in galaxies at both integrated and spatially resolved scales is fundamental for accurately determining the physical properties of galaxies. Recent high-spatial-resolution observations with ALMA and JWST enable investigations of spatially resolved properties in high-redshift galaxies ($z \gtrsim 6$), but spatial variations in dust properties remain poorly constrained. We use cosmological zoom-in simulations combined with post-processing dust radiative transfer calculations for 376 clumpy galaxies at $z=6$-$9$ with stellar masses of $M_* \gtrsim 10^9 \, M_\odot$. For each system, we investigate dust attenuation and re-emission properties for three components: system-integrated, individual clumps, and diffuse regions. We find that system-integrated attenuation curves are grayer than the Calzetti curve, even when assuming MW- or SMC-type dust. Attenuation curves of individual clumps are even grayer, while diffuse regions exhibit steeper curves owing to enhanced scattering in optically thin environments. Since the effects of optical depth and dust-star geometry are intrinsically degenerate in attenuation curves, we introduce a toy model based on the IRX-$\Delta\beta$ plane, where $\Delta\beta$ denotes the difference between attenuated and intrinsic UV slopes. Applying this framework, we find that clumps have dust column densities approximately an order of magnitude higher than system-integrated values and exhibit co-spatial or dust-extended geometries. In contrast, system-integrated attenuation reflects star-extended geometries driven by contributions from optically thin diffuse regions. We apply this framework to REBELS-IFU galaxies at $z \sim 7$ and find good agreement with our simulation predictions.
#### Active Galactic Nuclei and STaR fOrmation in Nearby Galaxies AGNSTRONG. III. A Study on Ionized and Warm Molecular Gas Outflows of 6 Type-2 AGNs

 - **Abstract**
 Active galactic nucleus (AGN)-driven gas outflows are one of the best tracers of AGN feedback in action, as these powerful outflows expel/heat or compress the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM), thus quenching or enhancing star-forming activity in their hosts. Studying the kinematics of outflows in different gas phases is crucial for comprehending how AGNs impact the ISM within their host galaxies. However, the differences in the physical natures of ionized and warm molecular gas outflows remain largely unexplored. To obtain a complete picture of AGN outflows and their feedback effects, we present a study of both ionized and warm molecular gas outflows in six type-2 AGNs ($z<0.1$) that exhibit strong ionized outflows in previous optical observations. Utilizing the Triple Spectrograph and Double Spectrograph instruments on the Palomar 200-inch Hale Telescope, we conduct spatially resolved measurements in the slit direction of strong emission lines from both ionized and warm molecular gas, such as $\rm [O\ III]$, $\rm Pa\alpha$, $\rm H_{2}$ 1-0 S(1), etc., allowing for a direct comparison of their outflow properties. One out of six AGNs shows significant ionized and warm molecular outflows in near-infrared bands, exhibiting the most powerful kinematics and highest luminosity. A positive correlation between the kinematics and AGN luminosity is shown, suggesting that more luminous AGNs, which reflect higher levels of AGN activity, tend to have a greater impact on the gases, probably driving the outflows.
#### Imprints of gravitational waves from magnetar spindown in GRB X-ray afterglows

 - **Abstract**
 Given that newborn magnetars are considered potential central engines of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), there is strong motivation to identify gravitational wave (GW) signatures within GRB samples. If the X-ray afterglow of a GRB is powered by a magnetar, and the initial spindown of the magnetar is dominated by the GW radiation induced by $r$-mode instability or magnetic-field-induced deformation, the decay of the X-ray flux would record the information of the GW radiation. We find that GRB 130603B potentially represents a rare and precious case where the spindown of the central magnetar is dominated in-turn by $r$-mode and magnetic distortion-induced GW radiation. By fitting the X-ray light curve of GRB 130603B in this model, we obtain the initial spin period of magnetar $\sim 5.3\times 10^{-4}$ s, the effective dipole magnetic field strength $\sim 5.2\times 10^{14}$ G, the ellipticity of the magnetar $\sim 1.3\times 10^{-4}$, and the amplitude of $r$-mode oscillation $\sim3.3\times 10^{-2}$. It may serve as a reliable approach for investigating neutron star physics by comparing the parameters estimated using the method presented in this manuscript with those obtained from future GW observations.

 - **Abstract**
 SXP 31.0 is an X-ray source in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) that was first identified as a Be X-ray Binary (BeXRB) system when it went into X-ray outbusrst in 1998. It is now known to consist of an OBe main sequence star and a neutron star with a spin period of 31s. In 2025 a new X-ray outburst phase began with the source exhibiting a luminosities approaching the Eddington limit of 10^38 erg/s. Unusually, H-alpha images show it has a surrounding halo whose nature has not been clear. In this paper, we report new observations of this halo, including the first multi-fibre Integrated Flux Unit (IFU) observations, which identify this emission as probably a coincidental HII region. The X-ray, UV & optical data cover a period of ~200d and reveal that the source underwent two bright, back-to-back, Type II outbursts in 2025 - a rare occurrence for any BeXRB system.

 - **Abstract**
 Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) have recently provided compelling evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) in the nanohertz frequency band, offering a unique window into fundamental physics. Here, we explore implications for symmetric teleparallel $f(Q)$ gravity, a theory in which deviations from General Relativity (GR) arise through the non-metricity scalar $f(Q)$. Crucially, tensor modes propagate at the speed of light in this framework. However, their amplitude undergoes a modified damping during their evolution. We adopt a model-independent parameterization and derive an analytic approximation to the tensor mode transfer function to obtain the spectral energy density of primordial inflationary gravitational waves. Comparison with the NANOGrav 15-year and IPTA second data releases show that the inferred damping parameter $n$ remains consistent with GR, yet allows small deviations that could be observable. We then conduct a Fisher information matrix forecasts which demonstrate that the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) observatory will improve these constraints by several orders of magnitude, offering the potential to distinguish $f(Q)$ gravity from GR with high precision. These results highlight PTAs as powerful probes of non-metricity-based modifications to gravity.
#### Properties of Galactic Outflows Driven by Starburst at Cosmic Noon: Insights from Hydrodynamical Simulations

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate starburst-driven galactic outflows in low-mass galaxies ($9.0 < \log(M_*/M_\odot) < 10.0$) at cosmic noon using high-resolution 3D hydrodynamical simulations based on a framework that can reproduce the multiphase outflows in M82. The simulations produce starbursts lasting 20-30 Myr, with peak star formation rates of 2-68 M$_\odot \,\rm{yr}^{-1}$. Outflow properties vary strongly with time, radial distance to galaxy center, stellar mass, and gas fraction, exhibiting velocities of 50-1000 $\,\rm{km\,s}^{-1}$, mass outflow rates of 0.3-20 M$_\odot \,\rm{yr}^{-1}$, and mass loading factors, $\eta_\mathrm{M}$, of 0.24-6.26. The cool phase ($8000 < T \le 2 \times 10^4$ K) dominates the outflow, and properties of the cool and warm phases are broadly consistent with observations. At $M_*= 10^{9.5}\,M_\odot$, average $\eta_\mathrm{M}$ for the total, cool, and warm phases are $\sim$1.2, 0.75, and 0.25, respectively. The mass loading factor decreases with increasing galaxy stellar mass, but increases with star formation rate. Given strong temporal and spatial evolution, scaling slopes from limited samples should be treated with caution. Our total $\eta_\mathrm{M}$ values are higher than FIRE-2 by 0.06 dex but lower than EAGLE and TNG50 by 0.50 and 0.84 dex. Accounting for methodological differences in outflow measurement reduces these gaps to 0.2-0.4 dex, suggesting that part of the discrepancy between observations and simulations reported in the literature may arise from inconsistent definitions and measurement methods, though differences in individual phases persist. Larger observational and simulation samples, together with consistent methods for measuring outflow properties, are required to draw robust conclusions about the scaling relations of galactic outflows.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.07661

 - **Abstract**
 The viscous properties of the intracluster medium (ICM) remain poorly constrained. Cold fronts-sharp discontinuities formed during cluster mergers-offer a potential avenue to probe the effective viscosity of the ICM. Velocity shear across these fronts should generate Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities (KHI), unless viscosity or magnetic tension suppresses them. We perform cluster merger simulations incorporating four ICM viscosity models: (A) inviscid, (B) isotropic Spitzer viscosity, (C) anisotropic Braginskii viscosity, and (D) Braginskii viscosity limited by microinstabilities. The isotropic Spitzer viscosity (case B) strongly suppresses KHI, producing smooth cold front surfaces, while the inviscid (A) and microinstability-limited (D) cases show prominent ripples. The Braginskii case (C) yields intermediate suppression. We also vary the plasma $\beta$ parameter ($\beta \approx$ 100 and 1600) to examine how a changing magnetic field strength affects the results. Stronger magnetic fields further suppress KHI, leading to smoother fronts and reduced differences between different viscosity models, while also widening the range of permitted pressure anisotropies when microinstability-based limiters are present. These results indicate that both viscosity and magnetic fields play crucial roles in stabilising sloshing cold fronts in galaxy clusters.
#### Twisted Pseudodisk and Asymmetric Mass Accretion on the Circumstellar Disk

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.07741

 - **Abstract**
 We model gas inflow patterns onto circumstellar disks and the evolution of the pseudodisk using three-dimensional resistive MHD simulations. Starting from a prestellar core without turbulence and with a misalignment between the initial magnetic field and rotation axis, the simulations are performed for $\sim10^5$ yr after protostar formation. After disk formation, the magnetic field around the disk becomes significantly distorted due to the disk rotational motion. Consequently, the structure of the pseudodisk also evolves into a complex morphology. As a result, both accretion onto the disk and outflow become asymmetric and anisotropic. Accretion to the disk occurs primarily through narrow-channel flows or streams. The time evolution of the infalling envelope leads to non-steady accretion onto the disk, which in turn causes variability in the mass accretion onto the central protostar. This study demonstrates that complex infalling envelope structures and channelized accretion flows onto the disk naturally arise even without assuming turbulence or external asymmetric inflows.

 - **Abstract**
 It is well known that, in potentials that are quadratic near the minimum but shallower away, such as small-$\alpha$ ($\ll M_P^2$) attractors, the inflaton condensate fragments into localized compact objects known as oscillons during self-resonance preheating. In this work we investigate the self-resonance in deformed $\alpha$-attractor T-model with a Gaussian feature near the minimum, distant from inflation's end. Linear analysis reveals altered resonance bands and deformed Floquet charts dependent on feature parameters. In fully nonlinear lattice simulations, we find that the gradient energy transfer is largely independent of the potential feature parameter $h$. In contrast, after resonance terminates, the subsequent evolution of gradient energy becomes strongly dependent on $h$. Statistical analysis reveals that models with the potential feature produce larger number of smaller oscillons, with a reduced energy stored in these objects, increasingly suppressed as the magnitude of $h$ grows. By tracking the total energy and the gradient energy contained in oscillons, we find that in models with nonzero $h$ oscillons are systematically shorter-lived, with this effect strengthening for larger $h$. The gravitational wave emission is dominated by the resonance stage and is strongly suppressed once oscillons form. Potential features leave the low-frequency spectrum largely unchanged but significantly modify the high-frequency tail. Although a complete reheating description requires external couplings and higher-resolution simulations, clear qualitative differences of cosmic expansion history already emerge within our simulated time window. These results highlight the important role of potential features in shaping reheating dynamics and their cosmological implications, and provide a deeper understanding of preheating dynamics and the properties of oscillons.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the Solar system Objects Light curve Observatory (SOLO), a wide-field, high-cadence optical survey system designed to obtain absolutely calibrated asteroid light curves, converted to the Gaia G-band photometric system, in support of the SPHEREx Solar System Object Catalog (SSOC). SOLO was installed at the Sierra Remote Observatories (SRO) in California, USA, in July 2025 and is optimized for continuous, multi-night monitoring of asteroid brightness variations. We describe the system configuration, remote operation, and data reduction pipeline, and evaluate its optical and photometric performance using commissioning data. SOLO achieves stable photometric calibration across the 11.6 deg^2 field of view and reaches a 10-sigma limiting magnitude of G ~ 17.5 for a 180 sec exposure. Sample asteroid light curves obtained over multiple nights demonstrate consistent absolute photometry at the same rotational phase, validating the estimated performance. Finally, we outline the planned operational use of SOLO in connection with NASA's SPHEREx mission. Full science operations of SOLO are scheduled to begin in January 2026. Using these data, we aim to obtain on the order of 10^3 absolutely calibrated asteroid light curves per year in the Gaia G-band, which will be used to support the construction and scientific utilization of the SPHEREx SSOC.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a statistical study of pulsars and millisecond pulsars (MSPs) based on multiwavelength observations in the Galactic Field and Globular Clusters. We examine their emission properties, timing behavior, and spatial distributions, and discuss how theoretical models are required to interpret these observational trends. We focus on the magnetic field spin relation, including spin up through accretion in binaries and spin down driven by magnetic dipole radiation. Using numerical tools such as NBODY6++GPU, CMC, and COMPASS, we explore how dynamical interactions and binary evolution shape the properties of compact objects. Despite major progress, several open questions remain regarding binary interactions, magnetic field evolution, and the incorporation of pulsar physics into large scale simulations. Our analysis highlights the need for improved modeling frameworks to better understand the formation pathways and long term evolution of pulsars and MSPs.

 - **Abstract**
 The existence of winds is among the uncertainties related to the growth of giant planets. Such circumplanetary outflows have been proposed to explain kinematic and chemical structures in protoplanetary disks. We investigate the immediate impact of circumplanetary outflows on the circumstellar disk environment, the planetary vicinity, and planetary growth. We performed three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations using \texttt{FARGO3D}, implementing a parametric wind launched from the vicinity of an embedded planet. Although the imposed configurations for the outflows do not significantly alter the global structure of the disk, they do substantially redistribute material in the vicinity of the embedded planet. In particular, the wind redirects accretion flows from polar to equatorial latitudes, resulting in variable accretion patterns over time. Although the mass accretion rate variations depend on the efficiency of the outflows, their presence diminishes the accretion rate over time and the total mass reservoir within the Hill sphere and the planet's direct vicinity, potentially slowing or limiting planetary growth.

 - **Abstract**
 This second paper in our series investigates the evolutionary mechanisms that shape pulsars and millisecond pulsars (MSPs) across different astrophysical environments. We focus on the physical processes that govern spin evolution, magnetic field decay, binary interactions, and recycling pathways. Using observational constraints together with theoretical models, we examine how accretion, magnetic braking, and dynamical encounters contribute to the long-term evolution of compact objects. We also explore how these mechanisms differ between the Galactic Field and Globular Clusters, where stellar densities and interaction rates vary significantly. By integrating insights from population studies and numerical tools such as NBODY6++GPU, CMC, and COMPASS, we aim to clarify the dominant channels that lead to the formation and transformation of pulsars and MSPs. Our results highlight key uncertainties in current models and outline the physical ingredients required for more accurate simulations of compact object evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) from the merger of binary compact objects (BCOs) could occur in the accretion disks of the active galactic nucleus (AGN). Before merging, the BCO will inevitably form a low-density cavity. The sGRB jet will interact with the AGN disk photons during its propagation through the cavity, leading to unique electromagnetic and neutrino signatures. In this work, we investigate the influence of the AGN disk photon field on neutrino emission within the internal dissipation regions of a two-component sGRB jet (a narrow core and a wide wing). We find that, due to the strong AGN disk photon field, the neutrino flux at high-energy part (e.g., PeV to EeV) will be suppressed, while the relatively lower-energy part (e.g., TeV to PeV) will be enhanced. Such a conclusion can enhance the constraints on GRB parameters (e.g., baryonic loading factor and bulk Lorentz factor) based on the future detection or non-detection of high-energy neutrinos from GRBs. Besides, the two-component jet can display two-bump structure at higher and lower energy in the neutrino spectrum. Therefore, the joint observations of electromagnetic and neutrinos emission can help us identify the sGRB jet and its structure in the AGN disk.

 Reproducibility is a cornerstone of science. FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) data is often a vital step towards testing the reproducibility of results. The implementation of FAIR principles in the astrophysical simulation community is still varied. We approach the discussion of this topic mainly from a high-performance computing (HPC) point of view. We identify the main obstacles to FAIR astrophysics simulations: First, the vast datasets created in simulations on HPC facilities complicate FAIR data management. Second, missing incentives to fully share codes, results, and diagnostic data. Third, a lack of workflows that include data publication and technical support. Therefore, particularly smaller research groups struggle due to the unavailability of dedicated personnel and time in their efforts towards FAIR and open simulations. We propose actionable steps towards achieving ``FAIRer'' data and open source publication standards in numerical astrophysics. Our suggestions include low-threshold methods to fulfil the basic FAIR requirements as well as basic tools for FAIR (meta-)data generation and data/code publication. This work is a high-level overview intended to initiate discussions within the community, offering initial solutions to these challenges.
#### Dynamics of Y Dwarf Atmospheres

 - **Abstract**
 The global circulation regime of the coolest brown dwarfs, the Y dwarfs, remains largely unexplored. We investigate the interplay between convection, rotation, and cloud thermal feedback using a selected sample of Y dwarf atmospheric models. We explore effective temperatures $400~\mathrm{K} \leq T_{\mathrm{eff}} \leq 600~\mathrm{K}$ and rotation periods $P_{\mathrm{rot}} = 2.5 \text{--} 20\ \mathrm{h}$, where salt and sulfide condensates are expected. We include $\mathrm{KCl,~Na_{2}S}$, and $\mathrm{MnS}$ clouds to assess their atmospheric impact and identify circulation regimes across parameter space. We run twelve general circulation models (GCMs) spanning this grid and develop additional physics modules for the THOR GCM to model brown dwarf atmospheres. The dynamical core is coupled to interior thermal perturbations near the radiative-convective boundary, a mixing-length convection scheme, gray two-stream radiative transfer with Rosseland-mean opacities, and simple cloud tracers including thermal feedback and scattering. All simulations exhibit a radiative-forcing-dominated regime with weak winds, minimal horizontal temperature contrasts, and no persistent jets. Convection controls vertical mixing and sets the extent of salt and sulfide cloud layers below the photosphere. Thermal structures equilibrate quickly and cloud radiative feedback remains insignificant, with limited variability. Within the gray radiative transfer framework adopted here, Y dwarf atmospheres in this parameter space are controlled by interior thermal radiation. Rotation sets modest variability, while clouds play a secondary role. Because our single-band approach does not capture spectral windows that could probe deeper cloud layers, our constraints on cloud radiative feedback are likely conservative, and we outline pathways toward more active regimes.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a multi-wavelength study of nuclear outflows in the nearby dwarf Seyfert galaxy NGC~4395, which hosts an intermediate-mass black hole. Using \textit{JWST}/NIRSpec and MIRI IFU spectroscopy (1.66--28.6~$\mu$m), together with ALMA and Gemini/GMOS data, we probe the ionised and molecular gas on parsec scales. The JWST nuclear spectra reveal 134 emission lines, including H\,\textsc{i}, He, numerous fine-structure lines, H$_2$ rotational/ro-vibrational transitions, and several PAH bands. Modelling of the H$_2$ rotational lines reveals three warm/hot molecular components ($T\!\approx\!580$, 1480, and 2900~K), along with a cold ($<50$~K) phase traced by ALMA CO(2--1). Outflow signatures are detected in cold and warm/hot molecular gas, in H\,\textsc{i}, and in 36 fine-structure lines spanning ionisation potentials of 7.6--300~eV. Ionised outflow velocities range from 127 to 716~km\,s$^{-1}$, with blueshifted and redshifted components consistent with a stratified biconical geometry. The cold molecular gas shows a mass outflow rate nearly 1--2 orders of magnitude larger than that of the warm/hot molecular and ionised phases. The kinetic coupling efficiency is 0.003--0.12\% for the coronal-line gas and 0.4--1.4\% for the H\,\textsc{i} outflow, indicating that only the low-ionisation gas significantly impacts the surrounding ISM. Outflow velocity and the fraction of flux in the outflowing component increase with ionisation potential, implying that the most highly ionised gas originates closest to the AGN and is most efficiently accelerated.

 - **Abstract**
 Identifying the host galaxy of a binary black hole (BBH) merger detected via gravitational waves (GWs) remains a challenge due to the absence of electromagnetic counterparts and the large localization volumes produced by current-generation detectors. A confident host association would provide stellar population properties to constrain BBH formation channels and enable measurements of cosmological parameters such as the Hubble constant, H0. We simulate BBH mergers in nearby (z<0.25) host galaxies to evaluate the feasibility of host identification with future GW detector networks, including configurations with the planned LIGO-India detector and third-generation detectors such as the Einstein Telescope (ET) and Cosmic Explorer (CE). We construct two injection grids to explore variations in BBH mass, distance, and directional sensitivity, and infer localization volumes using the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM)-based parameter estimation implemented through BILBY. To assess the prospects for unique host identification, we introduce a set of diagnostics: theoretical comoving volume thresholds for galaxies of a given stellar mass, derived from galaxy stellar mass functions, a metallicity-based volume threshold motivated by progenitor environment models, stellar mass fractions to quantify candidate host prominence, and the probability of chance alignment (p_c). These metrics provide ways to evaluate host associations and constrain BBH formation channels. We find that future networks that include ET and CE localize BBH mergers to volumes smaller than those theoretical thresholds, implying potentially unique host identification, out to ~1000 Mpc at a rate of ~100 yr^{-1}. While associations for individual events may remain uncertain, our framework is well-suited to population-level analyses, enabling constraints on BBH formation scenarios in the era of next-generation GW detector networks.

 - **Abstract**
 We study tidal disruption events (TDEs) and compact object inspirals in nuclear star clusters (NSCs) hosting a central supermassive black hole (SMBH), focusing on their role in SMBH growth. Using the STARDISK version of the direct N-body code NBODY6++GPU, we perform pilot simulations with two improved models: one for mass fallback from TDEs and another for compact object plunges based on orbital decay timescales. Our results show that mass accretion via TDEs peaks within the first 2 Myr and decreases more rapidly for higher initial SMBH masses, with roughly half the disrupted stellar debris being accreted. Compact object accretion is confined mostly to orbits with pericenters between 4 and 27 Schwarzschild radii and is suppressed by an order of magnitude when inspiral criteria are applied.

 - **Abstract**
 Based on very high-resolution resistive 2D and 3D magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations of current sheets, our findings suggest that the answer to this question is likely no. In contrast, turbulence-mediated reconnection yields significantly faster reconnection rates - about an order of magnitude higher than the so-called universal rate for plasmoid-mediated reconnection in MHD flows ($V_\text{rec}/V_A \sim 0.01$). We conclude that turbulence-driven reconnection is the dominant mechanism responsible for fast reconnection and flares in systems such as accretion flows and relativistic jets in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). In these environments, turbulence is driven by instabilities such as the magneto-rotational instability (MRI), Parker-Rayleigh-Taylor instability (PRTI), and current-driven kink instability (CDKI). Finally, we present 3D General Relativistic MHD simulations of accretion flows that confirm the crucial role of turbulence-mediated reconnection in AGN systems. These findings have important implications for understanding the origin of flares, particle acceleration, and the production of polarized radiation in these extreme environments.

 - **Abstract**
 The Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability occurs in multiple heliospheric (solar-wind stream interfaces, planetary magnetospheres, cometary tails, heliopause flanks) and interstellar (protoplanetary disks, relativistic jets, neutron star accretion disks) environments. While the KH instability has been well-studied in the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) limit, only limited studies were performed in the collisionless regime, which is conducive to development of anisotropic pressures. Collisionless plasmas are often described using the Chew Goldberger and Low (CGL) equations which feature an anisotropic pressure tensor. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the CGL version of the KH instability using linearised and numerical techniques. We find that the largest growth rates and the greatest incidence of magnetic effects occur in the MHD limit. In the large relaxation time CGL limit, part of the energy goes into the formation of pressure anisotropies, resulting in smaller amounts of energy being available for bending the field lines. Consequently, when we cross-compare CGL and MHD simulations that are otherwise identical, the current densities are largest in the MHD limit, and the largest magnetic islands also form in that limit. Early and late time formation of pressure anisotropies have also been studied. We also find that the strongest trend for forming intermittencies in the flow also occurs in the MHD limit. The paper also discusses possible consequences of our results for turbulence and reconnection in the heliosheath (the layer between the solar wind termination shock and the heliopause).
#### CHIMPS2: The physical properties and star formation efficiency of molecular gas in the Central Molecular Zone

 - **Abstract**
 We present Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) estimates of the physical properties and star formation efficiency (SFE) of molecular gas in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ), using new $^{12}$CO $J=2\to1$ observations from the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope. Combined with CHIMPS2 $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO $J=3\to2$, and SEDIGISM $^{13}$CO $J=2\to1$ data, we estimate a median excitation temperature of $T_{\rm ex} = 11$K for $^{13}$CO throughout the CMZ, with peaks exceeding $120$K in the Sgr B1/B2 complex. Cooler gas dominates around Sgr A and nearby clouds. We derive a median H$_{2}$ column-density of $N(\mathrm{H}2) = 2 \times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ and a total $^{13}$CO-traced gas mass of $M_{\rm gas} = 7 \times 10^6$ M$_\odot$, consistent with previous estimates when accounting for spatial coverage. The instantaneous SFE is assessed using Hi-GAL compact sources detected at 70-$\mu m$ and 160--500-$\mu m$. The 70-$\mu m$-bright SFE, tracing current star formation, is modest overall but elevated in Sgr B1/B2, the Arches cluster, and Sgr C. In contrast, the 160--500-$\mu m$ SFE, tracing cold pre-stellar gas, is more broadly enhanced, particularly in the dust ridge clouds and towards negative longitudes surrounding Sgr C. The contrasting distributions suggest an evolutionary gradient in SFE, consistent with a transition from dense, cold gas to embedded protostars. Our results imply that the CMZ may be enter a more active phase of star formation, with large reservoirs of gas primed for future activity.

 - **Abstract**
 LOFAR observations of diffuse interstellar polarization at meter wavelengths reveal intricate polarized intensity structures with an unexpected correlation with neutral HI filaments that could not be reproduced in simulations with low cold neutral medium (CNM) abundance. We investigate whether MHD simulations of thermally bi-stable neutral interstellar medium, with a range of CNM fraction, can reproduce the properties of the 3C196 field, the high Galactic latitude test field. Using 50 pc simulations with varying levels of turbulence and compressibility, we generated synthetic 21 cm and synchrotron observations, including instrumental noise and beam effects, for different line-of-sight orientations relative to the magnetic field. We developed MOOSE, a code to generate synthetic synchrotron polarization and Faraday tomography. We also developed a metric based on the HOG algorithm, to quantify the relative contribution of cold and warm neutral medium structures to the Faraday tomographic data. The synthetic observations show levels of polarization intensity and RM values comparable to the 3C196 field, indicating that thermal electrons associated with the neutral HI phase can account for a significant fraction of the synchrotron polarized emission at 100-200 MHz. The simulations consistently reveal a correlation between CNM and Faraday tomographic structures that depends on turbulence level, magnetic field orientation, and observational noise, but only weakly on CNM fraction. We found slightly weaker CNM-Synchrotron polarized emission correlation level than observed in the 3C196 field. These results suggest that low-frequency polarimetric observations provide a valuable probe of magnetic-field morphology in the multi-phase Solar-neighborhood ISM, while simultaneously underscoring the need for improved modeling of the turbulent, multi-phase, and partially ionized interstellar medium.

 - **Abstract**
 Binaries in the cores of globular clusters are known to prevent the gravitational collapse of the cluster, and simulations predict that the core of NGC 6397 contains a large number of white dwarfs (WDs), of which many are expected to be part of a binary system. In this work, we report the discovery of a compact binary system consisting of two WDs in the centre of the Galactic globular cluster NGC 6397. The system, known in the literature as NF1, was observed as part of a MUSE radial-velocity survey aiming at characterizing the binary population in the centre of NGC 6397. The spectral analysis of NF1 provides an effective temperature of 16000 K and a surface gravity (log g) of 5.72 (cgs), which is consistent with an extremely low-mass He-core WD nature. This is further supported by the mass of 0.23 +/- 0.03 Msun obtained from fitting the star's spectral energy distribution using its HST magnitude in various filters. The system has a circular orbit with a period of 0.54 days. The radial velocities show a large semi-amplitude of 200 km/s, implying a minimum mass of 0.78 Msun for the invisible companion, which is likely another WD, or a neutron star if the inclination of the system is smaller than about 50 deg. Some significant residuals in radial velocity remain with our best orbital solution and we tested whether a model with a third body can explain these deviations. While this possibility seems promising, additional measurements are needed to confirm whether the star is actually part of a triple system.
#### Hints of sign-changing scalar field energy density and a transient acceleration phase at $z\sim 2$ from model-agnostic reconstructions

 - **Abstract**
 We present a data-driven reconstruction of the late-time expansion history and its implications for dark-energy dynamics. Modeling the reduced Hubble rate with a node-based Gaussian-process-kernel interpolant, we constrain the reconstruction using CC, Pantheon+ SNIa, BAO data from SDSS and DESI, transversal BAO data, and external $H_0$ priors (SH0ES and H0DN). Assuming GR at the background level, we map the reconstructed kinematics onto a dark-energy fluid and a scalar-field description, yielding the total potential and kinetic contributions that reproduce the inferred $H(z)$. To interpret the reconstruction, we consider both a minimal single-field model (canonical or phantom) and a two-field (quintom) system consisting of one canonical and one phantom scalar field (or families). Within the GR-based effective-fluid mapping, the inferred dark-energy density changes sign for all dataset combinations explored, transitioning from $\rho_{\rm DE}<0$ at higher redshift to $\rho_{\rm DE}>0$ toward the present, and defining a transition redshift $z_\dagger$ by $\rho_{\rm DE}(z_\dagger)=0$. A single canonical scalar cannot realize such a smooth evolution during expansion, whereas a phantom field or a two-field quintom framework can accommodate the required behavior; in particular, the two-field system permits smooth phantom-divide crossings at finite $\rho_{\rm DE}>0$ and distinguishes them from the separate notion of a density zero crossing. The reconstructed kinematics admit intermediate-redshift structure in some combinations, including hints of an additional accelerated-expansion interval around $z\sim 1.7$--$2.3$. The present-day equation of state remains close to a cosmological constant: combinations including supernovae give $w_0\simeq -1$, while combinations without supernovae but with an external $H_0$ prior show only a mild preference for $w_0<-1$ at the $\sim1.5$--$1.7\sigma$ level.
#### Microquasar Remnants as Pevatrons Illuminating the Galactic Cosmic Ray Knee

 - **Abstract**
 Microquasars are primary candidates for Galactic PeVatrons, yet their collective contribution to the cosmic ray (CR) ``knee" remains poorly understood. We investigate this contribution by simulating anisotropic diffusive propagation through the Galactic magnetic field (GMF). Our results demonstrate that the GMF establishes a transport regime where magnetic connectivity between sources and the solar neighborhood determines the local flux. Active sources aligned with local GMF lines, such as Cygnus X-1, exhibit significant flux enhancements, while magnetically disconnected sources, such as V616 Mon, are strongly suppressed. By integrating source evolution with anisotropic transport, we show that the observed proton bump at the CR ``knee" is best reproduced by the cumulative contribution of microquasar remnants, which is often dominated by a few nearby or recent events, rather than the active ones alone. We find that a harder injection spectrum allows CRs from remnants to reproduce the PeV bump after propagation, as low-energy CRs have sufficient time to accumulate while high-energy CRs escape the Galactic plane. Our findings suggest that the integrated history of microquasar remnants, governed by the interplay of source age and magnetic connectivity, is the primary driver populating the observed CR ``knee''.

 - **Abstract**
 PN K4-47 is a young planetary nebula that exhibits shock-excited bipolar lobes and a complex molecular environment, with the highest number of molecules detected within a planetary nebula. It has been questioned whether K4-47 is indeed a `typical' planetary nebula, or may be more exotic in nature. We examine this question using optical imaging and spectroscopy, and sub-millimetre and radio interferometry. Our observations spatially resolve the sub-millimetre environment of K4-47 for the first time. We find elongated CO (2-1) emission along a similar PA to the optical bipolar outflow. We derive a distance upper limit of 6 kpc to the source. The source hosts a fast ($\sim$350 km s$^{-1}$) bipolar optical outflow, and a slow (~50-60 km s$^{-1}$) molecular outflow along a similar PA. The outflow velocity indicates an age of 336 $\pm$ 119 yr. We also find that the excitation temperature and density of the atomic gas is~20 kK and 2800 cm$^{-3}$, respectively. The elemental and isotopic enrichment of K4-47 infers an AGB progenitor mass of 4-6 M$_{\odot}$, which corresponds to a white dwarf mass of ~1 M$_{\odot}$, following the initial-final mass relation for white dwarfs. We find that the core of K4-47 must contain 10$^{-2}$ M$_{\odot}$ of dust to explain the extinction, and that photoionisation alone cannot explain the excitation of the atomic gas. We instead require an additional heating mechanism, with shocks a likely scenario. It is likely that the progenitor star of K4-47 was a J-type carbon AGB star, which formed the molecular and dusty circumstellar environment. The bipolar outflow is later triggered, punching through the circumstellar environment, producing shocks, and shaping the environment into the elongated structure seen in the sub-millimetre. We therefore classify K4-47 as a genuine, if unusual, planetary nebula.

 - **Abstract**
 The Solar Hemispherical Helicity Rule(s) (SHHR) is a term used to represent a bias observed in proxies for the magnetic helicity in active regions at the solar surface. The SHHR states that predominantly negative magnetic helicity is observed in active regions in the northern hemisphere, whereas predominantly positive is found in the southern. The $\Sigma$-effect model of \cite{longcope1998flux} is one of the most cited models for the explanation of the SHHR. In this model, the magnetic structures derive the bias in their magnetic helicity from the kinetic helicity of the turbulent convection through which they travel, where the latter is handed owing to the rotational influence of the star. The original paper built an elegant mathematical model for the dynamics of thin flux tubes influenced by parameterized helical turbulence. Here, we attempt to explore the conceptual ideas of this original simplified model using fully-nonlinear, three-dimensional, Cartesian-domain simulations of isolated, finite cross-sectional, twisted magnetic flux structures rising though rotating, overshooting, turbulent compressible convection. We look for evidence of a correlation between the kinetic helicity content of the turbulence and the evolving magnetic helicity of the structures. We find little evidence of such a relationship, and do not even find any clear hemispheric dependence. Although these simulations are far from a perfect representation of the ideas, this work raises many questions about the potential efficacy of the $\Sigma$-effect in reality.

 - **Abstract**
 We have used data collected by the Birmingham Solar-Oscillations Network (BiSON) to perform a helioseismic diagnosis of changes to the Sun's internal structure between four successive solar cycle minima, beginning with the minimum at the end of cycle 21 and ending with the recent minimum at the beginning of cycle 25. The unique duration of the BiSON database makes such a study possible. We used the low-degree BiSON p-mode frequencies to constrain structural changes between minima in the layers above $\approx 0.9 R_{\odot}$. We accomplished this by examining variations in the HeII ionisation zone signature; and by inverting the frequency differences to infer changes in the sound speed. Additionally, we employed frequency differences between various solar models that had subtle modifications to their internal structures to facilitate analysis of the observations. We find evidence for small, but marginally significant, changes in structure between different minima. The HeII signature was larger, and the sound speed in the range $\approx 0.93$ to $0.97 R_{\odot}$ was slightly higher, during the cycle 23/24 minimum, than during the other minima. The cycle 23/24 minimum was the deepest, as measured by proxies of global solar activity. These findings are consistent with magnetic flux levels having been lower in this minimum than the others, resulting in a higher gas pressure, higher temperatures, and higher sound speed. Our results demonstrate the potential of using asteroseismic data to perform similar analyses on other solar-type stars.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore, using a state-of-the-art simulation code in 3D and to late enough times to witness final observables, the dependence of core-collapse supernova explosions on the nuclear equation of state. Going beyond questions of explodability, we compare final explosion energies, nucleosynthetic yields, recoil kicks, and gravitational-wave and neutrino signatures using the SFHo and DD2 nuclear equations of state (EOS) for a 9-$M_{\odot}$/solar-metallicity progenitor star. The DD2 EOS is stiffer and has a lower effective nucleon mass. The result is a more extended protoneutron star (PNS) and lower central densities. As a consequence, the mean neutrino energies, final explosion energy, and recoil kick speed are lower. Moreover, the evolution of PNS convection differs between the two EOS models in significant ways. This translates in part into interestingly altered neutrino ``light" curves and noticeably altered gravitational-wave signal strengths and frequency characteristics that may be diagnostic. The faster exploding model (SFHo) yields slightly more neutron-rich ejecta and more species with atomic weights between 60 and 90 and a weak r-process. However, this is merely a preliminary study. The next step is a more comprehensive and multi-progenitor set of 3D supernova simulations for various EOSes to late times when the observables have asymptoted. Such a future investigation will have a direct bearing on the neutron star and black hole birth mass functions and the quest towards a fully quantitative theory of supernova observables.
