 - **Abstract**
 Little Red Dots (LRDs) are compact, point-like sources characterized by their red color and broad Balmer lines, which have been debated to be either dominated by active galactic nuclei (AGN) or dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs). Here we report two LRDs (ID9094 and ID2756) at z$_{\rm spec}$>7, recently discovered in the JWST FRESCO GOODS-North field. Both satisfy the "v-shape" colors and compactness criteria for LRDs and are identified as Type-I AGN candidates based on their broad H$\beta$ emission lines (full width at half maximum: 2276$\pm$492 km/s for ID9094 and 1069$\pm$239 km/s for ID2756) and narrow [OI] lines ($\sim$ 300-400 km/s). To investigate their nature, we conduct deep NOEMA follow-up observations targeting the [CII] 158${\rm \mu m}$ emission line and the 1.3 mm dust continuum. We do not detect [CII] or 1.3 mm continuum emission for either source. Notably, in the scenario that the two LRDs were DSFGs, we would expect significant detections: $>16\sigma$ for [CII] and $>3\sigma$ for the 1.3 mm continuum of ID9094, and $>5\sigma$ for [CII] of ID2756. Using the 3$\sigma$ upper limits of [CII] and 1.3 mm, we perform two analyses: (1) UV-to-FIR spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting with and without AGN components, and (2) comparison of their properties with the L$_{[CII]}$-SFR$_{tot}$ empirical relation. Both analyses indicate that LRDs favor the presence of AGN to explain their observed properties. Our results highlight the importance of far-infrared observations for studying LRDs, a regime that remains largely unexplored.

 - **Abstract**
 The Photometric Objects Around Cosmic Webs (PAC) method integrates cosmological photometric and spectroscopic surveys, offering valuable insights into galaxy formation. PAC measures the excess surface density of photometric objects, $\bar{n}_2w_{\rm{p}}$, with specific physical properties around spectroscopic tracers. In this study, we improve the PAC method to make it more rigorous and eliminate the need for redshift bins. We apply the enhanced PAC method to the DESI Y1 BGS Bright spectroscopic sample and the deep DECaLS photometric sample, obtaining $\bar{n}_2w_{\rm{p}}$ measurements across the complete stellar mass range, from $10^{5.3}{\rm M}_{\odot}$ to $10^{11.5}{\rm M}_{\odot}$ for blue galaxies, and from $10^{6.3}{\rm M}_{\odot}$ to $10^{11.9}{\rm M}_{\odot}$ for red galaxies. We combine $\bar{n}_2w_{\rm{p}}$ with $w_{\rm{p}}$ measurements from the BGS sample, which is not necessarily complete in stellar mass. Assuming that galaxy bias is primarily determined by stellar mass and colour, we derive the galaxy stellar mass functions (GSMFs) down to $10^{5.3}{\rm M}_{\odot}$ for blue galaxies and $10^{6.3}{\rm M}_{\odot}$ for red galaxies, while also setting lower limits for smaller masses. The blue and red GSMFs are well described by single and double Schechter functions, respectively, with low-mass end slopes of $\alpha_{\rm{blue}}=-1.54^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$ and $\alpha_{\rm{red}}=-2.50^{+0.08}_{-0.08}$, resulting in the dominance of red galaxies below $10^{7.6}{\rm M}_{\odot}$. Stage-IV cosmological photometric surveys, capable of reaching 2-3 magnitudes deeper than DECaLS, present an opportunity to explore the entire galaxy population in the local universe with PAC. This advancement allows us to address critical questions regarding the nature of dark matter, the physics of reionization, and the formation of dwarf galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent JWST observations hint at unexpectedly intense cosmic star-formation in the early Universe, often attributed to enhanced star-formation efficiencies (SFEs). Here, we analyze the SFE in THESAN-ZOOM, a novel zoom-in radiation-hydrodynamic simulation campaign of high-redshift ($z \gtrsim 3$) galaxies employing a state-of-the-art galaxy formation model resolving the multiphase interstellar medium (ISM). The halo-scale SFE ($\epsilon^{\ast}_{\rm halo}$) - the fraction of baryons accreted by a halo that are converted to stars - follows a double power-law dependence on halo mass, with a mild redshift evolution above $M_{\rm halo} \gtrsim 10^{9.5}\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$. The power-law slope is roughly $1/3$ at large halo masses, consistent with expectations when gas outflows are momentum-driven. At lower masses, the slope is roughly $2/3$ and is more aligned with the energy-driven outflow scenario. $\epsilon^{\ast}_{\rm halo}$ is a factor of $2-3$ larger than commonly assumed in empirical galaxy-formation models at $M_{\rm halo} \lesssim 10^{11}\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$. On galactic (kpc) scales, the Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation of neutral gas is universal in THESAN-ZOOM, following $\Sigma_{\rm SFR} \propto \Sigma_{\rm gas}^2$, indicative of a turbulent energy balance in the ISM maintained by stellar feedback. The rise of $\epsilon^{\ast}_{\rm halo}$ with halo mass can be traced primarily to increasing gas surface densities in massive galaxies, while the underlying KS relation and neutral, star-forming gas fraction remain unchanged. Although the increase in $\epsilon^{\ast}_{\rm halo}$ with redshift is relatively modest, it is sufficient to explain the large observed number density of UV-bright galaxies at $z \gtrsim 12$. However, reproducing the brightest sources at $M_{\rm UV} \lesssim -21$ may require extrapolating the SFE beyond the halo mass range directly covered by THESAN-ZOOM.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the spectroscopic confirmation of a merging pair of massive quiescent galaxies at $z=3.44$. Using JWST observations, we confirm that the two galaxies lie at a projected separation of 4.5 kpc with a velocity offset of $\sim 680\, {\rm km\, s^{-1}}\ (\delta_z \sim 0.01)$. The pair resides in the core of a known rich overdensity of galaxies, dubbed the "Cosmic Vine". For both pair members, modeling of the Spectral Energy Distributions and faint rest-frame optical emission lines indicate high stellar masses ($\log{(M_\star/M_\odot)}\sim10.9$) and suppressed star formation ($\log{\rm (sSFR/yr^{-1})}<-10$), more than an order of magnitude below the level of the star formation main sequence at this redshift. We then explore the Illustris-TNG simulation and the GAEA and SHARK semi-analytical models to examine whether they produce a pair of massive quiescent galaxies akin to that of the Cosmic Vine. While all models produce close pairs of massive quiescent galaxies at $2<z<4$ with comparable separations and velocity offsets, their predicted number densities are $10-80$ times lower than our observational constraint. This discrepancy cannot be fully explained by coarse time sampling in these models or the general challenge of forming early massive quiescent galaxies in simulations. Given that $>90\%$ of simulated pairs in the models that we analyzed merge by $z=0$, our findings suggest that our observed pair will likely coalesce into a single massive galaxy. The merger, occurring in the dense core of a large-scale structure, might represent a critical event in the formation of a brightest cluster galaxy and the morphological transformation of high-redshift disky quiescent galaxies into early-type ellipticals.

 - **Abstract**
 In addition to the hot intracluster medium, massive galaxy clusters host complex, multi-phase gaseous halos. In this work, we quantify the abundance, spatial distribution, and origin of the cool T < 10^4.5 K gas within clusters. To do so, we combine the TNG-Cluster and TNG300 cosmological magnetohydrodynamical simulations, yielding a sample of 632 simulated galaxy clusters at z=0 with masses M_200c ~ 10^14-15.4 solar masses. We find that cool gas is present in every cluster at z=0, although it constitutes only a small fraction of the total gas mass within twice the virial radius, ranging from ~10^-4 to a few per cent. The majority of cool gas resides in the cluster outskirts in infalling satellites and other halos. More rarely, cool gas can also be present in the central regions of clusters. More massive halos contain larger amounts (but not fractions) of cool gas ~10^10-12 solar masses, and we identify correlations between cluster cool gas fraction and several global halo and galaxy properties at fixed halo mass. Using Monte-Carlo Lagrangian tracer particles, we then track the origin of cool gas in present-day clusters. We find that the primary source is recent accretion at z < 0.1, predominantly in the form of pre-cooled gas carried by infalling satellite galaxies and other halos. However, in-situ cooling of the hot intracluster medium gas accreted at earlier epochs also contributes, especially in present-day cool-core clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 Most of our knowledge regarding molecular clouds and the early stages of star formation stems from molecular spectral-line observations. However, the various chemical and radiative-transfer effects, in combination with projection effects, can lead to a distorted view of molecular clouds. Our objective is to simultaneously study all of these effects by creating synthetic spectral-line observations based on a chemo-dynamical simulation of a collapsing molecular cloud. We performed a 3D ideal MHD simulation of a supercritical turbulent collapsing molecular cloud where the dynamical evolution was coupled to a nonequilibrium gas-grain chemical network consisting of 115 species, the evolution of which was governed by >1600 chemical reactions. We post-processed this simulation with a multilevel non-LTE radiative-transfer code to produce synthetic PPV data cubes of the CO, HCO+, HCN, and N2H+ (J = 1-0) transitions under various projection angles with respect to the mean component of the magnetic field. We find that the chemical abundances of various species in our simulated cloud tend to be over-predicted in comparison to observationally derived abundances and attribute this discrepancy to the fact that the cloud collapses rapidly and therefore the various species do not have enough time to deplete onto dust grains. This suggests that our initial conditions may not correspond to the initial conditions of real molecular clouds and cores. We show that the projection angle has a notable effect on the moment maps of the species for which we produced synthetic observations. Specifically, the integrated emission and velocity dispersion of CO, HCO+, and HCN are higher when the cloud is observed "face on" compared to "edge on," whereas column density maps exhibit an opposite trend. Finally, we show that only N2H+ is an accurate tracer of the column density of the cloud across all projection angles.

 - **Abstract**
 The TNG-Cluster magnetohydrodynamic cosmological simulations, produce a diverse population of X-ray cavities in the intracluster medium (ICM) of simulated galaxy clusters. These arise from episodic, high velocity, kinetic energy injections from the central active supermassive black hole (AGN, SMBH). Here, we present the first comprehensive comparative analysis of X-ray cavities in TNG-Cluster with observational data. First, we select a volume-limited sample of 35 real clusters ($z \leq 0.071$, M$_\text{500c}$ = 10$^{14-14.8}$ M$_\odot$) observed with the Chandra X-ray Observatory, identify 3 analogs for each in TNG-Cluster (total of 105) and generate mock Chandra images using same exposure times as their observed counterparts. We identify X-ray cavities and measure their properties in both datasets using identical techniques, ensuring a direct, apples-to-apples comparison. Our analysis reveals that both samples have a similar fraction of X-ray cavities (35-43 per cent). They exhibit comparable sizes and morphologies, although the sizes of simulated X-ray cavities still attached to the SMBH are somewhat larger in TNG-Cluster -- a scarcity at $< 10$ kpc. The area of TNG X-ray cavities increases as they rise in the ICM, consistent with the trend seen in the observational sample. The cavity powers, estimated using observational techniques, show good agreement between the two samples (10$^{42-45}$ erg.s$^{-1}$), suggesting that X-ray cavities in the simulation are an important heating mechanism in cluster cores. Overall, the rather simple AGN feedback model of TNG, with no model choices made to reproduce X-ray morphological features, and without cosmic rays, creates a quantitatively realistic population of X-ray cavities at cluster scales.

 - **Abstract**
 JWST is detecting an excess of high-redshift ($z\gtrsim 10$), bright galaxies challenging most theoretical predictions. To address this issue, we investigate the impact of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) on the halo mass function and UV luminosity function (LF) of super-early galaxies. We explore two key effects: (i) the enhancement of massive halos abundance due to the compact nature and spatial distribution of PBHs, and (ii) the luminosity boost, characterized by the Eddington ratio $\lambda_E$, due to Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) powered by matter accretion onto PBHs. We build an effective model, calibrated using data at lower redshifts ($z\approx 4-9$), to derive the evolution of the LF including the additional PBH contribution. Via Bayesian analysis, we find that: (a) Although a small fraction ($\log f_{\rm PBH} \approx -5.42$) of massive ($\log M_{\rm PBH} / {\rm M_{\odot}} \approx 8.37$), non-emitting ($\lambda_E=0$) PBHs can explain the galaxy excess via the halo abundance enhancement, this solution is excluded by CMB $\mu$-distortion constraints on monochromatic PBHs. (b) If PBHs power an AGN emitting at super-Eddington luminosity ($\lambda_E \approx 10$), the observed LF can be reproduced by a PBH population with characteristic mass $\log M_{\rm PBH} / {\rm M_{\odot}} \approx 3.69$ constituting a tiny ($\log f_{\rm PBH} \approx -8.16$) fraction of the cosmic dark matter content. In the AGN scenario, about 75% of the observed galaxies with ${\rm M_{UV}}=-21$ at $z=11$ should host a PBH-powered AGN and typically reside in low mass halos, $M_h = 10^{8-9} {\rm M_{\odot}}$. These predictions can be tested with available and forthcoming JWST spectroscopic data. We note that our analysis considers a lognormal PBH mass function and compares its parameters with monochromatic limits on PBH abundance. Further work is required to relax such limitations.
#### What Drives Cluster Cool-Core Transformations? A Population Level Analysis of TNG-Cluster

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.01969

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we examine the frequency and physical drivers of transformations from cool-core (CC) to non-cool-core (NCC) clusters, and vice versa, in a sample of 352 massive galaxy clusters (M_vir = 10^14-15.3 M_sun) from the TNG-Cluster magnetohydrodynamical cosmological simulation of galaxies. By identifying transformations based on the evolution of central entropy and focusing on z<2.5, we find that clusters frequently undergo such events, depending on their assembly and supermassive black hole histories. On average, clusters experience 2 to 3 transformations. Transformations can occur in both directions and can be temporary, but those to higher entropy cores, i.e. in the direction from CC to NCC states, are the vast majority. CC phases are shorter than NCC phases, and thus overall the TNG-Cluster population forms with low-entropy cores and moves towards NCC states with time. We study the role that mergers play in driving transformations, and find that mergers within ~1Gyr prior to a transformation toward higher (but not lower) entropy cores occur statistically more often than in a random control sample. Most importantly, we find examples of mergers associated with CC disruption regardless of their mass ratio or angular momentum. However, past merger activity is not a good predictor for z=0 CC status, at least based on core entropy, even though clusters undergoing more mergers eventually have the highest core entropy values at z=0. We consider the interplay between AGN feedback and evolving cluster core thermodynamics. We find that core transformations are accompanied by an increase in AGN activity, whereby frequent and repeated (kinetic) energy injections from the central SMBHs can produce a collective, long-term impact on central entropy, ultimately heating cluster cores. Whether such fast-paced periods of AGN activity are triggered by mergers is plausible, but not necessary.
#### Projection-angle effects when "observing" a turbulent magnetized collapsing molecular cloud. II. Magnetic field

 - **Abstract**
 Interstellar magnetic fields are thought to play a fundamental role in the evolution of star-forming regions. Polarized thermal dust emission serves as a key probe for understanding the structure of the POS component of the magnetic field. However, inclination effects can significantly influence the apparent morphology of the magnetic field and lead to erroneous conclusions regarding its dynamical importance. Our aim is to investigate how projection-angle effects impact dust polarization maps and to explore new ways for accessing the inclination angle of the mean component of the magnetic field with respect to the POS. We post-processed a 3D ideal MHD simulation of a turbulent collapsing molecular cloud and produced synthetic dust polarization measurements under various projection angles, ranging from "face-on" (i.e., viewed along the mean magnetic field direction) to "edge-on" (perpendicular to the mean magnetic field direction). Additionally, we used synthetic PPV data cubes from the CO (J = 1-0) transition, presented in a companion paper. The projected magnetic-field morphology is found to be highly affected by the projection angle with the hourglass morphology being clearly visible only for projection angles close to edge-on. We find that the direction of the apparent "flow" between successive velocity channels in the simulated PPV data cubes shows an increasing correlation with the synthetic dust polarization observations, as the cloud is observed closer to an edge-on orientation. Based on this property, we developed a new method to probe the inclination angle of the magnetic field relative to the POS. We validated our approach by generating additional synthetic data (PPV cubes and polarization maps) at an earlier stage of the cloud's evolution and demonstrated an excellent quantitative agreement between the derived inclination angle and the true observational angle.
#### The stochastic nature of migration of disc instability protoplanets in three-dimensional hydrodynamical and MHD simulations of fragmenting discs

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed analysis of the nature of migration of protoplanetary clumps formed via disc instability in self-consistent 3D hydrodynamical (HD) and magneto-hydrodynamical (MHD) simulations of self-gravitating discs. Motivated by the complex structure of protoplanetary clumps we do not introduce sink particles. We find that the orbital evolution of the clumps has a stochastic character but also exhibits recurrent properties over many orbits. Clump migration is governed by two sources of gravitational torques: a torque originating from a region about twice the Hill sphere around each clump's orbit, and the torque resulting from clump-clump interactions. Compared to non-magnetized companion runs, the latter are more frequent in MHD simulations, which give rise to more numerous clumps starting off at smaller masses, often below a Neptune mass. Clump-clump interactions can lead to temporary strong accelerations of migration in both directions, but integrated over time provide a lesser impact than disc-driven torques. They can also lead to clump mergers but do not cause ejections; a difference to previous works which adopted sink particles. The local "Hill torque" is responsible for the fast migration, inward or outward. Estimating the characteristic timescales of conventional migration in our regime, we find that the disc-driven migration timescales are in agreement with Type III migration. However, the dominant local torque is rapidly fluctuating, which reflects the turbulent nature of the flow. The resulting stochastic migration pattern is markedly different from Type III runaway migration and appears to be a distinctive feature of orbital dynamics in a fragmenting disc.

 - **Abstract**
 The new era of high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy will significantly improve our understanding of the intra-cluster medium (ICM) by providing precise constraints on its underlying physical properties. However, spectral fitting requires reasonable assumptions on the thermal and chemical distributions of the gas. We use the output of TNG-Cluster, the newest addition to the IllustrisTNG suite of cosmological magnetohydrodynamical simulations, to provide theoretical expectations for the multi-phase nature of the ICM across hundreds of z=0 clusters (M$_{500c}$ = 10$^{14.0-15.3}$ M$_\odot$) based upon a realistic model for galaxy formation and evolution. We create and analyse, in an observer-like manner, end-to-end XRISM/Resolve mock observations towards cluster centres. We then systematically compare the intrinsic properties of the simulated gas with the inferred ones from spectral fitting via a variety of commonly used spectral-emission models. Our analysis suggests that models with a distribution of temperatures, such as bvlognorm and bvgadem, better describe the complex thermal structure of the ICM, as predicted by TNG-Cluster, but incur biases of 0.5-2 keV (16th-84th percentiles). The 1T bvapec is too simplistic for the predicted broad temperature distributions, while a 2T double bvapec model systematically fails to capture the input temperature structure. However, all spectral emission models systematically underestimate the Fe abundance of the central ICM by ~0.1 Solar (~ 20 per cent) primarily due to projection effects. Selecting only strong cool core clusters leads to minor improvements on inference quality, removing the majority of outliers but maintaining similar overall biases and cluster-to-cluster scatter.
#### Gas outflows in two recently quenched galaxies at z = 4 and 7

 - **Abstract**
 Outflows are a key element in the baryon cycle of galaxies, and their properties provide a fundamental test for our models of how star formation quenches in galaxies. Here we report the detection of outflowing gas in two recently quenched, massive ($M_\star\sim10^{10.2}M_\odot$) galaxies at z=4.106 (NS_274) and z=7.276 (RUBIES-UDS-QG-z7) observed with JWST/NIRSpec. The outflows are traced by blue-shifted MgII absorption lines, and in the case of the z=4.1 system, also by FeII and NaI features. The spectra of the two sources are similar to those of local post-starburst galaxies, showing deep Balmer features and minimal star formation on 10 Myr timescales as traced by the lack of bright emission lines, also suggesting the absence of a strong and radiatively efficient AGN. The galaxies' SFHs are consistent with an abrupt quenching of star formation, which continued at rates of $\sim15\,M_\odot$/yr averaged over 100 Myr timescales. Dedicated millimeter observations of NS_274 constrain its dust obscured SFR to $<12\,M_\odot$/yr. Under simple geometrical assumptions, we derive mass loading factors $\lesssim1$ and $\sim50$ for the z=4.1 and z=7.3 systems, respectively, and similarly different energies carried by the outflows. Supernovae feedback can account for the mass and energy of the outflow in NS_274. However, the low mass loading factor and average gas velocity suggest that the observed outflow is unlikely to be the reason behind its quenching. SF-related processes seem to be insufficient to explain the extreme mass outflow rate of RUBIES-UDS-QG-z7, which would require an additional ejective mechanism such as an undetected AGN. Finally, the average outflow velocities per unit $M_\star$, SFR, or its surface area are consistent with those of lower-redshift post-starburst galaxies, suggesting that outflows in rapidly quenched galaxies might occur similarly across cosmic time.

 Young associations provide a record that traces the star formation process, and the youngest populations connect progenitor gas dynamics to the resulting stellar populations. We therefore conduct the first comprehensive overview of the Circinus Complex, an under-studied and massive ($\sim$1500 M$_{\odot}$) region consisting of approximately 3100 recently formed stars alongside the Circinus Molecular Cloud (CMC). We find a clear age pattern in the contiguous central region (CirCe), where younger stars are found further from the massive central cluster, and where the velocities are consistent with uniform expansion. By comparing this structure to an analogous STARFORGE simulation, we find that the age structure and dynamics of the association are consistent with star formation in two stages: the global collapse of the parent cloud that builds the $500 M_{\odot}$ central cluster ASCC 79, followed by triggered star formation in a shell swept up after the first massive stars form. We also find that filaments with a range of distances from the central cluster can naturally produce multi-generational age sequences due to differences in feedback strength and exposure. Outlying populations show velocities consistent with formation independent from the CirCe region, but with similar enough velocities that they may be difficult to distinguish from one another later in their expansion. We therefore provide a new alternative view of sequential star formation that relies on feedback from a single central cluster rather than the multiple sequential generations that are traditionally invoked, while also providing insight into the star formation history of older populations.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents the gamma-ray spectral and timing results from the long-term regular observations of Mrk 421 with the Large Area Telescope (LAT) onboard Fermi during 2008 August - 2023 August. We discerned six periods the relatively stronger 0.3-300 GeV activity compared to other time intervals. The baseline brightness level varied on timescales from several months to years during these periods, which was superimposed by shorter-term flares of the different asymmetry associated with various interplay between the light-crossing, particle acceleration and cooling timescales. The source also frequently exhibited two-peak flares, to be triggered by the propagation of forward and reverse shocks after collision between the shells of high-energy plasma, moving with different speeds down the jet. The strongest long-term flaring activity was recorded during 2012 June - 2013 October and 2017 October - 2018 March, when the source was robustly detectable even on intraday timescales. We detected 25 instances of intraday variability and a large number of the flux doubling or halving instances. The source generally showed a lognormal variability in the LAT energy range, explained as an imprinting of the disc nonstationary processes on the jet, proton-initiated hadronic cascades or random fluctuations in the particle acceleration rate. Most of the 0.3-300 GeV spectra were well-fit with a simple power-law model and showed a very broad range of the photon-index from 2.8 down to 1.2, with the mean values of 1.75-1.84 and distribution peaks at 1.73-1.82 during the periods of strong activity. Our spectral study also revealed the features of inverse-Compton upscatter of X-ray photons in the Klein-Nishina regime, relativistic magnetic reconnection, first-order Fermi mechanism within the magnetic field of different confinement efficiencies and stochastic acceleration

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first brown dwarf spectral binary characterized with JWST: WISE J014656.66+423410.0, the coldest blended-light brown dwarf binary straddling the T/Y transition. We obtained a moderate resolution (R$\sim$2700) G395H spectrum of this unresolved binary with JWST/NIRSpec and we fit it to late-T and Y dwarf spectra from JWST/NIRSpec, and model spectra of comparable temperatures, both as individual spectra and pairs mimicking an unresolved binary system. We find that this tightly-separated binary is likely composed of two unequal-brightness sources with a magnitude difference of $0.50\pm0.08$ mag in IRAC [4.5] and a secondary $1.01\pm0.13$ mag redder than the primary in [3.6]-[4.5]. Despite the large color difference between the best fit primary and secondary, their temperature difference is only $92\pm23$\,K, a feature reminiscing of the L/T transition. Carbon disequilibrium chemistry strongly shapes the mid-infrared spectra of these sources, as a complex function of metallicity and surface gravity. While a larger library of JWST/NIRSpec spectra is needed to conclusively examine the peculiarities of blended-light sources, this spectral binary is a crucial pathfinder to both understand the spectral features of planetary-mass atmospheres and detect binarity in unresolved, moderate-resolution spectra of the coldest brown dwarfs.

 - **Abstract**
 Luminous broad H$\alpha$ emission and red rest-optical SEDs are the hallmark of compact Little Red Dots (LRDs), implying highly attenuated dusty starbursts and/or obscured active galactic nuclei. However, the lack of observed FIR emission has proved difficult to reconcile with the implied attenuated luminosity in these models. Here, we utilize deep new ALMA imaging, new and existing JWST/MIRI imaging, and archival Spitzer/Herschel imaging of two of the rest-optically brightest LRDs ($z=3.1$ and $z=4.47$) to place the strongest constraints on the IR luminosity in LRDs to date. The detections at $\lambda_\mathrm{rest}=1-4 \ \mu$m imply flat slopes in the rest-IR, ruling out a contribution from hot ($T\gtrsim500$ K) dust. Similarly, FIR non-detections rule out any appreciable cold ($T\lesssim75$ K) dust component. Assuming energy balance, these observations are inconsistent with the typical FIR dust emission of dusty starbursts and quasar torii, which usually show a mixture of cold and hot dust. Additionally, our [$\mathrm{C}_{II}$] non-detections rule out typical dusty starbursts. We compute empirical maximum IR SEDs and find that both LRDs must have $\log(L_\mathrm{IR}/L_\odot) \lesssim 12.2$ at the $3\sigma$ level. These limits are in tension with the predictions of rest-optical spectrophotometric fits, be they galaxy only, AGN only, or composite. It is unlikely that LRDs are highly dust-reddened intrinsically blue sources with a dust temperature distribution that conspires to avoid current observing facilities. Rather, we favor an intrinsically redder LRD SED model that alleviates the need for strong dust attenuation.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Transition disks (TDs) are a type of protoplanetary disk characterized by a central dust and gas cavity. The processes behind how these cavities are formed and maintained, along with their observed high accretion rates of $10^{-8} -10^{-7} \, M_{\odot} \, \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, continue to be subjects of active research. Aims. This work aims to investigate how the inclusion of the Hall effect (HE) alongside Ohmic resistivity (OR) and ambipolar diffusion (AD) affects the structure of the TD. Of key interest is the dynamical evolution of the cavity and whether it can indeed produce transonic accretion, as predicted by theoretical models in order to account for the observed high accretion rates despite the inner disk's low density. Methods. We present our results of 2D axisymmetric global radiation magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of TDs for which all three non-ideal MHD effects are accounted. We used the NIRVANA-III fluid code and initialized our model with a disk cavity reaching up to $R=8~\mathrm{au}$ with a density contrast of $10^5$. We performed three runs, one with only OR and AD, and one for each of the two configurations that arise when additionally including the HE, that is, with the field aligned (anti-aligned) with respect to the rotation axis. Results. For all three runs, our models maintain an intact inner cavity and an outer standard disk. MHD winds are launched both from the cavity and from the disk. Notably, when the HE is included, ring-like structures develop within the cavity. We moreover obtain accretion rates of $3 - 8 \times 10^{-8} \, M_{\odot} \, \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, comparable to typical values seen in full disks. Importantly, we clearly observe transonic accretion ($v_{\mathrm{acc}} \gtrsim c_{s}$) in the cavity. Additionally, outward magnetic flux transport occurs in all three runs.

 - **Abstract**
 Given recent X-ray observations of high-redshift active galactic nuclei (AGNs), we consider whether the extreme luminosities of these AGNs are consistent with current semi-analytical models. In particular, we apply extreme-value statistics (EVS) to obtain predictions of extreme X-ray luminosities of AGNs in the redshift range $3\lesssim z\lesssim 6$. We apply this formalism using different X-ray luminosity functions and compare the predicted extreme luminosities to AGNs in the Stripe-82 X-ray catalogue. We find a general consistency between data and the EVS predictions although there is some tension with certain luminosity functions. In addition, the extreme X-ray luminosities are found to be at least an order of magnitude below the Eddington luminosity limit. We discuss possible extensions to this model, including extrapolating our results to even higher redshifts ($z\gtrsim10$) where AGNs have recently been observed.

 - **Abstract**
 This report presents the findings of a NIAC Phase I feasibility study for the Artemis-enabled Stellar Imager (AeSI), a proposed high-resolution, UV/Optical interferometer designed for deployment on the lunar surface. Its primary science goal is to image the surfaces and interiors of stars with unprecedented detail, revealing new details about their magnetic processes and dynamic evolution and enabling the creation of a truly predictive solar/stellar dynamo model. This capability will transform our understanding of stellar physics and has broad applicability across astrophysics, from resolving the cores of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) to studying supernovae, planetary nebulae, and the late stages of stellar evolution. By leveraging the stable vacuum environment of the Moon and the infrastructure being established for the Artemis Program, AeSI presents a compelling case for a lunar-based interferometer. In this study, the AeSI Team, working with the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center's Integrated Design Center (IDC), has firmly established the feasibility of building and operating a reconfigurable, dispersed aperture telescope (i.e., an interferometer) on the lunar surface. The collaboration produced a credible Baseline design featuring 15 primary mirrors arranged in an elliptical array with a 1 km major axis, with the potential to expand to 30 mirrors and larger array sizes through staged deployments. Additionally, this study identified numerous opportunities for optimization and the necessary trade studies to refine the design further. These will be pursued in follow-up investigations, such as a NIAC Phase II study, to advance the concept toward implementation.

 - **Abstract**
 Gas-phase metallicity in interacting and merging galaxies offers key insights into their star formation processes and evolutionary histories. This study investigates the spatial evolution of gas-phase metallicity (i.e, oxygen abundance, 12 $+$ log(O/H)) in these galaxies using integral field unit (IFU) data from the SDSS-IV MaNGA survey, focusing on changes in metallicity gradients across different stages of interactions -- from early encounters to final coalescence. By comparing interacting and merging galaxies with isolated counterparts, we identify characteristic trends in how interactions influence metallicity gradients over time. Our analysis reveals that metallicity gradients typically flatten shortly after the first pericenter passage, likely due to radial gas mixing, with later stages showing either metallicity enrichment or dilution depending on the intensity of the interaction and star formation activity. These changes can result in gradients that are either flatter or steeper than the initial profiles. Notably, we observe steeper metallicity gradients in interacting galaxies at certain merger stages, which is inconsistent with predictions from some galaxy simulations. This discrepancy emphasizes the complexity of galaxy interactions. Overall, our findings provide valuable insights into how galaxy interactions reshape metallicity distribution, enhancing our understanding of the processes driving galaxy evolution during mergers.

 - **Abstract**
 We present "augustus", a catalog of distance, extinction, and stellar parameter estimates to 170 million stars from $14\,{\rm mag} < r < 20\,{\rm mag}$ and with $|b| > 10^\circ$ drawing on a combination of optical to near-IR photometry from Pan-STARRS, 2MASS, UKIDSS, and unWISE along with parallax measurements from \textit{Gaia} DR2 and 3-D dust extinction maps. After applying quality cuts, we find 125 million objects have "high-quality" posteriors with statistical distance uncertainties of $\lesssim 10\%$ for objects with well-constrained stellar types. This is a substantial improvement over distance estimates derived from Gaia parallaxes alone and in line with results from previous work. We find the fits are able to accurately reproduce the de-reddened Gaia color-magnitude diagram, which serves as a useful consistency check of our results. We show that we are able to clearly detect large, kinematically-coherent substructures in our data relative to the input priors, including the Monoceros Ring and the Sagittarius stream, attesting to the quality of the catalog. Our results are publicly available at doi:https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/WYMSXV. An accompanying interactive visualization can be found at this http URL.

 - **Abstract**
 We present extensive optical observations of a nearby Type Ia supernova (SN Ia), SN 2021hpr, located in the spiral galaxy NGC 3147 at a distance of $\sim$ 45 Mpc. Our observations cover a phase within $\sim 1-2$ days to $\sim 290$ days after the explosion. SN 2021hpr is found to be a spectroscopically normal SN Ia, with an absolute B-band peak magnitude of $M_{max}(B) \approx -19.16 \pm 0.14$ mag and a post-peak decline rate of $\Delta m_{15}(B)= 1.00 \pm 0.01 $ mag. Early-time light curves showed a $\sim 7.0 \%$ excess emission compared to a homogeneously expanding fireball model, likely due to SN ejecta interacting with a companion or immediate circumstellar matter. The optical spectra of SN 2021hpr are overall similar to those of normal SNe Ia, but characterized by prominent detached high-velocity features (HVFs) of Si {\sc ii} and Ca {\sc ii} in the early phase. After examining a small sample of well-observed normal SNe Ia, we find that the HVFs are likely common for the subgroup with early-excess emission. The association of early bump feature with the HVFs could be attributed to density or abundance enhancement at the outer layer of the exploding star, likely as a result of interactions with companion$/$CSM or experiencing more complete burning. Nevertheless, the redshifted Fe {\sc ii} and Ni {\sc ii} lines in the nebular-phase spectra of SN 2021hpr, contrary to the blueshift trend seen in other SNe Ia showing early bump features, indicate its peculiarity in the explosion that remains to be understood.

 - **Abstract**
 Accretion supermassive black holes in the center of active galaxies usually produce ``jets''-collimated bipolar outflows of relativistic particles. Magnetic fields near the black hole event horizon may play a crucial role in the formation of jets/outflows. Both theory and observation indicate that jets/outflows driven by centrally active supermassive black holes (SMBHs) have a feedback effect on the overall properties of the host galaxies. Therefore, the magnetic field is a key ingredient for the formation and evolution of galaxies. Here we report a clear correlation between the magnetic field of jets and star formation rate (SFR) for a large sample of 96 galaxies hosting supermassive black holes, which suggests that the star formation of active galactic nuclei (AGN) host galaxies may be powered by the jets.

 - **Abstract**
 LOFAR is a low-frequency array distributed across several European countries. Each LOFAR station contains thousands of antennas and associated electronics, making monitoring and thorough testing of those components essential to ensuring station reliability. This paper discusses various anomalies that may arise in LOFAR antennas, tile elements, modems, and summators. We also introduce two diagnostic pipelines designed to detect these anomalies: a real-time station monitoring system and an offline stationtest system. These pipelines provide valuable insights into the operational status of each antenna, issuing alerts to minimize observational disruptions while maximizing station uptime, reliability, and sensitivity. By enhancing the efficiency and stability of LOFAR stations, they also serve as a foundation for future large-scale arrays like SKA-Low. The experience gained from their development and deployment will contribute to the construction and maintenance of SKA-Low, improving monitoring and diagnostic capabilities for large-scale antenna networks. Ultimately, these systems play a crucial role in ensuring continuous observations and maintaining data integrity.

 - **Abstract**
 We obtained high spectral resolution spectra ($\Delta v$ $\sim$ 2.5 km s$^{-1}$) for DG Tau A from 4800 Å to 7500 Å using Subaru High Dispersion Spectrograph (HDS) for the first time. The low-velocity components (LVCs, |$v$| < 100 km s$^{-1}$) were observed in the [O I] 5577, 6300, 6364 Å, [S II] 6716, 6731 Å lines. The offset position spectra observed in the LVCs show a "negative velocity gradient", supporting the presence of a wide-angled wind associated with the LVC emission. The offset position spectra observed in a component within the LVC velocity range between -16 km s$^{-1}$ to -41 km s$^{-1}$, namely, LVC-M, show a "negative velocity gradient'', supporting the presence of a wide-angled wind. With 12-70 au wind lengths measured using spectroastrometry, we estimate a lower limit to the wind mass-loss rate of $\sim$10$^{-8}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. In addition to the LVCs, we identify two high-velocity components (HVCs, |$v$| > 100 km s$^{-1}$) associated with the collimated jet in 26 lines ([N I], [N II], [O I], [O II], [O III], [S II], [Ca II], [Fe II], H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, He I). The one with a clear spatial offset from the star ($n_e$ $\sim$10$^4$ cm$^{-3}$, HVC1) is associated with an internal shock surface of the jet, while the other at the base ($n_e$ $\sim$10$^6$ cm$^{-3}$, HVC2) may be a stationary shock component. We find that the observed line profiles and the spatial scales of the LVC emission do not agree with the existing predictions for photoevaporative or magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) disk winds. These could be explained by the X-wind model, but synthetic observations are required for detailed comparisons.

 - **Abstract**
 Galactic chemical abundances provide crucial insights into fundamental galactic parameters, such as the high-mass slope of the initial mass function (IMF) and the normalization of Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) rates. Constraining these parameters is essential for advancing our understanding of stellar feedback, metal enrichment, and galaxy formation processes. However, traditional Bayesian inference techniques, such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), are computationally prohibitive when applied to large datasets of modern stellar surveys. We leverage simulation-based-inference (SBI) as a scalable, robust, and efficient method for constraining galactic parameters from stellar chemical abundances and demonstrate its the advantages over HMC in terms of speed, scalability, and robustness against model misspecifications. We combine a Galactic Chemical Evolution (GCE) model, CHEMPY, with a neural network emulator and a Neural Posterior Estimator (NPE) to train our SBI pipeline. Mock datasets are generated using CHEMPY, including scenarios with mismatched nucleosynthetic yields, with additional tests conducted on data from a simulated Milky Way-like galaxy. SBI results are benchmarked against HMC-based inference, focusing on computational performance, accuracy, and resilience to systematic discrepancies. SBI achieves a $\sim75,600\times$ speed-up compared to HMC, reducing inference runtime from $\gtrsim42$ hours to mere seconds for thousands of stars. Inference on $1,000$ stars yields precise estimates for the IMF slope ($\alpha_{\rm IMF} = -2.298 \pm 0.002$) and SN Ia normalization ($\log_{10}(N_{\rm Ia}) = -2.885 \pm 0.003$), deviating less than 0.05% from the ground truth. SBI also demonstrates similar robustness to model misspecification than HMC, recovering accurate parameters even with alternate yield tables or data from a cosmological simulation. (shortened...)
#### The kinematic contribution to the cosmic number count dipole

 - **Abstract**
 Measurements of the number count dipole with large surveys have shown amplitudes in tension with kinematic predictions based on the observed Doppler dipole of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). These observations seem to be in direct conflict with a homogeneous and isotropic Universe as asserted by the cosmological principle, demanding further investigation into the origin of the tension. Here, we investigate whether the observed number count dipoles are consistent with being fully kinematic or if there is any residual anisotropy contributing to the total observed dipole. To disentangle these contributions, we aim to leverage the fact that the kinematic matter dipole expected in a given galaxy catalogue scales with observed properties of the sample, and different catalogues used in the literature therefore have different kinematic dipole expectations. We here perform joint dipole fits using the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS), the Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey (RACS), and the AGN catalogue derived from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (CatWISE). Assuming a common kinematic and non-kinematic dipole component between all catalogues, we find that a large residual, non-kinematic dipole anisotropy is detected, though a common direction between the two components is disfavoured by model selection. Freeing up both amplitude and direction for this residual dipole while fixing the kinematic dipole to the CMB dipole expectation, we recover a significant residual dipole with $\mathcal{D}_{resid} = (0.81\pm0.14)\times10^{-2}$, that is offset from the CMB dipole direction by $39\pm8$ degrees. While the present work provides a valuable first test of this concept, its scrutinising power is limited by the currently employed catalogues. Larger catalogues, especially in radio, will be needed to further lift the degeneracy between the kinematic and residual dipole components.

 - **Abstract**
 X-rays provide a robust method in identifying AGN. However, in the high-redshift Universe, their space density is relatively low, and, in combination with the small areas covered by X-ray surveys, the selected AGN are poorly sampled. Deep optical/infrared data are essential for locating counterparts and determining redshifts. In this work, we leverage the XMM-Newton 4XMM-DR11 serendipitous catalogue alongside the extensive optical Dark Energy Survey and the near-infrared VISTA Hemisphere Survey (VHS) to select one of the largest high-z X-ray AGN samples to date. Our analysis focuses on the overlapping area of these surveys, covering about 185 $deg^2$. In addition, we aspire to compare the properties of the X-ray AGN with the optically-selected QSOs. For sources without spectroscopic data (80%), we estimated the photometric redshifts using both SED fitting and machine-learning algorithms. Among the 65,000 X-ray sources in the 4XMM-DES-VHS area, we ended up with 833 z>3.5 AGN (11% having spec-z information) with high reliability and a fraction of outliers {\eta}<10%. The sample completeness is 90%, driven by the depth of DES data. Only 10% of the X-ray selected AGN are also optical QSOs and vice versa. Our findings indicate an observed absorbed fraction ($\log N_H~[cm^{-2}] \geq 23$) of 20-40% for the X-ray AGN, significantly higher than that of optical QSOs. X-ray AGN exhibit fainter observed optical magnitudes and brighter mid-IR magnitudes than optical QSOs. Their median rest-frame SED shapes differ notably with optical QSOs being dominated by AGN emission in the UV-optical wavelengths. While the median SEDs of X-ray AGN suggest extinction in the UV-optical range, individual sources exhibit a wide range of spectral shapes, indicating significant diversity within the population. This analysis supports that X-ray and optically-selected AGN represent distinct and complementary populations.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on multiwavelength observations of FRB 20240114A, a nearby (z=0.13), hyperactive, repeating fast radio burst that was discovered in January 2024. We performed simultaneous observations of the source with the Effelsberg 100-m radio telescope, the Thai National Radio Telescope, the Astropeiler Stockert, and the X-ray satellite XMM-Newton in May 2024. On May 23, 2024, we detected 459 bursts from the source using the Ultra-Broad-Band (UBB) receiver of the Effelsberg telescope, covering a frequency range from 1.3 GHz to 6 GHz. All bursts have simultaneous X-ray coverage, which allows us to put stringent constraints on the X-ray-to-radio fluence ratio, $\eta_{x/r}$, of FRB 20240114A. In this work, we focus on the three brightest radio bursts detected during the campaign. The brightest burst exhibits a radio fluence of $1.4\times 10^{-17}$ erg cm$^{-2}$, while the $3\sigma$ upper limit of the 0.2$-$12 keV absorption-corrected X-ray burst fluence lies in the range of $3.4\times 10^{-11}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ to $1.7\times 10^{-10}$ erg cm$^{-2}$, depending on the spectral model. Assuming a 10 keV black-body spectrum, the X-ray-to-radio fluence ratio can be constrained to $\eta_{x/r}<1.2\times10^{7}$. A cutoff power law ($\Gamma=1.56$, cutoff at 84 keV) is also considered, physically motivated by the Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154, which has previously shown X-ray bursts associated with FRB-like radio bursts at a measured X-ray-to-radio fluence ratio of $\eta_{x/r}\sim2.5\times 10^{5}$ (1$-$250 keV). In this scenario, we find that $\eta_{x/r}<2.4\times 10^6$. Our results are consistent with FRB 20240114A being powered by a mechanism similar to that of SGR 1935+2154. We show that future multiwavelength campaigns will be able to improve this limit if sufficiently bright radio bursts are observed with simultaneous X-ray coverage.

 - **Abstract**
 There is evidence that stars and browns dwarfs grow through episodic rather than continuous gas accretion. However, the role of episodic accretion in the formation of brown dwarfs remains mostly unexplored. We investigate the role of episodic accretion, triggered by the magnetorotational instability in the inner disk regions, resulting in episodic outbursts during the formation of brown dwarfs, and its implications for their early formation stages. We use hydrodynamical simulations coupled with a sub-grid accretion model to investigate the formation of young proto-brown dwarfs and protostars, taking into account the effects of episodic accretion resulting in episodic radiative feedback, i.e. in luminosity outbursts. The formation timescale for proto brown dwarfs is at least one order of magnitude shorter than that of protostars. Episodic accretion leads to a shorter main accretion phase compared to continuous accretion in brown dwarfs, whereas the opposite is true for low-mass stars. Episodic accretion can accelerate early mass accretion in proto-brown dwarfs and protostars, but it results in less massive objects by the end of the main phase compared to continuous accretion. We find an approximately linear correlation between an object's mass at the end of the main accretion phase and the timing of the last episodic outburst: later events result in more massive brown dwarfs but less massive low-mass stars. Episodic outbursts have a stronger effect on brown dwarf-forming cloud cores, with the last outburst essentially splitting the brown dwarf evolution into a short high-accretion and a much longer low-accretion phase.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a deep, high-angular resolution 3D dust map of the southern Galactic plane over $239^\circ < \ell < 6^\circ$ and $|b| < 10^\circ$ built on photometry from the DECaPS2 survey, in combination with photometry from VVV, 2MASS, and unWISE and parallaxes from Gaia DR3 where available. To construct the map, we first infer the distance, extinction, and stellar types of over 700 million stars using the brutus stellar inference framework with a set of theoretical MIST stellar models. Our resultant 3D dust map has an angular resolution of $1'$, roughly an order of magnitude finer than existing 3D dust maps and comparable to the angular resolution of the Herschel 2D dust emission maps. We detect complexes at the range of distances associated with the Sagittarius-Carina and Scutum-Centaurus arms in the fourth quadrant, as well as more distant structures out to a maximum reliable distance of $d \approx$ 10 kpc from the Sun. The map is sensitive up to a maximum extinction of roughly $A_V \approx 12$ mag. We publicly release both the stellar catalog and the 3D dust map, the latter of which can easily be queried via the Python package dustmaps. When combined with the existing Bayestar19 3D dust map of the northern sky, the DECaPS 3D dust map fills in the missing piece of the Galactic plane, enabling extinction corrections over the entire disk $|b| < 10^\circ$. Our map serves as a pathfinder for the future of 3D dust mapping in the era of LSST and Roman, targeting regimes accessible with deep optical and near-infrared photometry but often inaccessible with Gaia.

 - **Abstract**
 Multiple active galactic nuclei (multi-AGN) are a known result of galaxy mergers. Therefore, they are an important tool for studying the formation and dynamical evolution of galaxies and supermassive black holes (SMBHs). A novel method for the selection of multi-AGN leverages the exquisite positional accuracy of Gaia to detect astrometrically-variable quasars. Previous work has paired this method with radio interferometry on sub-arcsecond scales. In this paper, we present a follow-up study of seven astrometrically-variable quasars from the pilot sample using the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA). We targeted these seven quasars with the VLBA at 2.0-2.4 GHz (S-band) and 8.0-8.4 GHz (X-band), reaching milliarcsecond resolutions, in order to study the radio properties at smaller scales and to constrain the origin of the astrometric variability. The new observations are also used to identify significant radio-optical offsets in all seven objects, suggesting that many astrometrically-variable quasars also exhibit significant radio-optical offsets. We find that four of the seven sources are possible candidate multi-AGN based on their radio properties and radio-optical offsets. Overall, we use this follow-up study to constrain the smaller-scale radio properties of this sample of astrometrically-variable quasars, and continue to explore the use of this method in the field of multi-AGN.
#### Early-Type Galaxies: Elliptical and S0 Galaxies, or Fast and Slow Rotators

 - **Abstract**
 Early-type galaxies (ETGs) show a bimodal distribution in key structural properties like stellar specific angular momentum, kinematic morphology, and nuclear surface brightness profiles. Slow rotator ETGs, mostly found in the densest regions of galaxy clusters, become common when the stellar mass exceeds a critical value of around $M_*^\mathrm{crit}\approx2\times 10^{11}\,M_\odot$, or more precisely when $\lg(R_\mathrm{e}/\mathrm{kpc}) \gtrsim 12.4 - \lg(M_*/M_\odot)$. These galaxies have low specific angular momentum, spheroidal shapes, and stellar populations that are old, metal-rich, and $\alpha$-enhanced. In contrast, fast rotator ETGs form a continuous sequence of properties with spiral galaxies. In these galaxies, the age, metallicity, and $\alpha$-enhancement of the stellar population correlate best with the effective stellar velocity dispersion $\sigma_\mathrm{e} \propto \sqrt{M_*/R_\mathrm{e}}$ (i.e., properties are similar for $R_\mathrm{e}\propto M_*$), or with proxies approximating their bulge mass fraction. This sequence spans from star-forming spiral disks to quenched, passive, spheroid-dominated fast rotator ETGs. Notably, at a fixed $\sigma_\mathrm{e}$, younger galaxies show lower metallicity. The structural differences and environmental distributions of ETGs suggest two distinct formation pathways: slow rotators undergo early intense star formation followed by rapid quenching via their dark halos and supermassive black holes, and later evolve through dry mergers during hierarchical cluster assembly; fast rotators, on the other hand, develop more gradually through gas accretion and minor mergers, becoming quenched by internal feedback above a characteristic $\lg(\mathrm{\sigma_e^{crit}}/\text{ km s}^{-1})\gtrsim2.3$ (in the local Universe) or due to environmental effects.
#### An SS433 flare caught by TESS. Fast rise times and evidence for a 13 hours quasi-period

 - **Abstract**
 SS433 is an exotic Galactic microquasar in which there is a supercritical inflow of matter into a compact object of likely black hole nature. Here I report on an SS433 flare that occurred during a TESS observation of Sector 54 in June of 2022. The flare lasted for about 10 days and culminated in a flux increase by a factor of three relative to quiescence. The unprecedented continuous photometric coverage of the flare afforded by TESS shows that the flux can rise and fall by up to a factor of two within 4 to 7 hours. Furthermore, there is evidence that the flare peaks occur with a quasi-period $P_{\mathrm{QPO}} = 13.3$ hours. The flare can be most naturally explained by accretion rate ($\dot{M}$) variations due to oscillations in the donor star mass loss rate. We estimate $\dot{M}$ variations up to a factor of two with an increase in the photospheric radius of the accretion disk by about the same factor, implying that a transient ``common envelope'' enshrouds the binary system during the flares. If the flares are due to radial pulsations in the donor star envelope then their quasi-period $P_{\mathrm{QPO}}$ could imply a mean density $\left < \rho \right > \sim 18 \text{ kg} \text{ m}^{-3}$ for the donor star, compared to $\left < \rho_{\mathrm{RL}} \right > = 0.7-1 \text{ kg} \text{ m}^{-3}$ for a synchronized Roche-lobe filling donor star. Another SS433 lightcurve from a Sector 80 TESS observation in 2024 hints that there may be an outflow from behind the the donor star.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Compared to Class 0 protostars, the higher densities and lower temperatures of the disk midplanes of Class I young stellar objects (YSOs) limit the detectability of complex organic molecules (COMs). The elevated luminosities of eruptive YSOs increase disk temperatures sublimating frozen molecules and easing their detection. Aims: Our aim is to investigate the chemical composition of four FUor-like Class I YSOs: L1551 IRS 5, Haro 5a IRS, V346 Nor, and OO Ser, and to compare their abundances of COMs with other YSOs in the literature. Methods: We search for COMs line emission in ALMA Band 6 observations. We use the CASSIS software to determine their column densities (N) and excitation temperatures (T_ex) assuming local thermodynamical equilibrium. Results: We detect 249 transitions from 12 COMs. In L1551 IRS 5 we identified CH3OH, 13CH3OH, CH318OH, CH2DOH, CH3CHO, CH3OCH3, CH3OCHO, CH3COCH3, C2H5OH, C2H5CN, 13CH3CN, and CH3C15)N. Haro 5a IRS and OO Ser have emission from CH3OH, CH3CHO, CH3OCH3, and CH3OCHO. CH3COCH3 is also detected in OO Ser. In V346 Nor we found CH3OH, CH2DOH, CH3CHO, CH3OCH3, CH3OCHO, and C2H5CN. The emission of COMs is compact in all targets. The analysis indicates their temperatures are above 100K. The abundance ratios of COMs derived for these eruptive YSOs, as well as for other protostars in the literature, span several orders of magnitude without any clear differentiation between the eruptive and quiescent YSOs. The column density of the main isotopologue of CH3OH should not be used as a reference, as most of the lines are optically thick. Conclusions: The hot and compact emission of COMs indicates that the four FUor-like targets are hot corino-like. Spectral studies of such objects can be useful to investigate the complex organic chemistry at later evolutionary stages than the usual Class 0 stage.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Radiation plays a significant role in solar and astrophysical environments as it may constitute a sizeable fraction of the energy density, momentum flux, and the total pressure. Modelling the dynamic interaction between radiation and magnetized plasmas in such environments is an intricate and computationally costly task. Aims. The goal of this work is to demonstrate the capabilities of the open-source parallel, block-adaptive computational framework MPI-AMRVAC, in solving equations of radiation-magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD), and to present benchmark test cases relevant for radiation-dominated magnetized plasmas. Methods. The existing magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and flux-limited diffusion (FLD) radiative-hydrodynamics physics modules are combined to solve the equations of radiation-magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) on block-adaptive finite volume Cartesian meshes in any dimensionality. Results. We introduce and validate several benchmark test cases such as steady radiative MHD shocks, radiation-damped linear MHD waves, radiation-modified Riemann problems and a multi-dimensional radiative magnetoconvection case. We recall the basic governing Rankine-Hugoniot relations for shocks and the dispersion relation for linear MHD waves in the presence of optically thick radiation fields where the diffusion limit is reached. The RMHD system allows for 8 linear wave types, where the classical 7-wave MHD picture (entropy and three wave pairs for slow, Alfven and fast) is augmented with a radiative diffusion mode. Conclusions. The MPI-AMRVAC code now has the capability to perform multidimensional RMHD simulations with mesh adaptation making it well-suited for larger scientific applications to study magnetized matter-radiation interactions in solar and stellar interiors and atmospheres.

 - **Abstract**
 A proposed Vera C. Rubin Observatory Deep Drilling micro-survey of the Kuiper Belt will investigate key properties of the distant solar system. Utilizing 30 hours of Rubin time across six 5-hour visits over one year starting in summer 2026, the survey aims to discover and determine orbits for up to 730 Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs) to an $r$-magnitude of 27.5. These discoveries will enable precise characterization of the KBO size distribution, which is critical for understanding planetesimal formation. By aligning the survey field with NASA's {\it New Horizons} spacecraft trajectory, the micro-survey will facilitate discoveries for the mission operating in the Kuiper Belt. Modeling based on the Outer Solar System Origin Survey (OSSOS) predicts at least 12 distant KBOs observable with the {\it New Horizons} LOng Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI) and approximately three objects within 1~au of the spacecraft, allowing higher-resolution observations than Earth-based facilities. LORRI's high solar phase angle monitoring will reveal these objects' surface properties and shapes, potentially identifying contact binaries and orbit-class surface correlations. The survey could identify a KBO suitable for a future spacecraft flyby. The survey's size, depth, and cadence design will deliver transformative measurements of the Kuiper Belt's size distribution and rotational properties across distance, size, and orbital class. Additionally, the high stellar density in the survey field also offers synergies with transiting exoplanet studies.
