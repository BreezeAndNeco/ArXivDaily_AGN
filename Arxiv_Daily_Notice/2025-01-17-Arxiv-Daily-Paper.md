 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy groups with $M_{tot} \lesssim 10^{14}$ $M_\odot$ and up to a few tens of members are the most common galaxy environment, marking the transition between field and massive clusters. Identifying groups plays a crucial role in understanding structure formation and galaxy evolution. Modern deep surveys allow us to build well-characterized samples of groups up to the regime where structures were taking shape. We aimed to build the largest deep catalog of galaxy groups to date over the COSMOS-Web field effective area of 0.45 deg$^2$, leveraging the deep high quality data of the new COSMOS-Web photometric catalog resulted from the James Webb Space Telescope observations of the COSMOS-Web field. We performed the group search with the AMICO algorithm, a linear matched filter based on an analytical model for the group signal. AMICO has already been tested in wide and deep field surveys, including COSMOS data up to $z=2$. In this work, we tested the algorithm performances at even higher redshift and searched for protocluster cores at $z>2$. We compiled a list of known protoclusters in COSMOS at $2 \leq z \leq 3.7$, matched them with our detections and studied the clustering of the detected cores. We estimated purity and completeness of our sample by creating data-driven mocks with the SinFoniA code and linked signal-to-noise to purity. We detected 1678 groups in the COSMOS-Web field up to $z=3.7$, including lists of members extending nearly two magnitudes deeper than the previous AMICO-COSMOS catalog. 756 groups were detected with purity of 80\%. More than 500 groups have their redshift confirmed by assigning spectroscopic counterparts. This group catalog offers a unique opportunity to explore galaxy evolution in different environments spanning $\sim$12 Gyr and to study groups, from the least rich population to the formation of the most massive clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 We use NIRSpec MSA spectroscopy and NIRCam Photometry to explore the properties of JADES-GS8-RL-1, a rapidly quenched, $z=8.5$ galaxy with a stellar mass of $10^{8.9}M_\odot$, a steep blue UV slope, a Balmer break, and no sign of strong emission lines. With a $\beta_{UV}$=-2.8$\pm 0.2$, as measured from the NIRSpec spectrum, JADES-GS8-RL-1 is consistent with negligible dust attenuation and little to no contribution from the nebular continuum alongside a probable high escape fraction. The $\beta_{UV}$ slope measured from photometry varies from -3.0 in the central regions to -2.2 at the outskirts suggesting possible regional differences in the escape fraction. There are no high-ionisation emission lines, only a tentative 2.9\sig detection of [OII]. Using photometry, this emission appears to be extended, possibly corresponding to weakly ionised gas expelled during or after the quenching process. JADES-GS8-RL-1 is spatially resolved with a half-light radius of 240 pc and has an exponential, disc-like morphology. It appears to have formed all its stars in a short burst within the past 100 Myr with a formation time of $\approx$70 Myr and a quenching time of $\approx$30 Myr. This quenching would have occurred rapidly, making it a more distant example of the kind of low-mass "mini-quenched" galaxies previously observed at high-z. Due to the extremely blue $\beta_{UV}$ slope, our best-fit model predicts a high value for \fesc of >10\%, consistent with the value derived from the $\beta_{UV}$ slope, which when combined with our extraordinarily low O32 upper limit suggests JADES-GS8-RL-1 is a fascinating example of a high-z "remnant leaker" in one of its earliest phases, deep in the epoch of reionisation.

 - **Abstract**
 GX 339$-$4 is one of the prototypical black hole X-ray transients, exhibiting recurrent outbursts that allow detailed studies of black hole accretion and ejection phenomena. In this work we present four epochs of optical and near-infrared spectroscopy obtained with X-shooter at the Very Large Telescope. The dataset includes two hard state spectra, collected during the 2013 and 2015 outbursts, and two soft state spectra observed during the 2021 outburst. Strong Balmer, Paschen, He I and He II emission lines are consistently observed in all spectra, while Brackett transitions and the Bowen blend are only prominent in the soft state. Although P-Cygni profiles are not identified, the presence of wind signatures, such as extended emission wings, flat-top and asymmetric red-skewed profiles, is consistently observed through most emission lines, suggesting the presence of wind-type ejecta. These features are particularly evident in the hard state, but they are also observed in the soft state, especially in the near-infrared. This strengthens the case for state-independent winds in black hole transients and increases the evidence for wind signatures in low-to-intermediate orbital inclination systems. We also study the spectral energy distribution, which provides evidence for the presence of synchrotron emission during the hard state. The jet significantly affects the near-infrared continuum, greatly diluting the emission features produced in the accretion flow. The simultaneous identification of both jet and wind signatures during the hard state reinforces the idea of a complex outflow scenario, in which different types of ejecta coexist.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) often display coincident absorption from species with widely varying ionization states, providing direct evidence for complex, multiphase interactions. Motivated by these measurements, we perform a series of cloud-crushing simulations that model cold clouds traveling through the hot CGM. We analyze the ion distributions of these clouds, generate mock absorption spectra, and study their implications on quasar (QSO) absorption observations. Our results show interesting multiphase features, in which ions with significantly different ionization potentials exist in the same absorber and share similar spectral features. However, our simulations are unable to explain high ions like O \textsc{vi} and their coexistence with lower ions that appear in many observed QSO absorption systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of massive supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the early universe challenge existing black hole formation models. We propose that soliton cores in fuzzy dark matter (FDM) offer a potential solution to this timing problem. Our FDM cosmological zoom-in simulations confirm that for a particle mass $m_{\rm FDM}\sim 10^{-22}~{\rm eV}$, solitons are well developed at redshift $z \sim 7$ with masses of $\sim10^9~M_\odot$, comparable to the observed SMBHs. We then demonstrate using hydrodynamic simulations that, compared to cold dark matter, these high-$z$ massive FDM solitons with mass $M_s$ can provide additional gravitational potential to accrete gas and boost the Bondi accretion rate of a growing black hole seed with mass $M_{\rm BH}$ by up to two to four orders of magnitude, in the regime of efficient cooling and negligible radiation pressure. This accretion boosting mechanism is effective for $10^{-22}~{\rm eV} \lesssim m_{\rm FDM} \lesssim 10^{-20}~{\rm eV}$ and potentially beyond as long as $M_s > M_{\rm BH}$.

 - **Abstract**
 We present Mantis Shrimp, a multi-survey deep learning model for photometric redshift estimation that fuses ultra-violet (GALEX), optical (PanSTARRS), and infrared (UnWISE) imagery. Machine learning is now an established approach for photometric redshift estimation, with generally acknowledged higher performance in areas with a high density of spectroscopically identified galaxies over template-based methods. Multiple works have shown that image-based convolutional neural networks can outperform tabular-based color/magnitude models. In comparison to tabular models, image models have additional design complexities: it is largely unknown how to fuse inputs from different instruments which have different resolutions or noise properties. The Mantis Shrimp model estimates the conditional density estimate of redshift using cutout images. The density estimates are well calibrated and the point estimates perform well in the distribution of available spectroscopically confirmed galaxies with (bias = 1e-2), scatter (NMAD = 2.44e-2) and catastrophic outlier rate ($\eta$=17.53$\%$). We find that early fusion approaches (e.g., resampling and stacking images from different instruments) match the performance of late fusion approaches (e.g., concatenating latent space representations), so that the design choice ultimately is left to the user. Finally, we study how the models learn to use information across bands, finding evidence that our models successfully incorporates information from all surveys. The applicability of our model to the analysis of large populations of galaxies is limited by the speed of downloading cutouts from external servers; however, our model could be useful in smaller studies such as generating priors over redshift for stellar population synthesis.

 - **Abstract**
 Long-period radio transients are a novel class of astronomical objects characterised by prolonged periods ranging from 18 minutes to 54 minutes. They exhibit highly polarised, coherent, beamed radio emission lasting only 10--100 seconds. The intrinsic nature of these objects is subject to speculation, with highly magnetised white dwarfs and neutron stars being the prevailing candidates. Here we present ASKAP J183950.5-075635.0 (hereafter, ASKAP J1839-0756), boasting the longest known period of this class at 6.45 hours. It exhibits emission characteristics of an ordered dipolar magnetic field, with pulsar-like bright main pulses and weaker interpulses offset by about half a period are indicative of an oblique or orthogonal rotator. This phenomenon, observed for the first time in a long-period radio transient, confirms that the radio emission originates from both magnetic poles and that the observed period corresponds to the rotation period. The spectroscopic and polarimetric properties of ASKAP J1839-0756 are consistent with a neutron star origin, and this object is a crucial piece of evidence in our understanding of long-period radio sources and their links to neutron stars.
#### Direct evidence for $r$-process nucleosynthesis in delayed MeV emission from the SGR 1806-20 magnetar giant flare

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of heavy elements synthesized through the rapid neutron capture process ($r$-process) has been an enduring mystery for over half a century. Cehula et al. (2024) recently showed that magnetar giant flares, among the brightest transients ever observed, can shock-heat and eject neutron star crustal material at high velocity, achieving the requisite conditions for an $r$-process. Patel et al. (in prep.) confirmed an $r$-process in these ejecta using detailed nucleosynthesis calculations. Radioactive decay of the freshly synthesized nuclei releases a forest of gamma-ray lines, Doppler broadened by the high ejecta velocities $v \gtrsim 0.1c$ into a quasi-continuous spectrum peaking around 1 MeV. Here, we show that the predicted emission properties (light-curve, fluence, and spectrum) match a previously unexplained hard gamma-ray signal seen in the aftermath of the famous December 2004 giant flare from the magnetar SGR 1806-20. This MeV emission component, rising to peak around 10 minutes after the initial spike before decaying away over the next few hours, is direct observational evidence for the synthesis of $\sim 10^{-6}M_{\odot}$ of $r$-process elements. The discovery of magnetar giant flares as confirmed $r$-process sites, contributing at least $\sim 1$-$10\%$ of the total Galactic abundances, has implications for the Galactic chemical evolution, especially at the earliest epochs probed by low-metallicity stars. It also implicates magnetars as potentially dominant sources of heavy cosmic rays. Characterization of the $r$-process emission from giant flares by resolving decay line features offers a compelling science case for NASA's forthcoming COSI nuclear spectrometer, as well as next-generation MeV telescope missions.
#### XMM/HST monitoring of the ultra-soft highly accreting Narrow Line Seyfert 1 RBS 1332

 - **Abstract**
 Ultra-soft narrow line Seyfert 1 (US-NLSy) are a poorly observed class of active galactic nuclei characterized by significant flux changes and an extreme soft X-ray excess. This peculiar spectral shape represents a golden opportunity to test whether the standard framework commonly adopted for modelling local AGN is still valid. We thus present the results on the joint XMM-Newton and HST monitoring campaign of the highly accreting US-NLSy RBS 1332. The optical-to-UV spectrum of RBS 1332 exhibits evidence of both a stratified narrow-line region and an ionized outflow, that produces absorption troughs over a wide range of velocities (from ~1500 km s-1 to ~1700 km s-1) in several high-ionization transitions (Lyalpha, N V, C IV). From a spectroscopic point of view, the optical/UV/FUV/X-rays emission of this source is due to the superposition of three distinct components which are best modelled in the context of the two-coronae framework in which the radiation of RBS 1332 can be ascribed to a standard outer disk, a warm Comptonization region and a soft coronal continuum. The present dataset is not compatible with a pure relativistic reflection scenario. Finally, the adoption of the novel model reXcor allowed us to determine that the soft X-ray excess in RBS 1332 is dominated by the emission of the optically thick and warm Comptonizing medium, and only marginal contribution is expected from relativistic reflection from a lamppost-like corona.
#### A universal break in energy functions of three hyperactive repeating fast radio bursts

 - **Abstract**
 Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration pulses occurring at cosmological distances with a mysterious origin. Observations show that at least some FRBs are produced by magnetars. All magnetar-powered FRB models require some triggering mechanisms, among which the most popular is the crust cracking of a neutron star, which is called starquake. However, so far there has been no decisive evidence for this speculation. Here we report the energy functions of the three most active repeating FRBs, which show a universal break around $10^{38}$ erg. Such a break is similar to that of the frequency-magnitude relationship of earthquakes. The break and change of the power-law indices below and above it can be well understood within the framework of FRBs triggered by starquakes in the magnetar models. The seed of weak FRBs can grow both on the magnetar surface and in the deeper crust. In contrast, the triggering of strong FRBs is confined by the crustal thickness and the seed of strong FRBs can only grow on the surface. This difference in dimensionality causes a break in the scaling properties from weak to strong FRBs, occurring at a point where the penetration depth of starquakes equals the crustal thickness. Our result, together with the earthquake-like temporal properties of these FRBs, strongly supports that FRBs are triggered by starquakes, providing a new opportunity to study the physical properties of the neutron star crust.
#### A long-term study of Mrk 50 : Appearance and disappearance of soft excess

 - **Abstract**
 We present an extensive temporal and spectral study of the Seyfert 1 AGN Mrk 50 using 15 years (2007-2022) of multiwavelength observations from XMM-Newton, Swift, and NuSTAR for the first time. From the timing analysis, we found that the source exhibited variability of $\sim$20 % during the 2007 observation, which reduced to below 10 % in the subsequent observations and became non-variable in the observations from 2010 onward. From the spectral study, we found that the spectra are nearly featureless. Non-detection of absorption in the low-energy domain during the 15 years of observation infers the absence of obscuration around the central engine, rendering the nucleus a `bare' type. A prominent soft X-ray excess below 2 keV was detected in the source spectrum during the observations between 2007 and 2010, which vanished during the later observations. To describe the nature of the soft excess, we use two physical models, such as warm Comptonization and blurred reflection from the ionized accretion disk. Both the physical models explain the nature and origin of the soft excess in this source. Our analysis found that Mrk~50 accretes at sub-Eddington accretion rate ($\lambda_{Edd}=0.13-0.02$) during all the observations used in this work.
#### Long-term Simultaneous Monitoring Observations of SiO and H2O Masers toward the Mira Variable WX Serpentis

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results from long-term simultaneous monitoring observations of SiO and H2O masers toward the Mira variable star WX Serpentis. This study has been conducted with 21m single-dish radio telescopes of the Korean VLBI Network from 2009 June to 2021 June. Five maser lines were considered: SiO v=1, 2, J=1-0; SiO v=1, J=2-1, 3-2, and H2O 6(1,6)-5(2,3) transitions, with the SiO maser lines distributed near the stellar velocity and the H2O maser exhibiting an asymmetric line profile with five to six peaked components. Intense H2O maser emissions suddenly appeared in 2019 September, indicating flaring. The intensity variations of SiO and H2O masers are strongly correlated with the optical light curve (OLC) of the central star, with individual phase lags; the phase lag of the H2O maser relative to the OLC is larger than that of the SiO masers. The consequent phase difference between the SiO masers and the H2O maser likely indicates that their formation regions and main driving mechanisms are different from each other. The SiO masers in WX Ser exhibit a dominant single-peak velocity distribution, similar to other Mira variable stars. However, the H2O maser displays distinct morphological features, showing a radial acceleration and preferential intensity dominance at blueshifted velocities. This suggests that the H2O maser clouds of WX Ser are moving outward, thereby developing an asymmetric outflow owing to nonuniform material ejection from the stellar atmosphere. The findings confirm that an initial asymmetric outflow structure emerged during the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch phase, specifically in the Mira variable star stage.
#### Void spin distribution as a powerful probe of $\sigma_{8}$

 - **Abstract**
 We present a numerical proof of the concept that the void spin distributions can in principle provide a tight constraint on the amplitude of matter density fluctuation on the scale of $8\,h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$ ($\sigma_{8}$) without being severely deteriorated by the degeneracies of $\sigma_{8}$ with cold dark matter density parameter multiplied by the dimensionless Hubble parameter square ($\Omega_{\rm cdm}h^{2}$), total neutrino mass ($M_{\nu}$) and dark energy equation of state ($w$). Applying the Void-Finder algorithm to a total of $15$ AbacusSummit $N$-body simulations of $15$ different cosmological models, we identify the giant voids to measure their spins, defined as the magnitudes of rescaled specific angular momenta of void halos. The $15$ cosmologies include the Planck $\Lambda$CDM and $14$ non-Planck models, each of which differs among one another only in one of $\{\sigma_{8},\ \Omega_{\rm cdm}h^{2},\ M_{\nu},\ w\}$. The probability density distribution of void spins is determined for each model and found to be well approximated by the generalized Gamma distribution with two characteristic parameters, $k$ and $\theta$. It turns out that the best-fit values of $k$ and $\theta$ exhibit very sensitive dependences only on $\sigma_{8}$, being almost insensitive to $\Omega_{\rm cdm}h^{2}$, $M_{\nu}$, $w$. This exclusive $\sigma_{8}$-dependence of the void spin distributions is confirmed to be robust against the variation of the mass and number cuts of void halos. We also test an observational feasibility of estimating the void spins from real data on the galaxy redshifts.
#### Resolving the $\chi_{\rm eff}$-$q$ correlation among Coalescing Binary Black Holes and Evidence for AGN-driven Hierarchical Mergers

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of the correlation between the effective spins ($\chi_{\rm eff}$) and mass ratios ($q$) of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's binary black holes (BBHs) is still an open question. Motivated by recent identification of two subpopulations of the BBHs, in this work we investigate the potential $\chi_{\rm eff}-q$ correlation for each subpopulation. Surprisingly, the $\chi_{\rm eff}$-$q$ correlation vanishes for the low-mass subpopulation if we introduce a second $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distribution for the high-mass subpopulation likely originating from hierarchical mergers. The first subpopulation has a narrow $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distribution peaking at $\sim0.05$, whose primary-mass function cuts off at $\sim 45M_{\odot}$, in agreement with first-generation BBHs. The second $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distribution is broad and peaks at $\mu_{\chi,2}=0.35^{+0.18}_{-0.22}$, consistent with the expectation of hierarchical mergers formed in the disks of active galactic nucleus (AGNs). We infer $\mu_{\chi,2}>0$ at 98.7\% credible level, and a symmetric $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distribution for the second subpopulation is disfavored by $\mathcal{B}\sim5$. However, negative values of $\chi_{\rm eff}$ are also measured, indicating that the hierarchical mergers may take place within both star clusters and AGN disks. We find a Bayes factor of $\ln\mathcal{B}=5.2$ for two distinct $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distributions relative to single $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distribution that conditioned on mass ratios. Therefore we conclude that the $\chi_{\rm eff}$-$q$ correlation in the entire population can be explained as the superposition of two subpopulations. Additionally, we suggest to use a flexible mass function to reduce the bias in $\chi_{\rm eff}$-$q$ correlation that may be introduced by model mis-specification.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) with neutron star (NS) accretors challenge traditional accretion models, and have sparked a debate regarding the role of geometrical beaming and strong magnetic fields (B). The reduction of the Thomson cross-section in the presence of strong B, leads to a modification of the Eddington limit, and therefore is expected to affect significantly the observational appearance of NS-ULXs. We investigate the role of this modification using population synthesis models, and explore its effects on the X-ray luminosity functions, spin-up rates, and outflow energetics of the observed NS-ULXs. Our results show that the new prescription allows NS-ULXs to achieve super-Eddington luminosities with milder beaming compared to before, improving the agreement with observations. In addition, it broadens the range of spin-up rates allowing for more diverse conditions in NS-ULXs in terms of accretion rates and magnetic fields. More importantly, the reduced beaming increases the likelihood of observing the NS-ULXs within wind-powered nebulae such as NGC 5907 ULX-1. Our findings highlight the necessity of taking into account B effects independently of the approach: geometrical beaming or strong B, and call for magnetospheric accretion prescriptions that can be integrated in population synthesis codes.

After demonstrating the limitations of standard optical methods, which appear ineffective in the low-metallicity environment of the early universe, we evaluate alternative diagnostic techniques using the current JWST observational capabilities. Our analysis focuses on line ratios and equivalent widths (EWs) of UV emission lines: CIV, HeII $\lambda$1640, OIII] $\lambda$1665, and CIII], and the faint optical line, HeII $\lambda$4686. We find that the most valuable diagnostic quantities for finding AGN are the line ratios: (CIII] + CIV) / HeII $\lambda$1640 and CIII] / HeII $\lambda$1640, as well as the EW of HeII $\lambda$1640. For more reliable AGN identification, the HeII $\lambda$1640 and OIII] $\lambda$1665 lines would need to be detected separately. We show that the HeII $\lambda$1640/H$\beta$ ratio effectively separates AGN from star-forming galaxies, though it is contingent on a low dust content. We also show that in order to effectively use these diagnostics, future observations require longer exposure times, especially for galaxies at $z > 6$. Subsequently, we plot three real high-redshift sources on these diagrams which present strong UV emission lines. However, in order to classify them as strong AGN candidates, further study is needed due to the blending of HeII + OIII] and unreliable optical lines. Lastly, we carry out a selection process using spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting with EAZY to identify strong AGN candidates in the JADES NIRCam photometry. One galaxy in our sample emerged as a strong AGN candidate, supported by both photometric selection and strong UV emission. We present a sample of similar AGN candidates in the JADES data based on this method.

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are widely suggested as potential sources of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). The kinetic energy of the jets dissipates, leading to the production of an enormous amount of $\gamma$-ray photons and possibly also the acceleration of protons. The accelerated protons will interact with the radiation of the GRB via the photomeson and Bethe-Heitler processes, which can initiate electromagnetic cascades. This process can give rise to broadband radiation up to the GeV-TeV $\gamma$-ray regime. The expected $\gamma$-ray flux from cascades depends on properties of the GRB jet, such as the dissipation radius $R_{\rm diss}$, the bulk Lorentz factor $\Gamma$, and the baryon loading factor $\eta_p$. Therefore, observations of Fermi-LAT can impose constraints on these important parameters. In this study, we select 12 GRBs of high keV-MeV fluence and constrain the baryon loading factor, under different combinations of the bulk Lorentz factor and the dissipation radius based on Fermi-LAT's measurements. Our findings indicate a strong constraint of $\eta_p<10$ for most selected GRBs over a large parameter space except for large dissipation radii ($\gtrsim 10^{15}\rm cm$) and high bulk Lorentz factors ($\gtrsim 600$). The constraint is comparable to, and in some GRBs even stronger than, that from high-energy neutrinos for stacked GRBs. Our results suggest that for typical bulk Lorentz factor of several hundreds, the dissipation radii of GRBs need be large to avoid overshooting the GeV gamma-ray flux during the prompt emission phase of GRBs, which can be used to constrain GRBs.

 - **Abstract**
 Changing-look active galactic nuclei (CLAGNs) are known to change their spectral type between 1 and 2 (changing-state) or change their absorption between Compton-thick and Compton-thin (changing-obscuration) on timescales of years or less. The physical mechanism and possible connection between the two types of CLAGNs are still unclear. We explore the evolution of the broadband X-ray spectra from Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (\nustar\,) and column density in five CLAGNs with moderate inclination viewing angles, which have shown significant variations of both optical types and X-ray absorption. Based on a phenomenological and two clumpy torus models, we find that the X-ray photon index ($\Gamma$) and the Eddington-scaled X-ray $2-10$ keV luminosity ($L_{\rm X}/L_{\rm Edd}$) are positively correlated for the five sources, which are similar to other bright AGNs and optical CLAGNs at type 1 phase. We find a significant negative correlation between log$N_\mathrm{H,los}$ and log$L_{\rm X}/L_{\rm Edd}$ except for ESO 362-G18. Similar to changing-state AGNs, changing-obscuration AGNs may be also triggered by the evolution of the accretion disc. Our results support the disc wind scenario, where the disc wind proportional to the accretion rate and formed at moderate inclination angles would push the obscuration material further away and decrease the column density from the line of sight observed in the changing-look AGNs.

 - **Abstract**
 Low-energy (<300 keV) protons entering the field of view of XMM-Newton are observed in the form of a sudden increase in the background level, the so-called soft proton flares, affecting up to 40% of the mission observing time. In-flight XMM-Newton's observations of soft protons represent a unique laboratory to validate and improve our understanding of their interaction with the mirror, optical filters, and X-ray instruments. At the same time, such models would link the observed background flares to the primary proton population encountered by the telescope, converting XMM-Newton into a monitor for soft protons. We built a Geant4 simulation of XMM-Newton, including a verified mass model of the X-ray mirror, the focal plane assembly, and the EPIC MOS and pn-CCDs. We encoded the energy redistribution and proton transmission efficiency into a redistribution matrix file (RMF) and an auxiliary response file (ARF). For the validation, three averaged soft proton spectra, one for each filter configuration, were extracted from a collection of 13 years of MOS observations of the focused non X-ray background and analysed with Xspec. The best-fit model is in agreement with the power-law distribution predicted from independent measurements for the XMM-Newton orbit, spent mostly in the magnetosheath and nearby regions. For the first time we are able to link detected soft proton flares with the proton radiation environment in the Earth's magnetosphere, while proving the validity of the simulation chain in predicting the background of future missions. Benefiting from this work and contributions from the Athena instrument consortia, we also present the response files for the Athena mission and updated estimates for its focused charged background.

 - **Abstract**
 In recent years, numerical simulations have become indispensable for addressing complex astrophysical problems. The MagnetoHydroDynamics (MHD) framework represents a key tool for investigating the dynamical evolution of astrophysical plasmas, which are described as a set of partial differential equations that enforce the conservation of mass, momentum, and energy, along with Maxwell's equation for the evolution of the electromagnetic fields. Due to the high nonlinearity of the MHD equations (regardless of their specifications, e.g., classical/relativistic or ideal/resistive), a general analytical solution is precluded, making the numerical approach crucial. Numerical simulations usually end up producing large sets of data files and their scientific analysis leans on dedicated software designed for data visualization. However, in order to encompass all of the code output features, specialized tools focusing on the numerical code may represent a more versatile and built-in tool. Here, we present PyPLUTO, a Python package tailored for efficient loading, manipulation, and visualization of outputs produced with the PLUTO code (Mignone et al., 2007; Mignone et al., 2012). PyPLUTO uses memory mapping to optimize data loading and provides general routines for data manipulation and visualization. PyPLUTO also supports the particle modules of the PLUTO code, enabling users to load and visualize particles, such as cosmic rays (Mignone et al., 2018), Lagrangian (Vaidya et al., 2018), or dust (Mignone et al., 2019) particles, from hybrid simulations. A dedicated Graphical User Interface (GUI) simplifies the generation of single-subplot figures, making PyPLUTO a powerful yet user-friendly toolkit for astrophysical data analysis.
