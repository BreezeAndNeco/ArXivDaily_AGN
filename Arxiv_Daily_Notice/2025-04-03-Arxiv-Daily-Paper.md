 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy and halo scaling relations, connecting a broad range of parameters, are well established from observations. The origin of many of these relations and their scatter is still a matter of debate. It remains a sizable challenge for models to simultaneously and self-consistently reproduce as many scaling relations as possible. We introduce the Magneticum Pathfinder hydrodynamical cosmological simulation suite, to date the suite that self-consistently covers the largest range in box volumes and resolutions. It is the only cosmological simulation suite that is tuned on the hot gas content of galaxy clusters instead of the stellar mass function. By assessing the successes and shortcomings of tuning to the hot gas component of galaxy clusters, we aim to further our understanding of the physical processes shaping the Universe. We analyze the importance of the hot and cold gas components for galaxy and structure evolution. We analyze 28 scaling relations, covering large-scale global parameters as well as internal properties for halos ranging from massive galaxy clusters down to galaxies, and show their predicted evolution from z=4 to z=0 in comparison with observations. These include the halo-to-stellar-mass and Kennicutt--Schmidt relations, the cosmic star formation rate density as well as the Fundamental Plane. Magneticum Pathfinder matches a remarkable number of the observed scaling relations from z=4 to z=0, including challenging relations like the number density of quiescent galaxies at cosmic dawn, the mass--size evolution, the mass--metallicity relation, the Magorrian relation, and the temperature--mass relation. We compile our data to allow for straightforward future comparisons. Galaxy properties and scaling relations arise naturally and the large scatter in observables at high redshift is crucial to distinguish the various galaxy formation models reproducing the z=0 relations.

 - **Abstract**
 Black hole (BH) accretion disks are often coupled to ultramagnetized and tenuous plasma coronae close to their central BHs. The coronal magnetic field can exchange energy between the disk and the BH, power X-ray emission, and lead to jetted outflows. Up until now, the coronal physics of BH accretion has only been studied using fluid modeling. We construct the first model of a BH feeding on a zero-net-flux accretion disk corona based on kinetic plasma physics. This allows us to self-consistently capture how collisionless relativistic magnetic reconnection regulates the coronal dynamics. We present global, axisymmetric, general relativistic particle-in-cell simulation of a BH coupled, via a series of magnetic loops, to a razor-thin accretion disk. We target the jet-launching regime where the loops are much larger than the BH. We ray-trace high-energy synchrotron lightcurves and track the flow of Poynting flux through the system, including along specific field-line bundles. Reconnection on field lines coupling the BH to the disk dominates the synchrotron output, regulates the flux threading the BH, and ultimately untethers magnetic loops from the disk, ejecting them via a magnetically striped Blandford-Znajek jet. The jet is initially Poynting-dominated, but reconnection operates at all radii, depleting the Poynting power logarithmically in radius. Coronal emission and jet launch are linked through reconnection in our model. This link might explain coincident X-ray flaring and radio-jet ejections observed during hard-to-soft X-ray binary state transitions. It also suggests that striped jet launch could be heralded by a bright coronal counterpart. Our synchrotron signatures resemble variability observed from the peculiar changing-look AGN, 1ES 1927+654, and from Sagittarius A*, hinting that processes similar to our model may be at work in these contexts.
#### The Importance of Dust Distribution in Ionizing-photon Escape: NIRCam and MIRI Imaging of a Lyman Continuum-emitting Galaxy at z ~ 3.8

 - **Abstract**
 We present deep JWST/NIRCam and MIRI imaging of Ion1, a previously confirmed Lyman Continuum (LyC)-emitting galaxy at $z_{spec}=3.794$. Together with existing HST imaging, these new observations from the JADES program enable a joint analysis of Ion1's LyC, rest-frame UV, stellar, and dust emission with unprecedented detail. We report the first detection of dust emission at rest-frame $\sim3 \mu$m in a high-redshift LyC-emitting galaxy using MIRI/F1500W. Our analysis suggests a porous distribution of dust in Ion1, with regions exhibiting evidence of dust deficit coinciding both with LyC-emitting regions and with the peak of H$\alpha$ emission. Furthermore, multi-band NIRCam imaging reveals a strong FUV-to-optical color gradient, where LyC-emitting regions appear significantly bluer than the rest of Ion1. Spatially resolved SED fitting confirms that this color gradient is primarily driven by spatially varying dust attenuation. Together, these findings suggest that Ion1's LyC emission originates from a compact star-forming complex near its stellar-light centroid, where stellar feedback carves out low HI column density channels, facilitating LyC escape. However, only a fraction of these LyC photons - specifically those along sightlines with minimal HI obscuration - ultimately escape and reach observers. This work underscores the critical role of dust and neutral gas geometry in shaping LyC escape in galaxies at high redshifts. Anisotropic LyC escape may be a common feature in the early Universe, which must be properly incorporated to constrain the Epoch of Reionization.

 - **Abstract**
 Through gravitational lensing, galaxy clusters can magnify supernovae (SNe) and create multiple images of the same SN. This enables measurements of cosmological parameters, which will be increasingly important in light of upcoming telescopic surveys. We study the prospects of detecting strongly lensed SNe in cluster fields with the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (Roman)'s High Latitude Time Domain Survey (HLTDS) and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). We employed two approaches: one focusing on known multiply imaged galaxies behind clusters, along with the SN rates specific to those galaxies, and another based on the expected number of lensed SNe exploding in a given volume behind a galaxy cluster. We collected all the clusters in the literature that feature a well-constrained lens model and multiply imaged galaxies behind clusters with high-quality data for the lensed galaxies. This allowed us to determine the SN rate for each galaxy. We provide predictions for 46 clusters visible to the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, as well as for 9 observable by Roman's HLTDS, depending on whether the clusters fall within the survey's observing field. We predict that the number of multiply imaged SNe discovered by LSST in its first three years is $3.95 \pm 0.89$ from the first approach or $4.94 \pm 1.02$ from the second. For the HLTDS, the expected number of multiply imaged SNe ranges from $0.38 \pm 0.15$ to $5.2 \pm 2.2$, depending on the specific cluster observed, however, the fields to be targeted remain a matter of discussion. We conclude that LSST offers great prospects for detecting multiply imaged SNe. Our predictions are effectively lower limits, as we only considered the most massive and well-studied clusters. We provide a recommendation for HLTDS observing field selection, namely: either MACS J0553.4-3342 or Abell 1758a should be observed by the survey.
#### Radiative relativistic turbulence as an in situ pair-plasma source in blazar jets

 - **Abstract**
 As powerful gamma-ray engines, blazars -- relativistic plasma jets launched toward Earth from active galactic nuclei -- are manifestly high-energy particle accelerators. Yet, exactly how these jets accelerate particles as well as what they are made of both remain largely mysterious. In this work, we argue that these issues may be linked through the gamma-ray emission for which blazars are renowned. Namely, high-energy photons produced at sites of intense particle acceleration could be absorbed by soft radiation within the jet, enriching it with electron-positron pairs. We explore this possibility in the specific context of particle acceleration by magnetized radiative relativistic turbulence. Using a combination of theory, particle-in-cell simulations, and Fokker-Planck modeling, we identify and characterize a novel pair-production-mediated equilibration mechanism in such turbulence. Initially, turbulent energy injection outpaces radiative cooling, leading to runaway particle acceleration and gamma-ray radiation. Then, gamma-ray absorption begets copious newborn pairs, slowing subsequent particle acceleration. This eventually brings particle acceleration into balance with radiative cooling and shuts down pair production: a pair-enriched final equilibrium. We estimate that this process could significantly load jets of flat-spectrum radio quasars with fresh pairs. These results represent an important connection between particle acceleration and plasma composition in blazar jets.

 - **Abstract**
 Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) experiments have the potential to unveil continuous gravitational wave (CGW) signals from individual massive black hole binaries (MBHBs). Detecting them in both gravitational waves (GW) and the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum will open a new chapter in multimessenger astronomy. We investigate the feasibility of conducting multimessenger studies by combining the CGW detections from an idealized 30-year SKA PTA and the optical data from the forthcoming LSST survey. To this end, we employed the $\texttt{L-Galaxies}$ semi-analytical model applied to the $\texttt{Millennium}$ simulation. We generated 200 different all-sky lightcones that include galaxies, massive black holes, and MBHBs whose emission is modeled based on their star formation histories and gas accretion physics. We predict an average of $\approx 33$ CGW detections, with signal-to-noise ratios $ S/N > 5$. The detected MBHBs are typically at $z < 0.5$, with masses of $ \sim 3 \times 10^{9} M_{\odot}$, mass ratios $> 0.6$ and eccentricities $\lesssim 0.2$. In terms of EM counterparts, we find less than 15% of these systems to be connected with an AGN detectable by LSST, while their host galaxies are easily detectable ($ < 23$ mag) massive ($ M_{\star} > 10^{11} M_{\odot}$) ellipticals with typical star formation rates ($10^{-15} yr^{-1} < sSRF < 10^{-10} yr^{-1}$). Although the CGW-EM counterpart association is complicated by poor sky localization (only 35% of these CGWs are localized within $\rm 100\, deg^2$), the number of galaxy host candidates can be considerably reduced (thousands to tens) by applying priors based on the galaxy-MBH correlations. However, picking the actual host among these candidates is highly non-trivial, as they occupy a similar region in any optical color-color diagram. Our findings highlight the considerable challenges entailed in opening the low-frequency multimessenger GW sky.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxies are not isolated systems; they continuously interact with their surroundings by ejecting gas via stellar feedback and accreting gas from the environment. Understanding the interplay between outflows from the disc and the surrounding circumgalactic medium (CGM) is key to learning how star-forming galaxies evolve. Our goal is to understand how gas in the CGM is accreted onto the inner regions of the disc, making it available for the formation of stars, exploring the connection between stellar feedback and gas accretion from the CGM in Milky Way-like galaxies. We focus on the distribution of vertical and radial gas flows to and from the disc as a function of galactocentric radius, and examine the implications of these processes for the evolution of such galaxies. We use the Arepo code coupled with the SMUGGLE sub-grid model to perform hydrodynamic N-body simulations of 9 different galaxies surrounded by a hot CGM. Each simulation features a gaseous disc with different mass and scale length, allowing us to examine how disc structure impacts gas dynamics. We find evidence of a crucial link between stellar feedback and gas accretion from the CGM, which together play an essential role in sustaining ongoing star formation in the disc. In particular, the ejection of gas from the disc plane by stellar feedback leads to the generation of a baryon cycle in which the CGM gas is mainly accreted onto the external regions of the disc ($ \approx 3-10$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ of gas is accreted into the whole disc). From these regions it is then transported to the centre with radial mass rates $\approx 1-4$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ on average, owing to angular momentum conservation, forming new stars and starting the whole cycle again. We find that both vertical accretion onto the inner regions of the disc and the radial transport of gas from the disc outskirts are necessary to sustain star formation.

 - **Abstract**
 High resolution surveys reveal that the interstellar medium in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies consists of interlinked hierarchies of filamentary structure and superbubbles extending from galactic to subpc scales. The characterization of filament properties across this hierarchy is of fundamental importance for the origin of giant molecular clouds and their star clusters. In this paper we characterize the properties of filaments greater than 25 pc in length that are produced in the multi-scale galactic MHD simulations of Zhao et al. 2024. By adapting the FilFinder algorithm of Koch & Rosolowsky, 2015, we extract over 500 filaments ranging up to 10 kpc scales, to derive the probability distribution functions for filament masses and lengths, magnetic field orientations, and the gravitational stability and fragmentation patterns of filaments. We find power-law distributions for filament masses and lengths. The former has a power law index $\alpha_m = 1.85$ that is nearly identical to that of observed GMC mass functions in extragalactic and Galactic surveys, suggesting that GMC properties are inherited from their host filaments. The fragmentation of magnetized filaments on 200 pc scales or less occurs when they exceed an average critical line mass, as predicted by theory. On larger scales however, kpc filaments form out of the cold neutral medium (CNM) and fragmentation follows local variations in the critical line mass along spiral arms or at the boundaries of superbubbles.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the capabilities of the mid-infrared instrument (MIRI) of James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to advance our knowledge of AGN dust using the spectral fitting technique on an AGN collection of 21 nearby (z<0.05) AGN (7 type-1 and 14 type-2) observations obtained with the medium resolution spectroscopy (MRS) mode. This collection includes publicly available AGN and data from the collaboration of Galactic Activity, Torus, and Outflow Survey (GATOS). We developed a tool named MRSPSFisol that decomposes MRS cubes into point-like and extended contributions. We found statistically good fits for 12 targets with current AGN dust models. The model that provides good fits (chi2/dof<2) for {these 12 targets} assumes a combination of clumpy and smooth distribution of dust in a flare-disk geometry where the dust grain size is a free parameter. Still, two and one AGN statistically prefer the disk+wind and the classical clumpy torus model, respectively. However, the currently available models fail to reproduce 40% of the targets, likely due to the extreme silicate features not well reproduced by the models and signatures of water-ice and aliphatic hydrocarbon absorption features in most targets. New models exploring, for instance, new chemistry, are needed to explain the complexity of AGN dust continuum emission observed by JWST.

 - **Abstract**
 Polarimetric light curves of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) sometimes exhibit loops in the Stokes Q and U plane over time, often interpreted as orbiting hotspot motion. In this work, we apply the differential geometry of planar curves to develop a new technique for estimating polarimetric rotation rates. Applying this technique to 230 GHz light curves of Sgr A*, we find evidence of clockwise motion not only during a post-flare period on 2017 April 11th, as previously discovered, but also during the quiescent days imaged by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). The data exhibit a clockwise fraction of $0.67 \pm 0.09$ and an overall Q-U rotation rate of $-3.7 \pm 1.2 \ \mathrm{deg}\,t_g^{-1}$. We analyze a library of General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations and find that face-on, clockwise-rotating models with strong magnetic fields are most likely to be consistent with the observations. These results are consistent with EHT and GRAVITY Collaboration studies, and indirectly support an interpretation in which the polarized image of Sagittarius A* has been rotated by an external Faraday screen. This technique offers a novel probe of event horizon scale dynamics that complements dynamical reconstructions.
#### Persistent radio sources associated with fast radio bursts: Implications from magnetar progenitors

 - **Abstract**
 The rare association of three persistent radio sources (confirmed PRS1 and PRS2, candidate PRS3) with repeating fast radio bursts (FRB 20121102A, 20190520B, 20201124A) offers a unique probe into their magneto-ionic environments. PRSs are attributed to synchrotron emission from relativistic charged particles of magnetar wind nebula (MWN) powered by spin-down magnetohydrodynamic wind or internal magnetic field decay. Using a multizone hydrodynamic model, we track MWN evolution to constrain magnetar progenitor properties. For PRS1 and PRS2, we find an equipartition radius $R_\mathrm{eq} \sim 0.1 $ pc that is consistent with the radio scintillation estimates ($> 0.03$ pc) and radio imaging limits ($<0.7$ pc). This compact size favors low expansion speeds and large initial spin periods, $P_\mathrm{i} \gtrsim 10$ ms, ruling out millisecond magnetar progenitors. Given $P_\mathrm{i} \gtrsim 10$ ms, a current size of $\sim 0.1$ pc, a supernova kinetic energy $E_\mathrm{ SN} \sim 10^{50}-10^{51}$ erg and an ejecta mass $M \sim 3-10 \; M_{\odot}$, the PRS age is $t \sim 10-10^{2}$ yr. PRSs with $t>20$ years require an internal field ($B_\mathrm{int} \sim 10^{16}-10^{16.5}\;$G) with a decay timescale $t_\mathrm{d} \sim 10-10^{2.5}$ yr. The slowest field decay ($t_\mathrm{d,max} \sim 500$ yr) favors sub-energetic supernovae ($E_\mathrm{SN} \sim 10^{50}$ erg) with massive ejecta ($M \gtrsim 10\; M_{\odot}$) and low ionization fraction ($\sim 3\% $). For the sub-energetic scenario for the confirmed PRSs, we predict a cooling break at $100-150$ gigahertz at $20-40 \; \mu \text{Jy}$ and self-absorption near 200 megahertz at $180\; \mu \text{Jy}$. For PRS3, a rotation-powered MWN is viable only if $t \sim 10$ yr; an inverted spectrum beyond 150 gigahertz would rule out this scenario.
#### Determinations of asteroid masses using mutual encounters observed in the Legacy Survey of Space and Time

 - **Abstract**
 Using published simulations of the 10-year Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), we forecast its ability to determine the masses of individual main-belt asteroids (MBAs) through precise astrometry of any pairs of the ~1.2 million known MBAs undergoing close gravitational encounters during the survey. The uncertainty $\sigma_I$ on the impulse applied to a tracer asteroid by its deflector is derived from the Fisher matrix of the tracer's astrometric data, including an azimuthal acceleration $A_2$ from the Yarkovsky effect as a free parameter for each tracer. If only LSST observations are available, $\sigma_I \approx7\times10^{-6}\,{\rm m}\,{\rm s}^{-1}$ for MBAs at apparent magnitude $m_V<19.5,$ degrading ~10x for $m_V=23.$ These tracers yield a median uncertainty on the mass of an MBA of $\approx4\times10^{-14}M_\odot,$ with a wide range of variation depending on the ``luck'' of close encounters. Roughly 125 MBAs obtain mass measures with S/N>5. If pre-LSST astrometry yields a strong constraint on the state vector of the tracer MBA at the start of LSST, then these values improve to median $\sigma_M\approx1.3\times10^{-14}M_\odot$ and 310 MBAs at S/N>5, with >1/2 of these having S/N>10. These yields would be a ~10-fold increase in the number of known asteroid masses, including a nearly complete knowledge of MBAs with H<7.5. If pre-LSST data are sufficient to start constraining the Yarkovsky effect, another factor $\sim1.5$ can be gained. Tables of the measurable deflector MBAs and their tracers are provided.

 - **Abstract**
 One of the crucial components in simulating the growth and evolution of galaxies within a cosmological framework is the modeling of star formation (SF) and its corresponding feedback. Traditionally, the implemented SF law follows the empirical Kennicutt-Schmidt relation, which links the SF rate (SFR) in a gas element to the total gas density. More recently, an even stronger correlation has been observed between the SFR and the amount of molecular hydrogen ($\mathrm{H}_2$). This opens up the question of whether molecular hydrogen is a necessary precursor for SF or is instead a tracer of the total amount of gas, both of which would explain the observed correlations. In this study, we examine the impact of using an $\mathrm{H}_2$-based SF law on the formation of Milky Way-mass galaxies using cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations. We find that the galaxy modeled with our approach exhibits a well-defined, disc-like morphology. Compared to the traditional recipe, our model delays the onset of SF by approximately $500 \, \mathrm{Myr}$ resulting in a lower SFR, a smaller disc size, and a higher proportion of neutral to ionized gas within the disc region. These findings highlight the importance of including sophisticated SF models which can be compared to several observations -- including those related to $\mathrm{H}_2$ -- to better understand the processes affecting galaxy formation and evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Time-delay distance measurements from strongly lensed quasars provide a robust, independent method for determining the Hubble constant ($H_0$). This approach cross-checks $H_0$ estimates from the distance ladder in the late universe and the cosmic microwave background in the early universe. However, the mass-sheet degeneracy in lensing models introduces systematic uncertainty, limiting precision. Dynamical modeling complements strong lensing by constraining the mass distribution with independent observational data. We develop a methodology and software framework for joint modeling of stellar kinematics and lensing data. Using simulated data for the lensed quasar RXJ1131$-$1131, we demonstrate that high-quality kinematic data can achieve $\sim$4% precision on $H_0$. Through extensive modeling, we examine the impact of the presence of a supermassive black hole in the lens galaxy and potential systematic biases in kinematic data on $H_0$ measurements. Our results show that imposing priors on black hole mass and orbital anisotropy, or excluding central kinematic bins, mitigates biases in $H_0$ estimates. By testing on mock kinematic data with systematic biases, we highlight the need for sub-percent control of kinematic systematics, which is achievable with current technology. Additionally, we leverage GPU parallelization to accelerate Bayesian inference, reducing a previously month-long process by an order of magnitude. This pipeline offers significant potential for advancing cosmological and galaxy evolution studies with large datasets.
#### Scattering blanketing effect of Earth's proto-atmosphere: enhanced suppression of planetary radiation and magma ocean cooling

 - **Abstract**
 The thermal evolution of magma oceans formed by giant impacts is strongly influenced by a proto-atmosphere through its blanketing effect, which suppresses outgoing planetary radiation. While both radiative absorption and Rayleigh scattering by atmospheric species can contribute to this effect, the role of the scattering in suppressing thermal radiation from magma oceans remains unclear. In this study, we developed a 1-D radiative transfer model for planetary and solar radiation in a proto-atmosphere composed of H2O and H2, and a coupled thermal evolution model of a planetary interior and proto-atmosphere, to investigate the scattering blanketing effect on planetary radiation and magma ocean cooling. Our results show that Rayleigh scattering significantly reduces outgoing planetary radiation at wavelengths below ~1 micrometer, particularly in hot, thick atmospheres where scattering is highly effective. Consequently, the planetary outgoing radiation flux decreases by up to about one to two orders of magnitude, and the magma ocean lifetime is prolonged by up to about three times due to the scattering blanketing effect when the total amounts of H2O and H2 are equivalent to or greater than the present-day terrestrial seawater. These findings suggest that the prolonged magma ocean phase facilitated efficient differentiation between compatible and incompatible elements, even in the lower mantle. Furthermore, they imply that sustained magma oceans likely persisted throughout much of the giant impact phase, supporting a magma ocean origin of the Moon consistent with its observed chemical characteristics.

 We investigate the intrinsic and observational properties of $z\gtrsim 6$ galaxies hosting coalescing massive black holes (MBHs) that gives rise to gravitational waves (GWs) detectable with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). We adopt a zoom-in cosmological hydrodynamical simulation of galaxy formation and black hole (BH) co-evolution, zoomed-in on a $M_h \sim 10^{12}~\rm M_{\odot}$ dark matter halo at z = 6, which hosts a fast accreting super-massive black hole (SMBH) and a star-forming galaxy. Following the SMBH formation backward in time, we identify the merging events that concurred to its formation and we pick up the ones that are detectable with LISA. Among these LISA detectable events (LDEs), we select those that, based on their intrinsic properties are expected to be bright in one or more electromagnetic (EM) bands. We post-process these events with dust radiative transfer calculations to make predictions about their spectral energy distributions and continuum maps in the JWST to ALMA wavelength range. We compare the spectra arising from galaxies hosting the merging MBHs with those arising from AGN powered by single accreting BHs. We find that it will be impossible to identify an LDE from the continuum SEDs because of the absence of specific imprints from the merging MBHs. We also compute the profile of the H$_{\rm \alpha}$ line arising from LDEs, considering the contribution from their star-forming regions and the accreting MBHs. We find that the presence of two accreting MBHs would be difficult to infer even if both MBHs accrete at super-Eddington rates. We conclude that the combined detection of GW and EM signals from $z\gtrsim 6$ MBHs is challenging not only because of the poor sky-localization provided by LISA, but also because the loudest GW emitters are not massive enough to leave significant signatures in the emission lines arising from the broad line region.

 - **Abstract**
 The interstellar medium (ISM) is the material that fills the space between the stars in all galaxies; it is a multi-phase medium in pressure equilibrium, with densities and temperatures covering over 6 orders of magnitude. Although accounting for only a small fraction of the mass of any given galaxy, it is a vital component, since it holds the material responsible for galaxy growth through star formation. Studying the ISM requires careful observations at all wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum. This article describes the multi-phase nature of the ISM, and then puts it in the context of galaxy evolution models, emphasising the importance of the cycling of baryons in and out of galaxies. Within this framework, the ISM plays a central role: it connects the physical processes operating on very large physical- and time-scales which control the accretion of gas onto galaxies, and the small scale processes that regulate star formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Warming Mars' surface could be a step toward making it suitable for life, but would represent a major science and engineering challenge. To warm Mars using engineered aerosol, particles released locally must disperse globally. The winds that transport aerosol respond to the aerosol's radiative forcing, implying strong radiative-dynamical feedbacks. Using a plume-tracking climate model without a water cycle, we investigate radiative-dynamical feedback from surface release of two particle compositions: graphene (which attenuates UV) and aluminum. Both compositions can give fast global warming of ~30 K. We infer that 2 liters/second release rate of graphene made from Mars' atmosphere via CO2-electrolysis could double Mars' greenhouse effect (+5 K). Self-lofting helps particles rise and spread. The Hadley cell strengthens under warming, aiding mixing. Warming can be focused in latitude by tuning particle size. Within our model, Mars radiative-dynamical feedbacks enable engineered-aerosol warming. Challenges remain, including functionalization, agglomeration, dry-deposition experiments, and modeling water cycle feedbacks.

 - **Abstract**
 Type-2 quasars (QSO2s) are active galactic nuclei (AGN) seen through a significant amount of dust and gas that obscures the central supermassive black hole and the broad line region. Here we present new mid-infrared spectra of the central kiloparsec of five optically-selected QSO2s at redshift z~0.1 obtained with JWST/MIRI/MRS. These QSO2s belong to the QSOFEED sample and they have log Lbol=45.5-46.0 erg/s, global SFRs that place them above the main sequence, and practically identical optical spectral shape and [OIII] luminosity, but their nuclear mid-infrared spectra exhibit an unexpected diversity of both continua and features. They show: 1) 9.7 micron silicate features going from emission (strength of S9.7=0.5) to relatively strong absorption (S9.7=-1.0) and 18 and 23 micron silicates either in emission or flat. In addition, two of the QSO2s show absorption bands of CO, H2O, and aliphatic grains, indicating different levels of nuclear obscuration across the sample. 2) [NeV]/[NeII] ratios ranging from 0.1 to 2.1 and [NeIII]/[NeII] from 1.0 to 3.5, indicating different coronal line and ionizing continuum strengths. 3) Warm molecular gas masses of 1-4x10^7 Msun and warm-to-cold gas mass ratios of 1-2%, with molecular gas excitation likely due to jet-induced shocks in J1430+1339, and to UV heating and/or turbulence in J1509+0434. 4) PAH emission features with equivalent widths ranging from <0.002 to 0.075 micron, from which we measure a larger contribution from neutral molecules (PAH 11.3/6.2=1.3-3.4) and SFRs<3-7 Msun/yr. This unprecedented dataset allowed us to start exploring the role of various AGN and galaxy properties including ionizing continuum, obscuration, electron density, and jet-ISM interactions on some of the spectral differences listed above, but larger samples are now required to fully understand the diversity of QSO2s' nuclear mid-infrared spectra.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper outlines the scientific goals and observational strategies of the Mini-SiTian array. Mounted at Xinglong Observatory, the Mini-SiTian array consists of three 30 cm telescopes and has been in operation since 2022. The large field of view, combined with the capability for multi-band photometric observations, enables the Mini-SiTian array to perform rapid follow-up observations to identify optical counterparts of gravitational waves, capture the early light curves of tidal disruption events and supernovae, and monitor stellar flares, Be star outbursts, and cataclysmic variable stars, although its limiting magnitude is not very deep. By collaborating with the Xinglong 2.16-m telescope and leveraging a real-time image processing pipeline, simultaneous photometric and spectroscopic observations could be performed to reveal their underlying physical mechanisms. The observational and research experience provide critical guidance for the implementation of the full-scale SiTian project in the future.

 - **Abstract**
 We simulate the optical searching of gravitational-wave electromagnetic counterpart of the binary neutron star (BNS) merger event (i.e., a kilonova) using the ground based {\it SiTian} project prototype telescope with a 5-min limiting magnitude of 22.0, triggered by LIGO and Virgo gravitational wave detectors during the ongoing O4 run. Our simulations show that an average of 0.17-0.25 kilonova events can be observed over the entire O4 period of $\sim 2$ years in the most optimistic case we set, while no kilonova can be detected in other cases. We note that it is beneficial for {\it SiTian}'s kilonova searching by extending the exposure time to gain deeper limiting magnitude despite the rapid decline of kilonova luminosity.

 - **Abstract**
 W Ursa Majoris (W UMa)-type contact binary systems (CBs) with period--luminosity (PL) relations are valuable distance indicators. The PL relations of CBs are affected by metallicity. Here, we establish PL relations and period--luminosity--metallicity (PLZ) relations in nine bands from optical to mid-infrared ($BP$, $G$, $RP$, $J$, $H$, $K_S$, $W1$, $W2$, $W3$) and in five Wesenheit bands based on Gaia DR3 parallaxes. The dispersion of PLZ relations gradually decreases from the optical to mid-infrared bands, with the minimum dispersion of 0.138 mag. We fit the best PL relations for three bands ($W1$, $W_{G,BP,RP}$, $W_{W1,BP,RP}$) under different parallax uncertainty criteria and determine a parallax (after correction) zero point of $zp_\varpi=24\pm4$ $\mu$as. After fixing the parallax zero point, we find that the total zero errors of the PL and PLZ relation are smallest when the parallax uncertainty is less than 2\%, resulting in a calibrated CB luminosity with an accuracy of 0.33\%, which is more accurate than the classical Cepheids. Furthermore, by examining the absolute magnitude residuals in different metallicity intervals, we find that the use of a linear metallicity effect is appropriate for CBs with different metallicities. These results indicate that CBs are excellent standard candles.

 - **Abstract**
 We use HDGAS hydrodynamic simulations to study the impact of active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback on the conversion of atomic-gas to molecular-gas within the circumnuclear-disc (CND) of a typical AGN-dominated galaxy. The comparison of CI, CII, and CO line intensities and their ratios in the HDGAS post-processing radiative-transfer analysis reveals the complex interplay between AGN-activity, cold molecular gas properties, and the physical processes governing the evolution of star-formation in galaxies. Our results demonstrate that the CI/CO intensity ratio serves as a reliable indicator of the atomic-to-molecular gas transition. We present the probability distribution function (PDF) and abundance trends of various metal species related to molecular H$2$ gas, highlighting differences in clumpiness and intensity maps between AGN feedback and NoAGN models. The profile of the integrated intensity (moment-0) maps shows that the AGN-feedback model exhibits a lower CI/CO intensity ratio in the vicinity of the supermassive black hole (< 50 pc), indicating a smaller atomic-gas abundance and the presence of positive AGN-feedback. Our simulations have successfully predicted the presence of faint-CO emissions extending to larger radii from the galactic center. We also explore the relationships between CII/CO and CI/CII intensity ratios, as well as the ratios versus CO intensity, which provides insights into the "CO-dark" issues. One notable feature in the later time-scale of the AGN model is the presence of a "CO-dark" region, where the intensity of CO emission ($\rm I_{CO}$) is depleted relative to the H$_2$ column density ($N_{\rm H_2}$) compared to the NoAGN model.
#### Dust environment of long-period comet C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS)

 - **Abstract**
 We present a characterization of the dust environment of long-period comet C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS) by analyzing an extensive dataset, including dust tail images and photometric measurements, from 10 au pre-perihelion to 1.6 au post-perihelion, using our forward Monte Carlo code. For this analysis, we combine pre-perihelion images from the Zwicky Transient Facility with post-perihelion images from the Sierra Nevada Observatory (IAA-CSIC, Granada, Spain), along with both amateur and professional photometric measurements, including Af$\rho$ and magnitude data. We find that the dust loss rate increases monotonically from the assumed start of activity at a heliocentric distance of approximately 15 au down to 4 au inbound, where the comet exhibits a notable decrease in dust production by about one order of magnitude. Following this period of reduced activity, the dust production rate rises again toward perihelion, reaching a peak production rate of 10$^5$ kg s$^{-1}$. The size distribution of the particles follows a power law, with its index decreasing toward perihelion, along with a reduction in the minimum particle radius, leading to both brightness and dust mass being dominated by small particles at perihelion. The particle speeds exhibit a dependence on heliocentric distance ($r_h$) that closely follows the classical $r_h^{-0.5}$ law near perihelion but deviates at larger heliocentric distances. We demonstrate that the dependence of particle speeds on the cosine of the solar zenith angle at the emission point plays a significant role in shaping the synthetic dust tails and in the formation of a dark stripe along the tail axis observed in high spatial resolution images near the comet's perihelion.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive analysis of the MIRI Extremely Red Object Virgil, a Lyman-$\alpha$ emitter at $z_{spec} = 6.6379 \pm 0.0035$ with the photometric properties of a Little Red Dot. Leveraging new JWST/MIRI imaging from the MIDIS and PAHSPECS programs, we confirm Virgil's extraordinary nature among galaxies in JADES/GOODS-South, exhibiting a strikingly red NIRCam-to-MIRI color (F444W $-$ F1500W = $2.84\pm0.04$~mag). Deep NIRSpec/PRISM spectroscopy from the OASIS program offers key insights into the host galaxy, revealing properties of an average star-forming galaxy during Cosmic Reionization, such as a subsolar metallicity, low-to-moderate dust content, and a relatively high ionization parameter and electron temperature. By estimating the star formation rate of Virgil from UV and H$\alpha$, we find evidence that the galaxy is either entering or fading out of a bursty episode. Although line-ratio diagnostics employed at high-$z$ would classify Virgil as an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN), this classification becomes ambiguous once redshift evolution is considered. Nonetheless, Virgil occupies the same parameter space as recently confirmed AGNs at similar redshifts. The new deep MIRI data at 15~$\mu$m reinforce the AGN nature of Virgil, as inferred from multiple spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting codes. Virgil's rising infrared SED and UV excess resemble those of Dust-Obscured Galaxies (DOGs) studied with Spitzer at Cosmic Noon, particularly blue-excess HotDOGs. Our results highlight the need for a multi-wavelength approach incorporating MIRI to uncover such extreme sources at $z\gtrsim6$ and to shed light on the interplay between galaxy evolution and early black hole growth during Cosmic Reionization.

 - **Abstract**
 Broadband photometric reverberation mapping (RM) provides a measure of the size of the continuum-emitting region in active galactic nuclei (AGN). Previous monitoring campaigns of PG 2130+099 disagree as to whether the continuum emitting region size is consistent with that predicted for a standard optically thick geometrically thin accretion disk. We present $\sim$6 months of observations from several robotic telescopes, providing the highest cadence and widest wavelength coverage photometric RM study of PG 2130+099 to date. Our results indicate that inferred size of the continuum-emitting region in PG 2130+099, like many recently observed AGN, is larger than the simplest predictions for an irradiated geometrically thin, optically thick accretion disk. We also perform a flux-flux analysis, finding a variable spectrum broadly consistent with a disk, and a constant component with enhanced $\textit{i}$-band emission, potentially due to H$\alpha$. We find some evidence of increasing lag with luminosity, but previous lag measurements are too uncertain to be definitive.
#### Open cluster age calibration from colour-magnitude morphological indices using Gaia DR3 data

 - **Abstract**
 Star clusters are crucial for understanding how stars evolve. Their colour-magnitude diagrams show the effects of stellar evolution of approximately coeval objects with the same chemical composition. Furthermore, the determination of their astrophysical parameters (age, distance, colour excess and metallicity) together with their spatial distribution provides information about the structure and the evolution of the Galaxy itself. Using data from the \textit{Gaia} DR3 and 2MASS catalogues, we develop methodologies for characterizing open clusters. Precise membership lists, mean astrometric parameters and radii are obtained. Using photometric data from both data sources, we carried out new age calibrations that rely on morphological indices based on colour ($\Delta BR$) and magnitude ($\Delta G$) differences between the red clump and the turnoff for a sample of 34 open clusters with ages covering the interval $8.3 < \log[t({\rm yr})] < 9.9$. A set of age calibration functions based on \textit{Gaia} morphological age indices are determined for the first time. We demonstrate their accuracy, obtaining a mean residual of 0.06 dex in $\log[t(yr)]$. Our results also show that stellar evolution models tend to predict the difference $\Delta G$. However, they typically overestimate the difference $\Delta BR$ for objects younger than $\log[t({\rm yr})] = 8.8$.
