 - **Abstract**
 We develop a self-consistent quasilinear theory for the relaxation of electromagnetic kinetic plasmas, and demonstrate that the mean distribution functions of both electrons and ions tend to relax to a universal $v^{-5}$ tail. Large-scale electromagnetic (EM) fields efficiently accelerate the unscreened, fast particles but not the screened, slow ones. This non-thermal tail may arise in the solar corona from EM turbulence despite collisions, allowing suprathermal particles to escape the sun's gravity (velocity filtration) and inverting the temperature $(T)$ profile with $T$ rising to $10^6$ K.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations indicate that high-redshift galaxies undergo episodic star formation bursts, driving strong outflows that expel gas and suppress accretion. We investigate the consequences for metal and dust content of galaxies at $z\geq\!5$ using our semi-analytical model, ASHVINI. We track gas-phase and stellar metallicities $(Z_\text{g}, Z_\star)$ and dust mass $(M_{\rm d})$ in dark matter haloes spanning $M_{\rm h} = 10^6 - 10^{11}\,M_\odot$, comparing continuous and bursty star formation scenarios, which reflect underlying assumptions of instantaneous and delayed feedback, and we allow for metallicity-dependent feedback efficiency. Delayed feedback induces oscillations in $Z_{\rm g}$ and $Z_\star$, with $Z_{\rm g}$ declining sharply at low stellar and halo masses. This decline shifts to higher stellar and halo masses as the redshift decreases. Reionization introduces significant scatter, producing an upturn followed by rapid $Z_{\rm g}$ decline. Metallicity-dependent feedback moderates this decline at $z=7-10$, flattening the $Z_{\rm g}$-mass relation to $\simeq 0.03 - 0.04\,Z_\odot$. Dust production tracks $Z_{\rm g}$ but is sensitive to burst history, causing delayed enrichment. Our results show that burst-driven feedback decouples $Z_{\rm g}$ and $Z_\star$, imprints intrinsic scatter in mass-metallicity relations, and delays dust growth. These effects are strongest in low-mass halos $(M_{\rm h}\sim 10^7\,M_\odot)$, where shallow potentials amplify the impact of feedback. Our results are consistent with recent hydrodynamical and semi-analytical simulations and provides context for interpreting JWST metallicity and dust measurements, highlighting the importance of episodic star formation in early galaxy chemical evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 The discovery of thousands of exoplanets and the emergence of telescopes capable of exoplanet atmospheric characterization have intensified the search for habitable worlds. Due to selection biases, many exoplanets under study are planets deemed inhospitable because their surfaces are too warm to support liquid water. We propose that such planets could still support life through ionic liquids: Liquid salts with negligible vapor pressure that can persist on warm planets with thin atmospheres, where liquid water cannot. Ionic liquids have not previously been considered as naturally occurring substances, and thus have not been discussed in planetary science. We demonstrate in laboratory experiments that ionic liquids can form from planetary materials: Sulfuric acid combined with nitrogen-containing organic molecules. Sulfuric acid can be volcanic in origin, and organic compounds are commonly found on planetary bodies. The required planetary surface is water-depleted and must support sulfuric acid transiently in liquid phase to dissolve organics, followed by evaporation of excess liquid, conditions spanning approximately 300 K at 10^-7 atm to 350-470 K at 0.01 atm. Because ionic liquids have extremely low vapor pressures, they are not prone to evaporation, allowing small droplets or pools to persist without ocean-like reservoirs. Ionic liquids' minuscule vapor pressure at room temperature suggests possible stability on planets with negligible atmospheres, shielded by magnetic fields or rock crevices against harsh cosmic radiation. Ionic liquids can stably dissolve enzymes and other biomolecules, enabling biocatalysis and offering a plausible solvent for life, broadening the definition of habitable worlds.

 - **Abstract**
 We combine James Webb Space Telescope images of the nearby galaxy NGC 5194 in the hydrogen recombination line Pa-alpha (lambda=1.8756 micron) from the Cycle 1 program JWST-FEAST with 21 micron dust continuum images from the Cycle 2 Treasury program JWGT to quantify the difference in the calibration of mid-infrared star formation rates (SFR) between HII regions and galaxies. We use the archival HST H-alpha image to correct the Pa-alpha emission for the effects of dust attenuation. Our data confirm previous results that the dust-corrected Pa-alpha flux is tightly correlated with the 21 micron emission at the scales of HII regions. When combined with published JWST data for the HII regions of the galaxy NGC 628 and Spitzer 24 micron data for whole galaxies and for kpc-size galaxy regions, we show that the L(24)-L(Pa-alpha) correlation has exponent >1 across six decades in luminosity. In addition, the hybrid 24 micron+H-alpha SFR indicator has a scaling constant about 4.4 times higher for HII regions than for whole galaxies, also in agreement with previous results. Models of stellar populations with a range of star formation histories reveal that the observed trends can be entirely ascribed to and quantified with the contribution to the IR emission by stellar populations older than ~5-6 Myr. Based on the models' results, we provide: (1) a calibration for the infrared SFR across six orders of magnitude in L(24), from HII regions to luminous galaxies, and (2) a prescription for the scaling constant of the hybrid infrared SFR indicators as a function of the star formation timescale.
#### MAGAZ3NE: Far-IR and Radio Insights into the Nature and Properties of Ultramassive Galaxies at $z\gtrsim3$

 - **Abstract**
 Deep and wide-field near-infrared (NIR) surveys have recently discovered and confirmed ultramassive galaxies (UMGs; $\log (M_{\star}/M_{\odot})>11$) spectroscopically at high redshift. However, most are characterized using only ultraviolet (UV)-to-NIR photometry, offering limited insight into obscured star formation and active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity. In this work, we add ten far-infrared (FIR)-to-radio passbands to the existing UV-to-NIR catalogs for two spectroscopically confirmed UMGs from the MAGAZ3NE survey, COS-DR3-195616 ($z_{\rm spec} = 3.255$) and COS-DR1-209435 ($z_{\rm spec} = 2.481$). Utilizing the full UV-to-radio photometry, we revise our earlier UV-NIR-based interpretation of the nature of these galaxies. While both were previously identified as quiescent, our analysis reveals that 195616 is an unobscured galaxy undergoing quenching, and 209435 is a heavily obscured, actively star-forming UMG. We find that 195616 has already depleted most of its molecular gas and is expected to experience minimal future stellar mass growth. In contrast, 209435 contains a substantial molecular gas reservoir and has a prolonged depletion timescale. It is anticipated to increase 0.34 dex in stellar mass, reaching a stellar mass of $\log (M_{\star}/M_{\odot})$ = 11.72 over the next 0.72 Gyr. We present multi-pronged evidence for AGN activity in both UMGs. Our findings support a scenario where AGN feedback in 195616 may have contributed to gas depletion during quenching, while 209435 continues to form stars despite hosting an obscured AGN, suggesting feedback has not yet suppressed star formation. Our work shows the importance of FIR-to-radio observations for accurately inferring the nature and properties of galaxies at $z\gtrsim3$.

 - **Abstract**
 The IceCube Neutrino Observatory studies cosmic-ray initiated extensive air showers (EASs) using the IceTop surface array, which is sensitive to the electromagnetic component and low-energy ($\sim$ GeV) muonic component of EASs. The contribution from the two components is reconstructed on an event-by-event basis by simultaneously fitting separate lateral distribution functions (LDFs) for both the electromagnetic and muonic components of each shower. In this work, we demonstrate the ability of the two-component LDF reconstruction to recreate the muon distribution in IceTop accurately. The parameters characterizing the reconstructed muonic LDF can vary significantly based on the choice of hadronic interaction model. Thus, the dependence of the reconstructed muon LDF and other parameters on the hadronic interaction models is investigated.

 - **Abstract**
 Accurately assessing image source completeness is critical for interpreting measurements on telescope data. Using the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) and Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) data from the Hubble Space Telescope ($HST$) archival project "SKYSURF", we model galaxy completeness as a function of the exposure time and background of an image. This is accomplished by adding simulated objects with varying magnitudes and sizes into these images, and determining the detection rate for each set of parameters. The fifty percent completeness results are then compared to the Exposure Time Calculator (ETC), in order to assess the differences between the STSCI ETC and our analysis of the archival data. Ultimately, we find that, for extended galaxies, the ETC predicts a 1-2 magnitudes fainter completeness limit than our data. We believe the difference is due to the ETC's flat surface brightness profiles being less accurate at predicting for extended sources compared to our more realistic profiles.
#### Optical emission from luminous and very soft X-ray sources in nearby galaxies: testing the scenario of edge-on supercritical accretion systems

 - **Abstract**
 Supercritical accretion onto compact objects is expected to drive optically thick winds, resulting in observed X-ray emission as a function of viewing angle. However, their optical emission, either from the outer accretion disk or companion surface tends to be nearly isotropic. Based on a sample of luminous and very soft X-ray sources that are argued to be supercritical accretion systems viewed close to edge-on, we identified the optical counterparts for some of them and compared the optical properties with those of ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs), which are supposed to be supercritical accretion systems viewed close to face-on. The optical luminosity is found in a wide range, with the absolute visual magnitude ranging from dimmer than -1.2 in some sources to about -7 in one case. Most sources show a power-law like spectrum while four of them display a blackbody shape. One of them shows an optical spectrum resembling a B type main sequence, suggesting that it may be a Be white dwarf system. Strong variability in flux at timescales as short as 10 days are revealed, indicating that some of these sources are powered by accretion onto compact objects. These suggest that the luminous and very soft X-ray sources in nearby galaxies have a diverse population, and some of them are indeed consistent with emission from supercritical accretion, with consistent optical magnitudes and colors. Future optical spectroscopic observations are needed to further constrain their natures.
#### Accretion is All You Need: Black Hole Spin Alignment in Merger GW231123 Indicates Accretion Pathway

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08558

 - **Abstract**
 GW231123 represents the most massive binary-black-hole merger detected to date, lying firmly within, or even above, the pair-instability mass gap. The component spins are both exceptionally high ($a_1 = 0.90^{+0.10}_{-0.19}$, $a_2 = 0.80^{+0.20}_{-0.51}$), which is difficult to explain with repeated mergers. Here we show that the black hole spin vectors are closely aligned with each other while significantly tilted relative to the binary's orbital angular momentum, pointing to a common accretion-driven origin. We examine astrophysical formation channels capable of producing near-equal, high-mass, and mutually aligned spins consistent with GW231123 -- particularly binaries embedded in AGN disks and Pop~III remnants, which grew via coherent misaligned gas accretion. We further argue that other high-mass, high-spin events, e.g., GW190521 may share a similar evolutionary pathway. These findings underscore the critical role of sustained, coherent accretion in shaping the most extreme black hole binaries.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the number density of massive ($ \mathrm{ log (M_{*}/M_{\odot}) > 10.3} $) quiescent galaxies at $2<z<5$ using JWST NIRSpec PRISM spectra. This work relies on spectra from RUBIES, which provides excellent data quality and an unparalleled, well-defined targeting strategy to robustly infer physical properties and number densities. We identify quiescent galaxy candidates within RUBIES through principal component analysis and construct a final sample using star formation histories derived from spectro-photometric fitting of the NIRSpec PRISM spectra and NIRCam photometry. By inverting the RUBIES selection function, we correct for survey incompleteness and calculate the number density of massive quiescent galaxies at these redshifts, providing the most complete spectroscopic estimates prior to cosmic noon to date. We find that early massive quiescent galaxies are surprisingly common ($\gtrsim 10^{-5}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ by $4<z<5$), which is consistent with previous studies based on JWST photometry alone and/or in smaller survey areas. We compare our number densities with predictions from six state-of-the-art cosmological galaxy formation simulations. At $z>3$, most simulations fail to produce enough massive quiescent galaxies, suggesting the treatment of feedback and/or the channels for early efficient formation are incomplete in most galaxy evolution models.
#### Infrared and Optical Emission-line Diagnostics

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08603

 - **Abstract**
 We study a catalogue of over 130 emission-line galaxies with matched near infra-red (NIR) and optical spectra, where we examine the relationship between the respective nuclear activity classifications, diagnosed by the flux ratios of emission lines. We match the standard NIR classification with four different optical classifications. While there is a broad agreement between the two regimes, there are mismatches and overlaps caused either by aperture effects and/or NIR radiation penetrating obscuring dust and "seeing deeper" into the nuclear region, thus exposing AGN activity. We examine the relationship between the equivalent widths (EW) of H$\alpha$ and Pa$\beta$, as well as the ratios [N II]/H$\alpha$ vs. [Fe II]/Pa$\beta$, and find reasonable correlations. We thus propose a new diagnostic (EW of Pa$\beta$ with Fe - WPF) in the NIR (analogous to the WHaN classification), using the [Fe II]/Pa$\beta$ flux ratio and the EW of the Pa$\beta$ line. We show, within the limitations of the catalogue size, that the regions of the standard NIR diagram can be reasonably replicated in this new scheme. This diagnostic has the advantage that only one wavelength range needs to be observed, thus being economical with telescope time.
#### Formation process of young stellar population in Messier 16 from a kinematic perspective

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08666

 - **Abstract**
 We present a kinematic study of young stars in Messier 16 (M16) using the Gaia Data Release 3 and high-resolution spectra. A total of 345 stars are selected as genuine members using the published lists of X-ray, infrared sources, and early-type stars as well as the Gaia data. There is severe differential reddening across this region and the reddening law of the intracluster medium appears abnormal. The distance to M16, derived from the parallaxes of the members, is about 1.7 kpc. The ages of members, estimated by comparing their color-magnitude diagram with theoretical isochrones, range from 1 Myr to 4 Myr. This star-forming region is composed of an open cluster (NGC 6611) and a distributed population. This cluster shows a clear pattern of expansion and rotation. Some of the distributed population are spatially associated with the gas pillars located at the ridge of H II bubble. In particular, several stars moving away from the cluster are physically associated with the northeastern pillar. In addition, their younger ages support the idea that the formation of these stars was triggered by the feedback from massive stars in NGC 6611. On the other hand, the other stars do not show systematic radial or stream motions; therefore, they likely formed through spontaneous star formation events. We discuss the formation of young stars in the context of cluster expansion, spontaneous star formation, and feedback-driven star formation, and suggest that all of these mechanisms possibly contributed to their formation.
#### Luminaries in the Sky: The TESS Legacy Sample of Bright Stars. I. Asteroseismic detections in naked-eye main-sequence and sub-giant solar-like oscillators

 - **Abstract**
 We aim to detect and characterise solar-like oscillations in bright naked-eye (V<6) main-sequence (MS) and subgiant stars observed by TESS. We seek to expand the current benchmark sample of oscillators, provide accurate global asteroseismic parameters for these bright targets, and assess their potential for future detailed investigations -- including missions such as the HWO and PLATO. Our sample of bright stars was selected from the Hipparcos/Tycho catalogues. We analysed TESS 120-s and 20-s cadence photometry using SPOC light curves and custom apertures from target pixel files. After applying a filtering of the light curves, we extracted global asteroseismic parameters ($\nu_{\rm max}$ and $\Delta\nu$) using the pySYD pipeline. Results were cross-validated with independent pipelines and compared to predictions from the ATL, while noise properties were evaluated to quantify improvements from a 20-s observing cadence. We detect solar-like oscillations in a total of 196 stars -- including 128 new detections -- with extracted $\nu_{\rm max}$ and $\Delta\nu$ values showing strong conformity to expected scaling relations. This corresponds to an increase by more than an order of magnitude in the number of MS stars with detection of solar-like oscillations from TESS. Nearly 40% of our new detections are prime HWO targets, enabling systematic asteroseismic age determinations relevant for interpreting atmospheric biosignatures. Our analysis confirms that 20-s cadence data yields lower high-frequency noise levels compared to 120-s data. Moreover, the precise stellar parameters obtained through asteroseismology establish these bright stars as benchmarks for seismic investigations and provide useful constraints for refining stellar evolution models and for complementary analyses in interferometry, spectroscopy, and exoplanet characterisation.

 - **Abstract**
 We have performed timing of a number of known slow pulsars with poorly known coordinates and parameters of their intrinsic rotation. We used data from the archive of round-the-clock monitoring observations on the third (stationary) beam pattern of the Large Phased Array radio telescope (LPA LPI) at a frequency of 111 MHz, which has an unsatisfactory connection of the local quartz time standards to the reference scale (UTC). To compensate for the resulting errors, we applied an algorithm previously developed by us, which uses Pulsar Timescale as an intermediate reference scale to compute corrections to the pulses Times of Arrival (TOAs) measured by the local clocks and to switch to UTC. Analyzing a ten-year observational data set we substantially refined the rotational and astrometric parameters of 12 pulsars. The spin frequencies $\nu$ and their first derivatives $\dot\nu$ were determined with accuracies of $10^{-10}$ Hz and $10^{-19}$ s$^{-2}$, respectively, which is 5-6 orders of magnitude better than the values quoted in the catalogue. The coordinates are determined with accuracies ranging from units to tens of arcseconds.

 - **Abstract**
 We present ground-based, multi-band light curves of the AGN Mrk~509, NGC\,4151, and NGC\,4593 obtained contemporaneously with \sw\, monitoring. We measure cross-correlation lags relative to \sw\, UVW2 (1928~Å) and test the standard prediction for disk reprocessing, which assumes a geometrically thin, optically thick accretion disk where continuum interband delays follow the relation \( \tau(\lambda) \propto \lambda^{4/3} \). For Mrk~509 the 273-d \sw\, campaign gives well-defined lags that increase with wavelength as $\tau(\lambda)\propto\lambda^{2.17\pm0.2}$, steeper than the thin-disk prediction, and the optical lags are a factor of $\sim5$ longer than expected for a simple disk-reprocessing model. This ``disk-size discrepancy'' as well as excess lags in the $u$ and $r$ bands (which include the Balmer continuum and H$\alpha$, respectively) suggest a mix of short lags from the disk and longer lags from nebular continuum originating in the broad-line region. The shorter \sw\, campaigns, 69~d on NGC\,4151 and 22~d on NGC\,4593, yield less well-defined, shorter lags $<2$~d. The NGC\,4593 lags are consistent with $\tau(\lambda) \propto \lambda^{4/3}$ but with uncertainties too large for a strong test. For NGC\,4151 the \sw\, lags match $\tau(\lambda) \propto \lambda^{4/3}$, with a small $U$-band excess, but the ground-based lags in the $r$, $i$, and $z$ bands are significantly shorter than the $B$ and $g$ lags, and also shorter than expected from the thin-disk prediction. The interpretation of this unusual lag spectrum is unclear. Overall these results indicate significant diversity in the $\tau-\lambda$ relation across the optical/UV/NIR, which differs from the more homogeneous behavior seen in the \sw\, bands.

 - **Abstract**
 CORSIKA 8 represents a significant update in the simulation of particle showers, building on the well-established foundation of CORSIKA 7. It has been entirely rewritten as a modular and modern C++ framework, addressing the limitations of its predecessor to provide a flexible platform designed to satisfy current and novel use cases. This allows for application beyond pure air-shower scenarios such as cross-media particle cascades and an advanced calculation of the radio emission. A first official "physics-complete" version has already been released that supports the treatment of hadronic interactions with Sibyll 2.3d, QGSJet-II.04, and EPOS-LHC and the treatment of the electromagnetic cascade with PROPOSAL 7.6.2. In this presentation, we will discuss the design principles, current functionality, and validation efforts of CORSIKA 8, emphasizing its potential applications for future experiments.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent detections of optical pulsations from both a transitional and an accreting millisecond pulsar have revealed unexpectedly bright signals, suggesting that the presence of an accretion disk enhances the efficiency of optical emission, possibly via synchrotron radiation from accelerated particles. In this work, we present optical observations of the redback millisecond pulsar PSR J2339-0533, obtained with the SiFAP2 photometer mounted on the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo. Data accumulated during the campaign with the longest exposure time (12 hr) suggest that its $\sim$18 mag optical counterpart exhibits pulsations at the neutron star's spin frequency. This candidate signal was identified by folding the optical time series using the pulsar ephemeris derived from nearly simultaneous observations with the 64-m Murriyang (Parkes) radio telescope. The detection significance of the candidate optical signal identified in those data lies between 2.9 and 3.5 $\sigma$, depending on the statistical test employed. The pulsed signal has a duty cycle of $\approx 1/32$, and the de-reddened pulsed magnitude in the V band is $(26.0 \pm 0.6)$ mag. At a distance of 1.7 kpc, this corresponds to a conversion efficiency of $\sim 3 \times 10^{-6}$ of the pulsar's spin-down power into pulsed optical luminosity, comparable to values observed in young, isolated pulsars like the Crab, but 50-100 times lower than in disk-accreting millisecond pulsars. If confirmed, these findings suggest that optical pulsations arise independently of an accretion disk and support the notion that such disks boost the optical emission efficiency.

 - **Abstract**
 Large-scale solar eruptions are generally accepted to have coronal magnetic flux ropes as their core structures. Recent studies found that the solar eruptions could be initiated by a sequence of flux feeding processes, during with chromospheric fibrils rise and merge with the pre-existing coronal flux rope. Further theoretical analyses have demonstrated that the normal flux feeding, i.e. the axial magnetic flux within the fibril is in the same direction as that in the flux rope, results in the accumulation of the total axial flux within the flux rope, so as to initiate the eruption. If the directions of the axial flux in the fibril and the flux rope are opposite, it is termed inverse flux feeding, whose influence on coronal flux ropes, however, is still unclear. In this paper, we use a 2.5-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic model to simulate the evolution of coronal flux ropes associated with inverse flux feeding. It is found that inverse flux feeding is also efficient in causing solar eruptions: although the total signed axial magnetic flux of the rope decreases after inverse flux feeding, the total unsigned axial flux can accumulate; the eruption occurs if the unsigned axial flux of the rope reaches a critical value, which is almost the same as the threshold for normal flux feeding. The total axial currents within the rope are also similar during the onset of the eruptions caused by both normal and inverse flux feeding. Our simulation results suggest that it is the unsigned axial magnetic flux rather than the signed axial flux that regulates the onset of coronal flux rope eruptions.

 - **Abstract**
 Little Red Dots (LRDs) are compact sources at $z>5$ discovered through JWST spectroscopy. Their spectra exhibit broad Balmer emission lines ($\gtrsim1000\rm~km~s^{-1}$), alongside absorption features and a pronounced Balmer break -- evidence for a dense, neutral hydrogen medium with the $n=2$ state. When interpreted as arising from AGN broad-line regions, inferred black hole masses from local scaling relations exceed expectations given their stellar masses, challenging models of early black hole--galaxy co-evolution. However, radiative transfer effects in dense media may also impact the formation of hydrogen emission lines. We model three scattering processes shaping hydrogen line profiles: resonance scattering by hydrogen in the $n=2$ state, Raman scattering of UV radiation by ground-state hydrogen, and Thomson scattering by free electrons. Using 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations with multi-branching resonance transitions, we examine their imprint on line shapes and ratios. Resonance scattering produces strong deviations from Case B flux ratios, clear differences between H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$, and encodes gas kinematics in line profiles but cannot broaden H$\beta$ due to conversion to Pa$\alpha$. While Raman scattering can yield broad wings, scattering of UV continuum is disfavored given the absence of strong FWHM variations across transitions. Raman scattering of higher Lyman-series emission can produce H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ wing width ratios of $\gtrsim1.28$, agreeing with observations. Thomson scattering can reproduce the observed $\gtrsim1000~\rm km\, s^{-1}$ wings under plausible conditions, e.g., $T_{\rm e} \sim 10^4\rm \, K$ and $N_{\rm e}\sim10^{24}\rm~cm^{-2}$ -- and lead to black hole mass overestimates by factors $\gtrsim10$. Our results provide a framework for interpreting hydrogen lines in LRDs and similar systems.

 - **Abstract**
 We selected BHB stars based on synthetic photometry and stellar atmosphere parameters inferred from Gaia Bp/Rp spectra. We generated the synthetic SDSS broad-band $ugr$ and Pristine narrow-band CaHK magnitudes from Gaia Bp/Rp data. A photometric selection of BHB candidates was made in the $(u-g, g-r)$ and $(u-\mathrm{CaHK},g-r)$ color-color spaces. A spectroscopic selection in $T_\mathrm{eff}-\log g$ space was applied to remove stars with high surface gravity. The selection function of BHB stars was obtained by using the Gaia DR3 photometry. A non-parametric method that allows the variation in the vertical flattening $q$ with the Galactic radius, was adopted to explore the density shape of the stellar halo. We present a catalog of 44,552 high latitude ($|b|>20^\circ$) BHB candidates chosen with a well-characterized selection function. The stellar halo traced by these BHB stars is more flattened at smaller radii ($q=0.4$ at $r\sim8$ kpc), and becomes nearly spherical at larger radii ($q=0.8$ at $r\sim25$ kpc). Assuming a variable flattening and excluding several obvious outliers that might be related to the halo substructures or contaminants, we obtain a smooth and consistent relationship between $r$ and $q$, and the density profile is best fit with by a single power law with an index $\alpha=-4.65\pm0.04$.

 - **Abstract**
 The Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (SUIT) is an instrument onboard Aditya--L1, the first solar space observatory of the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), India, launched on September 2, 2023. SUIT is designed to image the Sun in the 200--400 nm wavelength band in eight narrowband and three broadband filters. SUIT's science goals start with observing the solar atmosphere and large-scale continuum variations, the physics of solar flares in the NUV region, and many more. The paper elucidates the functioning of the instrument, software packages developed for easier calibration, analysis, and feedback, calibration routines, and the regular maintenance activity of SUIT during the first year of its operation. The paper also presents the various operations undergone by, numerous program sequences orchestrated to achieve the science requirements, and highlights some remarkable observations made during the first year of observations with SUIT.

 - **Abstract**
 We use cosmological hydrodynamic simulations (IllustrisTNG and SIMBA) to explore the redshift, luminosity, and black hole mass dependence of the quasar halo occupation distribution (HOD). In both simulations, we find that the quasar activity is quenched at a characteristic halo mass ($\sim 10^{13} M_{\odot}$) scale affecting the nature of its occupation distribution function. We note that the quenching is more pronounced at low redshifts for quasars selected through a luminosity threshold. We show that a very significant bias ({\bf a factor of $\sim 10-50$ in the central occupation and $\sim 10-70\%$ in the satellite occupation fraction}) is introduced in the reconstruction of quasar host halo mass distributions from the observed two-point-correlation function, if the HOD modeling does not account for the quenching effect in the central occupation function. While there is strong suppression of the occupation fraction of central quasars, the satellite occupation still follows a power-law like behavior. Our results show that the global satellite fraction of quasars increases monotonically from high to low redshifts, with $20-40 \%$ of the quasars being satellite at intermediate redshifts, consistent with previous clustering based estimates. In addition, our study reveals that while the occupation function of quasars depends on redshift, luminosity, and feedback modes, there is hardly any evolution in the supermassive black hole (SMBH; mass-selected sample) occupation. The SMBH HOD over the entire parameter space is well-modeled by a power-law and a step function similar to what has been found for galaxies and low-luminosity active galactic nuclei.

 - **Abstract**
 A major challenge in understanding the initiation and evolution of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) is measuring the magnetic field of the magnetic flux ropes (MFRs) that drive CMEs. Recent developments in radio imaging spectroscopy have paved the way for diagnosing the CMEs' magnetic field using gyrosynchrotron radiation. We present magnetic field measurements of a CME associated with an X5-class flare by combining radio imaging spectroscopy data in microwaves (1--18 GHz) and meter-wave (20--88 MHz), obtained by the Owens Valley Radio Observatory's Expanded Owens Valley Solar Array (EOVSA) and Long Wavelength Array (OVRO-LWA), respectively. EOVSA observations reveal that the microwave source, observed in the low corona during the initiation phase of the eruption, outlines the bottom of the rising MFR-hosting CME bubble seen in extreme ultraviolet and expands as the bubble evolves. As the MFR erupts into the middle corona and appears as a white light CME, its meter-wave counterpart, observed by OVRO-LWA, displays a similar morphology. For the first time, using gyrosynchrotron spectral diagnostics, we obtain magnetic field measurements of the erupting MFR in both the low and middle corona, corresponding to coronal heights of 1.02 and 2.83 $R_{\odot}$. The magnetic field strength is found to be around 300 G at 1.02 $R_{\odot}$ during the CME initiation, and about 0.6 G near the leading edge of the CME when it propagates to 2.83 $R_{\odot}$. These results provide critical new insights into the magnetic structure of the CME and its evolution during the early stages of its eruption.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have traditionally been classified by duration into long (LGRBs) and short (SGRBs), with the former believed to originate from massive star collapses and the latter from compact binary mergers. However, events such as the SGRB 200826A (coming from a collapsar) and the LGRBs 211211A and 230307A (associated with a merger) suggest that duration-based classification could be sometimes misleading. Recently, the minimum variability timescale (MVT) has emerged as a key metric for classifying GRBs. Aims. We calculate the MVT, defined as the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the narrowest pulse in the light curve, using an independent dataset from Fermi/GBM and we compare our results with other MVT definitions. We update the MVT-T90 plane and analyse peculiar events like long-duration merger candidates 211211A, 230307A, and other short GRBs with extended emission (SEE-GRBs). We also examine extragalactic magnetar giant flares (MGFs) and explore possible new correlations with peak energy. Methods. We used the MEPSA algorithm to identify the shortest pulse in each GRB light curve and measure its FWHM. We calculated the MVT for around 3700 GRBs, 177 of which with spectroscopically known redshift. Results. SEE-GRBs and SGRBs share similar MVTs (from few tens to a few hundreds of ms), indicating a common progenitor, while extragalactic MGFs exhibit even shorter values (from few ms to few tens of ms). Our MVT estimation method consistently yields higher values than another existing technique, the latter aligning with the pulse rise time. For LGRBs, we confirmed the correlations of MVT with peak luminosity and Lorentz factor. Conclusions. We confirmed that, although MVT alone cannot determine the GRB progenitor, it is a valuable tool when combined with other indicators, helping to flag long-duration mergers and distinguish MGFs from typical SGRBs.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comparative spectral analysis to explore the ability of a cooler Sun model to accurately capture the spectral line shape changes caused by Sunspots. In the search for small Earth-like planets, the effects of stellar surface activity can overwhelm the $\sim$10 cm/s planetary RV signal. This necessitates the development of new stellar modeling methods and a greater understanding of the impact of surface activity on stellar spectra. Some attempts to model out noise from Sunspot activity, in particular, have used a sum of a stellar model with a model of a cooler, but otherwise identical star. From our analysis, we find that a cooler effective temperature alone cannot capture the numerous spectral line shape variations seen in a Sunspot observation. The cooler temperature of a Sunspot not only deepens the cores of atomic lines, it also increases and strengthens molecular lines that are not fully represented in our line list. Furthermore, our LTE models and a comparison cool star also fail at capturing line strengthening, broadening, blending, and splitting induced by the magnetic field in the Sunspot.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a measurement of the non-Gaussian four-point correlation function (4PCF) from the DESI DR1 Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) sample. For the gravitationally induced parity-even 4PCF, we detect a signal with a significance of 14.7$\sigma$ using our fiducial setup. We assess the robustness of this detection through a series of validation tests, including auto- and cross-correlation analyses, sky partitioning across multiple patch combinations, and variations in radial scale cuts. Due to the low completeness of the sample, we find that differences in fiber assignment implementation schemes can significantly impact estimation of the covariance and introduce biases in the data vector. After correcting for these effects, all tests yield consistent results. This is one of the first measurements of the connected 4PCF on the DESI LRG sample: the good agreement between the simulation and the data implies that the amplitude of the density fluctuation inferred from the connected 4PCF is consistent with the Planck $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. The methodology and diagnostic framework established in this work provide a foundation for interpreting parity-odd 4PCF.

 - **Abstract**
 In low luminosity active galactic nuclei like M87$^*$ and Sgr A$^*$, the accretion flow in the vicinity of the black hole is in the collisionless regime, meaning that the collisional mean free path of charged particles is much larger than the dynamic length scales. To properly model the particle energization and emission from the collisionless accretion flow, a promising approach is to employ the global general relativistic particle-in-cell simulations -- a newly developed, fully kinetic, first-principles method. However, it has been challenging to set up an initial condition that involves collisionless gas with finite angular momentum. We present, for the first time, a class of analytic kinetic equilibria of collisionless tori around a Kerr black hole. We have successfully implemented the collisionless tori in our GPU-based GRPIC code framework Aperture, and found them to be stable for hundreds to thousands of dynamical times in 2D axisymmetric simulations when there is no initial seed magnetic field. These kinetic equilibria serve as ideal starting points for future studies of the physics of collisionless accretion and jet launching.
