#### Exoplanet exploration in the context of the PLATO mission: From detection to population studies

 - **Abstract**
 This thesis constitutes an observational effort to advance our understanding of planet formation and evolution across different regimes. To do so, we exploited Kepler/K2 and TESS data in combination with ground-based observations, serving as a preparation for the PLATO mission. This endeavour led to the discovery and statistical validation of four planets, the confirmation and characterisation of two other planets, the detection of 14 new planet candidates, and the revision of the properties of 25 previously reported planets. Among them, we find TOI-244 b to be a super-Earth with a density below what would be expected for an Earth-like composition, and we thus refer to TOI-244 b as a low-density super-Earth (LDSE). We also confirm the transiting super-Neptune TOI-5005 b. In this system, we find photometric variability that matches the planetary orbital period, suggesting the existence of magnetic star-planet interactions (MSPIs). We also detect similar synchronised signals in the eccentric HD 118203 system, which appear and disappear across different orbits, in agreement with the well-known 'on/off' nature of MSPIs. At a population level, we find that LDSEs tend to be hosted by stars with subsolar metallicities and that the lowest dense LDSEs tend to receive low insolation fluxes. We also identify an over-density of Neptunian planets in orbits corresponding to periods between ~3.2 and 5.7 days, which we refer to as the Neptunian 'ridge'. The 'ridge', coinciding with the orbital range of the hot Jupiter pileup, suggests a common path in the evolution of the closest giant planets. The low-insolation trend of LDSEs suggests that the largest fraction of volatile elements in these planets is directly exposed to the received irradiation from their host stars. Solving these two problems will greatly contribute to completing the full picture of the evolution of planetary systems.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a model that explains some extreme variability phenomena observed in active galactic nuclei (AGN). In this model, an orbiting companion interacts with the accretion disk surrounding the central supermassive black hole (SMBH). This interaction excites spiral density waves, leading to bursts of mass inflow lasting a few orbital timescales, whose mass content depends sensitively on the sphere of influence of the orbiting companion. To explain changing-look (CL) AGN, we find that lighter SMBH companions are necessary, while we generally exclude stellar companions. The moderately massive black hole perturber must be on a highly eccentric orbit in order to account for the non-repeating nature of most CL AGN. When applied to quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs), we find that stars with highly eccentric orbits and close pericenter passages can produce accretion flares with QPE-like characteristics. For many QPEs, low-mass main-sequence stars or stripped-envelope stars are required. Although moderately massive black hole perturbers could also match the observed properties of QPEs, the gravitational-wave merger timescales of such binary systems are prohibitively short.
#### Discovery of Diffuse Radio Emission in a Massive z=1.709 Cool Core Cluster: A Candidate Radio Mini-Halo

 - **Abstract**
 Clusters of galaxies host spectacular diffuse radio sources, extending over scales from 100 kpc to several Mpcs. These sources, with extremely faint surface brightness ($\mu$Jy/arcsec$^2$ level), are not tied to individual galaxies but trace synchrotron emission from large-scale magnetic fields and relativistic particles within the intracluster environment. Here, we report the discovery of a candidate radio mini-halo in SpARCS104922.6+564032.5, the most distant cool-core galaxy cluster identified to date at $z=1.709$, using deep LOFAR 120-168 MHz observations. We show that this emission originates from diffuse cluster-associated processes rather than unresolved AGN or star-forming galaxies. The diffuse radio emission coincides spatially with the X-ray emission of the hot intracluster medium and has a radio power of $P_{\rm 150~MHz}=49.8^{+14.7}_{-11.7} \times10^{24}$ W Hz$^{-1}$, exhibiting striking similarities to low-redshift radio mini-halos. This discovery doubles the redshift of previously known mini-halos, challenging models of inverse Compton losses and indicating the presence of strong magnetic fields, enhanced turbulence in high-redshift clusters, or active hadronic processes that require a cosmic ray-to-thermal energy ratio of 0.07 within 200 kpc, assuming a clumped distribution with spatial correlations among the gas, cosmic rays, and magnetic field that partially compensate for cosmological redshift dimming. It further implies that magnetic fields are efficiently amplified to $\sim$$10~\mu$G levels within a Mpc$^3$ volume during the epoch of cluster formation before $z\sim2$. These findings provide critical insights into high-redshift cluster physics and emphasize the transformative potential of next-generation radio surveys, such as those with the SKA and ngVLA, in exploring the early evolution of galaxy clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) grow primarily through gas accretion, observed as active galactic nuclei (AGNs). While mergers can drive luminous AGN episodes, secular processes may fuel a substantial portion of cosmic BH growth. Whether these mechanisms can sustain high BH accretion rates remains uncertain. This study aims to identify the secular mechanism driving high BH accretion rates, by targeting a galaxy with moderately massive SMBH, high central gas densities, accretion rates of a few percent of the Eddington limit, and gas kinematics resolved close to black hole-dominated scales. A blind search led to the identification of NGC 4593, which is representative of the AGN population driving BH mass density growth since $z=1$. A prominent single-arm ("$m=1$") molecular gas spiral with ${\rm log}\,M_{\rm mol}/{\rm M}_\odot=8.1\pm0.3$ extends from 1.3$\,$kpc down to the SMBH's sphere of influence ($1.7^{+0.5}_{-0.2}\,{\rm pc}$). Star formation in the spiral is inefficient (${\rm SFR} = 4.9 \times 10^{-2} \,{\rm M}_\odot {\rm /yr}$, $\langle t_{\rm dep}\rangle=3.9 \pm 0.6\,\rm{Gyr}$), whereas inflow rate exceeds the SFR by two orders of magnitude and is sufficient to sustain the current BH accretion rate for $\geq$35$\,$Myr, enabling $\sim$10% SMBH growth. A young, lopsided stellar component (${\rm log}\,M_\star/{\rm M}_\odot=7.5-9.3$) exerts torques on the molecular gas, likely driving the gas inflow. This young stellar component may serve as both a cause and a product of sustained gas funnelling towards the SMBH. These findings provide evidence for the sustained secular $m=1$ feeding mode at high BH accretion rates, linking kpc-scale gas dynamics to the black hole's sphere of influence. This mechanism, consistent with simulation predictions, may represent a key contributor to SMBH growth in luminous AGNs since cosmic noon.

 - **Abstract**
 Modelling the gravitational interaction between an eccentric perturber and a differentially shearing gas disc is a longstanding problem with various astrophysical applications, ranging from the evolution of planetary systems to the migration of black holes embedded in AGN discs. Recent work has promoted the use of a global, linear, modal approach for calculating the excited wake and the resulting feedback on the perturber's orbital evolution. In this work we perform a complementary suite of targeted hydrodynamic simulations to test this linear framework across a range of disc temperature and density profiles. In particular, we push from circular orbits to highly eccentric trajectories for which the perturber moves supersonically with respect to the background gas. We find remarkable agreement between our simulations and the linear methodology across a range of diagnostics -- lending support to the predicted wake morphologies, complex radial torque density profiles, and torque reversal phenomena, which occur when the eccentricity exceeds the local scale height. In contrast, comparison with previous fitting functions exposes noticeable discrepancies, cautioning against their indiscriminate use in studies which explore a wide range of perturber eccentricities, in varied disc structures. Our simulations also probe the fundamentally nonlinear effects of shock induced angular momentum deposition and coorbital horseshoe drags, which exhibit clear variations with eccentricity. Finally, this careful comparison between linear theory and numerics provides a detailed benchmark for planet-disc interaction problems and therefore we have provided a repository of our linear calculations for use as a rigorous test of future numerical investigations.
#### Gravity-sensitive Spectral Indices in Ultracool Dwarfs: Investigating Correlations with Metallicity and Planet Occurrence using SpeX and FIRE Observations

 - **Abstract**
 We present a near-infrared spectroscopic analysis (0.9-2.4 micron) of gravity indices for 57 ultracool dwarfs (spectral types M5.5 to L0), including exoplanet hosts TRAPPIST-1, SPECULOOS-2, SPECULOOS-3, and LHS 3154. Our dataset includes 61 spectra from the SpeX and FIRE spectrographs. Using gravity-sensitive indices such as FeH absorption (at 0.99, 1.20, and 1.55 microns), the VO band at 1.06 microns, the H-band continuum, and alkali lines like K I (at 1.17 and 1.25 microns), we investigate correlations between surface gravity, stellar metallicity, and the presence of close-in transiting planets. All four planet-hosting stars show intermediate-gravity spectral signatures despite indicators of field age. However, a volume-corrected logistic regression reveals no significant association between gravity class and planet occurrence. Among individual indices, FeH_z is the most promising tracer of planet-hosting status. We tentatively identify a correlation between FeH_z (0.99 micron) and planet presence at the 2-sigma level, though this may reflect observational biases including transit probability, small-number statistics, and detection sensitivity. More robustly, we find a significant anti-correlation between FeH_z and metallicity ([Fe/H]) at 3.3 sigma. A Kruskal-Wallis test shows no significant metallicity difference across gravity classes, suggesting the observed FeH_z-metallicity trend is not driven by bulk metallicity differences. We propose this anti-correlation reflects interplay between age, gravity, and composition: higher-metallicity objects may be systematically younger with lower gravities, suppressing FeH absorption. While our results only hint at a link between gravity-related characteristics and planet occurrence among late-M dwarfs, they underscore the need for caution when using spectral diagnostics to infer properties of planet-hosting ultracool dwarfs.

 - **Abstract**
 We use legacy data from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and the International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) to search for a spectral line from the spontaneous decay of axion-like particle (ALP) dark matter. The HST data consists of blank sky observations taken with the Faint Object Spectrograph in the 165-240~nm wavelength range, while the IUE data consists of observations of the Virgo Cluster obtained with the long- and short-wavelength spectrographs, covering 195-325~nm and 123-200~nm, respectively. We set a 95\% C.L. upper limit on the ALP-photon coupling $g_{a\gamma} < 10^{-11}~\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ across the full ALP mass range. Notably, we rule out values of $g_{a\gamma}$ above $1.6 \times 10^{-12}~\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ for ALP masses between 12.4 and 14.5\,eV, improving upon previous limits by an order of magnitude.

 - **Abstract**
 Interplanetary (IP) shock waves are greatly interesting, as they represent significant phenomena in near-Earth space and are direct drivers of geomagnetic and radiation storms. Moreover, various data and parameters are being explored for the identification and characterization of these waves. The spatial dimensions of shock waves vary significantly with the conditions and parameters of the propagating medium. For example, the radii of curvature of the shock wave fronts can vary by several hundred Earth radii or more in the inner heliosphere. In this study, we improved the semi-automated identification of shock waves by analyzing the solar wind and IP magnetic field (MF) parameters. More precisely, we analyzed the data recorded by the Proton Alpha Sensor of the Solar Wind Analyzer (SWA-PAS) and magnetometer (MAG) onboard the Solar Orbiter (SolO) mission. These data were collected and analyzed during the SolO journey around the Sun in 2023 at distances of 0.29...0.95 AU. Employing the developed algorithm, we identified over 40 IP-shock waves that occurred in 2023 using SWA-PAS and MAG. Additionally, we determined and presented a list of shock types and their basic parameters, kinetic and magnetohydrodynamic. The compression ratios, plasma beta ${\beta}_{us}$, angle between the shock normal and upstream MF ${\theta}{_B}{_n}$, Mach number, and others were among these parameters. Furthermore, we investigated the statistical distributions of the ${\theta}{_B}{_n}$ and ${\beta}_{us}$ parameters in the upstream region. Finally, the dependence of number of the identified shock waves as a function of the distance away from the Sun was explored; the number of shocks increased gradually with the increasing heliocentric distance.

 - **Abstract**
 Aims. We investigate the gas reservoirs, star formation (SF) properties, and environment of the ultra-diffuse galaxy GAMA526784 to understand its formation history, the efficiency of molecular gas conversion into stars, and the possible role of an interacting companion in shaping its morphology. Methods. We analyse low and high-resolution CO observations to constrain the molecular gas content, compare with HI data, and examine the SF efficiency of GAMA526784. The potential influence of a newly identified nearby dwarf galaxy is assessed using photometric and spatial information. Results. GAMA526784 exhibits a regular HI reservoir (M_HI/M* = 2.88) but only upper limits on its molecular gas mass (M_H2(5sigma)/M* < 0.23). The HI reservoir and CO non-detection can be explained by several mechanisms: (1) predominance of CO-dark H2, invisible to CO observations but contributing to SF; (2) a time delay in HI-to-H2 conversion following a recent interaction; or (3) elevated turbulence inhibiting gas collapse. An identified companion, found at a projected distance of 48 kpc, shows similar colours and lies in the direction of young star clusters in GAMA526784, indicating a possible association. We hypothesise this companion may have triggered the formation of star clusters in GAMA526784 through a high-velocity encounter. Conclusions. Our findings suggest GAMA526784 may have undergone an interaction that influenced its gas reservoirs and SF activity. The presence of a nearby companion agrees with predictions of a high-speed encounter, potentially offering a rare example of such an interaction in progress. We suggest this encounter may have shaped the system's recent evolution. Future observations, particularly targeting molecular gas tracers beyond CO and resolved HI maps, will be crucial in determining the extent of GAMA526784's cold gas reservoir and the nature of its recent star formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Follow-up observations of neutrino events have been a promising method for identifying sources of very-high-energy cosmic rays. Neutrinos are unambiguous tracers of hadronic interactions and cosmic rays. On June 15, 2020, IceCube detected a neutrino event with an 82.8% probability of being astrophysical in origin. To identify the astrophysical source of the neutrino, we used X-ray tiling observations to identify potential counterpart sources. We performed additional multiwavelength follow-up with NuSTAR and the VLA in order to construct a broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) of the most likely counterpart. From the SED, we calculate an estimate for the neutrinos we expect to detect from the source. While the source does not have a high predicted neutrino flux, it is still a plausible neutrino emitter. It is important to note that the other bright X-ray candidate sources consistent with the neutrino event are also radio-quiet AGN. A statistical analysis shows that 1RXS J093117.6+033146 is the most likely counterpart (87.5%) if the neutrino is cosmic in origin and if it is among X-ray detectable sources. This results adds to previous results suggesting a connection between radio-quiet AGN and IceCube neutrino events.

 - **Abstract**
 Red clump (RC) stars are reliable standard candles for studying the structure and evolution of the Milky Way. In this study, we present empirical calibrations of RC absolute magnitudes in the Mephisto (v, g, r, i) and CSST (g, r, i) photometric systems using a high-purity sample of 25,059 RC stars cross-matched between APOGEE and Gaia DR3 XP spectra. Through synthetic photometry and polynomial fitting, we find that RC absolute magnitudes exhibit strong dependencies on effective temperature and metallicity, with the strongest variations observed in bluer bands and progressively decreasing towards redder wavelengths. In particular, the Mephisto v band exhibits the highest sensitivity, with variations reaching up to 2.0 mag across the metallicity range (-1.0 dex <[Fe/H] <0.5 dex) and the temperature range (4500-5200 K). The calibrations achieve high precision for all bands, enabling accurate determination of RC absolute magnitudes and distances. Furthermore, we evaluate the metallicity estimation capabilities of both systems using a Random Forest-based method, achieving a precision of 0.12 dex for Mephisto and 0.14 dex for CSST under typical photometric uncertainties (< 0.01 mag). These results provide robust tools for distance and metallicity determinations, supporting future Galactic structure studies with Mephisto and CSST data.
#### The unusual spectrum of the X-ray transient source XRISM J174610.8-290021 near the Galactic center

 - **Abstract**
 The Galactic center region was observed with the XRISM X-ray observatory during the performance verification phase in 2024 and a point-like X-ray source was detected with the X-ray imager Xtend at a position of (RA, Dec)=(17h46m10.8s, -29°00'21''), which is thus named XRISM J174610.8-290021. This source was bright in February to March and showed time variations in count rate by more than one order of magnitude in one week. The 2-10 keV X-ray luminosity was ~$10^{35}$ erg/s for the assumed distance of 8 kpc. However, after six months, it was below the detection limit. We found a hint of periodicity of 1537 s from timing analysis. The XRISM/Xtend spectrum has emission lines from helium-like iron (Fe He$\alpha$) at 6.7 keV and hydrogen-like iron (Fe Ly$\alpha$) at 6.97 keV; their intensity ratio is unusual with the latter being four times stronger than the former. If the emission is of thermal origin, the ionization temperature estimated from the iron-line intensity ratio is ~30 keV, which is inconsistent with the electron temperature estimated from the thermal bremsstrahlung, ~7 keV. Spectral models of magnetic cataclysmic variables, which are often seen in the Galactic center in this luminosity range, are found to fail to reproduce the obtained spectrum. By contrast, we found that the spectrum is well reproduced with the models of low-mass X-ray binaries containing a neutron star plus two narrow Gaussian lines. We consider that the source is intrinsically bright reaching $10^{37}$ erg/s, but is blocked from direct view due to a high inclination and only the scattered emission is visible. The photoionized plasma above the accretion disk with an ionization parameter of ~$10^{5}$ may explain the unusual iron line ratio. We further discuss the potential contribution of point sources of the type of XRISM J174610.8-290021 to the diffuse Galactic center X-ray emission.

 - **Abstract**
 Molecular gas plays a critical role in regulating star formation and nuclear activity in galaxies. Sulphur bearing molecules, such as H2S, are sensitive to the physical and chemical environments in which they reside and are potential tracers of shocked, dense gas in galactic outflows and active galactic nuclei (AGN). We aim to investigate the origin of H2S emission and its relation to dense gas and outflow activity in the central regions of nearby infrared luminous galaxies. We present ALMA Band 5 observations of the ortho H2S 1(1,0) 1(0,1) transition in three nearby galaxies: NGC 1377, NGC 4418, and NGC 1266. We perform radiative transfer modelling using RADEX to constrain the physical conditions of the H2S emitting gas and compare the results to ancillary CO and continuum data. We detect compact H2S emission in all three galaxies, arising from regions smaller than approximately 150 parsecs. The H2S spectral profiles exhibit broad line wings, suggesting an association with outflowing or shocked gas. In NGC 4418, H2S also appears to be tracing gas that is counterrotating. A peculiar red shifted emission feature may correspond to inflowing gas, or possibly a slanted outflow. RADEX modelling indicates that the H2S emitting gas has high densities (molecular hydrogen density greater than 10^7 cm^-3) and moderately warm temperatures (between 40 and 200 Kelvin). The derived densities exceed those inferred from CO observations, implying that H2S traces denser regions of the interstellar medium.

 - **Abstract**
 We have surveyed all conventional methods proposed or conceivable for obtaining resolved images of an Earth-like exoplanet. Generating a 10x10 pixel map of a 1 R_Earth world at 10 pc demands ~0.85 uas angular resolution and photon collection sufficient for SNR >= 5 per "micro-pixel". We derived diffraction-limit and photon-budget requirements for: (1) large single-aperture space telescopes with internal coronagraphs; (2) external starshades; (3) space-based interferometry (nulling and non-nulling); (4) ground-based extremely large telescopes with extreme adaptive optics; (5) pupil-densified "hypertelescopes"; (6) indirect reconstructions (rotational light-curve inversion, eclipse mapping, intensity interferometry); and (7) diffraction occultation by Solar System bodies. Even though these approaches serve their primary goals - exoplanet discovery and initial coarse characterization - each remains orders of magnitude away from delivering a spatially resolved image. In every case, technology readiness falls short, and fundamental barriers leave them 2-5 orders of magnitude below the astrometric resolution and photon-budget thresholds needed to map an Earth analog even on decadal timescales. Ultimately, an in situ platform delivered to <= 0.1 AU of the target could, in principle, overcome both diffraction and photon-starvation limits - but such a mission far exceeds current propulsion, autonomy, and communications capabilities. By contrast, the Solar Gravitational Lens - providing on-axis gain of ~1e10 and inherent uas-scale focusing once a spacecraft reaches >=550 AU - remains the only near-term, scientifically and technologically viable means to acquire true, resolved surface images and spatially resolved spectroscopy of Earth-like exoplanets in our stellar neighborhood.
#### Evidence of Time-Dependent Diffusive Shock Acceleration in the 2022 September 5 Solar Energetic Particle Event

 - **Abstract**
 On 2022 September 5, a large solar energetic particle (SEP) event was detected by Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and Solar Orbiter (SolO), at heliocentric distances of 0.07 and 0.71 au, respectively. PSP observed an unusual velocity-dispersion signature: particles below $\sim$1 MeV exhibited a normal velocity dispersion, while higher-energy particles displayed an inverse velocity arrival feature, with the most energetic particles arriving later than those at lower energies. The maximum energy increased from about 20-30 MeV upstream to over 60 MeV downstream of the shock. The arrival of SEPs at PSP was significantly delayed relative to the expected onset of the eruption. In contrast, SolO detected a typical large SEP event characterized by a regular velocity dispersion at all energies up to 100 MeV. To understand these features, we simulate particle acceleration and transport from the shock to the observers with our newly developed SEP model - Particle ARizona and MIchigan Solver on Advected Nodes (PARMISAN). Our results reveal that the inverse velocity arrival and delayed particle onset detected by PSP originate from the time-dependent diffusive shock acceleration processes. After shock passage, PSP's magnetic connectivity gradually shifted due to its high velocity near perihelion, detecting high-energy SEPs streaming sunward. Conversely, SolO maintained a stable magnetic connection to the strong shock region where efficient acceleration was achieved. These results underscore the importance of spatial and temporal dependence in SEP acceleration at interplanetary shocks, and provide new insights to understand SEP variations in the inner heliosphere.

 - **Abstract**
 Between 1987 and 2023 we carried out single-dish monitoring campaigns of water-maser emission at 22 GHz in the circumstellar envelopes (CSEs) of four stars: RCas, oCet, RLeo and ChiCyg. The variability in integrated flux in RCas and oCet followed that in the optical with the same period, but with a lag of about one-third in phase. RLeo was too often below our sensitivity threshold for us to determine a radio period. No maser was detected in ChiCyg. The variability in the masers in RCas has a distinctive pattern that confirms the existence of a zone in the CSE with favourable conditions for maser excitation. The total flux, modulated by the pulsations of the star, gradually increases to a maximum, which is followed by a similar decrease. This takes about 20 years. The pattern is repeated after an interval of quiescence of several years. During its decline, the variation in the flux resembles a damped harmonic oscillator. There are two dominant emission components that move almost tangentially on either side of the star with respect to the observer. The redshifted one is consistent with an origin in a single cloud that lived for at least about eight years, falling back towards the star. The blue component, moving in the CSE hemisphere nearest to us, has no drift in the line-of-sight velocity and appears to originate in a time series of short-living clouds with line-of-sight velocities within ca. 1 km/s of each other. No systematic drifts are found in RLeo and oCet. A few bursts of emission were detected in RCas and RLeo that lasted about a year and caused an increase in the flux density by 1-2 orders of magnitude. The velocity range of the maser emission is < 10 km/s and is clearly correlated with the bolometric luminosity of the stars.

 - **Abstract**
 The study of the evolution of Martian atmosphere and its response to EUV irradiation is an extremely important topic in planetary science. One of the dominant effects of atmospheric losses is the photochemical escape of atomic oxygen from Mars. Increasing the magnitude of the irradiation changes the response of the atmosphere. The purpose of the current paper is to analyze the effects of enhanced EUV irradiation on the escape rates of oxygen atoms. We have used the solar flare of 2017 September 10 as the baseline flare intensity and varied the intensity of the flare from a factor of 3 up to 10 times the baseline flare. We see an increase in the escape flux by 40% for flares up to 5x the intensity of the baseline flare. However, beyond this point, the increase in escape flux tapers off, reaching only about 17% above the baseline. At 10x the baseline flare intensity, the escape flux decreases by nearly 25% compared to the escape rate of the original flare. We also found that the total escape amount of hot O peaks at 7x the original flare intensity. Additionally, we have studied the effects of the time scales over which the flare energy is delivered. We find that energy dissipative processes like radiative cooling and thermal collisions do not come into play instantaneously. The escape flux from higher intensity flares dominate initially, but as time progresses, energy dissipative processes have a significant effect on the escape rate.

 - **Abstract**
 The Lobster Eye Imager for Astronomy (LEIA), as a pathfinder of the Wide-field X-ray Telescope (WXT) onboard the Einstein Probe (EP) satellite, is the first lobster-eye focusing X-ray telescope with a considerably large field-of-view (FoV) ever flown. During the two and half years of operations, a series of calibration observations were performed, to fully characterize its performance and calibrate the instrumental properties. In this paper, we present the results of the in-flight calibration campaign of LEIA, focusing on the properties of the PSF, source positional accuracy, effective area, energy response and the instrumental background. The calibration sources used are the Crab nebula, Sco X-1 and Cassiopeia A supernova remnant. Specifically, it is found that the spatial resolution remains almost unchanged compared to the pre-launch values, ranging from 3.6'-9.3' with a median of 5.9'. The post-calibration source positional accuracy is found to be ~2' (at the 90% C.L.). The Crab spectra can be well reproduced by the absorbed power-law model with the best-fit parameters in large agreement with the literature values, indicating that the in-orbit effective area is overall consistent with the model predictions and ground measurements. The effective area exhibits a systematic of $\lesssim10\%$ (at the 68% C.L.), and a mild deterioration of ~15% at the lower energy end after one year of operation. The Cas A spectral analysis shows that the energy scale and spectral resolution of the detectors are generally consistent with ground values. The instrumental background is found to be largely consistent among the four detectors, with strong modulations by the geomagnetic activity and the spectrum qualitatively consistent with our previous simulations. These instrumental performances well meet the design requirements. This work paves the way for the in-orbit calibration of the EP-WXT.

 - **Abstract**
 Lyman-$ \alpha $ emission, which owing to its resonant nature strongly couples the emergent line profile to gas kinematics, has become a key observable for probing outflows from star-forming galaxies in the early universe. Typically, Lyman-$ \alpha $ profiles are explained in terms of idealised expanding shell models, while empirically-motivated interpretations of Lyman-$ \alpha $ profiles that make use of comparisons with kinematics revealed by other spectral features (e.g. metal emission and absorption lines) are limited. Here, we analyse the kinematics of emission/absorption lines in the spectra of 338 gravitationally-lensed Lyman-$ \alpha $ sources revealed via blind spectroscopy of galaxy clusters with the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE). Using metal emission lines to measure systemic redshifts, we confirm that the Lyman-$ \alpha $ profiles are consistent with outflowing gas. In cases where interstellar metal absorption lines are detected, we find their kinematics and line ratios to be indicative of clumpy outflows. We investigate the differences between sources with single- and double-peaked Lyman-$ \alpha $ profiles, finding the latter to drive weaker outflows yet show spectral signatures suggestive of younger stellar ages ($ < 4\,$Myr compared with $ > 20\,$Myr for sources with single-peaked Lyman-$ \alpha $ profiles). We argue that double-peaked Lyman-$ \alpha $ profiles may reflect weaker feedback in extremely young starbursts due to the delayed onset of supernova explosions. We also investigate whether outflow properties can be reliably inferred by fitting simple expanding shell models. We find that these models yield unphysical parameters in many cases even when they can reproduce the Lyman-$ \alpha $ profiles to high precision, and urge caution when inferring outflow properties from such models.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultrahot Jupiters are predicted to show inverted temperature-pressure (T-P) profiles in the presence of optical absorbers such as TiO and VO. An inverted T-P profile of KELT-7b was recently detected, in line with these predictions, but such diagnoses are known to be model-dependent. We used CHEOPS, TESS, and literature data to characterize the atmosphere of KELT-7b, reassess its T-P profile, measure its albedo, and search for distortions in its CHEOPS transit light curve due to stellar rotation. We jointly fitted CHEOPS and TESS data to measure the occultation depths and modeled CHEOPS transits including gravity darkening. Emission and transmission retrievals were performed, and the albedo was calculated in the CHEOPS and TESS passbands. Thermochemical-equilibrium retrievals yield a non-inverted T-P profile, while free-chemistry retrievals yield an inverted profile with likely unphysical TiO/VO abundances. A 3D GCM supports a TiO-driven inversion. We report a low geometric albedo of $A_\mathrm{g} = 0.05 \pm 0.06$, consistent with inefficient heat redistribution and supported by a GCM with magnetic drag. CHEOPS data provide no constraint on the sky-projected orbital obliquity. Retrieval results strongly depend on the chemical framework. Free-chemistry fits are better but risk unphysical solutions for ultrahot Jupiters. We applied a coherent stellar variability correction to CHEOPS and TESS data; future observations would benefit from similar treatment.

 - **Abstract**
 We present ALMA CO(1-0) and CO(3-2) observations of a powerful young radio galaxy, PKS 0023-26, hosted by a far-infrared bright galaxy. The galaxy has a luminous optical AGN and a very extended distribution of molecular gas. We used these observations (together with available CO(2-1) data) to trace the impact of the AGN across the extent of the radio emission and beyond on scales of a few kpc. Despite the strength of the optical AGN, the kinematics of the cold molecular gas is strongly affected only in the central kpc, and is more weakly affected around the northern lobe. We found other signatures of the substantial impact of the radio AGN, however. Most notably, extreme line ratios of the CO transitions in a region aligned with the radio axis indicate conditions very different from those observed in the undisturbed gas at large radii. The non-detection of CO(1-0) at the location of the core of the radio source implies extreme conditions at this location. Furthermore, on the scale of a few kpc, the cold molecular gas appears to be wrapped around the northern radio lobe. This suggests that a strong jet-cloud interaction has depleted the northern lobe of molecular gas, perhaps as a result of the hot wind behind the jet-induced shock that shreds the clouds via hydrodynamic instabilities. The higher gas velocity dispersion and molecular excitation that we observed close to this location may then be the result of a milder interaction in which the expanding jet cocoon induces turbulence in the surrounding interstellar medium. These results highlight that the impact of an AGN can manifest itself not only in the kinematics of the gas, but also in molecular line ratios and in the distribution of the gas. Although the radio plasma and the cold molecular gas are clearly coupled, the kinetic energy that is transferred to the ISM is only a small fraction of the energy available from the AGN.

 - **Abstract**
 Radio pulsating white dwarf (WD) systems, known as WD pulsars, are non-accreting binary systems where the rapidly spinning WD interacts with a low-mass companion producing pulsed non-thermal emission that can be observed across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Only two such systems are known: AR Sco and eRASSU J191213.9$-$441044. Here we present the discovery of a third WD pulsar, SDSS J230641.47$+$244055.8. The optical spectrum is dominated by molecular bands from an M-dwarf companion, with additional narrow emission lines from the Balmer series and He I. The long-term optical light-curve folded on its orbital period ($P_\mathrm{orb} = 3.49$ h) exhibits large scatter (roughly 10 per cent). High-cadence photometry reveals a short period signal, which we interpret to be the spin period of the WD primary ($P_\mathrm{spin} \simeq 92$ s). The WD spin period is slightly shorter than that of AR Sco ($\rm \sim 117$ s), the WD pulsar prototype. Time-resolved spectroscopy reveals emission from the irradiated companion and Na I absorption lines approximately tracing its centre of mass, which yields a binary mass function of $f(M) \simeq 0.2 {\rm M_\odot}$. The H$\alpha$ emission includes a low-amplitude broad component, resembling the energetic emission line flashes seen in AR Sco. Using spectral templates, we classify the companion to be most likely a $\rm M4.0\pm 0.5$ star with $T_\mathrm{\rm eff} \approx 3300$ K. Modelling the stellar contribution constrains the secondary mass ($0.19\,{\rm M_\odot}\lesssim M_2\lesssim 0.28\,{\rm M_\odot}$), system distance ($\simeq1.25\,{\rm kpc}$), and inclination ($i \simeq 45-50^\circ$). We discuss the proposed evolutionary scenarios and summarize the observational properties of all three known WD pulsars, establishing a benchmark for identifying and classifying future members of this emerging class.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper provides an overview of the spectroscopic data obtained by the JWST Guaranteed Time Observations (GTO) program 1192, "The Physics and Chemistry of PDR Fronts", including an inventory of the spatially resolved dust, gas, and molecular content in the Horsehead nebula and the NW filament of NGC~7023. We demonstrate the unique capability of this high spatial resolution data set to elucidate the evolution of gas and dust at the interface between stars and their natal clouds at the scale at which the physics and chemistry occur. The Disassociation Regions (PDRs) in the Horsehead nebula and the North West (NW) filament of NGC 7023 were mapped with a spectral resolution 1000-3000 and a spatial resolution of ~2e-4 pc between 0.97-28um. Spectra extracted from template regions yield a large number of atomic, ionized, and molecular lines. Full line lists and extracted spectra for all 10 regions are provided through CDS. Absorption from H$_2$O, CO$_2$, and CO ices are identified in 3 regions in NGC 7023. In this overview, we have focused on the spectral region between 3 and 5 um which is dominated by emission from aromatic and aliphatic carbon bonds to illustrate the power of the data set. We confirm the entrainment of aromatic carbonaceous species in the photo-evaporative flow from the PDR surface into the H\,{\sc{ii}} region in the Horsehead. No aliphatic emission is present in the outflow, indicating the complete removal of aliphatic bonds when exposed to strong UV fields. There is a clear detection of deuterium substitution in the carbon bonds. Aliphatic D-substitution is more efficient relative to aromatic D-substitution, ranging from N$_{D}$/N$_{H}$ ~ 0.1-0.3 for aliphatics compared to ~0.03 for the aromatics.

 - **Abstract**
 We present observations of HCN J=4-3 and HCO^+ J=4-3 lines obtained with the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope as part of the MALATANG survey, combined with archival HCN J=1-0 and HCO^+ J=1-0 data from the Green Bank Telescope, to study the spatial distribution and excitation conditions of dense molecular gas in the disk of M82. We detect HCN J=4-3 and HCO^+ J=4-3 emission within the central region (< 500 pc) of the galaxy, while the J=1-0 emission lines exhibit a more extended spatial distribution (> 700 pc). The dense gas shows a clear double-lobed structure in both spatial distribution and kinematics, with the HCN and HCO^+ J=4-3 lines in the southwest lobe blueshifted by ~ 40 km/s relative to the J=1-0 lines. The HCN J=4-3/1-0 and HCO^+ J=4-3/1-0 line-luminosity ratios range from 0.09 to 0.53 and from 0.14 to 0.87, respectively, with mean values of 0.18 +/- 0.04 and 0.36 +/- 0.06. The HCN ratio is lower than the typical average observed in nearby star-forming galaxies, whereas the HCO^+ ratio is comparatively higher, suggesting that the high-J HCN emission in M82 is significantly sub-thermally excited. Spatially, the peak values of the J=4-3/1-0 ratios are found in the northwest region of M82, coinciding with the galaxy-scale outflow. Elevated HCN/HCO^+ ratios are also detected in roughly the same area, potentially tracing local excitation enhancements driven by the outflow. The HCN/HCO^+ J=4-3 ratio across all detected regions ranges from 0.19 to 1.07 with a mean value of 0.41 +/- 0.11, which is significantly lower than the average J=1-0 ratio of 0.76 +/- 0.08. Both ratios are significantly lower than the average values observed in nearby star-forming galaxies, which could be related to the relatively low gas density and the presence of an extended photo-dissociation region in M82.

 - **Abstract**
 The magnetic fields and dynamical processes in the solar polar regions play a crucial role in the solar magnetic cycle and in supplying mass and energy to the fast solar wind, ultimately being vital in controlling solar activities and driving space weather. Despite numerous efforts to explore these regions, to date no imaging observations of the Sun's poles have been achieved from vantage points out of the ecliptic plane, leaving their behavior and evolution poorly understood. This observation gap has left three top-level scientific questions unanswered, 1) How does the solar dynamo work and drive the solar magnetic cycle? 2) What drives the fast solar wind? 3) How do space weather processes globally originate from the Sun and propagate throughout the solar system? The Solar Polar-orbit Observatory (SPO) mission, a solar polar exploration spacecraft, is proposed to address these three unanswered scientific questions by imaging the Sun's poles from high heliolatitudes. In order to achieve its scientific goals, SPO will carry six remote-sensing and four in-situ instruments to measure the vector magnetic fields and Doppler velocity fields in the photosphere, to observed the Sun in the extreme ultraviolet, X-ray, and radio wavelengths, to image the corona and the heliosphere up to 45 $R_\odot$, and to perform in-situ detection of magnetic fields, and low- and high-energy particles in the solar wind.

 - **Abstract**
 Symbiotic stars, binary pairs with a cool giant fueling accretion onto a hot compact companion, offer unique insights to our understanding of stellar evolution. Yet, only a few hundred symbiotic stars are confirmed. Here, we report on a new search for symbiotic star candidates in Gaia Data Release 3 (GDR3), based entirely on the archive's astrometric, photometric, and spectroscopic information. To begin our search, we identified known symbiotic stars in GDR3 and assessed their absolute magnitude and colors, which are dominated by the cool giant. We also considered measures of astrometric quality that might be affected by binary motion in these systems. Finally, from those sources with Gaia spectroscopic data, we built a low-resolution spectral template that characterizes the unique features of these systems, including H$\alpha$ emission from interaction with the giant's wind and radiation from the hot star. We then queried the full GDR3 archive for sources with spectroscopic data that are bright (< 17 mag in G-band), have modest relative parallax uncertainties (< 20%), and fall within a region of color-magnitude space characteristic of red giants, keeping only sources with spectra that quantitatively match our template. A machine-learning algorithm, trained on known symbiotic stars, produced a new catalog of 1,674 sources. From cross-matches with infrared and X-ray surveys, we present 25 of these sources as particularly compelling candidates for new symbiotic stars.

 - **Abstract**
 We consider dynamics and multi-frequency emission patterns of relativistic van Allen belts - particles trapped in the magnetosphere of neutron stars and white dwarths. We account for synchrotron radiative losses and effects of relativistic beaming of radiation. The system is non-Hamiltonian (non-energy conserving): this results in a wide non-scalable variety of spectral and temporal behaviors. There are three types of trapped particles' trajectories: (i) oscillating (particles experience multiple bounces between magnetic bottles); (ii) precipitating (particles fall onto the star with finite transverse momentum); (iii) freezing (particles lose their transverse motion before falling onto the star). The separation between regimes (i) and (ii) depends both on the ratio of the bounce time to cooling time at magnetic equator $\tau_{ 0} $, $\eta _0 = R_0/( c \tau_0) \leq 1$, as well as the initial pitch angle $\alpha_0$; regimes (i) and (ii) are separated at $ \alpha_{0, crit} \sim \eta_0^{3/10}$. Resulting emission patterns show large variety: single or double peaked, and/or flat hat with sharp walls. Multi-frequency profiles - in optical and X-ray bands - can be used to get information about physical (magnetic field strength, injection point) and geometrical (dipolar angle and the line of sight) properties.

 - **Abstract**
 We have developed a lightweight tool {\tt RapidGBM}, featured by a web-based interface and capabilities of rapid calculation of Fermi-GBM visibilities and performing basic data analysis. It has two key features: (1) immediately check the visibility of Fermi-GBM for new transients, and (2) check the light curve and perform spectral analysis after the hourly TTE data is released. The visibility check and the response matrix generation required for spectral analysis can be achieved through the historical pointing file after the orbit calculation, even when the real-time pointing file is not yet available. As a case, we apply the tool to EP240617a, an X-ray transient triggered by Einstein Probe (EP). We demonstrate the workflow of visibility checking, data processing, and spectral analysis for this event. The results suggest that EP240617a can be classified as an X-ray-rich GRB (XRR) and confirm the feasibility of using historical pointing files for rapid analysis. Further, we discuss possible physical interpretations of such events, including implications for jet launching and progenitor scenarios. Therefore, {\tt RapidGBM} is expected to assist Einstein Probe Transient Advocates (EP-TAs), Space-based multi-band astronomical Variable Objects Monitor Burst Advocates (SVOM-BAs), and other members of the community in cross-checking high-energy transients. Based on prompt emission parameter relations (e.g. $E_{\rm p}$-$E_{\gamma,\rm iso}$), it can also help identify peculiar GRBs (e.g. long-short burst, magnetar giant flare, etc.) and and provide useful references (e.g. more accurate $T_0$) for scheduling follow-up observations.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first lattice simulations of the nonlinear evolution after axion inflation by self-consistently incorporating currents arising from Schwinger pair production. The tachyonically amplified gauge fields trigger the growth of Schwinger currents, leading to universal values for the conductivity and magnetic field at the onset of strong backreaction and subsequent quenching of gauge field production. We show that the Schwinger effect (prematurely) saturates gauge field production, thereby diminishing the prospects of axion inflation magnetogenesis as a viable solution for blazar observations.

 - **Abstract**
 The delayed conversion of a neutron star (NS) into a highly magnetized hybrid star (HS) ejects ~ 0.01Msun of outer NS layers with kinetic energy ~ 10^50 erg (Keranen et al. 2005); the Quark-Nova (QN) ejecta. If this occurs in isolation (or after the SN ejecta had dissipated), the rotational energy of the HS powers a transient with rise and decay times of a few days, consistent with Luminous Fast Blue Optical Transients (LFBOTs) (Ouyed 2025). Breakup of the QN ejecta creates optically thin fragments that release trapped radiation over tens of minutes timescales, producing optical flares with luminosities comparable to the LFBOT peak value. X-ray emission arises from HS spin-down energy leaking through the gradually transparent ejecta, while radio emission is due to synchrotron radiation from the ejecta's interaction with the ambient medium. Our model reproduces key features of AT2022tsd and other LFBOTs, including AT2020xnd, AT2020mrf, and AT2018cow. Flares are absent or dwarfed when fragmentation occurs before or during the LFBOT peak emission phase, as likely in AT2018cow. Our model provides a novel explanation for aged NSs with long spin periods that exhibit youthful magnetar-like activity, such as ASKAP J1832-0911 (Wang et al. 2024). It also carries implications for heavy-element enrichment in the universe, given the formation rate of LFBOTs and the neutron-rich composition of the QN ejecta (Jaikumar et al. 2007, Ouyed et al. 2009).

 - **Abstract**
 We present a 6GHz radio continuum image of the galaxy cluster Abell 2744 ($z = 0.307$) obtained with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) as part of the VLA Frontier Fields program, whose goal is to explore the radio continuum emission from high-redshift galaxies that are magnified by foreground, massive galaxy clusters. With an rms noise of $\approx 1 \mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$, at the phase center, and sub-arcsec angular resolution ($\theta_{1/2}=0.82$ arcsec), this is the deepest and most detailed radio image of Abell 2744 ever obtained. A total of 93 sources are detected with a peak signal-to-noise ratio $\geq5$, of which 46 have optical/near-infrared (IR) counterparts with available redshift, magnification ($\mu$), and stellar mass (${M}_*$) estimates. The radio sources are distributed over a redshift from 0.15 to 3.55, with a median redshift value of $z = 0.93$, and a median stellar mass of ${M}_{*}= 2.3 \times 10^{10}\,\rm{M}_{\odot}$. A comparison between the radio-based star formation rates (SFRs) and those derived from ultraviolet-to-near IR data reveals that the radio SFRs are, on average, an order of magnitude higher than the ultraviolet-to-near IR SFRs. We look for radio counterparts of the so-called "Little Red Dots (LRDs)'' galaxies at $z\approx6$ in Abell 2744, but find no significant detections. After stacking, we derive a 3$\sigma$ upper limit to the 6GHz radio luminosity of LRDs of $4.1\times 10^{39}\,\rm erg\,s^{-1}$. Finally, we present a sample of 22 moderately/strongly lensed galaxies ($\mu \gtrsim 2$) in the VLA Frontier Fields survey, which is adequate to zoom into star formation processes of main sequence galaxies at $z\approx 1-2$.

 - **Abstract**
 The interpretation of the ultra-high-energy cosmic ray spectrum (UHECRs) and composition suggests a suppression of the flux below $\sim$1 EeV, as observed by the Pierre Auger Observatory and Telescope Array. A natural explanation for this phenomenon involves magnetic confinement effects. We investigate the possibility that UHECRs self-generate the magnetic turbulence necessary for such confinement via current-driven plasma instabilities. Specifically, we show that the electric current produced by escaping UHECRs can excite a non-resonant streaming instability in the surrounding plasma. This instability reduces the diffusion coefficient in the source environment, effectively trapping particles with energies $E \lesssim 0.6$ EeV $\mathcal{L}_{45}^{1/2} R_{\text{Mpc}}^{-1} \lambda_{10}^{2}$ for times exceeding the age of the Universe. Here, $\mathcal{L}_{45}$ is the source luminosity in units of $10^{45}$ erg/s, $R_{\text{Mpc}}$ is the radial size in Mpc, and $\lambda_{10}$ is the intergalactic magnetic field coherence length in units of 10 Mpc. We discuss in detail the conditions, in terms of source luminosity, initial magnetic field, and the environment in which this phenomenon occurs, that need to be fulfilled in order for self-confinement to take place near a source of UHECRs. By modeling a population of UHECR sources with a luminosity function typical of extragalactic gamma-ray sources, we connect the spectrum of escaping particles to the luminosity distribution. Furthermore, we calculate the contribution of these confined particles to cosmogenic neutrino production, finding consistency with current observational constraints. Our results suggest that self-induced turbulence may play an important role in shaping the UHECR spectrum and, in particular, may account for the flux suppression near their sources, offering a promising framework for interpreting current observations.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the impact of dark matter (DM) annihilation on the global 21-cm signal during the dark ages and cosmic dawn eras. The 21-cm line provides a complementary probe for studying the nature of dark matter beyond standard cosmological observables. In the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework, the expected absorption amplitude of the dark ages global 21-cm signal is approximately $-42\, \rm mK$. However, energy injection from DM annihilation can significantly heat and ionize the intergalactic medium, potentially altering or even erasing this absorption feature. We evaluate the thermal and ionization history of the gas to derive an upper bound on $f_\chi^2 \langle \sigma v \rangle / M_\chi$ using the dark ages signal, which is free from astrophysical uncertainties. After incorporating observational and theoretical uncertainties arising from future lunar-based experiments and variations in cosmological parameters, respectively -- we obtain a conservative upper limit of $f_\chi^2\langle\sigma v\rangle/M_\chi \lesssim 10^{-28}~\rm cm^3\,s^{-1}\,\rm GeV^{-1}$. This constraint is nearly an order of magnitude stronger than the bounds derived from Planck 2018 data.
