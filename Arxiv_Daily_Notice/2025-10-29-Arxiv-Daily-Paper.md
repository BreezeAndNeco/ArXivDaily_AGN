#### The case for an Astrometric Mission Extension of Euclid. Extending Gaia by 6 magnitudes with Euclid covering one-third of the sky

 - **Abstract**
 The nominal duration of Euclid's main mission is six years, but current best estimates indicate that the observatory has sufficient propellant to operate for up to ~14 years in total. In this work, we advocate dedicating six of these ~8 additional years to repeating the main survey, covering approximately one-third of the sky. This repetition would not only improve the sampling, signal-to-noise, quality, and depth of the survey, but -- most importantly -- would provide a six-year time baseline between two epochs if executed in the same sequence. The availability of multiple epochs would enable the derivation of proper motions for stars as faint as V~27, i.e., more than five magnitudes fainter than those measured by the Gaia mission. Although it may seem early to propose such a mission extension, in this work we quantitatively illustrate its immense scientific potential. We therefore intend to initiate the technical and scientific discussions early to ensure optimal planning. The here proposed extension would employ only the VIS channel -- owing to its superior astrometric capability and depth -- while simultaneously using NISP in slitless-spectroscopy mode to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of first-epoch spectra that would also benefit of proper motions to identify and reject objects within the local Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Merging galaxy clusters exhibit strong observational evidence for efficient particle acceleration in the intracluster medium (ICM), particularly in the form of synchrotron-emitting radio relics and halos. Cosmic ray (CR) electrons are likely accelerated (or re-accelerated) at merger and accretion shocks via diffusive shock acceleration (DSA). However, in the presence of the large diffusion coefficients one would naively expect in the rarefied, relatively unmagnetized ICM, this acceleration--in particular, the maximum proton energy ($E_{\rm max}$)--is limited by long acceleration times. On the other hand, recent work on CR transport suggests that the diffusion coefficient can be suppressed in ICM-like environments. In this picture, deviations from local thermodynamic equilibrium can trigger the mirror instability, creating plasma-scale magnetic structures, or "micromirrors," that efficiently scatter CRs. In this paper, we investigate the implications of micromirror confinement for shock acceleration in the ICM. We demonstrate that micromirrors enforce a minimum value of $E_{\rm max} \gtrsim 100$ GeV that does not rely on CR-driven magnetic field amplification. We also discuss micromirror confinement in the context of cosmological simulations and $\gamma$-ray observations, and present a simulation of a Coma-like merging cluster that self-consistently includes CR acceleration at shocks, with an effective diffusion coefficient set by micromirrors. We show that the introduction of micromirrors yields simulated galaxy clusters that remain consistent with $\gamma$-ray observations.
#### Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, Roman Sees Where You Are: Predicting Exoplanet Transit Yields in the Rosette Nebula with the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope

 - **Abstract**
 Young stars host only a small fraction of the known exoplanet population because their photometric variability, magnetic activity, and frequent placement in dense, poorly-resolved regions hamper exoplanet detections. Yet, measuring planets at these ages is crucial since these phases are when dynamical processes that drive planetary migration are most active. We assess the expected yield of a hypothetical Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope transit survey of the Rosette Nebula, a $\sim10\,\mathrm{Myr}$ star-forming region with a dense and diverse stellar population. Using the Roman Exposure Time Calculator to quantify sensitivity to Rosette members, we establish detection thresholds for companions and evaluate yields via Monte Carlo injection-recovery simulations. We predict the detection of $33 \pm 9$ young transiting exoplanets orbiting stellar hosts in a month-long survey, and $29 \pm 8$ in a two-week survey. The extended baseline primarily improves sensitivity to longer-period planets orbiting FGK stars, while most M dwarf detections are well-sampled within two weeks. Irrespective of the temporal baseline, transit detections are dominated by of 1-2\,$R_\oplus$ super-Earths and sub-Neptunes with $P\lesssim8$\,days. Such a sample would substantially expand the census of only three detected planets younger than $20\,\mathrm{Myr}$, probing an age regime in which planetary radii remain inflated, the stability of close-in orbits is uncertain, and planetary migration may still be ongoing. This survey offers a path to constrain early planetary evolution and establish prime follow-up targets for the James Webb Space Telescope, Vera Rubin Observatory, and the Habitable Worlds Observatory.
#### AT2025ulz and S250818k: Leveraging DESI spectroscopy in the hunt for a kilonova associated with a sub-solar mass gravitational wave candidate

 - **Abstract**
 On August 18th, 2025, the LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA collaboration reported a sub-threshold gravitational wave candidate detection consistent with a sub-solar-mass neutron star merger, denoted S250818k. An optical transient, AT2025ulz, was discovered within the localization region. AT2025ulz initially appeared to meet the expected behavior of kilonova (KN) emission, the telltale signature of a binary neutron star merger. The transient subsequently rebrightened after $\sim$\,$5$ days and developed spectral features characteristic of a Type IIb supernova. In this work, we analyze the observations of the host galaxy of AT2025ulz obtained by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). From the DESI spectrum, we obtain a secure redshift of $z = 0.084840 \pm 0.000006$, which places the transient within $2\sigma$ of the gravitational wave distance and results in an integral overlap between the gravitational wave alert and the transient location of $\log_{10}\mathcal{I} \approx 3.9-4.2$. Our analysis of the host galaxy's spectral energy distribution reveals a star-forming, dusty galaxy with stellar mass ${\sim} 10^{10}~M_\odot$, broadly consistent with the population of both short gamma-ray bursts and core-collapse supernova host galaxies. We also present our follow-up of DESI-selected candidate host galaxies using the Fraunhofer Telescope at the Wendelstein Observatory, and show the promise of DESI for associating or rejecting candidate electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational wave alerts. These results emphasize the value of DESI's extensive spectroscopic dataset in rapidly characterizing host galaxies, enabling spectroscopic host subtraction, and guiding targeted follow-up.
#### Continuous gravitational waves from magnetized white dwarfs: Quantifying the detection plausibility by LISA

 - **Abstract**
 White dwarfs (WDs) are frequently observed to have strong magnetic fields up to $10^9$ G and expected to have a possible internal field as high as $\sim 10^{14}$ G. High internal fields can significantly deform a WD's equilibrium structure, generating a quadrupole moment. If the rotation axis is misaligned with the magnetic axis, the deformation can lead to the emission of continuous gravitational waves (CGWs). We examine the potential for detecting CGWs from magnetized WDs with future space-based detectors such as LISA, ALIA, DECIGO, Deci-Hz, BBO and TianQin. We model the field-induced deformation and compute the resulting GW strain, incorporating amplitude decay due to angular momentum loss from electromagnetic and gravitational radiation. This sets a timescale for detection -`active timescale' of $10^{5-6}$ yr, requiring observation while the object remains sufficiently young. Our results suggest that LISA could detect a few dozens of highly magnetized WDs across the Galaxy during its mission. As a specific case, we investigate ZTF J1901+1458- a compact, massive, fast-rotating, and strongly magnetized WD with spin period $\sim416$ s and inferred surface field $\sim10^{9}$ G. We find that this object would be detectable by LISA with four years of continuous data. This highlights the potential of CGW observations to probe magnetic field structure in WDs and their role in type Ia supernova progenitors.

 - **Abstract**
 On August 18, 2025, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration reported gravitational waves from a sub-threshold binary neutron star merger. If astrophysical, this event would have a surprisingly low chirp mass, suggesting that at least one neutron star was below a solar mass. The Zwicky Transient Facility mapped the coarse localization and discovered a transient, ZTF25abjmnps (AT2025ulz), that was spatially and temporally coincident with the gravitational wave trigger. The first week of follow-up suggested properties reminiscent of a GW170817-like kilonova. Subsequent follow-up suggests properties most similar to a young, stripped-envelope, Type IIb supernova. Although we cannot statistically rule out chance coincidence, we undertake due diligence analysis to explore the possible association between ZTF25abjmnps and S250818k. Theoretical models have been proposed wherein sub-solar neutron star(s) may form (and subsequently merge) via accretion disk fragmentation or core fission inside a core-collapse supernova i.e. a ``superkilonova". Here, we qualitatively discuss our multi-wavelength dataset in the context of the superkilonova picture. Future higher significance gravitational wave detections of sub-solar neutron star mergers with extensive electromagnetic follow-up would conclusively resolve this tantalizing multi-messenger association.
#### Molecular Gas in Major Mergers Hosting Dual and Single AGN at <10 kpc Nuclear Separations

 - **Abstract**
 We present high-resolution ($\sim$50$-$100 pc) Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observations of $^{12}$CO(2-1) or $^{12}$CO(1-0) emission in seven local ($z$ $\lesssim$ 0.05) major mergers -- five of which are dual active galactic nuclei (AGN) systems, and two of which are single AGN systems. We model the molecular gas kinematics through rotating disk profiles using a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo approach. The residuals were then used to isolate non-rotating components of the molecular gas-- the most likely contributor to future SMBH growth. We find that more massive SMBHs have higher surface densities of non-rotating molecular gas within their sphere of influence. This potential molecular gas supply, however, does not correlate with the current accretion efficiency of the SMBHs, suggesting that only a fraction of the observed non-rotating gas is currently reaching the SMBH. Finally, we tentatively find no significant differences in the nuclear molecular gas masses of single AGN and dual AGN hosts, both within the SMBH sphere of influence and within the central kiloparsec. Our results indicate that the probability of occurrence of the dual AGN phenomenon is likely dependent on AGN variability and/or obscuration rather than the availability of molecular gas in the nuclear regions.
#### Unlocking the radio-gamma spectrum of the pulsar wind nebula around PSR J1124-5916 in SNR G292.0+1.8

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first detection of GeV $\gamma$-ray emission potentially associated with the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) hosted by the young core-collapse supernova remnant G292.0+1.8, based on a detailed time-resolved analysis of \textit{Fermi}-LAT data. By isolating the unpulsed component from the dominant magnetospheric radiation of PSR~J1124$-$5916, we successfully disentangle a candidate nebular emission in the GeV range, characterise its morphology and extract its spectrum. This identification places G292.0+1.8 among the few systems in which the pulsar and PWN contributions have been spectrally resolved at high energies, offering new insight into their respective emission mechanisms. We characterise the $\gamma$-ray spectrum of the pulsar and model the broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) of the PWN using radio, X-ray, and GeV data. The emission is well described by a single electron population with two spectral breaks: one intrinsic to the injection spectrum and another produced by synchrotron cooling in a magnetic field of $\sim$15~$\mu$G. Notably, the inferred magnetic field and the low TeV flux of the nebula resemble those of 3C~58, suggesting that similar low-field environments can arise in young PWNe. The high-energy portion of the SED is now tightly constrained by our GeV detection and existing TeV upper limits. Compared to our model, earlier predictions tend to underpredict the $\gamma$-ray flux, while others that succeed in reproducing the GeV component often overpredict the TeV emission. This mismatch underscores the challenges in modelling particle acceleration and radiation processes in young PWNe and establishes G292.0+1.8 as a valuable benchmark for testing and refining such models.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first systematic study of multi-domain map-to-map translation in galaxy formation simulations, leveraging deep generative models to predict diverse galactic properties. Using high-resolution magneto-hydrodynamical simulation data, we compare conditional generative adversarial networks and diffusion models under unified preprocessing and evaluation, optimizing architectures and attention mechanisms for physical fidelity on galactic scales. Our approach jointly addresses seven astrophysical domains - including dark matter, gas, neutral hydrogen, stellar mass, temperature, and magnetic field strength - while introducing physics-aware evaluation metrics that quantify structural realism beyond standard computer vision measures. We demonstrate that translation difficulty correlates with physical coupling, achieving near-perfect fidelity for mappings from gas to dark matter and mappings involving astro-chemical components such as total gas to HI content, while identifying fundamental challenges in weakly constrained tasks such as gas to stellar mass mappings. Our results establish GAN-based models as competitive counterparts to state-of-the-art diffusion approaches at a fraction of the computational cost (in training and inference), paving the way for scalable, physics-aware generative frameworks for forward modelling and observational reconstruction in the SKA era.

 - **Abstract**
 Exoplanetary systems exhibit a broad range of architectures which, in turn, enable a variety of dynamical environments. Many of the known planetary systems do not transit the host star, and so we measure the minimum masses of their planets, making it difficult to fully assess the dynamical environment within the system. Astrometry can resolve the mass ambiguity and thus allow a more complete dynamical analysis of systems to be conducted. Gaia-4 and Gaia-5 are two such systems, whose study with radial velocities and data from the Gaia mission revealed that each star harbors a massive planet on a highly eccentric orbit. In this work, we provide the results of a dynamical analysis of each system, including calculations of the Habitable Zone (HZ), from which we show that the presence of the known companions largely exclude the presence of planets within the HZ. We discuss the diagnostics of potential past planet-planet scattering events, and the occurrence of similar systems whereby a giant planet on an eccentric orbit can substantially disrupt orbital integrity of terrestrial planets. These "wrecking ball" systems have an impact on the target selection for planned direct imaging missions that seek to identify potentially habitable environments.

 - **Abstract**
 The direct, empirical determination of the local value of the Hubble constant (H0) has markedly advanced thanks to improved instrumentation, measurement techniques, and distance estimators. However, combining determinations from different estimators is non-trivial, due to correlated calibrations and different analysis methodologies. Using covariance weighting and leveraging the broad and comprehensive community of experts, we constructed a rigorous and transparent Distance Network (DN) to find a consensus value and uncertainty for the local H0. All critically reviewed the available data sets, spanning parallaxes, detached eclipsing binaries, masers, Cepheids, the TRGB, Miras, JAGB stars, SN Ia, Surface Brightness Fluctuations, SN II, the Fundamental Plane, and Tully-Fisher relations and voted for indicators to define a `baseline' DN and others to assess robustness and sensitivity of the results. We provide open-source software and data products to support full transparency and future extensions of this effort. Our conclusions: 1) Local H0 is robustly determined, with first-rank indicators internally consistent within their uncertainties; 2) A covariance-weighted combination yields an uncertainty of 1.1% (baseline) or 0.9% (all estimators); 3) The contribution from SNe Ia is consistent across four current compilations of optical magnitudes or using NIR-only magnitudes; 4) Removing either Cepheids or TRGB has minimal effect; 5) Replacing SNe Ia with galaxy-based indicators changes H0 by less than 0.1 km/s/Mpc, while doubling its uncertainty; 6) The baseline result is H0=73.50+/-0.81 km/s/Mpc. Compared to early Universe results, our result differs by 7.1sigma from flat {\Lambda}CDM with Planck+SPT+ACT and 5.0 sigma with BBN+BAO (DESI2). A networked approach is invaluable for enabling further progress in accuracy and precision without overreliance on any single method, sample or group.

 - **Abstract**
 This review is focused on recent {\sl Self-Organized Criticality (SOC)} literature of astrophysical phenomena, covering the last decade of (2015-2025), while previous SOC literature (1987-2014) is reviewed elsewhere. The selection of literature is mostly based on searches with the NASA-supported {\sl Astrophysics Data System (ADS)}. The discussed astrophysical SOC phenomena are subdivided into solar flares, solar atmosphere (photosphere, chromosphere, corona), heliospheric systems (coronal mass ejections, solar wind, solar energetic particles), planetary systems (asteroids and small bodies, lunar cratering, Saturnian ring systems, magnetospheric systems), stellar flares, and galactic systems (pulsar glitches, gamma ray bursts, soft gamma-ray repeaters, supergiant fast X-ray transients, fast transient radio bursts, magnetars, blazars, black holes).
#### Wind-AE: A Fast, Open-source 1D Photoevaporation Code with Metal and Multi-frequency X-ray Capabilities

 - **Abstract**
 Throughout their lives, short period exoplanets (<100 days) experience X-ray and extreme-UV (XUV) stellar irradiation that can heat and photoionize planets' upper atmospheres, driving transonic outflows. This photoevaporative mass loss plays a role in both evolution and observed demographics; however, mass loss rates are not currently directly observable and can only be inferred from models. To that end, we present an open-source fast 1D, XUV multi-frequency, multispecies, steady-state, hydrodynamic Parker Wind photoevaporation relaxation model based on Murray-Clay et al. (2009,arXiv:0811.0006). The model can move smoothly between high and low flux regimes and accepts custom multi-frequency stellar spectra. While the inclusion of high-energy X-rays increases mass loss rates ($\dot{M}$), metals decrease $\dot{M}$, and the net result for a typical hot Jupiter is a similar $\dot{M}$, but a hotter, faster, and more gradually ionized wind. We find that mulitfrequency photons (e.g., 13.6-2000eV) are absorbed over a broader range of heights in the atmosphere resulting in a wind-launch radius, $R_{XUV}$, that is of order 10 nanobars for all but the highest surface gravity planets. Grids of H/He solar metallicity atmospheres reveal that, for typical hot Jupiters like HD 209458b, $R_{XUV}$~1.1-1.8$R_P$ for low-fluxes, meaning that the energy-limited mass loss rate, $\dot{M}_{Elim}(R)$, computed at $R=R_P$ is a good approximation. However, for planets with low escape velocities, like many sub-Neptunes and super-Earths, $R_{XUV}$ can be >>$R_P$, making it necessary to use $\dot{M}_{Elim}(R=R_{XUV})$ to avoid significantly underestimating mass loss rates. For both high escape velocities and large incident fluxes, radiative cooling is significant and energy-limited mass loss overestimates $\dot{M}$.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a sample of 212 early-type galaxies (ETGs) at redshifts $0.25 < z < 0.75$. We combine deep integral-field spectroscopy from the MUSE-DEEP survey with high-resolution HST imaging to study the structure, kinematics, and stellar populations of these galaxies. We measure spatially resolved stellar kinematics and use the specific angular momentum proxy, $\lambda_R$, to classify galaxies into fast and slow rotators. We find a slow rotator fraction consistent with local Universe samples, suggesting little evolution in the massive ETG population since $z \sim 1$. The kinematic and photometric axes of fast rotators are generally well-aligned, similar to their local counterparts. We find that global stellar population properties, such as age, metallicity, and mass-to-light ratio ($M_*/L$), correlate strongly with the central velocity dispersion ($\sigma_\mathrm{e}$), following trends established for local ETGs. Slow rotators are typically more massive, have higher $\sigma_\mathrm{e}$, and are more metal-rich than fast rotators. Our findings indicate that the fundamental structural, kinematic, and stellar population scaling relations of massive ETGs were already in place by $z \sim 0.75$, suggesting their evolutionary pathways have remained stable over the last $\sim 7$ Gyr.

 Understanding how the internal kinematics of massive galaxies evolve is key to constraining the physical processes that drive their assembly. We investigate the evolution of rotational support in massive ($\log M_{\ast}/M_{\odot} \geq 10.6$) early-type galaxies (ETGs) over the past $\sim$7 Gyr. We use MUSE integral-field spectroscopic (IFS) data for 212 ETGs at intermediate redshift ($0.25 < z < 0.75$) from the MAGNUS sample. We compare their kinematics to a carefully matched local sample of 787 ETGs ($z \leq 0.05$) from the MaNGA survey. Using the specific stellar angular momentum proxy, $\lambda_R$, we quantify the balance between ordered rotation and random motions. We derive intrinsic $\lambda_R$ values by applying a uniform correction for seeing and point-spread function (PSF) effects to both samples. We find a significant evolutionary trend: the intermediate-redshift ETGs are systematically more rotationally supported than their local counterparts. The median PSF-corrected $\lambda_R$ for the MAGNUS sample is $0.48 \pm 0.05$, substantially higher than the median of $0.34 \pm 0.03$ for the matched MaNGA sample. This corresponds to a positive slope in the $\lambda_R-z$ relation of $\mathrm{d} \lambda_R / \mathrm{d} z = 0.3 \pm 0.04$ for the combined sample. The decline in rotational support is most pronounced for the most massive galaxies ($\log M_{\ast}/M_{\odot} > 11.3$). Our results provide robust evidence that massive ETGs have undergone significant kinematic evolution, losing angular momentum as they evolve towards the present day, consistent with theoretical models where processes such as dry mergers play a crucial role in shaping the dynamical state of galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 Super-Eddington accretion is a crucial phase in the growth of supermassive black holes. However, identifying super-Eddington accreting quasars observationally is challenging due to uncertain black-hole mass estimates and other complications. The Eddington ratio parameter does not represent accurately the accretion rate in the super-Eddington regime. On the other hand, super-Eddington accreting quasars appear to show large hard X-ray (rest-frame > 2 keV) power-law photon indices, and they also exhibit distinct optical spectral features including weak [O III] $\lambda 5007$ emission and strong Fe II emission. We test steep X-ray photon-index selection of super-Eddington accreting quasars by obtaining Palomar 200-inch Hale Telescope near-infrared spectra for a pilot sample of nine $\Gamma=2.0-2.6$ quasars at $z\approx1.4-2.5$. We derive H$\beta$-based single-epoch virial black-hole masses (median value $\rm 4.3 \times 10^{8}~M_{\odot}$) and Eddington ratios (median value 0.6). The Eddington ratio distribution is consistent with that of the comparison sample, which is a flux-limited sample of quasars at $z\approx1.5-3.5$ with near-infrared spectroscopy. But our super-Eddington candidates do show statistically weaker [O III] emission ($P_{\rm null}=0.0075$) and marginally stronger Fe II emission ($P_{\rm null}=0.06$). We also find one candidate with broad (width of 1960 km/s) and blueshifted (690 km/s) [O III] $\lambda 4959$ and [O III] $\lambda 5007$ lines, which probably originate from a strong [O III] outflow driven by super-Eddington accretion. Overall, the steep X-ray photon-index selection of super-Eddington accreting quasars appears promising. But a larger sample is needed to assess further the reliability of the selection.

 - **Abstract**
 We propose to use the unprecedented polarization sensitivity of PRIMA's PRIMAger Polarization Imager and its high resolution in Band 1 (92 $\mu$m) to map magnetic fields across two contrasting molecular cloud environments: the well-studied Perseus cloud and the isolated Musca filament. This comparative study will leverage the existing VLA radio observations that provide line-of-sight magnetic field component of the Perseus cloud, along with upcoming POSSUM survey results for Musca, to construct the first detailed 3D magnetic field vector maps at sub-parsec resolution. Perseus, with its known formation history through interstellar structure (e.g., bubble) interactions, will reveal how magnetic fields evolve during active star formation phases, while Musca, an isolated filament with lower star-formation activity, will show magnetic field morphology in early evolutionary stages. With PRIMA's resolution of 0.01 pc for Perseus and $<0.01$ pc for Musca, we will resolve magnetic field structures at scales necessary for understanding cloud fragmentation and star formation efficiency, and the roles that magnetic fields play in these processes. Our survey will require approximately 1438 hours to cover 42 deg$^2$ of Perseus and 12 deg$^2$ of Musca. With this, we aim to provide the first comprehensive view of how environment and evolutionary state may influence magnetic field evolution in molecular clouds and how magnetic fields influence cloud formation, fragmentation, and star formation.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate how the external medium surrounding prestellar cores affects the star formation process by conducting three-dimensional resistive magnetohydrodynamic simulations. The initial cores follow critical Bonnor-Ebert profiles and are embedded in environments with different ambient densities. The simulations follow the evolution at least until the envelope mass within a radius equal to twice the critical Bonnor-Ebert radius drops to 35% of the initial cloud mass. We reveal that in environments with higher external density, enhanced mass inflow from the envelope leads to Bondi-like accretion as the protostellar mass increases. The continued inflow substantially increases the final stellar mass, resulting in star formation efficiencies that appear to exceed unity in dense environments. The external medium also influences the evolution of circumstellar disks and protostellar outflows: with the high-density external medium, disks grow rapidly but their mass becomes smaller relative to the protostellar mass, and the outflow is sustained over a long duration. However, the ratio of angular momentum removed by outflows and magnetic braking to that introduced by inflowing gas decreases with increasing external density. These results suggest that the density of the external medium regulates not only protostellar mass growth but also the inflow-outflow balance and angular momentum transport in magnetized, rotating star-forming cores.

 - **Abstract**
 X-ray bursts from the magnetar can lead to the formation of fireballs trapped by the magnetic field and co-rotating with the star. The fireball emission could occasionally be eclipsed by the magnetar, especially when the burst duration is comparable to the magnetar's spin period. In this work, we discover a peculiar type of burst whose light curve has a plateau-like feature among the long bursts of the magnetar SGR J1935+2154. Based on these bursts, we identified four burst candidates with eclipse-like characteristics. By fitting their light curves with the eclipse fireball model, the viewing angle of the magnetar relative to its spin axis is estimated to be $17^\circ \pm 10^\circ$. The distances from the fireballs to the magnetar are found to be more than five times the magnetar's radius, indicating that the fireballs are suspended in the magnetosphere rather than adhering to the magnetar surface. We also find this configuration is well consistent with the implication of the cyclotron resonance scattering feature in their spectra. Our results suggest that some intermediate X-ray bursts of SGR 1935+2154 may originate from magnetic reconnection within the magnetosphere rather than the starquake.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the decadal brightening of non-thermal emission flux in the northeastern filament of the young supernova remnant Cassiopeia A (Cas A), which highlights dynamic processes in the forward shock. This filament, characterized by the highest particle acceleration rate among Cas A's outer shells, offers an exceptional opportunity to investigate underlying astrophysical mechanisms. Since 2000, the non-thermal flux has increased by several tens of percent before plateauing, while the spectral shape has remained largely unchanged. Over the past two decades, the filament's morphology has evolved significantly, splitting into two distinct sections. Detailed analysis reveals contrasting behaviors: one section shows a flux increase followed by saturation, while the other maintains a steady flux. These differences likely arise from nonlinear effects, including magnetohydrodynamic interactions influenced by magnetic field orientation, interactions with surrounding material, and complex fluid dynamics associated with young supernova remnants. The localized evolution of this filament, captured with high spatial resolution, provides critical insights into the temporal dynamics of non-thermal particles and the generation of cosmic rays from asymmetric supernova explosions.

 - **Abstract**
 High rates of stable mass transfer (MT) occur for some binary star systems, resulting in luminous transients and circumbinary outflows. We perform hydrodynamical simulations of a $10 \ M_\odot$ donor star and a $5\ M_\odot$ point mass secondary, incorporating approximate effects of radiative cooling. By varying the orbital separation of the system, we probe MT rates between $10^{-5}$ and $10^{-1} M_\odot$/yr. Mass flows from the donor into an accretion disk, with significant equatorially-concentrated outflows through the outer Lagrange point L2 occurring for MT rates $\gtrsim 10^{-3} M_\odot$/yr, while the MT remaining mostly conservative for lower MT rates. In all cases, any outflowing gas approximately carries the specific angular momentum of L2. The gas cooling luminosity $L$ and temperature increases with MT rate, with $L \sim 10^{5} L_\odot$ and $T \sim 10^4 \, {\rm K}$ for simulations featuring the strongest outflows, with contributions from both the accretion disk and circumbinary outflow. The most luminous transients associated with mass outflows will be rare due to the high MT rate requirement, but generate significant optical emission from both the accretor's disk and the circumbinary outflow.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar mass is a fundamental quantity that determines the properties and evolution of stars. However, estimating stellar masses in star-forming regions is challenging because young stars are obscured by dense gas and the regions are highly inhomogeneous, making spherical dynamical estimates unreliable. Supervised machine learning could link such complex structures to stellar mass, but it requires large, high-quality labeled datasets from high-resolution magneto-hydrodynamical (MHD) simulations, which are computationally expensive. We address this by pretraining a vision transformer on one million synthetic fractal images using the self-supervised framework DINOv2, and then applying the frozen model to limited high-resolution MHD simulations. Our results demonstrate that synthetic pretraining improves frozen-feature regression stellar mass predictions, with the pretrained model performing slightly better than a supervised model trained on the same limited simulations. Principal component analysis of the extracted features further reveals semantically meaningful structures, suggesting that the model enables unsupervised segmentation of star-forming regions without the need for labeled data or fine-tuning.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutron stars provide unique laboratories for probing physics of dense nuclear matter under extreme conditions. Their thermal and luminosity evolution reflects key internal properties such as the equation of state (EoS), nucleon superfluidity and superconductivity, envelope composition, and magnetic field, and so on. Recent observations [\textit{e.g.}, V. Abramkin \textit{et al.,} ApJ \textbf{924}, 128 (2022)] have revealed unexpectedly warm old neutron stars, which cannot be explained by standard neutrino-photon cooling models. The failure of the standard cooling models implies the presence of additional internal heating mechanism. Building on the previous study [M. Fujiwara \textit{et al}., JCAP \textbf{03}, 051 (2024)], which proposed vortex creep heating (VCH) from the frictional motion of superfluid vortices as a viable mechanism, we extend the cooling framework to include both VCH and direct Urca (DUrca) processes. These are implemented in our code to explore their combined impact, particularly for massive neutron stars where DUrca operates. By varying rotational parameters ($P$, $\dot{P}$, $P_0$), EoS models (APR, BSk24), pairing gaps, and envelope compositions, we examine how heating-cooling interplay shapes the temperature evolution. Our results show that VCH can substantially mitigate the rapid cooling driven by DUrca, offering new evolutionary pathways for massive neutron stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations are essential tools for studying the formation and evolution of galaxies and their central supermassive black holes. While they reproduce many key observed properties of galaxies, their limited volumes have hindered comprehensive studies of the AGN and quasar populations. In this work, we leverage the FLAMINGO simulation suite, focusing on its large $(2.8$ $\mathrm{Gpc})^3$ volume, to investigate two key observables of quasar activity: the quasar luminosity function (QLF) and quasar clustering. FLAMINGO reproduces the observed QLF at low redshift ($z \lesssim 1$) and for faint quasars ($L_\mathrm{bol} \lesssim 10^{45}$ $\mathrm{erg s^{-1}}$), but significantly underpredicts the abundance of bright quasars at $z \approx 1$-$3$. Introducing a 0.75 dex log-normal luminosity scatter to represent unresolved small-scale variability boosts the number of bright quasars by upscattering lower-luminosity systems, thereby improving agreement with observations at the bright end. A decomposition of the QLF by black hole mass reveals that this boost is primarily driven by low-mass black holes radiating above the Eddington limit. Nevertheless, limitations remain in fully reproducing the rise and decline of the bright quasar population over cosmic time and in matching the black hole masses inferred from quasar spectra. Thanks to FLAMINGO's large volume, we can robustly sample rare, luminous quasars and measure their spatial clustering for $\log_{10} L_\mathrm{bol}/\mathrm{erg s^{-1}} \gtrsim 45.5$. The simulation reproduces the observed clustering across $0 \lesssim z \lesssim 3$, and the reduced luminosity dependence introduced by scatter aligns with observational trends. However, it underpredicts the clustering strength at $z \approx 4$, consistent with other models and possibly reflecting high-redshift observational uncertainties.

 - **Abstract**
 In this two-paper series, we present a straightforward mathematical model for synthesizing quasar absorption line profiles from sight lines through idealized, spatial-kinematic models of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) and their host galaxies. Here, in Paper I, we develop the spatial geometries of multiple galaxy/CGM structures and populate these structures with 3D velocity fields. For arbitrary viewing angles and galaxy-quasar impact parameters, we derive observer coordinate-based expressions for the perceived azimuthal angle and galaxy inclination and a generalized scalar expression for the line-of-sight velocity as a function of position along the line of sight. We motivate and develop four idealized galaxy/CGM spatial-kinematic structures based on empirical data and theoretical predictions: (1) a rotating galactic disk/extra-planar gas, (2) a static or dynamic spherical halo, (3) an outflowing bi-polar galactic wind, and (4) an inward spiraling flared planar accretion. Using a small set of free parameters, the spatial geometries and velocity fields can be adjusted and explored, including velocity gradients, wind stalling, and accretion trajectories. These spatial-kinematic models are designed to be flexible and easily modified and can be tailored for studying individual galaxy-absorber pairs or galaxy group environments; they can be applied to real-world observations or hydrodynamic simulations of the baryon cycle as studied through quasar absorption line systems. These models also serve as tools for developing physical intuition. In Paper II, we will present the formalism for populating the galaxy/CGM structures with multiphase photoionized and collisionally ionized gas and for generating absorption profiles for ions of interest.

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) remains an open questions in astrophysics. We explore two primary scenarios for the distribution of UHECR sources, assuming that their production rate follows either the cosmic star-formation-rate or stellar-mass density. By jointly fitting the UHECR energy spectrum and mass composition measured by the Pierre Auger Observatory above the ankle (10^{18.7} eV), we derive constraints on the acceleration mechanisms, source energetics, and elemental abundances at escape. Using these constraints, we generate sky maps above 40 EeV based on a catalog of over 400,000 galaxies out to 350 Mpc, providing a near-infrared flux-limited sample that maps the two stellar-activity tracers across the full sky. A crucial factor in understanding UHECR propagation is the influence of large-scale cosmic structures, particularly galaxy clusters, the largest gravitationally bound systems in the Universe, which are filled with magnetized diffuse plasma. Intermittent sources hosted in galaxies within such structures, coupled with cosmic magnetic fields, shape the observed UHECR arrival directions and provide insights into the burst rate of the sources. We show that these environments can significantly impact UHECR transport, making them particularly opaque to heavy nuclei. Additionally, we compute the expected secondary neutrino and photon fluxes from UHECR interactions in these environments and compare them with current experimental limits, constraining the maximum energy that particles can achieve. Finally, we assess the compatibility of these constraints with astrophysical candidates, identifying long gamma-ray bursts as the most promising sources.

 - **Abstract**
 Over the past LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA (LVK) observing runs, it has become increasingly clear that identifying the next electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational-wave (GW) neutron star mergers will likely be more challenging compared to the case of GW170817. The rarity of these GW events, and their electromagnetic counterparts, motivates rapid searches of any candidate binary neutron star (BNS) merger detected by the LVK. We present our extensive photometric and spectroscopic campaign of the candidate counterpart AT2025ulz to the low-significance GW event S250818k, which had a ${\sim} 29\%$ probability of being a BNS merger. We demonstrate that during the first five days, the luminosity and color evolution of AT2025ulz are consistent with both kilonova and shock cooling models, although a Bayesian model comparison shows preference for the shock cooling model, underscoring the ambiguity inherent to early data obtained over only a few days. Continued monitoring beyond this window reveals a rise and color evolution incompatible with kilonova models and instead consistent with a supernova. This event emphasizes the difficulty in identifying the electromagnetic counterparts to BNS mergers and the significant allotment of observing time necessary to robustly differentiate kilonovae from impostors.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of $\gamma$-rays from diffuse gas provide the opportunity to study the distribution of high energy particles in different astrophysical environments. In the circumgalactic medium (CGM) and the intracluster medium (ICM), it is expected that relativistic cosmic rays collide with thermal particles and produce $\gamma$-rays through pion decay. The $\gamma$-ray luminosity of a plasma depends on where cosmic rays are: if they are in denser gas, they produce more $\gamma$-rays. In this work, we study how different cosmic-ray transport mechanisms impact the $\gamma$-ray luminosity of a turbulent, multiphase medium formed from an initially diffuse medium. Two quantities set the luminosity: the average cosmic-ray energy density and the correlation of cosmic-ray energy and gas density. Overall, cosmic rays must escape cold dense regions in order to produce less $\gamma$-ray emission and be consistent with observations. Our simulations with fast transport mechanisms (either diffusion or streaming) are degenerate: they each produce a lower $\gamma$-ray luminosity than slow transport simulations by two orders of magnitude. This result means that fast transport (particularly in dense clumps) is necessary for simulations to agree with the dearth of observations of $\gamma$-ray emission from diffuse gas like the CGM and ICM. We also show the significant difference in luminosity is the result of cosmic-ray reacceleration. This reacceleration is different from the turbulent reacceleration described by Ptuskin (1988). Instead, condensing, cold clouds drive a significant increase in the average cosmic-ray energy and, as a result, the $\gamma$-ray luminosity.

 - **Abstract**
 Late-time light curve plateaus in tidal disruption events (TDEs) are often approximated as flat and time-independent. This simplification is motivated by theoretical modeling of spreading late time TDE disks, which often predicts slow light curve evolution. However, if time evolution can be detected, late-time light curves will yield more information than has been previously accessible. In this work, we re-examine late-time TDE data to test how well the flat plateau assumption holds. We use Markov Chain Monte Carlo to estimate the maximum likelihood for a family of theory-agnostic models and apply the Akaike information criterion to find that that roughly one third of our sample favors evolving plateaus, one third favors truly flat plateaus, and one third shows no statistically significant evidence for any plateau. Next, we refit the TDEs that exhibit statistically significant plateaus using a magnetically elevated $\alpha$-disk model, motivated by the lack of clear thermal instability in late time TDE light curves. From these model-dependent fits, we obtain estimates for the supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass, the mass of the disrupted star, and the $\alpha$ parameter itself. Fitted $\alpha$ values range from $10^{-3}$ to 0.4 (the mean fitted $\alpha=10^{-1.8}$, with scatter of 0.6 dex), broadly consistent with results from magnetohydrodynamic simulations. Finally, we estimate the timescales of disk precession in magnetically elevated TDE models. Theoretically, we find that disk precession times may be orders of magnitude shorter than in unmagnetized Shakura-Sunyaev disks, and grow in time as $T_{\rm prec}\propto t^{35/36}$; empirically, by using fitted $\alpha$ parameters, we estimate that late time disks may experience $\sim$few-10 precession cycles.
