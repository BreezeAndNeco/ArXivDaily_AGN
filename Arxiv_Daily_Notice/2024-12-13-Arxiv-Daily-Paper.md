 - **Abstract**
 We present GalSBI, a phenomenological model of the galaxy population for cosmological applications using simulation-based inference. The model is based on analytical parametrizations of galaxy luminosity functions, morphologies and spectral energy distributions. Model constraints are derived through iterative Approximate Bayesian Computation, by comparing Hyper Suprime-Cam deep field images with simulations which include a forward model of instrumental, observational and source extraction effects. We developed an emulator trained on image simulations using a normalizing flow. We use it to accelerate the inference by predicting detection probabilities, including blending effects and photometric properties of each object, while accounting for background and PSF variations. This enables robustness tests for all elements of the forward model and the inference. The model demonstrates excellent performance when comparing photometric properties from simulations with observed imaging data for key parameters such as magnitudes, colors and sizes. The redshift distribution of simulated galaxies agrees well with high-precision photometric redshifts in the COSMOS field within $1.5\sigma$ for all magnitude cuts. Additionally, we demonstrate how GalSBI's redshifts can be utilized for splitting galaxy catalogs into tomographic bins, highlighting its potential for current and upcoming surveys. GalSBI is fully open-source, with the accompanying Python package, $\texttt{galsbi}$, offering an easy interface to quickly generate realistic, survey-independent galaxy catalogs.

 - **Abstract**
 Even after decades of usage as an extragalactic standard candle, the universal bright end of the planetary nebula luminosity function (PNLF) still lacks a solid theoretical explanation. Until now, models have modeled planetary nebulae (PNe) from artificial stellar populations, without an underlying cosmological star formation history. We present PICS (PNe In Cosmological Simulations), a novel method of modeling PNe in cosmological simulations, through which PN populations for the first time naturally occur within galaxies of diverse evolutionary pathways. We find that only by using realistic stellar populations and their metallicities is it possible to reproduce the bright end of the PNLF for all galaxy types. In particular, the dependence of stellar lifetimes on metallicity has to be accounted for to produce bright PNe in metal-rich populations. Finally, PICS reproduces the statistically complete part of the PNLF observed around the Sun, down to six orders of magnitude below the bright end.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic fields play an important role in the evolution of galaxies and in shaping the dynamics of their inter-stellar medium. However, the formation history of magnetic fields from initial seed-fields to well-ordered systems is not clear. Favoured scenarios include a turbulent dynamo that amplifies the field, and a mean-field dynamo that organizes it. Such a model can be tested through observing the magnetic-field structure of galaxies in the early Universe given the relative formation time-scales involved. Here, we combine the high angular resolution of the Atacama Large Milli-metre Array (ALMA) and gravitational lensing to resolve the magnetic field structure of a 4-kpc in extent grand-design spiral when the Universe was just 2.6 Gyr old. We find that the spiral arm structure, as traced by the heated dust emission, is coincident with the linearly polarized emission, which is consistent with a highly ordered magnetic field. The time-scale needed to produce such an ordered field is likely within at least several rotations of the disk. Our study highlights the importance of combining the long baselines of ALMA and gravitational lensing to resolve the structure of galaxies at cosmologically interesting epochs.

 - **Abstract**
 Thanks to Integral Field Unit survey data it is possible to explore in detail the link between the formation of the stellar content in galaxies and the drivers of evolution. Traditionally, scaling relations have connected galaxy-wide parameters such as stellar mass (M$_s$), morphology or average velocity dispersion ($\sigma$) to the star formation histories (SFHs). We study a high quality sample of SDSS-MaNGA spectra to test the possibility that sub-galaxy ($\sim$2\,kpc) scales are dominant, instead of galaxy-wide parameters. We find a strong correlation between local velocity dispersion and key line strengths that depend on the SFHs, allowing us to make the ansatz that this indicator - that maps the local gravitational potential - is the major driver of star formation in galaxies, whereas larger scales play a role of a secondary nature. Galactocentric distance has a weaker correlation, suggesting that the observed radial gradients effectively reflect local variations of velocity dispersion. In our quest for a cause, instead of a correlation, we contrast $\sigma$ with local stellar mass, that appears less correlated with population properties. We conclude that the inherently higher uncertainty in M$_s$ may explain its lower correlation with respect to $\sigma$, but the extra uncertainty needed for $\sigma$ to have similar correlations as M$_s$ is rather high. Therefore we posit local velocity dispersion as the major driver of evolution, a result that should be reproduced by hydrodynamical models at the proper resolution.

 - **Abstract**
 A complete understanding of the initial conditions of high-mass star formation and what processes determine multiplicity require the study of the magnetic field (B-field) in young, massive cores. Using ALMA 250 GHz polarization (0.3" = 1000 au) and ALMA 220 GHz high-angular resolution observations (0.05" = 160 au), we have performed a full energy analysis including the B-field at core scales and have assessed what influences the multiplicity inside a massive core previously believed to be in the prestellar phase. With 31 Msun, the G11.92 MM2 core has a young CS outflow with a dynamical time scale of a few thousand years. At high-resolution, the MM2 core fragments into a binary system with a projected separation of 505 au and a binary mass ratio of 1.14. Using the DCF method with an ADF analysis, we estimate in this core a B-field strength of 6.2 mG and a mass-to-flux ratio of 18. The MM2 core is strongly subvirialized with a virial parameter of 0.064, including the B-field. The high mass-to-flux ratio and low virial parameter indicate that this massive core is very likely undergoing runaway collapse, which is in direct contradiction with the core-accretion model. The MM2 core is embedded in a filament that has a velocity gradient consistent with infall. In line with clump-fed scenarios, the core can grow in mass at a rate of 1.9--5.6 x 10^-4 Msun/yr. In spite of the B-field having only a minor contribution to the total energy budget at core scales, it likely plays a more important role at smaller scales by setting the binary properties. Considering energy ratios and a fragmentation criterion at the core scale, the binary could have been formed by core fragmentation. The binary properties (separation and mass ratio), however, are also consistent with radiation-magnetohydrodynamic simulations with super-Alfvenic, supersonic (or sonic) turbulence that form binaries by disk fragmentation.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the properties of cold gas at $10^4~\rm K$ around star-forming galaxies at $z~\sim~1$ using Mg II spectra through radiative transfer modeling. We utilize a comprehensive dataset of 624 galaxies from the MAGG and MUDF programs. We focus on Mg II emission from galaxies and their outskirts to explore the cold gas within galaxies and the circumgalactic medium (CGM). We model Mg II spectra for 167 individual galaxies and stacked data for different stellar mass bins. The Mg II spectrum and surface brightness vary significantly with stellar mass. In low-mass galaxies ($M_*/M_\odot<10^9$), Mg II emission is observed in both core ($R_{\rm p}<$ 10 kpc) and halo regions (10 kpc $<R_{\rm p}<$ 30 kpc), while in higher mass galaxies ($M_*/M_\odot>10^{10}$), strong core absorption and more extended halo emission are prominent. This indicates that more massive galaxies have more cold gas. Radiative transfer modeling allows us to investigate key parameters such as the Mg II column density $N_{\rm MgII}$ and the outflow velocity $v_{\rm exp}$. We identify a negative correlation between $N_{\rm MgII}$ and $v_{\rm exp}$. Since higher stellar mass galaxies exhibit a higher $N_{\rm MgII}$ and lower $v_{\rm exp}$, this suggests an abundance of slowly moving cold gas in massive galaxies. In addition, the fitting results of halo spectra indicate the presence of intrinsic Mg II absorption and strong anisotropy of the cold gas distribution around massive galaxies. This study is not only a proof-of-concept of modeling spatially varying Mg II spectra but also enhances our understanding of the CGM and provides insights into the mass-dependent properties of cold gas in and around galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 Long-term evolution characteristics of the solar transition region have been unclear. In this study, daily images of the solar full disk derived from the observations by the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly at 304 A wavelength from 2011 January 1 to 2022 December 31 are used to investigate long-term evolution of the solar transition region. It is found that long-term variation in the transition region of the full disk is in phase with the solar activity cycle, and thus the polar brightening should occur in the maximum epoch of the solar cycle. Long-term variation of the background transition region is found to be likely in anti-phase with the solar activity cycle at middle and low latitudes. The entire transition region, especially the active transition region is inferred to be mainly heated by the active-region magnetic fields and the ephemeral-region magnetic fields, while the quieter transition region is believed to be mainly heated by network magnetic fields. Long-term evolution characteristics of various types of the magnetic fields at the solar surface are highly consistent with these findings, and thus provide an explanation for them.

 - **Abstract**
 Radio observations provide a powerful tool to constrain the assembly of galaxies over cosmic time. Recent deep and wide radio continuum surveys have improved significantly our understanding on radio emission properties of AGNs and SFGs across $0 < z < 4$. This allows us to derive an empirical model of the radio continuum emission of galaxies based on their SFR and the probability of hosting an radio AGN. We make use of the Empirical Galaxy Generator (EGG) to generate a near-infrared-selected, flux-limited multi-wavelength catalog to mimic real observations. Then we assign radio continuum flux densities to galaxies based on their SFRs and the probability of hosting a radio-AGN of specific 1.4 GHz luminosity. We also apply special treatments to reproduce the clustering signal of radio this http URL empirical model successfully recovers the observed 1.4 GHz radio luminosity functions (RLFs) of both AGN and SFG populations, as well as the differential number counts at various radio bands. The uniqueness of this approach also allows us to directly link radio flux densities of galaxies to other properties, including redshifts, stellar masses, and magnitudes at various photometric bands. We find that roughly half of the radio continuum sources to be detected by SKA at $z \sim 4-6$ will be too faint to be detected in the optical survey ($r \sim 27.5$) carried out by Rubin observatory. Unlike previous studies which utilized RLFs to reproduce ERB, our work starts from a simulated galaxy catalog with realistic physical properties. It has the potential to simultaneously, and self-consistently reproduce physical properties of galaxies across a wide range of wavelengths, from optical, NIR, FIR to radio wavelengths. Our empirical model can shed light on the contribution of different galaxies to the extragalactic background light, and greatly facilitates designing future multiwavelength galaxy surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 Brown dwarfs are the bridge between low-mass stars and giant planets. One way of shedding light on their dominant formation mechanism is to study them at the earliest stages of their evolution, when they are deeply embedded in their parental clouds. Several works have identified pre- and proto-brown dwarfs candidates using different observational approaches. The aim of this work is to create a database with all the objects classified as very young substellar candidates in the litearature in order to study them in an homogeneous way. We have gathered all the information about very young substellar candidates available in the literature until 2020. We have retrieved their published photometry from the optical to the centimeter regime, and we have written our own codes to derive their bolometric temperatures and luminosities, and their internal luminosities. We have also populated the database with other parameters extracted from the literature, like e.g. the envelope masses, their detection in some molecular species, and presence of outflows. The result of our search is the SUCANES database, containing 174 objects classified as potential very young substellar candidates in the literature. We present an analysis of the main properties of the retrieved objects. Since we have updated the distances to several star forming regions, this has allowed us to reject some candidates based on their internal luminosities. We have also discussed the derived physical parameters and envelope masses for the best substellar candidates isolated in SUCANES. As an example of a scientific exploitation of this database, we present a feasibility study for the detection of radiojets with upcoming facilities: the ngVLA and the SKA interferometers. The SUCANES database is accessible through a Graphical User Interface and it is open to any potential user.

 - **Abstract**
 Shock waves from supernova remnants (SNRs) have strong influence on the physical and chemical properties of molecular clouds (MCs). Shocks propagating into magnetized MCs can be classified into "jump" J-shock and "continuous" C-shock. The molecular chemistry in the re-formed molecular gas behind J-shock is still not well understood, which will provide a comprehensive view of the chemical feedback of SNRs and the chemical effects of J-shock. We conducted a W-band (71.4-89.7 GHz) observation toward a re-formed molecular clump behind a J-shock induced by SNR W51C with the Yebes 40 m radio telescope to study the molecular chemistry in the re-formed molecular gas. Based on the local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) assumption, we estimate the column densities of HCO+, HCN, C2H and o-c-C3H2, and derive the maps of their abundance ratios with CO. The gas density is constrained by non-LTE analysis of the HCO+ J=1-0 line. We obtain the following abundance ratios: $N({\rm HCO^+})/N({\rm CO})\sim (1.0\text{--}4.0)\times 10^{-4}$, $N({\rm HCN})/N({\rm CO})\sim (1.8\text{--}5.3)\times 10^{-4}$, $N({\rm C_2H})/N({\rm CO})\sim (1.6\text{--}5.0)\times 10^{-3}$, and $N({o\text{-}c\text{-}{\rm C_3H_2}})/N({\rm CO})\sim (1.2\text{--}7.9)\times 10^{-4}$. The non-LTE analysis suggests that the gas density is $n_{\rm H_2}\gtrsim 10^4\rm \ cm^{-3}$. We find that the N(C2H)/N(CO) and N(o-c-C3H2)/N(CO) are higher than typical values in quiescent MCs and shocked MCs by 1-2 orders of magnitude, which can be qualitatively attributed to the abundant C+ and C at the earliest phase of molecular gas re-formation. The Paris-Durham shock code can reproduce, although not perfectly, the observed abundance ratios, especially the enhanced N(C2H)/N(CO) and N(o-c-C3H2)/N(CO), with J-shocks propagating in to both non-irradiated and irradiated molecular gas with a preshock density of $n_{\rm H}=2\times 10^3\rm \ cm^{-3}$.

 - **Abstract**
 The solar corona is highly structured by bunches of magnetic field lines forming either loops, or twisted flux ropes representing prominences/filaments, or very dynamic structures such as jets. The aim of this paper is to understand the interaction between filament channels and jets. We use high-resolution H$\alpha$ spectra obtained by the ground-based Telescope Heliographique pour lEtude du Magnetisme et des Instabilites Solaires (THEMIS) in Canary Islands, and data from Helioseismic Magnetic Imager (HMI) and Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) aboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). In this paper we present a multi-wavelength study of the interaction of filaments and jets. They both consist of cool plasma embedded in magnetic structures. A jet is particularly well studied in all the AIA channels with a flow reaching 100-180 km s$^{-1}$. Its origin is linked to cancelling flux at the edge of the active region. Large Dopplershifts in H$\alpha$ are derived in a typical area for a short time (order of min). They correspond to flows around 140 km s$^{-1}$. In conclusion we conjecture that these flows correspond to some interchange of magnetic field lines between the filament channel and the jets leading to cool plasmoid ejections or reconnection jets perpendicularly to the jet trajectory.
#### A theoretical framework for BL Her stars III. A case study: Robust light curve optimisation in the LMC

 - **Abstract**
 We carry out an extensive light curve comparison of BL Her stars using observations from Gaia DR3 and stellar pulsation models computed using MESA-RSP with the goal to obtain the best-matched modeled-observed pairs for BL Her stars in the LMC. We use the Fourier decomposition technique to analyse the light curves in the G band obtained from Gaia DR3 and from MESA-RSP and use a robust light curve fitting approach to score the modeled-observed pairs with respect to their pulsation periods and over their Fourier parameter space. We obtain the best-fit models for 48 BL Her stars in the LMC and thereby provide the stellar parameter estimates of these stars, 30 of which are labelled as the gold sample with superior light curve fits. We find a relatively flat distribution of stellar masses between 0.5-0.65 Msolar for the gold sample of modeled-observed pairs. An interesting result is that the majority of the best-matched models in the gold sample are computed using the convection parameter sets without radiative cooling. The period-Wesenheit relation for the best-matched gold sample of 30 BL Her models exhibits a slope of $-2.805 \pm 0.164$ while the corresponding period-radius relation exhibits a slope of $0.565 \pm 0.035$, both in good agreement with the empirical PW and PR slopes from BL Her stars in the LMC, respectively. We also used the Wesenheit magnitudes of the 30 best-matched modeled-observed pairs to estimate a distance modulus of $\mu_{\rm LMC} = 18.582 \pm 0.067$ to the LMC, which lies within the bounds of previous literature values. We also discuss the degeneracy in the stellar parameters of the BL Her models that result in similar pulsation periods and light curve structure, and highlight that caution must be exercised while using the stellar parameter estimates.

 - **Abstract**
 Primordial black holes (PBHs) are a major candidate for dark matter and they have been extensively constrained across most mass ranges. However, PBHs in the mass range of $10^{17}-10^{21}$ g remain a viable explanation for all dark matter. In this work, we use observational data from the Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (Insight-HXMT) to refine constraints on PBHs within the mass range of $10^{16}-10^{18}$ g. Our analysis explores three scenarios: directly using observational data, incorporating the astrophysical background model (ABM), and employing the power-law spectrum with an exponential cutoff. Additionally, we also account for photon flux from positron annihilation due to Hawking radiation in our calculations. Our findings indicate that directly using observational data significantly tightens constraints on PBHs with masses above $10^{17}$ g, owing to Insight-HXMT's exceptional sensitivity to hard X-rays. Incorporating the ABM further enhances the constraints by approximately 0.8 orders of magnitude. The exclusion limit for PBHs as dark matter extends to $8\times 10^{17}$ g, nearly doubling the current threshold. Moreover, extrapolating the energy limit with a power-law model improves constraints by approximately one order of magnitude compared to the ABM scenario.

 - **Abstract**
 This work presents the semi-analytical light curve modelling results of 11 stripped-envelope SNe (SESNe), where millisecond magnetars potentially drive their light curves. The light-curve modelling is performed utilizing the $\chi^2$-minimisation code $\texttt{MINIM}$ considering millisecond magnetar as a central engine powering source. The magnetar model well regenerates the bolometric light curves of all the SESNe in the sample and constrains numerous physical parameters, including magnetar's initial spin period ($P_\textrm{i}$) and magnetic field ($B$), explosion energy of supernova ($E_\textrm{exp}$), progenitor radius ($R_\textrm{p}$), etc. Within the sample, the superluminous SNe 2010kd and 2020ank exhibit the lowest $B$ and $P_\textrm{i}$ values, while the relativistic Ic broad-line SN 2012ap shows the highest values for both parameters. The explosion energy for all SESNe in the sample (except SN 2019cad), exceeding $\gtrsim$2 $\times$ 10$^{51}$ erg, indicates there is a possibility of a jittering jet explosion mechanism driving these events. Additionally, a correlation analysis identifies linear dependencies among parameters derived from light curve analysis, revealing positive correlations between rise and decay times, $P_\textrm{i}$ and $B$, $P_\textrm{i}$ and $R_\textrm{p}$, and $E_\textrm{exp}$ and $R_\textrm{p}$, as well as strong anti-correlations of $P_\textrm{i}$ and $B$ with the peak luminosity. Principal Component Analysis is also applied to key parameters to reduce dimensionality, allowing a clearer visualization of SESNe distribution in a lower-dimensional space. This approach highlights the diversity in SESNe characteristics, underscoring unique physical properties and behaviour across different events in the sample. This study motivates further study on a more extended sample of SESNe to look for millisecond magnetars as their powering source.

 - **Abstract**
 Optically dark dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) play an essential role in massive galaxy formation at early cosmic time, however their nature remains elusive. Here we present a detailed case study of all the baryonic components of a $z=4.821$ DSFG, XS55. Selected from the ultra-deep COSMOS-XS 3GHz map with a red SCUBA-2 450$\mu$m/850$\mu$m colour, XS55 was followed up with ALMA 3mm line scans and spectroscopically confirmed to be at $z=4.821$ via detections of the CO(5-4) and [CI](1-0) lines. JWST/NIRCam imaging reveals that XS55 is a F150W-dropout with red F277W/F444W colour, and a complex morphology: a compact central component embedded in an extended structure with a likely companion. XS55 is tentatively detected in X-rays with both Chandra and XMM-Newton, suggesting an active galactic nucleus (AGN) nature. By fitting a panchromatic SED spanning NIR to radio wavelengths, we revealed that XS55 is a massive main-sequence galaxy with a stellar mass of $M_\ast=(5\pm1)\times10^{10}\,{\rm M_\odot}$ and a star formation rate of ${\rm SFR}=540\pm177~{\rm M_\odot\,yr^{-1}}$. The dust of XS55 is optically thick in the far infrared (FIR) with a surprisingly cold dust temperature of $T_{\rm dust}=33\pm2\,{\rm K}$, making XS55 one of the coldest DSFGs at $z>4$ known to date. This work unveils the nature of a radio-selected F150W-dropout, suggesting the existence of a population of DSFGs hosting active black holes embedded in optically thick dust.

 - **Abstract**
 The magnetic cycle on the Sun consists of two consecutive 11-yr sunspot cycles and exhibits a polarity reversal around sunspot maximum. Although solar dynamo theories have progressively become more sophisticated, the details as to how the dynamo sustains magnetic fields are still subject of research. Observing the magnetic fields of Sun-like stars are useful to contextualise the solar dynamo. The BCool survey studies the evolution of surface magnetic fields to understand how dynamo-generated processes are influenced by key ingredients, like mass and rotation. Here, we focus on six Sun-like stars with mass between 1.02 and 1.06 MSun and with 3.5-21 d rotation period. We analysed high-resolution spectropolarimetric data collected with ESPaDOnS, Narval and Neo-Narval. We measured the longitudinal magnetic field from least-squares deconvolution line profiles and inspected its long-term behaviour with a Lomb-Scargle periodogram and a Gaussian process. We applied Zeeman-Doppler imaging to reconstruct the large-scale magnetic field geometry at the stellar surface for different epochs. Two stars, namely HD 9986 and HD 56124 (Prot ~ 20 d) exhibit cyclic variability with polarity reversals of the radial or toroidal field component on time scales of 5 to 6 yr. HD 73350 (Prot = 12 d) has one polarity reversal of the toroidal component and HD 76151 (Prot=17 d) may have short-term evolution (2.5 yr) modulated by the long-term (16 yr) chromospheric cycle. HD 166435 and HD 175726 (Prot =3-5 d), manifest complex magnetic fields without cyclic evolution. Our findings indicate the strong dependence of the magnetic cycles nature with stellar rotation period. For the stars with an identified cyclic evolution, the polarity reversal time scale seems to decrease with decreasing rotation period or Rossby number. These results represent important observational constraints for dynamo models of solar-like stars.

 - **Abstract**
 This study focuses on a radial alignment between Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and Solar Orbiter (SolO) on the 29$^{\text{th}}$ of April 2021 (during a solar minimum), when the two spacecraft were respectively located at $\sim 0.075$ and $\sim 0.9$~au from the Sun. A previous study of this alignment allowed the identification of the same density enhancement (with a time scale of $\sim$1.5~h), and substructures ($\sim$20-30~min timescale), passing first by PSP, and then SolO after a $\sim 138$~h propagation time in the inner heliosphere. We show here that this structure belongs to the large scale heliospheric magnetic sector boundary. In this region, the density is dominated by radial gradients, whereas the magnetic field reversal is consistent with longitudinal gradients in the Carrington reference frame. We estimate the density structure radial size to remain of the order L$_R \sim 10^6$~km, while its longitudinal and latitudinal sizes, are estimated to expand from L$_{\varphi, \theta} \sim 10^4$-$10^5$~km in the high solar corona, to L$_{\varphi, \theta} \sim 10^5$-$10^6$~km at PSP, and L$_{\varphi, \theta} \sim 10^6$-$10^7$~km at SolO. This implies a strong evolution of the structure's aspect ratio during the propagation, due to the plasma's nearly spherical expansion. The structure's shape is therefore inferred to evolve from elongated in the radial direction at $\sim$2-3 solar radii (high corona), to sizes of nearly the same order in all directions at PSP, and then becoming elongated in the directions transverse to the radial at SolO. Measurements are not concordant with local reconnection of open solar wind field lines, so we propose that the structure has been generated through interchange reconnection near the tip of a coronal streamer.

 - **Abstract**
 Models of active galactic nuclei often invoke a close physical association between the broad-line region and the accretion disk. We evaluate this theoretical expectation by investigating the relationship between the inclination angle of the BLR ($\theta_\mathrm{BLR}$) and the inclination angle of the inner accretion disk ($\theta_\mathrm{disk}$). For a sample of eight active galactic nuclei that have published values of $\theta_\mathrm{BLR}$ estimated from dynamical modeling of the BLR based on velocity-resolved reverberation mapping experiments, we analyze high-quality, joint XMM-Newton and NuSTAR X-ray observations to derive new, robust measurements of $\theta_\mathrm{disk}$ through broadband (0.3--78\,keV) reflection spectroscopy. We find a strong, positive correlation between $\theta_\mathrm{BLR}$ and $\theta_\mathrm{disk}$ (Pearson correlation coefficient 0.856, $p$-value 0.007), although Monte Carlo simulations indicate that the level of significance is only marginal ($<3\,\sigma$). Nevertheless, the nearly linear relation between $\theta_\mathrm{BLR}$ and $\theta_\mathrm{disk}$ suggests of a possible physical alignment between the accretion disk and the BLR. Future studies with a larger and more homogeneous sample are needed to confirm the correlation and refine our understanding of the structure and dynamics of the central regions of active galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 We revisit the launch of the galactic outflow in M82 through high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations. Employing a sink-particle module, we self-consistently resolve the star formation and feedback processes, avoiding the reliance on various assumed models as in previous works. We probe the effects of different stellar feedback mechanisms, the gas return from star-forming clouds and initial gas disc mass on the starburst and launch of outflow. Our simulations can generate a starburst that lasts 20-30 Myr, peaking at 20-50 $\rm{M_{\odot} yr^{-1}}$. However, the total stellar mass formed in the starburst in our simulations often exceeds M82's estimated value. The outflow's launch occurs in two stages. Initially, continuous SNe explosions form numerous small bubbles, merging into a super bubble foam composed of low-density warm/hot gas and high-density cool filaments. After approximately 10 Myr of SN energy injection, the super bubble breakout the disc, marking the second stage, which takes 10-15 Myr to develop a multiphase, kpc-scale outflow. Our simulations reveal that cool filaments within the turbulent ISM can survive from the feedback associated to the starburst, then were entrained into the outflow and stretched to hundreds pc in length due to interaction with the hot wind. While the mass loading factor of the well-developed outflow is comparable to M82, the cool gas mass outflow rate is often lower, and its velocity is slower than the estimated value in M82 by $50\%-60\%$. Warm and hot gas are $20\%-30\%$ slower. SN feedback acts as the primary driver of the outflow, while gas return significantly influences the starburst and outflow properties. The initial mass of gas disc has a moderate effect, while stellar wind and radiation feedback have minor effect. To address the shortcomings in our results, enhanced SN feedback effect, due to clustered SNe, is likely necessary.

 - **Abstract**
 Most of the visible matter in the Universe is in a gaseous state, subject to hydrodynamic forces and galaxy formation processes that are much more complex to model than gravity. These baryonic effects can potentially bias the analyses of several cosmological probes, such as weak gravitational lensing. In this work, we study the gas density and velocity fields of the FLAMINGO simulations and compare them with their gravity-only predictions. We find that, while the gas velocities do not differ from those of dark matter on large scales, the gas mass power spectrum is suppressed by up to $\approx 8\%$ relative to matter, even on gigaparsec scales. This is a consequence of star formation depleting gas in the densest and most clustered regions of the universe. On smaller scales, $k>0.1 \, h / \rm Mpc$, the power suppression for both gas densities and velocities is more significant and correlates with the strength of the active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback. The impact of feedback can be understood in terms of outflows, identified as gas bubbles with positive radial velocities ejected from the central galaxy. With increasing feedback strength, the outflowing gas has higher velocities, and it reaches scales as large as $10$ times the virial radius of the halo, redistributing the gas and slowing its average infall velocity. Interestingly, different implementations of AGN feedback leave distinct features in these outflows in terms of their radial and angular profiles and their dependence on halo mass. In the future, such differences could be measured in observations using, for example, the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect.

 - **Abstract**
 Astrophysical relativistic outflows are launched as Poynting-flux-dominated, yet the mechanism governing efficient magnetic dissipation, which powers the observed emission, is still poorly understood. We study magnetic energy dissipation in relativistic "striped" jets, which host current sheets separating magnetically dominated regions with opposite field polarity. The effective gravity force $g$ in the rest frame of accelerating jets drives the Kruskal-Schwarzschild instability (KSI), a magnetic analogue of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability. By means of 2D and 3D particle-in-cell simulations, we study the linear and non-linear evolution of the KSI. The linear stage is well described by linear stability analysis. The non-linear stages of the KSI generate thin (skin-depth-thick) current layers, with length comparable to the dominant KSI wavelength. There, the relativistic drift-kink mode and the tearing mode drive efficient magnetic dissipation. The dissipation rate can be cast as an increase in the effective width $\Delta_{\rm eff}$ of the dissipative region, which follows $d\Delta_{\rm eff}/dt\simeq 0.05 \sqrt{\Delta_{\rm eff}\,g}$. Our results have important implications for the location of the dissipation region in gamma-ray burst and AGN jets.
#### Nonlinear evolution of fluting oscillations in coronal flux tubes

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic flux tubes in the solar corona support a rich variety of transverse oscillations, which are theoretically interpreted as magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modes with a fast and/or Alfvénic character. In the standard flux tube model made of a straight cylindrical tube, these modes can be classified according to their azimuthal wavenumber, $m$. Sausage $m=0$ modes produce periodic expansion and contraction of the tube cross section and are observed during solar flares. Kink $m=1$ modes laterally displace the tube axis and are related to, for example, post-flare global transverse oscillations of coronal loops. Fluting $m \geq 2$ modes produce disturbances that are mainly confined to the tube boundary, but their observation remains elusive to date. We use 3D ideal MHD numerical simulations to investigate the nonlinear evolution of fluting modes in coronal flux tubes with transversely nonuniform boundaries. The simulations show that fluting modes are short-lived as coherent, collective motions of the flux tube. Owing to the process of resonant absorption, fluting oscillations become overdamped modes in tubes with wide enough nonuniform boundaries. During the nonlinear evolution, shear flows drive the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability at the tube boundary, which further disrupts the coherent fluting oscillation. For large-enough oscillation amplitudes, baroclinic instabilities of Rayleigh-Taylor type are also present at locations in the boundary where the plasma acceleration is normal to the boundary. The evolution of the instabilities drives turbulence in the flux tube, which may inhibit the resonant damping. However, the oscillations remain strongly damped even in this case. As a result of the combination of the strong damping and the induced instabilities, it is unlikely that coronal flux tubes can support fluting modes as sufficiently enduring coherent oscillations.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel method for systematically assessing the impact of central potential fluctuations associated with bursty outflows on the structure of dark matter halos for dwarf and ultra-faint galaxies. Specifically, we use dark-matter-only simulations augmented with a manually-added massive particle that modifies the central potential and approximately accounts for a centrally-concentrated baryon component. This approach enables precise control over the magnitude, frequency, and timing of when rapid outflow events occur. We demonstrate that this method can reproduce the established result of core formation for systems that undergo multiple episodes of bursty outflows. In contrast, we also find that equivalent models that undergo only a single (or small number of) burst episodes do not form cores with the same efficacy. This is important because many ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxies in the local universe are observed to have tightly constrained star formation histories that are best described by a single, early burst of star formation. Using a suite of cosmological, zoom-in simulations, we identify the regimes in which single bursts can and cannot form a cored density profile, and therefore, can or cannot resolve the core-cusp problem.

 - **Abstract**
 Protoplanetary disks can exhibit asymmetric temperature variations due to phenomena such as shadows cast by the inner disk or localized heating by young planets. We have performed both linear analyses and hydrodynamical simulations to investigate the disk perturbations induced by these asymmetric temperature variations. Our findings demonstrate that the effects of temperature variations share similarities with those caused by external potentials. Specifically, rotating temperature variations launch steady spiral structures at Lindblad resonances, which corotate with the temperature patterns. When the cooling time exceeds the orbital period, these spiral structures are significantly weakened. Then, depending on the boundary condition, a checkerboard pattern can appear. We provide expressions for the amplitudes of the resulting density and velocity perturbations, primarily determined by the magnitude of the temperature variations. Notably, a temperature variation of about 10\% can induce spirals with density perturbation amplitudes of order unity, comparable to those generated by a thermal mass planet. The coupling between temperature variations and spirals outside the resonances leads to a radially varying angular momentum flux, which could result in efficient ring formation within the disk. We speculate that spirals induced by temperature variations may contribute to disk accretion. Overall, considering that irradiation determines the temperature structure of protoplanetary disks, the change of irradiation both spatially or/and temporarily may produce observable effects in protoplanetary disks, especially spirals in outer disks beyond tens of AU.
#### JWST PRIMER: strong evidence for the environmental quenching of low-mass galaxies out to $\mathbf{\textit{z} \simeq 2}$

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of a study investigating the galaxy stellar-mass function (GSMF), size-mass relations and morphological properties of star-forming and quiescent galaxies over the redshift range $0.25<z<2.25$, using the JWST PRIMER survey. The depth of the PRIMER near-IR imaging allows us to confirm the double Schechter function shape of the quiescent GSMF out to $z\simeq2.0$, via a clear detection of the upturn at $\mathrm{log}_{10}(M_{\star}/ M_{\odot}) \leq 10$ thought to be induced by environmental quenching. In addition to the GSMF, we confirm that quiescent galaxies can be split into separate populations at $\mathrm{log}_{10}(M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) \simeq 10$, based on their size-mass relations and morphologies. We find that low-mass quiescent galaxies have more disk-like morphologies (based on Sérsic index, Gini coefficient and $M_{20}$ metrics) and follow a shallower size-mass relation than their high-mass counterparts. Indeed, the slope of the size-mass relation followed by low-mass quiescent galaxies is indistinguishable from that followed by star-forming galaxies, albeit with a lower normalization. Moreover, within the errors, the evolution in the median size of low-mass quiescent galaxies is indistinguishable from that followed by star-forming galaxies ($R_{e}\propto(1+z)^{-0.25\pm0.03})$, and significantly less rapid than that displayed by high-mass quiescent galaxies ($R_{e}\propto (1+z)^{-1.14\pm 0.03})$. Overall, our results are consistent with low and high-mass quiescent galaxies following different quenching pathways. The evolution of low-mass quiescent galaxies is qualitatively consistent with the expectations of external/environmental quenching (e.g. ram-pressure stripping). In contrast, the evolution of high-mass quiescent galaxies is consistent with internal/mass quenching (e.g. AGN feedback) followed by size growth driven by minor mergers.
