#### Resonant Axion-Photon Conversion in the Early Inspiral of Neutron Star Binaries

 - **Abstract**
 We consider the early binary neutron star inspiral phase as a scenario to probe environmental axion--photon resonant conversion. For this we approximately model the merger site electromagnetic fields as the superposition of two rotating dipolar stellar magnetic fields at the thousand--km scale when both magnetospheres are not largely distorted. We capture the time-sliced near-zone magnetospheric geometry relevant for axion--photon mixing. Plasma effects are incorporated through an effective Goldreich--Julian charge density, used to determine the effective plasma frequency and the location of resonant conversion surfaces. Our results show that axion--photon resonant conversion in binary magnetospheres mostly occurs on extended peanut-shaped surfaces whose global geometry evolves as the binary inspiral evolves. As a consequence, the total electromagnetic power emitted through axion--photon conversion exhibits a characteristic dependence on axion mass and a slow temporal modulation correlated with the gravitational wave frequency emission. This feature is potentially detectable for $m_a \in [50,170] \,\rm \mu eV$ and set $g_{a \gamma} \lesssim 10^{-11}\rm \,GeV^{-1}$ as it lies within the sensitivity limits of current or planned radio observation missions. In light of our results we discuss the opportunity of binary neutron star inspirals as time-dependent, multimessenger probes of axion physics, and motivate coordinated searches combining gravitational wave observations with radio and millimeter wavelength electromagnetic measurements.

 - **Abstract**
 Next-generation GW observatories such as the ET and CE will detect BNS and NSBH inspirals with high SNRs and long in-band durations, making systematic early-warning alerts both feasible and scientifically valuable. Such triggers are essential for coordinating rapid electromagnetic follow-up. In this work, we introduce GW-FALCON, a novel feature-driven DL framework for early-time detection between GW signal+noise and noise-only data in next-generation detectors. Instead of feeding raw time series to CNN or more complex neural network architectures, we first extract a large set of statistical, temporal, and spectral quantities from short observational time windows using the TSFEL library. The resulting fixed-length feature vectors are then used as input to feed-forward ANNs suitable for low-latency operation. We demonstrate the method using simulated BNS and NSBH inspiral waveforms injected into colored Gaussian noise generated from the ET and CE design PSDs. We train separate ANNs on feature sets extracted from partial-inspiral windows characterized by different maximum instantaneous frequencies, enabling early-warning triggers from tens to hundreds of seconds before merger. Across all detector configurations and datasets, the resulting classifiers achieve high accuracy and detection efficiency, with ET-like networks typically reaching test accuracies of order 90% and CE-like ones exceeding 97% at low false-alarm probability. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first comprehensive feature-based DL detection framework for Next-generation GW observatories, connecting feature extraction from strain time series data to robust signal-noise classification within a setup that can be extended to real data and to more advanced neural network architectures.

 - **Abstract**
 In galaxy clusters, hierarchical assembly predicts the formation of stellar substructures and intracluster light (ICL), a diffuse stellar component tracing the global cluster potential. Because these features are extremely faint, alternative tracers such as globular clusters (GCs) provide a powerful tool to study cluster assembly. We use deep VLT/FORS $V$- and $I$-band imaging to investigate the GC population in the nearby Hydra I galaxy cluster ($\sim 45.7$ Mpc). GC candidates were selected from the $VI$ colour-magnitude diagram and divided into blue and red subpopulations. We find a clear spatial dichotomy: red GCs are concentrated around the massive central galaxies NGC 3311 and NGC 3309, while blue GCs are more extended and offset from the centre, coinciding with a secondary peak of X-ray-emitting gas. In the central regions, GC spatial distributions further depend on stellar population properties: young metal-rich GCs are more extended and may be linked to ram-pressure stripping, whereas old metal-poor GCs are more centrally concentrated, possibly originating from disrupted dwarf galaxies. Comparing the GC number density profiles to the surface brightness profile of NGC 3311, we find that the red GCs closely follow the galaxy light, while the blue population significantly deviates from it and traces the global gravitational potential of the cluster. This is also reflected in the specific frequency of blue GCs, which is approximately $\sim 5\times$ higher in the ICL-dominated outskirts than in the inner regions dominated by red GCs. Finally, we present a novel method to constrain the evolution of the galaxy luminosity function of the cluster using GC specific frequencies and colour distributions, yielding a past faint-end slope of $\alpha=-1.81^{+0.16}_{-0.16}$ compared to $\alpha=-1.41^{+0.08}_{-0.05}$ today, consistent with high-redshift observations and cosmological simulations.
#### UV and Optical Signatures of Late-time Disk Instabilities in Tidal Disruption Events

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are unique probes of evolving accretion in supermassive black holes. Recent models of TDE disks show that they undergo brief thermal instabilities with temporal super-Eddington accretion at late times, which has been suggested as a possibility to explain the ubiquitous late radio emergence in TDEs. We model the ultraviolet (UV) and optical signatures of such disk instabilities, expected from the accretion power being reprocessed by the optically-thick outflow following super-Eddington accretion. Our model predicts brief UV-bright transients lasting for days, with luminosities of $10^{42}$-$10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in near-UV and $10^{41}$-$10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in optical for a typical TDE by a $10^6~M_\odot$ black hole. These could be detectable by near-future surveys such as ULTRASAT, Vera C. Rubin Observatory and Argus Array, for TDEs of redshifts out to $\approx 0.1$. We further conduct a search for these transients in existing nearby TDEs using data from the Zwicky Transient Facility, placing upper limits on the flare rate for each TDE of $1$-$2$ yr$^{-1}$ dependent on the outflow mass. In the era of future surveys, combined UV/optical and radio monitoring would be an important test to the disk instability phenomena, as well as its explanation for the late-time radio emission in TDEs.

 - **Abstract**
 The dynamical nature and formation mechanism(s) of galactic spiral arms remain long-standing problems in astrophysics. Most theoretical work is based on analytic calculations or idealised simulations, which has yielded several theories of spiral structure. The radial profile of the spiral arm rotation speed - the pattern speed - is a key observable prediction of these theories. However, observations that infer spiral pattern speeds reveal a mixed picture with no clear consensus. Here, we expand on theoretical efforts by examining the pattern speed profiles in the Auriga Superstars set of high-resolution cosmological magnetohydrodynamic simulatons of Milky Way-mass spiral disc galaxies. These simulations combine galaxy formation in a cosmological environment with the high dynamical fidelity afforded by an $\sim 800$ $\rm M_{\odot}$ star particle resolution, giving $\sim 100$ million star particles in the disc. We show that several different spiral arm theories are realised among our simulations, including large-scale kinematic density waves, manifold spirals, dynamic (co-rotating) spirals, and overlapping modes. In particular, we demonstrate that a strong tidal interaction leads to clear kinematic density waves, and that manifold spirals are present in a strongly-barred galaxy. Interestingly, we find that the same galaxy may show qualitative evolution of their spiral pattern speed profiles, indicating that the nature of spiral arms can evolve on potentially sub-Gigayear timescales. Our results demonstrate that in the absence of a strong external encounter or a strong bar, galactic spiral structure is highly transitional and complex with no clear long-lived underlying wave.
#### The dependence of triggering mechanisms on radio AGN sub-types: the role of galaxy mergers

 - **Abstract**
 Powerful, radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN) are associated with one of the most important forms of AGN feedback, and understanding how they are triggered is key to properly incorporating them into models of galaxy evolution. Here, we present the results of a deep Isaac Newton Telescope/Wide Field Camera imaging survey which, when combined with Gemini/Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph South images, gives a 98 per cent complete sample of 112 3CR radio galaxies with redshifts $z$ < 0.3, alongside a stellar mass matched control sample. Our results provide strong evidence for significant differences ($\sim$3$\sigma$) between the triggering mechanisms of the different sub-types of powerful radio AGN. The high-excitation radio galaxies (HERGs) show a high rate of morphological disturbance (62$^{+6}_{-7}$ per cent) -- an excess of $\sim$4$\sigma$ compared with the control sample -- consistent with them being predominantly triggered in galaxy mergers and interactions. In contrast, the low-excitation radio galaxies (LERGs) show a much lower rate of morphological disturbance (36$^{+7}_{-6}$ per cent), consistent with the control sample, and suggesting a different dominant triggering mechanism, such as the accretion of gas from the hot X-ray haloes of the host galaxies or galaxy clusters. We also demonstrate that, when considering the radio morphology, the FRII HERG sources preferentially reside in disturbed morphologies, a difference of $\sim$3$\sigma$ to the FRII LERG objects. This suggests that the FRII LERG sources do not solely represent a `switched-off' phase in the HERG lifecycle of the same parent galaxy population as the FRII HERGs.

 - **Abstract**
 Dynamical tides can provide us vital information about the properties of neutron star (NS) matter. This is particularly true for g-modes, whose frequency and tidal coupling are highly sensitive to the composition of NSs, especially in their centers, where microphysical models are the least reliable. However, due to their weak coupling to external tidal fields, their effect on the gravitational-wave (GW) signal of binary inspirals can be difficult to observe. Here we show that the detectability of these tides can be significantly enhanced by binary NSs with moderate eccentricities. This is primarily due to higher eccentric harmonics in the early phase of the binary evolution experiencing larger phase shifts, which they transport to the sensitive band of GW detectors. In addition, g-mode tides in eccentric binaries undergo several epicyclic resonances, which also amplify the total phase shift. We demonstrate that these effects increase the detectability of g-mode dynamical tides by more than an order of magnitude for eccentricities of $e_\mathrm{10Hz}\sim0.2-0.4$, making it possible to put robust constraints on g-mode properties using current GW detectors, while all relevant models could potentially be constrained with eccentric binary NSs with Einstein Telescope.

 - **Abstract**
 Circumgalactic gas around massive galaxies generally has a volume-filling component -- an atmosphere -- with a temperature determined by the potential-well depth of the galaxy's halo. If the atmosphere is near hydrostatic equilibrium and is stable to convection, then it can remain nearly homogeneous, as long as it is not too dense. But if its density is great enough, it becomes prone to producing a rain of cold clouds that fall toward the galaxy's center and accrete onto its central black hole. Here we explain how relatively weak magnetic fields enhance a galactic atmosphere's tendency to produce cold clouds and how the cold gas becomes organized into vertically elongated, highly magnetized filaments descending at sub-Keplerian speeds. It is intended to complement recent numerical simulations of the process and to serve as a guide to interpreting both simulations and observations of the filamentary gas in hot galactic atmospheres.
#### AGN in massive galaxies identified via optical broadband variability: lessons from VST-COSMOS for future LSST science

 - **Abstract**
 We study the properties of 56 massive (M$_{\rm{\star}}$ > 10$^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$) galaxies at $z<1$ that host AGN, detected via their broadband optical variability in the VST-COSMOS survey. VST-COSMOS provides a nearly-identical single visit depth ($r$ $\sim$ 24.6 mag) and temporal baseline (eleven years) as the forthcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), albeit in a much smaller 1 deg$^2$ footprint (four orders of magnitude smaller than that of the LSST). We compare the properties (morphologies, the presence of interactions, rest-frame colours and environment) of our AGN to galaxies in a control sample, which are drawn from the non-variable population and matched in redshift and stellar mass to their AGN counterparts. The fraction of AGN with early-type morphology ($\sim$55 per cent) and the fraction that is interacting ($\sim$23 per cent) are similar to what is observed in the controls, suggesting that these AGN are not primarily triggered by interactions. Similarly, the AGN and controls do not show strong differences in their rest-frame $(u-z)$ colours or local environment, suggesting that neither the recent star formation histories nor the surroundings of the AGN are strongly atypical of the general galaxy population. This study provides a glimpse into forthcoming AGN science using the LSST. With vastly improved statistics, LSST will offer unprecedented insights into AGN demographics, host-galaxy evolution and the processes that fuel supermassive black holes, potentially reshaping our understanding of their place in the Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 [ABRIDGED] Galaxy evolution is shaped by internal and external mechanisms that regulate the baryon cycle and star formation activity. We present a theoretical framework based on the GAlaxy Evolution and Assembly (GAEA) semi-analytic model. We extracted portions of simulated volumes that include isolated galaxies, pairs, group, and filament members at z ~ 0, specifically avoiding massive clusters. Galaxies were classified using both intrinsic (halo-based) and observational (2D projected) parameterizations, reconstructing their environmental histories from z = 2 and identifying mergers, tidal interactions, ram pressure stripping (RPS), and starvation. 2D information decreases isolated and group fractions while doubles pairs. More than half of galaxies remain unaffected by the investigated processes since z = 2. Among affected galaxies, mergers dominate at high stellar masses (40-60% at log(M*/Msun) > 10.5). Tidal interactions are less frequent, and their incidence increases with stellar mass. RPS dominates in groups and filaments at intermediate masses (~50%), while starvation ranges from 20 to 30%. The incidence of the different mechanisms depends strongly on both mass and environment, though their imprints on global properties are often subtle. Distinct evolutionary pathways emerge: log(M*/Msun) < 9.5, galaxies in groups and filaments have a faster mass growth than galaxies in the other environments, especially those undergoing starvation, mergers and, to less extent, RPS. Differences are reduced moving to higher masses, where no clear dependence on physical mechanism emerge, even though at these masses a clear star formation suppression is evident in mergers and starved galaxies. This theoretical investigation provides essential context for the recently started multi-wavelength program Mechanisms Affecting Galaxies Nearby and Environmental Trends (MAGNET), which we introduce here.

 - **Abstract**
 Superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) remain an intriguing topic in supernova (SN) transient astronomy. While the majority of SLSNe are shown to be explained by energy streaming from the newly born magnetar, there are others which are powered by different mechanisms. We analyse the pseudo-bolometric light curve of the nearby helium-rich SLSN 2021bnw. We built models and run hydrodynamics radiative-transfer simulations with STELLA. Our best-fit models include 15-22.5 Msun of ejecta enriched with 1.7 Msun of 56 Ni and carrying energy of 4 foe, and colliding w ith 7 Msun of circumstellar matter which match the observed light curve very well. The early data can be explained as cooling of an expanding shell with the mass of 0.5 Msun and kinetic energy of 0.7 foe. We tend to exclude a pulsational pair-instability (PPISN) origin for SLSN 2021bnw. Instead we conclude that SLSN 2021bnw was preferably a core-collapse explosion of a star with the initial mass of not less than 61 Msun aided by magnetorotational effects.
#### Multi-Arrival Infrasound from Meteoroids: Fragmentation Signatures versus Propagation Effects in a Fine-Scale Layered Atmosphere

 - **Abstract**
 Infrasonic signatures of meteoroid fragmentation are frequently ambiguous: do multiple arrivals signify a complex breakup or merely the distorting effects of a layered atmosphere? Resolving this ambiguity is critical for accurate energy estimates and source reconstruction. In this study, we address this challenge by analyzing a unique regional dataset of well-constrained meteoroid events observed by the Southern Ontario Meteor Network and the co-located Elginfield Infrasound Array. We employ pseudo-differential parabolic equation (PPE) simulations to quantify how fine-scale gravity-wave structures in the stratosphere and lower thermosphere modify acoustic waveforms at ranges <300 km. Our modeling reveals that while fine-scale layering can stretch signals and generate diffuse oscillatory tails, it does not produce discrete, high-amplitude pulse splitting at ranges below ~140 km. By applying these results to the rare multi-arrival event 20060305, we demonstrate that its distinct double arrival at 100 km range is inconsistent with atmospheric multipathing and provides definitive evidence of separate fragmentation episodes. These findings establish new diagnostic criteria for separating source physics from propagation artifacts, improving the reliability of infrasound as a monitoring tool for natural bolides, space debris re-entries, and catastrophic launch failures.

 - **Abstract**
 The Global Positioning System (GPS) includes a continuously operating, planet-scale network of atomic clocks that, beyond navigation and time dissemination, enables precision tests of fundamental physics. Here we use GPS carrier phase archival data to perform a retrospective search for exotic low-mass fields (ELFs) that might be emitted by the binary neutron-star merger GW170817, complementing gravitational wave and electromagnetic modalitiesnin multi-messenger astronomy. Such ultra-relativistic fields would imprint a dispersive, anti-chirp signature in clock-frequency time series, delayed with respect to the LIGO-Virgo gravitational wave detection. We construct network-median pseudo-frequency data from eighteen Rb satellite clocks referenced to a terrestrial hydrogen maser and conduct a template-bank search spanning ELF pulse duration, arrival delay, and characteristic frequency. No statistically significant signal is observed after accounting for noise statistics and template-bank trials. We derive 95\% confidence-level lower bounds on the interaction energy scale $\Lambda_\alpha$ of quadratic couplings driving variations in electromagnetic fine-structure constant. These limits improve upon existing astrophysical and gravity-test constraints across the ELF-energy range $\approx10^{-18}$--$10^{-14}\,\mathrm{eV}$. This demonstrates that mature global satellite-clock networks provide an observational capability for retrospective, multi-messenger searches for new physics using decades of archival timing data.
#### New Insights from Revisiting the Rotation Period of the Strongly Magnetic O Star, NGC 1624-2

 - **Abstract**
 NGC 1624-2 hosts the strongest surface magnetic field found on an O star thus far. When applied across several epochs of observations, the star's currently accepted rotation period (157.99 d) does not coherently characterize the variations of spectral lines of magnetospheric origin. We analyze Lomb-Scargle periodograms produced with new and archival, multi-instrument spectroscopic time series of Balmer H and He spectral lines. We find that 153.17 $\pm$ 0.42 d and 306.56 $\pm$ 1.19 d are both equally suitable periods at phasing the spectral and magnetic time series data in a manner consistent with the Oblique Rotator Model. The 306.56 d period implies a magnetic geometry for NGC 1624-2 that is quite different from the previously accepted one, for which both magnetic poles should be observed during a full rotational cycle. If this is the case, the star's magnetic South pole has yet to be observed, and additional spectropolarimetric observations should be acquired in order to confirm whether or not the south pole is in fact observable.

 - **Abstract**
 It is not fully understood why some solar filaments erupt while others do not. Those that do typically undergo a slow rise followed by an acceleration phase, though this transition requires further investigation. Erupting prominences have been observed to heat up during the acceleration phase, but the origin of this heating remains unclear. Moreover, some coronal mass ejections possess additional fine structure in white-light observations beyond the classical three-part morphology. We aim to elaborate on the dynamics of erupting prominences, investigate the heating during the acceleration phase, and correlate our findings with observations. We employ the open-source MPI-AMRVAC code to solve the 2.5D MHD equations on a coronal domain extending to 300 Mm, using adaptive mesh refinement to attain high resolution. Controlled combinations of footpoint shearing and converging motions applied to an initial magnetic arcade produce erupting flux ropes with self-consistent prominence and coronal rain formation due to thermal instability. We find both non-erupting and erupting cases related to the system energization. Comparison with observations from the AIA Filament Eruption Catalog shows that the slow-rise and impulsive phases are modulated by magnetic reconnection. The transition to acceleration corresponds to an increase in the inflow Alfvén Mach number. Thermal conduction and compressional heating can lead to prominence evaporation. We obtain nested circular fine structure in EUV images of the ejected flux ropes, partly resulting from plasmoid interactions. We conclude that internal heating processes and magnetic reconnection play key roles in the early evolution of CMEs.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves and/or the braiding of magnetic field lines are largely thought to be responsible for heating the solar corona, both being mechanisms which are driven by the Sun's photospheric magnetic field. Recent modelling work leads us to expect that such heating mechanisms would be seen in the excess broadening (non-thermal velocity) of coronal spectral emission lines and that larger magnitudes of photospheric magnetic flux would generate more heating, but a direct connection between magnetic flux and spectral line broadening has been difficult to establish. We combine measurements of the photospheric magnetic field from SDO/HMI and non-thermal velocity in log T~6.2 coronal plasma from Hinode/EIS for 28 active regions and find a moderate correlation between the two exists in quiescent active regions, consistent with the photospheric field injecting upward Poynting flux into the solar corona and causing coronal heating. We find that no strong correlation with coronal composition makes it difficult to distinguish between MHD wave heating and magnetic field braiding heating using these diagnostics with current instrumentation.
#### A homogeneous view of asymptotic giant branch carbon stars as seen by Gaia

 - **Abstract**
 Carbon stars on the asymptotic giant branch are major contributors to galactic dust enrichment, with gas mass-loss rates up to 1e-4 Msun/yr. We present a homogeneous spectral energy distribution analysis of the Gaia DR3 Golden Sample of carbon stars in the Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds. Our dataset includes 14,747 sources with multi-band photometry from Gaia, 2MASS, and WISE, combined with recent distance and extinction estimates. For a subsample of 2,494 Mira variables, we model multi-band light curves to derive accurate mean magnitudes. Stellar and circumstellar parameters are obtained by fitting observations with a large grid of synthetic spectra computed with the DUSTY radiative transfer code using COMARCS atmospheres. We derive effective temperature, optical depth, and gas mass-loss rate for each source. The distributions peak around Teff = 3150 K, with mass-loss rates spanning 1e-11 to 1e-4 Msun/yr and inner dust temperatures near 1000 K. We find a correlation between variability amplitude and mass-loss rate. This framework provides a statistically robust view of carbon stars across environments with different metallicities. Apparent environmental dependencies are influenced by luminosity distributions and selection effects rather than purely intrinsic metallicity differences. The combined Gaia and WISE selection limits the detection of both highly obscured and faint Magellanic Cloud sources, but the observed trends remain significant within the sampled populations.

 - **Abstract**
 Radio wave propagation can be perturbed by compact ionized gas clumps through plasma lensing, which induces frequency dependent magnification and may distort the observed number counts of background sources. The quasar (QSO) number densities are a powerful probe for understanding the effects of intervening material. Absorption lines in QSO spectra reveal the presence of interstellar and intergalactic gas, which can change observed fluxes through dust extinction and plasma lensing. By combining observations from radio (VLASS), infrared (WISE), and optical bands (DESI), we assembled a sample of QSOs: ~4000 sources with MgII absorbers, and ~12, 000 non-absorbers. In the radio band, the MgII sample shows a moderate excess at the bright end of the flux distribution, which is broadly consistent with plasma lensing predications. In the optical, the MgII sample turns over at higher g-band fluxes and exhibits a steeper decline at the faint end than the non-MgII sample. Control samples were constructed by matching in redshift, infrared (W1), and optical (g) luminosities. In these comparisons, the radio excess becomes less prominent, suggesting that the apparent magnification may not be robust evidence for plasma lensing. Nevertheless, a weak contribution cannot be ruled out, especially given residual excess observed at the bright end relative to the non-MgII sample. Dust extinction along the line-of-sight remains a plausible alternative. Regardless of the dominant mechanism, the multi-wavelength differences offer a valuable probe of the physical state of the intervening medium.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding how supermassive black holes (BHs) couple to their host galaxies across a vast spatial and temporal dynamic range remains a central challenge in galaxy evolution. Using the multizone framework -- designed to capture bidirectional inflow--outflow from the event horizon to the Bondi scale -- we present a suite of long-duration GRMHD simulations spanning BH spins $|a_\ast|=0$--0.9 and Bondi radii $R_B/r_g=4\times10^2$--$2\times10^6$. From these simulations we derive spin-dependent subgrid prescriptions from first principles, applicable to hot accretion flows with low-Eddington ratios ($f_{\rm Edd}\lesssim10^{-3}$), for adoption in cosmological simulations and semi-analytic models. We provide compact analytic fits for the time-averaged accretion rate $\dot M(R_B,a_\ast)$ and feedback power $\dot E_{\rm fb}(R_B,a_\ast)$ with respect to the Bondi rate $\dot{M}_B$, which are largely insensitive to the initial gas configuration and magnetic field strength. To capture intrinsic time-variability, we also quantify the full distributions of $\dot M$ and feedback efficiency $\eta$, both well described by lognormal statistics, with widths that increase toward larger $R_B$. We further measure self-consistent spin evolution in the hot accretion mode, finding that the spin-up parameter varies as $s(a_\ast)\simeq -3.7\,a_\ast$, which implies a very long spindown timescale $t_s\simeq 12(10^{-3}/f_{\rm Edd})\,{\rm Gyr}$. Thus, BH spins are effectively frozen during phases of quiescent accretion. Compared to conventional small-domain GRMHD calculations, our simulations, which reach dynamical equilibrium across horizon-to-galaxy scales, yield systematically different long-term accretion, feedback, and spin properties, cautioning against direct extrapolation from small-scale GRMHD simulations when constructing galactic-scale subgrid models.

 - **Abstract**
 Spectroscopic and spectropolarimetric observations, which rely on the Doppler effect, only provide access to the line-of-sight component of the solar plasma velocity (vz). However, many dynamic processes in the solar atmosphere involve strong horizontal motions (in the plane perpendicular to the line-of-sight: vx, vy). Existing methods for estimating horizontal velocities are generally insensitive to variations in height (the z-coordinate), providing them only on a single plane perpendicular to the line-of-sight: vx(x,y), vy(x,y). Motivated by the fact that modern analysis techniques allow us to retrieve the height dependence of vz and B, our goal is to infer also this height dependence for the horizontal velocity field in the solar atmosphere. As a first step, we present, and test a method for the two-dimensional case on the (y,z) plane so as to show that the z dependence can be successfully retrieved. The components of the two-dimensional magnetic induction equation are discretized via finite differences, leading to an overdetermined system whose solution provides vy. The method assumes that B, its time variation, as well as vz are known. This is currently possible through modern Stokes inversion techniques applied to spatially and temporally resolved spectropolarimetric observations. Using analytically prescribed values and two-dimensional magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of the solar surface, we demonstrate that, in these idealized cases, the horizontal velocity component in a two-dimensional domain, can be successfully recovered with a mean error of about 1 %. The proposed method successfully retrieves the horizontal velocity field in the (y,z) plane, thereby establishing the foundation for future extensions to three-dimensional reconstructions of the horizontal velocity field.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar granulation consists of dynamic convective plasma cells that rise from the solar interior to the surface. The interaction between these plasma cells and the Sun's magnetic field provides valuable insights into plasma dynamics near the solar surface and how they evolve in the presence of magnetic fields. This study analyses the morphological characteristics of solar convective cells, investigating the relationship between magnetic field properties and granule dynamics - specifically how granule area, shape, and brightness vary under different magnetic field conditions. Observations of the active region NOAA 11768 were taken with the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST). A segmentation algorithm was applied to continuum intensity images to identify individual granules and determine their sizes, shapes, and mean brightness. The magnetic field vector and line-of-sight velocity were derived from CRISP spectropolarimetric data to investigate their role in shaping granule properties. We find that granular area decreases systematically with increasing magnetic field strength, with the largest granules occurring in non-magnetic regions and a mean granule area of approximately 1.58 arcsec$^2$ (effective diameter of 1.42 arcseconds). Both mean continuum intensity and granule size decrease with stronger fields, confirming the suppression of convective energy transport in magnetised regions. No correlation was found between mean granule brightness and mean up-flow velocity. Highly elongated granules appear in both magnetic and non-magnetic regions, while near-circular granules are exclusive to non-magnetic areas. An alignment between granule major axes and magnetic field azimuth is observed where the horizontal field component is strong, confirming that granules are highly sensitive to magnetic fields, which inhibit the lateral expansion of convective cells.

 - **Abstract**
 Disc galaxies exhibit radial metallicity gradients in both their stellar and gaseous components. The star-forming gas (SFG) in HII regions and young stars (YSs) trace the recent evolutionary history of the galaxy. We aim to assess the extent to which the joint analysis of metallicity gradient alignment in YSs and SFG can constrain the recent evolutionary history of galaxies. Using the high-resolution run of the EAGLE project, we derived radial, azimuthally averaged oxygen abundance profiles for YSs (age < 2 Gyr) and SFG and measured their gradients as the slopes of linear fits to these profiles. We classified galaxies into four groups based on the signs (N for negative and P for positive) of the slopes: NN, NP, PP, and PN (the first letter is for YSs and the second for SFG). We found that galaxies with NN, NP, PP, and PN combinations of metallicity profiles reflect different evolutionary paths over the past ~ 2 Gyr. NN galaxies exhibit sustained inside-out growth accompanied by high star formation efficiency, whereas NP and PP systems show evidence of recent or ongoing feedback-driven disruption, with PP galaxies likely being predominantly shaped by supernova feedback. PN galaxies, by contrast, show evidence of past violent events followed by gradient recovery, highlighting the interplay between inflows, feedback, and gas cooling in shaping metallicity distributions. The degree of alignment between the stellar and gas metallicity gradients provides a way to time the occurrence of significant events in the evolutionary history of galaxies, which contribute through a combination of gas inflows, star formation triggering, and metal mixing. They could also serve as probes of sub-grid physics when observations provide suitable comparison datasets. [Abridged]

 - **Abstract**
 Multimessenger observation of the Seyfert-starburst composite galaxies NGC 1068 and NGC 7469 indicate a characteristic feature in the radio band (the so-called mm-bump) as well as indication of high-energy neutrinos by the AGN corona. Moreover, also the starburst ring of these sources is bright in the radio and hence, a potential source of $\gamma$-rays and neutrinos. We aim to explain the non-thermal features of these two sources with our homogeneous steady-state Seyfert-starburst composite model, which we refined in this work. Hereby, we account for stochastic diffuse acceleration and energy losses within the corona and $\gamma\gamma$-pair attenuation of the escaping $\gamma$-rays. Since the non-thermal features of Seyfert sources contribute only marginally to the electromagnetic spectrum, only few data points can be assigned to the starburst ring or the AGN corona. Hence, prior information on the physical parameters is incorporated within a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to avoid overfitting. Based on this Bayesian parameter study we show, that the non-thermal features of NGC 1068 can be explained well. Still a more detailed treatment of the spatial inhomogeneities in the central region of the AGN could further improve the fit results. This manifests itself even more clearly in the case of NGC 7469, where the mm-bump needs to emerge from a coronal size $R_{\rm c}>100\,\mathcal{R}_{\rm s}$, whereas (TeV-PeV)-neutrino emission requires $R_{\rm c}< 10\,\mathcal{R}_{\rm s}$. Similar to what has previously been shown in other wavebands, our analysis highlights that the spatial extension of the so-called AGN corona depends the considered energy of the messenger. Hence, it seems that there is not a unique edge of the corona and a substantial progress in the understanding of these phenomena is expected if future analysis account for these spatial inhomogeneities.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze decay phase observations of the GOES class C6.7 flare SOL2022-08-19T20:31 by the Visible Spectropolarimeter (ViSP) on the National Science Foundation's Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST). The data include the first flare-time DKIST observations of the chromospheric Ca II H 396.8 nm and H-epsilon 397.0 nm spectral lines. These diagnostics have rarely been studied together during the modern era of high-resolution solar flare observations, and never at the spectral and spatial resolution of the DKIST. We directly compare DKIST spectra to state-of-the-art RADYN+RH simulations, including one heated by a nonthermal electron beam and one by in-situ thermal conduction. While certain salient properties of the spectra such as the width of H-epsilon are reproduced, the models severely underestimate the width of Ca II H in the red wing and fail to reproduce the exact relative intensity of Ca II H to H-epsilon. The models exhibit a range of condensation electron densities spanning over an order of magnitude. Unlike the modeled lower-order Balmer-series lines, we find that the width of H-epsilon is not solely related to the condensation properties; the widths and intensities are also sensitive to the deeper flare layers. We outline possible avenues towards improvement of flare models, such as a comprehensive evaluation of flare heating mechanisms in the context of both impulsive and decay phase high-resolution data.
#### Impact of rotation on the amplitude of acoustic modes in solar-like stars: Insights from hydrodynamical simulations

 - **Abstract**
 In solar-like stars, acoustic modes provide the main way of probing their internal structure and dynamics. Although these modes are expected to be ubiquitous in stars with convective envelopes, Kepler observations reveal that a significant fraction of solar-like stars show no detectable acoustic modes, particularly among rapidly rotating and magnetically active stars. Recent theoretical work by Bessila et al. (2025) has proposed that rotation tends to inhibit convective motions, thereby reducing the power available for stochastic mode excitation. Here, we test this prediction using fully compressible hydrodynamical simulations of a solar-like star. We perform a series of 2.5D simulations, which consider longitudinal symmetry, using the MUSIC code spanning rotation rates from 0 to 8 $\Omega_{\odot}$. We find a clear and systematic decline of acoustic mode amplitudes with increasing rotation rate. In the most rapidly rotating models, mode damping rates are also enhanced. The combined reduction in excitation and increase in damping with increasing rotation rate provide a physical explanation for the observed decrease in mode detectability in rapidly rotating solar-like stars. Our results demonstrate that rotation can significantly modify oscillation properties and must be accounted for when interpreting asteroseismic observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Molecular gas is crucial to understanding star formation and galaxy evolution, but the giant molecular clouds (GMCs) of early-type galaxies (ETGs) have rarely been studied. Here, we present analyses of the spatially resolved GMCs of the lenticular galaxy NGC 1387, exploiting high spatial resolution (0.15" or 14 pc) 12CO(2-1) line observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. We identify 1285 individual GMCs and measure the fundamental properties (radius, velocity dispersion, and molecular gas mass) of each with a modified version of the CPROPStoo package. Unusually for an ETG, the GMCs of NGC 1387 follow scaling relations very similar to those of the Milky Way disc and Local Group galaxy clouds, and most are virialised. GMCs with large masses and radii and/or small galactocentric distances have their angular momenta aligned with the large-scale galactic rotation, while other GMCs do not. These results show that ETGs have more diversified GMC properties than previously thought. We discuss potential reasons for such diversity, and viewing-angle dependency is a plausible candidate.

 - **Abstract**
 21cm radiation from neutral hydrogen serves as a direct probe of the Epoch of Reionization. However, both its detection and physical interpretation are severely hindered by contamination from astrophysical foreground emission and instrumental noise that are several orders of magnitude brighter than the signal of interest. A promising way to tackle these challenges is to cross-correlate the 21cm signal with other independent tracers of large-scale structure, most notably high-redshift galaxies. Besides validating putative 21cm detections, such joint analyses are expected to provide independent insights into the properties of ionizing sources and the evolving morphology of ionized regions during reionization. The 21cm signal, however, is intrinsically highly non-Gaussian, limiting the effectiveness of conventional two-point cross-correlation statistics, which capture information only up to the second order. In this work, we therefore investigate the utility of k-nearest-neighbour cumulative distribution functions (kNN CDF), which encode information from the joint clustering at all orders, as an alternative framework for probing 21cm-galaxy cross-correlations. Using self-consistently simulated mock 21cm fields and a catalog of line-emitting galaxies at z = 7, we conducted a proof-of-concept study comparing the kNN CDF formalism and the two-point cross-correlation approach. We find that the kNN CDF statistics outperform the two-point statistics in detecting 21cm-galaxy cross-correlations, even in the presence of instrumental noise and aggressive foreground filtering. Moreover, at a fixed global ionized fraction, it is even able to differentiate between reionization models that remain indistinguishable using two-point statistics. These results demonstrate the power and unexplored potential of exploiting higher-order statistics for extracting maximal information from 21cm-galaxy synergies.
