#### Radio Emission from the Infrared Tidal Disruption Event WTP14adeqka: The First Directly Resolved Delayed Outflow from a TDE

 - **Abstract**
 We present detailed radio observations of the mid-infrared (MIR) tidal disruption event (TDE) WTP14adeqka. We detect rising radio emission starting $\approx 4$ years after the discovery of the MIR emission (and about 2 years after its peak), peaking at $\approx 6.5$ years and declining thereafter, reminiscent of the delayed radio emission recently identified in optically discovered TDEs. The peak radio luminosity, $\nu L_\nu\approx 2\times 10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$, is comparable to the brightest radio emission in optical TDEs. Multi-frequency radio observations at 8.9 and 9.7 years reveal a non-relativistic outflow with a mean expansion velocity of $\approx 0.021c$ (for an assumed launch at the time of disruption) and an energy of $\approx 10^{50.7}$ erg, about an order of magnitude larger than in typical optical TDEs. More importantly, Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations at the same epochs directly resolve the radio source and reveal an increase in size from approximately 0.11 pc to 0.13 pc (with no apparent astrometric shift), corresponding to an expansion velocity of $\approx 0.05c$, and a likely delayed launch by about 2 years. The VLBA size measurements rule out an off-axis jet launched at the time of disruption, which would have an expected size of $\gtrsim {\rm pc}$ on these timescales; the possibility of a delayed jet can be evaluated with future VLBA observations. We conclude that MIR TDEs can launch energetic, delayed outflows. Ongoing radio observations of the full MIR TDE sample will reveal whether this behavior is ubiquitous.

 - **Abstract**
 Interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs), the large-scale eruptive phenomena capable of shedding a huge amount of solar magnetic helicity and energy are potential in driving strong geomagnetic storms. They complexly evolve while preceded and followed by other large-scale structures e.g. ICMEs. Magnetic interaction among multiple ICMEs may result intense and long-lived geomagnetic storms. Our aim is to understand the reason of substantial changes in the geoeffectivity of two meso-scale separated counterparts of a complex solar wind structure through investigating their magnetic content e.g. helicity, energy and magnetic interaction among multiple ICMEs. We utilized the insitu observations of solar wind from Wind and Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory-A (STA) spacecraft during the strongest geomagnetic storm period in past two decades on May 10-11, 2024 and heliospheric imagers onboard STA. Our investigation confirms complex interactions among five ICMEs resulting in distinct counterparts within a coalescing large-scale structure. These counterparts possess substantially different magnetic contents. We conclude that the complex counterpart resulted from the interaction among common-origin ICMEs observed by STA, favorably orientated for magnetic reconnection, had 1.6 and 2.8 times higher total magnetic energy and helicity, respectively, than the counterpart containing a left-handed filament-origin ICME observed by Wind. The left-handed ICME non-favorably oriented for magnetic reconnection with the surrounding right-handed, common-origin ICMEs. Therefore, two medium-separated counterparts despite belonging to a common solar wind structure, were potential to lead different geoeffectivity. This ultimately challenges space weather predictions based on early observations.
#### Soot Planets instead of Water Worlds

 - **Abstract**
 Some low-density exoplanets are thought to be water-rich worlds that formed beyond the snow line of their protoplanetary disc, possibly accreting coequal portions of rock and water. However, the compositions of bodies within the Solar System and the stability of volatile-rich solids in accretionary disks suggest that a planet rich in water should also acquire as much as 40% refractory organic carbon ("soot"). This would reduce the water mass fraction well below 50%, making the composition of these planets similar to those of Solar System comets. Here we show that soot-rich planets, with or without water, can account for the low average densities of exoplanets that were previously attributed to a binary combination of rock and water. Formed in locations beyond the soot and/or snow lines in disks, these planets are likely common in our galaxy and already observed by JWST. The surfaces and interiors of soot-rich planets will be influenced by the chemical and physical properties of carbonaceous phases, and the atmospheres of such planets may contain plentiful methane and other hydrocarbons, with implications for photochemical haze generation and habitability.

 - **Abstract**
 The high-redshift ($z>4$) compact sources with ``V-shaped" spectral energy distributions (SEDs), known as Little Red Dots (LRDs), are discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope and provide valuable clues to the physics of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the early universe. The nature of LRDs is controversial. Recently, several studies have investigated LRDs through variability, a characteristic feature of AGNs. These studies explore LRD variability by extrapolating empirical relationships from local quasars. Here, we adopt the Corona-heated Accretion-disk Reprocessing (CHAR) model, which is motivated by accretion physics and applicable to reproduce AGN conventional variability, to study the variability of $22$ LRDs in \citet{Tee2025}. Our results indicate that the observed variability in LRDs is dominated by measurement uncertainties. Within the CHAR model, the lack of variability in LRDs can be explained by two scenarios: either AGNs contribute $\lesssim30\%$ of the observed luminosities, or they are intrinsically luminous AGNs. We use simulations to demonstrate the observational requirements to effectively investigate LRDs via variability: first, a sample of about $200$ LRDs; second, each LRD has two observations separated by at least two years in the observed frame; third, the photometric uncertainty is $\leq 0.07$ mag. If the LRDs still lack variability under these conditions, the time-domain study would provide independent evidence that the accretion mode of LRDs differs significantly from low-redshift quasars.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the thermodynamic properties of a non-interacting, relativistic gas of charged scalar bosons in a uniform magnetic field, including both statistical and vacuum contributions at arbitrary field strengths. Focusing on the low-temperature regime and separating the Lowest Landau Level (LLL) from excited states provides a clearer view of the magnetic field's impact on thermodynamic quantities. We revisit Bose Einstein condensation (BEC), specific heat, magnetization, and the equation of state (EoS). A central result is the diffuse character of BEC induced by the magnetic field, reflected in the specific heat, which exhibits two plateaus: the first appears when the system becomes effectively one-dimensional through magnetic confinement, while the second-associated with the true one-particle ground state-is suppressed by the field. Consequently, no critical condensation temperature arises. For magnetization, the LLL contribution shifts from diamagnetic to paramagnetic As the field strengthen with the inclusion of the excited states, the statistical magnetization remains negative. In contrast, the vacuum contribution dominates at strong fields, driving paramagnetic. We also show that antiparticles enhance specific heat, magnetization, and total pressure. These effects are illustrated for a pion gas under neutron star conditions and compared with previous results for a neutral vector boson system.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic effects have long been considered a possible factor in stabilizing the outer regions of active galactic nuclei (AGN) accretion disks against gravitational instability (GI). However, the computational demands of testing this hypothesis have prevented comprehensive study of this problem. Here, we present results from a suite of 6 isothermal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) shearing box simulations, 3 initialized with strong magnetization ($\beta^{\rm{mid}}_{0} = p_{\rm{gas}} / p_{\rm{mag}} = 10^{2.5}$) and 3 initialized with weak magnetization ($\beta^{\rm mid}_{0} = 10^{4}$). For each magnetization, we performed simulations with both strong ($Q_{0} = 1.0$) and weak ($Q_{0} = 10.0$) self-gravity, where $Q_{0} = \frac{c_{\rm{s}}\Omega}{\pi G \Sigma_{0}}$ is the Toomre stability parameter; we also performed pure MHD simulations for comparison. We find that our strongly magnetized disk stabilized against GI after initialization to critical stability against GI, while our corresponding weakly magnetized disk did not. We show that the strongly magnetized, strongly self-gravitating disk became dominated by magnetic pressure, which led to its stabilization.

 - **Abstract**
 Binary systems surrounded by a circumbinary accretion flow can be subject to strong magnetic fields, potentially altering the character of the accretion flow itself, the evolution of the orbital dynamics, and outflow properties from the system. Here we focus on a regime where magnetic fields become so strong that the outer circumbinary flow becomes magnetically arrested, establishing a (circum)binary magnetically arrested disk ($\textit{BMAD}$) state. Such flows feature quasi-periodic magnetic flux eruptions, power jet-like magnetic tower outflows, and consequently alter the predominant contribution to angular momentum transfer inside the circumbinary disk. In this work, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the properties of these flows around equal-mass binary systems on circular orbits ultilizing massively parallel three-dimensional Newtonian magnetohydrodynamics simulations. We investigate the impact of the equation of state and of dynamical cooling, as well as that of the (large-scale) magnetic field topology. Our findings are as follows: (1) A magnetically arrested accretion flow through the cavity can generally be achieved, so long as the initial seed field is strong enough. (2) The cavity, and magnetic flux tube properties and their subsequent propagation are subject to the choice of equation of state/cooling physics. (3) We find tentative evidence that in some regimes the BMAD state, particularly during a flux eruption cycle, can aid shrinking of the binary's orbit. The regimes we explore have implications for multi-messenger transients to stars, supermassive and stellar black hole binaries and their orbital evolution in gaseous environments.

 - **Abstract**
 The dominant mechanisms underlying high-energy $\gamma$-ray emission from galaxies vary by galaxy type. In starbursts, a major contribution comes from neutral pion decay. This is driven by interactions between interstellar gas and hadronic cosmic rays (CRs), which are accelerated in strong shocks associated star formation activity and stellar remnants. Leptonic $\gamma$-ray emission can also arise from electrons directly energized in interstellar shocks, produced via charged pion decays, or emitted by pulsars and their surrounding halos. In quiescent galaxies, pulsars and their halos can represent a major $\gamma$-ray source class, with millisecond pulsars predominantly located in globular clusters (GCs) being particularly important. Recent detections of very high-energy (VHE) emission from Galactic GCs suggests they may also contribute to the TeV $\gamma$-ray flux from evolved galaxies. We consider a scenario where this VHE emission from GCs is powered by electrons accelerated in communal stellar/pulsar wind cluster termination shocks. These electrons undergo inverse Compton scattering as they propagate into GC magnetotails. Our results show that the high-energy emission from GCs can be an important contributor to the GeV and TeV flux from massive, quiescent galaxies. The relative strength of each component depends on the global galactic properties and its evolutionary history.

 - **Abstract**
 Outflows are a key part of the galactic gas cycle and crucial in shaping the star formation activity in their host galaxy. Yet, in simulations of galaxy evolution, modeling these outflows in their multi-phase nature and over the relevant timescales is an unsolved problem. We present a subgrid model for simulating multiphase galactic outflows in efficient, comparatively low-resolution simulations, designed for application in future cosmological simulations. The cold phase (T = 10000 K) is treated as pressureless, and its interaction with the hot phase is captured through source terms representing drag and mixing. These terms are obtained using analytic drag and mixing terms for single clouds and convolving them with a cloud mass distribution consistent with high-resolution simulations. Applied to a setup resembling the starburst galaxy M82, the model reproduces the velocity, density, and mass outflow rates of high-resolution simulations that resolve individual cold clouds. Cold outflows emerge naturally from interactions between the hot wind and cold interstellar clouds, with drag and mixing both contributing to the acceleration. Varying the mixing strength strongly affects outflow properties: stronger mixing enhances mass transfer from hot to cold gas, reduces the hot phase velocity, and accelerates the cold phase, while also influencing the origin and composition of the cold outflow. Weak mixing produces cold gas mostly from preexisting interstellar clouds, whereas stronger mixing leads to substantial cold gas formation from the hot phase. This framework enables efficient simulations of multiphase galactic outflows while retaining key multi-component features of the outflow dynamics.
#### Subparsec Jet Morphologies of M87 at 43 GHz: Effects of Asymmetric Plasmoids within the Jet

 - **Abstract**
 Radio observations of the M87 jet reveal limb-brightened features that exhibit temporal variations, with the brighter limb side not remaining consistently fixed at the subparsec scales. Utilizing a force-free jet model that considers exclusively the relativistic plasma dynamics along large-scale magnetic fields attached onto the central black hole, we examine the effects of asymmetric plasmoid injections within the subparsec jet. At subparsec scales, the jet velocity is predominantly influenced by poloidal velocity, leading to distinctive characteristics in both the morphology and trajectories of the plasmoids injected within the jet. We explore the potential modifications to the limb-brightened subparsec jet images resulting from the injection of asymmetric, shearing plasma, which is traditionally considered solely under conditions of stationary and symmetric mass loading. By comparing the model jet properties with the 43 GHz observations of the M87 jet, it is suggested that the asymmetric injection of plasmoids within the jet offers a satisfactory explanation for the observed velocity variations and morphological dynamics of the M87 jet.

 - **Abstract**
 Kinematics of solar eruptive filaments is one of the important diagnostic parameters for predicting whether solar eruptions would induce geomagnetic storms. Particularly, some geomagnetic storms might be induced by solar filament eruptions originating from unexpected surface source regions because of non-radial ejection. The non-radial ejection of filaments has received widespread attention but remains inconclusive. We select two eruptive filaments, both of which are supported by flux ropes, as indicated by the hot channel structures seen in the 94 Å images and the hook-shaped brightenings where the filament material falls back. We measure the three-dimensional ejection trajectory of the eruptive filaments by integrating the simultaneous observations from SDO and STEREO. Furthermore, we calculate the distribution of the poloidal field along the ejection path and compare it to the ejection acceleration. It is revealed that the reinforcement of the poloidal magnetic field may lead to the suppression of the acceleration, with the acceleration resuming its increase only when the poloidal field diminishes to a certain level. Additionally, we compute the spatial distribution of the poloidal field in various directions and find that the poloidal magnetic field above the filaments is asymmetric. For both investigated events, the filaments appear to eject towards the side where the poloidal magnetic field is weaker, indicating that the eruptive filaments tend to propagate along the side with weaker strapping force. This may provide a new explanation for the inclined ejection of filaments.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.17059

 - **Abstract**
 We present a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) that generates stellar spectra covering 4000 $\le$ $T_{\mathrm{eff}$ $\le$ 11,000 K, $2.0 \le \log g \le 5.0$ dex, $-1.5 \le [\mathrm{M}/\mathrm{H}] \le +1.5$ dex, $v\sin i \le 300$ km/s, $\xi_t$ between 0 and 4 km/s, and for any instrumental resolving powers less than 115,000. The spectra can be calculated in the wavelength range 4450-5400 Å. Trained on a grid of \textsc{SYNSPEC} spectra, the network synthesizes a spectrum in around two orders of magnitude faster than line-by-line radiative transfer. We validate the CVAE on $10^4$ test spectra unseen during training. Pixel-wise statistics yield a median absolute residual of <$1.8\times10^{-3}$ flux units with no wavelength-dependent bias. A residual error map across the parameters plane shows $\langle|\Delta F|\rangle<2\times10^{-3}$ everywhere, and marginal diagnostics versus $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$, $\log g$, $v\sin i$, $\xi_t$, and $[Fe/H]$\ reveal no relevant trends. These results demonstrate that the CVAE can serve as a drop-in, physics-aware surrogate for radiative transfer codes, enabling real-time forward modeling in stellar parameter inference and offering promising tools for spectra synthesis for large astrophysical data analysis.

 - **Abstract**
 As the frontier of precision astronomical photometry continues to advance, correcting for time-variable atmospheric transmission becomes increasingly important. We describe an observational approach to monitoring optical attenuation due to atmospheric aerosols, using a multiband filter and disperser on the Auxiliary Telescope at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. This configuration allows us to perform simple aperture photometry on four notched-out spectral regions, covering 347 to 618 nm. We see clear evidence of temporal variations in extinction across these bands, which we attribute to variation in the aerosol content of the atmosphere above the observatory. The observed differences in extinction between the reddest and bluest band can exceed 5 mmag/airmass, highlighting the importance of including variable aerosols in the transmission of the atmosphere. We aspire to using precise determinations of the optical transmission of the atmosphere to enable a forward-modeling approach to achieving mmag photometric precision with Rubin data.

 - **Abstract**
 This article presents a publicly available, multimodal, tiered magnetic polarity inversion lines (MPILs) dataset extracted from the Solar Dynamics Observatory's (SDO) Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) Active Region Patches (SDO/HMI HARP) between May 2010 and April 2025. The dataset comprises four distinct tiers, each generated by running our detection methodology with four different magnetic field strength thresholds to capture nuanced variations in MPIL features at multiple levels of detail. In total, we provide 6,695 HARP series mapped using the Lambert Cylindrical Equal Area (CEA) projection at a 12-minute cadence. This tiered approach ensures that each tier captures specific sensitivities to polarity changes, enabling researchers to tailor their analyses to a range of scientific and operational objectives. In each threshold tier, we offer six binary MPIL masks associated with heliophysics and space weather forecasting, including MPIL, Region of Polarity Inversion (RoPI), positive and negative polarity regions, unsigned polarity regions, and MPIL convex hulls. Furthermore, structured metadata in the form of multivariate time series is included, allowing users to track and analyze MPIL properties over time.
#### The Role of Magnetic Reconnection in the Structure & Dynamics of Fast Coronal Mass Ejections

 - **Abstract**
 Both observations and models of flare-associated coronal mass ejections (CMEs) suggest that magnetic reconnection in an ejection's wake substantially increases the net, outward Lorentz force accelerating the CME. A stronger outward force can cause a feedback loop, driving further magnetic reconnection in a "reconnective instability." The flux accretion model captures this by relating reconnected flux (Delta Phi_rec) and magnetic field strength (B_CME) to increased outward Lorentz force (Delta F_r). To better understand reconnection's role in CME dynamics, we analyze two snapshots from a 2.5D, MHD simulation of a breakout eruption. Outward Lorentz forces increase substantially as reconnection proceeds, caused primarily by "flank currents," which flow just inside the boundary of the rising ejection's wake and parallel to its axis. This model's reconnection jet also alters the ejection's internal structure, an effect that could be sought in observations. Analyzing reconnection-induced Lorentz forces in 3D simulations could provide additional insights into CME dynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 The first detection of a gravitational-wave (GW) signal in 2015 has opened a new observational window to probe the universe. This probe can not only reveal previously inaccessible binaries, black holes, and other compact objects, but also can detect exoplanets through their imprint on GW signals, thereby significantly extend current exoplanet surveys. To date, nearly 6000 exoplanets have been confirmed, yet most of them reside either in the solar neighbourhood or along the sightline toward the Galactic bulge, reflecting the range limits of traditional electromagnetic techniques. In this work, we follow the method proposed in this http URL&this http URL(2019) to investigate frequency modulations in GW signals from early-stage binary neutron stars (BNSs) induced by circumbinary planets (CBPs) and obtain that CBPs can be detected by the future space-borne detector DECi-hertz Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory (DECIGO). For BNS system with the masses of two components both being 1.4 $M_{\odot}$, DECIGO could detect CBPs with mass being dozens of times that of Jupiter out to distances of $\sim 1$ Gpc, well beyond the Local Supercluster, offering an unprecedented opportunity to study planetary formation and evolution for the post main-sequence stage.

 - **Abstract**
 The C-MetaLL project has provided homogeneous spectroscopic abundances of 290 Classical Cepheids (DCEPs) for which we have the intensity-averaged magnitudes in multiple optical and near-infrared (NIR) bands, periods, pulsation modes, and Gaia parallaxes. Our goal is to derive updated period--Wesenheit--metallicity (PWZ) relations using the largest and most homogeneous metallicity sample ever used for such analyses, covering a range of $-1.3<$[Fe/H]$<+0.3$ dex. We computed several optical and NIR Wesenheit magnitudes using 275 DCEPs with reliable parallaxes, by applying a robust photometric parallax technique, which simultaneously fits all parameters -- including the global Gaia parallax counter-correction -- and handles outliers without data rejection. We find a stronger metallicity dependence ($\gamma \approx -0.5$ mag/dex in optical, $-0.4$ mag/dex in NIR) than recent literature reports. Gaia parallax zero-point conter-corrections ($\epsilon$) vary smoothly across bands, with an average value of $\sim$10 $\mu$as, aligning with previous determinations. Applying our PWZ relations to LMC Cepheids yields distances generally consistent within $1\sigma$ with geometric estimates. The choice of reddening law has a negligible impact, while using only fundamental-mode pulsators significantly increases the uncertainties. Including $\alpha$-element corrections increases $|\gamma|$ and reduces $\epsilon$. However, we find statistically consistent $\gamma$ values with the literature, particularly for the key Wesenheit magnitude in the HST bands, by restricting the sample to the brighter (i.e. closer) objects, or by including only pulsators with $-0.7<$[Fe/H]$<$0.2 dex. Our results hint at a large $\gamma$ or a non-linear dependence on metallicity of DCEP luminosities at the metal-poor end, which is difficult to quantify with the precision of parallaxes of the present dataset.

 - **Abstract**
 Next-generation air-shower detectors, such as the Global Cosmic Ray Observatory (GCOS) and the Probing Extreme PeVatron Sources (PEPS) experiment, are considering water-Cherenkov detectors as a base design. A key factor in improving the sensitivity to ultra-high-energy gamma rays and to the mass composition of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays is the ability to measure the muonic content of air showers. To address this, a layered water Cherenkov tank design has been previously proposed. The water volume of the tank is divided into two optically separated layers. The electromagnetic component of the shower is mostly absorbed in the top layer, while the bottom layer records the light produced by through-going muons. Two prototype tanks were deployed at the Pierre Auger Observatory site in 2014 and have been recording data for more than 10 years. We present the performance of the prototype tanks and compare it with simulations, focusing mostly on the calibration. We investigate different dimensions for the water volumes. For the GCOS Observatory, one important challenge is to cover extremely large surfaces of 40000 km$^2$ to 60000 km$^2$ and achieve 100% efficiency at 10 EeV. Based on the size of the footprint of air-showers, we compute the number and spacing of detectors needed to fulfill the GCOS requirements.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent progress has shown that the geomagnetic field exerts a more significant impact than expected on the behavior of charged secondary particles in inclined air showers. In this study, we for the first time combine it with atmospheric effects to construct a bi-effect model, aiming to investigate the lateral distribution of particles on the ground plane. Despite the complex physical interactions during the development of air showers, a simple formula can describe the overall deflection of $\mu^{\pm}$ and accurately fit the deflection in simulated air showers, thereby validating the hypotheses about these effects in this study. Furthermore, we have obtained the relationship between model parameters and primary particle information for different experimental sites. This new model is highly successful and is promising to provide new insights for improving detector layout design and air shower reconstruction.

 - **Abstract**
 Latitudinal variations in turbulent heat flux play a key role in the thermal and magnetic evolution of rapidly rotating planets and stars. Although global spherical-shell simulations have documented such variations, explicit latitude-dependent scaling relations for heat transport have remained elusive. Here we employ the rotating Rayleigh-Bénard convection (RRBC) framework with tilted rotation and gravity axes to model convection at different latitudes $\varphi$ in the geostrophic regime. We derive scaling relations for the latitude dependence of convective length scales $\ell(\varphi)$ and the Nusselt number $Nu(\varphi)$. At high latitudes, the scalings $Nu \sim \sin^{-4/3}\varphi$ (near onset) and $Nu \sim \sin^{-4}\varphi$ (above onset) emerge, while at low latitudes $Nu \sim \cos^{4}\varphi$. These predictions are validated against direct numerical simulations of convection in a spherical shell. The results provide a quantitative framework for regional thermal transport in planetary and stellar interiors and establish a unified interpretation of spherical convection that connects naturally with planar RRBC turbulence.

 - **Abstract**
 The interplay between radiative cooling of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) and feedback heating governs the evolution of the universe's most massive galaxies. This paper presents simulations of feedback processes in massive galaxies showing how kinetic, thermal, and magnetic active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback interacts with the CGM under different environmental conditions. We find that in massive galaxies with shallower central gravitational potential and higher CGM pressure (multiphase galaxy; MPG) pure kinetic AGN feedback is most efficient in preventing CGM cooling from becoming catastrophic while maintaining the CGM entropy within the observed range. For the same galaxy, partitioning AGN energy injection into kinetic ($75\%$) and thermal ($25\%$) energy results in an entropy bump within $r\lesssim15$ kpc while also having a larger amount of cold gas extending out to $r\sim80$ kpc. A magnetohydrodynamic MPG run with seed magnetic field in the CGM (1~$\mu$G) and partial magnetised AGN feedback ($1\%$ of total AGN power) also shows a higher entropy (within $r<15$ kpc) and cold gas mass, albeit the cold gas remains constrained within $r\lesssim30$ kpc. For a similarly massive galaxy with deeper potential well and low CGM pressure (single phase galaxy; SPG) our simulations show that for both hydro and MHD runs with partial thermal AGN energy, the feedback mechanism remains tightly self-regulating with centrally concentrated cooling (within $r<1$ kpc). Our simulations of a similar mass galaxy with a deeper potential well and higher CGM pressure (SPG-Cool) show that our AGN feedback mechanism cannot get rid of the high CGM density and pressure and its long term evolution is similar to the multiphase galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the results of a simultaneous X-ray and optical spectroscopy campaign on the Galactic black hole X-ray binary V4641 Sgr, carried out with XRISM and the Seimei telescope during a low-luminosity phase towards the end of its 2024 outburst. Despite a very low X-ray luminosity of $10^{34}$ erg s$^{-1}$, the continuum spectrum is well reproduced by a disk blackbody model with a high inner disk temperature ($1.8$ keV). XRISM/Resolve provides the highest-resolution X-ray spectrum ever obtained from the source, and several strong, narrow emission lines were detected, resolved and characterized at a high significance level. The continuum shape and narrow emission lines both indicate that the inner disk region is obscured by the surrounding high-density gas, and the intrinsic luminosity is several orders of magnitude higher. In the simultaneous optical observation from the Seimei telescope, the line features are largely dominated by the optical companion. Although we detect a clear emission component in H$\alpha$ that could originate from a cold outflow or the disk atmosphere, there are no signs of the strong outflow signatures historically detected in this source. In X-rays, the combination of significantly redshifted ($\sim 700$ km s$^{-1}$) and weakly blueshifted ($\sim-250$ km s$^{-1}$) components, all varying strongly on ks timescales, along with a marginally significant (99.2%) highly blueshifted ($\sim-1200$ km s$^{-1}$) component, indicates a complex, inhomogeneous outflow geometry. This is corroborated by the erratic long-term evolution of the source seen in the complementary X-ray monitoring, and radio detections spanning 3 orders of magnitude.

 - **Abstract**
 The orientation of a polarization vector on the Poincare sphere is defined by its position and ellipticity angles. The radio emission from pulsars, magnetars, and fast radio bursts can be elliptically polarized, and measurements of the ellipticity angle (EA) have become increasingly important in interpretations and models of their polarization. An in-depth understanding of the statistical properties of the measured polarization angles is a prerequisite to their detailed interpretation. While the statistics of the position angle (PA) have been understood for some time, the statistics of the EA do not appear to be as well developed as those of the PA. The statistical properties of the EA are derived when the amplitude of the polarization vector is constant, to include its probability density, mean, standard deviation, and confidence limits. Similarly to the PA, the standard deviation and confidence limits of the EA vary inversely with the polarization signal-to-noise ratio. However, unlike the PA, the probability density of the EA is generally asymmetric, its standard deviation and confidence limits are dependent upon the intrinsic value of the EA, and the measured EA is biased by the instrumental noise, particularly at low signal-to-noise ratios and large values of the intrinsic EA. General expressions for the joint probability density of the polarization angles and the probability density of the EA are also derived when the amplitude of the polarization vector fluctuates due to the superposition of incoherent modes of orthogonal polarization.

 - **Abstract**
 Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are major drivers of space weather disturbances, and their deflection from the radial direction critically affects their potential impact on Earth. While the influence of the surrounding magnetic field in guiding CME trajectories is well established, accurately predicting non-radial propagation remains a challenge. In this work, we introduce and compare recently developed techniques for analyzing the early deflection of eruptive events. We revisit a largely deflected prominence-CME event of 2010 December 16 using an improved tracking framework and a new application of the topological path method. Our results suggest the deflection of the eruption is dominated by the channeling of the magnetic field lines. This study offers new physical insight into CME guidance mechanisms and validates the predictive capability of the topological path, highlighting its potential as a diagnostic tool for estimating the propagation direction of strongly deflected events.

 All stars rotate. While magnetic braking slows massive stars, the effect a stellar companion has on stellar rotation is still being explored. To prepare for future observations from rotating core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), we analyze a set of 30 2D neutrino radiation-hydrodynamic CCSN simulations for a variety of compactness values, rotation rates, and equations of state. We systematically explore how rotation lowers expected neutrino counts and energies for a realistic detector, while accounting for adiabatic Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein matter effects. We quantify the effect of viewing angle for neutrino emission for multiple rotation rates. Using 'multimessenger synthesis', we develop a technique that correlates multimessengers to constrain the neutrino mass ordering for a future supernova event. Likewise, we develop a method to constrain the distance to a rotating or nonrotating CCSN, regardless of explosion outcome.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast blue optical transients (FBOTs) are luminous, rapidly evolving events with blue spectra, possibly powered by newborn magnetars and linked to fast radio bursts (FRBs). Given this potential connection, we conducted deep radio observations of two nearby FBOTs (AT2018cow and CSS161010) using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), but detected no FRB-like signals. Our observations establish the most stringent upper limits on millisecond radio transients from FBOTs, reaching $\sim$10 mJy flux density. Assuming a log-normal luminosity function analogous to the repeating FRB 121102, we constrain the burst rate from potential magnetars in FBOTs to $<0.01$ hr$^{-1}$. The short ejecta escape timescale ($\sim$2.6 yr) compared to our observation epochs (4$-$6 years post-explosion) suggests that nondetection may not be attributed to FBOT's ejecta absorption. These findings impose useful constraints on the FRB activity emanating from newborn magnetars within FBOTs. They indicate that if there is a burst phase, it is either characterized by weaker bursts, occurs less frequently compared to those in known repeating FRB sources, or takes place beyond the time frame of our current observations. To gain deeper insights into the birth-related activity of magnetars, it is of importance to conduct timely and sustained FRB searches in FBOTs that emerge in the future.
#### RRAT J2325-0530: A Rotating Radio Transient with an Atypical Waiting-time Distribution

 - **Abstract**
 We present 1.25 GHz observations of the rotating radio transient (RRAT) J2325-0530, conducted with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). Approximately 60% of detected single pulses occur in clusters of 2 to 5 consecutive bursts. Consequently, the waiting-time distribution between successive single pulses exhibits a pronounced excess at one rotation period, deviating from the exponential distribution expected for a Poisson process. After grouping consecutive bursts into single emission events, the recalculated waiting-time distribution is well described by a Weibull distribution with a shape parameter $k \gtrsim 1$. Monte Carlo simulations incorporating both intrinsic burst on-windows and rotational modulation successfully reproduce the observed one-rotation excess. These results suggest that RRAT J2325-0530 emits through a quasi-random process with on-windows slightly longer than its spin period, modulated by the the rotation of emission beam. Additionally, the polarization position angle shows complex behavior that cannot be fully described by the standard rotating vector model, and several pulses exhibit quasi-periodic micro-structures. Taken together, these features indicate complex magnetospheric dynamics underlying the sporadic emission behavior of RRAT J2325-0530.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a Chandra/ACIS-I study of X-ray sources in BOSS 1441, a protocluster at $z=2.32\pm0.02$ that exhibits a prominent overdensity of Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs). Using a 45 ks observation, we identify seven X-ray sources spatially coincident with LAE density peaks. The average X-ray photon index for the seven sources, derived from an absorbed power-law model with Galactic absorption fixed, is 1.49 (ranging from -0.68 to 2.51), corresponding to an average luminosity of $\rm 6.85\times 10^{44}~erg~s^{-1}$ in the rest-frame 2-33 keV band, with individual luminosities spanning $(3.57 - 13.96)\rm\times 10^{44}~erg~s^{-1}$. Three sources exhibit relatively flat spectral slopes. Two are associated with the MAMMOTH-1 nebula, while the third, located at the edge of BOSS 1441 with a $> 5'$ offset from the LAE density peak, resides in a region with a high submillimeter-band density. We estimate the fraction of X-ray detected AGNs among the LAEs to be $11.5^{+3.8}_{-4.6}\%$, approximately double that of previously studied LAEs. This elevated fraction suggests BOSS 1441 is in a mature evolutionary stage, with even higher AGN fractions expected in massive LAEs such as PKS 1138-262. In contrast, the submillimeter galaxy population shows a lower AGN fraction ($6.9^{+6.9}_{-4.5}\%$), consistent with their typically obscured nature. These results indicate that the protocluster's massive galaxies are evolving into the bright red sequence galaxies observed in local clusters, where AGNs likely play a critical role in quenching their star formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar radio emissions offer unique diagnostic insights into the solar corona. However, their dynamic and multiscale nature, along with several orders of magnitude variations in intensity, pose significant observational challenges. To date, at gigahertz frequencies, MeerKAT stands out globally with high potential of producing high-fidelity, spectroscopic snapshot images of the Sun, enabled by its dense core, high sensitivity, and broad frequency coverage. Yet, as a telescope originally designed for observing faint galactic and extragalactic sources, observing the Sun at the boresight of the telescope requires customized observing strategies and calibration methods. This work demonstrates the technical readiness of MeerKAT for solar observations at the boresight of the telescope in the UHF (580-1015 MHz) and L-band (900-1670 MHz) frequency ranges, including optimized modes, a dedicated calibration scheme, and a tailored, entirely automated calibration and imaging pipeline. The quality of solar images is validated through morphological comparisons with the solar images at other wavelengths. Several unique early science results showcase the potential of this new capability of MeerKAT. Once fully commissioned and operational, this will unlock novel solar studies, significantly expand the scientific portfolio of MeerKAT, and lay the groundwork for solar observations with the mid-frequency telescope of the upcoming Square Kilometre Array Observatory, for which MeerKAT serves as a precursor.

 - **Abstract**
 We present radial velocity measurements of the star HD 28471, observed by HARPS at the ESO 3.6 m telescope over a baseline of $\sim19$ years. We have searched for planetary companions to HD 28471 using kima, a trans-dimensional diffusive nested sampling algorithm where the number of planetary signals is explored as a free parameter. We detect a compact system of three planets, with signals in the preferred solution corresponding to orbits of $P\sim3.16,~6.12,~\textrm{and }11.68$ d. These planets lie firmly in the super-Earth and sub-Neptune mass regime, with (minimum) masses of $3.7, 5.7, \textrm{and }4.9$ M$_{\oplus}$, respectively. A long-period ($\sim1500$ d) signal is also strongly detected. Assessment of activity indicator periodicities and RV correlations suggests that the three short-period signals are genuine planets, but casts doubt upon the nature of the long-period signal. The origin may be a short stellar magnetic cycle, though additional data are required to fully sample the periodicity without intervening offsets. HD 28471 b exhibits a more eccentric orbit than the other planets, which may be due to dynamical interaction, or a result of RV variation from an as-yet-undetected 4th planet interior to this compact system. The detected planets lie close to a resonant configuration, indicating that the system may retain features of its natal configuration, with convergent migration potentially responsible for evolving the planets onto such short-period orbits.

 - **Abstract**
 Many transients believed to originate from magnetars are thought to be triggered by crustal activity, which feeds back on the surrounding magnetosphere. These perturbations, through a variety of proposed mechanisms, can convert a fraction of the magnetic energy stored in the magnetosphere, as well as the energy injected by crustal activity itself into electromagnetic emission, including X-ray bursts and fast radio bursts. Here we provide a first glimpse of this process by coupling magneto-elastic dynamics simulations of the crust to fully three-dimensional relativistic resistive force-free electrodynamic simulations of the magnetosphere. Our simulations demonstrate that the elastodynamical motions of the surface launch a series of fast magnetosonic and Alfvén waves into the magnetosphere. These waves rapidly enter a nonlinear regime, ultimately giving rise to a wide range of phenomena, including monster shock formation, relativistic blast waves, trapped Alfvén waves, nonlinear Alfvén wave ejecta, and transient equatorial current sheets interacting with these waves. After the initial nonlinear phase, the magnetosphere is partially combed out, resembling a strongly perturbed split monopole configuration. Our results can offer hints and potential constraints on fast radio burst emission mechanisms, in particular for hyperactive repeating sources, by placing tight bounds on energy conversion efficiency, and possible quasi-periodic imprints on magnetospheric waves by elastic oscillations of the crust.

 - **Abstract**
 Radio astronomy observations at frequencies below 10~MHz could provide valuable science, such as measuring the cosmic dark age signal in the redshifted 21~cm hydrogen absorption line, detecting exoplanetary auroral emissions which lead to inferences about magnetic fields and atmospheres, and characterizing the effects of solar wind and coronal mass ejections on the magnetospheres of solar system planets. Despite their value, few resolved measurements in the sub-10~MHz band have been made. At frequencies below 10~MHz, the Earth's ionosphere reflects, attenuates, and distorts radio waves, making radio astronomy in this band possible only from space. However, a space-borne array would need thousands of electrically-small antennas to reach the sensitivity required for detecting faint astronomical signals, and it would need to be positioned far from the Earth to reduce the impact of Earth-based radio interference. Using more efficient antennas would minimize the number needed, and using antennas that are more resilient to interference would reduce the required distance from Earth. To this end, we consider constructing a low frequency array out of vector sensor antennas. These advanced antennas consist of three orthogonal dipole and three orthogonal loop antennas with a common phase centre. Their benefits include direction-finding and polarimetric capabilities, but they have not been considered for this application previously. We show that vector sensors can provide four times more Fisher information during interferometry than tripoles, simpler antennas that are commonly considered for space applications. We also present an all-sky imaging simulation to demonstrate a spherical harmonic imaging technique.
#### A$^3$COSMOS: The dust content of massive quiescent galaxies and its evolution with cosmic time

 - **Abstract**
 We study the dust content of massive ($\log(M_*/M_{\odot})\geq10.8$) quiescent galaxies (QGs) at redshift $z=0.5-3$ to place constraints on the evolution of their cold interstellar medium (ISM), and thereby obtain insights on the processes of galaxy quenching throughout cosmic time. We use a robust sample of 458 colour-selected QGs covered by the A$^3$COSMOS+A$^3$GOODSS database to perform a stacking analysis in the $uv$-domain and measure their mean dust masses from their stacked submillimetre luminosities. We use the CIGALE SED-fitting code to obtain star formation histories and infer the time since quenching for all QGs in our sample. We use this information to gain insight on the time evolution of the dust content after quenching. Most QGs in our sample quenched around a redshift of $z\sim1.3$, following the peak of cosmic star formation. The majority of QGs observed at $z>1$ are recently quenched (i.e., quenched for no longer than $500\,$Myr), whereas the majority of QGs observed at $z<1$ have already been quenched for a significant amount of time ($\gtrsim1\,$Gyr). This implies that high-redshift galaxies ($z\gtrsim2$) are ideal for studying the mechanisms of quenching and its effects on the ISM, while lower-redshift galaxies are more suitable for studying the long-term effects of the QG environment on their ISM. We obtain upper limits on the dust mass fraction of the QG population, pointing towards lower dust content in high-redshift massive QGs than found by earlier stacking studies, and significantly lower (by a factor $\sim2-6$) than that of normal star forming galaxies. We also place constraints on the initial gas fraction right after quenching. We find that within the first $\sim600\,$Myr after quenching, QGs already lose on average $\gtrsim70\%$ of their cold ISM. Our findings support a gas consumption or removal scenario acting on short timescales.

 - **Abstract**
 We performed a detailed analysis of the magnetic structure and asymmetric eruption of a large (about 500 Mm) inverse S-shaped filament partially located in AR 13229 on February 24, 2023. We linked the filament's pre-eruptive magnetic configuration to its highly asymmetric eruption dynamics and the formation of a large-scale coronal dimming in a weak-field region (mean unsigned flux of about 5 G). To reconstruct the coronal magnetic field, we applied a physics-informed neural network (PINN)-based nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF) extrapolation method to a pre-eruption HMI vector magnetogram. The NLFFF extrapolation reveals a large-scale magnetic flux rope (MFR) of about 500 Mm in length, consistent with the filament. We identified an extended MFR footprint to the east that connects to the J-shaped flare ribbon, outlining where the coronal dimming began. Overlying strapping fields connect to the area into which the dimming and flare ribbon later expand. This configuration explains the formation of the dimming as a stationary flux rope and strapping flux dimming, with subsequent expansion driven by the growth of the MFR footprint through strapping-strapping reconnection. Conversely, the western filament leg shows multiple anchor points and strong overlying magnetic fields, which suppressed the dimming and partially confined the eruption on that side. The reconstructed pre-eruptive NLFFF configuration offers a clear physical explanation for the asymmetries seen in the eruption, flare geometry, and coronal dimming. This demonstrates that PINN-based NLFFF extrapolation can effectively model large-scale filaments extending into weak-field regions, enhancing our understanding of complex solar eruptions.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a method for the detection and characterization of random changes in the flux from $\gamma$-ray pulsars on sub-hour timescales, much shorter than variations that can be accessed using direct flux measurements. Flux variations are a proxy for the variations in spindown power ($\dot{E}$) or particle acceleration, which can be produced by random switches between quasi-stable configurations of the pulsar magnetosphere. This technique therefore probes the stability of pulsar magnetospheres and discrete spindown states on timescales much shorter than can be achieved with pulsar timing. We apply the method to a sample of 115 bright $\gamma$-ray pulsars, finding no new instances of state changes. We derive the sensitivity of the method and find that, for a wide range of possible state changing models, over a wide range of timescales, we can limit the amplitude of flux ($\dot{E}$) variations to $<$10%. Substantial nulling is excluded in nearly all cases. The best cases limit variations of any sort to $\leq$1%. These results indicate that $\gamma$-ray pulsar magnetospheres maintain a single configuration or narrow range of configurations with nearly constant power output.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel spectral solver for general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics on dynamical spacetimes. By combining a high order discontinuous spectral method on mapped Chebyshev Fourier grids, our scheme attains exponential convergence. Implemented within a unified BSSN Valencia framework, the code evolves both Einstein and MHD fields self consistently, enabling fully coupled simulations of black hole accretion jet systems. We demonstrate spectral accuracy and entropy stability through convergence tests, and validate physical fidelity via equatorial embedding diagrams of horizon crossing GRMHD variables in Kerr Schild coordinates. Three dimensional scatter visualizations further highlight the solver's capability to capture complex magnetized plasma structures around rotating black holes. This approach paves the way for high order, low dissipation GRMHD simulations on exascale architectures, opening new avenues for precise modeling of strong field astrophysical phenomena.
