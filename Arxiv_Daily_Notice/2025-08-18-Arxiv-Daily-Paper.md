 - **Abstract**
 Precise radial velocity (pRV) measurements of M-dwarfs in the near-infrared (NIR) rely on empirical templates due to the lack of accurate stellar spectral models in this regime. Templates are assumed to approximate the true spectrum when constructed from many observations or in the high signal-to-noise limit. We develop a numerical simulation that generates SPIRou-like pRV observations from PHOENIX spectra, constructs empirical templates, and estimates radial velocities. This simulation solely considers photon noise and evaluates when empirical templates remain reliable for pRV analysis. Our results reveal a previously unrecognized noise source in templates, establishing a fundamental floor for template-based pRV measurements. We find that templates inherently include distortions in stellar line shapes due to imperfect interpolation at the detector's sampling resolution. The magnitude of this interpolation error depends on sampling resolution and RV content. Consequently, while stars with a higher RV content, such as cooler M-dwarfs are expected to yield lower RV uncertainties, their dense spectral features can amplify interpolation errors, potentially biasing RV estimates. For a typical M4V star, SPIRou's spectral and sampling resolution imposes an RV uncertainty floor of 0.5-0.8 m/s, independent of the star's magnitude or the telescope's aperture. These findings reveal a limitation of template-based pRV methods, underscoring the need for improved spectral modeling and better-than-Nyquist detector sampling to reach the next level of RV precision.

 - **Abstract**
 The outer region of the interstellar medium (ISM) is witness to dynamically important events in a galaxy's evolutionary history such as outflows, inflows, tidal interactions, and mergers, as well as dynamical structures affecting its current evolution such as bars and spiral arms. Studying imprints of these processes in the diffuse, extended molecular gas is best achieved by a single dish telescope which can cover a large field of view with good sensitivity to large-scale structures. In this work we present results from APEX line emission maps of two nearby galaxies: the Circinus galaxy in the CO(3-2) transition, and NGC 1097 in CO(2-1), covering their full optical extents. We detect gas at the largest extents seen for these galaxies yet, at 5$^{\prime}$ ($r \approx 6$ kpc) for the Circinus galaxy, and $4^{\prime}.5$ ($r \approx 18$ kpc) for NGC 1097, and compute total CO luminosities of $L^{\prime}_{\mathrm{CO(3-2)}} = (1.5\pm0.4)\times10^{8}$ K km s$^{-1}$ pc$^{2}$ and $L^{\prime}_{\mathrm{CO(2-1)}} = (7.0\pm1.7)\times10^{8}$ K km s$^{-1}$ pc$^{2}$, corresponding to molecular gas masses of $(2.1\pm1.0)\times10^{9}$ M$_{\odot}$ and $(4.7\pm1.9)\times10^{9}$ M$_{\odot}$, respectively. We further analyze the large-scale gas kinematics via PV diagrams and tilted ring modeling using $^{\mathrm{3D}}$BAROLO. We detect notable features in both galaxies beyond the well-studied central regions: in the Circinus galaxy we detect molecular gas embedded in a bar-like structure, whose kinematic signature is also evident in the major axis PV diagram, and in NGC 1097, we observe tidal molecular gas involved in the interaction of NGC 1097 with the companion galaxy NGC 1097A. The clear detection of such molecular gas structures shows promise in conducting large-scale molecular gas studies toward nearby galaxies with APEX and, in the future, the Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST).

 - **Abstract**
 Two long-duration gamma-ray bursts were recently discovered with kilonovae, the signature of r-process element production in a compact binary merger, rather than supernovae. This has forced a re-evaluation of the long-established dichotomy between short bursts (< 2s, arising from compact binary mergers) and long bursts (> 2s, a class of massive star core-collapse event). We aim to determine whether white dwarf-neutron star (WDNS) and white dwarf-black hole (WDBH) mergers are plausible explanations for long-duration compact merger GRBs, in terms of their galactocentric merger offsets and cosmological rates. We model the host galaxies of GRBs 211211A and 230307A, and employ binary population synthesis, to predict the offset distributions of compact mergers. We compare with the observed offsets, investigate evolutionary pathways, predict their cosmological rates, and compare with volumetric GRB rates. We find that WDNS mergers occur at lower host offsets than binary NS mergers, but that in the specific cases of GRBs 211211A and 230307A, the observed offsets are consistent with either scenario. We predict that WDNS mergers occur at a similar rate to binary NS mergers and long GRBs, and that WDBH mergers are a factor of ten rarer, with the caveat that these rates currently carry uncertainties at the order of magnitude level. We have demonstrated, solely in terms of galactocentric offsets and event rates, that WDNS mergers are a plausible explanation for GRBs 211211A and 230307A, and long GRBs from compact object mergers more generally. WDNS binaries have lower systemic velocities than binary neutron stars, but longer delay times, and ultimately merge with an offset distribution that is not measurably different without large samples. Therefore, offsets and rates alone cannot currently distinguish between compact binary progenitor models for supernova-less long duration GRBs.
#### Supernova Rates and Luminosity Functions from ASAS-SN II: 2014-2017 core-collapse supernovae and their subtypes

 - **Abstract**
 The volumetric rates and luminosity functions (LFs) of core-collapse supernovae (ccSN) and their subtypes are important for understanding the cosmic history of star formation and the buildup of ccSN products. To estimate these rates, we use data of nearby ccSNe discovered by the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN) from 2014--2017, when all observations were made in the $V$-band. The sample is composed of 174 discovered or recovered events, with high spectroscopic completeness from followup observations. This allows us to obtain a statistically precise and systematically robust estimate of nearby rates for ccSNe and their subtypes. The volumetric rates are estimated by correcting the observed number of events for the survey completeness, which was estimated through injection recovery simulations using ccSN light curves. We find a total volumetric rate for ccSNe of $7.0^{+1.0}_{-0.9} \times 10^{-5} \ \textrm{yr}^{-1} \ \textrm{Mpc}^{-3} \ h^{3}_{70}$, at a median redshift of 0.0149, for absolute magnitudes at peak $M_{V,peak} \leq -14$ mag. This result is in agreement with previous local volumetric rates. We obtain volumetric rates for the different ccSN subtypes (II, IIn, IIb, Ib, Ic, Ibn, and Ic-BL), and find that the relative fractions of Type II, stripped-envelope, and interacting ccSNe are $63.2\%$, $32.3\%$, and $4.4\%$, respectively. We also estimate a volumetric rate for superluminous SNe of $1.5^{+4.4}_{-1.1} \ \textrm{yr}^{-1} \ \textrm{Gpc}^{-3} \ h^{3}_{70}$, corresponding to a fraction of $0.002\%$ of the total ccSN rate. We produce intrinsic $V$-band LFs of ccSNe and their subtypes, and show that ccSN rates steadily decline for increasing luminosities. We further investigate the specific ccSN rate as a function of their host galaxy stellar mass, and find that the rate decreases with increasing stellar mass, with significantly higher rates at lower mass galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 Using cosmological radiation-hydrodynamical simulations, we study the effect of accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) on nearby dark-matter (DM) haloes in the very early universe. We find that an SMBH with a spectral energy distribution (SED) extending from the near-ultraviolet to hard X-rays, can produce a radiation background sufficient to delay gravitational collapse in surrounding DM haloes until up to $10^7$ M$_\odot$ of zero-metallicity gas is available for the formation of Population III (Pop III) stars or direct-collapse black holes (DCBHs). We model three scenarios, corresponding to an SMBH located at physical distances of 10, 100, and 1000 kpc from the Pop III host DM halo. Using these three scenarios, we use the SED to compute self-consistent photoionization, photoheating, and photodissociation rates. We include the effects of Compton scattering and gas self-shielding. The X-ray portion of the spectrum maintains an elevated free-electron fraction as the gas collapses to high density. This stimulates H2 formation, allowing the gas to cool further while counteracting the dissociation of H2 by Lyman-Werner radiation. As a result, a large cluster of Pop III stars is expected to form, except in the case with the most intense radiation in which a DCBH may instead form. Our simulated Pop III clusters have comparable HeII 1640 luminosities to the recently discovered Pop III host candidate near GN-z11, observed by the James Webb Space Telescope. In two of the scenarios we consider, the resulting clusters could be detectable using the telescope's NIRSpec instrument out to z ~ 15.

 - **Abstract**
 Flux emergence is ubiquitous in the Sun's lower atmosphere, where the emerging magnetic flux can reconnect with the pre-existing magnetic field. We investigate plasmoid formation and the resulting multi-thermal emissions during three-dimensional magnetic reconnection in the lower solar atmosphere. We performed 3D radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations using the MURaM code, which incorporates solar convection and radiative transfer. A flat magnetic flux sheet was introduced into the convection zone to trigger flux emergence. For comparison with previous observations, we used the RH1.5D code to synthesize H{\alpha} and Si IV spectral line profiles, and generated ultraviolet images using the optically thin approximation. The simulations show that flux emergence occurs as the imposed flux tube crosses the photosphere. In the lower solar atmosphere, magnetic reconnection forms thin, elongated current sheets, and plasmoid-like structures develop, producing numerous small twisted magnetic flux ropes that are expelled toward both ends of the reconnection region. This process results in the coexistence of hot plasma exceeding 20,000 K and cooler plasma below 10,000 K. Synthetic images and spectral line profiles through the reconnection region exhibit features characteristic of Ellerman bombs (EBs) and UV bursts. Cooler plasma associated with EBs can be found above hot plasma at altitudes exceeding 2 Mm above the solar surface, while hot plasma associated with UV bursts can extend downward into the lower chromosphere, reaching approximately 0.7 Mm above the surface. These results indicate that turbulent reconnection mediated by plasmoid instability can occur in small-scale events such as EBs and UV bursts, and that the coexistence of hot and cool plasma in such reconnection processes can account for UV bursts that are temporally and spatially connected to EBs.

 - **Abstract**
 We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRCam imaging of the nearby Seyfert 1.9 galaxy NGC 4258, which hosts strong star formation regions as well as an anomalous jet-like radio structure that extends through a significant portion of its disk. This galaxy provides a unique environment to study Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN)-driven shocks and their impact on the interstellar medium (ISM) as its proximity allows for narrow-band observations of various near-infrared tracers sensitive to multiple levels of shock and radiative excitation: [Fe II] (1.64 $\mu$m), Pa$\alpha$ (1.87 $\mu$m), H$_2$ (2.21 $\mu$m), 3.3 $\mu$m polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission, Br$\alpha$ (4.05 $\mu$m), and Pf$\beta$ (4.66 $\mu$m), allowing us to trace shocks with parsec-scale resolution. Comparing these near-infrared observations with available ultraviolet, optical, radio, and X-ray imaging, we find that shocks present in the brightest regions of the anomalous radio structure are likely of low-velocity (50-100 km s$^{-1}$), suggesting that these features originate from AGN-driven winds that interact with the host medium and mechanically impart energy into the disk. Further, while co-spatial [Fe II] and H$_2$ emission indicate multi-phase shocks, PAH emission is relatively weaker or absent in the most shock-excited regions, consistent with the destruction of small dust grains. Finally, we propose that surveys identifying enhanced [Fe II] in AGN host galaxies may systematically reveal a key population where AGN feedback is significantly coupled with the surrounding ISM and actively shaping galaxy evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigated binary lens events from the 2022-2024 microlensing surveys, aiming to identify events suitable for lens mass measurements. We focused on two key light curve features: distinct caustic spikes with resolved crossings for measuring the angular Einstein radius ($\theta_{\rm E}$), and long durations enabling microlens-parallax ($\pi_{\rm E}$) measurements. Four events met these criteria: KMT-2022-BLG-1479, KMT-2023-BLG-0932, OGLE-2024-BLG-0142, and KMT-2024-BLG-1309. We estimated the angular Einstein radius by combining the normalized source radius measured from modeling the resolved caustic spikes with the angular source radius derived from the source color and magnitude. Additionally, we determined the microlens parallax through light curve modeling, considering higher-order effects caused by the orbital motions of Earth and the binary lens. With measurements of the event timescale, angular Einstein radius, and microlens parallax, we uniquely determined the mass and distance of the lens. For the events KMT-2022-BLG-1479, KMT-2023-BLG-0932, and KMT-2024-BLG-1309, both components of the binary lens have masses lower than that of the Sun, consistent with M-type dwarfs, which are the most common type of lenses in Galactic microlensing events. These lenses are relatively nearby, with distances $\lesssim 2.5$ kpc, indicating their location within the Galactic disk. In contrast, for OGLE-2024-BLG-0142, the primary lens component has a mass similar to that of the Sun, while the companion lens component has about half the mass of the primary. This lens system is situated at a greater distance, roughly 4.5 kpc.

 - **Abstract**
 It is known that massive red supergiants (RSGs) become hydrodynamically unstable and experience radial pulsations before they explode. Still, the vast majority of supernova (SN) models assume RSG progenitors in hydrostatic equilibrium. Here, we self-consistently follow the hydrodynamic evolution of RSGs with different masses and the development of radial envelope pulsations. Pulsations significantly alter the observable pre- and post-SN properties, and their importance increases substantially as a function of initial mass. We demonstrate that it is not advisable to infer core masses, let alone initial masses, from a single pre-SN luminosity and effective temperature of high-mass RSGs, as these quantities can vary by an order of magnitude during the pulsation. For all masses considered, we find that pulsations can naturally lead to "early-excess" emission in SN light-curves and to variations in the early photospheric velocity evolution compared to hydrostatic models that can help break the degeneracies in type-II SNe. We compare to SN 2023ixf, for which a pulsating RSG progenitor was discovered. We demonstrate that its pre- and post-SN characteristics agree very well with our exploding pulsating RSG model, while hydrostatic stellar models are not well-suited. The data coverage at early times is insufficient to break all the degeneracies in the progenitor and SN parameters, but we find some constraints on the explosion phase. We show that there is no evidence for the claimed pulsation period of the SN 2024ggi progenitor, as it is consistent with the orbital period of Spitzer. This study emphasizes the importance of hydrodynamical pre-SN stellar models for studying SNe and implies an important shift in our understanding of the last stages of massive star evolution, the interpretation of pre-SN properties, the connection between SNe and their progenitors, and the missing RSG problem.

 - **Abstract**
 Ground and space-based observations have revealed that Ultra Hot Jupiters (UHJs,~$T_{\rm{eq}} > 2200 \ \rm{K}$) typically have inverted thermal profiles, while cooler hot Jupiters have non-inverted ones. This shift is theorized due to the onset of strong optical absorbers like metal oxides (e.g., TiO, VO), metal hydrides (e.g. FeH), atomic species (e.g., Fe, Ti), and ions (e.g., H$^-$). High-resolution spectroscopy is valuable for characterizing the thermal, chemical, and dynamical atmospheric structures due to its sensitivity to detailed spectral line shapes. The newly commissioned WINERED high-resolution spectrograph ($R\sim68,000$) on the Magellan Clay 6.5 m telescope enhances capabilities with its high throughput in the J-band (1.13-1.35 $\mu$m), capturing strong spectral features from key atmospheric species. In this study, we report detecting the dayside atmosphere of the UHJ WASP-189 b at a $S/N\sim10$, marking the first exoplanet atmosphere detection in emission with WINERED. Individually, we identify strong neutral iron (Fe) emission lines at a $S/N=6.3$, and tentatively detect neutral magnesium (Mg) and silicon (Si) at a $S/N>4$. Although not individually detected, we detect a combined set of trace species at a $S/N=7.2$, which is attributed mostly to neutral chromium (Cr) and aluminum (Al), alongside magnesium and silicon. These results help refine the understanding of key atmospheric species that influence the thermal structure of WASP-189 b and UHJs more broadly.
#### SQ-A: A Collision Triggered Starburst in Intra-Group Medium of Stephan's Quintet

 - **Abstract**
 We present new observational evidence supporting the hypothesis that SQ-A, a starburst in the intra-group medium (IGrM) of Stephan's Quintet (SQ), is triggered by a high-speed collision between two gas systems, one associated with the IGrM (v~6900 km/s) and another with the intruder galaxy NGC7318b (v~6000 km/s). The new ALMA CO(2-1) dataset has angular resolutions between 0.2" and 7.0" and the new VLA HI datacube an angular resolution of 6.6" * 7.9". The CO maps show that the two gas systems are bridged by another system with an intermediate velocity of ~6600 km/s, whereas the HI data show that the component of v~6600 km/s fits well into a gap in the more extended v~6000 km/s component, albeit with a displacement of ~5 kpc. Both the bridge and the complementary distributions between different gas systems are common features of starbursts triggered by cloud-cloud collision. An analysis of clumps (sizes of 100--200 pc) reveals very diversified star formation (SF) activity in clumps belonging to different kinematic systems, with the molecular gas depletion time of the v~6900 km/s clumps more than 10 times longer than that of the v~6600 km/s clumps. The results are consistent with a scenario in which the enhanced SF activity (and the starburst) in the system of v~6600 km/s is due to gas compression generated in cloud-cloud collisions, whereas the suppression of SF in the v~6900 km/s system is due to vortices (i.e. gas rotation) generated in more complex collisions involving dense clouds and diffuse intercloud gas accompanied by blast-wave shocks.

 - **Abstract**
 The study presents a detailed spectroscopic analysis of the planetary nebulae (PNe) NGC~2392 and NGC~4361 using optical spectra obtained from the 2-m Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT) and mid-infrared spectra from archival \textit{Spitzer} IRS data. The physical conditions, such as electron temperature ($T_e$) and density ($n_e$), were derived using diagnostic emission lines through the PyNeb software. Elemental abundances of key species, including He, O, N, Ne, S, Cl, and Ar, were determined for both nebulae, offering insights into their nucleosynthesis history and evolutionary status. High-resolution HST and Pan-STARRS imaging further elucidate the morphological structures of the nebulae. NGC~2392 exhibits a well-defined double-shell structure and moderate excitation characteristics, while NGC~4361 displays a diffuse elliptical morphology with high-excitation conditions and a notably low nitrogen content. The observed line spectra and derived abundances point toward distinct progenitor histories for the two PNe, with NGC~2392 originating from a younger, intermediate-mass progenitor, while NGC~4361 traces an older, metal-poor Population II star. This comparative study enhances our understanding of the evolution and chemical enrichment processes of low- to intermediate-mass stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Aims: To investigate the physical processing of PAHs in high-mass star-forming environments. This study aims to characterize how the PAH ionization fraction varies across different H II regions and to search for spectroscopic evidence of the processing or destruction of PAH molecules in intense radiation fields. Methodology: We utilized mid-infrared integral field spectroscopic data from the JWST's Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) in its Medium Resolution Spectroscopy (MRS) mode. One-dimensional spectra were extracted for each of the four H II regions. We measured the integrated fluxes of the prominent PAH emission features at 7.7, 8.6, and 11.3 micron and calculated key diagnostic flux ratios to probe the physical state of the PAH population. Results: The four H II regions in NGC 5457 exhibit significant diversity in their PAH spectral characteristics. The diagnostic F(8.6)/F(11.3) ratio, a tracer of PAH ionization, varies from 0.23 to 0.62 across the sample. The region with the highest ionization (highest F(8.6)/F(11.3)) shows the lowest F(7.7)/F(8.6) ratio (1.13), while the region with the lowest ionization has the highest F(7.7)/F(8.6) ratio (2.38). Conclusion: The observed spectral diversity is primarily driven by variations in the PAH ionization state, which is governed by the local radiation field intensity. The strong anti-correlation between the F(7.7)/F(8.6) and F(8.6)/F(11.3) ratios provides a new, powerful diagnostic for PAH processing. This trend is interpreted as an evolutionary sequence where increasingly harsh radiation fields not only ionize the PAH population but also alter the surviving cations, consistent with the selective destruction of the carriers of the 7.7 micron feature.

 - **Abstract**
 Resonant inverse Compton scattering (RICS) of soft thermal photons by relativistic particles on closed magnetic field loops has been proposed to explain the hard emission observed up to, and beyond, 200 keV from magnetars. If particles injected at the base of the loops have Lorentz factors >= 10^2, the RICS spectra will be attenuated by both one-photon pair production and photon splitting in the ultra-strong magnetar fields, producing additional spectral components from pair synchrotron radiation and split photons that produce further generations of pairs and split photons. We investigate such cascades initiated by the primary injected electrons through a Monte Carlo simulation and study the cascade spectra and pair distributions. For most observer angles, the pair synchrotron and split photon spectra dominate the RICS primary spectra and produce complex polarization signals. In particular, the synchrotron spectra are highly polarized with degree 40% - 80%, are softer than the RICS spectra and may account for the high polarization of some magnetar spectra observed by IXPE above 3 keV.

 - **Abstract**
 We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN\,2021aaev, a hydrogen-rich, superluminous supernova with persistent (at least $\sim100$ days) narrow Balmer lines (SLSN-IIn) at redshift $z=0.1557$. We observed SN\,2021aaev to rise in $32.5 \pm 1.0$ days since first light and reach a peak absolute magnitude of $-21.46 \pm 0.01$ in the ATLAS $o$ band. The pre-peak spectra resemble those of typical SNe IIn with flash-ionization features arising from the interaction with a dense, confined circumstellar medium (CSM), albeit the flash timescale is longer than usual ($>20$ days). Post peak, the narrow emission lines evolve slowly, and the absence of ejecta features indicates strong deceleration by the CSM. The total radiated energy (about $1.41\times10^{51}$~ergs) is possible with a low-mass (1--$2\,M_{\odot}$) ejecta ploughing into a massive (9--$19\,M_{\odot}$), extended (outer radius $>1\times10^{16}$~cm) H-rich CSM, or alternatively, with magnetar-powered models. Interestingly, the host environment consists of a spiral galaxy with a red substructure in the south-eastern part, and the SN's exact location coincided with the quiescent red substructure (star-formation rate$=0.02^{+0.13}_{-0.02}\,M_{\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$). Given the atypical environment and the obscuring effect of the massive CSM, a thermonuclear (Type Ia-CSM) origin cannot be ruled out. Altogether, SN\,2021aaev is a compelling case to study the diversity of SLSN-IIn features and their host environment.

 - **Abstract**
 In spider pulsar systems, a relativistic intrabinary shock forms when the pulsar wind collides with the massive outflow driven off the pulsar's low-mass stellar companion. The shock is a site of non-thermal particle acceleration, likely via shock-driven magnetic reconnection, and produces synchrotron emission. These shocks are among the few systems in which global scales can be reasonably captured with kinetic simulations, enabling first-principles particle acceleration and emission studies. We perform the first global 3D kinetic simulations of spider pulsar intrabinary shocks and predict their polarized emission properties. We report emission spectra, light curves, and polarization patterns as a function of the stripe-averaged magnetic field, cooling strength, and viewing inclination. At $90^\circ$ inclination and for a low stripe-averaged magnetic field, we reproduce the double peaked light curve observed in spider systems. We predict a significant polarization degree $\gtrsim15\%$, which monotonically increases with the stripe-averaged field strength. Our results can be applied to and tested by forthcoming X-ray polarization observations of spider pulsars.
