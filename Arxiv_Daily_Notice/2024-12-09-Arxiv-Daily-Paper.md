 - **Abstract**
 A chemical characterization of the Galactic Center is essential for understanding its formation and structural evolution. Trends of alpha-elements, such as Mg, Si, and Ca, serve as powerful diagnostic tools, offering insights into star-formation rates and gas-infall history. However, high extinction has previously hindered such studies. In this study, we present a detailed chemical abundance analysis of M giants in the Milky Way's Nuclear Star Cluster (NSC), focusing on alpha-element trends with metallicity. High-resolution, near-infrared spectra were obtained using the IGRINS spectrograph on the Gemini South telescope for nine M giants. Careful selection of spectral lines, based on a solar-neighborhood control sample of 50 M giants, was implemented to minimize systematic uncertainties. Our findings show enhanced alpha-element abundances in the predominantly metal-rich NSC stars, consistent with trends in the inner bulge. The NSC stars follow the high-[alpha/Fe] envelope seen in the solar vicinity's metal-rich population, indicating a high star-formation rate. The alpha-element trends decrease with increasing metallicity, also at the highest metallicities. Our results suggest the NSC population likely shares a similar evolutionary history with the inner bulge, challenging the idea of a recent dominant star formation burst. This connection between the NSC and the inner-disk sequence suggests that the chemical properties of extragalactic NSCs of Milky Way type galaxies could serve as a proxy for understanding the host galaxies' evolutionary processes.

 - **Abstract**
 Using the Subaru/FOCAS IFU capability, we examine the spatially resolved relationships between gas-phase metallicity, stellar mass, and star-formation rate surface densities (Sigma_* and Sigma_SFR, respectively) in extremely metal-poor galaxies (EMPGs) in the local universe. Our analysis includes 24 EMPGs, comprising 9,177 spaxels, which span a unique parameter space of local metallicity (12+log(O/H) = 6.9 to 7.9) and stellar mass surface density (Sigma_* ~ 10^5 to 10^7 Msun/kpc^2), extending beyond the range of existing large integral-field spectroscopic surveys. Through spatially resolved emission line diagnostics based on the [NII] BPT-diagram, we verify the absence of evolved active galactic nuclei in these EMPGs. Our findings reveal that, while the resolved mass-metallicity relation exhibits significant scatter in the low-mass regime, this scatter is closely correlated with local star-formation surface density. Specifically, metallicity decreases as Sigma_SFR increases for a given Sigma_*. Notably, half of the EMPGs show a distinct metal-poor horizontal branch on the resolved mass-metallicity relation. This feature typically appears at the peak clump with the highest Sigma_* and Sigma_SFR and is surrounded by a relatively metal-enriched ambient region. These findings support a scenario in which metal-poor gas infall fuels episodic star formation in EMPGs, consistent with the kinematic properties observed in these systems. In addition, we identify four EMPGs with exceptionally low central metallicities (12+log(O/H) <~ 7.2), which display only a metal-poor clump without a surrounding metal-rich region. This suggests that such ultra-low metallicity EMPGs, at less than a few percent of the solar metallicity, may serve as valuable analogs for galaxies in the early stages of galaxy evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 The majority of most luminous quasars during the epoch of reionization accrete near or above the Eddington limit, marking the vigorous growth of primitive supermassive black holes (SMBHs). However, their subsequent evolution and environmental impact remain poorly characterized. We present JWST/NIRSpec prism IFU observations of HSC J2239+0207, a low-luminosity quasar at $z\sim6.25$ likely in a late stage of mass assembly with an overmassive SMBH relative to its host galaxy. Using H$\beta$ and H$\alpha$ broad emission lines, we estimate an SMBH mass $M_{\rm BH}\sim3\times10^8~M_{\odot}$ and confirm its sub-Eddington accretion at $\lambda_{\rm Edd}\sim0.4$. Strong FeII emission and a proximity zone of typical size suggest a metal-rich, highly evolved system. In the far-UV, this quasar presents strong broad-absorption-line features, indicative of high-velocity winds ($\nu\sim10^4~{\rm km/s}$). Meanwhile, minimal dust reddening is inferred from the quasar continuum and broad-line Balmer decrement, suggesting little dust along the polar direction. Most interestingly, we identify a gas companion $\sim$5 kpc from the quasar with a high [OIII]/H$\beta$ ratio ($\gtrsim10$), likely representing outflowing gas blown away by AGN feedback. These results highlight HSC J2239+0207 as a likely fading quasar in transition, providing rare insights into SMBH evolution, AGN feedback, and AGN-galaxy interactions in the early Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 As star-forming galaxies approach or exceed a stellar mass around $10^{11} M_\odot$, they are increasingly likely to be quenched in a process generically called mass quenching. Central galaxies, which are quenched via mass rather than environmental quenching, therefore accumulate in a peak around this characteristic mass. While a number of processes may influence the shape of the quenched central stellar mass function (QCSMF), we find that its low-mass slope is strongly affected by the scatter in the mass of black holes at a given stellar mass, with higher scatters in the black hole population yielding shallower slopes. Higher scatters in the black hole mass spread out the stellar mass range over which quenching occurs, leading to shallower slopes. This trend holds across a variety of semi-analytic models and cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. A comparison with observations provides indirect evidence for a large scatter in black hole mass $\sigma(\log_{10}(M_\mathrm{BH})|M_*) \gtrsim 0.5$ dex, and a joint constraint on AGN feedback physics and the co-evolution of galaxies and black holes.
#### An unambiguous AGN and a Balmer break in an Ultraluminous Little Red Dot at z=4.47 from Ultradeep UNCOVER and All the Little Things Spectroscopy

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed exploration of the most optically-luminous Little Red Dot ($L_{H\alpha}=10^{44}$erg/s, $L_V=10^{45}$erg/s, F444W=22AB) found to date. Located in the Abell 2744 field, source A744-45924 was observed by NIRSpec/PRISM with ultradeep spectroscopy reaching SNR$\sim$100pix$^{-1}$, high-resolution 3-4 micron NIRCam/Grism spectroscopy, and NIRCam Medium Band imaging. The NIRCam spectra reveal high rest-frame EW $W_{H\alpha,0,broad}>800$Å, broad H$\alpha$ emission (FWHM$\sim$4500 km/s), on top of narrow, complex absorption. NIRSpec data show exceptionally strong rest-frame UV to NIR Fe II emission ($W_{FeII-UV,0}\sim$340Å), N IV]$\lambda\lambda$1483,1486 and N III]$\lambda$1750, and broad NIR O I $\lambda$8446 emission. The spectra unambiguously demonstrate a broad-line region associated with an inferred $M_{BH}\sim10^9M_\odot$ supermassive black hole embedded in dense gas, which might explain a non-detection in ultradeep Chandra X-ray data (>$10\times$ underluminous relative to broad $L_{H\alpha}$). Strong UV Nitrogen lines suggest supersolar N/O ratios due to rapid star formation or intense radiation near the AGN. The continuum shows a clear Balmer break at rest-frame 3650Å, which cannot be accounted for by an AGN power-law alone. A stellar population model produces an excellent fit with a reddened Balmer break and implying a massive ($M_*\sim8\times10^{10}M_\odot$), old $\sim$500 Myr, compact stellar core, among the densest stellar systems known ($\rho\sim3\times10^6M_\odot$/pc$^2$ for $R_{e,opt}=70\pm10$ pc), and AGN emission with extreme intrinsic EW $W_{H\alpha,0}\gg$1000Å. However, although high $M_*$ and $M_{BH}$ are supported by evidence of an overdensity containing 40 galaxies at $z=4.41-4.51$, deep high-resolution spectroscopy is required to confirm stellar absorption and rule out that dense gas around the AGN causes the Balmer break instead.

 - **Abstract**
 The circumgalactic medium (CGM) around massive galaxies plays a crucial role in regulating star formation and feedback. Using the CAMELS simulation suite, we develop emulators for the X-ray surface brightness profile and the X-ray luminosity--stellar mass scaling relation to investigate how stellar and AGN feedback shape the X-ray properties of the hot CGM. Our analysis shows that at CGM scales ($10^{12} \lesssim M_{\rm halo}/M_\odot \lesssim 10^{13}$, $10\lesssim r/{\rm kpc} \lesssim 400$), stellar feedback more significantly impacts the X-ray properties than AGN feedback within the parameters studied. Comparing the emulators to recent eROSITA All-Sky Survey observations, it was found that stronger feedback than currently implemented in the IllustrisTNG, SIMBA, and Astrid simulations is required to match observed CGM properties. However, adopting these enhanced feedback parameters causes deviations in the stellar-mass-halo-mass relations from observational constraints below the group mass scale. This tension suggests possible unaccounted systematics in X-ray CGM observations or inadequacies in the feedback models of cosmological simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 A realistic and detailed description of neutrinos in binary neutron star (BNS) mergers is essential to build reliable models of such systems. To this end, we present BNS_NURATES, a novel open-source numerical library designed for the efficient on-the-fly computation of neutrino interactions, with particular focus on regimes relevant to BNS mergers. BNS_NURATES targets an higher level of accuracy and realism in the implementation of commonly employed reactions by accounting for relevant microphysics effects on the interactions, such as weak magnetism and mean field effects. It also includes the contributions of inelastic neutrino scattering off electrons and positrons and (inverse) nucleon decays. Finally, it offers a way to reconstruct the neutrino distribution function in the framework of moment-based transport schemes. As a first application, we compute both energy-dependent and energy-integrated neutrino emissivities and opacities for conditions extracted from a BNS merger simulation with M1 transport scheme. We find some qualitative differences in the results when considering the impact of the additional relevant reactions and of microphysics effects. For example, neutrino-electron/positron scattering reactions are important for the energy exchange of heavy-type neutrinos as they do not undergo semi-leptonic charged-current processes, when $\mu^\pm$ are not accounted for. Moreover, weak magnetism and mean field effects can significantly modify the contribution of $\beta$-processes for electron-type (anti)neutrinos, increasing at the same time the importance of (inverse) neutron decays. The improved treatment for the reaction rates also modify the conditions at which neutrinos decouple from matter in the system, potentially affecting their emission spectra.

 - **Abstract**
 We increase the spectroscopic completeness of the 100 pc white dwarf sample in the SDSS footprint with 840 additional spectra. Our spectroscopy is 86% complete for white dwarfs hotter than $T_{\rm eff}= 5000$ K, where H$\alpha$ remains visible and provides reliable constraints on the atmospheric composition. We identify 2108 DA white dwarfs with pure hydrogen atmospheres, and show that ultramassive DA white dwarfs with $M\geq1.1~M_{\odot}$ are an order of magnitude less common below 10,000 K. This is consistent with a fraction of them getting stuck on the crystallization sequence due to $^{22}$Ne distillation. In addition, there are no ultramassive DA white dwarfs with $M\geq1.1~M_{\odot}$ and $T_{\rm eff}\leq6000$ K in our sample, likely because Debye cooling makes them rapidly fade away. We detect a significant trend in the fraction of He-atmosphere white dwarfs as a function of temperature; the fraction increases from 9% at 20,000 K to 32% at 6000 K. This provides direct evidence of convective mixing in cool DA white dwarfs. Finally, we detect a relatively tight sequence of low-mass DQ white dwarfs in color-magnitude diagrams for the first time. We discuss the implications of this tight DQ sequence, and conclude with a discussion of the future prospects from the upcoming ULTRASAT mission and the large-scale multi-fiber spectroscopic surveys.
#### The lithium-rich giant stars puzzle: New observational trends for a general-mass-loss scenario

 - **Abstract**
 The existence of one percent of lithium-rich giant stars among normal, lithium-poor giant stars continues to be poorly explained. By merging two catalogues, one containing 10,535 lithium-rich giant stars with lithium abundances ranging from 1.5 to 4.9 dex, and the other detecting infrared sources, we have found 421 clump giant stars and 196 first-ascending giant stars with infrared excesses indicating stellar mass losses. The clump stars are the most lithium-rich. Approximately 5.8 percent of these stars episodically lose mass in periods of approximately 10^4 years or less, while the remaining stars ceased their mass loss and maintained their lithium for nearly 10^7 years. We propose a scenario in which all giant stars with masses below two solar masses undergo prompt lithium enrichment with mass-ejection episodes. We suggest that mass loss results from internal angular-momentum transport. It is possible that a transitory instability, perhaps of magnetic origin, rapidly transports the nuclear material responsible for the lithium enrichment to the stellar surface and triggers shell ejections. Additionally, the strong mass loss in some lithium-rich stars during their evolution activates their chromospheres, as observed in ultraviolet spectra. Furthermore, intense episodical mass losses in these stages led to the observable formation of complex organic and inorganic particles, as detected in near-infrared spectra. In contrast to first-ascending giant stars, helium flashes during the clump can contribute to additional lithium enrichment alongside the aforementioned process. The combination of these two lithium sources may explain the much higher observed lithium abundances in clump stars, as well as their observed infrared excesses. If our scenario based on a universal and rapid lithium enrichment episode process is correct, it could explain the rarity of lithium-rich giant stars.

 - **Abstract**
 The circumgalactic medium (CGM) is a key component needed to understand the physical processes governing the flows of gas around galaxies. Quantifying its evolution and its dependence on galaxy properties is particularly important for our understanding of accretion and feedback mechanisms. We select a volume-selected sample of 66 {\it isolated} star-forming galaxies (SFGs) at $0.4< z <1.5$ with $\log(M_\star/M_{\odot})> 9$ from the MusE GAs FLOw and Wind (MEGAFLOW) survey. Using MgII 2796,2803 absorptions in background quasars, we measure the covering fraction $f_c$ and quantify how the cool gas profile depends on galaxy properties (such as star-formation rate (SFR), stellar mass ($M_\star$) or azimuthal angle relative to the line of sight) and how these dependencies evolve with redshift. The MgII covering fraction of isolated galaxies is a strong function of impact parameter, and is steeper than previously reported. The impact parameter $b_{50}$ at which $f_c = $50\% is $b_{50}=50\pm7$kpc ($65\pm7$ kpc) for $W_r^{2796}>$0.5 Å($W_r^{2796}>0.1$ Å), respectively. It is weakly correlated with SFR ($\propto$ SFR$^{0.08\pm0.09}$) and decreases with cosmic time ($\propto (1+z)^{0.8 \pm 0.7}$), contrary to the expectation of increasingly larger halos with time. The covering fraction is also higher along the minor axis than along the major axis at the $\approx 2 \sigma$ level. The CGM traced by \MgII{} is similar across the isolated galaxy population. Indeed, among the isolated galaxies with an impact parameter below 55 kpc, all have associated MgII absorption with $W_r^{2796}>$0.3Å, resulting in a steep covering fraction $f_c(b)$.
#### HD 60435: The star that stopped pulsating

 - **Abstract**
 HD 60435 is a well-known rapidly oscillating (roAp) Ap star with a series of alternating even and odd degree modes, making it a prime asteroseismic target. It is also an oblique pulsator with rotational inclination, $i$, and magnetic/pulsation obliquity, $\beta$, such that both magnetic/pulsation poles are viewed over the rotation period, $P_{\rm rot} = 7.679696$ d, determined from rotational light variations. While some roAp stars have stable pulsation mode amplitudes over decades, HD 60435 is known to have amplitude variations on time scales as short as 1 d. We show from 5 yr of {\it TESS} observations that there is strong amplitude modulation on this short time scale with possible mode interactions. Most remarkably, HD 60435 stopped pulsating during the time span of the {\it TESS} observations. This is the first time that any pulsating star has been observed to cease pulsating entirely. That has implications for mode interaction, excitation and damping, and is relevant to the problem of why only some stars in many pulsation instability strips pulsate, while others do not. During a 24.45-d time span of the {\it TESS} data when there was mode stability for a dipole mode and a quadrupole mode, the oblique pulsator model constrained $i$ and $\beta$, which we used to model those modes with a magnetic pulsation model from which we determined a polar field strength of 4 kG, in good agreement with a known magnetic measurement. We modelled the frequency separations showing that they can constrain the global metallicity, something that is not possible from spectroscopy of the highly peculiar Ap atmosphere.

 - **Abstract**
 The stability of weakly collisional plasmas is well represented by linear theory, and the generated waves play an essential role in the thermodynamics of these systems. The velocity distribution functions (VDF) characterizing kinetic particle behavior are commonly represented as a sum of anisotropic bi-Maxwellians. For the majority of in situ observations of solar wind plasmas enabled by heliospheric missions, a three bi-Maxwellian model is commonly applied for the ions, assuming that the VDF consists of a proton core, proton beam, and a single He ($\alpha$) particle population, each with their own density, bulk velocity, and anisotropic temperature. Resolving an $\alpha$-beam component was generally not possible due to instrumental limitations. The Solar Orbiter Solar Wind Analyser Proton and Alpha Sensor (SWA PAS) resolves velocity space with sufficient coverage and accuracy to routinely characterize secondary $\alpha$ populations consistently. This design makes the SWA PAS dataset ideal for examining effects of the $\alpha$-particle beam on the plasma's kinetic stability. We test the wave signatures observed in the magnetic field power spectrum at ion scales and compare them to the predictions from linear plasma theory, Doppler-shifted into the spacecraft reference frame. We find that taking into account the $\alpha$-particle beam component is necessary to predict the coherent wave signatures in the observed power spectra, emphasizing the importance of separating the $\alpha$-particle populations as is traditionally done for protons. Moreover, we demonstrate that the drifts of beam components are responsible for the majority of the modes that propagate in oblique direction to the magnetic field, while their temperature anisotropies are the primary source of parallel Fast Magnetosonic Modes in the solar wind.

 - **Abstract**
 The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has recently discovered a new population of objects at high redshift referred to as `Little Red Dots' (LRDs). Their nature currently remains elusive, despite their surprisingly high inferred number densities. This emerging population of red point-like sources is reshaping our view of the early Universe and may shed light on the formation of high-redshift supermassive black holes. Here we present a spectroscopically confirmed LRD CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 at $z_{\rm spec}=8.6319\pm 0.0005$ hosting an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN), using JWST data. This source shows the typical spectral shape of an LRD (blue UV and red optical continuum, unresolved in JWST imaging), along with broad H$\beta$ line emission, detection of high-ionization emission lines (CIV, NIV]) and very high electron temperature indicative of the presence of AGN. This is also combined with a very low metallicity ($Z<0.1 Z_\odot$). The presence of all these diverse features in one source makes CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 unique. We show that the inferred black hole mass of CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 ($M_{\rm BH}=1.0^{+0.6}_{-0.4}\times 10^{8}\rm ~M_\odot$) strongly challenges current standard theoretical models and simulations of black hole formation, and forces us to adopt `ad hoc' prescriptions. Indeed if massive seeds, or light seeds with super-Eddington accretion, are considered, the observed BH mass of CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 at $z=8.6$ can be reproduced. Moreover, the black hole is over-massive compared to its host, relative to the local $M_{\rm BH}-M_*$ relations, pointing towards an earlier and faster evolution of the black hole compared to its host galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 The motion of charged particles under the Lorentz force in the magnetosphere of neutron stars, represented by a dipole field in the Schwarzschild spacetime, can be determined by an effective potential, whose local extrema govern circular orbits both in and off the equatorial plane, which coincides with the symmetry plane of the dipole field. In this work, we provide a detailed description of the properties of these "conservative" circular orbits and, using the approximation represented by the Landau-Lifshitz equation, examine the role of the radiative back-reaction force that influences the motion of charged particles following both the in and off equatorial circular orbits, as well as the chaotic orbits confined to belts centered around the circular orbits. To provide clear insight into these dynamics, we compare particle motion with and without the back-reaction force. We demonstrate that, in the case of an attractive Lorentz force, the back-reaction leads to the charged particles falling onto the neutron star's surface in all scenarios considered. For the repulsive Lorentz force, in combination with the back-reaction force, we observe a widening of stable equatorial circular orbits; the off-equatorial orbits shift toward the equatorial plane and subsequently widen if they are sufficiently close to the plane. Otherwise, the off-equatorial orbits evolve toward the neutron star surface. The critical latitude, which separates orbital widening from falling onto the surface, is determined numerically as a function of the electromagnetic interaction's intensity.

We have used the exquisite data from $Gaia$'s data release 3 (DR3) to study 21 relatively rich and nearby open clusters with member numbers ($N_{\rm{cl}}$)$>500$. We have developed a non-parametric method to identify cluster members. Our method works well for clusters located in both sparse and crowded environments, hence, can be applied to a wide variety of star clusters. Since the member classification scheme does not make any assumptions on the expected distributions of potential cluster members, our method can identify members associated with clusters that are oddly shaped or have complex internal spatial or kinematic structures. In addition, since the membership determination does not depend on the proximity to any well-defined sequences on the color-magnitude diagram, this method easily identifies straggler members. Furthermore, for each of these clusters, we estimate essential cluster properties including age, metallicity, distance, and reddening using detailed Markov-Chain Monte Carlo parameter estimation. We report the full posteriors for these important cluster properties for all clusters in our study.

 - **Abstract**
 Observed IR excesses indicate that protoplanetary discs evolve slowly for the majority of their lifetime before losing their near- and mid-IR excesses on short timescales. Photoevaporation models can explain this "two-timescale" nature of disc evolution through the removal of inner regions of discs after a few million years. However, they also predict the existence of a population of non-accreting discs with large cavities. Such discs are scarce within the observed population, suggesting the models are incomplete. We explore whether radiation-pressure-driven outflows are able to remove enough dust to fit observations. We simulate these outflows using cuDisc, including dust dynamics, growth/fragmentation, radiative transfer and a parameterisation of internal photoevaporation. We find that, in most cases, dust mass-loss rates are around 5-10 times too small to meet observational constraints. Particles are launched from the disc inner rim, however grains larger than around a micron do not escape in the outflow, meaning mass-loss rates are too low for the initial dust masses at gap-opening. Only systems that have smooth photoevaporation profiles with gas mass-loss rates $>\sim 5 \times 10^{-9}$ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ and disc dust masses $<\sim$1 $M_\oplus$ at the time of gap opening can meet observational constraints; in the current models these manifest as EUV winds driven by atypically large high-energy photon fluxes. We also find that the height of the disc's photosphere is controlled by small grains in the outflow as opposed to shadowing from a hot inner rim; the effect of this can be seen in synthetic scattered light observations.

 - **Abstract**
 The magnetic buoyancy (MBI) and Parker instabilities are strong and generic instabilities expected to occur in most astrophysical systems with sufficiently strong magnetic fields. In galactic and accretion discs, large-scale magnetic fields are thought to result from the mean-field dynamo action, in particular, the $\alpha^2\Omega$. Using non-ideal MHD equations, we model a section of the galactic disc in which the large-scale magnetic field is generated by an imposed $\alpha$-effect and differential rotation. We extend our earlier study of the interplay between magnetic buoyancy and the mean-field dynamo. We add differential rotation which enhances the dynamo and cosmic rays which enhance magnetic buoyancy. We construct a simple 1D model which replicates all significant features of the 3D simulations. We confirm that magnetic buoyancy can lead to oscillatory magnetic fields and discover that it can vary the magnetic field parity between quadrupolar and dipolar, and that inclusion of the differential rotation is responsible for the switch in field parity. Our results suggest that the large-scale magnetic field can have a dipolar parity within a few kiloparsecs of the galactic centre, provided the MBI is significantly stronger the the dynamo. Quadrupolar parity can remain predominant in the outer parts of a galactic disc. Cosmic rays accelerate both the dynamo and the MBI and support oscillatory non-linear states, a spatial magnetic field structure similar to the alternating magnetic field directions observed in some edge-on galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 Although Cherenkov detectors of high-energy neutrinos in ice and water are often optimized to detect TeV-PeV neutrinos, they may also be sensitive to transient neutrino sources in the 1-100~GeV energy range. A wide variety of transient sources have been predicted to emit GeV neutrinos. In light of the upcoming IceCube-Upgrade, which will extend the IceCube detector's sensitivity down to a few GeV, as well as improve its angular resolution, we survey a variety of transient source models and compare their predicted neutrino fluences to detector sensitivities, in particular those of IceCube-DeepCore and the IceCube Upgrade. We consider the ranges of neutrino fluence from transients powered by non-relativistic shocks, such as novae, supernovae, fast blue optical transients, and tidal disruption events. We also consider fast radio bursts and relativistic outflows of high- and low-luminosity gamma-ray bursts. Our study sheds light on the prospects of observing GeV transients with existing and upcoming neutrino facilities.
#### The reliability of gas-phase metallicities immediately adjacent to non-star-forming spaxels in MaNGA

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we use gas phase metallicities calculated from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point (MaNGA) Data Release 17 (DR17) to assess the extent of potential biases in spaxels which are spatially adjacent to spaxels identified as non-star forming (non-SF) on a BPT diagram. We identify a sample of $\sim21,000$ such spaxels with calculable metallicities from the full metallicity catalogue ($\sim$1.57 million), representing a small fraction ($\sim1.3$ per cent) of the full metallicity sample. $\sim$23 per cent of all galaxies with at least one spaxel with a calculable metallicity also contain at least one spaxel with a calculated metallicity adjacent to a non-SF spaxel, with a typical galaxy hosting 9 non-SF-adjacent spaxels. From our suite of 6 different metallicity calibrations, we find that only the metallicity calibrations based entirely on the [NII]$_{6584}$/H$\alpha$ ratio are affected, showing systematic offsets to higher metallicities by up to $\sim$0.04 dex if they are located adjacent to a non-SF flagged spaxel, relative to a radially matched control sample. The inclusion of additional diagnostic diagrams (based on [OI]$_{6300}$~\&/or [SII]$_{6717+6731}$) is insufficient to remove the observed offset in the [NII]$_{6584}$/H$\alpha$ based calibrations. Using a stricter diagnostic line on the BPT diagram removes $\sim$94 per cent of identified bordering spaxels with metallicities for all metallicity calibrations, and removes the residual offset to higher metallicity values seen in [NII]$_{6584}$/H$\alpha$ calibrations. If science cases demand an exceptionally clean metallicity sample, we recommend either a stricter BPT cut, and/or a non-[NII]$_{6584}$/H$\alpha$ based metallicity calibration.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent James Webb Space Telescope observations of cool, rocky exoplanets reveal a probable lack of thick atmospheres, suggesting prevalent escape of the secondary atmospheres formed after losing primordial hydrogen. Yet, simulations indicate that hydrodynamic escape of secondary atmospheres, composed of nitrogen and carbon dioxide, requires intense fluxes of ionizing radiation (XUV) to overcome the effects of high molecular weight and efficient line cooling. This transonic outflow of hot, ionized metals (not hydrogen) presents a novel astrophysical regime ripe for exploration. We introduce an analytic framework to determine which planets retain or lose their atmospheres, positioning them on either side of the cosmic shoreline. We model the radial structure of escaping atmospheres as polytropic expansions - power-law relationships between density and temperature driven by local XUV heating. Our approach diagnoses line cooling with a three-level atom model and incorporates how ion-electron interactions reduce mean molecular weight. Crucially, hydrodynamic escape onsets for a threshold XUV flux dependent upon the atmosphere's gravitational binding. Ensuing escape rates either scale linearly with XUV flux when weakly ionized (energy-limited) or are controlled by a collisional-radiative thermostat when strongly ionized. Thus, airlessness is determined by whether the XUV flux surpasses the critical threshold during the star's active periods, accounting for expendable primordial hydrogen and revival by volcanism. We explore atmospheric escape from Young-Sun Mars and Earth, LHS-1140 b and c, and TRAPPIST-1 b. Our modeling characterizes the bottleneck of atmospheric loss on the occurrence of observable Earth-like habitats and offers analytic tools for future studies.

 - **Abstract**
 Plasmoids (or magnetic islands) are believed to play an important role in the onset of fast magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration during solar flares and eruptions. Direct imaging of flare current sheets and formation/ejection of multiple plasmoids in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) images, along with simultaneous X-ray and radio observations, offers significant insights into the mechanisms driving particle acceleration in solar flares. Here we present direct imaging of the formation and ejection of multiple plasmoids in flare plasma/current sheets and associated quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) observed in X-ray and radio wavelengths, using observations from SDO/AIA, RHESSI, and Fermi GBM. These plasmoids propagate bidirectionally upward and downward along the flare current sheet beneath the erupting flux rope during two successive flares associated with confined/failed eruptions. The flux rope exhibits evidence of helical kink instability with formation and ejection of multiple plasmoids in the flare current sheet, as predicted in an MHD simulation of a kink-unstable flux rope. RHESSI X-ray images show double coronal sources (``loop-top" and higher coronal sources) located at both ends of the flare current/plasma sheet. Moreover, we detected an additional transient faint X-ray source (6-12 keV) located between the double coronal sources, which was co-spatial with multiple plasmoids in the flare current sheet. X-ray (soft and hard) and radio (decimetric) observations unveil QPPs (periods$\approx$10-s and 100-s) associated with the ejection and coalescence of plasmoids. These observations suggest that energetic electrons are accelerated during the ejection and coalescence of multiple plasmoids in the flare current sheet.
#### Lack of Rest-frame UV Variability in Little Red Dots Based on HST and JWST Observations

 - **Abstract**
 Variability is a fundamental signature for active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity, and serve as an unbiased indicator for rapid instability happened near the center supermassive black hole (BH). Previous studies showed that AGN variability does not have strong redshift evolution, and scales with their bolometric luminosity and BH mass, making it a powerful probe to identify low-mass, low-luminosity AGNs at high redshift. JWST has discovered a new population of high-redshift galaxies likely hosting moderate accreting BHs ($10^6\,M_\odot$) -- the little red dots (LRDs, $z=4-10$). In this paper, we study the variability of a sample of 21 LRDs with V-shaped SEDs in three JWST deep fields that also have reliable HST observations in closely paired filters at 1-2 um (rest-frame UV), with the time difference between 6 and 11 years. This LRD sample covers a redshift range of $3<z<8$ with median -21.3$<M_\mathrm{UV}<$-18.4. Based on both photometry and imaging difference analyses, we find a mean magnitude difference of 0.12$\pm$0.24 mag, with none of the LRDs showing photometric variability at 3$\sigma$ significance. Extrapolation of SDSS quasar variability predicts a magnitude change of order 0.3 mag for our LRD sample. This suggests an upper limit of about 30\% AGN contribution to the total observed UV light in our sample of LRDs.
#### Using the helium triplet as a tracer of the physics of giant planet outflows

 - **Abstract**
 Hydrodynamic outflows, such as those observed escaping close-in gas giant planets, are not isothermal in structure. Their highly ionized nature allows them to cool adiabatically at distances beyond several planetary radii. The contrast between the hottest gas temperatures at around 10,000K and the coldest at around 1,000K triggers an excess population of the observable helium triplet. This excess is caused by the suppression of collisional de-excitation from the triplet state at cool temperatures. Using radiation-hydrodynamic simulations, we show that this helium triplet excess may explain the excess broadening seen in HD 189733b's observed transmission spectrum, demonstrating adiabatic cooling of its outflow, confirming its hydrodynamic nature on scales of several planetary radii. However, further observations are required to confirm this conclusion. Furthermore, we explore a range of electron transitions for neutral helium which were not considered in the previous literature. We find that the He$2^1$S state is unavailable as a potential reservoir for He$2^3$S electrons. Additionally, the de-excitation to the ground state must be considered for stellar spectra later than K2 in predicting the correct helium triplet population. Importantly, since triplet helium inherits momentum from ionized helium as it is generated by recombination, it is significantly less prone to fractionation than ground-state neutral helium. However at separations of $\gtrsim 0.05$~au, ionization at the flow base and drag on helium weaken, leading to significant fractionation of the then mostly neutral helium. This in turn, can cause a suppression of the Helium transit depth, even though the helium line width remains large.
