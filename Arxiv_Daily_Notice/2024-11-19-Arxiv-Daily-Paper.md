 - **Abstract**
 We present the first set of high-resolution, hydrodynamical cosmological simulations of galaxy formation in a Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) framework. These simulations were performed with a new version of the GASOLINE2 code, known as FUZZY-GASOLINE, which can simulate quantum FDM effects alongside a comprehensive baryonic model that includes metal cooling, star formation, supernova feedback, and black hole physics, previously used in the NIHAO simulation suite. Using thirty zoom-in simulations of galaxies with halo masses in the range $10^9 \lesssim M_{\text{halo}}/M_{\odot} \lesssim 10^{11}$, we explore how the interplay between FDM quantum potential and baryonic processes influences dark matter distributions and observable galaxy properties. Our findings indicate that both baryons and low-mass FDM contribute to core formation within dark matter profiles, though through distinct mechanisms: FDM-induced cores emerge in all haloes, particularly within low-mass systems at high redshift, while baryon-driven cores form within a specific mass range and at low redshift. Despite these significant differences in dark matter structure, key stellar observables such as star formation histories and velocity dispersion profiles remain remarkably similar to predictions from the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) model, making it challenging to distinguish between CDM and FDM solely through stellar observations.

 - **Abstract**
 The [C II] fine-structure line at 157.74 $\mu$m is one of the brightest far-infrared emission lines and an important probe of galaxy properties like the star formation rate (SFR) and the molecular gas mass ($M_{\mathrm{mol}}$). Using high-resolution numerical simulations, we test the reliability of the [C II] line as a tracer of $M_{\mathrm{mol}}$ in high-redshift galaxies and investigate secondary dependences of the [C II]-$M_{\mathrm{mol}}$ relation on the SFR and metallicity. We investigate the time evolution of the [C II] luminosity function (LF) and the relative spatial extent of [C II] emission and star formation. We post-process galaxies from the MARIGOLD simulations at redshifts $3 \le z \leq 7$ to obtain their [C II] emission. These simulations were performed with the sub-grid chemistry model, HYACINTH, to track the non-equilibrium abundances of $\mathrm{H_2}$, $\mathrm{CO}$, $\rm C$ and $\mathrm{C^+}$ on the fly. Based on a statistical sample of galaxies at these redshifts, we investigate correlations between the [C II] line luminosity, L([C II]), and the SFR, the $M_{\mathrm{mol}}$, the total gas mass and the metal mass in gas phase ($M_{\mathrm{metal}}$). We find that accounting for secondary dependencies in the L([C II])-$M_{\mathrm{mol}}$ relation improves the $M_{\mathrm{mol}}$ prediction by a factor of 2.3. The [C II] emission in our simulated galaxies shows the tightest correlation with $M_{\mathrm{metal}}$. About 20% (10%) of our simulated galaxies at $z=5$ ($z=4$) have [C II] emission extending $\geq 2$ times farther than the star formation activity. The [C II] LF evolves rapidly and is always well approximated by a double power law that does not show an exponential cutoff at the bright end. We record a 600-fold increase in the number density of L([C II]) $\sim 10^9 \, \mathrm{L_{\odot}}$ emitters in 1.4 Gyr.
#### Contemporaneous high-angular-resolution imaging of the AGB star W Hya in vibrationally excited H2O lines and visible polarized light with ALMA and VLT/SPHERE-ZIMPOL

 - **Abstract**
 We present contemporaneous high-angular-resolution millimeter imaging and visible polarimetric imaging of the nearby asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star W Hya to better understand the dynamics and dust formation within a few stellar radii. The star W Hya was observed in two vibrationally excited H2O lines at 268 and 251 GHz with ALMA at a spatial resolution of 16 x 20 mas and at 748 and 820 nm at a resolution of 26 x 27 mas with the VLT/SPHERE-ZIMPOL. ALMA's high spatial resolution allowed us to image strong emission of the vibrationally excited H2O line at 268 GHz (v2 = 2, J_K_a,K_c = 6_5,2 - 7_4,3) over the stellar surface instead of absorption against the continuum, which is expected for thermal excitation. Strong, spotty emission was also detected along and just outside the stellar disk limb at an angular distance of ~40 mas (~1.9 stellar radii), extending to ~60 mas (~2.9 stellar radii). Another H2O line (v2 = 2, J_K_a,K_c = 9_2,8 - 8_3,5) at 251 GHz with a similar upper-level energy was tentatively identified, which shows absorption over the stellar surface. This suggests that the emission over the surface seen in the 268 GHzH2O line is suprathermal or even maser emission. The estimated gas temperature and H2O density are consistent with the radiatively pumped masers. The 268 GHz H2O line reveals global infall at up to ~15 km/s within 2--3 stellar radii, but outflows at up to ~8 km/s are also present. The polarized intensity maps obtained in the visible reveal clumpy dust clouds forming within ~40 mas (~1.9 stellar radii) with a particularly prominent cloud in the SW quadrant and a weaker cloud in the east. The 268 GHz H2O emission overlaps very well with the visible polarized intensity maps, which suggests that both the nonthermal and likely maser H2O emission and the dust originate from dense, cool pockets in the inhomogeneous atmosphere within ~2--3 stellar radii.

 - **Abstract**
 To date, a number of changing-look (CL) active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are known. We studied, in detail what happens to the X-ray spectrum during the CL events using the example of the nearby CL Seyfert NGC1566, which was observed by Swift, NuSTAR, XMM-Newton, and Suzaku. We applied the Comptonization model to describe an evolution of NGC~1566 X-ray spectra during outbursts and compared these results with a typical behavior for other AGNs to identify some differences and common properties that can ultimately help us to better understand the physics of the CL phenomenon. We found that changes in the X-ray properties of NGC1566 are characterized by a different combination of Sy1 (using 1H0707-495 as a representative) and Sy2 properties (using NGC7679 and Mrk3 as their representatives). At high X-ray luminosities NGC1566 exhibits the behavior typical for Sy1, and at low luminosities we see a transition of NGC1566 from the Sy1 behavior to the Sy2 pattern. We revealed the saturation of the spectral indices, ā for these four AGNs during outbursts (ā_1566~1.1, ā _0707~2, ā _7679~0.9 and ā_mrk3~0.9) and determined the masses of the black holes (BHs) in the centers of these AGNs namely, M_0707~6.8x10^7 M_sol, M_7679~8.4x10^6 M_sol, M_mrk3~2.2x10^8 M_sol and M_1566~2x10^5 M_sol, applying the scaling method. Our spectral analysis shows that the changing-look of NGC1566 from Sy1.2 to Sy1.9 in 2019 was accompanied by the transition of NGC1566 to an accretion regime which is typical for the intermediate and highly soft spectral states of other BHs. We also find that when going from Sy2 to Sy1, the spectrum of NGC1566 shows an increase in the soft excess accompanied by a decrease in the Comptonized fraction (0.1<f<0.5), which is consistent with the typical behavior of BH sources during X-ray outburst decay.
#### The effect of opacity on neutron star Type I X-ray burst quenching

 - **Abstract**
 One long standing tension between theory and observations of Type I X-ray burst is the accretion rate at which the burst disappear due to stabilization of the nuclear burning that powers them. This is observed to happen at roughly one third of the theoretical expectations. Various solutions have been proposed, the most notable of which is the addition of a yet unknown source of heat in the upper layers of the crust, below the burning envelope. In this paper we ran several simulations using the 1D code MESA to explore the impact of opacity on the threshold mass accretion rate after which the bursts disappear, finding that a higher than expected opacity in the less dense layers near the surface has a stabilizing effect.

 - **Abstract**
 Based on the Gaia Data Release 3 and APOGEE datasets, we investigate the kinematic differences between young stellar objects (YSOs) and their parent clouds in five nearby star-forming regions. Overall, the 1D velocity differences between Class II YSOs and their parent molecular cloud range from [0, 1.4] km/s. In feedback environments dominated by outflows, massive stars, and supernova feedback, the corresponding velocity differences range from [0, 1.4] km/s, [0.1, 0.4] km/s, and [0.1, 1] km/s, respectively. These results indicate that YSO kinematics are not significantly affected by these different types of feedback environment. Additionally, compared to the Class II YSOs, Class III YSOs have slightly larger velocities and dispersions.
#### Modeling the X-ray emission of the Boomerang nebula and implication for its potential ultrahigh-energy gamma-ray emission

 - **Abstract**
 The Boomerang nebula is a bright radio and X-ray pulsar wind nebula (PWN) powered by an energetic pulsar, PSR~J2229+6114. It is spatially coincident with one of the brightest ultrahigh-energy (UHE, $\ge 100$\,TeV) gamma-ray sources, LHAASO~J2226+6057. While X-ray observations have provided radial profiles for both the intensity and photon index of the nebula, previous theoretical studies have not reached an agreement on their physical interpretation, which also lead to different anticipation of the UHE emission from the nebula. In this work, we model its X-ray emission with a dynamical evolution model of PWN, considering both convective and diffusive transport of electrons. On the premise of fitting the X-ray intensity and photon index profiles, we find that the magnetic field within the Boomerang nebula is weak ($\sim 10\mu$G in the core region and diminishing to $1\mu\,G$ at the periphery), which therefore implies a significant contribution to the UHE gamma-ray emission by the inverse Compton (IC) radiation of injected electron/positron pairs. Depending on the particle transport mechanism, the UHE gamma-ray flux contributed by the Boomerang nebula via the IC radiation may constitute about $10-50\%$ of the flux of LHAASO~J2226+6057 at 100\,TeV, and up to 30\% at 500\,TeV. Finally, we compare our results with previous studies and discuss potential hadronic UHE emission from the PWN. In our modeling, most of the spindown luminosity of the pulsar may be transformed into thermal particles or relativistic protons.
#### Investigation of the non-thermal X-ray emission from the supernova remnant CTB 37B hosting the magnetar CXOU J171405.7$-$381031

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed X-ray investigation of a region (S1) exhibiting non-thermal X-ray emission within the supernova remnant (SNR) CTB 37B hosting the magnetar CXOU J171405.7$-$381031. Previous analyses modeled this emission with a power law (PL), inferring various values for the photon index ($\Gamma$) and absorbing column density ($N_{\rm H}$). Based on these, S1 was suggested to be the SNR shell, a background pulsar wind nebula (PWN), or an interaction region between the SNR and a molecular cloud. Our analysis of a larger dataset favors a steepening (broken or curved PL) spectrum over a straight PL, with the best-fit broken power-law (BPL) parameters of $\Gamma=1.23\pm0.23$ and $2.24\pm0.16$ below and above a break at $5.57\pm0.52$ keV, respectively. However, a simple PL or srcut model cannot be definitively ruled out. For the BPL model, the inferred $N_{\rm H}=(4.08\pm0.72)\times 10^{22}\rm \ cm^{-2}$ towards S1 is consistent with that of the SNR, suggesting a physical association. The BPL-inferred spectral break $\Delta \Gamma \approx 1$ and hard $\Gamma$ can be naturally explained by a non-thermal bremsstrahlung (NTB) model. We present an evolutionary NTB model that reproduces the observed spectrum, which indicates the presence of sub-relativistic electrons within S1. However, alternate explanations for S1, an unrelated PWN or the SNR shock with unusually efficient acceleration, cannot be ruled out. We discuss these explanations and their implications for gamma-ray emission from CTB 37B, and describe future observations that could settle the origin of S1.
#### Surface accretion as a dust retention mechanism in protoplanetary disks. I. Formulation and proof-of-concept simulations

 - **Abstract**
 Planetesimal formation via the streaming and gravitational instabilities of dust in protoplanetary disks requires a local enhancement of the dust-to-gas mass ratio. Radial drift of large grains toward pressure bumps in gas disks is a plausible mechanism for achieving the required dust concentration. However, recent millimeter disk observations suggest that the maximum sizes of dust grains in these disks are considerably smaller than predicted by dust evolution models that assume sticky grains. This indicates that the grains may be more strongly coupled to the gas and hence drift more slowly than previously anticipated. In this study, we propose a new dust retention mechanism that enables an enhancement of the dust-to-gas mass ratio in disks with slowly drifting grains. This mechanism assumes that a surface accretion flow driven by magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) winds removes disk gas while retaining the slowly drifting grains below the flow. This process is expected to occur when the timescale of gas removal is shorter than the timescale of dust radial advection. To test this, we develop a radially one-dimensional framework for the transport of gas and dust in a disk with a vertically nonuniform accretion structure. Using this framework, we simulate the growth, fragmentation, and radial transport of dust grains in surface-accreting disks. Our simulations confirm a significant enhancement of the midplane dust-to-gas mass ratio when the predicted conditions for dust retention are met. Dust retention by MHD-driven surface accretion flows may thus pave the way for planetesimal formation from poorly sticky grains.

 - **Abstract**
 Blazars are a subclass of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with relativistic jets pointing toward the observer. They are notable for their flux variability at all observed wavelengths and timescales. Together with simultaneous measurements at lower energies, the very-high-energy (VHE) emission observed during blazar flares may be used to probe the population of accelerated particles. However, optimally triggering observations of blazar high states can be challenging. Notable examples include identifying a flaring episode in real time and predicting VHE flaring activity based on lower energy observables. For this purpose, we have developed a novel deep learning analysis framework, based on data-driven anomaly detection techniques. It is capable of detecting various types of anomalies in real-world, multiwavelength light curves, ranging from clear high states to subtle correlations across bands. Based on unsupervised anomaly detection and clustering methods, we differentiate source variability from noisy background activity, without the need for a labeled training dataset of flaring states. The framework incorporates measurement uncertainties and is robust given data quality challenges, such as varying cadences and observational gaps. We evaluate our approach using both historical data and simulations of blazar light curves in two energy bands, corresponding to sources observable with the Fermi Large Area Telescope, and the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO). In a statistical analysis, we show that our framework can reliably detect known historical flares.
#### Multi-messenger emission from magnetic reconnection in blazar jets: the case of TXS 0506+056

 - **Abstract**
 Measurements from astroparticle experiments, such as the 2017 flare associated with the source TXS 0506+056, indicate that blazars act as multi-messenger (MM; radiation and neutrinos) factories. Theoretically, the particle acceleration mechanisms responsible for blazar emissions and the precise location within the jet where this occurs remain undetermined. This paper explores MM emission driven by magnetic reconnection in a blazar jet. Previous studies have shown that reconnection in the magnetically dominated regions of these relativistic jets can efficiently accelerate particles to very high energies (VHE). Assuming that turbulent-driven magnetic reconnection accelerates cosmic-ray protons and electrons by a Fermi process, we developed a lepto-hadronic radiation model without the influence of external soft-photons to explain the 2017 MM flare from TXS 0506+056. In the proposed scenario, the emission blob moves downstream in the jet from $\sim$2 to 4 pc from the central engine, which is a supermassive black hole (SMBH) of $3 \times 10^{8}$ M$_\odot$ launching a jet with $150L_\mathrm{Edd}$ power. As the blob moves, we observe a sequence of spectral energy distribution (SED) profiles that match the observed arrival of the high energy neutrino and electromagnetic emission from TXS 0506+056. This arrival coincides with the high state of intermediate energy $\gamma$-rays ($E \sim 1 $ GeV) detection, followed by the subsequent appearance of the VHE $\gamma$-ray signal and then no further significant neutrino detection. We obtain a time delay between the neutrino and VHE events $\simeq 6.4$ days, which is consistent with that observed in the 2017 MM flare.

 - **Abstract**
 Thermal nonequilibrium (TNE) is a condition of the plasma in the solar corona in which the local rate of energy loss due to radiation increases to the point that it cannot be sustained by the various heating terms acting on the plasma, precluding the existence of a steady state. The limit cycles of precipitation and evaporation that result from TNE have been simulated in 1D models of coronal loops, as well as 2D and 3D models of the solar chromosphere and lower corona. However, a careful study of TNE in the solar wind has not been performed until now. Here we demonstrate that for suitable combinations of local and global heating rates it is possible for the plasma to exhibit a TNE condition, even in the context of a transonic solar wind with appreciable mass and energy fluxes. This implies limits on the amount of foot-point heating that can be withstood under steady-state conditions in the solar wind, and may help to explain the variability of solar wind streams that emanate from regions of highly concentrated magnetic flux on the solar surface. The implications of this finding pertain to various sources of high-density solar wind, including plumes that form above regions of mixed magnetic polarity in polar coronal holes and the slow solar wind (SSW) that emanates from coronal hole boundaries.
#### Strong magnetic fields of old white dwarfs are symmetric about the stellar rotation axes

 - **Abstract**
 Many magnetic white dwarfs exhibit a polarised spectrum that periodically varies as the star rotates because the magnetic field is not symmetric about the rotation axis. In this work, we report the discovery that while weakly magnetic white dwarfs of all ages with M < 1Mo show polarimetric variability with a period between hours and several days, the large majority of magnetic white dwarfs in the same mass range with cooling ages older than 2 Gyr and field strengths > 10 MG show little or no polarimetric variability. This could be interpreted as extremely slow rotation, but a lack of known white dwarfs with measured periods longer than two weeks means that we do not see white dwarfs slowing their rotation. We therefore suggest a different interpretation: old strongly magnetic white dwarfs do not vary because their fields are roughly symmetric about the rotation axes. Symmetry may either be a consequence of field evolution or a physical characteristic intrinsic to the way strong fields are generated in older stars. Specifically, a strong magnetic field could distort the shape of a star, forcing the principal axis of maximum inertia away from the spin axis. Eventually, as a result of energy dissipation, the magnetic axis will align with the angular momentum axis. We also find that the higher-mass strongly magnetised white dwarfs, which are likely the products of the merging of two white dwarfs, may appear as either polarimetrically variable or constant. This may be the symptom of two different formation channels or the consequence of the fact that a dynamo operating during a merger may produce diverse magnetic configurations. Alternatively, the massive white dwarfs with constant polarisation may be rotating with periods much shorter than the typical exposure times of the observations.

 - **Abstract**
 The characterization of magnetic fields within molecular clouds is fundamental to understanding star formation processes. Accurately gauging the three-dimensional structure of these fields presents a challenge, as observational techniques such as dust polarization and the Zeeman effect each provide only partial information on the orientation and line-of-sight strength, respectively. By analyzing a suite of AREPO simulations, this paper investigates how observables can relate to underlying physical properties to derive a more comprehensive picture of the magnetic field's inclination angle and strength, specifically in regions where both dust polarization and Zeeman data are available. To demonstrate the method, we produce synthetic observations of the polarization angle dispersion and line-of-sight Alfvén Mach Number and explore the behavior of the inclination angle, $\gamma$, and strength of the magnetic field in regions where both Zeeman and dust polarization data are available. We find that dust polarization data can be used to determine the inclination angle if the cloud is known to be trans-Alfvénic or sub-Alfvénic. The strength of the magnetic field relative to turbulence can be estimated by comparing polarization observations to Zeeman observations. Comparing the dispersion of the polarization angle to the estimated line-of-sight Alfvén Mach Number provides clues about the strength of the magnetic field and, consequently, the orientation of the magnetic field.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding of cloud microphysics and the evolution of cloud structures in sub-stellar atmospheres remains a key challenge in the JWST era. The abundance of new JWST data necessitates models that are suitable for coupling with large-scale simulations, such as general circulation models (GCMs), in order to fully understand and assess the complex feedback effects of clouds on the atmosphere, and their influence on observed spectral and variability characteristics. We aim to develop a 2-moment, time-dependent bulk microphysical cloud model that is suitable for GCMs of sub-stellar atmospheres. We derive a set of moment equations for the particle mass distribution and develop a microphysical cloud model employing a 2-moment approach. We include homogeneous nucleation, condensation, and collisional microphysical processes that evolve the moments of a particle size distribution in time. We couple our new 2-moment scheme with the Exo-FMS GCM to simulate the evolution of KCl clouds in a Tint = 400 K, log g = 4.25 Y-dwarf atmosphere and examine the effect of cloud opacity on the atmospheric characteristics. Our results show a generally homogeneous global KCl cloud, with only slight variations occurring in the equatorial regions. The atmosphere is generally sluggish and stagnant, with near-zero vertical velocities throughout most of the atmosphere. Only very small grains ~0.01 um remain lofted in the atmosphere. Our results conform with dynamical theories for this parameter regime, with our model showing minimal (~0.2%) spectral variability at mid-infrared wavelengths. Our study demonstrates that the 2-moment bulk cloud microphysical scheme is a highly suitable method for investigating cloud characteristics and feedback in GCMs and other large scale simulations of sub-stellar atmospheres. Split moment schemes and mixed material grains will be explored in a follow up study.

 - **Abstract**
 We discuss a prediction of the solar activity on a short time-scale applying the method based on a combination of a nonlinear mean-field dynamo model and the artificial neural network. The artificial neural network which serves as a correction scheme for the forecast, uses the currently available observational data (e.g., the 13 month running average of the observed solar sunspot numbers) and the dynamo model output. The nonlinear mean-field $\alpha\,\Omega$ dynamo produces the large-scale magnetic flux which is redistributed by negative effective magnetic pressure instability (NEMPI) producing sunspots and active regions. The nonlinear mean-field dynamo model includes algebraic nonlinearity (caused by the feedback of the growing magnetic field on the plasma motion) and dynamic nonlinearities (related to the dynamics of the magnetic helicity of small-scale magnetic field). We compare the forecast errors with a horizon of 1, 6, 12 and 18 months, for different forecast methods, with the same corrections on the current monthly observations. Our forecast is in good agreement with the observed solar activity, the forecast error is almost stably small over short-medium ranges of forecasting windows. Despite a strong level of chaotic component in the solar magnetic activity we present quantitative evidence that the solar activity on a short range can be stably well predicted, by the joint use of the physically based model with the neural network. This result may have an immediate practical implementation for predictions of various phenomena of solar activity and other astrophysical processes, so may be of interest to a broad community.

 - **Abstract**
 SN 2023adsy, a Type Ia supernova discovered by JWST at z = 2.9, was found to be a peculiar event, being extremely red and faint, but showing very similar rest-frame light curve decline rate to the majority of low-redshift SNe Ia. In this paper we show that the red color and faint peak magnitude could be explained by significant reddening/extinction due to dust in the host galaxy. If host galaxy extinction is accounted for, the parameters of the best-fit light curve templates in the SALT3-NIR model are compatible with a slowly declining, but still normal SN Ia. Comparison of the inferred luminosity distance with the prediction of the LambdaCDM cosmology (assuming H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc and OmegaM = 0.315) on the Hubble-diagram suggests no significant evolution of the SN Ia peak luminosity at z > 2 redshifts. It is also shown that the discovery of a single SN Ia between 2 < z < 3 within the area of the JADES survey during 1 year is consistent with the current estimates for the SN Ia rates at such redshifts.
