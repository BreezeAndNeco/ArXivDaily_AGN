#### Age dependence of Lyα escape fraction of Lyα emitters and their significant role in cosmic reionization
 - **Authors:** Shunta Shimizu, Nobunari Kashikawa, Satoshi Kikuta, Yoshihiro Takeda, Junya Arita, Ryo Emori, Kentaro Koretomo

 - **Abstract**
 We study the Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction, $f_{\mathrm{esc}}^{\mathrm{Ly\alpha}}$ of Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) identified by Subaru/HSC narrowband imaging at $z = 2.2-6.6$, using publicly available deep imaging data from HST and JWST. We perform SED fitting for 127 LAEs at $0.4 - 5.0\, \mathrm{\mu m}$ to estimate their physical properties robustly, and confirm that two distinct LAE populations exist: young LAEs (< 100 Myr) and old LAEs (> 100 Myr). Young LAEs are characterized by burst-like star formation activity and low dust content, significantly differing from Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) at the same stellar mass, while old LAEs show similar star formation activity to LBGs, yet with lower dust content and more compact morphology in rest-UV/optical than LBGs. The $f_{\mathrm{esc}}^{\mathrm{Ly\alpha}}$ of LAEs is anticorrelated with stellar mass, and this correlation is found to depend on the age of LAEs, such that old LAEs show a weaker anticorrelation than young LAEs, and tend to exhibit higher $f_{\mathrm{esc}}^{\mathrm{Ly\alpha}}$ than young LAEs at a given stellar mass. This implies that Ly$\alpha$ photons escape more efficiently from old LAEs, possibly through the low-density channels of HI and dust created by outflows. The average $f_{\mathrm{esc}}^{\mathrm{Ly\alpha}}$ of young LAEs remains nearly constant at $\sim40$% at $z = 2.2-6.6$, suggesting that the previously observed evolution of global $f_{\mathrm{esc}}^{\mathrm{Ly\alpha}}$ of star-forming galaxies (SFGs) is due to the changes in the LAE fraction among the SFGs. Converting $f_{\mathrm{esc}}^{\mathrm{Ly\alpha}}$ to Lyman continuum escape fraction using empirical relations, we demonstrate that LAEs alone can supply the ionizing photons necessary for reionization at $z\sim6$, causing rapid and late reionization.
#### COSMOS2025: The COSMOS-Web galaxy catalog of photometry, morphology, redshifts, and physical parameters from JWST, HST, and ground-based imaging

 - **Abstract**
 We present COSMOS2025, the COSMOS-Web catalog of photometry, morphology, photometric redshifts and physical parameters for more than 700,000 galaxies in the Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS) field. This catalog is based on our \textit{James Webb Space Telescope} 255\,h COSMOS-Web program, which provides deep near-infrared imaging in four NIRCam (F115W, F150W, F277W, F444W) and one MIRI (F770W) filter over the central $\sim 0.54 {\, \rm deg}^2$ ($\sim 0.2 {\, \rm deg}^2$ for MIRI) in COSMOS. These data are combined with ground- and space-based data to derive photometric measurements of NIRCam-detected sources using both fixed-aperture photometry (on the space-based bands) and a profile-fitting technique on all 37 bands spanning 0.3-8 micron. We provide morphology for all sources from complementary techniques including profile fitting and machine-learning classification. We derive photometric redshifts, physical parameters and non-parametric star formation histories from spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting. The catalog has been extensively validated against previous COSMOS catalogs and other surveys. Photometric redshift accuracy measured using spectroscopically confirmed galaxies out to $z\sim9$ reaches $\sigma_{\rm MAD} = 0.012$ at $m_{\rm F444W}<28$ and remains at $\sigma_{\rm MAD} \lesssim 0.03$ as a function of magnitude, color, and galaxy type. This represents a factor of $\sim 2$ improvement at 26 AB mag compared to COSMOS2020. The catalog is approximately 80\% complete at $\log(M_{\star}/{\rm M}_{\odot}) \sim 9$ at $z \sim 10$ and at $\log(M_{\star}/{\rm M}_{\odot}) \sim 7$ at $z \sim 0.2$, representing a gain of 1\,dex compared to COSMOS2020. COSMOS2025 represents the definitive COSMOS-Web catalog. It is provided with complete documentation, together with redshift probability distributions, and it is ready for scientific exploitation today.
#### Cosmic Outliers: Low-Spin Halos Explain the Abundance, Compactness, and Redshift Evolution of the Little Red Dots

 - **Abstract**
 The Little Red Dots (LRDs) are high-redshift galaxies uncovered by JWST, characterized by small effective radii ($R_{\rm eff} \sim 80-300$ pc), number densities intermediate between typical galaxies and quasars, and a redshift distribution peaked at $z \sim 5$. We present a theoretical model in which the LRDs descend from dark matter halos in the extreme low-spin tail of the angular momentum distribution. Within this framework, we explain their three key observational signatures: (i) abundance, (ii) compactness, and (iii) redshift distribution. Our model focuses on observed, not modeled, properties; it is thus independent of whether they are powered primarily by a black hole or stars. We find that the assumption that the prototypical LRD at $z \sim 5$ originates from halos in the lowest $\sim 1\%$ of the spin distribution is sufficient to reproduce both their observed number densities and physical sizes. The redshift evolution of their observability is driven by the interplay between the evolving compact disk fraction and cosmological surface brightness dimming. This effect leads to a well-defined "LRDs Era" at $4<z<8$, during which the LRDs are common and detectable; at $z<4$, they are bright but rare, while at $z>8$, they are common but faint. Finally, we test the predicted redshift trend against observational data, finding excellent agreement. Additional observational support comes from their excess small-scale clustering and spectral signatures of extreme core densities, both of which are expected outcomes of galaxy formation in low-spin halos. These findings suggest that the LRDs are not a fundamentally distinct population but the natural manifestation of galaxies forming in the rarest, lowest angular momentum environments.
#### The Pandora project. II: how non-thermal physics drives bursty star formation and temperate mass-loaded outflows in dwarf galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 Dwarf galaxies provide powerful laboratories for studying galaxy formation physics. Their early assembly, shallow gravitational potentials, and bursty, clustered star formation histories make them especially sensitive to the processes that regulate baryons through multi-phase outflows. Using high-resolution, cosmological zoom-in simulations of a dwarf galaxy from \textit{the Pandora suite}, we explore the impact of stellar radiation, magnetic fields, and cosmic ray feedback on star formation, outflows, and metal retention. We find that our purely hydrodynamical model without non-thermal physics - in which supernova feedback is boosted to reproduce realistic stellar mass assembly - drives violent, overly enriched outflows that suppress the metal content of the host galaxy. Including radiation reduces the clustering of star formation and weakens feedback. However, the additional incorporation of cosmic rays produces fast, mass-loaded, multi-phase outflows consisting of both ionized and neutral gas components, in better agreement with observations. These outflows, which entrain a denser, more temperate ISM, exhibit broad metallicity distributions while preserving metals within the galaxy. Furthermore, the star formation history becomes more bursty, in agreement with recent JWST findings. These results highlight the essential role of non-thermal physics in galaxy evolution and the need to incorporate it in future galaxy formation models.
#### Exploring selection biases in FRB dispersion-galaxy cross-correlations with magnetohydrodynamical simulations

 - **Abstract**
 The dispersion of fast radio bursts (FRBs) in conjunction with their redshifts can be used as powerful probes of the distribution of extragalactic plasma, and with a large enough sample, the free-electron--galaxy power spectrum $P_{eg}$ can be measured by cross-correlating FRB dispersions with galaxy positions. However, a precise measurement of $P_{eg}$ requires a careful investigation of the selection effects -- the fact that the probability of both observing the FRB dispersion measure and obtaining a host galaxy redshift depends on observed properties of the FRB and its host. We use ray tracing simulations with IllustrisTNG300-1 to investigate the impact of expected observational selection effects on FRB dispersion-galaxy angular cross-correlations with a sample of 3000 FRBs at redshift range of $0.3 \leq z \leq 0.4$ . Our results show that cross-correlations with such an FRB sample are robust to properties of the FRB host galaxy: this includes DM contributions from the FRB host and optical followup selection effects biased against FRBs with dim galaxy hosts. We also find that such cross-correlations are robust to DM dependent and scattering selection effects specific to the CHIME/FRB survey. However, a DM dependent selection effect that cuts off the 10\% most dispersed FRB at a fixed redshift shell can bias the amplitude of the cross-correlation signal by over 50\% at angular scales of $\sim 0.1^\circ$ (corresponding to Mpc physical scales). Our findings highlight the importance of both measuring and accounting for selection effects present in existing FRB surveys as well as mitigating DM dependent selection effects in the design of upcoming FRB surveys aiming to use FRBs as probes for large-scale structure.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new 8.5 ks Chandra observation of Abell 1885, obtained as part of the Cluster Evolution Reference Ensemble At Low-z (CEREAL) survey of ~200 low-z galaxy groups and clusters. These data reveal that Abell 1885 is a strong cool core, with a central cooling time of 0.43 Gyr, and that the central galaxy hosts an X-ray luminous point source at its center (L=2.3x10^42 erg/s), indicative of a rapidly accreting supermassive black hole. In the context of the larger CEREAL sample, we constrain the fraction of clusters at z~0.15 with X-ray bright central AGN to be no more than 4.1%. Including radio data from LOFAR, GMRT, ASKAP, and the VLA and optical integral field unit data from SDSS MaNGA, we probe the details of cooling, feeding, and feedback in this system. These data reveal that cooling of the intracluster medium is highly suppressed on large (>10 kpc) scales despite a central supermassive black hole that is in the early stages of the self-regulation cycle (characterized by rapid accretion, physically small jets, and no large-scale low-frequency radio emission). To reconcile the large-scale quenching with a lack of visible large-scale feedback, we propose that the timescale on which energy is dissipated on large scales is significantly longer than the timescale on which black hole feeding operates on small (~pc) scales. These observations suggest that there are two separate timescales characterizing AGN feedback in clusters: the short timescale of small-scale feeding and feedback processes and a longer timescale by which energy is dissipated on large physical scales in the intracluster medium. This interpretation disfavors a model in which the energy is rapidly dissipated (e.g. shocks), which would synchronize the feeding and feedback timescales, and favors a model in which the heating effects of AGN feedback can linger long after the outburst has passed (e.g. turbulent mixing).

 - **Abstract**
 Energetic events on the Sun, particularly coronal mass ejections and high speed streams, regulate the near Earth space environment and give rise to space weather. A major terrestrial manifestation of such events are geomagnetic storms. A geomagnetic storm results in dissipation of energy from the solar wind into the atmosphere, leading to Joule heating and thermospheric expansion. This has serious consequences on Low Earth Orbit satellite lifetimes. Our work demonstrates the impact of different kinds of geomagnetic storms on satellite orbits. We also briefly discuss about some physical attributes of satellites that can make them prone to higher orbital decay. Our work highlights the importance of monitoring and predicting space weather, and assessing their impacts on space-based human technologies.

 - **Abstract**
 The COSMOS-Web survey is the largest JWST Cycle 1 General Observer program covering a contiguous ~0.54 deg$^2$ area with NIRCam imaging in four broad-band filters and a non-contiguous ~0.2 deg$^2$ with parallel MIRI imaging in a single broad-band filter, F770W. Here we present a comprehensive overview of the MIRI imaging observations, the data reduction procedure, the COSMOS-Web MIRI photometric catalog, and the first data release including the entire COSMOS-Web MIRI coverage. Data reduction is predominantly based on the JWST Science Calibration Pipeline with an additional step involving custom background subtraction to mitigate the presence of strong instrumental features and sky background in the MIRI images. We reach 5$\sigma$ (point source) limiting depths ($m_{F770W}$~25.51 based on $r$~0.3'' circular apertures) that are significantly better than initial expectations. We create a COSMOS-Web MIRI catalog based on the images presented in this release and compare the F770W flux densities with the Spitzer/IRAC CH4 measurements from the COSMOS2020 catalog for CH4 detections with S/N $>5$. We find that these are in reasonable agreement with a small median offset of $<0.05$ mag. We also derive robust 7.7$\mu$m number counts spanning five orders of magnitude in flux ($\sim$0.2-2300 $\mu$Jy) $\unicode{x2013}$ making COSMOS-Web the only JWST survey to date to efficiently sample such a large flux range $\unicode{x2013}$ which is in good agreement with estimates from other JWST and IRAC surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on a pencil-beam survey of the Taurid Swarm, a possible concentration of bodies in the Taurid meteoroid stream associated with the 7:2 mean-motion resonance with Jupiter. Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope MegaCam observations reaching apparent magnitudes of 24.5 in the gri filter were taken over three nights. Rates of motion on the sky allowed for the quick elimination of main-belt objects from the over 1000 moving sources seen. Eight candidates with on-sky rates of motion consistent with Taurids were detected, but seven were subsequently shown to be non-Taurids (Hungarias, Mars-crossers, etc). One object might be a 60 m class Taurid but not enough data was collected and its orbit remains ambiguous. Our results are consistent with no Taurid Swarm members observed, and an upper limit of fewer than 3e3 - 3e4 objects down to H=25.6 +/- 0.3 (diameter of 34-76 m assuming a 2P/Encke-like albedo) at the 95% confidence level. While meteor observations have confirmed the Taurid Swarm's existence at meter and smaller sizes, our results indicate that the current mass budget of the swarm at 100 m sizes does not require an outsize parent to explain it.
#### The galaxy-AGN scaling relations over 13 billion years in SHARK v2.0 (I): SMBH masses

 - **Abstract**
 The presence of strong correlations between super-massive black hole (SMBH) masses and galaxy properties like stellar mass have been well-established in the local Universe, but how these scaling relations evolve with cosmic time is yet to be settled in both observations and theoretical models. Recent works have also highlighted the role of galaxy morphology on the scatter of the SMBH-galaxy mass scaling relations, while the impact of other galaxy properties remains poorly studied, like the role of galaxy environment. We use the state-of-the-art SHARK v2.0 semi-analytic model to explore the evolution of these galaxy-SMBH scaling relations to expand the available predictions from theoretical models to contrast with existing and upcoming observations. We find the relations between SMBH masses and both total and bulge stellar mass predicted by SHARK v2.0 to be in good overall agreement with observational measurements across a wide range of redshift and stellar masses. These scaling relations show a significant evolution as a function of cosmic time in SHARK v2.0, with SMBH masses $\sim1$ dex lower at $z=0$ compared to $z=9$ at fixed stellar mass and the scatter increasing by a factor of $\sim2-5$ towards low redshift. Both relations show a strong dependence with galaxy morphology and the main source for SMBH growth (gas accretion or mergers), with smaller trends with star formation rate, galaxy sizes, and environment. We find that galaxy morphology alone explains most of the scatter around both scaling relations, with other galaxy properties tying to the SMBH scaling relations through their correlations with morphology.
#### Lens based Kinetic Inductance Detectors with Distributed Dual Polarised Absorbers for Far Infra-red Space-based Astronomy

 - **Abstract**
 Future space-based far infra-red astronomical observations require background limited detector sensitivities and scalable focal plane array solutions to realise their vast potential in observation speed. In this work, a focal plane array of lens absorber coupled Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KIDs) is proposed to fill this role. The figures of merit and design guidelines for the proposed detector concept are derived by employing a previously developed electromagnetic spectral modelling technique. Two designs operating at central frequencies of $6.98$ and $12$ THz are studied. A prototype array of the former is fabricated, and its performance is experimentally determined and validated. Specifically, the optical coupling of the detectors to incoherent distributed sources (i.e. normalised throughput) is quantified experimentally with good agreement with the estimations provided by the model. The coupling of the lens absorber prototypes to an incident plane wave, i.e. aperture efficiency, is also indirectly validated experimentally matching the expected value of $54\%$ averaged over two polarisation. The noise equivalent power of the KIDs are also measured with limiting value of $8\times10^{-20}$ $\mathrm{W/\sqrt{Hz}}$.
#### Germanium Atomic Compton Scattering Measurements and ${ab}$ ${initio}$ Many-Body Calculations: Implications for Electronic recoil Dark Matter Detection

 - **Abstract**
 Diverse searches for direct dark matter (DM) in effective electromagnetic and leptophilic interactions resulting from new physics, as well as Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) with unconventional electronic recoils, are intensively pursued. Low-energy backgrounds from radioactive $\gamma$ rays via Compton scattering and photon coherent scattering are unavoidable in terrestrial detectors. The interpretation of dark matter experimental data is dependent on a better knowledge of the background in the low-energy region. We provide a 2.3% measurement of atomic Compton scattering in the low momentum transfer range of 180 eV/c to 25 keV/c, using a 10-g germanium detector bombarded by a $^{137}\mathrm{Cs}$ source with a 7.2 m-Curie radioactivity and the scatter photon collected by a cylindrical NaI[Tl] detector. The ability to detect Compton scattering's doubly differential cross section (DDCS) gives a special test for clearly identifying the kinematic restraints in atomic many-body systems, notably the Livermore model. Additionally, a low-energy-background comparison is made between coherent photon scattering and Compton scattering replacing the scattering function of ${GEANT4}$@software, which uses a completely relativistic impulse approximation (RIA) together with Multi-Configuration Dirac-Fock (MCDF) wavefunctions. For the purpose of investigating sub-GeV mass and electronic-recoil dark matter theories, signatures including low energy backgrounds via high energy $\gamma$ rays in germanium targets are discussed.
#### Changing Look AGN: A study of Optical/UV and the Highly Ionized Fe K$α$ X-ray Line Flux Variations Using Photo-Ionization Simulations

 - **Abstract**
 Significant variability in broad emission line strengths of active galactic nuclei (AGN) over months to years has been observed, often accompanied by intrinsic continuum changes. Such spectral variability challenges the traditional AGN classification scheme, which attributes differences between Type 1 and Type 2 to geometrical effects, as transitions between these types occur on timescales shorter than viscous ones. In this work, using the {\sc cloudy} photo-ionization simulations, we investigated the response of the major emission line fluxes, in the optical/UV and hard X-ray bands, to changes in the intensity and shape of the continuum emission of the AGN under two scenarios: (i) changes in the X-ray power-law while keeping disc emission fixed, and (ii) broadband continuum variations. We demonstrate that BLR line fluxes are insensitive to X-ray power-law changes alone. Considering a well-studied case of the changing-look (CL) AGN Mrk 1018, which exhibits variations in the intrinsic disc emission, as well as the X-ray power-law, our simulations reproduce observed brightening and dimming trends of the BLR emission. Moreover, we show that the highly ionized Fe K$\alpha$ X-ray flux, primarily produced by the H-like and He-like ions of Fe, strongly depends on the X-ray strength of the intrinsic SED. These findings suggest that the origin of highly ionized Fe K$\alpha$ emission is in the coronal part of the accretion disk and that the CL phenomenon can be triggered by intrinsic changes in the accretion properties of AGN.

 - **Abstract**
 Core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are regularly observed electromagnetically, prompting targetted searches for their gravitational-wave emission. However, there are scenarios where these powerful explosions may not have any observable electromagnetic signal, but would still have strong detectable emission in gravitational waves and neutrinos. A regular CCSN explosion may be obscured by matter in the Galaxy. A star may undergo a failed CCSN explosion, where the stalled shockwave is not revived, and would eventually form a black hole. Higher mass progenitor stars may revive the shock, but form a black hole too quickly for the shockwave to reach the surface of the star and produce an electromagnetic signal. Previous work has shown that we can determine if a black hole forms from the CCSN neutrino emission if there are long duration sinusoidal modulations in the neutrino signal caused by the standing accretion shock instability (SASI). The SASI also produces an observable signature in the gravitational-wave emission. In this paper, we investigate if we can distinguish between different scenarios for electromagnetically dark CCSNe using the gravitational-wave emission alone. We find, using a reconstruction of the SASI mode, abrupt end times of the gravitational-wave emission, and the rate of change of frequency of the dominant mode, that we are able to accurately distinguish between an obscured CCSN, a failed CCSN, and an explosion with fast black hole formation.
#### X-ray spectroscopy method of white dwarf mass determination in intermediate polars. External systematic uncertainties

 - **Abstract**
 The masses of white dwarfs (WDs) in intermediate polars (IPs) can be determined from the shape of their hard X-ray spectra. Here we study the importance of all possible systematic uncertainties in this X-ray spectroscopy method, including finite radii and rotation of magnetospheres, finite accretion column height and accretion-flow inclination relative to the WD surface. We also investigate the importance of accretion-heated envelopes on WD surfaces in IPs which are increasing WD radii. Their presence changes the commonly used mass-radius relation for cold white dwarfs. As a first approximation we use thick ($10^{-4}M_\odot$) hydrogen envelope models with a surface temperature of 30 kK. We present a new model grid of hard X-ray spectra of high-luminous IPs computed among other things with using a new mass-radius relation. This grid is used for fitting Swift/BAT spectra of 47 IPs. The average WD mass in this sample is 0.82 $M_\odot$ and coincides with the average WD mass in cataclysmic variables obtained by optical methods. This means that the calculated hard X-ray spectra and the assumptions made that the magnetospheric radii in IPs are close to the corotation radii, and the relative heights of the accretion columns are small are basically correct, because most IPs have high luminosities. But this universal grid (as well as previous universal grids) cannot give correct results for the low-luminous IPs with probably relatively tall accretion columns on the WD surfaces.

 We present in this proceeding the results of the test phase of the GRAVITY+ adaptive optics. This extreme AO will enable both high-dynamic range observations of faint companions (including exoplanets) thanks to a 40x40 sub-apertures wavefront control, and sensitive observations (including AGNs) thanks to the addition of a laser guide star to each UT of the VLT. This leap forward is made thanks to a mostly automated setup of the AO, including calibration of the NCPAs, that we tested in Europe on the UT+atmosphere simulator we built in Nice. We managed to reproduce in laboratory the expected performances of all the modes of the AO, including under non-optimal atmospheric or telescope alignment conditions, giving us the green light to proceed with the Assembly, Integration and Verification phase in Paranal.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic rays (CRs) are an integral part of the non-thermal pressure budget in the interstellar medium (ISM) and are the leading-order ionization mechanism in cold molecular clouds. We study the impacts that different microphysical CR diffusion coefficients and streaming speeds have on the evolution of isothermal, magnetized, turbulent plasmas, relevant to the cold ISM. We utilized a two-moment CR magnetohydrodynamic (CRMHD) model, allowing us to dynamically evolve both CR energy and flux densities with contributions from Alfvénic streaming and anisotropic diffusion. We identify $\textit{coupled}$ and $\textit{decoupled}$ regimes, and define dimensionless Prandtl numbers $\rm{Pm_c}$ and $\rm{Pm_s}$, which quantify whether the plasma falls within these two regimes. In the coupled regime -- characteristic of slow streaming ($\rm{Pm_s} < 1$) and low diffusion ($\rm{Pm_c} < 1$) -- the CR fluid imprints upon the plasma a mixed equation of state between $P_{\rm{c}} \propto \rho^{4/3}$ (relativistic fluid) and $P_{\rm{c}} \propto \rho^{2/3}$ (streaming), where $P_{\rm{c}}$ is the CR pressure, and $\rho$ is the plasma density. By modifying the sound speed, the coupling reduces the turbulent Mach number, and hence the amplitude of the density fluctuations, whilst supporting secular heating of the CR fluid. In contrast, in the decoupled regime ($\rm{Pm_s} > 1$ or $\rm{Pm_c} > 1$) the CR fluid and the plasma have negligible interactions. We further show that CR heating is enabled by coherent structures within the compressible velocity field, with no impact on the turbulence spectrum of incompressible modes.

 - **Abstract**
 We have developed a novel methodology utilizing molecular dynamics simulations to evaluate the ionization yields of nuclear recoils in crystalline silicon. This approach enables analytical exploration of atomic-scale transport within the lattice without necessitating parameterization. The quenching factors across the nuclear recoil energy range from 20 eV to 10 keV have been thoroughly investigated. A remarkable agreement with experimental data is achieved, particularly for the minimal energy regime conducted to date, reaching the level of a single electron-hole pair. This work presents evidence of a crucial and fundamental distribution of the quenching factor, which can be associated to the collisional interactions underlying the transport phenomena. The region below 4 keV of the quenching factor, where discrepancies have been observed with the Lindhard's model, is found to be significantly attributed to the lattice binding effect and the specific crystal structure. In contrast, a gradual functional relationship is identified below approximately 100 eV, indicating that the quenching factor is influenced by the crystallographic orientation of the target material. From a distributional perspective, our analysis allows for the determination of the minimum exclusion mass for the dark matter nucleon elastic scattering channel at 0.29 $\mathrm{GeV}/c^2$, thereby significantly enhancing sensitivity for the sub-$\mathrm{GeV}/c^2$ mass region.

 - **Abstract**
 Quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) are a common feature of impulsive solar flare emissions, yet their driving mechanism(s) remain unresolved. We study long-period (3.4 min) QPPs in the M3.7 flare on Feb 24, 2023, using SDO/AIA and Solar Orbiter/STIX to pinpoint their source and driver. We analyzed UV and HXR emissions from four subregions covering the flare ribbons and footpoints of the erupting filament. We find the QPP characteristics varied significantly across these regions. The strongest UV pulsations, which correlated strongly with HXR emissions, originated from a sequence of flare kernels at the expanding front of the southern flare ribbon. In contrast, another expanding ribbon front showed no pulsations. The spatial coincidence of UV and HXR sources points to non-thermal electrons as a common driver, with the HXR spectrum showing a soft-hard-soft evolution matching the pulsation timescale. We also observed UV pulsations from plasma injections into a separate filament channel, distinct from the main flare kernels. Our results suggest that the spatiotemporal evolution of the pulsations is driven by the propagation of magnetic reconnection in an asymmetric geometry. We propose that slipping reconnection along quasi-separatrix layers is key to generating and moving the UV kernels, potentially modulated by another time-varying process.

 - **Abstract**
 Relativistic jets from AGN are an important driver of feedback in galaxies. They interact with their environments over a wide range of physical scales during their lifetime, and an understanding of these interactions is crucial for unraveling the role of supermassive blackholes in shaping galaxy evolution. The impact of such jets have been traditionally considered in the context of heating the large-scale environments. However, in the last few decades there has been additional focus on the immediate impact of jet feedback on the host galaxy itself. In this review we outline the development of various numerical simulations since the onset of studies of jets to the present day, where sophisticated numerical techniques have been employed to study jet feedback including a range of physical processes. The jets can act as an important agent of injecting energy in the host's ISM, as confirmed both in observations of multi-phase gas, as well as in simulations. Such interactions have the potential to impact the kinematics of the gas as well as its star formation. We summarize the recent results from simulations of jet feedback on kpc scales, and outline the broader implications for observations and galaxy evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 We use analytical and $N$-body methods to study the evolution of dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) embedded in dark matter (DM) haloes that host a sizeable subhalo population. Dark subhaloes generate a fluctuating gravitational field that injects energy into stellar orbits, driving a gradual expansion of dSphs. Despite the overall expansion, the stellar density profile preserves its initial shape, suggesting that the evolution proceeds in a self-similar manner. Meanwhile, the velocity dispersion profile, initially flat, evolves as the galaxy expands: the inner regions heat up, while the outer regions cool down. Kinematically, this resembles gravothermal collapse but with an inverted evolution, instead of collapsing the stellar system expands within a fluctuating halo potential. As the half-light radius $r_{\rm half}$ approaches the halo peak velocity radius $r_{\rm max}$, the expansion slows, and the velocity dispersion peaks at $\sigma_{\rm max} \simeq 0.27 v_{\rm max}$. The stellar heat capacity remains positive for deeply embedded stars but diverges near $r_{\rm max}$, turning negative beyond this threshold, which indicates a phase transition in the dynamical response to energy injection. The relaxation time scales as $t_{\rm rel} \sim r_{\rm half}^{3/2}$, showing that orbital diffusion slows as the galaxy expands. Ultra-faint dSphs, having the smallest sizes and shortest relaxation times, are particularly sensitive to the presence of dark subhaloes. Some of our dSph models expand beyond the detection of current photometric surveys, becoming `stealth' galaxies with half-light radii and velocity dispersions similar to ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs), but orders of magnitude lower luminosities, representing a distinct, yet currently undetected, population of DM-dominated satellites.

 - **Abstract**
 It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, . . . - for the thermal/suprathermal particle populations in the vicinity of two traveling interplanetary shocks observed by Solar Orbiter on 2023-11-29 07:51:17 UTC and 2023-11-30 10:47:26 UTC at $\sim 0.83$ astronomical units from the Sun. We investigate these two very dissimilar shocks and elucidate their non-equilibrium features. We do not provide explanations of all observed features, our aim is to report them here for future reference. We use high-resolution data obtained with Solar Orbiter's Energetic Particle Detector (EPD), magnetometer (MAG), and Solar Wind Analyzer (SWA) to exhibit the very different natures of these two shocks and describe the detailed properties of suprathermal and energetic particles in their vicinity. We observe very different behavior of the energetic particle population because the two shocks are quite different. Solar wind protons and $\alpha$-particles are highly dynamic at the first, their beams appear to align well with rapid oscillations of the interplanetary magnetic field. Suprathermal particles associated with the second shock exhibit clear non-equilibrium and anisotropic features in their differential intensities at time scales comparable to the proton gyroperiod. The different geometries of the two shocks resulted in highly dissimilar populations of suprathermal and energetic particles in their vicinity. The first shock was associated with very interesting microphysics of the bulk plasma velocity distribution, the second resulted in similarly interesting microphysics of the accelerated particles. Both showed strong temporal variability of the particle populations at scales comparable to the proton gyroperiod.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of a relativistic jet in Mrk~110, a narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy historically classified as a radio-quiet active galactic nucleus (AGN). Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations reveal intermittent jet activity during 2015--2016 and 2022--2024, with proper motion measurements yielding superluminal velocities of $\sim3.6\pm0.6\,c$ and $\sim2.1\pm0.2\,c$, respectively. The recent jet component decelerates to $\sim 1.5\pm0.2\,c$ at a projected distance of 1.1 parsec from the core, coinciding with the transition zone between broad-line and narrow-line regions. This deceleration accompanies dramatic spectral evolution from steep (the spectral index $\alpha \approx -0.63 \pm 0.04$) to inverted ($\alpha \approx +0.69 \pm 0.10$) as the 7.6 GHz flux density more than doubled. These episodic jet ejections and their evolutionary pattern match theoretical predictions from magnetically arrested disk (MAD) models for temporary jet formation in systems with Mrk 110's physical parameters on timescales of months to years. The observed jet deceleration distance matches expectations for relativistic outflows interacting with the circumnuclear environment. These findings demonstrate that the traditional radio-loud/quiet AGN dichotomy may reflect time-averaged states rather than intrinsic capabilities, suggesting that jets may form across the AGN population but become observable only during specific accretion phases when MAD conditions are temporarily established. Mrk 110 serves as a critical "missing link" between radio-loud and radio-quiet AGN, providing insight into jet formation mechanisms, environmental interactions, and physical processes that unify various AGN classifications.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) reveal a previously unseen population of compact red objects, known as ``little red dots`` (LRDs). We study a new photometrically selected sample of 124 LRDs in the redshift range $z$ $\sim$ 3 - 10 selected from NIRCam coverage of the CEERS, NEP-TDF, JADES and JEMS surveys. For JADES, the NEP-TDF and CEERS, we compare SED models with and without AGN components and analyse the impact of an AGN component on the goodness of fit using the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). We find that whilst the $\chi^{2}$ of the majority of models containing AGN components is improved compared to models without AGN components, we show that the BIC suggests models without AGN are a more appropriate fit to LRD SEDs, especially when MIRI data is available. We also measure LRD clustering in the CEERS field, JADES field, and NEP-TDF, where we compare the spatial distribution of LRDs and galaxies with Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests of equality of distribution. We find that the neighbourhood of LRDs tends to be less dense compared to galaxies at all selections and masses and at similar redshifts. We further measure upper limit estimates for the halo masses of LRDs using abundance matching. Whilst the population of LRDs could be a mixture of several different inherent populations, as a whole it does appear that these systems are mostly hosting compact galaxies or star clusters in formation.

 - **Abstract**
 The timing analysis of transient events allows for investigating numerous still open areas of modern astrophysics. The article explores all the mathematical and physical tools required to estimate delays and associated errors between two Times of Arrival (ToA) lists, by exploiting Cross Correlation Function (CCF) techniques. The CCF permits the establishment of the delay between two observed signals and is defined on two continuous functions. A detector does not directly measure the intensity of the electromagnetic signal (interacting with its material) but rather detects each photon ToA through a probabilistic process. Since the CCF is defined on continuous functions, the crucial step is to obtain a continuous rate curve from a list of ToA. This step is treated in the article and the constructed rate functions are light curves that are continuous functions. This allows, in principle, the estimation of delays with any desired resolution. Due to the statistical nature of the measurement process, two independent detections of the same signal yield different photon times. Consequently, light curves derived from these lists differ due to Poisson fluctuations, leading the CCF between them to fluctuate around the true theoretical delay. This article describes a Monte Carlo technique that enables reliable delay estimation by providing a robust measure of the uncertainties induced by Poissonian fluctuations. GRB data are considered as they offer optimal test cases for the proposed techniques. The developed techniques provides a significant computational advantage and are useful analyzing of data characterized by low-count statistics (i.e., low photon count rates in c/s), as they allow overcoming the limitations associated with traditional fixed bin-size methods.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive study of the structural evolution of Brightest Group Galaxies (BGGs) from redshift $z \simeq 0.08$ to $z = 3.7$ using the \textit{James Webb Space Telescope}'s 255h COSMOS-Web program. This survey provides deep NIRCam imaging in four filters (F115W, F150W, F277W, F444W) across $\sim 0.54~\mathrm{deg}^2$ and MIRI coverage in $\sim 0.2~\mathrm{deg}^2$ of the COSMOS field. High-resolution NIRCam imaging enables robust size and morphological measurements, while multiwavelength photometry yields stellar masses, SFRs, and Sérsic parameters. We classify BGGs as star-forming and quiescent using both rest-frame NUV--$r$--$J$ colors and a redshift-dependent specific star formation rate (sSFR) threshold. Our analysis reveals: (1) quiescent BGGs are systematically more compact than their star-forming counterparts and exhibit steeper size--mass slopes; (2) effective radii evolve as $R_e \propto (1+z)^{-\alpha}$, with $\alpha = 1.11 \pm 0.07$ (star-forming) and $1.40 \pm 0.09$ (quiescent); (3) star formation surface density ($\Sigma_{\mathrm{SFR}}$) increases with redshift and shows stronger evolution for massive BGGs ($\log_{10}(M_\ast/M_\odot) \geq 10.75$); (4) in the $\Sigma_e$--sSFR plane, a structural transition marks the quenching process, with bulge-dominated systems comprising over 80\% of the quiescent population. These results highlight the co-evolution of structure and star formation in BGGs, shaped by both internal and environmental processes, and establish BGGs as critical laboratories for studying the baryonic assembly and morphological transformation of central galaxies in group-scale halos.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the HI distribution, kinematics, mass modeling, and disk stability of the dwarf irregular galaxies ESO444-G084 and [KKS2000]23 using high-resolution, high-sensitivity MHONGOOSE survey data from MeerKAT. ESO444-G084 shows centrally concentrated HI emission, while [KKS2000]23 exhibits irregular high-density clumps. Total HI fluxes measured down to 10^19 and 10^18 cm^-2 are nearly identical, indicating that the increased HI diameter at lower column densities results mainly from the larger beam, with no significant extra emission detected. We derive total HI masses of (1.1 +/- 0.1) x 10^8 and (6.1 +/- 0.3) x 10^8 solar masses for ESO444-G084 and [KKS2000]23, respectively. Using PyFAT and TiRiFiC, we extract 3D rotation curves that reveal disk-like kinematics in both galaxies. ESO444-G084 shows a warp beyond ~1.8 kpc and a fast-rising curve consistent with a centrally concentrated dark matter distribution, while [KKS2000]23's more gradual rise suggests a more extended halo. Mass modeling with an isothermal halo and stellar mass-to-light ratios of 0.20 for ESO444-G084 and 0.18 for [KKS2000]23 yields consistent results. We analyze disk stability using spatially resolved Toomre Q and gas-to-critical surface density ratios, linking these with H-alpha and FUV-based star formation. ESO444-G084 supports localized star formation despite global stability, while [KKS2000]23 appears gravitationally unstable yet lacks H-alpha, suggesting that turbulence, gas depletion, or past feedback suppresses star formation. No inflows or outflows are detected, indicating internal processes regulate star formation. This study highlights the interplay between HI morphology, kinematics, dark matter distribution, and disk stability, showing how internal processes shape dwarf galaxy evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 The Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) onboard the Neil Gehrels Swift observatory has been serving as a survey instrument for the hard X-ray sky, and has detected thousands of X-ray sources (e.g., AGNs, X-ray binaries, etc). BAT monitors these X-ray sources and follows their light curves on time scales from minutes to years. In addition, BAT discovers hundreds of new X-ray sources in survey images stacked throughout the mission lifetime. We present the updated BAT survey catalog since the last published BAT 105 month survey catalog (Oh et al. 2018) with additional of 4.5 years of data until December 2017. Data since 2007 are reprocessed to include updated instrumental calibration. Analysis in this study shows that additional systematic noise can be seen in the 157-month mosaic images, resulting in decreases in the expected improvement in sensitivity and the number of new detections. The BAT 157-month survey reaches a sensitivity of $8.83 \times 10^{-12} \rm \ erg \ s^{-1} \ cm^{-2}$ for 90\% of the sky and $6.44 \times 10^{-12} \rm \ erg \ s^{-1} \ cm^{-2}$ for 10\% of the sky. This catalog includes spectra, monthly and snapshot light curves in eight energy bands (14-20, 20-24, 24-35, 35-50, 50-75, 75-100, 100-150, and 150-195 keV) for 1888 sources, including 256 new detections above the detection threshold of $4.8\sigma$. The light curves, spectra, and tables that summarize the information of the detected-sources are available in the online journal and in the catalog web page this https URL.

 - **Abstract**
 High-redshift ($z>2$) massive quiescent galaxies are crucial tests of early galaxy formation and evolutionary mechanisms through their cosmic number densities and stellar mass functions (SMFs). We explore a sample of 745 massive ($\rm M_*> 10^{9.5}M_\odot$) quiescent galaxies from $z=2-7$ in over 800 arcmin$^2$ of NIRCam imaging from a compilation of public JWST fields (with a total area $>$ 5 $\times$ previous JWST studies). We compute and report their cosmic number densities, stellar mass functions, and cosmic stellar mass density. We confirm a significant overabundance of massive quiescent galaxies relative to a range of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations and semi-analytic models (SAMs). We find that one SAM, SHARK is able to reproduce our observed number density with the addition of mock observational errors, but that it is still unable to produce quiescent galaxies of the same masses. We find that no simulations or SAMs accurately reproduce the SMF for massive quiescent galaxies at any redshift within the interval $z=2-5$. This shows that none of these models' feedback prescriptions are fully capturing high-z galaxy quenching, challenging the standard formation scenarios. We find a greater abundance of lower-mass ($\rm M_*<10^{10}M_\odot$) quiescent galaxies than previously found, highlighting the importance of sSFR cuts rather than simple colour selection. We show the importance of this selection bias, alongside individual field-to-field variations caused by cosmic variance, in varying the observed quiescent galaxy SMF, especially at higher-z. We also find a steeper increase in the cosmic stellar mass density for massive quiescent galaxies than has been seen previously, with an increase of around a factor of 60 from $z=4.5$ to $z=2$, indicating the increasing importance of galaxy quenching within these epochs.

 - **Abstract**
 The COSMOS-Web survey, with its unparalleled combination of multiband data -- particularly near-infrared imaging from JWST's NIRCam (F115W, F150W, F277W, and F444W), provides a transformative dataset reaching down to approximately 28th magnitude (F444W) for studying galaxy evolution. In this work, we employ Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), an unsupervised machine learning method, to estimate key physical parameters of galaxies, redshift, stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), specific SFR (sSFR), and age, directly from photometric data out to redshift $z = 3.5$. SOMs efficiently project high-dimensional galaxy color information onto two-dimensional maps, revealing how physical properties vary among galaxies with similar spectral energy this http URL first validate our approach using mock galaxy catalogs from the HORIZON-AGN simulation, where the SOM accurately recovers the true parameters, demonstrating its robustness. Applying the method to COSMOS-Web observations, we find that the SOM delivers reliable estimates despite the increased complexity of real galaxy populations. Performance metrics (NMAD and RMSE typically between 0.1 and 0.3) confirm the method's precision, with about 70\% of predictions falling within one standard deviation (dex) of the reference values. While redshift estimation in COSMOS-Web presents challenges (median NMAD = 0.05), the overall success of the SOM highlights its potential as a powerful and interpretable tool for galaxy parameter estimation.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast magnetosonic waves are one of the two low-frequency plasma modes that can exist in a neutron star magnetosphere. It was recently realized that these waves may become nonlinear within the magnetosphere and steepen into some of the strongest shocks in the universe. These shocks, when in the appropriate parameter regime, may emit GHz radiation in the form of precursor waves. We present the first global Particle-in-Cell simulations of the nonlinear steepening of fast magnetosonic waves in a dipolar magnetosphere, and quantitatively demonstrate the strong plasma acceleration in the upstream of these shocks. In these simulations, we observe the production of precursor waves in a finite angular range. Using analytic scaling relations, we predict the expected frequency, power, and duration of this emission. Within a reasonable range of progenitor wave parameters, these precursor waves can reproduce many aspects of FRB observations.

 - **Abstract**
 The distribution of baryons in the Universe remains a fundamental open question in astronomy, and the dispersion measure (DM) of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) serves as a valuable tool for probing this cosmic gas. We investigate the impact of the foreground cosmic web on FRB DMs using 61 localized FRBs and public galaxy catalogs. We test for the large-scale structure's impact on cosmological DM using two methods. First, we searched for a correlation between galaxy number density along the line of sight and extragalactic DM, and found a statistically significant positive correlation ($p$ = $1.76 \times 10^{-5}$). The shape of this correlation contains information about the cosmic baryon distribution, and can also be used to better constrain host galaxy DM by providing an estimate of the cosmic contribution on a per-source basis. We observe similar correlations in a mock FRB survey based on the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulation, where the DM is dominated by filaments in the IGM and not by halos. Next, we performed a stacking analysis that measures the average excess DM as a function of impact parameter of foreground galaxies to obtain spatial information about how ionized gas is distributed around galaxy halos. We report excess DM in the stacked signal for impact parameters up to Mpc scales ($\sim$3$\sigma$). Finally, we identified FRBs that do not appear to intersect intervening halos within $r_{vir}$, allowing us to estimate the fraction of baryons that reside in the IGM. We find $f_{\mathrm{IGM}} \geq 0.69$ at 95$\%$ confidence, indicating significant astrophysical feedback.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational lensing of gravitational waves (GWs) offers a novel observational channel that complements traditional electromagnetic approaches and provides unique insights into the astrophysical environments of GW sources. In this work, we investigate the repeated lensing of continuous gravitational wave (CW) sources in active galactic nucleus (AGN) disks by central supermassive black holes (SMBHs), focusing on the imprint of SMBH spin via the Lense-Thirring (LT) effect. Although typically weak and challenging to observe, the spin-induced precession of source orbits can accumulate over time, thereby modulating the lensing geometry. Such modulations influence the magnification, duration, and waveform structure of each repeated lensing event, and enhance the overall probability of lensing occurrences. Using matched filtering, we demonstrate that spin-dependent signatures may be detectable, suggesting that lensed CW signals could serve as an indirect probe of SMBH spin in AGNs.

 - **Abstract**
 This work presents a global solution for the internal and the external field of an axisymmetric rotating neutron star. It is shown that the twist of the internal field affects the external field, by increasing the number of open field lines and eventually the spin-down rate of the star. This effect is far more drastic if the toroidal field, and consequently the poloidal current flowing within the star, is allowed to populate the closed field lines of the magnetosphere, rather than if it remains confined in the star. We further remark that the internal field structure depends on the presence of a twisted magnetosphere: if the twist current is not allowed to flow in the magnetosphere it only occupied a narrow toroid at the interior of the star, whereas if the twist currents are allowed to flow in the magnetosphere the internal toroidal field may occupy a significant volume of the stellar interior. Strong magnetospheric currents may also impact the emission mechanisms, and lead to fluctuations in magnetar spin-down rates, moding and nulling of pulsars, a correlation between angular shear and twist, and the general morphology of the pulsar magnetic field leading to various observational manifestations. The magnetospheric toroidal fields may possibly dissipate, thus the system may switch from global twist to internal twist and consequently exhibit transient behavior.

 - **Abstract**
 Systematic abundance differences that depend on the condensation temperatures of elements have been observed, in particular for stars similar to the Sun; solar twins and solar analogs. Similar differences have also recently been shown to exist between solar abundances and abundances of refractory elements in primitive chondrites. Numerous mechanisms have been proposed to account for these effects, including also differences observed in binary systems. Rather than relying on specific mechanisms, this paper aims to show that the observed effects are a natural and unavoidable outcome of the star formation process itself, in which the associated outflows (winds and jets) carry away material, with efficiency varying with condensation temperature. By using analysis based on modeling results and scaling laws, the trends and magnitudes of the effects are investigated, in three contexts: 1) with respect to differences between the Sun and solar twins, 2) with respect to differences between the Sun and CI-chondrites, and 3) with respect to differences between members of binaries. It is shown that protoplanetary disk outflows indeed are expected to have differential abundance effects, with trends and magnitudes consistent with observed abundance effects. The qualitative as well as semi-quantitative character of the effects are reproduced, in all three contexts. The results demonstrate that the observed systematic differences are likely results of the disk outflows associated with the accretion process. In contrast to mechanisms relying on the tiny mass of planets leaving an observable signature, outflows carry away masses similar to the entire mass of the star, thus much more easily resulting in differential effects with the magnitudes observed, without for example having to assume that the abundance differences are limited to the convection zones of the stars.

 - **Abstract**
 The upcoming Vera Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will dramatically increase the number of strong gravitational lensing systems, requiring precise modeling of line-of-sight (LOS) effects to mitigate biases in lensing observations and cosmological inferences. We develop a method to construct joint distributions of external convergence ($\kappa_{\mathrm{ext}}$) and shear ($\gamma_{\mathrm{ext}}$) for strong lensing LOS by aggregating large-scale structure simulations with high-resolution halo renderings and non-linear correction. Our approach captures both smooth background matter and perturbations from halos, enabling accurate modeling of LOS effects. We apply non-linear LOS corrections to $\kappa_{\mathrm{ext}}$ and $\gamma_{\mathrm{ext}}$ that address the non-additive lensing effects caused by objects along the LOS in strong lensing. We find that, with a minimum image separation of $1.0^{\prime\prime}$, non-linear LOS correction due to the presence of a dominant deflector slightly increases the ratio of quadruple to double lenses; this non-linear LOS correction also introduces systematic biases of $\sim 0.1\%$ for galaxy-AGN lenses in the inferred Hubble constant ($H_0$) if not accounted for. We also observe a $0.66\%$ bias for galaxy-galaxy lenses on $H_0$, and even larger biases up to $1.02\%$ for galaxy-AGN systems if LOS effects are not accounted for. These results highlight the importance of LOS for precision cosmology. The publicly available code and datasets provide tools for incorporating LOS effects in future analyses.

 - **Abstract**
 Efficient turbulent acceleration of particles is indicated by recent astrophysical observations, but its mechanism is not well understood. Mirror acceleration has recently been proposed as an efficient mechanism for particle energization in turbulence-compressed magnetic fields. We employ a 3D particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation of pair plasma in magnetized and relativistic turbulence to study this new mechanism and its acceleration efficiency. By tracking individual particles, we see that reversal of a particle's moving direction and significant energy gain can happen during one mirror interaction and within one gyro-orbit. As expected for mirror acceleration, we statistically find that (1) energy gain is preferentially in the direction perpendicular to the local magnetic field and positively correlated with local magnetic field strengthening, and (2) the particle pitch angle distribution becomes increasingly anisotropic toward higher energies, with a concentration at large pitch angles. Our results demonstrate that the mirror acceleration causes a strong confinement of particles by stochastically increasing their pitch angles. This, in turn, facilitates repeated mirror acceleration with the mirroring condition well satisfied. We conclude that mirror acceleration is a promising mechanism accounting for efficient acceleration in magnetized and turbulent astrophysical plasmas.
