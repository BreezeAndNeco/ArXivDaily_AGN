#### Revisiting the Radius Valley Across Stellar Types: A Transit-Only Analysis of M, K, G, and F Stars with Updated NASA Exoplanet Archive Data

 - **Abstract**
 The radius valley -- a deficit of exoplanets between super-Earths and sub-Neptunes -- is a key diagnostic of planet formation and atmospheric evolution. We investigate how the radius valley depends on stellar type by analyzing an updated, transit-only sample of exoplanets from the NASA Exoplanet Archive. Planets are selected with $P < 100$ days and divided by host spectral class (M, K, G, F). We construct weighted radius distributions and apply statistical tests to quantify the valley depth. We recover a pronounced valley centered near $\sim 1.8\,R_\oplus$ for G/K stars, but shifted to $\sim 1.6\,R_\oplus$ for M dwarfs and $\sim 1.9\,R_\oplus$ for F stars. These results support the view that the radius valley is shaped by stellar-dependent processes such as photoevaporation, core-powered mass loss, and orbital migration.

 - **Abstract**
 Little red dots (LRDs), high-redshift, compact, red objects with V-shaped spectra, are one of the most exciting and perplexing discoveries made by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). While the simplest explanation for LRDs is that they are high redshift active galactic nuclei (AGN), due to their compactness and frequent association with broad line emission, the lack of corresponding X-ray emission and observed variability cast doubt on this picture. Here, we simulate LRD light curves using both traditional models for sub-Eddington AGN variability derived empirically from lower-redshift AGN observations and moderately super-Eddington AGN disk models from radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations to examine the reason for the lack of variability. We find that even though most LRDs have only been observed 2--4 times in a given waveband, we should still be detecting significantly more variability if traditional sub-Eddington AGN variability models can be applied to LRDs. Instead, our super-Eddington model light curves are consistent with the lack of observed LRD variability. In addition, the ongoing high-cadence {\sc nexus} campaign will detect changes in magnitude, $\Delta m>1$, for traditional sub-Eddington models, but will only observe significant continuum variability for the lowest mass LRDs for our super-Eddington AGN models. Even if LRDs lack continuum variability, we find that the ongoing spectroscopic JWST campaign {\sc twinkle} should observe broad emission line variability as long as soft X-ray irradiation manages to reach the broad line region from the inner disk. Our models show that super-Eddington accretion can easily explain the lack of continuum variability in LRDs.

 - **Abstract**
 The recent observations of highly accreting supermassive black holes (SMBH) at very high redshift ($>$4) with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) allowed us to shed light for the very first time on the early evolutionary phases of active galactic nuclei (AGN). Perhaps unsurprisingly, several of the physical properties observed in these new objects, including those known as little red dots (LRDs), are closely reminiscent of the low-mass and high-Eddington AGN in the local Universe, and in particular of the class of narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies. However, some differences also emerged, likely due to the radically different evolutionary path and the environment where LRDs and NLS1s live. In this work, we review the multiwavelength properties of local NLS1s and compare them with type 1 AGN found at high-$z$, showing that despite some differences, the study of NLS1s can be extremely useful to better understand the extreme accretion physics of high-$z$ quasars and the early stages of AGN evolution.
#### Fueling, Evolution, and Diversity of AGN in Dwarf Galaxies: Insights from Star Formation and Black Hole Scaling Relations

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the star formation activity and black hole scaling relations in a sample of 1451 AGN hosted by dwarf galaxies at redshift 0.5 to 0.9, drawn from the VIPERS survey. The sample comprises Seyferts and LINERs identified through emission-line diagnostics, as well as IR-selected AGN based on WISE colors. Using the parameter SFRnorm, defined as the ratio of the SFR of a galaxy hosting an AGN to the median SFR of star-forming galaxies of similar stellar mass and redshift, we compare AGN hosts to a control sample of non-AGN star-forming galaxies. We examine how SFRnorm varies with AGN power ([O III] luminosity), black hole mass, local environment, and stellar population age. We also analyze the MBH-Mstar relation and the evolution of the MBH/Mstar ratio, incorporating comparisons to X-ray AGN and high-redshift quasars (z > 4). Our key findings are: (i) all AGN populations show suppressed star formation at low AGN luminosities, with SFRnorm rising above unity at different luminosity thresholds depending on AGN type; (ii) LINERs show flat SFRnorm trends with MBH, remaining broadly consistent with unity; Seyferts display a mild increase with MBH, while IR AGN show a more pronounced positive trend; (iii) LINERs exhibit older stellar populations than Seyferts; (iv) at fixed stellar mass, Seyferts host more massive black holes than LINERs, with IR AGN falling in between; (v) the MBH/Mstar ratio is elevated relative to local scaling relations and remains approximately constant with redshift, in agreement with high-z AGN; (vi) the ratio decreases with stellar mass up to log(Mstar/Msun) approximately 11, beyond which it flattens toward values consistent with those of local, inactive galaxies, with this trend clearest for Seyferts and IR AGN. These results suggest that AGN in dwarf galaxies follow diverse evolutionary pathways shaped by gas availability, feedback, and selection effects.
#### Unraveling the Nature of the Nuclear Transient AT2020adpi

 - **Abstract**
 Transient events associated with supermassive black holes provide rare opportunities to study accretion and the environments of supermassive black holes. We present a multiwavelength study of AT2020adpi (ZTF20acvfraq), a luminous optical/UV transient in the nucleus of the galaxy WISEA J231853.77$-$103505.6 ($z=0.26$) that exhibits the properties of an ambiguous nuclear transient. Near peak, its spectral energy distribution is well described by a power law ($\lambda L_\lambda \propto \lambda^{-\alpha}$, $\alpha = 0.44 \pm 0.04$), with a maximum $g$-band luminosity of $(3.6 \pm 0.6)\times10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$, which is consistent with luminous AGN flares. We detect a strong mid-infrared flare ($L_\mathrm{peak}^{\mathrm{MIR}} = (2.3 \pm 0.05)\times10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$) delayed by $\sim$240 rest-frame days, indicating a hot dust echo from material at $\sim$0.2 pc. The optical and near-infrared spectra show broad H, He I, [OIII] lines, as well as narrow Fe II, and prominent Mg II, which is a combination not typical of TDEs. Taken together, these features suggest AT2020adpi is an ambiguous nuclear transient, where an accretion episode was triggered by stellar disruption of an accretion disk or instabilities within an active nucleus. This source demonstrates the need for careful multiwavelength analysis to distinguish between extreme AGN variability and TDEs.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational wave standard sirens offer a promising avenue for cosmological inference, particularly in measuring the expansion history of the universe. Traditionally, bright sirens require an electromagnetic counterpart to determine the redshift of the emission source while dark sirens rely on the presence of complete galaxy catalogs over large sky regions. Spectral sirens, using GW data alone, can circumvent these limitations by leveraging features in the mass distribution of compact binaries. With the recent release of the Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog 4 (GWTC-4.0), the number of significant binary black hole (BBH) merger candidates has increased to 153, enabling more robust population studies and cosmological constraints. This work builds upon previous spectral siren analyses by analyzing the latest BBH observations with parametric and non-parametric models. In particular, we consider a parametric approach using the Powerlaw + Peak and Broken Powerlaw + 2 Peaks models as well as a more flexible non-parametric model based on Gaussian processes. We find broad consistency in the inferred Hubble constant $H_0$ constraints across models. Our most constraining result is from the Gaussian Process model, which, combined with the GW170817 bright siren measurement, results in $H_0 = 69^{+7}_{-6} \ \mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$, a 10% precision measurement. For the Powerlaw + Peak and Broken Powerlaw + 2 Peaks we find fractional uncertainties of 17% and 13% respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. kAndb is a substellar companion near the planet-brown dwarf boundary, orbiting a B9IV star at 50-100 au. Estimates of its age and mass vary, fueling a decade-long debate. Atmospheric parameters (Teff 1650-2050 K, log(g) 3.5-5.5) remain poorly constrained due to model differences and heterogeneous datasets. Aims. We refine the characterization of kAndb using mid-infrared data to capture its bolometric emission. Combined with NIR measurements, we constrain Teff, log(g), and radius to reduce uncertainties in age and mass. Methods. We obtained JWST/MIRI coronagraphic data (F1065C, F1140C, F1550C) and recalibrated NIR photometry with an updated ATLAS stellar model. MIRI color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) probe the likelihood of species (CH4, NH3, silicates). We compared H and F1140C colors and magnitudes to isochrones to constrain age and mass. We modeled the spectral energy distribution with atmosphere models to refine Teff, radius, and log(g), and to constrain age and mass using evolutionary models. Results. Cloudy atmosphere models fit best, consistent with the L0/L2 spectral type and position near silicate-atmosphere field objects in the MIRI CMD. We derived an age of 47+-7 Myr and mass of 17.3+-1.8 MJup by weighted-mean model combination. Modeling yielded Teff = 1791+-68 K and radius = 1.42+-0.06 RJup, improving precision by 30%. Log(g) = 4.35+-0.07 dex represents a 70% improvement over the previous best value (4.75+-0.25). Conclusions. The new mass places kAndb just above the deuterium-burning limit. The age is 75% more precise and consistent with the Columba association (42 Myr). The Teff suggests silicate clouds, requiring spectroscopic confirmation. MIRI data were crucial to refining radius and temperature, which led to stronger constraints on age and mass and improving the overall characterization of kAndb.
#### Weakened Magnetic Braking Signals the Collapse of the Global Stellar Dynamo

 - **Abstract**
 Weakened magnetic braking (WMB) was originally proposed in 2016 to explain anomalously rapid rotation in old field stars observed by the Kepler mission. The proximate cause was suggested to be a transition in magnetic morphology from larger to smaller spatial scales. In a series of papers over the past five years, we have collected spectropolarimetric measurements to constrain the large-scale magnetic fields for a sample of stars spanning this transition, including a range of spectral types from late F to early K. During this time, we gradually improved our methods for estimating the wind braking torque in each of our targets, and for evaluating the associated uncertainties. Here, we reanalyze the entire sample with a focus on uniformity for the relevant observational inputs. We supplement the sample with two additional active stars to provide more context for the evolution of wind braking torque with stellar Rossby number (Ro). The results demonstrate unambiguously that standard spin-down models can reproduce the evolution of wind braking torque for active stars, but WMB is required to explain the subsequent abrupt decrease in torque as Ro approaches a critical value for dynamo excitation. This transition is seen in both the large-scale magnetic field and the X-ray luminosity, indicating weakened coronal heating. We interpret these transitions as evidence of a rotational threshold for the influence of Coriolis forces on global convective patterns and the resulting inefficiency of the global stellar dynamo.
#### SN 2019hnl: A Type IIP Supernova with a Partially Stripped, Low Mass Progenitor

 - **Abstract**
 We present optical photometry and spectroscopy of SN 2019hnl. Discovered within ~26 hr of explosion by the ATLAS survey, SN 2019hnl is a typical Type IIP supernova with a peak absolute V band magnitude of -16.7+-0.1 mag, a plateau length of ~107 days, and an early decline rate of 0.0086+-0.0006 mag (50 days)^-1. We use nebular spectroscopy and hydrodynamic modeling with the SNEC, MESA, and STELLA codes to infer that the progenitor of SN 2019hnl was a M_ZAMS ~ 11M_solar red supergiant which produced 0.047+-0.007M_solar of 56Ni in the explosion. As a part of our hydrodynamic modeling, we reduced hydrogen envelope mass by scaling the mass loss within the "Dutch" wind scheme to fit our light curve, showing that the progenitor of a relatively typical Type IIP SN may experience partial stripping during their evolution and establish massive (~0.2M_solar) CSM environments prior to core collapse.

 - **Abstract**
 Some black holes in X-ray binaries accrete at rates far above the Eddington limit. In this supercritical regime, photons are trapped in a radiation-dominated, geometrically thick disk. The innermost regions form a complex environment of intense radiation, strong magnetic fields, and powerful outflows, where radiation-driven winds expel large amounts of mass. These conditions suppress primary relativistic electrons within the transparent funnel along the black hole's spin axis. We show that high-energy electrons can instead arise as secondary pairs from Bethe-Heitler interactions between relativistic protons and ambient photons. Using self-similar models of accretion disks with strong winds of ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs), we compute particle acceleration via magnetic reconnection and diffusive shocks, evaluate energy losses, and assess the efficiency and spectral imprint of Bethe-Heitler pair production. Our results suggest that secondary pairs can yield nonthermal radiation in the 0.1-100 MeV range with luminosities from $10^{34}$ up to $10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$. This emission could be detectable by future MeV instruments from Galactic ULXs, offering evidence of relativistic protons in their inner funnels and revealing misaligned, otherwise hidden, super-Eddington sources in the Milky Way.

 - **Abstract**
 The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) experiences disruption from tidal and ram-pressure forces as it travels through the halo of the Milky Way. In this project, we combine radio emission-line observations from the GASS and GASKAP surveys with UV absorption-line observations from the HST Ultraviolet Legacy Library of Young Stars as Essential Standards (ULLYSES) program to trace the material in front of the LMC. Along our 8 stellar sightlines near 30 Doradus, we observe gaseous structures likely associated with two arm-like features flowing in and around the LMC's disk. We detect the nearside gas in neutral, low, and medium ionization species. The lower-ionization species likely undergo both thermal and non-thermal broadening while the moderately-ionized phase is influenced by more non-thermal processes. The total integrated column density of AlIII decreases with increasing angular offset from 30 Doradus, with sightlines within 0.25 degrees containing more moderately ionized gas. We demonstrate from a Gaussian decomposition technique on the HI emission that both arms likely trace an additional 1.0 degree in Galactic longitude toward the 30 Doradus region than previously predicted. We constrain the orientation of the arms by suggesting that they likely converge around (l,b) =(280.5$^\circ$, -31.2$^\circ$) and at least partially cross in front of the LMC. Our observations are consistent with two competing origins of the arms: 1) outflowing material is swept back by tidal and ram-pressure forces or 2) tidally stripped inflows fuel the ongoing stellar activity inside the LMC. Future studies are needed to distinguish between these scenarios.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetar giant flares (MGFs) are among the most luminous high-energy transients in the local universe, consisting of a short, intense MeV gamma-ray spike followed by a softer, pulsating X-ray tail and possibly delayed radioactive emission. While only three Galactic events have been firmly detected, several extragalactic candidates have recently been reported, motivating the need for sensitive, rapid-response gamma- and X-ray facilities to constrain their rates and energetics. We present a feasibility study of detecting MGFs with the Advanced X-ray Imaging Satellite (AXIS), focusing on two complementary pathways: (i) serendipitous discovery of the prompt gamma-ray spike within the field of view, and (ii) rapid follow-up of MGF tails in nearby galaxies. Using sensitivity rescaling and volumetric rate estimates, we find that serendipitous detection of prompt spikes during the mission lifetime is possible but unlikely, given their hardness and short duration. In contrast, AXIS's superior sensitivity, if accompanied by fast repointing capabilities, offer an extraordinary opportunity to detect pulsating X-ray tails out to about 20 Mpc, enabling the first extragalactic measurements of periodic modulations and potentially constraining emission geometry and fireball physics. Finally, we evaluate the detectability of soft X-ray line emission from r-process nucleosynthesis in MGFs, finding that such signals are extremely faint and confining the detection to Galactic distances. Our study offer a general framework for assessing the detectability of short transients with future missions.

 - **Abstract**
 Classical T Tauri stars (CTTS) exhibit strong variability over timescales of minutes to decades. However, much theoretical work assumes that CTTS are in stable spin states. Here, we test expectations for CTTS angular momentum regulation by comparing star and disk rotation. We measure stellar rotation periods and disk corotation radii ($R_{\rm co}$) for 47 CTTS from the HST ULLYSES sample. We compare $R_{\rm co}$ to the magnetospheric truncation radii ($R_{\rm i}$) and show that most CTTS are in the spin-up regime based on model predictions, which may indicate efficient angular momentum loss processes. We find evidence of magnetospheric outflows and episodic accretion, and our observations are consistent with the presence of accretion-powered stellar winds. We confirm predictions that $R_{\rm i}$ is variable over timescales of days, causing some CTTS to cross accretion stability regime boundaries. We characterize light curve morphologies and confirm that our inclined CTTS with $R_{\rm i}\sim R_{\rm co}$ show dipper light curves, consistent with expectations from disk warp models. However, dippers occur at all values of $R_{\rm i}/R_{\rm co}$, suggesting that they do not need to be near the propeller regime. Finally, we show that our measured $R_{\rm i}$ locations are consistent with observed ultra-short-period planet (USP) semi-major axes. If USPs are stable against tidal dissipation, as has been suggested in the literature, then our work provides a plausible USP formation channel. These results show that the star-disk connection produces a large variety of accretion and stellar spin configurations, most of which are likely not in equilibrium.

 - **Abstract**
 Precision photometric calibration is key to a number of astrophysical research areas such as supernova cosmology and dark energy studies. In the age of large surveys, pushing the limits of photometry is a worthy challenge, with traditional celestial calibrators limited to approximately percent precision. Here we present PANDORA, a novel calibration source that achieves sub-percent photometric precision across the optical spectrum with a selectable dynamic range and high optical efficiency. Building on proven collimated beam projector designs for relative throughput calibration of survey telescopes, PANDORA is capable of delivering photons anywhere in the 350-1100 nm spectral range. It uses selectable neutral density filters and sequential NIST-calibrated photodiode feedback to internally self-calibrate prior to operation, and is illuminated by an Energetiq EQ-99X-FC broadband laser-driven light source. We present here an overview of the system design, operation, and laboratory characterization results. PANDORA will begin science operations this year to support the upcoming LS4 survey on the ESO 1m Schmidt telescope.

 - **Abstract**
 Most baryons in present-day galaxy clusters exist as hot gas ($\boldsymbol{\gtrsim10^7\,\rm}\mathrm{K}$), forming the intracluster medium (ICM). Cosmological simulations predict that the mass and temperature of the ICM rapidly decrease with increasing cosmological redshift, as intracluster gas in younger clusters is still accumulating and being heated. The thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) effect arises when cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons are scattered to higher energies through interactions with energetic electrons in hot ICM, leaving a localized decrement in the CMB at a long wavelength. The depth of this decrement is a measure of the thermal energy and pressure of the gas. To date, the effect has been detected in only three systems at or above $z\sim2$, when the Universe was 4 billion years old, making the time and mechanism of ICM assembly uncertain. Here, we report observations of this effect in the protocluster SPT2349$-$56 with Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). SPT2349$-$56 contains a large molecular gas reservoir, with at least 30 dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) and three radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN) in a 100-kpc region at $z=4.3$, corresponding to 1.4 billion years after the Big Bang. The observed tSZ signal implies a thermal energy of $\mathbf{\sim 10^{61}\,\mathrm{erg}}$, exceeding the possible energy of a virialized ICM by an order of magnitude. Contrary to current theoretical expectations, the strong tSZ decrement in SPT2349$-$56 demonstrates that substantial heating can occur and deposit a large amount of thermal energy within growing galaxy clusters, overheating the nascent ICM in unrelaxed structures, two billion years before the first mature clusters emerged at $\mathbf{z \sim 2}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Until now, the study of unresolved main sequence binary stars in globular clusters has been possible almost exclusively in their central regions with deep Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations. We present the first detection of unresolved main-sequence binary stars in the outer field of 47 Tucanae using Rubin Observatory's Data Preview 1 (DP1). Our analysis exploits deep $i$ vs. $g-i$ colour-magnitude diagrams beyond the cluster's half-light radius, reaching almost to the tidal radius. The high-quality photometry allowed to identify unresolved binaries with mass ratios $q$ larger than 0.7. The derived binary fraction of $f_\mathrm{bin}(q>0.7) = 0.016 \pm 0.005$ stands in contrast to the significantly lower values in the cluster innermost regions, as measured from HST photometry. This result provides new empirical input for testing physical processes that drive the formation and evolution of binary stars in globular clusters. It also demonstrates Rubin's unique wide-field and high-precision photometric capabilities to address a broader range of outstanding questions in star cluster research. Future full data releases will enable to significantly expand the study of dense stellar systems across the Milky Way.

COLIBRE directly simulates the multi-phase interstellar medium and the evolution of dust grains, which is coupled to the chemistry. COLIBRE is calibrated at three resolutions: particle masses of $m_{\rm gas} \approx m_{\rm dm} \sim 10^7$ (m7), $10^6$ (m6), and $10^5~\mathrm{M_\odot}$ (m5). To calibrate the COLIBRE feedback at m7 resolution, we run Latin hypercubes of $\approx 200$ simulations that vary up to four subgrid parameters in cosmological volumes of ($50~\mathrm{cMpc}$)$^{3}$. We train Gaussian process emulators on these simulations to predict the $z=0$ galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) and size - stellar mass relation (SSMR) as functions of the model parameters, which we then fit to observations. The trained emulators not only provide the best-fitting parameter values but also enable us to investigate how different aspects of the prescriptions for supernova and AGN feedback affect the predictions. In particular, we demonstrate that while the observed $z=0$ GSMF and SSMR can be matched individually with a relatively simple supernova feedback model, simultaneously reproducing both necessitates a more sophisticated prescription. We show that the calibrated m7 COLIBRE model not only reproduces the calibration target observables, but also matches various other galaxy properties to which the model was not calibrated. Finally, we apply the calibrated m7 model to the m6 and m5 resolutions and, after slight manual adjustments of the subgrid parameters, achieve a similar level of agreement with the observed $z=0$ GSMF and SSMR.

 - **Abstract**
 Suppression effects of giant radio lobes from supermassive black holes on gas accretion onto galaxies in the surrounding regions are quantified using cosmological magneto-hydrodynamic simulations. With an appropriate amount of radio jet energy injected into the intergalactic medium following the formation peak of supermassive black holes at redshift two, we find that galaxies in the greater neighborhood of the jet-launching massive galaxies subsequently experience a significant reduction in the amount of accreted gas. The distribution of the resulting magnetic field in the intergalactic medium is highly inhomogeneous, due to the highly biased nature of the most massive supermassive black holes. In regions with magnetic field strength $B>10^{-2}\mu$G, the baryon fraction is on average reduced by 17%, 14%, and 12%, respectively, for halos of mass in the range of $[10^{11}-10^{12})\msun$, $[10^{12}-10^{13})\msun$, and $[10^{13}-10^{14})\msun$. A proper inclusion of this new, external, global, preventive feedback mechanism from AGN in the next generation of cosmological simulation may be necessary.

 - **Abstract**
 The continuous flux of Galactic cosmic rays that bombard Earth's atmosphere creates ionizing radiation that can damage the DNA of living organisms. While this radiation on Earth is relatively constant in the short term, large and long-scale fluctuations are expected with a period of $\sim 63.5$ million years. As the Solar System moves above or below the Galactic plane during its oscillatory motion about the Galactic center, the Galactic magnetic shielding weakens, allowing more cosmic rays to reach Earth and trigger mutations in organisms. We identify a significant correlation (weighted global p-value: $1.25\times 10^{-4}$, or $3.72\sigma$) between the Solar System's Galactic oscillations and the origination of marine zoo- and phyto-microplankton genera over the Phanerozoic. When we restrict the analysis to time intervals during which all four groups coexisted, a post-trial significance of $4.52\sigma$ emerges. Our findings suggest that changes in biodiversity have been significantly influenced by long-term Galactic forcing.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational waves (GWs) with electromagnetic counterparts (EMc) offer a novel approach to measure the Hubble constant ($H_0$), known as bright sirens, enabling $H_0$ measurements by combining GW-derived distances with EM-derived redshifts. Host galaxy identification is essential for redshift determination but remains challenging due to poor GW sky localization and uncertainties in EMc models. To overcome these limitations, we exploit the ultra-high-precision localization ($\Delta \Omega_s \sim 10^{-4} \, \text{deg}^2$) with a space-based GW detector network (LISA-Taiji-TianQin), which permits unique host identification solely from GW signals. We integrate five massive black hole binary (MBHB) population models and two galaxy number density models to compute the redshift horizon for host galaxy identification and evaluate $H_0$ constraints. We find that (1) The network enhances localization by several orders of magnitude compared to single detectors; (2) The identification horizon reaches $z\sim 1.2$ for specific MBHBs in the most accurate localization case; (3) The population model choice critically impacts the outcomes: the most refined population models yield to independent EMc identification rate of 0.6-1 $\text{yr}^{-1}$ with $H_0$ constraints $< 1\%$ fractional uncertainty, the less refined models lead to the rate $<0.1\text{yr}^{-1}$ and $1-2\%$ uncertainty on $H_0$.

 - **Abstract**
 The subject of boosted fluxes of dark matter or cosmic relic neutrinos via scattering on cosmic rays has received considerable attention recently. This article investigates the boosted neutrino flux from scattering of cosmic rays and the so-far undetected diffuse supernova neutrino background, taking into account both galactic and extragalactic cosmic rays. The calculated flux is many orders of magnitude smaller than either the galactic diffuse neutrino emission, the extragalactic astrophysical flux measured by IceCube, or the cosmogenic neutrino flux expected at the highest energies.

 - **Abstract**
 The reported anomalous global 21-cm signal $(T_{21})$ from the cosmic dawn era by Experiment to Detect the Global Epoch of Reionisation Signature (EDGES) could hint towards new physics beyond the standard model. The resonant conversion of the axion-like particles (ALPs) into photons in the presence of primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) could be a viable solution. However, the strength of the PMFs can change over the time as they can decay by ambipolar diffusion and turbulent decay. Consequently, PMFs can dissipate their energy into the intergalactic medium (IGM), which can alter the global 21-cm signal. We simultaneously consider both magnetic heating of IGM and resonant conversion of ALPs to derive physically motivated upper bounds on the coupling strength $(g_{a\gamma})$ and magnetic field strength $(B_n)$. Our findings report that, for $B_n= 0.1\,\rm nG$, $g_{a\gamma}B_n\lesssim (3.6\times 10^{-4}-3\times 10^{-3})$ is required to recover standard $T_{21}=-156\,\rm mK$, while a deeper absorption of $-500$ mK pushes the upper bound to $g_{a\gamma}B_n\lesssim (6.5\times 10^{-4}-5.7\times 10^{-3})$.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar tornadoes are believed to influence plasma dynamics and create conditions for heating, yet a direct quantitative link is lacking. Here, for the first time, we directly measure vortex-driven dynamics using information-theoretic diagnostics in a Bifrost simulation. By combining Shannon Entropy (SE) and Normalized Mutual Information (NMI), we track how vortices restructure plasma-magnetic interactions and channel energy into heat. The vortex flow originates in the upper photosphere and extends into the chromosphere and upper atmosphere. Relative to a control region dominated by shear flows and transient swirls, the coherent vortex shows stronger statistical interdependence between vorticity and other MHD variables. SE shows that vertical magnetic field entropy increases at the vortex onset as magnetic flux is redistributed, then decreases as the field becomes ordered. Magnetic shear and magnetic energy entropy peak during vortex development, reflecting current and energy build-up. In the upper atmosphere, low entropy in temperature and pressure alongside high entropy in density indicates ordered thermal and pressure fields but irregular mass distribution, a departure from ideal-gas behavior confirmed by weakened temperature-density coupling. NMI shows that temperature couples to different heating drivers with height: compression and vorticity (viscous heating, since vorticity traces velocity gradients) in the lower atmosphere, and vorticity plus magnetic shear in the upper atmosphere (viscous and current-driven heating). Although the simulation does not include explicit physical dissipation, hyperdiffusivity acts on sharp gradients and mimics these processes. Our results demonstrate that vortices drive multiscale coupling between flows and fields, locally shaping solar atmospheric dynamics and heating

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze data from 142 of the 218 gravitational-wave (GW) sources in the fourth LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration (LVK) Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-4.0) to estimate the Hubble constant $H_0$ jointly with the population properties of merging compact binaries. We measure the luminosity distance and redshifted masses of GW sources directly; in contrast, we infer GW source redshifts statistically through i) location of features in the compact object mass spectrum and merger rate evolution, and ii) identifying potential host galaxies in the GW localization volume. Probing the relationship between source luminosity distances and redshifts obtained in this way yields constraints on cosmological parameters. We also constrain parameterized deviations from general relativity which affect GW propagation, specifically those modifying the dependence of a GW signal on the source luminosity distance. Assuming our fiducial model for the source-frame mass distribution and using GW candidates detected up to the end of the fourth observing run (O4a), together with the GLADE+ all-sky galaxy catalog, we estimate $H_0 = 76.6^{+13.0}_{-9.5} (76.6^{+25.2}_{-14.0})$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. This value is reported as a median with 68.3% (90%) symmetric credible interval, and includes combination with the $H_0$ measurement from GW170817 and its electromagnetic counterpart. Using a parametrization of modified GW propagation in terms of the magnitude parameter $\Xi_0$, we estimate $\Xi_0 = 1.2^{+0.8}_{-0.4} (1.2^{+2.4}_{-0.5})$, where $\Xi_0 = 1$ recovers the behavior of general relativity.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of a massive and potentially largest Ly$\alpha$ Nebula, RaJav, at z=2.25, associated with a quasar pair: the bright SDSS~J162029.07+433451.1 (hereafter J1620+4334) and the faint newly discovered quasar JPAS-9600-10844, at 2.265 $\pm$ 0.021 using the early data release (17 deg$^{2}$) of the J-PAS. The quasar JPAS-9600-10844 embedded in the nebula is located at ~ 60.2 kpc (7.3'') from J1620+4334, and shows a compact structure with broad emission lines (> 3000 km/s), typical of active galactic nuclei. At a 2$\sigma$ surface brightness (SB) contour of $\sim 1.86 \times 10^{-16}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ arcsec$^{-2}$, the nebula extends > 100 kpcs and has a total Ly$\alpha$ luminosity of $\sim 7.7 \pm 0.6 \times 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ signify the presence of a giant Enormous Ly$\alpha$ Nebula (ELAN). The nebula traces an over density of quasars at redshift of 2.2-2.3 consistent with the progenitor of a massive galaxy cluster. The extended CIV emission indicates that the circum-galactic medium (CGM) is metal-enriched and not primordial. The current J-PAS observations suggest photoionization and shocks due to outflows as possible ionization mechanisms. The faint extended FUV and NUV continuum emission likely points to ongoing star formation around the two quasars, suggesting a complex interaction in their environments. These findings provide new insights into the environment of quasars and their role in shaping the dynamics and evolution of the CGM at cosmic noon. Further spectroscopic observations will be required to fully characterize the object's nature and its kinematic properties. This study demonstrates the unique capability of J-PAS to detect massive and rare Ly$\alpha$ nebulae, providing new insights into their properties, environments, and connections to large-scale structures in the cosmic web such as filaments and overdensities in a large cosmological volume.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic rays (CRs) play a pivotal role in various astrophysical systems, delivering feedback over a broad range of scales. However, modeling CR transport remains challenging due to its inherently multi-scale nature and complex microphysics. Recent advances in two-moment CR hydrodynamics have alleviated some of these challenges, improving understanding of CR feedback. Yet, current two-moment methods may not be able to directly incorporate all relevant CR transport processes, while the outcome of CR feedback sensitively depends on these underlying microphysics. Furthermore, numerical challenges persist, including instabilities from streaming terms and ambiguities in solver design for coupled CR-MHD systems. In this work, we develop a two-moment description for CR hydrodynamics from first principles. Beyond canonical CR streaming, our formulation accounts for CR pressure anisotropy and Alfvén waves propagating in both directions along the magnetic field, providing a general framework to incorporate more CR transport physics. We implement this framework as a new CR fluid module in the \textit{Athena}++ code, and validate it through a suite of benchmark tests. In particular, we derive the full dispersion relation of the two-moment CR-MHD system, identifying the CR-acoustic instability as well as other wave branches. These CR-MHD waves serve as rigorous benchmarks and also enable the use of realistic signal speeds in our Riemann solver. We propose a time step guideline to mitigate numerical instabilities arising from streaming source terms.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy clusters, the Universe's largest halo structures, are filled with 10-100 million degree X-ray-emitting gas. Their evolution is shaped by energetic processes such as feedback from supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and mergers with other cosmic structures. The imprints of these processes on gas kinematic properties remain largely unknown, restricting our understanding of gas thermodynamics and energy conversion within clusters. High-resolution spectral mapping across a broad spatial-scale range provides a promising solution to this challenge, enabled by the recent launch of the XRISM X-ray Observatory. Here, we present the kinematic measurements of the X-ray-brightest Perseus cluster with XRISM, radially covering the extent of its cool core. We find direct evidence for the presence of at least two dominant drivers of gas motions operating on distinct physical scales: a small-scale driver in the inner ~60 kpc, likely associated with the SMBH feedback; and a large-scale driver in the outer core, powered by mergers. The inner driver sustains a heating rate at least an order of magnitude higher than the outer one. This finding suggests that, during the active phase, the SMBH feedback generates turbulence, which, if fully dissipated into heat, could play a significant role in offsetting radiative cooling losses in the Perseus core. Our study underscores the necessity of kinematic mapping observations of extended sources for robust conclusions on the properties of the velocity field and their role in the assembly and evolution of massive halos. It further offers a kinematic diagnostic for theoretical models of SMBH feedback.
#### Extreme Starlight Polarization Efficiency Toward $ζ$ Ophiuchi: A Case for Line-of-Sight Foreground Subtraction

 - **Abstract**
 Despite the pervasive nature of interstellar dust and its impact on nearly all observations, most dust corrections employ line-of-sight averages over large angular scales. This neglects real variations on small angular and distance scales from discrete components of the ISM. We use $V$ band polarimetry, public dust maps, and Gaia DR3 distances of 25 stars along a 50' radius sight line towards the O9.5IV star $\zeta$ Ophiuchi ($d \approx $ 182 pc) to examine both dust and magnetic structures over the range $d = $ 36--1176 pc and angular scales of $< 1$\degr. Polarization and reddening data indicate two discrete dust populations having different magnetic field orientations along the sight line, one at $d \simeq$ 86--127 pc and another at $d\simeq$ 252--287 pc. After removal of the foreground, the more distant component exhibits alignment in polarization angle with 12 $\mu$m PAH striations seen in the field. This more distant dust population exhibits evidence of extreme starlight polarization efficiency with an average of 14.1% mag$^{-1}$, greater than the canonical Serkowski limit of 9% mag$^{-1}$. The spatial coincidence with the PAH striations indicates the PAH-emitting grains and those responsible for the high polarization efficiency may be components of the same dust population. We find no evidence that $\zeta$ Oph's radiative influence affects the polarizing or reddening properties of the surrounding dust. Our study demonstrates that accurate distance-based foreground subtraction is vital to properly understanding superimposed dust and the magnetic field components in the ISM.
