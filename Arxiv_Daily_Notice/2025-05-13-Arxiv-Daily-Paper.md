 - **Abstract**
 We present the ALMA-CRISTAL survey, an ALMA Cycle 8 Large Program designed to investigate the physical properties of star-forming galaxies at $4 \lesssim z \lesssim 6$ through spatially resolved, multi-wavelength observations. This survey targets 19 star-forming main-sequence galaxies selected from the ALPINE survey, using ALMA Band 7 observations to study [CII] 158 $\mu$m line emission and dust continuum, complemented by JWST/NIRCam and HST imaging to map stellar and UV emission. The CRISTAL sample expanded to 39 after including newly detected galaxies in the CRISTAL fields, archival data, and pilot study targets. The resulting dataset provides a detailed view of gas, dust, and stellar structures on kiloparsec scales at the end of the era of reionization. The survey reveals diverse morphologies and kinematics, including rotating disks, merging systems, [CII] emission tails from potential interactions, and clumpy star formation. Notably, the [CII] emission in many cases extends beyond the stellar light seen in HST and JWST imaging. Scientific highlights include CRISTAL-10, exhibiting an extreme [CII] deficit similar to Arp 220; and CRISTAL-13, where feedback from young star-forming clumps likely causes an offset between the stellar clumps and the peaks of [CII] emission. CRISTAL galaxies exhibit global [CII]/FIR ratios that decrease with increasing FIR luminosity, similar to trends seen in local galaxies but shifted to higher luminosities, likely due to their higher molecular gas content. CRISTAL galaxies also span a previously unexplored range of global FIR surface brightness at high-redshift, showing that high-redshift galaxies can have elevated [CII]/FIR ratios. These elevated ratios are likely influenced by factors such as lower metallicity gas, the presence of significant extraplanar gas, and contributions from shock-excited gas.

 - **Abstract**
 Non-spherical potentials allow a wide range of trajectories, both regular and chaotic, whose periapse distances can vary orbit to orbit. In particular chaotic trajectories can bring a system arbitrarily close to the central massive black hole leading to a disruption. In this paper, we work with an observationally benchmarked model of the innermost 200 pc of the Milky Way and show that low z-angular momentum trajectories are commonly chaotic. We compute the timescales and properties of close pericenter passages, and compare the implied collisionless disruption rate to the well-studied collisional rate from 2-body scatterings. We find that the relative collisionless rate can dominate by orders of magnitude. Our calculations are relevant for a wide range of disruption phenomena, including the production of hypervelocity stars (HVSs) and tidal disruption events (TDEs). Most of these disruptions involve stars come from the Nuclear Stellar Cluster, with a pericenter distribution that strongly favours shallow encounters, and a preference for high inclination interactions. The latter implies that unbound disrupted material - whether ejected stars or stellar debris - would be preferentially directed towards the galactic poles. Many of our conclusions apply generally to any galaxy with a non-spherical galactic centre potential and central massive black hole.

 - **Abstract**
 The formation of compact high-redshift star-forming clumps, the physical processes driving their evolution and their potential connection to present-day Globular Clusters are key open questions in galaxy formation. In this work, we aim to shed light on these aspects using the SImulating the Environment where Globular clusters Emerged (SIEGE) project, a suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations with sub-parsec resolution specifically designed to investigate the physical conditions behind the origin of compact stellar systems in high-redshift environments. The simulation object of this study focuses on a dwarf galaxy with a virial mass of a few $10^9$ $M_\odot$ at $z=6.14$, where the spatial resolution reaches 0.3 pc $h^{-1}$. Individual stars are formed directly by sampling the initial mass function with a 100\% star formation efficiency, a setup designed to explore the impact of a high star formation efficiency under high-redshift conditions. The simulation reveals the emergence of numerous stellar clumps with sizes of 1-3 pc, stellar surface densities up to almost $10^4$ $M_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$, and masses predominantly spanning from $10^3$ $M_\odot$ to several $10^4$ $M_\odot$, with a few reaching $10^5$ $M_\odot$ and up to $10^6$ $M_\odot$. All clumps form during intense, short bursts of star formation lasting less than a Myr, often with negligible dark matter content (dark-to-stellar mass ratios below 1 within three times their effective radii). We measure a clear correlation between mass and size, and a clump mass function described by a power-law with a slope of -2. Star formation conditions in the simulation behave similarly to those of a feedback-free starburst scenario, where dense clumps form due to inefficient stellar feedback over small timescales. Notably, some clumps exhibit properties closely resembling those of present-day globular clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 JWST observations uncovered a large number of massive quiescent galaxies (MQGs) at z>3, which theoretical models struggle to reproduce. Explaining the number density of such objects requires extremely high conversion efficiency of baryons into stars in early dark matter halos. Using stellar kinematics, we can investigate the processes shaping the mass assembly histories of MQGs. We present high-resolution JWST/NIRSpec integral field spectroscopy of GS-9209, a massive, compact quiescent galaxy at z=4.66 ($\log \left (M_{\ast}/M_{\odot} \right) = 10.52 \pm 0.06 $, $R_{eff} = 220 \pm 20$ pc). Full spectral fitting of the spatially resolved stellar continuum reveals a clear rotational pattern, yielding a spin parameter of $\lambda_{R_{eff}} = 0.65 \pm 0.12$. With its high degree of rotational support, this galaxy challenges the scenario of MQGs growing mainly by dry major mergers. This study suggests that at least a fraction of the earliest quiescent galaxies were fast rotators and that quenching was dynamically gentle process, preserving the stellar disc even in highly compact objects. Using Jeans anisotropic modelling (JAM) and a NFW profile, we measure a dark matter fraction of $f_{\rm DM} \left (< R_{eff} \right ) = 6.3^{+2.8}_{-1.7}%$, which is plausible given that this galaxy is extremely compact. Our findings use kinematics to independently confirm the massive nature of early quiescent galaxies, previously inferred from stellar population modelling. We suggest that GS-9209 has a similar structure to low-redshift 'relic' galaxies. However, unlike relic galaxies which have bottom-heavy initial mass functions (IMF), the dynamically inferred stellar mass-to-light ratio of GS-9209 is consistent with a Milky-Way like IMF. The kinematical properties of GS-9209 are different from those of z<1 early-type galaxies and more similar to those of recently quenched post-starburst galaxies at z>2.

 - **Abstract**
 Young (<500 Myr) multi-planet transiting systems are valuable environments for understanding planet evolution by offering an opportunity to make direct comparisons between planets from the same formation conditions. TOI-2076 is known to harbor three, 2.5-4 $R_\oplus$ planets on 10-35 day orbits. All three are JWST cycle 3 targets (for transmission spectroscopy). Here, we present the detection of TOI-2076 e; a smaller (1.35 $R_\oplus$), inner (3.02 day) planet in the system. We update the age of the system by analyzing the rotation periods, Lithium equivalent widths, color-magnitude diagram, and variability of likely co-moving stars, finding that TOI-2076 and co-moving planetary system TOI-1807 are 210 $\pm$ 20 Myr. The discovery of TOI-2076 e is motivation to revisit known transiting systems in search of additional planets that are now detectable with new TESS data and updated search methods.

 - **Abstract**
 JWST spectroscopy has built large emission line samples at $z\gtrsim4$, but it has yet to confidently reveal many galaxies with the hard radiation fields commonly associated with AGN photoionization. While this may indicate a weaker UV ionizing spectrum in many $z>4$ AGNs or obscuration from dense neutral gas and dust, the complete picture remains unclear owing to the small number of deep rest-UV spectra. Here we characterize the strength of high ionization lines in $53$ new galaxies observed with NIRSpec $R=2700$ grating spectroscopy. We present new detections of narrow NV$\lambda1240$ in two galaxies. One is a previously-confirmed $z=6.98$ Little Red Dot (LRD) with broad H$\beta$, and the other is a $z=8.72$ galaxy with a narrow line spectrum. Neither source exhibits CIV or HeII emission, indicating large NV/CIV and NV/HeII ratios that may reflect a combination of nitrogen-enhancement and resonant scattering effects. We investigate the incidence of narrow high ionization lines in a large database of $851$ NIRSpec grating spectra, and we separately quantify the fraction of LRDs with narrow high ionization UV emission lines. Our results likely suggest that hard radiation fields are indeed present in a small subset of LRDs ($12.5^{+23.7}_{-10.4}\%$) and UV-selected galaxies ($2.2^{+1.7}_{-1.0}\%$) at $z>4$. The identification of narrow high ionization lines in the population of LRDs with strong Balmer absorption suggests the dense neutral hydrogen gas may not uniformly cover the nucleus. The NV/CIV and NV/HeII ratios suggest that efforts to identify high ionization lines should extend down in wavelength to the NV doublet.

 - **Abstract**
 To explore the hypothesis of a common source of variability in two time series, observers may estimate the magnitude-squared coherence (MSC), which is a frequency-domain view of the cross correlation. For time series that do not have uniform observing cadence, MSC can be estimated using Welch's overlapping segment averaging. However, multitaper has superior statistical properties to Welch's method in terms of the tradeoff between bias, variance, and bandwidth. The classical multitaper technique has recently been extended to accommodate time series with underlying uniform observing cadence from which some observations are missing. This situation is common for solar and geomagnetic datasets, which may have gaps due to breaks in satellite coverage, instrument downtime, or poor observing conditions. We demonstrate the scientific use of missing-data multitaper magnitude-squared coherence by detecting known solar mid-term oscillations in simultaneous, missing-data time series of solar Lyman $\alpha$ flux and geomagnetic Disturbance Storm Time index. Due to their superior statistical properties, we recommend that multitaper methods be used for all heliospheric time series with underlying uniform observing cadence.

 - **Abstract**
 The instantaneous emission from a relativistic surface endowed with a Lorentz factor $\Gamma$ that decreases away from the outflow symmetry axis can naturally explain the three phases observed by Swift/XRT in GRBs and their afterglows (GRB tail, afterglow plateau and post-plateau). We expand the analytical formalism of the "Larger-Angle Emission" model previously developed for "Power-Law" outflows to "n-Exponential" outflows (e.g. exponential with $n=1$ and Gaussian with $n=2$) and compare their abilities to account for the X-ray emission of XRT afterglows. We assume power-law $\Gamma$-dependences of two spectral characteristics (peak-energy and peak intensity) and find that, unlike Power-Law outflows, n-Exponential outflows cannot account for plateaus with a temporal dynamical range larger than 100. To include all information existing in the Swift/XRT measurements of X-ray aferglows (0.3-10 keV unabsorbed flux and effective spectral slope), we calculate 0.3 keV and 10 keV light-curves using a broken power-law emission spectrum of peak-energy and low-and high-energy slopes that are derived from the effective slope measured by XRT. This economical peak-energy determination is found to be consistent with more expensive spectral fits. The angular distributions of the Lorentz factor, comoving frame peak-energy, and peak-intensity ($\Gamma (\theta), E'_p (\theta), i'_p(\theta)$) constrain the (yet-to-be determined) convolution of various features of the production of relativistic jets by solar-mass black-holes and of their propagation through the progenitor/circumburst medium, while the $E'_p (\Gamma)$ and $i'_p (\Gamma)$ dependences may constrain the GRB dissipation mechanism and the GRB emission process.

 - **Abstract**
 AR Scorpii, the so called white dwarf pulsar, contains a rapidly rotating magnetic white dwarf (WD; Pspin = 117.0564 s) interacting with a cool, red dwarf (RD) companion in a 3.56 hour orbit. It is a strong radio source with an inverted spectral index between 1-200 GHz that is indicative of synchrotron emission. This paper presents the first submillimeter observations of AR Scorpii using the Submillimeter Array, helping to fill a critical gap in the spectral energy distribution between 10-600 GHz. The average flux densities at 220 and 345 GHz are 124 and 86 mJy, respectively. The lower than expected flux density at 345 GHz suggests a break in the synchrotron emission at about 200 GHz. A periodogram analysis of the 220 GHz observations shows a modulation with an amplitude of ~6% at a period of 58.26 s or at twice the spin frequency of the white dwarf. This modulation is the first direct detection of the WD spin period at radio frequencies and implies that the synchrotron emission arises near the WD and and not from an interaction with the photosphere of the RD. A fit to the spectral energy distribution shows that the synchrotron emission arises from a small, low density region with a magnetic field of 43 MG at a distance of 0.6 orbital radii from the WD. This result implies that AR Scorpii contains a weakly magnetic WD (~15 MG) and not a strongly magnetic WD (~500 MG) as previously asserted.
#### Systematic Investigation into Radio Supernovae with Markov Chain Monte Carlo Analysis: Implications for Massive Stars' Mass Loss and Shock Acceleration Physics

 - **Abstract**
 We present a systematic analysis of radio supernovae (SNe) to investigate the statistical tendencies of SN progenitors' mass-loss rates and shock acceleration efficiencies. We conduct parameter estimation through Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis for 32 radio SN samples with a clear peak observed in their light curves, and successfully fit 27 objects with the widely-used radio SN model. We find the inferred mass-loss rates of stripped-envelope SN progenitors are by an order of magnitude greater ($\sim 10^{-3}\,M_\odot{\rm yr}^{-1}$) than those of SN II progenitors ($<10^{-4}\,M_\odot{\rm yr}^{-1}$). The efficiencies of electron acceleration and magnetic field amplification are found to be less than $10^{-2}$, and the possibility of their energy equipartition is not ruled out. On the other hand, we find the following two properties that might be related to limitations of the standard model for radio SNe; one is the extremely high magnetic field amplification efficiency, and the other is the shallower density gradient of the outer ejecta. We suggest the new interpretation that these peculiar results are misleading due to the setup that is not included in our model, and we identify the missing setup as a dense CSM in the vicinity of the progenitor. This means that a large fraction of radio SN progenitors might possess dense CSM in the vicinity of the progenitor, which is not smoothly connected with the outer CSM.

 - **Abstract**
 Spectropolarimetric observations show that many low-mass stars possess large-scale poloidal magnetic fields with considerable dipole component, which in some cases exhibit temporal dynamics - cycles or reversals. Although it is widely accepted that their magnetic fields are generated by the dynamo process, it is hard to reproduce coherent oscillations of large-scale magnetic fields with a dipolar symmetry as observed for the Sun when turbulent and compressible regimes are explored. Most previous 3D numerical studies partially avoided this problem by considering a numerical domain with low density stratification, which may correspond to neglecting surface effects where density drops considerably. To address this question, we perform direct numerical simulations of convective dynamos in extreme parameter regimes of both strong turbulence and strong density stratification, using software MagIC. Our simulations exhibit rotationally-influenced large-scale convective motions surrounded by a turbulent compressible surface layer. We find complex time variations of the magnetic field in flow regimes of predominantly dipolar configuration with respect to the few large-scale harmonics. In such regimes, turbulent surface layer induces global magnetic pumping mechanism, transporting magnetic energy into the deep interiors of our dynamo model. Dipole magnetic fields are found in regimes of transition between solar- and anti-solar differential rotation, and interact dynamically with it. The spatial distribution and temporal behavior of the large-scale fields is consistent with observations of low-mass stars, which suggest magnetic pumping could promote time-dependent magnetic fields with a dipolar symmetry as observed for the Sun and other solar-like stars. Our results suggest a parameter path in which dynamo models with a complex multiscale dynamics should be explored.

 - **Abstract**
 The role of mergers in the evolution of massive black holes is still unclear, and their dynamical evolution, from the formation of pairs to binaries and the final coalescence, carries large physical uncertainties. The identification of the elusive population of close massive binary black holes (MBBHs) is crucial to understand the importance of mergers in the formation and evolution of supermassive black holes. It has been proposed that MBBHs may display periodic optical/ultra-violet variability. Optical surveys provide photometric measurements of a large variety of objects, over decades and searching for periodicities coming from galaxies in their long-term optical/UV lightcurves may help identify new MBBH candidates. Using the Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey (CRTS) and Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) data, we studied the long-term periodicity of variable sources in the centre of galaxies identified using the galaxy catalogue Glade+. We report 36 MBBHs candidates, with sinusoidal variability with amplitudes between 0.1 and 0.8 magnitudes over 3-5 cycles, through fitting 15 years of data. The periodicities are also detected when adding a red noise contribution to the sine model. Moreover, the periodicities are corroborated through Generalized Lomb Scargle (GLS) periodograms analysis, providing supplementary evidence for the observed modulation. We also indicate 58 objects, that were previously proposed to be MBBH candidates from analysis of CRTS data only. Adding ZTF data clearly shows that the previously claimed modulation is due to red noise. We also created a catalogue of 221 weaker candidates which require further observations over the coming years to help validate their nature. Based on our 36 MBBHs candidates, we expect ~20 MBBHs at z<1, which is commensurate with simulations. Further observations will help confirm these results.

 - **Abstract**
 High velocity stars move through the interstellar medium with V > 30 km/s. When the star has powerful winds, under the appropriate conditions, the interaction of the wind with the interstellar material produces a system of shocks. The outer shock, called the bowshock, perturbs the ambient medium, heating and compressing the gas. The dust in the compressed bowshock cools, producing infrared radiation. This emission appears as extended coma-shape structures. The discovery of radio nonthermal emission from two stellar bowshock nebulae indicates that these sources might be accelerating electrons up to relativistic energies. The produced nonthermal radio emission is most probably synchrotron which has a high degree of polarization. In this work we model the synchrotron emission of runaway massive star bowshocks aiming to produce synthetic radio emission and polarization maps for two frequencies: 1.40 and 4.86 GHz. We model the interacting plasmas in a steady-state regime by means of magnetohydrodynamics simulations and we compute the injection and transport of the relativistic electrons in the diffusion approximation. We include in the model the most important depolarization effects. Our main conclusions are i) the effects of Faraday rotation within the source are important at the lowest frequency considered, ii) inferring the local magnetic field direction from polarization measurements only can be misleading, iii) thermal radio emission produced by ionized plasma within the bowshock structure and surroundings can surpass the polarized one for the considered frequencies, and iv) the contribution from the background electrons is minor.

 - **Abstract**
 The linear stability of global non-axisymmetric modes in differentially rotating, magnetized, non-ideal plasma is crucial for understanding turbulence and transport phenomena. We investigate the competition between the local Magneto-Rotational Instability (MRI) and the Magneto-Curvature Instability (MCI)--a distinct non-axisymmetric low-frequency curvature-driven global branch--by developing and applying a non-ideal global spectral method, validated against NIMROD code simulations, and an extended effective potential formalism. Our analysis reveals that the global, low-frequency MCI persists at low magnetic Reynolds numbers (Rm), whereas the localized, high-frequency MRI is stabilized by diffusive broadening of its structure around its Alfvénic resonances. Consequently, we identify the global MCI as the primary onset mechanism for magnetohydrodynamic instability in systems with finite curvature, e.g., astrophysical rotators. We establish distinct parameter regimes for mode dominance: MCI prevails in geometrically moderate-thickness disks with high curvature and intermediate radial gaps, while MRI dominates in thin, low-curvature disks with large radial gaps. Mode competition is also highly sensitive to the flow profile, particularly vorticity and its gradient, with non-uniform shear profiles exhibiting more robust instability due to flow-curvature and shear contributions. A key outcome is the development of "spectral diagrams" derived from the global spectral method. These diagrams comprehensively map dominant instabilities and their characteristics, offering a predictive tool for critical onset parameters (i.e., flow curvature, magnetic field, and Rm) and facilitating the interpretation of experimental and simulation results. Notably, these diagrams demonstrate that the global MCI is generally the sole unstable mode at the initial onset of instability.

 - **Abstract**
 Using Gaussian process methods, we analyzed the light curves of three extreme solar X-ray flares observed by the RHESSI satellite. Their variability characteristics were then compared with those of HXMT-HE X-ray burst (XRB; in SGR 1935+2154) associated with fast radio burst (FRB) 200428 and blazar $\gamma$-ray giant flares, to investigate the origins of these extreme flaring events. The variability patterns of the solar X-ray flares follow the stochastically driven damped simple harmonic oscillator (SHO) model. The derived timescales $t_{\rm B\underline{} steep}$ and $t_{\rm B\underline{~} flat}$ (corresponding to PSD breaks) are in the range of 4-7 s and 16-53 s, respectively. The FRB-associated HXMT-HE burst has a $Q$ value near 0.3, matching those of the solar flares occurred on 23 July 2002 (flare 1) and 3 November 2003 (flare 2). By contrast, blazar $\gamma$-ray giant flares show $Q >$ 0.3, similar to the solar flare occurred on 25 February 2014 (flare 3). We proposed that the critically damped state of the system may be the condition triggering the association between the XRB in SGR 1935+2154 and the FRB. In this scenario, the critical damping $Q$ value of the system is around 0.3, not the theoretical 0.5. The similarity in $Q$ values might imply that the FRB-associated HXMT-HE XRB and solar X-ray flares 1 $\&$ 2 share comparable dynamic behavior, while blazar $\gamma$-ray flares and solar X-ray flare 3 exhibit another distinct but similar dynamic behavior. Like solar X-ray flares, these extreme flares may all be related to the magnetic reconnection process.

 Recent observations by the James Webb Space Telescope have uncovered a population of compact, red object ($z\sim 4\text{--}7$) known as little red dots (LRDs). The presence of broad Balmer emission lines indicates active galactic nuclei powered by supermassive black holes (BHs), while LRDs exhibit unusually weak X-ray and radio emission and low variability, suggesting super-Eddington accretion that obscures the central engine. We suggest that such an extreme accretion disc inevitably drives strong outflows, which would disrupt the LRDs themselves unless confined within the nuclear region -- posing a general feedback problem for overmassive BHs. To resolve this, we propose that the BH is embedded in a massive, optically thick envelope that gravitationally confines the outflow, making any outflow a no-go. This envelope, powered by accretion on to the BH, radiates at nearly the Eddington limit, and is sustained by an infall of the interstellar medium at a rate on the order of $\sim 1 M_{\odot}~{\rm yr}^{-1}$. A photosphere emerges either within the envelope or in the infalling medium, with a characteristic temperature of $5000$ - $7000 {\rm K}$, near the Hayashi limit. The resulting blackbody emission naturally explains the red optical continuum of the distinct V-shaped spectrum observed in most LRDs. Furthermore, the dynamical time-scale at the photosphere, $\sim 0.01~{\rm pc}$, is consistent with the observed year-scale variabilities. The nuclear structure and spectral features of LRDs are shaped by this envelope, which not only regulates feedback but also acts as a gas reservoir that sustains rapid BH growth in the early universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar-mass binary black holes (BBH) may form, evolve, and merge within the dense environments of active galactic nuclei (AGN) disks, thereby contributing to the BBH population detected by gravitational wave (GW) observatories. Mergers occurring in AGN disks may be gravitationally lensed by the supermassive black hole at the AGN centre. The probability of such lensing events has been approximately estimated by using the Einstein criterion in previous work. However, a more reasonable approach to calculating the lensing probability should be based on whether the detector can distinguish the lensed GW waveform from the unlensed one. In this work, we calculate the lensing probability of LIGO sources embedded in AGN disk by relating threshold mismatch to the signal-to-noise ratio of the observed events. For the sensitivity of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O3 observation runs, our results indicate that the lensing probability is several times higher than previous estimates. If AGNs are indeed the primary formation channel for BBHs, we could quantify the probability of detecting the lensed GW events in such a scenario. The non-detections, on the other hand, will place stricter constraints on the fraction of AGN disk BBHs and even the birthplaces of BBH mergers.

 - **Abstract**
 The mean apparent magnitude of the Qianfan satellites is 5.76 +/- 0.04, while the mean of magnitudes adjusted to a distance of 1,000 km is 5.24 +/- 0.04, based on 1,161 observations. Light curves of several spacecraft display rapid periodic fluctuations which indicate that they are tumbling. Nearly all of the non-tumbling satellite observations can be modeled with diffusely reflecting, Earth-facing surfaces. The Qianfan constellation will impact astronomical research and aesthetic appreciation of the night sky unless their brightness is mitigated.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic AB stars are known to produce periodic radio pulses by the electron cyclotron maser emission (ECME) mechanism. Only 19 such stars, known as 'Main-sequence Radio Pulse emitters' (MRPs) are currently known. The majority of MRPs have been discovered through targeted observation campaigns that involve carefully selecting a sample of stars that are likely to produce ECME, and which can be detected by a given telescope within reasonable amount of time. These selection criteria inadvertently introduce bias in the resulting sample of MRPs, which affects subsequent investigation of the relation between ECME properties and stellar magnetospheric parameters. The alternative is to use all-sky surveys. Until now, MRP candidates obtained from surveys were identified based on their high circular polarisation ($\gtrsim 30\%$). In this paper, we introduce a complementary strategy, which does not require polarisation information. Using multi-epoch data from the Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) telescope, we identify four MRP candidates based on the variability in the total intensity light curves. Follow-up observations with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) confirm three of them to be MRPs, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of our strategy. With the expanded sample, we find that ECME is affected by temperature and the magnetic field strength, consistent with past results. There is, however, a degeneracy regarding how the two parameters govern the ECME luminosity for magnetic A and late-B stars (effective temperature $\lesssim 16$ kK). The current sample is also inadequate to investigate the role of stellar rotation, which has been shown to play a key role in driving incoherent radio emission.

 - **Abstract**
 The Phocaea asteroid family, one of the large ancient families located in the inner main belt, may be the sources of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) due to the nearby 3:1 mean motion resonance with Jupiter, the v6 secular resonance, and the Yarkovsky and YORP effects. Thus, understanding the influence of the Yarkovsky and YORP effects on the Phocaea family is one of the keys to figuring out the source of NEAs. However, the physical properties of most of the Phocaea family members are unknown at present. We perform a photometric analysis for 44 asteroids in the Phocaea region using photometric data obtained by ground-based and space-based telescopes (i.e., TESS and Gaia). Based on the derived physical properties, we find significant footprints of the Yarkovsky and YORP effects on the Phocaea family members. Selecting five asteroids nearby the inside boundary of the V-shape in the absolute-magnitude semimajor-axis (H, a) space, we estimate their densities considering their migration in semimajor-axis arises from the Yarkovsky effect. The bulk density of (852) Wladilena ({3.54 g/cm3) suggests a link to the H chondrite meteorites. Incorporating the grain density of the H chondrites, we estimate the macroporosities of the asteroids (290) Bruna, (1164) Kobolda, and (587) Hypsipyle, respectively 41%, 47%, and 65%, implying rubble pile structures. Considering the H chondrites link to asteroid (25) Phocaea, we suggest the parent body of the Phocaea family has been composed of H chondrite like material and the Phocaea family may be one of the sources of H chondrite meteorites.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of an actinide-boost, very metal-poor ($\left[\mathrm{Fe/H} \right]=-2.38$), $r$-process-enhanced ($\left[\mathrm{Eu/Fe} \right]=0.80$) star, LAMOST J0804+5740, within the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE). Based on the high-resolution ($R\sim36,000\; and \;60,000$) and high signal-to-noise ratio spectra obtained with the High Dispersion Spectrograph on the Subaru Telescope, the abundances of 48 species are determined. Its $\log\epsilon\rm(\mathrm{Th}/\mathrm{Eu}) = -0.22 $ establishes it as the first confirmed actinide-boost star within the GSE. Comparative analysis of its abundance pattern with theoretical $r$-process models reveals that the magnetorotationally driven jet supernova $r$-process model with $\hat{L}v$ = 0.2 provides the best fit and successfully reproduces the actinide-boost signature. Kinematic analysis of actinide-boost stars reveals that approximately two-thirds of them are classified as $\textit{ex-situ}$ stars, suggesting that actinide-boost stars are more likely to originate from accreted dwarf galaxies. As the first actinide-boost star identified within the GSE, J0804+5740 will provide valuable insights into $r$-process nucleosynthesis in accreted dwarf galaxies like the GSE, especially on the production of the heaviest elements.

 - **Abstract**
 Flows around compact objects are necessarily transonic. Due to their dissipative nature, finding of sonic points is not trivial. Becker and Le in 2003 (BL03) proposed a novel methodology to obtain global transonic solutions, using iterative relaxation technique and exploiting the inner boundary conditions of the central object. In the current work, we propose a generic methodology -- IRM-SP and IRM-SHOCK to obtain any class of global accretion and wind solutions, given a set of constants of motion. We have considered viscosity in the system, which transports angular momentum outwards. In addition, it heats the system. Radiative processes like bremsstrahlung which cools the system is also incorporated. An interplay between heating and cooling process, along with gravity and centrifugal forces gives rise to multiple sonic points and hence shocks. The proposed methodology successfully generates any class of accretion as well as wind solutions, allowing us to unify them. Additionally, we report here rigorously the mathematical as well as the computational algorithm needed, to find sonic point(s) and thus obtain global transonic flows around compact objects.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding cosmic ray (CR) diffusion in a partially ionized medium is both crucial and challenging. In this study, we investigate CR superdiffusion in turbulent, partially ionized media using high-resolution 3D two-fluid simulations that treat ions and neutrals separately. We examine the influence of neutral-ion decoupling and the associated damping of turbulence on CR propagation in both transonic and supersonic conditions. Our simulations demonstrate that neutral-ion decoupling significantly damps velocity, density, and magnetic field fluctuations at small scales, producing spectral slopes steeper than those of Kolmogorov and Burgers scaling. We also identify an intermediate coupling regime in which neutrals remain partially coupled with ions, leading to a steepening of kinetic energy spectra in both fluids. Shocks can enhance the neutral-ion coupling, thereby reducing the differences between neutral and ion density structures. Moreover, the damping of magnetic field fluctuations substantially decreases pitch angle scattering, which increases CR parallel mean free paths. As a result, CR perpendicular transport transitions between two distinct superdiffusive regimes: a scattering-dominated regime with perpendicular displacement proportional to $t^{3/4}$, and a scattering-free regime dominated by magnetic field line wandering, with perpendicular displacement scaling as $t^{3/2}$. When the pitch angle is large, the effects of magnetic mirroring, naturally arising in magnetohydrodynamic turbulence, become significant, enhancing the confinement (but not fully trapping) of CRs and inducing oscillations in their perpendicular displacement. These results highlight the necessity of incorporating two-fluid effects for accurately modeling CR transport in partially ionized environments such as molecular clouds and dense interstellar clumps.

 - **Abstract**
 3D Galactic magnetic fields are critical for understanding the interstellar medium, Galactic foreground polarization, and the propagation of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. Leveraging recent theoretical insights into anisotropic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, we introduce a deep learning framework to predict the full 3D magnetic field structure-including the plane-of-sky (POS) position angle, line-of-sight (LOS) inclination, magnetic field strength, sonic Mach number ($M_s$), and Alfvén Mach number ($M_A$)-from spectroscopic H~I observations. The deep learning model is trained on synthetic H~I emission data generated from multiphase 3D MHD simulations. We then apply the trained model to observational data from the Commensal Radio Astronomy FAST Survey, presenting maps of 3D magnetic field orientation, magnetic field strength, $M_s$, and $M_A$ for two H~I clouds, a low-velocity cloud (LVC) and an intermediate-velocity cloud (IVC), which overlap in the POS yet reside at different LOS distances. The deep-learning-predicted POS magnetic field position angles align closely with those determined using the velocity gradient technique, whose integrated results are consistent with independent measurements from Planck 353~GHz polarization data. This study demonstrates the potential of deep learning approaches as powerful tools for modeling the 3D distributions of 3D Galactic magnetic fields and turbulence properties throughout the Galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 The interstellar medium (ISM) consists of a multiphase gas, including the warm neutral medium (WNM), the unstable neutral medium (UNM), and the cold neutral medium (CNM). While significant attention has been devoted to understanding the WNM and CNM, the formation of a substantial fraction of the UNM, with temperatures ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand Kelvin, remains less well understood. In this study, we present three-dimensional hydrodynamical and magnetohydrodynamical simulations of turbulent multiphase ISM to investigate the roles of turbulence and magnetic fields in regulating the multiphase ISM. Our results confirm that turbulence is crucial in redistributing energy and producing the UNM. The turbulent mixing effect smooths the phase diagram, flattens the pressure-density relationship, and increases the fraction of gas in the UNM. We find that magnetic fields not only contribute to sustaining the UNM but also influence the dynamics and distribution of gas across all phases. Magnetic fields introduce anisotropy to the turbulent cascade, reducing the efficiency of turbulent mixing in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field. We find the anisotropy results in a less flat phase diagram compared to hydrodynamical cases. Furthermore, the inclusion of magnetic fields shallowens the second-order velocity structure functions across multiple ISM phases, suggesting that more small-scale fluctuations are driven. These fluctuations contribute to the formation of the UNM by altering the energy cascade and thermodynamic properties of the gas. Our findings suggest that the combined effects of turbulence and magnetic fields are important in regulating the multiphase ISM.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar Orbiter conducted a series of flare-optimised observing campaigns in 2024 utilising the Major Flare Solar Orbiter Observing Plan (SOOP). Dedicated observations were performed during two distinct perihelia intervals in March/April and October, during which over 22 flares were observed, ranging from B- to M-class. These campaigns leveraged high-resolution and high-cadence observations from the mission's remote-sensing suite, including the High-Resolution EUV Imager (EUI/HRI_EUV), the Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX), the Spectral Imaging of the Coronal Environment (SPICE) spectrometer, and the High Resolution Telescope of the Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager (PHI/HRT), as well as coordinated ground-based and Earth-orbiting observations. EUI/HRI_EUV operating in short-exposure modes, provided two-second-cadence, non-saturated EUV images, revealing structures and dynamics on scales not previously observed. Simultaneously, STIX captured hard X-ray imaging and spectroscopy of accelerated electrons, while SPICE acquired EUV slit spectroscopy to probe chromospheric and coronal responses. Together, these observations offer an unprecedented view of magnetic reconnection, energy release, particle acceleration, and plasma heating across a broad range of temperatures and spatial scales. These campaigns have generated a rich dataset that will be the subject of numerous future studies addressing Solar Orbiter's top-level science goal: "How do solar eruptions produce energetic particle radiation that fills the heliosphere?". This paper presents the scientific motivations, operational planning, and observational strategies behind the 2024 flare campaigns, along with initial insights into the observed flares. We also discuss lessons learned for optimizing future Solar Orbiter Major Flare campaigns and provide a resource for researchers aiming to utilize these unique observations.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of high-resolution spectra from the shock-heated plasmas in SN~1987A, based on an observation using the Resolve instrument onboard the X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM).The 1.7--10 keV Resolve spectra are accurately represented by a single component, plane-parallel shock plasma model, with a temperature of $2.84_{-0.08}^{+0.09}$ keV and an ionization parameter of $2.64_{-0.45}^{+0.58} \times 10^{11}$ s cm$^{-3}$.The Resolve spectra are also well reproduced by the 3-D magneto-hydrodynamic simulation presented by Orlando et al. (2020) suggesting substantial contribution from the this http URL metal abundances obtained with Resolve align with the LMC value, indicating that the X-rays in 2024 originate from non-metal-rich shock-heated ejecta and the reverse shock has not reached the inner metal-rich region of this http URL widths of the atomic lines from Si, S, and Fe correspond to velocities of 1,500--1,700 km s$^{-1}$, where the thermal broadening effects in this non-metal-rich plasma are negligible. Therefore, the line broadening seen in Resolve spectra is determined by the large bulk motion of ejecta. For reference, we determined a 90\% upper limit on non-thermal emission from a pulsar wind nebula at $4.3 \times 10^{-13}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in the 2 -- 10 keV range, aligning with NuSTAR findings by Greco et al. (2022). Additionally, we searched for the $^{44}$Sc K line feature and found a $1\sigma$ upper limit of $1.0 \times 10^{-6}$ photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, which translates to an initial $^{44}$Ti mass of approximately $2 \times 10^{-4} M_{\odot}$, consistent with previous X-ray to soft gamma-ray observations (Boggs et al. 2015; Grebenev et al. 2012; Leising 2006).

 - **Abstract**
 Plages are small concentrations of strong, nearly vertical magnetic fields in the solar photosphere that expand with height. A high spatial and spectral resolution that can resolve their fine structure is required to characterize them, and spectropolarimetric capabilities are needed to infer their magnetic fields. We constrain the 3D fine structure of the magnetic field in the photosphere of a solar plage from a unique spectropolarimetric dataset with a very high spatial and spectral resolution and a fast temporal cadence. We analyzed spectropolarimetric observations of a solar plage in the two magnetically sensitive spectral lines of neutral iron around 630 nm. The observations were obtained with MiHI, which is an integral field unit attached to the Swedish Solar Telescope. MiHI obtained diffraction-limited, high-cadence observations with high spectral fidelity. These observations were interpreted using the spectropolarimetric inversion with magnetohydrostatic constraints, which allowed us to recover the magnetic and thermodynamic structure of the plage on a geometrical scale. The inversion results reveal that the magnetic field can reach up to 2 kG and that it expands significantly from the deep to the mid-photosphere. Weaker (200 G), and very small (subarcsecond) vertical magnetic loops lie beneath this canopy, rooted in the photosphere. This novel picture of a solar plage, in which weak opposite-polarity field patches surround the main polarity, provides new insight into convection in strongly magnetized plasma.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the discovery of a peculiar X-ray transient, EP241021a, by the Einstein Probe (EP) mission, and the results from multiwavelength follow-up observations. The transient was first detected with the Wide-field X-ray Telescope as an intense flare lasting for ~100 s, reaching a luminosity of L_(0.5-4 keV)~10^48 erg/s at z=0.748. Further observations with EP's Follow-up X-ray Telescope reveal a huge drop in the X-ray flux by a factor of >1000 within 1.5 days. After maintaining a nearly plateau phase for ~7 days, the X-ray flux declines as t^-1.2 over a period of ~30 days, followed by a sudden decrease to an undetectable level by EP and XMM-Newton, making it the longest afterglow emission detected among known fast X-ray transients. A bright counterpart at optical and radio wavelengths was also detected, with high peak luminosities in excess of 10^44 erg/s and 10^41 erg/s, respectively. In addition, EP241021a exhibits a non-thermal X-ray spectrum, red optical color, X-ray and optical rebrightenings in the light curves, and fast radio spectral evolution, suggesting that relativistic jets may have been launched. We discuss possible origins of EP241021a, including a choked jet with supernova shock breakout, a merger-triggered magnetar, a highly structured jet, and a repeating partial tidal disruption event involving an intermediate-mass black hole, but none can perfectly explain the multiwavelength properties. EP241021a may represent a new type of X-ray transients with months-duration evolution timescales, and future EP detections and follow-up observations of similar systems will provide statistical samples to understand the underlying mechanisms at work.
#### The Effect of Luminosity Outbursts on the Abundance of Pebbles and Their Ice Mantles in Protoplanetary Disks

 - **Abstract**
 Centimeter-sized dust grains-pebbles-are necessary for planetesimal formation via the streaming instability, they play an important role in forming protoplanetary cores and giant planets, as well as enriching their atmospheres with chemical elements. This work investigates the effect of luminosity outbursts on the abundance of pebbles and their ice mantles in protoplanetary disks. We perform global simulations of formation and evolution of a self-gravitating viscous protoplanetary disk using the 2D hydrodynamic thin-disk FEOSAD code, which self-consistently reproduces luminosity outbursts. The model includes thermal balance, dust evolution and its interaction with gas, development of magnetorotational instability, adsorption and desorption of four volatile compounds (H$_2$O, CO$_2$, CH$_4$ and CO), and the feedback of ice mantles on dust fragmentation properties. We show that luminosity outbursts have a stronger effect on the positions of CO$_2$, CH$_4$ and CO snowlines compared to the water snowline. This is because the H$_2$O snowline falls within the viscous heating dominated region during early disk evolution stages, while snowlines of other molecules are located in regions dominated by stellar irradiation heating and are thus more sensitive to temperature changes during outbursts. Nevertheless, luminosity outbursts reduce the total amount of pebbles in the disk by half due to destruction of dust aggregates into monomers following the loss of water ice that binds the aggregates together. Pebble recovery occurs over several thousand years after the outburst ends due to collisional coagulation, with recovery timescales significantly exceeding water freeze-out times. Ice mantle desorption occurs in a complex non-axisymmetric 2D region of the disk, associated with spiral substructure formation during early evolution of gravitationally unstable disks.

 - **Abstract**
 Dwarf AGN serve as the ideal systems for identifying intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs) down to the most elusive regimes ($\sim 10^3 - 10^4 M_{\odot}$). However, the ubiquitously metal-poor nature of dwarf galaxies gives rise to ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) that can mimic the spectral signatures of IMBH excitation. We present a novel photoionization model suite that simultaneously incorporates IMBHs and ULXs in a metal-poor, highly star-forming environment. We account for changes in $M_{BH}$ according to formation seeding channels and metallicity, and changes in ULX populations with post-starburst age and metallicity. We find that broadband X-rays and UV emission lines are insensitive to $M_{BH}$ and largely unable to distinguish between ULXs and IMBHs. Many optical diagnostic diagrams cannot correctly identify dwarf AGN. The notable exceptions include He~II~$\lambda$4686 and [O~I]~$\lambda$6300, for which we redefine typical demarcations to account for ULX contributions. Emission lines in the mid-IR show the most promise in separating stellar, ULX, IMBH, and shock excitation while presenting sensitivity to $M_{BH}$ and $f_{\text{AGN}}$. Overall, our results expose the potential biases in identifying and characterizing dwarf AGN purely on strong line ratios and diagnostic diagrams rather than holistically evaluating the entire spectrum. As a proof of concept, we argue that recently discovered over-massive BHs in high-$z$ JWST AGN might not represent the overall BH population, with many galaxies in these samples potentially being falsely classified as purely star-forming.

 - **Abstract**
 Stars form from molecular gas under complex conditions influenced by multiple competing physical mechanisms, such as gravity, turbulence, and magnetic fields. However, accurately identifying the fraction of gas actively involved in star formation remains challenging. Using dust continuum observations from the Herschel Space Observatory, we derived column density maps and their associated probability distribution functions (N-PDFs). Assuming the power-law component in the N-PDFs corresponds to gravitationally bound (and thus star-forming) gas, we analyzed a diverse sample of molecular clouds spanning a wide range of mass and turbulence conditions. This sample included 21 molecular clouds from the solar neighborhood ($d<$500 pc) and 16 high-mass star-forming molecular clouds. For these two groups, we employed the counts of young stellar objects (YSOs) and mid-/far-infrared luminosities as proxies for star formation rates (SFR), respectively. Both groups revealed a tight linear correlation between the mass of gravitationally bound gas and the SFR, suggesting a universally constant star formation efficiency in the gravitationally bound gas phase. The star-forming gas mass derived from threshold column densities ($N_{\mbox {threshold}}$) varies from cloud to cloud and is widely distributed over the range of $\sim$1--17$\times$10$^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$ based on N-PDF analysis. But in solar neighborhood clouds, it is in rough consistency with the traditional approach using $A_{\rm V}$ $\ge$ 8 mag. In contrast, in high turbulent regions (e.g., the Central Molecular Zone) where the classical approach fails, the gravitationally bound gas mass and SFR still follow the same correlation as other high-mass star-forming regions in the Milky Way. Our findings also strongly support the interpretation that gas in the power-law component of the N-PDF is undergoing self-gravitational collapse to form stars.
#### Why is the Star Formation Rate Proportional to Dense Gas Mass?

 - **Abstract**
 One of the most profound empirical laws of star formation is the Gao-Solomon relation, a linear correlation between the star formation rate (SFR) and the dense molecular gas mass. It is puzzling how the complicated physics in star-formation results in this surprisingly simple proportionality. Using archival Herschel and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Observations, we derived the masses of the most massive cores ($M^{\rm max}_{\rm core}$) and masses of the gravitationally bound gas ($ M_{\rm gas}^{\rm bound}$) in the parent molecular clouds for a sample of low-mass and high-mass star-forming regions. We discovered a significant correlation $\log(M^{\rm max}_{\rm core}/M_{\odot}) = 0.506 \log(M_{\rm gas}^{\rm bound}/M_{\odot})-0.32$. Our discovered $M^{\rm max}_{\rm core}$-$M_{\rm gas}^{\rm bound}$ correlation can be approximately converted to the Gao-Solomon relation if there is (1) a constant 30% efficiency of converting $M^{\rm max}_{\rm core}$ to the mass of the most massive star ($m^{\rm max}_{\rm star}$), and (2) if SFR and $m^{\rm max}_{\rm star}$ are tightly related through $\log({\rm SFR}/(M_{\odot} {\rm yr}^{-1})) = 2.04 \log(m^{\rm max}_{\rm star}/M_{\odot})-5.80$. Intriguingly, both requirements have been suggested by previous theoretical studies (c.f. Yan et al. 2017). Based on this result, we hypothesize that the Gao-Solomon relation is a consequence of combining the following three non-trivial relations (i) SFR vs. $m^{\rm max}_{\rm star}$, (ii) $m^{\rm max}_{\rm star}$ vs. $M^{\rm max}_{\rm core}$, and (iii) $M^{\rm max}_{\rm core}$ vs. $M_{\rm gas}^{\rm bound}$. This finding may open a new possibility to understand the Gao-Solomon relation in an analytic sense.
