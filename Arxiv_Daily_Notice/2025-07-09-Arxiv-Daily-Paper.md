 - **Abstract**
 Next-generation radio telescopes will provide unprecedented data volumes of the neutral hydrogen (HI) distribution across cosmic time. Combining weak lensing surveys with spatial and kinematic observations of HI could help constrain key properties of dark matter, such as its mass, clustering behavior, and spatial distribution. However, inferring dark matter properties from HI observations is challenging because of processes related to galaxy formation, such as stellar feedback. Methods that use empirical relations, often calibrated via numerical simulations, do not use full field-level information to model the complex relation between dark matter and HI. We address this shortcoming with a data-driven approach, leveraging the recently introduced EMBER-2 model to learn the HI-dark matter mapping at the field level for a wide redshift range, z=6-0. After training on cosmological galaxy formation simulations run with FIRE-2, EMBER-2 accurately recovers key statistics, including dark matter mass fractions and surface density profiles. The HI-dark matter density cross-correlation is reconstructed at an accuracy of 10% down to scales of k = 100 h/cMpc, a significant improvement over traditional approaches. The presented method may become a key ingredient in future inference pipelines as it can be readily integrated into downstream analysis tasks of radio surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 The nuclear transient eRASSt J012026.5-292727 (J012026 hereafter) was discovered in the second SRG/eROSITA all-sky survey (eRASS2). The source appeared more than one order of magnitude brighter than the eRASS1 upper limits (peak eRASS2 0.2-2.3 keV flux of 1.14 x 10^-12 erg cm^-2 s^-1), and with a soft X-ray spectrum (photon index Gamma = 4.3). Over the following months, the X-ray flux started decaying, with significant flaring activity on both hour- and year-timescales. By inspecting the multiwavelength light curves of time-domain wide-field facilities, we detected a strong mid-infrared flare, evolving over 2 years, and a weaker optical counterpart. Follow-up optical spectroscopy revealed transient features, including redshifted Balmer lines (FWHM ~1500 km/s), strong Fe II emission, He II and Bowen lines, and high-ionization iron coronal lines. One spectrum showed a triple-peaked H-beta line, consistent with emission from a face-on elliptical disk. The spectroscopic features and the slow evolution of the event place J012026 within the classifications of Bowen fluorescence flares (BFFs) and extreme coronal line emitters (ECLEs). BFFs have been associated with rejuvenated accreting SMBHs, although the mechanism triggering the onset of the new accretion flow is still unclear, while ECLEs have been linked to the disruption of stars in gas-rich environments. The association of J012026 to both classes, combined with the multi-wavelength information, suggests that BFFs could be, at least in some cases, due to tidal disruption events (TDEs). The observed X-ray variability, uncommon in standard TDEs, adds complexity to these families of nuclear transients. These results highlight the diverse phenomenology of nuclear accretion events and demonstrate the value of systematic X-ray surveys, such as eROSITA and Einstein Probe, for uncovering such transients and characterizing their physical origin.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultramassive white dwarfs (UMWDs; defined by masses $\gtrsim 1.1\,{\rm M}_\odot$) are prime targets for seismology, because they pass through the ZZ Ceti instability strip at the same time that their cores crystallize. Recent studies suggest that crystallization may magnetize white dwarf interiors with a strong magnetic field $B_0$ up to a radius $r_{\rm out}^0$, either through a magnetic dynamo or by transporting a pre-existing fossil field. We demonstrate that seismology can probe these buried fields before they break out at the surface, because even the weak exponential tail of the outwardly diffusing field can disrupt the propagation of gravity waves near the surface. Based on the observed oscillation modes of WD J0135+5722 - the richest pulsating UMWD to date - we constrain its surface field $B_{\rm surf}\lesssim 2\,\textrm{kG}$. We solve the induction equation and translate this to an upper limit on the internal field $B_0$. For a carbon-oxygen (CO) core we find $B_{\rm surf}\ll B_0\lesssim 0.6\,\textrm{MG}$, consistent with the crystallization dynamo theory. For an oxygen-neon (ONe) core, on the the other hand, $r_{\rm out}^0$ is larger, such that the magnetic field breaks out and $B_{\rm surf}\lesssim B_0\lesssim 7\,\textrm{kG}$. This low magnetic field rules out an ONe composition or, alternatively, an intense dynamo during crystallization or merger. Either way, the imprint of magnetic fields on UMWD seismology may reveal the uncertain composition and formation paths of these stars.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the influence of supernova (SN) feedback on the satellites of elliptical host galaxies using hydrodynamic simulations. Utilizing a modified version of the GADGET-3 code, we perform cosmological zoom-in simulations of 11 elliptical galaxies with stellar masses in the range $10^{11} M_{\odot} < M_{*} < 2 \times 10^{11} M_{\odot}$. We conduct two sets of simulations with identical initial conditions: the Fiducial model, which includes a three-phase SN mechanical wind, and the weak SN feedback model, where nearly all SN energy is released as thermal energy with a reduced SN wind velocity. Our comparison shows minimal differences in the elliptical host galaxies, but significant variations in the physical properties of satellite galaxies. The weak SN feedback model produces a larger number of satellite galaxies compared to the Fiducial model, and significantly more than observed. For satellite galaxies with stellar masses above $10^{8}$ $M_{\odot}$, the weak SN feedback model generates approximately five times more satellites than observed in the xSAGA survey. Most of these overproduced satellites have small stellar masses, below $10^{10}$ $M_{\odot}$. Additionally, satellites in the weak SN feedback model are about 3.5 times more compact than those observed in the SAGA survey and the Fiducial model, with metallicities nearly 1 dex higher than observed values. In conclusion, the satellite galaxies in the Fiducial model, which includes mechanical SN feedback, exhibit properties more closely aligned with observations. This underscores the necessity of incorporating both mechanical AGN and SN feedback to reproduce the observed properties of elliptical galaxy and their satellites in simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are believed to play a central role in quenching star formation by removing or destroying molecular gas from host galaxies via radiation-pressure driven outflows and/or radio jets. Some studies of cold molecular gas in galaxies at Cosmic Noon ($z\sim2$) show that AGN have less cold gas ($<$100 K) compared to mass-matched star-forming galaxies. However, cold gas could also be shock-heated to warmer phases, detectable via H$_{2}$ transitions in the rest-frame near- and mid-infrared spectra. The Medium Resolution Spectrograph (MRS) of the Mid-infrared Instrument (MIRI) aboard JWST has opened a unique window to observe these emission lines in galaxies at Cosmic Noon. We present the first detection of hot molecular gas in cid_346, an X-ray AGN at $z\sim2.2$, via the H$_{2}$ ro-vibrational transition at 2.12 $\mu$m. We measure a hot molecular gas mass of $\sim 8.0 \times 10^{5}$ M$_{\odot}$, which is $\sim 10^{5}-10^{6}$ times lower than the cold molecular gas mass. cid_346 is located in an environment with extended gas structures and satellite galaxies. This is supported by detection of hot and cold molecular gas out to distances $>$10 kpc in MIRI/MRS and ALMA data, respectively and ancillary NIRCam imaging that reveals two satellite galaxies at distances of $\sim$0.4 arcsec (3.3 kpc) and $\sim$0.9 arcsec (7.4 kpc) from the AGN. Our results tentatively indicate that while the CO(3-2)-based cold gas phase dominates the molecular gas mass at Cosmic Noon, H$_{2}$ ro-vibrational transitions are effective in tracing hot molecular gas locally in regions that may lack CO emission.

 - **Abstract**
 Integral field spectroscopy (IFS) offers a distinct advantage for studying extended sources by enabling spatially resolved emission maps for several emission lines without the need for specific filters. This study conducts a detailed analysis of iron and nickel emission lines in 12 planetary nebulae (PNe) using integral field unit (IFU) data from MUSE to provide insights into their formation and evolution mechanisms. New diagnostic line ratios, combined with machine-learning algorithms, were used to distinguish excitation mechanisms such as shock and photoionization. Electron densities and elemental abundances were estimated using different atomic data through the PyNeb package. The contribution of fluorescent excitation of nickel lines was also examined. A total of 16 iron- and nickel-rich clumps are detected in seven out of 12 PNe. New clumps are discovered in NGC 3132 and IC 4406. The most prominent lines are [Fe II] 8617 Angstrom and [Ni II] 7378 Angstrom. Both emission lines are observed emanating directly from the low-ionization structures (LIS) of NGC 3242, NGC 7009, and NGC 6153, as well as from clumps in NGC 6369 and Tc 1. Their abundances are found to be below solar values, indicating that a fraction of Fe and Ni remains depleted in dust grains. The depletion factors exhibit a strong correlation over a wide range. A machine-learning approach allows us to classify ten out of 16 clumps as shock-excited and to establish a new shock/photoionization selection criterion: log([Ni II] 7378 Angstrom / H-alpha) and log([Fe II] 8617 Angstrom / H-alpha) greater than -2.20.

 - **Abstract**
 We model the optical and infrared transient ZTF SLRN-2020, previously associated with a star-planet merger. We consider the scenario in which orbital decay via tidal dissipation led to the merger, and find that tidal heating within the star was likely unobservable in the archival image of the system taken $12\mathrm{yr}$ before the merger. The observed dust formation months before the merger is consistent with a planet of mass $M_\mathrm{p} \gtrsim 5M_\mathrm{J}$ ejecting material as it skims the stellar surface. This interaction gradually intensifies, leading to significant mass ejection on a dynamical timescale ($ \approx $ hours) as the planet plunges into the stellar interior. Part of the recombination transient associated with this dynamical mass ejection might be inaccessible to the optical observations because its duration ($ \approx $ hours) is comparable to the cadence. Correspondingly, the observed duration of the transient $\approx100\mathrm{d}$ is inconsistent with a single episode of dynamical mass ejection. Instead, the transient could be powered by the recombination of $ \approx 3.4\times10^{-5}M_\odot $ of hydrogen in an outflow, or the contraction of an inflated envelope of mass $ \approx 10^{-6}M_\odot $ that formed during the merger. The observed ejecta mass $320\mathrm{d}$ after the peak of the optical transient is $ \approx 1.3\times10^{-4}M_\odot$, consistent with the idea that a fraction of the ejecta might be unobservable in the light curve. Energetically, this post-merger ejecta mass suggests a planet at least as massive as Jupiter. Our results suggest that ZTF SLRN-2020 was the result of a merger between a star close to the main sequence and a planet with mass at least several times that of Jupiter.
#### ASASSN-24fw: Candidate circumplanetary disk occultation of a main-sequence star

 - **Abstract**
 Dusty disks around planets in outer reaches of exo-planetary systems can be detected as long-lasting occultations, provided the observer is close to the planet's orbital plane. Here we report follow-up observations of ASASSN-24fw (Gaia 07:05:18.97+06:12:19.4), a 4-magnitude dimming event of a main-sequence star which lasted 8.5 months. Using optical spectroscopy with KOSMOS (APO), MagE (Magellan) and GHOST (Gemini-S), we find strong Na I D absorption indicating that the occulter is gas rich. We detect multiple low-ionization metal emission lines with velocity dispersion <10 km/s blue-shifted by 27 km/sk with respect to the system, which likely originate in the occulter, as well as blue-shifted and broad (200 km/s) Halpha line, which likely originates in the inner circumstellar disk. We confirm the previously reported occultations in 1981 and 1937 seen in historic data, yielding a semi-major axis of the occulter's orbital motion around the star of 14 AU. Assuming that the occulter is a circumplanetary disk filling 30-100% of the Hill radius, we derive the planet's mass of 0.5-19 MJupiter and a circumplanetary disk mass of 1% of the mass of the Moon. Given the age of the star (>2 Gyr), the disk is unlikely to be a survivor of the planet formation stage and is more likely to be a result of a planetary collision. If Na D absorption and metal emission lines originate in the circumplanetary disk, the observations presented here are the first discovery of a planet-driven wind or of circumsecondary disk rotation.

 - **Abstract**
 A fraction of active galactic nuclei (AGN) have double-peaked H$\alpha$, H$\beta$ and Mg II broad lines attributed to emission from rotating gas in the accretion disk. Using optical spectroscopy of a flux-limited sample of AGN selected via ultrahard X-rays from the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey (BASS), we systematically identify 71 double-peaked emitters amongst 343 broad-line AGN with redshifts $0.004<z<0.297$ and 2-10 KeV X-ray luminosities of log 40-45.7 (erg/s), and provide their best-fit accretion disk geometry parameters. We find that ~21% of X-ray selected broad-line AGN are double-peaked emitters (DPEs), consistent with rates previously reported for $z<0.2$ broad-line AGN selected for strong optical variability in ZTF. 11 of 71 DPEs (15%) exhibited a single-peaked Gaussian component to the broad line profile in addition to the double-peaked disk profile. In this sample, DPEs have intrinsically higher masses by ~0.4 dex and lower Eddington ratios by ~0.3 dex than other broad-line AGN, and have a preference for elliptical host galaxies, higher X-ray luminosities, and higher [OI] $\lambda$6302 to narrow H$\alpha$ flux ratios than other broad-line AGN. We find that DPEs are not segregated from other broad-line AGN in the $L_{\rm bol}$ vs $M_{\rm BH}$ relation or their X-ray to radio luminosity ratios, and do not show a preference for intermediate Seyfert types over Seyfert 1s. We do not find differences in a wide range of multi-wavelength properties when comparing DPEs to other broad-line AGN, including optical and mid-IR variability levels, and the rate of changing-look events. We discuss the two populations in the context of multi-component disk-wind models of the AGN broad line region and consider how unrecognized contributions of disk emission to the broad lines introduce biases in virial SMBH mass estimates.
#### Escape fractions from unattenuated Ly$α$ emitters around luminous $z>6$ quasars

 - **Abstract**
 Ionized proximity zones around luminous quasars provide a unique laboratory to characterize the Ly$\alpha$ emission lines from $z>6$ galaxies without significant attenuation from the intergalactic medium (IGM). However, Ly$\alpha$ line measurements for galaxies within high-redshift quasars' proximity zones have been rare so far. Here we present deep spectroscopic observations obtained with the NIRSpec/MSA instrument on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) of galaxies in two $z>6$ quasar fields. We measure the Ly$\alpha$ line fluxes for 50 galaxies at $6<z<7$ with UV absolute magnitude $M_\text{UV}<-19$ (median $M_\text{UV}=-19.97$), among which 15 are located near the luminous quasars, i.e. within $\Delta v<2500\rm\,km\,s^{-1}$. We find that galaxies near the quasars show significant flux bluewards of the systemic Ly$\alpha$ wavelength, and have higher Ly$\alpha$ equivalent width compared to galaxies at similar redshifts that are not located within the quasars' environment. Our result indicates little or no redshift evolution for the Ly$\alpha$-emitter fraction from $z\sim6.4$ to $z\sim5$. Leveraging the low IGM opacity in the quasars' vicinity, we evaluate the Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction ($f_\text{esc}^{\text{Ly}\alpha}$) of high-redshift galaxies. Our analysis suggests that galaxies at $\langle z\rangle\approx6.4$ have an average $f_\text{esc}^{\text{Ly}\alpha}=0.14\pm0.04$. This value is consistent with reionization models where the Lyman continuum escape fraction is low $(f_\text{esc}^\text{LyC}\lesssim0.1)$ for luminous galaxies, and where the most luminous galaxies have only a minor contribution to the total ionizing photon budget.
#### The PARADIGM project II: The lifetimes and quenching of satellites in Milky Way-mass haloes

 - **Abstract**
 The abundance and star-formation histories of satellites of Milky Way (MW)-like galaxies are linked to their hosts' assembly histories. To explore this connection, we use the PARADIGM suite of zoom-in hydrodynamical simulations of MW-mass haloes, evolving the same initial conditions spanning various halo assembly histories with the VINTERGATAN and IllustrisTNG models. Our VINTERGATAN simulations overpredict the number of satellites compared to observations (and to IllustrisTNG) due to a higher $M_{*}$ at fixed $M_{\rm halo}$. Despite this difference, the two models show good qualitative agreement for both satellite disruption fractions and timescales, and quenching. The number of satellites rises rapidly until $z=1$ and then remains nearly constant. The fraction of satellites from each epoch that are disrupted by $z=0$ decreases steadily from nearly 100% to 0% during $4>z>0.1$. These fractions are higher for VINTERGATAN than IllustrisTNG, except for massive satellites ($M_{*}>10^{7}\,M_{\odot}$) at $z>0.5$. This difference is largely due to varying distributions of pericentric distance, orbital period and number of orbits, in turn determined by which sub(haloes) are populated with galaxies by the two models. The time between accretion and disruption also remains approximately constant over $2>z>0.3$ at $6-8$ Gyr. For surviving satellites at $z=0$, both models recover the observed trend of massive satellites quenching more recently ($<8$ Gyr ago) and within $1.5\,r_{\rm 200c}$ of the host, while low mass satellites quench earlier and often outside the host. Our results provide constraints on satellite accretion, quenching and disruption timescales, while highlighting the convergent trends from two very different galaxy formation models.
#### Is Earendel a Star Cluster?: Metal Poor Globular Cluster Progenitors at $z\sim6$

 - **Abstract**
 The strongly-lensed $z\sim 6$ Sunrise galaxy offers an incredible opportunity to investigate star formation in the early universe on parsec or smaller scales. The highly magnified object Earendel within the Sunrise was previously identified as a candidate star or binary due to size constraints placed by the lensing magnification, however recent works have suggested this constraint may be relaxed to even the size of star clusters. Here, we explore the hypothesis that Earendel may actually be a star cluster, and simultaneously evaluate other star clusters within the host galaxy. Leveraging deep, archival James Webb Space Telescope NIRSpec PRISM spectroscopy, we determine a spectroscopic redshift for the Sunrise galaxy $z=5.926 \pm 0.013$, and we fit simple stellar population (SSP) models from three premier libraries to evaluate the physical parameters of Earendel and another distinct star cluster in the Sunrise dubbed `$1b$'. We find the rest-UV through optical continuum of Earendel to be well-described by an SSP, nearly equivalently to $1b$ which is confidently a star cluster. We infer they have intermediate ages $t_{\rm age}\sim 30$--$150\,$Myr, are metal poor ($Z_\star\lesssim10\%\,Z_\odot$), and are consistent with the formation age-metallicity trend seen in local globular clusters. Such intermediate age clusters are seldom probed spectroscopically in the high redshift universe, and we explore the extent to which these clusters can be characterized via the spectroscopic continuum.

 - **Abstract**
 We prove that the spin-aligned electromagnetic recoil force acting on a pulsar vanishes identically in Force-Free Electrodynamics. This contrasts with Hirai et al.'s recent argument that the rocket effect was important for explaining the eccentricity distribution of wide neutron star binaries found by Gaia. Our detailed analysis confirms that for a broad range of initial conditions and natal kick distributions, the rocket velocities of $v_r \gtrsim 30\, \mathrm{km/s}$ are required to account for the observed eccentricities. However, we find that in scenarios where the common envelope phase does not significantly shrink the initial orbit, and the natal kicks are drawn from Paczynski-type distribution, these eccentricities may arise without the influence of an EM rocket. If the natal kicks are perpendicular to the initial orbits, then explaining the Gaia neutron star eccentricities without invoking rockets additionally requires that the pre-supernova binaries avoid significant circularization, and that the mass loss during the supernova is minimal. The rocket effect can only be substantial in "weak" pulsars, where pair production near the light cylinder is suppressed and ${\bf E}\cdot{\bf B} \neq 0$ in the outer magnetosphere. We derive a rough estimate for a rocket force in a weak pulsar and relate it to the pulsar's radiative efficiency; simulations are needed to obtain numerically reliable expressions. If future observations prove that rockets are required to explain the data, this would imply that Gaia neutron stars are $\gtrsim $ Myr old, were previously rapidly spinning and are weakly magnetized, with a dipole field $\lesssim 10^{10}$ G and a relatively strong quadrupole component.
#### Axion-like Particles and their Possible Impact on the Very High-Energy Spectrum of M87 Observed by LHAASO

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of very high-energy (VHE) gamma rays from the active galaxy M87 by LHAASO, showing a possible spectral hardening around $20$ TeV, motivates the search for new physics beyond standard emission models. One promising candidate is axion-like particles (ALPs), hypothetical pseudo-scalar bosons that can oscillate into photons in the presence of cosmic magnetic fields. In this work, we investigate whether photon-ALP oscillations and an additional ALP-induced component can account for the tentative hardening observed in M87's VHE spectrum. We model the propagation of photons and ALPs through the jet, the Virgo cluster, the intergalactic medium, and the Galactic magnetic field, over a broad ALPs parameter space. Our statistical analysis finds that, with current LHAASO data, the inclusion of an ALPs component yields only a modest improvement over a standard scenario (maximum significance $\sim$1.56$\sigma$). However, if future observations transform current flux upper limits at tens of TeV into measured fluxes, the significance could reach $\sim$3$\sigma$, providing potential evidence for ALP-induced effects. Our results suggest that M87 remains a promising target to test fundamental physics, and upcoming VHE data could play a key role in probing ALPs parameter space.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent discoveries show that asteroids spinning in less than a few minutes undergo sizeable semi-major-axis drifts, possibly driven by the Yarkovsky effect. Analytical formulas can match these drifts only if very low thermal inertia is assumed, implying a dust-fine regolith or a highly porous interior that is difficult to retain under such extreme centrifugal forces. With analytical theories of the Yarkovsky effect resting on a set of assumptions, their applicability to cases of super-fast rotation should be verified. We aim to evaluate the validity of the analytical models in such scenarios and to determine whether the Yarkovsky effect can explain the observed drift in rapidly rotating asteroids. We have developed a numerical model of the Yarkovsky effect tailored to super-fast rotators. The code resolves micrometre-scale thermal waves on millisecond time steps, capturing the steep gradients that arise when surface thermal inertia is extremely low. A new 3-D heat-conduction and photon-recoil solver is benchmarked against the THERMOBS thermophysical code and the analytical solution of the Yarkovsky effect, over a range of rotation periods and thermal conductivities. The analytical Yarkovsky drift agrees well with the numerical solver. For thermal conductivities from $0.0001$ to $1$ $\mathrm{Wm^{-1}K^{-1}}$ and spin periods as short as 10 s, the two solutions differ by no more than $15\%$. Applied to the 34-s rapid rotator 2016 GE1, the best match of the measured drift is obtained with $\Gamma\lesssim20$ $\mathrm{Jm^{-2}K^{-1}s^{-1/2}}$, a value that implies $\sim100$ K temperature swings each spin cycle. This confirms that the observed semi-major axis drifts for super-fast rotators can be explained by the Yarkovsky effect and very low thermal inertia, which might point to rapid thermal fatigue as a regolith-generation mechanism.

 - **Abstract**
 We present 0.3-21mic observations at ~275d and ~400d for Type II supernova (SN) 2024ggi, combining ground-based optical and near-infrared data from the Keck I/II telescopes and space-based infrared data from the James Webb Space Telescope. Although the optical regions dominate the observed flux, SN2024ggi is bright at infrared wavelengths (65%/35% falls each side of 1mic). SN2024ggi exhibits a plethora of emission lines from H, He, intermediate-mass elements (O, Na, Mg, S, Ar, Ca), and iron-group elements (IGEs; Fe, Co, and Ni) -- all lines have essentially the same width, suggesting efficient macroscopic chemical mixing of the inner ejecta at <~2000km/s and little mixing of 56Ni at larger velocities. Molecular emission in the infrared range is dominated by the CO fundamental, which radiates about 5% of the total SN luminosity. A molecule-free radiative-transfer model based on a standard red-supergiant star explosion (i.e., ~1e51erg, 0.06Msun of 56Ni from a 15.2Msun progenitor) yields a satisfactory match throughout the optical and infrared at both epochs. The SN2024ggi CO luminosity is comparable to the fractional decay-power absorbed in the model C/O-rich shell -- accounting for CO cooling would likely resolve the model overestimate of the [OI]0.632mic flux. The relative weakness of the molecular emission in SN2024ggi and the good overall match obtained with our molecule-free model suggests negligible microscopic mixing -- about 95% of the SN luminosity is radiated by atoms and ions. Lines from IGEs, which form from explosion ashes at such late times, are ideal diagnostics of the magnitude of 56Ni mixing in core-collapse SN ejecta. Stable Ni, clearly identified in SN2024ggi (e.g., [NiII]6.634mic), is probably a common product of massive-star explosions.

 - **Abstract**
 IceCube-Gen2 is a proposed neutrino observatory at the South Pole that will build on the success of IceCube and will also serve as a unique detector for cosmic-ray air showers. Analogous to the IceTop surface array over IceCube's deep optical detector, IceCube-Gen2 will also feature a surface array above the optical array deep in the ice. As improvement over IceTop, the IceCube-Gen2 surface array will be comprised of elevated detectors to avoid snow coverage, and will combine two types of detectors: scintillation panels that measure air-shower particles on ground and enable a low detection threshold, which is important to serve as a veto for selecting downgoing neutrino candidates, and radio antennas which increase the measurement accuracy for air showers by providing a calorimetric measurement of the electromagnetic shower component and its depth of maximum, $X_\mathrm{max}$. As another major advantage, the eight times larger surface area combined with a larger field of view will provide a 30-fold increase for the aperture of surface-deep coincident events. With these improvements in statistics and measurement accuracy, IceCube-Gen2 will thus make unique contributions to the particle physics and astrophysics of Galactic cosmic rays in the PeV to EeV energy range, including the search for PeV photon sources. This proceeding summarizes the technical design and science case enabled by the IceCube-Gen2 Surface Array.

 - **Abstract**
 Photodissociation regions (PDRs) exhibit emission between 3-20 um known as the Aromatic Infrared Bands (AIBs), originating from small carbonaceous species such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The AIB spectra observed in Galactic PDRs, such as the Orion Bar observations by the PDRs4All JWST program, are considered a local analog for those seen in extragalactic star-forming regions. We present the Python version of PAHFIT, a spectral decomposition tool that separates the contributions by AIB subcomponents, thermal dust emission, gas lines, stellar light, and dust extinction. By fitting segments of the Orion Bar spectra, we provide a configuration to decompose JWST spectra of PDRs in detail. The resulting central wavelengths and FWHM of the AIB subcomponents are compiled into a "PDR pack" for PAHFIT. We applied PAHFIT with this PDR pack and the default continuum model to spectra of the central star forming ring of the galaxy NGC7469. We introduce an alternate dust continuum model to fit the Orion Bar spectra, as the default PAHFIT continuum model mismatches the intensity at 15-26 um. PAHFIT fits with the PDR pack and the alternate continuum model reproduce the Orion Bar spectra with residuals of a few percent, and similar performance is achieved for the NGC7469 spectra. We provide PAHFIT-based diagnostics that trace the profile variations of the 3.3, 3.4, 5.7, 6.2, and 7.7 um AIBs, and thus the photochemical evolution of the AIB carriers. The 5.7 um AIB emission originates from at least two subpopulations, one more prominent in highly irradiated environments and one preferring more shielded environments. Smaller PAHs as well as very small grains or PAH clusters both thrive in the more shielded environments of the molecular zone in the Orion Bar. Based on these new diagnostics, we quantify the similarities between the AIB profiles observed in the Orion Bar and NGC7469.
#### Search for Sub-Relativistic Magnetic Monopoles with the IceCube Neutrino Observatory

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic monopoles are beyond standard model particles, predicted by Grand Unified Theories (GUTs) to be created during the early universe. At typical masses of the GUT-scale - above $10^{14}$ GeV - these particles would move at sub-relativistic speeds. The Rubakov-Callan effect predicts that magnetic monopoles can catalyze nucleon decays, in particular the decay of protons. This results in a unique signature of small particle cascades along the trajectory of the slow moving magnetic monopole. Since 2012, a dedicated Slow-Particle Filter has been implemented in the IceCube Neutrino Observatory for the detection of magnetic monopoles. Current limits set an upper bound for the monopole flux at $\Phi_{\mathrm{90}}\leq 10^{-17}$ to $10^{-18} \mathrm{cm}^{-2}\mathrm{s}^{-1}\mathrm{sr}^{-1}$ depending on the catalysis cross section for the proton decay. A detection of the monopole flux thus requires exceptional background rejection and signal efficiency. This is accomplished using machine learning methods. In this analysis, we use a multi-level boosted decision tree classifier. We present the strategy behind the background and signal simulation, the classification efficiency, and IceCube's projected sensitivity for the detection of sub-relativistic magnetic monopoles.
#### Interpreting the multi-TeV emission from GRB 221009A with a second electron component accelerated by turbulence in the jet

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of very high-energy (VHE) afterglow emission of the gamma-ray burst (GRB) 221009A by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) provides a unique opportunity to probe particle acceleration in relativistic outflows. The hard spectrum at multi-TeV band cannot be fully explained by synchrotron-self-Compton radiation of the conventional one-zone afterglow model. In this work, we introduce a second component of relativistic electrons from stochastic acceleration via downstream turbulence of the external shock. Using a Fokker-Planck approach to model the evolution of protons and electrons, and the non-linear feedback of turbulence damping, we show that the inverse Compton radiation of the second electron component may harden the observed spectrum above multi-TeV energy, and significantly ameliorate the fitting to the spectral evolution measured by LHAASO without violating lower-energy observations. We also discuss the potential presence of the second electron component in other GRB afterglows, which may provide a possible observational signature for future studies.

 - **Abstract**
 This project establishes parameters to characterize galaxy Star Formation History (SFH) beyond mean stellar age. We use ages at which fixed star fractions form to characterize SFH duration. We define Deltaage_n = (age_10 - age_90)/age_50 for SFH extension, where age_10, age_90, age_50 correspond to ages when 10%, 90%, and 50% of stars formed. Probability distributions for observed galaxies use robust Bayesian statistics comparing observed and model spectral features. We create composite stellar population (CSP) libraries using SEDlibrary software, implementing varied SFH, metallicity, and dust properties. We compare spectra using ten features: five spectral indices (D4000n, [Hdelta+Hgamma], Hbeta, [Mg_2Fe], [MgFe]') and five SDSS ugriz photometric fluxes. First, we focus on limiting Deltaage_n distinguishing extended from negligible SFH duration, Deltaage_n,min (time resolution). Using idealized CSP library of 5 million dust-free, burst-free models with fixed metallicities from subsolar to supersolar, Deltaage_n,min marks where spectral features depend on SFH duration. We find roughly flat log(Deltaage_n,min) around -0.3 dex over 4 magnitude orders in age. Deltaage_n,min decreases with higher SNR up to SNR=100, beyond which no improvement occurs. Second, we create mock datasets by perturbing 12,500 library models with realistic errors, testing retrieval capability for characteristic ages and SFH duration using realistic 500,000-model CSP library with up to 6 starbursts, dust, and variable metallicity. We constrain SFH duration log(Deltaage_n) within +-0.3 dex for most samples. For populations with strong Balmer absorption and mean age <10^9 yr, uncertainty exceeds 0.5 dex due to SFH degeneracies. These parameters will apply to current and upcoming deep spectroscopic galaxy surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 We conduct a model atmosphere analysis on all magnetic white dwarfs in the SDSS 100 pc sample. We have 163 magnetic targets in this sample, 87 of which are new discoveries, making this the largest volume-limited survey of magnetic white dwarfs to date. We discuss the distribution of multiple parameters, including mass, cooling age, and field strength. We find strong evidence of two populations of magnetic white dwarfs that form through separate mechanisms based on a cluster analysis of these parameters. The young, high mass objects typically have high field strengths which indicate a merger origin, while old, average mass objects have weaker fields that likely originated through a crystallization-induced dynamo or previous evolution stages. When comparing young and old objects, two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests yield statistically significant differences between the field strengths and masses of the magnetic targets. We use a Gaussian mixture model to identify where these populations lie in parameter space, and we find two groups centered at distinct cooling ages, masses, and field strengths: 2.9 Gyr, 0.71 $M_{\odot}$, 3.7 MG and 1.8 Gyr, 0.96 $M_{\odot}$, 84 MG respectively. Our results further support the dual formation channel previously reported in the literature. The occurrence of magnetism strongly correlates with the onset of crystallization. However, given the breakout times required for a crystallization dynamo, we find that many of our older, average mass objects can be better explained with a core-convective dynamo that forms on the main-sequence.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, the IceCube Collaboration reported evidence for TeV neutrino emission from several nearby Seyfert galaxies, with the highest significance found for NGC 1068. Assuming stochastic proton acceleration in magnetized turbulence inside the corona, we model the neutrino emission of Seyfert galaxies as a function of their X-ray luminosity. Applying our model to NGC 1068, we obtain a good fit to the public IceCube data and constrain the coronal radius to $\lesssim 5 R_S$ by comparing our MeV $\gamma$-ray predictions to Fermi-LAT observations. Extending to the full Seyfert population, we estimate their diffuse neutrino contribution and find that they can explain a significant fraction of the observed flux below $10\,\mathrm{TeV}$. However, scenarios with highly turbulent coronae and high cosmic-ray pressure across the population are ruled out. In particular, if all sources shared the best-fit parameters obtained for NGC 1068, their cumulative neutrino emission would exceed current upper limits at TeV energies by $3.8\sigma$. Our results, informed by both neutrino and $\gamma$-ray data, show that those Seyfert galaxies that emerge as neutrino point sources must be exceptionally efficient neutrino emitters and are not representative of the broader population.

 - **Abstract**
 In recent decades, significant attention has been dedicated to analytical and observational studies of the atomic hydrogen (HI) to molecular hydrogen (H2) transition in the interstellar medium. We focussed on the Draco diffuse cloud to gain deeper insights into the physical properties of the transition from HI to H2. We employed the total hydrogen column density probability distribution function (N-PDF) derived from Herschel dust observations and the N(HI)-PDF obtained from HI data collected by the Effelsberg HI survey. The N-PDF of the Draco cloud exhibits a double-log-normal distribution, whereas the N(HI)-PDF follows a single log-normal distribution. The HI-to-H2 transition is identified as the point where the two log-normal components of the dust N-PDF contribute equally; it occurs at Av = 0.33 (N=6.2e20 cm^-2). The low-column-density segment of the dust N-PDF corresponds to the cold neutral medium, which is characterized by a temperature of around 100 K. The higher-column-density part is predominantly associated with H2. The shape of the Draco N-PDF is qualitatively reproduced by numerical simulations. In the absence of substantial stellar feedback, such as radiation or stellar winds, turbulence exerts a significant influence on the thermal stability of the gas and can regulate the condensation of gas into denser regions and its subsequent evaporation. Recent observations of the ionized carbon line at 158 micron in Draco support this scenario. Using the KOSMA-tau photodissociation model, we estimate a gas density of n=50 cm^-3 and a temperature of 100 K at the location of the HI-to-H2 transition. Both the molecular and atomic gas components are characterized by supersonic turbulence and strong mixing, suggesting that simplified steady-state chemical models are not applicable under these conditions.

 - **Abstract**
 We study cosmic magnification beyond lensing in a late-time universe dominated by quintessence and cold dark matter. The cosmic magnification angular power spectrum, especially going beyond the well-known lensing effect, provides an independent avenue for investigating the properties of quintessence, and hence, dark energy. By analysing the magnification power spectrum at different redshifts, it is possible to extract new information about the large-scale imprint of dark energy, including whether we are able to disentangle different models from one another. Using three well-known quintessence models, we analyse the cosmic magnification angular power spectrum while taking relativistic corrections into account. We found that it will be difficult to distinguish between quintessence models, and quintessence from the cosmological constant, in lensing magnification angular power spectrum on large scales, at redshifts $z \,{\leq}\, 1$; whereas, when relativistic corrections are incorporated, the total magnification angular power spectrum holds the potential to distinguish between the models, at the given $z$. At $z \,{\geq}\, 3$, the lensing magnification angular power spectrum can be a reasonable approximation of the total magnification angular power spectrum. We also found that both the total relativistic and the Doppler magnification signals, respectively, surpass cosmic variance at $z \,{\leq}\, 0.5$: hence the effect may be detectable at the given $z$. On the other hand, the ISW and the time-delay magnification signals, respectively, are surpassed by cosmic variance on all scales, at epochs up to $z \,{=}\, 4.5$, with the gravitational-potential magnification signal being zero.
