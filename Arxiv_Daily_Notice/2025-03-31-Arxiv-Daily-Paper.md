 - **Abstract**
 Making an unambiguous detection of lensed gravitational waves is challenging with current generation detectors due to large uncertainties in sky localisations and other inferred parameter distributions. However, in the case of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers this challenge can be overcome by detecting multiple images of its lensed kilonova counterpart, simultaneously confirming the lensing nature of the event and locating it precisely - further enabling a wealth of lensed multimessenger science. Such a strategy demands answers to two key problems: 1) How can candidate lensed BNS events be identified fast enough to ensure the lensed kilonova is still detectable? 2) What is the most economical observing strategy on telescope time for following up candidate lensed events to discover lensed kilonovae? This article will discuss solutions to both points, specifically: how GW detections of progenitors in the $\sim$ 2.5 to 5 $M_\odot$ black hole "mass gap" can be interpreted as candidate lensed BNS events, giving evidence for lensing from just a single detection, and will present a strategy that can actively be employed for follow-up of such events in the O4 run of LVK and beyond.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent studies of gas kinematics at high redshift have reported disky systems which appear to challenge models of galaxy formation, but it is unclear whether they are representative of the underlying galaxy population. We present the first statistical sample of spatially resolved ionised gas kinematics at high redshift, comprised of $272$ H$\alpha$ emitters in GOODS-S and GOODS-N at redshifts $z\approx3.9-6.5$, observed with JWST/NIRCam slitless spectroscopy and imaging from JADES, FRESCO and CONGRESS. The sample probes two orders of magnitude in stellar mass ($\log (M_{\star}[\mathrm{M}_{\odot}])\approx8-10$) and star formation rate ($\text{SFR}\approx0.3-100\thinspace M_{\odot}/$yr), and is representative down to $\log(M_{\star}[\mathrm{M}_{\odot}])\approx 9$. Using a novel inference tool, $\texttt{geko}$, we model the grism data to measure morphological and kinematic properties of the ionised gas, as probed by H$\alpha$. Our results are consistent with a decrease of the rotational support $v/\sigma_0$\ and increase of the velocity dispersion $\sigma_0$ with redshift, with $\sigma_0\approx100$ km/s and $v/\sigma_0\approx1-2$ at $z\approx3.9-6.5$. We study the relations between $\sigma_0$, and $v/\sigma_0$, and different star formation tracers and find a large scatter and diversity, with the strongest correlations between $\sigma_0$ and SFR and SFR surface density. The fraction of rotationally supported systems ($v/\sigma_0>1$) slightly increases with cosmic time, from $(36\pm6)\%$ to $(41\pm6)\%$ from $z\sim 5.5$ to $z\sim 4.5$, for galaxies with masses $9<\log(M_{\star}[\mathrm{M}_{\odot}])<10$. Overall, disks do not dominate the turbulent high-redshift galaxy population in the mass range probed by this work. When placed in the context of studies up to cosmic noon, our results are consistent with a significant increase of disk-like systems with cosmic time.
#### MIRACLE I.: Unveiling the Multi-Phase, Multi-Scale physical properties of the Active Galaxy NGC 424 with MIRI, MUSE, and ALMA

 - **Abstract**
 We present the analysis of the multi-phase gas properties in the Seyfert II galaxy NGC 424, using spatially resolved spectroscopic data from JWST/MIRI, part of the Mid-InfraRed Activity of Circumnuclear Line Emission (MIRACLE) program, as well as VLT/MUSE and ALMA. We trace the properties of the multi-phase medium, from cold and warm molecular gas to hot ionised gas, using emission lines such as CO(2-1), H2 S(1), [OIII]5007, [NeIII]15, and [NeV]14. These lines reveal the intricate interplay between the different gas phases within the circumnuclear region, spanning approximately 1.4x1.4 kpc^2, with a resolution of 10 pc. Exploiting the multi-wavelength and multi-scale observations of gas emission we model the galaxy disc rotation curve from scales of a few parsec up to 5 kpc from the nucleus and infer a dynamical mass of 1.09\pm0.08x10^10 M_{\odot} with a disc scale radius of 0.48\pm0.02 kpc. We detect a compact ionised outflow with velocities up to 10^3 km/s, traced by the [OIII], [NeIII], and [NeV] transitions, with no evidence of cold or warm molecular outflows. We suggest that the ionised outflow might be able to inject a significant amount of energy into the circumnuclear region, potentially hindering the formation of a molecular wind, as the molecular gas is observed to be denser and less diffuse. The combined multi-band observations also reveal, in all gas phases, a strong enhancement of the gas velocity dispersion directed along the galaxy minor axis, perpendicular to the high-velocity ionised outflow, and extending up to 1 kpc from the nucleus. Our findings suggest that the outflow might play a key role in such enhancement by injecting energy into the host disc and perturbing the ambient material.

 - **Abstract**
 Torques from asymmetric dust structures (so-called dust-void and filamentary structures) formed around low-mass planets embedded in a non turbulent dust-gas disk can exceed the torques produced by the gas disk component, then governing the planet's orbital dynamics. Here, we investigate how these structures (hence the dust torque) change when the effect of turbulent dust diffusion and dust feedback are included, and the direct implications on the migration of Earth-like planets. Using the \textsc{Fargo3D} code, we perform 2D and 3D multifluid hydrodynamic simulations, focusing on a non-migrating planet with the mass $M_p=1.5\,M_\oplus$ in 2D and on migrating planets with $M_p\in[1.5,12]\,M_\oplus$ in 3D. We vary the $\delta$-dimensionless diffusivity parameter in the range $[0,3\times10^{-3}]$ and consider three different Stokes numbers $\mathrm{St}=\{0.04,0.26,0.55\}$, which are representative of the gas, transitional and gravity-dominated regimes, respectively. In our 2D models, we find that turbulent diffusion of dust prevents the formation of the dust-void and filamentary structures when $\delta>3\times10^{-4}$. Otherwise, dust structures survive turbulent diffusion flow. However, dust and total torques become positive only in transitional and gravity-dominated regimes. In our 3D models, we find that the dust-void is drastically modified and the high-density ring-shaped barrier delineating the dust-void disappears if $\delta\gtrsim10^{-4} $, due to the effect of dust turbulent diffusion along with the back-reaction of the dust. For all values of $\delta$, the filament in front of the planet is replaced by a low-density trench. Remarkably, as we allow the planets to migrate, the evolving dust-void can drive either runaway migration or outward (inward) oscillatory-torque migration. Our study thus suggests that low-mass Earth-like planets can undergo runaway migration in dusty disks.

 - **Abstract**
 Double-peaked emission lines are observed in a few percent of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and allow the determination of properties of the line-emitting region, known as the broad-line region (BLR). We investigate the structure and kinematics of the BLR in the Seyfert galaxy NGC 4593 through an analysis of the NIR line blend of Ca II 8498, 8542, 8662 and O I 8446 observed in a 2019 VLT/MUSE spectrum. We perform a detailed decomposition of the near-infrared Ca II triplet and O I 8446 blend, extracting clean profiles of Ca II 8498, 8542, 8662 and O I 8446. We then fit Ca 8662 with a relativistic elliptical line-emitting disk model. The line profiles are double-peaked with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of approx. 3700 km/s and exhibit a redward asymmetry with a red-to-blue peak ratio of 4:3. The Ca ii triplet lines have an intensity ratio of 1:1:1 and show no evidence of a central narrow or intermediate-width component. The profiles of Ca II and O I are remarkably similar, suggesting a common region of origin. Given the 1:1:1 ratio of the Ca II triplet, this region is likely a high-density emission zone, and the Ca II 8662 profile is well described by a mildly eccentric, low-inclination relativistic disk with minimal internal turbulence. The profile represents one of the clearest kinematic signatures of a relativistic disk observed in BLR emission lines to date. The double-peaked profiles of the NIR Ca II triplet and O I 8446 in NGC 4593 represent the first detection of double-peaked Ca II and O I 8446 in a non-transient AGN spectrum. The minimal intrinsic turbulence -- the lowest value reported for an AGN emission line to date -- and absence of narrow or intermediate-width components in Ca II 8662 make it a powerful diagnostic tool of BLR structure and kinematics. Further investigations of the profiles of Ca II and O I in other AGN are warranted to better constrain BLR properties.

 - **Abstract**
 The kinematics of star-forming galaxy populations at high redshifts are integral to our understanding of disk properties, merger rates, and other defining characteristics. Nebular gas emission is a common tracer of galaxies' gravitational potentials and angular momenta, but is sensitive to non-gravitational forces as well as galactic outflows, and thus might not accurately trace the host galaxy dynamics. We present kinematic maps of young stars from rest-ultraviolet photospheric absorption in the star-forming galaxy CASSOWARY 13 (a.k.a. SDSS J1237+5533) at $z=1.87$ using the Keck Cosmic Web Imager, alongside nebular emission measurements from the same observations. Gravitational lensing magnification of the galaxy enables good spatial sampling of multiple independent lensed images. We find close agreement between the stellar and nebular velocity fields. We measure a mean local velocity dispersion of $\sigma = 64\pm12$ km$\,$s$^{-1}$ for the young stars, consistent with that of the H II regions traced by nebular C III] emission ($52\pm9$ km$\,$s$^{-1}$). The $\sim20$ km$\,$s$^{-1}$ average difference in line-of-sight velocity is much smaller than the local velocity width and the velocity gradient ($\gtrsim 100$ km$\,$s$^{-1}$). We find no evidence of asymmetric drift nor evidence that outflows bias the nebular kinematics, and thus conclude that nebular emission appears to be a reasonable dynamical tracer of young stars in the galaxy. These results support the picture of star formation in thick disks with high velocity dispersion at $z\sim2$, and represent an important step towards establishing robust kinematics of early galaxies using collisionless tracers.

 - **Abstract**
 Tomography is a powerful technique for recovering the three-dimensional (3D) density structure of the global solar corona. In this work, we present an improved tomography method by introducing radial weighting in the regularization term. Radial weighting provides balanced smoothing of density values across different heights, helping to recover finer structures at lower heights while also stabilizing the solution and preventing oscillatory artifacts at higher altitudes. We apply this technique to reconstruct the 3D electron density of Carrington Rotation (CR) 2098 using two weeks of polarized brightness (pB) observations from the inner coronagraph (COR1) onboard spacecraft-B of the twin Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO), where the radial weighting function is taken as the inverse intensity background, calculated by averaging all the pB images used. Comparisons between density distributions at various heights from the tomography and magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations show good agreement. We find that radial weighting not only effectively corrects the over-smoothing effect near the inner boundary in reconstructions using second-order smoothing but also significantly improves reconstruction quality when using zeroth-order smoothing. Additionally, comparing reconstructions for CR 2091 from single-satellite data with that from multi-viewpoint data suggests that coronal evolution and dynamics may have a significant impact on the reconstructed density structures. This improved tomography method has been used to create a database of 3D densities for CRs 2052 to 2154, based on STEREO/COR1-B data, covering the period from 08 January 2007 to 17 September 2014.
#### Asteroseismology of Long-Period Variables with OGLE-IV data: Using Global Seismic Parameters as Luminosity Indicators

 - **Abstract**
 Long-period variables (LPVs) are high-luminosity red giants or supergiants with pulsation periods ranging from days to years. Many LPVs in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and Galactic Bulge (BLG) have been continuously observed over a time span of 26 years by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) survey. Using OGLE-IV data, we applied Gaussian Processes with kernels tailored for solar-like oscillations to extract two global asteroseismic parameters: the frequency of maximum power (numax) and the large frequency separation (Dnu), for LPVs with primary mode periods (P1) between 10 and 100 days in the LMC and BLG. We found that the numax-Dnu relation for LPVs in this work aligns with that of lower-luminosity Kepler red giants, confirming that the pulsations of these LPVs are likely solar-like. We found that numax and Dnu can serve as luminosity indicators. Compared to P1, numax and Dnu exhibit significantly tighter correlations with the absolute magnitude in the 2MASS K_s band (M_{K}), with corresponding scatter of 0.27 mag and 0.21 mag, respectively. Using the calibrated numax-mk and Dnu-mk relations for LPVs in the LMC, we determined the M_{K} values for individual stars in the BLG. By accounting for extinction, we further calculated the distances to 4,948 BLG stars. The peak of the resulting distance distribution corresponds to an estimated distance to the Galactic center of approximately 9.1 kpc, which appears to be overestimated, suggesting that the seismic luminosity relation calibrated from the LMC may not be directly applicable to BLG stars.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the design methodology and characterization of a superconducting magnetic bearing (SMB) system for the polarization modulator in the SAT-LF, one of the small aperture telescopes (SATs) in the Simons Observatory (SO) that is sensitive at 30/40 GHz frequency bands. SO is a ground-based cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization experiment, with the SATs specifically aiming to search for primordial parity-odd polarization anisotropies at degree scales. Each SAT is equipped with a cryogenic, continuously rotating half-wave plate (HWP) as a polarization modulator to mitigate atmospheric $1/f$ noise and instrumental systematics. The HWP system employs an SMB, consisting of a ring-shaped magnet and superconductor, to achieve a 550 mm clear aperture and stable 2 Hz rotation at a temperature of around 50 K. One challenge for the HWP system in the SAT-LF is the large 35 kg load on the SMB due to the thicker HWP than in previous telescopes. Since the SMB stiffness is critical for maintaining the alignment of the HWP in the telescope, we developed a method to quantitatively predict the stiffness using finite element simulations with the so-called H-formulation. We evaluated the stiffness for various geometries of the magnet and superconductor, thereby optimizing their dimensions. The prediction is in excellent agreement with experimental measurements of the fabricated SMB, demonstrating a $\sim$5\% accuracy. We also demonstrated that the SMB achieves sufficiently low friction-induced heat dissipation, measured at 0.26 W when rotating at 2 Hz. The design methodology and the implementation of the SMB demonstrated here not only provides an enabling technology for the SO SAT-LF, but also is a crucial stepping stone for future CMB experiments that make use of HWP polarization modulators.

 - **Abstract**
 A sample of 312 low-frequency peaked BL Lacertae objects (LBLs) and 694 flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) with the parameters both redshift and $\gamma$-ray photon spectral index ($\Gamma _\gamma$) is compiled from the active galactic nuclei (AGNs) Catalog Data Release 2 (4LAC-DR2) from Fermi-LAT. The multi-wavelength data of the sample sources are downloaded from the Space Science Data Center (SSDC), and then match the corresponding gamma-ray data from 4FGL-DR2. The synchrotron radiation peak frequency and Compton dominance (CD) parameters of the sources are obtained by using a log-parabolic to fit the average-state multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution. A support vector machine (SVM) in the $\log L_\gamma$-$\Gamma_\gamma$ frame is utilized to delineate the optimal boundary between FSRQs and LBLs sources. The 1$\sigma$ position of the Gaussian fitting on the histograms of the $\Gamma_\gamma$, $\log \nu^{syn}_{peak}$, and CD parameter distributions are also introduced. In the criterion, 25 FSRQ candidates are selected from LBL sample sources. The optical spectral identification result confirms that 8 out of 13 candidate sources available with the optical spectral data exhibit the relationship of $EW > 5 \mathring{\mathrm{A}}$.

 - **Abstract**
 The Herbig Ae/Be star HD190073 is one of the very few magnetic Herbig Ae/Be stars for which close low-mass companions have been reported. Previously published magnetic field measurements indicated an annual change in the field configuration. We aim to study in detail the spectral and magnetic variability of this star and characterise its magnetosphere for the first time. Newly acquired and archival spectropolarimetric observations are combined to determine a more precise magnetic period and to constrain the geometry of the magnetic field. The variability of hydrogen line profiles is studied using dynamical spectra. Archival X-shooter observations of the He I 10830 ang triplet are used to characterise its variability over the rotation cycle. Further, we carry out 2D magnetohydrodynamical simulations of the magnetosphere using the Nirvana code. From the spectropolarimetric observations, we determine for HD190073 a magnetic period P=51.70 d. We estimate a magnetic obliquity angle 82.9 degr and a dipole strength 222 G. Our dynamical spectra constructed for the hydrogen line profiles observed during 2011 clearly reveal a ringlike magnetospheric structure appearing at the rotation phase of best visibility of the positive magnetic pole. These spectra present the first snapshot of a magnetosphere around a Herbig Ae/Be star. 2D MHD simulations involving nonisothermal gas show that the magnetosphere is compact, with a radius of about $3\,R_*$, and that the wind flow extends over tens of $R_*$. With a reported radius of the accretion disk of 1.14 au around HD190073, the distance between the star and the disk is about 25 $R_*$. The detection of a magnetosphere around HD190073, and the possible presence of lower-mass companions at different distances, make this system a valuable laboratory for studying the magnetic interaction between the host star, its companions, and the accretion disk.

 - **Abstract**
 $\require{mediawiki-texvc}$Galactic outflows shape galaxy evolution, but their mass, energy, and momentum transfer remain uncertain. High-resolution spectroscopy can help, but systematic discrepancies hinder model interpretation. In this study, we evaluate the performance of semi-analytical line transfer (SALT) and empirical partial covering models (PCMs) to recover the properties of outflows in the FIRE-2 simulation suite from synthetic Si II lines (1190 $Å$, 1193 $Å$, 1260 $Å$, 1304 $Å$, 1527 $Å$). When applicable, we assess each model's ability to recover mass, energy, and momentum outflow rates, as well as radial density and velocity profiles, column densities, and flow geometries. We find that the PCM underestimates column densities by 1.3 dex on average in the range $15 < \log N\ [\text{cm}^{-2}] < 17$ with dispersion 1.3 dex. We attribute this bias to instrumental smoothing. Since the PCM underestimates column densities, it also underestimates flow rates, though its predictions are independent of radius, with a dispersion of 0.55 dex. We detect no bias in the SALT estimates of the column density with dispersion 1.3 dex. When the velocity and density field obey power laws, SALT can constrain the mass, momentum, and energy outflow rates to 0.36 (0.63), 0.56 (0.56), and 0.97 (0.80) dex at $0.15(0.30)R_{\text{vir}}$, respectively. However, certain profiles in FIRE-2 fall outside the SALT framework, where the model breaks down. We find that SALT effectively tracks the flow geometry, capturing the temporal evolution of the photon escape fraction that is out of phase with the star formation rate, fully consistent with hydrodynamic simulations. We advocate for integral field unit spectroscopy to better constrain flow properties.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic birefringence (CB) is the rotation of the photons' linear polarisation plane during propagation. Such an effect is a tracer of parity-violating extensions of standard electromagnetism and would probe the existence of a new cosmological field acting as dark matter or dark energy. It has become customary to employ cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarised data to probe such a phenomenon. Recent analyses on Planck and WMAP data provide a hint of detection of the isotropic CB angle with an amplitude of around $0.3^\circ$ at the level of $2.4$ to $3.6\sigma$. In this work, we explore the LiteBIRD capabilities in constraining such an effect, accounting for the impact of the more relevant systematic effects, namely foreground emission and instrumental polarisation angles. We build five semi-independent pipelines and test these against four different simulation sets with increasing complexity in terms of non-idealities. All the pipelines are shown to be robust and capable of returning the expected values of the CB angle within statistical fluctuations for all the cases considered. We find that the uncertainties in the CB estimates increase with more complex simulations. However, the trend is less pronounced for pipelines that account for the instrumental polarisation angles. For the most complex case analysed, we find that LiteBIRD will be able to detect a CB angle of $0.3^\circ$ with a statistical significance ranging from $5$ to $13 \, \sigma$, depending on the pipeline employed, where the latter uncertainty corresponds to a total error budget of the order of $0.02^\circ$.

 - **Abstract**
 This work builds on a recently developed self-consistent synchronization model of the solar dynamo which attempts to explain Rieger-type periods, the Schwabe/Hale cycle and the Suess-de Vries and Gleissberg cycles in terms of resonances of various wave phenomena with gravitational forces exerted by the orbiting planets. We start again from the basic concept that the spring tides of the three pairs of the tidally dominant planets Venus, Earth and Jupiter excite magneto-Rossby waves at the solar tachocline. While the quadratic action of the sum of these three waves comprises the secondary beat period of 11.07 years, our main focus is now on the action of the even more pronounced period of 1.723 years. We show that this term excites dynamo vacillations with periods that are typical for the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO). While bimodality of the sunspot distribution is shown to be a general feature of synchronization, it becomes most strongly expressed under the influence of the QBO. This may explain the observation that the solar activity is relatively subdued when compared to that of other sun-like stars. We also discuss anomalies of the solar cycle, and subsequent phase jumps by 180 degrees. In this connection it is noted that the very 11.07-yr beat period is rather sensitive to the time-averaging of the quadratic functional of the waves and prone to phase jumps of 90 degrees. On this basis, we propose an alternative explanation of the observed 5.5-year phase jumps in algae-related data from the North Atlantic and Lake Holzmaar that were hitherto attributed to optimal growth conditions.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitationally lensed quasars have served as a powerful tool for studying the composition of dark matter (DM) in lensing galaxies. In this work, we propose a novel method to investigate stellar-mass primordial black holes (PBHs) by using the microlensing effect of strongly lensed Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). Using the parameters of the lensed quasar system PG 1115+80, such as convergence, shear, and stellar/dark matter fractions, we generate microlensing magnification maps. A uniform brightness disk model is applied to these maps to evaluate the microlensing amplitude at different stages of the supernova explosion. We extend this analysis by employing the strong lensing parameters derived from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) to create extensive image datasets of lensed SNe Ia. Utilizing these datasets and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test, we compare two models: (1) the fiducial model, where galaxies are composed of stars and smooth DM, and (2) the alternative model, where galaxies consist of stars and compact DM, specifically PBHs. Our preliminary analysis predicts that at least 60 image datasets are required to distinguish these two scenarios at a 95 percent confidence level. Additionally, by incorporating the Strong Lensing Halo model-based mock catalogs (SL-Hammocks), which provide more realistic and precise image data, we refine our prediction to assess the data requirements for distinguishing cases where PBHs constitute fractions x of the total dark matter mass. Our findings indicate that 50, 55, and 65 image datasets, corresponding to compact dark matter fractions of 100 percent, 50 percent, and 25 percent (denoted by x), are necessary to distinguish between the specific models.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a catalogue of more than 5000 new ultracool dwarf (UCD) candidates in the three Euclid Deep Fields in the Q1 data release. They range from late M to late T dwarfs, and include 1200 L and T dwarfs. More than 100 of them have been spectroscopically confirmed, with seven of them being T dwarfs. Our UCD selection criteria are based only on colour ($I_\mathrm{E}-Y_\mathrm{E}>2.5$). The combined requirement for optical detection and stringent signal-to-noise ratio threshold ensure a high purity of the sample, but at the expense of completeness, especially for T dwarfs. The detections range from magnitudes 19 and 24 in the near-infrared bands, and extend down to 26 in the optical band. The average surface density of detected UCDs on the sky is approximately 100 objects per $\mathrm{deg}^2$, including 20 L and T dwarfs per $\mathrm{deg}^2$. This leads to an expectation of at least 1.4 million ultracool dwarfs in the final data release of the Euclid Wide Survey, including at least 300,000 L dwarfs, and more than 2,600 T dwarfs, using the strict selection criteria from this work. We provide empirical Euclid colours as a function of spectral type, and a probability that an object with a given colour has a certain spectral type.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents a comparison of plasma dynamics in Coronal Holes (CHs) and Quiet Sun (QS) through 2.5D MHD flux emergence simulations. The magnetic reconnection between the emerging and the pre-existing flux leads to the formation of cool, dense plasmoids with hot boundaries, and hot & cool jets with velocities $\approx50$ km s$^{-1}$. We perform spectral synthesis in spectral lines probing transition region and coronal temperatures. CHs show reduced intensities, excess upflows (downflows), and widths during the jetting (downflow) period when compared to QS. During the jetting and downflow periods, velocity and line width of the hot spectral lines in CHs show a strong positive correlation with the vertical magnetic field at z = 0, while the intensity of the cooler lines shows a weak correlation, which is not seen in QS. During the jetting period in CH, we find upflows in Si IV to be correlated (anti-correlated) with upflows (downflows) in other lines, and downflows in CH in Si IV to be correlated (anti-correlated) with upflows (downflows) in other lines when compared to QS. During downflow, we find no strong correlation between Si IV and other line velocities. The correlation during the jetting period occurs due to coincident, co-spatial origins of the hot and cool jet, while the lack of correlation during the downflow phase suggests a decoupling of hot and cool plasma. These results demonstrate that flux emergence and reconnection with pre-existing flux in the atmosphere support a unified scenario for solar wind formation and coronal heating.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding and characterising the magnetic activity of M dwarfs is of paramount importance in the search for Earth-like exoplanets orbiting them. Energetic stellar activity phenomena, such as flares or coronal mass ejections, which are common in these stars, are deeply connected with the habitability and atmospheric evolution of the surrounding exoplanets. We present a follow-up of a sample of M dwarfs with strong H$\alpha$ and CaII H and K emission lines identified with J-PLUS photometry in a previous work. We collected low-resolution NOT/ALFOSC and GTC/OSIRIS spectra, measuring the PC3 index for the spectral type determination. We used two-minute-cadence calibrated TESS light curves to identify and characterise multiple flares and to calculate the rotation period of the two active M dwarfs found in our sample. We confirm that the strong emission lines detected in the J-PLUS photometry are caused by transient flaring activity. We find clear evidence of flaring activity and periodic variability for LP 310-34 and LP 259-39, and estimated flare energies in the TESS bandpass between $7.4\times10^{30}$ and $2.2\times10^{33}$ erg for them. We characterised LP 310-34 and LP 259-39 as very rapidly rotating M dwarfs with CaII H and K and H$\alpha$ in emission, and computed a rotation period for LP 259-39 for the first time: $P_{\rm rot}=1.69\pm0.02$ d. This work advocates the approach of exploiting multi-filter photometric surveys to systematically identify flaring M dwarfs, especially to detect episodes of strong CaII H and K line emission, which may have important implications for exoplanetary space weather and habitability studies. Our results reveal that common M dwarfs experience flare events in CaII H and K in addition to well known H$\alpha$ flares.

 - **Abstract**
 Astrophysical radio sources are embedded in turbulent magnetised environments. In the 1 MHz sky, solar radio bursts are the brightest sources, produced by electrons travelling along magnetic field lines from the Sun through the heliosphere. We demonstrate that the magnetic field not only guides the emitting electrons, but also directs radio waves via anisotropic scattering from density irregularities in the magnetised plasma. Using multi-vantage-point type III solar radio burst observations and anisotropic radio wave propagation simulations, we show that the interplanetary field structure is encoded in the observed radio emission directivity, and that large-scale turbulent channelling of radio waves is present over large distances, even for relatively weak anisotropy in the embedded density fluctuations. Tracing the radio emission at many frequencies (distances), the effects of anisotropic scattering can be disentangled from the electron motion along the interplanetary magnetic field, and the emission source locations are unveiled. Our analysis suggests that magnetic field structures within turbulent media could be reconstructed using radio observations and is found consistent with the Parker field, offering a novel method for remotely diagnosing the large-scale field structure in the heliosphere and other astrophysical plasmas.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultracool dwarfs (UCDs) encompass the lowest mass stars and brown dwarfs, defining the stellar substellar boundary. They have significant potential for advancing the understanding of substellar physics; however, these objects are challenging to detect due to their low luminosity. The wide coverage and deep sensitivity of the Euclid survey will increase the number of confirmed and well characterised UCDs by several orders of magnitude. In this study, we take advantage of the Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1) and in particular we look in detail at the known and new UCDs in the Euclid Deep Field North (22.9 deg2 down to JE = 24.5 mag), to understand the advantages of using the slitless Euclid spectroscopy. We compile a comparison sample of known UCDs and use their spectra to demonstrate the capability of Euclid to derive spectral types using a template matching method. This method is then applied to the spectra of the newly identified candidates. We confirm that 33 of these candidates are new UCDs, with spectral types ranging from M7 to T1 and JE = 17 to 21 mag. We look at their locus in colour colour diagrams and compare them with the expected colours of QSOs. A machine readable catalogue is provided for further study, containing both the comparison sample and the newly identified UCDs, along with their spectral classifications where the Q1 spectra quality allows for confident determination

 - **Abstract**
 The Galactic evolution of copper remains poorly understood, partly due to the strong departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) affecting Cu I lines. A key source of uncertainty in non-LTE modelling is the treatment of inelastic Cu+H collisions. We present new rate coefficients based on a combined asymptotic LCAO and free electron model approach, which show significant differences from previous calculations. Applying these updated rates to non-LTE stellar modelling, we find reduced line-to-line scatter and improved consistency between metal-poor dwarfs and giants. Our non-LTE analysis reveals a strong upturn in the [Cu/Fe] trend towards lower [Fe/H] < -1.7. We show that this may reflect the interplay between external enrichment of Cu-rich material of the Milky Way halo at low metallicities, and metallicity-dependent Cu yields from rapidly rotating massive stars. This highlights the unique diagnostic potential of accurate Cu abundances for understanding both stellar and Galactic evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the massive cluster XMMXCS J2215.9-1738 at z about 1.46 with MUSE and KMOS integral field spectroscopy. Using MUSE spectroscopy we trace the kinematics of the ionized gas using [OII] in the central 500x500 square kpc area of the cluster, which contains 28 spectroscopically identified cluster galaxies. We detect [OII] emission lines in the integrated spectra of 21 galaxies with the remaining seven being passive galaxies. Six of these passive galaxies lie in the cluster central part with a diameter of 200 kpc which contains no star-forming objects, being a place where star-formation in galaxies is quenched. An interesting discovery in this central area of the cluster are three diffuse ionized [OII] gas structures, which we refer as [OII] blobs, extending over areas of hundreds of square kpc. The source of ionization of one of the gaseous structures which displays two prominent filamentary patterns indicating outflow of gas is an active galactic nucleus (AGN). The KMOS data enabled us to use the BPT diagram to identify this object as a type-2 AGN. The other two diffuse ionized oxygen gaseous structures are more enigmatic, being located between the stellar components of passive cluster galaxies; one of these blobs does not have any stellar counterpart in the HST optical and near-infrared data, and the other only a very faint counterpart. Ram-pressure stripping of photo-ionized gas or AGN feedback could be an explanation. Additionally, the galaxy velocity distribution in this high redshift cluster is bimodal indicating that the cluster is unlikely to be fully virialized, and that recent and ongoing merging events producing shocks could provide photo-ionization sources for the two enigmatic [OII] blobs.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent analyses of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations from CAMELS have shown that machine learning models can predict the parameter describing the total matter content of the universe, $\Omega_{\rm m}$, from the features of a single galaxy. We investigate the statistical properties of two of these simulation suites, IllustrisTNG and ASTRID, confirming that $\Omega_{\rm m}$ induces a strong displacement on the distribution of galaxy features. We also observe that most other parameters have little to no effect on the distribution, except for the stellar-feedback parameter $A_{SN1}$, which introduces some near-degeneracies that can be broken with specific features. These two properties explain the predictability of $\Omega_{\rm m}$. We use Optimal Transport to further measure the effect of parameters on the distribution of galaxy properties, which is found to be consistent with physical expectations. However, we observe discrepancies between the two simulation suites, both in the effect of $\Omega_{\rm m}$ on the galaxy properties and in the distributions themselves at identical parameter values. Thus, although $\Omega_{\rm m}$'s signature can be easily detected within a given simulation suite using just a single galaxy, applying this result to real observational data may prove significantly more challenging.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the first detection of the X-ray polarisation of the transient black hole X-ray binary IGRJ17091-3624 taken with the Imaging X-ray polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) in March 2025, and present the results of an X-ray spectro-polarimetric analysis. The polarisation was measured in the 2--8 keV band with 5.2$\sigma$ statistical confidence. We report a polarisation degree (PD) of $9.1\pm1.6$ per cent and a polarisation angle of $83^{\circ} \pm 5^{\circ}$ (errors are $1\sigma$ confidence). There is a hint of a positive correlation of PD with energy that is not statistically significant. We report that the source is in the corona-dominated hard state, which is confirmed by a hard power-law dominated spectrum with weak reflection features and the presence of a Type-C quasi-periodic oscillation at $\sim0.2$~Hz. The orientation of the emitted radio jet is not known, and so we are unable to compare it with the direction of X-ray polarization, but we predict the two to be parallel if the geometry is similar to that in Cygnus X-1 and Swift J1727.8-1613, the two hard state black hole binaries previously observed by IXPE. In the Comptonisation scenario, the high observed PD requires a very favourable geometry of the corona, a high inclination angle (supported by the presence of a dip in the light curve) and possibly a mildly relativistic outflow and/or scattering in an optically thick wind.
