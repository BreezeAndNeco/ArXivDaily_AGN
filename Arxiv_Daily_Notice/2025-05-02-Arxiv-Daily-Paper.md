 - **Abstract**
 In this paper we consider the extent to which a lack of observations from SETI may be used to quantify the Fermi paradox. Building on previous research, we construct a geometrical model to compute the probability of at least one detection of an extraterrestrial electromagnetic (EM) signal of galactic origin, as a function of the number $N$ of communicative civilizations. We show how this is derivable from the probability of detecting a single signal; the latter is $\approx 0.6 \delta/R$, where $\delta$ is the distance between the initial and final EM signals and $R$ is the radius of the Milky Way, for $\delta/R \ll 1$. We show how to combine this analysis with the Drake equation $N = \mathscr{N} \delta /c$, where $c$ is the speed of light; this implies, applying a simplified toy model as an example, that the probability of detecting at least one signal is $>99 \%$ for $\delta / c \gtrsim 10^{2.8}$ years, given that $\mathscr{N} = 1$. Lastly, we list this toy model's significant limitations, and suggest ways to ameliorate them in more realistic future models.
#### Detailed Simulations of Massive Hierarchical Triple Star Systems - Exploring the impact of the stellar physics on the evolutionary pathways of massive hierarchical triple systems

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations estimate that 30% of early B and O-type stars are found in triple systems. So far, the evolution of triple star systems has mainly been modeled using fast stellar codes. Their accuracy decreases with increasing mass, limiting their reliability for predicting the evolutionary pathways of massive triple systems. We coupled Tres, which by default uses Seba (fast stellar code) to Mesa to perform the first simulations of triple systems that combine a triple secular evolutionary code with a detailed, on-the-fly stellar code. After examining the differences between the stellar evolution predicted by the two codes, we simulate the evolution of a set of triple systems and compare their predicted evolutionary pathways. The predicted stellar tracks become increasingly divergent with increasing mass and wind mass loss efficiency. The maximal radial extent, crucial for determining whether the components of the triple systems interact, differ by up to two orders of magnitude between the two stellar codes in the considered mass range. This leads to divergences in the triples evolutionary pathways predicted by mesa and seba. Using mesa instead of seba, the minimum period for avoiding inner mass transfer is reduced by three orders of magnitude. This has important consequences for the formation of GW sources through the triple compact object channel. Our simulations offer new insights into the physics of triple systems, as key processes (mass loss, radial expansion, precession) are treated self-consistently. They indicate that the results of triple systems population synthesis studies must be interpreted cautiously, in particular when the considered masses are outside the range of the grid the fast codes are based on and when significant stellar winds are considered.
#### AT 2019aalc: a Bowen Fluorescence Flare With a Precursor Flare in an Active Galactic Nucleus

 - **Abstract**
 AT 2019aalc is a peculiar sequence of highly variable emission events observed towards the nucleus of the broad-line AGN SDSS J152416.66+045119.0. The system exhibited two distinct UV/optical flares (the first detected in 2019, the second one in 2023). Spectra obtained following the detection of the second flare revealed prominent Bowen fluorescence and high-ionization coronal emission lines, which were much weaker, if at all detectable, in a spectrum taken following the first flare. We present and analyze a large set of multi-wavelength, multi-epoch data for this source, with particular emphasis on optical spectroscopic monitoring conducted with the Las Cumbres Observatory network. During the relatively slow dimming that followed the second optical flare, the UV/optical light-curve shows a sequence of minor rebrightening events, while the Bowen fluorescence and the coronal lines vary (roughly) in tandem with these "bumps" in the broad-band light-curve. Most of the observed behavior of AT 2019aalc links it to the growing class of Bowen fluorescence flares (BFFs) while setting it apart from canonical tidal disruption events. However, AT 2019aalc has some outstanding peculiarities, including two short flares seen in its soft X-ray light-curve during the dimming phase of the second optical flare, and which do not seem to be linked to the emission line variations. We discuss the optical and X-ray properties of the source and possible scenarios of the origin of the flare, in particular radiation pressure instabilities in the (pre-existing) AGN accretion disk.

 - **Abstract**
 Free-floating planets comprise one of the most enigmatic populations of exoplanets in the Galaxy. Though ground-based observations point to a large abundance of these worlds, little is known about their origins and demographics. In the coming years, the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope's Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey is expected to detect several hundred free-floating planets, providing the first opportunity to characterize these worlds at the population level. We present a first study of Roman's prospects for reconstructing the mass distribution of free-floating planets through population-level statistical inference. We find that depending on the true underlying mass distribution of free-floating planets in the Galaxy, Roman will be able to improve upon existing estimates of the abundance by orders of magnitudes in the largely unexplored mass range below that of Earth. When applied to Roman's observations, the methodology we present herein will be capable of discriminating between different hypothesized mass distributions at high statistical significance, opening a new window into the origins of these rogue worlds.
#### Metallicity of Active Galactic Nuclei from ultraviolet and optical emission lines I: Carbon abundance dependence

 - **Abstract**
 Metallicity ($Z$) estimates based on ultraviolet (UV) emission lines from the narrow-line regions (NLRs) of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) have been found to differ from those derived from optical lines. However, the origin of this discrepancy ($ZR$) remains poorly understood. To investigate the source of $ZR$, we compiled from the literature the fluxes of narrow near-UV ($1000 < \lambda(\angstrom) < 2000)$ and optical ($3000 < \lambda(\angstrom) < 7000)$ emission line measurements for a sample of 11 AGNs (9 at $z<0.4$ and 2 at $z\sim2.4$). Metallicity values for our sample were derived using a semi-empirical calibration based on the $C43$=log[(\ion{C{iv}$\lambda$1549+\ion{C{iii}]$\lambda$1909)/\ion{He}{ii}$\lambda$1640] emission-line ratio and compared with those obtained via direct measurement of the electron temperature ($T_{\rm e}$-method) and via calibrations based on optical emission-lines. The source of the discrepancy was investigated in terms of the ionization parameter ($U$), electron density ($N_{\rm e}$), and carbon abundance (C/H). We found a weak correlation between $ZR$, $U$ and $N_{\rm e}$. However, a moderate correlation was observed between $ZR$ and direct estimates of C/H, suggesting that the previously assumed (C/O)-$Z$ relations in photoionization models used to derive UV carbon-line calibrations may not be valid for AGNs. By combining a large set of abundance estimates for local star-forming regions with those of our AGN sample, we derived a new (C/O)-$Z$ relation. Comparisons between the results of photoionization models that assume this new abundance relation and the UV observational data of our sample produce $Z$ values derived from the $C43$ index that are consistent with those obtained using the $T_{\rm e}$-method.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of our identification of 11 X-ray sources detected on the half of the sky $0^\circ<l<180^\circ$ in the 4-12 keV energy band on the combined map of the first five all-sky surveys with the Mikhail Pavlinsky ART-XC telescope onboard the SRG observatory. All these sources were also detected by the SRG/eROSITA telescope in the 0.2-8 keV energy band, whose data have allowed us to improve their positions and to investigate their X-ray spectra. Five of them have been detected in X-rays for the first time, while the remaining ones have already been known previously, but their nature has remained unknown. We have taken optical spectra for nine sources with the 1.6-m AZT-33IK telescope at the Sayan Observatory (the Institute of Solar-Terrestrial Physics, the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences); for two more objects we have analyzed the archival spectra from SDSS and the 6dF survey. The objects are classified as Seyfert galaxies (seven Sy1, three Sy1.9, and one Sy2) at redshifts $z$=0.029-0.258. Our analysis of the X-ray spectra has revealed a noticeable intrinsic absorption ($N_{\rm H} \sim 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$) in two of the four Seyfert 2 galaxies (Sy1.9-2). The spectrum of one more of them (SRGA J000132.9+240237) cannot be described within the model of an absorbed Comptonization continuum, which may point to a strong absorption and a significant contribution of the reflected radiation. However, the available SRG all-sky survey data are not enough to obtain reliable constraints on the absorption column density in this object, which is also interesting in that it is radio loud. Longer X-ray observations are required to refine the physical properties of this active galactic nucleus.

 - **Abstract**
 Extended gamma-ray emission around isolated pulsars at TeV energies, also known as TeV halos, have been found around a handful of middle-aged pulsars. The halos are significantly more extended than their pulsar wind nebulae but much smaller than the particle diffusion length in the interstellar medium. The origin of TeV halos is unknown. Interpretations invoke either local effects related to the environment of a pulsar or generic particle transport behaviors. The latter scenario predicts that TeV halos would be a universal phenomena for all pulsars. We searched for extended gamma-ray emission around 36 isolated middle-aged pulsars identified by radio and gamma-ray facilities using 2321 days of data from the High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Observatory. Through a stacking analysis comparing TeV flux models against a background-only hypothesis, we identified TeV halo-like emission at a significance level of $5.10\,\sigma$. Our results imply that extended TeV gamma-ray halos may commonly exist around middle-aged pulsars. This reveals a previously unknown feature about pulsars and opens a new window to identify the pulsar population that is invisible to radio, x-ray, and GeV gamma-ray observations due to magnetospheric configurations.
#### Magnetized Accretion onto Neutron Stars: from Photon-trapped to Neutrino-cooled Flows

 - **Abstract**
 When a neutron star (NS) intercepts gas from a non-degenerate star, e.g., in a tidal disruption event, a common-envelope phase, or the collapsing core of a massive star, photons become trapped in the hot flow around the NS. This gas forms a radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) until the density and temperature close to the NS surface grow large enough for binding energy to be converted to neutrinos. Here we present three-dimensional, general-relativistic, magnetohydrodynamic simulations of accretion onto a non-rotating, unmagnetized NS. These connect, for the first time, an extended accretion disk with a self-consistent hydrostatic atmosphere around the star. The impact of different seed magnetic fields and accretion rates is studied by approximating the radiation-pressure dominated flow as an ideal gas with an adiabatic index of $4/3$, coupled to a variable neutrino emissivity. At low accretion rates, the hydrostatic atmosphere shows slow rotation and weak magnetization, transitioning to an outer RIAF structure. A toroidal magnetic field mediates the inward flow of energy and angular momentum through the atmosphere, which reaches a steady state when neutrino emission balances the accretion power. We develop a one-dimensional analytical model connecting these results with more general initial conditions and describing the main features of the flow. Our results have implications for the spin and mass evolution of hypercritically accreting NSs.

 Huairou Solar Observing Station of the National Astronomical Observatories of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has been in operation since 1987. Successful observations of the solar vector magnetic field have been conducted during its operation. Based on the achievements at Huairou, we analyze the methods of observing the solar magnetic field, including discussions of the approximation of the transfer theory of the solar magnetic field in the atmosphere, wide field of view polarized observation, and some questions on the inversion of solar magnetic field data. We also present relevant challenges for further research.

 - **Abstract**
 Planet formation via core accretion involves the growth of solids that can accumulate to form planetary cores. There are a number of barriers to the collisional growth of solids in protostellar discs, one of which is the drift, or metre, barrier. Solid particles experience a drag force that will tend to cause them to drift towards the central star in smooth, laminar discs, potentially removing particles before they grow large enough to decouple from the disc gas. Here we present 3-dimensional, shearing box simulations that explore the dynamical evolution of solids in a protostellar disc that is massive enough for the gravitational instability to manifest as spiral density waves. We expand on earlier work by considering a range of particle sizes and find that the spirals can still enhance the local solid density by more than an order of magnitude, potentially aiding grain growth. Furthermore, if solid particles have enough mass, and the particle size distribution extends to sufficiently large particle sizes, the solid component of the disc can undergo direct gravitational collapse to form bound clumps with masses typically between $1$ and $10$ M$_\oplus$. Thus, the concentration of dust in a self-gravitating disc could bypass the size barrier for collisional growth and directly form planetary cores early in the lifetime of the disc.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of the young stellar moving group ASCC 127 using Gaia DR3 data, significantly expanding its membership to 3,971 stars -- double the number identified in previous studies. Using kinematic and distance criteria, ASCC 127 is divided into five subgroups (Groups 1-5) with ages spanning from 15 to 32 Myr. Groups 1-5 are spatially linked to the Cepheus Flare star-forming region, revealing potential evidence of four sequential star formation episodes at approximately 32 Myr, 20 Myr, 15 Myr, and 7 Myr. Through dust and gas mapping, we identify a spatial cavity extending several tens of parsecs, which may have resulted from feedback processes such as supernovae associated with earlier generations of stars in the region. This structure, along with the larger Loop III feature, indicates that feedback from massive stars likely influenced the interstellar medium (ISM). By integrating young stellar populations with ISM studies, we provide a detailed picture of the feedback-driven star formation history in the Cepheus Flare region.
#### Modeling Metric Gyrosynchrotron Radio Emission From the Quiet Solar Corona

 - **Abstract**
 The radio emission of the quiet Sun in the metric and decametric bands has not been well studied historically due to limitations of existing instruments. It is nominally dominated by thermal brehmsstrahlung of the solar corona, but may also include significant gyrosynchrotron emission, usually assumed to be weak under quiet conditions. In this work, we investigate the expected gyrosynchrotron contribution to solar radio emission in the lowest radio frequencies observable by ground instruments, for different regions of the low and middle corona. We approximate the coronal conditions by a synoptic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model. The thermal emission is estimated from a forward model based on the simulated corona. We calculate the expected gyrosynchrotron emission with the Fast Gyrosynchrotron Codes framework by Fleishman & Kuznetsov (2010). The model emissions of different coronal regions are compared with quiet-time observations between 20-90 MHz by the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) radio telescope. The contribution of gyrosynchrotron radiation to low frequency solar radio emission may shed light on effects such as the hitherto unexplained brightness variation observed in decametric coronal hole emission, and help constrain measurements of the coronal magnetic fields. It can also improve our understanding of electron populations in the middle corona and their relation to the formation of the solar wind.
#### The Jackknife method as a new approach to validate strong lens mass models

 - **Abstract**
 The accuracy of a mass model in the strong lensing analysis is crucial for unbiased predictions of physical quantities such as magnifications and time delays. While the mass model is optimized by changing parameters of the mass model to match predicted positions of multiple images with observations, positional uncertainties of multiple images often need to be boosted to take account of the complex structure of dark matter in lens objects, making the interpretation of the chi-square value difficult. We introduce the Jackknife method as a new method to validate strong lens mass models, specifically focusing on cluster-scale mass modeling. In this approach, we remove multiple images of a source from the fitting and optimize the mass model using multiple images of the remaining sources. We then calculate the multiple images of the removed source and quantitatively evaluate how well they match the observed positions. We find that the Jackknife method performs effectively in simulations using a simple model. We also demonstrate our method with mass modeling of the galaxy cluster MACS J0647.7+7015. We discuss the potential of using the Jackknife method to validate the error estimation of the physical quantities by the Markov Chain Monte Carlo.
