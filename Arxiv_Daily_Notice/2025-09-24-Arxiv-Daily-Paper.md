#### Automatic Classification of Magnetic Chirality of Solar Filaments from H-Alpha Observations

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we classify the magnetic chirality of solar filaments from H-Alpha observations using state-of-the-art image classification models. We establish the first reproducible baseline for solar filament chirality classification on the MAGFiLO dataset. The MAGFiLO dataset contains over 10,000 manually-annotated filaments from GONG H-Alpha observations, making it the largest dataset for filament detection and classification to date. Prior studies relied on much smaller datasets, which limited their generalizability and comparability. We fine-tuned several pre-trained, image classification architectures, including ResNet, WideResNet, ResNeXt, and ConvNeXt, and also applied data augmentation and per-class loss weights to optimize the models. Our best model, ConvNeXtBase, achieves a per-class accuracy of 0.69 for left chirality filaments and $0.73$ for right chirality filaments.

 - **Abstract**
 The $\gamma$-ray emission from active galactic nuclei (AGN), including both beamed blazars and misaligned-AGN, dominates the extragalactic $\gamma$-ray point-source population count and flux. While multi-wavelength studies have detected an increasing number of AGN within dwarf galaxies in the local Universe, $\gamma$-ray emission has so far only been associated with systems hosting supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Dwarf-galaxy AGN are of particular interest because their central black holes fall in the intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) regime, offering insight into the early evolution of SMBHs. Using 15~years of \textit{Fermi}-LAT data, we present the first search for $\gamma$-ray emission from dwarf-galaxy AGN. In the sample of 74 X-ray-selected dwarf-galaxy AGN, we find no sources that exceed the \textit{Fermi}-LAT detection threshold. However, a joint-likelihood analysis reveals a modest, trials-corrected population-level excess ($\sim2\sigma$) above blank-field expectations at very soft photon indices $\Gamma \gtrsim 3.8$ above 500~MeV. This hint is most pronounced when source contributions are weighed by $M^\alpha_{{\rm IMBH},i}/d_i^2$, with $\alpha\simeq1$--$1.5$, suggesting -- but not confirming -- that $\gamma$-ray emission could scale with the central black hole mass or a property correlated with it (e.g., accretion rate), but with a markedly softer spectrum than in SMBH-hosted AGN.
#### Black Hole Collisions With Thin Accretion Disks: OJ 287 and Small-Mass-Ratio Supermassive Black Hole Binary Candidates

 - **Abstract**
 OJ 287 is the best-known supermassive black hole binary candidate in the nanohertz gravitational wave band. It exhibits periodic flares every $\sim$ 12 years, likely caused by collisions of a smaller-mass secondary with the accretion disk surrounding a larger-mass primary. It is therefore an important benchmark for understanding black hole binary accretion in the approaching era of space-based gravitational wave detectors and large electromagnetic surveys. Because the electromagnetic emission of the system is determined by a complex interplay of plasma, accretion, and radiation physics in strong gravity, numerical simulations are required for realistic modeling. We present the first global, three-dimensional, general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of OJ 287-like systems; namely, smaller-mass secondaries colliding with a radiatively-cooled (thin) disk surrounding a larger-mass primary. We focus on disks with scale heights that are 10\% of the distance from the primary and binary mass ratios of $q = 0.1,0.05$, and $0.025$ using an optically-thin cooling prescription. We confirm the basic paradigm that impacts of the secondary on the disk can generate enough power to outshine the quiescent emission. The secondary also causes spiral shocks to form in the disk, enhanced accretion events, overall heating of the flow, and stochastic tilting of the disk, though these effects are small for $q<0.05$. Our results can be extrapolated to the parameters of OJ 287 and similar systems, an important step on the path toward fully realistic simulations of accretion onto small-mass-ratio black hole binaries and predicting electromagnetic counterparts to low-frequency gravitational wave detections.
#### Electrons Everywhere, All at Once: A Novel kSZ Estimator for Electron-Electron Correlations

 - **Abstract**
 Recent advancements in small-scale observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) have provided a unique opportunity to characterize the distribution of baryons in the outskirts of galaxies via stacking-based analyses of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect. Such measurements, mathematically equivalent to probing the galaxy-electron cross-correlation, have revealed that gas is more extended than dark matter and that the strength of baryonic feedback may vary with halo mass and redshift. However, because these analyses are conditioned on galaxy positions, the inferred electron distributions remain biased by uncertain galaxy-halo modeling on small scales. In this work, we present a novel kSZ$\times$galaxy four-point estimator that directly probes the full ionized electron field, extending beyond the gas traced by luminous galaxies. This method exploits large-scale velocity reconstruction from galaxy surveys to characterize the electron distribution unbiased by small-scale galaxy clustering. We forecast that the proposed signal can be measured with a signal-to-noise ratio of $\sim3$ ($\sim13$) for a configuration corresponding to Atacama Cosmology Telescope DR6 (Simons Observatory) CMB data combined with spectroscopic galaxy samples from DESI. This approach will enable the first tomographic measurements of the electron auto-power spectrum, providing new constraints on baryonic feedback and its role in shaping cosmic structure.
#### Binary black holes gone MAD: Magnetically arrested minidisks around nonspinning black holes

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18254

 - **Abstract**
 We demonstrate the formation of magnetically arrested minidisks (MAM) around equal-mass, nonspinning binary black holes with magnetohydrodynamic simulations of circumbinary disk accretion in full 3+1 general relativity. The initial separation of $d\sim 30\,M$ allows the black holes to host large minidisks that suppress the total rest-mass accretion rate variability, which is modulated primarily at $\sim 1.6 \, f_{\rm orb}$. Each black hole horizon saturates with dimensionless magnetic flux $\phi \sim 30$. Magnetic reconnection near the horizons drives recurrent eruptions which are expected to drive flaring in the infrared and X-ray bands. Our results establish MAMs as a new outcome of circumbinary disk accretion, and a promising source of novel electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational waves from binary black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 Previous studies of galaxy clusters have focused extensively on the effects of active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback on the chemical evolution of the intra-cluster medium (ICM). However, similar studies on the atmospheres of lower mass systems, such as galaxy groups and giant ellipticals, remain limited. In this work, we present a systematic analysis of the chemical and multi-temperature structure of the intra-group medium (IGrM), using a subsample of nearby galaxy groups and ellipticals from the CHEERS catalogue. By comparing areas with and without AGN feedback related features, such as cavities or extended radio lobes, we find clear evidence of an excess of multi-phase gas along the path of recent AGN feedback. However, its distribution exceeds the length of the radio lobes, since we recover a non-negligible amount of multi-phase gas at larger radii. In contrast to the clear asymmetry in the thermal structure, we find no directional enhancement in the distribution of Fe, with little to no differences in the Fe abundances of the on- and off-lobe directions. Our analysis suggests that the metals in the IGrM of our targets are well-mixed and decoupled from the effects of recent AGN feedback, as indicated by radio-lobes and cavities.
#### Exploring the impact of AGN feedback model variations on the Lyman-$α$ Forest Flux Power Spectrum

 - **Abstract**
 We study the effects of varying different Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) feedback parameters on the Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) forest 1D transmitted flux power spectrum (P1D). We use the Cosmological and Astrophysics with Machine Learning Simulations (CAMELS) suite to explore variations on the Simba simulation AGN feedback model. The parameters explored include AGN momentum flux, AGN jet speed, supermassive black hole (SMBH) radiative efficiency, jet velocity threshold, and minimum SMBH mass needed to produce jet feedback. Although all parameters affect the P1D, this work explores the radiative efficiency, jet velocity threshold, and minimum SMBH mass in this context for the first time and finds the following results: Primarily, the most massive SMBHs impact the Ly$\alpha$ forest through the jet feedback mode. While heating AGN jets to the virial temperature at injection aids in the removal of neutral hydrogen from the Ly$\alpha$ forest, this heating also inhibits further jet feedback. Similar behaviors are seen when varying the SMBH radiative efficiency, with higher values resulting in a suppression of SMBH growth and thus a later reduction in AGN feedback and lower values directly reducing the impact of AGN feedback on the Ly$\alpha$ forest P1D. These results imply that increasing the AGN feedback strength in the Simba simulation model suppresses the Ly$\alpha$ forest P1D, but only if the feedback does not impact the number of massive jet producing BHs. Future studies of AGN feedback models will require careful exploration of the unique aspects of the specific subgrid model, and how they interact with one another, for a complete understanding of the potential astrophysical impacts of SMBH feedback.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel, GPU-optimized algorithm for particle-mesh interactions in grid-based hydrodynamics simulations, designed for massively parallel architectures. This approach overcomes the inefficiency of particle neighbour searches or sorts across multiple GPU nodes by using a new ``particle-mesh-particle'' interaction scheme, which extends the particle-mesh method for self-gravity. The algorithm proceeds in two main stages: first, quantities exchanged between particles and the mesh -- such as mass, energy, and momentum added by stellar feedback or removed by accretion onto a sink -- are deposited into a buffer mesh equipped with ghost zones, where multiple contributions per cell are accumulated using atomic additions and then communicated across distributed memory ranks. In the second stage, the buffer states are applied to real mesh states, incorporating cell-wise limiters to enforce physical constraints such as positive density. We implement this scheme in the GPU-native radiation-magnetohydrodynamics code QUOKKA, demonstrating its application to both supernova feedback and sink particle accretion. We demonstrate that the former scheme converges in the terminal radial momentum from multiple supernovae across varying spatial resolutions, while for the latter simulations of accretion in several configurations show excellent agreement with analytic solutions. This scheme enables efficient, scalable particle-mesh coupling for GPU-optimized simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 We study 24 massive quiescent galaxies with $\log \textrm{M}_*/\textrm{M}_\odot > 10$ at $1 < z < 3$ with JWST/NIRSpec medium-resolution observations from the Early eXtragalactic Continuum and Emission Line Survey (EXCELS). We reconstruct their star formation histories and find that they have large bursts ($100\textrm{ M}_{\odot} \textrm{yr}^{-1} -1000 \textrm{ M}_{\odot} \textrm{yr}^{-1}$), followed by a rapid truncation of star formation. The number densities of the quenched galaxies in our sample that we predict underwent a submillimeter phase are consistent with submillimeter galaxies being the progenitors of our quenched population. The median post-starburst visibility time is $\sim600$ Myr, with more massive galaxies ($\log \textrm{M}_*/\textrm{M}_\odot > 10.7$) exhibiting shorter visibility times than lower mass galaxies. The range of quenching times -- defined as the time from the peak starburst to the time of quiescence -- found in this sample ($0.06-1.75$ Gyr) suggests multiple quenching pathways, consistent with previous studies. We do not see evidence for quenching mechanisms varying with redshift between $1<z<3$. We detect evidence for weak AGN activity in 4 out of the 8 galaxies with robust emission line detections, based on line ratio diagnostics. Our findings suggest that there are a diverse range of quenching mechanisms at cosmic noon, and support a scenario in which the primary quenching mechanisms are rapid ($<500$ Myr) following a starburst.

 - **Abstract**
 For weak gravitational lensing cosmology with the forthcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, image coaddition, or construction of oversampled images from undersampled ones, is a critical step in the image processing pipeline. In the previous papers in this series, we have re-implemented the {\sc Imcom} algorithm, which offers control over point spread functions in coadded images, and applied it to state-of-the-art image simulations for Roman. In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of {\sc Imcom} hyperparameters on the quality of measurement results. We re-coadd the same $16$ blocks ($1.75 \times 1.75 \,{\rm arcmin}^2$, $2688 \times 2688$ pixels each) from OpenUniverse2024 simulations with $26$ different configurations in each of $5$ bands. We then compare the results in terms of $12$ objective evaluation criteria, including internal diagnostics of {\sc Imcom}, properties of coadded noise frames, measurements of injected point sources, and time consumption. We demonstrate that: i) the Cholesky kernel is the best known linear algebra strategy for {\sc Imcom}, ii) in general, a wide Gaussian target output PSF outperforms a smoothed Airy disk or a narrow Gaussian, iii) kernel-specific settings are worth considering for future coaddition, and iv) {\sc Imcom} experimental features studied in this work are either inconsequential or detrimental. We end this paper by discussing current and next steps of {\sc Imcom}-related studies in the context of Roman shear and clustering measurements.

 - **Abstract**
 With JWST, it is now possible to use Lyman-Alpha (Ly$\alpha$) emission from galaxies beyond z>8 to trace neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium (IGM) as the Universe became reionized. However, observed Ly$\alpha$ emission is scattered by neutral hydrogen in the IGM and the interstellar and circum-galactic medium, necessitating `baseline' models of Ly$\alpha$ properties in the ionized IGM to disentangle their impacts. In this work, we characterize Ly$\alpha$ properties at the end of reionization, z~5-6, providing a baseline that can be applied to z>6 observations. We targeted GOODS-N with MMT/Binospec, obtaining R~4360 rest-frame UV spectra of 236 galaxies at z~5-6, selected from HST/CANDELS, finding 62 Ly$\alpha$ detections. We use JWST observations from JADES and FRESCO for a subset of our sources to characterize Ly$\alpha$ properties as a function of UV continuum and H$\alpha$ emission. We present the first statistical measurements of the Ly$\alpha$ FWHM distribution at z~5-6, and produce empirical baseline models of Ly$\alpha$ equivalent width (EWLy$\alpha$) and escape fraction (f$_{esc}^{Ly\alpha}$) conditional on UV magnitude and slope. We find our EWLy$\alpha$ and f$_{esc}^{Ly\alpha}$ models depend on UV magnitude, and infer 45$\pm$5$\%$ and <62$\pm$8$\%$ of MUV=-19.5 galaxies have EWLy$\alpha$>25$Å$ and f$_{esc}^{Ly\alpha}$>0.2, respectively. We find a mean Ly$\alpha$ FWHM of 245km/s and median Ly$\alpha$ velocity offset of 258km/s, both correlating with higher UV luminosity. Our median observed Ly$\alpha$ line profile is broader and has higher velocity offset compared to pre-JWST models based on z~2 lines, which may reflect resonant scattering by residual neutral hydrogen in the IGM at z~5-6 and increasing ISM/CGM densities. Our median line profile predicts higher Ly$\alpha$ transmission in a fully neutral IGM, providing insight into recent z>10 Ly$\alpha$ detections.
#### The Timescales of Embedded Star Formation as Observed in STARFORGE

 - **Abstract**
 Star formation occurs within dusty molecular clouds that are then disrupted by stellar feedback. However, the timing and physical mechanisms that govern the transition from deeply embedded to exposed stars remain uncertain. Using the STARFORGE simulations, we analyze the evolution of ``embeddedness'', identifying what drives emergence. We find the transition from embedded to exposed is fast for individual stars, within 1.3 Myr after the star reaches its maximum mass. This rapid transition is dominated by massive stars, which accrete while remaining highly obscured until their feedback eventually balances, then overcomes, the local accretion. For these massive stars, their maximum mass is reached simultaneously with their emergence. Once these stars are revealed, their localized, pre-supernova feedback then impacts the cloud, driving gas clearance. Because massive stars dominate the luminosity, their fast, local evolution dominates the light emergence from the dust. We calculate the dependence of these processes on the mass of the cloud and find that emergence always depends on when massive stars form, which scales with the cloud's free-fall time. We also examine the evolution of dust emission and H$\alpha$ luminosity. We find that dust dominates the luminosity for roughly 2 Myrs before stellar luminosity becomes more luminous. These results suggest that deeply embedded star-forming clusters tend to be rare compared to those partially exposed. Thus, because the initial embedding of the most luminous stars is highly local, the emergence of stars is a faster, earlier, more local event than the overall disruption of the cloud by gas expulsion.

 - **Abstract**
 We present observations and analyses of three high-magnification microlensing events: KMT-2022-BLG-0954, KMT-2024-BLG-0697, and MOA-2024-BLG-018. All three exhibit the "Planet/Binary" degeneracy, with planetary solutions corresponding to mass ratios in the range $-3.7 < \log q < -2.2$, while the binary solutions yield $\log q > -2.0$. For KMT-2022-BLG-0954, we identify a previously unrecognized degeneracy among planetary solutions, involving different mass ratios and normalized source radii. In all three cases, single-lens binary-source models are excluded. Bayesian analyses suggest that the planetary solutions correspond to gas giants orbiting M/K dwarfs beyond the snow line, while KMT-2022-BLG-0954 also admits an alternative interpretation as a super-Earth orbiting a late-type M dwarf. The binary solutions imply a diverse set of systems, including M-dwarf pairs and M-dwarf--brown-dwarf binaries. A review of known events subject to the "Planet/Binary" degeneracy shows that in most cases the degeneracy cannot be resolved through follow-up high-resolution imaging, particularly in the presence of the newly identified degeneracy.

 - **Abstract**
 The Milky Way's galactic center is a highly dynamical, crowded environment. Gamma ray observations of this region, such as the excess of GeV scale gamma rays observed by Fermi LAT, have been of tremendous interest to both the high energy astrophysics and particle physics communities. However, nearly all past studies of gamma ray emission make simplifying assumptions about cosmic ray (CR) propagation that may not be valid in the galactic center. Recent numerical breakthroughs now enable fully time dependent dynamical evolution of CRs in magnetohydrodynamic simulations with resolved, multi phase small scale structure in the interstellar medium (ISM), allowing self consistent comparisons to the Milky Way cosmic ray spectrum. We model diffuse gamma ray emission from cosmic ray interactions for a set of Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE) simulations of Milky Way mass galaxies run with spectrally resolved cosmic ray spectra for multiple species at MeV to TeV energies. We find that the galactic center gamma ray spectrum can vary by order of magnitude amounts in normalization, and by approx. 10 percent in spectral slope at high energies, driven by both injection from highly variable star formation and losses from variable structure in the turbulent ISM. Gamma ray emission from inverse Compton scattering and relativistic nonthermal Bremsstrahlung is particularly variable on Myr timescales. We argue that features of the observed Milky Way gamma ray spectrum may arise from such transient phenomena in gamma rays produced from CR interactions.

 - **Abstract**
 Under the assumptions of General Relativity (GR), gravitational waves propagate at the speed of light and their mediation can be represented as a particle through a massless graviton. We investigate the impact and observability of the presence of a massive graviton, how such a modification to GR would also modify the propagation of observed gravitational waves from astrophysical sources, and how this effect can be used as an independent measurement of cosmological parameters, focusing on the Hubble parameter $H_0$ and matter energy $\Omega_m$. We simulate the impact of a massive graviton on compact binary coalescence observations in a near-future LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA interferometer network through a modification to the gravitational wave phase in the post-Newtonian framework. Our analysis finds that if we assume the presence of a graviton with a Compton wavelength of $\lambda_G \approx 5 \times 10^{16}$m, corresponding to a mass $m_G \leq 2.3 \times 10^{-23}$eV/c$^2$, we can utilize a simulated population of 60 binary black hole observations to constrain $H_0$ to a similar precision as current gravitational wave constraints without electromagnetic counterparts (at $90\%$ credible intervals): $H_0 = 58^{+34}_{-19}\,\mathrm{km\; s^{-1}\; Mpc^{-1}}$ and $\Omega_m=0.29^{+0.10}_{-0.08}$. More sensitive observatories will be necessary to probe lower values in the graviton mass range and fully exploit this method.

 - **Abstract**
 Collisionless, turbulent plasmas surround the Earth, from the magnetosphere to the intergalactic medium, and the fluctuations within them affect nearly every field in the space sciences, from space weather forecasts to theories of galaxy formation. Where turbulent motions become supersonic, their interactions can lead to the formation of shocks, which are known to efficiently energize ions to cosmic-ray energies. We present 2.5-dimensional, hybrid-kinetic simulations of decaying, supersonic, non-relativistic turbulence in a collisionless plasma using the code dHybridR. Turbulence within these simulations is highly compressible; after accounting for this compression by taking the omni-directional power-spectrum of the density weighted velocity field, we find turbulent spectra with power-law slopes of $\alpha \approx -\frac{5}{3}$ for low Mach numbers, in the inertial range, and $\alpha \approx -2$ for high Mach numbers. Ions embedded in the highly supersonic simulations are accelerated to non-thermal energies at efficiencies similar to those seen in shocks, despite being in a non-relativistic regime and lacking the large scale structure of a shock. We observe that particles are accelerated into a power-law spectrum, with a slope of $q \approx 2.5$ in (non-relativistic) energy. We compare these results to those obtained from the theory and simulations of diffusive shock acceleration, and discuss the astrophysical implications of this theoretical work.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar mergers are responsible for a large variety of astrophysical phenomena. They form blue straggler stars, give rise to spectacular transients, and produce some of the most massive stars in the Universe. Here, we focus on mergers from binary evolution and stellar collisions but do not cover mergers involving compact objects. We review how mergers come about, explain the physics and outcome of the merger process, discuss the evolution and ultimate fates of merged stars, and relate to observations. Our main conclusions are: (i) Mergers of main-sequence stars often fully rejuvenate and have interior structures similar to genuine single stars. (ii) Contrarily, mergers involving post-main-sequence stars can have interior structures that cannot be achieved by single-star evolution. Such merged stars may become long-lived blue supergiants that can explode in SN1987A-like events, interacting and superluminous supernovae, ultra-long gamma-ray bursts or collapse into very massive black holes. These black holes may even populate the pair-instability-supernova black-hole mass gap. (iii) Strong magnetic fields are produced in stellar mergers. Merged stars may thus be at the origin of some magnetic OBA stars and their descendants, highly magnetic white dwarfs and neutron stars. (iv) Initially, stellar merger products rotate rapidly, but there are several mechanisms that can quickly spin them down. Hence, merged stars may be rather slow rotators for most of their evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. A key property of massive stars is their high degree of multiplicity, which can impact their evolution and end-of-life products. The Southern Massive Stars at High Angular Resolution survey (smash+) use interferometric and high-angular resolution techniques to detect companions at intermediate separations, from about 1 milli-arsec to 8"), a domain that so far has remained largely unexplored. Aims. In this paper, we convert the angular separations and magnitude contrasts into physical units, i.e. projected physical separations and mass ratios. We also derive the sensitivity of the survey for various physical and orbital parameters. Methods. We develop a spectral-type/luminosity class -- H-band luminosity -- mass calibration based on existing grids of physical parameters of OBA stars and we use these to obtain the photometric distance to each system, correcting for all known companions within the 2MASS point-spread function. We also derive the individual masses of the primaries and of each detected companion. Results The probability of detecting companions is very uniform within the sensitivity limits of the \smash\ survey. The projected separations follow a flat power-law distribution in log-separation. The obtained mass ratios are compatible with the power-law distributions derived for spectroscopic binaries. Finally, we find a uniform mass-ratio distribution up to ~100 AU. Beyond ~100 AU, we observe a lack of equal-mass companions, with an upper mass-ratio limit declining towards larger separations.

 - **Abstract**
 The spatiotemporal inhomogeneous-homogeneous transition in the dynamics and structures of solar photospheric turbulence is studied by applying the complexity-entropy analysis to Hinode images of a vortical region of supergranular junctions in the quiet Sun. During a period of supergranular vortex expansion of 37.5 min, the spatiotemporal dynamics of the line-of-sight magnetic field and the horizontal electromagnetic energy flux display the characteristics of inverse turbulent cascade, evidenced by the formation of a large magnetic coherent structure via the merger of two small magnetic elements trapped by a long-duration vortex. Both magnetic and Poynting fluxes exhibit an admixture of chaos and stochasticity in the complexity-entropy plane, involving a temporal transition from low to high complexity and a temporal transition from high to low entropy during the period of vortex expansion, consistent with Hinode observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Near-ultraviolet (NUV) radiation from dwarf stars plays a critical role in shaping the habitability of planetary systems, yet its long-term evolution across different spectral types remains poorly investigated. Based on GALEX NUV observations, we study the evolution of stellar NUV emission for a sample of 386,500 A- to M-type dwarfs spanning ages from 3 Myr to 10 Gyr, drawn from both open clusters and the field. The normalized NUV emission ($f_{\rm NUV}/f_{\rm J}$) is used to trace the evolutionary trends. Our results reveal distinct evolutionary pathways after considering the distance completeness: A and early-F dwarfs show a weak decline in NUV emission during the main-sequence phase; late-F to G dwarfs exhibit a clear decrease, consistent with continuous spin-down driven by magnetic braking; late-K and M-dwarfs undergo a rapid decline in NUV emission when they evolve from young stellar objects to main-sequence stars. Furthermore, we construct the evolutionary tracks of stellar ultraviolet habitable zone (UHZ). By comparing stellar circumstellar habitable zone (CHZ) and UHZ, we find that G- and K-type stars offer the most stable overlap between thermal and UV habitability over long-term evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Fibrils are dynamic plasma structures in the solar chromosphere. Studying these structures is critical for understanding solar atmospheric heating and mass transportation. The purpose of this study is to obtain the characteristics of fibrils surrounding the filament. By employing high-resolution H-alpha data obtained from the New Vacuum Solar Telescope (NVST), we undertake a detailed analysis of the properties of 63 fibrils situated in the vicinity of the filament. Comparing the fibrils on both sides of the filament demonstrates that these fibrils have similar physical properties except for their orientation. The properties of fibrils are statistically measured, including lifetimes of 150-650 s, widths of 320-850 km, maximum lengths of 3-8.5 Mm, projection velocities of 7-29 km/s, and decelerations of 45-474 m/s2. The dominant oscillation period of fibrils is predominantly concentrated in the range of 4.8-6.6 minutes (2.5-3.5 mHz). Transverse oscillations are identified in a subset of fibrils, with periodicities of 269-289 s and phase speeds of 13.7-25.8 km/s, indicating the presence of kink-mode magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves.

 - **Abstract**
 The Mg I 12.32 {\mu}m line is highly sensitive to magnetic fields due to its long wavelength, making it a promising tool for precise solar-magnetic-field measurements. The formation of this line is significantly influenced by nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) effects. Previous studies have shown that the Mg I 12.32 {\mu}m line exhibits different behaviors in various regions of the Sun. This study focuses on the peak intensity of the Mg I 12.32 {\mu}m line to analyze its relationship with the physical parameters of the solar atmosphere and its formation mechanism. We employed the Rybicki-Hummer (RH) 1.5D radiative transfer code to synthesize the Stokes profiles of the Mg I 12.32 {\mu}m line based on a three-dimensional solar atmospheric model of a sunspot and its surrounding quiet Sun. By computing Rxi{\Delta}xi, where Rxi is the average response function and {\Delta}xi is the difference in physical parameters between the two models being compared, we identified the atmospheric height and physical parameters that most significantly influence the normalized peak intensity in the quiet Sun and the active region, respectively. In analyzing the synthesized Stokes profiles, we found two key features: (1) in the quiet Sun, the normalized peak intensity is strong at the centers of the granules and weakens in the intergranular lanes; (2) in the sunspot umbra, the normalized peak intensity is generally weak, with only a few areas showing evident emission. Through the analysis of the response functions, we identified the causes of these differences. In addition, we discussed the mechanisms through which these physical parameters influence the normalized peak intensity.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the deepest 21-cm spectral line and 1.4 GHz broad-band continuum observations of nearby early-type spiral galaxy NGC 1371 as part of the MeerKAT HI Observations of Nearby Galactic Objects: Observing Southern Emitters (MHONGOOSE) survey. We found the neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) mostly distributed in a regularly rotating disc with a hole $\sim5$ kpc wide around the galactic centre. The continuum observations reveal, within the HI hole, emission from one of the lowest luminosity AGN known to date and from two unique $\sim10$-kpc wide bipolar bubbles never observed before in this galaxy. The properties of the bubbles suggest that they may result from the impact of the low-power radio jet propagating within the gaseous disk instead of perpendicular to it. We found indication for jet-induced ionised outflows within the HI hole but no molecular gas (upper limit of $M_{\text{H$_2$}}<2\times10^5\text{ M$_\odot$}$) is detected. The emerging picture is that the gas in the central regions has been rapidly depleted by the stellar bar or, despite its low power, the AGN in NGC 1371 is efficiently heating and/or removing the gas through the jets and possibly by radiative winds, leading to the inside-out quenching of the galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 Since ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) are electrically charged particles, they are deflected by magnetic fields. Those magnetic fields can act as lenses, altering their trajectories and (de)magnifying their apparent source images. These deflections of UHECR trajectories can lead to phenomena such as the appearance of multiple images of an extragalactic source. In this study, we investigate the influence of the Galactic Magnetic Field (GMF) on the propagation of UHECRs, considering four different realistic models for the GMF: the PT11, the JF12, the UF23, and the KST24 models. We investigate how an isotropic flux on Earth would have entered the edge of the Galaxy for different rigidity values from 1 to 100 EV. In addition, we investigate the appearance of multiple images of astrophysical point sources. Furthermore, we analyze the modification of the cosmic ray flux from a source as a function of the rigidity and its dependence on the chosen GMF model. Since the deflection induced by the magnetic field depends on the rigidity of the particle, the effects vary among different nuclear species. Consequently, our findings can have implications for interpreting mass-composition and anisotropy observations, as the rigidity-dependent deflections directly alter the observed UHECR arrival direction distribution.

 - **Abstract**
 The millisecond pulsar PSR J1713+0747 is a high-priority target for pulsar timing array experiments due to its long-term timing stability, and bright, narrow pulse profile. In April 2021, PSR~J1713$+$0747 underwent a significant profile change event, observed by several telescopes worldwide. Using the broad-bandwidth and polarimetric fidelity of the Ultra-Wideband Low-frequency receiver on Murriyang, CSIRO's Parkes radio telescope, we investigated the long-term spectro-polarimetric behaviour of this profile change in detail. We highlight the broad-bandwidth nature of the event, which exhibits frequency dependence that is inconsistent with cold-plasma propagation effects. We also find that spectral and temporal variations are stronger in one of the orthogonal polarisation modes than the other, and observe mild variations ($\sim 3$ - $5\,\sigma$ significance) in circular polarisation above 1400 MHz following the event. However, the linear polarisation position angle remained remarkably stable in the profile leading edge throughout the event. With over three years of data post-event, we find that the profile has not yet recovered back to its original state, indicating a long-term asymptotic recovery, or a potential reconfiguration of the pulsar's magnetic field. These findings favour a magnetospheric origin of the profile change event over a line-of-sight propagation effect in the interstellar medium.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the complex interactions between convection, magnetic fields, and rotation is key to modeling the internal dynamics of the Sun and stars. Under rotational influence, compressible convection forms prograde-propagating convective columns near the equator. The interaction between such rotating columnar convection and the small-scale dynamo (SSD) remains largely unexplored. We investigate the influence of the SSD on the properties of rotating convection in the equatorial regions of solar and stellar convection zones. A series of rotating compressible magnetoconvection simulations is performed using a local f-plane box model at the equator. The flux-based Coriolis number Co is varied systematically. To isolate the effects of the SSD, we compare results from hydrodynamic (HD) and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. The SSD affects both convective heat and angular momentum transport. In MHD cases, convective velocity decreases more rapidly with increasing Co than in HD cases. This reduction is compensated by enhanced entropy fluctuations, maintaining overall heat transport efficiency. Furthermore, a weakly subadiabatic layer is maintained near the base of the convection zone even under strong rotational influence when the SSD is present. These behaviors reflect a change in the dominant force balance: the SSD introduces a magnetostrophic balance at small scales, while geostrophic balance persists at larger scales. The inclusion of the SSD also reduces the dominant horizontal scale of columnar convective modes by enhancing the effective rotational influence. Regarding angular momentum transport, the SSD generates Maxwell stresses that counteract the Reynolds stresses, thereby quenching the generation of mean shear flows. These SSD effects should be accounted for in models of solar and stellar convection.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy evolution is sensitive to how stars inject feedback into their surroundings. In particular, stellar feedback from star clusters strongly affects gas motions and the baryonic cycle, with more massive clusters having stronger effects. Our previous results show that the star cluster mass distribution in dwarf galaxies depends on feedback, as strong pre-SN feedback, particularly ionizing radiation, results in fewer high-mass clusters. We investigate the mass distribution of gas clouds in dwarf galaxies. Since clusters form from collapsing gas clouds, we expect a similar feedback dependence in both distributions, so we hypothesize that pre-SN feedback yields fewer high-mass clouds. To test this, we use an isocontour analysis at cutoff densities of $10,\ 10^{1.5},\ 10^{2}$ cm$^{-3}$ to identify clouds in dwarf galaxy simulations run with the RAMSES adaptive mesh refinement code. We calculate mass distributions for models with different combinations of SNe, stellar winds, and ionizing radiation. We find that the mass distribution for clouds with $n>100$ cm$^{-3}$ is independent of feedback, but the distribution for complexes with $n>10$ cm$^{-3}$ is more top-heavy in the presence of radiation. Winds do not affect the distribution at any scale. This contradicts our hypothesis that cloud and cluster mass distributions respond similarly to feedback. Instead, the dense cloud mass function shows no feedback dependence, suggesting its shape is set by gravity. We conclude that the cluster mass function must be shaped by intra-cloud feedback regulating star formation and, in the case of radiation, effects on parent cloud temperature. (shortened)

 - **Abstract**
 The Fe xxii doublet has been previously used to determine the density of collisionally ionized emission from magnetic cataclysmic variable stars. We test how this diagnostic doublet behaves for a photoionized plasma with an active galactic nucleus (AGN) spectral energy distribution (SED). We use the photoionized plasma code pion and ~440 ks of archival Chandra HETG for the well-known Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 1068 to test the behaviour of the Fe xxii doublet in the context of an AGN. This marks the first time these data have been examined with pion. We find that in a photoionized plasma, the Fe xxii doublet is dependent on the density, ionization state, and SED used. Thus, this density diagnostic remains model-dependent. In the context of NGC 1068 the doublet predicts an emission region ~100 rg from the central black hole. This would require a direct line of sight to the central engine, which is at odds with the Seyfert 2 nature of this source. In practice, these results highlight the complexities and challenges of applying photoionized models. With these data, we cannot exclude the possibility of a direct line of sight to the central engine of NGC 1068, but we cannot confirm it. Future observations with instruments such as Athena are needed to explore the Fe xxii doublet further.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent studies indicate that the formation of planets in protoplanetary disks begins early in the embedded Class 0/I phases of protostellar evolution. The physical and chemical makeup of the embedded phase can provide valuable insights into the process of star and planet formation. This study aims to provide a thorough overview of the various morphologies for molecular emissions observed on disk scales toward nearby embedded sources. We present high angular resolution (0.1", 15 au) molecular line emissions for $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, C$^{18}$O, SO, SiO, DCN, CH$_3$OH, H$_2$CO, and c-C$_3$H$_2$ towards 19 nearby protostellar sources in the context of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Large Program "Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk)". Emissions in $^{12}$CO are seen towards all sources and primarily trace outflowing materials. A few sources also show high-velocity jets in SiO emission and high-velocity channel maps of $^{12}$CO. The $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O emissions are well-known tracers of high-density regions and trace the inner envelope and disk regions with clear signs of rotation seen at continuum scales. The large-scale emissions of $^{13}$CO also delineate the outflow cavity walls where the outflowing and infalling materials interact with each other, and exposure to UV radiation leads to the formation of hydrocarbons such as c-C$_3$H$_2$. Both DCN and CH$_3$OH, when detected, show compact emissions from the inner envelope and disk regions that peak at the position of the protostar. The CH$_3$OH emissions are contained within the region of DCN emissions, which suggests that CH$_3$OH traces the hot core regions. Likewise, a few sources also display emissions in CH$_3$OH towards the outflow. Both SO and H$_2$CO show complex morphology among the sources, suggesting that they are formed through multiple processes in protostellar systems.
#### Magnetar-like flares behind the high-energy emission in LS 5039

 - **Abstract**
 LS 5039 hosts a high-mass star, and a compact object that might be a strongly magnetized neutron star (NS). This scenario requires a mechanism to power its persistent and strong non-thermal emission. We investigate a mechanism in which the non-steady interaction structure of the stellar and the NS winds can regularly excite NS magnetospheric activity, releasing extra energy and fueling the source non-thermal emission. The NS wind shocked by the stellar wind can recurrently touch the NS magnetosphere, triggering magnetic instabilities whose growth can release extra energy into the NS wind in a cyclic manner. To illustrate and study the impact of these cycles on the two-wind interaction structure on different scales, we performed relativistic hydrodynamics simulations in 2D and 3D with periods of an enhanced power in the NS wind along the orbit. We also used analytical tools to characterize processes near the NS relevant for the non-thermal emission. As the NS wind termination shock touches the magnetosphere energy dissipation occurs, but the whole shocked two-wind structure is eventually driven away halting the extra energy injection. However, due to the corresponding drop in the NS wind ram pressure, the termination shock propagates back towards the magnetosphere, resuming the process. These activity cycles excite strong waves in the shocked flows, intensifying their mixing and the disruption of their spiral-like structure produced by orbital motion. Further downstream, the shocked winds can become a quasi-stable, relatively smooth flow. The recurrent interaction between the NS magnetosphere and shocked wind can fuel a relativistic outflow powerful enough to explain the non-thermal emission of LS 5039. A magnetospheric multipolar magnetic field much stronger than the dipolar one may provide the required energetics, and help to explain the lack of evidence of a recent supernova remnant.

 - **Abstract**
 The escape of Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) radiation encodes valuable information on the neutral interstellar medium and is often used as a proxy for the escape of ionizing photons. Yet, the theory of Ly$\alpha$ transfer through anisotropic gas distributions remains underdeveloped. We present Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations of Ly$\alpha$ propagation through porous, inhomogeneous neutral gas, systematically exploring the effects of channel geometry, outflows, dust, and lognormally distributed column densities. We find that Ly$\alpha$ photons do not preferentially escape through the lowest-column-density pathways, but instead traverse channels of substantial optical depth, leading to suppressed central flux and the absence of strongly beamed escape. Subdividing channels has little impact, indicating that geometry and covering fraction are more important than porosity. Channels containing moderate amounts of neutral hydrogen alter escape in characteristic ways, including the appearance of quadruple-peaked spectra, which can be captured by a simple flux-channel relation. Outflows reshape the spectra by facilitating escape through dense media, redshifting photons and blending central features, while dust modulates the visibility of small channels by suppressing flux at line center; in both cases, we develop an analytical model that predicts the resulting central fluxes. Extending to lognormal column density fields, we show that Ly$\alpha$ photons probe a broad range of optical depths, producing skewed spectra that can be approximated by weighted sums of homogeneous models. Our results have direct implications for using Ly$\alpha$ as a tracer of gas properties and ionizing photon escape; for instance, spectra suggestive of high column densities may nonetheless allow LyC leakage through narrow channels.

 - **Abstract**
 An analysis of the tilt angles of the active regions in 15-24 activity cycles was performed. We used data from measurements of magnetic fields in the sunspot umbra in the period 1918 -2019 at the Mount Wilson Observatory, as well as the tilt angles of active regions in 'white' light at the Kodaikanal and Mount Wilson observatories in activity cycles 15-21. The mean tilt angles of active regions $\overline{\gamma}$ and the slope $\mu$ from latitude $\theta$ in the activity cycles are considered. Low-latitude bipoles are the most important in predicting the strength of solar cycles. In this work, we selected the cutoff latitude $\theta_{cut}$ at which the highest correlation is observed with the strength of the next activity cycle for active regions with latitude $\theta<\theta_{cut}$. It was found that for magnetic field measurement data, the highest correlation of the parameters $\overline{\gamma}$ and $\mu$ with the strength of the next solar activity cycle is characteristic of bipoles in the equatorial zone with $\theta<\theta_{cut}\approx 14.2^o$. For white light observation data, $\theta_{cut}\approx 8.5^o$ for Mount Wilson observatory and $\theta_{cut}\approx 9.4^o$ for Kodaikanal observatory.
#### 3D Macro Physics and Light Odd-Z Element Production in O-C Shell Mergers: Implications for $^{40}\mathrm{K}$ production and radiogenic heating inventories of rocky exoplanets

 - **Abstract**
 The light odd-Z elements P, Cl, K, and Sc are underproduced in galactic chemical evolution models compared to spectroscopic observations of stars in the Milky Way. The most promising solution to this puzzle is that some massive stars experience O-C shell mergers boosting their yields through dynamic, convective-reactive nucleosynthesis. We report how convective macro physics based on 3D $4\pi$ hydrodynamic simulations impacts production in the O shell by post-processing the $\mathrm{M_{ZAMS}}=15~\mathrm{M_\odot}$ $Z=0.02$ model from the NuGrid dataset. We explore a mixing downturn, boosted velocities, reduced ingestion rate, and convective quenching. Across 24 mixing cases, the pre-explosive yields for [P/Fe], [Cl/Fe], [K/Fe], and [Sc/Fe] are modified by $[-0.33,0.23]~\mathrm{dex}$, $[-0.84,0.64]~\mathrm{dex}$, $[-0.78,1.48]~\mathrm{dex}$, and $[-0.36,1.29]~\mathrm{dex}$, respectively. Cases with a convective downturn with the fastest ingestion rate have the largest enhancement, and production is non-monotonic with boosted velocities. Which reactions are most important for the convective-reactive element production pathways depends on the mixing. We parameterize production of $^{40}\mathrm{K}$ ($t_{1/2} = 1.248~\mathrm{Gyr}$), an important radiogenic heat source for younger ($2{-}3~\mathrm{Gyr}$) rocky planets and find a yield variation exceeding three orders of magnitude. This range of initial abundances for $^{40}\mathrm{K}$ implies the early geodynamic behaviour of silicate mantles in rocky planets can differ greatly from that of Earth. These results underscore the importance of investigating the 3D macro physics of shell merger convection through hydrodynamic simulations to develop a predictive understanding of the origin and variability of the light odd-Z elements and the $^{40}\mathrm{K}/\mathrm{K}$ ratio in planet host stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Optical Forbidden Emission Lines (FELs) come from transitions with long radiative decay times needing low density gas where collisions between atoms are rare. They are produced in the outflows driven by young stellar objects. These lines trace distinct velocity components, including a Low Velocity Component (LVC), which may be tracing a magneto hydrodynamic (MHD) or photoevaporative (PE) wind. We study the jet and LVC of the star DG Tau, whose jet velocity has decreased since 2006. We aim to investigate a link between the high velocity jet and the LVC and clarify the LVC origin as an MHD or PE wind by studying spectral \& spatial changes over time. Using kinematic fitting \& spectro-astrometry, we analyse three epochs of spectra spanning ~18 years. A ~100 km/s decrease in velocity from 2003 to 2021 aligns with known slowing of the jet. Fitting of the [O I] {\lambda}6300, [O I] {\lambda}5577, and [S II] {\lambda}6731 lines reveal complex FEL profiles, with up to six blue-shifted components and a redshifted wing, in agreement with Chou et al. (2025). We see three LVC sub-components (LVC-H, LVC-M, and LVC-L) that are consistent with entrained jet material, disk wind, and dense upper disk atmosphere respectively. While jet components vary in time, the LVC remains quite stable, with changes in the relative brightness of each sub-component. The results cannot distinguish between a MHD or PE wind origin for the LVC. A limit of less than 2 au is put on the de projected height of the LVC-M in [O I] {\lambda}5577, where there is no jet contribution. This supports a disk wind and may favor an MHD wind origin. The near constant peak velocity of LVC-M needs further study in context of a shared origin for jets and MHD winds. Future work needs observations with higher spectral resolution and time cadence to resolve blended components and examine a possible time lag between changes in the jet and LVC.
