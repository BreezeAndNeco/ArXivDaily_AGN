 - **Abstract**
 The presence of massive black holes (BHs) exceeding $10^9\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$ already at redshift $z > 6$ challenges standard models of BH growth. Super-Eddington (SE) accretion has emerged as a promising mechanism to solve this issue, yet its impact on early BH evolution in tailored numerical experiments remains largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate the growth of BH seeds embedded in a gas-rich, metal-poor protogalaxy at $z \sim 15$, using a suite of high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations that implement a slim-disc-based SE accretion model. We explore a broad parameter space varying the initial BH mass, feedback efficiency, and spin. We find that SE accretion enables rapid growth in all cases, allowing BHs to accrete up to $10^5\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$ within a few $10^3$-$10^4$ years, independent of seed properties. Feedback regulates this process, both by depleting central gas and altering BH dynamics via star formation-driven potential fluctuations, yet even the strongest feedback regimes permit significantly greater growth than the Eddington-limited case. Growth stalls after less than $\sim$1 Myr due to local gas exhaustion, as no large-scale inflows are present in the adopted numerical setup. Our results show that SE accretion naturally leads to BHs that are over-massive relative to their host galaxy stellar content, consistent with JWST observations. We conclude that short, low-duty-cycle SE episodes represent a viable pathway for assembling the most massive BHs observed at early cosmic times, even starting from light seeds.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a grid of rotating supergiant models from post-main sequence binary merger products, constructed by the MESA stellar evolution code. We focus on the evolution of these stars until core-collapse, in addition to their rotation, which could influence their mass loss and explosion phenomenology. We find that (i) as in previous studies, larger mass gain by merger favors the production of blue supergiants (BSGs) over red supergiants, and (ii) merger products that end as BSGs at core collapse have rotating outer envelopes, with lower-mass BSGs having faster envelope rotation due to less wind mass loss. We model the expected transients from these BSGs upon core-collapse, considering cases where the neutrino-driven explosion is successful and unsuccessful. The successful explosions result in supernovae (SNe) with long-rising light curves of morphology similar to SN 1987A. Failed explosions of these BSGs result in envelope fallback of $\sim (0.1$- several) $~M_\odot$ over $10^3$-$10^5$ seconds that power strong ($10^{51}$-$10^{53}$ erg) accretion-driven outflows in winds and possibly jets, with relativistic jets (if formed) generally capable of breaking out of the BSG envelope. Our modeling points to these merger-origin BSGs as viable progenitors for SN 1987A-like SNe, ultra-long gamma-ray bursts, and some of the fast luminous transients found in high-cadence optical surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the COLIBRE galaxy formation model and the COLIBRE suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. COLIBRE includes new models for radiative cooling, dust grains, star formation, stellar mass loss, turbulent diffusion, pre-supernova stellar feedback, supernova feedback, supermassive black holes and active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback. The multiphase interstellar medium is explicitly modelled without a pressure floor. Hydrogen and helium are tracked in non-equilibrium, with their contributions to the free electron density included in metal-line cooling calculations. The chemical network is coupled to a dust model that tracks three grain species and two grain sizes. In addition to the fiducial thermally-driven AGN feedback, a subset of simulations uses black hole spin-dependent hybrid jet/thermal AGN feedback. To suppress spurious transfer of energy from dark matter to stars, dark matter is supersampled by a factor 4, yielding similar dark matter and baryonic particle masses. The subgrid feedback model is calibrated to match the observed $z \approx 0$ galaxy stellar mass function, galaxy sizes, and black hole masses in massive galaxies. The COLIBRE suite includes three resolutions, with particle masses of $\sim 10^5$, $10^6$, and $10^7\,\text{M}_\odot$ in cubic volumes of up to 50, 200, and 400 cMpc on a side, respectively. The two largest runs use 136 billion ($5 \times 3008^3$) particles. We describe the model, assess its strengths and limitations, and present both visual impressions and quantitative results. Comparisons with various low-redshift galaxy observations generally show very good numerical convergence and excellent agreement with the data.

 - **Abstract**
 Star formation in galaxies is regulated by the interplay of a range of processes that shape the multiphase gas in the interstellar and circumgalactic media. Using the CAMELS suite of cosmological simulations, we study the effects of varying feedback and cosmology on the average star formation histories (SFHs) of galaxies at $z\sim0$ across the IllustrisTNG, SIMBA and ASTRID galaxy formation models. We find that galaxy SFHs in all three models are sensitive to changes in stellar feedback, which affects the efficiency of baryon cycling and the rates at which central black holes grow, while effects of varying AGN feedback depend on model-dependent implementations of black hole seeding, accretion and feedback. We also find strong interaction terms that couple stellar and AGN feedback, usually by regulating the amount of gas available for the central black hole to accrete. Using a double power-law to describe the average SFHs, we derive a general set of equations relating the shape of the SFHs to physical quantities like baryon fraction and black hole mass across all three models. We find that a single set of equations (albeit with different coefficients) can describe the SFHs across all three CAMELS models, with cosmology dominating the SFH at early times, followed by halo accretion, and feedback and baryon cycling at late times. Galaxy SFHs provide a novel, complementary probe to constrain cosmology and feedback, and can connect the observational constraints from current and upcoming galaxy surveys with the physical mechanisms responsible for regulating galaxy growth and quenching.

 - **Abstract**
 Photoevaporative models predict that the lower edge of the Neptune desert is sculpted by atmospheric mass loss. However, the stellar high energy fluxes that power hydrodynamic escape and set predicted mass loss rates can be uncertain by multiple orders of magnitude. These uncertainties can be bypassed by studying mass loss for planets within the same system, as they have effectively undergone scaled versions of the same irradiation history. The TOI-4010 system is an ideal test case for mass loss models, as it contains three Neptune-sized planets with planet b located in the `Neptune desert', planet c in the `Neptune ridge', and planet d in the `Neptune savanna'. Using Keck/NIRSPEC, we measured the metastable helium transit depths of all three planets in order to search for evidence of atmospheric escape. We place upper bounds on the excess helium absorption of 1.23\%, 0.81\%, and 0.87\% at 95\% confidence for TOI-4010~b, c and d respectively. We fit our transmission spectra with Parker wind models and find that this corresponds to 95th-percentile upper limits of $10^{10.17}$g~s$^{-1}$, $10^{10.53}$g~s$^{-1}$, and $10^{10.50}$g~s$^{-1}$ on the mass loss rates of TOI-4010~b, c, and d respectively. Our non-detections are inconsistent with expectations from one-dimensional hydrodynamic models for solar composition atmospheres. We consider potential reductions in signal from a decreased host star XUV luminosity, planetary magnetic fields, enhanced atmospheric metallicities, and fractionation, and explore the implications of our measurements for the past evaporation histories of all three planets.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we present novel calculations of X-ray polarization from radio-quiet and unobscured active galactic nuclei (AGNs) using the Monte Carlo code MONK, which includes all general and special relativity effects. Our geometric model, referred to as the ``wedge corona'', features a homogeneous cloud of electrons characterized by an aspect ratio of h/r and a radius that extends down to the innermost stable circular orbit around the central black hole (BH). Adopting the physical parameters of the Seyfert galaxy NGC 4151 as a baseline, we investigated various geometric and physical configurations of the BH-corona-accretion disk (AD) system, such as the coronal opening angle, temperature, optical depth, BH spin, and the inner radius of the disk. Finally, we compared our calculations with results from the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) for NGC 4151, the only radio-quiet and unobscured AGN with significant polarization detected by IXPE, to constrain the system's geometric parameters within the framework of the wedge corona model.

 - **Abstract**
 Active galactic nuclei (AGN) jets are powerful drivers of galaxy evolution, depositing energy and momentum into the circumgalactic and intracluster medium (CGM/ICM) and regulating gas cooling and star formation. We investigate the dynamics of jet evolution in the self-similar regime using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code Gadget4-Osaka, systematically varying jet launching schemes, artificial viscosity prescriptions, mass resolution, and jet lifetimes. Our analysis combines quantitative diagnostics of jet size and energetics with detailed morphological and thermodynamic characterizations from slice maps and phase diagrams. We find that jet lobe growth follows analytic self-similar scaling relations and converges with resolution, but is highly sensitive to the choice of artificial viscosity. While the overall jet size tracks self-similar predictions, the partitioning of thermal and kinetic energy departs significantly from the idealized picture, reflecting enhanced dissipation and mixing. These results establish robust benchmarks for SPH-based jet modeling, provide insight into the physical and numerical factors shaping jet--medium interactions, and lay the groundwork for future studies of AGN feedback in realistic galactic and cluster environments.

 - **Abstract**
 The overwhelming majority of CVs have orbital periods shorter than 10 hr. However, a few have much longer periods, and their formation and existence pose challenges for the CV evolution models. These extremely long-period CVs must host nuclearly evolved donor stars, as otherwise, the companion of the white dwarf would be too small to fill its Roche lobe. This makes them natural laboratories for testing binary evolution models and accretion processes with subgiant donors. To shed light on the formation and evolution of accreting compact objects with subgiant companions, we investigated two extremely long-period CVs in detail, namely V479 And and V1082 Sgr. We searched for reasonable formation pathways to explain their refined stellar and binary parameters. We used a broad set of new observations, including ultraviolet and infrared spectroscopy, results of circular polarimetry, and improved Gaia distance estimates to determine fundamental parameters to be confronted with numerical simulations. Furthermore, we utilized the MESA code to conduct numerical simulations, employing state-of-the-art prescriptions, such as the CARB model for strong magnetic braking. Both systems have unusual chemical compositions and very low masses for their assigned spectral classes. This most likely indicates that they underwent thermal timescale mass transfer. We found models for both that can reasonably reproduce their properties. We conclude that the donor stars in both V479 And and V1082 Sgr are filling their Roche lobes. Our findings suggest that orbital angular momentum loss is stronger due to magnetic braking in CVs with subgiant donors compared to those with unevolved donors. In addition, our findings suggest that extremely long-period CVs could significantly contribute to the population of double white dwarf binaries in close orbits.
#### Global Hot Gas Excess in (U)LIRGs: Replicating Galactic Nuclei Scaling Relations between Diffuse X-ray Emission and Star Formation on Galaxy-Wide Scales

 - **Abstract**
 Hot ionized interstellar medium interlinks star formation and stellar feedback processes, redistributing energy, momentum, and material throughout galaxies. We use X-ray data from $Chandra$ to extract the hot gas emission from 78 of the most luminous infrared-selected galaxies in the local Universe. In the extreme star-forming environments, the intrinsic thermal X-ray luminosity of hot gas ($L_{\rm 0.5 - 2\,keV}^{\rm gas}$) shows a significant excess over the predictions of the standard linear $L_{\rm X}$$-$SFR relation for most objects with very high star formation rates (SFRs). The contribution of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) appears to have little impact on the global hot gas luminosity. For galaxies with SFR $\gt$ 50 ${M_{\rm \odot}}\,\,{\rm yr^{-1}}$, the Bayesian analysis gives a super-linear relation of ${\rm log}(L_{\rm 0.5-2\,keV}^{\rm gas} /{\rm erg\,s^{-1}})=1.34\,{\rm log}({\rm SFR}/{M_{\rm \odot}}\,{\rm yr^{-1}})+39.82$, similar to that found in the central regions of normal spiral galaxies. These results suggest a scenario in which the merger of galaxies delivers substantial amounts of gas, triggering intense star formation in both the nuclear region and the galactic disk, and ultimately enhancing the global thermal X-ray emission. The ratio of the apparent thermal luminosity in the 0.5$-$2 keV band ($L_{\rm 0.5 - 2\,keV}^{\rm appar}$) to $L_{\rm 0.5 - 2\,keV}^{\rm gas}$ shows statistically significant negative correlations with the intrinsic column density ($N_{\rm H}$) and SFR. Moreover, in contrast to the luminosity ratio, SFR shows a moderate positive correlation with intrinsic $N_{\rm H}$. This suggests that the correlation between $L_{\rm 0.5 - 2\,keV}^{\rm appar}$/$L_{\rm 0.5 - 2\,keV}^{\rm gas}$ and SFR may be driven by the underlying $L_{\rm 0.5 - 2\,keV}^{\rm appar}$/$L_{\rm 0.5 - 2\,keV}^{\rm gas}$$-$$N_{\rm H}$ and SFR$-$$N_{\rm H}$ relations.

 - **Abstract**
 The gravitational lensing effect of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) holds significant and diverse applications in the field of astronomy. Nevertheless, the identification of millilensing events in GRBs presents substantial challenges. We re-evaluate the gravitational lensing candidacy of six previously proposed GRBs (GRB 081122A, GRB 081126A, GRB 090717A, GRB 110517B, GRB 200716C, and GRB 210812A) using a comprehensive set of temporal and spectral diagnostics. These include $\chi^2$ light-curve similarity tests, photon-count-based hardness ratio ($HR_{count}$) comparisons, $T_{90}$ duration measurements, spectral lag, Norris pulse-shape fitting, and both time-resolved and time-integrated spectral analyses. We propose an evaluation framework, any single test that reveals a statistically significant inconsistency between the two pulses is sufficient to reject the lensing hypothesis for that this http URL certain diagnostics, such as $T_{90}$ and parametric model fits, have known limitations, they are applied and interpreted in conjunction with the more robust, model-independent $\chi^2$ and $HR_{count}$ tests. For all six GRBs, at least one diagnostic shows a significant discrepancy, leading us to conclude that none are consistent with a gravitational lensing interpretation.

 - **Abstract**
 We examined F814W and F606W images of dwarf galaxies from the Hubble Space Telescope archive, which were obtained under the HST SNAP programs 17159 to 17797. Among 58 observed dwarfs located outside the Local Group, we found only a few objects that were confidently resolved into stars. We determined two new distances for the galaxies: dw1252+2215 ($5.32\pm0.20$ Mpc) and dw1234+3952 ($4.34\pm0.16$ Mpc) via the Tip of the Red Giant Branch. They turned out to be new probable dwarf satellites of the nearby luminous spiral galaxies NGC 4826 and NGC 4736, respectively. We also note that recent SNAP surveys vary in their productivity in measuring new galaxy distances by more than an order of magnitude.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the environmental dependence of galaxy mergers using high-resolution imaging data from the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Subaru Strategic Program. We focus on galaxy groups and clusters at $z < 0.2$ identified by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey as a laboratory of galaxy environment. We develop a new non-parametric classification scheme that combines the Gini-$M_{20}$ statistics with the shape asymmetry parameter, enabling robust identification of mergers with both central concentration and outer morphological disturbances. Applying this method to a sample of 33,320 galaxies at $0.075 \leq z < 0.2$ taken by the HSC, we identify 12,666 mergers, corresponding to a merger fraction of 38%. Our results are consistent with visual classifications from the GALAXY CRUISE project, validating the effectiveness of our method. We find that the merger fraction increases with redshift for all subsamples (field galaxies, galaxy pairs, and cluster members), and also shows a strong radial gradient within clusters, increasing toward the center. These trends suggest that merger activity is enhanced both at earlier cosmic times and in denser environments, particularly in galaxy groups. We also find tentative evidence that mergers may contribute to AGN triggering in cluster cores. Our study highlights the utility of combining non-parametric morphological diagnostics for large-scale merger identification and provides new insights into the role of environment in galaxy evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Accreting massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) often display periodic variations in their emitted radiation, providing a distinctive signature for their identification. In this work, we explore the MBHBs identification via optical variability studies by simulating the observations of the LSST survey. To this end, we generate a population of MBHBs using the L-Galaxies semi-analytical model, focusing on systems with observed orbital periods $\leq$ 5 years. This ensures that at least two complete cycles of emission can be observed within the 10-year mission of LSST. To construct mock optical light curves, we first calculate the MBHB average magnitudes in each LSST filter by constructing a self-consistent SED that accounts for the binary accretion history and the emission from a circumbinary disc and mini-discs. We then add variability modulations by using six 3D hydrodynamic simulations of accreting MBHBs with different eccentricities and mass ratios as templates. To make the light curves realistic, we mimic the LSST observation patterns and cadence, and we include stochastic variability and LSST photometric errors. Our results show from $10^{-2}$ to $10^{-1}$ MBHBs per square degree, with light curves that are potentially detectable by LSST. These systems are mainly low-redshift ($z\lesssim1.5$), massive ($\gtrsim10^{7}\, M_{\odot}$), equal-mass (${\sim} 0.8$), relatively eccentric (${\sim}0.6$), and with modulation periods of around $3.5$ years. Using periodogram analysis, we find that LSST variability studies have a higher success rate ($>$50%) for systems with high eccentricities ($e>$0.6). Additionally, at fixed eccentricity, detections tend to favour systems with more unequal mass ratios. The false alarm probability shows similar trends. Circular binaries systematically feature high values ($\gtrsim 10^{-1}$). Eccentric systems have low-FAP tails, down to $\sim10^{-8}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive stars play a significant role in different branches of astronomy, from shaping the processes of star and planet formation to influencing the evolution and chemical enrichment of the distant universe. Despite their high astrophysical significance, these objects are rare and difficult to detect. With Gaia's advent, we now possess extensive kinematic and photometric data for a significant portion of the Galaxy that can unveil, among others, new populations of massive star candidates. In order to produce bonafide bright (G magnitude $<$ 12) massive star candidate lists (threshold set to spectral type B2 or earlier but slight changes in this threshold also explored) in the Milky Way subject to be followed up by future massive spectroscopic surveys, we have developed a Gaia DR3 plus literature data based methodology. We trained a Balanced Random Forest (BRF) with the spectral types from the compilation by Skiff et al. (2014) as labels. Our approach yields a completeness of $\sim80\%$ and a purity ranging from $0.51 \pm 0.02$ for probabilities between 0.6 and 0.7, up to $0.85 \pm 0.05$ for the 0.9-1.0 range. To externally validate our methodology, we searched for and analyzed archival spectra of moderate to high probability (p $>$ 0.6) candidates that are not contained in our catalog of labels. Our independent spectral validation confirms the expected performance of the BRF, spectroscopically classifying 300 stars as B3 or earlier (due to observational constraints imposed in the B0-3 range), including 107 new stars. Based on the most conservative yields of our methodology, our candidate list could increase the number of bright massive stars by $\sim$50\%. As a byproduct, we developed an automatic methodology for spectral typing optimized for LAMOST spectra, based on line detection and characterization guiding a decision path.

 - **Abstract**
 Current galaxy formation models predict the existence of X-ray-emitting gaseous halos around Milky Way (MW)-type galaxies. To investigate properties of this coronal gas in MW-like galaxies, we analyze a suite of high-resolution simulations based on the {\it SMUGGLE} framework, and compare the results with X-ray observations of both the MW and external galaxies. We find that for subgrid models incorporating any form of stellar feedback, e.g., early feedback (including stellar winds and radiation) and/or supernova (SN) explosions, the total $0.5-2$\,keV luminosity is consistent {\it within uncertainties} with X-ray observations of the MW and with scaling relations derived for external disk galaxies. However, all models exhibit an X-ray surface brightness profile that declines too steeply beyond $\sim5$\,kpc, underpredicting the extended emission seen in recent eROSITA stacking results. Across all subgrid prescriptions, the simulated surface brightness and emission measure fall below MW observations by at least $1-2$ orders of magnitude, with the most severe discrepancy occurring in the no-feedback model. Our results suggest that (i) stellar feedback primarily shapes the innermost hot atmosphere (central $\sim5$\,kpc), with comparable contributions from early feedback and SNe to the resulting X-ray luminosity; (ii) additional mechanisms such as gravitational heating, AGN feedback, and/or Compton effects of GeV cosmic ray are necessary to generate the extended, volume-filling hot gaseous halo of MW-mass galaxies; (iii) the origins of hot corona in MW-like galaxies are partially distinct from those of the warm ($\sim10^5$\,K) gas, by combining our previous finding that the {\it SMUGGLE} model successfully reproduces the kinematics and spatial distribution of MW \ion{O}{6} absorbers \citep{2024ApJ...962...15Z}.

 - **Abstract**
 With periods much longer than the duration of current pulsar timing surveys, gravitational waves in the picohertz (pHz) regime are not detectable in the typical analysis framework for pulsar timing data. However, signatures of these low-frequency signals persist in the slow variation of pulsar timing parameters. In this work, we present the results of the first Bayesian search for continuous pHz gravitational waves using the drift of two sensitive pulsar timing parameters -- time derivative of pulsar binary orbital period $\dot{P}_b$ and second order time derivative of pulsar spin period $\ddot{P}$. We apply our new technique to a dataset with more than double the number of pulsars as previous searches in this frequency band, achieving an order-of-magnitude sensitivity improvement. No continuous wave signal is detected in current data; however, we show that future observations by the Square Kilometre Array will provide significantly improved sensitivity and the opportunity to observe continuous pHz signals, including the early stages of supermassive black hole mergers. We explore the detection prospects for this signal by extending existing population models into the pHz regime, finding that future observations will probe phenomenologically-interesting parameter space. Our new Bayesian technique and leading sensitivity in this frequency domain paves the way for new discoveries in both black hole astrophysics and the search for new physics in the early universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Absorption Line Quasars (ALQs) generally exhibit significant outflows that may interact with the surrounding medium, resulting in radio emission. We selected a sample of 13 powerful radio-quiet (RQ) ALQs, where the UV outflow kinetic power is measurable, and detected nine of them with the Very Large Array at 5.5 GHz and 9.0 GHz. The radio emission is mostly unresolved, indicating no emission beyond a spatial scale of ~ 1-3 kpc. In the nine detected objects, the radio spectral slope at 5.5-9.0 GHz is steep (< -0.5) in five objects and is flat or inverted (> -0.5) in four objects. We discuss how the steep-slope emission can be associated with the UV outflows, and how the flat-slope emission can be intrinsically steep but flattened by free-free absorption from the UV outflowing gas. However, we find no correlation between the radio luminosity and the estimated outflow kinetic power, which suggests that the outflows are not a major source of the observed radio emission. In addition, the radio loudness of these RQ ALQs is comparable to that of typical RQ quasars, implying that the UV outflows do not lead to excess radio emission. Follow-up radio observations can test the free-free absorption interpretation and can be used as a new probe for outflows in AGN.

 - **Abstract**
 Little Red Dots (LRDs), newly identified compact and dusty galaxies with an unexpectedly high number density observed by JWST, have an unusual "V-shaped" rest-frame UV to near-infrared spectral energy distribution (SED). A group of hyper-luminous, obscured quasars with excess blue emission, called Blue-excess Hot Dust-Obscured Galaxies (BHDs), also exhibit qualitatively similar SEDs to those of LRDs. They represent a rare population of galaxies hosting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) accreting near the Eddington limit at redshifts z \sim 1--4. In this study, we compare their multi-wavelength SEDs to investigate whether LRDs, or a subset of them, could be high-redshift analogs of BHDs. Our analysis reveals that despite their similar "V-shape" SEDs, LRDs appear to be a different population than BHDs. The "V-shape" of BHDs appear at longer wavelengths compared to LRDs due to different selection strategies, suggesting LRDs have much less dust attenuation than typical BHDs. The bluer colors in the rest-frame infrared (continuum) emission of LRDs suggest the absence of hot dust heated by AGN accretion activities. We also argue that the blue excess in LRDs is unlikely from AGN scattered light. The compact morphologies and lower X-ray detection frequencies of LRDs suggest a distinct formation pathway from BHDs -- which are thought to be powered by super-Eddington accretion onto central SMBHs following major galaxy mergers.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the nature and spectroscopic diversity of early galaxies from a sample of 40 sources at z>10 with JWST/NIRSpec prism observations, the largest of its kind thus far. We compare the properties of strong UV line emitters, as traced by intense CIV emission, with those of more "typical" sources with weak or undetected CIV. The more typical (or "CIV-weak") sources reveal significant scatter in their CIII] line strengths, UV continuum slopes, and physical sizes, spanning CIII] equivalent widths of ~1-51 Å, UV slopes of $\beta$~-1.6 to -2.6, and half-light radii of ~50-1000 pc. In contrast, CIV-strong sources generally occupy the tail of these distributions, with CIII] EWs of 16-51 Å, UV slopes $\beta$<-2.5, compact morphologies ($r_{50}$<100 pc), and elevated star formation surface densities ($\Sigma_{SFR}$>100 $M_{\odot}yr^{-1}kpc^{-2}$). Collectively these properties are consistent with concentrated starbursts that temporarily outshine the extended structure of the galaxy. Comparing average properties from composite spectra, we find the diversity of the sample is primarily driven by bursts and lulls of star formation on very short timescales (<3 Myr), where strong CIV emitters are observed at the apex of these phases and sources devoid of emission lines represent periods of relative inactivity. An apparent association between strong CIV and enhanced nitrogen abundance suggests both features may be modulated by the same duty cycle and reflect a generic mode of star formation. We show that AGN are unlikely to be a significant contributor to this duty cycle based on a comparison of UV line diagnostics to photoionisation models, although some non-thermal activity cannot be fully ruled out. Our results support a unified evolutionary picture whereby transient bursts and lulls can explain the spectral diversity and early growth of bright galaxies in the first 500 Myr.

 - **Abstract**
 Studying young, high-mass stellar objects is challenging for testing models of massive star formation due to their great distances, often kiloparsecs away. This requires extremely high-angular resolution to resolve features like accretion discs around massive protostars. Consequently, while powerful, collimated outflows are evident in massive protostars, the compact accretion discs anticipated at their centres are still proving difficult to pinpoint. This study presents ALMA continuum and molecular line observations at 1.3 mm of the massive protostar W75N(B)-VLA3. The observations achieve an angular resolution of $\sim$0.12$^{\prime\prime}$ ($\sim$156 au). Dense gas tracers reveal a circumstellar disc of $\sim$450 au in radius surrounding VLA3, with an orientation perpendicular to its associated thermal radio jet. From the millimetre continuum, a total mass of $\approx$0.43-1.74 $M_\odot$ is estimated for the disc. The disc's velocity profile is consistent with Keplerian rotation around a protostar of $\approx$16 $M_\odot$. This adds VLA3 to the small number of massive disc-protostar-jet systems documented in the literature with a centrifugally supported disc with a radius less than 500 au. Additionally, we detected H30$\alpha$ recombination line emission towards the radio jet powered by VLA3. Despite limitations in the spatial and spectral resolution, our data reveal a very broad line, indicative of high-velocity motions, as well as a tentative velocity gradient in the jet's direction, thus favouring the H30$\alpha$ emission to originate from the radio jet. Should this interpretation be confirmed with new observations, W75N(B)-VLA3 could represent the first protostellar radio jet for which a thermal radio recombination line has been detected.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent discoveries of faint active galactic nuclei (AGN) at the redshift frontier have revealed a plethora of broad \Halpha emitters with optically red continua, named Little Red Dots (LRDs), which comprise 15-30\% of the high redshift broad line AGN population. Due to their peculiar spectral properties and X-ray weakness, modeling LRDs with standard AGN templates has proven challenging. In particular, the validity of single-epoch virial mass estimates in determining the black hole (BH) masses of LRDs has been called into question, with some models claiming that masses might be overestimated by up to 2 orders of magnitude, and other models claiming that LRDs may be entirely stellar in nature. We report the direct, dynamical BH mass measurement in a strongly lensed LRD at $z = 7.04$. The combination of lensing with deep spectroscopic data reveals a rotation curve that is inconsistent with a nuclear star cluster, yet can be well explained by Keplerian rotation around a point mass of 50 million Solar masses, consistent with virial BH mass estimates from the Balmer lines. The Keplerian rotation leaves little room for any stellar component in a host galaxy, as we conservatively infer $M_{\rm BH}/M_{*}>2$. Such a ''naked'' black hole, together with its near-pristine environment, indicates that this LRD is a massive black hole seed caught in its earliest accretion phase.
