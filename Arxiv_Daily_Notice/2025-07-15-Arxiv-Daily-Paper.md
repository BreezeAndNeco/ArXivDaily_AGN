 - **Abstract**
 We present the JWST/NIRSpec G395H transmission spectrum of the young (10 - 20 Myr old) transiting planet V1298 Tau b (9.85+/-0.35 Re, Teq=670K). Combined HST and JWST observations reveal a haze free, H/He dominated atmosphere with a large scale height (~1500km), allowing detection of CO2 (35 sigma), H2O (30 sigma), CO (10 sigma), CH4 (6 sigma), SO2 (4 sigma) and OCS (3.5 sigma). Our observations probe several scale heights (~4.4 in the CO2 4.3 microns and ~3 in the 2.7 micron water band). The planet's mass, inferred from atmospheric scale height using free retrieval and grid modelling is 12+/-1 and 15+/-1.7Me respectively which is significantly lower than previous radial velocity estimates and confirm it as a 'gas-dwarf' sub-Neptune progenitor. We find an atmospheric super-solar metallicity (logZ=0.6^+0.4_-0.6 x solar) and a sub-solar C/O ratio (0.22^+0.06_-0.05). The atmospheric metallicity is low compared to matured sub-Neptunes by an order of magnitude. The CH4 abundance ([CH4]=-6.1^+0.2_-0.3) is ~7 sigma lower than equilibrium chemistry prediction. To adjust for the low methane abundance, the self-consistent grids favour a high internal temperature (~500K) and vertical mixing (Kzz ~10^7-10^8 cm2/s). These internal temperatures are inconsistent with predictions from evolutionary models, which expect ~100 - 200K at the current system age. We estimate a gas-to-core mass fraction between 0.1 - 8 %, with a core mass of 11 - 12 Me, consistent with in-situ gas dwarf formation. A deep atmospheric metallicity gradient may explain both the high internal temperature and low observable metallicity. Over time, mass loss from such an atmosphere could enhance its metallicity, potentially reconciling V1298 Tau b with mature sub-Neptunes.
#### MASTER OT J072007.30+451611.6: A Polar with Strong Optical Variability and Suppressed He II Emission

 - **Abstract**
 The transient optical source MASTER OT J072007.30+451611.6 has been recently discovered and proposed as a peculiar polar with an unusually high amplitude of the orbital brightness variation in the optical of $\sim$3 mag. To clarify its nature, we performed multiband time-series optical photometry with 1.5-m class telescopes and spectroscopy with the 10.4-m Gran Telescopio Canarias. We also analysed archival data of different optical surveys and detected the source in X-rays with the Spectrum-RG/eROSITA telescope. We confirm the orbital period of $\approx$1.5 h with the high amplitude of the brightness modulation. Compiling survey data, covering $\sim$19 yr, we find high and low brightness states of the object at time scales of years, likely explained by different accretion rates. Our data were obtained in the high brightness state. Optical spectra with hydrogen and helium emission lines, consisting of broad and narrow components, indicate the presence of an accretion stream without disk. The Doppler tomography shows that the narrow component is mainly emitted from the Lagrangian L$_1$ point, while the broad component is from the region where the accretion stream interacts with the white dwarf magnetosphere. The ratio of equivalent widths of HeII 4686 and H$\beta$ emission lines is $<$0.4, which is curiously low for polars. The X-ray spectrum of the source can be described by the thermal plasma emission model with parameters consistent with values observed for polars.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy simulations have come a long way from the early days of simple N-body calculations, which considered only gravitational interactions, to the complex, multi-physics models used today. Beginning with initial conditions representative of the Universe shortly after the Big Bang, these modern simulations integrate the relevant physical processes involved in galaxy formation, such as gravity, gas dynamics, cooling, star formation, and feedback, while accounting for cosmic expansion and structure formation. This review provides an introductory overview of cosmological galaxy simulations, outlining the essential components and methods used to model the formation and evolution of galaxies on the computer. It also discusses common steps in the post-processing analysis, essential for extracting physical insights from these numerical experiments, along with basic tests to assess simulation validity and accuracy. Looking forward, next-generation simulations aim to push resolution boundaries, incorporate additional physical processes, and improve the robustness of the numerical models, promising to lead to a deeper understanding of how galaxies emerged and evolved over cosmic time.

 - **Abstract**
 The majority of Little Red Dots (LRDs) hosting Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) exhibits broad H$\alpha$ emission, which recent studies propose originates from scattering off free electrons within an ionized and dense medium embedding the Broad Line Region (BLR), rather than directly from the BLR itself. This model suggests that the observed broad lines may be intrinsically narrower than observed, which would lead to black hole masses that are up to two orders of magnitude smaller than what inferred when assuming that the whole broad line comes from the BLR. To test this model, we present a joint analysis of multiple hydrogen recombination lines in the ''Rosetta Stone''AGN, the brightest known LRD at $z$=2.26. We show that H$\alpha$, H$\beta$ and Pa$\beta$ have different spectral profiles, which is inconsistent with the predictions of the simple electron scattering scenario. Additionally, we test a variety of exponential models and show that none of them can simultaneously reproduce all three line profiles with physically plausible parameters. The inadequacy of these models for the Rosetta Stone implies that the scenario of electron scattering by an ionized medium surrounding the BLR is not universally applicable to LRDs and AGN, and therefore provides a counterexample to the claim of a universal and systematic overestimation of black hole masses.
#### The incidence of X-ray AGN and non-AGN galaxies in the far-infrared: insights into host galaxy properties and AGN obscuration

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the far-infrared (far-IR) incidence of X-ray-selected active galactic nuclei (AGN) and non-AGN galaxies as a function of stellar mass (M$_*$), star formation rate (SFR), and specific black hole accretion rate ($\lambda_{\text{sBHAR}}$), using data from five extragalactic fields (COSMOS, XMM-LSS, Stripe82, ELAIS-S1, and CDFS-SWIRE). We construct spectral energy distributions (SEDs) from optical-to-far-IR photometry to derive host galaxy properties and assess AGN obscuration. X-ray absorption is quantified using the 4XMM-DR11s catalog. Our final sample includes 172,697 non-AGN galaxies (53% Herschel-detected) and 2,417 X-ray AGN (73% Herschel-detected), with $10 < log\,[M_*/M_\sun] < 12$ and $0 < z < 2$. X-ray AGN exhibit a relatively flat far-IR detection rate across stellar mass and specific SFR ($sSFR = SFR / M_*$), unlike non-AGN galaxies, where detection correlates strongly with SFR. Among AGN, far-IR detection declines with increasing $\lambda_{\text{sBHAR}}$, despite rising SFR. Our results suggest X-ray AGN are preferentially found in gas-rich environments, where star formation and black hole accretion coexist. Far-IR incidence remains high across all sSFR bins, supporting a scenario in which AGN feedback regulates, rather than abruptly quenches, star formation. Comparing AGN and non-AGN SFRs without separating Herschel-detected from non-detected sources introduces biases. Obscured AGN show ~10% higher far-IR detection rates than unobscured ones, yet at similar $\lambda_{\text{sBHAR}}$, unobscured AGN tend to have higher SFR. This may suggest obscured AGN inhabit dustier systems with moderate star formation contributing to the far-IR. Our findings support a regulatory AGN feedback mode operating over extended timescales in gas-rich galaxies.
#### Where are the missing Kuiper Belt binaries?

 - **Abstract**
 In this letter, we call attention to a gap in binaries in the Kuiper belt in the mass range between $\approx$10$^{19}$-10$^{20}$ kg, with a corresponding dearth in binaries between 4th and 5th absolute magnitude $H$. The low-mass end of the gap is consistent with the truncation of the cold classical population at 400 km, as suggested by the OSSOS survey, and predicted by simulations of planetesimal formation by streaming instability. The distribution of magnitudes for all KBOs is continuous, which means that many objects exist in the gap, but the binaries in this range have either been disrupted, or the companions are too close to the primary and/or too dim to be detected with the current generation of observational instruments. At the high-mass side of the gap, the objects have small satellites at small separations, and we find a trend that as mass decreases, the ratio of primary radius to secondary semimajor increases. If this trend continues into the gap, non-Keplerian effects should make mass determination more challenging.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive galaxy clusters act as prominent strong-lenses. Due to a combination of observational biases, cluster evolution and lensing efficiency, most of the known cluster lenses lie typically at $z_{l}\sim0.2-0.7$, with only a few prominent examples at higher redshifts. Here we report a first strong-lensing analysis of the massive galaxy cluster SPT-CL J0546-5345 at a redshift $z_l=1.07$. This cluster was first detected through the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, with a high estimated mass for its redshift of $M_{200,c} = (7.95 \pm 0.92) \times 10^{14}\,M_{\odot}$. Using recent JWST/NIRCam and archival HST imaging, we identify at least 10 secure and 6 candidate sets of multiply imaged background galaxies, which we use to constrain the mass distribution in the cluster. We derive effective Einstein radii of $\theta_{E}= 18.1 \pm 1.8 ''$ for a source at $z_{s}=3$, and $\theta_{E}= 27.9 \pm 2.8 ''$ for a source at $z_{s}=9$. The total projected mass within a $200$ kpc radius around the strong-lensing region is $M(<200\,\mathrm{kpc}) = (1.9 \pm 0.3) \times 10^{14}\,M_{\odot}$. While our results rely on photometric redshifts warranting spectroscopic follow-up, this central mass resembles that of the Hubble Frontier Fields clusters - although SPT-CL J0546-5345 is observed when the Universe was $\sim 3-4$ Gyr younger. Amongst the multiply-imaged sources, we identify a hyperbolic-umbilic-like configuration, and, thanks to its point-like morphology, a possible Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN). If confirmed spectroscopically, it will add to just a handful of other quasars and AGN known to be multiply lensed by galaxy clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the star formation histories (SFHs) of 983 early-type dwarf galaxies classified into five morphological subtypes, dS0, dE, dEbc, dSph, and dEbl,across six environments ranging from the field to rich clusters such as Ursa Major and Virgo. Using full spectral fitting of SDSS spectra with the starlight code, we derive detailed SFHs and chemical enrichment patterns. We find that SFHs are primarily shaped by morphology, with environment playing a secondary but non-negligible role. Red early-type dwarfs (dS0, dE, dSph) typically formed most of their stars early and quenched rapidly, whereas blue early-type dwarfs (dEbc, dEbl) exhibit extended or ongoing star formation and host extremely metal-poor stars, suggesting continued pristine gas accretion. Environmental dependence is clearest in low-mass systems: field galaxies often show prolonged SFHs and delayed enrichment, while Virgo Cluster galaxies tend to quench earlier and enrich more rapidly. Cumulative SFHs reinforce these trends, with dSph galaxies showing the earliest quenching and least environmental dependence, indicating a likely primordial origin. Metallicity evolution also varies with mass and environment, progressing most slowly in low-mass field galaxies and most rapidly in high-mass cluster galaxies. Our results highlight the combined influence of morphology, stellar mass, and environment on the evolutionary diversity of early-type dwarfs, and suggest that both internal processes (nature) and external conditions (nurture) are intricately linked in shaping their star formation and chemical enrichment histories.

 - **Abstract**
 We present ongoing radio observations of the tidal disruption event (TDE) AT2018hyz, which was first detected in the radio at 972 days after disruption, following multiple non-detections from earlier searches. The new observations presented here span approximately 1370-2160 days and 0.88-240 GHz. We find that the light curves continue to rise at all frequencies during this time period, following a power law of about F ~ t^3 (compared to F_nu ~ t^5.7 at 972-1400 days), and reaching a peak luminosity of L~ 10^40 erg/s, comparable to the luminosity of the relativistic TDE Swift 1644+57 on the same timescale. The multi-frequency data indicate that the peak frequency does not significantly evolve over the 1030-day span of our observations, while the peak flux density increases by an order of magnitude. The observed behavior is consistent with two possible scenarios: (i) a delayed spherical outflow launched about 620 days post-disruption with a velocity of ~0.3c and an energy of ~10^50 erg, and (ii) a highly off-axis (~80-90 deg) relativistic jet with a Lorentz factor of Gamma ~8 and E_K ~ 10^52 erg. Continued radio observations to capture the light curve peak, as well as VLBI observations, could distinguish between these scenarios.

 - **Abstract**
 Afterglows of GRBs are, in general, well described by the fireball model. Yet, deducing the full set of model parameters from observations without prior assumptions has been possible for only a handful of GRBs. With GROND, a 7-channel simultaneous optical and near-infrared imager at the 2.2m telescope of the Max-Planck Society at ESO/La Silla, a dedicated gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglow observing program was performed between 2007 and 2016. Here, we combine GROND observations of four particularly well-sampled GRBs with public Swift/XRT data and partly own sub-mm and radio data to determine the basic fireball afterglow parameters. We find that all four bursts exploded into a wind environment. We are able to infer the evolution of the magnetic field strength from our data, and find evidence for its origin through shock amplification of the magnetic field of the circumburst medium.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutron-rich outflows in neutron-star mergers (NSMs) or other explosive events can be subject to substantial heating through the release of rest-mass energy in the course of the rapid neutron-capture (r-) process. This r-process heating can potentially have a significant impact on the dynamics determining the velocity distribution of the ejecta, but due to the complexity of detailed nuclear networks required to describe the r-process self-consistently, hydrodynamic models of NSMs often neglect r-process heating or include it using crude parametrizations. In this work, we present a conceptually new method, RHINE, for emulating the r-process and concomitant energy release in hydrodynamic simulations via machine-learning algorithms. The method requires the evolution of only a few additional quantities characterizing the composition, of which the nuclear rates of change are obtained at each location and time step from neural networks trained by a large set of trajectories from full nuclear-network calculations. The scheme is tested by comparing spherically symmetric wind simulations and long-term simulations of NSMs using RHINE with post-processing results from nucleosynthesis calculations, where we find very good agreement. In our NSM models on average about 2.3MeV, 0.7MeV, and 2.1MeV are released per baryon in dynamical ejecta, NS-torus ejecta, and black-hole (BH) torus ejecta, respectively. The strongest velocity boost is observed for BH-torus ejecta, which also become 40% more massive with r-process heating. The nucleosynthesis yields are only mildly affected by r-process heating, but the kilonova gets significantly brighter once the BH-torus ejecta become visible. RHINE can be readily implemented in existing hydrodynamics codes using pre-trained machine-learning data and routines for source-term prediction that we provide online.

 - **Abstract**
 In the quest to understand the climates and atmospheres of exoplanets, 3D global climate models (GCMs) have become indispensable. The ability of GCMs to predict atmospheric conditions complements exoplanet observations, creating a feedback loop that enhances our understanding of exoplanetary atmospheres and their environments. This paper discusses the capabilities of the Global Exoplanet Spectra (GlobES) module of the Planetary Spectrum Generator (PSG), which incorporates 3D atmospheric and surface information into spectral simulations, offering a free, accessible tool for the scientific community to study realistic planetary atmospheres. Through detailed case studies, including simulations of TRAPPIST1 b, TRAPPIST-1 e, and Earth around Sun, this paper demonstrates the use of GlobES and its effectiveness in simulating transit, emission and reflected spectra, thus supporting the ongoing development and refinement of observational strategies using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and future mission concept studies (e.g., Habitable Worlds Observatory [HWO]) in exoplanet research.
#### Little Red Dots As Late-stage Quasi-stars

 - **Abstract**
 We argue that the "Little Red Dots" (LRDs) discovered with the James Webb Space Telescope are quasi-stars in their late stages of evolution. Quasi-stars are hypothetical objects predicted to form following the core collapse of supermassive stars, and consist of black holes accreting from massive envelopes at a super-Eddington rate. We show that models of late-stage quasi-stars, with black hole masses exceeding $\sim 10\%$ of the total, predict thermal and radiative properties that are insensitive to both black hole and envelope mass, and spectrally resemble LRDs. Specifically, we show that they are likely to exhibit reddish colors, a strong Balmer break, and possess conditions favorable to the production of Balmer lines that are broadened by electron scattering. Their huge electron column densities suppress any X-rays. Late-stage quasi-stars, with black hole masses $\gtrsim 10^6 M_\odot$, should dominate the overall quasi-star population. Their short predicted lifetimes (tens of Myr), coupled with the high observed comoving density of LRDs, suggest that most or all supermassive black holes go through a quasi-star/LRD phase during their formation and growth.

 - **Abstract**
 In recent years, the existence of a gap in the mass spectrum of compact objects formed from stellar collapse, between the heaviest neutron stars and the lightest black holes, has been a matter of significant debate. The presence or absence of a mass gap has implications for the supernova mechanism, as well as being a fundamental property of the compact object mass function. In X-ray binaries containing black holes a gap is observed, but it is not known whether this is representative of a true gap in the mass function or due to selection effects or systematic biases in mass estimation. Binary black hole mergers detected from gravitational waves in the GWTC-3 transient catalog furnish a large sample of several tens of low-mass black holes with a well-understood selection function. Here we analyze the \nevts{} GWTC-3 merger events (along with GW230529\_181500) with at least one black hole ($3 \, M_\odot < m_1$) and chirp masses below those of a $20\,M_\odot$--$20\,M_\odot$ merger ($\mathcal{M} < 17.41 M_{\odot}$) to uncover the structure of the low-mass black hole mass function. Using flexible parameterized models for the mass function, we find, similar to existing studies, a sharp peak in the mass function at $m \simeq (8-10 M_{\odot})$. We observe a steady decline in the merger rate to lower masses, but by less than an order of magnitude in total, and find that the first percentile of black hole masses in our most flexible model is $m_{1\%} =3.13^{+0.18}_{-0.04}$. In other words, this sample of low-mass black holes is not consistent with the existence of a mass gap.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational lensing by massive galaxy clusters enables faint distant galaxies to be more abundantly detected than in blank fields, thereby allowing one to construct galaxy luminosity functions (LFs) to an unprecedented depth at high redshifts. Intriguingly, photometric redshift catalogs (e.g. Shipley et al. (2018)) constructed from the Hubble Frontier Fields survey display an excess of z$\gtrsim$4 galaxies in the cluster lensing fields and are not seen in accompanying blank parallel fields. The observed excess, while maybe a gift of gravitational lensing, could also be from misidentified low-z contaminants having similar spectral energy distributions as high-z galaxies. In the latter case, the contaminants may result in nonphysical turn-ups in UV LFs and/or wash out faint end turnovers predicted by contender cosmological models to $\Lambda$CDM. Here, we employ the concept of magnification bias to perform the first statistical estimation of contamination levels in HFF lensing field photometric redshift catalogs. To our great worry, while we were able to reproduce a lower-z lensed sample, it was found $\sim56\%$ of $3.5 < z_{phot} < 5.5$ samples are likely low-z contaminants! Widely adopted Lyman Break Galaxy-like selection rules in literature may give a 'cleaner' sample magnification bias-wise but we warn readers the resulting sample would also be less complete. Individual mitigation of the contaminants is arguably the best way for the investigation of faint high-z Universe, and this may be made possible with JWST observations.
#### XRISM Spectroscopy of Accretion-Driven Wind Feedback in NGC 4151

 - **Abstract**
 The hottest, most ionized, and fastest winds driven by accretion onto massive black holes have the potential to reshape their host galaxies. Calorimeter-resolution X-ray spectroscopy is the ideal tool to understand this feedback mode, as it enables accurate estimates of physical characteristics needed to determine the wind's kinetic power. We report on a photoionization analysis of five observations of the Seyfert-1.5 galaxy NGC 4151, obtained with XRISM/Resolve in 2023 and 2024. In the Fe K band, individual spectra require as many as six wind absorption components. Slow "warm absorbers" (WAs, $v_{\mathrm{out}} \sim 100 - 1000~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$), very fast outflows (VFOs, $v_{\mathrm{out}} \sim 10^3~{\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1} - 10^4~{\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1}$), and ultra-fast outflows (UFOs, $v_{\mathrm{out}} \sim 10^4~{\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1} - 10^5~{\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1}$ or $0.033 - 0.33~c$) are detected simultaneously, and indicate a stratified, multiphase wind. Fast and variable emission components suggest that the wind is axially asymmetric. All of the wind components have mass flow rates comparable to or in excess of the mass accretion rate, though the slowest zones may be "failed" winds that do not escape. Two UFO components have kinetic luminosities that exceed the theoretical threshold of $L_{kin} \geq 0.5\% L_{Edd}$ necessary to strip the host bulge of gas and halt star formation, even after corrections for plausible filling factors. The bulk properties of the observed winds are consistent with magnetocentrifugal driving, where the density depends on radius as $n \propto r^{-1.5}$, but radiative driving and other mechanisms may also be important. Numerous complexities and variability require further analysis.

 - **Abstract**
 The Pierre Auger Observatory has led to significant advances in our understanding of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. These new insights have driven a major upgrade of the Observatory, known as AugerPrime, through which the experiment has entered its Phase II, a new period of data collection. A key part of the upgrade is adding surface scintillator detectors (SSD) on top of the existing water-Cherenkov detectors (WCD). The main goal is to leverage their different responses to the electromagnetic and muonic shower components, enhancing the reconstruction of the primary cosmic-ray mass. In this contribution, we present the methods that involve analyzing peak and charge distributions of atmospheric muons for accurate calibration during extensive air-shower event reconstruction, along with the development of a rate-based algorithm for independent calibration. We also show the performance of the SSDs with Phase-II data, including PMT reliability and stability of key parameters, such as gain and signal-to-noise ratio.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a multi-frequency analysis of the candidate double-double radio galaxy (DDRG) J2349-0003, exhibiting a possible lobe misalignment. High-resolution uGMRT observations at Bands 3 and 4 reveal a complex radio morphology featuring a pair of inner and outer lobes, and the radio core, while the Band 5 image detects the core and the compact components. The positioning of both pairs of lobes with the central core supports its classification as a DDRG. Spectral age estimates for the inner and outer lobes indicate two distinct episodes of active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity interspaced by a short quiescent phase. The possible compact steep spectrum nature of the core, together with its concave spectral curvature, suggests ongoing or recent jet activity, suggesting the possibility that J2349-0003 may be a candidate triple-double radio galaxy. With a projected linear size of 1.08 Mpc, J2349-0003 is classified as a giant radio galaxy (GRG), although its moderate radio power (~10^24 W/Hz) suggests a sparse surrounding environment. Arm-length (R_theta) and flux density ratios (R_S) indicates environmental influences on source symmetry. The observed lobe misalignment and the presence of nearby galaxies in the optical image suggest that merger-driven processes may have played a key role in shaping the source's evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultra-high-energy photons have long been sought as tracers of the most energetic processes in the Universe. Several sources can contribute to a diffuse photon flux, including interactions of cosmic rays with Galactic matter and radiation fields, as well as more exotic scenarios such as the decay of super-heavy dark matter. Regardless of their origin, the expected flux is extremely low, making direct detection impractical and thereby requiring indirect detection by extensive ground-based detector arrays. In this contribution, we present a novel method for photon-hadron discrimination in the energy range of $50$ to $300\,\text{PeV}$ based on deep learning algorithms. Our approach relies on information from both the Surface Detector (SD) and the Underground Muon Detector (UMD) of the Pierre Auger Observatory. The SD consists of an array of water-Cherenkov detectors. It is used to measure the electromagnetic and muonic components of extensive air showers at ground level. Meanwhile, the UMD is composed of buried scintillator modules. It is sensitive to air-shower muons with energies above ${\sim}1\,\text{GeV}$, enhancing the identification of muon-poor air showers as initiated by photon primaries. Our method represents air-shower events as graphs, and consequently, the network architecture is composed of graph attention layers. We assess the performance of the method on a data subset and discuss the implications of unblinding the full current dataset, as well as the prospects of the increasing data volume expected in the coming years, particularly in terms of sensitivity to various diffuse fluxes from theoretical predictions.

 - **Abstract**
 The Dainotti relation empirically connects the isotropic plateau luminosity ($L_X$) in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) X-ray afterglows to the rest-frame time at which the plateau ends ($T_a^*$), enabling both the standardization of GRBs and their use as cosmological probes. However, the precise physical mechanisms underlying this correlation remain an active area of research. Although magnetars, highly magnetized neutron stars, have been proposed as central engines powering GRB afterglows, traditional dipole spin-down radiation models fail to account for the full diversity of observed behaviors. This limitation necessitates a more comprehensive framework. We propose that multipolar magnetic field emissions from magnetars offer a plausible explanation for the Dainotti relation. Unlike simple dipole fields, higher-order multipolar configurations enable more complex energy dissipation processes. The coexistence of multiple components can plausibly explain the range of afterglow decay indices found from a sample of 238 GRBs with plateau features from the Swift-XRT database up to the end of December 2024, the majority of which deviate from the dipolar prediction of $\alpha = -2$, and more crucially, the spin-down physics yields a link between $L_X$ and $T_a^*$ in a way that preserves the Dainotti correlation with a slope of $b = - 1$, independent of the specific multipole order. Moreover, we find that the inclusion of higher order multipoles can explain the range of plateau energies found in the Dainotti relations. Thus, a unified picture emerges in which multipolar fields are able to reproduce both the slope and the normalization of the correlation.

 - **Abstract**
 Central compact objects (CCOs) are a subclass of neutron stars with a dipole magnetic field strength considerably weaker than those of radio pulsars and magnetars. One possible explanation for such weak magnetic fields in the CCOs is the hidden magnetic field scenario, in which supernova fallback submerges the magnetosphere of a proto-neutron star beneath a newly formed crust. However, the fallback mass and timescale required for this submergence process remain uncertain. We perform one-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the supernova fallback onto a magnetized proto-neutron star, while considering neutrino cooling. In our simulations, the infalling material compresses the magnetic field and drives a strong shock. The shock initially expands outward, but eventually stalls and recedes as neutrino cooling becomes significant. After the shock stalls, the gas density above the magnetosphere increases rapidly, potentially leading to the formation of a new crust. To understand the shock dynamics, we develop semi-analytic models that describe the resulting magnetospheric and shock radii when the shock stalls. By comparing the fallback time scale with the shock stalling time scale, corresponding to the waiting time for the new crust formation, we derive a necessary condition for the submergence of the PNS magnetic field. Our results will provide guidance for investigating the diversity of young isolated neutron stars through multidimensional simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 DG CVn is an eruptive variable star and represents the closest member of the known sample of complex periodic variables, or scallop-shell stars. Over the years, this M dwarf binary system has shown significant flaring activity at a wide range of frequencies. Here, we present a detailed analysis of $\sim 14$ hours of radio observations of this stellar system, taken with the Karl this http URL Very Large Array at band L, centered at 1.5 GHz. In both $7$-hour long observations, we have found a quiescent, weakly polarized component, that could be ascribable to the incoherent, gyro-synchrotron emission coming from the magnetosphere surrounding one or both stars, along with multiple $\sim90\%$ right-circularly polarized bursts, some of which last for a few minutes, while others being longer, $\gtrsim$ 30 minutes. Some of these bursts show a drift in frequency and time, possibly caused due to beaming effects or the motion of the plasma responsible for the emission. We assess the possible modulation of burst frequency with the primary and secondary periods, and discuss the properties of these bursts, favoring electron cyclotron maser over plasma emission as the likely underlying mechanism. We compare DG CVn's dynamic spectrum to other young M dwarfs and find many similarities. A dedicated proper radio/optical simultaneous follow-up is needed to monitor the long-term variability, increase the statistics of bursts, in order to test whether the co-rotating absorbers detected in optical can drive the observed radio emission, and whether the occurrence of radio bursts correlates with the rotational phase of either stars.

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce MVPinn, a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) approach tailored for solving the Milne-Eddington (ME) inversion problem, specifically applied to spectropolarimetric observations from the Big Bear Solar Observatory's Near-InfraRed Imaging Spectropolarimeter (BBSO/NIRIS) at the Fe I 1.56 {\mu}m lines. Traditional ME inversion methods, though widely used, are computationally intensive, sensitive to noise, and often struggle to accurately capture complex profile asymmetries resulting from gradients in magnetic field strength, orientation, and line-of-sight velocities. By embedding the ME radiative transfer equations directly into the neural network training as physics-informed constraints, our MVPinn method robustly and efficiently retrieves magnetic field parameters, significantly outperforming traditional inversion methods in accuracy, noise resilience, and the ability to handle asymmetric and weak polarization signals. After training, MVPinn infers one magnetogram in about 15 seconds, compared to tens of minutes required by traditional ME inversion on high-resolution spectropolarimetric data. Quantitative comparisons demonstrate excellent agreement with well-established magnetic field measurements from the SDO/HMI and Hinode/SOT-SP instruments, with correlation coefficients of approximately 90%. In particular, MVPINN aligns better with Hinode/SOT-SP data, indicating some saturation of HMI data at high magnetic strengths. We further analyze the physical significance of profile asymmetries and the limitations inherent in the ME model assumption. Our results illustrate the potential of physics-informed machine learning methods in high-spatial-temporal solar observations, preparing for more sophisticated, real-time magnetic field analysis essential for current and next-generation solar telescopes and space weather monitoring.

 - **Abstract**
 Active galactic nuclei (AGNs), among the universe's most luminous objects, radiate across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. They are powered by gravitational energy released from material feeding central supermassive black holes (SMBHs). However, current AGN theory remains largely phenomenological, relying on envisioned structures beyond accretion disks to produce broad optical emission lines (broad line regions, BLRs) and X-ray emission (corona). It struggles to explain accretion disk sizes, optical line diversity, BLR radial inflows/outflows, and crucially, rapid X-ray and optical variability (line width, line shape, inflow/outflow switch, emitting region) on timescales significantly shorter than disk accretion. Here we show that moderately eccentric flows around SMBHs-formed via circumnuclear gas accretion or tidal disruption events-generate eccentricity cascades in the BLRs (from 0.8 to 0.2 outwards), explaining multi-wavelength emission and variability. The flows' non-axisymmetric temperature structures explain dust sublimation asymmetries, different BLR components and their radial motions. The innermost BLR links to the SMBH vicinity through highly eccentric streams producing soft X-rays at periapsis. General relativistic precession further compresses these flows, generating a hard X-ray continuum near the SMBHs. Precession of the eccentric flow drives optical/X-ray variability, reproducing the observed X-ray power spectral density and occasional X-ray quasi-periodic eruptions. We thus propose eccentric accretion disks as a physical AGN model unifying the elusive BLRs and X-ray corona. This model enables detailed anatomy of AGNs and maximises their potential as cosmological standard candles.

 - **Abstract**
 The Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) is an envisioned observatory of ultra-high-energy particles of cosmic origin, with energies in excess of 100 PeV. GRAND uses large surface arrays of antennas to look for the radio emission from extensive air showers that are triggered by the interaction of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays, gamma rays, and neutrinos in the atmosphere or underground. In particular, for ultra-high-energy neutrinos, the future final phase of GRAND aims to be sensitive enough to detect them in spite of their plausibly tiny flux. Three prototype GRAND radio arrays have been in operation since 2023: GRANDProto300, in China, GRAND@Auger, in Argentina, and GRAND@Nançay, in France. Their goals are to field-test the GRAND detection units, understand the radio background to which they are exposed, and develop tools for diagnostic, data gathering, and data analysis. This list of contributions to the 39th International Cosmic Ray Conference (ICRC 2025) presents an overview of GRAND, in its present and future incarnations, and a first look at data collected by GRANDProto300 and GRAND@Auger, including the first cosmic-ray candidates detected by them.

 We reanalyze the chemical composition of the metal-poorest tail of the Galactic halo using highly accurate atmospheric parameters Giribaldi et al. (2021, 2023) and cutting-edge 3D NLTE models Amarsi et al (2018). Most [Mg/Fe] versus [Fe/H] diagrams in the literature exhibit significant scatter at [Fe/H] $\lesssim -2$ dex, often interpreted as evidence of inhomogeneous enrichment during the early phases of galaxy evolution Rossi et al. (2021). However, our analysis of observational data reveals that in the range $-3.5 <$ [Fe/H] $< -2$ dex, the [Mg/Fe] versus [Fe/H] distribution is relatively narrow. This finding suggests a low degree of stochastic enrichment in magnesium during these epochs in the Milky Way halo.

 - **Abstract**
 Nuclear rings are long-lived structures, allowing the molecular gas inside to become sufficiently dense to initiate star formation. This makes them a crucial element in the study of secular evolution. However, the morphology of nuclear rings, and their potential correlations with that of the galactic hosts, remains an open subject. We examine 52 star-forming nuclear rings from the Atlas of Images of NUclear Rings (AINUR) and correlate the overall galaxy morphology, in particular non-axisymmetric features, with the morphology of the nuclear ring. We define three different classes of nuclear rings: two-armed rings dominated by two dust lanes, twoarms+ rings crowded with secondary dust lanes in addition to the two main ones, and many-armed rings with multiple armlets of similar prevalence. We employ unsharp-masked Hubble Space Telescope images to study the structure of nuclear rings. We find that two-armed rings are more common in early-type grand design galaxies with strong bars. Twoarms+ rings are related to later-type and more weakly barred galaxies, both grand design and multi-armed. Lastly, many-armed rings are typically associated with later-type flocculent and multi-armed galaxies with the weakest bars. In addition, we examine the regions inside the nuclear rings and observe nuclear spirals in 28 galaxies ( 90 % of those galaxies for which the interior of the nuclear ring is resolved). We conclude that the global morphology of the host galaxy and, more precisely, the presence and properties of a bar play a fundamental role in determining the morphology of the nuclear ring and the nuclear region. We suggest that two-armed rings are associated with a 180deg structure forced by a strong bar, many-armed rings are associated with a very weak or absent 180deg structure, and twoarms+ rings are found in intermediate cases.

 - **Abstract**
 We determine magnetic fields from the photosphere to the upper chromosphere combining data from the Hinode satellite and the CLASP2.1 sounding rocket experiment. CLASP2.1 provided polarization profiles of the Mg~{|sc ii} $h$ and $k$ lines, as well as of the Mn~{|sc i} lines around 2800~{|AA}, across various magnetic structures in an active region, containing a plage, a pore, and the edges of a sunspot penumbra. By applying the Weak-Field Approximation (WFA) to the circular polarization profiles of these spectral lines, we obtain a longitudinal magnetic field map at three different heights in the chromosphere (lower, middle, and upper). This is complemented by data from Hinode (photospheric magnetic field), IRIS, and SDO (high-spatial-resolution observations of the chromosphere and corona). We quantify the height expansion of the plage magnetic fields and find that the magnetic fields expand significantly in the middle chromosphere, shaping the moss observed above in the transition region and corona. We identified an area with polarity reversal at the upper chromosphere around the edge of the pore, suggesting the presence of a magnetic discontinuity in the upper chromosphere. Transient and recurrent jet-like events are observed in this region, likely driven by magnetic reconnection. Around the penumbral edge, we find large-scale magnetic fields corresponding to the superpenumbral fibrils seen in the upper chromosphere. In the superpenumbral fibrils, we find Zeeman-induced linear polarization signals, suggesting the presence of a significantly inclined magnetic field, as strong as 1000~G in the upper chromosphere.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic reconnection and Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves may well be both playing a role in coronal heating. In this paper, we simulate reconnection in the corona as a response to the convergence of opposite-polarity magnetic sources at the base of the corona. A current sheet forms at a magnetic null and undergoes impulsive bursty reconnection which drives natural modes of oscillation of the current sheet by a process of symbiosis. These are leaky surface sausage modes which cause the length of the current sheet to oscillate. Interaction of the oscillations and reconnection outflows with the magnetic Y-points at the ends of the sheet acts as sources for magnetoacoustic waves. Fast-mode waves propagate outwards into the coronal environment, while slow-mode waves propagate along the separatrices extending from the ends of the current sheet. The periodicities for sausage oscillations of the current sheet, for the current sheet length, and for the propagating large-scale magnetoacoustic waves are all estimated to be approximately 91 s for the parameters of our experiment.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The evolution of massive star-forming clumps that are progenitors of high-mass young stellar objects are often classified based on a variety of observational indicators ranging from near-IR to radio wavelengths. Among them, the ratio between the bolometric luminosity and the mass of their envelope, $L/M$, has been observationally diagnosed as a good indicator for the evolutionary classification of parsec-scale star-forming clumps in the Galaxy. Aims. We have developed the Rosetta Stone project$\unicode{x2013}$an end-to-end framework designed to enable an accurate comparison between simulations and observations for investigating the formation and evolution of massive clumps. In this study, we calibrate the $L/M$ indicator in relation to the star formation efficiency (SFE) and the clump age, as derived from our suite of simulations. Methods. We perform multi-wavelength radiative transfer post-processing of RMHD simulations of the collapse of star-forming clumps fragmenting into protostars. We generate synthetic observations to obtain far-infrared emission from $70$ to $500\ \mu$m, as was done in the Hi-GAL survey and at $24\ \mu$m in the MIPSGAL survey, which are then used to build the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and estimate the $L/M$ parameter. An additional $1.3$ mm wavelength in ALMA Band 6 has also been produced for the comparison with observational data. We have applied observational techniques, commonly employed by observers, to the synthetic data, in order to derive the corresponding physical parameters. Results. We find a correlation between $L/M$ and the SFE, with a power-law form $L/M\propto {\rm SFE}^{1.20^{+0.02}_{-0.03}}$. This correlation is independent of the mass of the clumps and the choice of initial conditions of the simulations in which they formed. (Abridged)

 - **Abstract**
 Lensing studies are typically carried out around high density regions, such as groups and clusters, where the lensing signals are significant and indicative of rich density structures. However, a more comprehensive test of the cosmological model should also include the lensing effect in low density regions. In this work, we incorporate the stacked weak lensing signals around the low density positions, alongside galaxy-galaxy lensing and galaxy-galaxy two point correlation function to perform a joint cosmological analysis on $\sigma_8$. The low density positions are constructed from the DR9 data release of the DESI legacy imaging survey, using galaxies with r-band absolute magnitude cut M$<$-21.5 and in the redshift range of 0.18$<$z$<$0.28. In doing so, we simultaneously parameterize photometric redshift errors and halo mass uncertainties while building mock catalogs from simulations using the method of SubHalo Abundance Matching (SHAM). For the weak lensing measurements, we use the shear estimators derived from the DECaLS DR8 imaging data, processed by the Fourier\_Quad pipeline. The survey boundaries and masks are fully taken into account. Our analysis achieves a total significance of $31.1\sigma$ detection for lensing in the low density positions, which significantly improve the $\sigma_8$ constraint compared to galaxy-galaxy lensing and galaxy-galaxy two point correlation function by 14$\%$. For flat $\Lambda$CDM model, we constrain $\sigma_8$ =$0.824^{+0.015}_{-0.015}$, which shows a good agreement with the PLANCK result. Additionally, the halo mass uncertainty $\sigma_{\lg M}$ and photometric redshift error $\sigma_z$ are constrained to be $0.565^{+0.086}_{-0.070}$ and $0.004^{+0.004}_{-0.003}$ respectively, which are somewhat different from our expectations due to the significant degeneracy of the two parameters.

 Massive protoclusters at z~1.5-4, the peak of the cosmic star formation history, are key to understanding the formation mechanisms of massive galaxies in today's clusters. However, studies of protoclusters at these high redshifts remain limited, primarily due to small sample sizes and heterogeneous selection criteria. In this work, we conduct a systematic investigation of the star formation and cold gas properties of member galaxies of eight massive protoclusters in the COSMOS field, using the statistical and homogeneously selected sample from the Noema formIng Cluster survEy (NICE). Our analysis reveals a steep increase in the star formation rates per halo mass ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR} /M_{\rm halo}$) with redshifts in these intensively star-forming protoclusters, reaching values one to two orders of magnitude higher than those observed in the field at z>2. We further show that, instead of an enhancement of starbursts, this increase is largely driven by the concentration of massive and gas-rich star-forming galaxies in the protocluster cores. The member galaxies still generally follow the same star formation main sequence as in the field, with a moderate enhancement at the low mass end. Notably, the most massive protocluster galaxies ($M_{\rm halo}$>8$\times$10$^{10}$M$_\odot$) exhibit higher $f_{\rm gas}$ and $\tau_{\rm gas}$ than their field counterparts, while remaining on the star forming main sequence. These gas-rich, massive, and star-forming galaxies are predominantly concentrated in the protocluster cores and are likely progenitors of massive ellipticals in the center of today's clusters. These results suggest that the formation of massive galaxies in such environments is sustained by substantial gas reservoirs, which support persistent star formation and drive early mass assembly in forming cluster cores.

 - **Abstract**
 We present 3D hydrodynamical modelling of supernova-induced binary-interaction-powered supernovae; a scenario proposed for the peculiar type Ic supernova SN2022jli. In this scenario, supernova ejecta of a stripped-envelope star impacts a close-by stellar companion, temporarily inflating the envelope. The expanded envelope engulfs the neutron star, causing strong mass accretion at super-Eddington rates. Feedback from the accretion powers the supernova light curve with periodic undulations. Our simulations capture key features of SN2022jli, both the overall decline and the superimposed undulations of the light curve. Based on our parameter study, we find that (i) the accretion feedback should be sufficiently geometrically confined and the eccentricity of the post-supernova binary orbit should be $0.7\lesssim e\lesssim0.9$ to sustain a high accretion rate, and (ii) the viewing angle should be close to edge-on to match the low undulation amplitude ($\Delta L/L\sim0.1$) of SN2022jli. Different combinations of parameters could account for other supernovae like SN2022mop, SN2009ip and SN2015ap. We also discuss possible explanations for other key features of SN2022jli such as the $\gamma$-ray detection at $\sim200~\mathrm{d}$ and the rapid optical drop at $\sim250~\mathrm{d}$. Finally, we speculate on the future evolution of the system and its relation to existing neutron star binaries.

 - **Abstract**
 Parametric instability of Alfvén wave packets with monochromatic carrier wave in low-$\beta$ plasma is studied using one-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations. The results show spatial growth of incoming perturbations as they propagate through the mother wave. For sufficiently short packets, the perturbations emerge downstream of the packet as small-amplitude reverse Alfvén waves and forward slow magnetosonic waves. For larger packets the perturbations reach non-linear amplitude while still inside the mother wave. In this case, a downstream section of the mother wave collapses but the remaining upstream section stays largely intact and enters the phase of very slow evolution. The length scale separating the linear and non-linear regimes, as well as determining the size of the surviving section in the non-linear regime, is set by the Alfvén crossing time of the packet, the growth rate of the parametric instability for the unmodulated carrier wave, and the amplitude of incoming perturbations. The results are discussed in connection with the physics of solar wind.

 - **Abstract**
 Active galactic nucleus (AGN) disk provide dense environments to influence on the star formation, evolution, and migration. In AGN disks, pressure gradients and migration accelerations could create the anisotropy of the core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) when the massive stars explode at the end of their lives. In this study, we construct the equilibrium equations by considering the above two factors and then compute the light curves for three types of progenitor stars at different locations of AGN disks for the different supermassive black hole (SMBH) masses, accretion efficiencies, explosion energies, and masses of ejecta. The results show that the migration acceleration has more significant effects on the anisotropic explosions than the pressure gradients of the AGN disks. The anisotropic luminosities are pronounced at large radii, and massive SMBHs would suppress the anisotropy and reduce the total luminosity.

 - **Abstract**
 A simple, fully connected neural network with a single hidden layer is used to estimate stellar masses for star-forming galaxies. The model is trained on broad-band photometry - from far-ultraviolet to mid-infrared wavelengths - generated by the Semi-Analytic Model of galaxy formation (SHARK), along with derived colour indices. It accurately reproduces the known SHARK stellar masses with respective root-mean-square and median errors of only 0.085 and 0.1 dex over the three decades in stellar mass. Analysis of the trained network's parameters reveals several colour indices to be particularly effective predictors of stellar mass. In particular, the FUV - NUV colour emerges as a strong determinant, suggesting that the network has implicitly learned to account for attenuation effects in the ultraviolet bands, thereby increasing the diagnostic power of this index. Traditional methods such as spectral energy distribution fitting, though widely used, are often complex, computationally expensive, and sensitive to model assumptions and parameter degeneracies. In contrast, the neural network relies solely on easily obtained observables, enabling rapid and accurate stellar mass predictions at minimal computational cost. The model derives its predictions exclusively from patterns learned in the data, without any built-in physical assumptions (such as stellar initial mass function). These results demonstrate the utility of this study's machine learning approach in astrophysical parameter estimation and highlight its potential to complement conventional techniques in upcoming large galaxy surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 The role of magnetic fields in the formation of dense filamentary structures in molecular clouds is critical for understanding the star formation process. The Snake filament in or close to the Pipe Nebula s neighboring, a prominent example of such structures, offers an ideal environment to study the interplay between magnetic fields and gas dynamics in the early stages of star formation. This study aims to investigate how magnetic fields influence the structure and dynamics of the Snake filament, using both polarization data and molecular line observations. Our goal is to understand the role of magnetic fields in shaping the filamentary structure and explore the kinematics within the filament. We conducted polarization observations in the optical and near-infrared bands using the 1.6 m and 60 cm telescopes at the Observatorio do Pico dos Dias/Laboratorio Nacional de Astrof\isica (OPD/LNA). Molecular line observations of the C18O and 13CO lines were obtained using the IRAM 30m telescope. We analyzed the data to characterize polarization and gas properties within the filament, with a focus on understanding the magnetic field orientation and its relationship with the filament s structure. Our findings reveal that the polarization vectors align with the filament s spine, indicating a magnetic field structure that is predominantly parallel to the filament at lower-density regions. A velocity gradient along the filament is observed in both C18O and 13CO lines, with C18O tracing the denser regions of the gas. The polarization efficiency decreases with increasing visual extinction, consistent with reduced grain alignment in higher-density regions. The filament s mass-to-length ratio is below the critical value required for gravitational collapse, indicating stability.

 - **Abstract**
 The Rosetta spacecraft escorted comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko for two years, gathering a rich and variable dataset. Amongst the data from the Rosetta Plasma Consortium (RPC) suite of instruments are measurements of the total electron density from the Mutual Impedance Probe (MIP) and Langmuir Probe (LAP). At low outgassing, the plasma density measurements can be explained by a simple balance between the production through ionisation and loss through transport. Ions are assumed to travel radially at the outflow speed of the neutral gas. Near perihelion, the assumptions of this field-free chemistry-free model are no longer valid, and plasma density is overestimated. This can be explained by enhanced ion transport by an ambipolar electric field inside the diamagnetic cavity, where the interplanetary magnetic field does not reach. In this study, we explore the transition between these two regimes, at intermediate outgassing ($5.4 \times10^{26}~\mathrm{s^{-1}}$), when the interaction between the cometary and solar wind plasma influences the transport of the ions. We use a 3D collisional test-particle model, adapted from Stephenson et al. 2022 to model the cometary ions with input electric and magnetic fields from a hybrid simulation for 2.5-3 au. The total plasma density from this model is then compared to data from MIP/LAP and to the field-free chemistry-free model. In doing so, we highlight the limitations of the hybrid approach and demonstrate the importance of modelling collisional cooling of the electrons to understand the ion dynamics close to the nucleus.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on a quasi-periodic variation at $\sim1$ Hz during a fast X-ray outburst of a high-mass X-ray binary MAXI J0709$-$159 / LY CMa observed by the Neutron-star interior composition explorer (NICER). The new X-ray transient MAXI J0709$-$159 was discovered on 2022 January 25. Due to the transient X-ray behavior characterized by the short (a few hours) outburst duration, rapid ($\lesssim$ 1 s) variability with spectral change, and large luminosity swing from $10^{32}$ erg s$^{-1}$ to $10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$, the object was considered likely to be a supergiant X-ray binary with a neutron star (NS) categorized as a Supergiant Fast X-ray Transient (SFXT). Follow-up NICER and NuSTAR observations confirmed that the position of the new X-ray object is consistent with a Be star, LY CMa, which has been also identified as a B supergiant. We analyzed the NICER data obtained from 3 hours to 6 days after the discovery. The light curve reveals that the X-ray activity continued for $\sim7$ hours in sparse short flares, each lasting $\lesssim 100$ seconds, and the luminosity instantaneously reached up to $\sim 1\times 10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The light-curve and spectral features reasonably agree with those expected from accretion of a clumpy stellar-wind onto a magnetized NS. The variability power spectrum during the brightest flare shows a broad peak at $1.1$ Hz resembling a quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO). If the QPO is attributed to the Keplerian orbital frequency at the inner edge of a transient accretion disk truncated by the NS magnetosphere, the NS surface magnetic field is estimated to be $\sim 10^{12}$ G.

 - **Abstract**
 The ionospheric Pedersen and Hall conductances play an important role in understanding the exchanges of angular momentum, energy and matter between the magnetosphere and the ionosphere/thermosphere at Jupiter, modifying the composition and temperature of the planet. In the high latitude regions, these conductances are enhanced by the auroral electron precipitation. The effect of a broadband precipitating electron energy distribution, similar to the observed electron distributions through particle measurements, on the conductance values is investigated. The new values are compared to the ones obtained from previous studies, notably when considering a mono-energetic distribution. The broadband precipitating electron energy distribution is modeled by a kappa distribution, which is used as an input in an electron transport model that computes the density vertical profiles of ionospheric ions. The vertical profiles of the Pedersen and Hall conductivities are then evaluated assuming that the conductivities are mostly governed by the densities of H3+ and CH5+. Finally, the Pedersen and Hall conductances are computed by integrating the corresponding conductivities over altitude. The Pedersen and Hall conductances are globally higher when considering a broadband electron energy distribution rather than a mono-energetic distribution. In addition, the use of the direct outputs of an electron transport model rather than the analytical expression presented in Hiraki and Tao (2008) as well as a change in the electron collision cross-sections also have significant impacts on the conductance values. Comparison between our results and the ones deduced from the corotation enforcement theory suggests that either a physical mechanism limits the field-aligned currents or the auroral electrons precipitating in the atmosphere are also accelerated by processes not associated with the field-aligned currents.

 - **Abstract**
 Millisecond pulsars are known to show complex radio pulse profiles and polarisation position angle evolution with rotational phase. Small scale surface magnetic fields and multipolar components are believed to be responsible for this complexity due to the radiation mechanisms occurring close to the stellar surface but within the relatively small light-cylinder compared to the stellar radius. In this work, we use the latest NICER phase aligned thermal X-ray pulse profile of PSR~J0740+6620 combined with radio and $\gamma$-ray pulse profiles and radio polarisation to deduce the best magnetic field configuration that can simultaneously reproduce the light-curves in these respective bands. We assume a polar cap model for the radio emission and use the rotating vector model for the associated polarisation, a striped wind model for the $\gamma$-ray light-curves and rely on the NICER collaboration results for the hot spot geometry. We demonstrate that an almost centred dipole can account for the hot spot location with a magnetic obliquity of $\alpha \approx 51 °$ and a line of sight inclination angle of $\zeta \approx 82 °$. However, with this geometry, the hot spot areas are three times too large. We found a better solution consisting of two dipoles located just below the surface in approximately antipodal positions. Our double dipole model is able to reproduce all the salient radio and $\gamma$-ray characteristics of PSR~J0740+6620 including radio polarisation data. A double dipole solution is more flexible than an off-centred dipole because of two independent magnetic axes and could hint at a magnetic field mostly concentrated within the crust and not in the core.

 - **Abstract**
 Simulate the entire GRB dynamics since its production until the jet's break-out from the star envelope is computationally expensive. In this work, we aim to investigate jet production at the black hole horizon and its subsequent evolution beyond the envelope boundary. We perform 2.5-dimensional GRMHD simulations using, as initial conditions, remapped massive star progenitors previously evolved with a state-of-the-art stellar evolutionary codes. Specifically, we adopt the Wolf-Rayet star models 12TH and 16TI from the Woosley \& Heger framework, and we evolve our own Long GRB progenitor with the MESA code. A dipolar magnetic field is imposed, with variations in field strength to explore its influence. We find that the jets are magnetically dominated, with their thermal and kinetic components remaining comparable during propagation through the stellar envelope. The cocoon is thermally dominated in most cases. Jet launching is successful when the magnetic field has a dipolar configuration and spin $a=0.9$, in contrast, a hybrid magnetic field does not result in jet formation. We observe disk formation in cases without a magnetized jet, however, the formation of a well-defined funnel is not evident and the expansion of such wind does not break the star for longer times. Our simulations show that a collapsar launches a successful, relativistic jet only when a strong, large-scale dipolar field, driving a magnetically arrested disk. Such jets collimate, accelerate, and break out of progenitor stars in $1.5\lesssim t\lesssim3.5$ s, while weaker or non-magnetised flows stall inside the star. The resulting jets have luminosities of $L_{j}\sim10^{49}$--$10^{53}\,$erg\,s$^{-1}$ and the final energy structure reveals that magnetisation distribution and progenitor stratification as the key determinants of jet structure and success.

 - **Abstract**
 In the build-up of galactic discs gas infall is an important ingredient and it produces radial gas inflows as a physical consequence of angular momentum conservation, since the infalling gas on to the disc at a specific radius has lower angular momentum than the circular motions of the gas at the point of impact. NGC300 is a well studied isolated, bulge-less, and low-mass disc galaxy ideally suited for an investigation of galaxy evolution with radial gas inflows. To investigate the effects of radial gas inflows on the physical properties of NGC300, a chemical evolution model for NGC300 is constructed by assuming its disc builds up progressively by infalling of metall-free gas and outflowing of metal-enriched gas. Radial gas inflows are also considered in the model. Our model including the radial gas inflows and an inside-out disc formation scenario can simultaneously reproduce the present-day observed radial profiles of HI gas mass surface density, SFR surface density, sSFR, gas-phase and stellar metallicity. We find that, although the value of radial gas inflow velocity is as low as -0.1 km/s, the radial gas inflows steepen the present-day radial profiles of HI gas mass surface density, SFR surface density, and metallicity, but flatten the radial sSFR profile. Incorporating radial gas inflows significantly improves the agreement between our model predicted present-day sSFR profile and the observations of NGC300. It predicts a significant flattening of the metallicity gradient with cosmic time. We also find that the model predicted star formation has been more active recently, indicating that the radial gas inflows may be help to sustain star formation in local spirals, at least in NGC300.

 - **Abstract**
 The Chinese Plate-Digitizing Project has digitized a total number of about 30,000 astronomical plates from 11 telescopes of five observatories (SHAO, NAOC, PMO, YNAO, and QDO) in China, spanning nearly 100 years of observations. In this work, we present a photometric calibration method to calibrate about 15,000 single-exposure plates to the JKC photometric system. Using standard stars constructed from the BEST database, we have identified and corrected various systematic effects (including the magnitude term, color term, and flat-field term) to a high precision. The final photometric precision is typically 0.15, 0.23, 0.17, 0.11, 0.19 mag for plates collected in SHAO, NAOC, PMO, YNAO, and QDO, respectively, with best cases reaching 0.07, 0.08, 0.06, 0.05, and 0.11 mag, respectively. Candidates of variable sources are also identified. The catalogs are publicly available at the China National Astronomical Data Center. Such a dataset will provide a valuable resource for conducting long-term, temporal-scale astronomical research. Our calibration method can also be applied to other digitized astronomical plates in general.

 - **Abstract**
 Meteoroid entry into planetary atmospheres generates bow shocks, resulting in high-temperature gas conditions that drive chemical reactions. In this paper, we perform three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of meteoroid entry using the Athena++ code, coupled with chemistry calculations via Cantera to model the non-equilibrium chemistry triggered by atmospheric entry. Our aerodynamical simulations reveal the formation of complex shock structures, including secondary shock waves, which influence the thermodynamic evolution of the gas medium. By tracking thermodynamic parameters along streamlines, we analyze the effects of shock heating and subsequent expansion cooling on chemical reaction pathways. Our results demonstrate that chemical quenching occurs when the cooling timescale surpasses reaction rates, leading to the formation of distinct chemical products that deviate from equilibrium predictions. We show that the efficiency of molecular synthesis depends on the object\textquotesingle s size and velocity, influencing the composition of the post-entry gas mixture. Applying our model to Titan, we demonstrate that organic matter can be synthesized in the present environment of Titan. Also, we find that nitrogen, the dominant atmospheric component, remains stable, while water vapor is efficiently removed, a result inconsistent with equilibrium chemistry assumptions. Moreover, we compare our simulation results with laser experiments and find good agreement in chemical yields. Finally, we also evaluate the impact on Titan\textquotesingle s atmosphere as a whole, showing that meteoroid entry events could have played a significant role in supplying molecules such as HCN during early Titan\textquotesingle s history.

 - **Abstract**
 As the two Voyager spacecraft traveled beyond the heliosphere, they encountered a magnetic field environment that had never been observed before. Studies have attempted to characterize this new regime by examining the magnetic field intermittency. This is typically done by fitting the optimal kappa distribution function and interpreting its so-called q-statistics to characterize the magnetic field increments. Using this approach, recent findings concluded that beyond a certain distance, the magnetic field increments in the very local interstellar medium (VLISM) follow Gaussian statistics, unlike those both inside the heliosphere and in the region just beyond the widely accepted heliopause location, raising questions about the heliopause identification. This study explores this issue in detail by (1) optimizing the derivation of the distribution function, (2) examining whether and how the results depend on increment windows and time periods, and (3) determining the statistical behavior of the examined time series. Using magnetic field measurements from Voyager 1, we present two independent techniques and introduce a statistical framework to systematically analyze the distributions of magnetic field increments. Contrary to previous findings, we find that magnetic field increments in the VLISM do not follow a Gaussian distribution (k to infinity) and instead are in the non-Gaussian range of kappa values (3-7, when analyzed on a 30-day statistical period). We further demonstrate how erroneous, statistically induced results can arise that mimic Gaussian-like results when mixing different structures in such analyses. Our results show that Voyager 1 still travels in the intermittent magnetic field environment of the VLISM.

 - **Abstract**
 Isotopic ratios have been used as chemical diagnostics to investigate the origin of the material in the Solar System. We have determined the HCN, HNC, and N2H+ isotopic ratios and the chemical age in a large sample of 23 starless cores located in different environments. This work uses IRAM 30m data to constrain the D/H ratio of HCN, HNC, and N2H+ as well as the 14N/15N ratio of HCN and HNC. The observed abundances have been modeled using the chemical code DNAUTILUS 2.0. Deuterated compounds are detected in all of our sample cores, with average DNC/HNC, DCN/HCN, and N2D+/N2H+ values of 0.054$\pm$0.019, 0.036$\pm$0.033, and 0.15$\pm$0.11, respectively. The deuterium fractions (Dfrac) show a weak correlation with temperature and a large scatter that reflects that other factors such as core evolution could also play a significant role. Our chemical model is able to reproduce all the observed values with 0.2-0.3 Myr in Taurus and 0.3-0.5 Myr in Perseus and Orion. The 14N/15N isotopic ratio is found to be different between HCN/HC15N (430$\pm$120) and HNC/H15NC (296$\pm$64). We find no correlation between these ratios and the deuterium fractions, but we report a weak correlation with temperature. The Dfrac of HCN, HNC, and N2H+ can be used as evolutionary tracers of starless cores as long as the physical parameters are well constrained. The HCN/HC15N and HNC/H15NC ratios are not correlated with Dfrac, suggesting that the detected variations are not correlated with the core evolutionary stage. The average value of the HCN/HC15N ratio in our sample is significantly higher than the values measured in protostars and protoplanetary disks, possibly indicating that nitrogen fractionation processes are taking place during the protostellar phase.

 - **Abstract**
 We present new Chandra X-ray imaging spectroscopy of the compact galaxy group IC 2431, and compare with archival ultraviolet, optical, infrared, and radio images. IC 2431 is a starburst system containing three tidally-distorted disk galaxies. All three galaxies may have active nuclei. One galaxy is classified as an AGN based on its optical spectrum, a second is identified as a possible X-ray AGN based on the Chandra data, and the third galaxy may host a radio AGN. In optical images, a prominent dust lane crosses the southern galaxy, while Spitzer infrared images show a dusty bridge connecting the two brightest galaxies. Chandra maps reveal a massive (2 x 10^7 M(sun)) concentration of hot gas between these two galaxies, as well as several other knots of hot gas and non-thermal emission. The unabsorbed X-ray luminosity of the hot gas in IC 2431 is ~ 1 x 10^42 erg/s, which is enhanced by about a factor of four relative to the star formation rate, compared to other star-forming galaxies. In radio maps, a bright jet/ridge of radio continuum emission extends 4 kpc from one nucleus. We compare the properties of IC 2431 with those of other interacting galaxy systems, and discuss two different scenarios that may account for the peculiarities of IC 2431: ram pressure stripping of the interstellar medium during a head-on collision between two galaxies, or an AGN-powered radio jet that has been distorted by an interaction with interstellar gas during a tidal encounter between galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 Ground-based full-sky studies of the angular distribution of arrival directions of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays require combining data from different observatories, such as the Pierre Auger Observatory (Auger) and the Telescope Array (TA), because no single array can cover all declinations. A working group comprising members from the Auger and TA collaborations has been tasked with performing such studies for more than a decade and has found several indications of full-sky anisotropies. Here, we update the results for the large- and medium-scale anisotropy analyses using the latest data from TA, which include corrections for daily and yearly atmospheric effects in data for large-scale anisotropies and looser selection criteria in data for medium-scale anisotropies. We extend the latter one by considering two more galaxy catalogues, consisting of jetted or all AGNs. Finally we also introduce a new angular harmonic space analysis that allows us to measure both the auto-correlation and cross-correlation with all catalogues for all multipoles independently ($\ell_\text{max} = 20$ in this work) and scanning the energy threshold.

 - **Abstract**
 Slow magnetoacoustic waves with a 3 minute period are upward-propagating waves traveling through the density-stratified umbral atmosphere. The decreasing density causes their amplitude to increase, developing into nonlinear waves through steepening and eventually forming shocks. To investigate the vertical evolution of this wave nonlinearity, we utilized multi-wavelength data from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), covering from the photosphere to the lower corona across 20 active regions. The steepening of the wave profile leads to the generation of higher harmonics. We quantify this using a nonlinearity index (NI), defined as the ratio of the amplitude of 2nd harmonic to the fundamental obtained using wavelet analysis. We find a characteristic pattern: nonlinearity increases from the photosphere through the lower chromosphere, peaking near the AIA 1700 Å formation height, and decreases at higher altitudes, notably in the AIA 304 Å channel. This trend indicates progressive wave steepening and subsequent energy dissipation before reaching the formation of AIA 304 Å, consistent with shock formation in the lower atmosphere. An additional rise in NI is observed at the AIA 131 Å channel, followed by a decline in AIA 171 Å, suggesting a 2nd phase of wave nonlinearity evolution in the lower corona. Based on the NI profile and the formation heights of these channels, we conjecture that nonlinear wave processes are most prominent between the AIA 1700 Å and AIA 304 Å formation layers and again between AIA 131 Å and AIA 171 Å.

 - **Abstract**
 The existence of galaxies with no elements such as Oxygen - formed by stars after Big Bang nucleosynthesis - is a key prediction of the cosmological model. Finding them would provide direct and transformative evidence of the formation of the first galaxies in extremely different conditions than those observed today. JWST has enabled the identification of galaxies all the way to cosmic times of a few hundred million years. However, no pristine "zero-metallicity" Population III galaxies have been identified so far. Here, we report the identification of an extremely metal-poor galaxy at redshift z = 5.725 ("AMORE6"), about one billion years after the Big Bang, observed near the critical line of a foreground galaxy cluster, and thus multiply imaged and magnified (mu = 39-78). Publicly available JWST NIRCam Wide Field Slitless Spectroscopy (WFSS) spectra consistently detect H$\beta$ at both image positions, but [O III]4960,5008 remains undetected. This places a firm upper limit on its oxygen abundance of 12+log(O/H) < 6.0 (1 sigma), or < 0.20% of solar metallicity. AMORE6 is characterized by low stellar mass (5.6+0.2-0.1 x 10^5 Msun), very blue rest-frame UV spectral slope, and extremely compact morphology (effective radius re = 4.0+1.4-1.4 pc). These properties are consistent with massive star formation in a pristine or near-pristine environment. The finding of such an example at a relatively late time in cosmic history is surprising. However, regardless of cosmic epoch, the identification of a potentially pristine object is a key validation of the Big Bang model.

 - **Abstract**
 2024 PT$_5$ is a tiny ($D\leq10$ m) near-Earth asteroid (NEA) discovered in August 2024. 2024 PT$_5$ was gravitationally bound to the Earth-Moon system from September to November 2024 and classified as a minimoon. Several quick response observations suggest the lunar ejecta origin of 2024 PT$_5$, while rotation state and albedo, essential properties to investigate its origin, are not well constrained. We performed visible to near-infrared multicolor photometry of 2024 PT$_5$ from data taken using the TriColor CMOS Camera and Spectrograph (TriCCS) on the Seimei 3.8 m telescope during 2025 January 4-10. The Seimei/TriCCS observations of 2024 PT$_5$ cover phase angles from 14 deg to 27 deg, and were obtained in the $g$, $r$, $i$, and $z$ bands in the Pan-STARRS system. In addition, we analyzed $Y$, $J$, $H$, and $K$ photometry taken with the Multi-Object Spectrograph for Infrared Exploration (MOSFIRE) on the Keck I 10-m telescope taken on 2025 January 16-17. Our lightcurves show brightness variations over time periods of several tens of minutes. We infer that 2024 PT$_5$ is in a tumbling state and has a lightcurve amplitude of about 0.3 mag. Visible and near-infrared color indices of 2024 PT$_5$, $g-r=0.567\pm0.044$, $r-i=0.155\pm0.009$, $r-z=0.147\pm0.066$, $Y-J=0.557\pm0.046$, $J-H=0.672\pm0.078$, and $H-Ks=0.148\pm0.098$, indicate that 2024 PT$_5$ is an S-complex asteroid, largely consistent with previous observations. Using the $H$-$G$ model, we derived an absolute magnitude $H_{V,HG}$ of $27.72\pm0.09$ and a slope parameter $G_V$ of $0.223\pm0.073$ in V-band. A geometric albedo of 2024 PT$_5$ is derived to be $0.26\pm0.07$ from the slope of its photometric phase curve. This albedo value is typical of the S- and Q-type NEAs. The color properties of 2024 PT$_5$ derived from our observations match rock samples taken from the lunar surface, which agrees with previous studies.
#### Improved upper limits on the 21-cm signal power spectrum at $z=17.0$ and $z=20.3$ from an optimal field observed with NenuFAR

 - **Abstract**
 We report the deepest upper limits to date on the power spectrum of the 21-cm signal during the Cosmic Dawn (redshifts: $z>15$), using four nights of observations with the NenuFAR radio interferometer. The limits are derived from two redshift bins, centred at $z=20.3$ and $z=17.0$, with integration times of 26.1 h and 23.6 h, from observations of an optimal target field chosen to minimise sidelobe leakage from bright sources. Our analysis incorporates improvements to the data processing pipeline, particularly in subtracting strong radio sources in the primary beam sidelobes and mitigating low-level radio frequency interference, yielding a 50-fold reduction in the excess variance compared to a previous analysis of the north celestial pole field. At $z=20.3$, we achieve a best $2\sigma$ upper limit of $\Delta^{2}_{21}<4.6 \times 10^5 \, \textrm{mK}^{2}$ at $k=0.038$ $h\, \mathrm{cMpc}^{-1}$, while at $z=17.0$, the best limit is $\Delta^{2}_{21}<5.0 \times 10^6 \, \textrm{mK}^{2}$ at $k=0.041$ $h\, \mathrm{cMpc}^{-1}$. These are the strongest constraints on the 21-cm power spectrum at the respective redshifts, with the limit at $z = 20.3$ being deeper by more than an order of magnitude over all previous Cosmic Dawn power spectrum limits. Comparison against simulated exotic 21-cm signals shows that while the $z=20.3$ limits begin to exclude the most extreme models predicting signals stronger than the EDGES detection, an order-of-magnitude improvement would constrain signals compatible with EDGES. A coherence analysis reveals that the excess variance is largely incoherent across nights for the $z=20.3$ redshift bin, suggesting that deeper integrations could yield significantly stronger constraints on the 21-cm signal from the Cosmic Dawn.

 - **Abstract**
 Through studying rotation curves, which depict how the velocity of the stars and gas changes with distance from the center of the galaxy, it has been confirmed that dark matter dominates galaxy's outer regions, as their rotation curve remains flat. However, recent studies of star-forming galaxies at cosmic noon have shown a decline in their rotation curve beyond a certain point, suggesting a decrease of the abundance of dark matter in galactic halos during earlier times. In this work, we investigate the influence of cosmological surface brightness dimming and loss of resolution on observations of rotation curves at cosmic noon. We used a sample of 19 Lyman Break Analogs at $z \approx 0.2$ and artificially redshifted them as if they were at $z \approx 2.2$. By comparing both rotation curves of the observed and mocked objects, we find that the asymmetry of the cosmic noon galaxies is smaller than that of the low-$z$ galaxies. In low-$z$ galaxies, asymmetry increases with radius and becomes relevant at the external parts, where mergers and interactions cause more disturbance in the galaxy's gravitational field. In contrast, cosmic-noon galaxies appear smoother, smaller, and suitable for dynamical modeling -- when in reality, they are not. The combined effects of the cosmological bias and loss of resolution lead us to the conclusion that caution should be exercised when using cosmic-noon rotation curves, as they might not accurately trace the gravitational potential of the galaxy.
#### Investigating Galactic Fountains in M101: Insights from Ionized, UV emissions and Neutral Gas

 - **Abstract**
 Spiral galaxy disks are thought to exist in a quasi-stationary state, between fresh gas accretion from cosmic filaments and disk star formation, self-regulated through supernovae feedback. Our goal here is to quantify these processes and probe their efficiency. While star formation can be traced at 10 Myr time-scales through H$\alpha$ emission, the signature of OB stars, and at 100 Myr scale with UV emission, the gas surface density is traced by HI emission for the atomic phase. We choose to investigate feedback processes using fountain effects in M101, a nearby well-observed face-on galaxy. Face-on studies are very complementary to the more frequent edge-on observations of these fountains in the literature. We use high-resolution data from THINGS for the HI emission GALEX for UV, and SITELLE/SIGNALS IFU for the H$\alpha$ tracer. We have identified 20 new HI holes, in addition to the 52 holes found by Kamphuis in 1993. We study in more detail the nine holes satisfying strong criteria to be true fountain effects, compute their physical properties, and derive their energy balance. Only one small HI hole still contains H$\alpha$ and young stars inside, while the largest hole of 2.4 kpc and oldest age (94 Myr) is deprived of H$\alpha$ and UV. For face-on disks, the possibility to study simultaneously the HI shell morphology, the stellar association, and kinematic evidence is of primordial importance. In M101, we have quantified how stellar feedback is responsible for carving the observed cavities in the atomic gas disk, and how it can expel above the disk the neutral gas, which is then unavailable for star formation during up to 100 Myr.
