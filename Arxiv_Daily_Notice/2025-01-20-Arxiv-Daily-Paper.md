#### Star-Forming Nuclear Clusters in Dwarf Galaxies Mimicking AGN Signatures in the Mid-Infrared

 - **Abstract**
 Effectively finding and identifying active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in dwarf galaxies is an important step in studying black hole formation and evolution. In this work, we examine four mid-IR-selected AGN candidates in dwarf galaxies with stellar masses between $M_\star \sim 10^8 - 10^9 M_\odot$ , and find that the galaxies are host to nuclear star clusters (NSCs) that are notably rare in how young and massive they are. We perform photometric measurements on the central star clusters in our target galaxies galaxies using Hubble Space Telescope optical and near-IR imaging and compare their observed properties to models of stellar population evolution. We find that these galaxies are host to very massive ($\sim10^7 M_\odot$), extremely young ($\lesssim 8$ Myr), dusty ($0.6 \lesssim \mathrm{A_v} \lesssim 1.8$) nuclear star clusters. Our results indicate that these galactic nuclei have ongoing star-formation, are still at least partially obscured by clouds of gas and dust, and are most likely producing the extremely red AGN-like mid-IR colors. Moreover, prior work has shown that these galaxies do not exhibit X-ray or optical AGN signatures. Therefore, we recommend caution when using mid-IR color-color diagnostics for AGN selection in dwarf galaxies, since, as directly exemplified in this sample, they can be contaminated by massive star clusters with ongoing star formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Hydrodynamic instabilities likely operate in protoplanetary disks. One candidate, Convective Overstability (COS), can be triggered in regions with a negative radial entropy gradient. The ensuing turbulence and flow structures are expected to affect dust dynamics directly. We revisit the interaction between dust and the COS with high-resolution spectral simulations in the unstratified, axisymmetric Boussinesq shearing box framework. We find zonal flows, or pressure bumps, formed by the COS trap dust, as expected, but dust densities increase at most by a factor of $O(10)$ over its background value due to the zonal flows' unsteady nature. Furthermore, dust feedback can impede the formation of zonal flows, even at small dust-to-gas ratios $\epsilon \sim O(0.1)$. We interpret this phenomenon as a competition between the negative gas angular momentum flux associated with zonal flow formation and the positive dust angular momentum flux associated with its drift towards pressure maxima. Dust concentration significantly weakens when a large-scale radial pressure gradient induces a background dust drift. Ultimately, we find that dust concentration by COS-induced zonal flows is limited to $\epsilon \lesssim 1$. Whether this can be improved under more realistic geometries must be addressed with stratified and full 3D simulations at equivalent resolutions.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The emergence of mixed modes during the subgiant phase, whose frequencies are characterized by a fast evolution with age, can potentially enable a precise determination of stellar properties, a key goal for future missions like PLATO. However, current modelling techniques often consider grids that lack the resolution to properly account for the fast mode frequency evolution, consequently requiring the use of interpolation algorithms to cover the parameter space in between the grid models when applying model-data comparison methods. Aims. We aim at reproducing the $\ell$=1 mode frequencies within the accuracy limits associated with the typical observational errors ($\sim$0.1 $\mu$Hz) through interpolation on a grid of subgiant models. Methods. With that aim, we used variations of a two-step interpolation algorithm, which considered linear and cubic splines interpolation methods and different age proxies (physical age, scaled age, and central density). Results. The best results were obtained using an algorithm that considers cubic splines interpolation along tracks, linear interpolation across tracks, and central density $\rho_\text{c}$ as the age proxy. This combination yielded, on average, an absolute error of 0.14 $\mu$Hz, but reached maximum absolute errors on the interpolated frequencies of 1.2 $\mu$Hz for some models, which is an order of magnitude higher than the typical observational errors. Furthermore, we investigated the impact on the accuracy of the interpolation from changes in the physical properties of the stars, showing, in particular, how the addition of core overshoot can affect significantly the interpolation results.
#### Dual-component stellar assembly histories in local elliptical galaxies via MUSE

 - **Abstract**
 Elliptical galaxies often exhibit complex assembly histories, and are presumed to typically form through a combination of rapid, early star formation and subsequent accretion of material, often resulting from mergers with other galaxies. To investigate theories of spheroidal galaxy formation, the objective of this work is to analyse the star formation histories (SFHs) of a sample of three isolated elliptical galaxies in the local Universe observed with MUSE at $z<0.06$. With BUDDI, we decompose the integral field unit (IFU) datacubes into two components with Sérsic profiles, which roughly correspond to the two phases of in-situ and ex-situ star formation. To constrain the mode of growth in these galaxies, we derived the mass and light-weighted stellar ages and metallicities, and created the 2D stellar population maps of each component using pPXF. We reconstructed the mass and light-weighted SFHs to constrain the contribution of different stellar populations to the mass and luminosity of the components through cosmic time. Our results show that the ellipticals in this sample have experienced an early and rapid phase of star formation either through a rapid dissipative collapse or gas-rich major mergers concentrated in the inner component, which contributes to $\sim50$% of the galaxy stellar mass. The co-dominant outer component, however, had assembled the bulk of its stellar mass shortly after the inner component did, through accretion via dry mergers and possible gas accretion. This premise is supported by our observations of the inner component being primarily composed of old and metal-rich stars. The outer component has a combination of old and intermediate-age stars, with a moderate spread in metallicities. These results are analysed through the lens of the two-phase scenario, a framework developed over the years to explain the formation histories of elliptical galaxies.
#### Observation of discontinuities in the periodic modulation of PSR B1828-11

 - **Abstract**
 PSR B1828-11 is a radio pulsar that undergoes periodic modulations (~500 days) of its spin-down rate and beam width, providing a valuable opportunity to understand the rotational dynamics of neutron stars. The periodic modulations have previously been attributed to planetary companion(s), precession, or magnetospheric effects and have several interesting features: they persist over 10 cycles, there are at least two harmonically related components, and the period is decreasing at a rate of about 5 days per cycle. PSR B1828-11 also experienced a glitch, a sudden increase in its rotation frequency, at 55 040.9 Modified Julian Day(MJD). By studying the interaction of the periodic modulations with the glitch, we seek to find evidence to distinguish explanations of the periodic modulation. Using a phenomenological model, we analyse a recently published open data set from Jodrell Bank Observatory, providing the longest and highest resolution measurements of the pulsar's spin-down rate data. Our phenomenological model consists of step changes in the amplitude, modulation frequency, and phase of the long-term periodic modulation and the usual spin-down glitch behaviour. We find clear evidence with a (natural-log) Bayes factor of 1486 to support that not only is there a change to these three separate parameters but that the shifts occur before the glitch. Finally, we also present model-independent evidence which demonstrates visually how and when the modulation period and amplitude change. Discontinuities in the modulation period are difficult to explain if a planetary companion sources the periodic modulations, but we conclude with a discussion on the insights into precession and magnetospheric switching.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have uncovered a substantial population of high-redshift broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs) characterized by moderate luminosities, weak X-ray emissions, and faint high-ionization lines, challenging conventional models of black hole growth and AGN activity. In this study, we propose that these sources are accreting at super-Eddington rates and use geometrically thick, non-advective disk models to investigate the critical roles of photon scattering, reflections, and shadowing within funnel-like structures along the disk's rotation axis. Our models predict highly collimated radiation fields, with isotropic-equivalent luminosities vastly exceeding the Eddington limit in polar directions, and significant suppression of emission at higher inclination angles due to shadowing. These effects result in altered spectral energy distributions and pronounced anisotropies in observable properties. Key features include ultra-blue UV continuum slopes (alpha=+0.5 to +0.8), bolometric correction factors varying by over an order of magnitude with orientation, and suppressed coronal X-ray emissions. The anisotropy and shadowing effects may also explain the observed faintness of broad high-ionization emission lines, as the viewing angle strongly modulates both continuum brightness and the illumination of the broad-line region. These findings indicate that super-Eddington accretion flows, shaped by thick disk geometries and anisotropic radiation fields, can naturally account for many puzzling features of JWST-discovered AGNs and provide new insights into black hole growth in the early universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Many close-in multiple-planet systems show a peas-in-a-pod trend, where neighbouring planets have similar sizes, masses, and orbital spacing. Others, including the Solar System, have a more diverse size and mass distribution. Classical planet formation models tend to produce the former rather than the latter, and the origin of this difference remains unclear. Recent studies suggest disc evolution is largely driven by magnetic winds rather than viscosity alone. In such wind-driven accretion discs, the mass accretion rate varies radially instead of being constant, as in classical viscous discs. We investigate how the wind's efficiency in removing disc mass affects planet formation and migration. We performed single-core planet formation simulations via pebble accretion in wind-driven accretion discs. We varied wind efficiency via the magnetic lever arm parameter $ \lambda $ and studied outcomes by considering a range of initial disc masses and accretion timescales. Our simulations show that higher $ \lambda $ discs, with less wind mass loss, lead to faster formation and migration, generating similar-mass planetary systems. Lower $ \lambda $ discs lead to slower formation and migration and more diverse-mass planetary systems. A mass jump occurs for all $ \lambda $ cases when planet formation and disc accretion timescales are comparable, but is larger for lower $ \lambda $ discs. Super-Earth systems with cold Jupiters form more frequently in metal-rich discs, consistent with observations. Our simulations suggest similar-mass and diverse-mass systems are approximately separated at $ \lambda \sim 2\text{--}3 $.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of a new binary galaxy cluster merger, the Champagne Cluster (RM J130558.9+263048.4), using a detection method that identifies dynamically active clusters in the redMaPPer SDSS DR8 photometric galaxy cluster catalog. The Champagne Cluster exhibits the classic X-ray morphology of a post-pericenter dissociative galaxy cluster merger: an X-ray peak located between two galaxy overdensities at the same redshift. We conducted a Keck/DEIMOS survey and obtained redshifts for 103 member galaxies. The redshift analysis indicates a relative velocity of 411 $\pm$ 180 km/s between the two subclusters, which suggests that the merger is happening near the plane of the sky. We used cosmological simulations to find analogous systems to constrain the time since pericenter (74-250 Myr) and the angle the merger axis makes with the plane of the sky (62$^\circ$-90$^\circ$) at the 68$\%$ confidence level. We estimated the bulk temperature (8.20 $\pm 1.2$ keV) and total X-ray luminosity (5.2 $\pm$ 0.8 $\times$ $10^{44}$ erg $\times$ $s^{-1}$) of the intracluster medium using $\textit{Chandra}$ archival data.

 - **Abstract**
 X-ray data provide insights into accretion processes and the compact objects of ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs), while optical and infrared (IR) observations help identify the donor star and surrounding environment. Together, these approaches shed light on the origins of the high X-ray luminosities observed in ULXs. This study examines the optical and infrared properties of eight ULXs in NGC 1559 using archival data from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). To constrain the nature of the donor stars of the ULXs, photometric results were obtained from the temporal, spectral energy distributions (SEDs), and color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs). Furthermore, the long-term and spectral characteristics of only a ULX X-1 were investigated. ULX counterparts were determined from astrometric calculations. The long-term light curves and SEDs were constructed to interpret the origin of the optical and IR emissions. The masses and ages of donor star candidates were determined using CMDs. To constrain the mechanism of X-ray emission, the time-averaged spectrum and long-term light curve of the X-1 were obtained. Unique optical and IR counterparts for ULXs X-14 and X-24 were determined, while only optical counterparts were detected for X-1 and X-18. Our findings indicate that the optical emission originates from the donor stars of X-14 and X-24, whereas for X-1 and X-18, it is dominated by the accretion disk. In addition, the X-1 exhibits long-term X-ray variability spanning orders of magnitude.

 - **Abstract**
 The electromagnetic (EM) scattering by non-symmetric wavelength-scale particles on a planar surface has numerous applications in the remote sensing of planetary bodies, both in planetary and geo-sciences. We conduct numerical simulations of EM scattering by rough polyhedral particles (with 12 or 20 faces) using the discrete-dipole approximation and contrast the results to that of spheres. The particles have permittivities corresponding to common minerals in the microwave regime ($\epsilon_r=4.7 + 0.016$i and $7.8 + 0.09$i), and a size-frequency distribution (SFD) consistent with the observed scattering properties (power law distribution of size parameters between 0.5 and 8 with an index from $-2.5$ to $-3.5$). The assumed substrate permittivity $2.4 + 0.012$i corresponds to a powdered regolith. We present what roles the particle roundness, permittivity, and SFD for a realistic range of parameters play in the EM scattering properties as a function of incidence angle with a focus on backscattering in microwave-remote-sensing applications. The particle roundness and SFD have a clearly observable effect on the polarimetric properties, while the role of permittivity is relatively minor (in the studied range). Among various backscattering observables, the circular polarization ratio is the least sensitive to the decrease of the upper boundary (down to a size parameter of 3) and the index of the SFD.

 - **Abstract**
 In the context of the hierarchical formation of galaxies, we investigated the role played by mergers in shaping the scaling relations of galaxies, that is the projections of their Fundamental Plane onto the Ie-Re, Ie-Sigma, Ms-Re and L-Sigma planes. To this aim, based on the scalar Virial Theorem, we developed a simple theory of multiple dry mergers to read both the large scale simulations and the companion scaling relations. The aim was to compare the results of this approach with the observational data and with two of the most recent and detailed numerical cosmo-hydro-dynamical simulations, that is Illustris-TNG and EAGLE (Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their Environments). We derived the above scaling relations for the galaxies of the MaNGA (Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO) and WINGS (Wide-field Imaging of Nearby Galaxy-Clusters Survey) databases and compared them with the observational data, the numerical simulations, and the results of our simple theory of dry mergers. The multiple dry merging mechanism is able to explain all the main characteristics of the observed scaling relations of galaxies, such as slopes, scatters, curvatures and zones of exclusion. The distribution of galaxies in these planes is continuously changing across time because of the merging activity and other physical processes, such as star formation, quenching, energy feedback, and so forth. The simple merger theory presented here yields the correct distribution of galaxies in the main scaling relations at all cosmic epochs. The precision is comparable with that obtained by the modern cosmo-hydro-dynamical simulations, with the advantage of providing a rapid exploratory response on the consequences engendered by different physical effects.

 - **Abstract**
 We combine infrared (IR) observations collected by the James Webb Space Telescope with optical deep images by the Hubble Space Telescope taken approximately 20 years earlier to compute proper-motion membership for the globular cluster (GC) M 4 (NGC 6121) along its entire white dwarf (WD) cooling sequence (CS). These new IR observations allow us, for only the second time in a GC, to compare WD models with observations over a wide range of wavelengths, constraining fundamental astrophysical properties of WDs. Furthermore, we investigate the presence of WDs with IR excess along the WD CS of M 4, similar to the recent study conducted on the GC NGC 6397. We also determine the age difference between M 4 and NGC 6397 by comparing the absolute F150W2 magnitudes of the luminosity function peak at the bottom of the observed WD CS, and find that M 4 is slightly younger, by 0.8+/-0.5 Gyr.

 - **Abstract**
 AGB stars are the primary source of dust and complex molecules in the interstellar medium. The determination of outflow parameters is often hindered by the unknown geometry of the circumstellar environment, creating a demand for high-angular resolution observations. We use our NIR spectra and photometry of the carbon AGB star V Cyg, along with literature data, to construct its SED over a wide range of wavelengths. The dust envelope responsible for the IR excess was also resolved in scattered polarized light at angular scales of 50-80 mas using differential speckle polarimetry. We present an interpretation of the thermal and scattered radiation of the dust using models of a spherical dusty outflow (Mdust = 5.3e-7 M_sun) and an inclined equatorial density enhancement, either in the form of a disk (Mdust = 7.6e-3 M_earth) or a torus (Mdust = 5.7e-3 M_earth), which material is concentrated at stellocentric distances less than 25 AU. The dust material consists of amorphous carbon and SiC, with 84% of the dust being amorphous carbon. Dust particle radii range from 5 to 950 nm and follow a power law with an exponent of -3.5. Modeling of the envelope allowed us to improve the accuracy of stellar luminosity estimations: 21000 L_sun and 8300 L_sun at maximum and minimum brightness, respectively. The relation between the disk and the high water content in the envelope is also discussed.
#### Variabilities driven by satellite black hole migration in AGN discs

 - **Abstract**
 The physical origin of active galactic nucleus (AGN) variability remains unclear. Here we propose that the magnetic reconnection driven by the migration of satellite black holes (sBHs) in the AGN disc can be a new plausible mechanism for AGN short-term variability. During the sBH migration, the co-moving plasmas surrounding the sBH could influence the large-scale magnetic field of the AGN disk and trigger the magnetic reconnections to contribute to AGN UV/optical variability. Meanwhile, the plasma, which is accelerated by the magnetic reconnection, will successfully escape from the disc at Alfven velocity and cause a secondary magnetic reconnection in the corona. For a $\sim 10^{2}-10^{3}~{M_\mathrm{\odot}}$ sBH (including its binding gas) in the inner regions of the disc surrounding a supermassive black hole with $\sim 10^{7}~{M_\mathrm{\odot}}$, the reconnection process occurred in the space out of the disc can produce X-ray emission, which can last $\sim 10^4-10^6~\rm s$ with the luminosity $\sim 10^{39}- 10^{43}~\rm{erg ~s^{-1}}$.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper investigates the effects of saturated thermal conduction (TC) and thermal-driven winds (TDWs) on magnetized advection-dominated accretion onto a rotating black hole (BH). We incorporate dissipative processes in the magnetized accretion flow and expect the accretion disk to be threaded by predominantly toroidal and turbulent magnetic fields. We solve the magnetohydrodynamics equations and construct a self-consistent steady model of the magnetized accretion flow surrounding a rotating BH, which includes TC and TDWs. We seek global accretion solutions spanning from the BH horizon to a large distance and analyze the solution's characteristics as a function of dissipation parameters. Accretion solutions with multiple critical points may exhibit shock waves if they meet the standing shock criteria. We found steady, global transonic, and shocked accretion solutions around the rotating BH. In particular, the wind parameter ($m$) and the saturated conduction parameter ($\Phi_{\rm s}$) significantly influence the dynamical behavior of shocks. The shock location moves away from the BH horizon as $\Phi_{\rm s}$ and $m$ increase, assuming fixed conditions at the disk's outer edge. Our formalism explains the declining phase of BH outbursts, characterized by a monotonic decrease in QPO frequency as the burst decays. Based on our findings, we conclude that the combined effect of $\Phi_{\rm s}$ and $m$ parameters substantially alters the steady shock specific energy vs angular momentum parameter space and also modifies the corresponding post-shock luminosity vs QPO frequency parameter space. We propose, based on our theoretical model, that the $\Phi_{\rm s}$ and $m$ parameters may significantly influence the evolution of the BH outbursts.

 - **Abstract**
 While stellar jets and outflows are fueled by accretion from disks, their direct influence on disks remain unexplored. Here we revisit ALMA observations of $^{12}$CO line emission for the young stellar object WSB 52. We identify an expanding bubble that interacts with its protoplanetary disk. Given that the disk axis points toward the bubble center and the kinetic energy of the bubble is roughly $10^{41}$~erg, we postulate that stellar jets, aligned with the disk axis, have triggered the bubble. The bubble morphology is consistent with uniform expansion with partial concavity, implying the bubble-disk interaction. Correspondingly, the shape and the velocity field of protoplanetary disk appear to be deformed and exhibit high-velocity components, suggesting strong interactions and mass loss from the disk. The discovery of jet feedback onto the disk via the bubble -- which we term the jet-bubble-disk interaction -- sheds new light on the dynamical processes governing star and planet formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Flux emergence in the solar atmosphere is a complex process that causes a release of magnetic energy as heat and acceleration of solar plasma at a variety of spatial scales. Methods: We analysed imaging spectropolarimetric data taken in the He 1083 nm line. This line is sensitive to temperatures larger than 15 kK, unlike diagnostics such as \MgIIhk, \CaIIHK, and \Halpha, which lose sensitivity already at 15 kK. The He I data is complemented by imaging spectropolarimetry in the \CaIIK, \Feline, and \Caline\ lines. We employed inversions to determine the magnetic field and vertical velocity in the solar atmosphere. We computed He 1083 nm profiles from a radiation-MHD simulation of the solar atmosphere to help interpretation of the observations. Results: We find fast-evolving blob-like emission features in the He 1083 nm triplet at locations where the magnetic field is rapidly changing direction, and these are likely sites of magnetic reconnection. We fit the line with a model consisting of an emitting layer located below a cold layer representing the fibril canopy. The modelling provides evidence that this model, while simple, catches the essential characteristics of the line formation. The morphology of the emission in the He 1083 nm line is localized and blob-like, unlike the emission in the \CaIIK\ line, which is more filamentary. Conclusions: The modelling shows that the \Heline\ emission features and their Doppler shifts can be caused by opposite-polarity reconnection and/or horizontal current sheets below the canopy layer in the chromosphere. Based on the high observed Doppler width and the blob-like appearance of the emission features, we conjecture that at least a fraction of them are produced by plasmoids. We conclude that transition-region-like temperatures in the deeper layers of the active region chromosphere are more common than previously thought.

 The hierarchical interplay among gravity, magnetic fields, and turbulent gas flows in delivering the necessary material to form massive protostellar clusters remains enigmatic. We have performed high-resolution (beam size $\sim$14 arcsec $\simeq$ 0.05 pc at a distance 725 pc) 850 $\mu$m dust polarization and C$^{18}$O molecular line observations of Cepheus A (Cep A), the second closest massive star-forming region, using the 15-meter James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) along with the SCUBA-2/POL-2 and HARP instruments. Our key analyses reveal that (i) morphologically, all three fields--gravitational (G), magnetic (B), and kinetic (K) fields--are aligned with each other, and (ii) energetically, they exhibit a hierarchical relationship with gravitational ($E_{\mathrm{G}}$) > magnetic ($E_{\mathrm{B}}$) > kinetic ($E_{\mathrm{K}}$). Gravity dominates in Cep A clump and, as a primary active player, dictates the other two agents. Consequently, gravity plays two active roles: (i) induces gas flows and (ii) drags B-field lines toward the gravitational trough. Since magnetic energy dominates kinetic energy, $E_{\mathrm{B}}$ > $E_{\mathrm{K}}$, the "dragged-in" B-field as a secondary active player can mitigate turbulence and instabilities, thereby regularizing gas flows into a more ordered configuration. At the $\sim$0.60 pc clump scale, these flows deliver material at a substantially high rate of $\sim$ 2.1$\times$10$^{-4}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ toward the cluster center. Our study, for the first time, presents new insights into how B-fields and turbulent gas flows passively assist the active role of gravity in the formation of a protostellar cluster, contrasting with the standard notion that these agents primarily oppose gravitational collapse.

 - **Abstract**
 The mass distribution of merging binary black holes is generically predicted to evolve with redshift, reflecting systematic changes in their astrophysical environment, stellar progenitors, and/or dominant formation channels over cosmic time. Whether or not such an effect is observed in gravitational-wave data, however, remains an open question, with some contradictory results present in the literature. In this paper, we study the ensemble of binary black holes within the latest GWTC-3 catalog released by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration, systematically surveying for possible evolution of their mass distribution with redshift. We specifically focus on two key features present in the binary black hole primary mass distribution -- (1) an excess of $35\,M_\odot$ black holes and (2) a broad power-law continuum ranging from 10 to $\gtrsim 80 M_\odot$ -- and ask if one or both of these features are observed to vary with redshift. We find no evidence that either the Gaussian peak or power-law continuum components of the mass distribution change with redshift. In some cases, we place somewhat stringent bounds on the degree of allowed redshift evolution. Most notably, we find that the mean location of the $35\,M_\odot$ peak and the slope of the power-law continuum are constrained to remain approximately constant below redshift $z\approx 1$. The data remain more agnostic about other forms of redshift dependence, such as evolution in the height of the $35\,M_\odot$ excess or the minimum and maximum black hole masses. In all cases, we conclude that a redshift-dependent mass spectrum remains possible, but that it is not required by current data.

 - **Abstract**
 The torus in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) is a complex dynamical structure of gas and dust. It is thought to be composed of an equatorial dusty disk and a polar dusty wind launched by radiation pressure. However, this picture is based on studies of moderately accreting AGN. Models suggest that the disk/wind structure will change with specific accretion rate. Here we examine the wind launching region in two high accretion rate objects, I Zw 1 (super-Eddington) and H0557-385 (high-Eddington), using high spatial resolution interferometric observations in the $K$-band from VLTI/GRAVITY and $LM$-bands VLTI/MATISSE. We recover wavelength-dependent sizes of the dust emission using a Gaussian and power law fit to the visibilities. Both objects are partially resolved and have radial sizes in the $KLM$-bands between 0.3 - 1.5 mas, with no signs of elongation. Combining our measurements with VLTI/MIDI $N$-band data gives a full multi-wavelength picture of the dust structure. We find that in H0557-385, the dust sizes between $3.5-8\:\mu\mathrm{m}$ are independent of the wavelength, roughly constant at $3-10$ sublimation radii. We argue that this indicates a direct view of the wind launching region and, together with an absence of polar elongation, this implies that any wind would be launched in a preferentially equatorial direction or blown out by strong radiation pressure. The size-wavelength relation for both objects shows a preferentially disky equatorial dust distribution. We conclude that there is strong evidence that the Eddington ratio shapes the inner dust structure, most notably the wind-launching region and wind direction.
