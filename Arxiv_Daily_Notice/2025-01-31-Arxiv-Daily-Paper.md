 - **Abstract**
 DESTINY+ is a planned JAXA medium-class Epsilon mission from Earth to deep space using a low-thrust, many-revolution orbit. Such a trajectory design is a challenging problem not only for trajectory design but also for flight operations, and in particular, it is essential to evaluate the impact of operational uncertainties to ensure mission success. In this study, we design the low-thrust trajectory from Earth orbit to a lunar transfer orbit by differential dynamic programming using the Sundman transformation. The results of Monte Carlo simulations with operational uncertainties confirm that the spacecraft can be successfully guided to the lunar transfer orbit by using the feedback control law of differential dynamic programming in the angular domain.

 - **Abstract**
 In the age of large-scale galaxy and lensing surveys, such as DESI, Euclid, Roman and Rubin, we stand poised to usher in a transformative new phase of data-driven cosmology. To fully harness the capabilities of these surveys, it is critical to constrain the poorly understood influence of baryon feedback physics on the matter power spectrum. We investigate the use of a powerful and novel cosmological probe - fast radio bursts (FRBs) - to capture baryonic effects on the matter power spectrum, leveraging simulations from the CAMELS projects, including IllustrisTNG, SIMBA, and Astrid. We find that FRB statistics exhibit a strong correlation, independet of the subgrid model and cosmology, with quantities known to encapsulate baryonic impacts on the matter power spectrum, such as baryon spread and the halo baryon fraction. We propose an innovative method utilizing FRB observations to quantify the effects of feedback physics and enhance weak lensing measurements of $S_{8}$. We outline the necessary steps to prepare for the imminent detection of large FRB populations in the coming years, focusing on understanding the redshift evolution of FRB observables and mitigating the effects of cosmic variance.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of a $z\sim7$ group of galaxies that contains two Little Red Dots (LRDs) just 3.3 kpc apart, along with three satellite galaxies, as part of the Canadian NIRISS Unbiased Cluster Survey (CANUCS). These LRDs are massive ($M_\star\sim10^{10}\,M_\odot$) and dusty (A(V) $>1$ mag) whereas the three satellites are lower-mass objects ($M_\star\sim10^{8-9}\,M_\odot$) subject to low dust attenuations. The spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of this LRD pair show strong evidence for a Balmer Break, consistent with a recent ($\sim 100$ Myr) quenching of star formation. In contrast, the satellites are compatible with a recent-onset ($\sim 100$ Myr), ongoing burst of star formation. LRD1's SED is consistent with a dust-free AGN as the source of the UV excess in the galaxy. The optical continuum would be powered by the emission from an obscured post-starburst and the AGN at a subdominant level. LRD2's SED is more ambiguous to interpret, but it could also be indicative of a dust-free AGN. The proximity of the two LRDs suggests that their interaction may be responsible for their recent star formation histories, which can be interpreted as environmental bursting and quenching in the Epoch of Reionization.
#### The PICS Project. I. The impact of metallicity and helium abundance on the bright end of the planetary nebula luminosity function

 - **Abstract**
 Planetary nebulae (PNe) and their luminosity function (PNLF) in galaxies have been used as a cosmic distance indicator for decades, yet a fundamental understanding is still lacking to explain the universality of the PNLF among different galaxies. Models for the PNLF have generally assumed solar metallicities and artificial stellar populations. In this work, we investigate how metallicity and helium abundances affect the PNe and PNLF, and the importance of the initial-to-final mass relation (IFMR), to resolve the tension between PNLF observations and models. We introduce PICS (PNe In Cosmological Simulations), a PN model framework that accounts for metallicity and is applicable to realistic stellar populations from cosmological simulations and observations. The framework combines stellar evolution models with post-AGB tracks and PN models to obtain PNe from a parent stellar population. We find that metallicity plays an important role for the resulting PNe: old metal-rich populations can harbor much brighter PNe than old metal-poor ones. We show that the helium abundance is a vital ingredient at high metallicities and explore the impact on the PNLF of a possible saturation of the helium content at higher metallicities. We present PNLF grids for different stellar ages and metallicities, where the observed PNLF bright end can be reached even for old stellar populations of 10 Gyr at high metallicities. Finally, we find that the PNLFs of old stellar populations are very sensitive to the IFMR, allowing for the production of bright PNe. With PICS, we have laid the groundwork for studying how different models affect the PNe and PNLF. Two central ingredients for this are the metallicity and helium abundance. Future applications of PICS include modeling PNe in a cosmological framework to explain the origin of the universal PNLF bright-end cutoff and use it as a diagnostic tool for galaxy formation.

 - **Abstract**
 The proximity & low dust extinction of the Magellanic Clouds provides an ideal environment for metal-poor massive stars to be studied in detail. The HST ULLYSES initiative has provided exquisite ultraviolet spectroscopy of a large sample of OB stars in the Magellanic Clouds, and its legacy value has been enhanced through the acquisition of optical VLT/XShooter spectroscopy (XShootU). We aim to determine the spectral types and physical properties of 122 LMC & 103 SMC OB stars observed via XShootU. Physical parameters are required for these to serve as templates in spectral libraries of metal poor massive stars. We also aim to identify double-lined binaries and OeBe stars for which analysis requires non-standard treatment. We apply a pipeline designed to analyse large spectroscopic samples of hot luminous stars to XShootU spectroscopic datasets, together with grids of synthetic model spectra computed with the non-LTE atmospheric code fastwind at LMC & SMC metallicities. We determine physical and wind properties of 97 LMC & 77 SMC massive stars, ranging from O2 to B9 subtypes, representing the majority of the XShootU OB sample (OeBe & candidate SB2 systems are excluded). Results are broadly in agreement with previous optical spectroscopic studies, with evolutionary masses spanning 12-117 Msun in the LMC & 11-74 Msun in the SMC. We determine a revised Teff-spectral type calibration for Magellanic Cloud stars, identify stars with peculiar radial velocities, and compare wind properties of high luminosity O stars with dense winds, revealing ~0.27 dex higher wind momenta of LMC stars with respect to SMC counterparts. Incorporating the recent empirical metallicity dependence of Z^0.22 for wind velocities, this suggests a mass-loss dependence of Z^0.5 for luminous O stars. Studies incorporating ultraviolet mass-loss diagnostics are required for OB stars with weak winds and/or low luminosities.

 - **Abstract**
 Precise, unbiased measurements of extragalactic background anisotropies require careful treatment of systematic effects in fluctuation-based, broad-band intensity mapping measurements. In this paper we detail improvements in methodology for the Cosmic Infrared Background ExpeRiment (CIBER), concentrating on flat field errors and source masking errors. In order to bypass the use of field differences, which mitigate flat field errors but reduce sensitivity, we characterize and correct for the flat field on pseudo-power spectra, which includes both additive and multiplicative biases. To more effectively mask point sources at 1.1 $\mu$m and 1.8 $\mu$m, we develop a technique for predicting masking catalogs that utilizes optical and NIR photometry through random forest regression. This allows us to mask over two Vega magnitudes deeper than the completeness limits of 2MASS alone, with errors in the shot noise power remaining below $<10\%$ at all masking depths considered. Through detailed simulations of CIBER observations, we validate our formalism and demonstrate unbiased recovery of the sky fluctuations on realistic mocks. We demonstrate that residual flat field errors comprise $<20\%$ of the final CIBER power spectrum uncertainty with this methodology.
#### CIBER 4th flight fluctuation analysis: Measurements of near-IR auto- and cross-power spectra on arcminute to sub-degree scales

 - **Abstract**
 We present new anisotropy measurements in the near-infrared (NIR) for angular multipoles $300<\ell<10^5$ using imaging data at 1.1 $\mu$m and 1.8 $\mu$m from the fourth flight of the Cosmic Infrared Background ExpeRiment (CIBER). Using improved analysis methods and higher quality fourth flight data, we detect surface brightness fluctuations on scales $\ell<2000$ with CIBER auto-power spectra at $\sim14\sigma$ and 18$\sigma$ for 1.1 and 1.8 $\mu$m, respectively, and at $\sim10\sigma$ in cross-power spectra. The CIBER measurements pass internal consistency tests and represent a $5-10\times$ improvement in power spectrum sensitivity on several-arcminute scales relative to that of existing studies. Through cross-correlations with tracers of diffuse galactic light (DGL), we determine that scattered DGL contributes $<10\%$ to the observed fluctuation power at high confidence. On scales $\theta > 5'$, the CIBER auto- and cross-power spectra exceed predictions for integrated galactic light (IGL) and integrated stellar light (ISL) by over an order of magnitude, and are inconsistent with our baseline IGL+ISL+DGL model at high significance. We cross-correlate two of the CIBER fields with 3.6 $\mu$m and 4.5 $\mu$m mosaics from the Spitzer Deep Wide-Field Survey and find similar evidence for departures from Poisson noise in Spitzer-internal power spectra and CIBER $\times$ Spitzer cross-power spectra. A multi-wavelength analysis indicates that the auto-power of the fluctuations at low-$\ell$ is bluer than the Poisson noise from IGL and ISL; however, for $1' <\theta < 10'$, the cross-correlation coefficient $r_{\ell}$ of nearly all band combinations decreases with increasing $\theta$, disfavoring astrophysical explanations that invoke a single correlated sky component.
#### Testing the local void solution to the Hubble tension using baryon acoustic oscillation measurements over the last twenty years

 - **Abstract**
 A promising solution to the Hubble tension is a local void that is roughly 20% underdense out to 300 Mpc, as suggested by galaxy number counts in the near-infrared. Gravitationally driven outflows from this KBC void might inflate redshifts enough to solve the Hubble tension, a scenario explored in detail by Haslbauer et al. We obtain predictions for the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) observables in their best-fitting void models and a control model that assumes the homogeneous $Planck$ cosmology. We compare these models against our compilation of available BAO measurements from the past twenty years. We find that the quality and quantity of available measurements are best using the isotropically averaged distance $D_V$. Taking its ratio with the expected value in the control model yields good agreement with unity at high redshift, but a discrepancy appears that systematically grows with decreasing redshift. Assuming independent uncertainties, the 41 considered $D_V$ observations give a total $\chi^2$ of 70.5 for the control void-free model, while the void models give only $44.8 - 46.7$ depending on the density profile. This represents a reduction in overall tension from $3.0\sigma$ without a void to $1.0\sigma - 1.2\sigma$ in the void models. The $\chi^2$ differences are smaller when considering measurements of the angular BAO scale or its redshift depth, but the void-free model provides the worst fit in all cases. Overall, our results suggest that recent hints of BAO observables deviating from expectations in the homogeneous $Planck$ cosmology could indicate a local void, which was motivated by considerations unrelated to BAO data or the Hubble tension.

 - **Abstract**
 We present ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopic observations covering three distinct accretion states of the low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) MAXI J1820+070: the luminous hard state, a hard-intermediate state and the soft state. Our observations were obtained during the 2018 eruption of MAXI J1820+070 with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and AstroSat observatory. The extinction towards the source turns out to be low - $\rm E_{B-V} = 0.2 \pm 0.05$ - making it one of the best UV accretion laboratories among LMXBs. Remarkably, we observe only moderate differences between all three states, with all spectra displaying similar continuum shapes and emission lines. Moreover, the continua are not well-described by physically plausible irradiated disc models. All of this challenges the standard reprocessing picture for UV emission from erupting LMXBs. The UV emission lines are double-peaked, with high-ionization lines displaying higher peak-to-peak velocities. None of the lines display obvious outflow signatures, even though blue-shifted absorption features have been seen in optical and near-infrared lines during the hard state. The emission line ratios are consistent with normal abundances, suggesting that the donor mass at birth was low enough to avoid CNO processing ($\rm M_{2,i} \lesssim 1.0 - 1.5 {\mathrm M_{\odot}}$). Finally, we study the evolution of UV variability in our time-resolved HST observations (hard and hard-intermediate states). All UV power spectra can be modelled with a broken power-law, superposed on which we tentatively detect the $\simeq 18$s quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) that has been seen in other spectral bands.

 - **Abstract**
 Dust grains play a crucial role in the modeling of protostellar formation, particularly through their opacity and interaction with the magnetic field. The destruction of dust grains in numerical simulations is currently modeled primarily by temperature dependent functions. However, a dynamical approach could be necessary to accurately model the vaporization of dust grains. We focused on modeling the evolution of dust grains during star formation, specifically on the vaporization of the grains by chemisputtering. We also investigated the evolution of non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic resistivities and the Planck and Rosseland mean opacities influenced by the grain evolution. We modeled the evolution of the dust by considering spherical grains at thermal equilibrium with the gas phase, composed only of one kind of material for each grain. We then took into account the exchange processes that can occur between the grains and the gas phase and that make the grain size evolve. We considered three materials for the grains: carbon, silicate, and aluminum oxide. Given a temporal evolution in temperature and density of the gas phase, we computed the evolution of a dust grain distribution. We observed a significant dependence of the sublimation temperature of the carbon grains on the dynamical evolution of the gas phase. The application of our method to trajectories where the temperature and density of the gas decrease after the sublimation of a portion of the grain distribution highlights the limitations of current vaporization prescriptions in simulations. The dynamical approach leads to more accurate results for the carbon grain quantity when the temperature and density of the gas evolve quickly. The dynamical approach application to collapse and disk evolution is then foreseen with its integration into hydrodynamic simulations.
#### Spatially Resolved Circumgalactic Medium Around a Star-Forming Galaxy Driving a Galactic Outflow at $z\approx 0.8$

 - **Abstract**
 We report the small-scale spatial variation in cool ($T\sim 10^4 K$) Mg II absorption detected in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of a star-forming galaxy at $z\approx 0.8$. The CGM of this galaxy is probed by a spatially extended bright background gravitationally lensed arc at $z = 2.76$. The background arc continuously samples the CGM of the foreground galaxy at a range of impact parameters between 54-66 kpc. The Mg II absorption strengths vary by more than a factor of two within these ranges. A power-law fit to the fractional variation of absorption strengths yields a coherence length of 2.7 kpc within these absorption lines. This suggests a high degree of spatial coherence in the CGM of this galaxy. The host galaxy is driving a strong galactic outflow with a mean outflow velocity $\approx$ -179 km/s and mass outflow rate $\dot{M}_{out}\geq 64_{-27}^{+31} M_{\odot}yr^{-1}$ traced by blueshifted Mg II and Fe II absorption lines. The galaxy itself has a spatially extended emission halo with a maximum spatial extent of $\approx$ 33 kpc traced by [O II], [O III] and $H\beta$ emission lines. The extended emission halo shows kinematic signatures of co-rotating halo-gas with solar metallicity. Taken together, these observations suggest evidence of a baryon cycle that is recycling the outflowing gas to form the next generation of stars.
#### Simulating the photospheric to coronal plasma using magnetohydrodyanamic characteristics II: reflections on non-reflecting boundary conditions

 - **Abstract**
 We present our implementation of non-reflecting boundary conditions in the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) code LaRe3D. This implementation couples a characteristics-based boundary condition with a Lagrangian remap code, demonstrating the generality and flexibility of such non-reflecting boundary conditions for use with arbitrary grid-based MHD schemes. To test this implementation for perturbations on a background state, we present simulations of a hot sphere in an angled magnetic field. We then examine a series of simulations where we advect a spheromak through a non-reflecting boundary condition at four speeds related to the fast and slow magnetosonic speeds and the Alfven speed. We compare the behavior of these simulations to ground truth simulations run from the same initial condition on an extended grid that keeps the spheromak in the simulation volume at all times. We find that the non-reflecting boundary condition can lead to severe, physical differences developing between a simulation using a non-reflecting boundary and a ground truth simulation using a larger simulation volume. We conclude by discussing the origins of these differences.
#### Into the Mystic: the MUSE view of the ionized gas in the Mystic Mountains in Carina

 - **Abstract**
 We present optical integral field unit (IFU) observations of the Mystic Mountains, a dust pillar complex in the center of the Carina Nebula that is heavily irradiated by the nearby young massive cluster Trumpler 14. With the continuous spatial and spectral coverage of data from the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE), we measure the physical properties in the ionized gas including the electron density and temperature, excitation, and ionization. MUSE also provides an excellent view of the famous jets HH 901, 902, and 1066, revealing them to be high-density, low-ionization outflows despite the harsh environment. HH 901 shows spatially extended [C I] emission tracing the rapid dissociation of the photoevaporating molecular outflow in this highly irradiated source. We compute the photoevaporation rate of the Mystic Mountains and combine it with recent ALMA observations of the cold molecular gas to estimate the remaining lifetime of the Mystic Mountains and the corresponding shielding time for the embedded protostars. The longest remaining lifetimes are for the smallest structures, suggesting that they have been compressed by ionizing feedback. Our data do not suggest that star formation in the Mystic Mountains has been triggered but it does point to the role that ionization-driven compression may play in enhancing the shielding of embedded stars and disks. Planet formation models suggest that the shielding time is a strong determinant of the mass and orbital architecture of planets, making it important to quantify in high-mass regions like Carina that represent the type of environment where most stars form.

 - **Abstract**
 A microlensing exoplanet search is a unique method for finding planets orbiting distant stars. However, in the past, the method used to analyze microlensing data could not deal with complex lens systems. The number of lenses was limited three or less. Positions calculations of images and integration of them suffered from severe round-off errors because of singularities. We developed a new algorithm to calculate the light curves of multiple lens systems. In this algorithm, fractal-like consecutive self-similar division (SSD) is used to find sparse images. SSD is also useful for integrating images to efficiently obtain magnifications. The new algorithm does not use root finding for the lens equation and is free from caustic singularities. There is no limit on the number of lenses. Compared to inverse-ray shooting, this method dramatically improves the computing time. The calculation can be adjusted to obtain either a high-precision final result or high-speed quick result. Although this new algorithm was developed for a microlensing planet search, its application to quasar microlensing is also expected. This paper discusses problems in the modeling of a multiple lens system and then presents the new algorithm in detail.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Quasar outflows play a significant role in the active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback, impacting the interstellar medium and potentially influencing galaxy evolution. Characterizing these outflows is essential for understanding AGN-driven processes. Aims. We aim to analyze the physical properties of the mini-broad absorption line outflow in quasar J1402+2330 using data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey. We seek to measure the outflows location, energetics, and potential impact on AGN feedback processes. Methods. In the spectrum of J1402+2330, we identify multiple ionic absorption lines, including ground and excited states. We measure the ionic column densities and then use photoionization models to determine the total hydrogen column density and ionization parameter of the outflow. We utilized the population ratio of the excited state to the ground state of N iii and S iv to determine the electron number density. Results. The derived electron number density, combined with the ionization parameter, indicates an outflow distance of approximately 2200 pc from the central source. Having a mass outflow rate of more than one thousand solar masses per year and a kinetic energy output exceeding 5 percent of the Eddington luminosity, this outflow can significantly contribute to AGN feedback. Conclusions. Our findings suggest the absorption outflow in J1402+2330 plays a potentially significant role in AGN feedback processes. This study highlights the value of DESI data in exploring AGN feedback mechanisms.

 - **Abstract**
 We compare X-ray emission from several general relativistic, multi-frequency, radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations of thin black hole accretion disks with different accretion rates and spins. The simulations were performed using the M1 closure scheme, resolved with twelve frequency (energy) bins logarithmically spaced from $5 \times 10^{-3}$ to $5 \times 10^3$ keV. We apply a general relativistic Monte Carlo transport code to post-process the simulation data with greater fidelity in frequency resolution and Compton scattering treatment. Despite the relatively few energy bins and Kompaneets approximation to Compton scattering utilized in the M1 method, we find generally good agreement between the methods. Both produce prominent thermal profiles with peaks around 2 - 2.5 keV, where agreement is particularly strong and representative of the soft state. Both also find weaker (lower luminosity) thermally sourced emission extending out to 100 keV due to the hotter innermost regions of the disks. Inverse Compton scattering becomes increasingly effective at hardening spectral outputs with increasing black hole spin, and becomes the dominant mechanism for photons that escape with energies between 10 to several hundred keV. At very high rates of spin the radiation flux in this upscattered component becomes comparable to the thermal flux, a phenomenon typically associated with intermediate states. Beyond $10^4$ keV, we observe faint, free-free emission from hot, optically thin coronal regions developing near the horizon, common to both spinning and nonspinning black holes.
#### On the increase in the concentration of primordial black holes in the halos of dwarf galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 Through numerical experiments, we have predicted that if dark matter (DM) contains even a small fraction, $f_0\sim10^{-4}$, of primordial black holes (PBHs), during the formation of the gravitationally bound halo of a dwarf galaxy, these PBHs will concentrate in a region with a radius of about 10 pc, so that their local fraction will exceed 1%. Unlike previous studies of PBH migration to the centers of galaxies, the numerical experiments conducted here take into account the early formation of a massive "dress" of DM around the PBHs and the non-stationarity of the halo during its formation. Applying our results to models of heating stellar clusters in the Eridanus II and Segue I galaxies due to dynamical friction between stars and PBHs allows us to impose constraints on the abundance of PBHs that are two orders of magnitude stricter than previously thought.

 Observations show that molecular gas in spiral galaxies is organized into a network of interconnected systems through the gravitational coupling of multi-scale hub-filament structures. Building on this picture, we model molecular gas in the galaxy NGC 628 as a gravitational network, where molecular clouds are represented as nodes. Through analyzing this network, we can characterize both the gravitational interactions and the physical properties of the clouds using geometry-based network metrics. A strong correlation is observed between the geometric and physical properties of the nodes (clouds). High-mass clouds tend to exhibit less clustering and greater average separations, suggesting that they generally have fewer neighbors. During their formation and evolution, high-mass clouds may deplete nearby gas via accretion or merging, leading to more isolated characteristics within the network. This aligns with observations showing a decrease in the virial ratio of molecular clouds as their mass increases. For clouds at different evolutionary stages, less evolved clouds with lower mass are typically found in tighter gravitational subnetworks, with closer proximity to neighboring clouds. As a result, they are more prone to accretion or merging during evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 The physical factors that influence the development of molecular cloud's density contrast are connected to those that affect star formation in the galaxy. For NGC 628 (M74), the proportion of high- and low-density contrast clouds initially increases with the distance to the galactic center ($R_{G}$) and then keeps relatively stable. Spiral arms, bubbles and magnetic fields are not responsible for the variations in density contrast observed among molecular clouds. The effects of shear and tides calculated from the galactic rotation curve consistently decrease as $R_{G}$ increases, and the shear effect can be neglected. We further studied the tidal effects of the neighboring material on each cloud using the tidal tensor analysis and the pixel-by-pixel computation, after combining molecular gas, atomic gas and stellar mass surface density maps. When $R_{\rm G} <$ 4 kpc, the tidal strengths derived from the pixel-by-pixel computation decrease as $R_{\rm G}$ increases, and then remains relatively constant when $R_{\rm G} >$ 4 kpc. This aligns well with the dependence of the proportion of high- and low-density contrast clouds on $R_{\rm G}$. Therefore, the tidal effects of neighboring material have a significant impact on the development of molecular cloud's density contrast. A key factor contributing to the low star formation rate in the galactic center is the excessive tidal influences from neighboring material on molecular clouds, which hinder the gravitational collapse within these clouds, resulting in low density contrasts. The tidal effects from neighboring material may also be a significant contributing factor to the slowing down of a pure free-fall gravitational collapse for gas structures on galaxy-cloud scales revealed in our previous works by velocity gradient measurements.

 - **Abstract**
 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) observed with the technique of very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) are used as fiducial references on the sky to precisely measure the shape and orientation of the Earth. Their positions form a celestial reference frame that plays an important role in both astronomy and geodesy. This study investigates the accuracy and stability of the positions of the AGNs that are measured by simultaneous VLBI observations at 3.3, 5.5, 6.6, and 10.5 GHz. Based on position time series from dedicated geodetic solutions, we characterize the observed source position variations and identify the possible factors causing such variations. We find that the primary contributor is source structure for sources above 20-degree declination while the sensitivity of the observations to the declination coordinate predominates for sources below 20-degree declination. The position time series are further explored to derive more realistic uncertainties for the quad-band positions. Significant position offsets with respect to the positions at 2.2/8.6 GHz are found for 15% of the sources. For 6% of the sources, the offsets are larger than 0.8 milli-arcseconds. Source structure may be divided into two parts: the invisible structure (within the beam size) and the visible structure (on larger scales). The latter causes closure delays enlarging post-fit delay residuals in geodetic solutions whereas the former causes source position changes. Such position changes will contribute significantly to the offsets between radio and optical positions. Overall, this work highlights the necessity to have a specific quad-band catalog for processing operational quad-band observations.

 - **Abstract**
 This letter reports 12 novel spectroscopic detections of warm circumstellar dust orbiting polluted white dwarfs using JWST MIRI. The disks span two orders of magnitude in fractional infrared brightness and more than double the number of white dwarf dust spectra available for mineralogical study. Among the highlights are: i) the two most subtle infrared excesses yet detected, ii) the strongest silicate emission features known for any debris disk orbiting any main-sequence or white dwarf star, iii) one disk with a thermal continuum but no silicate emission, and iv) three sources with likely spectral signatures of silica glass. The near ubiquity of solid-state emission requires small dust grains that are optically thin, and thus must be replenished on year-to-decade timescales by ongoing collisions. The disk exhibiting a featureless continuum can only be fit by dust temperatures in excess of 2000K, implying highly refractory material comprised of large particles, or non-silicate mineral species. If confirmed, the glassy silica orbiting three stars could be indicative of high-temperature processes and subsequent rapid cooling, such as occur in high-velocity impacts or vulcanism. These detections have been enabled by the unprecedented sensitivity of MIRI LRS spectroscopy and highlight the capability and potential for further observations in future cycles.

 - **Abstract**
 Low-energy protons entering the field of view of the XMM-Newton telescope scatter with the X-ray mirror surface and might reach the X-ray detectors on the focal plane. They manifest in the form of a sudden increase in the rates, usually referred to as soft proton flares. By knowing the conversion factor between the soft proton energy and the deposited charge on the detector, it is possible to derive the incoming flux and to study the environment of the Earth magnetosphere at different distances. We present the results of testing these matrices with real data for the first time, while also exploring the seasonal and solar activity effect on the proton environment. The selected spectra are relative to 55 simultaneous MOS and PN observations with flares raised in four different temporal windows: December-January and July-August of 2001-2002 (solar maximum) and 2019-2020 (solar minimum). The main result of the spectral analysis is that the physical model representative of the proton spectra at the input of the telescope is a power law. However, a second and phenomenological component is necessary to take into account imprecision in the generation of the matrices at softer energies.

 - **Abstract**
 Utilising JWST, ALMA and the VLA we present high angular resolution (0.06''- 0.42''), multi-wavelength (4 micron - 3cm) observations of the VLA 1623-2417 protostellar system to characterise the origin, morphology and, properties of the continuum emission. JWST observations at 4.4 micron reveal outflow cavities for VLA 1623 A and, for the first time, VLA 1623 B, as well as scattered light from the upper layers of the VLA 1623 W disk. We model the millimetre-centimetre spectral energy distributions to quantify the relative contributions of dust and ionised gas emission, calculate dust masses, and use spectral index maps to determine where optical depth hinders this analysis. In general, all objects appear to be optically thick down to ~90 GHz, show evidence for significant amounts (10's - 100's M_Earth) of large (>1 mm) dust grains, and are dominated by ionised gas emission for frequencies ~<15 GHz. In addition, we find evidence of unsettled millimetre dust in the inclined disk of VLA 1623 B possibly attributed to instabilities within the circumstellar disk, adding to the growing catalogue of unsettled Class 0/I disks. Our results represent some of the highest resolution observations possible with current instrumentation, particularly in the case of the VLA. However, our interpretation is still limited at low frequencies (~<22 GHz) and thus motivates the need for next-generation interferometers operating at centimetre wavelengths.

 - **Abstract**
 The metal content of a galaxy's interstellar medium reflects the interplay between different evolutionary processes such as feedback from massive stars and the accretion of gas from the intergalactic medium. Despite the expected abundance of low-luminosity galaxies, the low-mass and low-metallicity regime remains relatively understudied. Since the properties of their interstellar medium resemble those of early galaxies, identifying such objects in the Local Universe is crucial to understand the early stages of galaxy evolution. We used the DR3 catalog of the Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS) to select low-metallicity dwarf galaxy candidates based on color selection criteria typical of metal-poor, star-forming, low-mass systems. The final sample contains approximately 50 candidates. Spectral energy distribution fitting of the 12 S-PLUS bands reveals that $\sim$ 90\% of the candidates are best fit by models with very low stellar metallicities. We obtained long-slit observations with the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph to follow-up a pilot sample and confirm whether these galaxies have low metallicities. We find oxygen abundances in the range $7.35<$ 12 + log(O/H) $< 7.93$ (5\% to 17\% of the solar value), confirming their metal-poor nature. Most targets are outliers in the mass-metallicity relation, i.e. they display a low metal content relative to their observed stellar masses. In some cases, perturbed optical morphologies might give evidence of dwarf-dwarf interactions or mergers. These results suggest that the low oxygen abundances may be associated with an external event causing the accretion of metal-poor gas, which dilutes the oxygen abundance in these systems.
#### Variability of the UV luminosity function with SPICE

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the variability of the UV luminosity function (UVLF) at $z > 5$ using the SPICE suite of cosmological, radiation-hydrodynamic simulations, which include three distinct supernova (SN) feedback models: bursty-sn, smooth-sn, and hyper-sn. The bursty-sn model, driven by intense and episodic SN explosions, produces the highest fluctuations in the star formation rate (SFR). Conversely, the smooth-sn model, characterized by gentler SN feedback, results in minimal SFR variability. The hyper-sn model, featuring a more realistic prescription that incorporates hypernova (HN) explosions, exhibits intermediate variability, closely aligning with the smooth-sn trend at lower redshifts. These fluctuations in SFR significantly affect the $\rm{M_{UV} - M_{halo}}$ relation, a proxy for UVLF variability. Among the models, bursty-sn produces the highest UVLF variability, with a maximum value of 2.5. In contrast, the smooth-sn and hyper-sn models show substantially lower variability, with maximum values of 1.3 and 1.5, respectively. However, in all cases, UVLF variability strongly correlates with host halo mass, with lower-mass halos showing greater variability due to more effective SN feedback in their shallower gravitational wells. The bursty-sn model, though, results in higher amplitudes. Variability decreases in lower mass haloes with decreasing redshift for all feedback models. This study underscores the critical role of SN feedback in shaping the UVLF, and highlights the mass and redshift dependence of its variability, suggesting that UVLF variability may alleviate the bright galaxy tension observed by JWST at high redshifts.
