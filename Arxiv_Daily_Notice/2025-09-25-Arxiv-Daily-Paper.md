#### Spectral Uniformity of Little Red Dots: A Natural Outcome of Coevolving Seed Black Holes and Nascent Starbursts

 - **Abstract**
 The birth of seeds of massive black holes (BHs) and nascent galaxies at cosmic dawn takes place in dense gaseous environments, which play a crucial role in shaping their coevolution and radiation spectra. We investigate gas accretion during the assembly of massive halos with $M_{\rm h}\gtrsim 10^{10-11}~M_\odot$ at redshifts $z\simeq 4-10$, driving both rapid BH feeding and concurrent nuclear starbursts. As the BH grows to $\sim 10^{6-7}~M_\odot$ via super-Eddington accretion, the accretion power inflates a dense envelope whose effective temperature approaches the Hayashi limit at $T_{\rm eff}\simeq 5000~{\rm K}$, producing red optical emission, while a coeval young stellar population of $\sim 10^7~M_\odot$ provides blue UV emission. This early coevolving system naturally reproduces the characteristic spectral features of the so-called little red dots (LRDs), a population of broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs), including the V-shaped UV-to-optical spectra and weakness of X-ray, infrared, and radio emission. Massive stars in the nuclear starburst soon explode as supernovae, injecting energy and momentum that expel gas from the nucleus, quench gas supply to the BH envelope, and ultimately drive a transition into normal AGN phases. For individual LRDs, the optical-to-UV luminosity ratio remains nearly constant at $L_{\rm opt}/L_{\rm UV}\simeq 2-10$ from the onset of accretion bursts for $\simeq 15~{\rm Myr}$, one-third of the Salpeter time, until quenching by stellar feedback. While this ratio is sustained for the LRD population at $z\simeq 4-8$, it declines toward lower redshifts as BHs can no longer maintain red envelopes, thereby losing the LRD characteristics.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the gravitational wave emission for 10 supernova progenitors from magnetorotational core-collapse to the supernova explosion using fully three-dimensional dynamical-spacetime general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations with the GPU-accelerated code $\texttt{GRaM-X}$. We consider 2 progenitors of zero-age-main-sequence mass $25M_\odot$ and 8 with zero-age-main-sequence masses of $35M_\odot$. For these models, we explore a range of rotation rates between $0.0$ and $3.5 \mathrm{rad}\, \mathrm{s}^{-1}$, along with initial seed magnetic field of either $10^{12}\mathrm{G}$ or $10^{13}\mathrm{G}$. The analysis of the 10 models presented provides a comprehensive and systematic initial investigation of the interplay between progenitor rotation, magnetic field strength, and progenitor structure in shaping the explosion dynamics and gravitational wave (GW) emission. We find that stronger seed magnetic fields ($10^{13}\mathrm{G}$) suppress the GW strain amplitude relative to models with weaker initial fields ($10^{12}\mathrm{G}$). Increasing the initial rotation rate results in a more dynamical explosion, yielding correspondingly stronger gravitational waves. In addition, the progenitor mass/composition also exhibit a significant impact on the explosion dynamics and the morphology of the resulting waveforms. Finally, we find that all of our models lie above the detectability threshold for 3rd generation detectors aLIGO, Einstein Telescope, and Cosmic explorer at a $10\mathrm{kpc}$ distance and most would even still be detectable at $10\mathrm{Mpc}$, opening the possibility for observing gravitational wave emission for CCSNe beyond our galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 Carbon is one of the main end products of nucleosynthesis in massive stars. In this work, we study the emission signatures of carbon in spectra of stripped envelope supernovae (SESNe). A grid of model nebular spectra is created using the NLTE radiative transfer code SUMO, with stellar evolution- and explosion models as inputs. In the models, [C I] {\lambda}8727 and [C I] {\lambda}{\lambda}9824, 9850 are identified as the only significant optical carbon lines, with contribution from both the O/C and He/C zones. To obtain estimates of L_[C I] {\lambda}8727, which is blended with the Ca II triplet, we introduce and apply the CaNARY code, a publicly available Monte Carlo scattering code. We study carbon lines in a sample of SESNe, and find that luminosities of [C I] {\lambda}{\lambda}9824, 9850 relative to the optical spectrum increase with time, just as in our model grid. However, the relative luminosities of both [C I] {\lambda}{\lambda}9824, 9850 and [C I] {\lambda}8727 are overproduced in our models. Multiple explanations for this discrepancy, such as too high carbon abundances in the stellar evolution models and underestimated cooling through molecule formation, are investigated. For those SNe where both lines are clearly observed, we use an analytical formalism to constrain their ejected carbon masses to the range ~0.2 - 2 Msun. However, several SNe yield upper limits of 0.05 Msun. We also show that [C I] {\lambda}{\lambda}9824, 9850 is a useful line to diagnose both carbon mass and the extent of the He/C zone. We strongly encourage observers and instrumentalists to target [C I] {\lambda}{\lambda}9824, 9850 in future SN observing campaigns.

 - **Abstract**
 Infrared (IR) fine-structure line (FSL) emission arises from the radiative de-excitation of collisionally-excited electrons in atoms and ions. Thanks to their high luminosities and relatively simple physics, IR FSLs have quickly become the workhorse for studying the formation and evolution of galaxies in the nearby and distant Universe. In this review, we introduce the physics of FSL emission and the diagnostics of the ISM that we can derive from them via first principle arguments. We summarize the history of FSL observations with a focus on the far-IR wavelengths and a particular emphasis on the on-going efforts aimed at characterizing galaxies at cosmic noon and beyond. We explore the dependence of emission line trends, such as those observed in `line deficits' or [CII]-SFR relations, as a function of redshift and galaxy types. Once selection biases are controlled for, IR FSLs are a powerful tool to constrain the physics of galaxies. The precise redshift information inferred from fine-structure line observations have enabled tracing their ISM properties across cosmic reionization. FSL observations have also led to estimates of the mass of different ISM phases, and of the SFR of distant galaxies. It is thanks to IR FSL observations that we have been able to measure the internal dynamics of high-z galaxies, which in turns has allowed us to test, e.g., the onset of black hole - host galaxy relations in the first billion years of the Universe and the presence of gas outflows associated with the baryon cycle in galaxies. Finally, FSLs have provided important clues on the physics of the ISM in the most distant galaxies known to date. We demonstrate the strength and limitations of using IR FSLs to advance our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution in the early universe, and we outline future perspective for the field.
#### Vacuum birefringence in the polarized X-ray emission of a radio magnetar

 - **Abstract**
 The quantum electrodynamics (QED) theory predicts that the quantum vacuum becomes birefringent in the presence of ultra-strong magnetic fields -- a fundamental effect yet to be directly observed. Magnetars, isolated neutron stars with surface fields exceeding $10^{14}$~G, provide unique astrophysical laboratories to probe this elusive prediction. Here, we report phase- and energy-resolved X-ray polarization measurements of the radio-emitting magnetar 1E 1547.0-5408 obtained with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE), in coordination with the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) and Parkes/Murriyang radio observations. We detect a high phase-averaged polarization degree of 65% at 2 keV, where the surface thermal emission is dominant, rising to nearly 80% at certain rotational phases, and remaining at $\gtrsim40\%$ throughout the radio beam crossing. We also observe a strong decrease in polarization from 2~keV to 4~keV. Detailed atmospheric radiative transfer modeling, coupled with geometrical constraints from radio polarization, demonstrate that the observed polarization behavior cannot be consistently explained without invoking magnetospheric vacuum birefringence (VB) influences. These observational findings combined with the theoretical results represent compelling evidence for naturally occurring quantum VB. This work marks a significant advance toward confirming this hallmark prediction of QED and lays the foundation for future tests of strong-field quantum physics using next-generation X-ray polarimeters.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic rays (CRs) are an important source of feedback in a variety of astrophysical contexts. Magneto-hydrodynamical (MHD) simulations treating CRs as a fluid have shown that how their feedback operates is strongly dependent on their transport properties such as diffusion and streaming. In this paper we introduce the numerical implementation, in the adaptive-mesh-refinement MHD code RAMSES, of the grey two-moment formulation of CR fluid dynamics, which follows the energy density and its associated three-dimensional flux. This method is tested for CR diffusion, streaming, and advection in a series of multi-dimensional tests including shocks to check the robustness and stability of this numerical two-moment CRMHD solver. We finally use the new two-moment CR implementation in a complex simulation of an isolated galactic disc producing galaxy-wide outflows launched by small-scale supernova explosions, and compare it with a previously existing one-moment formulation in the same code.

 - **Abstract**
 Dwarf Spheroidal (dSph) galaxies are very promising laboratories for the indirect search for dark matter (DM), due to their low astrophysical background in radio and gamma-ray frequencies. This is convenient when considering Weakly Interacting Dark Matter (WIMP) that can annihilate and produce radio continuum emission. Radio detections of dSph galaxies, however, prove to be difficult and motivate the consideration of transient galaxies that have just recently become quiescent. For the past several decades, the prompt emission from DM annihilation signatures has been explored through modeling and the setting of limits. In addition to the prompt annihilation signatures from neutrinos, gamma-rays, electrons, positrons, and antimatter, the secondary emission from charged annihilation products undergoing radiative loss processes also contributes to the picture. For instance, synchrotron radiation and inverse Compton scattering of charged products such as electrons and positrons can provide a significant signal. The quantitative modeling of this secondary emission with the astrophysical background is necessary to place stringent constraints on the nature of DM. In this work, the multi-wavelength secondary spectrum of DM annihilation for a dwarf galaxy is calculated using the open-source code CRPropa 3.2, which enables the self-consistent treatment of the astrophysical background and secondary emissions. We present a systematic comparison of signatures from conventional astrophysical processes to those expected from DM annihilation. The morphological differences between the two scenarios are investigated. Tests of the impact of different magnetic fields, DM masses, and DM profiles will be performed in the next steps.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the joint mass-redshift evolution of the binary black hole merger rate in the latest gravitational-wave detection catalog, GWTC-4.0. We present and apply a novel non-parametric framework for modeling multi-dimensional, correlated distributions based on Delaunay triangulation. Crucially, the complexity of the model -- namely, the number, positions, and weights of triangulation nodes -- is inferred directly from the data, resulting in a highly efficient approach that requires about one to two orders of magnitude fewer parameters and significantly less calibration than current state-of-the-art methods. We find no evidence for a peak at $M_{\mathrm{tot}} \sim 70\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ at low redshift ($z \sim 0.2$), where it would correspond to the $m_1 \sim 35\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ feature reported in redshift-independent mass spectrum analyses, and we infer an increased merger rate at high redshift $(z \sim 1)$ around those masses, compatible with such a peak. We discuss the astrophysical implications of these results.
#### Efficiency of viscous angular momentum transport in dissipating Be binaries

 - **Abstract**
 Angular momentum transport is a fundamental process shaping the structure, evolution, and lifespans of stars and disks across a wide range of astrophysical systems. Be stars offer a valuable environment for studying viscous transport of angular momentum in massive stars, thanks to their rapid rotation, observable decretion disks, and likely absence of strong magnetic fields. This study analyzes angular momentum loss in 40 Be binary simulations spanning a range of orbital separations and companion masses, using a smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code. A novel framework is introduced to define the outer disk edge based on the behavior of the azimuthal velocity, streamlining the analysis of angular momentum transport within the system. Applying this framework reveals that systems with smaller truncation radii tend to reaccrete a larger fraction of their angular momentum during dissipation, thereby inhibiting the stars ability to regulate its surface rotation. Modification of this rate may alter the star's mass-injection duty cycle or long-term evolutionary track. Finally, a subset of the simulations were post-processed using the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code \texttt{HDUST}, generating synthetic observables including H$\alpha$ line profiles, V-band polarization, and UV polarization. Suggestions for observational verification of the dynamical results are demonstrated using the simulated data.
#### Early galaxy evolution: The complex interstellar medium distribution of the z~7 galaxy A1689-zD1

 - **Abstract**
 We observed the gravitationally lensed ($\mu = 9.6\pm0.19$) galaxy A1689-zD1 at $z = 7.1$ in bands 3, 6, and 8 of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. These high-resolution observations ($\approx 200$ pc) enabled us to separate the source into five components in the [CII] 158$\mu$m and [OIII] 88$mu$m emission lines within a projected distance of 2 kpc. Even though these components appear to vary strongly from one another in both their line, continuum, and optical characteristics, the assembly of components do not show ordered rotation and appear consistent with simulations of a galaxy system undergoing the process of assembly. The total dynamical mass of the galaxy ($2\times10^{10}$ M$_\odot$) is an order of magnitude larger than the spectrally estimated stellar mass, suggesting a near-complete optical obscuration of the bulk of the stellar component. Comparing the line ratios as well as the line properties to other properties such as the star formation rate, we find that A1689-zD1 is consistent with the relations derived from local star-forming galaxies. Even though A1689-zD1 lies on local star formation scaling relations and has a high dust and stellar mass estimate, the kinematics suggest it is in an early assembly stage, which could lead to it becoming a disk galaxy at a later stage.
#### The evolution of velocity dispersion in the Sco-Cen OB association

 - **Abstract**
 We study how stellar velocity dispersion within the Scorpius-Centaurus OB association (Sco-Cen) has evolved over approximately 20 million years, from its formation to the present day. Using data from the \textit{Gaia} mission along with supplementary stellar radial velocities, we identified a surprising sequence of abrupt jumps and intervening plateaus in the velocity dispersion correlating with star formation bursts. These changes in velocity dispersion coincide with the association expanding in size. We measure a present-day expansion rate of about 10--12\,pc\,Myr$^{-1}$ and observe that younger star clusters within the association exhibit higher velocities compared to older ones. This result, along with the stepwise increase in both velocity dispersion and spatial extent over time, suggests a structured and sequential star formation process rather than a random one. This phased evolution strongly suggests that stellar feedback is the primary driver of Sco-Cen's star formation history, expansion, and eventual dispersal. Our findings emphasize the value of precisely characterizing stellar populations within OB associations, particularly through the creation of detailed, high-resolution age maps.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.19494

 - **Abstract**
 Type Ia supernovae (SNe~Ia) are central to studies of cosmic expansion, under the assumption that their absolute magnitude $M_B$ does not evolve with redshift. Even small drifts in brightness can bias cosmological parameters such as $H_0$ and $w$. Here we test this assumption using a non-parametric Gaussian Process (GP) reconstruction of the expansion history from cosmic chronometer $H(z)$ data, which provides a model-independent baseline distance modulus, $\mu_{\rm GP}(z)$. To propagate uncertainties, we draw Monte Carlo realizations of $H(z)$ from the GP posterior and evaluate them on a Chebyshev grid, which improves numerical stability and quadrature accuracy. Supernova observations are then compared to this baseline through residuals, $\Delta M_B(z)$, and their derivatives. Applying this method to Pantheon+ (1701 SNe~Ia) and DES 5YR (435 SNe~Ia), we find that SNe~Ia are consistent with being standard candles within $1\sigma$, though both datasets exhibit localized departures: near $z \sim 1$ in Pantheon+ and at $z \sim 0.3$--$0.5$ in DES. The presence of similar features in two independent surveys suggests they are not purely statistical. Our results point toward a possible non-monotonic luminosity evolution, likely reflecting different physical drivers at different epochs, and highlight the need for a deeper astrophysical understanding of SN~Ia populations.

 - **Abstract**
 Baryonic feedback is a leading contaminant in studying dark matter and cosmology using cosmic shear. This has meant omitting much of the data during cosmological inference, or forward-modeling the spatial distribution of gas around dark matter halos using analytical or hydrodynamical models for baryonic feedback, which introduces nuisance parameters and model dependence. We propose a novel method of ``baryon nulling'' using cross-correlations between shear maps and fast radio burst (FRB) dispersion measures. By directly subtracting the dark matter--dispersion measure cross-correlation, the sensitivity of our nulled power spectra to feedback effects can be significantly reduced without any explicit feedback modeling. Using the FLAMINGO suite of hydrodynamic simulations, whose power spectra span a wide yet realistic range of feedback variations, we demonstrate that our method reduces sensitivity to feedback modeling at $k \approx 1$ Mpc$^{-1}$ by about an order of magnitude. This points toward a strong synergy between the next generation of sensitive FRB surveys such as CHORD and the DSA-2000, and cosmic shear surveys such as Rubin, Euclid, and Roman.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent Parker Solar Probe measurements have revealed that solar wind (SW) turbulence transits from a subsonic to a transonic regime near the Sun, while remaining sub-Alfvénic. These observations call for a revision of existing SW models, where turbulence is considered to be both subsonic and sub-Alfvénic. In this Letter, we introduce a new magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model of Transonic sub-Alfvénic Turbulence (TsAT). Our model shows that turbulence is effectively nearly-incompressible (NI) and has a 2D + slab geometry not only in the subsonic limit, but also in the transonic regime, as long as it remains sub-Alfvénic, a condition essentially enforced everywhere in the heliosphere by the strong local magnetic field. These predictions are consistent with 3D MHD simulations, showing that transonic turbulence is dominated by low frequency quasi-2D incompressible structures, while compressible fluctuations are a minor component corresponding to low frequency slow modes and high frequency fast modes. Our new TsAT model extends existing NI theories of turbulence, and is potentially relevant for the theoretical and numerical modeling of space and astrophysical plasmas, including the near-Sun SW, the solar corona, and the interstellar medium.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a structural analysis of bulges in dual active galactic nuclei (AGN) host galaxies. Dual AGN arise in galaxy mergers where both supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are actively accreting. The AGN are typically embedded in compact bulges, which appear as luminous nuclei in optical images. Galaxy mergers can result in bulge growth, often via star formation. The bulges can be disky (pseudobulges), classical bulges, or belong to elliptical galaxies. Using SDSS DR18 gri images and GALFIT modelling, we performed 2D decomposition for 131 dual AGN bulges (comprising 61 galaxy pairs and 3 galaxy triplets) identified in the GOTHIC survey. We derived sérsic indices, luminosities, masses, and scalelengths of the bulges. Most bulges (105/131) are classical, with sérsic indices lying between $n=2$ and $n=8$. Among these, 64% are elliptical galaxies, while the remainder are classical bulges in disc galaxies. Only $\sim$20% of the sample exhibit pseudobulges. Bulge masses span $1.5\times10^9$ to $1.4\times10^{12}\,M_\odot$, with the most massive systems being ellipticals. Galaxy type matching shows that elliptical--elliptical (E--E) and elliptical--disc (E--D) mergers dominate over disc--disc (D--D) mergers. At least one galaxy in two-thirds of the dual AGN systems is elliptical and only $\sim$30% involve two disc galaxies. Although our sample is limited, our results suggest that dual AGN preferentially occur in evolved, red, quenched systems, that typically form via major mergers. They are predominantly hosted in classical bulges or elliptical galaxies rather than star-forming disc galaxies.
#### SDSS-V Black Hole Mapper: The Index Diagram as a tool to disentangle the influence of the Host Galaxy in Quasar spectra

 - **Abstract**
 We revisit the Quasar Main Sequence (QMS) by investigating the impact of the stellar component from the host galaxy (HG) on the emission line spectra of the active galactic nuclei (AGN). We first detect spectra with broad emission lines using a line ratio method for a sample of $\sim$3000 high SNR ($>$20) Black Hole Mapper objects (part of the fifth phase of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey). We then built the Index diagram, a novel diagnostic tool using the $z$-corrected spectra, model-free, designed to easily identify spectra with significant stellar HG contributions and to classify the AGN spectra into three categories based on AGN-HG dominance: HG-dominated (HGD), Intermediate (INT), and AGN-dominated (AGND) sources. A colour-$z$ diagram was used to refine the AGN-HG classification. We subtract the stellar contributions from the HGD and INT spectra before modeling the AGN spectrum to extract the QMS parameters. Our QMS reveals that HGD galaxies predominantly occupy the Population B region with no \rfe, %FWHM$\gtrsim$4000 \kms, with outliers exhibiting \rfe\ $>$ 1, likely due to HG subtraction residuals and a faint contribution of \hbbc. INT and AGND spectra show similar distributions in the Population A %FWHM(\hbbc)$<$4000 \kms\ region, while in Population B, %For broader lines, a tail of AGND sources becomes apparent. Cross-matching with radio, infrared, and X-ray catalogs, we find that the strongest radio emitters are associated with HGD and INT groups. Strong X-ray emitters are found in INT and AGND sources, also occupying the AGN region in the WISE colour diagram.

 - **Abstract**
 The multi-cycle JWST Treasury program NEXUS will obtain cadenced imaging and spectroscopic observations around the North Ecliptic Pole during 2024-2028. Here we report a systematic search for nuclear variability among $\sim 25\,$k sources covered by NIRCam (F200W+F444W) imaging using the first two NEXUS epochs separated by 9 months in the observed frame. Difference imaging techniques reach $1\sigma$ variability sensitivity of 0.18~mag (F200W) and 0.15~mag (F444W) at 28th magnitude (within 0".2 diameter aperture), improved to $0.01$~mag and $0.02$~mag at $<25$th magnitude, demonstrating the superb performance of NIRCam photometry. The difference imaging results represent significant improvement over aperture photometry on individual epochs (by $>30\%$). We identify 465 high-confidence variable sources among the parent sample, with 2-epoch flux difference at $>3\sigma$ from the fiducial variability sensitivity. Essentially all these variable sources are of extragalactic origin based on preliminary photometric classifications, and follow a similar photometric redshift distribution as the parent sample up to $z_{\rm phot}>10$. While the majority of these variability candidates are likely normal unobscured AGNs, some of them may be rare nuclear stellar transients and tidal disruption events that await confirmation with spectroscopy and continued photometric monitoring. We also constrain the photometric variability of ten spectroscopically confirmed broad-line Little Red Dots (LRDs) at $3\lesssim z \lesssim 7$, and find none of them show detectable variability in either band. We derive stringent $3\sigma$ upper limits on the F444W variability of $\sim 3-10\%$ for these LRDs, with a median value of $\sim 5\%$. These constraints imply weak variability in the rest-frame optical continuum of LRDs.

 - **Abstract**
 Oscillatory reconnection is a dynamic, magnetic relaxation mechanism in which a perturbed null point reverts back to equilibrium via time-dependent reconnection. In this paper, we investigate the long-term periodic signal generated by a three-dimensional (3D) magnetic null point, when it is perturbed by a non-periodic driver, for a variety of driving amplitudes. We solve the 3D nonlinear magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations using a bespoke numerical boundary condition (a sponge region) that damps wave reflections and thus allows the long-term periodic signal at the 3D null point to be investigated. We observe multiple cycles of the 3D oscillatory reconnection mechanism for the first time. We find that the periodicity is both constant and independent of the choice of driving amplitude. Furthermore, the resultant time-dependent current density at the null point normalized by the driving amplitude is invariant. We extract a single period for oscillatory reconnection at a 3D null point, opening the future possibility of using this characteristic period as a diagnostic tool to reveal indirectly the fundamental plasma properties of 3D null points.

 - **Abstract**
 Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks are an important part of the global communication infrastructure today. Despite ongoing efforts to improve their resilience, they remain vulnerable to component damage and deorbiting under harsh space weather conditions. Prior work identified a modest but noticeable impact on LEO satellite network performance during solar storms, typically manifesting as an immediate rise in packet loss and a sustained increase in round-trip time (RTT). However, these studies offer only coarse-grained insights and do not capture the nuanced spatial and temporal patterns of disruption across the LEO network. In this paper, we conduct a deep dive into the impact of solar storms on LEO satellite communications. By localizing the impact of increased atmospheric drag at the level of individual satellites and orbits, we reveal significant heterogeneity in how different parts of the network are affected. We find that the degree of performance degradation varies significantly across geographic regions, depending on satellite positioning during the storm. Specifically, we find that (i) not all satellite orbits are equally vulnerable, (ii) within a given orbit, certain satellites experience disproportionate impact depending on their position relative to geomagnetic conditions, and (iii) autonomous maneuvering of satellites might be a cause of the sustained increase in RTT. Our findings uncover previously overlooked patterns of vulnerability in LEO satellite constellations and highlight the need for more adaptive, region-aware mitigation strategies to address space weather-induced network disruptions.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding how active galactic nuclei (AGN) affect their host galaxies requires determining their total radiative power across all wavelengths (i.e., bolometric luminosities). We show how AGN accretion disk spectral energy distribution (SED) templates, parameterized by supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass, Eddington ratio, spin, and inclination, can be used to estimate total radiated luminosities. Bolometric luminosities are calculated by integrating the accretion disk SEDs from 1$\mu$m to 10keV over $0^\circ$--$90^\circ$ inclinations, ensuring consistent treatment of wavelength gaps, avoiding double-counting reprocessed emission, and accounting for anisotropy of visible--UV emission at different inclinations. The SED, and resulting bolometric corrections, depend strongly on SMBH mass and Eddington ratio, but only weakly on spin and inclination. Increasing SMBH mass produces cooler disks peaking at lower frequencies, whereas higher Eddington ratios (and spins) yield hotter disks peaking at higher frequencies. Larger inclinations suppress the visible--UV portion of the SED, whereas X-ray emission remains nearly isotropic. Bolometric corrections in the visible--NUV range (5100Å-3000Å) show strong dependence on SMBH mass, while X-ray bolometric corrections depend strongly on the Eddington ratio. Near the SED peak (FUV; $\sim$1450Å), parameter dependencies are weak, making this band particularly robust for estimating bolometric corrections. The X-ray band is reliable, though dependence on the Eddington ratio introduces a wide dynamic range. Because our SEDs are intrinsic and defined in the rest-frame, their application to Type 1 AGN is straightforward. For other AGN, however, corrections for obscuration by the host galaxy and torus are required in many cases.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar prominences (or filaments) are cooler and denser plasma suspended in the much hotter and rarefied solar corona. When viewed on the solar disc filament barbs or feet protrude laterally from filament spine. When observed at the limb of the Sun, they reach into the chromosphere or even further down. For a long time, the magnetic field orientation of barbs has remained a mystery due to the paradox that the barbs possess vertical fine structures and flows but are likely to be supported in a horizontal magnetic field. Here we present unambiguous observations of a magnetic dip in a quiescent prominence foot with an upward-curved field. That is indicated by the horizontal bidirectional outflows probably produced by magnetic reconnection between the fields of a tiny erupting filament and those in a prominence foot. The altitude at the bottom of the dip is about 30 Mm. At the edge of the prominence foot, the angle between the dip field and the local horizontal is about 4 degrees. Additionally, the curvature radius of the dip bottom is estimated to be around 73 Mm. We also conduct magnetofrictional simulation to self-consistently form a large-scale magnetic flux rope with magnetic dips resembling the spine and feet of the quiescent prominence. The observations shed light on the field structure of prominences which is crucial for the instability that accounts for the eruption of prominences and coronal mass ejections.

 - **Abstract**
 Using the polar vector magnetic field data observed by Hinode from 2012 to 2021, we study the long-term variations of the magnetic flux, the flux proportion of different polarities, and the magnetic inclination with respect to the local normal in the solar polar regions above 70 degree latitude during solar cycle 24. In both polar regions after the polarity reversal, the unsigned magnetic fluxes of the dominant polarity increased to a peak of about 1.3$\times$10$^{22}$ Mx during the solar minimum, while those of the non-dominant polarity remained stable at approximately 0.5$\times$10$^{22}$ Mx. The proportions of the dominant polarity flux in the total flux in both polar regions increased to more than 70% at the solar minimum. These results reveal that the total magnetic flux and the number of open field lines in solar cycle 24 were larger than those in solar cycle 23, and also imply the existence of a local dynamo in polar regions. After the polarity reversal, the magnetic inclination of the dominant polarity fields decreased, indicating that the stronger the dominant polarity field, the more vertical the field lines. The inclination angle decreased with the increase of the threshold of radial magnetic flux density, revealing a fanning-out structure of the polar magnetic patches.

 - **Abstract**
 In August 2025 a workshop was convened to bring together experts to better understand steps that can be taken to mitigate the impact of satellite constellations on astronomical observations. At the time, just over 12,000 operational satellites were in low-Earth orbit (LEO). Although reflected sunlight and emissions all across the electromagnetic spectrum from artificial satellites impact scientific observations and the sky, the workshop focused on reflected sunlight in the wavelength range 330 nm to 1100 nm. This aligns with the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) planned imaging observations over the coming decade. Among other conclusions, we affirm previous recommendations that tracked satellite apparent magnitudes should be no brighter than 7th AB mag. The workshop participants discussed over 30 publications, reports, and presentations, and arrived at the Findings and Recommendations presented here. During the workshop, in addition to affirming many existing recommendations and best practices, the group discovered new issues and devised possible mitigations. These were nearly equally divided between advice to satellite builders and operators and to the observational astronomy community. While the workshop prioritized considerations for LSST, our hope is that many of the Findings and Recommendations will also apply to other observatories and constellations, and that all satellite companies will continue to engage in dialog with sky observers across the globe.

 - **Abstract**
 The accretion-induced collapse (AIC) of a rotating white dwarf (WD) offers a potential site of millisecond pulsars/magnetars, gamma-ray bursts, and r-process nucleosynthesis. We present three-dimensional general-relativistic magneto-hydrodynamical simulations including neutrinos of magnetorotational AIC, assuming the WD is rapidly spinning with a weak magnetic field confined below its surface (likely a prerequisite for rapid rotation). Within milliseconds after core bounce, the magnetic field is exponentially amplified near the surface of the proto-neutron star (PNS). We witness the emergence of a small-scale turbulent and mean-field, large-scale MRI-driven dynamo in the neutrino-cooled centrifugally supported disk formed around the PNS, which generates bundles of large-scale toroidal field with alternating polarity. The amplified field becomes buoyant and is advected above the PNS, generating a magnetic tower that drives a mildly relativistic striped jet. The jet breaks out of the WD, clearing the way for a powerful magnetized neutron-rich wind from the disk. Although our simulation cannot follow the long-term Kelvin-Helmholtz cooling phase of the PNS, the conditions are ripe for the formation of a GRB powered by magnetar spin-down. A similar dynamo may operate in magnetorotational core-collapse supernovae and neutron-star mergers.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the "DARKSKIES" suite of one hundred, zoom-in hydrodynamic simulations of massive ($M_{200}>5\times10^{14}{\rm M}_\odot)$ galaxy clusters with self-interacting dark matter (SIDM). We super-sample the simulations such that $m_{\rm DM}/m_{\rm gas}\sim0.1$, enabling us to simulate a dark matter particle mass of $m=0.68\times10^{8}M_\odot$ an order of magnitude faster, whilst exploring SIDM in the core of clusters at extremely high resolution. We calibrate the baryonic feedback to produce observationally consistent and realistic galaxy clusters across all simulations and simulate five models of velocity-independent SIDM targeting the expected sensitivity of future telescopes - $\sigma_{\rm DM}/m=0.,0.01,0.05,0.1,0.2$ cm$^2$/g. We find the density profiles exhibit the characteristic core even in the smallest of cross-sections, with cores developing only at late times ($z<0.5$). We investigate the dynamics of the brightest cluster galaxy inside the dark matter halo and find in SIDM cosmologies there exists a so-called wobbling not observed in collisionless dark matter. We find this wobble is driven by accreting mass on to a cored density profile with the signal peaking at $z=0.25$ and dropping thereafter. This finding is further supported by the existence of an anti-correlation between the offset between the BCG and the dark matter halo and its relative velocity in SIDM only, a hallmark of harmonic oscillation.

 - **Abstract**
 Atmospheric gravity waves (AGWs) are buoyancy-driven waves excited by turbulent convection and contribute to the dynamics and energy transport of the lower solar atmosphere. We present high-resolution, multi-wavelength observations from the Interferometric Bidimensional Spectrometer and the Solar Dynamics Observatory to investigate AGW behavior across different viewing geometries and magnetic field configurations. Using Fourier spectral analysis to compute phase differences and coherence spectra, we detect the signature of propagating AGWs carrying energy upwards at temporal and spatial scales consistent with theory, simulations, and prior observations. Although AGW behavior is modulated by the magnetic field configuration, particularly the field inclination, these effects are not highly discernible in our observed $k_{\rm{h}}-\nu$ phase difference diagrams. After filtering to isolate the AGW regime, we compute spatial coherence-weighted phase difference maps and examine binned coherence-weighted phase differences as functions of the field strength and inclination. Our results show that AGWs are efficiently suppressed and/or reflected in intermediate to strong, vertically oriented fields in the upper photosphere, while they propagate rather freely in QS and transverse fields. These findings agree with a simulated vertical 100 G field using CO$^{5}$BOLD. Simulated $k_{\rm{h}}-\nu$ phase differences derived from a 3D magnetohydrodynamic dispersion relation also qualitatively agree with our upper photospheric IBIS diagnostics and reinforce that the magnetic field configuration modulates the propagation of AGWs. This work demonstrates the potential of AGWs as magneto-seismology diagnostics for probing average magnetic field properties in the lower solar atmosphere.

 - **Abstract**
 This work examines the relationship between solar eruptivity and the relative helicity that is contained around the polarity inversion line (PIL) of the magnetic field, along with its current-carrying component. To this end, we analyze the evolution of the PIL helicities in a sample of $\sim 40$ solar active regions which exhibited more than 200 flares of class M or higher. The computation of the PIL helicities is accomplished with the help of relative field line helicity, the recently-developed proxy for the density of relative helicity, following the extrapolation of the 3D coronal magnetic field with a nonlinear force-free method. We find that, on average, the relative helicity of the PIL decreases significantly, by more than $10\%$, during stronger eruptive flares (M5.0 class and above), while smaller changes are observed for confined and/or weaker flares. The PIL current-carrying helicity shows higher-magnitude decreases in both strong and weak flares, reaching $20\%$ average changes during the stronger eruptive flares. Notably, the PIL current-carrying helicity displays the most pronounced distinction between eruptive and confined flares, indicating its strong potential as a diagnostic of solar eruptivity. We discuss the implications of these findings for solar flare forecasting.
#### Calibration-independent consistency test of DESI DR2 BAO and SNIa

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the consistency between DESI DR2 BAO and three SNIa datasets, Pantheon+, Union3, and DES-Y5. Our consistency test is {calibration}-independent since it is independent of cosmological nuisance parameters such as the absolute peak magnitude $M_B$ and the comoving sound horizon at the baryon drag epoch $r_d$. {This could reduce some systematics in the observed data, if present}. Importantly, the test is also model-agnostic, independent of any model of dark energy or modified gravity. We define a tension parameter to quantify tension across different datasets compared to DESI DR2 BAO. The Pantheon+ and Union3 data have tension $\lesssim\! 1\sigma$ across their redshift ranges, whereas the DES-Y5 tension is $\gtrsim3\sigma$ near $z=1$. This hints that DES-Y5 data has significant offset values for redshifts close to 1, compared to the other SNIa datasets. Since this consistency test is independent of cosmological nuisance parameters, the tension is minimal: other consistency tests involving differences in nuisance parameters may show greater tension.

 - **Abstract**
 In this contribution, we present the status and first data from the Radio Detector (RD) at the Pierre Auger Observatory, consisting of $1660$ radio antennas deployed across the $3000$ km$^2$ surface detector array. These antennas measure the radio emission from extensive air showers in the $30-80$ MHz band, enabling electromagnetic energy measurements for air showers with zenith angles above $65°$. Combined with the muonic measurements from the water-Cherenkov detectors (WCDs), this allows mass composition studies at the highest energies. The large-scale deployment of the RD began in November 2023 and was completed in November 2024. A full end-to-end calibration shows consistency between Galactic and in-lab calibration to better than $5$\% and includes continuous monitoring for hardware failures, ensuring, for example, antenna alignment within $5°$. We present the first data, demonstrating a strong correlation between the electromagnetic energy measured by the RD and the total shower energy measured by the WCD, confirming that the detector chain - including triggering, data readout, absolute calibration, and reconstruction is well understood. We highlight a particularly impressive $32$ EeV shower at a zenith angle of $85°$, producing a $50$ km-long radio footprint, showcasing the unique capabilities of this detector.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar eruptions may occur at different evolutionary stages of active regions, during which the photospheric motions manifest in various forms, including flux emergence, sunspot rotation, shearing, converging, and magnetic flux diffusion. However, it remains unclear what are the specific roles played by these different motions in leading to eruptions. Here, we employ high resolution magnetohydrodynamic simulations to demonstrate how solar eruptions can be initiated in a single bipolar configuration, driven by first shearing and then flux diffusion at the bottom surface. Flux diffusion disperses the photospheric magnetic flux, driving portions of it toward the polarity inversion line (PIL). This process leads to the expansion of core field, enhancing the pinching effect to form the current sheet. When magnetic reconnection occurs within this current sheet, the eruption is initiated, characterized by a rapid release of magnetic energy and accompanied by the formation of a erupting flux rope. Additionally, flux diffusion contributes to magnetic cancellation near the PIL, leading to the formation of a weakly twisted magnetic flux rope prior to the eruption. However, this pre-exist flux rope plays a limited role in eruption initiation, as its spatial position remains largely unchanged throughout the eruption. These findings demonstrate that the primary role of flux diffusion is to facilitate current sheet formation, highlighting the critical role of current sheet formation in eruption initiation.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: The chemical abundances of alpha-elements in Galactic Centre (GC) supergiants provide key insights into the chemical enrichment and star formation history of the Milky Way's Nuclear Star Cluster. Previous studies have reported enhanced alpha-element abundances, raising questions about the chemical evolution of this unique region. Aims: We aim to reassess the alpha-element abundances in the GC supergiant GCIRS 22 using updated spectral modelling and non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) corrections to resolve discrepancies from earlier abundance analyses. Methods: High-resolution near-infrared spectra of GCIRS 22 were analysed using contemporary line lists and precise stellar parameters derived from scandium line diagnostics. We applied comprehensive NLTE corrections to accurately determine the abundances of silicon and calcium. Results: Our analysis reveals solar-scale alpha abundances ([Ca/Fe] = 0.06 $\pm$ 0.07; [Si/Fe] = $-$0.08 $\pm$ 0.20) for GCIRS 22, significantly lower than previous LTE-based findings. NLTE corrections reduce the calcium abundance by approximately 0.3,dex compared to LTE estimates, aligning our results with recent studies and highlighting the importance of accurate NLTE modelling. Conclusions: The solar-scale alpha-element abundances observed in GCIRS 22 suggest that recent star formation in the region has not been dominated by Type II supernovae, such as those expected from a recent starburst. Our findings support a scenario of episodic star formation, characterized by intermittent bursts separated by extended quiescent phases, or potentially driven by gas inflows from the inner disk, funnelled by the Galactic bar. Future comprehensive NLTE studies of additional GC stars will be essential for refining our understanding of the region's chemical evolution and star formation history.

 - **Abstract**
 Classical low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies pose an important challenge to galaxy evolution models. While they are found to host large reservoirs of atomic hydrogen, they display low stellar and star-formation surface densities. Global star formation scaling relations characterize trends in the star formation behaviour of galaxies; when used to compare populations or classes of galaxies, deviations in the observed trends can be used to probe predicted differences in physical conditions. In this work we utilize the well-studied Star Forming Main Sequence and integrated Kennicutt-Schmidt Relations to characterize star formation in the LSB regime, and compare the observed trends to relations for a normal star-forming galaxies. Using a comprehensive cross-matched sample of 277 LSB galaxies from the GALEX-SDSS-WISE Legacy Catalog Release 2 and the Arecibo Legacy Fast Arecibo L-band Feed Array Catalog, we gain an in-depth view of the star formation process in the LSB regime. HI-selected LSB galaxies follow very similar trends in atomic gas-to-stellar mass ratio and the star forming main sequence to their high surface brightness counterparts. However, while LSB galaxies host comparably large atomic gas reservoirs, they prove to be largely inefficient in converting this gas to stars with a median depletion time $t_{dep} \approx 18$ Gyr. These results are discussed in relation to previous studies which find that LSB galaxies host low atomic gas densities and are largely deficient in molecular gas, which suggest that the faint appearance of LSB galaxies may be the result of physical conditions on the sub-kpc scale.

 - **Abstract**
 Residual energy quantifies the difference in energy between velocity and magnetic field fluctuations in a plasma. Recent observational evidence highlights that fast-mode interplanetary shock waves have positive residual energy, in sharp contrast to the negative residual energy of the turbulence and magnetic structures that constitute the vast majority of fluctuation power in the solar wind at magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) inertial scales. In this work, we apply the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions to derive an equation for the residual energy of an MHD shock jump as a function of the shock angle, density compression ratio and Alfvén Mach number upstream of the shock. An equation for the cross helicity is similarly derived. The residual energy equation gives only positive values for super-Alfvénic (i.e. fast-mode) shocks. The residual energy and cross helicity of slow-mode shocks and tangential, contact and rotational discontinuities are also determined. A simplified form of the residual energy equation applicable to perpendicular shocks has been verified against residual energy values directly estimated from observations of 141 interplanetary shocks; the equation is found to match well with observations, particularly for shocks with higher density compression ratios and Mach numbers. The use of positive residual energy as a signature for fast-mode shock identification in spacecraft data is briefly considered, and insights from this work relating to compressive fluctuations more generally in the solar wind are discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Ionized outflows in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are thought to influence the evolution of their host galaxies and super-massive black holes (SMBHs). Distance is important to understand the kinetic power of the outflows as a cosmic feedback channel. However, the distance of the outflows with respect to the central engine is poorly constrained. The density of the outflows is an essential parameter for estimating the distance of the outflows. NGC 5548 exhibits a variety of spectroscopic features in its archival spectra, which can be used for density analysis. Aims. We aim to use the variability of the absorption lines from the archival spectra to obtain a density constraint and then estimate the distance of the outflows. Methods. We used the archival observations of NGC 5548 taken with Chandra in January 2002 to search for variations of the absorption lines. Results. We found that the Mg XII Ly${\alpha}$ and the O VIII Ly${\beta}$ absorption lines have significant variation on the 144 ks time scale and the 162 ks time scale during the different observation periods. Based on the variability timescales and the physical properties of the variable components that dominated these two absorption lines, we derive a lower limit on the density of the variable warm absorber components in the range of $7.2-9.0{\times}10^{11} m^{-3}$, and an upper limit on their distance from the central source in the range of 0.2-0.5 pc.

 This chapter provides an overview of the magnetic activity of the Sun and stars, discussing its underlying physical origin, manifestations, and fundamental role in exoplanet studies. It begins with a summary of the Sun's magnetic activity from the surface towards the outer atmospheric layers, highlighting features such as sunspots, faculae, chromospheric structures, and their temporal modulation known as the activity cycle. These phenomena are sustained throughout the lifetime of the Sun by the magnetic dynamo, which is driven by differential rotation and convective flows. Furthermore, extending these concepts to other stars, the chapter examines the diagnostics that are typically employed to track and quantify the magnetic activity level of stars, and it reviews spectropolarimetry, an observational technique with which to characterise stellar magnetic fields. We finally outline results from both observations and theoretical modelling of stellar activity across distinct spectral types, and we describe the variety of methods used to search for stellar activity cycles, underscoring the multi-wavelength nature of this field of research.

 - **Abstract**
 Hydrogen recombination lines are key diagnostics of ionized gas in the interstellar medium (ISM), particularly within photoionized nebulae. Hydrodynamical simulations, even those that include radiative transfer, do not usually determine the level population of hydrogen required to compute line intensities, but rather interpolate them from pre-computed tables. Here we present the HyLight atomic model, which captures the dominant processes governing the level populations, enabling the calculation of all dipole-allowed hydrogen transitions as well as two-photon transitions from the 2s to 1s state without the need to pre-computed tables. We compare HyLight predictions to those of other codes and published tables, finding differences between the various rates of up to factors of several per cent for common transitions, including those of the Balmer and Brackett series. However, we find sub-per cent agreement between HyLight and the Cloudy spectral synthesis code when enforcing photo-ionisation equilibrium in gas under typical nebular conditions of density and temperature. Importantly, HyLight can also predict emissivities if the gas is not in photo-ionisation equilibrium. As examples, we compute the ratios between the total photoionization rate and line intensities in a nebula, and post-process a snapshot from Sparcs, a hydrodynamical code that combines radiative transfer with non-equilibrium physics, and compute mock hydrogen emission line maps which can be compared directly to observations. Implemented in Python, HyLight is an accurate tool for determining the level population in neutral hydrogen, a crucial step in bridging the gap between simulations and observations in studies of photoionized regions in galaxies.
