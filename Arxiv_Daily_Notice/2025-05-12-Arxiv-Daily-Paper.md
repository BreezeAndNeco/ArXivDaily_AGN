 - **Abstract**
 The highest priority Planetary Flagship from the Planetary Science and Astrobiology Decadal Survey is the Uranus Orbiter and Probe. This mission enables broad, cross-disciplinary science of an ice giant system, including the planet, moons, rings, and magnetosphere. The ice giants represent a size class of planet that is largely unexplored but that is common among extrasolar planet systems. At the same time, Uranus is unique, possessing a regular satellite system, rings, and a complex magnetosphere surrounding a planet tilted over for extreme seasonal variation. Exploration of the Uranian system is guided by a broad suite of science Objectives and through remote sensing, in situ probe, and fields and particles experiments. Due to the rapid nature of the Decadal concept study, the orbital tour could not be perfectly optimized, but a best effort was made to include orbit insertion, probe release and relay, and multiple satellite flybys; some Objectives were necessarily better met than others by this tour. The mission's tour trajectory can be optimized to meet any of the Decadal Science Objectives, by focusing on a particular system target, for example magnetosphere, satellites, or planet interior, but the best tour will simultaneously meet the highest priority measurements for every Objective. The community-led (with no institutional or NASA sponsorship) poll described here was designed to collect broad science inputs on the tour parameters required for each Decadal Science Objective. Here we present results aggregated by Objective, as well as compared longitudinally, of the highest priority tour needs identified across all Objectives. Both the raw and aggregated data are made publicly available for future white papers, tour and trajectory work, as well as mission and instrument design teams, but the results are not binding nor decisional in any way.

 - **Abstract**
 Star formation in galaxies is inherently complex, involving the interplay of physical processes over a hierarchy of spatial scales. In this work, we investigate the connection between global (galaxy-scale) and local (cloud-scale) star formation efficiencies (SFEs) at high redshifts ($z\gtrsim 3$), using the state-of-the-art cosmological zoom-in simulation suite THESAN-ZOOM. We find that the galaxy-scale average SFE, $\langle \epsilon^{\rm gal}_{\rm ff} \rangle$, scales with $M_{\rm halo}^{1/3}\,(1+z)^{1/2} \sim V_{\rm vir}$, consistent with expectations from feedback-regulated models. On cloud scales, we identify giant molecular clouds (GMCs) in a broad sample of high-redshift starbursts spanning a wide range of halo masses and redshifts. Star formation in these systems is predominantly hosted by filamentary GMCs embedded in a dense and highly turbulent interstellar medium (ISM). GMCs exhibit remarkably universal properties, including mass function, size, turbulence, and surface density, regardless of the environment in which they are identified. The global gas depletion time (and the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation) is determined by the GMC mass fraction in the ISM, while the cloud-scale SFE shows little variation. In particular, we find a nearly constant gas surface density of $\Sigma_{\rm GMC} \approx 70\,{\rm M}_{\odot}\,{\rm pc}^{-2}$ across different host galaxies. Nevertheless, we identify two regimes where phases with high SFE can arise. First, stars may form efficiently in the shock fronts generated by feedback from a preceding starburst. Second, the increasing background dark matter surface density with redshift may contribute to the gravitational potential of clouds at $z \gtrsim 8$ and confine them in high-SFE phases over extended periods.
#### The Multiple Paths to Merger of Unequal-Mass Black Hole Binaries in the Disks of Active Galactic Nuclei

 - **Abstract**
 The accretion disks that power active galactic nuclei (AGN) are thought to house populations of stars and compact objects; after forming binaries these compact objects may merge, begetting gravitational waves such as those detected by LIGO and VIRGO. We present a comprehensive study of the early evolution of binaries within AGN disks as their orbits are influenced by the surrounding gas, focusing on eccentric and unequal-mass binaries. Nearly-equal-mass binaries behave similarly to their equal-mass counterparts: prograde binaries inspiral, albeit somewhat slowly, and have their eccentricities damped; retrograde binaries inspiral $\sim2-3$ times faster than their prograde counterparts, and those with near-equal masses are driven quickly towards near-unity eccentricities. However, the primaries in retrograde binaries with mass ratios of $m_2/m_1\lesssim0.4$ experience significantly weaker headwinds and retain substantial accretion disks that help damp binary eccentricities, slowing binary inspirals. Additionally, we find that while accretion drives prograde binaries towards equal masses thanks to the exchange of material between the primary and secondary accretion disks, retrograde binaries are driven slowly towards more extreme mass ratios. Prograde binaries, and generally those with low mass ratios, likely accrete for multiple $e$-folding timescales before merger. On the other hand, high-mass-ratio retrograde binaries may merge before accreting substantially, potentially approaching merger with detectable eccentricity. Future ground-based gravitational wave observatories, with their broader frequency coverage, should be particularly useful for studying these populations.
#### Super-Eddington accretion in high-redshift quasar hosts: black-hole driven outflows, galaxy quenching, and the nature of Little Red Dots

 - **Abstract**
 The advent of the James Webb Space Telescope has revolutionised our understanding of the high-redshift Universe, detecting bright, massive galaxies up to $z\gtrsim 10$, and identifying peculiar sources called "Little Red Dots" (LRDs). The origin of both classes of objects remains uncertain but is likely linked to the formation and early growth of the first massive black holes (MBHs), which may be more easily explained by invoking phases of super-Eddington accretion. In this study, we use a state-of-the-art zoom-in cosmological simulation of a quasar host to investigate whether these objects, during their assembly, can resemble any of the peculiar sources observed with JWST. We find that the impact of MBH feedback on star formation is typically moderate, with outflows preferentially escaping perpendicular to the galactic disc. However, for approximately ten percent of the galaxy's lifetime, the system enters a distinct quenched phase, after a rapid MBH growth driven by super-Eddington accretion. This phase culminates in a powerful feedback event, during which the MBH jet and disc-driven winds interact directly with the galactic disc, carving out a central cavity. We also find that, during the history of the quasar host progenitor, the spectral properties of the system can resemble both LRDs and quenched galaxies, depending on the specific evolutionary stage considered. These findings suggest that both conditions may represent transient phases in the life cycle of high-redshift galaxies.
#### Wobbling around the clock: magnetically-driven quasi-periodic oscillations in pulsating ultraluminous X-ray sources

 - **Abstract**
 Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) are X-ray binary systems containing an accreting neutron star (NS) or black hole emitting at luminosities above the Eddington limit of a $10M_{\odot}$ black hole. Approximately 1900 (either confirmed or candidate) ULXs have been identified to date. Three systems have been confirmed to exhibit coherent signals consistent with NS spin frequencies and quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in the mHz range. Several interpretations for generating such QPOs have been proposed, including general relativistic frame-dragging effects. In this work, we test if an alternative model in which magnetically-driven precession of the inner accretion flow can self-consistently reproduce the observed NS spin and QPO frequencies for reasonable values for accretion rates and NS magnetic field strengths. For a range of parameters, we recover family of solutions with accretion rates $\approx10^{-7}$--$10^{-5}$\,M$_{\odot}$\,yr$^{-1}$ and surface magnetic fields $\gtrsim10^{12}$\,G, in agreement with previous estimates. If validated, this interpretation could reconcile several observed properties of pulsating ULXs, including QPO frequencies and the observed high luminosities of these systems, in a self-consistent framework without requiring general relativistic effects and/or strong beaming due to specific viewing angles. Although the predictive power of the model is currently limited by parameter degeneracies and uncertainties, searching for and discovering more pulsating ULX systems will allow to further test or refute the proposed model.

 - **Abstract**
 Orbital Torus Imaging (OTI) is a dynamical inference method for determining the Milky Way's gravitational potential using stellar survey data. OTI uses gradients in stellar astrophysical quantities, such as element abundances, as functions of dynamical quantities, like orbital actions or energy, to estimate the Galactic mass distribution, assuming axisymmetry and steady-state of the system. While preliminary applications have shown promising outcomes, its sensitivity to disequilibrium effects is unknown. Here, we apply OTI to a benchmark Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE-2) cosmological hydrodynamic simulation, m12i, which enables a comparative analysis between known FIRE-2 vertical acceleration profiles and total surface mass densities to the analogous OTI-inferred results. We quantify OTI's accuracy within solar-analog volumes embedded in the simulated galactic disk. Despite a dynamically-evolving system, we find that OTI recovers the known vertical acceleration profiles within 3 sigma/1 sigma errors for 94%/75% of the volumes considered. We discuss the method's sensitivity to the local, instantaneous structure of the disk, reporting a loss in accuracy for volumes that have large (>1.5 kpc) scale heights and low total density at z=1.1 kpc. We present realistic OTI error bars from both MCMC sampling and bootstrapping the FIRE-2 simulated data, which provides a touchstone for interpreting results obtained from current and forthcoming surveys such as SDSS-V, Gaia, WEAVE, and 4MOST.

 - **Abstract**
 The force acting on a proton vortex in extreme type-II superconducting neutron star matter is studied in the limit of vanishing temperature. A detailed analysis is presented on how momentum is transferred from length scales on the order of the London penetration depth to the vortex core. To examine the momentum flux, expressions for proton and electron currents are derived for arbitrary distances from the vortex line. It is shown that, in the regime of a large electron mean free path, the only force acting directly on the vortex core is the Magnus force. Notably, the correction to the proton current near the vortex core generates a component of the Magnus force aligned with the incident current measured far from the vortex. This contribution, responsible for longitudinal force, is usually overlooked in the literature. The results obtained in this work for a relatively simple problem concerning the force on a vortex in cold matter of neutron stars may also be relevant to other superconducting systems.

 - **Abstract**
 The thermodynamic evolution of the intergalactic medium (IGM) is driven by a complex interplay between gravitational collapse, radiative cooling, and baryonic feedback associated with galaxy formation. Using cosmological hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations of a group of mass $8.83 \times 10^{12}$ M$_\odot$ and a cluster of mass $2.92 \times 10^{14}$ M$_\odot$ at $z=0$, we investigate the emergence of entropy plateaus at characteristic halo masses and their connection to feedback mechanisms. We use the SWIFT-EAGLE model with three resolution levels, down to an initial particle gas mass of $2.29 \times 10^5$ M$_\odot$ and dark matter particle mass of $1.23 \times 10^6$ M$_\odot$. Our analysis reveals that when halos reach $\sim 10^{12}$ M$_{\odot}$, their entropy profiles flatten at the virial radius, marking a transition where AGN feedback begins to dominate over supernova-driven regulation. By tracking the Lagrangian history of gas particles, we demonstrate that this entropy buildup is driven primarily by AGN feedback, which efficiently removes low-entropy gas from progenitors of groups and clusters, redistributing it throughout the IGM before the gas can fall into the core region. Recent XMM-Newton observations of X-GAP local groups reveal large entropy excesses and flat cores, in line with our predicted plateaus and in contrast to the steeper, power-law-like profiles of previous observations. While these predicted plateaus may be observationally confirmed in unbiased samples, reproducing the full diversity of entropy profiles, from flat cores to cool-core power laws, remains an outstanding challenge for next-generation feedback models. We suggest that current AGN feedback models may be overly efficient in expelling low-entropy gas from the potential cool-core $10^{12}$ M$_{\odot}$ progenitors, disrupting the balance between heating and cooling required to sustain long-lived cool cores.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate how differences in the stellar feedback produce disks with different morphologies in Milky Way-like progenitors over 1 $\leq z \leq 5$, using eight state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamics simulation codes in the \textit{AGORA} project. In three of the participating codes, a distinct, rotation-dominated inner core emerges with a formation timescale of $\lesssim 300$ Myr, largely driven by a major merger event, while two other codes exhibit similar signs of wet compaction -- gaseous shrinkage into a compact starburst phase -- at earlier epochs. The remaining three codes show only weak evidence of wet compaction. Consequently, we divide the simulated galaxies into two groups: those with strong compaction signatures and those with weaker ones. Galaxies in these two groups differ in size, stellar age gradients, and disk-to-total mass ratios. Specifically, codes with strong wet compaction build their outer disks in an inside-out fashion, leading to negative age gradients, whereas codes with weaker compaction feature flat or positive age gradients caused primarily by outward stellar migration. Although the stellar half-mass radii of these two groups diverge at $z \sim 3$, the inclusion of dust extinction brings their sizes and shapes in mock observations closer to each other and to observed galaxies. We attribute the observed morphological differences primarily to variations in the stellar feedback implementations -- such as delayed cooling timescales, and feedback strengths -- that regulate both the onset and duration of compaction. Overall, our results suggest that disk assembly at high redshifts is highly sensitive to the details of the stellar feedback prescriptions in simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 The cosmic-ray (CR) electrons and positrons in space are of great significance for studying the origin and propagation of cosmic-rays. The satellite-borne experiment DArk Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) has been used to measure the separate electron and positron spectra, as well as the positron fraction. In this work, the Earth's magnetic field is used to distinguish CR electrons and positrons, as the DAMPE detector does not carry an onboard magnet. The energy range for the measurements is from 10 to 20 GeV, being currently limited at high energy by the zenith pointing orientation of DAMPE. The results are consistent with previous measurements based on the magnetic spectrometer by AMS-02 and PAMELA, while the results of Fermi-LAT seem then to be systematically shifted to larger values.

 - **Abstract**
 Based on a large set of visual observations, the mean apparent magnitude of BlueBird satellites is 3.44, while the mean of magnitudes adjusted to a uniform distance of 1000 km is 3.84. Near zenith the spacecraft can be as bright as magnitude 0.5. While these spacecraft are bright enough to impact astronomical observations, they can for periods be fainter than the BlueWalker 3 prototype satellite. A model for their brightness shows that design changes since the BlueWalker 3 mission can explain the behavior of BlueBird.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Satellite galaxies experience multiple physical processes when interacting with their host halos, often leading to the quenching of star formation. In the Local Group (LG), satellite quenching has been shown to be highly efficient, affecting nearly all satellites except the most massive ones. While recent surveys are studying Milky Way (MW) analogs to assess how representative our LG is, the dominant physical mechanisms behind satellite quenching in MW-mass halos remain under debate. Aims: We analyze satellite quenching within the same MW-mass halo, simulated using various widely-used astrophysical codes, each using different hydrodynamic methods and implementing different supernovae feedback recipes. The goal is to determine whether quenched fractions, quenching timescales and the dominant quenching mechanisms are consistent across codes or if they show sensitivity to the specific hydrodynamic method and supernovae (SNe) feedback physics employed. Methods: We use a subset of high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations of a MW-mass halo from the multiple-code AGORA CosmoRun suite. Results: We find that the quenched fraction is consistent with the latest SAGA survey results within its 1$\sigma$ host-to-host scatter across all the models. Regarding quenching timescales, all the models reproduce the trend observed in the ELVES survey, LG observations, and previous simulations: the less massive the satellite, the shorter its quenching timescale. All our models converge on the dominant quenching mechanisms: strangulation halts cold gas accretion and ram pressure stripping is the predominant mechanism for gas removal, particularly effective in satellites with $M_* < 10^8\, M_\odot$. Nevertheless, the efficiency of the stripping mechanisms differs among the codes, showing a strong sensitivity to the different SNe feedback implementations and/or hydrodynamic methods employed.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent James-Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have discovered galaxies that are already passively evolving at $z>4$, $\sim1.5$\,Gyr after the Big Bang. Remarkably, some of these galaxies exhibit strong emission lines such as \ha\ and \oiii\ while showing a strong continuum break at $\sim3650$\,Å i.e., Balmer break, giving us a unique insight into the physical mechanisms responsible for early galaxy quenching. In this study, we investigate the nature of four such galaxies at $z=5.10$--$5.78$ identified in the Abell~2744 field, using JWST/NIRCam and NIRSpec data. Our spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting analysis reveals that these galaxies have been mostly quiescent since $\sim100$\,Myr prior to the observed time. We find a higher dust attenuation in the nebular component than in the continuum in all cases. This suggests the presence of dusty star-forming regions or obscured AGN, which could be a {\it residual} signature of past quenching. For one of the galaxies with sufficient medium-band coverage, we derive the \hb+\oiii\ emission line map, finding that the line-emitting region is located in the center and is more compact ($R_e=0.7$\,kpc) than the stellar component ($R_e=0.9$\,kpc). For this specific galaxy, we discuss a scenario where quenching proceeds in the manner of ``outside-in", a stark contrast to the inside-out quenching commonly seen in massive galaxies at later cosmic times.

 - **Abstract**
 The critical need to study the magnetic field in the solar corona is highlighted by recent observational facilities, such as DKIST and Aditya-L1. A powerful tool for probing the magnetism of the solar corona is forward modeling of the intensity and polarization of coronal emission lines in three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamic models. Here we present P-CORONA, a new spectral synthesis code designed to calculate the intensity and polarization of coronal lines in 3D models of the solar corona, taking into account the symmetry breaking induced by magnetic and velocity fields. P-CORONA allows the calculation of the on-disk and off-limb intensity and polarization of forbidden and permitted coronal lines, thus facilitating a wide range of investigations. Applying the quantum theory of atom-photon interactions, P-CORONA accounts for the spectral line polarization caused by anisotropic radiation pumping and the Hanle and Zeeman effects, making it a valuable tool for investigating coronal magnetic fields. This paper details the code's theoretical formulation, the implementation, and illustrative results of calculations in different 3D coronal models (MURaM and Predictive Science Inc.), including the impact of the Zeeman effect from the transverse magnetic field component on selected coronal forbidden lines. P-CORONA is now accessible to the research community on GitLab and Zenodo, providing a resource to facilitate research aimed at advancing our understanding of coronal magnetism and dynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are luminous, dispersed millisecond-duration radio bursts whose origin is poorly known. Recent observations suggest that some FRBs may reside in binary systems, even though conclusive evidence remains elusive. Here we report the detection of a 26.24$\pm$0.02 day periodicity in Faraday rotation measure (RM) of an actively repeating source named FRB 20201124A. The detection was made from 3,106 bursts collected with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) over ~365 days. The RM periodicity is coherently phase-connected across ~14 cycles over a 1-year duration. Our detection of RM periodicity corresponds to a natural logarithmic Bayesian factor of 1,168. The detection significances vary between 5.9-34 {\sigma} under different assumptions. Such a periodicity provides evidence for the binary nature of FRB 20201124A, where the periodic RM variations arise from the orbital motion of the FRB source within the magnetoionic environment of the system. Together with previous observations, our result suggests that being in binary systems may be a common feature for actively repeating FRB sources.

 - **Abstract**
 A few members of the recently-discovered class of ultra-long period objects have been identified as binaries with white-dwarf primaries. In most cases however, electromagnetic data are inconclusive and isolated magnetars remain a viable candidate. If the pulsation period matches that of the orbit though -- as is the case for ILT J1101+5521 and GLEAM-X J0704-37 -- several of these elusive radio transients should be gravitational-wave bright in the mHz band. Space-based interferometers could thus be used to provide independent constraints on their nature. We quantify the signal-to-noise ratio for the known systems, assuming they are compact binaries, and show that a few should be detectable with only a few months of data folding.

 - **Abstract**
 As an X-ray and gamma-ray all-sky monitor aiming for high energy astrophysical transients, Gravitational-wave high-energy Electromagnetic Counterpart All-sky Monitor (GECAM) has also made a series of observational discoveries on burst events of gamma-rays and particles in the low Earth orbit. Pitch angle is one of the key parameters of charged particles traveling around geomagnetic field. However, the usage of the GECAM-style instruments to measure the pitch angle of charged particles is still lacking. Here we propose a novel method for GECAM and similar instruments to measure the pitch angle of charged particles based on detector counts distribution. The basic conception of this method and simulation studies are described. With this method, the pitch angle of a peculiar electron precipitation event detected by GECAM-C is derived to be about 90$^\circ$, demonstrating the feasibility of our method. We note that the application of this method on GECAM-style instruments may open a new window for studying space particle events, such as Terrestrial Electron Beams (TEBs) and Lightning-induced Electron Precipitations (LEPs).

 - **Abstract**
 Charged particle precipitation typically manifests as a gradual increase and decrease of flux observed by space detectors. Cases with rapidly flux variation are very rare. Periodic events are even more extraordinary. These oscillating particle precipitation (OPP) events are usually attributed to the bounce motion of electrons, which are induced by lightning. Owing to the observation limitations, there has been debate regarding whether these oscillations originate from temporal flux evolution or spatial structure evolution. Here we report three peculiar charged particle precipitation events detected by GECAM during a geomagnetic storm on March 21, 2024, with two exhibiting significant periodicity. These events were observed around the same region during three consecutive orbits. Through comprehensive temporal and spectral analyses, we revealed that one of the OPP events exhibited a transition in spectral lag of mini-pulses, shifting from "softer-earlier" to "softer-later" while showing no significant time evolution in overall frequency characteristics. And there is no association found between these two OPP events and lightning activity. Several possible scenarios are discussed to explain these charged particles with a life time of more than 3.5 hours, but the nature of these three events remains an enigma. We suggest that these GECAM-detected OPP events may represent a new type of particle precipitation event or a peculiar Lightning-induced Electron Precipitations (LEPs).

 - **Abstract**
 The chiral magnetic effect (CME), a macroscopic manifestation of the quantum chiral anomaly, induces currents along magnetic field lines, facilitating mutual conversion between chiral asymmetry and magnetic helicity. Although the finite electron mass suppresses chiral asymmetry through spin-flip processes, we demonstrate that the CME remains effective and plays a significant role in the magnetic field evolution of magnetars. The magnetic helicity acts as a persistent internal source of chiral asymmetry, which mediates the redistribution of magnetic energy across spatial scales, without requiring an external energy source. Focusing on the neutron star crust, we show that this mechanism reshapes the magnetic field configuration inherited at birth and, within a hundred years, amplifies both toroidal and poloidal large-scale dipolar components (relevant for spin-down) up to $10^{14}$ G at the expense of small-scale structures. Our results offer a microphysical mechanism, alternative to traditional hydrodynamic dynamo models, establishing a new framework for understanding magnetar field dynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 The dwarf spheroidal galaxy, Segue 1, is thought to have one of the largest ratios of dark matter to stellar mass. Using orbit-based dynamical models, we model Segue 1, including a dark halo and a central black hole. The best-fit model requires a black hole mass of $4 \pm 1.5 \times 10^5\ M_\odot$. The value of the black hole mass is the same with or without a dark halo. The mass-to-light ratio of the stars is poorly constrained by the dynamical modeling, reflecting that Segue 1 is dominated by mass other than stars. Dynamical models that exclude a black hole provide a worse fit and require a dark halo with very small scale radii of around 100 parsecs. Additionally, the zero black hole models require a stellar orbital distribution that is highly radially biased. The model with a black hole provides an orbital structure that is close to isotropic, more similar to other well-studied systems. We argue that the two-parameter models of stars and black hole provide a better description of Segue 1 than the three-parameter models of stars and two dark halo components. Additional support for a central black hole comes from a significant increase in the central rotation. Using individual velocities, we measure a rotation amplitude of $9.0 \pm 2.4\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$. Segue 1 is likely being tidally stripped at large radii, and we might be witnessing the remnant nucleus of a more massive system. Alternatively, given the high black hole mass relative to the stellar mass, Segue 1 is analogous to Little Red Dots seen in the early Universe.
