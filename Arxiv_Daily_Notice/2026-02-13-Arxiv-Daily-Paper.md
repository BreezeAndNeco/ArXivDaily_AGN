 - **Abstract**
 Magneto-Rossby waves in the solar tachocline are currently considered to be one of the main determinants of solar activity. In particular, they can give rise to the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO). The latter was recently shown to be dominated by a phase-stable period of around 1.7 years. By analyzing 72 ground-level enhancement (GLE) events and 37 S-flares, we determine that this period is close to 1.723 years. This, in turn, is the dominant beat between the periods of the spring tides of the tidally dominant planets Venus, Earth, and Jupiter, which are suspected to synchronize not only the QBO, but also the 11.07-year Schwabe cycle. We demonstrate that recent events, such as the solar storm of 2024 May 10 and the strong X-flare of 2026 February 1, align well with maxima of the tidal forcing. By contrast, the Carrington event (1959 September 1) does not fit this pattern.
#### BlastBerries: How Supernovae Affect Lyman Continuum Escape Fractions and Ionizing Photon Production in Local Analogs of High-Redshift Galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 While compact, star-forming galaxies are believed to play a key role in cosmic reionization, the physical mechanisms enabling the escape of ionizing photons through the galactic interstellar medium remain unclear. Supernova (SN) feedback is one possible mechanism for clearing neutral gas channels to allow the escape of Lyman continuum photons. Here, we use SN discoveries in low-redshift analogs of high-redshift star-forming galaxies -- Green Pea galaxies and their even lower-redshift counterparts, Blueberry (BB) galaxies -- to understand how SNe shape the properties of their host galaxies at high redshifts. We cross-match 1242 BB galaxies with transient discovery reports and identify 11 SNe, ten of which are likely core-collapse SNe, and compare their hosts to the larger BB population. We find that SN-hosting BBs exhibit elevated star formation rates, burstier star formation histories within the last $\sim$50 Myr, and higher stellar masses. We estimate the occurrence rates of SNe in BB galaxies, finding that the SN rate may be slightly suppressed in BBs compared to field galaxies of similar mass, but we are unable to fully control for observational uncertainties. Finally, SN hosts show bluer UV slopes than non-host BB galaxies at 2.1$\sigma$ significance and lower ionizing photon production efficiency at 7.9$\sigma$ significance; the former result offers modest support for the hypothesis that SN-driven feedback plays a role in facilitating the escape of ionizing photons, while the latter may imply that SN-driven quenching decreases the rate of ionizing photon production in compact star-forming galaxies during the epoch of reionization.
#### The Curious Case of Centaurus A II: On the Subject of the Quenched satellites

 - **Abstract**
 The satellite system of Centaurus A presents a curious cosmological puzzle: while the global population is consistent with theoretical expectations, its inner regions (d<150 kpc) exhibit a deficit of luminous satellite galaxies. Using the Galacticus semi-analytic model applied to high-resolution N-body merger trees, we investigate potential quenching mechanisms to explain this trend. Our fiducial models, calibrated to the Milky Way, reproduce the overall Cen A population but overpredict the number of bright inner-halo satellites by a factor of 4 +- 1 at Mv < -15.8. We find that this is not due to statistical variance. Instead, the spatial coincidence of this deficiency with Cen A's massive, kiloparsec-scale radio lobes suggests a powerful environmental driver. We explore a range of physical scenarios, including enhanced tidal disruption, reionization quenching, and suppressed accretion into halos from the surrounding intergalactic medium. Our results indicate that AGN-driven thermal feedback at z < 5 can significantly suppress star formation in satellites, effectively truncating the bright end of the inner luminosity function. Our work suggests that the "Curious Case of Centaurus A" may provide evidence of AGN feedback within the host galaxy that regulates the survival and evolution of its dwarf galaxy satellites.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxies evolve within vast gaseous halos that fuel star formation and carry signatures of feedback-driven outflows. Deep integral field data have enabled the study of MgII halos, which trace galaxy-scale outflows in emission, but their faintness has limited studies to single-object analyses. Here, we present the first statistical study of MgII-emitting halos using deep MUSE observations of 47 star-forming galaxies at $0.7<z<2.0$. Building on our previous work, where we developed and applied an outflow modeling framework for a single MgII halo, we now extend this approach to a larger sample, enabling robust population-level insights on the properties of circumgalactic outflows traced by their extended MgII emission. We detect extended emission out to tens of kiloparsecs and model the outflows as an ensemble of radially accelerating shells. Galaxies with MgII outflows tend to have higher SFRs, sSFRs, and younger stellar populations, consistent with star-formation-driven winds. The observations are consistent with winds that accelerate linearly with radius, from launching velocities of ~60 km/s up to maximum velocities that correlate with stellar mass and reach ~490 km/s. Their inner regions are highly opaque, and we find a tentative trend between stellar mass and central optical depth. The opening angle of the outflow shows some dependency on the host-galaxy stellar mass, with less massive galaxies showing primarily wide opening angles, and more massive galaxies showing a broader range of values, with both wide and narrow opening angles. The distribution of the spatial extent of MgII halos exhibits a clear peak at half-light radius (HLR) of ~5 kpc, with an extended tail of larger HLR values, up to ~20 kpc. Compact halo sizes (HLR $< 8$ kpc) correlate with stellar mass, but extended halos do not, which could suggest a difference in the powering mechanism between compact and extended halos.
#### Revealing Exotic Nanophase Iron in Lunar Samples Through Impact-Driven Spatial Fingerprints

 - **Abstract**
 Nanophase iron (npFe) plays a crucial role in controlling the optical, chemical, and physical evolution of lunar regolith grains. While in-situ formation of npFe via reduction of native Fe-bearing minerals has long been considered a dominant pathway, recent mineralogical evidence from this http URL et al. (2025) reveals that the source of a significant fraction of npFe may be delivered directly by exotic micrometeoroid impacts (exotic npFe). Yet the atomic-scale processes governing how exotic np-Fe forms and survives during hypervelocity impacts remain largely unknown. To quantitatively compare in-situ and exotic delivery and formation of npFe, we perform a series of innovative atomistic modeling of micrometeoroid impacts with distinct projectile target compositions: (1) SiO$_2$ projectiles on Fe$_2$SiO$_4$ targets (in-situ formation), (2) Fe$_2$SiO$_4$ projectiles on SiO$_2$ targets (exotic delivery). Our results reveal distinct mechanistic fingerprints: in-situ np-Fe forms diffusely and radially around the impact site, whereas exotic np-Fe is efficiently retained and concentrated in asymmetric, momentum-aligned clusters. These contrasting spatial signatures provide a potential diagnostic criterion for distinguishing exotic versus in-situ np-Fe in returned lunar soils. In agreement with Chang'e-5 observations, our simulations demonstrate that exotic np-Fe production can be substantial, particularly in Fe-poor terrains such as highland regions. These findings highlight the need to account for exotic np-Fe when interpreting space weathering processes and remote-sensing data for the Moon and other airless bodies.
#### Filling The Pockets: The Spherical Nature of 3D Deflagration in Thermonuclear Supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate thermonuclear explosions within the delayed detonation framework. While spherical delayed detonation models generally reproduce key observational features, a fundamental inconsistency emerges in three dimensions: 3D hydrodynamic simulations exhibit insufficient white dwarf expansion during the deflagration phase. We identify the early deflagration stage, when the burning is dominated by the laminar speed, as a critical phase and explore potential solutions using three dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations performed with the FLASH code. In hydrodynamical simulations, the early deflagration phase produces large pockets of unburned C/O, leading to inefficient burning. Much of the released energy is deposited into buoyantly rising plumes rather than into the global pre-expansion of the white dwarf, which is required to produce the partially burned layers characteristic of SNe Ia. In contrast, when preexisting turbulent velocity fields and strong magnetic fields, on scales expected from the smoldering phase, are included, the effective burning approaches that in spherical models. Both turbulence and magnetic fields promote the entrainment of burned material into unburned pockets, addressing a long-standing problem in multi-dimensional deflagration models. The resulting streaks of burned material enable the conductive ignition of the surrounding unburned fuel. The dominant effect is not a change in the small-scale flame physics (~10^{-3} cm), but rather enhanced mixing between burned and unburned material. As expected, this mechanism is most efficient when the turbulent length scales are smaller than those of the unburned plumes.

 - **Abstract**
 We constrain the nebular attenuation curve and investigate dust geometry in star-forming galaxies at cosmic noon using photometric medium-band emission line measurements. We measure H-alpha emission line fluxes for a sample of 209 star-forming galaxies at 1.2<z<2.4 in MegaScience/UNCOVER with stellar masses spanning $7.85<\log_{10}(M_*/M_\odot)<11.0$. For 66 of these galaxies, we also measure a Pa-beta flux. We find that the Pa-beta/H-alpha line ratio increases strongly with stellar mass and star-formation rate (SFR) across our full mass range, indicating that more massive galaxies are dustier. We compare our results with a mass-, SFR-, and redshift-matched sample of galaxies from the MOSDEF survey with spectroscopic measurements of H-alpha/H-beta, finding that a shallow Reddy et al. (2025) nebular attenuation curve is more consistent with our observations than the typically assumed Cardelli et al. (1989) attenuation curve, especially for massive galaxies. This shallow attenuation curve could be explained by low dust covering fractions in star-forming regions. Through comparison to other studies, we show that assuming this shallower attenuation curve can increase the inferred A_Halpha,neb by up to 1 magnitude at high masses. We observe no trend between A_Halpha,neb and axis ratio, indicating that nebular attenuation is likely localized to small clumps. Altogether, our results strongly suggest that dust geometry is patchy and non-uniform, especially in massive galaxies. Our results highlight the ability of JWST medium bands to probe emission lines for large samples of galaxies, and statistically constrain dust properties in upcoming large programs.

 - **Abstract**
 To investigate the origin of the dependence of the covering factor on the Eddington ratio suggested by X-ray observations, we examined the angular distribution of HI and HII based on two-dimensional radiative hydrodynamic simulations. To calculate the Compton-thin covering factor $C_{22}$ and Compton-thick covering factor $C_{24}$ of HI alone, we performed one-dimensional photoionization equilibrium calculations with the XSTAR code based on radiative hydrodynamic simulations. The results obtained are as follows. (1) The Compton-thin covering factor $C_{22}$ of HI and HII is independent of the Eddington ratio and is approximately $70\%$, while $C_{22}$ of HI alone is also independent of the Eddington ratio and is approximately $30\%$. (2) The Compton-thick covering factor $C_{24}$ of HI has the same value as $C_{22}$ of HI. (3) Our $C_{24}$ is consistent with that obtained from X-ray observations. (4) Our $C_{22}$ agrees with that obtained from X-ray observations in a high Eddington ratio, while our $C_{22}$ is smaller than that from X-ray observations in a low Eddington ratio. (5) To explain the difference between $C_{22}$ obtained from theoretical calculations and that inferred from X-ray observations, a Compton-thin gas is required in regions extending at least $10~\mathrm{pc}$ beyond the current computational regions.

 - **Abstract**
 The quenching of star formation is a crucial phase in galaxy evolution. Although active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback has been proposed as a key driver of this transition, the lack of strong AGN in nearby quenching galaxies raises questions about its effectiveness. In this study, we investigate AGN activity in post-starburst galaxies (PSBs), star-forming galaxies (SFGs), and quiescent galaxies (QGs) at $z<$ 0.2, using multiwavelength data from eROSITA/eFEDS (X-ray), WISE (mid-infrared), and FIRST (radio). We assess AGN incidence and strength across different stages and apply stacking techniques to undetected galaxies to recover average AGN properties. Comparisons between observed luminosity and that expected from star formation (L$_{\rm obs}$/L$_{\rm SF}$) show that PSBs are consistent with star formation dominating their radio and X-ray emission. Although PSBs exhibit a MIR AGN incidence rate twice that of SFGs, their estimated AGN luminosities are small compared to those of MIR AGN in the literature. PSBs overall do not display significantly enhanced AGN emission relative to mass- and redshift-matched SFGs and QGs. While the presence of obscured, low-luminosity AGN in PSBs cannot be excluded, such AGN, if present, could be fueled by residual gas from the preceding starburst and may not play a dominant role in quenching. Our findings suggest that AGN's role in quenching at low redshift is more subtle than violently removing the gas -- the feedback is likely more "preventive" than "ejective".

 - **Abstract**
 By extending the Hubble Frontier Fields (HFF) observations to the F225W band using HST WFC3/UVIS, we measure the rest-frame UV luminosity function (LF) of galaxies at $0.4 < z < 0.7$, pushing into the low-luminosity galaxy regime. In this first paper of a series, we describe the HST Cycle-27 GO-15940 F225W observations and data reduction, and present a corresponding catalog for the Abell 2744 field, which is the most data-rich HFF cluster field. Combining deep Near-UV imaging and the high magnification from strong gravitational lensing of the foreground cluster, we identify 152 faint galaxies with $-19.5 < M_{UV} < -12.1$ at $0.4 < z < 0.7$ through hybrid photometric-spectroscopic redshift selection from the Abell 2744 F225W catalog. Using a sample defined by a $50\%$ completeness cut and applying the maximum likelihood estimation, we derive the best-fit Schechter parameters for the UV LF at $z \sim 0.55$ down to $M_\text{UV} < -13.5$ mag, including a faint-end slope of $\alpha = -1.324^{+0.072}_{-0.074}$. We incorporate a curvature parameter $\delta$ in parameter estimation to account for a possible turn-over at the faint end of the UV LF, leveraging the exceedingly low luminosities probed by our sample. Our results rule out a turn-over brighter than $M_{UV} = -15.5$ at the $3\sigma$ confidence level.

 - **Abstract**
 We use population synthesis modelling to predict the gravitational wave (GW) signal that the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will detect from the Galactic population of compact binary systems. We implement a realistic star formation history with time and position-dependent metallicity, and account for the effect of supernova kicks on present-day positions. We consider all binaries that have a white dwarf (WD), neutron star (NS), or black hole primary in the present-day. We predict that the summed GW signal from all Galactic binaries will already be detectable 3 months into the LISA mission, by measuring the power spectrum of the total GW strain. We provide a simple publicly available code to calculate such a power spectrum from a user-defined binary population. In the full 4 year baseline mission lifetime, we conservatively predict that $>2000$ binaries could be individually detectable as GW sources. We vary the assumed common envelope (CE) efficiency $\alpha$, and find that it influences both the shape of the power spectrum and the relative number of detectable systems with WD and NS progenitors. In particular, the ratio of individually detectable binaries with chirp mass $\mathcal{M} < M_\odot$ to those with $\mathcal{M} \geqslant M_\odot$ increases with $\alpha$. We therefore conclude that LISA may be able to diagnose the CE efficiency, which is currently poorly constrained.
#### Global magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the inner regions of protoplanetary discs. II. Vertical-net-flux regime

 - **Abstract**
 The inner regions of protoplanetary discs, which encompass the putative habitable zone, are dynamically complex, featuring a relatively well-ionised, turbulent active zone located interior to a poorly ionised 'dead' zone. In this second paper, we investigate a model of the magnetohydrodynamic processes around the interface between these two regions, using five three-dimensional global magnetohydrodynamic simulations of discs threaded by a large-scale poloidal-net-flux magnetic field. We employ physically motivated profiles for Ohmic resistivity and ambipolar diffusion, alongside a simplified thermodynamic model comprising a cool disc and hot corona. Our results show that, first, the interface acts as a one-way barrier to inward transport of large-scale magnetic flux from the dead zone. This leads to magnetic flux depletion throughout most of the active zone, whereby it either advects inwards to the inner numerical boundary or accumulates just inside the interface. Second, two sources of strong variability emerge from the interface due to the difficulty of maintaining a constant, vertically integrated electrical current across distinct and evolving magnetic-field states. Third, despite the weak magnetothermal wind in the dead zone, a pressure maximum forms at the interface, leading to Rossby-wave-induced vortices. Fourth, unlike the model of Iwasaki et. al (2024), there is no 'transition zone' devoid of magnetic flux and magnetic winds. Instead, multiple outflow zones span all disc radii reflecting the radially varying launch conditions, with an inner turbulent wind impinging upon an outer, more laminar one. Fifth, a heated corona prevents the 'puffing up' of poloidal-net-flux, active disc regions.

 - **Abstract**
 Free electrons in the Galactic interstellar medium (ISM) disperse and scatter coherent radio waves, by amounts that depend on the distance to the radio source. Models of the Galactic electron density are thus widely used to predict distances and scattering of compact radio sources (including pulsars, fast radio bursts (FRBs), and long-period transients), in addition to mitigating ISM foregrounds in Galactic and extragalactic studies. We use a sample of 171 precise pulsar distances, based entirely on parallaxes and globular cluster associations, as well as scattering measurements of 568 pulsars, active galactic nuclei, and masers, to update the NE2001 Galactic electron density model. We refit the thick and thin disks and three of the spiral arms. The new parameters for these large-scale components significantly repartition free electrons between the thick disk and spiral arms, thereby correcting NE2001's systematic underestimation of pulsar distance and scattering. Sightlines with excessive dispersion and scattering are used to identify new clumps that are added to the model, in addition to refining clumps that were already included (e.g., Cygnus, Vela, and Gum). The Galactic Center component is revised, yielding scattering time predictions that are $10^3$ times smaller than the Galactic Center in NE2001. The updated model, NE2025, provides a factor of $20\times$ improvement in median distance prediction accuracy and $100\%$ median improvement in scattering predictions based on DM, relative to NE2001. There is a $15\times$ improvement in median distance prediction accuracy relative to YMW16. NE2025 is available on Github and the Python Package Interface.

 - **Abstract**
 Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs) have to travel through the heliosphere before they interact with the Earth's atmosphere. During this, they are deflected by the Sun's magnetic field, causing variations in this field to imprint on the flux, spectrum and angular distribution of GCRs detected at or near Earth. Studies of these variations over the past several decades have revealed the impact of both transient phenomena such as solar flares, coronal holes, sunspot activity and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) as well as their effects such as Forbush Decreases (FDs), precursors and Ground-Level Enhancements (GLEs). Periodic variations, such as due to the solar diurnal modulation, the 27-day solar rotation, the 11-year solar cycle, and the 22-year solar magnetic cycle have also been characterized. These Sun-induced phenomena are most prominent in GCR intensity variations up to $\sim$30 GeV/nuc, beyond which the influence of solar modulation decreases rapidly as the gyro-radii of GCRs exceed the characteristic size of the heliosphere ($\sim$100 AU).

 - **Abstract**
 Diagnosing solar flare conditions is essential for understanding coronal energy release. Using combined microwave and X-ray data, we reconstruct three-dimensional maps of the magnetic field and plasma parameters in the SOL2021-05-07 flare. We use imaging spectroscopy from the Expanded Owens Valley Solar Array (EOVSA) to derive spatial maps of the magnetic field strength, thermal and nonthermal electron densities, and the power-law index of nonthermal electrons through gyrosynchrotron modeling. Simultaneous X-ray observations from Hinode/XRT and Solar Orbiter/STIX, obtained from different vantage points, enable a stereoscopic reconstruction of the flaring loop. By correlating the positions of microwave and thermal X-ray sources, we associate the three-dimensional coordinates with the microwave-derived plasma parameters. We derive observational three-dimensional maps of magnetic field strength, Alfvén speed, and plasma beta in the flaring volume, revealing a magnetically dominated environment. These spatially resolved diagnostics provide valuable constraints for models of magnetic reconnection and flare dynamics and represent a step toward a realistic three-dimensional characterization of energy release in solar eruptive events.

 - **Abstract**
 Large-amplitude decaying kink oscillations of coronal loops are strongly influenced by nonlinear processes, such as Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) and turbulence, though comprehensive theory and observational confirmation remain limited. Building on the recently developed theory on nonlinear damping by KHI-induced turbulence in impulsively driven transverse loop oscillations, we investigate its observational signatures using 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations and forward-modelled EUV images. The simulated oscillations exhibit time-varying frequency shifts and damping rates, which are broadly consistent with nonlinear turbulence-damping theory. Additionally, they exhibit excitation of higher-order modes, slightly increased periods relative to the linear kink period, and reduced displacement amplitudes. These features are generally preserved in synthetic observations, though resolving higher-order modes requires higher spatial resolution than currently available. For loops embedded in a hotter background, hotter channels (e.g., 193 Angstroms) are more sensitive to boundary dynamics, thus their oscillations decay faster with smaller displacements and larger phase shifts than those in cooler channels (e.g., 171 Angstroms). Comparisons of simulated and synthetic oscillations show close agreement at the early stage. At later times, synthetic oscillations exhibit smaller displacements and larger phase shifts, due to turbulence-induced asymmetry in the loop cross-section. Bayesian fitting shows that the initial oscillation amplitude and kink period are robustly constrained, whereas parameters controlling the damping profile are degenerate, indicating that additional observables would aid reliable seismological inference. These results provide a quantitative basis for identifying nonlinear damping and detecting KHI-driven turbulence in transverse loop oscillations.

 - **Abstract**
 Aims: We derive SBCRs for classical Cepheids in the Milky Way and in the Magellanic Clouds using the photometric data available in the Gaia database, and we quantify the metallicity effect. Methods: We first selected the data on the basis of a number of quality criteria and chose the best photometric data and the best parallaxes available in Gaia for Milky Way classical Cepheids. Secondly, we compiled an extensive list of period-radius (PR) relations available in the literature, and we also provide a new PR relation based on interferometric data in our previous work. Thirdly, combining the radius of classical Cepheids with distance estimates (based on Gaia parallaxes for the Milky Way and on eclipsing binaries for the Magellanic Clouds), we derived the surface brightness and colour of about 1700 classical Cepheids. Results: We first derived a new PR relation based on interferometric data and distances from the literature of seven classical Cepheids: $\mathrm{\log(R/R_{\odot}) = 1.133_{\pm 0.019} + 0.688_{\pm 0.016} log(P)}$. The metallicity does not affect the PR relations. Secondly, we calculated three different SBCRs for the Milky Way and Large and Small Magellanic Cloud classical Cepheids based on this new PR relation that clearly show the dependence of the metallicity on the SBCR based on Gaia magnitudes alone. Finally, we derived relations between the slopes, the zero points (ZP), and the metallicity ([Fe/H]) of these three SBCRs: $\mathrm{Slope_{SBCR}=-0.0663_{\pm 0.0121} [Fe/H] - 0.3010_{\pm 0.0030}}$ and $\mathrm{ZP_{SBCR}=-0.1016_{\pm 0.0091} [Fe/H] + 3.9988_{\pm 0.0029}}$. Conclusions: These new SBCRs, dedicated to classical Cepheids in the Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds, are of particular importance to apply the inverse Baade-Wesselink method to classical Cepheids observed by Gaia in a forthcoming study.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive interstellar scintillation (ISS) study of the radio-loud magnetar XTE~J1810$-$197, based on six years of multi-frequency monitoring (2018$-$2024) with the Shanghai Tian Ma Radio Telescope (TMRT) at 7.0, 8.6, and 14.0~GHz. The scintillation parameters--decorrelation bandwidth $\Delta\nu_{\rm d}$, decorrelation time $\Delta\tau_{\rm d}$, and drift rate $dt/d\nu$--are fully characterized. Our measured $\Delta\tau_{\rm d}$ implies $\Delta\tau_{\rm d} < 4$~s at 575-725~MHz under a Kolmogorov spectrum, which is shorter than the magnetar's 5.54~s spin period. This result naturally explains the previously reported absence of pulse-to-pulse coherence at these frequencies. Kinematic modeling locates the dominant scattering screen at $1.6\pm0.1$~kpc away from the Earth, within the Sagittarius Arm. The screen coincides with the HII region JCMTSE~J180921.2$-$201932 and is unrelated to the magnetar's 2018 outburst suggested by earlier studies. A scintillation arc detected at 14.0~GHz represents the highest-frequency arc observed to date. The asymmetry of arcs is linearly correlated with a dispersion-measure gradient across the screen ($r = 0.959$, $p < 10^{-8}$). We also measure its refractive scintillation timescale, which is only $1.21\pm0.19$~d. Clear DISS at 14~GHz effectively resolves the debate over a possible strong-to-weak scattering transition at this frequency. These results extend the ISS characterization of magnetars to previously unexplored frequencies and provide a precise probe of the ionized interstellar medium in the Sagittarius Arm.

 - **Abstract**
 The B335 protostar has undergone a major outburst detected in the scattered light of its outflow cavity that has not yet ended. B335 therefore offers the rare opportunity to study its effect on the jet of a protostellar object. Photometry of background stars behind B335 is used to map visual continuum extinction and H$_2$O ice absorption and demonstrates that the outflow has carved out a cavity. Precise proper motions of the shock fronts emerging from the B335 protostar were obtained. The kinematic age of the most prominent shock front (3E) corresponds to the early phases of the ongoing outburst of the B335 protostar. Shock 3E shows strong CO gas emission, as well as H$_2$ and [\ion{Fe}{2}] emission. Older shock fronts show diminished CO emission and are dominated by H$_2$ and [\ion{Fe}{2}]. The emission feature 0E, closest to the protostar, is distinct in proper motion and radial velocity from the other shock fronts in the jet. In the span of 4\arcsec\ closest to the protostar, the continuum extinction in front of the outflow cavity increases by A$_V$~$\approx$~200 mag. The CO-line-removed spectra close to the protostar show the unsaturated absorption features of $^{13}$CO$_2$, OCN$^-$, and OCS have strongly increasing column densities toward the protostar. The ice characteristics are overall similar to those found in lines of sight with less extinction. The central regions of the bipolar nebula show CO gas emission, but at distances of a few arcsec from the protostar, absorption by CO gas is also detected.

 - **Abstract**
 The amplification of magnetic fields in black hole accretion flows governs key high-energy phenomena such as magnetically arrested disks and relativistic jets. We develop a semi-analytical general relativistic framework that extends classical compressional amplification models by incorporating rotational shear, and apply it to large-scale poloidal magnetic field evolution in accretion flows around a Schwarzschild black hole. By parameterizing the azimuthal velocity as a fraction of the Keplerian value ($\xi \in [0,1]$), from purely radial infall ($\xi=0$) to Keplerian rotation ($\xi=1$), we examine the combined effects of radial compression and shear. Purely radial flows maximize amplification of both $B_r$ and $B_\theta$ due to strong compression. In rotating flows, a distinct dichotomy emerges: sub-Keplerian regimes ($\xi<1$) preferentially enhance $B_r$, whereas Keplerian rotation strengthens $B_\theta$ via shear. The transition from subsonic outer regions to supersonic relativistic inner regions further accelerates magnetic growth, revealing effects absent in earlier analytical treatments. These results show that rotational support controls both amplification efficiency and magnetic geometry, with sub-Keplerian phases particularly favorable for advecting the radial flux required for MAD formation. This work provides an analytical bridge between classical accretion theory and modern GRMHD simulations, with implications for X-ray binaries, AGNs, and EHT-scale systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmological inference from weak lensing (WL) surveys is increasingly limited by uncertainties in baryonic physics, which suppress the non-linear matter power spectrum on small scales. Multi-probe analyses that incorporate complementary tracers of the gas distribution around haloes offer a pathway to calibrate these effects and recover unbiased cosmological information. In this work, we forecast the constraining power of a joint analysis combining fiducial data from a Stage-IV WL survey with measurements of the dispersion measure from fast radio bursts (FRBs). We evaluate the ability of this approach to simultaneously constrain cosmological parameters and the astrophysical processes governing baryonic feedback, and we quantify the impact of key FRB systematics, including redshift uncertainties and source clustering. We find that, even after accounting for these effects, a 3$\times$2-point analysis of WL and FRBs significantly improves cosmological constraints, reducing the degradation factor on $S_8$ by $\sim 80\%$ compared to WL alone. We further show that FRBs alone are sensitive only to a degenerate combination of the key baryonic parameters, $\log_{10} M_{\rm c}$ and $\eta_{\rm b}$, and that the inclusion of WL measurements breaks this degeneracy. Finally, we extend our framework to incorporate galaxy clustering measurements using Luminous Red Galaxy and Emission Line Galaxy samples, performing a unified 6$\times$2-point analysis of WL, dispersion measures of FRBs, and galaxy clustering. While this combined approach tightens constraints on $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and $\log_{10} M_{\rm c}$, it does not lead to a significant improvement in $S_8$ constraints beyond those obtained from WL and FRBs alone.
#### Status of the $S_8$ Tension: A 2026 Review of Probe Discrepancies

 - **Abstract**
 The parameter $S_8 \equiv \sigma_8 (\Omega_m/0.3)^{0.5}$ quantifies the amplitude of matter density fluctuations. A persistent discrepancy exists between early-universe CMB observations and late-universe probes. This review assesses the ``$S_8$ tension'' against a new 2026 baseline: a unified ``Combined CMB'' framework incorporating Planck, ACT DR6, and SPT-3G. This combined analysis yields $S_8 = 0.836^{+0.012}_{-0.013}$, providing a higher central value and reduced uncertainties compared to Planck alone. Compiling measurements from 2019--2026, we reveal a striking bifurcation: DES Year 6 results exhibit a statistically significant tension of $2.4\sigma$--$2.7\sigma$ \citep{DESY6}, whereas KiDS Legacy results demonstrate statistical consistency at $<1\sigma$ \citep{Wright2025}. We examine systematic origins of this dichotomy, including photometric redshift calibration, intrinsic alignment modeling, and shear measurement pipelines. We further contextualize these findings with cluster counts (where eROSITA favors high values while SPT favors low), galaxy-galaxy lensing, and redshift-space distortions. The heterogeneous landscape suggests survey-specific systematic effects contribute substantially to observed discrepancies, though new physics beyond $\Lambda$CDM cannot be excluded.
