 - **Abstract**
 I discuss here the progress made in the last decade on few of the key open problems in GRB physics. These include: (1) the nature of GRB progenitors, and the outliers found to the collapsar/merger scenarios; (2) Jet structures, whose existence became evident following GRB/GW170817; (3) the great progress made in understanding the GRB jet launching mechanisms, enabled by general-relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic (GR-MHD) codes; (4) recent studies of magnetic reconnection as a valid energy dissipation mechanism; (5) the early afterglow, which may be highly affected by a wind bubble, as well as recent indication that in many GRBs, the Lorentz factor is only a few tens, rather than few hundreds. I highlight some recent observational progress, including major breakthrough in detecting TeV photons and the on-going debate about their origin, polarization measurements, as well as the pair annihilation line recently detected in GRB 221009A, and its implications on the prompt emission physics. I point into some open questions that I anticipate would be at the forefront of GRB research in the next decade.
#### The effect of outflow launching radial efficiency of accretion disk on the shape of emission-line profiles

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents a preliminary investigation into the influence of radial behavior of disk outflow on the structure and dynamics of the broad line region (BLR) in active galactic nuclei (AGNs), with the emphasis on how the mass ejection rate contribute in shaping the broad emission line profiles. Specifically, we analyze how varying the radial efficiency of mass loss from accretion disks, driven by radiative dust-based mechanisms, contribute to the distribution of material in the BLR. By exploring different radial scenarios of disk mass loss behavior, we uncover connections between outflow radial efficiency and emission line profiles, particularly for lowly ionized lines. Our findings reveal that while the observed shape of broad emission lines is partially influenced by the radial behavior of the disk outflow, it ultimately depends more critically on the physical conditions of the clouds and the specific approach adopted to the emissivity for their contribution to the line formation.

 - **Abstract**
 The time series of energy and waiting time of magnetar bursts carry important information about the source activity. In this paper, we investigate the memory and dynamical stability of magnetar bursts from four soft gamma repeater (SGR) sources: SGR 1806$-$20, SGR 1900+14, SGR J1935+2154 and SGR J1550$-$5418. Based on the rescaled range analysis, we quantify the memory in magnetar bursts for the first time and find that there exists long-term memory in the time series of both waiting time and energy. We investigate the dynamical stability in the context of randomness and chaos. For all the four SGR samples, we find that the waiting time is not completely random, but the energy of two SGRs is consistent with a total random organization. Furthermore, both waiting time and energy exhibits weak chaos. We also find no significant difference between SGRs and repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) in the randomness-chaos phase space. The statistical similarity between SGRs and repeating FRBs hints that there may be potential physical connection between these two phenomena.

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate measurements of cosmic ray proton flux are crucial for studying the modulation processes of cosmic rays during the solar activity cycle. We present a proton flux measurement method based on ground-based neutron monitor (NM) data and machine learning techniques. After preprocessing the NM data, we use a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to simulate the relationship between the NM observations and proton flux measured by the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS-02). We obtain daily proton flux data ranging from 1GV to 100GV for the period from 2011 to 2024, showing that the measured values are in good agreement with the observed ones. In particular, we provide daily proton flux measurements for periods when AMS-02 data are unavailable due to operational reasons. We also perform wavelet analyses on the continuous proton flux data to investigate the relationship between proton flux and solar activity variations, particularly during late 2014 when AMS-02 measurements were missing.
#### An attempt to study axion-photon coupling using compact binary systems with high Shapiro time delay

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.19233

 - **Abstract**
 We study the axion-photon conversion process in pulsar binary systems with high Shapiro time delay. In these binary systems, the orbital plane is nearly parallel to the line of sight. When the companion star is positioned between the pulsar and the Earth, the pulsar radiation beam will pass through the companion's magnetic field, potentially leading to axion-photon conversion that affects the intensity and linear polarization of the photons. The advantage of using such systems for axion or axion-like particle (ALP) research is that the intrinsic intensity and polarization state of the source photons can be well determined. This work analyzes the axion-photon conversion and the magnetic field along the photon path, establishing the corresponding model and solving it numerically. We choose PSR J1614-2230 and PSR J1910-5959A for our study. By assuming the companion's magnetic field, magnetic axis angle, and detector sensitivity, we discuss the feasibility of using high Shapiro delay binary systems to constrain the axion/ALP parameter space. We find that the upper limits derived from these two sources are weaker then existing constraints. However, considering the higher reliability, the method proposed in this work is still valuable. As more suitable samples and richer observational results are discovered, further constraints on the axion parameters could be strengthened.
#### Effect of Peak Absolute Magnitude of Type Ia Supernovae and Sound Horizon Values on Hubble Tension using DESI results

Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19240

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.19240

 - **Abstract**
 We apply data-motivated priors on the peak absolute magnitude of Type Ia supernovae ($M$), and on the sound horizon at the drag epoch ($r_d$), to study their impact on the Hubble tension, when compared to the Planck estimated value of the Hubble constant. We use the data from Pantheon$+$, cosmic chronometers, and the latest DESI BAO results for this purpose. We reaffirm the fact that there is a degeneracy between $M$ and $r_d$, and modifying the $r_d$ values to reconcile the Hubble tension also requires a change in the peak absolute magnitude $M$. For certain $M$ and $r_d$ priors, the tension is found to reduce to as low as (1.2-2) $\sigma$.

 - **Abstract**
 In recent years, the jet formation region in active galaxies has been imaged through mm-VLBI in few ideal targets, first and foremost M87. An important leap forward for understanding jet launching could be made by identifying a larger number of suitable objects, characterized by different accretion modes and jet powers. In this article, we present 1 cm and 7 mm VLBI data of a sample of 16 poorly explored radio galaxies, comprising both High-Excitation (HEG) and Low-Excitation Galaxies (LEG) and spanning a large range in radio power. The combination of the sources vicinity (z<0.1) with a large black hole mass ($\log{M_{\rm BH}}$>8.5) results in a high spatial resolution in units of Schwarzschild radii ($<10^3-10^4$ $R_{\rm S}$), necessary for probing the region where the jet is initially accelerated and collimated. We aim at identifying the best candidates for follow-up observations with current and future VLBI facilities. The observations were performed with the High Sensitivity Array, including Effelsberg and the phased-VLA, which has allowed us to characterize the sub-parsec properties of these faint jets and to estimate their core brightness temperature and orientation. The number of sources imaged on scales $\lesssim 10^3$ $R_{\rm S}$ is more than doubled by our study. All targets were detected at both frequencies, and several present two-sided jet structures. Several LEG jets show hints of limb-brightening. The core brightness temperatures are generally below the equipartition value, indicating that equipartition has not yet been reached and/or that the emission is de-boosted. Among LEG, we identify 3C31, 3C66B, and 3C465 as the most promising, combining a relatively high flux density (>50 mJy) with superb spatial resolution (<500 $R_{\rm S}$) at 7 mm. The powerful HEG 3C452 is interesting as well due to its highly symmetric, two-sided jet base.

 - **Abstract**
 Aims. In this paper, we searched for multi-wavelength (X-ray, optical and radio) counterparts to the unassociated gamma-ray sources (UGS) of the Fermi 4FGL-DR4 catalog. The main goal is to identify new blazars and/or new active galactic nuclei (AGNs) emitting at GeV energies [like (Narrow Line) Seyfert-1 and radio galaxies]. Methods. We focus on sky regions observed by the Swift satellite that overlap with the reported positions of the UGSs. Since our primary interest lies in extra-galactic sources, we focus on UGSs located outside the Galactic plane (|b| > 10$^{\circ}$). Due to the large number of sources (about 1800 UGS), we developed a pipeline to automatise the search for counterparts and significantly reduce the computational time for the analysis. Our association process begins by identifying potential X-ray counterparts for each UGS; if one is found, we further look for corresponding radio and optical counterparts in the X-ray counterpart error box, thus minimizing ambiguities. Results. Out of the 1284 UGSs in the 4FGL-DR4 catalog, 714 were observed at least once by Swift/XRT. We detected, with a significance of $\geq$ 3$\sigma$, at least one X-ray source within the Fermi error box for 274 of these $\gamma$-ray emitters. Among these, 193 UGSs have a single potential X-ray counterpart (referred to as UGS1), while 81 have multiple potential X-ray counterparts within the Fermi error box (referred to as UGS2). Of the UGS2, 54 have two X-ray counterparts, 11 have three, and the remaining 16 have more than three. Each UGS1 has an optical counterpart, and 113 also could be associated to a radio counterpart. We performed a comparison of the possible counterpart properties with those of the $\gamma$-ray emitters identified by Fermi, with the aim to assess the goodness of our associations.
#### GRB multi-TeV detection: Beyond standard physics?

 - **Abstract**
 The recent detection by LHAASO up to 18 TeV of the gamma ray burst GRB 221009A at redshift $z = 0.151$ challenges standard physics because of the strong absorption due to the extragalactic background light (EBL) for photons with energies above 10 TeV. Emission models partially avoiding EBL absorption proposed to explain such an event are unsatisfactory since they require peculiar and contrived assumptions. By introducing in magnetized media the interaction of photons with axion-like particles (ALPs) - which are a generic prediction of most theories extending the standard model of particle physics towards a more satisfying theory - the detection of GRB 221009A can be naturally explained, thereby providing a strong hint at ALP existence.
#### Quasi-steady emission from repeating fast radio bursts can be explained by magnetar wind nebula

 - **Abstract**
 Among over 1000 known fast radio bursts (FRBs), only three sources - FRB 121102 (R1), FRB 190520 (R2) and FRB 201124 (R3) - have been linked to persistent radio sources (PRS). The observed quasi-steady emission is consistent with synchrotron radiation from a composite of magnetar wind nebula (MWN) and supernova (SN) ejecta. We compute the synchrotron flux by solving kinetic equations for energized electrons, considering electromagnetic cascades of electron-positron pairs interacting with nebular photons. For rotation-powered model, a young neutron star (NS) with age $t_{\rm age}\approx 20\,{\rm yr}$, dipolar magnetic field $B_{\rm dip}\approx (3-5)\times10^{12}\,{\rm G}$ and spin period $P_i\approx 1.5-3\,{\rm ms}$ in an ultra-stripped SN progenitor can account for emissions from R1 and R2. In contrast, R3 requires $t_{\rm age}\approx 10\,{\rm yr}$, $B_{\rm dip}\approx 5.5\times10^{13}\,{\rm G}$ and $P_i\approx 10\,{\rm ms}$ in a conventional core-collapse SN progenitor. For magnetar-flare-powered model, NS aged $t_{\rm age} \approx 25\,/40\,{\rm yr}$ in a USSN progenitor and $t_{\rm age} \approx 12.5\,{\rm yr}$ in a CCSN progenitor explains the observed flux for R1/R2 and R3, respectively. Finally, we constrain the minimum NS age $t_{\rm age,min} \sim 1-3\,{\rm yr}$ from the near-source plasma contribution to observed DM, and $t_{\rm age,min} \sim 6.5-10\,{\rm yr}$ based on the absence of radio signal attenuation.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) catalog from the fourth data release (HDR4) of the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment Survey (HETDEX). HETDEX is an untargeted spectroscopic survey. HDR4 contains 345,874 Integral Field Unit (IFU) observations from January 2017 to August 2023 covering an effective area of 62.9 deg2. With no imaging pre-selection, our spectroscopic confirmed AGN sample includes low-luminosity AGN, narrow-line AGN, and/or red AGN down to g~25. This catalog has 15,940 AGN across the redshifts of z=0.1~4.6, giving a raw AGN number density of 253.4 deg-2. Among them, 10,499 (66%) have redshifts either confirmed by line pairs or matched to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Quasar Catalog. For the remaining 5,441 AGN, 2,083 are single broad line AGN candidates, while the remaining 3,358 are single intermediate broad line (full width at half maximum, FWHM ~ 1200 km s-1) AGN candidates. A total of 4,060 (39%) of the 10,499 redshift-confirmed AGN have emission-line regions $3\sigma$ more extended than the image quality which could be strong outflows blowing into the outskirts of the host galaxies or ionized intergalactic medium.
#### Standardizing reverberation-mapped H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ active galactic nuclei using radius--luminosity relations involving monochromatic and broad H$\alpha$ luminosities

 - **Abstract**
 We test the standardizability of a homogeneous sample of 41 lower-redshift ($0.00415\leq z \leq 0.474$) active galactic nuclei (AGNs) reverberation-mapped (RM) using the broad H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ emission lines. We find that these sources can be standardized using four radius$-$luminosity ($R-L$) relations incorporating H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ time delays and monochromatic and broad H$\alpha$ luminosities. Although the $R-L$ relation parameters are well constrained and independent of the six cosmological models considered, the resulting cosmological constraints are weak. The measured $R-L$ relations exhibit slightly steeper slopes than predicted by a simple photoionization model and steeper than those from previous higher-redshift H$\beta$ analyses based on larger datasets. These differences likely reflect the absence of high-accreting sources in our smaller, lower-redshift sample, which primarily comprises lower-accreting AGNs. The inferred cosmological parameters are consistent within 2$\sigma$ (or better) with those from better-established cosmological probes. This contrasts with our earlier findings using a larger, heterogeneous sample of 118 H$\beta$ AGNs, which yielded cosmological constraints differing by $\gtrsim 2\sigma$ from better-established cosmological probes. Our analysis demonstrates that sample homogeneity$-$specifically, the use of a consistent time-lag determination method$-$is crucial for developing RM AGNs as a cosmological probe.
#### Magnetic fields on different spatial scales of the L328 cloud

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.19701

 - **Abstract**
 L328 core has three sub-cores S1, S2, and S3, among which the sub-core S2 contains L328-IRS, a Very Low Luminosity Object (VeLLO), which shows a CO bipolar outflow. Earlier investigations of L328 mapped cloud/envelope (parsec-scale) magnetic fields (B-fields). In this work, we used JCMT/POL-2 submillimeter (sub-mm) polarisation measurements at 850 $\mu$m to map core-scale B-fields in L328. The B-fields were found to be ordered and well-connected from cloud to core-scales, i.e., from parsec- to sub-parsec-scale. The connection in B-field geometry is shown using $Planck$ dust polarisation maps to trace large-scale B-fields, optical and near-infrared (NIR) polarisation observations to trace B-fields in the cloud and envelope, and 850 $\mu$m polarisation mapping core-scale field geometry. The core-scale B-field strength, estimated using the modified Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi relation, was found to be 50.5 $\pm$ 9.8 $\mu$G, which is $\sim$2.5 times higher than the envelope B-field strength found in previous studies. This indicates that B-fields are getting stronger on smaller (sub-parsec) scales. The mass-to-flux ratio of 1.1 $\pm$ 0.2 suggests that the core is magnetically transcritical. The energy budget in the L328 core was also estimated, revealing that the gravitational, magnetic, and non-thermal kinetic energies were comparable with each other, while thermal energy was significantly lower.
