 - **Abstract**
 We characterize the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) pulsar SXP 46.6 using NuSTAR observations conducted in 2017. The spin period (P) of this neutron star decreased from its discovered value of 46.6 s to a value of 45.984(1) s, indicating a spin-up at the rate of \dot{P} = -1.13 x 10^{-9} s s^{-1}. This spin-up rate is used to calculate a high pulsar magnetic field value of 2.25 x 10^{13} G. This process also gives a low magnetic field value, which we rule out here by constraining the inner accretion disk radius to be less than the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit. The pulse profile, analyzed in soft, hard, and broad X-ray bands, shows a double-peaked structure, consistent with pencil beam emission from two antipodal hot spots on the neutron star surface. We also perform spin phase-resolved spectroscopy for the first time, revealing spectral variations across different phases of the pulsar's rotation. These results offer new insights into the long-term spin evolution and emission properties of SXP 46.6.

 - **Abstract**
 Narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies are a type of active galactic nuclei (AGN) that were originally classified as sources with little to no radio emission. Although the class is rather unified from an optical perspective, their radio characteristics are diverse. One of the biggest curiosities found in these sources is their ability to form and maintain powerful relativistic jets. We studied the radio properties of a sample of 3998 NLS1 galaxies which is the largest clean sample available, thus allowing us to study the population-wide characteristics. We used both historical and ongoing surveys: the LOw-Frequency ARray (LOFAR) Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS; 144~MHz), the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-centimeters (FIRST; 1.4~GHz), the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) Very Large Array (VLA) Sky Survey (NVSS; 1.4~GHz), and the VLA Sky Survey (VLASS; 3~GHz). We were able to obtain a radio detection for $\sim40\%$ of our sources, with the most detections by LoTSS. The majority of the detected NLS1 galaxies are faint ($\sim1-2$ mJy) and non-variable, suggesting considerable contributions from star formation activities, especially at 144~MHz. However, we identified samples of extreme sources, for example, in fractional variability and radio luminosity, indicating significant AGN activity. Our results highlight the heterogeneity of the NLS1 galaxy population in radio and lays the foundation for targeted future studies.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar feedback drives multiphase gas outflows from starburst galaxies, but the interpretation of dust emission in these winds remains uncertain. To investigate this, we analyze new JWST mid-infrared images tracing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission at 7.7 and 11.3~$\mu$m from the outflow of the prototypical starburst M82 out to $3.2$ kpc. We find that PAH emission shows significant correlations with CO, H$\alpha$, and X-ray emission within the outflow, though the strengths and behaviors of these correlations vary with gas phase and distance from the starburst. PAH emission correlates strongly with cold molecular gas, with PAH--CO scaling relations in the wind nearly identical to those in galaxy disks despite the very different conditions. The H$\alpha$--PAH correlation indicates that H$\alpha$ traces the surfaces of PAH-bearing clouds, consistent with arising from ionized layers produced by shocks. Meanwhile the PAH--X-ray correlation disappears once distance effects are controlled for past 2~kpc, suggesting that PAHs are decoupled from the hot gas and the global correlation merely reflects the large-scale structure of the outflow. The PAH-to-neutral gas ratio remains nearly flat to 2~kpc, with variations following changes in the radiation field. This implies that the product of PAH abundance and dust-to-gas ratio does not change significantly over the inner portion of the outflow. Together, these results demonstrate that PAHs robustly trace the cold phase of M82's wind, surviving well beyond the starburst and providing a powerful, high-resolution proxy for mapping the life cycle of entrained cold material in galactic outflows.

 - **Abstract**
 Galactic winds play a critical role in galaxy evolution, yet their structure and driving mechanisms remain poorly understood, especially in low-luminosity AGN (LLAGN) systems. NGC 1266 hosts one such LLAGN, embedded in a massive molecular gas reservoir that is not forming stars, likely due to AGN feedback. We analyze deep archival \textit{Chandra} data to constrain the properties of its hot gas and compare them to other wind systems. We find temperatures of $0.24$--$1.85$ keV and notably high electron densities of $0.33$--$4.2$ cm$^{-3}$, suggesting significant mass loading, further supported by charge exchange emission in the southern lobe, one of the few AGN systems where it has been detected. We measure pressures and thermal energies of $10^6$--$10^8$~K cm$^{-3}$ and $10^{54}$--$10^{56}$ erg, exceeding the minimum energy needed for the radio jet to power the outflow and implying the hot phase comprises a large fraction of the energy budget. Archival MUSE data reveal a cavity-like feature in the southern outflow, potentially associated with the far side of the outflow cone. At the maximum outflow extent, the warm and hot phases appear to be in pressure equilibrium. Coupled with short cooling timescales of $\sim$1 Myr, comparable to the advection time, this suggests the outflow is undergoing radiative cooling and may have stalled. Finally, we compare NGC 1266 to other local AGN and starburst galaxies, finding NGC 1266 to be the densest wind in the sample.

 - **Abstract**
 From the luminous quasars at $z \sim 6$ to the recent $z \sim 9-11$ AGNs revealed by JWST, observations of the earliest black hole (BH) populations can provide unique constraints on BH formation and growth models. We use the BRAHMA simulations with constrained initial conditions to investigate BH assembly in extreme overdense regions. The simulations implement heavy seeds ($\sim 10^4-10^5 M_{\odot})$ forming in dense, metal-poor gas exposed to sufficient Lyman-Werner flux. With gas accretion modeled via Bondi-Hoyle formalism and BH dynamics and mergers using a subgrid dynamical friction scheme, we isolate the impact of seeding, dynamics, accretion, and feedback on early BH growth. With fiducial stellar and AGN feedback inherited from IllustrisTNG, accretion is strongly suppressed at $z \gtrsim 9$, leaving mergers as the dominant growth channel. Gas accretion dominates at $z \lesssim 9$, where permissive models (super-Eddington or low radiative efficiency) build $\sim 10^9\ M_{\odot}$ BHs powering quasars by $z \sim 6$, while stricter IllustrisTNG-based prescriptions yield much lower BH masses ($\sim 10^6-10^8\ M_{\odot}$). Our seed models strongly affect merger-driven growth at $z \gtrsim 9$: only the most lenient models (with $\sim 10^5\ M_{\odot}$ seeds) produce enough BH mergers to reach $\gtrsim 10^6\ M_{\odot}$ by $z \sim 10$, consistent with current estimates for GN-z11. Our dynamical friction model gives low merger efficiencies, hindering the buildup of $\gtrsim 10^7\ M_{\odot}$ BHs by $z \sim 9-10$, as currently inferred for GHZ9, UHZ1, and CAPERS-LRD-z9. If the BH-to-stellar mass ratios of these sources are indeed as extreme as currently inferred, they would require either very short BH merger timescales or reduced AGN thermal feedback. Weaker stellar feedback boosts both star formation and BH accretion and cannot raise these ratios.
#### Multiphase gas offsets in the atmospheres of central galaxies and their consequences for SMBH activation I. The hot and warm ionized gas phases

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the spatial relationships between multi-phase gas components and supermassive black hole (SMBH) activity in a sample of 25 cool core galaxy groups and clusters. Using high angular resolution observations from \textit{Chandra}, VLT/MUSE, and VLBA, we robustly locate the position, respectively, of the X-ray peak of the intracluster medium (ICM), of the H$\alpha$ peak of the warm ionized gas, and of the SMBH radio core on parsec scales. We identify spatial offsets between the X-ray peak of the hot gas and the SMBH in 80% of the systems, with an average displacement of $\langle\Delta^{\text{SMBH}}_{\text{X-ray}}\rangle = 4.8$ kpc (dispersion of $3.8$ kpc). In contrast, the peak of warm ionized gas traced by H$\alpha$ exhibits much smaller offsets ($\langle\Delta^{\text{SMBH}}_{\text{H}\alpha}\rangle = 0.6$ kpc; dispersion of $1.4$ kpc) and a lower incidence of displacement (15%). Our findings suggest that hot gas sloshing primarily drives the observed spatial offsets, with AGN-driven uplift contributing in some this http URL, systems with H$\alpha$ - SMBH offsets of $\geq$1 kpc uniformly lack detectable radio cores on VLBA scales, with upper limits on the 5~GHz power of $P_{5\,\text{GHz}} \leq 10^{21-22}$ W Hz$^{-1}$, while those without such offsets exhibit radio powerful AGN with pc-scale radio emission up to $P_{5\,\text{GHz}} \sim 10^{24-25}$ W Hz$^{-1}$. This correlation indicates that centrally concentrated warm gas is critical for sustaining radio-loud SMBH activity, possibly supporting scenarios of cold-mode accretion. Overall, our results highlight the importance of high-angular-resolution, multi-wavelength observations for understanding the interplay between multiphase gas cooling and AGN fueling in central galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxies with a disk morphology have been established at $z > 9$ with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). However, confirming their disky nature requires studying their gas kinematics, which can be challenging when relying solely on the warm gas observed by JWST. Unlike the cold gas traced by the Atacama Large Millimetre/Submillimetre Array (ALMA), warm gas is sensitive to outflows, complicating the interpretation of the disk dynamics. This elicits the question of how to compare information obtained from varied tracers, as well as how to physically interpret the low angular and spectral resolution observations generally available at high redshift. We address these challenges through comparative kinematic analysis of idealised and realistic NIRSpec/IFU mock observations derived from two galaxies in the SERRA suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations. With these synthetic data, we determine the robustness of dynamical information recovered from typical IFU observations, and test widely-used criteria for identifying disks and gaseous outflows at high redshift. We find that at the typical NIRSpec/IFU spectral and angular resolution ($\sim$ 0.05"/pixel), non-circular motions due to inflows or outflows can mimic the smooth velocity gradient indicative of a disk, and bias measured velocity dispersion upwards by a factor of $2-3\times$. As a result, the level of rotational support may be underestimated in the NIRSpec/IFU observations. However, the recovered dynamical mass appears to be relatively robust despite biases in $v_\text{rot}$ and $\sigma$.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a set of numerical simulations of the dynamical evolution of compact planetary systems migrating in a protoplanetary disk whose inner edge is sculpted by the interaction with the stellar magnetic field, as described in Yu et al. (2023). We demonstrate that the resulting final distribution of neighbouring planet period ratios contains only a small surviving fraction of resonant systems, in accordance with observations. The resulting planetary architectures are largely in place by the end of the protoplanetary disk phase (within a few Myr), and do not require significant later dynamical evolution. The divergence of planetary pairs during gas disk dispersal also leads to the excitation of eccentricities when pairs cross mean motion resonances in a divergent fashion. The resulting distribution of remnant free eccentricities is consistent with the values inferred from the observation of transit durations and transit timing variations. We furthermore demonstrate that this conclusion is not significantly altered by tides, assuming standard values for tidal dissipation in Earth or Neptune-class planets. These results demonstrate that the observed spacing and residual dynamical excitation of compact planetary systems can be reproduced by migration through a protoplanetary disk, as long as the inner disk boundary is modelled as a gradual rollover, instead of a sharp transition. Such an effect can be achieved when the model accounts for the diffusion of the stellar magnetic field into the disk. The resulting divergence of planetary pairs during the magnetospheric rebound phase breaks the resonant chains, resulting in a better match to observations than disk models with more traditional inner boundaries.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the discovery and characterisation of two Ly$\alpha$ nebulae (LANs), RO-1001-Sat and RO-0959-Sat, as satellite structures of two giant LANs at $z=2.920$ and 3.092. They are found neighbouring two out of four known giant LANs at $z\sim3$ in our MUSE follow-up observations, reinforcing the idea that Ly$\alpha$ emission can be used to trace massive dark matter halos at high-$z$. This high occurrence of massive satellite halos agrees with simulations. With sizes of $\simeq80\times160$ and $80\times100~\mathrm{pkpc}^2$, the two nebulae are both $\sim$300pkpc from the main LANs. The Ly$\alpha$ emission is only shifted by $\simeq100-300$ km s$^{-1}$ between each of the two pairs, suggesting connections via large-scale structure. RO-1001-Sat and RO-0959-Sat are estimated to have log$(M_\mathrm{h}/M_\odot)\simeq13.2\pm0.3$ and $12.8\pm0.3$, putting them potentially close to the regime of cold-mode accretion. The central brightest galaxies in the two halos are morphologically distinct despite having similar stellar mass $\sim10^{11}M_\odot$, one being an elliptical quiescent galaxy in RO-1001-Sat and the other being a dusty star-forming spiral in RO-0959-Sat. Intriguingly, the quiescent galaxy aligns well with the peak of the LAN as well as the potential well of the host halo, making it the first clear-cut case where the cold gas ought to be accreting onto the galaxy but with no observable star formation, either due to morphological quenching or, more likely, radio-mode feedback from an active galactic nucleus. Finally, we show a tentative detection of a Ly$\alpha$ filament connecting RO-1001 and RO-1001-Sat. This work shows how panoramic MUSE (and in the future, BlueMUSE) observations of massive halo seeds can be used to efficiently search for additional halos, unveiling their large-scale structure and enabling the study of Ly$\alpha$-selected galaxy groups.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we introduce a novel generative denoising diffusion model for synthesizing the Sun's three-dimensional coronal magnetic field, a complex and dynamic region characterized by evolving magnetic structures. Despite daily variability, these structures exhibit recurring patterns and long-term cyclic trends, presenting unique modeling challenges and opportunities at the intersection of physics and machine learning. Our generative approach employs an innovative architecture influenced by Spherical Fourier Neural Operators (SFNO), operating within the spherical harmonic domain, where the scalar field corresponds directly to the magnetic potential under physical constraints. We trained this model using an extensive dataset comprising 11.7 years of daily coupled simulations from the Air Force Data Assimilative Photospheric Flux Transport-Wang Sheeley Arge (ADAPT-WSA) model, further enhanced by data augmentation. Initial results demonstrate the model's capability to conditionally generate physically realistic magnetic fields reflective of distinct phases within the 11-year solar cycle: from solar minimum ($S = 0$) to solar maximum ($S = 1$). This approach represents a significant step toward advanced generative three-dimensional modeling in Heliophysics, with potential applications in solar forecasting, data assimilation, inverse problem-solving, and broader impacts in areas such as procedural generation of physically-informed graphical assets.

 - **Abstract**
 Eddington ratio is a paramount parameter governing the accretion history and life cycles of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). This short review presents a multi-faceted view of the importance of the Eddington ratio spanning varied AGN studies. We find that the Eddington ratio is crucial for standardizing the Radius-Luminosity (R-L) relation - a necessary step for employing quasars (QSOs) as standardizable cosmological probes to help clarify the standing of the Hubble tension. In this data-driven era, we consolidated disparate aspects by developing novel relations borne out of large datasets, such as the robust, nearly universal anti-correlation between fractional variability and Eddington ratio derived from Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) data, which is vital for interpreting forthcoming high-cadence surveys like Rubin Observatory's LSST. Addressing the conundrum where JWST results suggest an overabundance of massive high-redshift black holes, we demonstrate that local AGNs offer clarification: Changing-Look AGNs (CLAGNs), driven by rapid Eddington ratio shifts, cluster in the low-accretion regime, a rate independently confirmed by our integral field spectroscopy and photoionization modeling of a well-known Seyfert 2 galaxy, rich in high-ionization, forbidden, coronal lines. Conversely, for the high-redshift, high-luminosity population where traditional reverberation mapping (RM) is highly impractical, photometric reverberation mapping (PRM) offers a rapid alternative to constrain accretion disk sizes, enabling efficient estimates of black hole masses and Eddington ratios. Finally, we developed tailored semi-empirical spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for extremely high-accretion quasars, successfully validating their characteristic extreme physical conditions.
#### Orbital Period Changes in Recurrent Nova T Corona Borealis Prove That It Is Not a Type Ia Supernovae Progenitor

 - **Abstract**
 T Corona Borealis (T CrB) is a recurrent nova and a symbiotic star that is commonly highlighted as the best case for being a progenitor of a Type Ia supernova (SNIa) within the framework of single-degenerate models. This exemplar can be tested by measuring whether the white dwarf (WD) mass ($M_{\rm WD}$) is increasing over each eruption cycle. This is a balance between the mass ejected during each nova event ($M_{\rm ejecta}$) and the mass accreted onto the WD between the nova events ($M_{\rm accreted}$). I have used all 206 radial velocities from 1946--2024 to measure the orbital period just after the 1946 eruption to be $P_{\rm post}$=227.6043 days, while the steady orbital period change ($\dot{P}$) is ($-$3.1$\pm$1.6)$\times$10$^{-6}$. I have used my full 213,730 magnitude $B$ and $V$ light curve from 1842--2025 to measure the times of maximum brightness in the ellipsoidal modulations to construct the $O-C$ from 1866--1946. I fit the broken parabola shape, to find the orbital period immediately before the 1946 eruption to be $P_{\rm pre}$=227.4586 days. The orbital period changed by $\Delta P$=$+$0.146$\pm$0.019 days. With Kepler's Law, conservation of angular momentum, and the well-measured binary properties, the ejecta mass in 1946 is 0.00074$\pm$0.00009 M$_{\odot}$. $M_{\rm accreted}$ is reliably measured to be 1.38$\times$10$^{-6}$ M$_{\odot}$ from the accretion luminosity. $M_{\rm ejecta}$ is larger than $M_{\rm accreted}$ by 540$\times$, so $M_{\rm WD}$ is {\it decreasing} every eruption cycle. T CrB can never become a SNIa.
#### Orbital Period Changes of Recurrent Nova U Scorpii Demonstrate that M$_{\rm ejecta}$=26$\times$M$_{\rm accreted}$ and Is Not a Type Ia Supernova Progenitor

 - **Abstract**
 Recurrent nova U Scorpii (U Sco) is one of the prototypes for a Type Ia supernova progenitor. The logic is that the white dwarf is near the Chandrasekhar mass and gas is accumulating onto its surface at a near-maximal accretion rate, so it will soon increase its mass to the supernova trigger. But the white dwarf loses mass every nova eruption, so the issue is balancing the mass ejected ($M_{\rm ejecta}$) against the mass accreted between eruptions ($M_{\rm accreted}$). Measuring $M_{\rm accreted}$ can be done in several ways to useable accuracy. But the old methods for measuring $M_{\rm ejecta}$ (involving the flux in hydrogen emission lines) are all with real error bars of 2--3 orders of magnitude. The only solution is to measure the change of the orbital period across the nova eruption ($\Delta P$). But this solution requires a vast photometric program of eclipse timings stretching decades. For U Sco, a program started in 1989, now reaches its culmination with measures of $\Delta P$ for the eruptions of 1999, 2010, 2016, and 2022. This paper reports on 52 new eclipse times (for a total of 218 eclipses 1945--2025), plus a new theory result allowing for the confident calculation of $M_{\rm ejecta}$ from $\Delta P$. The four eruptions ejected a total of (103$\pm$14)$\times$$10^{-6}$ $M_{\odot}$, while the white dwarf accreted 4$\times$$10^{-6}$ $M_{\odot}$ over the four previous eruption cycles. With M$_{\rm ejecta}$=26$\times$M$_{\rm accreted}$, the U Sco white dwarf is losing large masses each eruption cycle, so U Sco can never produce a Type Ia supernova.

 - **Abstract**
 The TeV gamma-ray band is essential for probing the most extreme particle acceleration processes in the Universe. The recent detections of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) at these energies offer an incredible opportunity to investigate the origins of such transient events in an unprecedented way. In this presentation, we analyze the afterglows of these GRBs by modeling their synchrotron and inverse Compton emission within an optimized relativistic fireball framework. By comparing observational data with theoretical predictions, we constrain key model parameters and track their temporal evolution. The comparison of different TeV-detected GRBs reveals an intriguing variety among them, potentially reflecting differences in the particle acceleration processes that have to be very fast and able to accelerate to large energies. We discuss how late-time afterglow observations of X-ray and GeV-TeV emissions are crucial for providing diagnostics into the physics of GRBs. At this scope, we also present the most updated results of the AGILE telescope, which support our interpretation. Finally, we highlight theoretical predictions for future TeV observations and their implications for understanding these extreme cosmic explosions.

 - **Abstract**
 AGN jet structure and stability remain uncertain; recollimation shocks are linked to morphology and variability, but the role of downstream instabilities is still unclear. We aim to investigate how jet magnetization and other physical parameters influence the development of instabilities beyond the first recollimation shock. In particular, we focus on identifying the conditions under which the centrifugal instability (CFI) is effective. We perform high-resolution 2D and 3D simulations using the relativistic magnetohydrodynamics code PLUTO. The jets are initialized with a conical geometry and propagate into an ambient medium, and we follow by axisymmetric simulations how they evolve towards a steady-state. In 2D we explore a range of magnetizations (from 0 to 1), pressure contrasts, and inertia ratios to characterize the formation and evolution of recollimation shocks. The results are further evaluated using linear stability analysis to assess the growth and suppression of CFI. Finally, we perform 3D simulations of unstable and stable jets. We discuss how the different parameters of the axisymmetric steady solutions influence the location and strength of recollimation. We find that, even in moderately magnetized jets, $\sigma$=0.1, the CFI can still develop under suitable local conditions and disrupt the jet structure. This instability is governed by the jet radius, curvature, Lorentz factor, and magnetization, and is not always predictable from injection conditions. While magnetization can delay or locally suppress instability growth, it does not guarantee long-term jet stability. Our 3D results highlight the limitations of 2D models in capturing non-axisymmetric and nonlinear effects, and underline the complex interplay between magnetic confinement and destabilizing mechanisms. These findings have implications for interpreting variability, and polarization structure in AGN jets.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of a long-lasting burst of disk accretion in Cha J11070768-7626326 (Cha 1107-7626), a young, isolated, 5-10 M$_{\mathrm{Jupiter}}$ object. In spectra taken with XSHOOTER at ESO's Very Large Telescope as well as NIRSPEC and MIRI on the James Webb Space Telescope, the object transitions from quiescence in April-May 2025 to a strongly enhanced accretion phase in June-August 2025. The line flux changes correspond to a 6-8-fold increase in the mass accretion rate, reaching $10^{-7}$ M$_{\mathrm{Jupiter}}$yr$^{-1}$, the highest measured in a planetary-mass object. During the burst, the H$\alpha$ line develops a double-peaked profile with red-shifted absorption, as observed in stars and brown dwarfs undergoing magnetospheric accretion. The optical continuum increases by a factor of 3-6; the object is $\sim$1.5-2 mag brighter in the R-band during the burst. Mid-infrared continuum fluxes rise by 10-20%, with clear changes in the hydrocarbon emission lines from the disk. We detect water vapour emission at 6.5-7 $\mu m$, which were absent in quiescence. By the end of our observing campaign, the burst was still ongoing, implying a duration of at least two months. A 2016 spectrum also shows high accretion levels, suggesting that this object may undergo recurring bursts. The observed event is inconsistent with typical variability in accreting young stars and instead matches the duration, amplitude and line spectrum of an EXor-type burst, making Cha1107-7626 the first substellar object with evidence of a potentially recurring EXor burst.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the optical and infrared properties of a sample of 24 radio transient sources discovered in the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS). Previous studies of their radio emission showed that these sources resemble young gigahertz-peaked spectrum (GPS) radio sources, but are less powerful and characterized by low-power jets. The bursts of radio activity in most cases are likely due to intrinsic changes in the accretion processes. However, for a few sources in this sample, we cannot rule out the possibility that their radio variability results from a tidal disruption event (TDE). In this work, we extend our analysis to the optical and infrared regimes, confirming that our sample of radio transients is not homogeneous in terms of their optical and infrared properties either. The host galaxies of most of these sources are massive ellipticals with emission dominated by active galactic nuclei (AGN). They host supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with masses typical of radio-loud AGNs ($\rm >10^7\,M_{\odot}$), but exhibit very low accretion activity. In contrast, the sources for which a TDE origin is suspected are either pure star-forming galaxies or show significant ongoing star formation, similar to radio-selected optically-detected TDEs. Additionally, two of them exhibit infrared flares characteristic of TDEs, while the remaining sources do not display significant variability outside the radio regime. Moreover, the evolution of their radio brightness in the W3/radio diagnostic diagram, which we employ in our analysis, also sets our TDE candidates apart from the rest of the sample and resembles the radio variability seen in optically discovered TDEs with radio emission. Finally, based on our findings, we hypothesize that the mid-IR/radio relation can serve as a tool to distinguish between radio transients caused by TDEs and those originating from intrinsic AGN variability.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar flares are the most explosive phenomena in the solar system and the main trigger of the events' chain that starts from Coronal Mass Ejections and leads to geomagnetic storms with possible impacts on the infrastructures at Earth. Data-driven solar flare forecasting relies on either deep learning approaches, which are operationally promising but with a low explainability degree, or machine learning algorithms, which can provide information on the physical descriptors that mostly impact the prediction. This paper describes a web-based technological platform for the execution of a computational pipeline of feature-based machine learning methods that provide predictions of the flare occurrence, feature ranking information, and assessment of the prediction performances.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations from NICER in X-rays and LIGO/Virgo in gravitational waves have provided critical constraints on the mass, radius, and tidal deformability of neutron stars, imposing stringent limits on the equation of state (EOS) and the behavior of ultra-dense matter. However, several key parameters influencing the EOS, such as the maximum mass of neutron stars, spin-down rates, and the potential role of exotic matter in their cores, remain subject of ongoing debate. Here we present a new approach to constraining the EOS by analyzing the X-ray afterglows of some short gamma-ray bursts, focusing on "the internal plateau" phase and its abrupt decay, which reflect the spin-down and possible collapse of a supra-massive neutron star into a black hole. By linking critical neutron star masses with black hole formation criteria and the observational data from Swift's BAT and XRT instruments with compact object models, we explore three representative EOSs that range from "soft" to "stiff". Our result supports a maximum mass for neutron stars of approximately 2.39 solar masses at the threshold of black hole formation. This conclusion holds under assumptions of magnetar-powered X-ray plateaus, constant radiative efficiency, isotropic emission, and full Kerr black hole energy extraction; deviations could influence the inferred results. Our results demonstrate the critical role of neutron star/black hole physics in probing dense nuclear matter and provide a novel framework for exploring extreme astrophysical environments.

 - **Abstract**
 [Abridged] Optically thick, geometrically thin accretion disks around supermassive black holes are thought to contribute to broad-line emission in type-1 active galactic nuclei (AGN). However, observed emission line profiles most often deviate from those expected from a rotating disk. This report examines the role of accretion disks in broad-line emission of Population B AGN characterized by relatively low accretion rates in which broad lines show large redward asymmetry both in H$\beta$ and Mg II$\lambda$ 2800. An unbiased comparison matching black hole mass and Eddington ratio suggests that the most powerful radio-loud quasars show the highest red-ward asymmetries in H$\beta$. These shifts can be accounted for by gravitational and transverse redshift effects, especially for black hole masses larger than $\approx$10$^{8.7}$ M$_\odot$. The analysis of the extremely jetted quasar 3C 47 adds another piece to the puzzle: not only are the low ionization profiles of 3C 47 well-described by a relativistic Keplerian accretion disk model, with line emission in the range 100 - 1,000 gravitational radii, but also the high-ionization line profiles can be understood as a combination of disk plus a failed wind contribution that is in turn hiding the disk emission. Constraints on radio properties and line profile variability suggest that 3C 47 might involve the presence of a second black hole with secondary-to-primary mass ratio $\sim$ 0.5. We conjecture that the double peakers - type-1 AGN with Balmer line profiles consistent with accretion disk emission - might have their emission truncated by the sweeping effect of a second black hole. In non-starving systems, the disk signal is plausibly masked by additional line emission, rendering the disk contribution harder to detect.

 - **Abstract**
 Spacecraft measurements of Mercury indicate it has a core dynamo with a surface field of 200-800 nT. These data also indicate that the crust contains remanent magnetization likely produced by an ancient magnetic field. The inferred magnetization intensity is consistent with a wide range of paleofield strengths (0.2-50 uT), possibly indicating that Mercury once had a dynamo field much stronger than today. Recent modeling of ancient lunar impacts has demonstrated that plasma generated during basin-formation can transiently amplify a planetary dynamo field near the surface. Simultaneous impact-induced pressure waves can then record these fields in the form of crustal shock remanent magnetization (SRM). Here, we present impact hydrocode and magnetohydrodynamic simulations of a Caloris-size basin (~1,550 km diameter) formation event. Our results demonstrate that the ancient magnetospheric field (~0.5-0.9 uT) created by the interaction of the ancient interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) and Mercury's dynamo field can be amplified by the plasma up to ~13 uT and, via impact pressure waves, be recorded as SRM in the basin antipode. Such magnetization could produce ~5 nT crustal fields at 20-km altitude antipodal to Caloris detectable by future spacecraft like BepiColombo. Furthermore, impacts in the southern hemisphere that formed ~1,000 km diameter basins (e.g., Andal-Coleridge, Matisse-Repin, Eitkou-Milton, and Sadi-Scopus) could impart crustal magnetization in the northern hemisphere, contributing to the overall remanent field measured by MESSENGER. Overall, the impact plasma amplification process can contribute to crustal magnetization on airless bodies and should be considered when reconstructing dynamo history from crustal anomaly measurements.

 - **Abstract**
 Mercury is the only other terrestrial planet in the solar system with an active dynamo magnetic field (~200 nT at the equatorial surface). Furthermore, Mercury's ~3.9-3.7 billion-year old (Ga) crust is strongly magnetized (~10 nT at ~30-km altitude), indicating the presence of a past dynamo. However, the source and strength of the field that magnetized this crust are unknown. To address this, we performed three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the ancient solar wind interaction with the planetary field and coupled them with thermal cooling and magnetization models. We show that the crustal magnetization was likely produced by a surface field of at least ~2,000 nT, likely >10,000 nT (i.e., ~10x or ~50-100x stronger than at present). Such strong fields likely exclude both the solar wind feedback and thermoelectric mechanisms for driving the dynamo at 3.7 Ga ago. Instead, our results are compatible with the past dynamo being powered by an enhanced energy flux that drove strong core convection.

 - **Abstract**
 Similarly to electromagnetic (EM) signals, gravitational lensing by intervening galaxies can also affect gravitational waves (GWs). In this paper, we estimate the strong-lensing rate of massive black hole mergers observed with LISA. Given the uncertainties in the source populations as well as in the population of galaxies at high redshift, we consider: six different source population models, including light and heavy seeds, as well as three lens population models, including redshift-independent and redshift-dependent evolution properties. Among all the scenarios explored, the expected number of strong lensed events detected in a 4-year observation time in LISA ranges between 0.13-231 with most of them having two (one) images detectable in the heavy (light) seed scenarios. The event numbers obtained correspond to 0.2%-0.9% of all detected unlensed events. Out of all the detectable strong-lensed events, up to 61% (in the light-seed scenario) and 1% (in the heavy-seed scenario) of them are above the detectability threshold solely due to strong lensing effects and would otherwise be undetectable. For detectable pairs of strong-lensed events by galaxy lenses, we also find between 72%-81% of them to have time delays from 1 week to 1 year.

 - **Abstract**
 Since the advent of X-ray and EUV spectroscopy, the discovery of the First Ionization Potential (FIP) effect--where coronal elemental compositions diverge from their photospheric values based on the element's FIP--has remained a key puzzle in solar and stellar astrophysics. These deviations exhibit significant fluctuations during flares, yet their connection to plasma dynamics has remained unclear. Here, we report a clear correlation between temperature-sensitive flaring plasma emission and element-specific abundance changes for a solar flare. These findings indicate that energy deposition in the chromosphere drives plasma evaporation from different chromospheric heights, modulating elemental abundances. Hydrodynamic simulations support these observations, showing that varying energy deposition magnitudes generate plasma upflows from different chromospheric heights, leading to element-specific FIP fractionation. These results provide new insights into the dynamic coupling of flare energy, plasma flows, and abundance variability, with implications for understanding coupling between different atmospheric layers.

 - **Abstract**
 The supernova remnant (SNR) S147 contains the pulsar PSR J0538+2817 and a likely unbound binary companion, HD 37424. It is the only good Galactic candidate for a binary unbound by a core-collapse supernova (SN). Using Gaia DR3 parallaxes and photometry, we select the stars local to SNR S147 in a cylinder with a projected radius of $100$ pc and a parallax range of $0.614 < \varpi < 0.787$ mas (a length of $\simeq 360$ pc). We individually model the most luminous of these stars. The two most luminous single stars are the unbound binary companion, HD 37424, and HD 37367, with estimated masses of $(13.51\pm0.05) M_{\odot}$ and $(14.30\pm0.09) M_{\odot}$, respectively. The two most luminous binary systems are the spectroscopic binary HD 37366 and the eclipsing binary ET Tau that have primary masses of $(20.9\pm0.12) M_{\odot}$ and $(16.7\pm0.09) M_{\odot}$, respectively. We model the Gaia color-magnitude diagram (CMD) of this local stellar population using both single stars and a model consisting of noninteracting binaries using Solar metallicity PARSEC isochrones. For both models, the estimated age distributions of the $439$ $M_{G} < 0$ mag stars favor a high mass progenitor of $21.5M_{\odot}-41.1M_{\odot}$ for the SN.

 - **Abstract**
 Achieving accurate photometric characterizations of central stars of planetary nebulae (CSPNe) toward the galactic plane is significantly hindered by the high levels of interstellar extinction in these regions. However, near-infrared (NIR) observations offer a more effective alternative, as extinction is substantially reduced at these wavelengths. By mitigating the effects of interstellar extinction via NIR observations of the Galactic disk and bulge, we seek to improve the identification and characterization of CSPNe in these regions, enabling a deeper understanding of their properties and evolutionary status. We used NIR photometry from the VISTA Variables in the Vía Láctea (VVV) survey and its extension VVVX to define the NIR photometry of a large sample of CSPNe recently identified with Gaia EDR3 data. We explored the optical and NIR properties of all CSPNe in our sample and searched for eclipsing binary candidates among them by employing relevant catalogs. We present a homogeneous catalog of 1274 CSPNe, including their Z, Y, H, J, and K NIR magnitudes and errors. We also include our findings on the photometric properties of our sample. We report 14 CSPNe with a large IR excess indicating cool companions and/or surrounding discs and 56 eclipsing binary candidates. Based on the present VVVX CSPN catalog, we conclude that NIR photometry can prove valuable for further and in-depth studies of CSPNe. Subsequent studies ought to focus on exploring the true nature of the CSPNe that present IR excess as well as eclipsing-binary CSPNe candidates.

 - **Abstract**
 What triggers AGN in some galaxies and what role does this brief period of activity play in the overall evolution of galaxies are still open questions. This paper explores whether or not the local, on scales of $\approx$1\,Mpc, galaxy density plays a role in triggering AGN when controlling for stellar mass. We consider this question as a function of redshift and AGN selection in the X-ray vs. in the IR. We use available density maps within the 4.8\,this http URL. XMM-LSS field in the redshift range $0.1 < z < 1.6$. Our key result is that the environment may play a role in triggering IR AGN. In particular, at $z > 1.2$ the incidence of AGN increases in higher density environments, controlling for stellar mass. However, this dependence reverses at $z < 1.2$ where the incidence of IR AGN is higher in lower density environments. By contrast, among X-ray selected AGN there is no significant local density dependence. Bootstraping analysis confirms these conclusions. While these results agree with previous work on both obscured and unobscured AGN this is the first study to use a consistent methodology across IR and X-ray samples, as well as study IR dependence in this full redshift range. Upcoming large spectroscopic surveys such as the Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS) galaxy evolution survey will be critical in further elucidating how the environment affects AGN triggering across different cosmic epochs.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a timing study of the three known central compact object (CCO) pulsars, isolated cooling neutron stars in supernova remnants, using Chandra, XMM-Newton and NICER observations spanning two decades. Relative to canonical young pulsars, CCOs are spinning down at a very slow rate $|\dot f| <10^{-15}$ s$^{-2}$, implying a surface dipole magnetic field strength $B_s < 10^{11}$ G that is too weak to account for their X-ray emitting hot spots. Two CCO pulsars with sufficiently long monitoring, 1E 1207.4$-$5209 and PSR J0821$-$4300, are seen to deviate from steady spin-down; their timing residuals can be modeled by one or more glitches in $f$ and $\dot f$, or alternatively by extreme timing noise. For the third CCO pulsar, PSR J1852+0400, the sparse temporal coverage was insufficient to detect such effects. Glitch activity and timing noise in large samples of rotation-powered pulsars correlate best with $\dot f$, while the timing irregularities of the first two CCOs are extreme compared to pulsars of the same $\dot f$. Nevertheless, timing activity in CCOs may arise from properties that they share with other young but more energetic pulsars: high internal temperature, strong buried magnetic field and superfluid behavior. Alternatively, continuing low-level accretion of supernova debris is not ruled out as a source of timing noise in CCOs.

 - **Abstract**
 The Milky Way's inner region is dominated by a stellar bar and a boxy-peanut shaped bulge. However, which stellar populations inhabit the inner Galaxy or how star formation proceeded there is still unknown. The difficulty in studying these stars stems from their location in dense regions that are strongly impacted by extinction and crowding effects. In this work, we use star formation histories computed in the solar neighbourhood using Gaia Colour-Magnitude Diagram fitting to shed light onto the evolution of the central regions of our Galaxy. For that, we have obtained precise age distributions for the non-negligible amount of super metal-rich stars ([M/H] $\sim$ 0.5) in the solar neighbourhood (more than 5$\%$ of the total stars within 400 pc of the plane). Assuming that these stars were born in the inner Galaxy and migrated outwards, those distributions should be indicative of the true stellar age distribution in the inner Galaxy. Surprisingly, we find that these age distributions are not continuous but show clear signs of episodic star formation ($\sim$~13.5, 10.0, 7.0, 4.0, 2.0 and less than 1~Gyr ago). Interestingly, with the exception of the 4~Gyr event, the timings of the detected events coincide with the formation of the primitive Milky Way and with known merging events or satellite encounters (Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage, Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, and the Magellanic Clouds), suggesting that these could have induced enhanced and global star-forming episodes. These results are compatible with a scenario in which Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage is responsible for the formation of the bar 10 Gyr ago. However, we cannot associate any accretion counterpart with the 4-Gyr-ago event, leaving room for a late formation of the bar, as previously proposed. A qualitative comparison with the Auriga Superstars simulations suggesting a possible link to bar dynamics and satellite accretion. [Abridged]

 - **Abstract**
 We present an updated catalog of stellar rotation periods for the 2.5 Gyr open cluster NGC 6819 using the Kepler IRIS light curves from superstamp data. Our analysis uses Gaussian Process modeling to extract robust rotation signals from image subtraction light curves, allowing us unprecedented data access and measurement precision in the crowded cluster field. After applying stringent quality and contamination cuts, we identify 271 reliable rotation periods, representing by far the largest sample of rotators measured in a single intermediate-age cluster. Compared to previous work, which relied on only ~30 stars, our catalog extends the gyrochronological sequence of NGC 6819 with an order of magnitude more measurements and improved precision. The expanded dataset reveals both the expected temperature-dependent spin-down trend and substantial scatter at fixed effective temperature, including a bimodal distribution of fast and slow rotators. We also identify a distinct ``pile-up'' sequence consistent with predictions of weakened magnetic braking at critical Rossby numbers. These results strengthen this cluster's role as a benchmark for stellar spin evolution, while also highlighting the limitations of traditional gyrochronology at older ages. The final catalog and the model implementations are all available on Zenodo.

 - **Abstract**
 In many areas of extragalactic astrophysics, we need to convert the luminosity of a galaxy into its stellar mass. In this work, we aim to find a simple and effective formula to estimate the stellar mass from the images of galaxies delivered by the currently popular DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys. This survey provides an unsurpassed combination of a deep imaging with an extensive sky coverage in up to four photometric bands. We calibrated the sought formula against a sample of local galaxies observed by the Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies (S$^4$G) that was directly dedicated to measure the stellar masses. For the absolute magnitudes $M_g$ and $M_r$ of a galaxy in the Legacy Surveys $g$ and $r$ bands, we find that the stellar masses can be estimated as $0.673M_g - 1.108M_r + 0.996$ with the scatter of 25\%. Employing more complex functions does not improve the estimate appreciably, even after including the galaxy ellipticity, Sérsic index, or the magnitudes in different Legacy Surveys bands. Generally, measurements in $r$ band were the most helpful ones, while adding $z$-band measurements did not improve the mass estimate much. We provide a Python-based script \texttt{photomass\this http URL} to automatically download images of any galaxy from the Legacy Surveys database, create image masks, generate GALFIT input files with well-assessed initial values, perform the GALFIT photometry, and calculate the stellar mass estimate. Additionally, we tuned another version of the formula to the magnitudes provided by the Siena Galaxy Atlas 2020 (SGA-2020) with a scatter of 29\%. For both\,--\,our default and SGA-2020 formula, we offer two alternatives derived from different calibrations of S$^4$G masses that were based on different methods and assumptions.

 - **Abstract**
 Supermassive black hole binary systems (SMBHBs) are thought to emit the recently discovered nHz gravitational wave background; however, not a single individual nHz source has been confirmed to date. Long-term radio-monitoring at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory has revealed two potential SMBHB candidates: blazars PKS 2131-021 and PKS J0805-0111. These sources show periodic flux density variations across the electromagnetic spectrum, signaling the presence of a good clock. To explain the emission, we propose a generalizable jet model, where a mildly relativistic wind creates an outward-moving helical channel, along which the ultra-relativistic jet propagates. The observed flux variation from the jet is mostly due to aberration. The emission at lower frequency arises at larger radius and its variation is consequently delayed, as observed. Our model reproduces the main observable features of both sources and can be applied to other sources as they are discovered. We make predictions for radio polarization, direct imaging, and emission line variation, which can be tested with forthcoming observations. Our results motivate future numerical simulations of jetted SMBHB systems and have implications for the fueling, structure, and evolution of blazar jets.

 - **Abstract**
 The ADF22 line survey reported detections of two high-$z$ line-emitting source candidates above 6-$\sigma$, both of which were shown to be spurious after follow-up observations. We investigate the detectability of far-infrared emitters in ALMA deep fields using mock observations by injecting artificial line-emitting sources into the visibility planes. We also discuss our investigation, conducted together with the ALMA operations team, of a possible technical problem in the original observations. Finally, we devise a method to estimate the [CII] luminosity function (LF) at $z \sim 6$, including a full analysis of signal contamination and sample completeness. The comparison of pixel distributions between the real and mock datacubes does not show significant differences, confirming that the effect of non-Gaussian noise is negligible for the ADF22 datacube. Using 100 blank mock-mosaic datasets, we show 0.43 $\pm$ 0.67 false detections per datacube with the previous source-finding method. We argue that the underestimation of the contamination rate in the previous work is caused by the smaller number of datacubes, using only 4 real ADF22 datacubes. We compare the results of clump-finding between the time division mode and frequency division mode correlator datacubes and confirm that the velocity widths of the clumps in the TDM case are up to 3 times wider than in the FDM case. The LF estimation using our model shows that a correction for the number count is required, up to one order of magnitude, in the luminosity range of $\geq 5 \times 10^8 L_\odot$. Our reconstruction method for the line LF can be applied to future blind line surveys.
