 - **Abstract**
 Context: Most active galactic nuclei (AGN) are believed to be surrounded by a dusty molecular torus on the parsec scale which is often embedded within a larger circumnuclear disk (CND). AGN are fuelled by the inward transport of material through these structures and can launch multi-phase outflows that influence the host galaxy through AGN feedback. Aims: We use the Circinus Galaxy as a nearby laboratory to investigate the physical mechanisms responsible for feeding the torus and launching a multi-phase outflow in this Seyfert-type AGN, as these mechanisms remain poorly understood. Methods: We analysed observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array of the Circinus nucleus at angular resolutions down to 13 mas (0.25 pc). We traced dust and the ionised outflow using 86-665 GHz continuum emission, and studied the morphology and kinematics of the molecular gas. Results: We find that the Circinus CND hosts molecular and dusty spiral arms, two of which connect directly to the torus. We detect inward mass transport along these structures and argue that the non-axisymmetric potential generated by these arms is the mechanism responsible for fuelling the torus. We estimate a feeding rate of 0.3-7.5 M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$, implying that over 88% of the inflowing material is expelled in a multi-phase outflow before reaching the accretion disk. The inferred torus feeding time scale (120 kyr - 2.7 Myr) suggests that variability in AGN activity may be driven by changes in torus feeding. On parsec scales, the ionised outflow is traced by optically thin free-free emission. The outflow is stratified, with a slightly wider opening angle in the molecular phase than in the dusty and ionised components. The ionised outflow is launched or collimated by a warped accretion disk at a radius of r ~ 0.16 pc, and its geometry requires an anisotropic launching mechanism.

 - **Abstract**
 The background light produced by emission from all sources over cosmic history is a powerful diagnostic of structure formation and evolution. At near-infrared wavelengths, this extragalactic background light (EBL) is comprised of emission from galaxies stretching all the way back to the first-light objects present during the Epoch of Reionization. The Cosmic Infrared Background Experiment 2 (CIBER-2) is a sounding-rocket experiment designed to measure both the absolute photometric brightness of the EBL over 0.5 - 2.0 microns and perform an intensity mapping measurement of EBL spatial fluctuations in six broad bands over the same wavelength range. CIBER-2 comprises a 28.5 cm, 80K telescope that images several square degrees to three separate cameras. Each camera is equipped with an HAWAII-2RG detector covered by an assembly that combines two broadband filters and a linear-variable filter, which perform the intensity mapping and absolute photometric measurements, respectively. CIBER-2 has flown three times: an engineering flight in 2021; a terminated launch in 2023; and a successful science flight in 2024. In this paper, we review the science case for the experiment; describe the factors motivating the instrument design; review the optical, mechanical, and electronic implementation of the instrument; present preflight laboratory characterization measurements; and finally assess the instrument's performance in flight.

 - **Abstract**
 We present radial profiles of surface brightness in UV and IR bands, estimate stellar mass surface density ($\Sigma_\star$) and star formation rate surface density ($\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR}$), and predict the CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor ($\alpha_\mathrm{CO}$) for over 5,000 local galaxies with stellar mass $M_\star\,{\geq}\,10^{9.3}\rm\,M_\odot$. We build these profiles and measure galaxy half-light radii using GALEX and WISE images from the $z$0MGS program, with special care given to highly inclined galaxies. From the UV and IR surface brightness profiles, we estimate $\Sigma_\star$ and $\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR}$ and use them to predict $\alpha_\mathrm{CO}$ with state-of-the-art empirical prescriptions. We validate our (kpc-scale) $\alpha_\mathrm{CO}$ predictions against observational estimates, finding the best agreement when accounting for CO-dark gas as well as CO emissivity and excitation effects. The CO-dark correction plays a primary role in lower-mass galaxies, whereas CO emissivity and excitation effects become more important in higher-mass and more actively star-forming galaxies, respectively. We compare our estimated $\alpha_\mathrm{CO}$ to observed galaxy-integrated SFR to CO luminosity ratio as a function of $M_\star$. A large compilation of literature data suggests that star-forming galaxies with $M_\star = 10^{9.5{-}11}\,M_\odot$ show strong anti-correlations of SFR/$L^\prime_\mathrm{CO(1{-}0)} \propto M_\star^{-0.29}$ and SFR/$L^\prime_\mathrm{CO(2{-}1)} \propto M_\star^{-0.40}$. The estimated $\alpha_\mathrm{CO}$ trends, when combined with a constant molecular gas depletion time $t_\mathrm{dep}$, can only explain ${\approx}1/3$ of these SFR/$L^\prime_\mathrm{CO}$ trends. This suggests that $t_\mathrm{dep}$ being systematically shorter in lower-mass star-forming galaxies is the main cause of the observed SFR/$L^\prime_\mathrm{CO}$ variations. (Abridged)

 - **Abstract**
 We study the stellar mass-iron metallicity relation of dwarf galaxies in the new high-resolution MEGATRON cosmological radiation-hydrodynamics simulations. These simulations model galaxy formation up to $z\approx8$ in a region that will collapse into a Milky-Way-like galaxy at $z=0$, while self-consistently tracking Population III and II (Pop.~III, Pop.~II) star formation, feedback and chemical enrichment. MEGATRON dwarf galaxies are in excellent agreement with the observed stellar mass-metallicity relation at $z=0$, including an over-abundance of dwarfs along a flat plateau in metallicity ($\langle [\rm{Fe}/\rm{H}] \rangle \approx -2.5$) at low stellar masses ($M_{\star} \leq 10^5 \, \rm{M}_{\odot}$). We tie this feature to the chemical enrichment of dwarf galaxies by Pop.~III pair-instability supernova (PISN) explosions. The strong Lyman-Werner background (LW) from the protogalaxy ensures that PISNe occur in haloes massive enough ($\approx 10^7\, \rm{M}_{\odot}$) to retain their ejecta. We also predict a tail of $\approx 20\%$ of iron-deficient ($\langle [\rm{Fe}/\rm{H}] \rangle \leq - 3$) dwarf galaxies. We show that both plateau and tail (i) are robust to large variations in Pop.~II feedback assumptions, and (ii) survive in bound satellites surrounding the central galaxy at $z=0$.

 - **Abstract**
 The increasing use of ML in astronomy introduces important questions about interpretability. Due to their complexity and non-linear nature, it can be challenging to understand their decision-making process. While these models can effectively identify unusual spectra, interpreting the physical nature of the flagged outliers remains a major challenge. We aim to bridge the gap between anomaly detection and physical understanding by combining deep learning with interpretable ML (iML) techniques to identify and explain anomalous galaxy spectra from SDSS data. We present a flexible framework that uses a variational autoencoder to compute multiple anomaly scores, including physically-motivated variants of the mean squared error. We adapt the iML LIME algorithm to spectroscopic data, systematically explore segmentation and perturbation strategies, and compute explanation weights that identify the features most responsible for each detection. To uncover population-level trends, we normalize the LIME weights and apply clustering to the top 1\% most anomalous spectra. Our approach successfully separates instrumental artifacts from physically meaningful outliers and groups anomalous spectra into astrophysically coherent categories. These include dusty, metal-rich starbursts; chemically-enriched H\,II regions with moderate excitation; and extreme emission-line galaxies with low metallicity and hard ionizing spectra. The explanation weights align with established emission-line diagnostics, enabling a physically-grounded taxonomy of spectroscopic anomalies. Our work shows that interpretable anomaly detection provides a scalable, transparent, and physically meaningful approach to exploring large spectroscopic datasets. Our framework opens the door for incorporating interpretability tools into quality control, follow-up targeting, and discovery pipelines in current and future surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs) generate powerful relativistic jets that inject a large amount of energy into their surrounding environment, producing blast waves that accelerate particles to high energies. The GRB afterglow radiation provides a powerful means to investigate the microphysics of relativistic shocks and to probe the medium surrounding the progenitor of the burst. In this study, we present a comprehensive multiwavelength analysis of 31 GRBs observed between 2008 and 2024 from the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory (X-ray Telescope and Burst Alert Telescope) and the Fermi Large Area Telescope, covering photon energies from 0.3 keV to 300 GeV. Our goal is to characterize the broadband spectral properties of GRB afterglows in soft X-rays, hard X-rays, and high-energy gamma rays. We investigate correlations between spectral shape and energy output across different parts of the spectrum. The observed emission is modeled using a forward shock scenario that includes both synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) radiation losses. The results favor an SSC-dominated radiation model in a wind-like medium, consistent with expectations for long-duration GRBs. Crucially, this work provides new benchmarks for the microphysical parameters governing the emission, particularly indicating a notably low magnetic energy fraction, which refines previous estimates. By modeling broadband data, this study offers one of the most detailed SSC analyses in a wind-like environment to date. Notably, our results naturally account for the comparable energy output observed in both the soft X-ray and TeV bands, consistent with the previously detected TeV-GRBs.

 - **Abstract**
 Hydrodynamic escape can strip the envelopes of close-in exoplanets, but most observations of atmospheric mass loss to date have been confined to planets orbiting K and M dwarfs. A growing body of detections of atmospheric escape from planets orbiting early-type stars indicates that they may have significantly stronger and more extended outflows than planets orbiting cooler stars. However, it is unclear whether this limited sample of planets is representative of all gas giants orbiting early-type stars. Motivated by this question, we initiated the first dedicated survey of atmospheric escape from gas giants orbiting F stars in order to understand how their distinct radiation environments shape planetary outflows. We observed ten transits of six planets in an ultra-narrowband filter centered on the metastable helium line using Palomar/WIRC. We report strong ($>3\sigma$) detections of atmospheric escape for WASP-12~b and WASP-180~A~b, tentative ($>2\sigma$) detections for WASP-93~b and HAT-P-8~b, and non-detections for WASP-103~b and KELT-7~b. We fit these measurements with a 1D Parker wind model to derive corresponding mass-loss rates, and combine our results with literature measurements to obtain an updated picture of mass loss from planets orbiting early-type stars. Our results indicate that the observed variation in mass-loss rates can be explained by a combination of Roche filling factor and XUV luminosity, and disfavors NUV-driven escape models.
#### Central Massive Black Holes Are Not Ubiquitous in Local Low-Mass Galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 The black-hole occupation fraction ($f_\mathrm{occ}$) defines the fraction of galaxies that harbor central massive black holes (MBHs), irrespective of their accretion activity level. While it is widely accepted that $f_\mathrm{occ}$ is nearly 100% in local massive galaxies with stellar masses $M_\star \gtrsim 10^{10}~M_\odot$, it is not yet clear whether MBHs are ubiquitous in less-massive galaxies. In this work, we present new constraints on $f_\mathrm{occ}$ based on over 20 years of Chandra imaging data for 1606 galaxies within 50 Mpc. We employ a Bayesian model to simultaneously constrain $f_\mathrm{occ}$ and the specific accretion-rate distribution function, $p(\lambda)$, where the specific accretion rate is defined as $\lambda=L_\mathrm{X}/M_\star$, and $L_\mathrm{X}$ is the MBH accretion luminosity in the 2-10 keV range. Notably, we find that $p(\lambda)$ peaks around $10^{28}~\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}}~M_\odot^{-1}$; above this value, $p(\lambda)$ decreases with increasing $\lambda$, following a power-law that smoothly connects with the probability distribution of bona-fide active galactic nuclei. We also find that the occupation fraction decreases dramatically with decreasing $M_\star$: in high mass galaxies ($M_\star \approx 10^{11-12}M_\odot$), the occupation fraction is $>93\%$ (a $2\sigma$ lower limit), and then declines to $66_{-7}^{+8}\%$ ($1\sigma$ errors) between $M_\star\approx10^{9-10}M_\odot$, and to $33_{-9}^{+13}\%$ in the dwarf galaxy regime between $M_\star\approx10^{8-9}~M_\odot$. Our results have significant implications for the normalization of the MBH mass function over the mass range most relevant for tidal disruption events, extreme mass ratio inspirals, and MBH merger rates that upcoming facilities are poised to explore.

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray bursts are flashes of high-energy radiation lasting from a fraction of a second to several hours. Military satellites made the first detections of GRBs in the late 1960s. The $\gamma$-ray emission forms from shocks in a relativistic jet launched from a compact central engine. In addition to the emission of $\gamma$-rays, the interaction of the jet with the surrounding medium yields afterglow emission that can be observed across the electromagnetic spectrum. Redshift measurements from these afterglows place GRBs from the local to the distant Universe. The central engines of GRBs are thought to be either a hyperaccreting black hole or a highly magnetized neutron star (magnetar). There is now strong observational evidence that this central engine is created either in the core collapse of a rapidly rotating massive star or via the merger of two compact objects (neutron stars or a neutron star with a black hole). The combination of stellar scale events with extreme energies and luminosities makes GRBs powerful probes of the extreme physics involved in their production and of other areas of astrophysics and cosmology. These include as the electromagnetic counterparts of gravitational wave sources, the production and acceleration of relativistic jets, the synthesis of heavy elements, the study of the interstellar and intergalactic medium, and the identification of the collapse of early generations of stars.

 - **Abstract**
 The James Webb Space Telescope has found an unexpected population of high-mass galaxies ($\log (M^\star / {\rm M} _\odot) \gtrsim 10$) with extremely small effective radii ($\sim 100\,\rm pc$) at $z \gtrsim 6$. Also, the existence of an unusual size--mass relation has been claimed. These observations are only partially reproduced by current models, and the physics responsible for the observed relations is still under debate. We expect to unveil the formation channels of the observed compact galaxies. We analyse 7605 snapshots for 169 galaxies of the state-of-the-art cosmological simulation suite FirstLight. We find that galaxies undergo an expansion--compaction--re-expansion process. This process operates in a specific mass range; compaction starts at $\log (M^\star_ {\rm on} / {\rm M}_\odot) \sim 8.5$ and ends at $\log (M^\star_{\rm off} / \mathrm{M}_\odot) \sim 9.5$. In between these masses, the size--mass relation becomes inverted, with a negative slope. The physical mechanism driving this process in our simulations involves a self-reinforced inflow of gas from the outer regions, that triggers a strong, localised starburst at the centre (within $1\, {\rm kpc}$). This contraction continues until conditions favour star formation in a broader area, and the normal inside-out growth pattern resumes. We present evidence for the existence of a universal wet compaction operating at Cosmic Dawn. This mechanism is driven by spherical accretion triggered by the change of the state of the central matter of galaxies, from dark matter- to baryon-dominated. We also propose an analytical expression for the infall process, suitable for use in semi-analytic models. Contrary to low-redshift galaxies, in high-redshift systems compaction ends without gas depletion and star-formation quenching.

 - **Abstract**
 The James Webb Space Telescope is orders of magnitude more sensitive than any other facility across the near to mid-infrared wavelengths. Many approved programs take advantage of its highly stable point spread function (PSF) to directly detect faint companions using diverse high-contrast imaging (HCI) techniques. However, periodic re-phasing of the Optical Telescope Element (OTE) is required due to slow thermal drifts distorting to the primary mirror backplane along with stochastic tilt events on individual mirror segments. Many programs utilize observations of a reference star to remove the stellar contribution within an image which can typically take half of the total allocated time. We present a high-contrast imaging technique for the NIRISS instrument that uses the measured wavefront error (WFE) from a phase calibration observation (performed roughly every 48 hours) as prior information in a Bayesian analysis with nested sampling. This technique estimates the WFE of a given observation and simultaneously searches for faint companions, without using a reference star. We estimate the wavefront error for both full aperture and aperture masking interferometry (AMI) imaging modes using three low order Zernike coefficients per mirror segment, using the Hexike basis, to generate synthetic PSFs and compare to simulations. We compare our technique to traditional interferometric analysis in realistic NIRISS F430M simulations both relative to the photon noise limit, and through recovering an injected companion with $\Delta$F430M= 8 mag at 0.2''. With future testing, this technique may save significant amounts of observing time given the results of our current implementation on NIRISS simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 We present VLT/X-shooter spectroscopy of the extremely metal-poor starburst galaxy SBS 0335-052E, a nearby (D $\sim$54 Mpc) analog of high-redshift systems, probing its outflow up to a distance of $\sim$2.6 kpc. Using direct-method oxygen abundances, we find a complex metallicity profile that generally declines with distance, decreasing by 0.37 dex from the galaxy center out to 2.4 kpc into the outflow. This implies a metal-loading factor roughly an order of magnitude lower than predictions based on the mass-metallicity relation for low-mass galaxies. We also detect extended HeII emission, including a broad, redshifted component beyond 2 kpc, distinct from narrow emission associated with star clusters. No H$\beta$ emission is detected associated with the broad redshifted component, implying extremely high HeII/H$\beta$ ratios (0.7--4.8). Such extreme values, combined with the decreasing metallicity, challenge current models for stellar feedback. The contribution of an intermediate-mass black hole could simultaneously account for the declining metallicity and the unusually extended HeII emission.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we present a comprehensive observational and modeling study of a geo-effective event with D_ST index of -80 nT observed on 2011 May 28 when a coronal hole was bordering an active region. We analyze HMI and EUV images and found that this event involved two filament eruptions ~8 hours apart from two different active region closed to each other. We produce 3D magnetic field configurations for the active regions that are consistent with the observations and employ numerical models to track the CME/ICME propagation up to 1\,au. From our, magnetic models we found that the nearby coronal hole reduced the stability threshold of the flux ropes, with axial flux values approximately three times lower than in comparable cases without coronal holes. A derivative analysis applied to STEREO coronagraph and OMNI database in situ data revealed no evidence of CME-CME interaction during the early stages of their evolution and identified distinct signatures of two CMEs, along with the interacting flow associated with the nearby coronal hole at 1 au. Moreover, we used hydrodynamic simulations constrained by remote sensing and in situ data to track the different structures in the solar wind. We found a good agreement between data and the models. Additionally, we found that the presence of the coronal hole may have suppressed interactions between CMEs, with the transients subsequently propagating along the solar wind streams emerging from the coronal hole.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of bursty star-formation histories (SFHs) of 346 star-forming galaxies at $1\lesssim z<7$, selected from JWST/NIRSpec G395M and PRISM spectroscopy provided by the CEERS and RUBIES surveys. We analyze the correlation of star-formation rate vs. stellar mass (the star-forming main sequence, SFMS) for our sample and find no significant difference between the intrinsic scatter in the H$\alpha$-based SFMS and the UV-continuum-based SFMS. However, the diagnostic power of the SFMS is limited at high redshift and low stellar mass due to observational biases that exclude faint, quenched galaxies. To more directly probe star-formation variability, we examine the dust-corrected H$\alpha$-to-UV ratio, which is assumed to trace deviations a from constant SFH over the past $\sim100$ Myr. In our sample, $73^{+4}_{-4}$% of galaxies exhibit H$\alpha$-to-UV ratios inconsistent with a constant SFH. We do not observe any statistically significant evolution in the H$\alpha$-to-UV ratio with redshift. Additionally, lower-mass galaxies ($7\leq\text{log}(M_*/M_{\odot})<8.5$) are $30 \pm 1$% more likely to lie above this equilibrium range -- indicative of a recent ($\lesssim 100$ Myr) burst of star formation -- compared to higher-mass systems ($8.5\leq\text{log}(M_*/M_{\odot})\leq10.9$). These results suggest that bursty SFHs are more common in low-mass galaxies at $z\sim 1$-$7$ and that this remains relatively stable across $\sim0.8$-$6$ Gyr after the Big Bang.

It reached a peak magnitude of -18.88 $\pm$ 0.13 mag in the $r$ band and exhibited an initial rapid decline of 4.05 $\pm$ 0.14 mag (100 d)$^{-1}$ from peak luminosity till $\sim$30 d. The photospheric phase is short, with the SN displaying bluer colours and a weak H$\alpha$ absorption component--features consistent with other luminous, short-photospheric phase Type II SNe. A distinct transition from the photospheric to the radioactive tail phase in the $V$ band--as is common in hydrogen-rich Type II SNe--is not visible in SN 2021tsz, although a modest $\sim$1 mag drop is apparent in the redder filters. Hydrodynamic modelling suggests the luminosity is powered by ejecta-circumstellar material (CSM) interaction during the early phases (<30 days). Interaction with 0.6 M$_\odot$ of dense CSM extending to 3100 R$_\odot$ reproduces the observed luminosity, with an explosion energy of 1.3$\times$10$^{51}$ erg. The modelling indicates a pre-SN mass of 9 M$_\odot$, which includes a hydrogen envelope of 4 M$_\odot$, and a radius of $\sim$1000 R$_\odot$. Spectral energy distribution analysis and strong-line diagnostics reveal that the host galaxy of SN 2021tsz is a low-metallicity, dwarf galaxy. The low-metallicity environment and the derived high mass loss from the hydrodynamical modelling strongly support a binary progenitor system for SN 2021tsz.

 We present detailed analysis of an active region coronal jet accompanying a minifilament eruption that is fully captured and well-resolved in high spatial resolution 174A coronal images from Solar Orbiters Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI). The active region jet is simultaneously observed by the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) and the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). An erupting minifilament is rooted at the edge of an active region where mixed-polarity magnetic flux is present. Minority-polarity positive flux merges and cancels with the active regions dominant negative flux at an average rate of 1019 Mx/hr, building a minifilament-holding flux rope and triggering its eruption. The eruption shows a slow rise followed by a fast rise, akin to large-scale filament eruptions. EUI images and Mg II k spectra, displaying simultaneously blueshifts and redshifts at the opposite edges of the spire, indicate counterclockwise untwisting of the jet spire. This jet is the clearest, most comprehensively observed active-region jet with this instrument set, displaying striking similarities with quiet Sun and coronal hole jets. Its magnetic, thermal, and kinetic energies suggest a significant contribution to local coronal heating. We conclude that magnetic flux cancelation builds a minifilament-carrying twisted flux rope and also eventually triggers the flux ropes eruption that makes the coronal jet, in line with our recent results on the buildup and explosion of solar coronal jets in quiet Sun and coronal holes. That is, this active region jet clearly works the same way as the vast majority of quiet Sun and coronal hole jets.

 - **Abstract**
 The potential field source surface (PFSS) method is a widely used magnetic field extrapolation technique in the space weather community. The only free parameter in the PFSS method is the source-surface height ($R_{\rm SS}$), beyond which all field lines are open. Although $R_{\rm SS}$ is known to vary with solar activity, there is no consensus on how to determine it for a given surface magnetic field distribution. In this study, we investigate the nature of $R_{\rm SS}$ using a long-period (2006-2023) data, covering two solar minima and one maximum. We adopt ADAPT-GONG magnetograms and determine $R_{\rm SS}$ by matching the open flux estimated from observations at 1 au with that calculated using the PFSS method. Our analysis reveals that $R_{\rm SS}$ increases slightly after the solar minima and around the solar maximum, and that it can be characterized by both the mean unsigned photospheric magnetic field strength and the dipolarity parameter $f_{\rm dip}$, defined as $f_{\rm dip} = B_{\rm dip}^2/(B_{\rm dip}^2 + B_{\rm quad}^2 + B_{\rm oct}^2)$, with $B_{\rm dip}$, $B_{\rm quad}$, and $B_{\rm oct}$ denoting the magnitudes of dipolar, quadrupolar, and octupolar components of photospheric radial magnetic field, respectively. Our results suggest that $R_{\rm SS}$ does not exhibit a simple monotonic dependence on the solar activity and must be determined by properly considering both surface magnetic field strength and global field structure.

 - **Abstract**
 Combined survey analyses of galaxy clustering and weak gravitational lensing (3x2-pt studies) will allow new and accurate tests of the standard cosmological model. However, careful validation is necessary to ensure that these cosmological constraints are not biased by uncertainties associated with the modelling of astrophysical or systematic effects. In this study we validate the combined 3x2-pt analysis of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 1 (DESI-DR1) spectroscopic galaxy clustering and overlapping weak lensing datasets from the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS), the Dark Energy Survey (DES), and the Hyper-Suprime-Cam Survey (HSC). By propagating the modelling uncertainties associated with the non-linear matter power spectrum, non-linear galaxy bias and baryon feedback, we design scale cuts to ensure that measurements of the matter density and the amplitude of the matter power spectrum are biased by less than 30% of the statistical error. We also test the internal consistency of the data and weak lensing systematics by performing new measurements of the lensing shear ratio. We demonstrate that the DESI-DR1 shear ratios can be successfully fit by the same model used to describe cosmic shear correlations, and analyse the additional information that can be extracted about the source redshift distributions and intrinsic alignment parameters. This study serves as crucial preparation for the upcoming cosmological parameter analysis of these datasets.

 - **Abstract**
 The luminosity distance-redshift ($D_{\rm L}$--$z$) relation derived from Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) yields evidence for a nonzero cosmological constant. SNe Ia analyses typically fit to the functional form $D_{\rm L}(z)$ derived theoretically from the homogeneous and isotropic Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric. Yet, the metric in the epoch relevant to SNe Ia measurements deviates slightly from FLRW due to gravitational clumping of mass into large-scale structures like filaments and voids, whose sizes span many orders of magnitude. The small deviation is modeled typically by scalar perturbations to the FLRW metric. Each line of sight to a SNe Ia passes through a random sequence of structures, so $D_{\rm L}$ differs stochastically from one line of sight to the next. Here, we calculate the $D_{\rm L}$ dispersion in an exact Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi Swiss-cheese universe with a power-law hole size distribution, as a function of the lower cut-off $R_{\rm min}$ and logarithmic slope $\gamma$. We find that the standard deviation of $D_{\rm L}$ scales as $\sigma_{D_{\rm L}} \propto z^{2.25\pm0.01} (R_{\rm min}/24\pm1\,{\rm Mpc})^{(0.157\pm0.003)\left[\gamma - (1.16\pm0.02)\right]}$ for redshifts in the range $0.5 \lesssim z \lesssim 2.1$. The scaling shows that the $D_{\rm L}$ dispersion is dominated by a few large voids rather than the many small voids.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyzed Insight-HXMT data of the black hole X-ray binary MAXI J1348-630 during the type-B QPO phase of its 2019 outburst. Using the Gaussian process method, we applied an additive composite kernel model consisting of an SHO, a DRW, and an additional white noise (AWN) to data from three energy bands: LE (1-10 keV), ME (10-30 keV), and HE (30-150 keV). We find that for the DRW component, correlations on the timescale of $\tau_{\rm DRW}\sim10$ s are absent in the LE band, while they persist in the ME and HE bands over the full duration of the light curves. This energy-dependent behavior may reflect thermal instabilities, with the shorter correlation timescale in the disk compared to the corona. Alternatively, it may reflect variable Comptonizations of seed photons from different disk regions. Inner-disk photons are scattered by a small inner corona, producing soft X-rays. Outer-disk photons interact with an extended, jet-like corona, resulting in harder emission. The QPO is captured by an SHO component with a stable period of $\sim 0.2$ s and a high quality factor of $\sim 10$. The absence of significant evolution with energy or time of the SHO component suggests a connection between the accretion disk and the corona, which may be built by coherent oscillations of disk-corona driven by magnetorotational instability. The AWN components are present in all the three-band data and dominate over the DRW and SHO components. We interpret the AWN as another fast DRW with its $\tau_{\rm DRW} < 0.01$ s. It may trace high-frequency fluctuations that occur in both the inner region of the accretion disk and the corona. Overall, our work reveals a timescale hierarchy in the coupled disk-corona scenario: fast DRW < SHO < disk DRW < corona DRW.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive long-term multi-wavelength study of the active galactic nucleus (AGN) NGC 3822, based on 17 years (2008 to 2025) of X-ray, ultraviolet (UV), and optical this http URL dataset includes observations from Swift, XMM-Newton, and NuSTAR, the Very Large Telescope, and the Himalayan Chandra Telescope. Our multiwavelength light curve analysis reveals flux variations across X-ray to optical/UV bands, with an increased variability amplitude at shorter wavelengths. X-ray spectral analysis indicates the presence of intrinsic absorption during the 2016 and 2022 observations; however, this absorption disappeared before and after these epochs. The presence and absence of the absorber are attributed to clouds moving in and out of the line of sight. During the long-term monitoring period, the bolometric luminosity of the source varies between ($1.32-17)\times10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Optical spectroscopic monitoring reveals changing-look (CL) behaviour in NGC~3822, characterized by the appearance and disappearance of broad emission lines (BELs). These CL transitions are associated with changes in the Eddington ratio rather than changes in the obscuration. The BELs appear only when the Eddington ratio is relatively high ($\sim 3.8\times10^{-3}$) and disappear when it drops to a lower value ($\sim 0.9\times10^{-3}$).

 - **Abstract**
 It has been proposed that the stellar cores observed in ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxies reflect underlying dark matter (DM) cores that cannot be formed by stellar feedback acting on collisionless cold dark matter (CDM) halos. Assuming this claim is correct, we investigate the constraints that arise if such cores are produced by self-interacting dark matter (SIDM). We derive the range of SIDM cross-sections (sigma/m) required to reproduce the observed core sizes. These can result from halos in either the core-formation phase (low sigma/m) or the core-collapse phase (high sigma/m), yielding a wide allowed range (sim 0.3 -- 200 cm2/g) consistent with values reported in the literature for more massive galaxies. We also construct a simple model relating stellar mass to core radius - two observables likely connected in SIDM. This model reproduces the stellar core sizes and masses in UFDs with sigma/m consistent with those derived above. It also predicts a trend of increasing core radius with stellar mass, in agreement with observations of more massive dwarf galaxies. The model central DM densities match observations when assuming the SIDM profile to originate from an initial CDM halo that follows the mass-concentration relation. Since stellar feedback is insufficient to form cores in these galaxies, UFDs unbiasedly anchor sigma/m at low velocities. If the core-collapse scenario holds (i.e., high sigma/m), UFD halos are thermalized on kpc scales, approximately two orders of magnitude larger than the stellar cores. These large thermalization scales could potentially influence substructure formation in more massive systems.

 - **Abstract**
 We utilize a large sample of $\sim$113,000 galaxies ($z < 0.3$) from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey with high-quality data to compare star formation rates (SFRs) across multiple diagnostic methods and examine their connection to Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) strength, indicated by Eddington ratio. Our sample encompassed star-forming (SF), composite, Seyfert, and LINER galaxies. Our analysis utilizes various SFRs indicators, including observed infrared flux ($\rm SFR_{FIR}$) from AKARI/Herschel ($\sim$4,100 sources), the MPA-JHU catalog ($\rm SFR_{Dn4000}$), the ANN catalog ($\rm SFR_{ANN}$), the GSWLC catalog ($\rm SFR_{SED}$ and $\rm SFR_{MIR}$), as well as \OII\ and \Ha\ emission lines ($\rm SFR_{[OII]}$ and $\rm SFR_{H\alpha}$). Within SF galaxies, SFRs measurements from different tracers exhibited differences, with offsets and scatter below 0.26 dex and 0.29 dex, respectively. Moreover, non-SF galaxies (composite, Seyfert, and LINER) displayed discrepancies among SFR tracers, particularly for LINER galaxies, with offsets below 0.86 dex and a scatter of 0.57 dex. Additionally, our findings revealed robust correlations between SFRs and specific SFRs (sSFRs) with Eddington ratios. Eddington ratio exhibited gradual transitions in the (s)SFRs-stellar mass diagrams. Galaxies with high Eddington ratios displayed high star formation activity, similar to blue SF galaxies. Furthermore, we observed decreasing sSFR trends from SF galaxies to composite, Seyfert, and LINER galaxies. Our results may provide insight into our understanding of (s)SFRs traced by different approaches and their connection to AGN activities.

 - **Abstract**
 Small scale extreme ultraviolet (EUV) transient brightenings are observationally abundant and critically important to investigate. Determining whether they share the same physical mechanisms as larger scale flares would have significant implications for the coronal heating problem. A recent study has revealed that quasi periodic pulsations (QPPs), a common feature in both solar and stellar flares, may also be present in EUV brightenings in the quiet Sun (QS). We aim to characterise the properties of EUV brightenings and their associated QPPs in both QS and active regions (ARs) using unprecedented 1 s cadence observations from Solar Orbiter/Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI). We applied an automated detection algorithm to analyse statistical properties of EUV brightenings. QPPs were identified using complementary techniques optimised for both stationary and non stationary signals, including a Fourier based method, ensemble empirical mode decomposition, and wavelet analysis. Over 500000 and 300000 brightenings were detected in ARs and QS regions, respectively. Brightenings with lifetimes shorter than 3 s were detected, demonstrating the importance of high temporal resolution. QPP periods span from 5 to over 500 s and show similar distributions between AR and QS. We found a consistent power law scaling, with a weak correlation and a large spread, between QPP period and lifetime in EUV brightenings, solar, and stellar flares. The results support the interpretation that EUV brightenings may represent a small scale manifestation of the same physical mechanisms driving larger solar and stellar flares. Furthermore, the similarity in the statistical properties of EUV brightenings and their associated QPPs between AR and QS regions suggests that the underlying generation mechanisms may not strongly depend on the large scale magnetic environment.

 - **Abstract**
 Accretion rates in radio galaxies are typically estimated from optical and total radio flux measurements, incorporating emission from the core, jets, and lobes. These estimates can be used to investigate the link between observed Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) emission properties and the underlying accretion physics of their Super-Massive Black Holes (SMBHs). However, while optical and core radio emission trace the ongoing accretion episode, extended jet and lobe structures may result from past AGN activity. Therefore, accretion rates inferred from spatially unresolved radio observations may be systematically overestimated, a bias whose prevalence and extent have yet to be thoroughly explored. In this study, using a sample of 121 local radio-loud galaxies with spatially resolved radio components, we assess this effect by estimating their \textit{Eddington}-scaled accretion rates ($\lambda$) using both the common methodology which considers total radio fluxes and a simple but novel approach that treats core and extended emission as signatures of distinct accretion phases. Our results show that the former method systematically overestimates the $\lambda$ by a factor of $\sim 3$, affecting the accretion mode classification in approximately $11\%$ of sources. This discrepancy appears to correlate with radio size, with the most extended galaxies indicating a transition in accretion disk mode. Such a bias could affect AGN classification in unresolved high-redshift radio surveys. Our results motivate re-examining accretion rate calculations from AGN radio surveys and align with the AGN unification model for radio galaxies, revealing a clearer link between accretion disk physics and optical spectral properties.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper we use statistical complexity and information theory metrics to study structure within solar wind time series. We explore this using entropy-complexity and information planes, where the measure for entropy is formed using either permutation entropy or the degree distribution of a horizontal visibility graph (HVG). The entropy is then compared to the Jensen complexity (Jensen-Shannon complexity plane) and Fisher information measure (Fisher-Shannon information plane), formed both from permutations and the HVG approach. Additionally we characterise the solar wind time series by studying the properties of the HVG degree distribution. Four types of solar wind intervals have been analysed, namely fast streams, slow streams, magnetic clouds and sheath regions, all of which have distinct origins and interplanetary characteristics. Our results show that, overall, different metrics give similar results but Fisher-Shannon, which gives a more local measure of complexity, leads to a larger spread of values in the entropy-complexity plane. Magnetic cloud intervals stood out in all approaches, in particular when analysing the magnetic field magnitude. Differences between solar wind types (except for magnetic clouds) were typically more distinct for larger time lags, suggesting universality in fluctuations for small scales. The fluctuations within the solar wind time series were generally found to be stochastic, in agreement with previous studies. The use of information theory tools in the analysis of solar wind time series can help to identify structures and provide insight into their origin and formation.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the first 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulation that captures the full, self-consistent evolution from the late inspiral through merger and subsequent recoil of a supermassive binary black hole (SMBBH) with misaligned spins embedded in an equilibrated circumbinary disk (CBD). Our full numerical simulation follows the final 40 orbits of the inspiral and merger of the binary, following an initial phase of 165 orbits of CBD evolution toward equilibrium. We find that the jets, launched from the minidisks surrounding each black hole, are tilted toward the black hole spin direction close to the individual black holes, but align with the binary's total angular momentum at larger distances. Following the merger, the remnant black hole receives a recoil kick exceeding 1000 km/s. Remarkably, it retains its gravitationally bound CBD as if it were ejected from a galactic nucleus. Furthermore, the jet launched by the recoiling remnant black hole preserves the large-scale orientation established during the late inspiral. We demonstrate that the majority of the luminosity emerges from a region in close proximity to the black hole, suggesting that the accretion disk surrounding the recoiling remnant would remain the most luminous feature postmerger, persisting for long enough to be observable by modern telescopes (hours in the case of LISA sources). These findings introduce a direct, first-principles model for the recoil of supermassive black holes (SMBH) in active galactic nuclei (AGNs), offering a comprehensive theoretical basis to support and elucidate both ongoing and future observational efforts.

 - **Abstract**
 Stars primarily form in galactic spiral arms within dense, filamentary molecular clouds. The largest and most elongated of these molecular clouds are referred to as ``bones," which are massive, velocity-coherent filaments (lengths ~20 to >100 pc, widths ~1-2 pc) that run approximately parallel and in close proximity to the Galactic plane. While these bones have been generally well characterized, the importance and structure of their magnetic fields (B-fields) remain largely unconstrained. Through the SOFIA Legacy program FIELDMAPS, we mapped the B-fields of 10 bones in the Milky Way. We found that their B-fields are varied, with no single preferred alignment along the entire spine of the bones. At higher column densities, the spines of the bones are more likely to align perpendicularly to the B-fields, although this is not ubiquitous, and the alignment shows no strong correlation with the locations of identified young stellar objects. We estimated the B-field strengths across the bones and found them to be ~30-150 $\mu$G at pc scales. Despite the generally low virial parameters, the B-fields are strong compared to the local gravity, suggesting that B-fields play a significant role in resisting global collapse. Moreover, the B-fields may slow and guide gas flow during dissipation. Recent star formation within the bones may be due to high-density pockets at smaller scales, which could have formed before or simultaneously with the bones.

 - **Abstract**
 We develop a three-dimensional kinetic model of the solar transition region and corona in which the plasma above the chromosphere is collisionless and embedded in a uniform magnetic field. Heating occurs intermittently at discrete locations on the chromospheric surface, modeled through a surface coarse-graining procedure that produces non-thermal boundary conditions for the Vlasov equation. The resulting stationary distribution functions generate suprathermal particle populations and naturally lead to a temperature inversion via gravitational filtering, without any local coronal heating. The model reproduces realistic temperature and density profiles with a thin transition region and a hot corona, consistent with solar observations. These results demonstrate that the spatial intermittency of heating at the chromospheric interface is sufficient to account for the formation of the transition region and the high-temperature corona.

 - **Abstract**
 Hot Jupiters are Jupiter-sized exoplanets with close-in orbits, characterized by extreme day-night temperature contrasts due to synchronous rotation. These planets offer unique observational opportunities through transit photometry, transmission spectroscopy, and infrared (IR) phase curve analysis, which reveal information about heat redistribution and atmospheric dynamics. Complementary to common generalized circulation models (GCMs), we introduce a more comprehensive approach using the anelastic fluid equations that fully capture the three-dimensional nature of the emerging non-linear flows. We identify various non-linear flow regimes and analyze the heat distribution when irradiation and thermal advection reach equilibrium. Eastward zonal winds can reach velocities comparable to the planetary rotation (up to several kilometers per second), while slower radial flows, though less prominent, contribute significantly to heat advection and can cause both eastward and westward hotspot shifts. The efficiency of day-to-night heat redistribution and the positioning of brightness maxima are shown to depend strongly on pressure and the interplay of advective and radiative processes. These findings improve our understanding of the diversity observed in the IR phase curves and suggest a non-magnetic mechanism for retrograde hotspot shifts. By extending the scope of traditional GCM models, our work demonstrates the usefulness of anelastic models in capturing the complex, multidimensional dynamics of irradiated exoplanetary atmospheres.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic flux emergence and decay in the Sun span from days to months. However, their tracking is typically limited to about half a solar rotation when relying on single-vantage-point observations. Combining observations from both the Earth-facing and far side of the Sun, we monitored the magnetic and coronal evolution and characterised the non-potentiality of one of the most complex and eruptive regions of the past two decades, over more than three full solar rotations. We used photospheric magnetograms and EUV filtergrams from the Solar Orbiter and the Solar Dynamics Observatory along with flare detections from the GOES and the STIX instrument on board the Solar Orbiter. All images were deprojected into a common coordinate system and merged into a unified dataset. We tracked the evolution of magnetic flux and EUV emission and computed magnetic field parameters from the line-of-sight magnetograms to quantify the region's non-potentiality. We identified the region's initial emergence and followed its evolution through to its decay. The region developed through successive flux emergence episodes over a period of 20 days, reached its peak complexity one month after the first emergence, and gradually decayed over the subsequent two months. Unlike many complex regions, it consistently maintained high levels of non-potentiality for most of its lifetime, sustaining equally strong flaring activity. The derived time series of non-potentiality parameters, the first of their kind, far exceeded the typical 14-day window imposed by solar rotation and were remarkably consistent, exhibiting strong correlation with the flaring activity of the region. Multi-vantage-point observations can significantly improve our understanding of how magnetic flux emerges, evolves, and drives solar activity, beyond the two-week limit imposed by solar rotation on observations along the Sun-Earth line.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a rigorous identification of candidates for dormant black holes (BHs) and neutron stars (NSs) in binaries using summary statistics from Gaia DR3, rather than full orbital solutions. Although Gaia astrometric orbits have already revealed a small sample of compact object binaries, many systems remain undetected due to stringent quality cuts imposed on the published orbits. Using a forward-modelling framework that simulates Gaia observables, in particular the renormalised unit weight error (ruwe) and radial velocity (RV) scatter, we infer posterior distributions for companion mass and orbital period via MCMC sampling, marginalising over nuisance orbital parameters. We validate our approach by comparing the predicted masses and periods against full orbit solutions from DR3, and by successfully recovering known compact object binaries as promising candidates. The method is best suited for systems with red giant primaries, which have more reliable Gaia RV scatter and a light centroid more likely dominated by one component, compared to main-sequence stars. And they are less likely to be triples with short-period inner binaries, which produce confounding signatures. We apply the method to three million giants and identify 556 systems with best-fit companion masses $\gtrsim 3\,M_\odot$. Recovery simulations suggest our selection method is substantially more sensitive than the DR3 non-single-star catalogue, particularly for binaries with periods below 1 year and above $\sim 6$ years. These candidates represent promising targets for spectroscopic follow-up and Gaia DR4 analysis to confirm the presence of compact objects. Candidate main-sequence stars with massive companions face a larger set of confounding effects. Therefore, we present an analogous catalogue of 279 additional `main sequence' candidates only as an appendix.

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma Dor stars are ideal targets for studies of the innermost dynamical properties of stars, due to their rich frequency spectrum of gravito-inertial modes propagating in the radiative envelope. Recent studies found that these modes could couple at the core-to-envelope interface with pure inertial modes in their sub-inertial regime, forming the so-called inertial dip in the period-spacing pattern of these stars. The inertial dip, as formed by core modes, stands out as a unique probe of core properties. We aim in this work to explore the effect of core magnetism on its structure, property of key relevance in modern stellar physics. We describe the outlines of our model and the geometry of the considered field. We give the coupling equation and the variation of the dip shape and location with increasing magnetic contrast between the core and the envelope. We compare our findings to the ones obtained in a hydrodynamical, differentially-rotating case. We show hints at potentially lifting the degeneracy between the signatures of core-to-envelope differential rotation and core magnetic fields. Together, these two cases can be considered as an exploration of different magnetic regimes potentially reached in the core of gamma Dor stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Very-high energy (VHE; $>$100 GeV) $\gamma$-ray emission originates via some of the most extreme particle acceleration processes in the universe. Considering beamed active galactic nuclei, i.e., blazars, only a small fraction, mainly high synchrotron peak BL Lacs, have been detected in the VHE band with the ground-based Cherenkov telescopes. We utilized $\sim$16 years of Fermi-Large Area Telescope (LAT) observations in the 0.1$-$2 TeV energy range to systematically search for potential VHE emitters in a sample of high synchrotron peaked ($\nu^{\rm peak}_{\rm syn}>10^{15}$ Hz) BL Lac sources. We identified, for the first time, 92 VHE emitting blazars at $\geq 5\sigma$ confidence level. A significant VHE emission was also detected from 52 objects, which have been previously reported to be a VHE blazar. Comparing with the general blazar population, these VHE emitting blazars are found to be located at low redshifts (mean $z=0.2 \pm 0.1$) and exhibit bright synchrotron emission ($\log F^{\rm peak}_{\rm syn}=-11.2 \pm 0.4$, in erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$). We also investigated the coincidence of VHE photon arrivals with the source activity states and found that Fermi-LAT has detected VHE photons during both quiescent and elevated activity epochs. These VHE emitting blazars represent promising targets for current and next-generation ground-based Cherenkov telescopes, and provide valuable laboratories for probing particle acceleration in relativistic jets, testing multi-messenger connections, and constraining extragalactic background light models.

 - **Abstract**
 We evaluate the contribution to the Isotropic Gamma-Ray Background (IGRB) coming from Radio Galaxies (RGs), the subclass of radio-loud Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) with the highest misalignment from the line of sight (l.o.s.). Since only a small number of RGs are detected in gamma rays compared to the largest known radio population, the correlation between radio and gamma-ray emission serves as a crucial tool to characterize the gamma-ray properties of these sources. We analyse the population of RGs using two samples. The first sample contains 26 sources individually detected by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope at gamma rays. The second sample contains 210 RGs for which the gamma-ray emission is not significantly detected by the LAT. We use a stacking analysis to characterize the average properties of the gamma-ray emission of the two samples, separately at first and then combined. We then evaluate the correlation between their gamma-ray emission and the emission from their radio core at 5 GHz, and we use it to determine their contribution to the IGRB. Due to the limited number of RGs detected at the gamma-rays, information on the gamma-ray luminosity function is limited. The correlation between the gamma-ray emission and the emission of the radio core allows us to characterize it starting from the luminosity function of the radio cores, which is modeled with greater accuracy due to the larger number of sources detected at these frequencies. We find that the diffuse emission as extrapolated from the properties of the subthreshold RGs is lower than the one inferred from detected RGs, showing that the contribution of the population of RGs to the IGRB is lower than the previous estimates and it is around the 30% level of the IGRB intensity.

 - **Abstract**
 Feedback from Young Massive Clusters (YMCs) is an important driver of galaxy evolution. In the first few Myr, mechanical feedback is dominated by collective effects of the massive stellar winds in the YMC. The mass-loss rates and terminal wind velocities of these stars change by orders of magnitude over pre-SN timescales as the massive stars evolve, and mass-loss rates of Cool Supergiant (CSG) stars in particular are uncertain by a factor $\sim~20$ or more. In this work we perform a first study of the time evolution of average cluster wind velocity $\bar{V}_{\mathrm{cl}}$ as a function of stellar metallicity $Z$, assuming single star evolution. We also check the validity of assuming Wolf-Rayet stars dominate the feedback effects of a YMC, as often done when interpreting X-ray and $\gamma$-ray observations, and test how sensitive $\bar{V}_{\mathrm{cl}}$ is to current uncertainties in mass-loss rates. We use pySTARBURST99 to calculate integrated properties of YMCs for $Z$ in the range of $0.0004-0.02$, representing a range of environments from IZw18 to the Galactic Centre. We find that $\bar{V}_{\mathrm{cl}}$ drops off rapidly for sub-LMC $Z$, and we recommend a value of $500-1000\,~\textrm{km~s}^{-1}$ be used in this regime. We show accounting only for WR stars can overestimate $\bar{V}_{\mathrm{cl}}$ by $500-2000\,~\textrm{km~s}^{-1}$ at $Z \geq Z_\text{LMC}$. We also find that different RSG mass-loss assumptions can change the inferred $\bar{V}_{\mathrm{cl}}$ by $\sim1000\,~\textrm{km~s}^{-1}$, highlighting the need for improved observational constraints for RSGs in YMCs.

 - **Abstract**
 Star clusters host the massive stars responsible for feedback in star-forming galaxies. Stellar feedback shapes the interstellar medium (ISM), affecting the formation of future star clusters. To self-consistently capture the interplay between feedback and star formation, a model must resolve the parsec-scale star formation sites and the multiphase ISM. Additionally, the dynamical impact of cosmic rays (CRs) on star formation rates (SFRs) must also be considered. We present the first simulations of the formation of an ensemble of star clusters with dynamically-coupled CRs, near-individual star particles, and a feedback-regulated ISM. We analyze tallbox simulations performed using the CRISP model in the moving-mesh code AREPO. We apply varied implementations of CR transport under the theory of self-confinement. We find that CRs simultaneously reduce the SFR, the power law slope of the cluster mass function, and the cluster formation efficiency. Each simulation is compatible with observations, and CR feedback tends to move results along observed star cluster relations. We see only modest changes in cluster radius and velocity dispersions, but significant differences in the virial parameters. Ultimately, the primary impact of CRs is to reduce SFRs. Lower SFRs imply fewer supernovae, and consequently a lower turbulent energy budget for gas. Star clusters formed in a CR-regulated ISM have lower velocity dispersions, and are therefore more bound under self-gravity. The effective clustering of SNe is unchanged by CRs. Through this work, we demonstrate the predictive power of the CRISP feedback model, despite this idealized setup.

 - **Abstract**
 Infrared emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) play a major role in determining the charge balance of their host environments that include photo-dissociation regions (PDRs) in galaxies, planetary nebulae, and rims of molecular clouds. We aim to investigate the distribution and sizes of charged PAHs across the key zones of the Orion Bar PDR. We employ JWST MIRI-MRS observations of the Orion Bar from the Early Release Science program ''PDRs4All'' and synthetic images in the JWST MIRI filters. We investigate the spatial morphology of the AIBs at 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, and 11.0 $\mu$m that commonly trace PAH cations, and the neutral PAH-tracing 11.2 $\mu$m AIB, their (relative) correlations, and the relationship with existing empirical prescriptions for AIBs. The 6.2. 7.7, 8.6, 11.0, and 11.2 $\mu$m AIBs are similar in spatial morphology, on larger scales. Analyzing three-feature intensity correlations, two distinct groups emerge: the 8.6 and 11.0 $\mu$m vs. the 6.2 and 7.7 $\mu$m AIBs. We attribute these correlations to PAH size. The 6.2 and 7.7 $\mu$m AIBs trace cationic, medium-sized PAHs. Quantum chemical calculations reveal that the 8.6 $\mu$m AIB is carried by large, compact, cationic PAHs, and the 11.0 $\mu$m AIB's correlation to it implies, so is this band. The 6.2/8.6 and 7.7/8.6 PAH band ratios thus probe PAH size. We conclude that the 6.2/11.2 AIB ratio is the most reliable proxy for charged PAHs, within the cohort. We outline JWST MIRI imaging prescriptions that serve as effective tracers of the PAH ionization fraction as traced. This study showcases the efficacy of the 6-9 $\mu$m AIBs to probe the charge state and size distribution of the emitting PAHs, offering insights into the physical conditions of their host environments. JWST MIRI photometry offers a viable alternative to IFU spectroscopy for characterizing this emission in extended objects.
#### Rare Transients in Nearby Galaxies Explain Ultra-high-energy Cosmic Rays

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays remains one of the central open questions in astroparticle physics. Recent measurements reveal anisotropies in arrival directions, a rigidity-dependent composition dominated by intermediate-mass nuclei, and striking hemispheric differences in the energy spectra. Here we show that rare transients in nearby galaxies can naturally account for these features. In our fiducial neutron-star merger model, the cosmic ray flux above $25$ EeV is dominated by ten nearby galaxies within $8\,$Mpc. This accounts for the observed hotspots: seven of the ten brightest galaxies coincide with reported excess regions, a chance probability of $p\simeq0.003$. Nearby transients also explain the spectral excess of TA over Auger; link their angular sizes to extragalactic magnetic fields at $\sim$1 nG; explain the dominance of individual species over narrow energy ranges; and the rigidity-aligned succession of isotopes.
