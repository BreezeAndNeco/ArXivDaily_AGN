#### Halting the migration of super-Earths by efficient gap opening in radiative, low viscosity disks

 - **Abstract**
 While planet migration has been extensively studied for classical viscous disks, planet-disk interaction in nearly inviscid disks has mostly been explored with greatly simplified thermodynamics. In such environments, motivated by models of wind-driven accretion disks, even Earth-mass planets located interior to 1 au can significantly perturb the disk, carving gaps and exciting vortices on their edges. Both processes are influenced by radiative transfer, which can both drive baroclinic forcing and influence gap opening. We perform a set of high-resolution radiation hydrodynamics simulations of planet-disk interaction in the feedback and gap-opening regimes, aiming to understand the role of radiation transport in the migration of super-Earth-mass planets representative of the observed exoplanet population. We find that radiative cooling drives baroclinic forcing during multiple stages of the planet's migration in the feedback regime (~1.5 M_earth), significantly delaying the onset of vortex formation at the gap edge but ultimately resulting in type-III runaway migration episodes. For super-thermal-mass planets (~6.7 M_earth), radiative cooling is fundamentally linked to the gap opening process, with the planet stalling instead of undergoing vortex-assisted migration as expected from isothermal or adiabatic models. This stalling of migration can only be captured when treating radiative effects, and since it affects super-thermal-mass planets its implications for both the final configuration of planetary systems and population synthesis modeling are potentially huge. Combining our findings with previous related studies, we present a map of migration regimes for radiative, nearly-inviscid disks, with the cooling-mediated gap-opening regime playing a central role in determining the planet's orbital properties.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Dense filaments/feathers are kpc-scale dusty features present in nearby main sequence galaxies. Distinct from the spiral arms, filaments constitute a major portion of dense gas concentration. They are expected to play an important role in star formation and are known to harbour star-forming regions and H II regions. Aims. We explore the origin of filaments/feathers in disc galaxies via global gravitational instability. Methods. We conduct a parameter study using three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of isolated disc galaxies that are isothermal, self-gravitating and initialised in equilibrium. Our galaxies are uniquely characterised by two dimensionless parameters, the Toomre $Q$ and the rotational Mach number, $\mathcal{M}_{\rm c} = v_{\rm c}/c_{\rm s}$ (ratio of circular velocity to sound speed). We carry out simulations covering a wide range in both. Results. We find that galaxies with $Q = 1$ form filaments within a single rotation, while galaxies with $Q \geq 2$ do not. These filaments are kpc long and are semi-regularly spaced along the azimuth. Their morphology, density contrast and formation timescale vary with $\mathcal{M}_{\rm c}$, with filament spacing and instability onset time both inversely proportional to $\mathcal{M}_{\rm c}$ and the density contrast increasing with $\mathcal{M}_{\rm c}$. However, their growth rates in all $Q = 1$ galaxies are $\sim 0.5~\Omega$, where $\Omega$ is the angular frequency. We compare the filament spacing in our simulations with the ones from JWST/MIRI and HST observations of nearby galaxies and find them in agreement. Conclusions. Our study suggests that self-gravity and rotation are sufficient to form filaments, even in the absence of spiral arms or magnetic fields. Their morphologies are primarily determined by $\mathcal{M}_{\rm c}$, which parametrises the importance of thermal versus rotational support.
#### CHEX-MATE: Scaling relations of radio halo profiles for clusters in the LoTSS DR2 area

 - **Abstract**
 The thermal and non-thermal components in galaxy clusters have properties that, although shaped from different physical phenomena, can share some similarities, mainly driven by their halo mass and the accretion processes. Scaling relations have been proven to exist for both components and studied in X-ray (thermal) and radio (non-thermal) bands. At the radio wavelength, such investigations are so far limited to the integrated quantities (e.g. total power and mass). We aimed to investigate the scaling relations between the mass of a galaxy cluster and its radio emission at low frequencies, treating both the integrated and the spatially resolved quantities for a sample of well-selected targets. We crossmatched LoTSS DR2 and CHEX-MATE datasets in order to get the deepest and most homogeneous radio data of a representative sample of objects. We analytically derived the expected relation between the radio power ($P_{\nu}$) and radio surface brightness profile, and performed a comparison with observational results. We obtained that properly accounting for the mass and redshift dependence in the radio profile can reduce the overall scatter by a factor of $\sim 4$, with an evident residual dependence on the cluster dynamical status. We showed that assuming no relation between the halo size ($R_{H}$) and the cluster mass ($M$) allowed us to reconcile the observed radio profile mass scaling and the one predicted starting from the $P_{\nu}-M$ relation. We discuss the implications of a lack of $R_H-M$ relation, assessing possible systematics and biases in the analyses, and interpreting it as a natural consequence of the structure formation process. Finally, we also considered the role of the magnetic field in the $P_{\nu}-M$ relation, putting constraints on its dependence upon the cluster mass and finding consistent results with expectations from our radio power mass scaling.

 - **Abstract**
 Broad absorption line (BAL) quasars exhibit significant outflows, offering insights into active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback. While typically associated with high Eddington ratios, BAL quasars also occur in low Eddington ratio regimes, which remain poorly understood. This study aims to compare BAL properties and variability across these this http URL investigate the occurrence rates, absorption characteristics, and variability of BAL quasars at low and high Eddington ratios. Using the SDSS DR16 quasar catalog, we selected a redshift-matched control sample to compare low and high Eddington ratio BAL quasar sources. We first examined the BAL fraction as a function of Eddington ratio. Key absorption parameters-equivalent width, absorption line width, velocity range, and depth-were analyzed, and a multi-epoch variability study was conducted using repeat spectra, followed by a comparison of parameter distributions between the two samples. For the first time, we report an increase in BAL fraction toward low Eddington ratios, in addition to the previously known trend of high BAL fraction at high Eddington ratios. While high Eddington sources show extreme absorption features, overall distributions are statistically similar except for maximum outflow velocity. No significant variability differences were observed. The correlation between outflow velocity, Eddington ratio, and luminosity supports the role of radiation pressure in driving quasar outflows. For low Eddington ratios, additional mechanisms, such as softer SEDs, larger outflow distances, and thickened accretion disks from radiatively inefficient processes, likely drive outflow formation.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first three-dimensional radiation magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) simulation of a sub-Eddington circumbinary disk (CBD) around an equal-mass massive black hole binary (MBHB) with a total mass of $2\,\times\,10^7\,M_{\odot}$ on a circular orbit, separated by 100$\,GM_{\rm tot}/c^2$. The inclusion of radiation leads to a denser, thinner, and more filamentary disk compared to non-radiative magnetohydrodynamic simulation, primarily due to reduced pressure support and an altered equation of state. The RMHD disk also features $\sim 3$ times lower accretion rate ($\approx 0.15\,\dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$), weaker accretion streams and a less pronounced overdensity (a.k.a., ``lump") at the inner edge. Our analysis of the light curves and thermal spectra reveals that the variability induced by the binary-CBD interaction is distinguishable in the optical/UV band, where CBD shines at about $1\%$ of the Eddington luminosity. These findings underscore the crucial role of radiation on the structure and observational properties of CBDs around massive black hole binaries and have implications for detecting electromagnetic counterparts to LISA gravitational wave precursors, and for heavier binaries that are Pulsar Timing Array sources.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations of the solar atmosphere in cool extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lines have reported the prevalence of coronal rain falling from coronal cloud filaments that are associated with the magnetic dips of coronal X-point structures. These filaments mysteriously appear as clouds of mass in the corona that subsequently shrink and disappear due to mass losses that drain as coronal rain along arced field lines. Using a two and a half dimensional, magnetohydrodynamic model, we investigated evaporation-condensation as the formation mechanism of the subset of coronal cloud filaments that form above coronal X-points. Our simulation included the effects of field-aligned thermal conduction and optically thin radiation and used the state-of-the-art Transition Region Adaptive Conduction (TRAC) method to model the formation, maintenance, and mass loss of a filament above a coronal X-point. This paper presents a physical model that demonstrates magnetic reconnection as a filament loss mechanism, producing hybrid filament/coronal rain via mass losses through the X-point. A detailed analysis of how the mass of the filament forces the field to reconnect is also presented, revealing three phases that characterize the evolution of the reconnecting current sheet and associated mass losses. We conclude that the formation of certain coronal cloud filaments and subsequent mass losses via coronal rain can be explained by the evaporation-condensation model combined with filament mass losses forced by magnetic reconnection. We also report that rebound shocks generated by the impact of coronal rain condensations on the chromosphere together with retractive upflows can cause upward propagating condensations to form through a dynamic thermal runaway process.
#### FAUST-XXII. Deuteration in the VLA1623-2417 protostellar hot-corinos, cavities, and streamers

 - **Abstract**
 The study of deuterium fractionation is a valuable tool for reconstructing our chemical history from the early prestellar stages to the formation of planets. In the context of the ALMA Large Programme FAUST, we observed formaldehyde, H$_2$CO, and its singly and doubly deuterated forms, HDCO and D$_2$CO, towards the protostellar cluster VLA1623-2417, on scales of ~ 2000 - 50 au. Formaldehyde probes the inner envelopes of the protostars VLA1623A, B, and W, the rotating cavities opened by the VLA1623A outflow, and several streamers. The HDCO and D$_2$CO emissions are observed towards VLA1623A, in its outflow cavities, and in one of the streamers. We estimate the gas temperature from the HDCO lines: T~ 125 K towards VLA1623A, indicating hot-corino emission, lower temperatures in the outflow cavities (20 - 40 K), and in the streamers ($\le15$ K). The D$_2$CO lines also trace the flattened envelope of VLA1623A, where H$_2$CO and HDCO are fainter. This may be due to D$_2$CO formation on dust grains in the cold prestellar phase, and subsequent photodesorption caused by the enhanced UV flux from two nearby B stars. We inferred the molecular deuteration: [HDCO]/[H$_2$CO] ~ 0.16, ~ 0.07 - 0.13, and ~ 0.3; [D$_2$CO]/[H$_2$CO] ~ 0.003, ~ 0.05 - 0.13, and ~ 0.03 in the hot corino, in the outflow cavities, and in the streamer, respectively. The spatial distribution of D$_2$CO, which points to formation on dust grains, and the similar values of [HDCO]/[H$_2$CO] and [D$_2$CO]/[H$_2$CO] in the components of the system, suggest that deuterium fractionation occurs at the prestellar stage and is then inherited, mostly unaltered, in the protostellar phase.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the amplification of isotropic, incompressible turbulence through multiple planar, collisional shocks, using analytical linear theory. There are two limiting cases we explore. The first assumes shocks occur rapidly in time such that the turbulence does not evolve between shocks. Whereas the second case allows enough time for turbulence to isotropize between each shock. For the latter case, through a quasi-equation-of-state, we show that the weak multi-shock limit is agnostic to the distinction between thermal and vortical turbulent pressures, like an isotropic volumetric compression. When turbulence does not return to isotropy between shocks, the generated anisotropy -- itself a function of shock strength -- can feedback on amplification by further shocks, altering choices for maximal or minimal amplification. In addition for this case, we find that amplification is sensitive to the shock ordering. We map how choices of shock strength can impact these amplification differences due to ordering, finding, for example, shock pairs which lead to identical mean post-shock fields (density, temperature, pressure) but maximally distinct turbulent amplification.

 - **Abstract**
 Sparked by the asteroseismic space revolution, ensemble studies have been used to produce empirical relations linking observed seismic properties and fundamental stellar properties. Cluster stars are particularly valuable because they have the same metallicity, distance, and age, thus reducing scatter to reveal smoother relations. We present the first study of a cluster that spans the full evolutionary sequence from subgiants to core helium-burning red giants using asteroseismology to characterise the stars in M67, including a yellow straggler. We use Kepler/K2 data to measure seismic surface gravity, examine the potential influence of core magnetic fields, derive an empirical expression for the seismic surface term, and determine the phase term $\epsilon$ of the asymptotic relation for acoustic modes, extending its analysis to evolutionary states previously unexplored in detail. Additionally, we calibrate seismic scaling relations for stellar mass and radius, and quantify their systematic errors if surface term corrections are not applied to state-of-the-art stellar models. Our masses show that the Reimers mass loss parameter can not be larger than $\eta$ $\sim$ 0.23 at the 2-$\sigma$ level. We use isochrone models designed for M67 and compare their predictions with individual mode frequencies. We find that the seismic masses for subgiants and red giant branch stars align with the isochrone-predicted masses as per their luminosity and colour. However, our results are inconsistent with the mass of one of the stellar components of an eclipsing binary system near the TAMS. We use traditional seismic $\chi^2$ fits to estimate a seismic cluster age of 3.95 $\pm$ 0.35 Gyrs.

 - **Abstract**
 In active galactic nuclei, jet-driven feedback plays a significant role in influencing the properties of gas within their host galaxy and the circumgalactic medium. By combining observations from the Very Large Array Sky Survey, the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-cm, the LOFAR Two Metre Sky Survey, and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we assembled a sample of 3,141 radio-loud quasars, among which 418 exhibit \mgii\ associated absorption lines in their Sloan spectra. We classify these quasars into evolutionary stages based on their radio spectral shapes. Our analysis reveals that evolved quasars exhibit a significantly higher incidence of \mgii\ associated absorption lines compared to younger sources, particularly among quasars with ``non-peaked'' radio spectra, which show an incidence of \mgii\ associated absorbers approximately 1.7 times greater than that of gigahertz-peaked spectrum sources. This observation can be explained effectively by jet-driven feedback. As quasars age, their jets expand and expel substantial amounts of gas from small scales to larger scales, ultimately reaching the circumgalactic medium. The gas expelled from the inner regions and distributed over larger scales results in a greater coverage fraction of absorbing gas. Consequently, evolved quasars exhibit a higher incidence of \mgii\ absorption lines.

 - **Abstract**
 Variable stars play a very important role in our understanding of the Milky Way and the universe. In recent years, many survey projects have generated a large amount of photometric data, necessitating classifiers that can quickly identify various types of variable stars. However, obtaining these classifiers often requires substantial manpower and computational resources. To conserve these resources, it would be best to have a classifier that can be used across surveys. We explore the possibility that a classifier created in one optical band can also work in other bands, likely from different survey facilities. We construct a random forest classifier based on photometric data in ASAS-SN V-band and OGLE I-band, and apply the classifier on ASAS-SN V-band and ZTF r-band light curves of variable star samples. We explore the classification differences of using the magnitude light-curves or the normalized flux light-curves, the periods derived from single band light-curves or the periods derived from the multi-band combined light-curves, and with or without color-related features. We find it feasible to develop a classifier capable of working in both V and r bands for certain types of variable stars, such as RRAB variables. For other types of variable stars, like Cepheids, the classifier is unable to make accurate identifications.

 - **Abstract**
 The element abundances of galaxies provide crucial insights into their formation and evolution. Using high-resolution IFU data from the MaNGA survey, we analyze the central spectra (0-0.5 $R_{\rm e}$) of 1,185 quenched galaxies ($z = 0.012-0.15$) to study their element abundances and stellar populations. We employ the full-spectrum fitting code {\tt alf} to derive stellar ages and element abundances from synthetic spectra and empirical libraries. Our key findings are: (1) Central velocity dispersion ($\sigma_*$) is the most effective parameter correlating with (relative) element abundances, especially [Na/Fe], [Mg/Fe], [C/Fe], and [N/Fe], outperforming $M_\ast$ and $M_\ast/R_{\rm e}$. (2) When binned by $\sigma_*$, the relative abundances of Na, Mg, C, and N remain stable across different formation times ($T_{\rm form}$), suggesting these elements are primarily influenced by the burstiness of star formation (traced by $\sigma_*$) rather than prolonged evolutionary processes. (3) Fe and Ca show little variation with $\sigma_*$, indicating weaker sensitivity to $\sigma_*$-driven processes. However, $T_{\rm form}$ has a global influence on all elements, contributing to their overall chemical evolution, albeit secondary to $\sigma_*$ for most elements. These results support the primary role of $\sigma_*$ in shaping the abundance patterns, likely stemming from the connection between central massive black holes and possibly dark matter halos, which influences the burstiness of star formation histories.

 - **Abstract**
 High order algorithms have emerged in numerical astrophysics as a promising avenue to reduce truncation error (proportional to a power of the linear resolution $\Delta x$) with only a moderate increase to computational expense. Significant effort has been placed in the development of finite volume algorithms for (magneto)hydrodynamics, however, state-of-the-art astrophysical simulations tightly couple a plenitude of physics, additionally including gravity, photon transport, cosmic ray transport, chemistry, and/or diffusion, to name a few. Algorithms frequently operator split this additional physics (often a first order error in time) and/or adopt a model wherein their evaluation is limited to second order accuracy in space. In this work, we present a fourth order accurate finite volume scheme for self-gravitating hydrodynamics on a uniform Cartesian grid. The method supplies source terms for the gravitational acceleration ($\rho {\bf g}$) and gravitational energy release ($\rho {\bf v} \cdot {\bf g}$) associated with fourth-order accurate solutions to the Poisson equation. Our scheme (1) guarantees the conservation of total linear momentum, while (2) decreasing (in proportion to $\Delta x^4$) the effects of spurious heating and/or cooling associated with truncation error in the gravity. We demonstrate expected convergence rates for the algorithm by measuring errors in test problems evolving self-gravity modified linear waves and 3D polytropic equilibria. We test robustness of the algorithm by integrating an induced "inside-out" adiabatic collapse. We also discuss a method to smoothly downgrade the solution to second-order spatial accuracy to avoid spurious overshoots near steep density and/or pressure gradients.

 - **Abstract**
 Quasar feedback is routinely invoked as an indispensable ingredient in galaxy formation models. Galactic outflows are a crucial agent of quasar feedback that frequently manifest themselves in absorption and emission lines. Measuring the size and energetics of outflows based on absorption lines remains a challenge, and integral-field spectroscopy (IFS) mapping in emission lines is complementary. We present a VLT/SINFONI IFS mapping of quasar 3C 191 at $z \sim 2$, in which the outflow has been analyzed in absorption line spectroscopy. Three components are found based on the morphology and kinetics of [OIII]-emitting gas: a unshifted component which consistent with the systemic redshift and the location of the nucleus, a blueshifted in the north, and a redshifted in the south. The latter two components have velocities $\sim$ 600 km s$^{-1}$ and projected extents of 5 and 11 kpc, respectively, suggesting a biconical outflow structure. The blueshifted component's velocity is consistent with that derived from absorption lines. Using the electron density measured by the absorption lines and the luminosity and velocity of [OIII] outflow, we derive the mass outflow rate to be $\dot{M} \sim $ 9.5-13.4 M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ and kinetic luminosity $\dot{E}_{\rm kin}$ ~ 2.5-3.7 $\times 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$, consistent with absorption line analyses with VLT/Xshooter spectrum. The kinetic luminosity is only 0.01% of the bolometric luminosity, rendering a relatively weak outflow compared to typical expectation for effective feedback.

 - **Abstract**
 Measuring the distance of quasar outflows from the central source ($R$) is essential for determining their importance for AGN feedback. There are two methods to measure $R$: 1) A direct determination using spatially resolved Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS) of the outflow in emission. 2) An indirect method which uses the absorption troughs from ionic excited states. The column density ratio between the excited and resonance states yields the outflow number density. Combined with a knowledge of the outflow's ionization parameter, $R$ can be determined. Generally, the IFS method probes $R$ range of several kpc or more, while the absorption method usually yields $R$ values of less than 1 kpc. There is no inconsistency between the two methods as the determinations come from different objects. Here we report the results of applying both methods to the same quasar outflow, where we derive consistent determinations of $R$ $\approx$ 5 kpc. This is the first time where the indirect absorption $R$ determination is verified by a direct spatially resolved IFS observation. In addition, the velocities (and energetics) from the IFS and absorption data are also found to be consistent. Therefore, these are two manifestations of the same outflow. In this paper we concentrate on the absorption $R$ determination for the outflow seen in quasar 3C 191 using VLT/X-shooter observations. We also reanalyze an older absorption determination for the outflow based on Keck/HIRES data and find that revised measurement to be consistent with ours. Our companion paper details the IFS analysis of the same object.

 - **Abstract**
 The geometric distances of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are challenging to measure because of their exceptionally compact structure yet vast cosmic distances. A combination of spectroastrometry and reverberation mapping (SARM) of broad-line regions (BLRs) constitutes a novel means to probe the geometric distance of AGNs, which has recently become practically feasible owing to successful interferometric observations with VLTI/GRAVITY. Here, we perform SARM analysis of four nearby quasars: Mrk 509, PDS 456, 3C 273, and NGC 3783. Results for the former two are reported for the first time and the latter two are revisited using our improved BLR dynamical modeling that includes the radial-dependent responsivity of BLRs. This allows us to self-consistently account for the emissivity weighting of the BLR in spectroastrometry and responsivity weighting in reverberation mapping. We obtain angular-diameter distances of the four quasars, from which we derive a Hubble constant of $H_0=69_{-10}^{+12}\,\rm km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}$. Although this consititutes a large uncertainty for a measurement of $H_0$, it is anticipated that the precision will improve to a competitive level once a greater number of AGNs are accessible following the upgrade of GRAVITY in the near future. From SARM analysis, the black hole masses of the four quasars are also measured with the statistical uncertainty ranging from 0.06 to 0.23 dex, consistent with the correlations between black hole masses and properties of the host bulges.

 - **Abstract**
 Studies for inferring the global characteristics of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) from its multipoint local in situ observations have been undertaken earlier, but there are limited studies utilizing measurements from multiple spacecraft with sufficiently small radial and angular separations. In the present study, we investigate a magnetic cloud (MC) region of a CME observed in situ during 2023 September 24-26, at STEREO-A and Wind spacecraft near 1 AU, which had radial and angular separations of 0.03 AU and 3.4 degrees, respectively. We examine the disparities in the estimates of the arrival times of CME substructures, the MC axis, and its orientation between the two spacecraft. We also propose an approach for identifying the MC axis's arrival and have compared it with the arrival of the size/time center to understand the non-isotropic compression of the MC along its angular extent. Using minimum variance analysis (MVA), we note that the orientation of the MC is slightly out-of-ecliptic at Wind but not at STEREO-A. We also compare the magnetic field parameters over the start to end of the MC at both spacecraft and note a significant non-coherency in the MC towards its trailing portion. Our analysis confirms that MC has a stronger rear side compression at STEREO-A than at Wind, with its trailing edge arriving later at Wind. Our study highlights substantial differences in CME characteristics even at mesoscales across the angular extent, and therefore, one needs to analyze several such cases to better understand the flux rope structure.

 - **Abstract**
 Using a newly developed `holistic' atmospheric model of the aerosol structure in Uranus's atmosphere, based upon observations made by HST/STIS, Gemini/NIFS and IRTF/SpeX from 2000 -- 2009, we make a new estimate the bolometric Bond albedo of Uranus during this time of $A^* = 0.338 \pm 0.011$, with a phase integral of $q^* = 1.36 \pm 0.03$. Then, using a simple seasonal model, developed to be consistent with the disc-integrated blue and green magnitude data from the Lowell Observatory from 1950 to 2016, we model how Uranus's reflectivity and heat budget vary during its orbit and determine new orbital-mean average value for the bolometric Bond albedo of $\overline{A^*} = 0.349 \pm 0.016$ and for the absorbed solar flux of $\overline{P_\mathrm{in}}=0.604 \pm 0.027$ W m$^{-2}$. Assuming the outgoing thermal flux to be $\overline{P_\mathrm{out}}=0.693 \pm 0.013$ W m$^{-2}$, as previously determined from Voyager 2 observations, we arrive at a new estimate of Uranus's average heat flux budget of $P_\mathrm{out}/P_\mathrm{in} = 1.15 \pm 0.06$, finding considerable variation with time due to Uranus's significant orbital eccentricity of 0.046. This leads the flux budget to vary from $P_\mathrm{out}/P_\mathrm{in} = 1.03$ near perihelion, to 1.24 near aphelion. We conclude that although $P_\mathrm{out}/P_\mathrm{in}$ is considerably smaller than for the other giant planets, Uranus is not in thermal equilibrium with the Sun.

 - **Abstract**
 In addition to sunspots, which represent the most easily visualized manifestation of solar magnetism, cutting-edge observations of the solar atmosphere have uncovered a plethora of magnetic flux tubes, down to the resolving power of modern high-resolution telescopes (a few tens of km), revealing how the Sun is a fully magnetized star. These magnetic elements are advected and buffeted by ambient plasma flows and turbulent convection, resulting in perturbations of the flux tubes that make them natural conduits for channeling wave energy into the upper layers of the Sun's atmosphere and significantly contributing to the acceleration of the solar wind. Today, data acquired by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), have made it possible to study the dynamics of small-scale magnetic fields over long timescales. Here, for the first time, we present the discovery of a modulation in the dynamical behavior of small-scale magnetic concentrations in the photosphere over temporal scales consistent with the solar activity cycle (i.e. 11 years), which has only been made possible by the long observing lifetime of the SDO/HMI spacecraft. Furthermore, a temporal varying polarization of their perturbations is also found on similar timescales. This demonstrates how the small-scale dynamics of magnetic fields are also affected by the global dynamo. These discoveries were realized through automated tracking of magnetic fields in the solar photosphere across 11 continuous years, resulting in the most extended statistical analyses of its kind so far, with more than 31 million magnetic concentrations examined.

 - **Abstract**
 Obscuration in active galactic nuclei (AGN) provides insights into the material surrounding the central engine. Compton-thick AGN (CTAGN), characterized by a column density of $N_{\mathrm{H}} \geq 1.5 \times 10^{24} \ \mathrm{cm}^{-2}$, are heavily obscured by dust and gas. While X-ray observations primarily determine this column density, the sub-mm obscuration properties of CTAGN remain less explored. We analyze archival ALMA CO(3-2) data for CTAGN and non-CTAGN from the 70-month $\textit{Swift}$/BAT catalog and other X-ray surveys. Integrated intensity maps (moment 0) reveal dense gas concentrated around the nucleus. Assuming a constant CO-to-$\mathrm{H_2}$ conversion factor, $X_{\mathrm{CO}} = 2.2 \times 10^{20} \ \mathrm{cm}^{-2} \ (\mathrm{K\ km\ s}^{-1})^{-1}$, we find that molecular hydrogen column densities ($N_{\mathrm{H_2}}$) are generally lower than X-ray-derived total hydrogen column densities ($N_{\mathrm{H}}$). However, $N_{\mathrm{H_2}}$ values in this work are slightly higher than in previous studies due to the adopted conversion factor. The discrepancy between $N_{\mathrm{H}}$ and $N_{\mathrm{H_2}}$ aligns with prior findings that X-ray-derived values tend to be higher, except for non-CTAGN, where $N_{\mathrm{H_2}}$ can exceed $N_{\mathrm{H}}$. Kendall and Spearman tests indicate a positive monotonic correlation, though not statistically significant, suggesting a complex interplay of factors. The optically thick nature of CO in dense regions may contribute to the observed differences. Our results highlight the need for an accurate CO-to-$\mathrm{H_2}$ conversion factor in deriving column densities, potentially offering an alternative method for identifying CTAGN. Future studies with larger datasets and refined methodologies are essential for a deeper understanding of sub-mm and X-ray properties in AGN.

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce a novel diffusion model for the propagation of cosmic rays (CRs) that incorporates an anisotropic diffusion tensor of a general form within a realistically modeled large-scale Galactic magnetic field. The parameters of the model are consistent with the contemporary understanding of the large-scale Galactic magnetic field structure and the dynamics of small-scale turbulent CR propagation. The paper demonstrates the modulation of spectra of Galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) in the magnetic rigidity range of 1 - 30 PV (the CR knee) and explores the spatial variation of this phenomenon. The observed modulation of the spectrum is explained by changes in the leakage mechanism.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a continuum lag analysis for a sample of 37 relatively high-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) from the Seoul National University AGN Monitoring Project (SAMP), utilizing the light curve data in $B$ and $V$ bands from SAMP and in $g,r,i$ bands from the Zwicky Transient Facility. We find that the inter-band lags ($\tau$) increase with wavelength (i.e., $\tau \propto \lambda^{\sim 4/3}$) as prescribed by the standard disk model (SSD), suggesting consistency with the "lamp-post" reprocessing model. We report that the size of the continuum emitting region (CER) normalized at 2500 Å ($R_{2500}$) is a factor of $\sim$5 (i.e, $0.69\pm0.04$ dex) larger than predicted by SSD. By combining our new measurements with the re-measurements of the literature sample, we report a correlation between $R_{2500}$ and AGN continuum luminosity as $R_{2500} \, \propto \, L_{5100}^{0.58\pm0.03}$, which suggests that the observed continuum could be composed of both the disk emission and the diffuse emission from the broad line region (BLR). The size of CER shows a tight relation with the size of H$\beta$ BLR with a sublinear slope (i.e., $R_{\text{BLR}} \, \propto \, R_{\text{2500}}^{0.87\pm0.07}$) and a scatter of 0.29 dex. This empirical relation offers a promising method for estimating single-epoch black hole masses, once established over a large dynamic range of AGN luminosity.

 - **Abstract**
 Relativistic jets around supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are well-known powerful $\gamma$-ray emitters. In absence of the jets in radio-quiet active galactic nuclei (AGNs), how the SMBHs work in $\gamma$-ray bands is still unknown despite of great observational efforts made in the last 3 decades. Considering the previous efforts, we carefully select an AGN sample composed of 37 nearby Seyfert galaxies with ultra-hard X-rays for the goals of $\gamma$-ray detections by excluding all potential contamination in this band. Adopting a stacking technique, here we report the significant $\gamma$-ray detection (${\rm TS}=30.6$, or $5.2\,\sigma$) from the sample using 15-year Fermi-Large Area Telescope (LAT) observation. We find an average $\gamma$-ray luminosity of the sample as $(1.5\pm1.0)\times10^{40}{\,\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$ at energies from 1-300\,GeV. Limited by the well-known pair production from the interaction of $\gamma$-rays with low energy photons, $\gtrsim$ several GeV $\gamma$-rays are found to originate from an extended corona ($\sim 2.7\times 10^6\,R_{\rm g}$), whereas the canonical much more compact X-ray corona ($\sim 10\,R_{\rm g}$) is responsible for 1 to several GeV $\gamma$-rays. The finding of the compact region lends to strong supports to the long-time theoretical expectations, but the extended corona is beyond all the existing models. One promising scenario is that the electron-positron pairs produced in the compact X-ray corona would expand as fireball, similar to that in $\gamma$-ray bursts, forming the structure of extended corona.

 - **Abstract**
 Elemental abundances in the solar corona differ from those in the photosphere, with low first ionization potential (FIP) elements being enhanced, a phenomenon known as the FIP effect. This enhancement is attributed to ponderomotive forces linked to magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves, particularly incompressible transverse waves. Our study investigates the relationship between coronal abundance fractionation and chromospheric transverse MHD waves by examining the spatial correlation between FIP fractionation and these waves and by analyzing their properties to test the ponderomotive force model. We used H alpha data from the Fast Imaging Solar Spectrograph at the Goode Solar Telescope to detect chromospheric transverse MHD waves and \ion{Si}{X} (low FIP) and \ion{S}{X} (high FIP) spectra from Hinode EUV Imaging Spectrometer to determine relative abundances in an active region. Extrapolated linear force free magnetic fields from Solar Dynamics Observatory/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager magnetograms further linked the observed chromospheric waves with coronal composition. Approximately 400 wave packets were identified and characterized by their period, velocity amplitude, propagation speed, and direction. These incompressible or weakly compressible waves were mainly observed near loop footpoints in the sunspot penumbra and superpenumbral fibrils. Regions of high FIP fractionation coincided with closed magnetic fields where these waves were present, and low-frequency, downward-propagating waves comprised about 43/% of the total. Our results demonstrate a strong correlation between coronal abundance fractionation and chromospheric transverse MHD waves, supporting the view that the FIP effect is driven by the ponderomotive force from these waves.

 - **Abstract**
 Diffuse radio emission in galaxy clusters is a tracer of ultra-relativistic particles and $\mu$G-level magnetic fields, and is thought to be triggered by cluster merger events. In the distant Universe (i.e. $z>0.6$), such sources have been observed only in a handful of systems, and their study is important to understand the evolution of large-scale magnetic fields over the cosmic time. Previous studies of nine {\it Planck} clusters up to $z\sim0.9$ suggest a fast amplification of cluster-scale magnetic fields, at least up to half of the current Universe's age, and steep spectrum cluster scale emission, in line with particle re-acceleration due to turbulence. In this paper, we investigate the presence of diffuse radio emission in a larger sample of galaxy clusters reaching even higher redshifts (i.e. $z\gtrsim1$). We selected clusters from the Massive and Distant Clusters of {\it WISE} Survey (MaDCoWS) with richness $\lambda_{15}>40$ covering the area of the second data release of the LOFAR Two-Meter Sky Survey (LoTSS-DR2) at 144 MHz. These selected clusters are in the redshift range $0.78-1.53$ (with a median value of 1.05). We detect the possible presence of diffuse radio emission, with the largest linear sizes of $350-500$ kpc, in 5 out of the 56 clusters in our sample. If this diffuse radio emission is due to a radio halo, these radio sources lie on or above the scatter of the $P_\nu-M_{500}$ radio halo correlations (at 150 MHz and 1.4 GHz) found at $z<0.6$, depending on the mass assumed. We also find that these radio sources are at the limit of the detection by LoTSS, and therefore deeper observations will be important for future studies.

 - **Abstract**
 The surprising isotropy of the ultra-high-energy cosmic ray (UHECR) sky makes it difficult to identify their sources. Observables such as energy spectrum, mass composition and arrival directions are affected by interactions with background photon fields and by deflection in the extragalactic and galactic magnetic fields (EGMF and GMF). In this work, we simulate the propagation of UHECRs with energy above 8 EeV in magnetized replicas of the local Universe, obtained from constrained simulations of the Large Scale Structure. We obtain the real magnetic deflection in structured EGMF models with realistic three-dimensional simulations. We investigate different scenarios for the UHECR source distributions and densities. The effect of the GMF can be different depending on the field model considered. In this work we consider the JF12 model by mapping the arrival directions at the edge of the galaxy to those at Earth. We study the arrival direction distribution of the propagated UHECRs, and in particular their angular power spectrum, dipole and quadrupole moments. We find that the properties of the source distribution affect the cosmic ray anisotropy more than the EGMF model considered. In particular, the low multipole components depend on both the source distribution and the density. We also find that it is difficult to simultaneously reproduce the observed dipole and quadrupole values above EeV. In general, we predict too large a quadrupole strength, incompatible with observations.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a formalism to predict the Polarization Degree (PD) for synchrotron emission from particles having a specified energy distribution in the presence of an ordered and random magnetic field configuration. The broad band spectral energy distribution as well as the X-ray and optical PD data for Mrk 501 have been fitted using the formalism. As reported earlier, we find that for a broken power law particle energy distribution, the PD cannot be explained, unless it is assumed that the higher energy particles experience a higher ordered magnetic field compared to the lower energy ones. On the other hand, a log parabola particle energy distribution can explain the observed higher X-ray PD compared to the optical, even when all the particles experience the same magnetic configuration. We discuss the possibility of distinguishing the two scenarios using future observations.
#### Seimei KOOLS-IFU mapping of the gas and dust distributions in Galactic PNe: the origin and evolution of DdDm1

 - **Abstract**
 We conduct a detailed study of the planetary nebula (PN) DdDm1 in the Galactic halo field. DdDm1 is a metal-deficient and the most carbon-poor PN (C/O = 0.11 +/- 0.02) identified in the Galaxy. We aim to verify whether it evolved into a PN without experiencing the third dredge-up (TDU) during the thermal pulse asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase and to investigate its origin and evolution through accurate measurements of the physical parameters of the nebula and its central star. We perform a comprehensive investigation of DdDm1 using multiwavelength spectra. The KOOLS-IFU emission line images achieve ~0.9 arcsec resolution, resolving the elliptical nebula and revealing a compact spatial distribution of the [Fe III] line compared to the [O III] line, despite their similar volume emissivities. This indicates that iron, with its higher condensation temperature than oxygen, is easily incorporated into dust grains such as silicate, making the iron abundance estimate prone to underestimation. Using a fully data-driven approach, we directly derive ten elemental abundances, the gas-to-dust mass ratio, and the gas and dust masses based on our own heliocentric distance scale (19.4 kpc) and the emitting volumes of gas and dust. Our analysis reveals that DdDm1 is a unique PN evolved from a single star with an initial mass of ~1.0 Msun and a metallicity Z of 0.18 Zsun. Thus, DdDm1 is the only known PN that is confirmed to have evolved without experiencing TDUs. The photoionization model reproduces all observed quantities in excellent agreement with predictions from AGB nucleosynthesis, post-AGB evolution, and AGB dust production models. Our study provides new insights into the internal evolution of low-mass and metal-deficient stars like DdDm1 and highlights the role of PN progenitors in the chemical enrichment of the Galaxy.
