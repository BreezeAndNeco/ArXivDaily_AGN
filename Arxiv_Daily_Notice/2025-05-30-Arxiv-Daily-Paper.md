 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations suggest a nearly constant gas-phase mass-metallicity relation (MZR) at $z \gtrsim 5$, in agreement with many theoretical predictions. This lack of evolution contrasts with observations at $z \lesssim 3$, which find an increasing normalization of the MZR with decreasing redshift. We analyze a high-redshift suite of FIRE-2 cosmological zoom-in simulations to identify the physical drivers of the MZR. Previous studies have explained the weak evolution of the high-redshift MZR in terms of weakly evolving or saturated gas fractions, but we find this alone does not explain the evolution in FIRE-2. Instead, stellar feedback following intense bursts of star formation drives enriched gas out of galaxies, resetting their interstellar medium and separating their histories into distinct ``burst cycles". We develop the ``Reduced Burst Model", a simplified gas-regulator model that successfully reproduces the simulated MZR and identifies the dominant drivers of its evolution. As redshift decreases, the metallicity of inflows within burst cycles increases at fixed stellar mass due to increased wind recycling of enriched gas. Meanwhile, the metal mass produced by stars per inflowing gas mass within these cycles decreases because of decreased star formation per gas mass inflowing into the galaxy. The effects of these two processes on the median metallicity largely cancel, holding the MZR constant for $z = 5 - 12$. At fixed stellar mass, the simulations predict lower gas metallicities at higher $\rm H\alpha$-derived star formation rates, in qualitative agreement with the fundamental metallicity relation (FMR), but this effect is reduced in rest UV-selected samples.

 - **Abstract**
 The upcoming stage IV wide-field surveys will provide high precision measurements of the large-scale structure (LSS) of the universe. Their interpretation requires fast and accurate theoretical predictions including large scales. For this purpose, we introduce $\texttt{SwiftC}_\ell$, a fast, accurate and differentiable $\texttt{JAX}$-based pipeline for the computation of the angular power spectrum beyond the Limber approximation. It uses a new FFTLog-based method which can reach arbitrary precision and includes interpolation along $k$, allowing for $k$-dependent growth factor and biases. $\texttt{SwiftC}_\ell$ includes a wide range of probes and effects such as galaxy clustering, including magnification bias, redshift-space distortions and primordial non-Gaussianity, weak lensing, including intrinsic alignment, cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing and CMB integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect. We compare our pipeline to the other available beyond-Limber codes within the N5K challenge from the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) Dark Energy Science Collaboration. $\texttt{SwiftC}_\ell$ computes the 120 different angular power spectra over 103 $\ell$-multipoles in 5 ms on one GPU core. Using a pre-calculation, $\texttt{SwiftC}_\ell$ is thus about 40$\times$ faster than the winner of the N5K challenge with comparable accuracy. Furthermore, all outputs are auto-differentiable, facilitating gradient-based sampling and robust and accurate Fisher forecasts. We showcase a Markov Chain Monte Carlo on an LSST-like survey as well as a Fisher forecast, illustrating $\texttt{SwiftC}_\ell$'s differentiability, speed and reliability in measuring cosmological parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 (Abridged) The relations between stellar ($M_\ast$), gas ($M_{\rm gas}$), baryonic ($M_{\rm bar} = M_\ast + M_{\rm gas}$), and dark matter halo mass ($M_{200}$) provide unique constraints on galaxy formation and cosmology. The shape of the relations constrains how galaxies regulate their growth through gas accretion, star formation, and feedback; their scatter probes the stochasticity of galaxy assembly. Here, we assemble a sample of 49 nearby gas-rich dwarf and massive disc galaxies with unmatched ancillary data. We obtain their gas kinematics and derive their dark matter properties through rotation curve decomposition. Our sample allows us to study the galaxy-halo connection across nearly six orders of magnitude in $M_\ast$. We find that the $M_{\rm gas}-M_{200}$ relation rises monotonically, with galaxies having around 4 per cent of the average cosmological baryon fraction in cold gas. Contrastingly, the $M_\ast-M_{200}$ relation shows a more complex behaviour. A particularly interesting finding is that of a population of baryon-deficient' dwarfs (BDDs) with stellar masses $\sim 1-1.5$ orders of magnitude lower than expected from current models. Yet, baryon-rich galaxies also exist, and we find a large spread in the baryon retention fraction across our galaxies. We compare our findings with semi-analytic and hydrodynamical galaxy formation simulations. While the simulations broadly reproduce most observed features, they struggle to match the BDDs and do not capture the diversity in baryon fractions. Understanding these differences will shed new light on how feedback regulates galaxy formation. Finally, we study the dark matter halo concentration-mass relation. We find that below $M_{200} \sim 10^{11}\,M_\odot$, the concentrations are systematically lower than expected. We discuss whether these results stem from the influence of baryonic physics or the environment.
#### The Co-Evolution of Stellar Wind-blown Bubbles and Photoionized Gas I: Physical Principles and a Semi-Analytic Model

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a new framework for the simultaneous feedback of stellar winds and photo-ionizing radiation from massive stars, distinguishing the locations where forces are applied, and consequences for internal spatio-temporal evolution of the whole feedback bubble (FB). We quantify the relative dynamical importance of wind-blown bubbles (WBB) versus the photoionized region (PIR) by the ratio of the radius at which the WBB is in pressure equilibrium with the PIR, $R_{\rm eq}$, to the Strömgren radius, $R_{\rm St}$. $\zeta \equiv R_{\rm eq}/R_{\rm St}$ quantifies the dynamical dominance of WBBs ($\zeta > 1$) or the PIR ($\zeta < 1$). We calculate $\zeta$ and find that, for momentum-driven winds, $0.1 \lesssim \zeta \lesssim 1$ for the star-forming regions in (i) typical Milky Way-like giant molecular clouds (GMCs), (ii) the most massive of individual OB stars, and (iii) dense, low-metallicity environments, relevant in the early universe. In this regime, both WBBs and the PIR are dynamically important to the expansion of the FB. We develop a semi-analytic Co-Evolution Model (CEM) that takes into account the spatial distribution of forces and the back reactions of both the WBB and PIR. In the $\zeta <1$ regime where the CEM is most relevant, the model differs in the total FB momentum by up to 25% compared to naive predictions. In the weak-wind limit of $\zeta \ll 1$, applicable to individual OB stars or low-mass clusters, the CEM has factors $\gtrsim 2$ differences in WBB properties. In a companion paper we compare these models to three-dimensional, turbulent hydro-dynamical simulations.
#### The Co-Evolution of Stellar Wind-blown Bubbles and Photoionized Gas II: 3D RMHD Simulations and Tests of Semi-Analytic Models

 - **Abstract**
 In a companion paper (Paper I) we presented a Co-Evolution Model (CEM) in which to consider the evolution of feedback bubbles driven by massive stars through both stellar winds and ionizing radiation, outlining when either of these effects is dominant and providing a model for how they evolve together. Here we present results from three-dimensional radiation magneto-hydrodynamical (RMHD) simulations of this scenario for parameters typical of massive star-forming clouds in the Milky Way: precisely the regime where we expect both feedback mechanisms to matter. While we find that the CEM agrees with the simulations to within 25% for key parameters and modestly outperforms previous idealized models, disagreements remain. We show that these deviations originate mainly from the CEM's lack of (i) background inhomogeneity caused by turbulence and (ii) time-variable momentum enhancements in the wind-blown bubble (WBB). Additionally, we find that photoionized gas acts similarly to magnetic fields ([as in Lancaster et al. 2024a) by decreasing the WBB's surface area. This causes a decrease in the amount of cooling at the WBB's interface, resulting in an enhanced WBB dynamical impact.

 - **Abstract**
 It is necessary to understand the full accretion history of the Milky Way in order to contextualize the properties of observed Milky Way satellite galaxies and the stellar halo. This paper compares the dynamical properties and star-formation histories of surviving and disrupted satellites around Milky Way-like galaxies using the DC Justice League suite of very high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations of Milky Way analogs and their halo environments. We analyze the full census of galaxies accreted within the past 12 Gyrs, which including both surviving satellites at $z=0$, and dwarf galaxies that disrupted and merged with the host prior to $z=0$. Our simulations successfully reproduce the trends in $M_*$-[Fe/H]-[$\alpha$/Fe] observed in surviving Milky Way satellites and disrupted stellar streams, indicating earlier star-formation for disrupted progenitors. We find the likelihood and timescales for quenching and disruption are strongly correlated with the mass and time of infall. In particular, none of the galaxies accreted more than 12 Gyrs ago survived, and only 20% of all accreted galaxies with $M_*>10^8M_\odot$ survive. Additionally, satellites with highly radial trajectories are more likely to quench and disrupt. Disruption proceeds quickly for $\geq10^6M_\odot$ satellites accreted $10{-}12$ Gyr ago, often on timescales similar to the $\sim300$ Myr snapshot spacing. For high-mass satellites, the disruption timescale is faster than the quenching timescale. As a result, 92% of disrupted galaxies remain star-forming up until disruption. In contrast, Ultra Faint Dwarfs (UFDs) tend to quench prior to accretion, and 94% of UFDs accreted up to 12 Gyr ago survive at $z=0$.

 - **Abstract**
 Knowledge of the broad-band active galactic nuclei (AGN) spectral energy distribution (SED) that ionizes the gas-rich broad emission line region is key to understanding the various radiative processes at play and their importance that eventually leads to the emission line formation. We modeled a spectral energy distribution for highly accreting quasars, also known as extreme population A sources, based mainly on observational data available in astronomical databases, and on accretion disk models for the unobservable far-UV domain. Our selection criterion is the RFeII parameter - the ratio of the optical FeII emission between 4434 A and 4684 A to the H-beta 4861 A intensity, RFeII > 1. This criterion is satisfied by highly-accreting, possibly super-Eddington, black holes. We analyzed 155 sources up to a redshift of approximately 1, previously reported in the literature, to construct a median radio-quiet SED spanning from radio to X-ray wavelengths. We find that the SED of quasars exhibits distinct features compared to lower accreting AGN, including a pronounced big blue bump and strong optical/UV emission along with a steep X-ray continuum. We classify the sources into radio-quiet, radio-intermediate, and radio-loud categories, observing that radio-intermediate and a subsample of radio-quiet AGN show a significant far-IR excess over the radio-quiet SED and the far-IR excess appears to be related to the prominence of Feii emission. There is an overall consistency between the new SED and the one obtained for high Eddington ratio quasars in previous work. We provide the SEDs in digital format for eventual applications.

 - **Abstract**
 The light curves of the microlensing events MOA-2022-BLG-091 and KMT-2024-BLG-1209 exhibit anomalies with very similar features. These anomalies appear near the peaks of the light curves, where the magnifications are moderately high, and are distinguished by weak caustic-crossing features with minimal distortion while the source remains inside the caustic. To achieve a deeper understanding of these anomalies, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the lensing events. We carried out binary-lens modeling with a thorough exploration of the parameter space. This analysis revealed that the anomalies in both events are of planetary origin, although their exact interpretation is complicated by different types of degeneracy. In the case of MOA-2022-BLG-091, the main difficulty in the interpretation of the anomaly arises from a newly identified degeneracy related to the uncertain angle at which the source trajectory intersects the planet-host axis. For KMT-2024-BLG-1209, the interpretation is affected by the previously known inner-outer degeneracy, which leads to ambiguity between solutions in which the source passes through either the inner or outer caustic region relative to the planet host. Bayesian analysis indicates that the planets in both lens systems are giant planets with masses about 2 to 4 times that of Jupiter, orbiting early K-type main-sequence stars. Both systems are likely located in the Galactic disk at a distance of around 4 kiloparsecs. The degeneracy in KMT-2024-BLG-1209 is challenging to resolve because it stems from intrinsic similarities in the caustic structures of the degenerate solutions. In contrast, the degeneracy in MOA-2022-BLG-091, which occurs by chance rather than from inherent characteristics, is expected to be resolved by the future space based Roman RGES microlensing survey.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we investigate the effect of resistivity on the dynamics of global magnetohydrodynamic accretion flows (Res-MHD) around a spinning supermassive black hole. We perform a comparative study of 2D and 3D resistive models around black holes. We examine accretion flow dynamics considering globally uniform resistivity values, ranging from $\sim 0$ to 0.1. During the simulation time of $t \lesssim 1000~t_g$, we find that the mass accretion rate is comparable for both the 2D and 3D models. However, as the flow becomes increasingly turbulent, non-axisymmetric effects begin to dominate, resulting in significant differences in the mass accretion rates between the 3D and 2D. All the resistive models in a highly magnetized flow belong to the Magnetically Arrested Disk (MAD) state. We propose an efficient and physically motivated approach to examine the magnetic state by estimating the spatial average plasma beta parameter across the computational domain. We find that when the average plasma beta is close to or below unity $( \beta_{\text{ave}} \lesssim 1 )$, the accretion flow enters the MAD state. Additionally, we find that high-resistivity flow reduces magnetorotational instability (MRI) turbulence in the accretion flow, while the turbulence structures remain qualitatively similar in low-resistivity flows. Moreover, we observe indications of plasmoid formations in low-resistivity flow compared to high-resistivity flow. Furthermore, we do not find a clear relationship between the variability of the accretion rate, magnetic flux, and resistivity. Lastly, our findings suggest that low-resistivity models produce higher power jets than those with higher resistivity.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an investigation of the compact structure of the AGN 2021+317 based on multi-epoch Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations at 15, 22, and 43 GHz in the period from 2013 through 2024. The VLBI images show a core-jet structure extended to the south, with two stationary components in the northern region, one of which likely to be the core of the source. We also detected two new moving jet components (S4 and S5) in the observations of 2021. Based on these observational findings, we analyzed two distinctive jet models, involving one or another stationary component mentioned above as the jet core. One model assumes a moderate bulk motion velocity, a wider viewing angle, and a lower Doppler factor, with the magnetic field energy density significantly dominating over non-thermal particle energy density. The other model involves a higher bulk motion velocity, a narrower viewing angle, and a higher Doppler factor, with an even greater dominance of magnetic field energy in the core. The position angle of the jet ridge line rotates counter-clockwise over the observed period. The apparent kinematics of the jet components is more consistent with a model of the precessing jet, which has recently completed the first half of the precession cycle. Our results provide constraints on the dynamic evolution of the jet and its interaction with the surrounding medium.
#### Detecting Atmospheric CO2 Trends as Population-Level Signatures for Long-Term Stable Water Oceans and Biotic Activity on Temperate Terrestrial Exoplanets

 - **Abstract**
 Identifying key observables is essential for enhancing our knowledge of exoplanet habitability and biospheres, as well as improving future mission capabilities. While currently challenging, future observatories such as the Large Interferometer for Exoplanets (LIFE) will enable atmospheric observations of a diverse sample of temperate terrestrial worlds. Using thermal emission spectra that represent conventional predictions of atmospheric CO2 variability across the Habitable Zone (HZ), we assess the ability of the LIFE mission - as a specific concept for a future space-based interferometer - to detect CO2 trends indicative of the carbonate-silicate (Cb-Si) weathering feedback, a well-known habitability marker and potential biological tracer. Therefore, we explore the feasibility of differentiating between CO2 trends in biotic and abiotic planet populations. We create synthetic exoplanet populations based on geochemistry-climate predictions and perform retrievals on simulated thermal emission observations. The results demonstrate the robust detection of population-level CO2 trends in both biotic and abiotic scenarios for population sizes as small as 30 Exo-Earth Candidates (EECs) and the lowest assessed spectrum quality in terms of signal-to-noise ratio, S/N = 10, and spectral resolution, R = 50. However, biased CO2 partial pressure constraints hinder accurate differentiation between biotic and abiotic trends. If these biases were corrected, accurate differentiation could be achieved for populations with $\geq$ 100 EECs. We conclude that LIFE can effectively enable population-level characterization of temperate terrestrial atmospheres and detect Cb-Si cycle driven CO2 trends as habitability indicators. Nevertheless, the identified biases underscore the importance of testing atmospheric characterization performance against the broad diversity expected for planetary populations.

 - **Abstract**
 Intensive reverberation mapping monitoring programs combine ground-based photometric observations from different telescopes, requiring intercalibration of lightcurves to reduce systematic instrumental differences. We present a new iterative algorithm to calibrate photometric time-series data of active galactic nuclei (AGN) using 100s of comparison stars on the same images, building upon the established method of ensemble photometry. The algorithm determines telescope-specific and epoch-specific correction parameters, and simultaneously computes a multi-component noise model to account for underestimated uncertainties based on the scatter in the comparison star data, effectively identifying problematic epochs, telescopes, and stars. No assumptions need to be made about the AGN variability shape, and the algorithm can in principle be applied to any astronomical object. We demonstrate our method on lightcurves taken with ten 1-m telescopes from the Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) robotic telescope network. Comparing our results to other intercalibration tools, we find that the algorithm can more accurately quantify the uncertainties in the data. We describe additional corrections that can be made for particularly bluer AGNs like Fairall 9, arising due to systematic effects dependent on star colour.
#### A view of the CIZA J2242.8+5301 galaxy cluster at very low radio frequencies

 - **Abstract**
 The galaxy cluster CIZA J2242.8+5301 is a well-studied merging galaxy cluster that hosts prominent double radio relics including the famous sausage relic, as well as other diffuse radio sources. Observations at frequencies below 100 MHz are essential for investigating the physics of radio relics as they provide unique access to the low-energy population of cosmic-ray electrons. We aim to study the morphology, spectral characteristics, and physical processes that produce relics. We present the first observations of the Sausage cluster at 45 MHz, the lowest radio frequency at which this cluster has been studied to date, using the Low Band Antenna (LBA) of the LOFAR radio interferometer. We made use of ten hours of LOFAR LBA observations, from which we achieved a thermal-noise limited radio image with a noise level of 1.5 mJy/beam at a resolution of 15 arcsec. These data were combined with existing multi-frequency measurements at higher frequencies: LOFAR High Band Antenna, Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope, Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope, and Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array. This broad frequency coverage allowed us to derive integrated spectral indices, spectral index and curvature maps, and Mach number distributions across the relics. We derived Mach numbers from the local injection index measure using low-frequency data with M_N = 2.9 +-0.5 for the northern relic and M_S = 2.9+-0.8 for the southern relic. LOFAR LBA observations reveal a remarkably symmetric surface brightness profile across the eastern part of the northern relic, with wings extending on either side of the peak. This discovery is contrary to the expectation of particle acceleration at a single, sharp shock and the subsequent downstream advection of accelerated electrons. We modelled the surface brightness profile, including the effects of projection, magnetic field variation, and shock deformation.

 - **Abstract**
 The stability of an accretion disc surrounding a millisecond pulsar is analysed from an energetic point of view, using magnetohydrodynamic simulations that consider realistic disc structures and a variety of magnetic field inclination angles. The time-averaged components of the magnetic field interact with the disc through ohmic dissipation, which causes heating and partial evaporation of its innermost region. The stability of the disc right after the magnetic field is turned on is analysed as a function of the location of the inner radius of the disc and the magnetic inclination angle. Our results show that the disc is severely altered in those cases where its inner radius lies well beyond the light cylinder and the magnetic axis is not totally aligned with the neutron star spin axis. Overall, the results of the simulations agree with those obtained in previous works where analytical or semi-analytical energy models were also used to discuss the stability of the disc. The implications for the understanding of the transitional millisecond pulsars are discussed. We briefly mention implications of our results for low-mass X-ray binaries and supernova fallback discs.

 - **Abstract**
 Time-correlated variations in the pulse profiles of radio pulsars provide insights into changes in their magnetospheres. For a small number of pulsars (~20), these variations have been shown to correlate with spin-down rate. Many of these profile changes involve small (few percent) variations in the relative intensity of different profile components, and hence tools such as Gaussian process regression have been employed to separate the time-correlated profile variation from intrinsic noise. In this paper, we present a computationally efficient approximation of a 2-D Gaussian process model that enhances sensitivity by simultaneously tracking time- and phase-correlated signals. Applying this model to 26 pulsars observed at the Jodrell Bank Observatory, we detect significant profile shape variations in 21 pulsars. Using principal component analysis, we confirm spin-down correlated shape variations in 11 pulsars where this had been previously observed. Additionally, we find evidence of spin-down correlated shape changes in 7 pulsars for the first time (PSRs B0105+65, B0611+22, B0626+24, B1740-03, B1826-17, B1917+00, and B2148+63). We look in greater detail at PSR B0740-28, where the correlation between profile shape and spin-down itself seems to switch between quasi-stable states. Notably the profile shape associated with greater spin-down seems to invert at times, presenting a challenge to our understanding of the physical processes at work.

 - **Abstract**
 OT 355 (4FGL J1734.3 + 3858) is a relatively rarely studied but highly variable, moderate-redshift (z = 0.975) flat-spectrum radio quasar (blazar). With this work, we aim to study its optical variability on different timescales, which can help us to better understand the physical processes in relativistic jets operating in blazar-type active galactic nuclei. OT 355 was observed in four colors (BVRI) during 41 nights between 2017 and 2023 using three 1 and 2 m class telescopes. The object was also monitored on intra-night timescales, for about 100 h in total. In addition, secondary standard stars in the field of OT 355 were calibrated in order to facilitate future photometric studies. We detected significant intra-night and night-to-night variations of up to 0.5 mag. Variability characteristics, color changes, and a possible ``rms-flux'' relation were studied and discussed. Using simple arguments, we show that a negative ``rms-flux'' relation should be expected if many independent processes/regions drive the short-term variability via Doppler factor changes, which is not observed in this and other cases. This finding raises arguments for the idea that more complex multiplicative processes are responsible for blazar variability. Studying blazar variability, especially on the shortest possible timescales, can help to estimate the strength and geometry of their magnetic fields, the linear sizes of the emitting regions, and other aspects, which may be of importance for constraining and modeling blazars' emitting mechanisms.

 - **Abstract**
 A comprehensive analysis of quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in the gamma-ray emissions of blazars. Utilizing 15 years of Fermi-LAT observations of seven blazars in our sample, we identify both long-term and transient quasi-periodic oscillations in the gamma-ray light curves, with timescales ranging from a few months to years. These periodicities were detected using the Lomb-Scargle periodogram and REDFIT techniques. To robustly evaluate the statistical significance of the quasi-periodic signals observed in the Lomb-Scargle Periodograms, 30,000 synthetic $\gamma$-ray light curves were generated for each source using a stochastic model known as the Damped Random Walk (DRW) process. To investigate the physical origin of the observed gamma-ray QPOs with different timescales, we explore several plausible scenarios, with particular emphasis on a relativistic jet hosted by one of the black holes in a supermassive binary black hole system, jet precession, and helical motion of magnetized plasma blob within the jet. The $\gamma$-ray light curves exhibiting long-timescale quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) are analyzed within the framework of a supermassive binary black hole (SMBBH) model, employing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach, allowing us to constrain key physical parameters such as the jet Lorentz factor ($\Gamma$) and the viewing angle between the observer's line of sight ($\psi$) relative to the spin axis of SMBH.

 - **Abstract**
 AT2022rze is a luminous, ambiguous transient located South-East of the geometric center of its host galaxy at redshift z = 0.08. The host appears to be formed by a merging galaxy system. The observed characteristics of AT2022rze are reminiscent of active galactic nuclei (AGN), tidal disruption events (TDEs), and superluminous supernovae (SLSNe). The transient reached a peak absolute magnitude of -20.2 +- 0.2 mag, showing a sharp rise (trise,1/e = 27.5 +- 0.6 days) followed by a slow decline (tdec,1/e = 382.9 +- 0.6). Its bumpy light curve and narrow Balmer lines indicate the presence of gas (and dust). Its light curve shows rather red colors, indicating that the transient could be affected by significant host extinction. The spectra reveal coronal lines, indicative of high-energy (X-ray/UV) emission. Archival data reveal no prior activity at this location, disfavoring a steady-state AGN, although an optical spectrum obtained prior to the transient is consistent with an AGN classification of the host. Based on this, we conclude that the transient most likely represents a Changing-look AGN at the center of the smallest component of the merging system.

 Pre-impact detection asteroids (PIDAs) may be detected only a few hours before their impact with Earth, providing a brief opportunity to characterize them before impact. We describe the characterization of PIDA 2024 RW$_1$, which was discovered by the Catalina Sky Survey on 2024 September 4 at 05:43 UTC, before it entered the atmosphere near the northern Philippines at 16:39 UTC. We observed 2024 RW$_1$ with the Astrophysical Research Consortium Telescope Imaging Camera on the Apache Point Astrophysical Research Consortium's 3.5-m telescope on 2024 September 4 10:16 UTC. We obtained g, r, i, and z photometry of 2024 RW$_1$, yielding color indices of g-r = 0.47$\pm$0.04, r-i = 0.13$\pm$0.04, i-z = -0.11$\pm$0.07, and g-i = 0.60$\pm$0.04, corresponding to a spectral slope of 0.67$\pm$0.40~$\%$/100 nm. The closest match to an asteroid spectral type is with B-type asteroids from the C-complex. We detect variations in the time series photometry of the asteroid with an amplitude of $\sim$0.75, and a double-peaked rotation period of $\sim$1900 s. Assuming a visible albedo of 0.07 and a density of $\sim$1500 kg/m$^3$, and using the derived absolute magnitude of 32.2$\pm$0.5, we calculate that the asteroid has a diameter of 1.8$\pm$0.4 m and a total mass of $\sim$5000 kg. The most likely source of 2024 RW$_1$ is the 3:1 mean motion resonance followed by the $\nu_6$ resonance, according to NEOMOD3.

 - **Abstract**
 The frequency of compact object interactions in AGN discs is naturally tied to the number of objects embedded within it. We investigate the evolution of black holes in the nuclear stellar cluster on inclined orbits to the AGN disc by performing adiabatic hydrodynamical simulations of isolated black hole disc crossings over a range of disc densities and inclinations $i\in[2^\circ,15^\circ]$. We find radiation dominates the pressure in the wake that forms around the BH across the full inclination and disc density range. We identify no well defined steady state wake morphology due to the thin geometry of the disc and the vertical exponential density drop off, where the wake morphology depends on the vertical depth of the transit within the disc. The inclination damping $\Delta i$ relative the pre-transit inclination behaves as a power law in $\sin(i)$ and the ambient Hill mass $m_\text{H,0}$ as $\Delta i/i \propto m_{\rm H,0}^{0.4} \sin(i)^{-2.7}$. The drag on the BH is dominated by the gravity of the wake for the majority of our inclination range until accretion effects become comparable at $\sin(i)\gtrsim30H_0/R_0$, where $H_0/R_0$ is the disc aspect ratio. At low inclinations ($\sin(i)\lesssim3H_0/R_0$) the wake morphology becomes more spherical, leading to a regime change in the inclination damping behaviour. Our results suggest that the inclination damping timescale is shorter than expected from only episodic Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttelton accretion events during each transit, implying inclined objects may captured by the AGN disc earlier in its lifetime than previously thought.
