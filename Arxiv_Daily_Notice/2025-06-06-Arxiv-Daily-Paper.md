 - **Abstract**
 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are standardisable candles: their peak magnitudes can be corrected for correlations between light curve properties and their luminosities to precisely estimate distances. Understanding SN Ia standardisation across wavelength improves methods for correcting SN Ia magnitudes. Using 150 SNe Ia from the Foundation Supernova Survey and Young Supernova Experiment, we present the first study focusing on SN Ia standardisation properties in the z band. Straddling the optical and near-infrared, SN Ia light in the z band is less sensitive to dust extinction and can be collected alongside the optical on CCDs. Pre-standardisation, SNe Ia exhibit less residual scatter in z-band peak magnitudes than in the g and r bands. SNe Ia peak z-band magnitudes still exhibit a significant dependence on light-curve shape. Post-standardisation, the z-band Hubble diagram has a total scatter of RMS = 0.195 mag. We infer a z-band mass step of $\gamma_{z} = -0.105 \pm 0.031$ mag, which is consistent within 1$\sigma$ of that estimated from gri data, assuming Rv = 2.61. When assuming different Rv values for high and low mass host galaxies, the z-band and optical mass steps remain consistent within 1$\sigma$. Based on current statistical precision, these results suggest dust reddening cannot fully explain the mass step. SNe Ia in the z band exhibit complementary standardisability properties to the optical that can improve distance estimates. Understanding these properties is important for the upcoming Vera Rubin Observatory and Nancy G. Roman Space Telescope, which will probe the rest-frame z band to redshifts 0.1 and 1.8.

 - **Abstract**
 We present spatially-resolved stellar kinematics of 15 massive ($M_*=10^{10.5-11.5}M_{\odot}$) quiescent galaxies at $z\sim1.2-2.3$ from the JWST-SUSPENSE program. This is the largest sample of spatially-resolved kinematic measurements of quiescent galaxies at cosmic noon to date. Our measurements are derived from ultra-deep NIRSpec/MSA stellar absorption line spectra, using a forward modelling approach that accounts for optics, source morphology, positioning, and data reduction effects. 10 out of 15 galaxies are orientated such that we can measure rotational support. Remarkably, all 10 galaxies show significant rotation ($V_{r_e}=117-345$km/s, $\sigma_0 = 180-387$km/s), and are classified as "fast rotators" from their spin parameter. The remaining galaxies are too misaligned with respect to the slit to constrain their rotational velocities. The widespread rotational support in our sample indicates that the process responsible for quenching star formation in early massive galaxies did not destroy rotating disc structures. When combined with other quiescent galaxy samples at $z\sim0.5-2.5$, we find a trend between rotational support and age, with younger quiescent galaxies being more rotationally supported. This age trend has also been found at $z\sim0$, and likely explains why our high-redshift galaxies show more rotational support compared to massive ETGs at $z\sim0$, which are, on average, older. Our kinematic modelling also enables us to calculate dynamical masses. These dynamical masses greatly exceed the stellar masses for our sample (median $M_{\text{dyn}}/M_*=2.7$); they even allow for the bottom-heavy IMF found in the cores of low-$z$ massive ellipticals. Altogether, our results support a scenario in which distant quiescent galaxies evolve into nearby massive ETGs, gradually building up their outskirts and simultaneously losing rotation, due to a series of (mostly minor) mergers.

 - **Abstract**
 In early 2024, ESA formally adopted the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) space mission with the aim of measuring gravitational waves emitted in the millihertz range. The constellation employs three spacecraft that exchange laser beams to form interferometric measurements over a distance of 2.5 million kilometers. The measurements will then be telemetered down to Earth at a lower sampling frequency. Anti-aliasing filters will be used on board to limit spectral folding of out-of-band laser noise. The dominant noise in these measurements is laser frequency noise which does not cancel naturally in LISA's unequal-arm heterodyne interferometers. Suppression of this noise requires time-shifting of the data using delay operators to build virtual beam paths that simulate equal-arm interferometers. The non-commutativity of these delay operators and on-board filters manifests as a noise (flexing-filtering) that significantly contributes to the noise budget. This non-commutativity is a consequence of the non-flatness of the filter in-band. Attenuation of this noise requires high-order and computationally expensive filters, putting additional demands on the spacecraft. The following work studies an alternative method to reduce this flexing filtering noise via the introduction of a modified delay operator that accounts for the non-commutativity with the filter in the delay operation itself. Our approach allows us to reduce the flexing-filtering noise by over six orders of magnitude whilst reducing the dependency on the flatness of the filter. The work is supplemented by numerical simulations of the data processing chain that compare the results with those of the standard approach.

 - **Abstract**
 NASA's Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (Roman) will provide an opportunity to study dark energy with unprecedented precision and accuracy using several techniques, including measurements of high-$z$ Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia, $z \lesssim 3.0$) via the High-Latitude Time Domain Survey (HLTDS). In this work, we do an initial "benchmark" characterization of the photometric repeatability of stellar fluxes, which must be below $1\%$ when sky noise is subdominant in order xto enable a number of calibration requirements. Achieving this level of flux precision requires attention to Roman's highly-structured, spatially-varying, undersampled PSF. In this work, we build a library of effective PSFs (ePSFs) compatible with the OpenUniverse HLTDS simulations. Using our library of ePSFs, we recover fractional flux between $0.6 - 1.2\%$ photometric precision, finding that redder bands perform better by this metric. We also find that flux recovery is improved by up to $20\%$ when a chip (sensor chip assembly; SCA) is divided into 8 sub-SCAs in order to account for the spatial variation of the PSF. With our optimized algorithm, we measure non-linearity due to photometry (magnitude dependence) of $|s_{NL}| < 1.93 \times 10^{-3}$ per dex, which is still larger than stated requirements for detector effects and indicates that further work is necessary. We also measure the dependence of photometric residuals on stellar color, and find the largest possible dependence in R062, implying a color-dependent PSF model may be needed. Finally, we characterize the detection efficiency function of each OpenUniverse Roman filter, which will inform future studies.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a minimally model-dependent framework for testing late-time cosmological models using Uncalibrated Cosmic Standards (UCS), including standard rulers and standard candles, without relying on absolute calibrations. The method exploits a tight, model-insensitive correlation between the sound horizons at recombination and the drag epoch. By avoiding dependence on pre-recombination physics and the amplitude of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) power spectra, the UCS framework reduces potential early-time biases while retaining much of the constraining power of full analyses. Applying UCS to the recent dynamical dark energy (DE) study that reported deviations from $\Lambda$CDM, we find the constraints shift systematically toward the $\Lambda$CDM case, suggesting the present of pre-recombination physics or systematics that likely affect the scale-dependence of the CMB spectra. We also observe a mild tension between uncalibrated standard rulers and candles, which can be largely mitigated by introducing a redshift-dependent magnitude bias in the supernova (SNe Ia) data. Our results highlights the importance of isolating post-recombination observables for testing late-time models in the era of precision cosmology, positioning UCS analysis as a robust framework for upcoming galaxy surveys.
#### Long Term Reverberation Mapping of Iron Coronal Lines in MKN 110

 - **Abstract**
 We present flux measurements of the coronal lines [Fe VII] and [Fe X] spanning three decades, in the highly variable Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) MKN 110. These coronal lines are sensitive to the spectral energy distribution (SED) of AGNs in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV). Neither [Fe VII] nor [Fe X] demonstrates variability in the short term on a weekly or monthly timescale. However, by taking advantage of a long term decrease in the continuum flux of MKN 110 on the order of years, we were able to track the [Fe VII] and [Fe X] fluxes as they respond to the continuum. We were able to detect a lag for [Fe VII] relative to the continuum at 5100 Å, with a modal lag of 652 days, but were unable to detect a significant lag in the [Fe x] flux, though there exist significant uncertainties in the [Fe X] fit. These two lag results are not consistent and the line widths for the two line species also do not match. This provides strong evidence for stratification within the coronal line region (CLR). There is also evidence of a non-varying component within the coronal line flux, probably a result of a more extended region of origin. Taken together, these results suggest a CLR where the bulk of the [Fe VII] originates on parsec scales, but a portion of the [Fe VII] flux originates further out, at or beyond a 10 pc scale. These results also indicate the limitations of single-cloud models in describing the physical conditions of the CLR.

 - **Abstract**
 The chemical characterization of galaxies in the first billion years after the Big Bang is one of the central goals of current astrophysics. Optical/near-infrared spectroscopy of long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have been heralded as an effective diagnostic to probe the interstellar medium of their host galaxies and their metal and dust content, up to the highest redshift. An opportunity to fulfill this expectation was provided by the recent blast triggered by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory of GRB 240218A at redshift z=6.782. We study a high-redshift galaxy selected in a complementary way with respect to flux-limited surveys, not depending on galaxy luminosity and stellar mass. We present the VLT/X-shooter spectrum of its afterglow enabling the detection of neutral-hydrogen, low-ionization, high-ionization and fine-structure absorption lines. We determine the metallicity, kinematics and chemical abundance pattern, providing the first detailed characterization of the neutral gas of a galaxy at z>6.5. From the analysis of fine-structure lines we estimate the distance of the closest gas clouds as $d_{II}=620^{+230}_{-140}$ pc. We determine a high neutral hydrogen column density, $\log(N(HI)/cm^{-2})=22.5\pm0.3$, which is the highest one at z>6 determined so far for a GRB host galaxy, as well as a surprisingly high metal column density, $\log(N(ZnII)/cm^{-2})>14.3$. The observed metallicity of the host galaxy system is [Zn/H]>-0.8. We find evidence of a high amount of dust depletion and of aluminum overabundance, although a number of transitions are saturated. The high hydrogen column density, metal abundances and dust depletion in the neutral gas align with those of the ionized gas of very high-redshift galaxies unveiled by ALMA and JWST, testifying that a rapid build up of metals and dust, and massive neutral hydrogen reservoirs seem to be common features of galaxies in the early Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 REJ1034+396 is one of the few active galactic nuclei with a significant quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO). The QPO has been observed in over 1 Ms of XMM-Newton observations spanning over a decade. We investigate the power spectral density function (PSD) of 7 long (~90 ks) XMM-Newton observations of the active galactic nucleus REJ1034+396 in two energy bands. The soft (0.3-0.5 keV) band targets emission from the disk, while the hard (2-7 keV) band isolates the primary X-ray continuum emission from the corona. The QPO is significantly detected in the hard band of 5 of the 7 observations. The best fitting models indicate that the QPO detection in both bands is entirely attributable to the coronal emission with no additional contribution from the disk. This explains the strong coherence between the hard and soft bands at the QPO frequency. The covariance spectrum is consistent with this picture as the variability at QPO frequencies is attributed solely to fluctuations in the hot corona. The time lag as a function of energy is well described by a ~2000 s intrinsic soft lag, resulting from the disk responding to emission from the corona, that undergoes phase wrapping at approximately the QPO frequency. By demonstrating that in this system the QPO arises in the corona, we provide new insights into the mechanisms generating QPOs.
#### JWST Insights into Narrow-line Little Red Dots

 - **Abstract**
 James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed a population of red and compact objects with a unique V-shape SED at z >= 4 known as Little Red Dots (LRDs). Most of the LRDs with existing spectral observations exhibit broad Balmer lines and are thus likely to host active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Here we present a study of LRDs with no broad H-alpha component. Our sample consists of five LRDs at z~5 with H-alpha line widths of about 250 km/s. They are selected from 32 LRDs that have NIRSpec high- or medium-resolution grating spectra covering H-alpha. During our construction of the sample, we find that approximately 20 percent of the LRD candidates previously selected do not show red continuum emission but resemble the V-shape spectra due to strong line emission. Compared to normal star-forming galaxies, narrow-line LRDs tend to have relatively higher H-alpha line widths and luminosities. If these LRDs are dominated by galaxies, our SED modeling suggests that they are dusty, compact star-forming galaxies with high stellar masses and star formation rates (SFRs). Alternatively, if their SEDs are produced by AGNs, the inferred central black hole masses (MBH) are in the range of 10^5 to 10^6 solar masses, placing them at the low-mass end of the AGN population. They may represent an early stage of super-Eddington growth, where the black holes have yet to accumulate significant masses. With large measurement uncertainties, these black holes appear slightly overmassive relative to the local MBH-Mstar relation, but consistent or undermassive with respect to the MBH-sigma and MBH-Mdyn relations. We further find that nearly half of the high-redshift broad-line AGNs exhibit V-shape SEDs. (abridged)

 - **Abstract**
 Identifying dwarf galaxies within the Local Volume is crucial for constraining the luminosity function of satellite galaxies in the nearby universe. We report the detection capabilities of dwarf galaxies within the Local Volume using the Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST). Based on the simulated imaging data of CSST, we develop a detection and classification pipeline that combines traditional image-based search techniques with advanced machine learning classification models. The simulated Local Volume dwarf galaxies can be identified using a pre-processing method for "extended source detection", followed by classification with a pretrained ViT-Base model. This pipeline achieves a true positive rate (TPR) exceeding 85% with a false positive rate (FPR) of only 0.1%. We quantify the detection completeness of Local Volume dwarf galaxies across a three-dimensional parameter space defined by absolute magnitude ($M_V$), half-light radius ($R_h$), and heliocentric distance, based on simulated single-exposure CSST wide-field imaging survey data. For unresolved or semi-resolved dwarf galaxies, our method achieves a significantly deeper absolute magnitude detection limit compared to catalog-based approaches, reaching $M_V = -7$ within 10 \Mpc. By combining this image-based approach with traditional stellar catalog-based "matched filter" techniques, our automated framework established in this work can identify dwarf galaxies within 20 \Mpc for the CSST mission.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a statistical, observational study of the $1/f$ range of solar wind turbulence, where $f$ denotes frequency, using in situ data from the Parker Solar Probe (PSP). We compute the energy cascade rate using the third order law of incompressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, incorporating expansion terms to account for solar wind dynamics. Our results reveal a $1/\tau$ dependence of the energy cascade rate, where $\tau$ is the temporal lag, within the $1/f$ range, in contrast to the constant cascade rate in the inertial range. To explain this behavior, we propose a new intermittent model predicting a $1/\ell$ scaling of the cascade rate, where $\ell$ represents the spatial lag. The analysis of the probability density function (PDF) of magnetic field increments confirms the intermittent nature of the parallel fluctuation component, whereas the perpendicular fluctuations are found to be quasi Gaussian. These findings provide new insights into energy transfer processes in the $1/f$ range of solar wind turbulence, with potential applications in planetary magnetosheaths.

 - **Abstract**
 We analysed high time-resolution optical photometric data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) to study the timing behaviour of four intermediate polar-like objects, namely, V1460 Her, 1RXS J045707.4+452751, Swift J0958.0-4208, and V842 Cen. In the case of V1460 Her, we refined the measurement of its orbital period. Long-term observations suggest a gradual decrease in the orbital period of V1460 Her, and the stable light curve during the TESS observations indicates its quiescent state. We detected a beat period of 1290.6 $\pm$ 0.5 s for the first time for the source 1RXS J045707.4+452751, suggesting a possible disc-overflow accretion scenario. For the sources Swift J0958.0-4208 and V842 Cen, we determined periods 6.11 $\pm$ 0.02 h and 3.555 $\pm$ 0.005 h, respectively, which can be provisionally suggested to be orbital periods. These findings provide valuable insights into the accretion processes and long-term evolution of these intriguing binary systems.

 - **Abstract**
 We have conducted a time-resolved spectral analysis of magnetar bursts originating from SGR J1550-5418. Our analysis utilizes a two-step methodology for temporal segmentation of the data. We first generated and fitted overlapping time segments. Subsequently, we obtained non-overlapping time segments with varying lengths based on their spectral evolution patterns, employing a machine learning algorithm called k-means clustering. For the fitting process, we employed three distinct models, namely a modified blackbody (MBB-RCS), a double blackbody (BB+BB), and a power law with an exponential cut-off (COMPT) model. We found that nearly all of the time segments fit well with the COMPT model. Both the average peak energy in the ${\nu}$F${\nu}$ spectra (Epeak) and Photon Index parameters follow a Gaussian distribution with the means ${\sim}$30 keV and -0.5, respectively. Furthermore, there is a strong positive correlation between the cooler and hotter temperature parameters of the BB+BB model, and both two parameters show a Gaussian distribution with peaks ${\sim}$4 keV and 12 keV, respectively. Additionally, we found that the distribution of the temperature parameter of the MBB-RCS model can be fitted with a skewed Gaussian function with a peak ${\sim}$9-10 keV. Lastly, we searched for quasiperiodic spectral oscillations (QPSOs) in the hardness ratio evolution of the bursts. We identified five potential QPSO candidates at frequencies ranging from ${\sim}$15 Hz to ${\sim}$68 Hz. We discuss and compare these results with previous studies.

 - **Abstract**
 The nature of the obscuring material in active galactic nuclei (AGN) can be studied by measuring changes in the line-of-sight column density, $N_{\rm H,los}$, over time. This can be accomplished by monitoring AGN over long periods of time and at all timescales. However, this can only be done for a few selected objects as it is resource intensive. Therefore, the best option currently is to focus on population statistics based on the available archival data. In this work, we estimate a lower limit on the fraction of sources in the local $(z<0.1)$ universe that display spectral variability among observations ($54\pm11$%), indicative of $N_{\rm H,los}$ variability. Interestingly, we also find that the variable fraction is similar for both Seyfert 1 ($f_{\rm Sy1}\sim61^{+13}_{-15}$%) and Seyfert 2 ($f_{\rm Sy2}\sim47\pm15$%) galaxies, and discuss why we might find a slightly higher $f_{\rm Sy1}$. We also present a sample of 43 Seyfert 1 and Seyfert 2 galaxies with multiple Chandra observations whose properties make them promising $N_{\rm H,los}$-variable targets. We discuss the accuracy of our method, and search for potential dependencies on the timescale between variable and non-variable observation pairs within a given source. In agreement with previous studies, we find evidence that more variability occurs on longer timescales than on shorter timescales.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. M stars are preferred targets for studying terrestrial exoplanets, for which we hope to obtain their atmosphere spectra in the next decade. However, M dwarfs have long been known for strong magnetic activity and the ability to frequently produce optical, broadband emission flares. Aims. We aim to characterise the flaring behaviour of young M dwarfs in the temporal, spectral, and energetic dimensions, as well as examine the stellar parameters governing this behaviour, in order to improve our understanding of the energy and frequency of the flare events capable of shaping the exoplanet atmosphere. Methods. Young Moving Group (YMG) members provide a unique age-based perspective on stellar activity. By examining their flare behaviour in conjunction with rotation, mass, and H{\alpha} data, we obtain a comprehensive understanding of flare activity drivers in young stars. Results. We demonstrate that young stars sharing similar stellar parameters can exhibit a variety in flare frequency distributions and that the flare behaviour shows indications of difference between optical and far-UV. We propose that the period of rotation, not the age of the star, can be a good proxy for assessing flaring activity. Furthermore, we recommend that instead of a simple power law for describing the flare frequency distribution, a piecewise power law be used to describe mid-size and large flare distributions in young and active M dwarfs. Conclusions. Using known periods of rotation and fine-tuned power laws governing the flare frequency, we can produce a realistic sequence of flare events to study whether the atmosphere of small exoplanets orbiting M dwarf shall withstand such activity until life can emerge.
#### Radio prospects of extrasolar aurorae polaris as a probe of planetary magnetism

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetized exoplanets are expected to emit auroral cyclotron radiation in the radio regime due to the interactions between their magnetospheres, the interplanetary magnetic field, and the stellar wind. Prospective extrasolar auroral emission detections will constrain the magnetic properties of exoplanets, allowing the assessment of the planets' habitability and their protection against atmospheric escape by photoevaporation, enhancing our understanding of exoplanet formation and demographics. We construct a numerical model to update the estimates of radio emission characteristics of the confirmed exoplanets while quantifying the uncertainties of our predictions for each system by implementing a Monte Carlo error propagation method. We identify 16 candidates that have expected emission characteristics that render them potentially detectable from current ground-based telescopes. Among these, the hot Jupiter tau Bootis b is the most favorable target with an expected flux density of $51^{+36}_{-22}$ mJy. Notably, eleven candidates are super-Earths and sub-Neptunes, for which magnetism is key to understanding the associated demographics. Together with the other predictive works in the literature regarding the characteristics and the geometry of the magnetospheric emissions, our predictions are expected to guide observational campaigns in pursuit of discovering magnetism on exoplanets.

 V1674 Her is one of the fastest novae, of which the very early phase is well observed including optical rise to the peak over 10 magnitudes. We present a full theoretical light curve model of V1674 Her. Our $1.35~M_\odot$ white dwarf (WD) model with the mass accretion rate of $1\times 10^{-11}~M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ explains overall properties including a very fast rise and decay of the optical $V$ light curve. The WD photosphere expands up to $21 ~R_\odot$, thus, a $0.26 ~M_\odot$ companion star orbiting the WD every 3.67 hours, is engulfed 2.7 hours after the onset of thermonuclear runaway, and appears 5.3 days after that. The duration of X-ray flash is only 0.96 hours. The evolution of the expanding envelope and temporal change of the photospheric radius are very consistent with observed optical and X-ray modulations with the orbital and spin (501 s) periods. We confirmed that the decay phase of nova light curve is well approximated by a sequence of steady-state envelope solutions. Using time-stretching method of nova light curves, we obtain the $V$ band distance modulus of $(m-M)_V= 16.3\pm 0.2$, and determine the distance to be $d=8.9\pm 1$ kpc for the interstellar extinction of $E(B-V)= 0.5 \pm 0.05$.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of a $z\sim3.9$ protocluster identified from Atacama Large Millimetre/sub-millimetre Array Band 3 spectral scans of a bright radio source selected from the GaLactic and Extra-galactic All-sky Murchison Widefield Array (GLEAM) survey. Extended CO(4-3) and [CI](1-0) line emission was detected in GLEAM J005332$-$325630 confirming it to be a $z=3.879$ powerful radio galaxy with luminosity, $L_{500 MHz}=1.3\times10^{28}$ ${W Hz}^{-1}$. This source is part of a sample of candidate high redshift radio galaxies with bright radio fluxes, $S_{150MHz}>0.1$ Jy, but host galaxies with $K_s({AB})\gtrsim23$ mag. The molecular gas associated with the radio galaxy host has two kinematically separate components, likely in-falling and indicative of a recent interaction or merger with another galaxy. One 100-GHz continuum source $\sim120$ pkpc away is found to have both CO(4-3) and [CI](1-0) emission lines and a further five protocluster members are identified from CO(4-3) emission alone, all at similar redshift ($\Delta v<700$ km s$^{-1}$) and within a radius of $1.1^{\prime}$. Using photometry from the High Acuity Widefield K-band Imager $K_s$-band and the Dark Energy Survey $g, r, i, z$ and $Y$ bands, we find this protocluster harbours a rare, optically-dark, very massive $M_*\sim10^{12}$ ${M}_\odot$ galaxy. Comparisons with the TNG300 cosmological simulation puts this galaxy in a dark matter halo of $M_{DM}\sim3\times10^{13}$ ${M}_\odot$ which will evolve into a Coma-like DM halo ($M_{DM}\sim10^{15}$ ${M}_\odot$) by the present day.

 - **Abstract**
 Feedback from supernovae and AGN shapes galaxy formation and evolution, yet its impact remains unclear. Galaxy groups offer a crucial probe, as their binding energy is comparable to that available from their central AGN. The XMM-Newton Group AGN Project (X-GAP) is a sample of 49 groups selected in X-ray (ROSAT) and optical (SDSS) bands, providing a benchmark for hydrodynamical simulations. In sight of such a comparison, understanding selection effects is essential. We aim to model the selection function of X-GAP by forward modelling the detection process in the X-ray and optical bands. Using the Uchuu simulation, we build a halo light cone, predict X-ray group properties with a neural network trained on hydro simulations, and assign galaxies matching observed properties. We compare the selected sample to the parent population. Our method provides a sample that matches the observed distribution of X-ray luminosity and velocity dispersion. The 50% completeness is reached at a velocity dispersion of 450 km/s in the X-GAP redshift range. The selection is driven by X-ray flux, with secondary dependence on velocity dispersion and redshift. We estimate a 93% purity level in the X-GAP parent sample. We calibrate the velocity dispersion-halo mass relation. We find a normalisation and slope in agreement with the literature, and an intrinsic scatter of about 0.06 dex. The measured velocity dispersion is accurate within 10% only for rich systems with more than about 20 members, while the velocity dispersion for groups with less than 10 members is biased at more than 20%. The X-ray follow-up refines the optical selection, enhancing purity but reducing completeness. In an SDSS-like setup, velocity dispersion measurement errors dominate over intrinsic scatter. Our selection model will enable the comparisons of thermodynamic properties and gas fractions between X-GAP groups and hydro simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 The central supermassive black hole (SMBH) of the Andromeda galaxy, known as M31*, exhibits dim electromagnetic emission and is inferred to have an extremely low accretion rate for its remarkable mass ($\sim10^8~\rm~M_\odot$). In this work, we use three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations to explore a previously untested scenario, in which M31* is fed by the collective stellar mass-loss from its surrounding nuclear star cluster, manifested as a famous eccentric disk of predominantly old stellar populations. The stellar mass-loss is assumed to be dominated by the slow and cold winds from 100 asymptotic giant-branch stars, which follow well-constrained Keplerian orbits around M31* and together provide a mass injection rate of $\sim4\times10^{-5}\rm~M_\odot~yr^{-1}$. The simulations achieve a quasi-steady state on a Myr timescale, at which point a quasi-Keplerian, cool ($T\sim10^3-10^4~\rm K$) gas disk extending several parsecs is established. This disk is continuously supplied by the stellar winds and itself feeds the central SMBH. At the end of the simulations at 2 Myr, an accretion rate of $\sim2\times10^{-5}\rm~M_\odot~yr^{-1}$ is found but could vary by a factor of few depending on whether the subdominant gravity of the NSC or a moderate global inflow is included. The predicted X-ray luminosity of $\sim10^{36}~\rm erg~s^{-1}$, dominated by the hot ($T\sim10^7-10^8~\rm K$) plasma within 0.2 parsec of the SMBH, is well consistent with Chandra observations. We conclude that the feeding mechanism of M31* is successfully identified, which has important implications for the working of dormant SMBHs prevalent in the local universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Reactions involving atomic carbon in its ground electronic state, C(3P), play an important role in astrochemistry due to high C-atom abundance levels. Here we performed a kinetic investigation of the reaction between C(3P) and acetaldehyde, CH3CHO, determining rate constants for this process over the 50-296 K range. Measurements of the formation of atomic hydrogen, H(2S), were also performed to provide insight into product formation. Experiments were conducted using a supersonic flow reactor coupled with pulsed laser photolysis for C-atom generation and pulsed laser induced fluorescence in the vacuum ultraviolet range for the detection of both C(3P) and H(2S) atoms. Quantum chemical calculations of the ground triplet state potential energy surface of C3H4O were also performed to provide theoretical support for the measurements. The rate constants were large and temperature independent with an average value of 4.0 x 10-10 cm3 s-1. This result is consistent with the theoretical results which predict either very low barriers or none at all on the underlying potential energy surface. Although experimental difficulties prevented the quantitative determination of H-atom formation, qualitatively, H-atom yields were very low with CH3CH/C2H4 + CO as the major products based on the calculations. The influence of this reaction on interstellar chemistry was tested using a gas-grain model of dense interstellar clouds. These simulations predict that the C(3P) + CH3CHO reaction decreases gas-phase CH3CHO abundances by more than an order of magnitude at early and intermediate cloud ages, with a lower influence at typical dense cloud ages.

 - **Abstract**
 Coronal dimmings are regions of transiently reduced brightness in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and soft X-ray (SXR) emissions associated with coronal mass ejections (CMEs), providing key insights into CME initiation and early evolution. During May 2024, AR 13664 was among the most flare-productive regions in recent decades, generating 55 M-class and 12 X-class flares along with multiple Earth-directed CMEs. The rapid succession of these CMEs triggered the most intense geomagnetic storm in two decades. We study coronal dimmings from a single active region (AR 13664) and compare them with statistical dimming properties. We investigate how coronal dimming parameters - such as area, brightness, and magnetic flux - relate to key flare and CME properties. We systematically identified all flares above M1.0, all coronal dimmings and all CMEs (from the CDAW SOHO/LASCO catalogue) produced by AR 13664 during 2024 May 1 - 15, and studied the associations between the different phenomena and their characteristic parameters. We detect coronal dimmings in 22 events, with 16 occurring on-disc and six off-limb. Approximately 83% of X-class flares and 23% of M-class flares are associated with CMEs, with 13 out of 16 on-disc dimmings linked to CME activity. Our results support the strong interplay between coronal dimmings and flares, as we find increased correlations between flare and dimming parameters in this single-AR study compared to the general dimming population. Furthermore, we confirm that coronagraphic observations, unable to observe the lower corona, underestimate correlations between CME velocities and dimming parameters, as they fail to capture the early CME acceleration phase. This highlights the critical role of dimming observations in providing a more comprehensive understanding of CME dynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are enigmatic extragalactic radio transients with unknown origins. We performed comprehensive Monte Carlo simulations based on the first CHIME/FRB catalog to test whether the FRB population tracks the cosmic star formation history directly or requires a delay. By fully considering CHIME's complex selection effects and beam response, we find that the hypothesis that the FRB population tracks the SFH is not ruled out by the current data, although a small delay is preferred. This is consistent with the scenario in which young magnetars formed through core-collapse supernovae serve as the progenitors of FRBs. However, we estimate the local volumetric rate of FRB sources with energy above $10^{38}$ erg to be $2.3^{+2.4}_{-1.2} \times 10^5~\rm{Gpc}^{-3}~\rm{yr}^{-1}$, which is consistent with previous results. This high volumetric rate means the core-collapse magnetar scenario alone cannot fully account for the observed population. Further theoretical efforts are required to explore alternative or additional progenitor channels for FRBs.

 - **Abstract**
 Binary systems in the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) phase are widely recognized as a leading theoretical framework underpinning the observed asymmetric morphologies of planetary nebulae. However, the detection of binary companions in AGB systems is severely hampered by the overwhelming brightness and variability of the evolved primary star, which dominate the photo-metric and spectroscopic signatures. Ultraviolet (UV) excess emission has been proposed as a candidate diagnostic for the presence of binary companions in AGB systems. This paper evaluates the Chinese Space Station Telescope's (CSST) ability to detect UV excess emission in AGB stars, leveraging its unprecedented UV sensitivity and wide-field survey capabilities. We employed synthetic spectral libraries of M0-M8 type giants for primary stars and the ATLAS 9 atmospheric model grid for companion stars spanning a temperature range of 6500 K to 12000 K. By convolving these model spectra with the CSST multi-band filter system, we computed color-color diagrams (g-y versus NUV-u) to construct a diagnostic grid. This grid incorporates interstellar extinction corrections and establishes a framework for identifying AGB binary candidates through direct comparison between observed photometry and theoretical predictions. Furthermore, we discuss the physical origins of UV excess in AGB stars. This study pioneers a diagnostic framework leveraging CSST's unique multi-band UV-visible synergy to construct color-color grids for binary candidate identification, overcoming limitations of non-simultaneous multi-instrument observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Multiple clumpy wind components ($v_{out}\sim0.2-0.3c$) in the luminous quasar PDS 456 have recently been resolved by XRISM in the Fe-K band for the first time. In this paper, we investigate the structure of ultra-fast outflows (UFOs) using coordinated observations from XRISM, XMM-Newton, and NuSTAR, along with the self-consistently calculated photoionization model \texttt{PION}. Our results reveal a stratified ionization structure likely driven by the radiation field, characterized by a relation between wind velocity and ionization parameter $v_{out}\propto\xi^{(0.38\pm0.06)}$. To evaluate the impact of the screening effect, we tested all possible order permutations of six \texttt{PION} components. We find that highly ionized UFOs ($\log\xi>4.5$) are insensitive to their relative positions, whereas the soft X-ray UFO ($\log\xi\sim3$ and $v_{out}\sim0.27c$) and the lowest-ionized hard X-ray UFO ($\log\xi\sim4.1$ and $v_ {out}\sim0.23c$) are statistically favored -- based on the evidence from both the C-statistic and Bayesian analysis -- to occupy the middle and innermost layers, respectively. This suggests a possible trend where slower UFOs are launched from regions closer to the supermassive black hole (SMBH). The soft X-ray UFO is found to be thermally unstable, regardless of its relative position. However, its location remains unclear. Our sequence analysis and its similarity to hard X-ray UFOs suggest that they may be co-spatial, while variability constraints support its location within the broad-line region at sub-parsec scales. Simulations with the gate-valve opened XRISM show that high-resolution soft X-ray data can enhance the reliability of our results. Furthermore, simulations with the future X-ray mission NewAthena demonstrate its capability to resolve the absorber sequence and spatial distributions, enabling the determination of UFO structures and their roles in AGN feedback.
