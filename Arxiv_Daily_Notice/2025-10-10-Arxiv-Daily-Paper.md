 - **Abstract**
 We present a large spectroscopic survey with \textit{JWST}'s Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) Low Resolution Spectrometer (LRS) targeting $37$ infrared-bright galaxies between $z=0.65-2.46$ with infrared luminosities $\log L_{\rm IR}/L_\odot>11.5$ and $\log M_*/M_\odot=10-11.5$. Targets were taken from a \textit{Spitzer} $24\,\mu$m-selected sample with archival spectroscopy from the Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) and include a mix of star-forming galaxies and dust-obscured AGN. By combining IRS with the increased sensitivity of LRS, we expand the range of spectral features observed between $5-30\,\mu$m for every galaxy in our sample. In this paper, we outline the sample selection, \textit{JWST} data reduction, 1D spectral extraction, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) feature measurements from $\lambda_{rest}=3.3-11.2\,\mu$m. In the \textit{JWST} spectra, we detect PAH emission features at $3.3-5.3\,\mu$m, as well as Paschen and Brackett lines. The $3.3\,\mu$m feature can be as bright as $1\%$ of the $8-1000\,\mu$m infrared luminosity and exhibits a tight correlation with the dust-obscured star-formation rate. We detect absorption features from CO gas, CO$_2$ ice, H$_2$O ice, and aliphatic dust. From the joint \textit{JWST} and \textit{Spitzer} analysis we find that the $11.3/3.3\,\mu$m PAH ratios are on-average three times higher than that of local luminous, infrared galaxies. This is interpreted as evidence that the PAH grains are larger at $z\sim1-2$. The size distribution may be affected by coagulation of grains due to high gas densities and low temperatures. These conditions are supported by the observation of strong water ice absorption at $3.05\,\mu$m, and can lower stellar radiative feedback as large PAHs transmit less energy per photon into the interstellar medium.

 - **Abstract**
 Major mergers of galaxies are likely to trigger bursty star formation activities. The accumulation of dense gas and the boost of star formation efficiency (SFE) are considered to be the two main drivers of the starbursts. However, it is still unclear how each process operates on the scale of individual star-forming clouds. Here, we present a high-resolution (2 Msun) RHD simulation of a gas-rich dwarf galaxy merger using the RIGEL model to investigate how mergers affect the properties of the structure of dense star-forming gas and the cloud-scale SFE. We track the evolution of sub-virial dense clouds in the simulation by mapping them across successive snapshots taken at intervals of 0.2 Myr. We found that the merger triggers a 130 times higher SFR and shortens the galaxy-wide gas-depletion time by two orders of magnitude compared to those of two isolated galaxies. However, the depletion time of individual clouds and their lifetime distribution remained unchanged over the simulation period. The cloud life cycles and cloud-scale SFE are determined by the local stellar feedback rather than environmental factors regardless of the merger process, and the integrated SFE ($\epsilon_{\rm int}$) of clouds in complex environments is still well described by an $\epsilon_{\rm int}-\Sigma_{\rm tot}$ relation found in idealized isolated-cloud experiments. During the peak of the starburst, the median integrated SFE only changed by 0.17-0.33 dex lower compared to the value when the galaxies are not interacting. The merger boosts the SFR primarily through the accumulation and compression of dense gas fueling star formation. Strong tidal torques assemble $>10^ 5$ Msun clouds that seed massive star clusters. The average separation between star-forming clouds decreases during the merger, which in turn decreases the cloud--cluster spatial decorrelation from >1 kpc to 0.1 kpc depicted by tuning fork diagrams.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first systematic analysis of photometric redshifts (photo-z) estimated from the Rubin Observatory Data Preview 1 (DP1) data taken with the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) Commissioning Camera. Employing the Redshift Assessment Infrastructure Layers (RAIL) framework, we apply eight photo-z algorithms to the DP1 photometry, using deep ugrizy coverage in the Extended Chandra Deep Field South (ECDFS) field and griz data in the Rubin_SV_38_7 field. In the ECDFS field, we construct a reference catalog from spectroscopic redshift (spec-z), grism redshift (grism-z), and multiband photo-z for training and validating photo-z. Performance metrics of the photo-z are evaluated using spec-zs from ECDFS and Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 1 samples. Across the algorithms, we achieve per-galaxy photo-z scatter of $\sigma_{\rm NMAD} \sim 0.03$ and outlier fractions around 10% in the 6-band data, with performance degrading at faint magnitudes and z>1.2. The overall bias and scatter of our machine-learning based photo-zs satisfy the LSST Y1 requirement. We also use our photo-z to infer the ensemble redshift distribution n(z). We study the photo-z improvement by including near-infrared photometry from the Euclid mission, and find that Euclid photometry improves photo-z at z>1.2. Our results validate the RAIL pipeline for Rubin photo-z production and demonstrate promising initial performance.

 - **Abstract**
 JWST has identified a large population of faint, broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the early universe that are powered by black holes (BHs) that often appear overmassive relative to their host galaxies. In this study, we examine the relationship between BH mass and galaxy stellar mass at $3<z<7$ using a sample of 70 broad-line AGN identified using NIRSpec/G395M spectroscopy from the CEERS, JADES, and RUBIES surveys. Roughly half (43\%) of our sample appear heavily reddened and are classified as little red dots (LRDs). We estimate BH masses ($M_{\rm BH}$) using single-epoch virial techniques, while host stellar masses ($M_{\star}$) are inferred using a combination of two-dimensional surface brightness profile fitting and spectral energy distribution modeling. We find that a majority of our sources (50/70) have $M_{\rm BH}/M_{\star}$ ratios that are 1-2 dex higher than that observed in AGN locally. Using a forward-modeling Bayesian framework that accounts for uncertainties, intrinsic scatter, and selection effects, we infer a $M_{\rm BH}-M_{\star}$ relationship that is $>3\sigma$ above the relationship measured for local broad-line AGN. We derive an intrinsic scatter in this relationship of $0.9$ dex, which does not vary over the redshift range of our sample. We also find that the $M_{\rm BH}/M_{\star}$ ratio increases by $2.3$ dex from $z = 3.5$ and $z = 6.5$ with a confidence level of $ > 3\sigma$. We attribute this trend with the increasing fraction of LRDs in our sample at $z>4$ as their host masses are $\sim1$ dex lower than the non-LRD AGN in our sample. These results support a picture in which the BHs powering JWST's broad-line AGN are genuinely overmassive and become increasingly so with redshift. We discuss the implications of our findings on early BH growth relative to that of their host galaxies and the constraints it places on BH seeding models.

 - **Abstract**
 Structure on sub-galactic scales provides important tests of galaxy formation models and the nature of dark matter. However, such objects are typically too faint to provide robust mass constraints. Here, we report the discovery of an extremely low-mass object detected via its gravitational perturbation to a thin lensed arc observed with milli-arcsecond-resolution very long baseline interferometry (VLBI). The object was identified using a non-parametric gravitational imaging technique and confirmed using independent parametric modelling. It contains a mass of $m_{\rm 80}=(1.13 \pm 0.04)\times 10^6{M_\odot}$ within a projected radius of 80 parsecs at an assumed redshift of 0.881. This detection is extremely robust and precise, with a statistical significance of 26$\sigma$, a 3.3 per cent fractional uncertainty on $m_{\rm 80}$, and an astrometric uncertainty of 194 $\mu$as. This is the lowest-mass object known to us, by two orders of magnitude, to be detected at a cosmological distance by its gravitational effect. This work demonstrates the observational feasibility of using gravitational imaging to probe the million-solar-mass regime far beyond our local Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Turbulence in the interstellar medium (ISM) plays an important role in many physical processes, including forming stars and shaping complex ISM structures. In this work, we investigate the HI turbulent properties of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) to reveal what physical mechanisms drive the turbulence and at what scales. Using the high-resolution HI data of the Galactic ASKAP (GASKAP) survey and multi-point structure functions (SF), we perform a statistical analysis of HI turbulence in 34 subregions of the SMC. Two-point SFs tend to show a linear trend, and their slope values are relatively uniform across the SMC, suggesting that large-scale structures exist and are dominant in the two-point SFs. On the other hand, seven-point SF enables us to probe small-scale turbulence by removing large-scale fluctuations, which is difficult to achieve with the two-point SFs. In the seven-point SFs, we find break features at scales of 34-84 pc, with a median scale of $\sim$50 pc. This result indicates the presence of small-scale turbulent fluctuations in the SMC and quantifies its scale. In addition, we find strong correlations between slope values of the seven-point SFs and the stellar feedback-related quantities (e.g., H$\alpha$ intensities, the number of young stellar objects, and the number of HI shells), suggesting that stellar feedback may affect the small-scale turbulent properties of the HI gas in the SMC. Lastly, estimated sonic Mach numbers across the SMC are subsonic, which is consistent with the fact that the HI gas of the SMC primarily consists of the warm neutral medium.

 - **Abstract**
 Molecular clouds are active sites of star formation in galaxies, and their formation and evolution are largely affected by stellar feedback. This includes outflows and winds from newly formed stars, radiation from young clusters, and supernova explosions. High-resolution molecular line observations allow for the identification of individual star-forming regions and the study of their integrated properties. Moreover, simulations are now capable of accurately replicating the evolution of MCs including all key stellar feedback processes. We present 13CO(2-1) synthetic observations of the STARFORGE simulations produced using the radiative transfer code RADMC-3D, matching the observational setup of the SEDIGISM survey. From these, we identified the population of MCs using hierarchical clustering and analysed them to provide insights into the interpretation of observed MCs as they evolve. The flux distributions of the post-processed synthetic observations and the properties of the MCs, namely radius, mass, velocity dispersion, virial parameter and surface density, are consistent with those of SEDIGISM. Both samples of MCs occupy the same regions in the scaling relation plots; however, the average distributions of MCs at different evolutionary stages do not overlap on the plots. This highlights the reliability of our approach in modelling SEDIGISM and suggests that MCs at different evolutionary stages contribute to the scatter in observed scaling relations. We study the trends in MC properties over time to analyse their physical structure as they evolve. MCs appear as small, diffuse cloudlets in early stages, followed by their evolution to filamentary structures, before being shaped by stellar feedback into 3D bubbles and getting dispersed. These trends in the observable properties of MCs provide strong evidence that clouds exhibit distinct morphologies over the course of their evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Analyses of IFU data are typically performed on a per-spaxel basis, with each spectrum modelled independently. For low signal-to-noise (S/N) features such as weak emission lines, estimating properties is difficult and imprecise. Arbitrary binning schemes boost S/N at the cost of resolution, and risk introducing biases. We present a general forward-modelling approach that assumes spectra close on the sky are more similar than distant ones, and so can be modelled jointly. These "spectrospatial" models exploit spatial correlation to provide robust inferences, while simultaneously providing continuous predictions of line properties like strength and kinematics across the sky. Instrumental and calibration systematics are straightforward to include and infer. The model provides a natural trade-off between spatial resolution and S/N in a data-driven way. We apply this to Sloan Digital Sky Survey V (SDSS-V) Local Volume Mapper (LVM) data of the Rosette Nebula, producing continuous maps of fluxes and kinematics for Balmer, nebular, and auroral lines, as well as weak C II and N II recombination lines, demonstrating the approach across three orders of magnitude in S/N, including in the very low-S/N regime. The method recovers identical morphologies across different lines tracing similar ionisation volumes, at varying resolutions set by the S/N. We additionally provide a general framework for building and fitting such models in JAX, suitable for many applications. The implementation is fast and memory efficient, scales to large data volumes as in LVM, and can be deployed on hardware accelerators.
#### Enhanced Pebble Drift Across Planet-Opened Gaps in Windy Protoplanetary Disks

 - **Abstract**
 When a giant planet forms in a protoplanetary disks, it carves a gap around its orbit separating the disk into two parts: inner disk and outer disk. Traditional disk accretion models, which assume material transport is driven by viscosity, reveal that the planet-induced gap acts like a filter which blocks large dust grains from flowing into the inner disk. However, there is growing evidence that material transport may be driven by magnetically-driven winds instead. By carrying out a suite of two-dimensional multi-fluid hydrodynamic simulations where wind is implemented with a parameterized model, we explored how dust filtration efficiency and the size of dust grains filtered change in disks where gas accretion is dominated by magnetically-driven winds. We found that the inward gas flow driven by the wind can enable dust to overcome the pressure bump at the outer gap edge and penetrate the planet-induced gap. The maximum size of dust grains capable of penetrating the gap increasing with the wind strength. Notably, we found that when wind is strong (mass loss rate = 1e-7 M_sun/yr), mm-sized grains can penetrate the gap opened by a multi-Jovian-mass planet. Our results suggest that magnetically driven winds can significantly enhance pebble drift and impact planet formation in the inner protoplanetary disk.

 - **Abstract**
 Close to Earth the solar wind is usually super-Alfvénic, i.e. the speed of the solar wind is much larger than the Alfvén speed. However, in the lower coronal regions, the solar wind is mostly sub-Alfvénic. With the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) crossing the boundary between the sub- and super-Alfvénic flow, Bandyopadhyay et al. (2022) performed a turbulence characterization of the sub-Alfvénic solar wind with initial data from encounters 8 and 9. In this study, we re-examine the turbulence properties such as turbulence amplitude, anisotropy of the magnetic field variance, intermittency and switchback strength extending with PSP data for encounters 8-19. The later orbits probe lower altitudes and experience sub-Alfvénic conditions more frequently providing a greater statistical coverage to contrast sub- and super-Alfvénic solar wind. Also, by isolating the intervals where the solar wind speed is approximately equal to the Alfvén speed, we explore the transition in more detail. We show that the amplitude of the normalized magnetic field fluctuation is smaller for the sub-Alfvénic samples. While solar wind turbulence in general is shown to be anisotropic, the sub-Alfvénic samples are more anisotropic than the super-Alfvénic samples, in general. Further, we show that the sub- and super-Alfvénic samples do not show much distinction in terms of intermittency strength. Finally, consistent with prior results, we find no evidence for polarity reversing > 90 degrees switchbacks in the sub-Alfvénic solar wind
#### Evidence for Supermassive Black Hole Binaries

 - **Abstract**
 We review the state of the evidence for the existence and observational appearance of supermassive black hole binaries. Such objects are expected from standard hierarchical galaxy evolution to form after two galaxies, each containing a supermassive black hole, have merged, in the centre of the merger remnant. A complex interaction is predicted to take place with stars and gas in the host galaxy, leading to observable signatures in weakly as well as actively accreting phases. Direct observational evidence is available and shows examples of dual active galactic nuclei from kpc scales down to parsec scales. Signatures of possibly closer supermassive black hole binaries may be seen in jetted black holes. The interaction with stars and gas in a galaxy significantly affects the hardening of the binary and hence contributes to uncertainties of the expected gravitational wave signal. The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) should in the future detect actual mergers. Before the launch of LISA, pulsar timing arrays may have the best chance to detect a gravitational wave signal from supermassive black hole binaries. The first signs of the combined background of inspiralling objects might have been seen already.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an automated and probabilistic method to make prediscovery detections of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) in archival survey images, with the goal of reducing orbital uncertainty immediately after discovery. We refit Minor Planet Center astrometry and propagate the full six-parameter covariance to survey epochs to define search regions. We build low-threshold source catalogs for viable images and evaluate every detected source in a search region as a candidate prediscovery. We eliminate false positives by refitting a new orbit to each candidate and probabilistically linking detections across images using a likelihood ratio. Applied to Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) imaging, we identify approximately 3000 recently discovered NEAs with prediscovery potential, including a doubling of the observational arc for about 500. We use archival ZTF imaging to make prediscovery detections of the potentially hazardous asteroid 2021 DG1, extending its arc by 2.5 years and reducing future apparition sky-plane uncertainty from many degrees to arcseconds. We also recover 2025 FU24 nearly 7 years before its first known observation, when its sky-plane uncertainty covers hundreds of square degrees across thousands of ZTF images. The method is survey-agnostic and scalable, enabling rapid orbit refinement for new discoveries from Rubin, NEO Surveyor, and NEOMIR.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Rotational CO transitions, while acting as a foreground for [C II] line-intensity mapping (LIM) experiments, trace the physical conditions of cold gas in galaxies at lower redshifts. Studying these transitions is also crucial for improving component-separation methods as LIM sensitivity increases. Aims: Galaxy-evolution models have so far predicted only the total CO LIM signal. We explore the potential of cross-correlating millimeter-wave LIM data with spectroscopic galaxy surveys to constrain individual CO-line contributions, measure the CO-background spectral line energy distribution (SLED), and derive the cosmic molecular gas density, $\rho_{\mathrm{H2}}(z)$, up to $z = 3$. Methods: We built 12 light cones of $9~\mathrm{deg}^2$ from the Simulated Infrared Extragalactic Sky (SIDES) simulation. By analyzing cross-power spectra between different CO transitions and the galaxy density field, we recovered the CO background SLED. Combining it with bias-weighted line intensities yielded $\rho_{\mathrm{H2}}(z)$. We also assessed the detectability of the CO(4--3) cross-power spectrum with a CONCERTO-like experiment. Results: For a realistic spectroscopic depth, the CO background SLED is accurately recovered up to $J_{\mathrm{up}} = 6$ with $\leq 20%$ uncertainties. Reconstructing $\rho_{\mathrm{H2}}$ from millimeter LIM data requires an excitation correction relative to CO(1--0). Interloper-induced variance does not prevent precise $\rho_{\mathrm{H2}}$ estimation. In the two-star-formation-mode SIDES model, starbursts dominate the SLED at $J_{\mathrm{up}} \geq 6$ but do not bias $\rho_{\mathrm{H2}}$ estimates from $2 \leq J_{\mathrm{up}} \leq 6$. However, CONCERTO lacks the sensitivity to detect the CO$\times$galaxy cross-power on relevant scales, even under ideal conditions.

 - **Abstract**
 X-ray binary accretion disk winds can carry away a significant fraction of the originally infalling matter and hence strongly affect the accretion flow and the long-term evolution of the binary system. However, accurate measurements of their mass outflow rates are challenging due to uncertainties in our understanding of the 3D wind structure. Most studies employ absorption line spectroscopy that only gives us a single sightline through the wind streamlines. Hercules X-1 is a peculiar X-ray binary which allows us to avoid this issue, as its warped, precessing accretion disk naturally presents a range of sightlines through the vertical structure of its disk wind. Here we present the first results from a large, coordinated campaign on Her X-1 led by the new XRISM observatory and supported by XMM-Newton, NuSTAR and Chandra. We perform a time-resolved analysis and constrain the properties of the wind vertical structure. Thanks to the precision spectroscopy of XRISM/Resolve, we directly detect the Her X-1 orbital motion in the evolution of the outflow velocity. After correcting for this effect, we observe an increase in velocity from 250 km/s to 600 km/s as the wind rises to greater heights above the disk. The wind column density decreases with height, as expected, but its ionization parameter only evolves weakly, and is consistent with freezing out as the wind expands away. Additionally, we detect a new orbital dependence of the wind properties, revealing a likely second wind component that appears only briefly after the eclipse of Her X-1 by the secondary star.

 - **Abstract**
 Supernova H0pe is a multiply-imaged Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) and the second lensed SN to yield a measurement of the Hubble constant by the time-delay cosmography method, finding $H_0 = 75.4^{+8.1}_{-5.5} \text{km s}^{-1} \text{Mpc}^{-1}$. We investigate the seven lens modeling approaches used to derive $H_0$, assessing their agreement with $\Lambda \text{CDM}$ constraints from SN Ia surveys through a purely observational comparison. While photometrically derived magnifications yield distance moduli in line with $\Lambda \text{CDM}$ expectations, our comparison reveals that lens model predictions, even the most precise ones, consistently overestimate the magnification, with a offset of $ \Delta \mu > 1$ mag. This known bias, already appreciated by modeling teams, is independently confirmed through our analysis and highlights the value of lensed SNe as a tool to test model accuracy. If unaccounted for, such magnification biases can propagate into uncertainties in derived cosmological parameters, including $H_0$, and affect the interpretation of future precision measurements. These findings highlight a critical challenge for precision cosmology using strongly lensed transients. With next-generation surveys such as LSST, Roman, and Euclid poised to discover many more gravitationally lensed supernovae, the development and validation of robust, accurate lens models will be essential for using these rare events to probe cosmology.

 - **Abstract**
 The peculiar velocities of supernovae and their host galaxies are correlated with the large-scale structure of the Universe, and can be used to constrain the growth rate of structure and test the cosmological model. In this work, we measure the correlation statistics of the large-scale structure traced by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Bright Galaxy Survey Data Release 1 sample, and magnitude fluctuations of type Ia supernova from the Pantheon+ compilation across redshifts z < 0.1. We find a detection of the cross-correlation signal between galaxies and type Ia supernova magnitudes. Fitting the normalised growth rate of structure f sigma_8 to the auto- and cross-correlation function measurements we find f sigma_8 = 0.384 +0.094 -0.157, which is consistent with the Planck LambdaCDM model prediction, and indicates that the supernova magnitude fluctuations are induced by peculiar velocities. Using a large ensemble of N-body simulations, we validate our methodology, calibrate the covariance of the measurements, and demonstrate that our results are insensitive to supernova selection effects. We highlight the potential of this methodology for measuring the growth rate of structure, and forecast that the next generation of type Ia supernova surveys will improve f sigma_8 constraints by a further order of magnitude.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a multi-modal foundation model for astrophysical galaxy data, designed to map between simulation- and observation-based galactic features. Our encoder-only transformer flexibly ingests scalar quantities (e.g., redshifts, galaxy masses) and vectors (e.g., star formation histories, spectra), supporting multi-task training that includes within-modality reconstruction and cross-modality prediction. With a dynamic masking strategy, the model can query arbitrary galaxy properties from partial inputs -- including predicting spectra from redshift and mass, or estimating photometric redshifts from broadband magnitudes -- while also recovering missing segments within a modality. Trained on 185,000 simulated galaxies from a gigaparsec-scale Cosmology simulation, the model yields a 50% improvement in redshift estimation when combining LSST and SPHEREx photometry over LSST photometry alone, and a 63% improvement in stellar mass inference when combining late-time SFH with LSST photometry over early-time SFH with LSST photometry. The model demonstrates strong generalization across multi-modal tasks and lays the groundwork for future integration of higher-dimensional and structured data such as images, merger trees, and 3D fields. This approach provides a unified framework for connecting simulations and observations, advancing the development of generalizable astrophysical foundation models.

 - **Abstract**
 Pulse-profile modeling (PPM) of thermal X-ray emission from rotation-powered millisecond pulsars enables simultaneous constraints on the mass $M$, radius $R$, and hence the equation of state of cold, dense matter. However, Bayesian PPM has faced a hard accuracy-speed bottleneck: current production resolutions used to keep inference tractable can under-resolve extreme hotspot geometries and bias the waveform computation, whereas the higher resolutions that remove this bias push forward models to minutes per evaluation, making inference impractical. We break this trade-off with, to our knowledge, the first public GPU-accelerated X-ray PPM framework that matches established benchmarks to within $\sim10^{-3}$ relative accuracy even for extreme geometries, while collapsing minutes-long high-fidelity computations to $2$--$5$ ms on an RTX 4080 ($10^{3}$--$10^{4}\times$ speedups), enabling posterior exploration at resolutions and complexities previously out of reach. We further uncover a bias near the interpolation boundaries of atmosphere lookup tables, demonstrate it with two diagnostic tests, and counter it with a mixed-order interpolator. Together, these advances enlarge the feasible hotspot model space and reduce key systematics in PPM, strengthening inferences for current and future X-ray missions.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations have revealed a remarkably rapid buildup of cosmic dust in the interstellar medium (ISM) of high redshift galaxies, with complex dust compositions and large abundances already appearing at redshifts $z>6$. Here we present a comprehensive, joint analysis of observations taken with the {\em James Webb Space Telescope} (JWST) and the Atacama Large Millimetre/sub-millimetre Array (ALMA) of the highly magnified, dusty `normal' galaxy, A1689-zD1 at $z=7.13$. We perform detailed spectro-photometric modeling of the rest-frame UV to far-infrared spectral energy distribution (SED) based on archival photometry of the source and report new rest-frame optical strong-line measurements and metallicity estimates from recent JWST/NIRSpec IFU data. We find that despite its substantial dust mass, $M_{\rm dust}\sim 1.5\times 10^{7}\,M_\odot$, A1689-zD1 has remarkably low dust-to-gas and dust-to-metal mass ratios, ${\rm DTG} = (5.1^{+3.0}_{-1.9})\times 10^{-4}$ and ${\rm DTM} = (6.1^{+3.6}_{-2.3})\times 10^{-2}$, respectively, due to its high metallicity $12+\log({\rm O/H}) = 8.36\pm 0.10$ and substantial gas mass, $M_{\rm gas} = (2.8^{+0.2}_{-1.7})\times 10^{10}\,M_\odot$. The DTG and DTM mass ratios are an order of magnitude lower than expected for galaxies in the local universe with similar chemical enrichment. These low relative measurements are also corroborated by the deficit observed in the $A_V/N_{\rm HI}$ ratio of A1689-zD1 in the line-of-sight. We find that this deviation in the DTG and DTM mass ratios appears to be ubiquitous in other metal-rich galaxies at similar redshifts, $z\gtrsim 6$. This suggests that the processes that form and destroy dust at later times, or the dust emissivity itself, are drastically different for galaxies in the early Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 The disks of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) provide a natural environment where stellar-mass black holes (BHs) can dynamically pair, undergo repeated interactions, and eventually merge. It is commonly assumed that gas accretion will both efficiently spin up disk-embedded black holes and align the orbits of embedded binaries with the disk plane, leading to mergers with preferentially positive effective spin parameters ($\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$). Such predictions have motivated the use of $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$ as a diagnostic for identifying candidate AGN-embedded mergers in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA gravitational-wave catalog. In this work, we perform post-Newtonian $N$-body simulations of nearly planar binary-single encounters and apply an empirically motivated, gas-driven alignment prescription to characterize the expected $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$-eccentricity correlations of AGN-embedded mergers. By comparing the alignment and gravitational-wave inspiral timescales, we identify the regions of parameter space, across both disk location and binary properties, where full disk-spin-orbit alignment is effective and where it is not. We find that quasi-circular binaries typically align by the time they merge, supporting the standard picture of spin-orbit aligned orientations. By contrast, eccentric binaries (with in-band eccentricity $e_{10\mathrm{Hz}}\gtrsim 0.1$) typically inspiral too quickly for gas torques to act, preserving the post-encounter spin-orbit misalignments and yielding more isotropic $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$ distributions when disk densities and torque efficiencies are modest. This interplay naturally establishes a correlation between binary eccentricity and $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$ in AGN disks, highlighting a new key observable of the AGN channel and a potential explanation for massive events such as GW190521 and GW231123.

 - **Abstract**
 We present ALMA CO observations of 14 HI-detected galaxies from the CHILES survey found in a cosmic over-density at z~0.12. This is the largest collection of spatially resolved CO + HI observations beyond the local Universe (z>0.05) to date. While the HI-detected parent sample spans a range of stellar masses, star formation rates (SFR), and environments, we only directly detect CO in the highest stellar mass galaxies, log(M_*/M_Sun)>10.0, with SFRs greater than ~2 M_Sun/yr. The detected CO has the kinematic signature of a rotating disk, consistent with the HI. We stack the CO non-detections and find a mean H_2 mass of log(M_H2/M_Sun) = 8.46 in galaxies with a mean stellar mass of log(M_*/M_Sun) = 9.35. In addition to high stellar masses and SFRs, the systems detected in CO are spatially larger, have redder overall colors, and exhibit broader (stacked) line widths. The CO emission is spatially coincident with both the highest stellar mass surface density and star forming region of the galaxies, as revealed by the 1.4 GHz continuum emission. We interpret the redder colors as the molecular gas being coincident with dusty regions of obscured star formation. The 14 HI detections show a range of morphologies, but the HI reservoir is always more extended than the CO. Finally, we compare with samples in the literature and find mild evidence for evolution in the molecular gas reservoir and H_2-to-HI gas ratio with redshift in HI flux-limited samples. We show that the scatter in the HI, and HI-to-stellar mass ratio is too great to conclusively measure evolution below z=0.2, and is even extremely difficult below z=0.4. Detections from CHILES are likely to be the only individual galaxies detected in HI between 0.1<z<0.23 for the foreseeable future due to the severity of satellite radio frequency interference, and its preferential impact on short baselines which dominate contemporary HI surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 The equatorial jets dominating the dynamics of the Jovian planets exhibit two distinct types of zonal flows: strongly eastward in the gas giants (superrotation) and strongly westward in the ice giants (subrotation). Existing theories propose different mechanisms for these patterns, but no single mechanism has successfully explained both. However, the planetary parameters of the four Solar System giant planets suggest that a fundamentally different mechanism is unlikely. In this study, we show that convection-driven columnar structures can account for both eastward and westward equatorial jets, framing the phenomenon as a bifurcation. Consequently, both superrotation and subrotation emerge as stable branches of the same mechanistic solution. Our analysis of these solutions uncovers similarities in the properties of equatorial waves and the leading-order momentum balance. This study suggests that the fundamental dynamics governing equatorial jet formation may be more broadly applicable across the Jovian planets than previously believed, offering a unified explanation for their two distinct zonal wind patterns.

 - **Abstract**
 Astrophysical processes can contribute to magnetic fields within cosmic voids either through magnetized outflows from the astrophysical large-scale structure or through superposition of dipolar contributions from individual galaxies. Such astrophysical magnetic fields represent a foreground to possible space-filling primordial magnetic fields seeded in the early Universe. In this paper, we provide a qualitative description of the screening of magnetic fields by intergalactic plasmas. We find that contributions from superposition of static dipoles are highly suppressed and cannot explain indications for lower bounds based on observations of $\gamma$-ray cascades from high energy sources such as blazars.

 - **Abstract**
 Two extreme events in the universe, fast radio bursts (FRBs) and cosmic rays (CRs), could be corelated, where FRBs with extreme field strength near their sources may contribute to CRs. This study investigates localized particle acceleration driven by FRB-like ultra-relativistic electromagnetic pulses. It is found ultra-high energy neutral plasma sheets form constantly via the front erosion of an FRB pulse. There are two ion acceleration regimes depending upon the field strength and the plasma density: the wakefield regime dominated by charge separation fields, and the piston regime driven by the $\mathbf{V}\times\mathbf{B}$ force of the pulses. The predicted energy scalings align well with particle-in-cell simulations. A power-law energy spectrum naturally arises with an index close to the CRs during FRB diffusion outward. Joint observations of FRBs and CRs may provide an opportunity to understand these extreme events and advance the development of multi-messenger astronomy.

 - **Abstract**
 Sulfur and its isotopic ratios play a crucial role in understanding astrophysical environments, providing insights into nucleosynthesis, ISM processes, star formation, planetary evolution, and galactic chemistry. We investigate the distribution of sulfur bearing species $\rm{SO_2}$, $\rm{^{34}SO_2}$, SO, and $\rm{^{34}SO}$ towards five oxygen rich Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars ($o$ Ceti, R Dor, W Hya, R Leo, and EP Aqr), along with their excitation temperatures, column densities, and isotopic ratios. Using ALMA Band 6,7,8 data and CASSIS, we detect these species and estimate excitation temperature and column density via the rotational diagram and MCMC methods under LTE. Line imaging of various transitions is used to infer spatial distributions. The excitation temperatures of $\rm{SO_2}$ range from $\sim$200-600 K with column densities of $\rm{1-7\times10^{16}\ cm^{-2}}$, while $\rm{^{34}SO_2}$ shows comparable or slightly lower values and about an order of magnitude lower column densities. The $\rm{^{32}S/^{34}S}$ ratios for R Dor and W Hya are near solar, slightly higher for $o$ Ceti, and lower for EP Aqr and R Leo. Most detected lines exhibit centralized emission: high excitation $\rm{SO_2}$ traces compact hot gas in inner CSEs, whereas low-excitation lines trace more extended structures. Morphological differences, irregular emission in $o$ Ceti, circular in R Leo and W Hya, clumpy in R Dor, and unresolved in EP Aqr may arise from variations in physical conditions, multiplicity, outflows, rotation, desorption processes, UV or cosmic ray effects, or observational resolution. Overall, the centralized SO and $\rm{SO_2}$ emissions support previous findings for low mass-loss rate AGB stars, and the $\rm{^{32}S/^{34}S}$ ratios likely reflect natal cloud composition, with deviations linked to metallicity or excitation conditions.

 - **Abstract**
 Radiative feedback from massive stars plays a central role in the evolution of molecular clouds and the interstellar medium. This paper presents a multi-wavelength analysis of the bright-rimmed cloud, BRC 44, which is located at the periphery of the Hii region Sh2-145 and is excited by the massive stars in the region. We use a combination of archival and newly obtained infrared data, along with new optical observations, to provide a census of young stellar objects (YSOs) in the region and to estimate stellar parameters such as age, mass etc. The spatial distribution of YSOs visible in the optical wavelength suggests that they are distributed in separate clumps compared to the embedded YSOs and are relatively older. Near-Infrared (NIR) spectroscopy of four YSOs in this region using the TANSPEC mounted on the 3.6m Devasthal Optical Telescope (DOT) confirms their youth. From Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) fitting, most of the embedded YSO candidates are in their early stage of evolution, with the majority of them in their Class II and some in Class I stage. The relative proper motions of the YSOs with respect to the ionizing source are indicative of the rocket effect in the BRC. The 12CO, 13CO, and C18O observations with the Purple Mountain Observatory are used to trace the distribution of molecular gas in the region. A comparison of the cold molecular gas distribution with simple analytical model calculations shows that the cloud is in the compression stage, and massive stars may be influencing the formation of young embedded stars in the BRC region due to radiative feedback.

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are one of the main targets for the observations of the MAGIC telescopes. As a result of the effort in improving the sensitivity of the instrument and the automatic follow-up strategy, MAGIC detected two GRBs in the very-high-energy (VHE, $E>100$ GeV) range, namely GRB 190114C and GRB 201216C. In GRB 190114C ($z=0.42$), the data collected by MAGIC revealed a new emission component at sub-TeV energies in the afterglow of the GRB. The very rich multi-wavelength dataset, spanning 17 orders of magnitude in energy, allowed to perform a detailed modelling of the broadband emission. The multi-wavelength data could be modelled within a one-zone synchrotron-self Compton scenario with internal $\gamma-\gamma$ absorption, where the model parameters are compatible with those found in previous GRB afterglow studies below GeV energies. Similarly, GRB 201216C broadband emission could be explained using the same model, although the amount of simultaneous multi-wavelength data is reduced with respect to GRB 190114C. In particular, GRB 201216C challenged the current MAGIC detection potential, as its redshift was determined to be $z=1.1$, strongly reducing the observed gamma-ray flux but making it the most distant source detected at VHE. These two detections, accompanied by evidence of VHE emission from a few more GRBs, opened up new questions such as the presence of sub-TeV emission in different classes and phases of GRBs. In this contribution we will present the status of the MAGIC GRB follow-up program, with an highlight on its detected GRBs. Moreover we will show the results on the GRBs observed by MAGIC from 2013 to 2019 with no evidence of VHE emission, in particular for those with simultaneous X-ray observations and redshift $z<2$. We will discuss the implications of these results for GRB physics and the challenges and prospects for future GRB observations with MAGIC.

 - **Abstract**
 We present high-resolution, phase-resolved spectroscopic observations of the polar EF Eri, obtained with SALT and the SAAO 1.9-m telescope during its recent emergence from a three-decade-long low state. The average spectrum shows strong emission from the Balmer lines (H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$) and He~\textsc{ii} 4686 Å, along with weaker emission from the He~\textsc{i} lines and the Bowen fluorescence (C~\textsc{iii}/N~\textsc{iii}) blend at 4650 Å. The emission lines redward of 5500 Å transition to pure absorption at orbital phases $\sim$0.75--0.95, which we attribute to obscuration of the line-emitting region by the accretion stream. Trailed spectra of the emission lines reveal multicomponent structures consistent with other polars. In this first Doppler study of EF Eri, tomograms of the strongest lines (He~\textsc{ii} 4686 Å and the Balmer lines), using both the standard and inside-out projections, identify three key emission regions: the irradiated face of the secondary star, the ballistic and threading regions of the accretion stream, and the magnetically confined flow. Our Doppler maps show not only the ballistic stream but also two unambiguous magnetic accretion flows, which is consistent with the presence of multiple magnetic accretion regions.

 - **Abstract**
 We present high-contrast direct spectroscopy of the low-mass, cool exoplanet 51 Eridani b (2-4 M$_\textrm{Jup}$, $\sim$750 K) using JWST / NIRSpec in a fixed-slit configuration (F290LP / G395H, $3-5\,\mu$m, R$\sim$2,700). A cross correlation analysis between the continuum-subtracted data and atmospheric forward models indicates a detection of molecular signals of planetary origin at $4.8\sigma$ at the expected position and velocity of the planet. The detection of the planetary signal is driven primarily by molecular features from methane and carbon monoxide, providing the first direct confirmation of these two molecules coexisting in chemical disequilibrium in the atmosphere of 51 Eridani b. A new comprehensive atmospheric model analysis shows consistency between the ground-based IFU spectroscopy and the NIRSpec data, with the best-fit model parameters: $T_\mathrm{eff}$ = 800$^{+21.5}_{-55.5}$ K, $\log g$ = 3.75$^{+0.09}_{-0.37}$, $[\mathrm{M}/\mathrm{H}]$ = 0.7$^{+0.07}_{-0.21}$, $\textrm{C}/\textrm{O}$ = 0.458$^{+0.08}_{-0.09}$, $\log K_\mathrm{zz}$ = 3$^{+0.47}_{-0.73}$, $R_\mathrm{P}$ = 1.36$^{+0.07}_{-0.03}$ $R_\mathrm{Jup}$, $f_\mathrm{hole}$ = 0.3$^{+0.10}_{-0.07}$, and the NIRSpec errorbar inflation parameter: $\hat{e}$ = 1.74$^{+0.02}_{-0.03}$. We conclude with a discussion on the lessons learned between the fixed slit and IFU-based high contrast spectroscopic methods from our observing program, including some possibilities to improve the analysis method.

 - **Abstract**
 Combinations of galaxy surveys and cosmic microwave background secondaries, such as the thermal Sunyaev Zeldovich (tSZ) effect, are increasingly being used to jointly constrain cosmology and astrophysical properties of the gas within and beyond halos. Standard cross-correlations measure a directionless correlation between the microwave maps and galaxy catalogs. However, more information about the cosmic web structure can be captured by summary statistics which include environmental constraints and measure oriented correlations along axes of structure, such as filaments or superclusters. This work studies the sensitivity of multipole moments of constrained oriented stacks, a directional and environmentally-dependent statistic, to variations in cosmological and astrophysical parameters. We run nine different 2.4 Gpc-per-side simulations with the Websky algorithm, varying the dark matter energy density within flat $\Lambda$CDM, and create mock tSZ maps with each. We also apply six different gas prescriptions, imitating AGN feedback variations, to the fiducial cosmology. We analyze oriented stacks of the tSZ signal in supercluster regions in each simulation, focusing on signal out to $\sim20$ transverse Mpc from massive ($M>5\times10^{13}~M_\odot$) halos. The cosmology variations affect anisotropic and isotropic measurements similarly, while the halo-pasted gas variations mostly affect the isotropic signal. Our results suggest it is worthwhile to incorporate directional information into SZ-galaxy cross-correlations to increase cosmological sensitivity and help break degeneracies with gas physics.

In this study, we introduce Mephisto -- a multi-agent collaboration framework powered by large language models (LLMs) that emulates human-like reasoning for analyzing multi-band galaxy observations. Mephisto interfaces with the CIGALE codebase (a library of spectral energy distribution, SED, models) to iteratively refine physical models against observational data. It conducts deliberate reasoning via tree search, accumulates knowledge through self-play, and dynamically updates its knowledge base. Validated across diverse galaxy populations -- including the James Webb Space Telescope's recently discovered "Little Red Dot" galaxies -- we show that Mephisto demonstrates proficiency in inferring the physical properties of galaxies from multi-band photometry, positioning it as a promising research copilot for astronomers. Unlike prior black-box machine learning approaches in astronomy, Mephisto offers a transparent, human-aligned reasoning process that integrates seamlessly with existing research practices. This work underscores the possibility of LLM-driven agent-based research for astronomy, establishes a foundation for fully automated, end-to-end artificial intelligence (AI)-powered scientific workflows, and unlocks new avenues for AI-augmented discoveries in astronomy.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxies falling into galaxy clusters can leave imprints on both the corona of galaxies and the intracluster medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters. Throughout this infall process, the galaxy's atmosphere is subjected to ram pressure from a headwind, leading to the stripping morphology observed in its tail. The morphological evolution is affected by the properties of the surrounding ICM such as magnetic fields and viscosity. In this Letter, we perform 3D Braginskii-magnetohydrodynamic simulations using the FLASH code with varied ICM viscosity models. Specifically, we explore four models: an inviscid case, unsuppressed isotropic viscosity, unsuppressed anisotropic viscosity, and anisotropic viscosity suppressed by plasma instabilities. Our findings indicate that the isotropic viscosity case effectively suppresses hydrodynamic instabilities and shows strong viscous heating and the least mixing with the ICM, enabling the formation of long, coherent tails. The inviscid model has the shortest tail due to vigorous mixing, and the models with anisotropic viscosity are in between. The model with suppressed anisotropic viscosity due to plasma instabilities exhibits enhanced turbulence in the galactic tail and a concurrent limitation in viscous heating compared to the model neglecting plasma instabilities. These findings highlight the significant impact of ICM plasma physics on the processes of ram pressure stripping of galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 Measuring starspot temperatures is crucial for understanding stellar magnetic activity, as it affects stellar brightness variations, influences exoplanet transit measurements, and provides constraints on the physical conditions and energy transport in active regions, offering insights into stellar dynamos. Our goal is to determine the temperature of starspots on the active star CoRoT-2 to enhance our understanding of magnetic activity in young, solar-like stars. Multiwavelength observations were conducted using the SPARC4 instrument on the 1.6-m telescope at Pico dos Dias Observatory (Brazil), capturing simultaneous transit data in four photometric bands (g, r, i, and z). The ECLIPSE model, combined with MCMC fitting, was used to model spot characteristics during the planetary transit of CoRoT-2 b. The spot intensities were analyzed considering three different methods: the assumption of blackbody emission, the PHOENIX atmospheric model, and multiwavelength fitting assuming the same spot parameters for all wavelengths. Two starspots were detected in the residuals of the light curve, yielding temperature estimates of 5040 - 5280 K based on the three different methods. These values align more closely with the temperatures of solar penumbrae than with typical umbral temperatures, suggesting relatively moderate magnetic activity. The radius of the spots ranged from 0.34 - 0.61 the planetary radius, or equivalently (38 - 69)$\times10^6$m, much larger than sunspots. This study provides a method to estimate spot temperatures on active stars using multiband photometry, with results indicating penumbral-like temperatures on CoRoT-2. The methodology enhances precision in starspot temperature estimation, beneficial for studies of stellar activity and exoplanet characterization.

 - **Abstract**
 In the context of maximum-likelihood parametric component separation for next-generation full-sky CMB polarization experiments, we study the impact of fitting different spectral parameters of Galactic foregrounds in distinct subsets of pixels on the sky, with the goal of optimizing the search for primordial B modes. Using both simulations and analytical arguments, we highlight how the post-component separation uncertainty and systematic foreground residuals in the cleaned CMB power spectrum depend on spatial variations in the spectral parameters. We show that allowing spectral parameters to vary across subsets of the sky pixels is essential to achieve competitive S/N on the reconstructed CMB after component separation while keeping residual foreground bias under control. Although several strategies exist to define pixel subsets for the spectral parameters, each with its advantages and limitations, we show using current foreground simulations in the context of next-generation space-borne missions that there are satisfactory configurations in which both statistical and systematic residuals become negligible. The exact magnitude of these residuals, however, depends on the mission's specific characteristics, especially its frequency coverage and sensitivity. We also show that the post-component separation statistical uncertainty is only weakly dependent on the properties of the foregrounds and propose a semi-analytical framework to estimate it. On the contrary, the systematic foreground residuals highly depend on both the properties of the foregrounds and the chosen spatial resolution of the spectral parameters.
