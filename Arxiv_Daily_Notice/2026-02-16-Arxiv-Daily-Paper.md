#### GAMERA-OP: A three-dimensional finite-volume MHD solver for orthogonal curvilinear geometries

 - **Abstract**
 We present GAMERA-OP (Orthogonal-Plus), a three-dimensional finite-volume magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) solver for orthogonal curvilinear geometries. The solver advances magnetic fields using constrained transport to preserve $\nabla\!\cdot\!\mathbf{B}=0$ to machine precision and employs geometry-consistent high-order reconstruction with an enhanced Partial Donor Cell method (e-PDM) that accounts for geometry curvature. Flexible numerics include various numerical fluxes and time integrators. In axial symmetric coordinates, angular momentum are preserved to round-off, and a ring-averaging treatment near the axis relaxes CFL constraints while maintaining divergence-free magnetic fields. Optional capabilities include the semi-relativistic (Boris) correction, background-field splitting, and an anisotropic MHD formulation. Rewritten in C, the code adopts a modular design that simplifies case setup and facilitates the addition of physics modules and coupling to other first-principles codes. Standard benchmarks across multiple geometries verify the code's high accuracy, low numerical diffusion, and robust handling of coordinate singularities and rotating flows. GAMERA-OP provides a practical, high-order framework for space and astrophysical plasma applications where orthogonal curvilinear coordinates and exact angular-momentum conservation are advantageous.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the physical origin of star formation suppression in gas-rich early-type galaxies using five high-resolution hydrodynamical idealized galaxy simulations, performed with the moving-mesh code AREPO. These simulations include one Milky Way-like galaxy and four early-type galaxies, of which one early-type galaxy is found to have significantly less star formation despite a substantial molecular gas reservoir. We apply a modified virial theorem to the overdensities in each galaxy to quantify the forces regulating their stability and thus star formation. We find evidence that, in the suppressed galaxy, strong Coriolis forces driven by elevated galactic shear may inhibit gravitational collapse. This is caused by the galaxy's high central compactness, providing a physical mechanism for the suppression of star formation that does not require the removal of molecular gas. In contrast, less compact early-type galaxies host more gravity-dominated clouds and therefore exhibit higher star formation rates. However, we find that this gravitational stability occurs without significantly increasing the classical Toomre-Q parameter, and therefore a new criterion for suppressed star formation may be needed. We also discuss the impact of our choice of overdensity scale and connections to observations of molecular clouds.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a panchromatic optical-mm characterization of GNz7q, a recently identified X-ray weak, rapidly growing red quasar embedded within a dusty starburst galaxy at $z=7.1899$, using the full suite of JWST/NIRCam, NIRSpec, MIRI, and archival NOEMA observations. Our deep NIRSpec/G395M spectroscopy reveals unambiguous broad Balmer emission (FWHM $=2221\pm20$kms$^{-1}$), confirming a super-Eddington accreting black hole ($\lambda_{\rm Edd}=2.7\pm0.4$) with a mass of $\log(M_{\rm BH}/M_{\odot})=7.55\pm0.34$, using accretion-rate corrected BH mass estimators. After subtracting the point source, we robustly detect stellar emission from the host galaxy across multiple NIRCam and MIRI filters. Out joint morphological-spectral analysis yields a stellar mass of $\log (M_*/M_\odot)=10.5\pm0.4$ and an intense star formation rate of ${\rm SFR}=330\pm97\,M_\odot\,\rm yr^{-1}$, confirming the host as a massive, dusty starburst galaxy. We find that GNz7q lies on the local $M_{\rm BH}$-$M_*$ relation ($M_{\rm BH}/M_*\simeq 0.001$) and is well positioned to evolve into the locus of massive SDSS quasars with $\log (M_{\rm BH}/M_\odot)\approx 9$ and $M_*\approx 10^{11}\,M_\odot$ at $z\sim 6$, owing to its remarkably rapid growth in both the black hole and its host galaxy. This stands in stark contrast to many recently reported JWST AGN populations at similar redshifts, including the little red dots (LRDs), whose weak or undetected star formation makes it difficult for them to grow into the massive galaxies hosting SDSS-like quasars. These results suggest that GNz7q marks as a rare, pivotal phase of early BH-galaxy co-eolution, plausibly providing a crucial direct pathway to the supermassive black hole systems within the first billion years of the Universe.
#### A boost in the precision of cluster-mass models: Exploiting the extended surface brightness of the lensed supernova Refsdal host galaxy

 - **Abstract**
 Combining deep Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images and extensive data from the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer, we present new mass models of the cluster MACS J1149.5+2223, strongly lensing the supernova (SN) Refsdal, fully exploiting the source surface-brightness distribution of the SN host for the first time. In detail, we incorporated 77,000 HST pixels, in addition to the known 106 point-like multiple images, in our modeling. We considered four different models to explore the effect of the relative weighting of the point-like multiple image positions and flux distribution of the SN host on the model optimization. When the SN host's extended image is included, we find that the statistical uncertainties of all 34 free model parameters are reduced by factors ranging from one to two orders of magnitude compared to the statistical uncertainty of the point-like only model, irrespective of the adopted different image weights. We quantified the remarkably increased level of precision with which the cluster's total mass and the predicted time delays of the SN Refsdal multiple image positions can be reconstructed. We also show the delensed image of the SN host, a spiral galaxy at zSN = 1.49, in multiple HST bands. In all those applications, we obtain a significant reduction of the statistical uncertainty, which is now below the level of even the small systematic uncertainty on the mass model that could be assessed by the different approaches. These results demonstrate that with extended image models of lensing clusters it is possible to measure the cluster's total mass distribution, the values of the cosmological parameters, and the physical properties of high-redshift sources with an unparalleled precision, making the typically not-quantified systematic uncertainties now crucial.
#### Searching for the Shortest-wavelength Aromatic Infrared Bands: No Evidence for the Predicted 1.05 $μ$m Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Feature

 - **Abstract**
 Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are responsible for a variety of near- and mid-infrared spectral features in Galactic and extragalactic sources. A feature at 1.05 $\mu$m arising from electronic transitions in PAH cations is predicted by laboratory experiments but has never been observationally confirmed. We conduct a dedicated search for this feature in absorption on a highly-extinguished sight line toward BD+40 4223, a blue supergiant in Cyg OB2, using the TripleSpec spectrograph at Palomar Observatory. We place a $5\sigma$ upper limit on the feature strength of $\Delta\tau_{1.05}/A_{V} < 5.6 \times10^{-3}$, ruling out theoretical estimates with $> 10\sigma$ significance. We constrain the effective temperature of BD+40 4223 to be $\log_{10}\left(T_{\rm eff}\right)=4.41\pm0.03$ and infer that it is veiled by $6.39\pm0.05$ magnitudes of visual extinction, consistent with but more constraining than previous determinations. As dust on the sight line toward BD+40 4223 appears typical of the diffuse interstellar medium, this non-detection challenges existing models of PAH material properties and/or charge distribution.
#### Excitation and Damping of Oscillation Modes in Gaseous Planets

 - **Abstract**
 The excitation and damping mechanisms for oscillation modes of gas giant planets are undetermined. We show that differential rotation may greatly enhance convective viscosity in giant planets, resulting in damping times of $t_{\rm damp} \sim 10^5-10^6 \, {\rm years}$ for f modes and low-order p modes. Radiative diffusion damps p modes on time scales of $t_{\rm damp} \sim 10^3-10^7 \, {\rm years}$. While the lethargic convective motions cannot effectively excite f mode or p modes, storms driven by condensation of water and/or silicates may play a role. High-order p modes are most effectively excited by cometary/asteroid impacts. Applying these calculations to solar system planets, water storms, rock storms, and impacts may all contribute to exciting the observed f modes amplitudes of Saturn via ring seismology. Similar f mode amplitudes with fractional gravitational perturbations of $\delta \Phi/\Phi \sim 10^{-10}-10^{-9}$ are expected for Jupiter and Uranus, apart from their lowest $\ell$ f modes which could have larger gravitational perturbations of $\delta \Phi/\Phi \sim 10^{-7}$. Rock storms may contribute to mode driving in Jupiter, while water storms are more important for Uranus. The highest-amplitude p modes are predicted to have periods of $\sim$10-30 minutes, with surface velocities of $\sim$10 cm/s for Jupiter and Saturn, and $\sim$1 cm/s for Uranus. These oscillation modes may be detectable with radial velocity measurements, ring seismology, or spacecraft Doppler tracking. However, both the damping and excitation physics are uncertain by orders of magnitude, so more careful examination of the relevant physics is required for robust estimates.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are rare transients that provide important insights into the physics of galactic nuclei. A recently identified feature in their optical light curves is the presence of early bump-like structures (precursors) that appear before the onset of the main flare or during its rise. Aims. We aim to build and study the first sample of precursor TDEs in order to improve our understanding of these features, which could be key to revealing the origin of the optical emission in TDEs. Methods. We compiled all known precursor TDEs from the literature, searched for additional candidates, and analyzed them as a sample. Results. We find that precursor TDEs predominantly fall within the repeating TDE, fast TDE, and TDE in active galactic nucleus (AGN) subclasses. We reveal a positive correlation between the occurrence time of the precursors relative to the main peak and the central black hole mass. Conclusions. We suggest that the precursors appear due to interactions between the incoming stellar debris and the disk or leftover material from an earlier disruption (repeating and fast TDEs) or a stable pre-existing disk (TDEs in AGNs). Precursors are therefore potentially key signatures of repeating partial TDEs in previously quiescent galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 X-ray pulse-profile modeling of millisecond pulsars offers a direct route to measuring neutron star masses and radii, thereby constraining the dense-matter equation of state. However, standard analyses typically rely on \emph{ad hoc} hotspot parameterizations rather than self-consistent physical models. While connecting surface heating directly to the magnetospheric geometry provides a more natural physical pathway, computing global magnetospheric solutions is too computationally expensive to perform on-the-fly during parameter inference. In this work, we bridge this gap by deriving fully analytic, first-principles expressions for surface return currents in mixed dipole--quadrupole magnetospheres. Working within force-free electrodynamics, we generalize the field-aligned current invariant $\Lambda$, the crucial scalar that maps the far-zone magnetic structure to the near-zone heating rate, from the standard dipole approximation to arbitrary quadrupolar configurations. We demonstrate that even when the quadrupole component is sub-dominant in the far zone (the mixing regime), using a dipole-based heating prescription fails to capture the significant enhancement or suppression of the return-current density on the polar cap. Our consistent quadrupole-aware framework reveals that these multipolar currents redistribute the surface heating, leading to systematic discrepancies in predicted pulse profiles that are amplified by atmosphere beaming and can reach $\sim 30\%$ near pulse peaks. These results provide a rigorous analytic foundation for mapping global magnetic geometry to surface heating in multipolar magnetospheres, enabling physically consistent inference beyond the idealized dipole approximation.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic reconnection is one of the prime candidate mechanisms that may energize the plasma emitting the strongly polarized X-ray emission from black hole X-ray binaries (BHXRBs) in their hard states. The mechanism requires strong magnetic fields in the upstream plasma entering the reconnection layer, and weaker, but still substantial, magnetic fields in the downstream regions. In this Letter, we estimate the coronal magnetic fields for three different magnetic energy dissipation mechanisms: plasmoid-dominated magnetic reconnection, fast collisionless reconnection, and magnetic field relaxation. We show that the lack of strong Faraday depolarization constrains viable models and can be used to benchmark numerical accretion flow models. We conclude by discussing the difficulties of disentangling the various effects that can depolarize the signals from BHXRBs at low energies. We furthermore emphasize that Faraday rotation is unlikely to play a role in the polarization of the coronal X-ray emission of active galactic nuclei.
#### Broadband Timing and Spectral Study of Accreting Millisecond X-ray Pulsar SAX J1808.4$-$3658 during Its 2022 Outburst

 - **Abstract**
 We report on our investigation of the NuSTAR and AstroSat observations along with simultaneous NICER observations of the accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar SAX J1808.4$-$3658, obtained during its tenth outburst from 2022. The NuSTAR observation captured the source near the outburst peak, while AstroSat observed it during the decay phase. Coherent pulsations at $\sim$401 Hz were detected throughout the outburst, with the fundamental amplitude in the 3--30 keV range increasing from $\sim$4% near the peak to $\sim$6% during the decay. The pulsations display strong energy dependence and negative time lags of $\sim$0.2--0.3 ms, with harder photons leading softer ones. The broadband spectra in both epochs are well described by a soft thermal component and Comptonized continuum, together with a prominent relativistic reflection component. As the outburst evolved, the continuum softened ($\Gamma$ increasing from $\sim$1.88 to $\sim$1.99) and the coronal electron temperature decreased ($kT_{\rm e}$ from $\sim$31 to $\sim$18 keV), consistent with enhanced Compton cooling at lower accretion rates. The ionization parameter declined ($\log \xi$ from $\sim$3.4 to $\sim$1.8) while the reflection fraction increased, suggesting a changing accretion geometry with a more compact corona and a larger disk covering fraction during the decay phase. The X-ray luminosity decreased by a factor of $\sim$3 between the two epochs. Our results suggest the coupled evolution of the corona, disk, and magnetosphere as the mass accretion rate declines.

 - **Abstract**
 Reliable predictions of weak rapid neutron capture ($\textit{r}$-process) abundances require a systematic treatment of nuclear physics uncertainties, especially neutron capture rates far from stability. We employ new neutron capture rates from cross sections calculated with Yet Another Hauser-Feshbach Code ($\texttt{YAHFC}$) using an uncertainty-quantified Koning-Delaroche potential modified for use on neutron-rich systems. Using these rates as a baseline, we perform Monte-Carlo studies with independent rate variations (uncorrelated Monte Carlo) and find correlations between specific neutron capture rates and the resulting elemental abundances for the three weak r-process scenarios: two separate simulations of neutron star merger remnant accretion disks and a simulation of a magnetorotational supernova. We discuss the underlying nuclear dynamics that give rise to these correlations and the role of astrophysical conditions in them. We demonstrate how reducing the uncertainty in these rates would improve the prospects for conducting precision $\textit{r}$-process studies in the future. We additionally present a correlated Monte Carlo study, which incorporates the full covariance matrix that describes the relationships between individual neutron capture rates that arise from an uncertainty-quantified optical potential. We find that the magnitude of the uncertainty in the abundance pattern is similar to that produced by an uncorrelated Monte Carlo that employs only the on-diagonal components of the covariance matrix. We show how correlations restructure how the abundances co-vary, but do not necessarily decrease the overall uncertainty envelope.
#### Cosmological Simulation with Population III Stellar Feedback and Metal Enrichment I: Model Description And Convergence Test

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new Pop III + Pop II subgrid framework implemented in the moving-mesh code {\sc arepo}, designed to study the impact of Pop III feedback on star formation in the early universe. The framework combines primordial non-equilibrium chemistry, metal-line cooling, IMF-sampled stellar evolution with SN feedback, and approximate Lyman-Werner (LW) and ionizing radiation transport. We run a suite of $1c{\rm Mpc}/h$ box simulations with different initial conditions and resolutions from $z=127$ to $z=10$. The highest gas mass and spatial resolution in the fiducial simulation reach $\sim10\,{\rm M_{\odot}}$ and $\sim4\,{\rm pc}$, respectively. The model successfully reproduces the UV-inferred Pop II star formation rate density (SFRD) from recent JWST observations across all initial conditions, with only minor variation driven by local halo interactions and LW irradiation. We find that the volume filling factor of metal-enriched gas converges to $\sim1\%$ at $z=10$. Convergence is achieved once subhalos with $M_{\rm subhalo}\gtrsim 10^{6.5}\,{\rm M_{\odot}}$ are resolved, and the total stellar mass at $z=10$ is largely insensitive to initial conditions or the resolution considered in this work. A fiducial simulation requires $\sim 10^4$ CPU hours, making the framework computationally tractable for larger box simulations and enabling future large parameter studies of stellar physics or environment effects such as Pop III IMF variations, X-ray radiation, or the streaming velocity at high redshift.
#### Parker Solar Probe observations of solar energetic particle (SEP) events with inverse velocity arrival (IVA) features

 - **Abstract**
 In SEP events, velocity dispersion (VD) is characterized by the earlier arrival of faster, higher-energy particles relative to slower ones, assuming negligible acceleration time and transport effects. The "Labor Day event" at Parker Solar Probe (PSP) on 2022 September 5 provided a unique arrival profile, in which the medium energy (~ few MeV) particles arrive earlier than both lower and higher energy particles. This created a so-called "nose" structure in the intensity spectrogram formed by measurements from the two energetic particle instruments, EPI-Lo and EPI-Hi, of the Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun (ISOIS) suite. Unlike typical VD, the delayed arrival of higher energy particles compared to medium energy particles, i.e., the "inverse velocity arrival" (IVA), could be caused by various acceleration, transport, and instrumental effects, including shock acceleration. By applying a new method based on the contour-line of the intensity, we found 14 IVA events in the ISOIS observations up to the end of 2024. Several parameters that may modify velocity dispersion characteristics are further explored including the spacecraft radial distance, the speed of corresponding CMEs and shocks, the angle between the shock normal and the upstream magnetic field, and the spacecraft magnetic footpoint longitudinal separation from the flare location. The energy of the early arriving particles, i.e., the nose energy, can be grouped into low (L, <0.5 MeV), medium(M, 0.5 - 5 MeV), and high(H, >5 MeV) categories. Most (11/14) of the IVA events have medium nose energies. This SEP list provides ingredients for examination of shock acceleration in the inner heliosphere, and the existence of IVA events sheds new light on the acceleration and propagation of SEPs.

 - **Abstract**
 The physical nature and origins of the newly discovered class of Odd Radio Circles (ORCs) remain unclear. We investigate a model whereby ORCs are synchrotron-emitting vortex rings formed by the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability (RMI) when a shock interacts with a low-density fossil radio lobe in the intergalactic medium using 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations. These rings initially exhibit oscillatory behavior that damps over time. We implement a new method to model Inverse-Compton cooling and synchrotron cooling at high frequencies in a scale-free manner, enabling us to test a wide range of model parameters against the observational constraints. We find that shock strengths of Mach 2-4 are consistent with the data, as expected in accretion, merger-driven, or active galactic nuclei-driven shocks. We find that the initial size of the bubbles required to explain the rings ranges from 140 to 250 kpc, with initial energy in the bubble of order $10^{57}-10^{59}$ erg, consistent with fossil lobes inflated by moderately powerful radio galaxies. Derived ambient pressures and densities place ORCs in low density environments, such as the outskirts of galaxy groups with ages of order 70-200 Myr. Our synthetic radio maps match the polarization properties of ORC1 and predict a dependency of the tangential magnetic field angle on the aspect ratio of ORCs. A key distinguishing trait of the RMI-driven vortex ring model is that it does not require the ORC to be centered on its host galaxy and is therefore redshift agnostic.

 - **Abstract**
 Traditional interstellar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) diagnostics rely on empirical band ratios, which often suffer from information loss and sample-selection bias. We introduce a machine learning framework that bypasses these limitations by treating the complete 2.75-20 micron emission spectrum as a high-dimensional fingerprint. Using a Random Forest classifier trained on a dataset of 23,653 spectra, we achieve a robust classification F1-score of about 0.96 across 12 size and charge categories. Our model maintains high performance on synthetic mixtures of unseen molecules. Feature importance analysis reveals that PAH size diagnostics are not universal but highly charge-dependent; while neutral size is traced mainly by C-H stretching modes, sizing ionized species also relies on the morphology of 6-8 micron C-C complexes, with the 12.5 micron feature emerging as a robust cross-charge tracer. This approach provides a robust, data-driven pathway for decoding the physical conditions of the interstellar medium.

 - **Abstract**
 We present Guangqi, a new two-dimensional, finite-volume radiation hydrodynamics code designed for high-performance astrophysical simulations. The code simultaneously resolves the hydrodynamic equations for complex equations of state (EoS) and implicit radiation transport under the flux-limited diffusion approximation. Written in Fortran and parallelized via the Message Passing Interface. Guangqi supports analytic hydrogen and helium EoS under the assumption of local thermal and chemical equilibrium. The framework is compatible with both Cartesian and spherical-polar geometries -- utilizing non-uniform grid spacing -- and incorporates static (SMR) and adaptive mesh refinement to optimize computational efficiency. To address the inherent challenges of angular momentum conservation in spherical-polar coordinates, we implement a robust and consistent "passive scalar angular momentum algorithm" (PSAMA). Domain decomposition is managed through both Z-order and Hilbert space-filling curves to ensure scalability. The code has been rigorously verified against a suite of standard benchmarks and newly designed test cases specifically intended to diagnose the non-linear coupling between gas dynamics, intricate EoS, radiation transport, and angular momentum conservation.
#### The Structure and Evolution of LRDs: Insights from JWST NIRSpec Medium and High Resolution Spectroscopy at $z\sim4$

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of medium/high-resolution JWST/NIRSpec spectra for 11 LRDs at $z \sim 4$. By decomposing the broad and narrow components of the Balmer emission lines, we investigate the connection between line emission and UV/optical continua for the LRD population. We find that the broad H$\alpha$ luminosity strongly correlates with the optical continuum (but not with the UV), indicating a common AGN origin for both. In contrast, the [O III] line strength is correlated with the UV continuum rather than the optical. Using the width and luminosity of the broad H$\alpha$ line, we estimate central black hole masses of $10^6-10^8 M_{\odot}$ accreting at high Eddington ratios, consistent with an early ($\lambda_{\rm Edd} \sim 0.6$), rapid-growth phase of AGN evolution. Assuming a constant mass accretion rate in the framework of slim-disk models, we infer growth timescales of $\sim 10^5-10^7\rm yr$, and suggest LRDs may evolve into narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies. Upper limits from our spectra indicate that LRDs exhibit intrinsically weak optical Fe II emission compared to typical AGN. To simultaneously account for the inferred broad-line region size and observed luminosity, we propose a "Clumpy Envelope" model in which the optical emission arises from an extended, clumpy gas with a characteristic radius of tens of light-days. The diversity in observed optical continuum shapes can be explained by radial temperature gradients and self-absorption effects within this structure. Our results demonstrate the power of JWST high-resolution spectroscopy in probing the central engines and physical nature of the LRD population.

 - **Abstract**
 Infall and outflows, coupled with magnetic fields, rapidly structure the gas around newborn protostars. Shocks from interacting components encode the temperature and density distribution, offering a direct probe of the earliest evolution history. However, interferometric observations characterizing warm envelopes using high-excitation lines remain scarce. We present ALMA Band 9 observations of the Taurus dense core MC 27/L1521F, which hosts a Class 0 protostar, targeting the CO($J$=6-5) line at an angular resolution of $\sim$2\arcsec\ ($\approx$300 au). We detect an off-centered ring-like structure with a diameter of $\sim$1000 au that was not identifiable in previous low-$J$ CO data, where emission close to the systemic velocity is strongly affected by optical depth. The ring shows a typical peak brightness temperature of $\sim$3 K at our resolution. Excitation considerations indicate that the detected CO($J$=6-5) emission likely arises from relatively warm ($T \gtrsim 20$ K) and dense ($n({\rm H_2}) \gtrsim 10^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$) gas embedded within the surrounding cold, dense core. The morphology and kinematics suggest an energetic and localized shock-heating event, potentially linked to dynamical gas--magnetic-field interactions in the earliest protostellar phase. Our results demonstrate that high-$J$ CO observations provide a powerful new window on warm and dense gas components, enabling a more direct view of the physical processes operating at the onset of star formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars significantly contribute to the chemical composition of the universe. In their outflows, complex chemistry takes place, which critically depends on the local temperature. Therefore, if we want to accurately model the AGB environment, we need accurate cooling rates. The CO molecule is abundant in AGB outflows, and has a dipole moment, which enables it to cool through emission from its rotational transitions. We therefore expect it to significantly contribute to cooling in this environment, even at low temperatures ($10$ K $\leqslant T\leqslant 3000$ K). Currently, CO cooling rates are available for ISM-like conditions, which encompasses a different parameter regime, with generally lower densities and velocity gradients, compared to AGB winds. Therefore, these ISM cooling rates might not be applicable to the AGB regime. In this paper, we compute CO cooling rates for hydrodynamics simulations of AGB outflows. To evaluate the net cooling rate, we calculate the energy level distribution of CO self-consistently, using the non Local Thermodynamical Equilibrium (NLTE) line radiative transfer code Magritte. We verify whether already existing CO cooling rate prescriptions for the interstellar medium (ISM) are applicable for this regime. We noticed minor differences between these prescriptions and our calculated cooling rates in general. However, when used far outside their originally intended parameter regimes, significant differences occur. Therefore, we propose a new CO cooling rate prescription for the AGB environment and we study how the computed cooling rate varies depending on input parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 We present PrestaLine: Gorynych, a comprehensive numerical tool designed to model the dynamical, chemical, and spectral evolution of collapsing molecular cores from the prestellar phase to protostellar accretion. The code integrates three key components: (1) Kamelung, a 1D hydrodynamics module simulating gravitational collapse up to first hydrostatic core (FHSC) formation followed by an accretion of envelope onto a young star; (2) Presta, a chemical evolution module post-processing density and temperature profiles to compute time-dependent molecular abundances; and (3) Uran(IA), a radiative transfer module generating synthetic molecular line spectra. We apply Gorynych to compare low-mass (5 Msun) and high-mass (50 Msun) cores, finding that their dynamical evolution is remarkably similar, with differences primarily in spatial scaling. Chemical evolution reveals sharp abundance changes during the FHSC transition, particularly for CO, H2O, and HCO+, though pre-collapse chemical initialization has minimal impact on most species. Spectral maps of 13CO(2-1), HCO+(3-2), and H2O(110--101) lines show distinct kinematic signatures of infall and depletion, with high-mass cores exhibiting spatially extended emission. Our results highlight Gorynych's utility to couple theoretical collapse models and observations, providing a framework to diagnose core evolution and initial conditions from molecular line data.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the multi-temperature structure of the intracluster medium (ICM) in the Centaurus cluster core observed with XRISM/Resolve. Thanks to its high energy resolution, Resolve enables us to measure fine structures of highly ionized emission lines from Si to Fe and to directly determine the excitation temperature and the ionization temperature from the emission line ratio diagnostics. The observed spectrum in the Centaurus core is well-represented by a double-temperature thermal plasma at collisional ionization equilibrium state rather than an isothermal one. The line ratio diagnostics also support this biphasic temperature structure. Particularly, the observed line ratios show a trend of increasing ionization temperature with atomic mass, while the ionization and excitation temperatures of Fe show nearly the same temperature. The resultant line ratios, which are well-represented by the two temperatures ICM, ~ 1.6 and ~ 3 keV, are also fairly consistent with the expected numbers when assuming the radial single-temperature ICM was projected in the cluster core along the line of sight. Due to the limited low-energy sensitivity of the Resolve with the gate valve closed, we investigated the effect of the cool component using the XMM-Newton/RGS spectrum, but it ultimately did not affect our results. The observed flux ratio between the Fe XXV He alpha resonance and forbidden lines shows an about 20% reduction, suggesting the presence of resonant scattering.
#### On The Stability Of $H_0$ And The Inverse Distance Ladder

 - **Abstract**
 The `Inverse Distance Ladder' uses relative-distance measurements with type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), anchored to an absolute distance scale from Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and the cosmic microwave background (CMB), to provide an alternative measurement technique for the local expansion rate $H_0$. Using SNe Ia from the Dark Energy Survey and BAO measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, we show that the inverse distance ladder is unable to explain the Hubble Tension, anchored as it is to the CMB and its value of $H_0 = 67.4 \pm 0.5$ kms$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. To do so, we first show that the suite of systematics considered in cosmology analyses with SNe Ia only move the inferred $H_0$ by $<0.1$kms$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, and second, we investigate the scale of redshift-dependent magnitude changes necessary to change the inferred inverse distance ladder $H_0$ from $67$ to the local network of distance measurements value of $73$, and the impact that this would have on other cosmological inferences with SNe Ia. We find that a change of $d\mu/dz = 0.2$ mag would be necessary to infer an $H_0$ in concordance with local distance measurements, and that this $d\mu/dz$ value would result in a Flat $\Lambda$CDM $\Omega_M = 0.23$, $10\sigma$ discrepant with other cosmological probes, {indicating that the precision of SNe Ia measurements preclude the necessary redshift evolution for an $H_0$ of 74 kms$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$}. Therefore, we conclude that current SN Ia cosmology leaves little freedom for the inverse distance ladder to yield $H_0$ values significantly different from $67$ kms$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$.

 - **Abstract**
 The main objective is to calibrate the OPT-IR luminosity relation for quasars, focusing on accurate estimations of dusty torus and accretion disk luminosities. We analyzed contaminations related to host galaxies, particularly from polar dust, the interstellar medium, and stellar emission that affect the optical and infrared. We used a sample of nearly 400 quasars with photometrical observations and spectroscopical redshift divided into four redshift bins (0.7-2.4). Full spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting was performed with the CIGALE code, and results were compared with simplified photometric luminosity estimates. The impact of non-active galactic nucleus components and the role of polar dust in the fitting process were assessed. We show that for sources with a disk luminosity above 10^45 [erg/s], the photometric estimates are consistent with SED-based values. While polar dust contributes marginally to luminosity, its presence significantly alters SED fitting, particularly the torus opening angle and cold dust properties. In the optical domain, stellar emission is the dominant contamination. In the infrared, disk emission and cold dust play major roles. We propose two empirical calibrations for the OPT-IR relation. We conclude that the optical band is dominated by the accretion disk component above 10^45 or 10^46 [erg/s] depending on redshift, while IR luminosity is dominated by the dusty torus emission above 1.6 $\times$ 10^45 or 2 $\times$ 10^46 [erg/s] depending on the redshift. In this high-luminosity regime, simplified photometric methods yield reliable disk and torus luminosity estimates. The aim of the analysis we present is to test the parameter space in order to build a well behaving OPT-IR nonlinear luminosity relation for quasars that could serve as a cosmological probe.

 - **Abstract**
 We present new constraints on ultralight axion-like particles (ALPs) through multi-epoch measurements of differential birefringence induced due to a coupling ($g_{a\gamma}$) between the ALP and electromagnetic fields. Broadband polarimetric observations in the 2-8 GHz range of the gravitationally lensed system CLASS B1152+199 were carried out over five epochs spanning three months with a cadence of roughly 20 days, and the differential birefringence angle ($\Delta\,\theta_{a,{\rm lens}}$) between the lensed images were estimated. We also combined an archival observation that effectively increases the span to 9.5 yr to probe the effect of an oscillating ALP field imprinted as oscillating ${\Delta\,\theta_{a,{\rm lens}}}$ over time. Here we present a new technique for combining multi-epoch measurements of ${\Delta\,\theta_{a,{\rm lens}}}$ by considering the coherence of the ALP field, such that, ${\Delta\,\theta_{a,{\rm lens}}}$ over these observations are related. The time scale of coherence depends on the mass of the ALP field ($m_a$). With these new observations, we constrain $g_{a\gamma} \leq 9.0\times 10^{-12} \,\left( {\rho_{a,\text{em}}}/{20 \text{ GeV cm}^{-3}} \right)^{-1/2}\;\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ to $\leq 3.5\times 10^{-8} \,\left( {\rho_{a,\text{em}}}/{20 \text{ GeV cm}^{-3}} \right)^{-1/2}\;\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ for $m_a$ between $1.6\times 10^{-22}\;\mathrm{eV}$ and $3.8\times 10^{-18}\;\mathrm{eV}$, where $\rho_{a,{\rm em}}$ is the density of the ALP field at emission. This improves over the constraint provided by the CERN Axion Solar Telescope by up to an order of magnitude in the $m_a$ range $1.6\times 10^{-22}\;\mathrm{eV}$ to $3\times 10^{-21}$ eV.

 - **Abstract**
 Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars have recently attracted attention as possible drivers of early chemical enrichment, including the production of fluorine, whose nucleosynthetic origin remains debated. To test the contribution of massive stars to fluorine production in the early Universe, we conducted Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Band~5 spectroscopy of the HF(1-0) absorption line toward a dusty star-forming galaxy at $z=6.024$. This galaxy has a known gas-phase metallicity and is too young for low-mass AGB stars to have contributed significantly, providing a clean environment to isolate massive-star yields. We do not detect significant HF absorption ($\sim2\sigma$) and derive a conservative 5$\sigma$ upper limit of $N_\mathrm{HF}/N_\mathrm{H_2} < 2.2\times10^{-9}$. This limit is about an order of magnitude below typical local measurements, indicating inefficient fluorine enrichment $\sim0.9$\,Gyr after the Big Bang. Comparison with chemical evolution models shows that our constraint is consistent with scenarios without WR yields at this epoch. Expanding the sample of HF absorption measurements in high-redshift galaxies with well-characterized metallicities will be crucial for tracing the onset of WR enrichment and fluorine production across cosmic time.

 - **Abstract**
 Kink oscillation frequency is a key parameter for coronal seismology. It is still unclear how gravitational stratification affects the kink frequency in curved coronal loops. This work aims to investigate the effect of gravitational stratification on the frequency of kink oscillations in curved coronal loops and discuss their seismological potential. We conduct numerical computations within the ideal MHD framework to study different kink polarizations and harmonics in a curved, gravitationally stratified coronal loop. The oscillation frequencies derived from the Lagrangian displacement are compared with the WKB approximation. For the vertically polarized fundamental mode, the oscillation frequency deviates from the WKB approximation by about 18\% in the current numerical setup. Nevertheless, the oscillation frequency closely matches the local Alfvén frequency near the loop apex. On the other hand, the frequency of the horizontally polarized fundamental mode exhibits only a 7\% deviation in our current model from the WKB approximation and closely matches the local Alfvén frequency near one quarter of the loop. For the first overtones, the frequencies for both polarizations can be well described by the WKB approximation. The frequency of vertically polarized fundamental kink modes can be predicted by the local Alfvén frequency near the loop apex. In contrast, the WKB approximation remains highly reliable for estimating the frequency of horizontally polarized fundamental modes and first overtones, which is also well described by the local Alfvén frequency near one quarter of the loop. These results therefore pave the way for spatially dependent coronal seismology, enabling, e.g., the probing of magnetic field strength at different locations along a coronal loop.

 - **Abstract**
 The Magellanic Clouds (MCs) offer a unique laboratory for studying galaxy interaction and the evolution of dwarf galaxies. By investigating when and how stars formed, the star formation history (SFH) is a powerful tool to provide constraints for dynamical modeling of the system's past interactions and understand the processes of stripping and triggered star formation in tidally influenced environments. We aim to reconstruct the SFH of the Magellanic Bridge, the gaseous and stellar stream connecting the two Clouds. We used data from the deep optical STEP survey, which covers 54 $\mathrm{deg\, {^{2}}}$ across the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) and the Bridge, reaching stars below the oldest main sequence turnoff at the distance of the MCs. We applied the synthetic color-magnitude diagram (CMD) technique to 14 deg$^2$ of STEP data. We constructed two libraries of synthetic stellar populations based on the PARSEC-COLIBRI and BaSTI stellar evolutionary models, with metallicities in the range $-2.0\leq[$Fe/H$]\leq0$ across the whole Hubble time. We find a clear peak of recent star formation $\sim100$ Myr ago in the Magellanic Bridge, which becomes increasingly pronounced toward the SMC. The low metallicity of this population suggests that it formed from gas stripped from the SMC during its most recent close encounter with the LMC. In the eastern part of the Bridge (LMC side), the star formation peaks at earlier times, around 10 Gyr and 2 Gyr ago. We estimate a total stellar mass in the Bridge of $ (5.1 \pm 0.2) \times 10^5 M_\odot$ and a present-day stellar metallicity of $[$Fe/H$]\sim0.6$ dex, close to SMC value.

 - **Abstract**
 We present time-series medium-band (R~20-40) observations of the third interstellar object 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1) obtained with the 7-Dimensional Telescope (7DT), enabling spatially resolved monitoring of its gas and dust activity from 2025 July to September. The m400-band image (lambda_c = 400 nm, Delta lambda approx 25 nm) reveals the emergence of pronounced and spatially extended CN emission at heliocentric distances r_h < 3 au. This onset is consistently identified across multiple diagnostics, including a break in the light-curve evolution, excess reflectance, inward expansion of annular excess beyond 10,000-20,000 km, growth of the coma half-light radius from ~11,000 to ~19,000 km, and a rapid rise in the CN production rate Q_CN relative to Af rho. We further separate the CN-emitting and dust-scattered components through two-dimensional surface-brightness fitting into inner (dust) and outer (gas) components. The outer component preserves a nearly constant profile shape, varying only in normalization, implying relatively fast expansion of CN-bearing molecules. Together, these results reveal a transition in the optical from dust-dominated scattering at large heliocentric distances to volatile-driven, gas-dominated activity as 3I/ATLAS enters the inner Solar System. The timing and characteristics of the CN activation resemble the volatile enhancement observed in 2I/Borisov, suggesting that both known active interstellar objects exhibit comparable activation behavior at heliocentric distances of ~2-3 au.

 Aim. We present and interpret the data of the nearby hydrogen-deficient but helium-rich superluminous supernova SN~2021bnw which reached a magnitude of -20.7 at maximum luminosity in g band. Methods. We discuss the light curves and spectra of SN 2021bnw based on its spectro-photometric follow up exploiting different observational facilities. We reproduce the NIR spectrum of SN 2021bnw with TARDIS to inspect the chemical composition at late photospheric phases and identify helium features. We also use a STELLA model coupling hydrodynamics and radiation transport to constrain the physical parameters of the explosion assmunig a 56Ni+CSM scenario. Results. We suggest that SN 2021bnw was mainly powered by the interaction of the ejecta with a previously lost He-rich circumstellar material, coupled with a central power source. Conclusions. This work expands the data sample of He-rich superluminous supernovae rich (SLSNe Ib) and, assuming a single progenitor scenario, can constrain the masses and the physics of their progenitors.

 - **Abstract**
 Modern time-domain surveys produce alert streams at a scale that makes exhaustive manual inspection infeasible, requiring automated methods to identify unusual transients for follow-up. In this work, we present an unsupervised anomaly detection pipeline applied to the ZTF alert stream using the Lasair broker. We define normal objects as SN Ia, SN II, and SN Ib/c. Anomalous objects include (i) more exotic transients (AGN, TDEs, SLSNe, CVs, and nuclear transients) and (ii) supernova-labeled objects, either spectroscopically or by Lasair, with anomalous properties, such as incorrect or absent host associations, or non-supernova-like light curves. Our pipeline consists of three independently trained simple autoencoders operating on distinct alert stream data products: object features, triplet image cutouts, and light curves. Each model is trained on predominantly normal transients, and performance is assessed using the recall of exotic objects and the purity of all anomalous objects across both a spectroscopically classified held-out test set and the live alert stream. In the test set, performance is evaluated at a fixed rank corresponding to the top ten scoring candidates, while in the alert stream it is evaluated using an anomaly threshold defined from test set behavior. Across both settings, the algorithms consistently recover exotic transients and anomalous supernovae among their top-ranked candidates. Over 25 days of live alert stream application, we identify 87 unusual supernova candidates for follow-up. The overlap between anomalies flagged by different autoencoders in the test set is non-existent, and in the alert stream is small, with maximum overlap between any two algorithms being 11 objects. The framework is data-efficient, requiring only a few thousand training examples, making it well suited for early and ongoing application to the Rubin Observatory alert stream.

 - **Abstract**
 The unprecedented rest-frame UV and optical coverage provided by JWST enables simultaneous constraints on the electron density (n$_{\rm e}$) and temperature (T$_{\rm e}$) of ionized gas in galaxies at z>5. We present a self-consistent direct method based on multiple OIII]1661,66) and [OIII] ($\lambda$4363, and $\lambda$5007) transitions to characterize the physical conditions of the high-ionization zone. This new approach is insensitive to a wide range of n$_{\rm e}$ due to the high critical densities of the OIII] and [OIII] transitions. Applying this technique to six galaxies at z=5-9, we find electron densities up to n$_{\rm e}$$\sim 3\times 10^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$ and temperatures of T$_{\rm e}$ $\sim 20,000$ K in systems at $z>6$. Accounting for these self-consistent densities changes the derived T$_{\rm e}$ and modifies the inferred metallicities by up to 0.29 dex relative to previous estimates. We discuss the reported N/O overabundances in the high-$z$ galaxies from our sample, which arise entirely from the high N$^{3+}$/H$^{+}$ values inferred from NIV] lines. We point out that a T$_{\rm e}$-stratification, in which the N$^{3+}$ zone has a slightly higher T$_{\rm e}$ than T$_{\rm e}$([OIII]), could substantially reduce the inferred N/O. Quantitatively, if T$_{\rm e}$(N$^{3+}$) were 10\% higher than T$_{\rm e}$([OIII]), this could induce a systematic overestimation of N$^{3+}$/O$^{2+}$ of nearly 50\%. Classical N/O diagnostics such as N$^{+}$/O$^{+}$, due to their critical densities, can significantly impact the inferred N/O abundance in the presence of high-density gas, whereas N$^{2+}$/O$^{2+}$ place these galaxies closer to $z\sim0$ systems in the N/O-O/H plane. Future JWST programs with larger and more diverse samples will be essential to test the universality and robustness of these results.

 - **Abstract**
 Modern time-domain surveys, such as the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), detect far more extragalactic transients than can be spectroscopically classified. Photometric classification offers a scalable alternative, enabling the identification of larger, fainter, and higher-redshift supernova samples suitable for applications such as Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) cosmology. We present a feature-based photometric classifier for SNe detected by ZTF, with the primary goal of constructing a photometric SN Ia sample for cosmological analyses. Our approach utilises the autoencoder architecture of ParSNIP (Boone 2021) to capture the intrinsic diversity of SN light curves. We trained the model on a spectroscopically classified ZTF SN sample, incorporating a realistic noise augmentation procedure that simulates the flux uncertainties of fainter sources. Light curve features were used to train a gradient-boosted decision tree classifier, implemented in both binary (SN Ia vs. non-Ia) and multi-class configurations. We validated our classifier on independent, fainter ZTF data with and without noise augmentation. To evaluate real-time performance, we also applied our classifier to live ZTF alerts and conducted a spectroscopic classification survey within the ePESSTO+ collaboration. We found that noise augmentation significantly improves classification performance, particularly for fainter sources. Our binary classifier achieves an SN Ia recall of (98.1 $\pm$ 0.4)%, averaged across five train-test splits. SN Ia recall exceeds 98% for events with a peak apparent magnitude up to 20 and more than 10 detections, and remains above 96% up to magnitude 20.5. Overall, 95% of sources were correctly classified in both binary and multi-class modes. Our classifier performs efficiently on real ZTF data and enables construction of a large photometric SN Ia sample for cosmology.

 - **Abstract**
 Observational appearance of debris disks is largely controlled by collisional grinding of their dust grains. However, the mechanical strength of dust at sizes in the micrometer to millimeter range is poorly known. Recent studies suggested that dust particles in the Solar system might have a higher critical fragmentation energy $Q_{D}^*$ value than previously anticipated. Another recent study considered the Fomalhaut debris disk and found lower $Q_{D}^*$ values to provide better fits to the data. In order to constrain the mechanical strength of dust, we investigate collisional evolution of debris disks with $Q_{D}^*$ prescriptions differing by $\sim 3$ orders of magnitude. We find that, above a certain threshold $Q_{D}^*$ value, the disk's collisional evolution is dominated by rebounding -- rather than disruptive or cratering -- collisions. Rebounding (a.k.a. bouncing) collisions are those in which both impactors survive, being only slightly eroded and producing fragments that only carry a minor fraction of their mass. We show that disks dominated by rebounding collisions would have brightness profiles increasing outward outside the parent belt. Since such profiles are not observed, this places an upper limit on how hard the debris dust is allowed to be in order not to violate the observations. We derive an approximate analytic expression for this limit: $Q_{D}^* \approx (1/8) v_{K}^2(r)$ for grains close to the radiation pressure blowout size, where $v_{K}$ in the Keplerian circular speed at a distance $r$ from the star. This implies $Q_{D}^* \lesssim 10^{9...10} \,\hbox{erg}\,\hbox{g}^{-1}$ for micrometer-sized grains in typical debris disks. Even though rebounding collisions are not expected to affect debris disk evolution significantly, we emphasize that these collisions are actually much more frequent than disruptive and cratering ones in all debris disks.

 - **Abstract**
 Post-starburst (PSB) galaxies, having recently experienced a starburst followed by rapid quenching, are excellent laboratories to probe physical mechanisms that drive starbursts and shutting down of star formation. Integral-field spectroscopy reveals the galaxies' spatially-resolved properties, where observed directional patterns can be linked to the galaxies' past evolution. We measure the resolved star-formation histories (SFHs), stellar metallicity evolution and dust properties of three local PSBs from the MaNGA survey, down to $0.5$" resolution ($\sim0.3\,$kpc) using a hierarchical Bayesian model. Local parameters were constrained simultaneously with parameters describing spatial trends. We found that all three galaxies first experienced an outer, weaker and slower quenching starburst, followed by a central, stronger and faster quenching starburst that peaked $\sim 1\,$Gyr after the first. The central starbursts induced a significantly stronger rise in stellar metallicity compared to the outer starbursts. These results are consistent with the effects of a recent gas-rich (wet) merger, where the first pericentre passage triggered starbursts in the outer regions, while the later coalescence triggers a stronger centralised starburst. We find non-axisymmetric features in the maps of burst mass fraction and dust attenuation in all galaxies, which could be caused by tidal effects during the recent merger. Comparisons with literature binary merger simulations suggests that the galaxies' rapid quenching was driven by gas consumption and the stabilisation against gas gravitational collapse by a growing spheroid, while AGN feedback was not necessarily a primary cause.

 - **Abstract**
 Using long-term observations from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) along with spectroscopic observations from the 3.6 m Devasthal Optical Telescope (DOT), we present a comprehensive time-series and spectral analysis of the intermediate polar V515 And. Our analysis reveals that V515 And resides within the period gap, with the detection of its orbital period of 2.73116 h. Additionally, we confirm the earlier findings of the spin and beat periods to be 465.4721 s and 488.6067 s, respectively. The time-resolved timing analysis reveals that V515 And undergoes changes in its accretion geometry, not only between different TESS sectors but also within individual sector observations. The system exhibits a transition in the dominant accretion mode, switching between disc-fed and stream-fed accretion. In the TESS light curve, we identify two successive outburst-like episodes, each persisting for roughly a day and reaching peak luminosities of $2.7\times10^{33}$ and $1.9\times10^{33}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Our analysis suggests that these bursts belong to the recently proposed class of micronovae. The optical spectrum of V515 And is characterised by strong Balmer and He II emission lines and shows an inverse Balmer decrement indicating the magnetic nature of the source.
