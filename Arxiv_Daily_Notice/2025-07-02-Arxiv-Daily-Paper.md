 - **Abstract**
 Brightness statistics for satellites of the Starlink, BlueBird, Qianfan, Guowang and OneWeb constellations are reported. The means and standard deviations are compared to acceptable limits set by the International Astronomical Union's Centre for the Protection of the Dark and Quiet Sky From Satellite Constellations Interference. Nearly all these spacecraft exceed the magnitude 7+ brightness limit pertaining to interference with professional research. Most also exceed the magnitude 6 reference where they distract from aesthetic appreciation of the night sky.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic fields permeate the Universe, including galaxy clusters, and affect the thermodynamical properties of the intra-cluster medium (ICM). Cosmological simulations predict that seed magnetic fields are amplified up to the $\mu$G-level in the ICM, but the magnetic field strength and structure have been studied in only a few clusters. Abell 2142 is a local massive cluster that shows evidence of a post-merger dynamical state. In this work, we aim to constrain the magnetic field intensity, radial profile and power spectrum within its ICM, providing key insights into the nature of this non-thermal component in galaxy clusters. We present MeerKAT observations of Abell 2142 in the L-band (872-1712 MHz), imaged in polarisation for the first time with this purpose. We derive the Rotation Measure (RM) from the radio galaxies' polarised emission by applying the RM synthesis technique and analyse both the RM and fractional polarisation ($\mathrm{F_p}$). To investigate the magnetic field distribution within the ICM, we compare our results with mock RM maps generated from 3D simulations of the cluster. We find that the RM dispersion, $\sigma_{\mathrm{RM}}$, decreases with projected radius, whereas the $\mathrm{F_p}$ increases. Both trends suggest that the magnetic field intensity decreases at larger distances from the cluster center, in agreement with studies on other clusters. Assuming that the magnetic field energy density scales with the gas thermal energy ($B \propto n_e^{0.5}$), a magnetic field with a power spectrum ranging from scales between 7 and 470 kpc, with peak at $\sim 140$ kpc and mean central strength of $9.5 \pm 1.0 \ \mu$G, provides the best fit to our data. The high central magnetic field lies at the upper end of the range observed in other systems and supports the possibility of an hadronic contribution to the diffuse radio emission previously detected at the cluster center.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Inferring the likely formation channel of giant exoplanets and brown dwarf companions from orbital and atmospheric observables remains a formidable challenge. Further and more precise directly measured dynamical masses of these companions are required to inform and gauge formation, evolutionary, and atmospheric models. We present an updated study of HIP 99770 b based on observations conducted with VLTI/GRAVITY. Aims: Combining the new data with previous observations from the literature, we characterise HIP 99770 b to better constrain its orbit, dynamical mass, and atmospheric properties, as well as to shed light on its likely formation channel. Methods: We ran a renewed orbit fit to further constrain the dynamical mass of the companion and the orbit solution. We also analysed the GRAVITY K-band spectrum, placing it into context with literature data, and extracting magnitude, age, spectral type, bulk properties and atmospheric characteristics of HIP 99770 b. Results: We detected the companion at a radial separation of $417\,\mathrm{mas}$ from its host. The new orbit fit yields a dynamical mass of $17_{-5}^{+6}\,\mathrm{M}_\mathrm{Jup}$ and an eccentricity of $0.31_{-0.12}^{+0.06}$. We also find that additional relative astrometry epochs in the future will not enable further constraints on the dynamical mass due to the dominating relative uncertainty on the Hipparcos-Gaia proper motion anomaly. The publication of Gaia DR4 will likely ease this predicament. We find that the companion is consistent with spectral type L8 and exhibits a potential metal enrichment in its atmosphere. Conclusions: These results do not yet allow for a definite inference of the companion's formation channel. Nevertheless, the new constraints on its bulk properties and the additional GRAVITY spectrum presented here will aid future efforts to determine the formation history of HIP 99770 b.
#### XRISM Observation of the Ophiuchus Galaxy Cluster: Quiescent Velocity Structure in the Dynamically Disturbed Core

 - **Abstract**
 We present the high-resolution X-ray spectroscopic observations of the Ophiuchus galaxy cluster core using the XRISM satellite. Despite previous observations revealing multiple cold fronts and dynamical disturbances in the cluster core, our XRISM observations show low gas velocity dispersions of \sigma_v = 115 +/- 7 km s^{-1} in the inner region (~< 25 kpc) and \sigma_v = 186 +/- 9 km s^{-1} in the outer region (~ 25-50 kpc). The gas temperatures are kT = 5.5 +/- 0.2 keV and 8.4 +/- 0.2 keV for the inner and outer regions, respectively, with metal abundances of Z = 0.75 +/- 0.03 Z_sun (inner) and 0.44 +/- 0.02 Z_sun (outer). The measured velocity dispersions correspond to nonthermal pressure fractions of only 1.4 +/- 0.2% (inner) and 2.5 +/- 0.2% (outer), indicating highly subsonic turbulence. Our analysis of the bulk gas motion indicates that the gas in the inner region is nearly at rest relative to the central galaxy (|v_bulk|=8 +/- 7 km s^{-1}), while the outer region exhibits a moderate motion of |v_bulk|=104 +/- 7 km s^{-1}. Assuming the velocity dispersion arises from turbulent motions, the turbulent heating rate is only ~ 40% of the radiative cooling rate, although there is some uncertainty. This suggests that the heating and cooling of the gas are not balanced. The activity of the central active galactic nucleus (AGN) has apparently weakened. The sloshing motion that created the cold fronts may now be approaching a turning point at which the velocity is minimum.
#### $\textit{Eppur Si Muove}$: Self-Sustained Streaming Motions in Multi-Phase MHD

 - **Abstract**
 Radiative cooling can drive dynamics in multi-phase gas. A dramatic example is hydrodynamic `shattering', the violent, pressure-driven fragmentation of a cooling cloud which falls drastically out of pressure balance with its surroundings. We run MHD simulations to understand how shattering is influenced by magnetic fields. In MHD, clouds do not `shatter' chaotically. Instead, after initial fragmentation, both hot and cold phases coherently `stream' in long-lived, field-aligned, self-sustaining gas flows, at high speed ($\sim 100 \, {\rm km \, s^{-1}}$). MHD thermal instability also produces such flows. They are due to the anisotropic nature of MHD pressure support, which only operates perpendicular to B-fields. Thus, even when $P_{\rm B} + P_{\rm gas} \approx$const, pressure balance only holds perpendicular to B-fields. Field-aligned gas pressure variations are unopposed, and results in gas velocities $v \sim (2 \Delta P/\rho)^{1/2}$ from Bernoulli's principle. Strikingly, gas in adjacent flux tubes $\textit{counter-stream}$ in opposite directions. We show this arises from a cooling-induced, MHD version of the thin shell instability. Magnetic tension is important both in enabling corrugational instability and modifying its non-linear evolution. Even in high $\beta$ hot gas, streaming can arise, since magnetic pressure support grows as gas cools and compresses. Thermal conduction increases the sizes and velocities of streaming cloudlets, but does not qualitatively modify dynamics. These results are relevant to the counter-streaming gas flows observed in solar coronal rain, as well as multi-phase gas cooling and condensation in the ISM, CGM and ICM.

 - **Abstract**
 Supermassive disks are outstanding galaxies whose formation and evolution are still poorly understood. They comprise a large variety of objects, ranging from large, low-surface-brightness galaxies, such as Malin 1, to the most spectacular superluminous spirals. However, we still do not know the physical mechanisms behind its formation, and whether they will be long-lived objects or whether their mass could destroy them in time. We aim to investigate the formation and evolution of these galaxies using the magnetohydrodynamical state-of-the-art simulation IllustrisTNG-100. We defined supermassive disks as galaxies with $\lambda / \sqrt{\varepsilon} \geq 0.31$ or 0.71, and with stellar mass log$_{10}M_\star/M_\odot > 10^{11}$. We studied the color, merging history, AGN history, and environment in which these galaxies reside. Supermassive disk galaxies typically experience a quiescent merging history, with $48\%$ experiencing no significant mergers at $z \leq 1$. Their stellar mass growth is driven mainly by star formation, unlike spheroidal galaxies, which require a significant number of mergers to form. Moreover, the mergers experienced by disk galaxies are generally rich in gas content, irrespective of whether they are minor or major events. Supermassive disks exist across various environments, from isolation to clusters, with $\sim 60\%$ inhabiting in isolation or low-mass groups, $\sim 25\%$ residing in massive groups, and $\sim15\%$ residing within galaxy clusters. When studying the evolution of supermassive disks selected at $z=0.5$, we show that when they gain sufficient mass, the probability of them maintaining their disk-like structure up to $z=0$ is relatively high ($\sim 60\%$). Lastly, while AGN significantly influences the regulation of star formation in galaxies, it does not directly alter their morphological structure.

 - **Abstract**
 We model the transport and spectral evolution of 1-100 GeV cosmic ray (CR) electrons (CREs) in TIGRESS MHD simulations of the magnetized, multiphase interstellar medium. We post-process a kpc-sized galactic disk patch representative of the solar neighborhood using a two-moment method for CR transport that includes advection, streaming, and diffusion. The diffusion coefficient is set by balancing wave growth via the CR streaming instability against wave damping (nonlinear Landau and ion-neutral collisions), depending on local gas and CR properties. Implemented energy loss mechanisms include synchrotron, inverse Compton, ionization, and bremsstrahlung. We evaluate CRE losses by different mechanisms as a function of energy and distance from the midplane, and compare loss timescales to transport and diffusion timescales. This comparison shows that CRE spectral steepening above p = 1 GeV/c is due to a combination of energy-dependent transport and losses. Our evolved CRE spectra are consistent with direct observations in the solar neighborhood, with a spectral index that steepens from an injected value of -2.3 to an energy dependent value between -2.7 and -3.3. We also show that the steepening is independent of the injection spectrum. Finally, we present potential applications of our models, including to the production of synthetic synchrotron emission. Our simulations demonstrate that the CRE spectral slope can be accurately recovered from pairs of radio observations in the range 1.5-45 GHz.
#### Study of the peculiar variable star Khavchenko 1

 - **Abstract**
 The work is devoted to the study of the peculiar variable star Khavchenko 1 in Auriga. It was discovered by the 7th grade student Sergey Khavchenko in 2020. The brightness of the star varies with an amplitude of about 0.4 magnitude and the period of 4.213 days. Initially the star could not have been attributed to any known type of variability. Its light curve looks like the upside-down light curve of the eclipsing binary similar to that of luminous red nova V1309 Scorpii a few years before the eruption. The analysis of the new data from the ZTF project gathered from 2020 till 2024 has shown the cyclic variations of the light curve amplitude. We have proposed several possible models of this system which can explain such an unusual behavior of this star. The continued observations of this star are necessary to reveal the period changes and to estimate the possible eruption date.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of an SX Phoenicis-type pulsating variable star via 217 epochs of time-series photometry from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Data Preview 1. The star, designated LSST-DP1-O- 614435753623041404 (or LSST-C25_var1 for short), has mean magnitudes of $(\langle g\rangle, \langle r\rangle) = (18.65, 18.63)$, with pulsation amplitudes of (0.60, 0.38)~mag in these bands. Its period is 0.0767 days (1.841 hours), typical of SX Phe pulsators. We derive a distance to the star of 16.6 kpc based on an SX Phe period-luminosity relation. Its position $\sim5$ kpc from the Galactic plane, in the outer Milky Way disk at a Galactocentric distance of $\sim22$ kpc, and its proper motion suggest that LSST-C25_var1 is part of the Monoceros Ring structure. This star is presented as a small taste of the many thousands of variable stars expected in Rubin/LSST data.
#### Magnetic field monitoring of four massive A-F supergiants

 - **Abstract**
 We report magnetic field measurements spanning about 15 years of four massive ($7.5-15 M_\odot$) supergiant stars: $\alpha$ Per (HD\,20902, F5Iab), $\alpha$ Lep (HD\,36673A, F0Ib), $\eta$ Leo (HD\,87737, A0Ib) and 13 Mon (HD\,46300, A1Ib). For each star, spectropolarimetric observations were collected using ESPaDOnS at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. The observed spectra were co-added, normalized, then processed using Least Squares Deconvolution (LSD) to yield mean Stokes $I$ and $V$ profiles. Each spectrum was analyzed to infer the False Alarm Probability of signal detection, and the longitudinal magnetic field was measured. This process yielded persistent detection of magnetic fields in all four stars. The median $1\sigma$ longitudinal field uncertainty of the Zeeman detections was 0.6~G. The maximum unsigned longitudinal magnetic fields measured from the detections are rather weak, ranging from $0.34\pm 0.19$ G for $\alpha$ Lep to $2.61\pm 0.55$ G for 13 Mon. The Zeeman signatures show different levels of complexity; those of the two hotter stars are relatively simple, while those of the two cooler stars are more complex. The stars also exhibited different levels of variability of their Zeeman signatures and longitudinal fields. We report periodic variability of the longitudinal field and (complex) Stokes $V$ profiles of $\alpha$ Per with a period of either 50.75 or 90 days. The (simple) Stokes $V$ profiles of 13~Mon, and probably those of $\eta$ Leo, show global polarity changes once during the period of observation, but the data are insufficient to place strong constraints on the variability timescales.
#### Exploring the probing power of gamma-Dor's inertial dip for core magnetism: case of a toroidal field

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-Dor stars are ideal targets for studies of stellar innermost dynamical properties due to their rich asteroseismic spectrum of gravity modes. Integrating internal magnetism to the picture appears as the next milestone of detailed asteroseismic studies, for its prime importance on stellar evolution. The inertial dip in prograde dipole modes period-spacing pattern of gamma-Dors stands out as a unique window on the convective core structure and dynamics. Recent studies have highlighted the dependence of the dip structure on core density stratification, contrast of the near-core Brunt-Väisälä frequency and rotation rate, as well as the core-to-near-core differential rotation. In the meantime, the effect of magnetism has been derived on envelope modes. We aim to revisit the inertial dip formation including core and envelope magnetism, and explore the probing power of this feature on dynamo-generated core fields. We consider a toroidal magnetic field with a bi-layer (core and envelope) Alfvén frequency. This configuration allows us to revisit the coupling problem using our knowledge on both core magneto-inertial modes and envelope magneto-gravito-inertial modes. We stay in an analytical framework to exhibit the magnetic effects on the inertial dip shape and location, setting up a laboratory towards the comprehension of magnetic effects on the dip structure. We show a shift of the inertial dip towards lower spin parameter values and a thinner dip with increasing core magnetic field, quite similar to the signature of differential rotation. The magnetic effects become sizeable when the ratio between the magnetic and the Coriolis effects is large enough. We explore the degeneracy of the magnetic effects with differential rotation. We study the detectability of core magnetism, considering observational constraints on the modes periods and potential gravito-inertial mode suppression.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the searches conducted with the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) in response to S250206dm, a bona fide event with a false alarm rate of one in 25 years, detected by the International Gravitational Wave Network (IGWN). Although the event is significant, the nature of the compact objects involved remains unclear, with at least one likely neutron star. ZTF covered 68% of the localization region, though we did not identify any likely optical counterpart. We describe the ZTF strategy, potential candidates, and the observations that helped rule out candidates, including sources circulated by other collaborations. Similar to Ahumada et al. 2024, we perform a frequentist analysis, using simsurvey, as well as Bayesian analysis, using nimbus, to quantify the efficiency of our searches. We find that, given the nominal distance to this event of 373$\pm$104 Mpc, our efficiencies are above 10% for KNe brighter than $-17.5$ absolute magnitude. Assuming the optical counterpart known as kilonova (KN) lies within the ZTF footprint, our limits constrain the brightest end of the KN parameter space. Through dedicated radiative transfer simulations of KNe from binary neutron star (BNS) and black hole-neutron star (BHNS) mergers, we exclude parts of the BNS KN parameter space. Up to 35% of the models with high wind ejecta mass ($M_{\rm wind} \approx 0.13$ M$_{\odot}$) are ruled out when viewed face-on ($\cos\theta_{\rm obs} = 1.0$). Finally, we present a joint analysis using the combined coverage from ZTF and the Gravitational Wave Multimessenger Dark Energy Camera Survey (GW-MMADS). The joint observations cover 73% of the localization region, and the combined efficiency has a stronger impact on rising and slowly fading models, allowing us to rule out 55% of the high-mass KN models viewed face-on.

 - **Abstract**
 The in-flight instrumental background of the Follow-up X-ray Telescope (FXT) onboard Einstein Probe (EP) mission is analysed in this work by utilizing observations collected during Performance Verification phase and subsequent dedicated filter wheel closed observations. The instrumental backgrounds of the two FXT modules are consistent with each other, with an average rate of $\sim 4\times10^{-2}$\,counts/s/keV at 0.5--10\,keV for each module. The background is nearly uniformly distributed across the detector pixels, with a minor increase ($<8\%$) observed along rows. The spatial distribution shows significant modulation by the geomagnetic field. The spectral shapes remain unchanged in 0.5--10\,keV at different rates. The long-term temporal variation indicates a periodic change associated with the orbital precession ($\sim 57$ days). The innovative design of FXT full-frame readout mode enables simultaneous recording of events in both the imaging area (IMG) and the frame store area (FSA) of the pnCCD. FSA event rates show a strong linear correlation with the IMG, based on which the IMG instrumental background modelling is established.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we observe the nearby pulsar, PSR B1929$+$10, using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). We find, for the first time, two new emission components with an extremely weak observed flux density of about $10^{-4}$ of the magnitude of the peak radio emission of PSR B1929$+$10. Our results show that the intrinsic radio emission of PSR B1929$+$10 covers the $360^{\circ}$ of longitude, demonstrating that this pulsar is a whole $360^{\circ}$ of longitude emission pulsar. We find at least 15 components of pulse emission in the average pulse profile. Additionally, we identify 5 modes of subpulse modulation in different emission regions, which differ from the pulse components. Moreover, the narrowband emission feature and the frequent jumps in the observed linear polarization position angle (PPA) are also detected in the single pulse of this pulsar. To understand the magnetosphere of this pulsar, we analyze the observed PPA variations across the whole $360^{\circ}$ of longitude and fit them using the classical rotating vector model (RVM). For the best-fit model, the inclination angle,$\alpha$, and the impact angle, $\beta$, of this pulsar are $55^{\circ}.56$ and $53^{\circ}.47$, respectively. Using the rotating magnetosphere approximation of the magnetic dipole field, we investigate the three-dimensional pulsar magnetosphere and the sparking pattern on the polar cap surface. Our analysis indicates that the extremely narrow zone of the polar cap, which is associated with a high-altitude magnetospheric region, is responsible for the weak emission window. This pulsar has extremely high-altitude magnetospheric radio emissions.

 - **Abstract**
 One important question in active galactic nucleus (AGN) is how gas is brought down to the galaxy center. Both internal secular evolution (torque induced by non-axisymmetric galactic structures such as bars) and external processes (e.g. mergers or interactions) are expected to redistribute the angular momentum (AM) and transport gas inward. However, it is still under debate whether these processes can significantly affect AGN activities. Here we for the first time report that AGN fraction increases with the difference of kinematic position angles ($\Delta PA\equiv|PA_{\mathrm{gas}}-PA_{\mathrm{star}}|$) between ionized gas ($PA_{\mathrm{gas}}$) and stellar disks ($PA_{\mathrm{star}}$) in blue and green galaxies, meanwhile this fraction remains roughly constant for red galaxies. Also the high luminosity AGN fraction increases with $\Delta PA$ while the low luminosity AGN fraction is independent with $\Delta PA$. These observational results support a scenario in which the interaction between accreted and pre-existing gas provides the AM loss mechanism, thereby the gas inflow fuels the central BH activities, and the AM loss efficiency is positively correlated with the $\Delta PA$.

 Mean-field dynamo theory, describing the evolution of large-scale magnetic fields, has been the mainstay of theoretical interpretation of magnetism in astrophysical objects such as the Sun for several decades. More recently, three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations have reached a level of fidelity where they capture dynamo action self-consistently on local and global scales without resorting to parametrization of unresolved scales. Recent global simulations also capture many of the observed characteristics of solar and stellar large-scale magnetic fields and cycles. Successful explanation of the results of such simulations with corresponding mean-field models is a crucial validation step for mean-field dynamo theory. Here the connections between mean-field theory and current dynamo simulations are reviewed. These connections range from the numerical computation of turbulent transport coefficients to mean-field models of simulations, and their relevance to the solar dynamo. Finally, the most notable successes and current challenges in mean-field theoretical interpretations of simulations are summarized.

 - **Abstract**
 Our aim is to characterize the effects of the local magnetic fields in quiet regions of stellar atmospheres. We compute magneto-hydrodynamic and purely hydrodynamic simulations of G2V, K0V and M2V star. The magnetic simulations are started from the hydrodynamical ones, adding the Biermann battery term in the induction equation to produce a magnetic seed, that is enhanced by the action of the small-scale dynamo. Once the magnetic field is saturated, we compare the simulations with and without magnetic fields and characterize the differences in statistics of velocities, appearance of granulation, and the mean stratification of a number of relevant parameters. These differences are also compared with the deviations produced by different treatments of the opacity in the simulations. The saturation values of the magnetic fields are $\sim 100$ G for the three stars in their surface, consistent with the recent results for cool stars, and other results for the Sun in the literature. The local magnetic fields have a negligible effect on the velocities of the plasma or the mean stratifications of the simulated stars. In contrast, they produce changes in the bolometric intensity of the intergranular lanes and the power spectrum at small scales of the temperature and vertical velocity of downflows. Significant differences between the hydrodynamic and magneto-hydrodynamic simulations are also found for the kinetic energy. This difference in energy can be explained by the transformation of kinetic into magnetic energy, which is consistent with the action of the small-scale dynamo.

 - **Abstract**
 This study presents new, high-quality, optical photometric observations of three W UMa type contact binaries. The analysis of the corresponding light curves is made using Djurasevic's inverse problem method. To explain the light curve asymmetries and variations, we used the Roche model that involved regions containing spots on the components. The fundamental parameters of these systems were derived, including the mass ratios determined using the q-search method. Hypotheses involving active surface regions, such as dark spots on the primary and secondary components, or bright spots in the neck region due to magnetic activity or continuous mass transfer between components, were examined to explain the varying amplitudes of maxima and nearly equal minima depths in the light curves. Using the derived orbital and physical parameters, three-dimensional models were constructed for various orbital phases.

 - **Abstract**
 In the past decade, hundreds of exoplanets have been discovered in extremely short orbits below 10 days. Unlike in the Solar System, planets in these systems orbit their host stars close enough to disturb the stellar magnetic field lines. The interaction can enhance the star's magnetic activity, such as its chromospheric and radio emission, or flaring. So far, the search for magnetic star-planet interactions has remained inconclusive. Here, we report the first detection of planet-induced flares on HIP 67522, a 17 million-year-old G dwarf star with two known close-in planets. Combining space-borne photometry from TESS and dedicated CHEOPS observations over a span of 5 years, we find that the 15 flares in HIP 67522 cluster near the innermost planet's transit phase, indicating persistent magnetic star-planet interaction in the system. The stability of interaction implies that the innermost planet is continuously self-inflicting a six time higher flare rate than it would experience without interaction. The subsequent flux of energetic radiation and particles bombarding HIP 67522 b may explain the planet's remarkably extended atmosphere, recently detected with the James Webb Space Telescope. HIP 67522 is therefore an archetype to understand the impact of magnetic star-planet interaction on the atmospheres of nascent exoplanets.
#### Searching for planet-induced radio signal from the young close-in planet host star HIP 67522

 - **Abstract**
 HIP 67522 is a 17 Myr old 1.2$M_\odot$ dwarf, and the only such young star known to host two close-in gas giant planets. The inner planet likely orbits close enough to its host to power magnetic star-planet interactions. In the radio domain, magnetic star-planet interaction is expected to produce a unique signature: electron cyclotron maser emission (ECME), beamed in phase with the orbit of the close-in planet. We conducted the longest radio monitoring campaign of a G dwarf host star to date to search for ECME, totaling $135\,$h on HIP 67522 over a period of five months with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) between $1.1-3.1$GHz. We find that HIP 67522 is active in the radio, with emission that varies stochastically, with a duty cycle of $69\%$ above $0.24$mJy, and frequent bursts. Both the bursts and the quiescent emission are consistent with the canonical Güdel-Benz relation, and show a positive spectral index and brightness temperatures $\geq 10^{10}$K, indicating likely a flaring origin. Our observations cover $61\%$ of the innermost planet's orbit, including multiple visits of the quadrature where planet-induced ECME detection is most likely for this system. However, no orbital modulation or persistent polarization of the radio emission was detected. Our upper limit on circularly polarized emission from HIP 67522 suggests a $<0.7\%$ conversion efficiency of the magnetic power generated in the star-planet interaction into radio waves, unless the emission was missed by our phase or frequency coverage, or was absorbed in the circumstellar plasma. HIP 67522 is a system with one of the highest expected powers of star-planet interaction among known systems and shows strong indication of planet-induced flaring, motivating observations at other wavelengths to probe for further dissipation pathways.

 - **Abstract**
 Star cluster formation and assembly occurs inside filamentary and turbulent molecular clouds, which imprints both spatial and kinematic substructure on the young cluster. In this paper, we quantify the amount and evolution of this substructure in simulations of star cluster formation that include radiation magnetohydrodynamical evolution of the gas, coupled with detailed stellar dynamics, binary formation and evolution, and stellar feedback. We find that both spatial and kinematic substructure are present at early times. Both are erased as the cluster assembles through the formation of new stars as well as the merger of sub-clusters. Spatial substructure is erased over a timescale of approximately 2.5 times the initial free-fall time of the cloud. Kinematic substructure persists for longer, and is still present to the end of our simulations. We also explored our simulations for evidence of early dynamical mass segregation, and conclude that the presence of a population of binary stars can accelerate and enhance the mass segregation process.

 - **Abstract**
 The existence of billion-solar-mass quasars at redshifts $z \gtrsim 7$ poses a formidable challenge to theories of black hole formation, requiring pathways for the rapid growth of massive seeds. Population III.1 stars, forming in pristine, dense dark matter (DM) minihalos, are compelling progenitors. This study presents a suite of stellar evolution models for accreting Pop III.1 protostars, calculated with the \textsc{GENEC} code. We systematically explore a wide parameter space, spanning ambient WIMP densities of $\rho_\chi \sim 10^{12}\mbox{-}10^{16}\,\mathrm{GeV\,cm^{-3}}$ and gas accretion rates of $10^{-3}\mbox{-}10^{-1}\,M_\odot\,\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$, to quantify the effects of DM annihilation. A central finding is that for a protostar to grow to supermassive scales ($\gtrsim 10^5 \, M_{\odot}$), the ambient DM density in the immediate vicinity of the star must exceed a critical threshold of $\rho_{\chi} \gtrsim 5 \times 10^{14} \, \text{GeV cm}^{-3}$. The energy injected by WIMP annihilation inflates the protostar, lowering its surface temperature, which suppresses the ionizing feedback that would otherwise halt accretion and significantly delays the onset of hydrogen fusion. This heating also governs the star's final fate: in dense halos ($\rho_\chi \gtrsim 10^{15}\,\mathrm{GeV\,cm^{-3}}$), stars remain stable against general relativistic instability beyond $10^6 \, M_{\odot}$, whereas at lower densities ($\rho_\chi \lesssim 10^{13}\,\mathrm{GeV\,cm^{-3}}$), they collapse at masses of $\sim 5 \times 10^5 \, M_{\odot}$. Once the DM fuel is exhausted and core burning commences, the protostar contracts and its ionising photon output can reach very high levels $\sim 10^{53} s^{-1}$. These distinct evolutionary phases offer clear observational signatures for the JWST, providing a robust, physically-grounded pathway for forming heavy black hole seeds in the early universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), the brightest electromagnetic bursts in the universe, are believed to originate from ultra-relativistic jets launched by the rapidly rotating central engine, either a disk-surrounded newly formed black hole (BH) or a magnetar. Such a central engine potentially possesses rapidly evolving physical characteristics, as it is just born. The caught of time-increasing frequency in the gravitational wave signals is the evidence of upon opinion. Here we report a possible oscillatory signal identified in GRB 131122B with periods increasing from 1.27 seconds to 4.02 seconds in a time interval of 16.75 seconds. Such a peculiar oscillation signal has not been identified in GRBs before and its periodic evolution could also be the quickest one found in the electromagnetic radiation window of astrophysics. The precession of a misaligned accretion disk caused by the tidal disruption of a star by an intermediate-mass BH may be responsible for this signal. This finding could open a new window to reveal the nature of the hiding central engine of GRBs.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we perform reconstruction of \( f(Q) \) gravity inspired by the New Agegraphic Dark Energy (NADE) model, aiming to account for the Universe's late time acceleration without invoking a cosmological constant. Utilizing a power law scale factor \( a(t) = a_0 t^h \), we derive an analytic form for \( f(Q) \) based on a correspondence with NADE, where the conformal time serves as the infrared cutoff. The resulting model naturally recovers General Relativity in the limit and exhibits a geometrically motivated dark energy component. We constrain the model parameters using recent Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data from DESI DR2 BAO and previous BAO observations through the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis. The reconstructed Hubble parameter \( H(z) \) demonstrates excellent agreement with observational data, achieving high \( R^2 \) values and low \(\chi^2_{\min}\), AIC, and BIC scores, outperforming the standard \( \Lambda \)CDM model. Further, we investigate the cosmological evolution using the deceleration parameter \( q(z) \), effective equation of state \( \omega_{\mathrm{eff}}(z) \), and Om diagnostics. The model exhibits a clear transition from deceleration to acceleration with a present value \( q(0) \in \left[-0.5879, -0.3333\right] \) and transition redshift $z_{\mathrm{tr}} \sim 0.5209-0.8126$, while maintaining \( -1 < \omega_{\mathrm{eff}}(z) < -1/3 \), indicating quintessence like behavior. Om diagnostics consistently show a negative slope, further confirming deviation from \( \Lambda \)CDM. Energy condition analysis reveals that WEC, DEC, and NEC are satisfied, while SEC is violated only at low redshifts which is consistent with cosmic acceleration. Overall, the reconstructed \( f(Q) \) model provides a viable, observationally consistent, and theoretically motivated alternative to standard dark energy scenarios.
#### The impact of differential rotation on the stochastic excitation of acoustic modes in solar-like pulsators

 - **Abstract**
 Acoustic modes are excited by turbulent convection in the outer convective envelope of solar-like stars. Observational results from asteroseismic studies show that 44% of solar-like stars do not present detectable stochastically-excited acoustic modes. This phenomenon appears to be related to their rotation rate and magnetic activity. In a first paper, we showed that uniform rotation tends to diminish the mode amplitudes significantly. However, convective envelopes in solar-type stars are differentially rotating: the rotation rate difference between mid-latitudes and the equator can go up to 60%, as shown by recent asteroseismic works. In this paper, we examine the impact of differential rotation on the stochastic excitation of acoustic modes in solar-like stars. We provide theoretical predictions for the excitation of acoustic modes in a differentially rotating solar-like star. We use the Rotating Mixing-Length Theory approach to model the local influence of differential rotation on convection. We then estimate the resulting impact on power injection by turbulent convection into oscillation modes numerically, using a combination of the MESA stellar structure and evolution code and GYRE stellar pulsation code. We show that the power injected in acoustic modes differs by up to 30 % for stars with the same mean rotation rate $5 \Omega_{\odot}$ but a distinct differential rotation rate. The excitation of axisymmetric acoustic modes is further inhibited in the anti-solar differential rotation regime where the pole of stars rotates faster than their equator when compared to the uniform rotation case. This could hinder mode detection in such configurations. This study permits a first prediction of the excitation of acoustic modes as a function of the differential rotation in solar-like pulsators.

 - **Abstract**
 The particle acceleration and transport process during solar eruptions is one of the critical and long-standing problems in space plasma physics. Through decades of research, it is well accepted that particles with higher energies released during a solar eruption arrive at observers earlier than the particles with lower energies, forming a well-known structure in the dynamic energy spectrum called particle velocity dispersion (VD), as frequently observed by space missions. However, this picture is challenged by new observations from NASA's Parker Solar Probe and ESA's Solar Orbiter which show an unexpected inverse velocity dispersion (IVD) phenomenon, where particles with higher-energies arrive later at the observer. Facing on the challenge, we here report the recent discovery of such IVD structures with 10 solar energetic proton events observed by Solar Orbiter, and then analyze the mechanisms causing this unusual phenomenon. We suggest that shock diffusive acceleration, with respect to magnetic reconnection, is probably a dominant mechanism to accelerate protons to tens of MeV in such events where particles need longer time to reach higher energies. And we determine, innovatively, the physical conditions and time scales during the actual shock acceleration process that cannot be observed directly.

 - **Abstract**
 The T and Y spectral classes represent the coolest and lowest-mass population of brown dwarfs, yet their census remains incomplete due to limited statistics. Existing detection frameworks are often constrained to identifying M, L, and early T dwarfs, owing to the sparse observational sample of ultracool dwarfs (UCDs) at later types. This paper presents a novel machine learning framework capable of detecting and classifying late-T and Y dwarfs, trained entirely on synthetic photometry from atmospheric models. Utilizing grids from the ATMO 2020 and Sonora Bobcat models, I produce a training dataset over two orders of magnitude larger than any empirical set of >T6 UCDs. Polynomial color relations fitted to the model photometry are used to assign spectral types to these synthetic models, which in turn train an ensemble of classifiers to identify and classify the spectral type of late UCDs. The model is highly performant when validating on both synthetic and empirical datasets, verifying catalogs of known UCDs with object classification metrics >99% and an average spectral type precision within 0.35 +/- 0.37 subtypes. Application of the model to a 1.5 degree region around Pisces and the UKIDSS UDS field results in the discovery of one previously uncatalogued T8.2 candidate, demonstrating the ability of this model-trained approach in discovering faint, late-type UCDs from photometric catalogs.

 - **Abstract**
 This work is dedicated to the discovery of the eclipsing variable star Grigoriev 1 and determining the parameters of its binary system. The star was found through the systematic checking of ultraviolet sources of GALEX space observatory in Pegasus constellation. Analysis of the ZTF project data has shown the presence of eclipses with two magnitudes depth and a period of 6.5997 days. The duration of eclipse covers only 1% of the orbital period, and the partial phases are at least 30 times shorter. Those parameters imply that the star is a detached binary system with a white dwarf seen edge-on. The new object was added to the International Variable Star Index AAVSO VSX as Grigoriev 1. Over the 10 million objects in VSX database there are only 188 variable stars of EA/WD type. Grigoriev 1 has the longest orbital period out of those. Moreover, its absolute magnitude M at maximum light from Gaia space observatory data is about +6.8. On the color-luminosity diagram it occupies the intermediate position between hot subdwarfs and white dwarfs which makes it even more interesting and worth studying at professional telescopes.

 - **Abstract**
 The population of bright galaxies at $z\gtrsim10$ discovered by JWST, including the so-called "blue monsters", has been difficult to reconcile with standard galaxy evolution models. To shed light on this extraordinary population, we study the $z\sim8$ galaxies discovered by the BoRG-$JWST$ survey. These slightly-lower redshift analogs are comparable in UV luminosity to the blue monsters, and their lower redshift makes it much easier to access key rest frame optical diagnostics with NIRspec. We find that BoRG-$JWST$ galaxies are consistent with being dust-poor based on their blue UV slopes and Balmer decrement ratios. We find no strong evidence for dominant active galactic nuclei contribution to the UV brightness, based on line-ratio diagnostics, though some contribution cannot be excluded. We further infer the stellar mass, star formation and UV-brightness history of the BoRG-$JWST$ galaxies by fitting their rest-frame UV-optical spectra. We see evidence for stochastic episodes of star formation for all the BoRG-$JWST$ galaxies, providing a temporal boosting of UV luminosity in short timescales. The UV-bright blue monsters at $z\gtrsim10$ can be explained by the presence of stars with ages below 100 Myr.
