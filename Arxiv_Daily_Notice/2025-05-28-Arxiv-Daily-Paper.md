 - **Abstract**
 The Solar Maximum Mission of NASA was one of the first satellites with on board digitization of observations. It was launched for the solar maximum of cycle 21 (1980) in order to study the solar activity. It carried many instruments, such as coronagraphs, X and $\gamma$ ray detectors, an Ultra Violet spectrometer and a radiometer. Ground based support was offered by many institutes, such as Paris Meudon observatory under the form of systematic observations or coordinated campaigns with specific instruments. We present here the Meudon Solar Tower (MST) and magnetograph which offered in the eighties a major contribution with observations of velocity and magnetic fields of the photosphere and chromosphere, while SMM was observing the transition region and corona above.

 - **Abstract**
 The formation of stars is governed by the intricate interplay of nonideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effects, gravity, and turbulence. Computational challenges have hindered a comprehensive 3D exploration of this interplay, posing a longstanding challenge in our understanding of clouds and cores. Our objective was to study the spatial features and time evolution of the neutral-ion drift velocity and the mass-to-flux ratio in a 3D nonideal MHD chemo-dynamical simulation of a supercritical turbulent collapsing molecular cloud. The resistivities of the cloud were computed self-consistently from a vast non-equilibrium chemical network containing 115 species. To compute the resistivities we used different mean collisional rates for each charged species in our network. We additionally developed a new generalized method for measuring the true mass-to-flux ratio in 3D simulations. Despite the cloud's turbulent nature, at early times, the neutral-ion drift velocity follows the expected structure from 2D axisymmetric non-ideal MHD simulations with an hourglass magnetic field. At later times, however, the neutral-ion drift velocity becomes increasingly complex, with many vectors pointing outward from the cloud's center. Specifically, we find that the drift velocity above and below the cloud's ``midplane'' is in ``antiphase''. We explain these features on the basis of magnetic helical loops and the correlation of the drift velocity with the magnetic tension force per unit volume. Despite the complex structure of the neutral-ion drift velocity, we demonstrate that, when averaged over a region, the true mass-to-flux ratio monotonically increases as a function of time and decreases as a function of the radius from the center of the cloud. In contrast, the ``observed'' mass-to-flux ratio shows poor correlation with the true mass-to-flux ratio and the density structure of the cloud.
#### Exploring the interplay of dust and gas phases in DustPedia star-forming galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 Molecular gas is the key ingredient of the star formation cycle, and tracing its dependencies on other galaxy properties is essential for understanding galaxy evolution. In this work, we explore the relation between the different phases of the interstellar medium (ISM), namely molecular gas, atomic gas, and dust, and galaxy properties using a sample of nearby late-type galaxies. To this goal, we collect CO maps for 121 galaxies from the DustPedia project, ensuring an accurate determination of $M_{H2}$, the global molecular gas mass. We investigate which scaling relations provide the best description of $M_{H2}$, based on the strength of the correlation and its intrinsic dispersion. Commonly used correlations between $M_{H2}$ and star formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass ($M_{\star}$) are affected by large scatter, which accounts for galaxies that are experiencing quenching of their star formation activity. This issue can be partially mitigated by considering a "fundamental plane" of star formation, fitting together $M_{H2}$, $M_{\star}$, and SFR. We confirm previous results from the DustPedia collaboration that the total gas mass has the tightest connection with the dust mass and that the molecular component also establishes a good correlation with dust. Although dust grains are necessary for the formation of hydrogen molecules, the strength of gravitational potential driven by the stellar component plays a key role in driving density enhancements and the atomic-to-molecular phase transition. Eventually, we investigated the correlations between ISM components and monochromatic luminosities at different wavelengths: we proposed mid and far-IR luminosities as reliable proxies of $L^{\prime}_{CO}$ for sources lacking dedicated millimeter observations. Luminosities in mid-IR photometric bands collecting PAH emission can be used to trace molecular gas and dust masses.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a spectroscopic sample of 23 broad-line AGNs (BLAGNs) at $3\lesssim z\lesssim 6$ selected using F322W2+F444W NIRCam/WFSS grism spectroscopy of the central 100 ${\rm arcmin^2}$ area of the NEXUS survey. Among these BLAGNs, 15 are classified as Little Red Dots (LRDs) based on their rest-frame UV-optical spectral slopes and compact morphology. The number density of LRDs is $\sim 10^{-5}\,{\rm cMpc^{-3}}$, with a hint of declining towards the lower end of the probed redshift range. These BLAGNs and LRDs span broad H$\alpha$ luminosities of $\sim 10^{42.2}-10^{43.7}\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$, black hole masses of $\sim 10^{6.3}-10^{8.4}\,M_\odot$, and Eddington ratios of $\sim 0.1-1$ (median value 0.4), though the black hole mass and Eddington ratio estimates carry large systematic uncertainties. Half of the LRDs show strong Balmer absorption, suggesting high-density gas surrounding the line-emitting region. We detect extended (hundreds of parsec) rest-frame UV-optical emission from the host galaxy in the majority of these LRDs, which contributes significantly or even dominantly to their total UV emission. This host emission largely accounts for the peculiar UV upturn of the LRD spectral energy distribution. We also measure the small-scale ($\lesssim 1\,{\rm cMpc}$) clustering of these BLAGNs and LRDs by cross-correlating with a photometric galaxy sample. Extrapolating the power-law two-point correlation function model to large linear scales, we infer a linear bias of $3.30_{-2.04}^{+2.88}$ and typical halo masses of a few $\times 10^{11}\,h^{-1}M_\odot$ for BLAGNs at the sample median redshift of $z\sim 4.5$. However, the inferred linear bias and halo masses of LRDs, while formally consistent with those for BLAGNs at $\sim 1.5\sigma$, appear too large to be compatible with their space density, suggesting LRDs may have strong excess clustering on small scales.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first joint analysis of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) effect with galaxy-galaxy lensing (GGL) for CMASS galaxies in the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). We show these complementary probes can disentangle baryons from dark matter in the outskirts of galactic halos by alleviating model degeneracies that are present when fitting to kSZ or GGL measurements alone. In our joint kSZ+GGL analysis we show that the baryon density profile is well constrained on scales from 0.3 to 50 Mpc/$h$. With our well constrained profile of the baryon density, we provide direct comparisons to simulations. For our model we find an outer slope of the baryon distribution that is shallower than predicted by some hydrodynamical simulations, consistent with enhanced baryonic feedback. We also show that not including baryons in a model for GGL can bias halo mass estimates low by $\sim 20\%$ compared to a model that includes baryons and is jointly fit to kSZ+GGL measurements. Our modelling code galaxy-galaxy lensing and kSZ (\texttt{glasz}) is publicly available at this https URL.
#### Burned to ashes: How the thermal decomposition of refractory organics in the inner protoplanetary disc impacts the gas-phase C/O ratio

 - **Abstract**
 The largest reservoir of carbon in protoplanetary discs is stored in refractory organics, which thermally decompose into the gas-phase at the organics line, well interior to the water iceline. Because this region is so close to the host star, it is often assumed that the released gaseous material is rapidly accreted and plays little role in the evolution of the disc composition. However, laboratory experiments show that the thermal decomposition process is irreversible, breaking macromolecular refractory organics into simpler, volatile carbon-bearing compounds. As a result, unlike the iceline of other volatiles, which traps vapor inwards due to recondensation, the organics line remains permeable, allowing gaseous carbon to diffuse outward without returning to the solid phase. In this paper, we investigate how this process affects the disc composition, particularly the gas-phase C/H and C/O ratios, by incorporating it into a 1D evolution model for gas and solids, and assuming refractory organics dominantly decompose into C$_2$H$_2$. Our results show that this process allows this carbon-rich gas to survive well beyond the organics line (out to $7 \mathrm{~au}$ around a solar-mass star) and for much longer timescales, such that its abundance is increased by an order of magnitude. This has several implications in planet formation, notably by altering how the composition of solids and gas relate, and the fraction of heavy elements available to giant planets. In the framework of our model, refractory organics significantly influence the evolution of the gas-phase C/O ratio, which may help interpreting measurements made with Spitzer and JWST.
#### The Properties of Little Red Dot Galaxies in the ASTRID Simulation

 - **Abstract**
 We present simulated counterparts of the ``Little Red Dot'' (LRD) galaxies observed with JWST, using the large cosmological hydrodynamic simulation, ASTRID. We create mock observations of the galaxies ($5 \leq z \leq 8$) in ASTRID, and find seventeen which fit the color and size criteria of LRDs. These LRDs are galaxies with high stellar masses ($\rm log(M_*/M_{\odot}) \geq 9.7$), and massive black holes ($\rm log(M_{BH}/M_{\odot}) \geq 6.8$). The host galaxies are dense, with stellar half mass radii ($\rm 325\,pc \leq r_{{\rm half},*} \leq 620\,pc$), and dust attenuation in the F444W band above 1.25. Their star formation has been recently quenched. They host relatively bright AGN that are dust-obscured and contribute significantly to the rest-frame optical red slope and have relatively low luminosity in the rest-frame ultraviolet, where the host galaxy's stars are more dominant. These LRDs are in an evolutionary phase of miniquenching that is the result of AGN feedback from their massive black holes. The LRDs in ASTRID are bright with F444W magnitudes of $23.5-25.5$. The less massive and fainter galaxies in ASTRID lack the dust concentration necessary to produce the red slope of an LRD, though this could be an effect of limited resolution. Most of the highest Eddington black holes are not LRDs due to their host galaxies having typical dust levels and relatively high star formation rates accompanying their highly accreting black holes, resulting in their spectra being too flat.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of the hard X-ray emission from the central region of Abell 3667 using deep NuSTAR observations. While previous studies on the nature of the hard X-ray excess have been controversial, our analysis of the central region suggests that the excess is primarily thermal, best described by a two-temperature (2T) model, with the high-temperature component likely arising from merger-induced heating. This interpretation contrasts with some earlier suggestions of non-thermal emission due to inverse Compton scattering of relativistic electrons. Additionally, we set a lower limit on the magnetic field strength of $\sim 0.2 \, \mu$G in the central region, consistent with values found in other dynamically active clusters and compatible with those inferred from equipartition and Faraday rotation measurements. Since our study is focused on the central region of the cluster, further high-resolution observations of the outer regions will be critical to fully disentangle the thermal and non-thermal contributions to the X-ray.

 - **Abstract**
 The highly elliptical polar orbit of the Juno mission provides a unique opportunity to simultaneously measure the compression state of Jupiter's magnetosphere and the total power emitted by the planet's ultraviolet aurora, using a single spacecraft. This allows us to study how Jupiter's aurora respond to a compression event. In this paper, we present a case study of an extreme compression event that occurred on December 6-7 2022 when Juno was a distance of 70 R$_{J}$ from Jupiter. This extreme compression was accompanied by a very large increase in the ultraviolet auroral emissions to 12 TW, a factor of six higher than the baseline level. This event coincided with the predicted arrival of a powerful interplanetary shock, which was expected to cause the largest increase in the solar wind dynamic pressure seen thus far during the Juno mission. The simultaneous occurrence of the interplanetary shock, the extreme compression and the bright ultraviolet aurora suggests that in this case, the auroral brightening was caused by the solar wind shock compressing the magnetosphere.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the diverse formation and migration pathways that shape exoplanetary systems requires characterizing both their atmospheric properties and their orbital dynamics. A key dynamical diagnostic is the projected spin-orbit angle - the alignment between the stellar spin and the planetary orbit-which provides crucial tests for theoretical models. This angle can be determined using the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. Although measurements exist for over 200 planets, the overall distribution of these angles is not fully understood, motivating further observations across the full parameter space. We analyze archival HARPS and HARPS-N spectroscopic transit time series of nine gas giant exoplanets on short orbits and one brown dwarf. We derive their projected spin-orbit angle $\lambda$. We find aligned projected orbits for all nine gas giants as well as the brown dwarf. Furthermore, we are able to derive the true spin-orbit angle for the brown dwarf EPIC 219388192b, $\psi = $25$^{+11}_{-14}$ deg. These projected prograde orbits are consistent with quiet disc migration disfavoring violent events exciting the orbits in the history of these systems. Finally, we investigate the current overlap between spin-orbit angle measurements and atmospheric characterization targets. While we find no strong observational biases due to the spin-orbit angle, we note that the majority of planets with atmospheric data still lack spin-orbit measurements. This incompleteness of the dynamical information may limit the interpretation of upcoming atmospheric surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 The relative abundances of exotic environments provides us with (uninformed) bounds on the habitability of those environments relative to our own, on the basis that our presence here is not too atypical. For instance, since red stars outnumber yellow stars 7 to 3, we can infer that red stars must be less than 8.1 times as habitable as yellow, as otherwise our presence around a yellow star would be a statistical outlier at the level of $5\%$. In the multiverse context, the relative abundances of exotic environments can be drastically different from those in our universe, which sometimes allows us to place much stronger bounds on their relative habitability than we would get by restricting our attention to our universe. We apply this reasoning to a variety of different exotic environments: tidally locked planets, binary star systems, icy moons, rogue planets, liquids with properties different from water, and waterworlds. We find that the bounds on the relative habitability of rogue planets and waterworlds are at least an order of magnitude stronger in a multiverse context than from our universe alone. Additionally, the belief that some of water's special properties are essential for life, such as the fact that ice floats and, with some caveats, that it acts as a universal solvent, are incompatible with the multiverse hypothesis. If any of these bounds are found to be violated in the future, the multiverse hypothesis can be falsified to a high degree of confidence.

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of helium escaping the atmosphere of exoplanets has revolutionized our understanding of atmospheric escape and exoplanetary evolution. Using high-precision spectroscopic observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRISS-SOSS mode, we report the detection of significant helium absorption during the pre-transit phase of WASP-107b (17$\sigma$), as well as in the transit and post-transit phases. This unique continuous helium absorption begins approximately 1.5 hours before the planet's ingress and reveals the presence of an extended thermosphere. The observations show a maximum transit depth of 2.395$\% \pm$ 0.01$\%$ near the helium triplet (36$\sigma$; at NIRISS-SOSS resolution $\sim$ 700). Our ellipsoidal model of the planetary thermosphere matches well the measured light curve suggesting an outflow extending to tens of planetary radii. Furthermore, we confidently detect water absorption (log10 H2O=-2.5 $\pm$ 0.6), superimposed with a short-wavelength slope which we attribute to a prominent signature from unocculted stellar spots (5.2$\sigma$), rather than a small-particle haze slope. We place an upper limit on the abundance of K (log10 K$<$-4.86, or K/H$<$ 75$\times$ stellar) at 2$\sigma$, which is consistent with the O/H super-solar metallicity estimate. This study underscores the transformative potential of JWST for tracing atmospheric and mass-loss processes, while offering a benchmark for future studies targeting helium escape and its implications for planetary evolution.
#### Mapping the Star Formation and HI Gas Properties of Galaxies Along Large-scale Structures Around the Virgo Cluster

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the star formation and neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) gas properties of galaxies along three large-scale filaments and two galaxy groups in the wide field around the Virgo cluster. Our goal is to understand how galaxies are processed in low-density environments before falling into high-density regions. Combining the spatial distribution of galaxies with multiwavelength colors such as W3-W1, NUV-r, and g-r, we find a predominance of blue galaxies across the structures, indicating normal-to-enhanced star formation, similar to that of isolated galaxies. However, one filament and one group show a significant number of red galaxies (32% and 20%, respectively), suggesting that star formation has been suppressed in low-density environments before reaching high-density regions. Intriguingly, these red galaxies span a wide range of stellar masses, and the presence of red dwarfs support that not only mass but also environment plays an important role in the quenching of star formation in cluster outskirts. One particular filament, potentially connected to Virgo, already has a group of red populations outside Virgo's R_200, making these galaxies good candidates for being "preprocessed" before entering the Virgo cluster. In addition, several galaxies in the filaments and groups possess relatively low HI gas contents, similar to cluster galaxies. However, the overall fraction of HI-deficient galaxies is not as significantly high as the fraction of red galaxies in these structures. This suggests that HI gas properties are less influenced by the environment than star formation properties in low-density regions, possibly due to gas replenishment through accretion.
#### The Quasar-associated 2175 Å Dust Absorbers in the SDSS DR16 Quasar Catalog

 - **Abstract**
 We present, for the first time, a systematic study of quasar-associated 2175 Å dust absorbers using spectroscopic data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 16 (DR16). By analyzing the optical spectra and multi-band magnitudes of 557,674 quasars in the redshift range of $0.7 \le z \le 2.4$, we identify 843 absorbers that share the same redshifts as quasars and are believed to originate from dust in the quasar nuclei, the host galaxies, or their surrounding environments. These absorbers exhibit weak bump strengths ($A\rm_{bump}=0.49\pm0.15~\mu m^{-1}$) and narrow widths ($\gamma\rm=0.81\pm0.14~\mu m^{-1}$), while their peak positions span a broad range from $x_0 = 4.2$ to $4.84~ \mu m^{-1}$. Their average extinction curves resemble those of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) but exhibit a shallower slope. In broad absorption line (BAL) quasars, the absorption bumps show systematic shifts in peak positions. Although further confirmation is needed, this may suggest environmental differences in dust grain properties. We find a statistically significant negative correlation between bump strength and redshift, suggesting possible evolution in dust properties. These findings highlight the changing composition and physical conditions of dust in quasar environments, likely influenced by factors such as metallicity, radiation fields, and dust processing mechanisms. Future studies incorporating ultraviolet and infrared data will be essential for refining the dust evolution models. Machine learning techniques and high-resolution spectroscopic follow-ups could enhance sample completeness and provide deeper insights into the chemical properties of the dust absorbers.

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce a novel mechanism -- Magnetically Arrested Transmutation (MAT) -- to account for the observed absence of ordinary pulsars near the Galactic centre, a longstanding puzzle known as the missing pulsar problem and the over-representation of magnetic white dwarfs in the same region. In this scenario, compact stars capture and accumulate dark matter, eventually forming an endoparasitic black hole (EBH) of initial mass $M_0$ at their core. Although such EBHs generally grow by accreting host matter, we show that sufficiently strong core magnetic fields can establish pressure equilibrium, thereby stalling further accretion and halting the star's transmutation into a black hole. We derive the conditions for MAT to occur, identifying a critical parameter $\beta$, which encapsulates the interplay between the magnetic field strength, host matter density, and EBH mass. For $0 < \beta \leq 4/27$, the growth of the EBH is arrested, limiting its final mass ($M_{\rm f}$) to $M_0 < M_{\rm f} \leq 3/2 M_0$, whereas for $\beta > 4/27$, full transmutation may ensue. This framework offers a plausible unified explanation for the absence of ordinary pulsars and the survival of the magnetar PSR J1745-2900, and the elevated population of magnetic white dwarfs, in the Galactic centre, and hence could be tested and should have implications for understanding dark matter and compact objects.

 - **Abstract**
 In this manuscript, through applications of TDE (tidal disruption event) expected variability properties, a potential candidate for True type-2 AGN without hidden central broad line regions (=TT2AGN) is reported in the SDSS J233454.07+145712.9 (=SDSS J2334). Through analyzing the 20-years optical light curves of SDSS J2334 from different Sky Survey projects, a TDE is preferred with a $4.7{\rm M_\odot}$ main-sequence star tidally disrupted by the central BH with mass $11.7\times 10^6{\rm M_\odot}$, indicating that central region within distance about 20 light-days to central BH in SDSS J2334 is directly in the line-of-sight. Moreover, AGN activities in SDSS J2334 can be confirmed through applications of BPT diagrams. Meanwhile, comparing virial BH mass determined through assumed broad Balmer emission components and M-sigma expected BH mass by well measured stellar velocity dispersion through stellar absorption features, optical broad emission lines in SDSS J2334 are disfavored with confidence level higher than 6$\sigma$. Therefore, combining the unique properties of the TDE and the spectroscopic results with only narrow emission lines, SDSS J2334 can be well identified as a potential candidate for a TT2AGN. The results indicate the to detect TDE expected flares in normal Type-2 AGN classified by spectroscopic results should be a new practicable method for identifying

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Studies of the Galactic population of double white dwarfs (DWDs) that would be detectable in gravitational waves by LISA have found differences in the number of predicted detectable DWDs of more than an order of magnitude, depending on the binary stellar evolution model used. Particularly, the binary population synthesis code BPASS predicts 20 to 40 times fewer detectable DWDs than the codes SeBa or BSE, which relates to differing treatments of mass transfer and common-envelope events (CEEs). Aims: We aimed to investigate which of these models are closer to reality by comparing their predictions to the DWDs known from electromagnetic observations. Methods: We compared the DWDs predicted by a BPASS galaxy model and a SeBa galaxy model to a DWD catalogue and the sample of DWDs observed by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), taking into account the observational limits and biases of the ZTF survey. Results: We found that BPASS underpredicts the number of short-period DWDs by at least an order of magnitude compared to the observations, while the SeBa galaxy model is consistent with the observations for DWDs more distant than 500 pc. These results highlight how LISA's observations of DWDs will provide invaluable information on aspects of stellar evolution such as mass transfer and CEEs, which will allow theoretical models to be better constrained.

 - **Abstract**
 Aims. The main goal of this paper is to present an accurate and efficient numerical strategy for solving the radiative transfer problem for polarised radiation in strong resonance lines forming out of local thermodynamic equilibrium, taking angle-dependent (AD) partial frequency redistribution (PRD) effects and J-state interference into account. We consider the polarisation produced both by the Zeeman effect and by the scattering of anisotropic radiation, along with its sensitivity to the Hanle and magneto-optical effects. Methods. We introduce a formalism that allows treating both a two-level and a two-term atom in the presence of arbitrary magnetic and bulk velocity fields. The problem is formulated by treating the population of the lower level/term as a fixed input parameter. This approach makes the problem linear with respect to the radiation field, enabling the application of efficient matrix-free preconditioned iterative methods for its solution. Additionally, the computation of the scattering emissivity in the comoving frame, together with a careful choice of the angular and spectral quadrature nodes, allow us to speed up the calculations by reducing the number of evaluations of the redistribution functions. Results. The proposed solution strategy is applied to synthesise the Stokes profiles of the Mg ii h&k doublet and the H i Ly-{\alpha} line in 1D semi-empirical models. The results demonstrate that the method is both fast and accurate. A comparison with calculations from HanleRT-TIC displays an overall good agreement, thereby validating our solution strategy. Moreover, for the wavelength-integrated polarisation profiles of the H i Ly-{\alpha} line, we find an excellent agreement between the results obtained including PRD effects in their general AD description and those obtained considering the angle-averaged simplifying approximation.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding energy transfer through the chromosphere is paramount to solving the coronal heating problem. We investigated the energy dissipation of acoustic waves in the chromosphere of the quiet Sun using 3D radiative magnetohydrodynamic (rMHD) simulations. We analysed the characteristics of acoustic-wave heating and its dependence on height and magnetic field configuration. We find the typical heights where acoustic waves steepen into shocks and the frequencies and wavenumbers that most efficiently dissipate wave energy through this steepening. We combined a comprehensive large-scale analysis, spanning the entirety of the simulations for several solar hours, with a detailed view of an individual shock. We find that the flux of propagating acoustic waves correlates closely with viscous dissipation in the chromosphere above the temperature minimum. Acoustic waves with frequencies close to the acoustic cut-off frequency can efficiently heat the quiet Sun chromosphere at the plasma-$\beta$ = 1 interface and play an important role in the chromospheric energy balance.

 - **Abstract**
 Compton-thick active galactic nuclei (CT-AGNs), which are defined by column density $\mathrm{N_H} \geqslant 1.5 \times 10^{24} \ \mathrm{cm}^{-2}$, emit feeble X-ray radiation, even undetectable by X-ray instruments. Despite this, the X-ray emissions from CT-AGNs are believed to be a substantial contributor to the cosmic X-ray background (CXB). According to synthesis models of AGNs, CT-AGNs are expected to make up a significant fraction of the AGN population, likely around 30% or more. However, only $\sim$11% of AGNs have been identified as CT-AGNs in the Chandra Deep Field-South (CDFS). To identify hitherto unknown CT-AGNs in the field, we used a Random Forest algorithm for identifying them. First, we build a secure classified subset of 210 AGNs to train and evaluate our algorithm. Our algorithm achieved an accuracy rate of 90% on the test set after training. Then, we applied our algorithm to an additional subset of 254 AGNs, successfully identifying 67 CT-AGNs within this group. This result significantly increased the fraction of CT-AGNs in the CDFS, which is closer to the theoretical predictions of the CXB. Finally, we compared the properties of host galaxies between CT-AGNs and non-CT-AGNs and found that the host galaxies of CT-AGNs exhibit higher levels of star formation activity.
#### Effect of Magnetic Field on the Accretion Phase of Population III Star Formation

 - **Abstract**
 We examine the impact of the magnetic field on Population III star formation by varying the magnetic field strength. We perform simulations with magnetic field strengths ranging from $10^{-20}$ G to $10^{-4}$ G, in addition to a model without a magnetic field. The simulations are run for $>1000-1400$ yr after the first protostar forms. In weak-field models, the surrounding disk fragments, forming multiple protostars, and the magnetic field is amplified by the orbital motion and rotation of these protostars. In the model without a magnetic field, frequent fragmentation occurs, and the most massive protostar reaches $\sim200 M_\odot$. However, in models with a magnetic field, once the magnetic field is amplified, the protostars merge to form a single massive protostar, and no further fragmentation occurs except in the model with the strongest magnetic field. Even after the formation of the single protostar, the magnetic field continues to amplify, leading to the formation of a thick disk supported by magnetic pressure and a global spiral pattern. In models with moderate or strong magnetic fields, a rotating disk can form, but fragmentation does not occur, and a strong magnetic field drives an outflow. However, the range of parameters for both disk formation and outflow driving is very narrow, making their appearance under realistic conditions unlikely. Given the weak magnetic field in the early universe, Population III stars are expected to form as single stars, surrounded by a thick disk with a spiral pattern. Thus, the magnetic field, regardless of its strength, plays a crucial role in Population III star formation.

 - **Abstract**
 We apply population synthesis techniques to analyze TYPHOON long slit spectra of the starburst barred spiral galaxy M83. The analysis covers a central square of 5 arcmin side length. We determine the spatial distribution of dust through the analysis of reddening and extinction, together with star formation rates, ages, and metallicities of young and old stellar populations. For the first time, a spatial one-to-one comparison of metallicities derived from full-spectral fitting techniques with those obtained from individual young stellar probes has been carried out. The comparison with blue supergiant stars, young massive star clusters, and super star clusters shows a high degree of concordance when wavelength coverage in the $B$-band is available. The metallicity of the young population is supersolar and does not show a radial metallicity gradient along the investigated part of the disk, in agreement with our chemical evolution model. However, a notable decrease in metallicity is observed in a tightly confined region at the galaxy center, coinciding with circumnuclear orbits. We attribute this to matter infall either from the circumgalactic medium or a dwarf galaxy interloper or, alternatively, to AGN-interrupted chemical evolution. We confirm the presence of a dust cavity with a diameter of 260~pc close to the galaxy center. Dust absorption and molecular CO emission are spatially well correlated. We find an anticorrelation between R$_V$, the ratio of dust attenuation to reddening, and the emission strength of molecular species present in photo-dissociation regions. We confirm our results by using alternative fitting algorithms and stellar libraries.

 - **Abstract**
 We search for signatures of magnetic flux cancellation in a 3D resistive MHD flux-emergence simulation of coronal jets and eruptions in a coronal-hole-like environment. To do this, we analysed the output from a 3D MHD simulation of an emerging twisted horizontal flux tube from the convection zone into the solar atmosphere. The simulation considered the impact of neutral hydrogen on the magnetic induction equation, that is, it employed partially ionised plasma. Standard and blowout jets as well as eruptions were observed during the simulation. We observe clear evidence of magnetic flux cancellation in a short segment along the internal polarity-inversion line (iPIL) of the photospheric Bz during an extended period of the simulation characterised by eruptions and blowout jets. Converging magnetic footpoint motions at ~ 1 km/s carried sheared fields within the magnetic tails of the emerging flux tube towards the iPIL. These fields reconnect at the iPIL and generate concave-upward and slowly rising field lines causing a flux decrease that is associated with magnetic flux cancellation. We show evidence of magnetic flux cancellation in 3D MHD simulations of coronal hole eruptions and jets associated with an emerging twisted flux tube. The magnetic flux cancellation can be traced up to about 520 km above the photosphere and might contribute to the formation of pre-eruptive magnetic flux rope seeds. Although our results are consistent with several basic aspects of magnetic flux-cancellation observations associated with coronal jets, the observations nevertheless also suggest that cancellation involves much larger fractions of the available flux than our numerical simulation. We supply avenues to address this discrepancy in future work.

 - **Abstract**
 The dark matter (DM) conundrum is one of the most intriguing due to its resistance in direct detection experiments. In recent years, attempts to identify non-gravitational signatures as the result of DM traversing or accumulating within stars have attracted a lot of attention. These calculations are usually evaluated at the order-of-magnitude level for stellar populations where the DM density is highest, such as galactic centers. However, if the signature implies the destruction of the host star, their population could have been diminished over a Hubble time in the most DM-dense regions, unless replenished by star formation. This circumstance exemplifies the need for galactic star formation history profiles when deriving DM-induced transient rates, in particular for predicting the host-offset distribution. Here, we combine theoretical and empirical scaling relations of galaxy structure, star formation, and stellar initial mass function to construct a simple and efficient framework that permits us to estimate the target population formation rate and mass function within galactocentric radial zones across galaxy stellar masses and cosmic time. In a companion paper, we apply the framework to the hypothesis that DM in the form of primordial black holes accounts for the ignition of normal type Ia supernovae when colliding with white dwarf stars.
#### Rapid binary mass transfer: Circumbinary outflows and angular momentum losses

 - **Abstract**
 High rates of stable mass transfer likely occur for some binary star systems, but the resulting flow of mass and angular momentum (AM) is unclear. We perform hydrodynamical simulations of a polytropic donor star and a point mass secondary to determine the mass, AM, and velocity of gas that escapes the system, and the dependence on binary parameters such as mass ratio. The simulations use an adiabatic equation of state and do not include any radiative cooling or irradiation of the outflow. Mass transfer is initiated by injecting heat into the stellar envelope, causing it to gradually inflate and overflow its Roche lobe. The transferred mass flows into an accretion disk, but soon begins to escape through the outer Lagrange point (L2), with a lesser amount escaping through the L3 point. This creates an equatorially concentrated circumbinary outflow with an opening angle of 10 to 30 degrees with a wind-like density profile $\rho \propto r^{-2}$. We find that the ratios of the specific AM of the outflowing gas over that of the L2 point are approximately {0.95, 0.9, 0.8, 0.65} for binary mass ratios $q$ (accretor/donor) of {0.25, 0.5, 1, 2}. The asymptotic radial velocity of the outflowing gas, in units of the binary orbital velocity, is approximately 0.1 to 0.2 for the same mass ratios, except for $q=0.25$ where it might be higher. This outflow, if ultimately unbound from the binary, may be a source of circumstellar material that will interact with ejecta from a subsequent supernova or stellar merger.

 - **Abstract**
 The mantle-inner core gravitational (MICG) mode is the free mode axial oscillation between the mantle and inner core sustained by the gravitational torque between their degree 2 order 2 density structures. Here, we investigate how the MICG mode is affected by oscillations of cylindrical surfaces in the fluid outer core in the form of Alfvén waves. The latter are triggered by oscillations of the tangent cylinder (TC) moving jointly with the inner core and propagate away from the rotation axis. We show that the MICG mode remains a distinct normal mode of oscillation of the core-mantle system only when the triggered Alfvén waves are attenuated before they traverse the width of the fluid core. For an internal magnetic field strength of a few mT, as we expect in Earth's core, Alfvén waves can readily traverse the width of the core, and the MICG mode is absorbed into the spectrum of torsional oscillation (TO) modes. The MICG period retains a dynamical influence, acting as a point of resonance for TO modes, and marking the transition from a TO mode in which the motion of the TC (including the inner core) is weakly impacted by gravitational coupling to one in which the oscillating motion of the TC is strongly restricted. Our results imply that the observed 6-year periodic signal in the length of day cannot be interpreted as the signature of the MICG mode and must instead be caused by TO modes, or more generally, by the propagation of Alfvén waves.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Recent spectroscopic measurements have revealed absorption from higher rotational levels in C$_2$ than previous observations. These improvements are accompanied by the availability of updated radiative and collisional data. Aims. We revisit the density and radiation field intensity diagnostics provided by the observations of many rotational levels of inter- stellar C$_2$ and extensive molecular information. Methods. We built an excitation model of C2 without spatial structure, including levels up to J= 34 where updated radiative and collisional excitation data are introduced as well as excitation by chemical formation. Results. We confirm the importance of the recent collisional excitation rate coefficients of C$_2$ by molecular H$_2$. We show that the new higher level observations cannot be explained by the standard balance between collisional excitation and radiative transitions. We propose that chemical excitation at formation provides a plausible mechanism to explain the observed high excitation of C$_2$. In addition, it allows us to lift the degeneracy of the density over radiation field strength parameter in the excitation model. Conclusions. A 0D model remains limited and it is highly desirable to use a full Photon Dominated Region (PDR) model, which includes all excitation processes introduced here and full chemical and thermal balance.
#### Discovery of a kinematically distinct component in the central region of the collisional ring galaxy AM0644-741

 - **Abstract**
 We present the discovery of a peculiar central stellar structure in the collisional ring galaxy AM0644-741 using HST imaging and MUSE integral field unit (IFU) data. We identified two Sérsic components with a Sérsic index of 1.72 (inner part) and 1.11 (outer part) in the HST F814W band optical image using \textsc{Galfit}. We utilized the MUSE data cube to construct stellar line of sight velocity (V$_{\rm LOS}$), velocity dispersion ($\sigma_{\rm LOS}$), h$_3$ \& h$_4$ velocity moments, and stellar population age maps using the \textsc{GIST} pipeline for further investigating both Sérsic components, which have a difference of $\sim$ 60 degrees in their position angle. The inner component, with an effective radius $\sim$1 kpc, shows a strong anticorrelation between V$_{\rm LOS}$/$\sigma_{\rm LOS}$ and h$_3$, indicating the presence of a rotating stellar structure. In addition, the inner component also shows a relatively higher velocity dispersion (average values reaching up to $\sim$240 km sec$^{-1}$) along with disky isophotes and stronger Mg~$b$ line strength, which all together highlight a peculiar dynamical state of AM0644-741's central region. Our analysis suggests that the recent encounter has had a smaller impact on the stellar orbits within the inner component. In contrast, it has specifically affected the stellar orbits of the progenitor's outer disk when forming the star-forming ring. The BPT analysis of the unresolved nuclear source shows a LINER-type ionization, hinting at AGN activity in the galaxy. Our study projects the dynamical evolution of collisional systems and provides scope for simulations to explore the central region in greater detail.

 - **Abstract**
 Non-minimal couplings between the electromagnetic field strength and the spacetime curvature are part of the effective field theory of gravity and matter. They alter the local propagation of light in a significant way if the ratio of spacetime curvature to the non-minimal coupling is of order one. Spacetime curvature can become appreciable around black holes, and yet the effect of non-minimal couplings on electromagnetic observations of black holes remains underexplored. A particular feature of the non-minimal coupling between the electromagnetic field-strength and the Riemann tensor is that it generates two distinct photon rings for different polarizations. Working within the paradigm of lensing bands, and focusing on the $n=1$ photon ring, we investigate which values of the non-minimal coupling can be robustly excluded.

 - **Abstract**
 Population III (Pop III) stars, the first generation of stars formed from primordial gas, played a fundamental role in shaping the early universe through their influence on cosmic reionization, early chemical enrichment, and the formation of the first galaxies. However, to date they have eluded direct detection due to their short lifetimes and high redshifts. The launch of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revolutionized observational capabilities, providing the opportunity to detect Pop~III stars via caustic lensing, where strong gravitational lensing magnifies individual stars to observable levels. This prospect makes it compelling to develop accurate models for their spectral characteristics to distinguish them from other stellar populations. Previous studies have focused on computing the spectral properties of non-rotating, zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) Pop III stars. In this work, we expand upon these efforts by incorporating the effects of stellar rotation and post-ZAMS evolution into spectral calculations. We use the JWST bands and magnitude limits to identify the optimal observing conditions, both for isolated stars, as well as for small star clusters. We find that, while rotation does not appreciably change the observability at ZAMS, the subsequent evolution can significantly brighten the stars, making the most massive ones potentially visible with only moderate lensing.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the evolution of dust in galaxies is crucial because it affects the dynamics and cooling of gas, star formation, and chemical evolution. Recent work on dust removal in galaxies indicates timescales of gigayears, with old stellar populations and AGNs as the primary drivers of this process. However, most statistically significant studies are focused on low redshifts $z < 0.4$. Here, we determine the dust removal timescale in galaxies over a wide range of redshifts, up to $z \sim 5$. We use publicly available catalogue data of infrared-selected galaxies, observed by \textit{Herschel}. Using the inferred dust masses, stellar masses, and stellar ages, we calculate the dust removal timescale in a sample of more than 120,000 galaxies. We find that, with increasing redshift, the dust removal timescale decreases from 1.8 Gyr at redshift $z \sim 0.05$ to less than 500\,Myr at $z > 3$. Galaxies at higher redshifts undergo more efficient dust removal than galaxies at lower redshift, likely driven by AGN activity, supernova shocks, and astration. These findings indicate that dust removal evolves over cosmic time, reflecting the changing mechanisms regulating dust content of galaxies as the Universe evolves.
