 - **Abstract**
 Observations from the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) have revealed electric vector position angle (EVPA) rotation in several neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries, including the galactic X-ray burster GX 13+1. We developed a novel Bayesian nested sampling framework-"Q-U Event-by-Event Nested sampling for Bayesian EVPA Evolution" (QUEEN-BEE)-to model unbinned Stokes parameters and infer optimal EVPA rotation rates in IXPE data. We then applied this framework to three previous IXPE observations of GX 13+1. In the first observation, QUEEN-BEE recovers a rotation rate of 42+/-4 degrees/day, consistent with prior binned analysis. Energy-binned QUEEN-BEE analysis of this first observation suggests a slab-like coronal geometry, providing the first constraints between slab and shell coronae for this source. We also explore alternative EVPA rotation scenarios in GX 13+1 including variable disk wind behavior. The second observation of this source shows no evidence of rotation, and the third observation shows transient rotating behavior with an EVPA rotation rate when exiting a light curve dip of 170 +20/-40 degrees/day. The results show marginal but consistent increases in the overall measured polarization degree (PD) for epochs where the EVPA rotation is identified. These results demonstrate that QUEEN-BEE can identify evolving polarization signatures in both time- and energy-resolved regimes, even where binned methods fall below detection thresholds. Our findings highlight the diagnostic potential of QUEEN-BEE as a tool for discriminating between competing physical models of coronal geometry and probing disk-wind-related polarization behavior, highlighting the promising potential for application of this framework in a variety of other IXPE observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Brown dwarfs that are short period ($<10\,$day) companions to actively flaring M dwarfs may provide a context to directly observe flare-driven photochemistry and structural changes in an extrasolar planet-like atmosphere. To assess the viability of directly observing flare impacts in the atmosphere of a brown dwarf, we perform self-consistent temperature-chemistry modeling of the atmospheric response to individual energetic superflares. We modified the existing open-source \texttt{VULCAN} chemical-kinetics and \texttt{HELIOS} radiative-transfer codes for this purpose. Similar to previous studies of flare impacts on hydrogen dominated atmospheres, we find flares are capable of orders-of-magnitude changes in the mixing abundances of many chemical species, including important opacity sources like CH$_4$ and CO$_2$. However, due to fast chemical timescales resulting from high temperatures and densities in brown dwarf atmospheres, these changes last for a short-period of time, generally less than a day, and are only plausibly observable via high resolution emission spectroscopy. We find that the most observable, short-term spectral changes in hot (T$_{\text{eff}}\sim2000\,$K), high-gravity ($\log{\text{g}}\sim5$), cloudless brown dwarfs are the photolysis of H$_2$O and enhancement of CO$_2$, which can result in part-per-thousands spectral changes in the hours after a flare.

 - **Abstract**
 The James Webb Space Telescope (\textit{JWST}) opened a new observational window on the primordial Universe. Here we present new JWST NIRSpec integral field spectroscopy (IFS) observations of the $z=7.54$ quasar ULAS J1342+0928 obtained as part of the Galaxy Assembly with NIRSpec IFS (GA-NIFS) GTO programme. The new data-set obtained with both the prism ($R\sim100$) and the high-resolution grating ($R\sim2700$) allow for a complete description of the quasar emission from the rest-frame UV to optical bands. The low-resolution data reveal the presence of [\ion{O}{iii}] emission on $\sim$7 kpc scales, well above the typical galaxy size at this redshift, likely associated with a past outflow event. Additionally, the high-resolution observations show a more energetic ionised outflow on nuclear scales ($\lesssim 0.6$ kpc). The total ionised mass outflow rate ranges between 50 and 300 $\rm M_{\odot} \, yr^{-1}$ where the significant spread is mostly due to the lack of tight constraints on the electron density. This range overlaps in part with the star formation rate range (85--545 $\rm M_{\odot} \, yr^{-1}$), implying that the nuclear outflow could ultimately lead to an early star formation quenching. By employing an accretion disc modelling, for the first time on \textit{JWST} data, we manage to robustly estimate the black hole mass and the bolometric luminosity, $\rm \log(M_{BH}/(M_{\odot}))=9.2\pm 0.2$ and $\rm \log(L_{bol}/(erg \, s^{-1}))=46.8\pm 0.1$, respectively. We derive an Eddington ratio of $\rm \lambda_{Edd}\sim 0.4$, challenging the paradigm of widespread super-Eddington accretion in quasars at the epoch of reionisation.
#### A galactic tug-of-war: how (not) to simultaneously fit the Milky Way satellite luminosity function and the mass-metallicity relation

 - **Abstract**
 The satellite population of the Milky Way is shaped by a range of astrophysical processes including mergers, star formation, feedback, and cosmic reionisation. Determining which processes most strongly influence its properties is challenging and a key test of galaxy formation models. We train a neural network on the GALFORM semi-analytic model and apply a variance-based sensitivity analysis to characterise the influence of 11 astrophysical parameters on two key observables: the satellite luminosity function, and the mass-metallicity relation. We find that: (1) the abundance of bright satellites ($\mathrm{M}_V \lesssim -13$) is regulated primarily by supernova feedback; (2) the faint end of the luminosity function is shaped by the interplay between feedback and reionisation; and (3) the mass-metallicity relation is governed almost exclusively by feedback at all masses. We are unable to find a combination of parameters in the fiducial model that fits the observed data for both statistics simultaneously. To understand why, we employ SHapley Additive exPlanations to capture the directionality of each parameter variation. This enables us to pinpoint the origin of tensions in the model, showing that parameter adjustments that regulate the abundance of faint satellites drive stellar metallicities to be an order of magnitude too low and vice versa. This internal "tug-of-war" leads us to consider extensions to the baseline model, such as metal loading in winds, or allowing the feedback strength to evolve with redshift. Our study highlights the value of interrogating complex physical models through a sensitivity analysis framework by revealing high-order parameter interactions and non-linear responses that traditional one-at-a-time variations would miss.

 - **Abstract**
 Dense young star clusters (YSCs) are ideal environments for dynamical interactions between stars and stellar mass black holes (BHs). In such dense environments, stars can undergo close encounters with BHs and fall within their tidal radius, resulting in micro-tidal disruption events (micro-TDEs), transient phenomena with potential multi-messenger signatures. We performed a suite of direct N-body simulations using the PETAR code, to which we implemented new prescriptions for modeling micro-TDEs. We constructed a set of realistic YSC models including primordial binaries, based on the observed Milky Way population. Our simulations incorporate stellar and binary evolution, supernova kicks, and stellar winds using the BSE code, and account for the Galactic tidal field via the GALPY library. We identify three dynamical channels for micro-TDE production: single star-single BH encounters, binary-mediated interactions (including supernova-kick triggers), and interactions involving higher-order multiple systems such as hierarchical triples and quadruples, as well as chaotic few-body interactions. Multiple encounters are the most efficient production channel, which dominates the total rate: 350-450 Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$. Micro-TDEs from YSCs are expected to be detectable by upcoming surveys, particularly the Legacy Survey of Space and Time, with detection rates potentially up to hundreds per year. The gravitational wave (GW) signals expected from micro-TDEs peak in the deci-Hertz band, making them accessible to future instruments such as the Lunar Gravitational Wave Antenna and the Deci-Hertz Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory. Micro-TDEs emerge as promising multi-messenger sources, potentially offering unique insights into star cluster dynamics, stellar collisions, and the population of dormant stellar-mass BHs, through both electromagnetic and GW observations.

 - **Abstract**
 We studied 12 disk streams found in a 250$^3$ pc$^3$ volume in the solar neighborhood, which we define as coeval and comoving stellar structures with aspect ratios greater than 3:1. Using \emph{Gaia} Data Release 3 data and the advanced clustering algorithms \texttt{SigMA} and \texttt{Uncover}, we identified and characterized these streams beyond the search volume, doubling, on average, their known populations. We estimate the number density of disk streams to be $\approx 820$ objects\,/\,kpc$^3$ (for $|Z| < 100$\,pc), or surface densities of $\approx 160$ objects\,/\,kpc$^2$. These estimates surpass N-body estimates by one to two orders of magnitude and challenge the prevailing understanding of their destruction mechanisms. Our analysis reveals that these 12 disk streams are dynamically cold with 3D velocity dispersions between 2 and 5\,km\,s$^{-1}$, exhibit narrow sequences in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, and are highly elongated with average aspect ratios of 7:1, extending up to several hundred parsecs. We find evidence suggesting that one of the disk streams, currently embedded in the Scorpius-Centaurus association, is experiencing disruption, likely due to the primordial gas mass of the association.

 - **Abstract**
 Following a binary neutron star (BNS) merger, the transient remnant is often a fast-spinning, differentially rotating, magnetised hypermassive neutron star (HMNS). This object is prone to the magnetorotational instability (MRI) which drives magnetohydrodynamic turbulence that significantly influences the HMNS global dynamics. A key consequence of turbulence is the outward transport of angular momentum which impacts the remnant's stability and lifetime. Most numerical simulations of BNS mergers are unable to resolve the MRI due to its inherently small wavelength. To overcome this limitation, subgrid models have been proposed to capture the effects of unresolved small-scale physics in terms of large-scale quantities. We present the first implementation of our MHD-Instability-Induced Turbulence (MInIT) model in global Newtonian simulations of MRI-sensitive, differentially rotating, magnetised neutron stars. Here, we show that by adding the corresponding turbulent stress tensors to the momentum equation, MInIT successfully reproduces the angular momentum transport in neutron stars driven by small-scale turbulence.

 - **Abstract**
 The Alfvén surface -- where the solar wind exceeds the local Alfvén speed as it expands into interplanetary space -- is now routinely probed by NASA's Parker Solar Probe (PSP) in the near-Sun environment. The size of the Alfvén surface governs how efficiently the solar wind braking torque causes the Sun to spin-down. We aimed to characterise the size and evolution of the Alfvén surface as magnetic activity increased during solar cycle 25. The Alfvén surface was extrapolated from the solar wind mass and magnetic flux measured by the SWEAP and FIELDS instrument suites onboard PSP. We accounted for the acceleration of the solar wind along Parker spiral magnetic field lines and used potential field source surface modelling to determine the sources of the solar wind. The longitudinally averaged Alfvén radius measured by PSP grew from 11 to 16 solar radii as solar activity increased. Accordingly, the solar wind angular momentum-loss rate grew from $\sim$1.4$\times 10^{30}$ erg to 3$\times 10^{30}$ erg. Both the radial and longitudinal scans of the solar wind contained fluctuations of 10-40\% from the average Alfvén radius in each encounter. Structure in the solar corona influenced the morphology of the Alfvén surface, which was smallest around the heliospheric current sheet and pseudostreamers. The Alfvén surface was highly structured and time-varying however, at large-scales, organised by the coronal magnetic field. The evolution of the solar corona over the solar cycle systematically shifted the magnetic connectivity of PSP and influenced our perception of the Alfvén surface. The Alfvén surface was 30\% larger than both thermally-driven and Alfvén wave-driven wind simulations with the same mass-loss rate and open magnetic flux, but had a similar dependence on the wind magnetisation parameter.

 - **Abstract**
 We utilize the Magneticum suite of hydrodynamical simulations to investigate the formation and evolution of cosmic voids from $z = 5.04$ to present day, using cold dark matter and (sub-) halo tracers in high-density samples. This includes the evolution of their global properties, such as size, shape, inner density, and average density, as well as their radial density profiles. Our results provide several key conclusions for void analyses in modern surveys. We demonstrate that a relative size framework is required, mitigating methodological selection effects and revealing the true physical evolution of densities around halo-defined voids. This necessity arises from our findings that a void's properties are more fundamentally tied to its rank within its contemporary population than to its absolute size. Using this framework, we show that the evolution of halo voids stabilizes at redshifts below $z \simeq 1$, driven primarily by cosmic expansion rather than ongoing halo formation. We further find that the matter evolution around these stable voids is remarkably well-described by linear growth theory, with deviations appearing as non-linear growth on small scales and suppressed growth in the largest voids, potentially driven by the influence of dark energy. This late-time stability and the predictable evolution confirm voids as pristine laboratories for probing the nature of dark energy with upcoming surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, the suitability of fast-declining Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) as cosmological standard candles is examined utilizing a Hubble Flow sample of 43 of these objects observed by the Carnegie Supernova Project (CSP). We confirm previous suggestions that fast-declining SNe Ia offer a viable method for estimating distances to early-type galaxies when the color-stretch parameter, $s_{BV}$, is used as a measure of the light curve shape. As a test, we employ the Tripp (1998) method, which models the absolute magnitude at maximum as a function of light curve shape and color. We calibrate the sample using 12 distance moduli based on published Infrared Surface Brightness Fluctuations to derive a value of the Hubble constant that is in close agreement with the value found by Uddin et al. (2024), using the same methodology, but with the full sample of CSP SNe Ia. We also develop a new and simple method of estimating the distances of fast decliners only based on their colors at maximum (and not light curve shape) and find that it has a precision similar to the Tripp method. This "Color" technique is a powerful tool that is unique to fast-declining SNe Ia. We show that the colors of the fast decliners at maximum light are strongly affected by photospheric temperature differences and not solely due to dust extinction, and provide a physical rationale for this effect.
#### Constraining Baryon Fractions in Galaxy Groups and Clusters with the First CHIME/FRB Outrigger

 - **Abstract**
 Fast radio bursts (FRBs) provide a sensitive probe of diffuse baryons: their dispersion measures (DMs) measure electron density independent of temperature and scale linearly with gas density. This makes them particularly well suited to studying the intragroup medium (IGrM), where traditional probes such as X-ray emission and the SZ effect are weak. Evidence suggests that the baryon content of group mass halos ($M_{500}\sim10^{13}-10^{14}$ M$_{\odot}$) is strongly affected by galactic feedback, creating deviations from cluster scaling relations. Three FRBs from the first CHIME/FRB Outrigger sample come from host galaxies found within or behind galaxy clusters and groups. Using integrated halo density models, we estimate the DM contribution of each ICM/IGrM, accounting for uncertainties in halo mass and the distance to the host galaxy relative to the cluster center. For the more massive halos, predicted cluster DMs agree with the extragalactic DM budget. One burst, FRB 20230703A, intersects three groups yet has a low extragalactic DM. By comparing model predictions with the measured DM, we constrain the baryon fraction $f_g(R)$ in these halos. Comparing with published $M-f_g$ relations, we find consistency with recent eROSITA results at $R_{500}$, mild tension at $R_{200}$, and strong tensions with earlier X-ray-based relations. As CHIME/FRB Outriggers build a large catalog of localized FRBs, many additional sightlines through groups and clusters will be obtained. These will enable systematic tests of intragroup and intracluster gas properties and sharpen constraints on the distribution of baryons in massive halos.

 - **Abstract**
 Little Red Dots (LRDs) are a puzzling population of extragalactic sources whose origin is highly debated. In this Letter, we stack NIRCam, MIRI and ALMA images of a large and homogeneously-selected sample of LRDs from multiple JWST Legacy fields. We find clear evidence for hot-dust emission, seen as a rising mid-infrared continuum up to rest-frame $\lambda_{\rm rest}$$\sim$ 3$\mu$m, that is best explained by a standard dusty AGN structure. This scenario holds regardless of whether the Optical/Ultraviolet (UV) continuum is stellar or AGN-dominated. Either ways, we argue that AGN-heated dust must have a geometry that leaves at least part of the Optical/UV continuum and broad-line region emission unobscured, which explains the observed blue UV slopes and prominent Balmer features. Lack of detections in the deep stack of X-ray images suggests that Compton-thick ($N_{\rm H}$$>$3$\times$10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$) gas obscuration is common, and likely confined within the dust sublimation radius ($R$$_{\rm sub}$$\sim$0.1 pc). While this gas-dust displacement is in line with recent models (e.g. the ``Black Hole Star''), how pre-enriched hot dust can form around a nearly-pristine black hole environment remains to be explained.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent years have seen many arguments for cosmic rays (CRs) as an important influence on galactic and circumgalactic (CGM) physics, star and galaxy formation. We present a pedagogical overview of state-of-the-art modeling of CR-magnetohydrodynamics (CR-MHD) on macro scales (~kpc), highlighting their fundamental dependence on the micro (< au) scales of CR gyro orbits and meso (~pc) scales of CR mean-free-paths, intended to connect the extragalactic, Galactic, and plasma CR transport modeling communities. We note the pitfalls and systematic errors that arise from older assumptions in CR modeling, including: use of a simple Fokker-Planck equation or ad-hoc two-moment formalisms for transport; assumption of leaky boxes or plane-parallel or shear-periodic boundaries for comparison to local interstellar medium (LISM) observations; ignoring detailed LISM constraints on CR spectra (e.g. focusing only on extragalactic observables or spectrally integrated models); assuming CR transport is mediated by classical models of advection, streaming from self-confinement (super-Alfvenic or Alfvenic), or extrinsic turbulence. We emphasize recent progress addressing these: development of rigorously-derived CR-MHD equations; use of global, 3D galaxy+halo models for LISM comparisons; new methods for full-spectrum dynamics; novel models for intermittent scattering and/or new drivers. We compile extragalactic+LISM observations to show how ~GeV CR transport is being rapidly constrained in the CGM, and present phenomenological models which can be used in future simulations. We conclude by highlighting critical open questions for micro, meso, and macro-scale CR-MHD simulations.
#### Probing the Infrared/Radio correlation of the full IRAS Revised Bright Galaxy Sample with MeerKAT and the VLA

 - **Abstract**
 We study the infrared/radio correlation of galaxies in the IRAS Revised Bright Galaxy Sample using new MeerKAT observations at $\rm\nu = 1.28\, GHz$, complemented with VLA data. We classify the objects by primary energy source (Active Galactic Nuclei vs. Star-Forming) and take into account their merger status. With this, we aim to explore the effect of galaxy-galaxy interaction on the total-infrared (TIR)/radio correlation ($q_\mathrm{TIR}$) of star-forming galaxies by comparing the $q_\mathrm{TIR}$ distribution between isolated and interacting/merging sources. We found the median $q_\mathrm{TIR}$ to be $2.61 \pm 0.01$ (scatter = 0.16) for isolated galaxies and $2.51 \pm 0.08$ (scatter = 0.26) for interacting/merging galaxies. Our analysis reveals that interacting/merging galaxies exhibit lower $q_\mathrm{TIR}$ and higher dispersion compared to isolated galaxies, and the difference is marginally significant. Interacting/merging galaxies have redder $W2-W3$ colours, higher star formation rates (SFR) and specific SFR compared to isolated objects. We observe a significant decrease in $q_\mathrm{TIR}$ with increasing radio luminosity for isolated galaxies. Additionally, we find the median ratio of TIR ($8 \,\mu m < \lambda < 1000\, \mu m$) to far-infrared (FIR; $40 \,\mu m < \lambda < 120\, \mu m$) luminosities to be $\left<L_\mathrm{TIR}/L_\mathrm{FIR}\right>\approx2.29$. By examining the relation between $L_\mathrm{TIR}$ and the mid-infrared (MIR) star-formation rate indicator ($L_\mathrm{12\,\mu m}$) employed for our interacting/merging sample, we note a strong and consistent (similar non-linear behaviour) relationship between the TIR/radio and TIR/MIR ratios. Finally, we show that already at $z<0.1$, $q_\mathrm{TIR}$ exhibits a dependence on stellar mass, with more massive galaxies displaying a lower $q_\mathrm{TIR}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic rays (CRs) are a non-thermal energy component in the interstellar and circumgalactic medium (CGM) that can act as an additional feedback channel beyond thermal and kinetic feedback from stars and AGN. They influence galaxy evolution by altering gas properties, regulating star formation, and shaping galactic outflows. We investigate these effects using a suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations, which incorporate CR transport and feedback on top of the Auriga galaxy formation model. Our simulations span a wide range of halo masses, from dwarf galaxies to small groups ($M_{200\mathrm{c}}= 10^{10} - 10^{13}~\mathrm{M}_\odot$), allowing us to assess the mass-dependent impact of CRs in a cosmological setting. We find that CRs have the strongest impact in lower-mass galaxies ($M_{200\mathrm{c}} < 10^{12}~\mathrm{M}_\odot$), where they suppress star formation rates by up to 50\%, reduce gas and stellar half-light radii, and drive outflows that reach higher velocities at the virial radius compared to simulations without CRs. These CR-enhanced outflows also transport more metals and magnetic fields into the CGM, leading to higher CGM metallicities, stronger magnetisation, and lower CGM temperatures. In more massive galaxies, CRs do not significantly affect star formation or outflow properties, likely because thermal and kinetic feedback from stars and AGN dominate in this regime. However, CRs still influence galaxy morphology across all halo masses by reducing the gas half-mass radius and stellar half-light radius. Finally, variations in CR transport properties, such as different diffusion coefficients or the exclusion of Alfvén cooling, significantly affect star formation, CGM properties, and outflows in lower-mass galaxies. This sensitivity makes these galaxies key environments for testing CR transport models and refining our understanding of their role in galaxy evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Dual-phase xenon time projection chambers achieve optimal sensitivity for dark matter in the $10$--$1000~\mathrm{GeV}/c^2$ mass range, but sub-GeV dark matter particles lack sufficient energy to produce nuclear recoils above detection thresholds in these detectors. Blazar-boosted dark matter offers a way to overcome this limitation: relativistic jets in active galactic nuclei can accelerate light dark matter in their host-galaxy halos to energies capable of producing detectable nuclear recoil signals in xenon-based detectors on Earth. We present the first blazar-boosted dark matter search incorporating detector response modeling, using public data from XENON1T and LZ for the blazar TXS~0506+056. We model dark matter--proton scattering in the jet environment, covering the full process from jet acceleration to detector response. We explore how the host-galaxy dark matter density profile impacts our analysis. Using XENON1T data, we exclude dark matter--nucleon cross sections for $m_\chi \sim 1~\mathrm{MeV}$ in the range $5.8\times 10^{-31}~\mathrm{cm^2} \lesssim \sigma_{\chi n} \lesssim 6.3\times 10^{-29}~\mathrm{cm^2}$, and using LZ EFT searches we constrain $9.9\times 10^{-32}~\mathrm{cm^2} \lesssim \sigma_{\chi n} \lesssim 2.5\times 10^{-28}~\mathrm{cm^2}$. Our results show that astrophysical uncertainties, especially the dark matter density profile near the supermassive black hole, set the primary limitation on the sensitivity rather than detector systematics. These findings highlight blazar-boosted dark matter as a promising probe of light dark matter and motivate further astrophysical modeling.

 - **Abstract**
 While bars are commonly observed in disk galaxies, the precise conditions governing their formation remain incompletely understood. To investigate these conditions, we perform a suite of N-body simulations of bulgeless disk galaxies with stellar masses in the range $10^9 \leq M_d \leq 10^{11} \;M_\odot$. Our galaxy models are constructed based on the observed properties of nearby barred galaxies from the S4G survey, and we systematically vary the halo scale radius to isolate its dynamical influence. Bars in our simulations form via repeated swing amplifications of disk perturbations, sustained by feedback loops. The amplification factor $\Gamma$ depends on both the Toomre stability parameter $Q_T$ and the dimensionless wavelength $X$. Based on our simulation results, we propose a two-parameter bar formation criterion, $Q_T + 0.4(X - 1.4)^2 \leq 1.8$, corresponding to $\Gamma = 10$, which better captures the onset of bar formation than traditional one-parameter conditions. Bars in low-mass galaxies tend to be shorter and weaker, and are more susceptible to disruption by outer spiral arms. In contrast, bars in high-mass galaxies are longer, stronger, and more resilient to spiral interference. Bars in low-mass galaxies undergo only slight vertical thickening over time, whereas those in high-mass galaxies thicken rapidly via buckling instability.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the role of baryonic physics in shaping the population, structure, and internal dynamics of galactic subhalos using the Mochima suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations. A refined method is developed to identify bound subhalo material by isolating the local gravitational potential and applying multi-criteria phase-space selection. This approach enables a robust characterisation of subhalo properties across five baryonic runs with varying prescriptions for star formation, and supernova and protostellar feedback, as well as a dark matter-only baseline. At the population level, we find that host halo concentration, modulated by baryonic feedback, is a key predictor of subhalo survival. Subhalos with more massive stellar components exhibit deeper internal potentials and enhanced resilience to tidal disruption. At the structural level, we identify a broad diversity in inner dark matter profiles, consistent with observations of dwarf galaxies. We show that this diversity correlates with both star formation history and environmental interaction. In particular, galaxies that form most of their stars early tend to retain steep cusps, while those with extended or recent star formation exhibit oscillating inner slopes shaped by bursty feedback and tidal perturbations. These findings suggest that the so-called "diversity problem" may reflect the complex interplay between feedback history and gravitational environment, rather than a breakdown of cold dark matter predictions.
#### TeV Emission in NGC 4278: Shock Energetics Insufficient, Compact Origin Favored

 - **Abstract**
 The Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory recently detected TeV emission from the low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (LLAGN) NGC 4278. Integral-field spectroscopy with MEGARA revealed ionized outflows on hundred-parsec scales with kinetic power $\dot E_{\rm shock} \sim 10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$, well below the TeV luminosity $L_{\gamma} \gtrsim 10^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The implied efficiencies, $\eta \gtrsim 1000$, are far above unity, showing that shocks cannot account for the TeV emission. Contemporaneous Fermi-Large Area Telescope and Swift data, consistent with a compact synchrotron self-Compton jet component, favor a nuclear origin. NGC 4278 is the first low-ionization nuclear emission-line region (LINER)/LLAGN of its class detected at TeV energies, a benchmark for LINERs with outflows and a prime target for the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory. I conclude that the TeV photons arise from a compact nuclear accelerator, while optical outflows trace larger-scale jet--ISM interactions that coexist but do not power the TeV radiation.
#### Tidal disruption events in active galactic nuclei: on orbital inclination and Schwarzschild apsidal precession

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal disruption events (TDEs) in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) mark a regime where traditional vacuum models fail to capture the full dynamics, especially due to interaction between stellar debris and pre-existing accretion disks. We perform meshless hydrodynamic simulations incorporating both general relativistic (GR) effects and radiative cooling to study TDEs in AGNs with different orbital inclinations ($\theta_{\rm inc}$) of the disrupted star, ranging from projected prograde to retrograde orbits. We post-process the simulations to derive multi-wavelength light curves and identify several distinct features in the light curves, including a precursor flare from early debris-disk collision and a major flare driven by fallback. The dynamics of the stellar debris and accretion disk, and subsequently the light curve features, are strongly affected by $\theta_{\rm inc}$ and GR effects. Retrograde orbits ($\theta_{\rm inc}=135^\circ$) yield a more luminous, shorter major flare and a more prominent precursor than prograde ones ($\theta_{\rm inc}=22.5^\circ$). During fallback, prograde cases ($\theta_{\rm inc} = 22.5^\circ$, $45^\circ$) develop a central cavity with spirals in the inner region of the AGN disk, leading to transient UV/X-ray suppression accompanied by oscillations, while higher inclinations ($\theta_{\rm inc}=90^\circ$, $135^\circ$) form a gradually tilting inner disk, potentially causing UV/X-ray dips via geometric effects at certain viewing angles. Relativistic apsidal precession alters stream collisions, producing structural differences in the inner disk, outer disk, and debris compared to Newtonian cases, and drives quasi-periodic signals in prograde configurations. These results provide predictive diagnostics for identifying AGN TDEs and interpreting observed light-curve diversity.

 - **Abstract**
 This study presents a statistical analysis of optical light curves (LCs) of 200 UVOT-detected GRBs from 2005 to 2018. We have categorised these LCs based on their distinct morphological features, including early flares, bumps, breaks, plateaus, etc. Additionally, to compare features across different wavelengths, we have also included XRT LCs in our sample. The early observation capability of UVOT has allowed us to identify very early flares in 21 GRBs preceding the normal decay or bump, consistent with predictions of external reverse or internal shock. The decay indices of optical LCs following a simple power-law (PL) are shallower than corresponding X-ray LCs, indicative of a spectral break between two wavelengths. Not all LCs with PL decay align with the forward shock model and require additional components such as energy injection or a structured jet. Further, plateaus in the optical LCs are primarily consistent with energy injection from the central engine to the external medium. However, in four cases, plateaus followed by steep decay may have an internal origin. The optical luminosity observed during the plateau is tightly correlated with the break time, indicative of a magnetar as their possible central engine. For LCs with early bumps, the peak position, correlations between the parameters, and observed achromaticity allowed us to constrain their origin as the onset of afterglow, off-axis jet, late re-brightening, etc. In conclusion, the ensemble of observed features is explained through diverse physical mechanisms or emissions observed from different outflow locations and, in turn, diversity among possible progenitors.

 - **Abstract**
 While C IV is the most common absorption line in Broad Absorption Line Quasar spectra, Balmer absorption lines are among the rarest. We present analysis of Balmer absorption in a sample of fourteen iron low-ionization BAL quasars (FeLoBALQs); eight are new identifications. We measured velocity offset, width, and apparent optical depth. The partial covering ubiquitous in BAL quasar spectra alters the measured Balmer optical depth ratios; taking that into account, we estimated the true H(n= 2) column density. We found the anticipated correlation between Eddington ratio and outflow speed, but it is weak in this sample because nearly all of the objects have the low outflow speeds characterizing loitering outflow FeLoBAL quasars (H. Choi et al. 2022b), objects that are also found to have low accretion rates (K. M. Leighly et al. 2022; H. Choi et al. 2022a). Measures of dN/dv, the differential column density with respect to the outflow speed, are anticorrelated with the luminosity and Eddington ratio: the strongest absorption is observed at the lowest speeds in the lowest luminosity objects. The absorption line width is correlated with {\alpha}oi, the F{\lambda} point-to-point slope between 5100A and 3 microns. This parameter is strongly correlated with the Eddington ratio among low-redshift quasars (K. M. Leighly et al. 2024). Balmer absorption lines have been recently found in the spectra of Little Red Dots (LRDs), a class of high-redshift objects discovered by JWST. We note suggestive similarities between LRDs and FeLoBAL quasars in the emission line shape, the presence of steep reddening and a scattered blue continuum, the lack of hot dust emission, and X-ray weakness.

 The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope is currently celebrating its 15th anniversary of operation. Since its launch, the Fermi-Large Area Telescope (LAT), the main instrument onboard the Fermi satellite, has remarkably unveiled the sky at GeV energies providing outstanding results in time-domain gamma-ray astrophysics. In particular, LAT has observed some of the most powerful transient phenomena in the Universe (such as gamma-ray bursts, blazar flares, magnetar flares, ...) enabling the possibility to test our current understanding of the laws of physics in extreme conditions. In this paper I will review some of the main recent results with a focus on the transient phenomena seen by LAT with a multi-wavelength and multi-messenger connection.

 - **Abstract**
 A number of theories have been put forward to explain the bi-modal stellar rotational distribution observed in young massive clusters. These include stellar mergers and interactions induced in binary systems, and the role of angular momentum transfer between a star and its circumstellar disk in its early evolution. Each theory predicts unique rotation distributions in various locations of the colour-magnitude diagram. Specifically, the stellar merger hypothesis posits that the upper end of the main sequence will host a significant number of slowly rotating merger products, essentially that the blue straggler stars are an extension of the blue main sequence. In the present work, we use observations of three massive ($\sim10^5$~\msun) young ($100-300$~Myr) clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud using a combination of HST photometry and VLT/MUSE spectroscopy. We show that in all three clusters, these bright blue stars have stellar rotational distributions that differ significantly from that measured on the blue main sequence. We conclude that stellar mergers do not play a significant role in the formation of the split main sequence/bi-modal rotational distribution. As a corollary, we show that blue straggler stars in these YMCs display a wide range of rotational velocities.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed analysis of type Iax supernova SN 2022xlp. With a V-band absolute magnitude light curve peaking at $M_{max}(V) = -16.04 \pm 0.25$ mag, this object is regarded as the second determined well-observed Iax supernova in the intermediate luminosity range after SN 2019muj. Our research aims to explore the question of whether the physical properties vary continuously across the entire luminosity range. We also investigate the chemical abundance profiles and the characteristic physical quantities of the ejecta, followed by tests of the predictions of hydro simulations. The pseudo-bolometric light curve was calculated using optical and UV (Swift UVOT ) light curves and fits with a radiation diffusion Arnett model to constrain the average optical opacity, ejected mass, and initial nickel mass produced in the explosion. We analyzed the color evolution of SN 2022xlp and compared it with that of other Iax supernovae with different peak luminosities. We used the spectral tomography method to determine the radial profiles of physical properties and abundances of the ejecta, comparing them with a set of hydrodynamic pure deflagration models. The estimated bolometric flux peaks at $8.87\times 10^{41}$ erg/s and indicates the production of radioactive nickel as $M(^{56}$Ni) = $0.0215 \pm 0.009\,M_{\odot}$. According to the best-fit model, the explosion energy is $(2.066 \pm 0.236) \times 10^{49}$ erg and the ejecta mass is $0.142 \pm 0.015\,M_{\odot}$. The performed spectral tomography analysis shows that the determined physical quantities agree well with the predictions of the deflagration simulations, with modifications regarding the increased Na abundance and the more massive outer layers. SN 2022xlp bridges the previously existing luminosity gap, and supports the assumption of continuous variation in the physical properties across the SN Iax subclass.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS at 3.8 au show an elongated coma similar to a cometary tail but pointing in the direction of the Sun. This type of anti-tail, not a result of perspective, may not have been previously observed. We explain the anti-tail as an anisotropic extension of the snow line, or survival radius of a sublimating ice grain, in the direction of the Sun. The anisotropy is due to the difference in the sublimation mass flux in the solar and perpendicular directions caused by the change in the illumination angle of the cometary surface. The stronger sublimation mass flux in the solar direction results in ice grains with larger sizes, longer sublimation lifetimes, and a snow line at a larger radial distance with respect to other directions. The observed radial surface brightness profiles as a function of illumination angle are well reproduced by a Haser-type spherical outflow with constant velocity and sublimating ice grains with angularly dependent survival lengths.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves play a key role in heating the solar corona and driving the solar wind. Recent observations have shown the presence of slow magneto-acoustic and Alfvénic waves in polar plumes and inter-plumes. However, a complete understanding of wave dynamics in the polar regions has long been limited by the lack of simultaneous, high-resolution observations. In this study, we utilize high spatial (210 km per pixel) and high cadence (5s) dataset from the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) aboard Solar Orbiter, acquired on 14 September 2021. Our findings reveal the simultaneous presence of slow magneto-acoustic and Alfvénic waves within the same polar plumes. For slow magneto-acoustic waves, the amplitudes of propagating disturbances are 1.4 to 3.2$\%$ of background intensity, with periodicities of 9 min, and the projected speed of these disturbances ranges between 115 to 125 kms$^{-1}$. The corresponding electron temperature in plumes ranges between 0.58 and 0.69 MK. The damping length of these propagating disturbances for five plumes is $\approx$2.4 to 7.1 Mm. The propagating disturbances are also detected in the fine-scale substructures within the plumes. Alfvénic waves, on the other hand, are detected with average displacement amplitude, periodicity, and velocity amplitudes of 165$\pm$82 km, 93$\pm$39 s, and 12$\pm$7 kms$^{-1}$ respectively. The ranges for displacement amplitude, period, and velocity amplitude are 50-600 km, 50-250 s, and 3-32 kms$^{-1}$ respectively. These results mark the first demonstration of Solar Orbiter/EUI's ability to simultaneously detect both slow magneto-acoustic and Alfvénic wave modes extending up to 20 Mm in polar plumes.

 - **Abstract**
 NGC 5253 is a nearby (D=3.6 Mpc) Blue Compact Dwarf galaxy, notable for its three massive young super star clusters (SSCs) and nitrogen enrichment. Its similarity to extreme star-forming galaxies at high redshift makes it a good local analogue for studying chemical enrichment at high spatial resolution. We characterise the ionised gas and dust in the giant HII region in the proximity of the three SSCs in the centre of NGC 5253 using new Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer Narrow Field Mode adaptive optics-assisted data at unprecedented spatial resolution of 0."15$\sim$2.3 pc. We derive the attenuation for the central SSCs and, for the first time, map the extinction parameter ($R_V$) in an extragalactic object. $R_V$ varies among SSCs, suggesting differences in dust physics. Electron temperature and density diagnostics yield flat temperature distributions $T_\mathrm{e,median}$([NII])$=12000 \pm 1700$ K and $T_\mathrm{e,median}$([SIII])$ = 11000 \pm 600$ K, and a structured $n_e$([SII]) of maximum $1930 \pm 40$ cm$^{-3}$. The direct method gives a flat helium abundance ($10^3y^+ = 81 \pm 4$) and uniform oxygen abundance ($12 + \log(\text{O/H}) = 8.22 \pm 0.05$). N/O shows a factor 2-3 enhancement around the SSCs, mapped here for the first time at such high spatial resolution. The total excess nitrogen mass is $\sim$0.3 $M_\odot$, which we estimate is producible by the observed WN-type Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. Because there is no direct spatial overlap between the enrichment and WR star positions, the N-rich material appears to have been expelled from the original sites.
#### The Role of Magnetospheric Rebound in Breaking Resonant Chains of Super-Earths and Mini-Neptunes

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar magnetic fields are thought to truncate the inner regions of protoplanetary disks around T Tauri stars, creating a magnetospheric cavity near the star. As the disk evolves and disperses, the truncation radius is expected to move outward as the balance between magnetic and viscous forces shifts. Planets migrating inward can become trapped near the inner edge, but as the edge itself moves outward, the evolving disk torques can drive planets to migrate outward as well. We employ N-body simulations to assess the influence of magnetospheric cavity expansion on the dynamical evolution and orbital architectures of compact resonant chains of super-Earths and mini-Neptunes. Our results show that rebound-driven expansion of the disk's inner edge plays a pivotal role in destabilizing resonant chains by spreading planetary systems outward, thereby triggering early dynamical instabilities and giant impacts. Despite this dynamical evolution, key observable properties of close-in planetary systems -- such as the distribution of orbital period ratio, the intra-system similarity in planet sizes (``radius uniformity''), and the bimodal distribution of planet radii known as the ``radius valley'' -- remain largely consistent with those of systems formed without the rebound effect, in which the inner edge of the disk remains fixed. Thus, the primary consequence of the rebound appears to be the early disruption of resonant chains, rather than any significant alteration to the statistical properties of the resulting super-Earth and mini-Neptune populations.

 - **Abstract**
 We measure and compare the size of the dusty torus with active galactic nucleus (AGN) luminosity and the size of the broad-line region (BLR), using a sample of 182 AGNs with the best H$\beta$ lag measurements. After correcting for accretion-disk contamination, torus sizes are determined from the time lags of the WISE W1 and W2 band light curves relative to the optical band variability based on the interpolated cross-correlation function (ICCF) analysis and the Multiple and Inhomogeneous Component Analysis (MICA). We find that the torus size from the W1-band (W2-band) tightly correlates with the 5100~Å continuum luminosity with an intrinsic scatter of 0.15-0.16 dex and the best-fit slope of $0.35 \pm 0.03$ ($0.33 \pm 0.03$), which is clearly shallower than the expected 0.5 slope from the sublimation radius-luminosity relation. We find a moderate negative trend that higher Eddington AGNs tend to have smaller torus sizes than expected from the best-fit, suggesting the Eddington ratio plays a role in flattening the torus size-luminosity relation. By comparing the torus size with the H$\beta$ reverberation time lag for a subsample of 67 AGNs, we find that the torus size is a factor of $\sim 10$ and $\sim 14$ larger than the BLR size, respectively for W1 and W2 bands. The torus size based on the W1 (W2) band correlates with the BLR size with the best-fit slope of $1.26 \pm 0.17$ ($1.10 \pm 0.16$), which is comparable but slightly steeper than a linear correlation.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) and star formation rates (SFRs) across cosmic time in the COLIBRE simulations of galaxy formation. COLIBRE includes a multiphase interstellar medium, radiative cooling rates coupled to a model for the evolution of dust grains, and employs prescriptions for stellar and AGN feedback calibrated to reproduce the $z=0$ observed GSMF and stellar mass - size relation. We present the evolution of the GSMF from simulations at three resolutions: $m_{\rm gas}\approx m_{\rm dm}\sim 10^7$, $10^6$, and $10^5~\mathrm{M_\odot}$, in cosmological volumes of up to $400^3$, $200^3$, and $50^3$ cMpc$^3$, respectively. We demonstrate that COLIBRE is consistent with the observed GSMF over the full redshift range for which there are observations to compare with ($0<z<12$), with maximum systematic deviations of $\approx 0.3$ dex reached at $2<z<4$. We also examine the evolution of the star-forming main sequence, cosmic SFR density, stellar mass density, and galaxy quenched fraction, making predictions for both the fiducial COLIBRE model with thermally-driven AGN feedback and its variant with hybrid (thermal + kinetic jet) AGN feedback, and finding good agreement with observations. Notably, we show that COLIBRE matches the number density of massive quiescent galaxies at high redshifts reported by JWST, while predicting a stellar-to-halo mass relation that evolves little with redshift. We conclude that neither a redshift-dependent star formation efficiency, nor a variable stellar initial mass function, nor a deviation from $\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$ is necessary to reproduce the high-redshift JWST stellar masses and SFRs.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational lensing of gravitational waves (GWs) can be leveraged to provide early-warning times of $\mathcal{O}({\rm hours})$ to $\mathcal{O}({\rm days})$ before the merger of Binary Neutron Stars (BNSs) and Neutron Star Black Holes (NSBHs). This in turn could enable electromagnetic (EM) telescopes to capture emissions surrounding the time of the merger. In this work, we assess the practicability of lensing-driven early-warning by analysing optical images of the lensed host galaxy to predict the arrival time of subsequent BNS/NSBH signals following the observation of the first signal. We produce mock lenses with image quality and resolution similar to images taken with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and the ground-based Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) on the Subaru telescope. We compare the time delay uncertainties between these two cases for typical lensed image configurations and multiplicity. These include doubles and quads, and among quads: the fold, cusp, cross image configurations. We find that time delay uncertainties for doubles are comparable for both HST and HSC mocks. On the other hand, quads tend to provide accurate time-delay predictions (typical relative error $\sim0.1$) with HST. Analysis of a real lens led to a difference in time-delay estimates of $\mathcal{O}(\rm days)$ between the predictions derived from HST and HSC data. Our work therefore strongly advocates the need for high-resolution EM observations of lensed host galaxies to feasibly enable lensing-driven early-warning.
