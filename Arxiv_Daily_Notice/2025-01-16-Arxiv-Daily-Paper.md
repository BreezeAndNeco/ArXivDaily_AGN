 - **Abstract**
 A high-precision calibration method for all-sky cameras has been realized using images from the Ali observatory in Tibet, providing application results for atmospheric extinction, night sky brightness, and known variable stars. This method achieves high-precision calibration for individual all-sky images, with the calibration process introducing deviations of less than 0.5pixels. Within a 70-degree zenith angle, the calibration deviation of the images is less than 0.25pixels. Beyond this angle, the calibration deviation increases significantly due to the sparser distribution of stars. Increasing the number of stars with zenith angles greater than 70degrees used for calibration can improve the calibration accuracy for areas beyond the 70-degree zenith angle, reducing the calibration deviation at an 85-degree zenith angle to 0.2pixels. Analysis of the all-sky images indicates that the atmospheric extinction coefficient at the Ali Observatory is approximately 0.20, and the night sky background brightness is about 21 magnitudes per square arcsecond, suggesting the presence of urban light pollution.

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of nebular HeII-emission in both local and high-redshift galaxies remains an unsolved problem. Various theories have been proposed to explain it, including HeII-ionization by high mass X-ray binaries, ultra-luminous X-ray sources, or "stripped" He stars, shock ionization, and hidden AGNs. All these theories have shortcomings, however, leaving the cause of nebular HeII emission unclear. We investigate the hypothesis that the photons responsible for driving nebular HeII emissions are produced by the evolution of single massive stars and/or WR stars. We combine models of stellar evolution with population synthesis and nebular models to identify the most favorable scenarios for producing nebular HeII via this channel. We find that, if WR winds are clumpy enough to become close to optically thin, stellar populations with a wide range of metallicities and rotation rates can produce HeII ionizing photons at rates sufficient to explain the observed nebular $I(HeII)/I(\mathrm{H}\beta)$ ratio $\sim 0.004-0.07$ found in HeII-emitting galaxies. Metal-poor, rapidly rotating stellar populations ($[\mathrm{Fe}/\mathrm{H}]=-2.0$, $v/v_\mathrm{crit}=0.4$) also reach these levels of HeII production even for partially clumpy winds. These scenarios also yield HeII, H$\beta$, and "Blue-Bump" line equivalent widths comparable to those observed in HeII emitters. Only for laminar, non-clumpy winds, do we fail to find combinations of metallicity and stellar rotation rate that yield $I(HeII)/I(\mathrm{H}\beta)$ values as high as those observed in HeII-emitters. Contrary to previous findings, we conclude that single WR stars can be a strong source for nebular HeII emission if their winds are sufficiently clumpy allowing significant escape of hard ionizing photons.
#### PSZ2 G181.06+48.47 II: radio analysis of a low-mass cluster with exceptionally-distant radio relics

 - **Abstract**
 We report upgraded Giant Metrewave radio telescope and Karl J. Jansky Very Large Array radio observations of a low-mass merging galaxy cluster PSZ2 G181.06+48.47. This exceptional galaxy cluster hosts two megaparsec-scale diffuse sources, symmetrically located with respect to the cluster center and separated by about 2.6 Mpc. We detect these low surface brightness sources in our new high-frequency observations (0.3-2 GHz) and classify them as radio relics associated with merger-driven shock fronts. The southwest relic exhibits an inverted morphology and shows evidence of spectral steepening in the post-shock region, potentially tracing a high Mach number shock ($\sim 4$) under the framework of diffusive shock acceleration. The northeast relic is found to be highly polarized with a 22% average polarization fraction at 1.5 GHz and aligned magnetic field vectors. Its spectral and polarization properties, along with the presence of a nearby tailed galaxy, support re-acceleration scenarios. The merger axis defined by the two relics is tilted by $\sim 45$ degree with respect to the plane of the sky, which implies an unprecedented projected separation of $\sim 3.5$ Mpc. We also detect a possible faint radio halo, suggesting weak turbulence in the central cluster region. We conclude that the faint double relics can be best explained by two outward moving shock waves in which particles are (re-)accelerated and that the cluster is in an evolved merger state. PSZ2 G181.06+48.47 presents a unique opportunity to investigate particle acceleration in low mass systems characterized by large relic separations.

 - **Abstract**
 Aims. To investigate the magnetic field geometry and waves in the region near the Sun where the heliospheric current sheet is formed. Methods. One good example of apparent open and closed field lines was found and its fields and plasmas were analyzed. Results. The radial component of the magnetic field (the Z-component) measured on the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) changed sign between 12:00 and 13:00 UT on March 30, 2024, when the spacecraft was at 13 solar radii. This sign change may have occurred because the spacecraft crossed the heliospheric current sheet on long open magnetic field lines or it may have occurred because the spacecraft crossed from one side of the equator to the other on much shorter closed magnetic field lines. During this crossing, two distinct regions having different magnetic field geometries, strahl flows, plasma densities, and electric field spectra were observed and identified as regions with open and closed magnetic field lines, respectively. The two regions intermingled on time scales less than 100 milliseconds to create a complex magnetic field geometry. The waves observed in both regions were electrostatic and composed of wide band signatures (in the open field lines regions) and well-structured frequency harmonics (in both the open and closed field lines regions). These harmonic frequencies correlated with the proton plasma frequency, fpp, with the lowest frequency at ~0.1fpp. This result plus the field aligned electric field perturbations and plasma density fluctuations, require that the observed intense electrostatic mode and associated harmonics were ion acoustic waves. The absence of broadband electrostatic signals in closed field line regions is explained by the lower (than in open field line regions) hot and core electron density and higher ratio of the electron plasma frequency to the electron gyrofrequency, suppressing wave generation.

 - **Abstract**
 High-resolution transmission spectroscopy of the warm gas-giant WASP-69b has revealed the presence of H2O, CO, CH4, NH3, and C2H2 in its atmosphere. This study investigates the impact of vertical diffusion and photochemistry on its atmospheric composition, with a focus on the detected species plus HCN and CO2, to constrain the atmospheric C/O ratio. We utilize non-equilibrium gas-phase simulations to conduct a parameter study for vertical diffusion strength, local gas temperature, and C/O ratio. Our results indicate that a carbon-rich atmosphere enhances CH4 and C2H2 concentrations, while NH3 undergoes chemical conversion into HCN in carbon-rich, high-temperature environments. Consequently, HCN is abundantly produced in such atmospheres, though its strong spectral features remain undetected in WASP-69b. Photochemical production of HCN and C2H2 is highly sensitive to vertical diffusion strength, with weaker diffusion resulting in higher concentrations. Cross-correlation of synthetic spectra with observed data shows that models with C/O=2 best match observations, but models with C/O=0.55 and 0.9 lead to statistically equivalent fits, leaving the C/O ratio unconstrained. We highlight the importance of accurately modeling NH3 quenching at pressures greater than 100 bars. Models for WASP-69b capped at 100 bars bias cross-correlation fits towards carbon-rich values. We suggest that if the atmosphere of WASP-69b is indeed carbon-rich with a solar metallicity, future observations should reveal the presence of HCN.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new photometric pipeline for the detection of pre-supernova (pre-SN) emission in the Young Supernova Experiment (YSE) sky survey. The method described is applied to SN 2020tlf, a type II SN (SN II) with precursor emission in the last ~100 days before first light. We re-analyze the YSE griz-band light curves of SN 2020tlf and provide revised pre-explosion photometry that includes a robust list of confident detection and limiting magnitudes. Compared to the results of Jacobson-Galan et al. 2022a, this new analysis yields fewer total r/i/z-band pre-SN detections at phases > -100 days. Furthermore, we discourage the use of the blackbody modeling of the pre-explosion spectral energy distribution, the pre-SN bolometric light curve and the blackbody model parameters presented in Jacobson-Galan et al. 2022a. Nevertheless, binned photometry of SN 2020tlf confirms a consistent progenitor luminosity of ~10$^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$ before explosion.

 - **Abstract**
 In photometric observations, the flux averaged over the preset exposure time is usually used as the representation of an object's true flux at the middle of the exposure interval. For the study of transients and variables, it is also the default manner to build the light curves. In this work, we investigate the effect of this common practice on quantifying the photometric light curves. Our analysis shows that the flux averaged over the exposure time is not necessarily identical to the true flux so that potential bias may be introduced. The overall profile of the true light curve tends to be flattened by the exposure time. In addition, it is found that the peak position and photometric color can also be altered. We then discuss the impacts of the bias induced by exposure time on the light curves of stellar flares, periodic stars, and active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The bias can lead to an underestimate of the total fluxes of stellar flares which has been noticed in the observational data. For periodic stars that follow a sinusoidal light curve, the bias does not affect the period and peak position, but can result in the peak flux being underestimated. Meanwhile, the bias can result in steeper structure function at short timescales for AGN light curves. To obtain unbiased physical parameter estimates from the light curves, our analysis indicates that it is essential to account for this bias, particularly for transients and variables with very short timescales.

 - **Abstract**
 The large number of strong lenses discoverable in future astronomical surveys will likely enhance the value of strong gravitational lensing as a cosmic probe of dark energy and dark matter. However, leveraging the increased statistical power of such large samples will require further development of automated lens modeling techniques. We show that deep learning and simulation-based inference (SBI) methods produce informative and reliable estimates of parameter posteriors for strong lensing systems in ground-based surveys. We present the examination and comparison of two approaches to lens parameter estimation for strong galaxy-galaxy lenses -- Neural Posterior Estimation (NPE) and Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs). We perform inference on 1-, 5-, and 12-parameter lens models for ground-based imaging data that mimics the Dark Energy Survey (DES). We find that NPE outperforms BNNs, producing posterior distributions that are more accurate, precise, and well-calibrated for most parameters. For the 12-parameter NPE model, the calibration is consistently within $<$10\% of optimal calibration for all parameters, while the BNN is rarely within 20\% of optimal calibration for any of the parameters. Similarly, residuals for most of the parameters are smaller (by up to an order of magnitude) with the NPE model than the BNN model. This work takes important steps in the systematic comparison of methods for different levels of model complexity.

 - **Abstract**
 We present integral field unit observations of the Phoenix Cluster with the JWST Mid-infrared Instrument's Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MIRI/MRS). We focus this study on the molecular gas, dust, and star formation in the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG). We use precise spectral modeling to produce maps of the silicate dust, molecular gas, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the inner $\sim$50 kpc of the cluster. We have developed a novel method for measuring the optical depth from silicates by comparing the observed H$_2$ line ratios to those predicted by excitation models. We provide updated measurements of the total molecular gas mass of $2.2^{+0.4}_{-0.1} \times 10^{10}$ ${\rm M}_\odot$, which agrees with CO-based estimates, providing an estimate of the CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor of $\alpha_{\rm CO} = 0.9 \pm 0.2\,{\rm M}_{\odot}\,{\rm pc}^{-2}\,({\rm K}\,{\rm km}\,{\rm s}^{-1})^{-1}$; an updated stellar mass of $M_* = 2.6 \pm 0.5 \times 10^{10}$ ${\rm M}_\odot$; and star formation rates averaged over 10 and 100 Myr of $\langle{\rm SFR}\rangle_{\rm 10} = 1340 \pm 100$ ${\rm M}_\odot\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$ and $\langle{\rm SFR}\rangle_{\rm 100} = 740 \pm 80$ ${\rm M}_\odot\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$, respectively. The H$_2$ emission seems to be powered predominantly by star formation within the central $\sim 20$ kpc, with no need for an extra particle heating component as is seen in other BCGs. Additionally, we find nearly an order of magnitude drop in the star formation rates estimated by PAH fluxes in cool core BCGs compared to field galaxies, suggesting that hot particles from the intracluster medium are destroying PAH grains even in the centralmost 10s of kpc.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed study of the interacting triple active galactic nuclear system NGC 7733-34, focusing on stellar kinematics, ionised gas characteristics and star formation within the central region and stellar bars of both galaxies. We performed a comprehensive analysis using archival data from MUSE, HST/ACS, and DECaLS, complemented by observations from UVIT and IRSF. We identified a disc-like bulge in both NGC 7733 and NGC 7734 through 2-D decomposition. A central nuclear structure, with a semi-major axis of $\sim$1.113 kpc, was detected in NGC 7733 via photometric and kinematic analysis, confirmed by the strong anti-correlation between $V/\sigma$ and $h_{3}$, indicative of circular orbits in the centre. NGC 7734 lacks a distinct nuclear structure. The presence of disc-like bulge results in an anti-correlation between $V/\sigma$ and $h_{3}$ along with diffuse light. However, it does show higher central velocity dispersion, possibly attributed to an interaction with a smaller clump, which is likely a fourth galaxy within the system. Both galaxies demonstrate ongoing star formation, evidenced by $FUV$ and $H\alpha$ observations. NGC 7734 shows recent star formation along its bar, while NGC 7733 experiences bar quenching. The star formation rate (SFR) analysis of NGC 7734 reveals that the bar region's SFR dominates the galaxy's overall SFR. Conversely, in NGC 7733, the lack of star formation along the bar and the presence of a Seyfert 2 active galactic nuclei at the galaxy centre leave the possibility of a connection between both facts. However, it does not affect the galaxy's overall star formation. Our findings provide valuable insights into the stellar and gas kinematics, star formation processes, and active galactic nuclear feedback mechanisms in interacting galaxies hosting stellar bars.

 - **Abstract**
 Many active galaxies harbor powerful relativistic jets, however, the detailed mechanisms of their formation and acceleration remain poorly understood. To investigate the area of jet acceleration and collimation with the highest available angular resolution, we study the innermost region of the bipolar jet in the nearby low-ionization nuclear emission-line region (LINER) galaxy NGC 1052. We combined observations of NGC 1052 taken with VLBA, GMVA, and EHT over one week in the spring of 2017. For the first time, NGC 1052 was detected with the EHT, providing a size of the central region in-between both jet bases of 250 RS (Schwarzschild radii) perpendicular to the jet axes. This size estimate supports previous studies of the jets expansion profile which suggest two breaks of the profile at around 300 RS and 10000 RS distances to the core. Furthermore, we estimated the magnetic field to be 1.25 Gauss at a distance of 22 {\mu}as from the central engine by fitting a synchrotron-self absorption spectrum to the innermost emission feature, which shows a spectral turn-over at about 130 GHz. Assuming a purely poloidal magnetic field, this implies an upper limit on the magnetic field strength at the event horizon of 26000 Gauss, which is consistent with previous measurements. The complex, low-brightness, double-sided jet structure in NGC 1052 makes it a challenge to detect the source at millimeter (mm) wavelengths. However, our first EHT observations have demonstrated that detection is possible up to at least 230 GHz. This study offers a glimpse through the dense surrounding torus and into the innermost central region, where the jets are formed. This has enabled us to finally resolve this region and provide improved constraints on its expansion and magnetic field strength.
#### Complex Structure around a Circumstellar Disk Caused by Interchange Instability

 - **Abstract**
 We perform a three-dimensional nonideal magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a strongly magnetized cloud core and investigate the complex structure caused by the interchange instability. This is the first simulation that does not use a central sink cell and calculates the long term ($> 10^4$ yr) evolution even as the disk and outflow formation occur. The magnetic field dissipates inside the disk, and magnetic flux accumulates around the edge of the disk, leading to the occurrence of interchange instability. During the main accretion phase, the interchange instability occurs recurrently, disturbing the circumstellar region and forming ring, arc, and cavity structures. These are consistent with recent high-resolution observations of circumstellar regions around young protostars. The structures extend to $>1,000$ au and persist for at least 30,000 yr after protostar formation, demonstrating the dynamic removal process of magnetic flux during star formation. We find that the disk continues to grow even as interchange instability occurs, by accretion through channels between the outgoing cavities. The outflow is initially weak, but becomes strong after $\sim 10^3$ yr.

 - **Abstract**
 4U 0114+65 is a high-mass X-ray binary system formed by the luminous supergiant B1Ia, known as V{*} V662 Cas, and one of the slowest rotating neutron stars (NS) with a spin period of about 2.6 hours. This fact provides a rare opportunity to study interesting details of the accretion within each individual pulse of the compact object. In this paper, we analyze 200 ks of Chandra grating data, divided into 9 uninterrupted observations around the orbit. The changes in the circumstellar absorption column through the orbit suggest an orbital inclination of $\sim$ $40^{\circ}$ with respect to the observer and a companion mass-loss rate of $\sim$ 8.6 10$^{-7}$ solar masses yr$^{-1}$. The peaks of the NS pulse show a large pulse-to-pulse variability. Three of them show an evolution from a brighter regime to a weaker one. We propose that the efficiency of Compton cooling in this source fluctuates throughout an accumulation cycle. After significant depletion of matter within the magnetosphere, since the settling velocity is $\sim \times$ 2 times lower than the free-fall velocity, the source gradually accumulates matter until the density exceeds a critical threshold. This increase in density triggers a transition to a more efficient Compton cooling regime, leading to a higher mass accretion rate and consequently to an increased brightness.

 - **Abstract**
 Stars and planets in close systems are magnetised but the influence of magnetic fields on their tidal responses (and vice versa) and dissipation rates has not been well explored. We present exploratory nonlinear magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations of tidally-excited inertial waves in convective envelopes. These waves probably provide the dominant contribution to tidal dissipation in several astrophysical settings, including tidal circularisation of solar-type binary stars and hot Jupiters, and orbital migration of the moons of Jupiter and Saturn. We model convective envelopes as incompressible magnetised fluids in spherical shells harbouring an initially (rotationally-aligned) dipolar magnetic field. We find that depending on its strength (quantified by its Lehnert number Le) and the magnetic Prandtl number Pm, the magnetic field can either deeply modify the tidal response or be substantially altered by tidal flows. Simulations with small Le exhibit strong tidally-generated differential rotation (zonal flows) for sufficiently large tidal amplitudes, such that both the amplitude and topology of the initial magnetic field are tidally impacted. In contrast, strong magnetic fields can inhibit these zonal flows through large-scale magnetic torques, and by Maxwell stresses arising from magneto-rotational instability, which we identify and characterise in our simulations, along with the role of torsional Alfvén waves. Without tidally-driven zonal flows, the resulting tidal dissipation is close to the linear predictions. We quantify the transition Le as a function of Pm, finding it to be comparable to realistic values found in solar-like stars, such that we predict complex interactions between tidal flows and magnetic fields.
#### A Quasi-Optimal Stacking Method for Up-the-Ramp Readout Images

 - **Abstract**
 The non-destructive readout mode of a detector allows its pixels to be read multiple times during integration, generating a series of "up-the-ramp" images that keep accumulating photons between successive frames. Since the noise is correlated across these images, an optimal stacking generally requires weighting them unequally to achieve the best signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the target. Objects in the sky show wildly different brightness, and the counts in the pixels of the same object also span a wide range. Therefore, a single set of weights cannot be optimal for all cases. To keep the stacked image more easily calibratable, however, we choose to apply the same weight to all the pixels in the same frame. In practice, we find that the results of high-SNR cases degrade only slightly by adopting weights derived for low-SNR cases, whereas the low-SNR cases are more sensitive to the weights applied. We therefore propose a quasi-optimal stacking method that maximizes the stacked SNR for the case of SNR=1 per pixel in the last frame and demonstrate with simulated data that it always enhances the SNR more than the equal-weight stacking method and the ramp fitting method. Furthermore, we give an estimate of the improvement of limiting magnitudes for the China Space Station Telescope (CSST) based on this method. Compared with the conventional readout mode, which is equivalent to taking the last frame of the non-destructive readout, stacking 30 up-the-ramp images can improve the limiting magnitude by about 0.5 mag for CSST near-infrared observations, effectively reducing the readout noise by about 62%.
#### Discovery of a years-delayed radio flare from an unusually slow-evolved tidal disruption event

 - **Abstract**
 SDSS J1115+0544 is a unique low-ionization nuclear emission-line region (LINER) galaxy with energetic ultraviolet (UV), optical and mid-infrared outbursts occurring in its nucleus. We present the results from an analysis of multi-wavelength photometric and radio follow-up observations covering a period of ~9 years since its discovery. We find that following a luminosity plateau of ~500 days, the UV/optical emission has decayed back to the pre-outburst level, suggesting that the nuclear outburst might be caused by a stellar tidal disruption event (TDE). In this case, SDSS J1115+0544 could be an unusually slow-evolved optical TDE with longest rise and decline time-scales ever found. Three years later than the optical peak, a delayed radio brightening was found with a 5.5 GHz luminosity as high as ~1.9x10^39 erg/s. Using a standard equipartition analysis, we find the outflow powering the radio emission was launched at t~1260 days with a velocity of beta<~0.1 and kinetic energy of E_K~>10^50 erg. The delayed radio brightening coupled with the disappearing plateau in the UV/optical light curves is consistent with the scenario involving delayed ejection of an outflow from a state transition in the disk. SDSS J1115+0544 is the first TDE displaying both a short-lived UV/optical plateau emission and a late-time radio brightening. Future radio observations of these TDEs in the post-plateau decay phase will help to establish the connection between outflow launching and changes in accretion rate.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic spherules have largely been classified into S-, I-, and G-types according to their compositions, and are identified to have chondritic or achondritic materials as precursors. A recent recovery expedition attempted to sample fragments of the CNEOS 2014-01-08 bolide retrieved roughly 850 magnetic particles, some of which have unknown origins. Among those identified were a new group of highly differentiated materials consisting of close to 160 specimens categorized as "D-type" particles. We studied the D-type particles with the goal of comparing their various morphological features to their chemical compositional groupings. Four morphological classifications are considered: "scoriaceous," "stubby," "blocky," and "vesicular." The specimens from the "scoriaceous" and "stubby" groups exhibit a spinel/magnetite rim in at least one instance, characteristic of atmospheric entry, and textures indicative of quenching such as dendritic microcrystalline structures, suggesting that a subset of specimens from these groups are candidates for materials of extraterrestrial origin. The particles exhibiting "blocky" and "vesicular" textures are likely to be terrestrial in origin, with no obvious quench features or signs of ablation. The D-type particles identified and characterized in this study have a spectrum of terrestrial and probable extraterrestrial origins.

 - **Abstract**
 At the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics, participants of the rapid response workshop on the gravitational wave background explored discrepancies between experimental results and theoretical models for a background originating from supermassive black hole binary mergers. Underestimated theoretical and/or experimental uncertainties are likely to be the explanation. Another key focus was the wide variety of search methods for supermassive black hole binaries, with the conclusion that the most compelling detections would involve systems exhibiting both electromagnetic and gravitational wave signatures

 - **Abstract**
 Pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe), especially the young ones, are among the most energetic astrophysical sources in the Galaxy. It is usually believed that the spin-down energy injected from the pulsars is converted into magnetic field and relativistic electrons, but the possible presence of proton acceleration inside PWNe cannot be ruled out. Previous works have estimated the neutrino emission from PWNe using various source catalogs measured in gamma-rays. However, such results rely on the sensitivity of TeV gamma-ray observations and may omit the contribution by unresolved sources. Here we estimate the potential neutrino emission from a synthetic population of PWNe in the Galaxy with a focus on the ones that are still in the free expansion phase. In the calculation, we model the temporal evolution of the free-expanding PWNe and consider the transport of protons inside the PWNe. The Crab nebula is treated as a standard template for young PWNe to evaluate some model parameters, such as the energy conversion fraction of relativistic protons and the target gas density for the hadronic process, which are relevant to neutrino production. In the optimistic case, the neutrino flux from the simulated young PWNe may constitute to 5% of the measured flux by IceCube around 100 TeV. At higher energy around 1 PeV, the neutrino emission from the population highly depends on the injection spectral shape, and also on the emission of the nearby prominent sources.

 - **Abstract**
 Axion-like particles (ALPs) can be produced in the hot dense plasma of fireballs that develop in the initial stage of $\gamma$-ray burst (GRB) outflows. They can transport an enormous amount of energy away from the jet by propagating out of the fireball. The photons produced by the eventual decay of such ALPs do not reach a sufficient density to re-thermalize through pair production, preventing fireball re-emergence. Thus, the production of heavy ALPs disrupts the fireball and dims GRBs, allowing bright GRB observations to strongly constrain the existence of heavy ALPs. By adding ALP interactions to existing models of GRB fireballs, we set competitive bounds on the ALP-photon coupling down to $g_{a \gamma \gamma} \sim 4 \times 10^{-12}~{\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}}$ for ALPs in the mass range of 200 MeV - 5 GeV.

 - **Abstract**
 The orbits of short-period exoplanets are sculpted by tidal dissipation. However, the mechanisms and associated efficiencies of these tidal interactions are poorly constrained. We present robust constraints on the tidal quality factors of short-period exoplanetary host stars through the usage of a novel empirical technique. The method is based on analyzing structures in the population-level distribution of tidal decay times, defined as the time remaining before a planet spirals into its host star due to stellar tides. Using simple synthetic planet population simulations and analytic theory, we show that there exists a steady-state portion of the decay time distribution with an approximately power-law form. This steady-state feature is clearly evident in the decay time distribution of the observed short-period planet population. We use this to constrain both the magnitude and frequency dependence of the stellar tidal quality factor and show that it must decrease sharply with planetary orbital period. Specifically, with $Q_{\star}' = Q_0 (P/2 \ \mathrm{days})^{\alpha}$, we find $10^{5.5} \lesssim Q_0 \lesssim 10^7$ and $-4.33 \lesssim \alpha \lesssim -2$. Our results are most consistent with predictions from tidal resonance locking, in which the planets are locked into resonance with a tidally excited gravity mode in their host stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Black hole binary systems embedded in AGN discs have been proposed as a source of the observed gravitational waves (GWs) from LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA. Studies have indicated binary-single encounters could be common place within this population, yet we lack a comprehensive understanding of how the ambient gas affects the dynamics of these three-body encounters. We present the first hydrodynamical simulations of black hole binary-single encounters in an AGN disc. We find gas is a non-negligible component of binary-single interactions, leading to unique dynamics, including the formation of quasi-stable hierarchical triples. The gas efficiently and reliably dissipates the energy of the three-body system, hardening the triple provided it remains bound after the initial encounter. The hardening timescale is shorter for higher ambient gas densities. Formed triple systems can be hardened reliably by $2-3$ orders of magnitude relative to the initial binary semi-major axis within less than a few AGN orbits, limited only by our resolution. We calculate that the gas hardening of the triple enhances the probability for a merger by a minimum factor of $3.5-8$ depending on our assumptions. In several cases, two of the black holes can execute periapses on the order of less than $10$ Schwarzschild radii, where the dynamics were fully resolved for previous close approaches. The likelihood of these prompt mergers increases when the gas density is larger. Our results suggest that current timescale estimates (without gas drag) for binary-single induced mergers are an upper bound. The shrinkage of the triple by gas has the prospect of increasing the chance for unique GW phenomena such as residual eccentricity, dephasing from a third object and double GW mergers.
