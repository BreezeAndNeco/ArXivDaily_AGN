#### Aeos: The Impact of Pop III Initial Mass Function and Star-by-Star Models in Galaxy Simulations

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the effect of variations in the Population III (Pop III) initial mass function (IMF) and star-by-star feedback on early galaxy formation and evolution using the Aeos simulations. We compare simulations with two different Pop III IMFs: $M_\text{char} = 10 \, \mathrm{M}_\odot$ and $M_{\rm max} = 100 \, \mathrm{M}_\odot$ (Aeos10) and $M_\text{char} = 20 \, \mathrm{M}_\odot$ and $M_{\rm max} = 300 \, \mathrm{M}_\odot$ (Aeos20). Aeos20 produces significantly more ionizing photons, ionizing 30% of the simulation volume by $z \approx 14$, compared to 9% in Aeos10. This enhanced ionization suppresses galaxy formation on the smallest scales. Differences in Pop III IMF also affect chemical enrichment. Aeos20 produces Population II (Pop II) stars with higher abundances, relative to iron, of light and $\alpha$-elements, a stronger odd-even effect, and a higher frequency of carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars. The abundance scatter between different Pop II galaxies dominates the differences due to Pop III IMF, though, implying a need for a larger sample of Pop II stars to interpret the impact of Pop III IMF on early chemical evolution. We also compare the Aeos simulations to traditional simulations that use single stellar population particles. We find that star-by-star modeling produces a steeper mass-metallicity relation due to less bursty feedback. These results highlight the strong influence of the Pop III IMF on early galaxy formation and chemical evolution, emphasizing the need to account for IMF uncertainties in simulations and the importance of metal-poor Pop II stellar chemical abundances when studying the first stars.

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce the THESAN-ZOOM project, a comprehensive suite of high-resolution zoom-in simulations of $14$ high-redshift ($z>3$) galaxies selected from the THESAN simulation volume. This sample encompasses a diverse range of halo masses, with $M_\mathrm{halo} \approx 10^8 - 10^{13}~\mathrm{M}_\odot$ at $z=3$. At the highest-resolution, the simulations achieve a baryonic mass of $142~\mathrm{M}_\odot$ and a gravitational softening length of $17~\mathrm{cpc}$. We employ a state-of-the-art multi-phase interstellar medium (ISM) model that self-consistently includes stellar feedback, radiation fields, dust physics, and low-temperature cooling through a non-equilibrium thermochemical network. Our unique framework incorporates the impact of patchy reionization by adopting the large-scale radiation field topology from the parent THESAN simulation box rather than assuming a spatially uniform UV background. In total, THESAN-ZOOM comprises $60$ simulations, including both fiducial runs and complementary variations designed to investigate the impact of numerical and physical parameters on galaxy properties. The fiducial simulation set reproduces a wealth of high-redshift observational data such as the stellar-to-halo-mass relation, the star-forming main sequence, the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation, and the mass-metallicity relation. While our simulations slightly overestimate the abundance of low-mass and low-luminosity galaxies they agree well with observed stellar and UV luminosity functions at the higher mass end. Moreover, the star-formation rate density closely matches the observational estimates from $z=3-14$. These results indicate that the simulations effectively reproduce many of the essential characteristics of high-redshift galaxies, providing a realistic framework to interpret the exciting new observations from JWST.
#### Chronology of our Galaxy from Gaia colour-magnitude diagram fitting (ChronoGal) -- III. Age and metallicity distribution of Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus stars near the Sun

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus is considered the last major merger that contributed to the formation of the Milky Way. Its remnants dominate the nearby accreted stellar halo of the Milky Way. Aim. We aim to characterise the star formation history of Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus through the age and metallicity of its stellar populations. Methods. From Gaia DR3 data, we dynamically define three Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus samples with different criteria and possible degrees of contamination from other substructures in the halo. Then, we derive the stellar age and metallicity distributions using the this http URL package. Results. We identify three main populations of stars and a fourth smaller one following an almost linear age-[M/H] relation. The three oldest populations correspond to the bulk of the star formation that lasted for, at least, $\sim$3-4 Gyr and ended about 10 Gyr ago, its metallicities ranging from $-$1.7 to $-$0.8. We categorise these populations into two main epochs: the evolution of GSE in isolation and the merger event. This separation finds independent support from the age-metallicty relation of GSE globular clusters (Aguado-Agelet et al., subm.). The fourth population is younger and more metal-rich, at $\sim$8.5 Gyr and [M/H]$\sim-0.4$; its link to GSE is unclear.
#### JWST + ALMA ubiquitously discover companion systems within $\lesssim18\,$kpc around four $z$$\approx$3.5 luminous radio-loud AGN

 - **Abstract**
 Mergers play important roles in galaxy evolution at and beyond Cosmic Noon ($z\sim3$). They are found to be a trigger of active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity and a process for growing stellar mass and black hole mass. High-$z$ radio galaxies (HzRGs=type-2 radio-loud AGN) are among the most massive galaxies known, and reside in dense environments on scales of tens of kiloparsecs to Megaparsecs. We present the first search for kpc-scale companions in a sample of four $z\sim3.5$ HzRGs, with many supporting datasets, using matched 0.2" resolution ALMA and JWST/NIRSpec integral field unit data. We discover a total of $\sim12$ companion systems within $\lesssim18\,$kpc across all four HzRG fields using two independent detection methods: peculiar [OIII]$4959,5007$ kinematics offset from the main (systemic) ionized gas component and [CII]$158\rm \mu m$ emitters. We examine the velocity fields of these companions and find evidence of disk rotation along with more complex motions. We estimate the dynamical masses of these nearby systems to be $M_{\rm dyn}\sim10^{9-11}\,M_{\odot}$, which may indicate a minor merger scenario. Our results indicate that these companions may be the trigger of the powerful radio-loud AGN. We discuss the roles of the discovered companion systems in galaxy evolution for these powerful jetted AGN and indicate that they may impede jet launch and deflect the jet.

 - **Abstract**
 Clusters of galaxies have proven to be efficient systems in modifying various properties of galaxies, such as star formation or morphology. However, projection effects impose serious challenges in determining how, when, and to what extent galaxies are affected by the cluster environment. Using innovative techniques to classify galaxies based on their history within the cluster, we aim to determine how galaxies of different classes are affected by the cluster environment. We applied the ROGER code to select trajectories of galaxies in the phase space for 35 galaxy clusters from the OmegaWINGS survey. A new algorithm was applied to minimize contamination effects. We found that both morphological transformation and the quenching of star formation begin shortly after galaxies enter the cluster. Even though over the last $2-3$ Gyr, galaxies entering clusters have undergone significant transformations in both their star formation and morphology these transformation processes are not complete, that is, they are not completely quenched and are not early type yet. Backsplash galaxies and recent infallers show a higher fraction of jellyfish galaxies compared to older cluster members, suggesting that the timescale of this phenomenon is typically less than 3 Gyr.

 - **Abstract**
 Emission-line regions are key to understanding the properties of galaxies, as they trace the exchange of matter and energy between stars and the interstellar medium (ISM). In nearby galaxies, individual nebulae can be identified as HII regions, planetary nebulae (PNe), supernova remnants (SNR), and diffuse ionised gas (DIG) with criteria on single or multiple emission-line ratios. However, these methods are limited by rigid classification boundaries, the narrow scope of information they are based upon, and the inability to account for line-of-sight nebular superpositions. In this work, we use artificial neural networks to classify these regions using their optical spectra. Our training set consists of simulated spectra, obtained from photoionisation and shock models, and processed to match observations obtained with MUSE. We evaluate the performance of the network on simulated spectra for a range of signal-to-noise (S/N) levels and dust extinction, and the superposition of different nebulae along the line of sight. At infinite S/N the network achieves perfect predictive performance, while as the S/N decreases, the classification accuracy declines, reaching an average of ~80% at S/N(H$\alpha$)=20. We apply our model to real spectra from MUSE observations of the galaxy M33, where it provides a robust classification of individual spaxels, even at low S/N, identifying HII regions and PNe and distinguishing them from SNRs and diffuse ionized gas, while identifying overlapping nebulae. We then compare the network's classification with traditional diagnostics and find satisfactory agreement. Using activation maximisation maps, we find that at high S/N the model mainly relies on weak lines (e.g. auroral lines of metal ions and He recombination lines), while at the S/N level typical of our dataset the model effectively emulates traditional diagnostic methods by leveraging strong nebular lines.

 - **Abstract**
 Jets and outflows are commonly observed in young stellar objects (YSOs), yet their origins remain debated. Using 3D non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of a circumstellar disk threaded by a large-scale open poloidal magnetic field, we identify three components in the disk-driven outflow: (1) a fast, collimated jet, (2) a less collimated, slower laminar disk wind, and (3) a magneto-rotational instability (MRI)-active disk wind that separates the former two. At high altitudes, the MRI-active wind merges with the laminar disk wind, leaving only the jet and disk wind as distinct components. The jet is powered by a novel mechanism: a lightly mass-loaded outflow driven primarily by toroidal magnetic pressure in the low-density polar funnel near the system's rotation axis. A geometric analysis of the magnetic field structure confirms that magnetic tension does not contribute to the outflow acceleration, with magnetic pressure acting as the dominant driver. While the outflow in our model shares similarities with the classical magneto-centrifugal model-such as angular momentum extraction from the accreting disk-centrifugal forces play a negligible role in jet acceleration. In particular, the flow near the jet base does not satisfy the conditions for magneto-centrifugal wind launching. Additionally, the jet in our simulation exhibits strong spatial and temporal variability. These differences challenge the applicability of rotation-outflow velocity relations derived from steady-state, axisymmetric magneto-centrifugal jet models for estimating the jet's launching radius. For the slower disk wind, vertical motion is primarily driven by toroidal magnetic pressure, while centrifugal forces widen the wind's opening angle near its base.

 - **Abstract**
 This study examines the mid-infrared properties of Giant HII (GHII) regions in the Milky Way's Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) -- Sgr B1, Sgr B2, and Sgr C -- using SOFIA-FORCAST imaging at 25 and 37 microns. It compares these mid-infrared data with previous multi-wavelength observations to explore their present star formation activity and global properties. The study identifies 77 massive young stellar object (MYSO) candidates in and around the three regions. Sgr B2 appears to host the youngest MYSOs and have much higher extinction than the other regions, containing several radio sources not detected in the mid-infrared even at 37 microns. Meanwhile, cm radio continuum regions of Sgr B1 shows remarkable correspondence to its mid-infrared emission. Sgr C has fewer confirmed MYSOs, and seems to have a higher fraction of low-mass young stellar objects and contamination from more evolved interloper/foreground stars. Derived MYSO densities are consistent with GHII regions elsewhere in the Galactic plane, though the CMZ GHII regions appear to have less prolific present star formation overall. Unlike Sgr B2, the cm continuum emission in Sgr B1 and Sgr C GHII regions appears to be absent cold dust and molecular gas, suggesting environmental differences, possibly driven by turbulence and rapid dynamical changes near the Galactic Center. Furthermore, unlike typical GHII regions, Sgr B1 and Sgr C are significantly ionized by evolved interloper stars, which likely did not form within these regions. In these ways, Sgr B1 and Sgr C deviate from classical GHII region behavior, thus potentially representing a new category of GHII region or challenging their classification as GHII regions.

 - **Abstract**
 We present JWST NIRSpec integral field spectroscopy observations of the z=5.89 quasar NDWFS J1425+3254 from 0.6-5.3 microns, covering the rest-frame ultraviolet and optical at spectral resolution R~100. The quasar has a black hole mass of $M_{\rm{BH}}=(1.4\substack{+3.1\\-1.0})\times10^9 M_\odot$ and an Eddington ratio $L_{\rm{Bol}}/L_{\rm{Edd}}=0.3\substack{+0.6\\-0.2}$, as implied from the broad Balmer H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ lines. We find that the quasar host has significant ongoing obscured star formation, as well as a quasar-driven outflow with velocity $6050\substack{+460\\-630}$ km/s, possibly one of the most extreme outflows in the early Universe. The data also reveals that two companion galaxies are merging with the quasar host. The north-eastern companion galaxy is relatively old and very massive, with luminosity-weighted stellar age $65\substack{+9\\-4}$ Myr, stellar mass $(3.6\substack{+0.6\\-0.3})\times10^{11} M_\odot$, and SFR $< (16.1\pm1.9) M_\odot$/yr. A bridge of gas connects this companion galaxy and the host, confirming their ongoing interaction. A second merger is occurring between the quasar host and a much younger companion galaxy to the south, with stellar age $6.7\pm1.8$ Myr, stellar mass $(1.9\pm0.4)\times10^{10} M_\odot$, and SFR $< (93\substack{+17\\-16}) M_\odot$/yr. There is also another galaxy in the field that is likely in the foreground at z=1.135, that could be gravitationally lensing the quasar with magnification $1<\mu<2$, and so <0.75 mag. Overall, the system is a "train-wreck" merger of three galaxies, with star formation and extreme quasar activity that were likely triggered by these ongoing interactions.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a systematic investigation of extremely X-ray variable active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the $\approx 5.3~{\rm deg}^2$ XMM-SERVS XMM-LSS region. Eight variable AGNs are identified with rest-frame 2 keV flux density variability amplitudes around 6-12. We comprehensively analyze the X-ray and multiwavelength data to probe the origin of their extreme X-ray variability. It is found that their extreme X-ray variability can be ascribed to changing accretion state or changing obscuration from dust-free absorbers. For five AGNs, their X-ray variability is attributed to changing accretion state, supported by contemporaneous multiwavelength variability and the absence of X-ray absorption in the low-state spectra. With new Multiple Mirror Telescope (MMT) spectra for four of these sources, we confirm one changing-look AGN. One MMT AGN lacks multi-epoch spectroscopic observations, while the other two AGNs do not exhibit changing-look behavior, likely because the MMT observations did not capture their high states. The X-ray variability of the other three AGNs is explained by changing obscuration, and they show only mild long-term optical/IR variability. The absorbers of these sources are likely clumpy accretion-disk winds, with variable column densities and covering factors along the lines of sight.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar quiet regions are divided into coronal hole regions (CH) and quiet-Sun regions (QS). The global magnetic field in CH is considered open to interplanetary space, while that in QS is closed. To constrain the solar atmosphere and solar wind model, we statistically compared CH and QS in the chromosphere by quantitatively analyzing all available high-resolution spectral data sets of polar off-limb regions taken from the entire catalog of IRIS (Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph) satellite. We extracted the characteristic quantities from the Mg II h and k line profiles and compared the dependence of those quantities on the height from the photospheric limb. The main findings are as follows. First, the integrated intensities in the Mg II k line show a steeper decrease with height in QS while they remain bright at higher altitudes in CH. Second, the unsigned line-of-sight velocities in the Mg II k line generally increase with height in both regions, although the unsigned velocities in QS increase with height stronger than CH. Third, the Mg II k line widths increase just above the limb and then decrease with height in both CH and QS but are overall larger for CH than for QS, especially at the lower altitudes. Finally, we found the ratio of the Mg II k and h lines to show a two-step increase with height in both regions. The results suggest the CH spicules are higher, and the CH chromosphere exhibits faster motions than the QS.

 - **Abstract**
 We estimate the magnitude of the bias due to non-Gaussian extragalactic foregrounds on the optimal reconstruction of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing potential and temperature power spectra. The reconstruction is performed using a Bayesian inference method known as the marginal unbiased score expansion (MUSE). We apply MUSE to a minimum variance combination of multifrequency maps drawn from the Agora publicly available simulations of the lensed CMB and correlated extragalactic foreground emission. Taking noise levels appropriate to two years of data with the SPT-3G instrument on the South Pole Telescope, we find no statistically significant bias in the MUSE reconstruction when limited to angular multipoles $\ell \leq 3000$. We find a 4.7$\sigma$ bias in the recovered lensing potential power spectrum when smaller scale modes ($\ell \leq 3500$) are included. This work is a first step toward understanding the impact of extragalactic foregrounds on optimal reconstructions of CMB temperature and lensing potential power spectra.

 - **Abstract**
 The very high energy (VHE, E $>$ $100 \mathrm~{GeV}$) $\gamma$-ray observations offer a possibility of indirectly detecting the presence of axion-like particles (ALPs). The paper focuses on detecting photon-ALP oscillations on $\gamma$-ray spectra from distant sources in astrophysical magnetic fields. Strong evidence indicates that: (1) the photon-ALP oscillations can effectively decrease the photon absorption at energies of several tens of TeV -- caused by the extragalactic background light (EBL) -- to a level able to explain better the observational data; (2) the impact of magnetic-field models in photon-ALP beams crossing several magnetized media is significant. We revisit the expected signature for the photon-ALP oscillation effects on $\gamma-\gamma $ absorption in the TeV spectra of Mrk 501. The result issues that the photon-ALP beam propagation with mass $\mathrm{m_a}\sim10^{-10} eV$ and two-photon coupling constant $\begin{aligned}g_{a\gamma}\sim0.417\times10^{-11}GeV^{-1}\end{aligned}$ crossing reasonable magnetic field scenarios considered here can roughly reproduce the observed TeV $\gamma$-ray spectra for Mrk 501.

 - **Abstract**
 We present polarization pulse profiles for 56 millisecond pulsars (MSPs) monitored by the Chinese Pulsar Timing Array (CPTA) collaboration using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). The observations centered at 1.25 GHz with a raw bandwidth of 500 MHz. Due to the high sensitivity ($\sim$16 K/Jy) of the FAST telescope and our long integration time, the high signal-to-noise ratio polarization profiles show features hardly detected before. Among 56 pulsars, the polarization profiles of PSRs J0406$+$3039, J1327$+$3423, and J2022$+$2534 were not previously reported. 80\% of MSPs in the sample show weak components below 3\% of peak flux, 25\% of pulsars show interpulse-like structures, and most pulsars show linear polarization position angle jumps. Six pulsars seem to be emitting for full rotation phase, with another thirteen pulsars being good candidates for such a 360$^\circ$ radiator. We find that the distribution of the polarization percentage in our sample is compatible with the normal pulsar distribution. Our detailed evaluation of the MSP polarization properties suggests that the wave propagation effects in the pulsar magnetosphere are important in shaping the MSP polarization pulse profiles.

 - **Abstract**
 M giants, with their distinctive properties such as high luminosity, serve as excellent indicators for mapping the structure of the Milky Way. The distance to distant M giants can be determined by using the color-magnitude relation (CMR), which is derived from color-magnitude diagrams of specific systems in previous studies. In this work, we aimed to achieve more accurate distance determination for M giants by focusing on open clusters (OCs) with a large number of member stars and thus improve the CMR. For the first time, we compiled a census of OCs harboring M giants using Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) and Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope Data Release 9. We identified 58 M giants associated with 43 OCs and obtained their astrometric and photometric parameters from Gaia DR3. Using the distances of these OCs, we derived the CMR for M giants as a linear correlation, expressed as $M_{Ks}=3.85-8.26(J-K_s$). This linear relation proved superior to the empirical distance relation in characterizing the CMR of M giants. The photometric distances of M giants derived from the CMR are consistent with the parallax distances from Gaia and known spectroscopic distances, with median deviations of 1.5% and 2.3%, respectively. Using the distances of M giants derived from the CMR, we computed their radial velocity ($V_R$), azimuthal velocity ($V{\phi}$), and vertical velocity ($V_Z$), respectively. The distributions of these velocities revealed key features of the Galactic disk, including oscillation, north-south rotational asymmetry, and warp. These findings are consistent with previous studies and further validate the reliability of the derived CMR.

 - **Abstract**
 COCOA (COmpact COmpton cAmera) is a next-generation, cost-effective gamma-ray telescope designed for astrophysical observations in the MeV energy range. The detector comprises a scatterer volume employing the LiquidO detection technology and an array of scintillating crystals acting as absorber. Surrounding plastic scintillator panels serve as a veto system for charged particles. The detector's compact, scalable design enables flexible deployment on microsatellites or high-altitude balloons. Gamma rays at MeV energies have not been well explored historically (the so-called "MeV gap") and COCOA has the potential to improve the sensitivity in this energy band by up to two orders of magnitude.

 - **Abstract**
 Dust is a fundamental component of the interstellar medium (ISM) within galaxies, as dust grains are highly efficient absorbers of UV and optical photons. Accurately quantifying this obscuration is crucial for interpreting galaxy spectral energy distributions (SEDs). The extinction curves in the Milky Way (MW) and Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) exhibit a strong feature known as the 2175A UV bump, most often attributed to small carbonaceous dust grains. This feature was recently detected in faint galaxies out to z~7 suggesting rapid formation channels. Here we report the detection of a strong UV bump in a luminous Lyman-break galaxy at z = 7.11235, GNWY-7379420231, through observations taken as part of the NIRSpec Wide GTO survey. We fit a dust attenuation curve that is consistent with the MW extinction curve within 1{\sigma}, in a galaxy just ~700 Myr after the Big Bang. From the integrated spectrum, we infer a young mass-weighted age (t* ~ 22-59 Myr) for this galaxy, however spatially resolved SED fitting unveils the presence of an older stellar population (t* ~ 252 Myr). Furthermore, morphological analysis provides evidence for a potential merger. The underlying older stellar population suggests the merging system could be pre-enriched, with the dust illuminated by a merger-induced starburst. Moreover, turbulence driven by stellar feedback in this bursty region may be driving PAH formation through top-down shattering. The presence of a UV bump in GNWY-7379420231 solidifies growing evidence for the rapid evolution of dust properties within the first billion years of cosmic time.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic-ray detection with radio antennas has traditionally depended on external triggers from particle detectors, constraining sensitivity and increasing complexity. Previous attempts at fully standalone, radio-only triggers have often failed under intense radio frequency interference, making genuine air-shower signals difficult to isolate. We present a proof-of-principle artificial intelligence-based self-triggering system that overcomes these limitations. By training a deep learning model on both real noise data and injected cosmic-ray-like pulses, we achieve an exceptionally low false-positive rate alongside high detection efficiency. Configurable operating points can suppress false positives below 0.01\% while retaining more than 88\% of genuine signals, and can even eliminate false positives entirely at a modest reduction in signal efficiency. This flexibility makes single-station cosmic-ray detection feasible without requiring external trigger inputs. Applying our approach to real-world noise conditions reduces the initial false-positive event rate by several orders of magnitude, supporting large-scale deployments. Extrapolation to dedicated hardware implementations, such as FPGAs, indicates that sub-\SI{}{\micro\second} inference times are achievable, enabling real-time autonomous triggering. These results highlight the transformative potential of artificial intelligence for enhancing radio detection sensitivity and inaugurate a new generation of fully self-triggered cosmic-ray observatories.

 - **Abstract**
 UX Orionis stars are the most active young stars; they undergo sporadic fadings of 2 - 4 magnitudes in the V-band, due to variable circumstellar extinction caused by a nearly edge-on star-disc system. The long-lasting monitoring of a number of stars of this type with the Nordic Optical Telescope from 2019 to 2024 has given a rich collection of material of high-resolution (R ~ 25000) spectra obtained during different brightness states of the stars. In this paper, we present the results of observations for UX Ori itself. Until now only one spectrum of high resolution had been obtained for this star during brightness minimum, making it difficult to do a comprehensive analysis. Our aim is to analyse how different spectral lines change during such irregular fading events, when the star is going in and out of eclipses, obscured by dust along the line of sight. For this purpose we provide a comparative analysis of the profiles and equivalent widths of the spectral lines belonging to the different atoms and ions. In addition we compare the results for UX Ori with those made for another target in our sample: RR Tau. Common features of variability are revealed: 1) a strengthening of the H-alpha line relatively to the continuum during eclipses; 2) the appearance of additional emission on the frequencies of photospheric lines (e.g. Fe II, Ca II, Si II). The different behaviour of the spectral lines during fading found for UX Ori and RR Tau may be caused by two effects: a different contribution of the scattered light to the stellar flux during eclipses or a less intense disc wind of UX Ori.

 - **Abstract**
 Redback and black widow pulsars are two classes of peculiar binary systems characterized by very short orbital periods, very low mass companions, and, in several cases, regular eclipses in their pulsed radio signal. Long-term timing revealed systematic but unpredictable variations in the orbital period, which can most likely be explained by the so-called Applegate mechanism. This relies on the magnetic dynamo activity generated inside the companion star and triggered by the pulsar wind, which induces a modification of the star's oblateness (or quadrupole variation). This, in turn, couples with the orbit by gravity, causing a consequent change in the orbital period. The Applegate description limits to provide estimates of physical quantities by highlighting their orders of magnitude. Therefore, we derive the time-evolution differential equations underlying the Applegate model, that is, we track such physical quantities in terms of time. Our strategy is to employ the orbital period modulations, measured by fitting the observational data, and implementing a highly accurate approximation scheme to finally reconstruct the dynamics of the spider system under study and the relative observables. Among the latter is the magnetic field activity inside the companion star, which is still a matter of debate for its complex theoretical modeling and the ensuing expensive numerical simulations. As an application, we exploit our methodology to examine two spider sources: 47 Tuc W (redback) and 47 Tuc O (black widow). The results obtained are analyzed and then discussed with the literature.
