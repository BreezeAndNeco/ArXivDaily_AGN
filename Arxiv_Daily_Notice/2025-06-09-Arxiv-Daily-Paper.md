#### Multi-cloud crushing -- the collective survival of cold clouds in galactic outflows

 - **Abstract**
 The ram-pressure acceleration of cold gas by hot outflows plays a crucial role in the dynamics of multiphase galactic winds. Recent numerical studies incorporating radiative cooling have identified a size threshold for idealized cold clouds to survive within high-velocity outflows. This study extends the investigation to a more complex morphology of cold gas as observed in the interstellar medium. We conduct three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of ensembles of individual spherical clouds to systematically explore under which conditions the cold clouds can survive. We find that cloud ensembles can survive collectively -- even when individual clouds, if isolated, would be rapidly destroyed. Our results indicate that, besides the morphology, factors such as tight packing, small inter-cloud distance and higher fragmentation facilitate survival. We propose a novel multi-cloud survival criterion that accounts for collective properties of the cloud system, including total gas mass and the geometric configuration based on an effective volume filling fraction of the cold gas $F_V$. This fraction is computed by constructing a composite volume from individual enclosing conical boxes aligned with the wind, incorporating spatial overlap and cloud-tail spreading. The box dimensions scale with the critical survival radius $r_{\rm crit}$ from the single-cloud criterion. We find a universal threshold $F_{V,{\rm crit}}\approx 0.24$ that robustly separates surviving from destroyed systems across diverse geometric configurations. Our findings emphasize the critical importance of initial cloud distribution and fragmentation in governing the long-term evolution and survival of cold gas structures, providing insight into observed multiphase outflows and CGM dynamics.
#### RUBIES: A Spectroscopic Census of Little Red Dots; All V-Shaped Point Sources Have Broad Lines

 - **Abstract**
 The physical nature of Little Red Dots (LRDs) - a population of compact, red galaxies revealed by JWST - remains unclear. Photometric samples are constructed from varying selection criteria with limited spectroscopic follow-up available to test intrinsic spectral shapes and prevalence of broad emission lines. We use the RUBIES survey, a large spectroscopic program with wide color-morphology coverage and homogeneous data quality, to systematically analyze the emission-line kinematics, spectral shapes, and morphologies of $\sim$1500 galaxies at $z > 3.1$. We identify broad Balmer lines via a novel fitting approach that simultaneously models NIRSpec/PRISM and G395M spectra, yielding 80 broad-line sources with 28 (35%) at $z > 6$. A large subpopulation naturally emerges from the broad Balmer line sources, with 36 exhibiting `v-shaped' UV-to-optical continua and a dominant point source component in the rest-optical; we define these as spectroscopic LRDs, constituting the largest such sample to date. Strikingly, the spectroscopic LRD population is largely recovered when either a broad line or rest-optical point source is required in combination with a v-shaped continuum, suggesting an inherent link between these three defining characteristics. We compare the spectroscopic LRD sample to published photometric searches. Although these selections have high accuracy, down to $\rm F444W<26.5$, only 50-62% of the RUBIES LRDs were previously identified. The remainder were missed due to a mixture of faint rest-UV photometry, comparatively blue rest-optical colors, or highly uncertain photometric redshifts. Our findings highlight that well-selected spectroscopic campaigns are essential for robust LRD identification, while photometric criteria require refinement to capture the full population.
#### Probing neutral outflows in z ~ 2 galaxies using JWST observations of Ca II H and K absorption lines

 - **Abstract**
 Using deep JWST/NIRSpec spectra from the Blue Jay survey, we perform the first systematic investigation of neutral gas content in massive galaxies at Cosmic Noon based on the Ca II H, K absorption lines. We analyze a sample of 9 galaxies at 1.8 < z < 2.8 with stellar masses > 10.6, for which we detect neutral gas absorption both in Ca II and in Na I. After removing the stellar continuum using the best-fit model obtained with Prospector, we fit the excess absorption due to neutral gas in the Ca II H, K doublet and in the Na I D doublet, together with nearby emission lines produced by ionized gas. We measure covering fractions between 0.2 and 0.9 from the Ca II H and K lines, which are spectrally well resolved in the NIRSpec R ~ 1000 observations, unlike the absorption lines in the Na I D doublet. We measure the velocity shift, velocity dispersion, and column density separately for Ca II and Na I. About half of the galaxies present blueshifted Ca II, indicative of an outflow of neutral gas, consistent with previous results based on Na I. The velocity shift and the column density measured from Ca II are correlated with those measured from Na I, implying that these absorption lines trace gas in similar physical conditions. However, the column densities are not in a 1:1 relation, meaning that the relative amount of Ca II and Na I atoms along the line of sight varies with the gas column density. After discussing possible reasons for this behavior, we derive an empirical relation between the column density of Ca II and the column density of Na I and, in a more indirect way, of neutral hydrogen H I. This calibration offers a new way to estimate the outflow mass and the mass outflow rate for the neutral phase from current and future JWST observations of massive galaxies at Cosmic Noon and beyond

 - **Abstract**
 Jellyfish galaxies are extreme examples of how galaxies can transform due to dense environmental effects. These satellite galaxies suffer from ram-pressure stripping, leading to the formation of their distinctive gaseous tails. Some recent observational studies find that jellyfish galaxies are more likely to host active galactic nuclei (AGN) compared to central galaxies of the same mass, suggesting a link between ram pressure and supermassive black hole (SMBH) accretion. We use the IllustrisTNG cosmological-magnetohydrodynamical simulations, namely TNG50 and TNG100, to explore the presence of AGN in jellyfish galaxies with $M_{\rm{stellar}}\simeq10^{9.5-10.8}\,\rm{M}_\odot$ at redshift $z=0$ from the Zooniverse "Cosmological Jellyfish" citizen-science project. Compared to central galaxies, jellyfish are more likely to host an AGN ($L_{\rm AGN}\geq10^{44}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$) particularly at high stellar masses ($M_{\rm stellar}\gtrsim10^{10}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$). Jellyfish are also more likely to host an AGN than satellites of the same mass, largely because many satellite galaxies are gas-poor and therefore have lower SMBH accretion rates. Compared to non-jellyfish satellites with similar gas content, jellyfish typically undergo stronger ram pressure and have higher central gas densities along with lower central gas sound speeds, although these effects are smaller at lower stellar masses ($M_{\rm stellar}\lesssim10^{10}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$). Together with case studies of individual galaxies, our population analysis indicates that ram pressure can play a key role in fuelling AGN activity in a large fraction of jellyfish, where gas compression can lead to intense episodes of AGN feedback and star formation. Thus, it is essential to consider both environmental and secular processes for a more complete picture of satellite galaxy evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 The hydrodynamical cosmological simulation \eagle{} is used to model the Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) of moderate X-ray luminosity active galactic nuclei (mXAGN), extending previous work using only dark matter simulations and empirical relations. By examining mergers as a triggering mechanism, we focus on halos typical of galaxy groups and cluster-like systems with masses $\geq 10^{12.75}\,{\rm M}{\odot}\,h^{-1}$. We analyze simulation data to create catalogs of central and satellite galaxies. We study their merger history we quantify the percentage of minor and major mergers in the mXAGN sample. We obtain the HOD for central and satellite mXAGN across a redshift interval from \(z=2\) to the present epoch. Our results indicate that, across most redshifts, minor mergers slightly predominate as the primary mechanism for triggering mXAGN.
#### Trinity VII. Predictions for the Observable Correlation Functions of Accreting Black Holes

 - **Abstract**
 The quasar correlation function assesses the occurrence of quasar pairs as a function of separation, which is strongly influenced by quasar host halo masses. The empirical Trinity model recently inferred the redshift-dependent relationship between supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass, galaxy mass, and halo mass, using constraints other than correlation functions (e.g., quasar luminosity functions, active galactic nuclei occupation fractions, and SMBH mass-bulge mass relations). Hence, comparing the predicted quasar correlation functions from Trinity to real observations is an important test of Trinity's inferred SMBH -- halo relation. In this work, we use a compilation of observed two-point projected and redshift-space correlation functions from $0 \leq z \leq 3.5$. We find that Trinity accurately predicts quasar correlation functions within observed error bars, although observations do not have much constraining power at lower redshifts due to smaller observable volumes and lower quasar number densities. This finding is consistent with Trinity having the correct placement of quasars within their host galaxies and dark matter halos, without requiring quasar clustering constraints during model fitting. Using Trinity, we also predict the clustering as a function of quasar bolometric luminosity, finding that existing survey uncertainties are too large to show measurable differences ($\lesssim 0.3$ dex change in bias for $10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ compared to $10^{46}$ erg s$^{-1}$ SMBHs across redshifts). This fact arises because most SMBH growth (and hence quasar luminosity) occurs in halos in a similar mass range ($10^{12}-10^{13} M_\odot$).

 - **Abstract**
 Helium-core white dwarfs (He WDs) formed through common envelope (CE) evolution offer valuable insight into binary interaction channels and compact remnant formation. Their cooling rates critically impact both detectability and age estimates in close binaries. Compared to He WDs formed via stable Roche-lobe overflow (SRLOF), those from the CE channel undergo markedly different mass-loss histories, resulting in distinct post-CE evolutionary behavior. We explore how the mass of the residual hydrogen envelope (Mh) shapes the cooling evolution of CE He WDs, focusing on the role of the bifurcation point in setting Mh and enabling residual hydrogen burning. Using the LPCODE stellar evolution code, we computed models of He WDs with masses from 0.20 to 0.42 solar masses, evolving from post-CE conditions to the white dwarf cooling track. Two evolutionary branches emerge: (i) non-flashing sequences, which cool rapidly with negligible hydrogen burning, and (ii) flashing sequences, where hydrogen shell flashes alter the envelope structure prior to cooling. Minimal-envelope models cool within 5-130 million years for effective temperatures between 12,000 and 27,000 K, and reach in approx. 300 million years at lower temperatures, remaining much younger than SRLOF counterparts. In contrast, models with more hydrogen retain active nuclear burning, delaying cooling and yielding ages of several billion years. Flashing sequences prolong the pre-white dwarf phase, though still shorter than in SRLOF evolution. The value of Mh also affects WD mass and surface gravity estimates, introducing systematic shifts with respect to SRLOF WDs. Our results show that CE He WDs follow distinct evolutionary paths, with important implications for interpreting the nature and fate of compact binaries hosting He WDs.
#### The Observations of Magnetic Reconnection During the Interaction Process of Two Active Region Filaments

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the interaction between two filaments (F1 and F2) and their subsequent magnetic reconnection in active region (AR) NOAA 13296 and AR NOAA 13293 on May 9, 2023, utilizing high spatial and temporal resolution and multi-wavelength observational data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory, the New Vacuum Solar Telescope, and the Chinese H{\alpha} Solar Explorer. The movement of F1 from the southeast toward the northwest, driven by the motion of the positive magnetic polarity (P1), leads to a collision and reconnection with F2. This reconnection exchanges their footpoints, resulting in the formation of two new filaments (F3 and F4) consistent with "slingshot" type filament interaction. During the interaction, the current sheet moving due to the motion of F1 and the reconnection outflows moving along F3 and F4 were both observed. The current sheet is rarely observed in the slingshot type filament interaction, measuring approximately 2.17 Mm in length and 0.84 Mm in width. After the interaction, the F1 disappears whereas a portion of F2 remains, indicating that the interaction involves partial slingshot reconnection, due to the unequal magnetic flux between the filaments. The residual part of F2 will undergo another magnetic reconnection in the same interaction region with the magnetic loops connecting polarities N1 and P1. The material generated by the reconnection is continuously injected into F4, leading to its final morphology. The findings enhance our understanding of slingshot-type filament interactions, indicating that partial slingshot reconnections between filaments may be more common than full slingshot events.

 - **Abstract**
 Depending on the astrophysical source and its environment, the accretion flows can exhibit a variety of behaviors and characteristics in accordance with the type of solutions. We study low-angular-momentum accretion flows onto black holes using two-dimensional general relativistic hydrodynamic (GRHD) simulations to find imprints of different types of accretion solutions. Such flows, relevant to X-ray binaries and wind-fed low-luminosity active galactic nuclei, often lack sufficient angular momentum to form standard accretion disks. We initialize simulations with semi-analytical transonic solutions defined by specific energy (${\cal E}_0$) and angular momentum ($\lambda_0$), allowing a systematic classification of flow types with: (i) an outer sonic point, (ii) an inner sonic point, and (iii) both, exhibiting shock-like transitions. Only solutions with two sonic points produce hot, thermally driven bipolar jets/outflows with Lorentz factors up to $\gamma\sim2$, despite the absence of magnetic fields. Using a general relativistic radiation transfer calculation, we compute broadband spectra and images at X-ray ($1 \, \rm keV$) from bremsstrahlung emission. Radiative properties depend strongly on the type of accretion solution. Solutions with inner sonic points produce the brightest and most extended X-ray emission, while outer-point solutions produce compact, fainter signals. These multidimensional models are thus essential for predicting radiative signatures and will enable the development of semi-analytical tools for interpreting X-ray binaries and possibly Sgr~A$^*$ in weak magnetic field regimes.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the timing results with Insight-HXMT observations of X-ray binary IGR J19294+1816 during its 2019 Type I outburst at the decline phase shortly following its peak. We analyze the light curves and power density spectrum (PDS) of the 2019 observations and reveal a peak at approximately $\nu_{NS} \sim 80.2$ mHz, corresponding to X-ray pulsations from the neutron star. In addition, a significant quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) feature is observed at around $\nu_{QPO} \sim 30.2$ mHz from 10-50 keV, with the rms amplitude increasing with energy. Furthermore, we detect two QPOs at the frequency of $\sim 51.1$ mHz and $113.7$ mHz (corresponding to sidebands near $\nu_{NS} \pm \nu_{QPO}$) in 25-50 keV, exhibiting an rms amplitude of around 12$\%$. Wavelet analysis also shows multiple QPOs at the frequency of $\sim 30$ mHz, $50$ mHz and $ 110$ mHz and these QPO features show transient behaviors, the centroid frequencies of $\sim 30$ mHz remain nearly constant for different luminosities. Our research identifies IGR J19294+1816 as the second strong magnetic-field pulsar with significant sideband signals around the spin frequency. We explore various physical origins that could explain the presence of multiple QPOs.

 - **Abstract**
 Aims. The magnetized medium induces birefringence, splitting the light into two distinct wave modes. The differing propagation speeds of the two modes result in different trajectories. Strong gravitational lensing amplifies the birefringence and introduces an additional geometric rotation on top of the Faraday rotation. We compare the geometric rotation with the Faraday rotation. Methods. We construct the lens equation for massive objects in a magnetized plasma environment, and calculate the time delay difference between the two modes using two toy examples. We present that in the strong lensed radio sources, birefringence causes geometric rotation, which is a non-negligible effect, even with a weak magnetic field. Results. In both examples, the geometric delay causes a comparable or stronger rotation than the Faraday rotation and show a similar dependence on the wavelength of the signal. For a point lens with a strong magnetic field, the two wave modes exhibit distinct behaviours. The polarization of lensed sources can provide additional insights into the magnetic field and plasma environment.

 - **Abstract**
 Axions are an elegant solution to the strong CP problem for particle physics and a promising dark matter candidate. They can convert into photons under a strong magnetic field, while magnetars with extreme magnetic fields are natural labs for axion detection. Radio telescopes can detect the radio emission from axion-photon conversion near magnetars. In this study, we have refined the calculation of axion-photon conversion and developed the matched filtering integration method to largely improve the signal-to-noise ratio. We validate our method using end-to-end simulation and real observational data from TMRT. A new constraint is set with only 687 seconds of observations with TMRT. Using 10 hours of observation with the high-frequency receiver in FAST or SKA, we can reach the theoretical coupling constant prediction for the axion mass range from 1$\mu$eV to 100$\mu$eV. We validate the possibility of axion detection with radio telescopes and avoid spectrum confusion.
#### Correlation of Burst Behaviour with Magnetar Age

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze a wide set of historical magnetar burst observations detected with five different instruments, calibrating these to the energy range of Fermi-GBM observations for consistency. We find a striking correlation between a magnetar's characteristic age and both its typical burst energy and its burst activity level. Arguing that this bursting behaviour also correlates with true age, we interpret it as the result of a reducing high-stress volume of the crust in an aging magnetar: previous giant flares cause relaxation of large regions of its crust and inhibit burst clustering, whilst the reducing burst energy reflects the progressively shallower region of the crust where Hall drift can build stresses effectively, as the field decays through the range $\sim 10^{12}-10^{13}\,\mathrm{G}$. Low-energy bursts from very young magnetars may represent failures of weak regions of the crust that have only recently solidified.
#### Simulation-based inference with neural posterior estimation applied to X-ray spectral fitting II -- High-resolution spectroscopy with the X-ray Integral Field Unit

 - **Abstract**
 X-ray spectral fitting in high-energy astrophysics can be reliably accelerated using Machine Learning. In particular, Simulation-based Inference (SBI) produces accurate posterior distributions in the Gaussian and Poisson regime for low-resolution spectra, much faster than other exact approaches such as Monte Carlo Markov Chains or Nested Sampling. We now aim to highlight the capabilities of SBI for high-resolution spectra, as what will be provided by the newAthena X-ray Integral Field Unit (X-IFU). The large number of channels encourages us to use compressed representations of the spectra, taking advantage of the likelihood-free inference aspect of SBI. Two compression schemes are explored, using either simple summary statistics, such as the counts in arbitrary bins or ratios between these bins. We benchmark the efficiency of these approaches using simulated X-IFU spectra with various spectral models, including smooth comptonised spectra, relativistic reflexion models and plasma emission models. We find that using simple and meaningful summary statistics is much more efficient than working directly with the full spectrum, and can derive posterior distributions comparable to those from exact computation using nested sampling. Multi-round inference converges quickly to the good solution. Amortized single round inference requires more simulations, hence longer training time, but can be used to infer model parameters from many observations afterwards. Information from the emission lines must be accounted for using dedicated summary statistics. SBI for X-ray spectral fitting is a robust technique that delivers well calibrated posteriors. This approach shows great promises for high-resolution spectra, offering its potential for the scientific exploitation of the X-IFU. We now plan to apply it to the current era of high-resolution telescopes, and further challenge this approach with real data.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, Zhang & Liu (2024) proposed a turbulent convection model for multiscale anisotropies of cosmic rays (CRs), with an assumption of isotropic diffusion such that the anisotropies are statistically isotropic. However, this assumption may be unrealistic for TeV CRs, whose observations have revealed the significance of the local interstellar background magnetic field. To meet the difficulty, the turbulent convection scenario needs to be extended to cover anisotropic diffusion. In this paper, we focus on the parallel diffusion with isotropic pitch-angle scattering, which may be an approximation to the transport process driven by weak hydromagnetic waves in a magnetic flux tube, where fluctuations of the wave velocities lead to the turbulent convection. The consequence is the breaking of the statistical isotropy, while the overall shape of the angular power spectrum, $ \overline{C_\ell}\propto\ell ^{-\gamma -1} $ ($ \ell\gg 1 $), remains similar to that in the isotropic diffusion model, where $ \ell $ are degrees of spherical harmonics, and $ \gamma $ is the turbulence spectral index of the convection field. It is then expected that the power-law index of the TeV CR small-scale angular power spectrum can be explained with the Kolmogorov law $ \gamma =5/3 $, irrespective of the background magnetic field to some extent.

 - **Abstract**
 The compact mm emission ubiquitously found in radio-quiet active galactic nuclei (RQ AGN) exhibits properties consistent with synchrotron radiation from a small region ($\leq$1 light day) and undergoing self-absorption below $\sim$100 GHz. Several scenarios have been proposed for its origin, including an X-ray corona, a scaled-down jet, or outflow-driven shocks, which can be tested via mm polarimetry. In the optically thin regime, synchrotron emission is expected to show polarization up to $\sim$70\%, but disordered magnetic fields and Faraday rotation reduce this to a few percent for jets and outflows, while an X-ray corona is likely to result in complete depolarization. To investigate this, we conducted the first ALMA Band 3 full-polarization observations of three RQ AGN - NGC 3783, MCG 5-23-16, and NGC 4945. No polarized signal was detected in any of the AGN, with an upper limit of 0.5-1.5\%, supporting the X-ray corona scenario. However, we detected a compact source with 17\% polarization in NGC 3783, 20 pc away from the AGN, co-spatial with the mm and narrow-line outflow, likely linked to a shock propagating through the outflowing material. Additionally, combining our data with archival ALMA observations, we found typical mm variability in RQ AGN by a factor of 2; however, the sparsity of the data prevented a more detailed analysis of the total flux variability.
#### The jet-feedback mechanism in common envelope evolution of planetary nebula progenitors

 - **Abstract**
 Using the stellar evolution code MESA, we mimic the negative jet feedback mechanism in common envelope evolution (CEE) of low-mass main sequence stars, M2=0.1-0.3Mo, spiraling inward inside the envelopes of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) or red giant branch (RGB) stars and find that the jets reduced the envelope density, therefore the jets' power, by a factor of ~0.5/(M2/0.1Mo). We mimic the energy that the jets deposit into the envelope by depositing energy into the outer envelope, a process that inflates the envelope, therefore reducing the density in the vicinity of the main sequence star, the accretion rate, and the jets' power. In deriving this expression for the negative jet feedback coefficient, we assume that the actual mass accretion rate is a fraction 0.2-0.5 of the classical Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton mass accretion rate and that the jets carry a fraction 0.25-0.5 of the accretion energy onto the main sequence star. Our study is another step in establishing the major role of jets in the onset and early phase of CEE, a possible grazing envelope evolution phase, and in transient events, such as luminous red novae, which these processes can power.

 - **Abstract**
 Leptonic one-zone radiation models are commonly used to describe multi-wavelength data and explore the physical properties of high-energy sources, such as active galactic nuclei. However, these models often require a large number of free parameters. In the context of possible parameter degeneracy and the complex landscape of the parameter space, we study how the choice of the fitting procedure impacts the characterization of the source properties. Furthermore, we examine how the data coverage and the uncertainties associated to the data influence the model parameter degeneracy. We generated simulated spectral energy distribution datasets with different properties, which we then fit with a numerical model. The model describes the relevant radiation processes with seven free parameters. We compare different optimization algorithms and study the parameter degeneracy using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding. Additionally, we applied the same fitting procedures to the observational data of two sources, Mrk 501 and PKS 0735+178. We demonstrate significant degeneracies in the seven-dimensional parameter space of the one-zone leptonic models caused by the incomplete wavelength coverage of the data. Given the same goodness-of-fit function, the best-fit result depends on the choice of the minimization algorithm. Source properties extracted from the best-fit solution to realistic datasets cannot be interpreted as the only solution due to significant degeneracies of the model parameters. Adding new energy ranges (e.g. MeV) and regular source monitoring would allow to reduce gaps in the data and significantly decrease the parameter degeneracy.

 - **Abstract**
 Propagating slow magneto-acoustic waves are commonly observed in different coronal structures but are most prominent in active region fan loops. Their rapid damping with damping lengths of the order of a wavelength has been investigated in the past by several authors. Although different physical mechanisms have been proposed, significant discrepancies between the theory and observations remain. Recent high-resolution observations captured simultaneously by two different instruments reveal distinct damping lengths for slow magneto-acoustic waves although their passbands are similar. These results suggest a possible contribution of instrumental characteristics on the measurement of damping lengths. Here, we analyse the behavior of slow waves using a different pair of instruments in order to check the prevalence of such results. In particular, the cotemporal observations of active region NOAA AR12712 by the High-Resolution Coronal Imager (Hi-C 2.1) and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) are utilised. The estimated oscillation periods of slow magneto-acoustic waves identified from these data are 2.7{\,}$\pm${\,}0.2{\,}min from SDO/AIA, and 2.8{\,}$\pm${\,}1.2{\,}min from Hi-C 2.1. The corresponding propagation speeds are found to be 46.0{\,}$\pm${\,}1.7{\,}km{\,}s$^{-1}$ and 48.1{\,}$\pm${\,}0.6{\,}km{\,}s$^{-1}$, respectively. Damping lengths were calculated by two different methods, the Phase Tracking Method (PTM) and the Amplitude Tracking Method (ATM). The obtained values from PTM are 4.0{\,}$\pm${\,}2.1{\,}Mm and 4.1{\,}$\pm${\,}0.3{\,}Mm while those from ATM are 3.4{\,}$\pm${\,}1.0{\,}Mm and 3.7{\,}$\pm${\,}0.1{\,}Mm, respectively, for the AIA and Hi-C data. Our results do not indicate any notable difference in damping lengths between these instruments.

 - **Abstract**
 Star formation and metal enrichment in galaxies are regulated by supernova (SN) explosions and metal yields from massive stars, which are sensitive to the high-mass end of the initial mass function (IMF). Recent JWST observations have reached a consensus on an invariant relation between stellar mass, metallicity, and star formation rate up to $z\sim 8$ and its breakdown at higher redshifts. It is crucial to understand the underlying physics, especially the role played by the IMF. We explore the impact of IMF on the chemical evolution of high-redshift galaxies and the interplay between IMF and galactic outflows. The ultimate goal is to constrain the high-mass end of the IMF by the cosmic star formation history and stellar mass-metallicity-star formation rate relation (MZSFR) inferred from observations at $z\sim 4-10$. Using the semi-analytical galaxy evolution code A-SLOTH, we follow galactic baryon cycles along merger trees built from cosmological simulations. Stellar feedback is modeled with up-to-date stellar evolution tracks covering the full metallicity range ($Z \sim 10^{-11} - 0.03$) and a broad stellar mass range ($m_\star\sim2 - 600\ \rm M_\odot$) including the metal yields from stellar winds, core-collapse SNe, (pulsational) pair-instability SNe, and Type Ia SNe. Assuming that the IMF follows a Kroupa-like shape with a varying upper mass limit $m_{\max}$, we find $m_{\max} \gtrsim 200\ \rm M_\odot$ is required to reproduce the observed MZSFR. Observational data at $z\gtrsim 6$ favor a galactic outflow model where the outflow mass is proportional to the ratio of supernova energy to halo binding energy. We conclude that very massive ($\gtrsim 200\ \rm M_\odot$) stars can play important roles in the star formation and chemical enrichment histories of high-$z$ galaxies. We also discuss their implications for transient sources of both electromagnetic waves and gravitational waves.

 - **Abstract**
 The interstellar hydride hydroxyl (OH) is a potential tracer of CO-dark molecular gas. We present new absorption line observations of OH at 18-cm wavelength towards four continuum sources. We compare these to the [CII] line at 1.9 THz obtained with SOFIA, observations of the neutral atomic hydrogen 21 cm line with the VLA, and CO lines obtained with APEX. We trace OH over a large range of molecular hydrogen column densities, and derive OH abundances with respect to molecular and total hydrogen column densities. Increased sensitivity and spectral resolution allowed us to detect weak and narrow features. We identify only one OH absorption component out of 23 without CO counterpart, yet several with intermediate molecular gas fractions. A potential association of [CII] 158 mu m emission with an OH absorption component is seen toward one sightline. Our results confirm that OH absorption traces molecular gas across diffuse and dense environments of the interstellar medium. At the sensitivity limits of the present observations our detection of only one CO-dark molecular gas feature appears in agreement with previous studies. We conclude that if OH absorption was to be used as a CO-dark molecular gas tracer, deeper observations or stronger background targets are necessary to unveil its full potential as a CO-dark molecular gas tracer, and yet it will never be an exclusive tracer of CO-dark molecular gas. For OH hyperfine-splitting transitions in the vicinity of photodissociation regions in W43-South, we detect a spectral and spatial offset between the peak of the inversion of the OH 1612 MHz line and the absorption of the OH 1720 MHz line on the one hand, and the absorption of the OH main lines on the other hand, which provides additional constraints on the interpretation of the OH 18 cm line signatures typical of HII regions.

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of gravitational waves (GWs) by LIGO-Virgo and pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) has opened a new window into early universe cosmology. Yet, the origin of large-scale magnetic fields and the dynamics of the reheating epoch remain poorly understood. In this work, we study the generation of secondary GWs (SGWs) sourced by primordial magnetic fields produced via a Sawtooth-type coupling during reheating with a general background evolution. We show that the reheating equation of state significantly influences the spectral shape and amplitude of the magnetic fields. While a scale-invariant spectrum is typically needed to match observational bounds, this coupling naturally produces a strongly blue-tilted spectrum that remains consistent with current constraints. Crucially, the magnetic field continues to grow during reheating, leading to a GW signal with a broken power-law spectrum and a distinctive blue tilt on super-horizon scales. This SGW signal can fall within the sensitivity of upcoming detectors such as LISA, DECIGO, and BBO. The unique spectral features make this scenario distinguishable from other sources, offering a viable mechanism for cosmic magnetogenesis and a novel probe of the reheating era through GW observations.
