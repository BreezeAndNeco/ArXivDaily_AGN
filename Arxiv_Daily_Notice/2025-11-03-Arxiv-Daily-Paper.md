 - **Abstract**
 We present jFoF, a fully GPU-native Friends-of-Friends (FoF) halo finder designed for both high-performance simulation analysis and differentiable modeling. Implemented in JAX, jFoF achieves end-to-end acceleration by performing all neighbor searches, label propagation, and group construction directly on GPUs, eliminating costly host--device transfers. We introduce two complementary neighbor-search strategies, a standard k-d tree and a novel linked-cell grid, and demonstrate that jFoF attains up to an order-of-magnitude speedup compared to optimized CPU implementations while maintaining consistent halo catalogs. Beyond performance, jFoF enables gradient propagation through discrete halo-finding operations via both frozen-assignment and topological optimization modes. Using a topological optimization approach via a REINFORCE-style estimator, our approach allows smooth optimization of halo connectivity and membership, bridging continuous simulation fields with discrete structure catalogs. These capabilities make jFoF a foundation for differentiable inference, enabling end-to-end, gradient-based optimization of structure formation models within GPU-accelerated astrophysical pipelines. We make our code publicly available at this https URL.

 - **Abstract**
 Dwarf galaxies are dark matter-dominated systems that are sensitive to feedback and display a diversity of baryonic morphologies. This makes them excellent probes for understanding dark matter and galaxy evolution. This work investigates the physical processes that influence the sizes of isolated dwarf galaxies using high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations of $39$ dwarf galaxies drawn from the Marvelous Massive Dwarfs simulation suite ($7.5 < \log(M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) < 9.1$). Our simulations show that dwarf galaxies initially form as compact galaxies ($R_e < 2$ kpc). However, several of these galaxies ($54\%$) experience periods of gradual size growth at relatively stable sSFR, allowing them to become extended galaxies. We find that the growth of rotation-supported stellar disks is the primary means by which isolated dwarfs become extended in size. These stellar disks are formed by mergers with high orbital angular momentum satellites on high angular momentum (spiraling-in) orbits, which spin up the gas surrounding the central galaxy and contribute $\approx 30 \%$ of the cold gas mass at $z=0$. For these systems, star formation in the angular momentum supported gas and the gradual build up of stars in the disk result in secular size growth.

 - **Abstract**
 The distribution of gas-phase metals within galaxies encodes the impact of stellar feedback on galactic evolution. At high-redshift, when galaxies are rapidly assembling, feedback-driven outflows and turbulence can strongly reshape radial metallicity gradients. In this work, we use the FIRE-2, SPICE, Thesan and Thesan Zoom cosmological simulations -- spanning a range of stellar feedback from bursty (time-variable) to smooth (steady) -- to investigate how these feedback modes shape gas-phase metallicity gradients at $3<z\lesssim11$. Across all models, we find that galaxies with bursty feedback (FIRE-2, SPICE Bursty, and Thesan Zoom) develop systematically flatter (factors of $\sim2-10$) metallicity gradients than those with smooth feedback (SPICE Smooth and Thesan Box), particularly at stellar masses $M_\star > 10^{9}~{\rm M_\odot}$. These results demonstrate that bursty stellar feedback provides sufficient turbulence to prevent strong negative gradients from forming, while smooth stellar feedback does not generically allow for efficient radial redistribution of metals thereby keeping gradients steep. Finally, we compare with recent observations, finding that the majority -- but, notably, not all -- of the observed gradients may favor a bursty stellar feedback scenario. In all, these results highlight the utility of high-resolution observations of gas-phase metallicity at high-redshift as a key discriminator of these qualitatively different feedback types.
#### Shooting for the stars: Jet-mode feedback and AGN jet deceleration from stellar mass-loading

 - **Abstract**
 AGN jets are thought to be vital ingredients in galaxy evolution through the action of kinetic feedback; however, how narrow, relativistic outflows couple to galaxies remains an open question. Jet deceleration, which is often attributed to the entrainment of material, such as stellar winds, is thought to be necessary for efficient coupling. We present a simple model of jet deceleration due to stellar mass-loading to investigate the energy budget of direct jet feedback in the local Universe. To this end, we produce models of stellar mass-loss, including deriving a prescription for main sequence mass-loss rates as a function of stellar population age. We pair this mass-loss data with a parametric fit for radio AGN incidence, predicting that a majority of jets are decelerated within their hosts, and generally replicate the expected FR-II fraction in LERGs. We calculate that $\gtrsim$25\% of the jet power in the local Universe is efficiently decelerated and available for direct feedback within galaxies for any stellar population age. This fraction is largely invariant to the shape of the radio AGN incidence function at low jet Eddington fractions. The stellar mass-loss rate evolves significantly over time, approximately following $\tau^{-1.1}$, leading to corresponding decreases in decelerated jet power in older stellar populations. Although asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars dominate mass-loss at all ages, we find that their stochasticity is important in low-mass galaxies, and derive a critical jet power below which main sequence stars alone are sufficient to decelerate the jet.
#### Constraining the AGN tori at cosmic noon using high-resolution JWST imaging and simultaneous SED fitting

 - **Abstract**
 There is evidence for significant evolution in the gaseous and dust properties of galaxies since the era of cosmic noon ($1\lesssim z\lesssim 2.5$). The well known co-evolution of supermassive black holes with their host galaxies suggests a constant connection between the small-scale (nuclear) and large-scale regions of galaxies. A fundamental component of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) is the "torus", a dense, dusty structure that acts as the interface between the accretion disc and the ISM of the host galaxy. The transitional nature of the torus makes it a prime subject to search for evolution since cosmic noon. We use high-resolution near- and mid-IR imaging from the JWST CEERS program to disentangle the emission from the torus in unprecedented detail for 88 X-ray selected AGN at $z\sim2$. We employ a novel SED fitting technique that combines archival low-resolution multi-band photometry at UV to FIR wavelengths with the new high-resolution JWST photometry to constrain essential AGN and torus parameters, such as accretion disc luminosity, torus opening angle, and inclination angle. We demonstrate that this SED fitting approach leads to better AGN characterisation and tighter constraints on AGN parameters. The population-level analysis finds that the Covering Fraction ($CF$) distribution peaks at $\approx0.25$ with a long tail towards higher $CF$. Despite the well-known evolution of the ISM and structural properties of AGN hosts to these redshifts, the $CF$ distribution of our sample does not show any strong statistical difference with that found in local AGN of equivalent luminosity, or with those at intermediate redshifts.
#### High$-z$ [OI] emission lines: ColdSIM simulations and ALMA observations

 - **Abstract**
 Neutral-oxygen [OI] far-infrared emission lines at $63\mu$m and $145\mu$m are powerful probes of the physical conditions in the interstellar medium, although they have not been fully exploited in high-redshift studies. We investigate the connection between [OI] emission lines and key galaxy properties, such as star formation rate (SFR) and H$_2$ content. Our predictions are compared with existing observations and new data analysed in this work. We post-process the outputs of the ColdSIM cosmological simulations with the DESPOTIC model, taking into account [OI]$63\mu$m self-absorption by cold foreground material. A Random Forest algorithm is employed to accelerate computations and new observational ALMA data for galaxies at redshift $z\simeq 5-7$ are used to validate our model. Our predictions show significant [OI]$63\mu$m luminosities ($\approx 10^8\,\rm L_\odot$) for galaxies with SFRs of $\approx 10^2\,\rm M_\odot\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$. The $145\mu$m line luminosity is typically $15 \%$ the [OI]$63\mu$m one and is a factor $\approx 2-20$ below high-$z$ observations. Both [OI] lines correlate with SFR and molecular mass, but exhibit flattening in scaling relations with metallicity and stellar mass. Foreground self-absorption reduces the [OI] flux by a factor of $2-4$, consistent with empirical corrections in observational studies. We find typical line ratios of [OI]$63\mu$m / [CII]$158\mu$m $\approx 1$ and [OI]$145\mu$m / [CII]$158\mu$m $ \approx 0.2 \, -$ consistent with $z\gtrsim 6$ observations, but only when [OI]$63\mu$m self-absorption is included. Both [OI]$63\mu$m and [OI]$145\mu$m lines serve as tracers of star formation and molecular gas at high redshift. Their joint detection can provide constraints on the properties of the early interstellar medium and self-absorption of the [OI]$63\mu$m line.

 - **Abstract**
 Dark matter subhalos and satellite galaxies in state-of-the-art cosmological simulations still suffer from the ``overmerging'' problem, where inadequate force and/or mass resolution cause artificially enhanced tidal mass loss and premature disruption. Previous idealized simulations addressing this issue have been restricted to a small subset of the subhalo orbital parameter space, and all assumed subhalos to be isotropic. Here, we present the first extensive simulation suite that quantifies numerical convergence in the tidal evolution of anisotropic subhalos under varying numerical resolutions and orbits. We report a universal force resolution criterion: the subhalo's instantaneous tidal radius must always be resolved by at least 20 cells in adaptive mesh refinement (AMR)-based simulations, or by 20 softening lengths (Plummer equivalent) in tree-based simulations, regardless of refinement details or subhalo physical properties such as concentration or velocity anisotropy. We also report a universal expression for the discreteness-noise-driven scatter in the bound-mass fraction of subhalos that depends only on the subhalo mass resolution at infall and the instantaneous bound mass fraction, agnostic of any further subhalo properties. Such stochastic discreteness noise causes both premature disruption and, notably, spurious survival of poorly mass-resolved subhalos. We demonstrate that as many as 50 percent of all subhalos in state-of-the-art cosmological simulations are likely to be either force and/or mass unresolved. Our findings advocate for adaptive softening or grid refinement based on the instantaneous tidal radius of the subhalo.
#### Can galactic magnetic fields diffuse into the voids?

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic voids are magnetized at the level of at least $10^{-17}$ G on Mpc scales, as implied by blazar observations. We show that an electrically conducting plasma is present in the voids, and that, because of the plasma, \emph{diffusion} into the voids of galactic fields generated by a mean-field dynamo is far too slow to explain the present-day void magnetization. Indeed, we show that even in the presence of turbulence in the voids, dynamo-generated galactic fields diffuse out to a galactocentric radius of only 200-400 kpc. Therefore, it is challenging to meet the required volume filling-factor of the void magnetic field. We conclude that a primordial origin remains the most natural explanation to the space-filling weak fields in voids.
#### Observation and Modeling of Shear Evolution of Post-reconnection Flare Loops

 - **Abstract**
 A solar flare releases magnetic energy by reconnecting field lines across a current sheet, thereby allowing their relaxation to a lower energy state. The maximum possible energy is released if all field lines relax to a current-free (potential) state. The progress of a flare's reconnection is often measured as the angle-complement between the observed post-reconnection flare loops and the polarity inversion line of the photospheric magnetic field: shear angle. Many observations have shown strong-to-weak shear evolution over the course of a flare. A field line's shear angle is, however, an imperfect measure of its relaxation. We develop a new technique for observationally inferring the three-dimensional structure of post-reconnection field lines, including their local twist, $\alpha$, which will vanish for potential fields. Our method fits loops in EUV images to extrapolations subject to constraints such as matching the feet of model field lines to observed flare ribbons. We apply the new method to an eruptive two-ribbon flare (SOL2014-12-18T22) which exhibits strong-to-weak shear-angle evolution. We find that, as the flare progresses, $\alpha$ decreases in post reconnection loops anchored to newly brightened ribbons. Our study demonstrates that post-reconnection magnetic field is neither potential nor linear force-free. The method quantifies, for the first time, the time-history of a flare's energetic relaxation. It also quantifies the increasing height of subsequently reconnected field, and the time delay between reconnection forming a flare loop and its appearance in EUV passbands. These results promise to enable improvements in both magnetic modeling and hydrodynamic modeling of flares.

 - **Abstract**
 Aims. Magnetic and abundance maps of chemically peculiar (CP) stars, derived with the help of Zeeman Doppler mapping, have invariably been used as arguments against theories, in particular atomic diffusion theory. We intend to expose the fallacy of these claims. Methods. We have identified in the literature those (5) CP stars for which multiple maps have been published, all based on the same Zeeman Doppler mapping strategy. For each of these stars we have then carried out inter comparisons between the recovered distributions of magnetic field and of abundances. Results. Agreement between maps often turns out to be quite poor in regard to both abundances, field topology and absolute field strengths. Maps based on the same set of observations can differ considerably, even when they are coming from the same authors. Conclusions. It becomes clear that Zeeman Doppler mapping cannot be guaranteed to yield unique results. When a number of physically impossible magnetic geometries all provide good fits to the observed Stokes $IQUV$ profiles, these solutions must necessarily be spurious and cannot be used as constraints to diffusion theory.
#### Connecting Star Formation in the Milky Way and Nearby Galaxies. I. Comparability of Molecular Cloud Physical Properties

 - **Abstract**
 We used CO (2-1) and CO (1-0) data cubes to identify molecular clouds and study their kinematics and dynamics in three nearby galaxies and the inner Milky Way. When observed at similar spatial and velocity resolutions, molecular clouds in the same mass range across these galaxies show broadly comparable physical properties and similar star formation rates (SFRs). However, this comparability depends on smoothing Milky Way clouds to match the resolution of the extragalactic observations. The beam effect can artificially inflate cloud sizes, leading to inaccurate estimates of radius, density, and virial parameters. By comparing high-resolution and smoothed Milky Way data, we established criteria to exclude beam-affected clouds in the extragalactic sample. After applying this filter, cloud properties remain consistent across galaxies, though some clouds in NGC 5236 show elevated velocity dispersions, likely due to environmental effects. In the inner Milky Way, molecular clouds fall into two groups: those with clumps and those without. Clump-associated clouds are more massive, denser, have higher velocity dispersions, lower virial parameters, and stronger 8~\(\mu\)m emission, suggesting more intense feedback. Strong correlations are found between cloud mass and total clump mass, clump number, and the mass of the most massive clump. These results suggest that a cloud's physical conditions regulate its internal clump properties and, in turn, its star-forming potential.
#### Supplementing the 2MRS survey: The 2MZoA catalogue

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26979

 - **Abstract**
 We present a homogeneous 2MASX galaxy catalogue at low Galactic latitudes (|b| <= 10.0 deg, called Zone of Avoidance, ZoA) which is complete to a Galactic extinction-corrected magnitude of Ko <= 11.75 mag. Also included are galaxies at higher latitudes in areas of high foreground extinctions (E(B-V) > 0.95). This catalogue supersedes the previously presented bright 2MZoA catalogue which was only complete to Ko < 11.25 mag. It fully complements the 2MASS Redshift Survey (2MRS) galaxy catalogue, which has the same magnitude limit but excludes high extinction regions. The combination of the two catalogues, the extended 2MRS or e2MRS, is is a uniquely whole sky redshift survey and forms a sound basis for studies of large-scale structures, flow fields and extinction across the ZoA. The here presented catalogue comprises 6899 galaxies with 6757 galaxies at low latitudes and 142 galaxies in highly obscured high-latitude areas. The completion rate in redshifts is almost 75%. The catalogue is complete up to star density levels of at least log N_*/deg^2 < 4.3, but the completion rate of the fainter part is affected by foreground extinction at all levels. This can be rectified by using a diameter-dependent extinction correction, adding 1083 highly obscured but apparently faint galaxies (with Ko > 11.75 mag and Ko,d <= 11.75 mag) to the sample. This extended sample shows good completion rates with extinction up to at least AK < 1.3 mag. Omission of such a diameter-dependent extinction correction may lead to a biased flow field even at intermediate extinction values as found in the 2MRS survey. As in our previous investigations, we do not find a dependence of the correction factor f=0.86 to the extinction maps on Galactic longitudes or latitudes, but note a possible influence by cosmic variance.
#### Faint active galactic nuclei supplied 31-75% of hydrogen-ionizing photons at z>5

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of the ionizing photons that completed hydrogen reionization remains debated. Using recent JWST and ground-based surveys at 4.5 <= z <= 6.5, we construct a unified rest-UV AGN luminosity function that separates unobscured Type I and obscured Type II populations, and show that "little red dots" and X-ray selected sources are magnitude-filtered subsets of Type I with a mixture fraction eta = 0.10 +/- 0.02. We anchor the Lyman-continuum (LyC) escape fraction to outflow incidence and geometric clearing rather than assuming quasar-like values for all classes, and propagate uncertainties through a joint fit. Integrating over -27 < M_UV < -17, AGN inject Ndot_ion,AGN = (3.77 +1.08/-0.95) x 10^51 s^-1 Mpc^-3, nearly twice earlier estimates and comparable to the Ly-alpha inferred requirement at z ~ 6. When combined with the JWST galaxy UV luminosity function and a harder stellar ionizing efficiency of log10(xi_ion) = 25.7, AGN contribute 31-75% of the total ionizing photons for representative galaxy escape fractions f_esc,gal = 0.03-0.20. The resulting hydrogen photoionization rate, Gamma_HI ~ (0.5-2) x 10^-12 s^-1 at z ~ 5-6, lies squarely within the Ly-alpha forest constraints once mean free paths and IGM clumpiness are accounted for, remaining consistent for combined AGN-galaxy models up to f_esc,gal <= 5%. These results suggest that AGN and galaxies jointly sustained the ionizing background during the final stages of reionization, with AGN remaining a major but not exclusive contributor.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a sample of 127 gas-bearing dwarf galaxies around 56 late-type host galaxies within 30 Mpc using 21-cm HI data from the WALLABY, MHONGOOSE, and ALFALFA surveys. We characterize the environment of each dwarf galaxy based on its host galaxy halo and derive optical properties using the DESI Legacy Surveys for 110. The gaseous satellites span $\log (M_{\rm HI}/M_{\odot}) = 5.7-9.7$ and $\log (M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) = 5.6-10.0$, with a median velocity line-width of $W_{50}=37$ km/s, comparable to the Local Group gaseous dwarf galaxies. We assess the HI mass sensitivity of the data by injecting model dwarf galaxies and find $M_{\rm HI,lim} = 10^{6.7} M_{\odot}$ for WALLABY and $M_{\rm HI,lim} = 10^{5.4} M_{\odot}$ for MHONGOOSE at 10 Mpc. With this sensitivity, our sample shows lower average gas-to-stellar mass ratios ($M_{\rm HI}/M_{\star}$) than literature dwarf galaxy samples. The abundance of gaseous satellites per host is low and increases with host mass: $0-2$ for isolated dwarf galaxy hosts and $0-5$ for Milky Way-mass spiral hosts. These numbers are consistent with the Milky Way, M31, and star-forming satellite abundances from recent deep optical surveys. The inferred quenched fractions and gas-depleted satellites indicate that environmental quenching is effective in Milky Way-mass hosts, likely driven by gas stripping processes.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational-wave detectors can probe the existence of dark matter with exquisite sensitivity. Here, we perform a search for three kinds of dark matter -- dilatons (spin-0), dark photons (spin-1) and tensor bosons (spin-2) -- using three independent methods on the first part of the most recent data from the fourth observing run of LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA. Each form of dark matter could have interacted with different standard-model particles in the instruments, causing unique differential strains on the interferometers. While we do not find any evidence for a signal, we place the most stringent upper limits to-date on each of these models. For scalars with masses between $[4\times 10^{-14},1.5\times 10^{-13}]$ eV that couple to photons or electrons, our constraints improve upon those from the third observing run by one order of magnitude, with the tightest limit of $\sim 10^{-20}\,\text{GeV}^{-1}$ at a mass of $\sim2\times 10^{-13}\text{ eV}$. For vectors with masses between $[7\times 10^{-13},8.47\times 10^{-12}]$ eV that couple to baryons, our constraints supersede those from MICROSCOPE and Eöt-Wash by one to two orders of magnitude, reaching a minimum of $\sim 5\times 10^{-24}$ at a mass of $\sim 10^{-12}$ eV. For tensors with masses of $[4\times 10^{-14},8.47\times 10^{-12}]$ eV (the full mass range analyzed) that couple via a Yukawa interaction, our constraints surpass those from fifth-force experiments by four to five orders of magnitude, achieving a limit as low as $\sim 8\times 10^{-9}$ at $\sim2\times 10^{-13}$ eV. Our results show that gravitational-wave interferometers have become frontiers for new physics and laboratories for direct multi-model dark-matter detection.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the three-dimensional evolution of coronal magnetic fields during solar flares remains challenging due to the lack of direct coronal field measurements. Here we combine data-driven MHD simulations of NOAA AR 11158 (Fan et al., 2024) with flare-ribbon and coronal-dimming observations to investigate realistic coronal magnetic-field evolution during an X-class flare. We introduce L-maps, maps of the logarithm of magnetic field line lengths, as a diagnostic tool to track the dynamics of simulated coronal magnetic structures. Variations in L-maps identify flare ribbons through field-line shortening and coronal dimmings through field-line lengthening. Comparison with SDO/AIA observations demonstrates strong morphological and temporal agreement, validating the simulated field evolution. Applying K-means clustering to the L-map temporal profiles, we distinguish three stages of coronal evolution: (1) slow pre-flare rise phase, (2) flare reconnection accompanied by CME rise, and (3) post-reconnection CME expansion. We detect a slow pre-flare rise phase of magnetic field lines rooted in ribbon footpoints and identify a new phenomenon, reconnection dimming, a rapid expansion of reconnected inner flux-rope field lines during the impulsive phase. Our results show that L-maps provide a powerful and physically intuitive framework for bridging simulations and observations and for tracking the full three-dimensional evolution of coronal magnetic fields during flares.

 - **Abstract**
 Photo-z algorithms that utilize SED template fitting have matured, and are widely adopted for use on high-redshift near-infrared data that provides a unique window into the early universe. Alternative photo-z methods have been developed, largely within the context of low-redshift optical surveys. Machine learning based approaches have gained footing in this regime, including those that utilize raw pixel information instead of aperture photometry. However, the efficacy of image-based algorithms on high-redshift, near-infrared data remains underexplored. Here, we test the performance of Detection, Instance Segmentation and Classification with Deep Learning (DeepDISC) on photometric redshift estimation with NIRCam images from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) program. DeepDISC is designed to produce probabilistic photometric redshift estimates directly from images, after detecting and deblending sources in a scene. Using NIRCam-only images and a compiled catalog of spectroscopic redshifts, we show that DeepDISC produces reliable photo-zs and uncertainties comparable to those estimated from template fitting using HST+JWST filters; DeepDISC even outperforms template fitting (lower scatter/fewer outliers) when the input photometric filters are matched. Compared with template fitting, DeepDISC does not require measured photometry from images, and can produce a catalog of 94000 photo-zs in ~4 minutes on a single NVIDIA A40 GPU. While current spectroscopic training samples are small and incomplete in color-magnitude space, this work demonstrates the potential of DeepDISC for increasingly larger image volumes and spectroscopic samples from ongoing and future programs. We discuss the impact of the training data on applications to broader samples and produce a catalog of photo-zs for all JADES DR2 photometric sources in the GOOD-S field, with quality flags indicating caveats.

 - **Abstract**
 Radiative transfer calculations are essential for modeling planetary atmospheres. However, standard methods are computationally demanding and impose accuracy-speed trade-offs. High computational costs force numerical simplifications in large models (e.g., General Circulation Models) that degrade the accuracy of the simulation. Radiative transfer calculations are an ideal candidate for machine learning emulation: fundamentally, it is a well-defined physical mapping from a static atmospheric profile to the resulting fluxes, and high-fidelity training data can be created from first principles calculations. We developed a radiative transfer emulator using an encoder-only transformer neural network architecture, trained on 1D profiles representative of solar-composition hot Jupiter atmospheres. Our emulator reproduced bolometric two-stream layer fluxes with mean test set errors of ~1% compared to the traditional method and achieved speedups of 100x. Emulating radiative transfer with machine learning opens up the possibility for faster and more accurate routines within planetary atmospheric models such as GCMs.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar activity remains one of the primary challenges in the detection and characterization of low-mass exoplanets, as it can induce radial velocity (RV) variations that mask or mimic planetary signals. Identifying reliable activity proxies is essential in order to distinguish stellar variability from genuine planetary signatures. In this study, we examine the variability of the chromospheric He I D3 line in high-resolution solar spectra and assess its potential as an activity indicator. We find a strong correlation between the He I D3 line intensity variation and the Sun's unsigned magnetic flux derived from SDO HMI data as well as with the solar RVs. Our results suggest that the He I D3 line offers a promising and straightforward proxy for magnetic activity, which may complement existing stellar activity indicators. Its inclusion could help disentangle stellar signals in RV measurements and ultimately improve the detection of Earth-like exoplanets.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive physical model explaining the origin of Periodic Density Structures (PDS) observed in white-light coronagraphs with characteristic periods of approximately 45, 80, and 120 minutes. Through systematic investigation of potential resonant cavities in the solar atmosphere, we demonstrate that traditional large-scale cavities yield fundamentally incompatible periods: photosphere-transition region (3.3 minutes), transition region-sonic point (10.3 hours), and transition region-heliopause (7.7 years). We establish that coronal streamers act as natural magnetohydrodynamic resonators, with calculated harmonic periods of 122, 61, and 41 minutes that precisely match observations. The physical mechanism involves slow magnetoacoustic standing waves that create periodic density enhancements through wave compression, with the streamer resonator having quality factor Q ~ 10-100, enabling natural amplification of broadband coronal noise. At streamer cusps, these density enhancements trigger magnetic reconnection, releasing plasma blobs into the solar wind at resonant periods. The model provides complete energy budget calculations, wave amplitude estimates, and explains all key observational features including spatial localization, period coherence, and the relationship between remote sensing and in situ measurements. This work establishes streamer resonators as fundamental structures shaping solar wind variability and provides a new framework for understanding the emergence of coherent structures in turbulent astrophysical plasmas.

 - **Abstract**
 Flare ribbons with parallel and circular morphologies are typically associated with different magnetic reconnection models, and the simultaneous observation of both types in a single event remains rare. Using multi-wavelength observations from a tandem of instruments, we present an M8.2-class flare that occurred on 2023 September 20, which produced quasi-parallel and semi-circular ribbons. The complex evolution of the flare includes two distinct brightening episodes in the quasi-parallel ribbons, corresponding to the two major peaks in the hard X-ray (HXR) light curve. In contrast, the brightening of semi-circular ribbons temporally coincides with the local minimum between the two peaks. Using potential field extrapolation, we reconstruct an incomplete dome-like magnetic structure with a negative polarity embedded within the northwestern part of the semi-circular positive polarity. Consequently, the magnetic configuration comprises two sets of field lines with distinct magnetic connectivities. We suggest that the standard flare reconnection accounts for the two-stage brightening of quasi-parallel ribbons associated with the two HXR peaks. Between the two stages, this process is constrained by the interaction of eruptive structures with the dome. The interaction drives the quasi-separatrix layer reconnection, leading to the brightening of semi-circular ribbons. It also suppresses the standard flare reconnection, resulting in a delayed second HXR peak.

 - **Abstract**
 A radiation field can be excited via parametric resonance when an oscillating axion field couples to the electromagnetic sector through a Chern-Simons interaction. As demonstrated in previous works, this mechanism can generate primordial magnetic fields shortly after recombination and provide sufficient ultraviolet radiation for the formation of direct collapse black holes (DCBHs). In this study, I analyze constraints on the parametric resonance scenario from global 21cm observations. I find that there exist viable regions in the parameter space that satisfy both observational limits and the physical requirements of the magnetic field and DCBH formation scenarios.

 - **Abstract**
 The ability to disentangle the light of an AGN from its host galaxy is strongly dependent on the spatial resolution and depth of the imaging. As the capabilities of imaging systems improve with time, confirming that our standard techniques adequately model the increasingly complex structures unveiled is essential. With JWST providing unprecedented image quality, we can test how measurements of galaxy morphology vary with the choice of point-spread function (PSF) and fitting software. We perform two-component Sérsic+PSF fits of the surface brightness profiles of 87 X-ray AGNs $(0.1 < z < 4)$ from the CEERS survey. We create model PSFs for NIRCam F115W imaging using both photutils and PSFEx. We find that PSFEx models consistently fail to match the radial profile of typical point sources within our sample. We then perform AGN--host decompositions on each source by creating Sérsic+PSF models using both Galfit and AstroPhot. We find that Galfit and AstroPhot converge to different regions of the parameter space, providing consistently differing host galaxy properties. While we can measure the AGN and host magnitudes accurately, we find that the host galaxy morphological parameters are not well-determined -- the Sérsic index and effective radius are strongly covariant. Significant changes in the host galaxy parameters do not correspond to changes in the statistical quality of fit, nor to significant changes in the model's radial profile. These results indicate that the Sérsic profile does not uniquely well-represent typical AGN host galaxies in extragalactic survey fields. We also provide recommendations for studies of AGN hosts comparable to ours.
#### Evolution of stellar magnetic activity: probing planet engulfment by red giants

 - **Abstract**
 The fraction of low-mass (LM) stars (M <= 1.5 Msun) showing photospheric activity in their light curve is larger on the horizontal branch (HB) than during the previous red giant branch (RGB) phase, while the opposite trend has been observed for intermediate-mass (IM) stars (M > 1.5 Msun). One hypothesis is that LM red giants (RGs) engulf more planets than IM RGs, which results in a faster surface rotation and a higher magnetic activity. Indeed, LM stars reach a maximum radius at the RGB tip that is much larger than for IM stars, making them more likely to engulf planets. However, we need to study the evolution of the active star fraction along the RGB to firmly check this hypothesis. I use independent indicators tracing the activity level in the chromosphere based on the Ca II H&K, Halpha, Mg I and infrared Ca II spectral lines from LAMOST data for about 3000 RGs whose evolutionary stage has been identified by asteroseismology with the Kepler mission. I find that the fraction of active stars decreases for IM stars along the RGB but unexpectedly increases for LM stars. Such an increase is not explained by models of single-star evolution and is consistent with the fact that LM stars are more susceptible than IM stars of engulfing planets. Indeed, data shows that IM main-sequence stars exhibit a dearth of planets, consistently with predictions from planet formation theory. I also observe that the fraction of active stars tends to increase for both LM and IM stars on the HB, in partial contrast with previous findings. Finally, I discover that the IM RGB star KIC 9780154 may have engulfed one or more planet(s) as its surface rotation from photometry is twice faster than its envelope rotation from asteroseismology. Characterizing planet engulfment by RGs provides insights into the evolution and fate of most planetary systems, since about 97 % of stars pass through the RG evolution stage.

 - **Abstract**
 While theoretically established for decades, the Penrose process - energy extraction from rotating black holes - still lacks clear observational evidence. A promising theoretical framework posits magnetic reconnection in the ergosphere as a trigger, causing a plasmoid to separate into an escaping positive-energy fragment and an infalling negative-energy one. In this work, we investigate the observational imprints of this scenario. We treat the energized plasmoid as a hotspot and calculate its light curves for a realistic plasma magnetization. In particular, we further compare with the scenario in which the plasmoid, after fragmentation, falls into the black hole with positive energy, while all other conditions remain unchanged. Our results reveal that the process of fragmentation generates distinct flares, whose characteristics depend heavily on whether the infalling fragment carries negative or positive energy. We propose that these differences serve as identifiable signatures of the Penrose process.
#### Earth-lens telescope for distant axion-like particle sources with stimulated backward reflection

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a novel telescope concept based on Earth's gravitational lensing effect, optimized for the detection of distant dark matter sources, particularly axion-like particles (ALPs). When a unidirectional flux of dark matter passes through Earth at sufficiently high velocity, gravitational lensing can concentrate the flux at a distant focal region in space. Our method combines this lensing effect with stimulated backward reflection (SBR), arising from ALP decays that are induced by directing a coherent electromagnetic beam toward the focal point. The aim of this work is to numerically analyze the structure of the focal region and to develop a framework for estimating the sensitivity to ALP-photon coupling via this mechanism. Numerical calculations show that, assuming an average ALP velocity of 520,km/s -- as suggested by the observed stellar stream S1 -- the focal region extends from $9 \times 10^9$,m to $1.4 \times 10^{10}$,m, with peak density near $9.6 \times 10^9$,m. For a conservative point-like ALP source located approximately 8,kpc from the solar system, based on the S1 stream, the estimated sensitivity in the eV mass range reaches $g/M = \mathcal{O}(10^{-22}),\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$. This concept thus opens a path toward a general-purpose, space-based ALP observatory that could, in principle, detect more distant sources -- well beyond $\mathcal{O}(10),\mathrm{kpc}$ -- provided that ALP-photon coupling is sufficiently strong, that is, $M \ll M_\mathrm{Planck}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic turbulence plays a crucial role in confining charged particles near the shock front of Supernova Remnants, enabling them to reach energies up to hundreds of TeV through a process known as Diffusive Shock Acceleration (DSA). These high-energy electrons spiral along magnetic field lines, emitting X-ray synchrotron radiation. The launch of the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) has opened a new window into the study of magnetic fields in SNRs through X-ray polarization measurements. For the first time, IXPE allows us to resolve the polarization degree (PD) and angle (PA) in the X-ray band across different areas of SNRs, offering direct insight into the geometry and coherence of magnetic fields on different scales. In this mini-review, I summarize the key observational results on SNRs obtained with IXPE over the past four years and discuss their implications for our understanding of magnetic turbulence in synchrotron-emitting regions. I also show how we can combine polarization parameters and standard X-ray spectral/imaging analysis to better constrain the structure and scale of magnetic turbulence immediately downstream of the shock and understand the particle acceleration occurring in SNRs.
#### Solar Polar Field Reversals as the Result of the Global Magnetic field Meridional Flows

 - **Abstract**
 Based on data obtained from Wilcox Solar Observatiry the solar polar magnetic fields reversals in cycles 21\,--\,25 were considered. The results indicate that the polarity reversal occurs at the maximum of sunspot activity of each cycle, but the beginning, end, and duration of the reversals did not demonstrate any association with the Wolf numbers, which are characteristics of local magnetic fields. Moreover, during the periods of polarity reversal, the correlation between global magnetic field (GMF) parameters and Wolf numbers decreased and even moved into anti-correlation mode. The polar field reversals are determined by the GMF flows of positive- and negative-polarity magnetic fields, which cyclically migrate from one pole to the opposite pole. The new polarity magnetic fields are delivered to the poles by a certain flow, and then carried away by the same flow to the opposite pole. The increase in the polar magnetic field strength to its maximal values at the solar activity minimum and following decrees to the next cycle maximum coincides with the latitudinal changes in corresponding magnetic field flow. Formulas for calculating the meridional circulation of positive- and negative-polarity magnetic field flows were proposed. They allow predict the time of polarity reversals, and since polarity reversals occur at the maxima of cycles, then also the time of maxima of both the future and past cycles.

 - **Abstract**
 The coronal heating problem remains a fundamental challenge in solar physics. While AWSoM-type models (Alfvén Wave Solar Model) have proven highly successful in reproducing the large-scale structure of the solar corona, they inherently neglect contributions from additional wave modes that arise when the effects of transverse structuring is fully incorporated into the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations. In this paper, we compare the roles of kink wave- and Alfvén wave-driven heating in sustaining a region of the solar atmosphere, using newly developed physics and radiative cooling modules within MPI-AMRVAC. We extend the existing MHD physics module in MPI-AMRVAC by incorporating additional Alfvén and kink wave energy contributions to the MHD equations. We examine their roles in heating the solar atmosphere and driving the solar wind. To validate our approach, we compare numerical results from Python-based simulations with those obtained using the UAWSoM module in MPI-AMRVAC. Furthermore, we assess the heating efficiency of kink waves relative to that of pure Alfvén waves through two parameter studies: (1) exploring how different Alfvén wave reflection rates impact the simulated atmosphere, and (2) varying the relative magnitudes of Alfvén and kink wave energy injections. Finally, we present results from a larger-scale domain, sustained entirely by kink wave-driven heating. Our results show that kink wave-driven (UAWSoM) models are able to sustain a stable atmosphere without requiring any artificial background heating terms, unlike traditional Alfvén-only models. We attribute this to the increased heating rate associated with kink waves compared with Alfvén waves, given the same energy injection. Kink waves can sustain a model plasma with temperature and density values representative of coronal conditions without resorting to ad hoc heating terms.

 - **Abstract**
 We present DiffstarPop, a differentiable forward model of cosmological populations of galaxy star formation histories (SFH). In the model, individual galaxy SFH is parametrized by Diffstar, which has parameters $\theta_{\rm SFH}$ that have a direct interpretation in terms of galaxy formation physics, such as star formation efficiency and quenching. DiffstarPop is a model for the statistical connection between $\theta_{\rm SFH}$ and the mass assembly history (MAH) of dark matter halos. We have formulated DiffstarPop to have the minimal flexibility needed to accurately reproduce the statistical distributions of galaxy SFH predicted by a diverse range of simulations, including the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulation, the Galacticus semi-analytic model, and the UniverseMachine semi-empirical model. Our publicly available code written in JAX includes Monte Carlo generators that supply statistical samples of galaxy assembly histories that mimic the populations seen in each simulation, and can generate SFHs for $10^6$ galaxies in 1.1 CPU-seconds, or 0.03 GPU-seconds. We conclude the paper with a discussion of applications of DiffstarPop, which we are using to generate catalogs of synthetic galaxies populating the merger trees in cosmological N-body simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 NICER has enabled mass-radius inferences for pulsars using pulse profile modeling, providing constraints on the equation of state (EOS) of cold, dense matter. To date, PPM and EOS inference have been carried out as two separate steps, with the former using EOS-agnostic priors. This approach has several drawbacks. Ideally, one would perform a fully hierarchical Bayesian inference where the pulse profile and EOS model parameters are jointly fit, but implementing such a framework is complex and computationally demanding. Here, we present an intermediate solution introducing an EOS-informed prior on mass-radius into the existing PPM pipeline using normalizing flows. By focusing on the parameter space consistent with certain EOSs, this approach both tightens constraints on neutron star parameters while reducing computational costs and requiring minimal additional implementation effort. We test this approach on two pulsars, PSR J0740+6620 and PSR J0437-4715, and with two EOS model families: a model based on the speed of sound inside the neutron star interior (CS) and a piecewise-polytropic (PP) model. Both EOS models implement constraints from chiral effective field theory calculations of dense matter. For both pulsar datasets, the inferred radius credible intervals are narrower than in the EOS-agnostic case, with CS favoring smaller radii and PP favoring larger radii. For PSR J0437-4715, the EOS-informed priors reveal a new, more extreme geometric mode that is statistically favored but physically questionable. Including the PPM posteriors in the subsequent EOS inference further tightens the mass-radius posteriors through the chiral effective field theory constraints. However, there is also a sensitivity to the high-density extensions, where the PP (CS) model produces a shift towards larger (smaller) radii and corresponding stiffening (softening) of the pressure-energy density relation.

 - **Abstract**
 Pre-explosion mass loss in supernova (SN) progenitors is a crucial unknown factor in stellar evolution, yet has been illuminated recently by the diverse zoo of interacting transients. We present SN2024cld, a transitional core-collapse SN at a distance of 39 Mpc, straddling the boundary between SN II and SN IIn, showing persistent interaction with circumstellar material (CSM) similar to H-rich SN1998S and PTF11iqb. The SN was discovered and classified just 12h post-explosion via the GOTO-FAST high-cadence program. Optical spectroscopy, photometry, and polarimetry over 220d chart the complex, long-lived interaction in this transient. Early evolution is dominated by CSM interaction, showing a 14d rise to a peak absolute magnitude of g=-17.6 mag, with clear flash-ionisation signatures. SN2024cld also shows a marked double-plateau light curve powered by CSM interaction, with high-velocity (6000 km/s) shoulders on a strong multi-component H-alpha profile. Dense polarimetric coverage reveals marked evolution in the photospheric geometry -- peaking at p=2% 10 days post-explosion, and rotating approx. 60 deg as the ejecta sweep more distant CSM. We observe a narrow 60 km/s H-alpha P Cygni feature throughout, associated with pre-shock CSM. SN2024cld represents among the best-observed 98S-like SNe to date, revealing a multi-component CSM structure: a dense, inner aspherical envelope, CSM disk/torus, and tenuous, extended wind. We propose this SN arose from an evolved supergiant progenitor experiencing multiple mass loss episodes in its terminal years, with binary interaction plausibly generating the CSM disk. SN2024cld constrains the progenitors and mass-loss paradigms of 98S-like SNe, unveiling the chaotic ends of evolved supergiant stars from afar.

 - **Abstract**
 We recently released 10 years of HARPS-N solar telescope and the goal of this manuscript is to present the different optimisations made to the data reduction, to describe data curation, and to perform some analyses that demonstrate the extreme RV precision of those data. By analysing all the HARPS-N wavelength solutions over 13 years, we bring to light instrumental systematics at the 1 m/s level. After correction, we demonstrate a peak-to-peak precision on the HARPS-N wavelength solution better than 0.75 m/s over 13 years. We then carefully curate the decade of HARPS-N re-reduced solar observations by rejecting 30% of the data affected either by clouds, bad atmospheric conditions or well-understood instrumental systematics. Finally, we correct the curated data for spurious sub-m/s RV effects caused by erroneous instrumental drift measurements and by changes in the spectral blaze function over time. After curation and correction, a total of 109,466 HARPS-N solar spectra and respective RVs over a decade are available. The median photon-noise precision of the RV data is 0.28 m/s and, on daily timescales, the median RV rms is 0.49 m/s, similar to the level imposed by stellar granulation signals. On 10-year timescales, the large RV rms of 2.95 m/s results from the RV signature of the Sun's magnetic cycle. When modelling this long-term effect using the Magnesium II activity index, we demonstrate a long-term RV precision of 0.41 m/s. We also analysed contemporaneous HARPS-N and NEID solar RVs and found the data from both instruments to be of similar quality and precision, with an overall RV differece rms of 0.79 m/s. This decade of high-cadence HARPS-N solar observations with short- and long-term precision below 1 m/s represents a crucial dataset to further understand stellar activity signals in solar-type stars , and to advance other science cases requiring such an extreme precision.

 We present ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy of the 17 Myr, G0V star, HIP 67522. The UV spectrum is characterized by strong chromospheric and transition region emission lines. There was moderate spectral variability during the observations consisting of 15% stochastic fluctuation and two small flares releasing $E_{UV} \simeq 2-4\times10^{32}$ ergs in each event. We compare the broadband spectral energy distribution (SED; 4.7 A - 13.0~$\mu$m) of the star first presented in Thao et al. (2024) to the solar SED and show that X-ray/UV (XUV) flux density at 1 AU is $10^{2}-10^{5}$ stronger (from 1000 A down to 5 A) in the young star compared to the present-day Sun. Attempts to reconstruct the intrinsic Ly-alpha emission of the star failed to return physically realistic results. The discrepancy appears to arise from a population of neutral hydrogen within the system itself, extending to $> \pm500$ km/s. The absorption could be due to outflow from exoplanet atmospheric loss or from a stellar component; such a picture would require high spectral resolution observations and/or UV transit spectroscopy to confirm. Finally, we examine the evolution of the XUV emission from solar-type stars from ages of 17 Myr to 9.4 Gyr and derive a scaling relation between FUV Ly-alpha and EUV emission as a function of stellar age. X-ray (1--100 A) and EUV (100--900 A) contributions to high energy emission are 329 and 672 ergs/cm^2/s at 1 AU, respectively, suggesting that both may contribute to exoplanet heating at this epoch. The XUV emission levels at 17 Myr combined with the low density of the planet HIP67522b are consistent with models that predict that solar type stars born with high rotation and activity levels will drive substantial heating and escape on close-in, gaseous planets.

 - **Abstract**
 Both observations and hydrodynamic simulations suggest that turbulence is ubiquitous in the circumgalactic medium (CGM). We study the development and properties of CGM turbulence driven by accretion in halo masses of $10^{10}-10^{13}\,{\rm M}_\odot$ at redshifts $0\leq z\lesssim 2$, thus providing a baseline for additional turbulence driving processes such as galaxy feedback. Using analytic considerations and idealized hydrodynamical simulations we demonstrate that in halos with mass up to $\sim10^{12}\,{\rm M}_\odot$, even mild turbulent velocities near the virial radius of $\sigma_{\rm t}(R_{\rm vir})\sim 10\,{\rm km \, s^{-1}}$ are enhanced by the accretion process so that turbulent velocities are comparable to the virial velocity at inner CGM radii, with $\sigma_{\rm t}(0.1\,R_{\rm vir})\approx v_{\rm vir}\sim 100\,{\rm km \, s^{-1}}$. Rapid cooling at these inner radii further implies that thermal pressure support is small, and the gas is dominated by the cool and warm ($\sim10^4-10^5\,{\rm K}$) phases. Inner CGM energetics are thus dominated by turbulence, with gas density distributions and velocity structure functions similar to those seen in simulations of isothermal supersonic ISM turbulence, rather than those seen in subsonically turbulent stratified media such as the ICM. The gas accretion rate in these systems is regulated by the turbulence dissipation rate rather than by the cooling rate as in more massive halos. We argue that galaxy feedback is unlikely to qualitatively change our conclusions unless it continuously injects high specific energy material ($\gg v^2_{\rm vir}$) into the CGM. Such `turbulence-dominated' CGM can be identified in observations via the predicted wide lognormal ionization distributions and large velocity dispersions in UV absorption spectra, particularly in the inner CGM of $\sim L^\star$ and lower-mass halos.
