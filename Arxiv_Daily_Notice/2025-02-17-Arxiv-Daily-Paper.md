 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of deep $\textit{JWST}$/NIRSpec spectra of star-forming galaxies at $z\simeq1.4-10$, observed as part of the AURORA survey. We infer median low-ionization electron densities of $268_{-49}^{+45}~\rm cm^{-3}$, $350_{-76}^{+140}~\rm cm^{-3}$, and $480_{-310}^{+390}~\rm cm^{-3}$ at redshifts z$=2.3$, $z=3.2$, and $z=5.3$, respectively, revealing an evolutionary trend following $(1+z)^{1.5\pm0.6}$. We identify weak positive correlations between electron density and star formation rate (SFR) as well as SFR surface density, but no significant trends with stellar mass or specific SFR. Correlations with rest-optical emission line ratios show densities increasing with $\rm [NeIII]\lambda3869/[OII]\lambda3727$ and, potentially, $\rm [OIII]\lambda5007/[OII]\lambda3727$, although variations in dust attenuation complicate the latter. Additionally, electron density is more strongly correlated with distance from the local BPT sequence than can be explained by simple photoionization models. We further derive electron densities from the CIII] doublet probing higher-ionization gas, and find a median value of $1.4_{-0.5}^{+0.7}\times10^4~\rm cm^{-3}$, $\sim30$ times higher than densities inferred from [SII]. This comparison suggests a consistent HII region structure across cosmic time with dense, high-ionization interiors surrounded by less dense, low-ionization gas. We compare measurements of AURORA galaxies to predictions from the SPHINX galaxy formations, highlighting the interplay between residual molecular cloud pressure in young galaxies and feedback from stellar winds and supernovae as galaxies mature.

 - **Abstract**
 The main fuelling processes for Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are currently unknown. Previous work showed that galaxies with a large kinematic misalignment between their stellar and gas reservoirs have a higher AGN fraction than galaxies without misalignment. Such misalignment is a strong indication of a past galaxy interaction or an external accretion event. In this work we use integral field spectroscopy data from the SAMI and MaNGA surveys to investigate the AGN luminosity as a function of kinematic misalignment angle. Our sample of AGN exhibit bolometric luminosities in the range 10^40 to 10^43 erg/s, indicative of low to moderate luminosity AGN. We find no correlation between AGN luminosity as a function of misalignment for AGN host galaxies from both surveys. We find some differences between the AGN luminosity of early- and late-type AGN host galaxies (ETGs, LTGs). AGN in LTG hosts have a wider luminosity range, with most LTG hosts showing aligned stellar to gas kinematics. AGN in ETG hosts have a luminosity range that does not depend on misalignment angle, suggesting AGN in ETG hosts are consistent with being fuelled by external accretion events, irrespective of their stellar to gas kinematic misalignment. While all the AGN in ETGs in our sample are consistent with being activated and fuelled by external gas, the range of observed AGN luminosities is likely caused by secondary factors such as the amount of fresh gas brought into the galaxy by the external interaction.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy clusters, the largest gravitationally bound structures in the Universe, contain vast amounts of dark matter, galaxies, and hot ionised gas known as the intracluster medium (ICM). In relaxed cluster cores, the ICM appears to cool radiatively faster than the age of the cluster, but the absence of line emission from the predicted cooling rate suggests heating mechanisms that offset the cooling, with feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGNs) being the most likely source. Turbulence and bulk motions, such as the oscillating (``sloshing'') motion of the core gas in the cluster potential well, have also been proposed as mechanisms for the distribution of heat from the outside of the core. Here we present high-resolution X-ray spectroscopic observations of the core of the Centaurus galaxy cluster with the XRISM satellite. We find that the hot gas is streaming along the line of sight relative to the central galaxy (NGC 4696), with relative velocities varying from 130 km/s to 310 km/s within ~ 30 kpc of the centre, indicating a structured bulk flow ("wind") blowing in the core. This wind is consistent with the core gas sloshing. While the wind may prevent excessive accumulation of cooled gas at the centre of the cluster, it could also distribute the heat injected by the central AGN and/or bring in thermal energy from the surrounding ICM, thus contributing to the thermal balance at the cluster centre. The velocity dispersion (turbulent velocity) of the gas is found to be only ~< 120 km/s (corresponding to a Mach number M ~< 0.2) in the core, even within ~ 10 kpc of the AGN. This may indicate that the influence of the AGN on the motion of the surrounding ICM is limited in the Centaurus cluster.

 - **Abstract**
 Collapsars -- massive stars whose cores promptly collapse into black holes (BHs) -- can power long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) via relativistic, collimated, electromagnetically-driven outflows, or jets. Their power depends on the BH magnetic field strength and spin. To survive the infalling stellar material, jets need the central BH to attain dynamically important magnetic fields that can suppress the mass inflow and lead to a magnetically arrested disk (MAD). Previous work found that non-radiative MADs can spin down their BHs to an equilibrium spin, $a_{\rm eq}^\text{nr}=0.035-0.07$. Such low spins result in extremely low power jets that may struggle to escape out of the star. However, the dense and hot collapsar disks emit neutrinos that cool the disk, reduce its thickness, and increase the angular momentum supply to the BH. Using 3D two-moment neutrino-transport general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we show for the first time that successful collapsar jets powered by neutrino-cooled disks still rapidly spin down their BHs, although to a higher $a_{\rm eq}\approx 0.13$. This value is consistent with LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA inferred spins, is $2-4$x higher than for non-radiative MADs, and results in $4-16$x more powerful LGRB jets, which are more capable of drilling out of the progenitor star. This value of $a_{\rm eq}$ holds across a wide range of progenitor structures and mass accretion rates, $\dot{m} \sim(0.1-10)M_{\odot}/\rm{s}$. We find that for typical LGRB durations, $t\gtrsim30$~s, such BHs consume sufficient mass to reach $a_{\rm eq} \approx 0.13$ by LGRB's end. However, shorter or lower-$\dot{m}$ LGRBs can leave behind more rapidly spinning BHs.

 - **Abstract**
 We assume an extreme scenario, in which the arriving cosmic rays are composed of only iron nuclei at energies above $10^{19.6}\,\text{eV}\simeq40\,\text{EeV}$, while allowing a freedom in the scale of the depth of shower maximum ($X_{\rm{max}}$) and preserving the elongation rate and fluctuations of $X_{\rm{max}}$ predicted by models of hadronic interactions. We derive the shift of the $X_{\rm{max}}$ scale for QGSJet II-04 and Sibyll 2.3d models using the public data from the Pierre Auger Observatory. We then propose a new mass-composition model for the energy evolution of four primary species at the ultra-high energies by fitting the publicly-available $X_{\rm{max}}$ distributions. We discuss the consequences of this Heavy-metal scenario on the energy spectrum of individual primary species, hadronic interaction studies, and the effect of the Galactic magnetic field on the arrival directions.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.08748

 - **Abstract**
 We show that the null geodesic equation for photons is modified in the presence of a charged scalar field, with quantum fluctuations acting as an effective mass term that changes the null paths to timelike curves. This effect can be interpreted as a vacuum polarization phenomenon in curved spacetime. The resulting contribution to the Sachs-Wolfe effect varies with photon frequency, leading to frequency-dependent corrections to the cosmic microwave background (CMB) blackbody spectrum in the form of a $\mu$-distortion, as well as modifications to the CMB power spectrum. We estimate these within a standard inflationary scenario and find that while the correction to the CMB power spectrum is significant when the scalar field is light, the magnitude of the $\mu$-distortion depends strongly on the regularization prescription.

 - **Abstract**
 We describe a model that accounts for the phase rotation that occurs when a receiver or transmitter changes orientation while observing or emitting circularly polarized electromagnetic waves. This model extends work detailing Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) carrier phase wind-up to allow us to describe the interaction of changing satellite orientation with phase rotation in observing radio telescopes. This development is motivated by, and a critical requirement of, unifying GNSS and Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) measurements at the observation level. The model can be used for either stationary choke ring antennas or steerable radio telescopes observing either natural radio sources or satellites. Simulations and experimental data are used to validate the model and to illustrate its importance. In addition, we rigorously lay out the feed rotation correction for radio telescopes with beam waveguide and full Nasmyth focuses and validate the correction by observing the effect with dual polarization observations. Using this feed rotation model for beam waveguide telescopes, we produce the first phase delay solution for the VLBI baseline WARK30M-WARK12M. We provide a practical guide to using the feed rotation model in Appendix D.

 - **Abstract**
 Using the Large Millimeter Telescope and the SEQUOIA 3~mm focal plane array, we have searched for molecular line emission from two atomic clouds associated with the Fermi Bubble of the Milky Way. Neither 12CO nor 13CO J=1-0 emission is detected from the HI cloud, MW-C20. 12CO J=1-0 emission is detected from MW-C21 that is distributed within 11 clumps with most of the CO luminosity coming from a single clump. However, we find no 13CO emission to a 3sigma brightness temperature limit of 0.3 K. Using this limit and RADEX non local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) excitation models, we derive H2 column density upper limits of (0.4-3)x10^{21} cm-2 for a set of physical conditions and a H2 to 12CO abundance ratio of 10^4. Model CO-to-H2 conversion factors are derived for each set of physical conditions. We find the maximum value is 1.6x10^{20} cm-2/(K km/s). Increasing [H2/12CO] to 10^5 to account for photodissociation and cosmic ray ionization increases the column density and XCO upper limits by a factor of 10. Applying these XCO limits to the CO luminosities, the upper limit to the total molecular mass in MW-C21 is 132+/-2~Msun, corresponding to less than 27% of the neutral gas mass. For the three clumps that are fully resolved, lower limits to the virial ratios are 288+/-32, 68+/-28, and 157+/-39, which suggest that these structures are bound by external pressure to remain dynamically stable over the entrainment time of 2x10^6 years or are being disrupted by shear and expansion over the clump crossing times of (3-8)x10^5 years. The observations presented in this study add to the growing census of cold gas entrained within the Galactic Center wind.

 - **Abstract**
 Near-infrared spectroscopic surveys target high-redshift emission-line galaxies (ELGs) to probe cosmological scenarios. Understanding the clustering properties of ELGs is essential to derive optimal constraints. We present a simple radiative transfer model for spatially resolved galactic H$\alpha$ emission, which includes emission from the warm-hot diffuse interstellar medium. The atomic level populations are in steady-state and computed in the coronal approximation. The model is applied to multiple IllustrisTNG simulations in the redshift range $1\leq z \leq 2$ to produce the luminosity function (LF) and the halo occupation distribution (HOD). Collisional processes account for a significant fraction of $\approx 40\%$ of the total ${\rm H}\alpha$ luminosity ($L_{{\rm H}\alpha}$). Our LFs are in reasonable agreement with measurements from H$\alpha$ surveys if a uniform extinction of $0.3<A_{{\rm H}\alpha}<0.85$ mag is assumed. Our HOD is consistent with that of the ${\it Euclid}$ Flagship galaxy mock up to differences that can be attributed to baryonic feedback, which is absent from the latter. When H$\alpha$ luminosities are computed from an empirical relation between $L_{{\rm H}\alpha}$ and the total star formation rate (SFR) the resulting LFs are in tension with previous observations. Our approach can be extended to other atomic lines, which should be helpful for the mining of high-redshift galaxy spectra in forthcoming surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 An ultraviolet survey of M31 has been carried out during 2017-23 with the UVIT instrument onboard the AstroSat Observatory. Here we present far and near ultraviolet (FUV and NUV) observations from the M31 UVIT survey, which covers a sky area of $\simeq 3.5^\circ \times 1.3^\circ$ with spatial resolution of $\simeq1^{\prime \prime}$. The observations included six filter bands in the wavelength range of 120 nm to 280 nm. Including the six bands, $\simeq$115,000 sources with signal-to-noise S/N$\ge$3 ( $\simeq$95,000 sources with signal-to-noise S/N$\ge$5) were detected at FUV or NUV wavelengths, with the largest set of detections ($\simeq$54,000 sources) in the FUV 150 nm band (F148W filter). This is considerably more than for the first version of the M31 source catalog (published in 2020), in part due to additional observations of M31 by UVIT and in part due to improved data processing. The magnitude (m$_{AB}$) at which incompleteness sets in is $\simeq$23.0 in the F148W band, with the other bands somewhat less sensitive, with least sensitive band (in m$_{AB}$ units) N279N with incompleteness for sources fainter than $\simeq$20.3). The faintest sources detectable in F148W have m$_{AB}\simeq$25.4, with other bands having higher minimum detectable brightness, with N279N having minimum detectable limit of m$_{AB}\simeq$22.1. The product of this work is the new M31 UVIT compact source catalog, containing positions, fluxes , magnitudes and S/N for the sources.

 - **Abstract**
 Radio-frequency interference (RFI) presents a significant obstacle to current radio interferometry experiments aimed at the Epoch of Reionization. RFI contamination is often several orders of magnitude brighter than the astrophysical signals of interest, necessitating highly precise identification and flagging. Although existing RFI flagging tools have achieved some success, the pervasive nature of this contamination leads to the rejection of excessive data volumes. In this work, we present a way to estimate an RFI emitter's altitude using near-field corrections. Being able to obtain the precise location of such an emitter could shift the strategy from merely flagging to subtracting or peeling the RFI, allowing us to preserve a higher fraction of usable data. We conduct a preliminary study using a two-minute observation from the Murchison-Widefield Array (MWA) in which an unknown object briefly crosses the field of view, reflecting RFI signals into the array. By applying near-field corrections that bring the object into focus, we are able to estimate its approximate altitude and speed to be $11.7$ km and $792$ km/h, respectively. This allows us to confidently conclude that the object in question is in fact an airplane. We further validate our technique through the analysis of two additional RFI-containing MWA observations, where we are consistently able to identify airplanes as the source of the interference.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the nature of compressible fluctuations in a broad range of turbulent plasmas, from the intracluster medium to the solar wind, has been an active field of research in the past decades. Theoretical frameworks for weakly compressible MHD turbulence in an inhomogeneous background magnetic field predict a linear scaling of the normalized mass density fluctuation ($\delta \rho / \rho_0$), as a function of the turbulent Mach number ($\mathcal{M}_t$), $\delta \rho / \rho_0 \propto \mathcal{M}_t$. However, so far the scaling relation has been tested only using moderate to low plasma beta ($\beta \lesssim 1$) solar wind observational data where the compressibility is weak $\delta \rho / \rho_0 \sim 0.1$. Here, we combine NASA's Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission data in Earth's magnetosheath, where $\beta \sim 10$ is high, and $\beta \sim 1$ highly-compressible magnetohydrodynamic turbulence simulations at unprecedented resolutions. Both show that $\delta \rho / \rho_0 \propto \mathcal{M}_t$ holds across a broad range of $\delta \rho / \rho_0$, $\mathcal{M}_t$ and $\beta$, demonstrating that $\delta \rho / \rho_0 \propto \mathcal{M}_t$ is a robust compressible turbulence relation, going beyond the asymptotics of the weakly compressible theory. We discuss the findings in the context of understanding the nature of strongly compressible turbulent fluctuations and the driving parameter in astrophysical and space plasmas.
#### Morphological Demographics of Galaxies at $z\sim 10-16$: Log-Normal Size Distribution and Exponential Profiles Consistent with the Disk Formation Scenario

 - **Abstract**
 We homogeneously investigate the morphological properties of $169$ galaxies at $z\sim10-16$ with deep JWST NIRCam images employing our established techniques of GALFIT modeling and uncertainty evaluation (systematics+statistics). We obtain effective radii $r_{\rm e}$ ranging $20-500$ pc, with a distribution significantly broader than the scatter made by the uncertainties. We find that the $r_{\rm e}$ distribution is well described by a log-normal distribution with a mean of $r_{\rm e}=133^{+13}_{-12}$ pc and a standard deviation of $\sigma_{{\rm ln}r_{\rm e}} = 0.52 \pm 0.08$. The standard deviation is comparable to that of local galaxies, indicating no significant evolution over $z\sim 0-10$. We estimate the virial radius $r_{\rm vir}$ from the stellar masses via the star-formation main sequence and stellar-to-halo mass relation, obtaining a stellar-to-halo size ratio $r_{\rm e}/r_{\rm vir} = 0.015^{+0.015}_{-0.005}$, which is comparable to those of star-forming galaxies in the local and low-$z$ Universe. Our results of 1) the log-normal $r_{\rm e}$ distribution, 2) the standard deviation value, and 3) a mean radial profile consistent with an exponential profile ($n=1.3\pm0.6$) suggest that galaxies at $z\sim10-16$ generally follow the classical galaxy disk formation scenario with a specific disk angular momentum fraction of $j_{\rm d} / m_{\rm d} \sim 0.5-1$. Interestingly, we identify two remarkable outliers GN-z11 ($z_{\rm spec}=10.60$) and GHZ2 ($z_{\rm spec}=12.34$) with $r_{\rm e}=55^{+5}_{-6}$ pc and $39\pm11$ pc, respectively, that may not be explained by disk structures but by AGN or compact star-forming galaxies merging underway in short periods of time, as reproduced in numerical simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 In protoplanetary disks, the water snowline marks the location where ice-rich pebbles sublimate, releasing silicate grains and water vapor. These processes can trigger pile-ups of solids, making the water snowline a promising site for forming planetesimals. However, previous studies exploring the pile-up conditions typically employ 1D, vertically-averaged and isothermal assumptions. In this work, we investigate how a 2D flow pattern and realistic temperature structure affect the pile-up of pebbles at the snowline and how latent heat effects can leave observational imprints. We perform 2D (R-Z) multifluid hydrodynamic simulations, tracking chemically heterogeneous pebbles and the released vapor. With a recent-developed phase change module, the mass transfer and latent heat exchange during ice sublimation are calculated self-consistently. The temperature is calculated by a two-stream radiation transfer method under various opacities and stellar luminosity. We find that vapor injection at the snowline drives a previously unrecognized outflow, leading to a pile-up of ice outside the snowline. Vapor injection also decreases the headwind velocity in the pile-up, promoting planetesimal formation and pebble accretion. In active disks, we identify a water-cycle: after ice sublimates in the hotter midplane, vapor recondenses onto pebbles in the upper, cooler layers, which settle back to the midplane. This cycle promotes ice-trapping at snowline. Latent heat exchange flattens the temperature gradient across the snowline, broadening the width while reducing the peak solid-to-gas ratio of pile-ups. Due to the water cycle, active disks are more conducive to planetesimal formation than passive disks. The significant temperature dip (~ 40K) caused by latent heat cooling manifests as an intensity dip in the dust continuum, presenting a new channel to identify the water snowline in outbursting systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate interpretation of observations relies on the interstellar dust extinction law, which also serves as a powerful diagnostic for probing dust properties. In this study, we investigate the multi-wavelength extinction law of the quiescent, starless molecular cloud Coalsack and explore its potential variation across different interstellar environments: the surrounding region, the nearby high Galactic latitude region, the inner dense region, and the inner diffuse region. Using a sample of 368,524 dwarf stars selected from Gaia DR3 as tracers, we establish the effective temperature Teff-intrinsic color relations to derive the intrinsic color indices and optical-mid-infrared (MIR) color excess (CE) for 20 bands. Linear fits to the CE-CE diagrams provide color excess ratios (CERs), which are subsequently converted into relative extinction. The resulting extinction curves for different environments exhibit steep slopes in the near-infrared (NIR) and flat profiles in the MIR. In the optical-NIR range, the Coalsack extinction law is consistent with R_V = 3.1 while in the MIR it follows R_V= 5.5 similar to the results of active star-forming clouds. At an angular resolution of 1.3', our extinction map reveals fine cloud structures. No correlation is found between R_V and E(B-V) for E(B-V) > 0.3 mag, implying a uniform optical extinction law in the Coalsack cloud. The derived average R_V value is 3.24.

 - **Abstract**
 We present [NII] 205 $\mu$m fine structure line observations of three submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) and three quasar host galaxies at 4$\lesssim$z$\lesssim$6 using the Institut de radioastronomie millimetrique (IRAM) interferometer. The [NII] emission is detected in three sources, and we report detections of the underlying dust continuum emission in all sources. The observed [NII]-to-infrared luminosity ratio spans at least 0.5 dex for our sources. Comparing our estimates with sources detected in the [NII] 205 $\mu$m at similar redshifts shows that the overall [NII]-to-IR luminosity ratio spans over a dex in magnitude from L$_{[NII]}$/L$_{IR}$ ~ 10$^{-4}$ - 10$^{-5}$ and follows the trend of the so-called [NII] fine structure line deficit observed in (ultra)-luminous infrared galaxies in the local Universe. The [CII]-to-[NII] luminosity ratio is >10 for most of our sources, indicating that the bulk of the [CII] 158 $\mu$m line emission (f([CII]$^{PDR}$)>75%) arises from the neutral medium. From our analysis, we do not find significant differences in the [NII] 205 $\mu$m emission and the respective ratios between SMGs and QSOs, suggesting a negligible contribution to the boosting of [NII] 205 $\mu$m emission due to the active galactic nucleus (AGN) photoionization. Future investigations involving other fine structure lines and optical diagnostics will provide further insight into a suite of ionized medium properties and reveal the diversity between AGN and non-AGN environments.

 - **Abstract**
 Large-scale anisotropy, with amplitudes reaching approximately 0.1% at TeV energies, has been observed by multiple cosmic-ray experiments. The obstruction of cosmic rays by the Sun and Moon creates shadow effects, potentially impacting the observed cosmic ray anisotropy. To evaluate these effects, this study calculates the contributions of the Sun's and Moon's shadows to the overall cosmic-ray anisotropy in both local solar and sidereal time. The analysis reveals that in local sidereal time, the total 1D projection amplitude of the anisotropy is around 0.003%, which is significantly smaller than the observed cosmic-ray anisotropy. This indicates that the influence of the Sun's and Moon's shadows on cosmic-ray anisotropy analysis in local sidereal time is negligible. In contrast, in local solar time, the shadow-induced deficit appears in a very small time bin, with a magnitude comparable to that of the cosmic-ray solar anisotropy. This deficit could serve as a benchmark for validating anisotropy measurements in future facilities.

 The relationship between an active galactic nucleus (AGN) and its host galaxy is still far from being understood. Properties of the host galaxies of Seyfert nuclei, such as luminosity concentration, morphological type, metallicity, and age of the stellar population are expected to be related with nuclear activity -- either at the epoch of galaxy formation or in the present days via feeding of the central black-hole. In this paper we investigate whether stellar ages and metallicities are linked to the activity within the nucleus in a sample of AGN of various types. Our sample includes seven AGN, from Seyfert 1 to LINERs, observed with VLT/ISAAC and VLT/SINFONI. Based on an inverse method using a stellar library, we analyse H band infrared spectra, in a wavelength region devoid of emission lines, at a spectral resolution of about 3000, in the central few 100 pc. HST images are used to visualise the regions defined in each galaxy. For each galaxy, we give the results of the spectral synthesis, in particular the percentages of the stellar, power law and blackbody continua, and the percentages of various stellar types that account for the stellar lines. Out of the seven galaxies, three show strong and recent star formation in the inner 100 pc, while no star formation is detected in the three genuine Seyfert 2 galaxies. Beyond a radius of 100 pc, all show more or less recent star formation. Moreover we can conclude that the star formation history of the inner nucleus is highly heterogeneous.

 - **Abstract**
 One of the primary goals of Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER)-like X-ray missions is to impose stringent constraints on the neutron star equation of state by precisely measuring their masses and radii. NICER has recently expanded the dataset of inferred mass-radius relations for neutron stars, including four rotation-powered millisecond pulsars PSR J0030+0451, PSR J0740+6620, PSR J0437-4715, and PSR J1231-1411. In this work, the mass-radius relation and X-ray emitting region properties of PSR J1231-1411 are inferred with an independent pulse profile modeling based on the spherical star Schwarzschild-spacetime and Doppler approximation. With one single-temperature elongated hot spot and one single-temperature crescent hot spot, the inferred gravitational mass is $M = 1.12 \pm 0.07 M_{\odot}$ and the inferred equatorial radius is $R_{eq} = 9.91_{-0.86}^{+0.88}$ km (68% credible intervals). It provides an alternative geometry configuration of the X-ray emitting region for PSR J1231-1411 to sufficiently explain the observation data of NICER and XMM-Newton. The inferred radius is smaller than that derived by \citet{salmi2024nicer} ($M = 1.04_{-0.03}^{+0.05} M_{\odot}$, $R_{eq} = 12.6 \pm 0.3$ km), and the inferred mass is slightly higher in this work. The inferred geometry configurations of the X-ray emitting region in both works are non-antipodal, which is not consistent with a centered dipole magnetic field and suggests a complex magnetic field structure.

 - **Abstract**
 Billions of isolated stellar-mass black holes (IBHs) are thought to wander through the interstellar medium (ISM) in the Galaxy, yet only one has been detected. IBHs embedded in ISM would accrete gas via Bondi-Hoyle-Littleton accretion, and with efficient magnetic flux accumulation, the magnetosphere would be formed in the vicinity of IBHs. We explore the detectability of such IBHs through high-energy gamma rays from spark gaps in their magnetospheres based on our recent numerical simulation. The gap gamma rays can be bright at the GeV-TeV energies when IBHs are in the dense ISM. About $10^3$ and $10$ IBHs might be contained in unidentified objects of the $\textit{Fermi}$ Large Area Telescope and the High Energy Stereoscopic System, respectively. A future Galactic plane survey by the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory would lead to $\sim10^2$ detections. We also evaluate the combined gamma-ray emission of IBHs in the Galaxy and find that the IBHs may contribute to the Galactic diffuse gamma rays. IBHs will emit optical and X-ray photons from their accretion disk as counterparts, potentially useful for identifying candidates.

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate limb-darkening models are needed for accurate characterisation of eclipsing binary stars and transiting exoplanets from the analysis of their light curves. The limb-darkening observed in solar-type stars from the analysis of light curves for transiting hot-Jupiter exoplanets are systematically less steep than predicted by stellar model atmospheres that do not account for the stellar magnetic field. Hot-Jupiter host stars tend to be metal rich ([Fe/H] ~0.25) leading to a lack of low- and solar-metallicity targets in previous studies, so we have analysed the TESS light curves for a sample of 19 stars with transiting M-dwarf companions to extend the range of limb-darkening measurements to [Fe/H] values more typical for solar-type stars. We find that the systematic offset between the observed and predicted limb-darkening profiles observed in metal-rich hot-Jupiter systems is also observed for these solar-type stars at lower metallicity. These observations provide additional measurements to explore the impact of magnetic fields on the atmospheres of solar-type stars. We have also used the TESS light curves to make precise estimates of the radius and effective temperature of the M-dwarf companions in these 19 binary systems. We confirm the results from previous studies that find very low mass stars tend to be about 3 per cent larger than predicted by stellar models that use a mixing length prescription calibrated on the Sun.

 - **Abstract**
 To study the role of the feedback from the Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) in the evolution of its host galaxy, we need observational constraints on 100 pc scales. We used the Gemini Near Infrared Integral Field Spectrograph in the J and K bands at a spatial resolution of 100 pc and spectral resolution of 45 km\,s$^{-1}$ to observe the central region of the Seyfert galaxy NGC1125. Emission-line flux distributions in ionized and molecular gas extends up to $\approx$ 300\,pc from the nucleus, where they are found to peak. The Pa$\beta$ and [Fe\,{\sc ii}]$\lambda$1.2570$\mu$m emission-lines show two components: a narrow and a broad. The narrow component is preferably extended from the north-east to the south-west, while the broad component is perpendicular to it. Their kinematics are also different, with the narrow component showing a rotation pattern, with low velocity dispersion values ($\sigma$ $\approx$ 140 km s$^{-1}$) and the broad component a disturbed velocity field and high values of $\sigma$ ($\approx$ 250 km s$^{-1}$). We interpreted the narrow component velocity fields as due to gas rotating in the galaxy plane and fitted rotation velocity models to it, plus an outflow component in the ionized gas. The broad component is interpreted as an outflow, with mass outflow rate in the range of 0.6 to 1.1 M$_{\sun}$ yr$^{-1}$, with an outflow power ranging from 3.9$\times$10$^{40}$ to 1.1$\times$10$^{41}$ erg\,s$^{-1}$, which represents 0.07\% and 0.2\% of the bolometric luminosity of the AGN. There is an explicit relation between the shock ionized outflow and the low-luminosity radio source.

 - **Abstract**
 The issue of over-predicting the galaxy-galaxy lensing (GGL) signal using conventional galaxy-halo connection models has become well-known as the ``Lensing is Low'' problem, which has been extensively investigated using the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) galaxy samples. This issue is also tightly related to the so-called $S_8$ tension. By applying our Photometric objects Around Cosmic webs (PAC) method to the BOSS survey and the DESI deep photometric survey, we obtained hundreds of cross-correlation measurements to establish an accurate galaxy-halo connection for BOSS galaxies through the halo abundance matching technique (Paper IV). With this galaxy-halo connection, we show in this work that the predicted GGL signals for BOSS galaxies both in the Planck and WMAP Universes actually agree very well with the GGL measurements. We find the best-fitting value $S_8 = 0.8294 \pm 0.0110$, $0.8073 \pm 0.0372$ and $0.8189 \pm 0.0440$ for the CMASS samples with the source galaxies from HSC, DES and KiDS image surveys, respectively. Our work indicates that accurate modeling of the lens population is so critical to interpret the GGL observation. For the scale of $r_p < 0.6\,h^{-1}\rm{Mpc}$, our GGL prediction for LOWZ samples are also in good agreement with the observations of HSC and DES. However, the GGL observation of KiDS is much lower on the small scale. Our results indicate that no significant baryon feedback is needed to suppress the small scale clustering unless the the GGL observation of KiDS on the small scale will be confirmed.

 - **Abstract**
 High-mass prestellar cores are extremely rare. The search for such objects has long been hindered by small sample sizes, leading to large uncertainties in their lifetimes and the conditions in which high-mass stars ($> 8\,M_{\odot}$) form. We leverage the large sample ($\sim 580$ cores) detected in the ALMA-IMF survey to identify both protostellar and prestellar cores and estimate their relative lifetimes. We use CO and SiO outflows to identify protostellar cores and introduce a new automated method based on aperture line emission and background subtraction to systematically detect outflows associated with each of the 141 most massive cores. Massive cores that do not drive an outflow in either tracer are classified as prestellar. Our method enables efficient outflow detection with performance comparable to more traditional techniques. We identify 30 likely prestellar cores with $M > 8\,M_{\odot}$, including 12 with $M > 16\,M_{\odot}$, the best candidates for high-mass star precursors. Most of these 12 cores reside in the crowded central regions of protoclusters, where high-mass stars are expected to form. Using prestellar-to-protostellar core ratios and a 300 kyr protostellar lifetime, we estimate prestellar lifetimes of 120 to 240 kyr for $8\,M_{\odot} < M < 16\,M_{\odot}$ and 50 to 100 kyr for $30\,M_{\odot} < M < 55\,M_{\odot}$. These timescales, which depend on different mass reservoir evolution scenarios, significantly exceed the 4 to 15 kyr free-fall time of the cores, suggesting that high-mass cores persist for 10 to 30 free-fall times. This indicates that collapse is slowed by turbulence, magnetic fields, or rotation at or below the observed scale.

 - **Abstract**
 S-shaped radio galaxy jets are prime sources for investigating the dynamic interplay between the central active galactic nucleus, the jets, and the ambient intergalactic medium. These sources are excellent candidates for studying jet precession, as their S-shaped inversion symmetry strongly indicates underlying precession. We present a multiwavelength analysis of the giant inversion-symmetric S-shaped radio galaxy PKS 2300-18, which spans 0.76 Mpc. The host is a quasar at a redshift of 0.128, displaying disturbed optical morphology due to an ongoing merger with a companion galaxy. We conducted a broadband radio spectral study using multifrequency data ranging from 183 MHz to 6 GHz, incorporating dedicated observations with the uGMRT and JVLA alongside archival radio data. A particle injection model was fitted to the spectra of different regions of the source to perform ageing analysis, which was supplemented with a kinematic jet precession model. The ageing analysis revealed a maximum plasma age of ~ 40 Myr, while the jet precession model indicated a precession period of ~ 12 Myr. ROSAT data revealed an X-ray halo of Mpc size, and from Chandra the AGN X-ray spectrum was modelled using thermal and power-law components. The optical spectrum displaying double-peaked broad emission lines was modelled, indicating complex broad-line region kinematics at the centre with the possibility of a binary SMBH. We present the results of our multiwavelength analysis of the source, spanning scales from a few light-days to a few Mpc, and discuss its potential evolutionary path.

 - **Abstract**
 The intrinsic alignment of galaxies is a major astrophysical contaminant to weak gravitational lensing measurements, and the study of its dependence on galaxy properties helps provide meaningful physical priors that aid cosmological analyses. This work studies for the first time the dependence of intrinsic alignments on galaxy structural parameters. We measure the intrinsic alignments of bright galaxies, selected on $r$-band magnitude $r<20$, in the Kilo-Degree Survey. Machine-learning-based photometric redshift estimates are available for this galaxy sample that help obtain a clean measurement of its intrinsic alignment signal. We supplement this sample with a catalogue of structural parameters from Sérsic profile fits to the surface brightness profiles of the galaxies. We split the sample in galaxy intrinsic colour, luminosity and Sérsic index, and we fit the non-linear linear alignment model to galaxy position - shape projected correlation function measurements at large scales. We observe a power-law luminosity dependence of the large-scale intrinsic alignment amplitude, $A_\mathrm{IA}$, for both the red and high Sérsic index ($n_s>2.5$) samples, and find no significant difference between the two samples. We measure a $\sim1.5\sigma$ lower $A_\mathrm{IA}$ for red galaxies that also have a Sérsic index $n_s<4$, compared to the expected amplitude predicted using sample's luminosity. We also probe the intrinsic alignment of red galaxies as a function of galaxy scale by varying the radial weight employed in the shape measurement. We find no significant difference on large scales but on small scales, alignments increase with galaxy scale. For intrinsically blue galaxies, we find $A_\mathrm{IA}=-0.67\pm1.00$, consistent with previous works. We also find alignments to be consistent with zero for the low Sérsic index ($n_s<2.5$) sample.
#### The Effect of Rotation on Triggering S Doradus Instabilities in Luminous Blue Variables

 - **Abstract**
 Luminous blue variables are an intermediate stage in the evolution of high-mass stars characterized by extreme mass loss and substantial variability. The stars show large irregular episodic variations on timescales of years to decades in these stars' effective temperatures (called "S Dor variations"). Observations show that these variations are triggered when the stars are in a well-defined strip in the HRD that corresponds to the Modified Eddington Limit, where the atmospheric radiation pressure almost balances gravity. In this work we consider the role that rotation plays in the instability that leads to the triggering of S Dor variations in luminous post-main sequence LBVs. We adopt the existing instability criterion that the effective surface gravity is reduced to 10% of the Newtonian gravity due to radiation pressure in the atmosphere of non-rotating stars. We then specifically describe how rotation impacts this instability. By carrying out numerical simulations of model LBVs at both solar and sub-solar metallicities, we confirm that most LBVs should be unstable at both the equator and the poles, and that rotation exacerbates this effect; some models also produce enhanced mass loss at the pole or equator. Our numerical models also predict dense equatorial disks or rings and high-velocity bipolar outflows, in agreement with existing observations of LBV circumstellar nebulae.

 - **Abstract**
 In a poster presentation for IAU Symposium 392: "Neutral hydrogen in and around galaxies in the SKA era", we gave an overview of the HI-MaNGA project which is working to obtain complementary information about the cold gas (neutral hydrogen traced by the radio 21cm line) content of Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) sample galaxies. MaNGA, part of the fourth incarnation of the Sloan Digital Sky Surveys (SDSS-IV), obtained spatially resolved spectral maps for 10,000 nearby galaxies selected to create a representative sample out of the SDSS Main Galaxy Sample. MaNGA data have provided a census of the stellar and ionized gas content of these galaxies, as well as kinematics of both stars and gas. Adding HI information via the HI-MaNGA program, which has observed or collected 21cm line data for 70% of the full MaNGA sample, has been crucial for a number of applications, but especially understanding the physical mechanisms that regulate gas accretion, and through that star formation and quenching of star formation. This conference proceedings article accompanies the release of the DR3 version of HI-MaNGA data.

 - **Abstract**
 A previously faint young stellar object (YSO), V557 Mon, rapidly brightened in late 2024 and is currently at least $\Delta G=3.3$ magnitudes brighter than its typical pre-outburst brightness. The ongoing outburst is identified in the Gaia Alerts system as Gaia24djk. We obtained a 1-2.5 $\mu$m spectrum of the object and find the spectrum is dominated by line emission and continuum excess consistent with rapid YSO accretion, similar to the star EX Lup during its outburst state. We speculate that the burst, which has not yet reached its peak brightness, may become an FU Ori outburst, which would be evidenced by the emission spectrum turning into an absorption spectrum.

 - **Abstract**
 A neutrino-like event with an energy of $\sim 220 \,{\rm PeV}$ was recently detected by the KM3NeT/ARCA telescope. If this neutrino comes from an astrophysical source, or from the interaction of an ultra-high-energy cosmic ray in the intergalactic medium, the ultra-high-energy gamma rays that are co-produced with the neutrinos will scatter with the extragalactic background light, producing an electromagnetic cascade and resulting in emission at GeV-to-TeV energies. In this paper, we compute the gamma-ray flux from this neutrino source considering various source distances and strengths of the intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF). We find that the associated gamma-ray emission could be observed by existing imaging air cherenkov telescopes and air shower gamma-ray observatories, unless the strength of the IGMF is $B\gtrsim 3\times 10^{-13}$ G, or the ultra-high-energy gamma-rays are attenuated inside of the source itself. In the latter case, this source is expected to be radio-loud.
#### Comparison of methods used to derive the Galactic star formation history from white dwarf samples

 - **Abstract**
 We compare three methods of deriving the local Galactic star formation history, using as a benchmark the Gaia-defined 40 pc white dwarf sample, currently the largest volume complete sample of stellar remnants with medium-resolution spectroscopy. We create a population synthesis model to 1) reproduce the observed white dwarf luminosity function, 2) reproduce the observed absolute Gaia G magnitude distribution, and 3) directly calculate the ages of all individual white dwarfs in the 40 pc volume. We then compare the star formation histories determined from each method. Previous studies using these methods were based on different white dwarf samples and as such were difficult to compare. Uncertainties in each method such as the initial mass function, initial-final mass relation, main sequence lifetimes, stellar metallicity, white dwarf cooling ages and binary evolution are accounted for to estimate the precision and accuracy of each method. We conclude that no method is quantitatively better at determining the star formation history and all three produce star formation histories that agree within uncertainties of current external astrophysical relations.
