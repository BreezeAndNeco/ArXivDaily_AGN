 - **Abstract**
 We conducted an in-depth analysis of NGC 6793 open cluster via Gaia DR3 data, including astrometric, spectroscopic, and photometric measurements. Selection of 147 stars, which show membership probabilities $P\geq0.5$ were classified as likely members. The mean trigonometric parallaxes and proper-motion components of the cluster were found to be $\varpi = 1.674 \pm0.045$ mas and ($\mu_{\alpha}\cos \delta$,~$\mu_{\delta}$) =($3.814\pm0.031$,~$3.547\pm0.034$) mas yr$^{-1}$. Fundamental astrophysical parameters of NGC 6793 are derived simultaneously as $t$ = $650 \pm 50$ Myr, $\mu$ = $9.508\pm0.070$ mag, and $E(G_{\rm BP}-G_{\rm RP})$ = $0.361 \pm 0.035$ mag. Additionally, the cluster's luminosity function analysis reveals the $G$-absolute magnitude limit of the most likely stars, indicating a well-defined stellar population. The total mass of the cluster, determined through the mass function (MF) and considering stars with membership probabilities $P \geq 0.5$, was estimated as 139 $\pm$ 12 $M/M_{\odot}$. The slope of the MF was found to be $\Gamma = 1.40 \pm 0.26$, a result consistent with the Salpeter value. The kinematic analyses present velocity ellipsoid parameters as well as the convergent point $(A_{\rm o},~D_{\rm o}) = \left(85^{\circ}.85 \pm 0^{\circ}.11,~3^{\circ}.12 \pm 0^{\circ}.57\right)$. Analyses have shown that it is moving in a box-shaped orbit beyond the Sun's galactic radius and belongs to the thin disk population of the Milky Way. The calculated relaxation time suggests that NGC 6793 has reached a dynamically relaxed state, where the dynamical evolution parameter $\tau$ significantly exceeds one. These results highlight both the cluster's internal stability and its connection to the thin disc population.
#### Spectropolarimetry of A Nuclear Transient AT2023clx: Revealing The Geometrical Alignment between The Transient Outflow and The Nuclear Dusty Region

 - **Abstract**
 AT2023clx, which occurred in NGC3799 with a Low-Ionization Nuclear Emission-Line Region (LINER), is one of the most nearby nuclear transients classified as a tidal disruption event (TDE). We present three-epoch spectropolarimetric follow-up observations of AT2023clx. We detected two polarization components; one is a constant polarization of $\sim 1\%$ originated from an aspherical outflow associated with the transient, while the other is a blue-excess polarization up to $\sim 2\%$ originated from a nuclear dusty environment via light echoes. Between the two epochs, the polarization angle flipped by 90 degrees, indicating that the direction of the outflow was aligned perpendicular to the dust plane. Such polarization features -- the blue excess and the 90-degree flip -- have never been observed in previous TDE polarization samples, highlighting unique mechanisms behind AT2023clx. We propose possible scenarios to naturally explain the polarization features: the disruption of a star captured by a nuclear dusty cloud around the black hole or a star formed within the cloud. Given the LINER nature of NGC3799, the dusty region may possibly be linked to a torus or disk associated with a weak Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN). Furthermore, as a more speculative scenario, the event might have been triggered by AGN-like activity, potentially linked to changing-look AGNs or ambiguous nuclear transients.

 - **Abstract**
 From the survival of dust disks for a few Myr to the establishment of chemical dichotomy, dust traps are expected to play a pivotal role in sculpting protoplanetary disks and the early planet formation process. These traps however may not be perfect as evidenced by the detection of gas and dust inside the gaps and cavities of structured disks. Using two-fluid hydrodynamic global simulations in both two-dimensions (2D) and three-dimensions (3D), we directly compute the dynamics of dust grains as they aerodynamically interact with the disk gas that is being perturbed by an embedded planet of varying mass. In both 2D and 3D, we find the dust trap to be more leaky for lower mass planet and for higher turbulent $\alpha$. More crucially, we find the fraction of the dust mass that remain trapped within the pressure bump can be up to an order of magnitude more reduced in 3D vs. 2D with all else equal. Our simulations show a complex behavior of dust radial motion that is both azimuthally and poloidally non-uniform, with the overall dynamics dominated by the dust coupling to the gas flow even for relatively high St = 0.1. The leaky traps we find suggest pebble isolation mass is likely not truly isolating and that gap-opening planets do not establish as an unconditional impermeable barrier. Our findings have implications for recent JWST MINDS results, which show that volatiles, including water, are present in the inner regions of disks hosting outer dust rings.

 - **Abstract**
 NGC 5972, a Voorwerp galaxy, features a helical-shaped extended emission-line region (EELR) with a radius > 10 kpc and a S-shaped radio structure spanning about 470 kpc. We use VLT MUSE, GMRT, and VLA to study the stellar and ionized gas kinematics and how the radio jet influences the gas in the galaxy. Our sensitive radio observations detect the southern jet for the first time, roughly coinciding with the southern EELR. The VLA images show a continuous inner jet connected to the outer E-W lobe, confirming the jet origin of the radio emission. Our kinematic analysis shows spatial correlations between the radio jet and the outflowing gas, supporting the jet-driven feedback mechanism. More interestingly, we observe enhanced velocity dispersion in the perpendicular direction along with a shell-like structure. Our BPT analysis shows that the [O III] emission overlapping with the radio jet is consistent with the shock+precursor model, whereas in the perpendicular region, a pure shock model fits well with the observations, indicating jet-induced shocks. Radio observations indicate episodic AGN activity characterized by surface brightness and spectral index discontinuities. Overall, based on our findings, we propose a jet-driven feedback mechanism as one of the key factors in the formation of the EELR in NGC 5972. Future high-resolution radio observations will be crucial to further investigate the origin of the EELR and quantify the extent to which the jet influences its formation and evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) are significant drivers of geomagnetic activity, and understanding these structures is critical to developing and improving forecasting tools for space weather. The Solar Orbiter (SolO) mission, with its comprehensive set of remote sensing and in-situ instruments, along with its unique orbit, is significantly advancing the study of the CMEs and other structures in the heliosphere. A critical contribution to the study of CMEs by SolO is the observations from the Solar Orbiter Heliospheric Imager (SoloHI). SoloHI observes photospheric visible light scattered by electrons in the solar wind and provides high-resolution observations of the corona and heliosphere. The resolution and vantage point offered by SoloHI make it uniquely well-suited to study CME evolution in the heliosphere. We present the initial release of a living CME catalog based on SoloHI observations during its initial years of observations, with a multi-viewpoint focus. We catalog 140 events detected by SoloHI during the period of January 2022 until April 2023. For each event detected by SoloHI, we present available in-situ data and remote sensing observations detected by other missions. We identify the source region of the CME and describe its main characteristics, track the CME through the coronagraphs and heliospheric imagers, and provide in-situ detection when possible. We also provide a morphological classification and observations quality parameter based on the SoloHI observations. Additionally, we cross-check with other available CME catalogs and link to the event description provided by the Space Weather Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information (DONKI) catalog. We provide various observing scenarios with SoloHI observations to demonstrate the contribution that this catalog offers to the scientific community to explore the new observing viewpoint of CMEs with the SolO mission.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the MIRI EGS Galaxy and AGN (MEGA) survey, a four band MIRI survey with 25 pointing in the Extended Groth Strip (EGS) extragalactic field. Three of the pointings utilized only the three reddest bands (F1000W, F1500W, F2100W) while the remainder of the pointings also add a blue filter (F770W). MEGA builds upon the existing observations in the EGS field by providing MIRI imaging for 68.9% of CEERS NIRCam imaging, filling a cruciality gap in order to understand galaxy evolution by observing the obscured Universe. Here, we present the technical design, data reduction, photometric catalog creation, the first data release, and science drivers of the MEGA survey. Our data reduction starts with the standard JWST calibration pipeline, but adds additional warm pixel masking and custom background subtraction steps to improve the quality of the final science image. We estimate the image depth of the reduced mosaics and present new galaxy number counts in four MIRI bands.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy groups represent a significant fraction of the halo population, playing a crucial role in galaxy formation and evolution. However, their detection in X-rays remains challenging, raising questions about the physical mechanisms driving their detectability in current surveys. Using the Magneticum simulations, we construct a mock X-ray lightcone of the local Universe ($z<0.2$) to investigate the selection function of galaxy groups and clusters. We find that AGN activity is a key driver of baryon depletion, but late-time mergers boost X-ray brightness by replenishing the gas reservoir in the halos, highlighting the interplay between feedback processes and the environment. Our analysis shows that X-ray bright groups experience sustained late-time mass accretion, maintaining higher gas fractions and fueling the central supermassive black holes (SMBH), further increasing the X-ray emissivity in the core. In contrast, X-ray faint groups form earlier and lose most of their gas over time, resembling fossil groups. Magneticum predicts strong anti-correlations between gas fraction (or X-ray luminosity) and SMBH mass, stellar mass (both in the central galaxy and intracluster light), and group richness at fixed halo mass. We derive predictions on the hot gas fraction at fixed halos mass (e.g. a group of total mass $M_{500}=10^{13} M_{\odot}$ can have hot gas fractions in the range $f_\mathrm{gas}=0.02-0.06$ and a central SMBH with a median mass of $M_\mathrm{BH}=10^9 M_{\odot}$ and a scatter of $0.5$ dex) compatible with the most recent measurements of the baryonic fraction. These findings will aid the interpretation of future X-ray surveys, demonstrating the power of simulation-based inference.

 - **Abstract**
 The amplification of magnetic fields is crucial for understanding the observed magnetization of stars and galaxies. Turbulent dynamo is the primary mechanism responsible for that but the understanding of its action in a collapsing environment is still rudimentary and relies on limited numerical experiments. We develop an analytical framework and perform numerical simulations to investigate the behavior of small-scale and large-scale dynamos in a collapsing turbulent cloud. This approach is also applicable to expanding environments and facilitates the application of standard dynamo theory to evolving systems. Using a supercomoving formulation of the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations, we demonstrate that dynamo action in a collapsing background leads to a super-exponential growth of magnetic fields in time, significantly faster than the exponential growth seen in stationary turbulence. The enhancement is mainly due to the increasing eddy turnover rate during the collapse, which boosts the instantaneous growth rate of the dynamo. We also show that the final saturated magnetic field strength exceeds the expectation from considerations of pure flux-freezing or energy equipartition with the turbulence, scaling as $B \propto \rho^{5/6}$, where $\rho$ is the cloud density. Apart from establishing a formal framework for the studies of magnetic field evolution in collapsing (or expanding) turbulent plasmas, these findings have significant implications for early star and galaxy formation, suggesting that magnetic fields can be amplified to dynamically relevant strengths much earlier than previously thought.

 - **Abstract**
 Global temperatures in Jupiter's upper atmosphere are poorly constrained. Other than an in situ measurement by the Galileo Probe, all temperature data come from remote sensing methods which primarily rely on emissions from H$_3^+$, the dominant molecular ion in giant planet ionospheres. While H$_3^+$ temperature serves as a proxy for thermospheric temperature under specific conditions, the available H$_3^+$ observations at Jupiter have limited spatial coverage and a wide range of reported temperatures that complicate analysis of atmospheric temperatures. We present high resolution H$_3^+$ temperature maps near local solar noon collected over three half-nights in 2022 and 2023. Pole-to-pole temperature structure is consistent across time spans of one month to one year. Median equatorial ($\pm$ 25° latitude) temperature across all three nights is 762 $\pm$ 43 K, with night-to-night differences of $<$75 K. Temperatures within the statistical locations of the northern and southern auroral ovals are 1200 $\pm$ 96 K and 1143 $\pm$ 120 K, respectively. A region $\sim$30 K cooler than its surroundings is found near 20° N, 90° W System III longitude, roughly coincident with a magnetic field anomaly, providing additional evidence for magnetic influence on Jupiter's upper atmosphere. Temperatures generally decrease smoothly from auroral to equatorial latitudes, consistent with the expected gradient if Jupiter's non-auroral latitudes are heated primarily by dynamical redistribution of auroral energy.

 - **Abstract**
 We perform one-dimensional protoplanetary disk evolution calculations to investigate the impact of the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) disk wind on disk evolution and dust particle this http URL examine the effect of the MHD disk wind, we compare calculations with and without it. In disk evolution calculations, episodic accretion events (or outbursts) occur repeatedly, as reported in previous studies, regardless of the presence of the MHD disk wind. However, the time interval between outbursts is shorter in cases with the MHD disk wind than in those without it. For dust particle growth, during the infall phase, there is no significant difference between cases with and without the MHD disk wind, and dust particles grow to approximately 1-10\,cm. Inside the $\mathrm{H_{2}O}$ snowline, the maximum dust particle size is limited by the collisional fragmentation of dust particles. Outside the snowline, the maximum dust particle size is primarily determined by radial drift. After the infall phase, when the MHD disk wind is considered, the disk temperature decreases noticeably, and the snowline migrates inward. As a result, the dust particles can grow beyond 10\,cm. Therefore, we find that the MHD disk wind plays a crucial role in dust growth and planet formation after the infall phase.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic reconnection in magnetized wakes of cosmic strings results in the release of a large amount of energy. This energy is released in a short period of time. In this work, we show that this sudden release of energy can result in a Gamma Ray Burst (GRB) of short duration. The magnetic reconnection occurs at several points of the cosmic string wake. The emerging shocks from these points have different velocities. These shocks will collide with each other and give rise to short bursts of energy. The emitted pulse of energy depends on the background magnetic field and the timescale associated with the magnetic reconnection in the cosmic string wake. We also obtain the synthetic lightcurve that occurs from multiple collisions of the shock waves that are emitted from the multiple points of magnetic reconnection in the wake region. Finally, we discuss about some current experimental evidence of short GRBs which are in the same energy range as the ones predicted from our model.

 - **Abstract**
 Radio experiments trying to detect the global $21$-cm signal from the early Universe are very sensitive to the electrical properties of their environment. For ground-based experiments with the antenna above the soil it is critical to characterize the effect from the soil on the sky observations. This characterization requires estimating the soil's electrical conductivity and relative permittivity in the same frequency range as the observations. Here we present our initial effort to estimate the conductivity and relative permittivity of the soil using the impedance of an antenna mounted at a distance above the surface. The antenna used is part of the MIST global $21$-cm experiment. We measured the antenna impedance at three sites in the Greater Concepción area, Chile. The measurements were done between $25$ and $125$ MHz, matching the range used by MIST for sky observations. The soil parameters were estimated by fitting the impedance measurements with electromagnetic simulations of the antenna and soil. In this initial effort the soil was modeled as homogeneous. The conductivity at the three sites was found to be between $0.007$ and $0.049$ Sm$^{-1}$, and the relative permittivity between $1.6$ and $12.7$. The percent precision of the estimates at $68\%$ probability is, with one exception, better (lower) than $33\%$. The best-fit simulations have a better than $10\%$ agreement with the measurements relative to the peak values of the resistance and reactance across our frequency range. For MIST, these results represent a successful proof of concept of the use of the antenna impedance for soil characterization, and are expected to significantly improve in future implementations.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the final data release of the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS-DR5), a public European Southern Observatory (ESO) wide-field imaging survey optimised for weak gravitational lensing studies. We combined matched-depth multi-wavelength observations from the VLT Survey Telescope and the VISTA Kilo-degree INfrared Galaxy (VIKING) survey to create a nine-band optical-to-near-infrared survey spanning $1347$ deg$^2$. The median $r$-band $5\sigma$ limiting magnitude is 24.8 with median seeing $0.7^{\prime\prime}$. The main survey footprint includes $4$ deg$^2$ of overlap with existing deep spectroscopic surveys. We complemented these data in DR5 with a targeted campaign to secure an additional $23$ deg$^2$ of KiDS- and VIKING-like imaging over a range of additional deep spectroscopic survey fields. From these fields, we extracted a catalogue of $126\,085$ sources with both spectroscopic and photometric redshift information, which enables the robust calibration of photometric redshifts across the full survey footprint. In comparison to previous releases, DR5 represents a $34\%$ areal extension and includes an $i$-band re-observation of the full footprint, thereby increasing the effective $i$-band depth by $0.4$ magnitudes and enabling multi-epoch science. Our processed nine-band imaging, single- and multi-band catalogues with masks, and homogenised photometry and photometric redshifts can be accessed through the ESO Archive Science Portal.

 - **Abstract**
 We present cosmic shear constraints from the completed Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS), where the cosmological parameter $S_8\equiv\sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3} = 0.815^{+0.016}_{-0.021}$, is found to be in agreement ($0.73\sigma$) with results from the Planck Legacy cosmic microwave background experiment. The final KiDS footprint spans $1347$ square degrees of deep nine-band imaging across the optical and near-infrared, along with an extra $23$ square degrees of KiDS-like calibration observations of deep spectroscopic surveys. Improvements in our redshift distribution estimation methodology, combined with our enhanced calibration data and multi-band image simulations, allow us to extend our lensed sample out to a photometric redshift of $z_{\rm B}\leq2.0$. Compared to previous KiDS analyses, the increased survey area and redshift depth results in a $\sim32\%$ improvement in constraining power in terms of $\Sigma_8\equiv\sigma_8\left(\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3\right)^\alpha = 0.821^{+0.014}_{-0.016}$, where $\alpha = 0.58$ has been optimised to match the revised degeneracy direction of $\sigma_8$ and $\Omega_{\rm m}$. We adopt a new physically motivated intrinsic alignment model that depends jointly on the galaxy sample's halo mass and spectral type distributions, and that is informed by previous direct alignment measurements. We also marginalise over our uncertainty on the impact of baryon feedback on the non-linear matter power spectrum. Comparing to previous KiDS analyses, we conclude that the increase seen in $S_8$ primarily results from our improved redshift distribution estimation and calibration, as well as new survey area and improved image reduction. Our companion paper Stölzner et al. (submitted) presents a full suite of internal and external consistency tests, finding the KiDS-Legacy data set to be the most internally robust sample produced by KiDS to date.

 - **Abstract**
 This is the third article in a series aimed at computing accurate and precise ages of galactic globular clusters from their full color-magnitude diagram in order to estimate the age of the Universe and in turn constrain the cosmological model. We update previous constraints using additional data and an improved methodology which allows us to vary the helium abundance and the reddening law in addition to the usual parameters (age, metallicity, alpha enhancement, distance and absorption) in the analysis. Even with the additional degrees of freedom, using the full color-magnitude diagram, now described as a Gaussian mixture Bayesian hierarchical model, a tight constraint on the age(s) of the globular clusters and on the other parameters can be obtained, and the statistical errors are fully subdominant to the systematic errors. We find that the age of the oldest globular clusters is $t_{\rm GC} = 13.39 \pm 0.10 ({\rm stat.}) \pm 0.23 ({\rm sys.})$ Gyr, resulting in an age of the Universe $t_{\rm U}=13.57^{+ 0.16}_{-0.14} ({\rm stat})\pm 0.23 ({\rm sys.})$ and a robust 95\% confidence upper limit of $t_U^{\leq}=13.92_{-0.1}^{+0.13}({\rm stat}) \pm{0.23} ({\rm sys})$. This is fully compatible with our previous estimates and with the model-dependent, Cosmic Microwave Background-derived age for the Universe of $t_{\rm U} =13.8 \pm 0.02$ Gyr for a $\Lambda$CDM model.

 (Abridged) The identification of AGN and SB regions in galaxies is crucial for understanding the role of various physical processes in galaxy evolution. Molecular line ratios, such as the HCN/HCO+ ratio, have been proposed as potential tracers of these distinct environments. This paper aims to assess the reliability of the HCN/HCO+ ratio, from J = 1-0 to J = 4-3 transitions, as a diagnostic tool for differentiating AGN and SB activity across a diverse sample of nearby galaxies. We focus on evaluating the effect of spatial resolution on the robustness of these ratios and investigate the underlying physical conditions that drive observed variations. We compile observations of HCN and HCO+ lines across multiple J transitions from various sources, covering different galaxy types, including Seyferts, starbursts, and (ultra-)luminous infrared galaxies (U/LIRGs). The observations span spatial scales from cloud-sized regions to kiloparsec scales. We analyse the behaviour of these ratios at varying resolutions and employ non-LTE radiative transfer models to infer the physical conditions that drive the observed ratios. We find that the HCN/HCO+ ratio from higher J transitions can differentiate between AGN and SB activity when observed at high spatial resolution. This distinction occurs around unity. However, at lower resolutions, contamination from multiple emission sources and beam averaging effects destroy these distinctions. Modelling suggests that elevated HCN/HCO+ ratios in AGN-dominated regions are largely driven by an enhancement in HCN abundance relative to HCO+, likely due to high-temperature chemistry or increased excitation. Our study confirms that the HCN/HCO+ ratio, particularly of higher J transitions, can be a reliable tracer of AGN versus SB activity if observations are conducted at sufficiently high spatial resolution.

 Understanding the formation and evolution of the Milky Way's thin and thick discs is crucial to galaxy formation studies. We derive age and metallicity distributions of the kinematic thick and thin discs using the this http URL pipeline and Gaia DR3 data within 250 pc of the Sun, covering 1 kpc in height. Our results show that the kinematic thick disc is mostly older than 10 Gyr, undergoing three main metallicity enrichment episodes: (1) over 12 Gyr ago, peaking at [M/H] $\sim$ -0.5 dex, (2) $\sim$11 Gyr ago, rapidly increasing to solar [M/H] and spanning [$\alpha$/Fe] from 0.3 to solar, and (3) just over 10 Gyr ago, reaching supersolar metallicities. Meanwhile, the kinematic thin disc began forming $\sim$10 Gyr ago, just as thick disc star formation ended, characterized by supersolar metallicities and low [$\alpha$/Fe]. This transition coincides with the Milky Way's last major merger: Gaia-Sausage Enceladus (GSE). We also identify a subset of kinematic thin disc stars older than 10 Gyr with high/intermediate [$\alpha$/Fe], indicating a transition phase. The age-metallicity relation of the thin disc suggests overlapping star formation episodes and radial mixing in the solar neighborhood, with the greatest spread $\sim$6 Gyr ago. Additionally, we detect an isolated thick disc star formation event at solar metallicity, coinciding with Sagittarius' first pericenter passage. These findings provide precise age-metallicity distributions and star formation rates, offering key insights for chemical evolution models and cosmological simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive analysis of the extended emission line region (EELR) in the host galaxy of the tidal disruption event (TDE) AT2019qiz, utilizing VLT/MUSE integral-field spectroscopy. The high spatial-resolution data reveal a bi-conical emission structure approximately $3.7~\mathrm{kpc}$ in scale within the galactic center, characterized by a prominent [OIII] line in the nucleus and significant [NII] line emission extending into the EELR. Spectral analysis of the EELR indicates line ratios consistent with Seyfert ionization in the center and LINER-type ionization in the outer diffuse region, suggesting ionization from galactic nuclear activity. The required ionizing luminosity, estimated from the H$\rm{\alpha}$ and H$\rm{\beta}$ luminosities based on the photoionization and recombination balance assumption, is $10^{41.8}$ $\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$ for all spaxels classified as AGN, and $10^{40.7}$ $\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$ for spaxels in the central $0.9~\mathrm{kpc}$ Seyfert region. However, the current bolometric luminosity of the nucleus $L_{\text{bol}} \leq 10^{40.8}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$, estimated from quiescent-state soft X-ray observations, is insufficient to ionize the entire EELR, implying a recently faded AGN or a delayed response to historical activity. Stellar population analysis reveals a post-starburst characteristic in the EELR, and the gas kinematics show disturbances and non-circular components compared to the stellar kinematics. Notably, the recent detection of quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) in the X-ray light curve of AT2019qiz confirms the TDE-QPE association. Our findings provide direct evidence for an AGN-like EELR in the host galaxy of the nearest TDE with QPE detection, offering new insights into the complex interplay between TDEs, QPEs, AGN activity, and host galaxy evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: The environments of young star clusters are shaped by the interactions of the powerful winds of massive stars, and their feedback on the cluster birth cloud. Several such clusters show diffuse gamma-ray emission on the degree scale, which hints at ongoing particle acceleration. Aims: To date, particle acceleration and transport in star-cluster environments are not well understood. A characterisation of magnetic fields and flow structures is necessary to progress toward physical models. Previous work has largely focused on 100 pc scale feedback or detailed modelling of wind interaction of just a few stars. We aim to bridge this gap. We focus in particular on compact clusters to study collective effects arising from stellar-wind interaction. Objects in this class include Westerlund 1 and R136. Methods: We perform 3D ideal-MHD simulations of compact, young, massive star clusters. Stellar winds are injected kinetically for 46 individual very massive stars (M > 40 Msun), distributed in a spherical region of radius 0.6 - 1 pc. We include a sub-population of five magnetic stars with increased dipole field strengths of 0.1 - 1 kG. We study the evolving superbubble over several 100 kyrs. Results: The bulk flow and magnetic fields show an intricate, non-uniform morphology, which is critically impacted by the relative position of individual stars. The cluster wind terminates in a strong shock, which is non-spherical and, like the flow, has non-uniform properties. The magnetic field is both composed of highly tangled sections and coherent quasi-radial field-line bundles. Steep particle spectra in the TeV domain arise naturally from the variation of magnetic field magnitude over the cluster-wind termination shock. This finding is consistent with gamma-ray observations. The scenario of PeV particle acceleration at the cluster-wind termination shock is deemed unlikely.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are luminous, dispersed pulses of extra-galactic origin. The physics of the emission mechanism, the progenitor environment, and their origin are unclear. Some repeating FRBs are observed to have frequency-dependent exponential suppression in linear polarisation fraction. This has been attributed to multipath propagation in a surrounding complex magneto-ionic environment. The magnitude of depolarisation can be quantified using the parameter $\rm \sigma^{\prime}_{RM}$, which can be used to model the magneto-ionic complexity of the medium. In addition to depolarisation, some repeating sources (in particular those with active magneto-ionic environments) have been identified to have co-located persistent radio sources (PRS). Searches for depolarisation of non-repeating sources are challenging due to the limited bandwidth of most FRB detection systems used to detect one-off bursts. However, even with a limited bandwidth, such depolarisation can be identified if it lies within the $\rm \sigma^{\prime}_{RM}$ sensitivity window of the telescope. In this paper, we present a search for depolarisation in $12$ one-off FRBs detected by the Australian SKA Pathfinder. We report on the first strongly depolarised FRB detected by ASKAP (FRB$~$20230526A) and a marginal detection of depolarisation in a second. We also report constraints on the presence of a PRS coincident with FRB$~$20230526A using observations obtained with the Australia Telescope Compact Array. We use this to study the relationship between $\rm \sigma^{\prime}_{RM}$ and PRS luminosity. Our investigation supports a scenario in which repeaters and non-repeaters share a common origin and where non-repeaters represent an older population relative to repeating FRBs.

 - **Abstract**
 The gas density profile around galaxies, shaped by feedback and affecting the galaxy lensing signal, is imprinted on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) by the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (kSZ). We precisely measure this effect ($S/N\approx 10$) via velocity stacking with $825,283$ spectroscopically confirmed luminous red galaxies (LRG) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Y1 survey, which overlap with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) Data Release 6 temperature maps over $\geq 4,000 \text{deg}^2$. We explore the kSZ dependence with various galaxy parameters. We find no significant trend with redshift, but clear trends with stellar mass and absolute magnitude in $g$, $r$, and $z$ bands. We highlight new challenges when comparing data and hydrodynamical simulations. Our simple and most conservative analysis suggests that the gas is more extended than the dark matter (99.5% confidence, i.e. PTE = 0.005). It also hints at a preference for galaxy formation models with more feedback (Illustris $z=0.5$, PTE = 0.37) rather than less (Illustris TNG $z=0.8$, PTE = 0.045), though with less statistical significance. In all cases, a free multiplicative amplitude was fit to the simulated profiles, and further modeling work is required to firm up these conclusions. We find consistency between kSZ profiles around spectroscopic and photometric LRG, with comparable statistical power, thus increasing our confidence in the photometric analysis. Additionally, we present the first kSZ measurement around DESI Y1 bright galaxy sample (BGS) and emission-line galaxies (ELG), whose features match qualitative expectations. Finally, we forecast $S/N \sim 50$ for future stacked kSZ measurements using data from ACT, DESI Y3, and Rubin Observatory. These measurements will serve as an input for galaxy formation models and baryonic uncertainties in galaxy lensing.

 - **Abstract**
 We detail new force-free simulations to investigate magnetosphere evolution and precursor electromagnetic (EM) signals from binary neutron stars. Our simulations fully follow a representative inspiral motion, capturing the intricate magnetospheric dynamics and their impact on EM outflows. We explore a range of stellar magnetic moment orientations and relative strengths, finding that the magnetospheres and Poynting flux evolution are strongly configuration-dependent. The Poynting flux exhibits pulsations at twice the orbital frequency, $2\Omega$, and is highly anisotropic, following a power-law dependence on orbital frequency. The index ranges from 1 to 6, shaped by the intricate dynamics of the magnetospheres. Furthermore, we present the first computation of: (1) The EM forces acting on the star surfaces, revealing the presence of torques that, for highly-magnetized stars, could influence the orbital dynamics or break the crust. (2) The high-energy emission signals from these systems by adopting the established isolated pulsar theory. Assuming curvature radiation in the radiation reaction limit, we find that photons could reach TeV--PeV energies in the last $\sim$~ms for magnetic field strengths $10^{10}-10^{15}$~G. However, our analysis of single photon magnetic pair production suggests that these photons are unlikely to escape, with the MeV band emerging as a promising observational window for precursor high-energy emission. In this framework, we construct high-energy emission skymaps and light curves, exploring observational implications. Finally, we propose potential precursor radio emission and delayed afterglow echoes from magnetized outflows, which may contribute to late-time re-brightening in short gamma-ray bursts or to orphan afterglows.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Various element transport processes modify the photospheric chemical composition of low-mass stars during their evolution. The most prominent one is the first dredge-up that occurs at the beginning of the red giant branch. Then, various extra-mixing processes, such as those caused by thermohaline- and/or rotation-induced mixing, come into action. The extent of the influence of stellar magnetic activity on alterations in stellar chemical composition is among the least studied questions. Aims. To investigate how magnetic activity influences mixing in the atmospheres of magnetically active stars, we carried out a detailed study of C, N, and up to ten other chemical element abundances, as well as carbon isotope ratios in a sample of RS CVn stars. Methods. Using a differential model atmosphere method, we analysed high-resolution spectra that had been observed with the VUES spectrograph on the 1.65 m telescope at the Moletai Astronomical Observatory of Vilnius University. Abundances of other chemical elements were determined from equivalent widths or spectral syntheses of unblended spectral lines. Results. We determined the main atmospheric parameters and abundances of up to 12 chemical elements for a sample of 20 RS CVn giants that represented different evolutionary stages. We determined that *29 Dra, *b01 Cyg, and V* V834 Her, which are in the evolutionary stage below the red giant branch luminosity bump, already show evidence of extra-mixing in their lowered carbon isotope ratios. Conclusions. We provide observational evidence that in low-mass chromospherically active RS CVn stars, due to their magnetic activity, extra-mixing processes may start acting below the luminosity bump of the red giant branch.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Solar eruptions are crucial for space weather studies. Understanding the mechanisms influencing their evolution is key to improving predictions of their geoeffectiveness. Helmet streamers (HSs) are persistent structures in the solar corona, present in both minimum and maximum solar activity periods. These structures contain a current sheet of low magnetic energy, where coronal mass ejections (CMEs) tend to deflect. However, they also feature a closed magnetic field region beneath this sheet, often confining eruptions. Their complexity makes predicting eruptions challenging. Aims: This study examines how HSs influence the evolution and potential confinement of magnetic flux ropes (MFRs). We explore magnetic configurations where the MFR is more likely to rise through the overlying field, aiming to establish simple parameters that help predict whether an MFR will ascend or remain confined. Methods: Using 2.5D MHD simulations, we model MFR dynamics in the presence of an HS, analyzing different magnetic configurations and focusing on the mechanisms that enable ascent or confinement. Results: Null-point reconnection plays a key role in MFR dynamics. Depending on the initial configuration, it can either disrupt the MFR, preventing ascent, or reduce the strapping flux, facilitating upward motion. We identify a critical threshold: if the strapping flux above the MFR is less than two-thirds of its poloidal flux, the MFR ascends successfully. Conclusions: Our simulations show that null-point reconnection significantly impacts MFR ascent. A key predictor of successful rise is the initial ratio of the MFR's poloidal flux to the strapping flux above it.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the AGN-galaxy co-evolution, feedback processes, and the evolution of Black Hole Accretion rate Density (BHAD) requires accurately estimating the contribution of obscured Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). However, detecting these sources is challenging due to significant extinction at the wavelengths typically used to trace their emission. We evaluate the capabilities of the proposed far-infrared observatory PRIMA and its synergies with the X-ray observatory NewAthena in detecting AGN and in measuring the BHAD. Starting from X-ray background synthesis models, we simulate the performance of NewAthena and of PRIMA in Deep and Wide surveys. Our results show that the combination of these facilities is a powerful tool for selecting and characterising all types of AGN. While NewAthena is particularly effective at detecting the most luminous, the unobscured, and the moderately obscured AGN, PRIMA excels at identifying heavily obscured sources, including Compton-thick AGN (of which we expect 7500 detections per deg$^2$). We find that PRIMA will detect 60 times more sources than Herschel over the same area and will allow us to accurately measure the BHAD evolution up to z=8, better than any current IR or X-ray survey, finally revealing the true contribution of Compton-thick AGN to the BHAD evolution.
