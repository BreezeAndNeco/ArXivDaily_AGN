 - **Abstract**
 The Be/X-ray binary pulsar RX J0440.9+4431 underwent a giant outburst in late 2022 and lasted three months. The Insight-HXMT has observed this source at several instances of the entire outburst in 2022-2023. We used these bright outburst observations of the pulsar to study its X-ray spectral and timing variability. The pulse profiles obtained at similar luminosity during the progress and declining phases of the outburst show a similar shape this http URL the increase in source luminosity, the complex pulse profile with multiple peaks at low luminosity becomes a single peaked pulse profile at the high luminosity at the outburst peak. The phase-averaged spectra of the pulsar in 1-120 keV are explained with an absorbed cutoff power-law continuum model. During the outburst phases, we have found the evidence of a cyclotron resonance scattering feature in the spectra varying in energies ($\sim$ 33.6- 41.6 keV) having broad linewidth > 5 keV . In declining phases of the outburst, we have also found the hints of first cyclotron harmonic varying in 65-75 keV . The application of thermal and bulk Comptonization model to the phase-averaged and phase-resolved spectra reveals a high surface magnetic field ($B \sim 10^{13}$ G) for the pulsar.

 - **Abstract**
 Using high-resolution AthenaK simulations of a twisted toroidal flux tube, we study the flux emergence of magnetic structures in the shear layer of a hot massive neutron star typical of a binary neutron star remnant. High-resolution simulations demonstrate that magnetic buoyant instabilities allow for emergence only for extremely large magnetic fields significantly exceeding $10^{17}~\mathrm{G}$, and more typical fields around $10^{16}~\mathrm{G}$ are instead dominated by hydrodynamic effects. Because merger remnants tend to be stable against hydrodynamic convection, our work places strong limitations on the mechanisms by which massive binary neutron star remnants can produce the magnetically-driven outflows needed to power jets.

 - **Abstract**
 The recent discovery of five massive stellar clusters at z=9.625 in the Cosmic Gems has raised the question about the formation mechanism of star clusters in the first half Gyr after the Big-Bang. We infer the total stellar mass in clusters by normalizing and integrating the stellar cluster mass function (SCMF, dn(M)/dM ~ (n$_0$) $M^\beta$), assuming three different slopes $\beta$ = -1.5, -2.0 and -2.5 and different lower-mass limits between $10^2$ and $10^5$ Msun. The total integrated cluster stellar mass is compared to the stellar mass inferred from the counter-image of the Cosmic Gems, which provides the best, modestly magnified ($\mu$ = 1.84$\pm$0.05) representation of the entire galaxy. The delensed stellar mass of the Cosmic Gems galaxy is estimated as 3.5$_{-1.8}^{+3.3}$ x$10^7$ Msun, with an effective radius of Reff = 103$_{-15}^{+13}$ parsec and a stellar surface mass density of $\Sigma$mass = 520$_{-225}^{+340}$ Msun pc$^{-2}$. Accounting for normalization uncertainties - including different lensing magnification scenarios for the arc - a modified SCMF, combined with a significantly high star cluster formation efficiency (approaching 100%), appears to be a necessary condition to explain the relatively short formation timescale of both the star clusters and the counter-image, without exceeding the galaxy's stellar mass. By extrapolating the physical properties at the peak of the burst we find that in its recent past (<~ 30 Myr) the Cosmic Gems galaxy has likely experienced a specific star formation rate (sSFR) exceeding 25 Gyr$^{-1}$ and luminosity approaching the ``blue monster'' regime (M$_{UV}$ < -20). Our study provides insights into the extreme clustered nature of star formation in early galaxies and shed light into the formation of bound star clusters that might survive to z = 0 as globular clusters, older than 13 Gyr.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we aim to further populate the low-mass regime of black hole (BH) scaling relations to better understand the formation and growth mechanisms of central supermassive BHs. We target six galaxies that have been previously identified as hosting active galactic nuclei (AGN) based on optical spectroscopy from the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey or the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) with stellar masses reported to be M$_\star < 5 \times 10^9$ M$_\odot$. Using follow-up optical spectroscopy from the Magellan Echellette Spectrograph (MagE), we extract galaxy velocity dispersions ($\sigma_\star$) and estimate virial BH masses from broad H$\alpha$ emission. We find that the galaxies in our sample do not deviate significantly from either the M$_{BH}-\sigma_\star$ or M$_{BH}-$M$_{\star}$ scaling relations defined by higher mass galaxies. Additionally, we identify one galaxy with triple-peaked SII, NII, H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ emission lines. This spectral shape is not shared by OIII and, in fact, the OIII line appears to have distinct kinematics from the other emission lines. Incorporating the spatial distribution of the various emission lines, we find that the galaxy spectrum is consistent with a prominent central AGN driving an outflow, surrounded by an extended ring/disk of gas predominantly ionized by shocks and/or star formation. This work has implications for the demographics of BHs in low-mass galaxies and the role of AGN feedback.
#### JWST Spectroscopic Confirmation of the Cosmic Gems Arc at z=9.625 -- Insights into the small scale structure of a post-burst system

 - **Abstract**
 We present JWST/NIRSpec integral field spectroscopy of the Cosmic Gems arc, strongly magnified by the galaxy cluster SPT-CL J0615$-$5746. Six-hour integration using NIRSpec prism spectroscopy (resolution $\rm R\simeq 30-300$), covering the spectral range $0.8-5.3~\mu m$, reveals a pronounced $\rm Ly\alpha$-continuum break at $\lambda \simeq 1.3~\mu m$, and weak optical $\rm H\beta$ and $\rm [OIII]\lambda4959$ emission lines at $z=9.625\pm0.002$, located in the reddest part of the spectrum ($\lambda > 5.1~\mu m$). No additional ultraviolet or optical emission lines are reliably detected. A weak Balmer break is measured alongside a very blue ultraviolet slope ($\beta \leq-2.5$, $\rm F_{\lambda} \sim \lambda^{\beta}$). Spectral fitting with $\tt Bagpipes$ suggests the Cosmic Gems galaxy is in a post-starburst phase, making it the highest-redshift system currently observed in a mini-quenched state. Spatially resolved spectroscopy at tens pc scales shows relatively uniform features across subcomponents of the arc. These findings align well with physical properties previously derived from JWST/NIRCam photometry of the stellar clusters, now corroborated by spectroscopic evidence. In particular, five observed star clusters exhibit ages of $\rm 7-30~Myr$. An updated lens model constrains the intrinsic sizes and masses of these clusters, confirming they are extremely compact and denser than typical star clusters in local star-forming galaxies. Additionally, four compact stellar systems consistent with star clusters ($\lesssim10$ pc) are identified along the extended tail of the arc. A sub-parsec line-emitting HII region straddling the critical line, lacking a NIRCam counterpart, is also serendipitously detected.

 - **Abstract**
 X-ray bright cool-core (CC) clusters contain luminous radio sources accelerating cosmic ray (CR) leptons at prodigious rates. Near the acceleration region, high-energy leptons produce synchrotron (mini)halos and sometimes observable gamma rays, but these leptons have short lifetimes and so cannot propagate far from sources without some rejuvenation. However, low-energy (~0.1-1 GeV) CRs should survive for >Gyr, potentially reaching ~100 kpc before losing energy via inverse-Compton (IC) scattering of CMB photons to keV X-ray energies, with remarkably thermal X-ray spectra. In groups/clusters, this will appear similar to relatively 'cool' gas in cluster cores (i.e. CCs). In lower-mass (e.g. Milky Way/M31) halos, analogous CR IC emission will appear as hot (super-virial) gas at outer CGM radii, explaining recent diffuse X-ray observations. We show that for plausible (radio/gamma-ray observed) lepton injection rates, the CR-IC emission could contribute significantly to the X-ray surface brightness (SB) in CCs, implying that CC gas densities may have been overestimated and alleviating the cooling flow problem. A significant IC contribution to diffuse X-ray emission in CC clusters also explains the tight correlation between the X-ray 'cooling luminosity' and AGN/cavity/jet power, because the apparent CC emission is itself driven by the radio source. Comparing observed Sunyaev Zeldovich to X-ray inferred pressures at $\ll 100$ kpc in CCs represents a clean test of this scenario, and existing data appears to favor significant CR-IC. A significant IC contribution also implies that X-ray inferred gas-phase metallicities have been underestimated in CCs, potentially explaining the discrepancy between X-ray (sub-Solar) and optical/UV (super-Solar) observed metallicities in the central ~10 kpc of nearby CCs. We also discuss the model's connection to observations of multiphase gas in clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 We derive semi-analytic solutions for the thermally driven cumulative outflow from a dense stellar cluster that consists of a large number of stars with strong stellar winds, under the key assumption that their mass and energy deposition can be treated as a continuous source of thermalized wind material. Our approach provides explicit analytic forms for the flow critical radius and sound speed, which then allows for full solution by inward/outward integration from this critical radius. Application to previous models that assume either a power-law or exponential mass deposition allows a direct comparison of their velocity solutions. We then obtain solutions for new models that have mass depositions with a gaussian or the empirically motivated forms derived by Plummer and Elson. Comparisons show that, when cast in terms of the radius scaled by the critical radius, the overall velocity laws are all quite similar, asymptotically approaching the energy-averaged stellar wind speed $V_w$, and anchored to passing through a common critical/sonic speed $v_c = V_w/2$. By deriving associated variations in outflow density and temperature, we obtain scaling forms for the expected X-ray emission, and show that radiative cooling generally represents only a small correction to the assumed cooling from adiabatic expansion. An initial analysis of incomplete wind thermalization suggests this should likewise have modest effect on the overall outflow in dense clusters. The simplified semi-analytic method presented here can be readily applied to alternative mass depositions and so form a basis for interpreting results from detailed numerical simulations of outflows from young stellar clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 The carbon monoxide (CO) spectral line energy distributions (SLEDs) of galaxies contain a wealth of information about conditions in their cold interstellar gas. Here we use galaxy-scale observations of the three lowest energy CO lines to determine SLEDs and line ratios in a sample of 47 nearby, predominantly star forming galaxies. We find systematic trend of higher gas excitation with increasing star formation rate (SFR) and SFR surface density ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$), with the range of variations being even larger than predicted by simulations. Power law fits of the CO line ratios as a function of SFR and $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ provide a good description of the trends seen in our sample and also accurately predict values for a wide range of galaxy types compiled from the literature. Based on these fits, we provide prescriptions for estimating CO(1-0) luminosities and molecular gas masses using CO(3-2) or CO(2-1) in cases where CO(1-0) is not observed directly. We compare our observed SLEDs with molecular cloud models in order to examine how the physical properties of cold gas vary across the galaxy population. We find that gas conditions in star forming and starburst galaxies lie on a continuum with increasing gas density in more actively star forming systems.

 - **Abstract**
 A theory of cosmic-ray transport in multi-phase diffusive media is developed, with the specific application to cases in which the cosmic-ray diffusion coefficient has large spatial fluctuations that may be inherently multi-scale. We demonstrate that the resulting transport of cosmic rays is diffusive in the long-time limit, with an average diffusion coefficient equal to the harmonic mean of the spatially varying diffusion coefficient. Thus, cosmic-ray transport is dominated by areas of low diffusion even if these areas occupy a relatively small, but not infinitesimal, fraction of the volume. On intermediate time scales, the cosmic rays experience transient effective sub-diffusion, as a result of low-diffusion regions interrupting long flights through high-diffusion regions. In the simplified case of a two-phase medium, we show that the extent and extremity of the sub-diffusivity of cosmic-ray transport is controlled by the spectral exponent of the distribution of patch sizes of each of the phases. We finally show that, despite strongly influencing the confinement times, the multi-phase medium is only capable of altering the energy dependence of cosmic-ray transport when there is a moderate (but not excessive) level of perpendicular diffusion across magnetic-field lines.

 - **Abstract**
 The injection of magnetic helicity into the heliosphere during solar cycle 24 and the early phase of cycle 25 has been calculated based on the analysis of a series of synoptic magnetic charts. During the cycle, the injected magnetic helicity is found to be mainly contributed by the magnetic field in active regions. According to Hale's law, the polarities of active regions statistically reverse between solar cycles 24 and 25. We suggest that the dominant source of injected magnetic helicity likely arises from the relatively strong magnetic fields of the leading polarity of active regions. This occurs as part of the magnetic field that migrates to high latitudes and the polar regions of the Sun due to the effect of meridional circulation inferred from a series of HMI/SDO magnetic synoptic charts. Significant fluctuations of the injected magnetic helicity from the subsurface layers may reflect the complex processes of how the twist from the convection zone ejects magnetic fields through a series of active regions on different temporal and spatial scales at the solar surface.

 - **Abstract**
 Unveiling the sources of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays remains one of the main challenges of high-energy astrophysics. Measurements of anisotropies in their arrival directions are key to identifying their sources, yet magnetic deflections obscure direct associations. In this work, we reconstruct the sky regions of possible origin of the highest-energy cosmic-ray events detected by the Pierre Auger Observatory by tracing their trajectories through Galactic magnetic fields using up-to-date models, while fully accounting for energy and directional uncertainties. A mixed composition at injection is assumed to model the detected charge distributions of such events. Different classes of astrophysical sources are investigated and tested for a correlation with the inferred regions of origin of the events. By incorporating constraints on the maximum propagation distances, we also allow for a three-dimensional localization of the possible source regions. Our findings provide new constraints on the sources of the highest-energy cosmic particles and offer fresh insights into the role of Galactic magnetic fields in shaping the observed ultra-high-energy cosmic-ray sky.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed study of the magnetic field structure in the G111 molecular cloud, a ring-like filamentary cloud within the NGC 7538 region. We utilized interstellar dust polarization from the Planck telescope to trace large-scale field orientations, starlight extinction polarization from the Kanata telescope to probe the cloud's magnetic field after foreground subtraction, and velocity gradients derived from CO isotopologues, observed with the IRAP 30m telescope, to examine dense regions. Our results reveal a coherent yet spatially varying magnetic field within G111. We correct the significant foreground dust contamination through careful subtraction. We observe a global alignment of the magnetic field with density structures suggesting that the field is dynamically important in shaping the cloud. The curved magnetic field along the dense regions, coinciding with mid-infrared emission in WISE data, indicates shock compression, likely driven by stellar feedback or supernova remnants. Our findings support a scenario where G111's morphology results from turbulent shock-driven compression. The interplay between magnetic fields and external forces is crucial in shaping and maintaining the structure of the molecular cloud. Future high-resolution observations will be essential to further constrain the magnetic field's role in cloud evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 The age distribution function of star clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is known to present a feature called the cluster age gap, a period of time from ~ 4 to 11 Gyr ago with a remarkable small number of clusters identified. In this work we performed an in-depth analysis of three recently catalogued age gap cluster candidates with the aim of confirming their physical nature. We used GEMINI@GMOS g,i photometry centred on the objects to build colour-magnitude diagrams from which we recognised their main features. We also performed an automatic search of stellar overdensities using Gaussian mixture model techniques and analysed the corresponding colour-magnitude diagrams similarly as performed for the aforementioned candidates. The present GEMINI data sets would seem to discard any strong evidence of these object being real clusters, and rather support the possibility of the result of stellar density variations of the LMC field star distribution. These three objects, in addition to other 17 new identified candidates, are placed in the LMC outermost disc in a limited region toward the southwest from the LMC centre. They had embraced the possibility to answer the long-time conundrum about the absence of LMC age gap clusters. From an statistical approach, combined with the knowledge of the expected LMC age-metallicity relationship, and recent simulations of the interaction between the LMC and the Milky Way, we provide not only evidence against the physical nature of the studied objects, but also an interpretation on the lack of identification of more LMC age gap clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 The polar mid-infrared (MIR) emission detected from tens to hundreds of parsecs in some active galactic nuclei (AGN) has been associated with dusty winds driven away by radiation pressure. However, the physical characterization of this extended polar emission remains uncertain. Here we combine $10-21\mu$m JWST/MIRI imaging observations with $7-25 \mu$m MRS integral field spectroscopic observations of 6 nearby, $\bar{D}=35.4\pm4.6$~Mpc, AGN from the GATOS Survey to quantify the nature of the extended MIR emission at $\sim75$ pc resolution at $21~\mu$m. These AGN have similar bolometric luminosities, $\log_{10}(\bar{L}_{\rm{bol}}~[\rm{erg\,s}^{-1}])=44.0\pm0.3$, span a wide range of optical outflow rates, $\dot{M}=0.003-0.21$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, column densities, $\log_{10}(N_{H}^{X-ray} [cm^{-2}])=22.2-24.3$, and Eddington ratios, $\lambda_{\rm{Edd}}=0.005-0.06$. We find a poor correlation between the line-only and continuum-only images, indicating that the extended MIR continuum emission is spatially uncorrelated with the warm outflows associated with narrow emission lines in the $10-15\,\mu$m wavelength range. The $75-450$~pc continuum emission has constant dust temperature, $T_{\rm{d}}=132^{+7}_{-7}$ K, and mass, $M_{\rm{d}}=728^{+29}_{-27}$ M$_{\odot}$. Using the conditions of energy balance between radiation pressure and gravity, we find that our AGN sample is in the gravitationally bounded regime, consistent with the lack of detection of dusty winds in our observations. At $10~\mu$m, the level of line emission contribution across the NLR is correlated with the outflow kinetic energy and mass outflow rates. We find no correlation with the AGN properties. These results indicate that the radio jet may be triggering the gas outflow and line emission, while the extended dust emission is distributed in molecular clouds and/or shocked regions across the narrow line region.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a study of the cold molecular versus the ionized gas distribution in three nearby Seyfert galaxies: NGC 6860, Mrk 915 and MCG -01-24-012. To constrain the cold molecular flux distribution at $\sim$ 0.5 - 0.8$^{\prime\prime}$ ($\sim$ 150 - 400 pc) scales, we used data from the CO(2-1) emission line, obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). For the ionized gas, we used Hubble Space Telescope (HST) narrow-band images, centered on the [O III]$\lambda\lambda$4959,5007 emission lines. Within the inner kiloparsec of the three galaxies, we observe gaps in the CO emission in regions co-spatial with the [O III] flux distribution, similarly to what has been recently observed in other active galaxies. From our original sample of 13 nearby AGN sources, 12 objects present the same trend. This indicates that CO molecules might be partially dissociated by AGN radiation or that there is a deficit of cold molecular gas on nuclear scales driven by ionized gas outflows/jets. If so, this represents a form of AGN feedback that is not captured when only outflow kinematics properties, such as mass outflow rates, are considered. We also discuss that part of the molecular gas might still be present in hotter H$_2$ phases, as observed already in other objects.
#### The SWAN view of dense gas in the Whirlpool -- A cloud-scale comparison of N2H+, HCO+, HNC and HCN emission in M51

 - **Abstract**
 Tracing dense molecular gas, the fuel for star formation, is essential for the understanding of the evolution of molecular clouds and star formation processes. We compare the emission of HCN(1-0), HNC(1-0) and HCO+(1-0) with the emission of N2H+(1-0) at cloud-scales (125 pc) across the central 5x7 kpc of the Whirlpool galaxy, M51a, from "Surveying the Whirlpool galaxy at Arcseconds with NOEMA" (SWAN). We find that the integrated intensities of HCN, HNC and HCO+ are more steeply correlated with N2H+ emission compared to the bulk molecular gas tracer CO, and we find variations in this relation across the center, molecular ring, northern and southern disk of M51. Compared to HCN and HNC emission, the HCO+ emission follows the N2H+ emission more similarly across the environments and physical conditions such as surface densities of molecular gas, stellar mass, star-formation rate, dynamical equilibrium pressure and radius. Under the assumption that N2H+ is a fair tracer of dense gas at these scales, this makes HCO+ a more favorable dense gas tracer than HCN within the inner disk of M51. In all environments within our field of view, even when removing the central 2 kpc, HCN/CO, commonly used to trace average cloud density, is only weakly depending on molecular gas mass surface density. While ratios of other dense gas lines to CO show a steeper dependency on the surface density of molecular gas, it is still shallow in comparison to other nearby star-forming disk galaxies. The reasons might be physical conditions in M51 that are different from other normal star-forming galaxies. Increased ionization rates, increased dynamical equilibrium pressure in the central few kpc and the impact of the dwarf companion galaxy NGC 5195 are proposed mechanisms that might enhance HCN and HNC emission over HCO+ and N2H+ emission at larger-scale environments and cloud scales.

 - **Abstract**
 The ionization fraction ($f_\mathrm{e}=n_\mathrm{e}/n_\mathrm{H}$) is a crucial parameter of interstellar gas, yet estimating it requires deep knowledge of molecular gas chemistry and observations of specific lines, such as those from isotopologs like HCO$^+$ and N$_2$H$^+$, which are detectable only in dense cores. Previous challenges in constraining $f_\mathrm{e}$ over large areas stemmed from the limitations of observational tracers and chemical models. Recent models have identified molecular line ratios that can trace $f_\mathrm{e}$ in different environments within molecular clouds. In this study, we analyze various molecular lines in the 3-4 mm range to derive the ionization fraction across the Orion B giant molecular cloud. We focus on dense and translucent gas, exploring variations with gas density ($n$) and the far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation field ($G_0$). Our findings show that the ionization fraction ranges from $10^{-5.5}$ to $10^{-4}$ in translucent gas and $10^{-8}$ to $10^{-6}$ in dense gas. Notably, $f_\mathrm{e}$ is sensitive to $G_0$ in dense, UV-illuminated regions, decreasing with increasing volume density ($f_\mathrm{e} \propto n^{-0.227}$ for dense and $f_\mathrm{e} \propto n^{-0.3}$ for translucent gas) and increasing with $G_0$. In translucent gas, differing line ratios yield consistent fe values, indicating the importance of electron excitation of HCN and HNC. For dense gas, we recommend using the CN(1-0)/N$_2$H$^+$(1-0) ratio for upper limits on fe and C$^{18}$O(1-0)/HCO$^+$(1-0) for lower limits. In translucent environments, CCH(1-0)/HNC(1-0) effectively traces $f_\mathrm{e}$. The higher fe values in translucent gas align with the C$^+$/CI/CO transition, while values in dense gas are adequate for coupling with the magnetic field.
