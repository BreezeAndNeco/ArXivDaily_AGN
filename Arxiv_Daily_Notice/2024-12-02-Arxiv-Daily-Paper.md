 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we re-evaluate the estimates of dust mass in galaxies and demonstrate that current dust models are incomplete and based on a priori assumptions. These models suffer from a circularity problem and account for only a small portion of dust, specifically submicron-sized grains. They overlook larger dust particles and other macroscopic bodies, despite observational evidence supporting their existence. This evidence includes the observed (sub)millimeter excess in dust emission spectra and the power-law size distribution with an index {\gamma} ~ 3.5-4.0, which has been measured for large particles and compact bodies across diverse environments. Examples of these large particles include large dust grains and meteoroids detected by satellites, near-Earth objects colliding with Earth, fragments in the Main Asteroid Belt and the Kuiper Belt, interstellar 'Oumuamua-like objects, and exoplanets. As a result, dust-type baryonic dark matter may be more abundant throughout the galaxy by one order of magnitude or even more than previously assumed, with a significant portion of its mass concentrated in large compact bodies. Additionally, black holes may contribute significantly to the total mass of baryonic dark matter. Consequently, current galaxy models do not provide reliable estimates of baryonic mass in galaxies. Clearly, a substantially larger amount of baryonic dark matter in galaxies would have major implications for theories of galaxy dynamics and evolution.
#### Uncovering deterministic behavior of black hole IGR J17091-3624: A twin of GRS 1915+105

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding nonlinear properties in accreting systems, particularly for black holes, from observation is illuminating as they are expected to be general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic flows that are nonlinear. Two features associated with nonlinear systems, used commonly, are chaos, which is deterministic, and random, which is stochastic. The differentiation between chaotic and stochastic systems is often considered to quantify the nonlinear properties of an astrophysical system. The particular emphasis is that data is often noise-contaminated and finite. We examine the dual nature of the black hole X-ray binary IGR J17091-3624, whose behavior has been closely studied in parallel to GRS 1915+105. Certain similarities in the temporal classes of these two objects are explored in literature. However, this has not been the case with their non-linear dynamics: GRS 1915+105 shows signs of determinism and stochasticity both, while IGR J17091-3624 was found to be predominantly stochastic. Here, we confront the inherent challenge of noise contamination faced by previous studies, particularly Poisson noise, which adversely impacts the reliability of non-linear results. We employ several denoising techniques to mitigate noise effects and employ methods like Principal Component Analysis, Singular Value Decomposition, and Correlation Integral to isolate the deterministic signatures. We have found signs of determinism in IGR J17091-3624, thus supporting the hypothesis of it being similar to GRS 1915+105, even as a dynamical system. Our findings not only shed light on the complex nature of IGR J17091-3624, but also pave the way for future research employing noise-reduction techniques to analyze non-linearity in observed dynamical systems.
#### Cosmic Ray Ionization of Low-Excitation Lines in Active Galactic Nuclei and Starburst Galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic rays (CRs) can significantly impact dense molecular clouds in galaxies, heating the interstellar medium (ISM) and altering its chemistry, ionization, and thermal properties. Their influence is particularly relevant in environments with high CR rates, such as starburst galaxies with supernova remnants or jets and outflows in active galactic nuclei (AGN). CRs transfer energy to the ionized phase of the ISM far from the ionization source, preventing gas cooling and driving large-scale winds. In this work, we use CLOUDY to explore the effect of CRs on nebular gas, a relatively underexplored area, mainly focused on cold molecular gas. Our models cover a broad range of density ($1 - 10^4\,\rm{cm^{-3}}$), ionization parameter ($-3.5 \leq \log U \leq -1.5$), and CR ionization rate ($10^{-16}\, \rm{s^{-1}} - 10^{-12}\, \rm{s^{-1}}$). These are compared to MUSE observations of two AGN, Centaurus A and NGC 1068, and the starburst NGC 253. We find that CR rates $\gtrsim 10^{-13}\, \rm{s^{-1}}$, typical of AGN and strong starburst galaxies, can significantly alter the thermal structure of the ionized gas by forming a deep secondary low-ionization layer beyond the photoionization-dominated region. This enhances emission from low-ionization transitions, such as [\ion{N}{ii}], [\ion{S}{ii}], and [\ion{O}{i}], affecting line-ratio diagnostics, metallicity, and ionization estimates. Unlike pure photoionization models, AGN simulations with high CR ionization rates reproduce the Seyfert loci in BPT diagrams without requiring super-solar metallicities for the narrow-line region. Additionally, star formation simulations with high CR ionization rates can explain line ratios in the LINER domain. We propose new maximum starburst boundaries for BPT diagrams to distinguish regions dominated by AGN photoionization from those that could be explained by star formation plus high CR ionization rates.
#### The VELOCE modulation zoo II. Humps and splitting patterns in spectral lines of classical Cepheids

 - **Abstract**
 Line splitting in spectral lines is observed in various types of stars due to phenomena such as shocks, spectroscopic binaries, magnetic fields, spots, and non-radial modes. In pulsating stars, line splitting is often attributed to pulsation-induced shocks. However, this is rarely observed in classical Cepheids, with only a few reports, including X Sagittarii and BG Crucis, where it has been linked to atmospheric shocks. We investigate line splitting in X Sgr and BG Cru using spectroscopic time series, and search for similar phenomena in other classical Cepheids. High signal-to-noise cross-correlation function (CCF) time series from the VELOcities of CEpheids (VELOCE) project are analyzed. This dataset spans several years, allowing us to study the periodicities and evolution of CCF features. For X Sgr and BG Cru, we perform a detailed analysis of the individual components of the split CCFs. Additionally, we search for periodicities in CCF variations and examine other classical Cepheids for distortions resembling unresolved line splitting. We confirm line splitting in X Sgr and BG Cru, trace the features over time, and uncover the periodicity behind them. Several other Cepheids also exhibit CCF humps, suggesting unresolved or marginally resolved line splitting. We discuss the incidence and characteristics of these stars. The periodicity of line splitting in X Sgr and BG Cru differs significantly from the dominant pulsation period, ruling out pulsation-induced shocks. The periodicities are too short for rotation-related phenomena, suggesting non-radial modes as the most likely explanation, though their exact nature remains unknown. We also identify humps in six additional stars, indicating an incidence rate of 3% in the VELOCE sample.
#### Exploring IMF Sampling Effects on Star Formation and Metallicity in Ultra-Faint Dwarf Galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 We examine the impact of various Initial Mass Function (IMF) sampling methods on the star formation and metal enrichment histories of Ultra-Faint Dwarf (UFD) galaxy analogs. These analogs are characterized by $M_{\rm vir}\sim10^8 M_\odot$ and $M_{\ast}\lesssim10^5 M_\odot$ at $z=0$, utilizing high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations with a gas particle mass resolution of $\sim63 M_\odot$. Specifically, we evaluate three IMF sampling techniques: the burst model, stochastic IMF sampling, and individual IMF sampling. Our results demonstrate that the choice of IMF sampling method critically affects stellar feedback dynamics, particularly supernova (SN) feedback, thus impacting the star formation and metallicity characteristics of UFD analogs. We find that simulations with stochastic IMF sampling yield UFD analogs with 40\% to 70\% higher stellar masses than those using the burst model, due to a less immediate suppression of star formation by SNe. The individual IMF method results in even greater stellar masses, 8\% to 58\% more than stochastic runs, as stars form individually and continuously. Star formation is most continuous with individual sampling, followed by stochastic, and least with the burst model, which shows the longest quenching periods. Furthermore, the individual sampling approach achieves higher metallicity stars, aligning well with observed values, unlike the lower metallicities (about 1 dex less) found in the burst and stochastic methods. This difference is attributed to the continuous star formation in individual sampling, where gas metallicity shaped by previous SN events is immediately reflected in stellar metallicity. These findings emphasize the essential role of choosing appropriate IMF sampling methods for accurately modeling the star formation and chemical evolution of UFD galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the internal and external mechanisms that regulate and quench star formation (SF) in galaxies at $z \sim 0.3$ using MAGPI observations and the EAGLE, Magneticum, and IllustrisTNG cosmological simulations. Using SimSpin to generate mock observations of simulated galaxies, we match detection/resolution limits in star formation rates and stellar mass, along with MAGPI observational details including the average point spread function and pixel scale. While we find a good agreement in the slope of the global star-forming main sequence (SFMS) between MAGPI observations and all three simulations, the slope of the resolved SFMS does not agree within 1 $-$ 2$\sigma$. Furthermore, in radial SF trends, good agreement between observations and simulations exists only for galaxies far below the SFMS, where we capture evidence for inside-out quenching. The simulations overall agree with each other between $\sim1.5-4 \ R_{\rm e}$ but show varying central suppression within $R \sim 1.5 \ R_{\rm e}$ for galaxies on and below the SFMS, attributable to different AGN feedback prescriptions. All three simulations show similar dependencies of SF radial trends with environment. Central galaxies are subject to both internal and external mechanisms, showing increased SF suppression in the centre with increasing halo mass, indicating AGN feedback. Satellite galaxies display increasing suppression in the outskirts as halo mass increases, indicative of environmental processes. These results demonstrate the power of spatially resolved studies of galaxies; while global properties align, radial profiles reveal discrepancies between observations and simulations and their underlying physics.

 - **Abstract**
 Images of black holes encode both astrophysical and gravitational properties. Detecting highly-lensed features in images can differentiate between these two effects. We present an accretion disk emission model coupled to the Adaptive Analytical Ray Tracing (AART) code that allows a fast parameter space exploration of black hole photon ring images produced from synchrotron emission from 10 to 670 GHz. As an application, we systematically study several disk models and compute their total flux, photon ring radii, and optical depth. The model parameters are chosen around fiducial values calibrated to general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations and observations of M87*. For the parameter space studied, we characterize the transition between optically thin and thick regimes and the frequency at which the first photon ring is observable. Our results highlight the need for careful definitions of photon ring radius in the image domain, as in certain models, the highly lensed photon ring is dimmer than the direct emission at certain angles. We find that at low frequencies, the ring radii are set by the electron temperature, while at higher frequencies, the magnetic field strength plays a more significant role, demonstrating how multi-frequency analysis can also be used to infer plasma parameters. Lastly, we show how our implementation can qualitatively reproduce multifrequency black hole images from GRMHD simulations when adding time-variability to our disk model through Gaussian random fields. This approach provides a new method for simulating observations from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) and the proposed Black Hole Explorer (BHEX) space mission.

 - **Abstract**
 Disc galaxies represent a promising laboratory for the study of gravitational physics, including alternatives to dark matter, owing to the possibility of coupling rotation curves' dynamical data with strong gravitational lensing observations. In particular, Euclid, DES and LSST are predicted to observe hundreds of thousands of gravitational lenses. Here, we investigate disc galaxy strong gravitational lensing in the MOND framework. We employ the concept of equivalent Newtonian systems within the quasi-linear MOND formulation to make use of the standard lensing formalism. We derive the phantom dark matter distribution predicted for realistic disc galaxy models and study the impact of morphological and mass parameters on the expected lensing. We find purely MONDian effects dominate the lensing and generate non-trivial correlations between the lens parameters and the lensing cross section. Moreover, we show that the standard realisation of MOND predicts a number count of disc galaxy lenses of one order of magnitude higher than the dark matter-driven predictions, making it distinguishable from the latter in upcoming surveys. Finally, we show that disc galaxy gravitational lensing can be used to strongly constrain the interpolating function of MOND.
#### Tidally Delayed Spin-Down of Very Low Mass Stars

 - **Abstract**
 Very low-mass main-sequence stars reveal some curious trends in observed rotation period distributions that require abating the spin-down that standard rotational evolution models would otherwise imply. By dynamically coupling magnetically mediated spin-down to tidally induced spin-up from close orbiting substellar companions, we show that tides from sub-stellar companions may explain these trends. In particular, brown dwarf companions can delay the spin-down and explain the observed bimodality in rotation period distribution of old, late-type M stars. We find that tidal forces also strongly influence stellar X-ray activity evolution, so that methods of gyrochronological aging must be generalized for stars with even sub-stellar companions. We also discuss how the theoretical predictions of the spin evolution model can be used with future data to constrain the population distribution of companion orbital separations.

 - **Abstract**
 To date, SN 2017ein is the only Type Ic supernova with a directly identified progenitor candidate. This candidate points to a very massive ($>$45 $M_\odot$) Wolf-Rayet progenitor, but its disappearance after the explosion of SN 2017ein remains unconfirmed. In this work, we revisit SN 2017ein in late-time images acquired by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) at 2.4--3.8 yrs after peak brightness. We find this source has not disappeared and its brightness and color remain almost the same as in the pre-explosion images. Thus, we conclude that the pre-explosion source is not the genuine progenitor of SN 2017ein. We exclude the possibility that it is a companion star of the progenitor, since it has a much lower extinction than SN 2017ein; its color is also inconsistent with a star cluster, indicated by the newly added magnitude limit in F336W, apart from F555W and F814W. We suggest, therefore, this source is an unrelated star in chance alignment with SN 2017ein. Based on the low ejecta mass, we propose that SN 2017ein is most likely originated from a moderately massive star with $M_{\rm ini}$ $\sim$ 8--20 $M_\odot$, stripped by binary interaction, rather than a very massive Wolf-Rayet progenitor.

 We performed numerical simulations to study mechanisms of solar prominence formation triggered by a single heating event. In the widely accepted ``chromospheric-evaporation condensation" model, localized heating at footpoints of a coronal loop drives plasma evaporation and eventually triggers condensation. The occurrence of condensation is strongly influenced by the characteristics of the this http URL theoretical studies have been conducted along one-dimensional field lines with quasi-steady localized heating. The quasi-steady heating is regarded as the collection of multiple heating events among multiple strands constituting a coronal loop. However, it is reasonable to consider a single heating event along a single field line as an elemental this http URL investigated the condensation phenomenon triggered by a single heating event using 1.5-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations. By varying the magnitude of the localized heating rate, we explored the conditions necessary for condensation. We found that when a heating rate approximately $\sim 10^{4}$ times greater than that of steady heating was applied, condensation occurred. Condensation was observed when the thermal conduction efficiency in the loop became lower than the cooling efficiency, with the cooling rate significantly exceeding the heating rate. Using the loop length $L$ and the Field length $\lambda_{\mathrm{F}}$, the condition for condensation is expressed as $\lambda_{\mathrm{F}} \lesssim L/2$ under conditions where cooling exceeds heating. We extended the analytically derived condition for thermal non-equilibrium to a formulation based on heating amount.

 - **Abstract**
 The detailed feeding and feedback mechanisms of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are not yet well known. For low-luminosity and obscured AGN, as well as late-type galaxies, determining the central black hole (BH) masses is challenging. Our goal with the GATOS sample is to study circum-nuclear regions and better estimate BH masses with more precision than scaling relations offer. Using ALMA's high spatial resolution, we resolve CO(3-2) emissions within ~100 pc around the supermassive black hole (SMBH) in seven GATOS galaxies to estimate their BH masses when sufficient gas is present. We study seven bright ($L_{AGN}(14-150\mathrm{keV}) \geq 10^{42}\mathrm{erg/s}$), nearby (<28 Mpc) galaxies from the GATOS core sample. For comparison, we searched the literature for previous BH mass estimates and made additional calculations using the \mbh~ - $\sigma$ relation and the fundamental plane of BH activity. We developed a supervised machine learning method to estimate BH masses from position-velocity diagrams or first-moment maps using ALMA CO(3-2) observations. Numerical simulations with a wide range of parameters created the training, validation, and test sets. Seven galaxies provided enough gas for BH mass estimations: NGC4388, NGC5506, NGC5643, NGC6300, NGC7314, NGC7465, and NGC~7582. Our BH masses, ranging from 6.39 to 7.18 log$(M_{BH}/M_\odot)$, align with previous estimates. Additionally, our machine learning method provides robust error estimations with confidence intervals and offers greater potential than scaling relations. This work is a first step toward an automated \mbh estimation method using machine learning.

 - **Abstract**
 The Virgo cluster is the closest richest nearby galaxy cluster. It is in the formation process, with a number of sub-clusters undergoing merging and interactions. Although a great laboratory to study galaxy evolution and cluster formation, its large apparent size and the severe dynamic range limitations due to the presence of the bright radio source Virgo A (M 87) reduced the ability of past wide-area radio surveys to image the region with high sensitivity and fidelity. In this paper we describe the "Virgo Cluster multi-Telescope Observations in Radio of Interacting galaxies and AGN" (ViCTORIA) project. The survey and its data reduction strategy are designed to mitigate the challenges of this field and deliver: images from 42 MHz to 1.7 GHz frequencies of the Virgo cluster, about 60 times deeper than existing data, in full polarisation, and including a blind HI survey that aims at mapping seven times more galaxies than previous experiments and without selection biases. Data have been collected with the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) and with MeerKAT in L-band, including polarisation and enough frequency resolution to conduct local HI studies. At the distance of Virgo, current radio instruments have the resolution to probe scales of ~500 pc and the sensitivity to study dwarf galaxies, the most fragile systems given their shallow gravitational potential wells, making Virgo a unique laboratory to study galaxy evolution and AGN feedback in a rich environment. In this work, we present some preliminary results, including high resolution images of the radio emission surrounding M 87, that show that the lobes are filled with filamentary structures. The combination of the presented radio surveys with state-of-the-art optical, UV, X-ray surveys will massively increase the scientific output from the studies of the Virgo cluster, making the ViCTORIA Project's legacy value outstanding.

 - **Abstract**
 The exponential growth of astronomical data from large-scale surveys has created both opportunities and challenges for the astrophysics community. This paper explores the possibilities offered by transfer learning techniques in addressing these challenges across various domains of astronomical research. We present a set of recent applications of transfer learning methods for astronomical tasks based on the usage of a pre-trained convolutional neural networks. The examples shortly discussed include the detection of candidate active galactic nuclei (AGN), the possibility of deriving physical parameters for galaxies directly from images, the identification of artifacts in time series images, and the detection of strong lensing candidates and outliers. We demonstrate how transfer learning enables efficient analysis of complex astronomical phenomena, particularly in scenarios where labeled data is scarce. This kind of method will be very helpful for upcoming large-scale surveys like the Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). By showcasing successful implementations and discussing methodological approaches, we highlight the versatility and effectiveness of such techniques.

 We present a timing study of the gamma and X-ray observations and analysis of a sample of bright gamma-ray bursts (GRBs; i.e. GRB 180720B, GRB 181222B, GRB 211211A and GRB 220910A), including the very bright and long GRB 211211A (a.k.a. kilonova candidate). They have been detected and observed by the Atmosphere-Space Interactions Monitor (ASIM) installed on the International Space Station (ISS) and the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) on-board the Fermi mission. The early (T-T0=s) and high-energy (0.3-20 MeV) ASIM High Energy Detector (HED) and (150 keV-30 GeV) Fermi (BGO) light curves show well-defined peaks with a low quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) frequency between 2.5-3.5 Hz that could be identified with the spin of the neutron star in the binary mergers (coinciding with the orbital frequency of the binary merger) originating these GRBs. These QPOs consist on the first detection of low-frequency QPOs (<10 Hz) detected in magnetars so far. We also detect a strong QPO at 21.8-22 Hz in GRB 181222B together with its (less significant) harmonics. The low-frequency QPO would correspond to the signal of the orbiting neutron star (NS) previous to the final coalescence giving rise to the gravitational-wave (GW) signal.

 - **Abstract**
 The magnetically arrested disks (MADs) have attracted much attention in recent years. The formation of MADs are usually attributed to the accumulation of a sufficient amount of dynamically significant poloidal magnetic flux. In this work, the magnetic flux transport within an advection dominated accretion flow and the formation of a MAD are investigated. The structure and dynamics of an inner MAD connected with an outer ADAF are derived by solving a set of differential equations with suitable boundary conditions. We find that an inner MAD disk is eventually formed at a region about several ten Schwarzschild radius outside the horizon. Due to the presence of strong large-scale magnetic field, the radial velocity of the accretion flow is significantly decreased. The angular velocity of the MAD region is highly subkeplerian with $\Omega \sim (0.4-0.5)\Omega_{\rm K}$ and the corresponding ratio of gas to magnetic pressure is about $\beta \lesssim 1$. Also, we find that MAD is unlikely to be formed through the inward flux advection process when the external magnetic field strength weak enough with $\beta_{\rm out}\gtrsim 100$ around $R_{\rm out}\sim 1000R_{\rm s}$. Based on the rough estimate, we find that the jet power of a black hole, with mass $M_{\rm BH}$ and spin $a_*$, surrounded by an ADAF with inner MAD region is about two order of magnitude larger than that of a black hole surrounded by a normal ADAF. This may account for the powerful jets observed in some Fanaroff Riley type I galaxies with a very low Eddington ratio.

 - **Abstract**
 X-ray polarimetry is a fine tool to probe the accretion geometry and physical processes operating in the proximity of compact objects, black holes and neutron stars. Recent discoveries made by the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer put our understanding of the accretion picture in question. The observed high levels of X-ray polarization in X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei are challenging to achieve within the conventional scenarios. In this work we investigate a possibility that a fraction (or even all) of the observed polarized signal arises from scattering in the equatorial accretion disk winds, the slow and extended outflows, which are often detected in these systems via spectroscopic means. We find that the wind scattering can reproduce the levels of polarization observed in these sources.

 - **Abstract**
 The CHaracterising ExOPlanet Satellite (CHEOPS) is a partnership between the European Space Agency and Switzerland with important contributions by 10 additional ESA member States. It is the first S-class mission in the ESA Science Programme. CHEOPS has been flying on a Sun-synchronous low Earth orbit since December 2019, collecting millions of short-exposure images in the visible domain to study exoplanet properties. A small yet increasing fraction of CHEOPS images show linear trails caused by resident space objects crossing the instrument field of view. To characterize the population of satellites and orbital debris observed by CHEOPS, all and every science images acquired over the past 3 years have been scanned with a Hough transform algorithm to identify the characteristic linear features that these objects cause on the images. Thousands of trails have been detected. This statistically significant sample shows interesting trends and features such as an increased occurrence rate over the past years as well as the fingerprint of the Starlink constellation. The cross-matching of individual trails with catalogued objects is underway as we aim to measure their distance at the time of observation and deduce the apparent magnitude of the detected objects. As space agencies and private companies are developing new space-based surveillance and tracking activities to catalogue and characterize the distribution of small debris, the CHEOPS experience is timely and relevant. With the first CHEOPS mission extension currently running until the end of 2026, and a possible second extension until the end of 2029, the longer time coverage will make our dataset even more valuable to the community, especially for characterizing objects with recurrent crossings.

 - **Abstract**
 Baryonic feedback uncertainty is a limiting systematic for next-generation weak gravitational lensing analyses. At the same time, high-resolution weak lensing maps are best analyzed at the field-level. Thus, robustly accounting for the baryonic effects in the projected matter density field is required. Ideally, constraints on feedback strength from astrophysical probes should be folded into the weak lensing field-level likelihood. We propose a macroscopic method based on an empirical correlation between feedback strength and an optimal transport cost. Since feedback is local re-distribution of matter, optimal transport is a promising concept. In this proof-of-concept, we de-baryonify projected mass around individual halos in the IllustrisTNG simulation. We choose the de-baryonified solution as the point of maximum likelihood on the hypersurface defined by fixed optimal transport cost around the observed full-physics halos. The likelihood is approximated through a normalizing flow trained on multiple gravity-only simulations. We find that the set of de-baryonified halos reproduces the correct convergence power spectrum suppression. There is considerable scatter when considering individual halos. We outline how the optimal transport de-baryonification concept can be generalized to full convergence maps.

 - **Abstract**
 The specific star-formation rate of star-forming `main sequence' galaxies significantly decreased since z~1.5, due to the decreasing molecular gas fraction and star formation efficiency. However, the radio-infrared (IR) correlation has not changed significantly since z~1.5. The theory of turbulent clumpy starforming gas disks together with the scaling relations of the interstellar medium describes the large and small-scale properties of galactic gas disks. Here we extend our previous work on infrared, multi-transition molecular line, and radio continuum emission of local and high-z starforming and starburst galaxies to local and z~0.5 luminous infrared galaxies. The model reproduces the IR luminosities, CO, HCN, and HCO+ line luminosities, and the CO spectral line energy distributions of these galaxies. We derive CO(1-0) and HCN(1-0) conversion factors for all galaxy samples. The relation between the star formation rate per unit area and H2 surface density cannot be fit simply for all redshifts. There is a tight correlation between the star formation efficiency and the product of the gas turbulent velocity dispersion and the angular velocity of the galaxies. Galaxies of lower stellar masses can in principle compensate their gas consumption via star formation by radial viscous gas accretion. The limiting stellar mass increases with redshift. Whereas the radio continuum emission is directly proportional to the density of cosmic ray (CR) electrons, the molecular line emission depends on the CR ionization rate via the gas chemistry. The normalization of the CR ionization rate found for the different galaxy samples is about a factor of three to five higher than the normalization for the Solar neighborhood. This means that the mean yield of low energy CR particles for a given star formation rate per unit area is about three to ten times higher in external galaxies than observed by Voyager I.
#### Central kpc of Andromeda. I. Dynamical modelling

 - **Abstract**
 The Andromeda galaxy (M31) is the most nearby giant spiral galaxy, an opportunity to study with high resolution dynamical phenomena occurring in nuclear disks and bulges, able to explain star formation quenching, and galaxy evolution through collisions and tides. Multi-wavelength data have revealed in the central kpc of M31 strong dynamical perturbations, with an off-centered tilted disk and ring, coinciding with a dearth of atomic and molecular gas. Our goal to understand the origin of these perturbations is to propose a dynamical model, reproducing the global features of the observations. We are reporting about integral field spectroscopy of the ionized gas with H$\alpha$ and [NII] obtained with SITELLE, the optical imaging Fourier transform spectrometer (IFTS) at the Canada France Hawaii telescope (CFHT). Using the fully sampled velocity field of ionized gas, together with the more patchy molecular gas velocity field, previously obtained with the CO lines at IRAM-30m telescope, and the dust photometry, we identify three dynamical components in the gas, the main disk, a tilted ring and a nuclear warped disk. A mass model of the central kpc is computed, essentially from the stellar nuclear disk and bulge, with small contributions of the main stellar and gaseous disk, and dark matter halo. The kinematics of the ionized and molecular gas is then computed in this potential, and the velocity field confronted to observations. The best fit helps to determine the physical parameters of the three identified gas components, size, morphology and geometrical orientation. The results are compatible with a recent head-on collision with a M-32 like galaxy, as previously proposed. The kinematical observations correspond to a dynamical re-orientation of the perturbed nuclear disk, through warps and tearing disk into ring, following the collision.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) have been objects of great interest for the past few decades due to their unusually high luminosities and spectral properties. A few of these sources exhibit super-Eddington luminosities assuming them to be centering around stellar mass objects, even in their hard state. It has been shown via numerical steady state calculations that ULXs in hard state can be interpreted as highly magnetised advective accretion sources around stellar mass black holes. We use general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) framework to simulate highly magnetised advective accretion flows around a black hole and show that such systems can indeed produce high luminosities like ULXs. We also verify that the magnetic fields required for such high emissions is around $10^7$ G, in accordance with previous numerical steady state calculations. We further present power profiles for zero angular momentum observer (ZAMO) frame. These profiles show interesting features which can be interpreted as effects of emission due to the Blandford-Znajek and Blandford-Payne mechanisms.
#### Magnetically arrested advective accretion flows and jets/outflows around stellar mass black holes: Explaining hard state ULXs with GRMHD simulations

 - **Abstract**
 An optically thin advective accretion disk is crucial for explaining the hard state of black hole sources. Using general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations, we investigate how a large-scale, strong magnetic field influences accretion and outflows/jets, depending on the field geometry, magnetic field strength, and the spin parameter of the black hole. We simulate a sub-Eddington, advective disk-outflow system in the presence of a strong magnetic field, which likely remains in the hard state. The model simulations based on HARMPI successfully explain ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs) in the hard state, typically observed with luminosities ranging from $10^{39}$ - $10^{40}$ ergs s$^{-1}$. Our simulations generally describe the bright, hard state of stellar-mass black hole sources without requiring a super-Eddington accretion rate. This work explores the characteristics of ULXs without invoking intermediate-mass black holes. The observed high luminosity is attributed to the energy stored in the strong magnetic fields, which can generate super-Eddington luminosity. The combined energy of the matter and magnetic field leads to such significant luminosity.
