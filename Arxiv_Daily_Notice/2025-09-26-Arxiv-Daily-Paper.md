 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents UNAGI, a novel spacecraft mission developed by Spartan Space Systems, a student engineering team at San Jose State University, aiming for the first controlled landing on Jupiter's volcanically active moon Io. Inspired by the Japanese freshwater eel's agility, UNAGI employs an electrodynamic tether system that interacts with Jupiter's magnetic field to generate Lorentz forces, enabling dynamic modulation of the spacecraft's velocity without the need for traditional propellant. This system allows the spacecraft to precisely match Io's orbital velocity, similar to a surfer riding a wave. By optimizing tether current and orientation, UNAGI transitions from an outer Jovian insertion orbit to an orbit around Io, achieving a controlled landing for on-surface science operations. The landing is strategically timed, leveraging the gravitational influence of Jupiter and its moons to decelerate descent and mitigate impact forces. UNAGI leverages technologies from missions like Juno, JUICE, and Europa Clipper to ensure reliable operation in the challenging Jovian environment. The mission follows a phased approach, including cruise, orbital insertion, tether deployment, Jovian orbital operations, and final descent, with extensive risk mitigation through simulations and experimental validation. The concept supports rideshare integration on future NASA or ESA missions or a dedicated launch, emphasizing cost effectiveness and adaptability. UNAGI carries a scientific payload including infrared spectrometers, magnetometers, seismometers, and chromatographs, designed to probe Io's interior dynamics, volcanic activity, tectonic deformation, and magnetospheric interactions. This mission aims to advance understanding of Io's geophysical processes and Jupiter system dynamics, setting a new standard for deep space exploration of extreme environments.

 - **Abstract**
 Radio signals propagating through inhomogeneous plasma media deviate from their original paths, producing frequency-dependent magnification effects. In this paper, after reviewing the classical plasma-lensing theory, we have found a fundamental contradiction: the classical model assumes that the distribution of lensing plasma medium is related to the frequency-independent image position; however, our analysis demonstrates that both the image position ($\theta(\nu)$) and dispersion measure (DM$(\nu)$) are inherently frequency-dependent when signals traverse a structured plasma medium. We have been able to resolve this paradox by developing a framework that explicitly incorporates frequency-dependent dispersion measures (DMs) following power-law relationships ($\rm DM\propto \nu^\gamma$). Our analysis shows that the signal magnification decreases systematically with decreasing frequency, offering a plausible explanation for the frequency-dependent peak flux densities observed in fast radio bursts (FRBs), particularly in the case of the repeating FRB 180814.J0422+73. Our results suggest these FRBs could originate from the magnetized compact star magnetospheres. By considering these plasma-lensing effects on the sub-pulses of an FRB across different frequencies, we have the ability to more accurately investigate the intrinsic properties of FRBs via precise measurements of radio signals.

 - **Abstract**
 We study star formation over 12 Gyr using pop-cosmos, a generative model trained on 26-band photometry of 420,000 COSMOS2020 galaxies (IRAC Ch.1 $<26$). The model learns distributions over 16 SPS parameters via score-based diffusion, matching observed colours and magnitudes. We compute the star formation rate density (SFRD) to $z=3.5$ by directly integrating individual galaxy SFRs. The SFRD peaks at $z=1.3\pm0.1$, with peak value $0.08\pm0.01$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-3}$. We classify star-forming (SF) and quiescent (Q) galaxies using specific SFR $<10^{-11}$ yr$^{-1}$, comparing with $NUVrJ$ colour selection. The sSFR criterion yields up to 20% smaller quiescent fractions across $0<z<3.5$, with $NUVrJ$-selected samples contaminated by galaxies with sSFR up to $10^{-9}$ yr$^{-1}$. Our sSFR-selected stellar mass function shows a negligible number density of low-mass ($<10^{9.5}$ M$_\odot$) Q galaxies at $z\sim1$, where colour-selection shows a prominent increase. Non-parametric star formation histories around the SFRD peak reveal distinct patterns: SF galaxies show gradually decreasing SFR correlations with lookback time ($r\sim1$ to $r\sim0$ over 13 Gyr), implying increasingly stochastic star formation toward early epochs. Q galaxies exhibit full correlation ($r>0.95$) during the most recent $\sim$300 Myr, then sharp decorrelation with earlier star-forming epochs, marking clear quenching transitions. Massive ($10<\log_{10}(M_*/$M$_{\odot})<11$) galaxies quench on a time-scale of $\sim1$ Gyr, with mass assembly concentrated in their first 3.5 Gyr. Finally, AGN activity (infrared luminosity) peaks as massive ($\sim10^{10.5}$ M$_\odot$) galaxies approach the transition between star-forming and quiescent states, declining sharply once quiescence is established. This provides evidence that AGN feedback operates in a critical regime during the $\sim1$ Gyr quenching transition.

 - **Abstract**
 Long period radio transients (LPTs) are periodic radio sources showing pulsed emission on timescales from minutes to hours. The underlying sources behind this emission are currently unclear. There are two leading candidates: neutron stars or white dwarfs. Neutron stars could emit at LPT timescales as magnetars, binaries, or precessing sources. White dwarfs on the other hand have only been observed to emit in radio as binary systems with companions that provide charged particles through their wind. A key distinction is that an optical counterpart is much more likely in the white dwarf scenario. GPM J1839-10 is an LPT with a radio period of 21 min for which the white dwarf scenario has been favoured, but no optical counterpart is confirmed. Using HiPERCAM, a high-speed multi-colour photometer that observes simultaneously in ugriz filters, we probe the existence of a white dwarf in GPM J1839-10. We do not directly detect a white dwarf, but cannot rule out its presence given the uncertain distance and reddening of GPM J1839-10. On the other hand, we find evidence in our data for periodic behaviour in harmonics of the radio period, as expected from the white dwarf scenario.
#### SAGAbg III: Environmental Stellar Mass Functions, Self-Quenching, and the Stellar-to-Halo Mass Relation in the Dwarf Galaxy Regime

 - **Abstract**
 Recent efforts have extended our view of the number and properties of satellite galaxies beyond the Local Group firmly down to $\rm M_\star\sim 10^6 M_\odot$. A similarly complete view of the field dwarf population has lagged behind. Using the background galaxies sample from the Satellites Around Galactic Analogs (SAGA) Survey at $z<0.05$, we take inventory of the dwarf population down to $\rm M_\star \sim 5\times10^6 M_\odot$ using three metrics: the stellar mass function (SMF) as function of environment, the stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) of dwarf galaxies inferred via abundance matching, and the quenched fraction of highly isolated dwarfs. We find that the low-mass SMF shape shows minimal environmental dependence, with the field dwarf SMF described by a low-mass power-law index of $\alpha_1=-1.44\pm0.09$ down to $\rm M_\star \sim 5\times10^6 M_\odot$, and that the quenched fraction of isolated dwarfs drops monotonically to $f_{q} \sim 10^{-3}$ at $\rm M_\star \sim \rm 10^{8.5} M_\odot$. Though slightly steeper than estimates from \HI{} kinematic measures, our inferred SHMR agrees with literature measurements of satellite systems, consistent with minimal environmental dependence of the SHMR in the probed mass range. Finally, although most contemporary cosmological simulations against which we compare accurately predict the \sagalocal{} SHMR, we find that big-box cosmological simulations largely over-predict isolated galaxy quenched fractions via a turnaround in $f_q(\rm M_\star)$ at $\rm 10^8\lesssim M_\star/M_\odot\lesssim 10^9$, underscoring the complexities in disentangling the drivers of galaxy formation and the need for systematic multidimensional observations of the dwarf population across environments.

 - **Abstract**
 We present measurements of stellar population properties of a newly discovered spectroscopically confirmed $z=11.10^{+0.11}_{-0.26}$, gravitationally lensed galaxy, using JWST NIRSpec PRISM spectroscopy and NIRCam imaging. The arc is highly magnified by the Bullet Cluster (magnification factor ${\mu}=14.0^{+6.2}_{-0.3}$. It contains three star-forming components of which one is barely resolved and two are unresolved, giving intrinsic sizes of $\lesssim 10pc$. The clumps also contain ~50% of the total stellar mass. The galaxy formed the majority of its stars ~150Myr ago (by z~14). The spectrum shows a pronounced damping wing, typical for galaxies deep in the reionisation era and indicating a neutral IGM at this line of sight. The intrinsic luminosity of the galaxy is $0.086^{+0.008}_{-0.030} L^*$ (with $L^*$ being the characteristic luminosity for this redshift), making it the lowest luminosity spectroscopically confirmed galaxy at $z>10$ discovered to date.

 - **Abstract**
 Accretion disks are ubiquitous in astrophysics, appearing in diverse environments from planet-forming systems to X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei. Traditionally, modeling their dynamics requires computationally intensive (magneto)hydrodynamic simulations. Recently, Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a promising alternative. This approach trains neural networks directly on physical laws without requiring data. We for the first time demonstrate PINNs for solving the two-dimensional, time-dependent hydrodynamics of non-self-gravitating accretion disks. Our models provide solutions at arbitrary times and locations within the training domain, and successfully reproduce key physical phenomena, including the excitation and propagation of spiral density waves and gap formation from disk-companion interactions. Notably, the boundary-free approach enabled by PINNs naturally eliminates the spurious wave reflections at disk edges, which are challenging to suppress in numerical simulations. These results highlight how advanced machine learning techniques can enable physics-driven, data-free modeling of complex astrophysical systems, potentially offering an alternative to traditional numerical simulations in the future.

 - **Abstract**
 JWST has revealed an abundance of supermassive black holes (BHs) in the early Universe, and yet the lowest mass seed black holes that gave rise to these populations remain elusive. Here we present a systematic search for broad-line Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) in some of the faintest high-$z$ galaxies surveyed yet by combining ultra-deep JWST/NIRSpec G395M spectroscopy with the strong lensing aid in Abell S1063. By employing the profile of the [OIII]$\lambda 5007$ emission lines as a template for narrow-line components and carefully cross-validating with mock observations, we identify a sample of ten broad-line AGNs at $4.5<z<7.0$ (eight secure, two tentative). The inferred BH masses from the broad H$\alpha$ line explore the intermediate BH mass regime down to $\sim 10^{5.5}\,M_\odot$. The stellar mass ($M_*$) is estimated with a galaxy+AGN composite model, and we find the BH to stellar mass ratio spans down to $M_{\rm BH}/M_*\lesssim 0.1\%$, unveiling populations on the empirical $M_{\rm BH}-M*$ relation observed in the local universe. We also derive the black hole mass function and investigate its low-mass end at this epoch. While we confirm the agreement of our results with previous studies at $M_{\rm BH}\gtrsim10^{6.5}M_{\odot}$, we find the mass range of $\sim 10^{5.5}\,M_\odot$ features an enhanced abundance with respect to the extrapolated best-fit Schechter function. Comparison with theoretical models suggests that a possible origin for this enhanced abundance is the direct-collapse BH formation, supporting the scenario that the direct collapse of massive gas clouds is a significant pathway for the earliest supermassive BHs.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the stability and possible fates of Little Red Dots, under the stellar-only interpretation of their observational features. This is performed by a combination of analyzing the relevant timescales in their stellar dynamics and also, the application of recent numerical results on the evolution of the densest stellar systems. We study different scenarios for the evolution of Little Red Dots and conclude that in a fair fraction of those systems, the formation of a massive black hole by runaway collisions seems unavoidable, in all the possibilities studied within the stellar-only interpretation. We conclude that Little Red Dots are the most favourable known places to find a recently formed massive black hole seed, or in the process of formation, most probably formed directly in the supermassive range
#### BlackTHUNDER: Shedding light on a dormant and extreme little red dot at z=8.50

 - **Abstract**
 Recent photometric surveys with JWST have revealed a significant population of mysterious objects with red colours, compact morphologies, frequent signs of active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity, and negligible X-ray emission. These 'Little Red Dots' (LRDs) have been explored through spectral and photometric studies, but their nature is still under debate. As part of the BlackTHUNDER survey, we have observed UNCOVER_20466, the second most distant LRD known (z=8.5), with the JWST/NIRSpec IFU. Previous JWST/NIRCam and JWST/NIRSpec MSA observations of this source revealed its LRD nature, as well as the presence of an AGN. Using our NIRSpec IFU data, we confirm that UNCOVER_20466 contains an overmassive black hole. However, our observed Balmer decrements imply negligible dust attenuation, resulting in a much lower Hbeta-based bolometric luminosity and Eddington luminosity (~10%) than previously found. Lyman-alpha emission is strongly detected, implying f_esc,Lya~30%. The extremely high [OIII]4363/Hgamma ratio is indicative of not only AGN photoionization and heating, but also extremely high densities (ne~10^7cm-3), suggesting that this black hole at such high redshift may be forming in an ultra-dense protogalaxy.
#### Separating Photospheric and Starspot Magnetic Fields in Pre-Main-Sequence Stars Using IGRINS Spectroscopy

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic fields in pre main sequence stars regulate angular momentum evolution, drive magnetic activity, and modify stellar structure, yet their surface distributions remain poorly constrained. Traditional single component Zeeman broadening analyses typically yield mean field strengths of 2-4 kG, sometimes exceeding the photospheric equipartition limit, and assume complete magnetic coverage. These assumptions conflict with evidence that strong fields are concentrated in cool starspots. Here we present the first systematic separation of photospheric and starspot magnetic field strengths in PMS stars, using high resolution R=45000 H and K band spectra from the Raw and Reduced IGRINS Archive. By modeling temperature and magnetic field strength simultaneously for a vetted sample of 33 Class II-III young stellar objects, we find median photospheric field strengths of 1.2 kG and median spot field strengths over two times stronger at 2.56 kG, resolving the apparent super equipartition tension and removing the need for a unity magnetic filling factor. Our results show that PMS surfaces are permeated by concentrated, kG strength spot fields covering 27-83% of the visible hemisphere. This two component framework offers a physically motivated means to reconcile spectroscopic and imaging based magnetic diagnostics and enables large scale magnetic population studies across young clusters and star forming regions.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new stellar dynamical measurement of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass in the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 4258, a critical benchmark for extragalactic mass measurements. We use archival JWST/NIRSpec IFU data (G235H/F170LP grating) to extract high-resolution two-dimensional stellar kinematics from the CO bandhead absorption features within the central $3'' \times 3''$. We extract the stellar kinematics after correcting for instrumental artifacts and separating the stellar light from the non-thermal AGN continuum. We employ Jeans Anisotropic Models (JAM) to fit the observed kinematics, exploring a grid of 12 models to systematically test the impact of different assumptions for the point-spread function, stellar mass-to-light ratio ($M/L$) profile, and orbital anisotropy. All 12 models provide broadly acceptable fits, albeit with minor differences. The ensemble median and 68% (1$\sigma$) bootstrap confidence intervals of our 12 models yield a black hole mass of $M_{\rm BH} = (4.08^{+0.19}_{-0.33}) \times 10^7$ M$_\odot$. This paper showcases the utility of using the full model ensemble to robustly account for systematic uncertainties, rather than relying on formal errors from a single preferred model, as has been common practice. Our result is just 5% larger than, and consistent with, the benchmark SMBH mass derived from water maser dynamics, validating the use of NIRSpec stellar kinematics for robust SMBH mass determination. Our analysis demonstrates JWST's capability to resolve the SMBH's sphere of influence and deliver precise dynamical masses, even in the presence of significant AGN continuum emission.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed analysis of a 3D MHD simulation of a subset of the magnetic flux in an active region. The simulation models the generation of nanoflares and response of the plasma to imposed photospheric motions. Our study focuses on characterizing the energy distribution and occurrence frequency of the nanoflares in the simulation that self-consistently heat the corona. This field line based analysis reveals that the nanoflare energy distribution (energy per unit cross sectional area) follows a log-normal profile, where low energy nanoflares are significantly more prevalent than those with high energy. When compared with the plasma cooling time, different energy nanoflares tend to repeat with different frequencies. Low energy nanoflares repeat at high frequencies, while high energy nanoflares repeat at low frequencies. However, the thermal evolution of plasma along individual field lines is governed predominantly by the high energy nanoflares. These findings provide critical insights into the role of small-scale magnetic reconnection events in heating the solar corona.

 - **Abstract**
 Contamination-free assessments of the interstellar medium and star formation in quasar host galaxies, particularly based on the far-infrared, offer insights into the role of supermassive black holes in galaxy evolution. Motivated by predictions of quasar heating of dust on both nuclear and galaxy-wide scales, we perform two-component (host galaxy + point source) modeling of high-resolution (~0.1") ALMA observations of the FIR continuum in Band 5 (lambda_rest~500 um) of three highly luminous quasars (L_bol~10^47 erg/s), powered by supermassive black holes having M_BH~10^9 M_sun, at z=2. We include Band 9 (lambda_rest~154 um; 0.06" and 0.3") data at high S/N which places further constraints on the unresolved nuclear component in two cases. To break the degeneracy between quasar and stellar heating, we use CO (J=5-4), observed in Band 5, to gauge the expected contribution of star formation to the infrared luminosity. We find very good agreement between the strength and spatial distribution of the extended continuum component and its prediction based on CO (J=5-4). This is supported by the location of our three quasars along the L_(CO 5-4)-L_(IR, SFR) luminosity relation for inactive star-forming galaxies. As a consequence, there is no evidence for additional continuum emission on extended scales which could be attributed to quasar-heated dust. As expected, the nuclear (i.e., torus) contribution is present and subdominant (12% in Band 9 for one quasar with a typical star-forming host) or non-existent (<8% in Band 9 for the starbursting host). Based on the continuum and CO, the presence of substantial levels of ongoing star formation agrees with previous estimates from unresolved ALMA continuum observations which finds SFRs consistent with star-forming main-sequence galaxies. Therefore, our results do not provide evidence for a quasar-mode feedback, even for the most luminous cases at z=2.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive stars regulate galaxy evolution and star formation through their powerful physical and chemical feedback, but their formation remains poorly understood. Accretion powered outflows can provide important diagnostics of massive star formation. We present first results from the SOMA Atomic Outflow Survey, a far-infrared massive star formation survey using the FIFI-LS spectrometer on SOFIA. We report detection of [OIII] $^3P_2\rightarrow^3P_1$ emission at 52 $\mu$m from the massive protostar G11.94-0.62, tracing highly ionized gas. We also detect [OI] $^3P_2\rightarrow^3P_1$ and $^3P_1\rightarrow^3P_0$ at 63 and 145 $\mu$m tracing atomic gas, as well as CO $J=14\rightarrow13$ at 186 $\mu$m from highly excited molecular gas. The [OIII] and [OI] lines exhibit large line widths ($\sim400$ and $\sim40-80$ km s$^{-1}$, respectively) and their morphologies are consistent with a wide-angle bipolar outflow. Molecular tracers ($^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, C$^{18}$O, H$_2$CO, and CH$_3$OH) observed with ALMA also suggest a self-consistent outflow morphology. Ionized nebula/PDR modeling imply an ionized outflow mass flux of $\sim8\times10^{-5}\:M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ and an atomic outflow mass flux of $\sim5\times10^{-6}\:M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, while the molecular outflow traced by CO has an implied mass flux of $\sim3\times10^{-4}\:M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. The mass and momentum flux in the ionized outflow is consistent with the main component of the primary disk wind, while the molecular component is mainly swept-up, secondary outflow gas. We also observe G11.94-0.62 with the LBT in the near-infrared, potentially tracing the base of wide-angle outflow cavities. SED modeling implies $m_\star = 22.4^{+21}_{-11}\:M_\odot$, while the [OIII] emission implies $m_*\gtrsim30\:M_\odot$ and that the protostar is in the final stages of its accretion.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the capabilities of time-dependent (TD) magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) solar wind simulations with the coupled WSA model of the solar corona and GAMERA model of the inner heliosphere. We compare TD with steady state (SS) simulations and with in situ data from multiple spacecraft (Earth, STEREO-A, PSP). We show that TD predictions, although better than SS predictions, substantially mispredict the solar wind at different heliospheric locations. We identified three reasons for that: (1) the uncalibrated WSA velocity formula used to generate solar wind velocities at the inner boundary of a heliospheric domain, (2) the extraction of the WSA boundary conditions for input into MHD models very high in the corona, and (3) the abrupt and partial emergence of active regions from the solar east limb. Evaluation of one year of TD predictions at Earth and STEREO-A locations shows that by tuning accordingly the WSA relationship when used with MHD models, and by extracting the WSA boundary conditions lower in the corona (at 5 Rs instead of 21.5 Rs), can lead to improved predictions. However, the abrupt emergence of active regions from the east limb of the Sun which can highly disrupt the magnetic field topology in the corona, is a difficult task to deal with since complete knowledge of the conditions on the solar far side is not currently available. Solar Orbiter Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager (PHI) data can help mitigate this effect, however, unless we get a 4pi view of the Sun we will be unable to completely address it.

 - **Abstract**
 Axion-like particles (ALPs), hypothetical pseudoscalar particles that couple to photons, are among the most actively investigated candidates for new physics beyond the Standard Model. Their interaction with gamma rays in the presence of astrophysical magnetic fields can leave characteristic, energy-dependent modulations in observed spectra. Capturing such subtle features requires precise statistical inference, but standard likelihood-based methods often fall short when faced with complex models, large number of nuisance parameters and limited analytical tractability. In this work, we investigate the application of simulation-based inference (SBI), specifically Truncated Marginal Neural Ratio Estimation (TMNRE), to constrain ALP parameters using simulated observations from the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO). We model the gamma-ray emission from the active galactic nucleus NGC 1275, accounting for photon-ALP mixing, extragalactic background light (EBL) absorption, and the full CTAO instrument response. Leveraging the Swyft framework, we infer posteriors for the ALP mass and coupling strength and demonstrate its potential to extract meaningful constraints on ALPs from future real gamma-ray data with CTAO.

 - **Abstract**
 Fluctuations in the Sun's photospheric magnetic field are the primary source of the turbulence that can heat and accelerate the solar atmosphere, and thus play an important role in the production and evolution of the solar wind that permeates the heliosphere. A key parameter that characterizes this turbulence is the correlation scale of fluctuations, which determines the injection of turbulent energy into the plasma and influences the diffusive transport of solar energetic particles. This study employs magnetogram data acquired by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory to characterize an ensemble of spatial autocorrelation functions (ACFs) of magnetic fluctuations in the photosphere. It is shown that the two-point ACFs satisfy the similarity-decay hypothesis of von Kármán and Howarth, a fundamental property of turbulent systems: following a rescaling of the ACFs by energy and correlation lengths, a quasi-universal functional form is obtained demonstrating exponential decay of correlations. The probability distribution function of transverse correlation lengths (\(\lambda\)) is shown to be approximately log-normal. A mosaic of the spatial distribution of \(\lambda\) over the photosphere is presented; the ``quiet Sun'' tends to have \(\lambda\sim 1500\) km (albeit with a wide distribution), which is close to the scale of solar granulation; systematically longer lengths are associated with active regions. A positive correlation is observed between mean magnetic field magnitude and \(\lambda\), and empirical fits are derived to quantify this relationship. These results improve our understanding of the nature of turbulence in the solar photosphere and the origin of coronal and solar-wind turbulence, while providing observational constraints for models that describe the transport of turbulence from solar and stellar photospheres into their atmospheres.
#### The X-ray Emission of NGC 5005: An Unobscured Low-Luminosity AGN with a Weakly Accreting Broad-Line Region

 - **Abstract**
 We present deep Chandra X-ray observations of NGC 5005, a LINER-dominated galaxy previously reported to host a broad H$\alpha$ emission line. The diffuse soft X-ray emission ($<$3 keV) extends out to $\sim$800 pc, while harder emission ($>$3 keV) is confined to the central $\sim$400 pc. Spatially resolved spectroscopy of the nuclear ($r<150$ pc) and extended ($150<r<500$ pc) regions reveals that these are best described by models including both photoionized and thermal plasma components, consistent with excitation by a low-luminosity AGN and shock-heated gas. Narrow-band imaging and excitation maps from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) support this interpretation, closely matching the X-ray morphology and ionization structure. The detection of a faint hard X-ray nuclear source with Chandra, combined with stringent upper limits from NuSTAR and Swift, and consistency with the X-ray luminosity predicted from the HST [O III]$\lambda$5007 emission, indicates that NGC 5005 hosts an intrinsically low-luminosity ($L_{\rm bol} \sim 10^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$), unobscured AGN. Despite the extremely low Eddington ratio inferred from our measurements ($\lambda_{\rm Edd} \sim 5 \times 10^{-6}$), the presence of a broad H$\alpha$ line in the optical spectrum suggests the persistence of a thin accretion disk, challenging standard paradigms of accretion flow configurations at such low accretion rates.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a physically interpretable framework to quantify dynamical disturbances in galaxy clusters using projected two-dimensional phase-space information. Based on the TNG-Cluster simulation, we construct a disturbance score that captures merger-driven asymmetries through features such as velocity dispersion and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) peak fitting, which captures asymmetries indicative of dynamical disturbance. All features are derived from observable quantities and are intended to be measurable in future surveys. To enable observational application, we adopt a simplified estimator using aperture mass map statistics as a mass ratio proxy in TNG300-1, and validate its performance with weak lensing data from The Local Volume Complete Cluster Survey (LoVoCCS). While phase-space diagnostics reveal merger-driven asymmetries, they are not sensitive to whether the secondary progenitor is infalling or receding, and thus cannot distinguish future mergers from past mergers. To address this, we incorporate the star formation rate (SFR) from TNG-Cluster and propose the blue galaxy fraction as a promising observational tracer of merger timing. Finally, we construct mock Chandra X-ray images of TNG-Cluster halos at redshift $z=0.2$, and find that the offset between the X-ray peak and the position of the most massive black hole (used as a proxy for the Brightest Cluster Galaxy, BCG) correlates with our disturbance score, serving as a consistency check. We also perform case studies using LoVoCCS observational data, correlating the blue galaxy fraction with disturbance scores derived from the eROSITA morphology catalog.

 - **Abstract**
 Collisionless dissipation of turbulence is important for heating plasmas in astrophysical, space physics, and laboratory environments, controlling energy, momentum and particle transport. We analyze Parker Solar Probe observations to understand the collisionless heating of the sub-Alfvénic solar wind, which is connected to the solar corona. Our results show that linear resonant heating through parallel-propagating cyclotron waves cannot account for turbulent dissipation in sub-Alfvénic region, which observations suggest may dissipate turbulence at distances further from the Sun. Instead, we find that stochastic heating can account for the observed ion energization; however, because the dominant contributions arise from infrequent, large-amplitude events, turbulent intermittency must be explicitly incorporated. These observations directly connect stochastic heating via breaking of the proton magnetic moment with the intermittent and inhomogeneous heating of turbulence reported in many previous studies. Our identification of stochastic heating as a dynamic mechanism responsible for intermittent heating of the solar wind has significant implications for turbulent dissipation in the lower corona, other astrophysical environments, and laboratory plasma.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy mergers funnel gas toward the nuclei, igniting starbursts and active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The AGN feedback can reshape the host galaxy and regulate both star formation and super-massive black-hole (SMBH) accretion. Using VLT/MUSE integral-field spectroscopy, we conduct a spatially resolved study of the triple-AGN candidate SDSS J0849+1114. Extended ionized gas structures ($>10$ kpc from nucleus A) primarily associated with tidal tails are detected. Meanwhile, two distinct ionized gas outflows are revealed. One extends over $>5$ kpc around nuclei A with a kinetic power of $\dot{E}_{\rm out,A} = 3.0\times10^{42}\rm\, erg\, s^{-1}$, which might be driven by the radio jet. The other outflow extends $\sim 5.9$ kpc around nucleus C, with a kinetic power of $\dot{E}_{\rm out,C} = 2.0\times10^{40}\rm\, erg\, s^{-1}$. High [O III]/H$\alpha$ and [N II]/H$\alpha$ ratios in the tidal gas require that nucleus A radiated at a high accretion rate with $L_{\rm A,bol} \sim 0.1$--$0.5\,L_{\rm Edd,A}$ at least $\sim3$--$\times10^{4}\rm\,yr$ ago, $20$--$100$ times brighter than today. Combined with multi-wavelength constraints, we find evidence for episodic AGN feedback that expelled circumnuclear gas and rapidly quenched accretion. This triple AGN candidate demonstrates how AGN feedback can self-regulate black hole growth and impact hosts during mergers.

 - **Abstract**
 The search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) is largely limited by the vastness of the signaling parameter space. The concurrent signaling scheme offers a framework in which civilizations can coordinate their transmission and reception by referring to a common astrophysical event. Building on this idea, I propose a hybrid strategy that combines the Galactic Center as a spatial reference with an extragalactic burst as a temporal marker. If such a scheme is indeed employed, the sky area to be surveyed in SETI could be reduced by more than two orders of magnitude, based solely on existing astronomical data. I examine records of three types of extragalactic bursts (supernovae, neutron star mergers, and gamma-ray bursts [GRBs]) to identify suitable temporal markers. Among them, GRB 221009A is particularly notable due to its high fluence and favorable sky location.

 - **Abstract**
 Generally, merger likelihood increases in denser environments; however, the large relative velocities at the centres of dense clusters are expected to reduce the likelihood of mergers for satellite galaxies. Tidal features probe the recent merger histories of galaxies. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will produce an unprecedented sample of tidal features around millions of galaxies. We use LSST-like mock observations of galaxies at $z\sim0$ from the EAGLE, IllustrisTNG and Magneticum Pathfinder cosmological-hydrodynamical simulations to predict the occurrence rates of tidal features around satellite galaxies across group and cluster environments in the velocity-radius projected phase-space diagram to investigate the impact of these environments on tidal feature occurrence. We find that ancient infallers in the projected phase-space exhibit a decreasing tidal feature fraction with increasing halo mass, whereas recent infallers in the projected phase-space show unchanging tidal feature fractions with halo mass. Our results show, for the first time in cosmological simulations, a suppression of tidal feature fractions in the central regions of galaxy clusters, indicating a reduced merger rate due to higher cluster-centric velocities and lower galaxy total masses in the cluster centres. Using a toy model, we show that the presence of more tidal features in the recent infaller zone and cluster outskirts suggests that tidal features occur in interactions within infalling groups and dissipate by the time they are ancient infallers, indicating a $\lesssim3\pm2$ Gyr survival time of tidal features within clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 We discover an extended distribution of main-sequence (MS) stars along the minor axis of the Ursa Minor (UMi) dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dSph). This study is enabled by deep, wide Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam data, reaching photometric uncertainties below 0.1 mag at $g,i \sim 26$ mag. Color-magnitude diagrams along the major and minor axes reveal a clear excess of MS stars beyond the nominal tidal radius along the minor axis. To characterize this structure, we derive radial number density profiles in seven azimuthal directions and fit them with an exponential+power-law function to assess the symmetry of the extended component. The power-law slopes tend to be shallower toward the minor axis, though the symmetry remains inconclusive within 1$\sigma$ uncertainties. This may indicate that the extended component is preferentially distributed along the minor axis, and could be different from the previously suggested tidal features along the major axis. Comparing with simulations, we find that the fraction of stars beyond five effective radii is consistent with expectations from an intermediate mass ratio merger scenario with a stellar mass ratio around 6:1. While these findings provide new insights into the structural complexity and dynamical history of the UMi dSph, alternative mechanisms such as stellar or supernova feedback have also been proposed for extended stellar halos in dwarfs and cannot be ruled out.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic rays reaching the atmosphere of an astrophysical object produce showers of secondary particles that may then scape into space. Here we obtain the flux of gammas and neutrinos of energy $E>10$ GeV emited by the Sun, Jupiter and Earth. We show that, while the solar magnetic field induces an albedo flux of gammas from all the points in the Sun's surface, the dipolar magnetic field in the planets implies gammas only from the very peripheral region. Neutrinos, in contrast, can cross these objects and emerge from any point in their surface. The emission from these astrophysical objects is above the diffuse flux from cosmic ray interactions with the interstellar medium and has a distinct spectrum and gamma to neutrino ratio.

 - **Abstract**
 X-ray pulsars (XRPs) consist of a magnetized neutron star (NS) and an optical donor star. The NS accretes matter from the donor star producing pulsed X-ray emission. In most cases the donor stars are Be stars, and accretion is episodic, that is, the NSs are generally X-ray dim, but occasionally experience outbursts. Here, we carry out a statistical study with the X-ray monitoring data, and obtain strong correlations between the spin periods of the NSs and the outburst parameters for the first time. We show that XRPs containing faster rotating NSs tend to display more violent eruptions. In addition, pulsating ultraluminous X-ray sources in nearby galaxies follow the similar relationship. We demonstrate that most of these systems are close to the spin equilibrium, and that brighter pulsars have acquired more angular momentum by accreting matter from their companion stars, resulting in faster rotating NSs.

 - **Abstract**
 The inverse cascade in MHD turbulence plays a crucial role in various astrophysical processes such as galaxy cluster formation, solar and stellar dynamo mechanisms, and the evolution of primordial magnetic fields in the early universe. A standard numerical approach involves injecting magnetic helicity at intermediate length scales to generate a secondary, time-dependent spectral peak that gradually propagates toward larger scales. Previous simulations have already suggested a resistive dependence of inverse transfer rates and demonstrated the significant influence of magnetic helicity flux density $\epsilon_\mathrm{H}$ on this process. On dimensional grounds, we have $E_\mathrm{M}(k,t)=C_\mathrm{H} \epsilon_\mathrm{H}^{2/3} k^{-1}$ where $C_\mathrm{H}$ represents a potentially universal dimensionless coefficient analogous to the Kolmogorov constant. We present a summary of the 25 distinct simulations conducted with the \textsc{Pencil Code}, systematically varying the forcing wavenumber $k_\mathrm{f}$, magnetic Prandtl number $Pm$, grid resolution $N^3$, and Lundquist number $Lu$. We obtained $C_\mathrm{H}$ and corresponding error bars by calculating the compensated spectrum and investigated its dependence with $Lu$ and $k_\mathrm{f}$. For the $C_\mathrm{H}$ - $Lu$ relationship, we observe strong correlations with power-law exponents of 1 and 2/3. In contrast, we find no significant correlation between $C_\mathrm{H}$ and $k_\mathrm{f}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Relativistic jets generated in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) produce luminous transient events, yet the fundamentals of jet composition and radiation mechanisms remain unclear. One means of identifying a magnetically-dominated outflow would be detection of prompt, coherent radio emission at low frequencies, and we are able to search for this using the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) coupled with modelling of high energy pulses detected by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory (Swift). We present the rapid response mode follow-up LOFAR observations of four long GRBs, each beginning within a few hundred seconds of the initial Swift-BAT trigger. We interpreted our findings under the framework of a magnetic wind model, predicting coherent radio emission analogous to prompt emission pulses. Using 60 second and 180 second time sliced imaging at 120-168 MHz, we obtain upper limits on radio pulse emission, finding no significant signals. In the case of GRB 200925B, we observed a small increase of radio flux seen at $\sim$60-360 s post burst. In this model, this could represent the radio emission related to the Swift-BAT pulses, for a redshift of $z=1.8$, however, with a low signal-to-noise ratio of $\sim 2$, it is not deemed significant enough to confirm coincident prompt radio and gamma-ray emission. Instead, we can constrain the $\epsilon_{B}$ parameter, deriving upper limits of $\epsilon_{B} < 4.2 \times 10^{-4}$ for GRB 200925B. In GRB 240414A, with a reported redshift of $z=1.833$, we constrain $\epsilon_{B} < 2.8 \times 10^{-4}$. We discuss these results in the context of our whole LOFAR rapid response sample of six long gamma-ray bursts, finding our $\epsilon_{B}$ values are generally consistent with previous GRB studies.

 - **Abstract**
 The low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) GX 1+4 stands out with its unique properties. Despite being an old system, it hosts a strongly magnetized neutron star (NS), a trait usually linked to younger systems. Its exceptionally long orbital period (1160 days) and low eccentricity (0.101) imply that the NS formed with minimal mass loss and a weak natal kick. These features collectively point towards the NS having formed through the accretion induced collapse (AIC) of a white dwarf (WD). However, GX 1+4's unusually high peculiar velocity (~ 189.36 km/s) defies standard AIC explanations. To address this discrepancy, we propose a two-stage kick scenario within the AIC framework: an initial natal kick followed by a delayed electromagnetic "rocket effect" kick. Our Monte Carlo simulations indicate that while the natal kick (< 100 km/s) can generate a wide range of orbital eccentricities, the subsequent rocket kick (~ 240-480 km/s) explains both the high systemic velocity and low eccentricity. This two-stage kick mechanism naturally reproduces the observed characteristics of GX 1+4, provided that the NS's initially buried magnetic field re-emerges after the acceleration process ends. Our study represents the first attempt to quantitatively constrain the kick velocities in GX 1+4 and underscores the importance of possible rocket kicks in forming such peculiar LMXB systems.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper is the second in a series presenting \textsc{RadioSED}, a Bayesian inference framework for constructing, modelling and classifying radio spectral energy distributions from publicly-available surveys. We focus here on the application of our framework to SDSS Stripe 82. Not only do we recover all eleven previously-published peaked spectrum sources from the literature within this region, but we increase the number of known peaked spectrum sources here by more than an order of magnitude. We investigate the variability properties of our peaked spectrum sample, and find that overall they exhibit a low degree of variability, consistent with previous samples of peaked spectrum active galactic nuclei. The multiwavelength properties of these sources reveal that we have selected a population comprising largely distant ($z \geq 1$), powerful active galaxies. We find that the most compact jets are located preferentially in quasar-type hosts, with galaxy-type hosts home to slightly more extended radio structures. We discuss these findings in the context of current and forthcoming large area radio surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 Early results from JWST uncover a peculiar class of objects referred to as ``little red dots'' (LRDs). The extremely compact morphology of LRDs is often invoked to point towards an AGN-dominated picture in the context of their conflicting multiwavelength properties. In this work, we assess the capability of pysersic and GALFIT -- commonly used tools in LRD morphological studies -- to recover input parameters for a simulated suite of LRD-like objects in the F444W band. We find that: 1) these tools have difficulty recovering input parameters for simulated images with SNR $\lesssim 25$; 2) estimated PSF fraction could be a more robust physically-motivated description of LRD compactness; and 3) almost all permutations of modeled LRDs with SNR $\lesssim 50$ cannot be differentiated from a point source, regardless of intrinsic extent. This has serious implications on how we interpret morphological results for increasingly large photometric samples of LRDs, especially at extremely high-$z$ or in relatively shallow fields. We present results of Sersic and two-component fitting to a sample of observed LRDs to compare with our mock sample fitting. We find that $\sim85\%$ of observed LRDs are PSF-dominated, consistent with the AGN-dominated interpretation. The remaining $\sim15\%$ have low estimated PSF fractions (two-component fit) and sizes $\gtrsim 150$ pc (Sersic). This morphological diversity of LRDs suggests that that the population likely is not homogeneous. It possibly has a primary subset of sources consistent with the AGN-dominated hypothesis, and a secondary population of sources more consistent with arising perhaps from extremely compact starbursts.
#### Modelling the effect of stellar metallicity on the XUV evolution of low-mass stars and its impact on exoplanet atmospheres/habitability

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding how exoplanet atmospheres evolve is a key question in the context of habitability. One key process governing this evolution is atmospheric evaporation by stellar X-ray and EUV emission (collectively, XUV). As such, the evolution of exoplanet atmospheres is closely tied to the evolution of the host star's magnetic activity. Many studies have modelled the combined evolution of exoplanet atmospheres and their host stars. However, to date, the impact of the host star's metallicity on stellar activity/exoplanet atmosphere evolution has not been explored. In this work, we investigate how stellar metallicity affects the rotation and activity evolution of solar-like stars as well as the corresponding exoplanet atmospheric evolution. We reconfirm previous results that metal-rich stars spin down more rapidly than metal-poor stars. We also find that the XUV flux that an exoplanet in the habitable zone of its host star receives is larger when the host star is more metal-rich. As such, the atmospheres of exoplanets in the habitable zones of metal-rich stars are evaporated more rapidly than exoplanets in the habitable zones of metal-poor stars. Lastly, we find that the atmospheric evolution is most sensitive to the host star metallicity when the host star has a higher mass. In the highest mass solar-stars, the metallicity can have a larger influence on the atmospheric evolution than the initial rotation period of the star.

 Hydrodynamic simulations can connect outflow observables to the physical conditions of outflowing gas. Here, we use simulations of isolated disk galaxies ranging from dwarf mass ($M_{200} = 10^{10}\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) to Milky Way mass ($M_{200} = 10^{12}\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$), based on the FIRE-2 subgrid models to investigate multiphase galactic outflows. We use the CHIMES non-equilibrium chemistry module to create synthetic spectra of common outflow tracers ([CII]$_{158\rm{\mu m}}$, $\mathrm{CO}_{J(1-0)}$, H$\alpha$ and $[\mathrm{OIII}]_{5007\text{A}}$). Using our synthetic spectra we measure the mass outflow rate, kinetic power and momentum flux using observational techniques. In [CII]$_{158\rm{\mu m}}$ we measure outflow rates of $10^{-4}$ to $1$ $\mathrm{M_{\odot}yr^{-1}}$ across an SFR range of $10^{-3}$ to $1$ $\text{M}_{\odot}\text{yr}^{-1}$, which is in reasonable agreement with observations. The significant discrepancy is in $\mathrm{CO}_{J(1-0)}$, with the simulations lying $\approx1$ dex below the observational sample. We test observational assumptions used to derive outflow properties from synthetic spectra. We find the greatest uncertainty lies in measurements of electron density, as estimates using the SII doublet can overestimate the actual electron density by up to 2 dex, which changes mass outflow rates by up to 4 dex. We also find that molecular outflows are especially sensitive to the conversion factor between CO luminosity and H2 mass, with outflow rates changing by up to 4 dex in our least massive galaxy. Comparing the outflow properties derived from the synthetic spectra to those derived directly from the simulation, we find that [CII]$_{158\rm{\mu m}}$ probes outflows at greater distances from the disk, whilst we find that molecular gas does not survive at large distances within outflows within our modestly star-forming disk galaxies simulated in this work.

 - **Abstract**
 AT2018cqh is a unique optical tidal disruption event (TDE) discovered in a dwarf galaxy exhibiting delayed X-ray and radio flares. We present the results from high-resolution VLBA and e-MERLIN radio observations of AT2018cqh extending to $\delta$t $\sim$ 2250 days post discovery, which reveal a compact radio emission, unresolved at a scale of <~ 0.13 pc at 7.6 GHz, with a high brightness temperature of $T_b$ ~> 4.03 $\times$ 10$^{9}$ K. The radio spectral energy distribution (SED) is found to gradually shift towards a higher peak flux density and frequency over a period of $\sim$1000 days. An equipartition analysis suggests that there is a little change in the radio emitting region over this period, while the electron density increases by a factor of 3. The radio light curve at 0.89 GHz continues to rise, with a bump feature lasting for 240 days. These properties are in contrast to the predictions of standard shockwave model from a diffuse circumnuclear medium, but could be explained if dense clouds exist in the circumnuclear environment. The latter scenario is supported by our hydrodynamic simulations of the interaction of TDE outflow with a cloud, which can reproduce the temporal evolution in the radio SED. This work highlights the importance of the outflow-cloud interaction in explaining the delayed, fast-rising radio emission observed in some TDEs, especially those occurring in galaxies with pre-existing AGN activity.
