#### Tera-Hertz Counterparts to Fast Radio Bursts from Coherent Cherenkov Radiation by Tilted Bunches

 - **Abstract**
 Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration extragalactic transients characterized by ultrahigh brightness temperatures, suggesting coherent emission mechanisms in extreme astrophysical processes. In this paper, we extend the bunched coherent Cherenkov radiation (CChR) framework by incorporating bunch inclination and geometric configuration parameters, enabling it to more rigorously model FRB emission and tera-Hertz (THz) emission from magnetars. When relativistic bunches are injected into the magnetized plasma of a magnetar's magnetosphere at the Cherenkov angle, their emitted waves achieve phase coherence through constructive interference. Furthermore, the three-dimensional geometry of the bunches plays a crucial role in influencing the coherence of the radiation. Within the framework of CChR, we predict the existence of THz emission counterparts associated with FRBs and explain the observed characteristics of the THz-emitting magnetar SGR J1745-2900. Detections of such counterparts by upgraded millimeter telescopes (e.g., Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, IRAM) would be expected to provide new insights into the potential physical connection between FRBs and magnetars.

 - **Abstract**
 We develop a model for supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) accreting below their Eddington limit, focusing on systems where hot, advection-dominated flows become viable. We specifically explore the spectral appearance of multi-component accretion flows where the solution can independently transition between cold, thin disks and hot, advection-dominated torii depending on the local accretion rate. Using a three-disk model, we compute spectral energy distributions for four possible accretion configurations and assess their observational signatures, including which frequencies might reflect variability at the binary orbital period. The spectral modeling reveals that binary accretion can self-consistently account for many of the properties of standard AGN, while the variability analysis shows that hydrodynamic modulation at the binary period is most likely in the thermal emission and low-frequency synchrotron components. Doppler boosting of emitting material bound to a single binary component would also induce periodic variability. We apply our model to the SMBHB candidate PG1302-102 and demonstrate that a mixed-component accretion state (plus a jet feature) can self-consistently capture the observed broadband spectrum. Our model offers a framework for interpreting candidate SMBHBs and motivates future multi-wavelength follow-up of potential multi-messenger sources, as well as more detailed future modeling of multi-component binary accretion.

 - **Abstract**
 Exozodiacal dust disks (exozodis) are populations of warm (~300K) or hot (~1000K) dust, located in or interior to a star's habitable zone, detected around ~25% of main-sequence stars as excess emission over the stellar photosphere at mid- or near-infrared wavelengths. Often too plentiful to be explained by an in-situ planetesimal belt, exozodi dust is usually thought to be transported inwards from further out in the system. There is no consensus on which (if any) of various proposed dynamical models is correct, yet it is vital to understand exozodis given the risk they pose to direct imaging and characterisation of Earth-like planets. This article reviews current theoretical understanding of the origin and evolution of exozodi dust. It also identifies key questions pertinent to the potential for exozodis to impact exoplanet imaging and summarises current understanding of the answer to them informed by exozodi theory. These address how exozodi dust is delivered, its size and spatial distribution, and the effect of its composition on exozodi observability, as well as the connection between hot and warm exozodis. Also addressed are how common different exozodi levels are and how that level can be predicted from system properties, as well as the features that planets impart in dust distributions and how exozodis affect a planet's physical properties and habitability. We conclude that exozodis present both a problem and an opportunity, e.g., by introducing noise that makes planets harder to detect, but also identifying systems in which ingredients conducive to life, like water and volatiles, are delivered to the habitable zone.
#### Semi-analytic studies of accretion disk and magnetic field geometry in M87*

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Magnetic fields play a pivotal role in dynamics of black hole accretion flows and formation of relativistic jets. Observations by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) provided unprecedented insights into accretion structures near black holes. Interpreting these observations requires a theoretical framework linking polarized emission to underlying system properties and magnetic field geometries. Aims: We investigate how system properties, particularly magnetic field geometry in the event horizon scale region, influence the structure of the observable synchrotron emission in M87*. Specifically, we aim to quantify the sensitivity of observables used by the EHT to black hole spin, plasma dynamics, accretion disk thickness, and magnetic field geometry. Methods: We adopt a semi-analytic radiatively inefficient accretion flow model in Kerr spacetime. We vary magnetic field geometry, black hole spin, accretion disk dynamics, and geometric thickness of the disk. We perform general relativistic ray tracing with a full polarized radiative transfer to obtain synthetic images of M87*. We extract EHT observables, such as disk diameter, asymmetry, and polarimetric metrics from synthetic models. We also consider a number of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations and compare them with the semi-analytical models. Results: We see limited impact of the disk thickness on observables. On the other hand, toroidal field dominated and poloidal field dominated magnetic configurations can be distinguished reliably. The flow dynamics, in particular presence of radial inflow, also significantly impacts the EHT observables. Conclusions: The M87* system is most consistent with a poloidal magnetic field dominated flow with partially radial inflow. While the spin remain elusive, moderate or large positive values are preferred.
#### Serendipitous discovery of a young cluster of galaxies at $z \sim 0.5$ projected next to the nearby tadpole galaxy KUG 1138 + 327

 - **Abstract**
 Using a 90 ks Chandra ACIS-S observation in the 0.3--7 keV band, along with complementary Low-Frequency Array and Karl G.~Jansky Very Large Array data in the 120--168 MHz and 1--2 GHz ranges, we study the diffuse emission around the nearby dwarf galaxy KUG~1138+327. Our analysis reveals a diffuse X-ray feature on the southern side, disconnected from the galactic disk. This feature exhibits a hard X-ray spectrum, which is highly unusual for an outflow from a dwarf galaxy. We interpret the irregularly shaped feature as hot plasma in a young galaxy cluster at redshift 0.5, supported by X-ray spectral fitting and consistent with the optical redshift of the central elliptical galaxy of a known cluster identified by a red sequence. Additionally, we detect a radio lobe east of the X-ray feature, likely produced by an AGN offset from the cluster center and confined primarily by ram pressure from the ambient medium. The lobe shows a steep nonthermal radio spectrum, suggesting a cosmic-ray age of $\gtrsim 5 \times 10^{7}$~yr. Assuming energy equipartition between cosmic rays and magnetic fields, we estimate the lobe's total energy to be $\sim 9 \times 10^{56}~\mathrm{erg}$, comparable to the thermal energy in the same volume. This study thus identifies a background young cluster projected next to KUG~1138+327 and highlights the potentially significant role of off-center AGN feedback in shaping the intracluster medium.
#### Blue supergiants in the Pinwheel Galaxy M101: comparison with H II region chemical abundances, spectroscopic distance and an independent determination of the Hubble constant

 - **Abstract**
 We present a quantitative spectroscopic study of 13 blue supergiant stars in the Pinwheel Galaxy M101, based on data obtained with the Low Resolution Imaging Spectrometer available at the Keck I telescope. The average stellar metallicity decreases from ~1.9 Zsun near the center of the galaxy to ~0.3 Zsun at the optical outskirts. The galactocentric radial metallicity gradient is statistically consistent with previous studies of the gas-phase oxygen abundance from H II regions using the direct method. The H II region-based Cepheid metallicities used by Riess et al. in their determination of the Hubble constant H_0 are in substantial agreement with our measurements. The direct method gas-phase metallicities of the 18 star-forming galaxies we have analyzed so far, when adjusted upward for a mean ~0.15 dex oxygen dust depletion factor, are in good agreement with those we infer from the supergiants, over a factor of 50 in metallicity. From the same data, we derive an expression for the metal-dependent depletion of oxygen in photoionized nebulae. Utilizing the flux-weighted gravity - luminosity relationship (FGLR) of blue supergiants, we measure a distance to M101, D=6.5 +\- 0.2 Mpc (m-M = 29.06 +\- 0.08), which is within 1 sigma from determinations based on the tip of the red giant branch and Cepheids. With M101 as a nearby SN Ia host and using the observed standardized B-band magnitude of the supernova, our FGLR distance yields an independent value H_0 = 72.5 +\- 4.6 km/s/Mpc.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at high redshift ($z \ge 10$) from a combination of dark matter capture, black-hole mergers, and gas accretion. It has previously been shown that SMBHs can form by $z \approx 10$ via black-hole mergers, Eddington-limited Bondi gas accretion and tidal disruption events with stars within dense nuclear clusters. Here, we show that the capture of collisionless dark matter by a growing SMBH also substantially contributes, in some cases by an order of magnitude to the final SMBH mass. In particular, we show that a small seed stellar-remnant black hole can more easily reach $> 10^7$ M$_{\odot}$ by $z = 10$ in the core of dense nuclear star clusters when dark matter is included. This remains true for either cold dark matter or ultralight dark matter if the mass of the ULDM particle is $^>_\sim 10^{-20}$ eV. We highlight the unique evolution of ULDM capture by the growing SMBH when the ULDM de Broglie wavelength exceeds the initial nuclear star cluster half-mass radius.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a study of quasar host galaxy 3C 297 which is home to a powerful bent-jet radio source suggesting vigorous interaction with a dense ISM and/or jet precession. Archival HST imaging showed interestingly perturbed morphology of the host with a bright ~30 kpc arc feature, extended filamentary structure of line-emitting gas and clumpy blue excess emission co-spatial with the radio hotspots. Our VLT/SINFONI integral-field observations reveal complex, spatially-resolved H{\alpha}+[NII] emission in this source. A prominent blue-shifted wing in H{\alpha} indicates an ionized gas flow extending out to ~18 kpc from the nuclear region. Combining our SINFONI narrow-H{\alpha} data with archival HST/UV and VLA imaging, we map the young stellar population in the host and compare the spatial distribution of star-forming regions with the ionized gas motion and jet structure. In the attempt to characterize the feedback mechanisms in this chaotic system, we suggest that the powerful radio source dominates the feedback with possible contribution from radiation pressure due to AGN accretion. We also propose that the expanding jet cocoon likely shocked the ISM, triggering a kpc-scale ionized gas outflow and new starbursts that enhanced ongoing merger-induced star formation.
#### The origin of extreme N-emitters in star-forming galaxies at z$<$0.5 with DESI DR1

 - **Abstract**
 Extreme nitrogen enhancement relative to oxygen, recently found in very high-redshift galaxies, has been seen in local star-forming galaxies displaying high log(N/O) values ($\geq\!-1.1$) at relatively low O abundances, 12+log(O/H)$\leq$8. Understanding the physical origins of these extreme N-emitters at low redshifts enables us to better constrain chemical enrichment mechanisms that drove such high log(N/O) values in the early Universe. With direct N and O abundances derived for 944 SFGs with spectroscopic observational data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 1 (DESI DR1), we report the discovery of 19 extreme N-emitters at low-z (z$<$0.5). Our sample of N-emitters represents a five-fold increase in their known number at low-z with 12+log(O/H)$\leq$8, and statistically, $2.21\pm0.91$\% of DESI DR1 SFGs with reliable O and N abundances obtained directly, are extreme N-emitters. The sample spans a mass range of $\sim 10^7$ - $10^{10}$~M$_{\odot}$ with 12+log(O/H) range of $\sim$7.1 - 8.2, and the N-emitter fraction is found to increase with increasing stellar mass and decreasing metallicity. The most extreme N-emitter in our sample has log(N/O)=$-0.53\pm0.13$, while also having the lowest 12+log(O/H)=$7.08\pm0.09$ and the highest stellar mass, log(M$_{*}$/M$_{\odot}$)=$9.95\pm0.13$ among our sample. With galactic chemical evolution models, we show that sustained N-enhancement by asymptotic giant branch stars, in conjunction with presence of outflows, can well explain the high log(N/O) of low-z extreme N-emitters. While single starbursts with outflow are sufficient to explain lower-mass N-emitters, more massive ones require a dual starburst scenario where a secondary starburst is triggered by inflow of gas.
#### Examining AGN UV/Optical Variability Beyond the Simple Damped Random Walk. II. Insights from 22 Years Observations of SDSS, PS1 and ZTF

 - **Abstract**
 A damped random walk (DRW) process is often used to describe the temporal UV/optical continuum variability of active galactic nuclei (AGN). However, recent investigations have shown that this model fails to capture the full spectrum of AGN variability. In this work, we model the 22-year-long light curves of $21,767$ quasars, spanning the redshift range $0.28 < z < 2.71$, as a noise-driven damped harmonic oscillator (DHO) process. The light curves, in the optical $g$ and $r$ bands, are collected and combined from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System, and the Zwicky Transient Facility. A DHO process can be defined using four parameters, two for describing its long-term behavior/variability, and the other two for describing its short-term behavior/variability. We find that the best-fit DHO model describes the observed variability of our quasar light curves better than the best-fit DRW model. Furthermore, the best-fit DHO parameters exhibit correlations with the rest-frame wavelength, the Eddington ratio, and the black hole mass of our quasars. Based on the power spectral density shape of the best-fit DHOs and these correlations, we suggest that the observed long-term variability of our quasars can be best explained by accretion rate or thermal fluctuations originating from the accretion disk, and the observed short-term variability can be best explained by reprocessing of X-ray variability originating from the corona. The additional information revealed by DHO modeling emphasizes the need to go beyond DRW when analyzing AGN light curves delivered by next-generation wide-field time-domain surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 The association between FRB 20200428D and the Galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154 makes magnetars the leading engine of cosmological fast radio bursts (FRBs). However, there is a list of puzzles for this magnetar-for-all-FRBs scenario: known Galactic magnetars are all isolated and none of them are active repeaters; some cosmological repeaters have extremely high repetition rates but without any measurable spin-related periodicity; some show long-term periodic active windows; and some show diverse rotation measure (RM) evolution patterns, such as quasi-periodic fluctuations, sign reversals, and abrupt RM flares. Here we propose a unified theoretical framework for FRBs within the framework of magnetar engine: Most active repeating FRBs originate from magnetars in binary systems with nearly aligned rotation and magnetic axes, some of which with a triple-aligned geometry, i.e. with an alignment with the orbital axis as well; whereas apparent non-repeaters and inactive repeaters originate from magnetars in isolated systems or in binaries with a misaligned geometry. By studying various magnetar formation channels using population syntheses, we show that a few percent of magnetars in the universe can be in binary systems, most with a massive star companion and some with aligned geometry. We suggest that such binary systems can account for the rich phenomenology of active repeaters. We suggest that the existence of a companion helps to maintain the aligned geometry and that the companion may play an active role in triggering FRBs in an active repeater source.
#### Investigating the Kinematics of Molecular Gas in Cometary Globule L1616

 - **Abstract**
 LDN 1616 is a cometary globule located approximately 8 degrees west of the Orion OB1 associations. The massive OB stars in the Orion belt region act as catalysts, triggering the star formation activity observed in the L1616 region, which is a photodissociation region (PDR). This paper provides an in-depth analysis of gas kinematics within the L1616 PDR, leveraging the Heterodyne Array Receiver Program (HARP) on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) to observe 13CO and C18O (3-2) emissions. Employing the Clumpfind algorithm on the C18O emission data, we identify three distinct clumps within this PDR. For each of these clumps, we derive key physical parameters, including the mean kinetic temperature, optical depth, and velocity dispersion. In addition, we compute the non-thermal velocity dispersion and Mach number, providing critical insights into the turbulent dynamics of the gas. A comprehensive evaluation of mass, including virial and energy budget evaluations, is conducted to assess the gravitational stability and star-forming potential of the identified clumps. While previous studies have proposed that radiation-driven implosion (RDI) is the dominant mechanism initiating star formation in LDN 1616, our results suggest that the clumps may represent pre-existing substructures within the PDR. This interpretation is supported by our estimation of a relatively low interstellar radiation field, which, although insufficient to form clumps independently, may enhance gravitational instability through additional compression. Thus, our findings offer a more nuanced perspective on the role of RDI, highlighting its capacity to trigger star formation by amplifying the instability of pre-existing clumpy structures in PDRs like LDN 1616.
#### How the cosmic voids contribute to stalling and quenching the giant galaxies on their surfaces

 - **Abstract**
 We report a numerical discovery that the formations of cosmic voids are closely linked with the mechanism through which the giant galaxies on void surfaces establish elliptical shapes, redder colors, and lower sSFR. Identifying the voids from the TNG300-1 simulations via the Void-Finder algorithm, we explore if and how the shapes of the TNG galaxies located on void surfaces are aligned with the directions toward the void centers. Noting that only the giant void-surface galaxies with stellar masses $M_{\star}\ge 10^{10.5}\,h^{-1}\,M_{\odot}$ exhibit significant tendency of perpendicular alignments, we dichotomize them into two $M_{\star}$-controlled samples according to their morphologies (elliptical or spiral), colors (redder or bluer), sSFR (lower or higher) and stellar ages (older or younger). It is found that the void-galaxy perpendicular alignment becomes stronger for the cases that the void-surface galaxies have elliptical shapes, redder colors, and lower sSFR. The numerical results are also shown to be well described by the analytical one-parameter model derived under the assumption of the existence of a linear scaling between the covariance matrices of galaxy shape axes and local tidal tensors. Our result implies that the compression of adjacent matter due to the formation and rapid expansion of cosmic voids prevent them from radial infall/accretion, which in turn contribute to stalling and quenching the giant void-surface galaxies. Given that the formation epochs and expansion rates of cosmic voids depend sensitively on the dark energy equation of state, we also discuss a possibility of using the abundance of elliptical void-surface galaxies as a probe of dark energy.
#### Activity-Cycle Variations of Convection Scales in Subsurface Layers of the Sun

 - **Abstract**
 We use subsurface-flow velocity maps inferred by time--distance helioseismology from Doppler measurements with the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) of the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) to investigate variations of large-scale convection during Solar Cycles 24 and 25 in the 19-Mm-deep layer. The spatial power spectra of the horizontal-flow divergence reveal well-defined characteristic scales of solar supergranulation in the upper 4 Mm layer, while the giant-cell scale is prominent below levels of d ~ 8 Mm. We find that the characteristic scales of supergranulation remain stable while the giant scales increase during the periods of the 11-year activity cycle maxima. The power of the giant-cell scales increases with the enhancement of solar activity. This may be due to large-scale flows around active regions and, presumably, solar-cycle variations of the convection-zone stratification.
#### Type IIb Supernova Progenitors in 3D: Variability and Episodic Mass Loss revealed by Radiation-Hydrodynamics Simulations

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first 3D Radiation-Hydrodynamics simulations of partially-stripped ($M_\mathrm{core}\sim10M_\odot$, $M_\mathrm{env}\sim0.1-1M_\odot$) Yellow Supergiant ($L\sim10^5$, $T_\mathrm{eff}\approx5000-8000$K) envelopes, constructed with Athena++. These envelope models represent the progenitors of Type IIb supernovae (SNe-IIb), which have lost a substantial fraction of their H-rich envelope before undergoing core-collapse. The luminosity-to-mass ratio is high in these extended envelopes, and convection is strongly driven by Hydrogen and Helium opacity peaks. This surface convection, coupled with changes in the opacity, sustains large-amplitude low-azimuthal-order radial pulsations, creating order-of-magnitude variability in the stellar luminosity on a timescale of tens of days. If persistent prior to a SN-IIb, these variations could herald the upcoming explosion. Supersonic fluid motions across the outer layers of the star lead to both successful and failed mass ejection events, which shape the circumstellar environment and drive episodic mass loss ($\sim10^{-6}-10^{-5}M_\odot/$yr, in outbursts). The resulting 3D gas distribution in the outer atmosphere, responsible for early-time supernova shock-breakout and shock-cooling emission, shows orders-of-magnitude fluctuations in both space and time at any given radial location. This intrinsically complex halo of bound and unbound material complicates predictions for early SN-IIb lightcurves relative to spherically-symmetric models. However, it does provide a natural, self-consistent explanation for the presence and diversity of dense circumstellar material observed or inferred around pulsating evolved stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Crust quakes are frequently invoked as a mechanism to trigger sudden transients in the magnetospheres of magnetars. In this picture, a mechanical failure of the crust excites seismic motions of the magnetar surface that launch force-free waves into the magnetosphere. We first investigate this problem analytically and then perform three-dimensional numerical simulations. Our simulations follow the propagation of high-frequency magneto-elastic waves in the entire crust, and include magnetic coupling to the dipolar magnetosphere and liquid core through simplified radiation boundary conditions. We observe seismic waves bouncing between the crust-core interface and the surface with a characteristic frequency $\sim 1$ kHz, which could appear as a modulation of the magnetospheric radiation. Both the star quake and its associated magnetospheric wave emission are strongly damped on a timescale $\sim 10 \ \rm ms$ by magnetic coupling to the liquid core. Since seismic waves are significantly damped before they can spread laterally around the crust, magnetospheric wave emission occurs primarily near the initial epicenter of the quake. Our simulations suggest that non-axisymmetric quakes will launch a mixture of Alfvén and fast magnetosonic waves into the magnetosphere. The results will be important for interpreting magnetar bursts and understanding the possible trigger mechanisms of fast radio bursts.

 - **Abstract**
 The high-mass (M$>$2 \Msolar{}) Kepler red giant stars are less well-studied than their lower-mass counterparts. In the previous article, we presented a sample of 48 high-mass Kepler red giants and measured their asteroseismic parameters. This article presents spectroscopic measurements from the same sample, using high-resolution Keck/HIRES spectra to determine \Teff{}, [Fe/H], \logg{}, and $v \sin i$. We refined our previous estimates of the stellar masses and radii based on the new \Teff{}. We also examined spectral features that could indicate binary activity, such as the Li line and [C/N] ratios. We found no Li-rich stars or clear [C/N] anomalies, but we observed a correlation between [C/N] and [Fe/H]. We measured chromospheric activity using the $S$-index of the Ca II H \& K lines and found no correlation with internal magnetic fields. However, we confirmed an anti-correlation between surface chromospheric activity and radial mode oscillation amplitudes, which indicates that strong surface magnetic fields weaken stellar oscillations. Finally, we used the Gaia DR3 astrometric data to show that our sample of stars have orbits consistent with all three Galactic kinematic regions. Although these stars are quite young, their orbits carry them into the thick disk and even the halo, raising questions about the accuracy and viability of kinematics in unravelling Galactic history. In future work, we plan to use the spectroscopic parameters measured here to provide better constraints for boutique frequency modelling, which will allow us to test the asteroseismic scaling relations at the high-mass regime.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the second data release of the Systematic Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) Legacy Extragalactic Survey (SMILES), focusing on JWST/NIRSpec medium-resolution spectroscopy of galaxies across cosmic time. This release includes spectroscopic observations of 166 galaxies spanning $0 < z < 7.5$, sampling star-forming galaxies, quiescent systems, and active galactic nuclei (AGN), with an emphasis on galaxies at cosmic noon ($z \sim 1$-3). We describe the target selection strategy, the observational setup with the G140M/F100LP and G235M/F170LP gratings, and the data calibration process. The final data products include the reduced spectra, redshift catalog, emission-line catalogs produced with \texttt{GELATO} for emission-line galaxies and \texttt{pPXF} fits for quiescent systems, and ancillary spectral energy distribution (SED) fit results derived from multi-band photometry. The SMILES NIRSpec dataset enables investigations of obscured AGN, multi-phase outflows, ionizing properties, and the role of environment in galaxy evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 After carbon and oxygen, $^{22}$Ne is the most abundant element in white dwarf interiors. As C/O white dwarfs (WDs) crystallize, they are predicted to go through a distillation process in the central layers if they have a sufficiently high $^{22}$Ne mass fraction of $\gtrsim2.5$\%. Observational evidence for distillation comes from an over-density of WDs on the Q-branch in Gaia color-magnitude diagrams, which indicates that $\sim6$\% of massive WDs are delayed in their cooling by as much as $\sim10$ Gyr. However, it is unclear how these stars end up with such a high concentration of $^{22}$Ne and if a significant fraction of the more common average-mass WDs go through distillation. We argue that a significant metal-rich stellar population in the solar neighborhood should lead to distilled WDs, without requiring a binary merger. We use MESA along with the CNO abundances derived from high-resolution spectroscopy of stars included in the Hypatia catalog to predict the $^{22}$Ne mass fraction in their descendant WDs. We find that 0.6-2.5\% of the WDs in the solar neighborhood have sufficient $^{22}$Ne in their interiors to go through multi-Gyr cooling delays, which could significantly inflate their numbers in the observed samples. Hence, $^{22}$Ne distillation and long-lived habitable zones around WDs should be relatively common in the solar neighborhood. We also use a Galactic model to predict the fraction of WDs that go through distillation as a function of Galactocentric distance. The fraction of distilled WDs is $\sim2$-8\% near the Galactic center, and declines steadily toward the outer disk.

 - **Abstract**
 We present ALMA Total Power CO(1-0) mapping of Stephan's Quintet (SQ), a prototypical compact galaxy group, with a uniform noise level at a spatial scale of ~25 kpc. These observations provide the first complete view of molecular gas across the whole system. Molecular gas is found to spread over a wide area (~120 x 80 kpc), mainly over the two main member galaxies (NGC7318B and 7319), but also in the shocked ridges between these galaxies, the tidal tail, and also in intergalactic regions north of the tail. The total CO(1-0) luminosity is $(2.47\pm0.12)\times10^9~\mathrm{K~km~s^{-1}~pc^2}$, corresponding to a molecular gas mass of $(1.07\pm0.05)\times10^{10}~M_\odot$ assuming the Galactic CO-to-H2 conversion factor. The global star formation efficiency of SQ is estimated at 0.29-0.70 $\mathrm{Gyr^{-1}}$, comparable to or lower than that of nearby star-forming galaxies. Molecular gas spans a velocity range of ~1300 km/s, which can be divided into three components (low, mid, high). The low- and mid-velocity components, linked to NGC7318B and the ridge, show relatively active star formation, whereas the high-velocity component, associated with NGC7319, shows suppressed star formation. Our mapping reveals molecular gas extending ~100 kpc in projection along the inner tail and north of it, containing $(1.64\pm0.08)\times10^9~M_\odot$ (15% of total) with low velocity dispersion (~20 km/s) and ongoing star formation. While previous studies suggested in situ molecular gas formation in the tail, our data suggest an additional contribution from gas stripped from NGC7319.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive stars play a critical role in the evolution of galaxies, but their formation remains poorly understood. One challenge is accurate measurement of the physical properties of massive protostars, such as current stellar mass, envelope mass, outflow cavity properties, and system orientation. Spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting is widely-used to test models against observations. The far-infrared SED traces cold dust in envelopes, while the near- and mid-infrared (MIR) probes emission from outflow cavities and/or the inner envelope. However, SED fitting has degeneracy limiting its ability to yield accurate measurements of protostellar properties. Here, we develop image profile (IMPRO) fitting as a method to improve the characterization of protostars. We utilize brightness distributions from multi-wavelength MIR images of massive protostars taken by SOFIA/FORCAST as part of the SOFIA Massive Star Formation (SOMA) survey to constrain protostellar properties via comparison to a grid of radiative transfer models. We develop a fitting pipeline to extract information along the outflow axis, which is then combined with the SED fitting to yield improved constraints on protostellar properties. We apply the IMPRO fitting method on the nearby massive protostar Cepheus A, finding that its properties become more tightly constrained compared to SED fitting, especially in the inclination of the source. However, for the more distant G35.20-0.74N, we find that the spatial resolution of SOFIA/FORCAST limits the utility of this combined fitting pipeline. However, higher resolution MIR observations, e.g., with JWST, are expected to greatly expand the applicability of this fitting technique to protostars across the Galaxy.
#### Observational Analysis of Multi-thermal Counter-streaming Flows in a Forming Filament and Their Relationship with Local Heating at Filament Footpoints

 - **Abstract**
 Utilizing high-resolution imaging and spectroscopic observations from the New Vacuum Solar Telescope (NVST), the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS), and the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), we investigated the nature and origin of counter-streaming flows within a forming active region filament. The ever-present counter-streaming flows observed within the filament are identified as interleaved unidirectional mass flows in opposing directions occurring in neighboring threads. Multi-wavelength observations corroborate the multi-thermal nature of these counter-streaming flows: the cool H$\alpha$ component flows at about 10--20 km s$^{-1}$, while the warm ultraviolet and extreme ultraviolet components reach 40--70 km s$^{-1}$. The Si~{\sc iv} 1400~Å line reveals significant micro-turbulence in the filament's counter-streaming flows, with a nonthermal velocity width of 40 km s$^{-1}$. These multi-thermal flows emanate from compact brightenings at the filament's ends, manifesting as small-scale, collimated upflows at their nascent phase. They continuously inject both chromospheric and transition region plasma into the filament channel, thereby feeding the counter-streaming flows. At their base, the Si~{\sc iv} and C~{\sc ii} spectral lines show pronounced line broadening and intensity enhancements, indicating significant localized chromospheric heating. Additionally, numerous small-scale photospheric flux emergence and cancellation events, with magnitude of $10^{17}$~Mx, are detected near their base. We suggest such weak magnetic-field activities, possibly associated with unresolved magnetic reconnection events, drive these persistent upflows and localized footpoint heating. This work elucidates the multi-thermal origin of counter-streaming flows within a forming filament and provides evidence of localized chromospheric heating at the filament footpoints.

 - **Abstract**
 Two main models coexist for the environment in which stars form. The clustered model stipulates that the bulk of star formation occurs within dense embedded clusters, but only a minority of them survive the residual gas expulsion phase caused by massive stellar feedback unbinding the clusters. On the other hand, the hierarchical model predicts that star formation happens at a range of scales and densities, where open clusters (OCs) only emerge from the densest regions. We aim to exploit a recent catalog of compact OCs, corrected for completeness, to obtain an updated estimation of the surface density star formation rate within OCs ($\sum_{\rm SFR,OC}$), which we compare with recent estimates of $\sum_{\rm SFR}$ to determine which model is more likely. We have applied two methods. The first one consisted of integrating over the power law that was fit for the mass function of the youngest OCs using a MC sampling. The second one consisted of counting the total compact mass within these youngest OCs within 1 kpc, so that the result could be directly compared with local values of $\sum_{\rm SFR}$. We estimated new $\sum_{\rm SFR,OC}$ values between $736^{+159}_{-176}$ and $875^{+34}_{-35}$ M$_{\odot}$ Myr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$, depending on the methodology. These results are significantly higher than previous $\sum_{\rm SFR,OC}$ estimates, which we attribute to the incompleteness of past catalogs, and are consistent with the majority ($\geq$ 50 \%) or even the vast majority ($\geq$ 80 \%) of the star formation occurring in initially compact clusters, through comparisons with $\sum_{\rm SFR}$ from the recent literature. Our new $\sum_{\rm SFR,OC}$ values are consistent with clustered formation being the most dominant mode of star formation.
#### Photospheric radius expansion thermonuclear burst and X-ray reflection from the neutron star X-ray binary 4U 1702-429

 - **Abstract**
 We perform a comprehensive study of thermonuclear bursts from the neutron star low-mass X-ray binary 4U 1702-429 detected with NICER and XMM-Newton. The thermonuclear burst detected with NICER shows clear evidence of a photospheric radius expansion (PRE) event and a distinct feature in the burst profile. The burst profiles demonstrate significant energy dependence, with the hardness ratio varying notably during the PRE phase. The radius of the neutron star photosphere expanded to a maximum of $23.1_{-3.2}^{+3.8}$ km while its temperature reached a minimum of 1.4 keV. The time-resolved burst spectra can be modeled using variable persistent emission method, indicating that the soft excess may arise from enhanced mass accretion onto the neutron star, potentially due to the Poynting-Robertson drag. Alternatively, the disk reflection model can be used to explain the soft excess emission during a burst. The time-resolved spectral study is performed for three thermonuclear bursts detected with XMM-Newton. The XMM-Newton time-resolved burst spectra can be modeled using an absorbed blackbody model, without any signatures of the PRE. We conduct a detailed spectral analysis of the 2025 NuSTAR observation of 4U 1702-429, revealing a broad iron line at 6.4 keV and a Compton hump around 20 keV, indicating X-ray reflection features. The disk reflection model relxill provides an inner disk radius of 12 $R_g$ and an inclination angle of $\sim39^{\circ}$. The magnetic field strength at the pole of the neutron star is estimated to be 5.1 $\times10^8$ G, assuming that the accretion disk is truncated at magnetosphere boundary.

 - **Abstract**
 JWST/NIRCam 0.9 to 2.0 micron images reveal a population of point sources around the major galaxies in the El Gordo cluster at redshift z=0.87. Their distribution in the color--magnitude diagrams shows a narrow sequence well separated from field-galaxy contamination and consistent with their identification as ultra-compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs) or luminous globular clusters (GCs). The point-source sequence is more luminous by almost a magnitude than the corresponding sequence in Abell 2744 at z=0.31, matching the predicted evolutionary change for GC/UCDs over the 4-Gyr difference in lookback time between these two clusters. Deeper observations should allow direct JWST imaging of GC/UCD populations, even without the help of lensing, up to z ~ 1.4, a lookback time of more than 9 Gyr. Such observations would directly reveal the evolution of these compact stellar systems two-thirds of the way back to the Big Bang.

 - **Abstract**
 Both star clusters and variable stars are sensitive laboratories of stellar astrophysics and evolution: cluster member stars provide context for interpreting cluster populations, whereas variability reveals the nature of individual stellar systems. The European Space Agency's Gaia mission has revolutionized the census of star clusters in the Milky Way, while simultaneously providing an unprecedented homogeneous all-sky catalog of variable stars. Here, we leverage the third Gaia data release to obtain an empirical bird's eye view of stellar evolution based on 34760 variable stars residing in 1192 Galactic open clusters (OCs) containing 173294 members (variable member fraction 20.0%). Using precise OC distances, dereddened magnitudes, and consistently determined ages, we a) pinpointed regions of pulsational instability across the color-absolute magnitude diagram (CaMD); b) traced the occurrence rate of variables as a function of age, and c) considered the evolution of rotation periods and photometric activity (gyrochronology). The occurrence of pulsating stars can serve as a model- and reddening-independent age estimator. Our results underline that jointly considering stellar variability and OC membership enables a plethora of further applications, such as age dating or dereddening OCs based on expected CaMD locations of variable stars. Upcoming Gaia data releases and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory will vastly increase the extent to which the details of variable stars in OCs can empirically unravel the astrophysics and evolution of stellar populations.

 - **Abstract**
 The "dirty" image made by direct Fourier inversion of visibility data is an important first step in inteferometric imaging. This is where the "deconvolution problem" is defined and the degree to which that problem is either well- or ill-conditioned has direct consequences for the ultimate image fidelity that is achieved in practise. An under-utilised degree of freedom during Fourier imaging is the relative weights that are assigned to the visibility data. We explore the circumstances under which some adjustment of the relative weights might provide improvements to the "dirty" image, and consequently the ultimate post-deconvolution image fidelity. We develop a method to calculate a distinct effective local density estimate for each data point. When used in conjunction with a "uniform" weight correction and the desired clean beam (eg. Gaussian) tapering, it provides a significant improvement in the image quality over that provided by the current pixel-based density estimate. In many cases, particularly spectral-line observations and those with only limited sidereal tracking, this adaptive approach improves the beam quality by a factor of 2 to 10, as measured by the RMS residual relative to the best-fitting clean beam, providing an improvement in final image fidelity that is similar in magnitude.

 - **Abstract**
 The TIRAMISU code, a new program for computing on-the-fly non-LTE molecular spectra and opacities for solving self-consistent radiative transfer problems in exoplanet atmospheres, is presented. The ultra-hot Jupiter KELT-20 b is used as a case study to identify the wavelength regions at which non-LTE effects may be detectable. It is shown that upper atmospheric OH in vibrational non-LTE should be observable primarily via hot bands in the mid-infrared and enhanced photodissociation in the visible. Varying the abundance of OH in non-LTE demonstrates a non-linear relationship between the abundance and the strength of non-LTE effects. Using recent calculations of the photodissociation probabilities of OH it is shown that non-LTE effects can increase the total photodissociation rate by two orders of magnitude in the upper atmosphere, which is likely to have a significant impact on atmospheric and chemical modelling. Increases and reductions in the molecular opacities under non-LTE conditions may lead to the mischaracterisation of molecular abundances in retrievals that only consider opacities computed under LTE. Collisional data requirements to support future non-LTE modelling for a variety of exoplanet atmospheres and across a wide range of wavelengths are discussed.
#### Self-Consistent Heating of the Magnetically Closed Solar Corona: Generation of Nanoflares, Thermodynamic Response of the Plasma and Observational Signatures

 - **Abstract**
 The energy that heats the magnetically closed solar corona originates in the complex motions of the massive photosphere. Turbulent photospheric convection slowly displaces the footpoints of coronal field lines, causing them to become twisted and tangled. Magnetic stresses gradually build until reaching a breaking point when the field reconnects and releases a sudden burst of energy. We simulate this basic picture of nanoflares using a high-fidelity, three-dimensional, multi-stranded magnetohydrodynamic simulation that starts with a fully stratified atmosphere. This simulation includes the effects of field-aligned thermal conduction and optically thin radiation and uses the state-of-the-art Transition Region Adaptive Conduction (TRAC) method to capture the response of the plasma to the nanoflare heating. We find that our physical model supports a unified explanation for both the diffuse emission observed in active regions and the bright coronal loops. Specifically, our results suggest that the diffuse emission originates from spatially and temporally uncorrelated nanoflares, whereas coherent clusters of nanoflares - nanoflare storms - are responsible for the formation of bright coronal loops. Quantitative comparisons between the simulated emission and observed characteristics of coronal loops show that key observed properties - such as loop widths, lifetimes and cross sections - are reasonably well reproduced by the model. The idea that avalanche spread naturally leads to circular cross sections in coronal loops is strongly supported. Our results also suggest that phase differences in heating and cooling events across neighboring magnetic flux strands are a plausible explanation for the anomalous cross-field motions of coronal loops that were recently reported in high-resolution observations.

 - **Abstract**
 The Unification Model of AGN suggests that all AGN galaxies should exhibit similar line ratios in their spectra. NGC 5548, a Seyfert I, underwent obscuration -- similar to naturally obscured Seyfert II galaxies -- due to an outflowing accretion wind, resulting in absorption. As per the Model, a Seyfert I and a Seyfert II should show similar flux ratios during their respective obscuration states. In this note, we present a comparison of emission fluxes between NGC 5548 and NGC 1068, a Seyfert II. We present the CLOUDY prediction of NGC 5548, which underpredicts the line ratios compared to observations, likely due to SED choices. The differing observed line ratios of NGC 5548 and NGC 1068 suggest additional unknown factors in the unification model.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar flare ribbons are believed to map the footpoints of newly reconnected magnetic flux tubes, therefore shedding light on the reconnecting current sheet, which is rarely observed by direct imaging or spectroscopy. Here we study the detailed evolution of flare ribbons down to the arcsecond scale for 10 flares characterized by the classic double ribbons. Identifying the flaring pixels by combining the intensity variances of the UV filter ratio and intensity threshold, we found that the waiting time distributions of the flaring pixels are well described by power laws, distinct from those in the preflare or quiet-Sun regions, and that the power-law slopes are generally consistent with those predicted by nonstationary Poisson processes in the nonlinear regime or by the 2D/3D self-organized criticality (SOC) model. The size distributions for flaring duration also follow power laws but the slopes are more scattered. In contrast, the size distributions for other parameters, including peak intensity, energy, and radial magnetic field strength of the flaring pixels, deviate from power laws, and the estimated slopes significantly differ from the SOC predictions. These results suggest that a nonstationary Poisson process or an avalanche-like process might be ongoing in the temporal dimension in the reconnecting current sheet, but in other aspects, e.g., space- and energy-wise, the avalanche is likely modulated by other physical processes or the fine structures of the reconnecting current sheet.
#### EP250207b is not a collapsar fast X-ray transient. Is it due to a compact object merger?

 - **Abstract**
 Fast X-ray Transients (FXTs) are short-lived extra-galactic X-ray sources. Recent progress through multi-wavelength follow-up of Einstein Probe discovered FXTs has shown that several are related to collapsars, which can also produce gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). In this paper we investigate the nature of the FXT EP250207b. The VLT/MUSE spectra of a nearby (15.9 kpc in projection) lenticular galaxy reveal no signs of recent star formation. If this galaxy is indeed the host, EP250207b lies at a redshift of z=0.082, implying a peak observed absolute magnitude for the optical counterpart of M_r=-14.5. At the time when supernovae (SNe) would peak, it is substantially fainter than all SN types. These results are inconsistent with a collapsar origin for EP250207b. The properties favour a binary compact object merger driven origin. The X-ray, optical and radio observations are compared with predictions of several types of extra-galactic transients, including afterglow and kilonova models. The data can be fit with a slightly off-axis viewing angle afterglow. However, the late-time (~30 day) optical/NIR counterpart is too bright for the afterglow and also for conventional kilonova models. This could be remedied if that late emission is due to a globular cluster or the core of a (tidally disrupted) dwarf galaxy. If confirmed, this would be the first case where the multi-wavelength properties of an FXT are found to be consistent with a compact object merger origin, increasing the parallels between FXTs and GRBs. We finally discuss if the source could originate in a higher redshift host galaxy.
#### Double-Peaked Optical Afterglows with X-ray Shallow Decay Inferring a Magnetized Thick Shell Ejecta

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray bursts early afterglows are important tracers for determining the radial structure and magnetization of the ejecta. In this paper, we focus on GRB 110213A that shows double-peaked optical afterglow lightcurves and the shallow decay feature of the X-ray afterglow. We adopt a semi-analytic model for the dynamics of forward and reverse shocks generated through an interaction between an arbitrary magnetized ejecta with a finite thickness and a stratified circumstellar medium. Multiwavelength radiation from forward and reverse shocks seen from an arbitrary viewing angle is calculated under a thin-shell approximation. Our analysis with multimodal nested sampling methods for GRB 110213A suggests that the thick shell ejecta naturally explains the shallow decay feature of the X-ray afterglow. The combination of the reverse shock emission in the strongly magnetized jet and forward shock emission in the weakly magnetized circumstellar medium makes the double peak feature of the optical afterglows. The estimated low radiative efficiency in the prompt phase may be a consequence of the high magnetization of the jet in this case. A multi-messenger emission simulator based on the magnetic bullet afterglow model is publicly available as the open source Julia package "Magglow".
