 - **Abstract**
 FAST observations have recently identified a compact HI cloud (hereafter Cloud-9) in the vicinity of the spiral galaxy M94. This identification has been confirmed independently by VLA and GBT observations. Cloud-9 has the same recession velocity as M94, and is therefore at a similar distance ($\sim$4.4 Mpc). It is compact ($\sim$1$'$ radius, or $\sim$1.4 kpc), dynamically cold ($W_{50}=12$ km/s), non-rotating, and fairly massive, with an HI mass of $\sim 10^{6}$ $M_{\odot}$. Here we present deep HST/ACS imaging designed to search for a luminous stellar counterpart. We visually rule out the presence of any dwarf galaxy with stellar mass exceeding 10$^{3.5}$$M_{\odot}$. A more robust color-magnitude diagram-based analysis rules out a 10$^{4}$$M_{\odot}$ stellar counterpart with 99.5$\%$ confidence. The non-detection of a luminous component reinforces the interpretation that this system is a Reionization-Limited HI Cloud (RELHIC); i.e., a starless dark matter halo filled with hydrostatic gas in thermal equilibrium with the cosmic ultraviolet background. Our results make Cloud-9 the leading RELHIC candidate of any known compact HI cloud. This provides strong support for a cornerstone prediction of the $\Lambda$CDM model, namely the existence of gas-filled starless dark matter halos on sub-galactic mass scales, and constrains the present-day threshold halo mass for galaxy formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Stars and planets form within cold, dark molecular clouds. In these dense regions, where starlight cannot penetrate, cosmic rays (CRs) are the dominant source of ionization -- driving interstellar chemistry(Dalgarno (2006, PNAS, 103, 12269)), setting the gas temperature(Goldsmith et al. (1969, ApJ, 158, 173)), and enabling coupling to magnetic fields(McKee & Ostriker (2007, ARA&A, 45, 565; arXiv:0707.3514)). Together, these effects regulate the collapse of clouds and the onset of star formation. Despite this importance, the cosmic-ray ionization rate, $\zeta$, has never been measured directly. Instead, this fundamental parameter has been loosely inferred from indirect chemical tracers and uncertain assumptions, leading to published values that span nearly two orders of magnitude and limiting our understanding of star formation physics. Here, we report the first direct detection of CR-excited vibrational H$_2$ emission, using \textit{James Webb Space Telescope} (JWST) observations of the starless core Barnard 68 (B68). The observed emission pattern matches theoretical predictions for CR excitation precisely, confirming a decades-old theoretical proposal long considered observationally inaccessible. This result enables direct measurement of $\zeta$, effectively turning molecular clouds into natural, light-year-sized, cosmic-ray detectors. It opens a transformative observational window into the origin, propagation, and role of cosmic rays in star formation and galaxy evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Accreting white dwarfs in close binary systems, commonly known as cataclysmic variables (CVs), with orbital periods below the canonical period minimum ($\approx$ 80 minutes) are rare. Such short periods can only be reached if the donor star in the CV is either significantly evolved before initiating mass transfer to the white dwarf (WD) or metal-poor. We present optical photometry and spectroscopy of Gaia19bxc, a high-amplitude variable identified as a polar CV with an exceptionally short orbital period of 64.42 minutes - well below the canonical CV period minimum. High-speed photometry confirms persistent double-peaked variability consistent with cyclotron beaming, thus indicating the presence of a magnetic WD. Phase-resolved Keck/LRIS spectroscopy reveals strong hydrogen and helium emission lines but no donor features, indicating the accretor is a magnetic WD and the donor is hydrogen-rich, but cold and faint. The absence of a detectable donor and the low inferred temperature ($\lesssim$ 3500 K) disfavor an evolved donor scenario. Instead, the short period and the system's halo-like kinematics suggest Gaia19bxc may be the first known metal-poor polar. Because metal-poor donors are more compact than solar-metallicity donors of the same mass, they can reach shorter minimum periods. Gaia19bxc is one of only a handful of known metal-poor CVs below the canonical period minimum and has the shortest period of any such magnetic system discovered to date.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze eight spectroscopically confirmed Little Red Dots (LRDs) at redshifts z = 5.1-8.7 with JWST/NIRCam, NIRSpec, and MIRI data. The LRDs have red NIRCam colors, F150W-F444W > 1, but flat NIRCam-MIRI colors, -0.5 < F444W - F770W < 0.5, suggesting weak warm/hot dust components. The LRDs have -1.0 < F1000W - F1500W < 1.1, suggestive of non-uniform rest near-IR properties within the sample. We model the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the LRDs using the CIGALE and Prospector codes to assess how the differing templates impact the interpretation for LRDs for cases of: (1) models with star-forming stellar populations only; (2) active galactic nuclei (AGN) dominated models; and (3) composite AGN and star-forming models. Using the Bayesian information criterion, we find that six of the eight LRDs favor AGN models compared to star-forming models, though no model can fully reproduce all of the observed properties. Two LRDs with pronounced Balmer-breaks and broad H$_\alpha$ have SEDs that can be reproduced with hot, dense-gas (log T/K=5-5.7, log n/cm$^{-3}$ = 9-11) models with low dust attenuation (A(V)~ 0.5mag). However, these models require an additional thermal component (800-1400K) to account for the MIRI data, and fail to reproduce the rest-UV and narrow [OIII] emission. The total bolometric emission from the dense-gas models, and possibly CIGALE AGN models, appear consistent with literature constraints in the far-IR and radio, and require log L$_{bol}$/L$_\odot$ <12. These results suggest that our LRDs cannot be modeled entirely with standard templates, but instead require a novel treatment of gas conditions, AGN and star-formation.

 - **Abstract**
 The neutron star X-ray transient MAXI J1807+132 has undergone outbursts in 2017, 2019, and 2023. We conducted an $R$-band time series photometry campaign using the Isaac Newton Telescope during the 2022 quiescent state. We detected a periodic variation in the light curve, consistent with ellipsoidal modulation, which allowed us to determine an orbital period of $P_{\rm orb} = 4.258 \pm 0.008$ hr. By modelling the light curve, we obtained a binary inclination of $ i = 72\pm5 \, °$ and a mass ratio $q = 0.24^{+0.19}_{-0.14}$ ($68$ per cent confidence level). Furthermore, our analysis supports an early M-dwarf companion that contributes between 30 and 50 per cent to the total flux in the $R$-band. We extend the previously established absolute magnitude versus orbital period correlation for black hole X-ray transients to neutron star systems. We applied the correlation to MAXI J1807+132, estimating its distance as $6.3 \pm 0.7$ kpc and its height above the Galactic plane to be $1.6 \pm 0.2$ kpc.

 - **Abstract**
 Self-Interacting Dark Matter (SIDM) represents a compelling alternative to collisionless dark matter, with diverse phenomenological signals from dwarf galaxy to galaxy cluster scales. We present new constraints on the SIDM cross section from the galaxy cluster MACS J0138-2155, host to the strongly lensed supernovae Requiem and Encore. Our analysis combines strong gravitational lensing with spatially resolved stellar kinematics of the central galaxy, employing several methodological advances over previous cluster-scale SIDM studies. The result is a self-consistent measurement of the density profile of MACS J0138-2155 across two orders of magnitude in radius. Our lensing and kinematics analyses individually yield highly consistent results, and from their combination we report a 95% confidence upper limit on the SIDM cross section of $\sigma/m < 0.613$ cm$^2$/g, at an interaction velocity of $\langle v_\text{pair}\rangle < 2090$ km/s. This constraint, derived from the most detailed single-system analysis to date, is competitive with previous cluster-scale limits while demonstrating the power of combining complementary gravitational probes. The methodology developed here advances precision cluster lens modeling and will inform future studies of dark matter physics, as well as time-delay cosmography in this unique strong lensing system. Additionally, our results imply SN Requiem will reappear sooner than previously reported, with a 1$\sigma$ CL between January 2027 and November 2028 at H$_0 = 67.7$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$.

 - **Abstract**
 We present high-sensitivity follow-up observations of the giant fossil radio lobe in the Ophiuchus galaxy cluster with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) in the 125-250 MHz and 300-500 MHz frequency bands. The new data have sufficient angular resolution to exclude compact sources and enable us to trace the faint extended emission from the relic lobe to a remarkable distance of 820 kpc from the cluster center. The new images reveal intricate spatial structure within the fossil lobe, including narrow (5-10 kpc), long (70-100 kpc) radio filaments embedded within the diffuse emission at the bottom of the lobe. The filaments exhibit a very steep spectrum ($S_\nu\propto \nu^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha \sim 3$), significantly steeper than the ambient synchrotron emission from the lobe ($\alpha \sim 1.5-2$); they mostly disappear in recently-published MeerKAT images at 1.28 GHz. Their origin is unclear; similar features observed in some other radio lobes typically have a spectrum flatter than that of their ambient medium. These radio filaments may trace regions where the magnetic field has been stretched and amplified by gas circulation within the rising bubble. The spectrum of the brightest region of the radio lobe exhibits a spectral break, which corresponds to a radiative cooling age of the fossil lobe of approximately 174 Myr, giving a date for this most powerful AGN explosion.

 - **Abstract**
 We report photometric observations of Comet 103P/Hartley 2 during its 2023 apparition. Our campaign, conducted from August through December 2023, combined data from a global network of citizen astronomers coordinated by Unistellar and the Association Française d'Astronomie. Photometry was derived using an automated pipeline for eVscope observations in partnership with the SETI Institute and aperture photometry via AstroLab Stellar. We find that the comet's peak reduced brightness, measured at $G_{\rm min} = 10.24 \pm 0.47$, continues a long-term fading trend since 1991. The decline in activity follows a per-apparition minimum magnitude increase of $\Delta G_{\rm min} = 0.59 \pm 0.11$ mag, corresponding to an approximately $42\%$ reduction in brightness each return. This trend implies that the comet's active fraction has declined by about an order of magnitude since 1991 and may indicate that Hartley 2 is no longer hyperactive by definition. The fading is consistent with progressive volatile depletion rather than orbital effects. These results offer insight into the evolutionary processes shaping Jupiter-family comets.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutron stars are the most compact horizonless objects in the Universe, exhibiting the strongest known magnetic fields. They are potential sources of coincident gravitational waves and electromagnetic radiation across the entire spectrum. However, the internal configuration of their magnetic fields and the mechanisms that stabilize them remain open questions. As a step forward in understanding the timescale for the emergence of magnetic instabilities that disrupt stellar field configurations, we study the impact of stellar rotation using three-dimensional general relativistic numerical simulations of uniformly rotating, isolated neutron stars threaded by strong, poloidal, pulsar-like magnetic fields. The initial stellar configurations assume perfect conductivity and are stationary and axisymmetric. We explore a range of angular velocities, from non-rotating stars to those near the mass-shedding limit. We find that the stars spontaneously develop differential rotation, which triggers the appearance of a strong toroidal magnetic field component. Non-rotating neutron stars are unstable to the Tayler and Parker instabilities, which significantly change the magnetic field geometry. These instabilities lead to a rapid reduction of the initial magnetic energy by $\sim 99\%$ within $\sim 4$ Alfvén times of their onset. In contrast, rotation significantly delays the development of these instabilities and, in some cases, mitigates their effects. Highly rotating models retain up to $\sim 30\%$ of their magnetic energy for at least $\sim 10$ Alfvén times. Our results suggest that rotation plays a crucial role in stabilizing the magnetic field of neutron stars, regardless of its initial configuration.
#### Low-ionization structures in planetary nebulae -- IV. The molecular hydrogen counterpart

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Low-ionization structures (LISs), found in all morphological types of planetary nebulae (PNe), are small-scale features prominent in emission from low-ionization species such as [N ii], [S ii], [O ii] and [O i]. Observational and theoretical efforts have aimed to better understand their origin and nature. Recently, the detection of molecular hydrogen (H$_2$) emission associated with LISs in a few PNe has added a new piece to the puzzle of understanding these nebular structures. Aims. Although observational studies indicate that LISs are characterized by lower electron densities than their host PNe, model predictions suggest higher total densities in these structures. The detection of H$_2$ emission from LISs in more PNe could help reconcile the observations with model predictions. Methods. Observations of five PNe with already known LISs were conducted using the Near InfraRed Imager and Spectrometer (NIRI) mounted on the 8 m Gemini North telescope. A narrow band filter, centered on H$_2$ 1-0 2.122 ${\mu}$m emission line, was used along with a continuum filter, to ensure continuum subtraction. Results. We present a deep, high-angular resolution near-IR narrowband H$_2$ 1-0 S(1) imaging survey of five Galactic PNe with LISs. We nearly double the sample of LISs detected in the H$_2$ 1-0 2.122 ${\mu}$m emission line as well as the number of host PNe. These findings allows us to prove that the systematically lower electron density in LISs --relative to the rims and shells of their host nebulae-- is linked to the presence of H2 molecular gas. Additionally, we provide the first estimation of the excited H$_2$ molecular mass in LISs, which is found between 200 and 5000 times lower than the corresponding ionized gas mass.

 - **Abstract**
 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) exhibit excess mid-infrared H$_2$ emission compared to star-forming galaxies, likely driven by outflows and shocks inferred from integrated spectra. We present optical IFU observations of the central 2\,kpc of the AGN host CGCG 012-070, selected for its pronounced H$_2$ emission excess, to map stellar and gas kinematics. The stellar velocity field is well described by a rotating disc with a line of nodes at $103^\circ \pm 4^\circ$, with the northwest side approaching and the southeast side receding. Gas kinematics, traced by strong emission lines, show two components: a narrow one ($\sigma \lesssim 200\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$) in the disc plane following stellar motions, and a broad ($\sigma \gtrsim 300\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$) associated with outflows within the inner $\sim$1\,kpc. Disc gas emission is mainly driven by AGN photoionization, while the outflow also includes shock-heated gas, as indicated by flux ratio diagnostics. The outflows are radiatively driven, with a mass-outflow rate of $(0.067 \pm 0.026)\,M_{\odot}\,{\rm yr^{-1}}$ and a kinetic coupling efficiency of 0.07%, potentially redistributing gas and contributing to maintenance-mode feedback in CGCG 012-070. Our results provide further evidence that the warm H$_2$ emission excess in nearby AGN is associated with shocks produced by outflows. Observations of other gas phases, such as cold molecular gas, are necessary to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the impact of the outflows on the host galaxy.
#### Revisiting the Radial Metallicity Gradient-Age Relation in the Milky Way's Thin and Thick Disks

 - **Abstract**
 Galactic disks typically exhibit a negative radial metallicity gradient, indicating faster enrichment in the inner regions. Recent studies report that this gradient becomes flatter with increasing stellar age in the Milky Way's (MW) thin disk, while the thick disk exhibits a mildly positive gradient across all ages. In this work, we revisit the metallicity gradient-age relation (MGAR) in both the thin and thick disks of the MW. We use spectroscopic data from LAMOST DR8 and stellar ages calibrated with asteroseismology. Our results show a steadily flattening MGAR in the thin disk and confirm a positive gradient $\sim0.013\,\mathrm{dex\,kpc^{-1}}$ in the thick disk. The flattening in the thin disk may be caused by large-scale radial migration induced by transient spiral arms, or by a time-dependent steepening of the interstellar medium (ISM) metallicity gradient as suggested by recent FIRE2 simulations. The positive gradient in the thick disk may reflect early enrichment of the outer regions by strong feedback or starburst-driven outflows in a turbulent, gas-rich proto-disk. These findings suggest distinct chemodynamical evolution paths for the MW's thin and thick disks and provide valuable constraints for future models of Galactic chemical evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we propose an energy decomposition method to improve the numerical stability of time-evolving magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) coronal models, enabling them to resolve the stronger magnetic field during solar maxima without significantly filtering out small-scale structures from the observed this http URL advance the decomposed energy that excludes the magnetic energy, instead of the total energy, in time. It avoids the operation of subtracting a large magnetic energy from the total energy to obtain a very small thermal pressure in low-beta regions, thereby improving the numerical stability of MHD models. We implemented this method in COCONUT and validated the model by performing a time-evolving coronal simulation during Carrington Rotation (CR) 2296, a solar maximum CR. We also compare quasi-steady-state simulation results during the solar minimum and the increasing phase, calculated using both versions of COCONUT adopting the decomposed energy equation and the traditional full energy equation to further validate the reliability of the energy decomposition method. The simulation results show that the energy decomposition method yields results nearly identical to those of the traditional full energy equation during solar minimum, while significantly enhancing COCONUT's ability to simulate coronal evolution under strong magnetic fields, even those exceeding 100 Gauss. This method is well suited for performing quasi-realistic time-evolving coronal simulations around solar maxima without excessively filtering out the observed strong magnetic fields.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the TESS observations of CRTS J110014.7+131552, SDSS J093537.46+161950.8, and [PK2008] HalphaJ130559. Among them, a superoutburst is observed in CRTS J110014.7+131552 which is associated with the precursor outburst, where prominent superhumps are observed during maximum of the outburst with a mean period of 0.06786(1) d. We have observed variations in the superhump period, along with changes in the shape of the light curve profile and the amplitude of the superhumps during different phases of the outburst, indicating disc-radius variation as well as periodically variable dissipation at the accretion stream's bright spot. The data on SDSS J093537.46+161950.8 reveal previously unknown variations modulated with periods 0.06584(2) d and 2.36(2) d, related to the positive superhump and the disc-precession periods, respectively, which can reasonably be interpreted as a result of the prograde rotation of an eccentric accretion disc. Despite its short orbital period, the lack of outburst activity, along with its stable long-term brightness, discovery spectrum, and absolute magnitude suggests that the object might not be an SU UMa type dwarf nova. Instead, it may belong to the group of high mass-transfer CVs below the period gap, either to a rare class of nova-like variables or to the class of high-luminosity IPs, a subclass of magnetic CVs. For [PK2008] HalphaJ130559, a new average orbital period of 0.15092(1) d has been identified. Additionally, this system displays previously undetected average periods of 0.14517(3) d and 3.83(1) d, which can be provisionally identified as negative superhump and disc-precession periods, respectively. If the identified simultaneous signals do indeed reflect negative superhump and disc-precession period variations then their origin may be associated with the retrograde precession of a tilted disc and its interaction with the secondary stream.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the quenching mechanisms in dwarf galaxies is crucial for constraining models of galaxy formation and evolution. In this vein, isolated dwarf galaxies offer valuable insight by helping disentangle the relative roles of internal and environmental processes in shutting down star formation. Here we report the discovery of a quiescent early-type dwarf galaxy (dE), SDSS J011754.86+095819.0 (hereafter dE01+09), located in a nearly isolated environment at a projected distance of approximately one megaparsec from its most likely host group, the NGC 524 group. dE01+09 has M_r = -15.72 and g-r = 0.67 mag and its light profile is well described by a Sérsic function with an index n = 1.1, consistent with typical dEs. Using optical spectroscopy from the DESI survey, we derive its simple stellar population properties, finding an intermediate luminosity-weighted age of 8.3$\pm$1.4 Gyr and a subsolar metallicity of -1.19$\pm$0.21 dex -- characteristics comparable to those of classical quiescent dEs. We propose that NGC 524 may represent an extreme example of group dynamics, in which a member galaxy, dE01+09, is ejected from its host group and subsequently evolves as an isolated system in the field.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the potential of upcoming 21-cm interferometric observations to probe interacting dark matter (IDM). We focus on scenarios where the dark matter-baryon scattering cross-section scales as $\sigma(v) =\sigma_{0} v^n$, with $\sigma_{0}$ being the normalization constant, $v$ the relative velocity between dark matter and baryons, and $n$ characterizing the velocity dependence. Specifically, we emphasize two cases: Coulomb-like interaction ($n = -4$) and velocity-independent interaction ($n = 0$). Using detailed simulations of the 21-cm power spectrum and the Fisher matrix formalism, we forecast the sensitivity of the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA), which targets the frequency range 50-225 MHz, to both IDM and astrophysical parameters. We marginalize over key astrophysical uncertainties, including star formation efficiency, ionizing photon escape fraction, and X-ray luminosity. Our results demonstrate that 21-cm power spectrum measurements can significantly improve sensitivity to IDM cross-section, with at least a factor of five improvement over global signal forecasts for the $n=0$ case, and more than an order of magnitude enhancement for the $n=-4$ scenario. These forecasts also significantly improve upon the existing bounds from cosmic microwave background and Milky Way satellite abundance observations. Our analysis also shows that the IDM cross-section exhibits no correlation with the parameters associated with star formation efficiency and ionizing photon escape fraction of Population-II stars. However, we find that the Coulomb-like cross-section is positively correlated with X-ray luminosity. Our results highlight the critical role of accounting for astrophysical uncertainties in obtaining robust inferences of dark matter-baryon interactions from future 21-cm power spectrum observations.

 - **Abstract**
 WASP-52 b is an inflated hot Jupiter with a large Roche lobe filling fraction, positioned in the hot Neptune desert. Previous in-transit observations of the helium triplet at 10833 A have reported a range of excess absorption values (1.5%-5.5%) and a lack of net blueshift relative to the planet's rest frame, distinguishing it from other escaping atmospheres. This study investigates the extent and morphology of material escaping from WASP-52 b, assessing whether its outflow resembles a stream-like structure, as suggested for HAT-P-67 b and HAT-P-32 b. We obtained high-resolution spectra with CRIRES+ and CARMENES, covering a broader orbital phase range ($\varphi \approx \pm0.1, \pm0.2, 0.5$) than previous studies. By analyzing the He I 10833 A line as a tracer of escape, we search for extended absorption beyond transit. Additionally, we explore possible outflow morphologies with three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamic simulations, coupled with an improved radiative transfer approach, assessing the He I 10833 A triplet. The helium line shows no significant evidence of planetary material at the orbital phases observed in this work, though 3D modeling suggests such a structure could exist below observational detection limits. We conclude that the atmospheric outflow of WASP-52 b can be characterized by an intermediate hydrodynamic escape parameter, placing it in a transitional regime between cold outflows forming a stream-like morphology and hot outflows forming a tail. Additionally, the absence of a detectable in-transit blueshift in the helium line rules out a strong day-to-nightside anisotropy scenario.

 - **Abstract**
 The emission from the relativistically hot plasmas of high-energy astrophysical synchrotron sources, Pulsar Wind Nebulae (PWNe) in particular, depends on the level of magnetic fluctuations. Recent observations by the X-ray polarimeter IXPE support the presence of turbulence, with varying conditions even in different regions of a same source. We aim at modeling such synchrotron emission, and in particular the degree of linear polarization, by using for the first time 3D relativistic MHD turbulence simulations. Thanks to a novel accelerated version of the ECHO code, a series of 3D relativistic MHD simulations are performed assuming a relativistically hot plasma and various degrees of magnetization, mimicking different conditions encountered in synchrotron sources. Magnetic fluctuations at random directions with respect to a background field are initialized at large scales. After the turbulent cascade is fully developed, the statistical properties of the plasma and of the synthetic synchrotron emission maps are analyzed. Turbulence rapidly relaxes to a sort of Alfvénic equilibrium and a Kolmogorov cascade with slope -5/3 soon develops, with differences depending on the initial ratio $\eta$ of magnetic fluctuations over the background field. Dissipation mostly occurs in thin current sheets, where (numerical) reconnection takes place, intermittency and deviation from isotropic Gaussian distributions are observed. Synthetic synchrotron maps and their statistical properties depend on $\eta$ too, approaching analytical estimates for large $\eta$. The integrated degree of linear polarization is found to cover the whole range of observed values in PWNe, and its dependence on the relative amplitude of turbulent fluctuations shows a good agreement with analytical estimates, even in the presence of anisotropy.

 - **Abstract**
 Using \tess\ short-cadence (120\,s) SAP flux, we identified a rotational frequency of 0.09655\,$\mathrm{d}^{-1}$ ($P_\mathrm{rot}=10.35733$\,d). Wavelet analysis reveals that while the amplitudes of the harmonic components vary over time, the strength of the primary rotational frequency remains stable. A SED analysis of multi-band photometric data yields an effective temperature ($T_\mathrm{eff}$) of {11,750\,K.} %MDPI: Comma added for five digits in the whole text, please check. High-resolution spectroscopic observations covering wavelengthrange 4500--7000\,Å provide refined estimates of \teff\, =\, 13,814\, $\pm$\, 400\,K, \logg\,=\, 4.09\, $\pm$\, 0.08\,dex, and \vsini\, =\, 16 $\pm$ 1\,\kms. Abundance analysis shows solar-like composition of O\,\textsc{ii}, Mg\,\textsc{ii}, S\,\textsc{ii}, and Ca\,\textsc{ii}, while helium is under-abundant by 0.62\,dex. Rare earth elements (REEs) exhibit over-abundances of up to 5.2\,dex, classifying the star as an Ap/Bp-type star. AL\,Col has a radius of $R = 3.74\,\pm\,0.48{\rm R_{\odot}}$, with its H--R diagram position estimating a mass of $M = 4.2\,\pm\,0.2{\rm M_{\odot}}$ and an age of $0.12\,\pm\,0.01$ Gyr, indicating that the star has slightly evolved from the main sequence. The \tess\ light curves were modeled using a three-evolving-spot configuration, suggesting the presence of differential rotation. This star is a promising candidate for future investigations of magnetic field diagnostics and the vertical stratification of chemical elements in its atmosphere.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of time-resolved photometry, abundance analysis and Doppler imaging of an Ap star, HD 100357. The {\it TESS} photometry revealed rotational modulation with a period of 1.6279247 days. Upon inspecting the residuals after removing the rotational period and its harmonics, we found additional frequencies around 15.8054 d$^{-1}$ which we later confirmed with ground-based observations as originating from a nearby star. Using high-resolution spectroscopy, we identified HD 100357 as an Ap Si/He-wk star exhibiting rotational modulation caused by surface abundance spots. The stellar parameters of HD 100357 were determined as $T_{\rm eff}$ = 11,850 K, $\log g$ = 4.57, $\upsilon\sin i$ = 60 km\,s$^{-1}$, and an inclination angle $i$ = 72$^{\circ}$. The detailed abundance analysis revealed strongly overabundant stratified silicon, an overabundance of iron-peak elements and rare earth elements combined with remarkably deficient helium. Mapping of Fe and Cr abundances revealed the existence of ring-shaped regions with a lower concentration of the elements. Their geometry might reflect the orientation of the hypothetical magnetic field of the star, oriented $\sim$90$^{\circ}$ to the rotational axis. HD 100357, with its strong chemical peculiarities and indications of possible magnetic fields, represents an interesting candidate for follow-up spectropolarimetric observations aimed at investigating its magnetic field topology and stellar activity.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze three epochs of HST imaging over 20 years for the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy, measuring precise proper motions for 119 stars and combining them with 1760 existing line-of-sight velocities. This catalog yields the first radially-resolved 3D velocity dispersion profiles for Sculptor. We confirm mild oblate rotation, with major-axis velocities reaching $\sim 2$ km s$^{-1}$ beyond 20.0 arcmin. Using a methodology similar to that in the first paper in this series, we solve the Jeans equations in oblate axisymmetric geometry to infer the galaxy's mass profile. Our modeling reveals a significant degeneracy due to the unknown galaxy inclination, which is overlooked under spherical symmetry assumptions. This degeneracy allows acceptable fits across a range of dark matter profiles, from cuspy to cored. While we do not directly constrain the inclination with our Jeans models, higher-order line-of-sight velocity moments provide useful additional constraints: comparisons with scalefree models from de Bruijne et al. (1996) favor highly flattened (more face-on) configurations. Adopting an inclination well consistent with these comparisons ($i = 57.1$ degrees), we find, alongside radial velocity anisotropy, a dark matter density slope of $\Gamma_{\rm dark} = 0.29^{+0.31}_{-0.41}$ within the radial extent of the 3D velocity data, ruling out a cusp with $\Gamma_{\rm dark} \leq -1$ at 99.8% confidence. This confidence increases for lower inclinations and decreases drastically for nearly edge-on configurations. The results qualitatively agree with $\Lambda$CDM, SIDM, and Fuzzy DM scenarios that predict core formation, while our specific measurements provide quantitative constraints on the prescriptions of feedback, cross sections, or particle masses required by these models, respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) are the most energetic particles known - and yet their origin is still an open question. However, with the precision and accumulated statistics of the Pierre Auger Observatory and the Telescope Array, in combination with advancements in theory and modeling - e.g. of the Galactic magnetic field - it is now possible to set solid constraints on the sources of UHECRs. The spectrum and composition measurements above the ankle can be well described by a population of extragalactic, homogeneously distributed sources emitting mostly intermediate-mass nuclei. Using additionally the observed anisotropy in the arrival directions, namely the large-scale dipole >8 EeV as well as smaller-scale warmspots at higher energies, even more powerful constraints on the density and distribution of sources can be placed. Yet, open questions remain - like the striking similarity of the sources that is necessary to describe the rather pure mass composition above the ankle, or the origin of the highest energy events whose tracked back directions point towards voids. The current findings and possible interpretation of UHECR data will be presented in this review.

 - **Abstract**
 $Context.$ The quantification of the terahertz (THz) and IR optical properties of astrophysical ice analogs, which have different molecular compositions, phases, and structural properties, is required to model both the continuum emission by the dust grains covered with thick icy mantles and the radiative transfer in the dense cold regions of the interstellar medium. $Aims.$ We developed a model to define a relationship between the THz$-$IR response and the ice porosity. It includes the reduced effective optical properties of porous ices and the additional wave extinction due to scattering on pores. The model is applied to analyze the measured THz$-$IR response of CO and CO$_2$ laboratory ices and to estimate their scattering properties and porosity. $Methods.$ Our model combines the Bruggeman effective medium theory, the Lorentz-Mie and Rayleigh scattering theories, and the radiative transfer theory to analyze the measured THz$-$IR optical properties of laboratory ices. $Results.$ We apply this model to show that the electromagnetic-wave scattering in studied laboratory ices occurs mainly in the Rayleigh regime at frequencies below 32 THz. We conclude that pores of different shapes and dimensions can be approximated by spheres of effective radius. By comparing the measured broadband response of our laboratory ices with those of reportedly compact ices from earlier studies, we quantify the scattering properties of our CO and CO$_2$ ice samples. Their porosity is shown to be as high as 15% and 22%, respectively. Underestimating the ice porosity in the data analysis leads to a proportional relative underestimate of the THz$-$IR optical constants. $Conclusions.$ The scattering properties and porosity of ices have to be quantified along with their THz$-$IR response in order to adequately interpret astrophysical observations.

 We present HST2EUCLID, a novel Python code to generate Euclid realistic mock images in the $H_{\rm E}$, $J_{\rm E}$, $Y_{\rm E}$, and $I_{\rm E}$ photometric bands based on panchromatic Hubble Space Telescope observations. The software was used to create a simulated database of Euclid images for the 27 galaxy clusters observed during the Cluster Lensing And Supernova survey with Hubble (CLASH) and the Hubble Frontier Fields (HFF) program. Since the mock images were generated from real observations, they incorporate, by construction, all the complexity of the observed galaxy clusters. The simulated Euclid data of the galaxy cluster MACS J0416.1$-$2403 were then used to explore the possibility of developing strong lensing models based on the Euclid data. In this context, complementary photometric or spectroscopic follow-up campaigns are required to measure the redshifts of multiple images and cluster member galaxies. By Euclidising six parallel blank fields obtained during the HFF program, we provide an estimate of the number of galaxies detectable in Euclid images per ${\rm deg}^2$ per magnitude bin (number counts) and the distribution of the galaxy sizes. Finally, we present a preview of the Chandra Deep Field South that will be observed during the Euclid Deep Survey and two examples of galaxy-scale strong lensing systems residing in regions of the sky covered by the Euclid Wide Survey. The methodology developed in this work lends itself to several additional applications, as simulated Euclid fields based on HST (or JWST) imaging with extensive spectroscopic information can be used to validate the feasibility of legacy science cases or to train deep learning techniques in advance, thus preparing for a timely exploitation of the Euclid Survey data.
#### Modelling magnetic star-planet interaction in the iconic M dwarfs Proxima Centauri, YZ Ceti and GJ 1151

 - **Abstract**
 The unambiguous detection of magnetic star-planet interaction (SPI) via radio observations would provide a novel method for detecting exoplanets and probing their magnetic fields. Although direct radio detection of sub-Jovian planets is hindered by the low frequencies involved, models of sub-Alfvénic SPI predict that Earth-like planets in close-in orbits around M dwarfs may induce detectable emission. Here, we revisit the modelling of the expected radio emission from magnetic star-planet interaction in the iconic M-dwarf systems Proxima Centauri, YZ Ceti, and GJ 1151, where claims of SPI-related radio detections have been made. For this, we use SIRIO (Star-planet Interaction and Radio Induced Observations), a public Python code that models radio emission from sub-Alfvénic SPI. We benchmark SIRIO results against those paradigmatic systems, whose SPI modeling has been previously discussed in the literature. Our results support previous findings that Proxima b, YZ Cet b, and the putative planet GJ 1151 b are most likely in the sub-Alfvénic regime (assuming a hybrid PFSS geometry), so SPI should be at work in all of them. We find that the Alfvén wing model generally predicts a very low level of radio emission, while if magnetic reconnection takes place, prospects for detection are significantly better. We also find that free-free absorption may play a relevant role, in particular in YZ Ceti. Our SIRIO code can also be used to evaluate the feasibility of radio proposals aimed at detecting SPI, and to constrain the stellar wind mass-loss rate or planetary magnetic field.

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce a framework for the enhanced estimation of photometric redshifts using Self-Organising Maps (SOMs). Our method projects galaxy Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs) onto a two-dimensional map, identifying regions that are sparsely sampled by existing spectroscopic observations. These under-sampled areas are then augmented with simulated galaxies, yielding a more representative spectroscopic training dataset. To assess the efficacy of this SOM-based data augmentation in the context of the forthcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), we employ mock galaxy catalogues from the OpenUniverse2024 project and generate synthetic datasets that mimic the expected photometric selections of LSST after one (Y1) and ten (Y10) years of observation. We construct 501 degraded realisations by sampling galaxy colours, magnitudes, redshifts and spectroscopic success rates, in order to emulate the compilation of a wide array of realistic spectroscopic surveys. Augmenting the degraded mock datasets with simulated galaxies from the independent CosmoDC2 catalogues has markedly improved the performance of our photometric redshift estimates compared to models lacking this augmentation, particularly for high-redshift galaxies ($z_\mathrm{true} \gtrsim 1.5$). This improvement is manifested in notably reduced systematic biases and a decrease in catastrophic failures by up to approximately a factor of 2, along with a reduction in information loss in the conditional density estimations. These results underscore the effectiveness of SOM-based augmentation in refining photometric redshift estimation, thereby enabling more robust analyses in cosmology and astrophysics for the NSF-DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory.

 - **Abstract**
 Blackwidow and redback systems are millisecond pulsars in compact orbits with ultra-light and low-mass companions, respectively, collectively known as ``spider pulsars". In such systems, an intrabinary shock can form between the pulsar and the companion winds, serving as a site for particle acceleration and associated non-thermal emission. Assuming that protons can be extracted from the neutron star surface and accelerated at the intrabinary shock and/or within the pulsar wind, we model the very high-energy gamma-ray and neutrino emissions ($0.1-10^3$~TeV) produced through interactions with the companion wind and the companion star. We first calculate the high-energy emissions using an optimistic combination of parameters to maximize the gamma-ray and neutrino fluxes. We find that, for energetic spider pulsars with a spin-down power $\gtrsim 10^{35}\rm erg\, s^{-1}$ and a magnetic field of $\sim 10^{3}\, \rm G$ in the companion region, the gamma-ray emission could be detectable as point sources by CTA and LHAASO, while the neutrino emission could be detectable by the future TRIDENT detector. Finally, we build a synthetic population of these systems, compute the cumulative neutrino flux expected from spider pulsars, and compare it with the Galactic neutrino diffuse emission measured by IceCube. We find that, under realistic assumptions on the fraction of the spin-down power converted into protons, the contribution of spiders to the diffuse Galactic neutrino flux is negligible.

 - **Abstract**
 In order to understand solar atmospheric heating it is important to test heating models against spatially resolved data from solar active regions. Here we model a small active region, AR~12760 observed on 2020 April 28, with the GX Simulator package by fitting the EUV intensities in wavebands observed by Solar Dynamics Observatory's Atmospheric Imaging Assembly. We assume the temporally and spatially averaged heating rate along a loop has a power-law dependence on loop length, $L$ and average magnetic field strength along the loop, $B_{avg}$. We find that the best fit heating model for the 211~Å band is $<\!\!Q\!\!>\approx 7\times 10^{-3} (B_{avg}/{100 \mbox{G}})^{1.5}(L/{10^9\mbox{cm}})^{-1}$ erg cm$^{-3}$ s$^{-1}$ but that there is a range of parameters that give qualitatively reasonable fits, which we conclude is due to a correlation between $B_{avg}$ and $L$. In addition, we find that the models of the bands including cooler emission (131 and 171~Å) greatly underestimate the extent of the emission in the legs of the longer loops at the peripheries of the active region that are the strongest contributors of the emission in those bands. We conclude that this is because the modeling assumes that all transition region emission is confined to the loop foot points, but in reality the upper transition region of longer loops extends significantly farther into the loop. It is important to consider this aspect of the transition region in future efforts to model EUV emission.

 - **Abstract**
 Current explanations of the mass-loss mechanism for stripped-envelope supernovae remain divided between single and binary progenitor systems. Here we obtain deep ultraviolet (UV) imaging with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) of the Type Ic SN 2012fh to search for the presence of a surviving companion star to the progenitor. We synthesize these observations with archival HST imaging, ground-based spectroscopy, and previous analyses from the literature to provide three independent constraints on the progenitor system. We fit the color-magnitude diagram of the surrounding population to constrain the most likely age of the system to be $<20$ Myr. Analysis of spectra of SN 2012fh provide an estimate of the He core mass of the progenitor star, $>5.6$ M$_{\odot}$. We analyze deep HST images at the precise location after the SN faded to constrain the luminosity of any remaining main-sequence binary companion to be $\log(L/L_{\odot}) \lesssim 3.35$. Combining observational constraints with current binary population synthesis models excludes the presence of a faint stellar companion to SN 2012fh at the $\lesssim10\%$ level. The progenitor was therefore either effectively isolated at the time of explosion or orbited by a black-hole companion. The latter scenario dominates if we only consider models that produce successful supernovae.
