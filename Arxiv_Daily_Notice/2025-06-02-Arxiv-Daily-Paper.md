#### Universal Radial Scaling of Large-Scale Black Hole Accretion for Magnetically Arrested And Rocking Accretion Disks

 - **Abstract**
 Accretion onto supermassive black holes (BHs) can launch relativistic jets that inject energy and momentum into their surroundings. Understanding how such feedback shapes large-scale accretion is key to bridging observations from galactic scales (e.g., the Bondi radius, $r_{\rm B}$) down to event horizon scales ($r_{\rm g}$), spanning 5-6 orders of magnitude. We tackle this challenge by varying the spatial scale separation across 2-4 orders of magnitude and performing some of the longest contiguous 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations to date ($t \lesssim 4\times10^6 r_{\rm g}/c$), of Bondi-like accretion of rotating, non-relativistic gas with weak vertical magnetic fields onto a rapidly spinning BH, achieving inflow equilibrium out to $r \gtrsim 10^3 r_{\rm g}$. We find that, regardless of scale separation or ambient gas rotation, all simulations reach a magnetically arrested disk (MAD) state where the BH becomes magnetically saturated. In this state, the mass inflow rate follows a universal radial scaling: $\dot{M}_{\rm in}(r) \sim r^s$ with $s = 0.66 \pm 0.03$. The MAD state self-regulates through jets, outflows, and magnetic flux eruptions that can disrupt coherent angular momentum inflow, giving rise to a rocking accretion disk (RAD) state. This RAD state features chaotically oriented inflows, weak intermittent jets, and a steeper inflow slope of $s = 0.87 \pm 0.05$. The MAD and RAD BH accretion rates become comparable at typical scale separations, $r_{\rm B}/ r_{\rm g} \gtrsim 10^5$. Weaker RAD outflows allow large-scale inflows to resume, restoring the MAD state and enabling a recurring MAD-RAD cycle. These cycles can last tens of Bondi timescales, $t_{\rm B} \sim 0.2\,\text{Myr} \times (r_{\rm B}/10^{5} r_{\rm g})^{3/2} \times (M_{\rm BH}/10^9M_\odot)$, potentially setting the duty cycle of jetted AGN outbursts, such as in M87*.

 - **Abstract**
 Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) consist of a central supermassive black hole (SMBH) embedded in a region with both high gas and stellar densities: the gas is present as a thin accretion disc that fuels the central SMBH, while the stars form a dense, roughly isotropic nuclear star cluster. The binaries present in such a cluster could be considered naturally as triples, with the SMBH as a third object, and their dynamics also depend on the interaction with the gas-rich disc. In this paper, we study the evolution of such a binary on an inclined orbit with respect to the disc. The binary experiences both eccentricity excitation via the von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) effect and drag forces from each time it penetrates the disc. We find that, as the outer orbital inclination decreases, the evolution of inner orbital separation can transition from a regime of gradual hardening to a regime of rapid softening. As such binaries grow wider, their minimum pericentre distances (during ZLK oscillations) decrease. We show that a simple geometric condition, modulated by the complex ZLK evolution, dictates whether a binary expands or contracts due to the interactions with the AGN disc. Our results suggest that the interaction with gas-rich accretion disc could enhance the rate of stellar mergers and formation of gravitational wave sources, as well as other transients. The treatment introduced here is general and could apply, with the proper modifications, to hierarchical triples in other gas-rich systems.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the evolution of black holes on orbits with small inclinations ($i < 2^\circ$) to the gaseous discs of active galactic nuclei. We perform 3D adiabatic hydrodynamic simulations within a shearing frame, studying the damping of inclination by black hole-gas gravitation. We find that for objects with $i<3H_0R_0^{-1}$, where $H_0R_0^{-1}$ is the disc aspect ratio, the inclination lost per midplane crossing is proportional to the inclination preceding the crossing, resulting in a net exponential decay in inclination. For objects with $i>3H_0R_0^{-1}$, damping efficiency decreases for higher inclinations. We consider a variety of different AGN environments, finding that damping is stronger for systems with a higher ambient Hill mass: the initial gas mass within the BH sphere-of-influence. We provide a fitting formula for the inclination changes as a function of Hill mass. We find reasonable agreement between the damping driven by gas gravity in the simulations and the damping driven by accretion under a Hill-limited Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton prescription. We find that gas dynamical friction consistently overestimates the strength of damping, especially for lower inclination systems, by at least an order of magnitude. For regions in the AGN disc where coplanar binary black hole formation by gas dissipation is efficient, we find that the simulated damping timescales are especially short with $\tau_d < 10P_\mathrm{SMBH}$. We conclude that as the timescales for inclination damping are shorter than the expected interaction time between isolated black holes, the vast majority of binaries formed from gas capture should form from components with negligible inclination to the AGN disc.
#### Sodium and Potassium Linewidths as an Atmospheric Escape Diagnostic at Mercury

 - **Abstract**
 The spatial distribution and linewidth of Mercury's sodium and potassium exosphere were observed using a combination of long-slit and high-resolution point spectroscopy. Effective temperatures were estimated from emission line profiles by forward modeling their Doppler broadening. These serve as an energy metric for collisionless gas that is inherently nonthermal. The Na gas at low and mid-latitudes ranges from 1200-1300 K along the noon meridian, in agreement with MESSENGER scale heights, increasing by ~200 K at the poles and terminator. This increase is attributed to the loss of low energy atoms to the surface during photon-driven transport antisunward. An escaping potassium tail was measured for the first time, observed to a distance of 10.4 RM with Na/K ~95 at 5.8 RM. Emission linewidths increase sharply between the dayside and escaping tail, with Na growing from about 1200 to 7500 K, and K from 750 to 8500 K by the time the gas reaches 4.3 RM downtail. Na D line profiles down the exotail also evolve from Gaussian to boxcar in shape. Both characteristics are interpreted as filtering of the nascent velocity distribution function, wherein low energy atoms on gravitationally bound trajectories are removed from the gas population, while high energy escaping atoms are retained. Na linewidths become invariant past 3.5 RM, placing this altitude as the ballistic apex of bound trajectories. In this way, Mercury's emissions prototype a novel technique towards a broader understanding of atmospheric escape, using emission line morphology to probe the transition between bound and escaping gas.
#### Gone with the Wind: JWST-MIRI Unveils a Strong Outflow from the Quiescent Stellar-Mass Black Hole A0620-00

 - **Abstract**
 We present new observations of the black hole X-ray binary A0620-00 using the Mid-Infrared Instrument on the James Webb Space Telescope, during a state where the X-ray luminosity is 9 orders of magnitude below Eddington, and coordinated with radio, near-infrared and optical observations. The goal is to understand the nature of the excess mid-infrared (MIR) emission originally detected by Spitzer red-ward of 8 $\mu$m. The stellar-subtracted MIR spectrum is well-modeled by a power law with a spectral index of $\alpha=0.72\pm0.01$, where the flux density scales with frequency as $F_\nu \propto \nu^{\alpha}$. The spectral characteristics, along with rapid variability--a 40% flux flare at 15$\mu$m and 25% achromatic variability in the 5-12 $\mu$m range--rule out a circumbinary disk as the source of the MIR excess. The Low Resolution Spectrometer reveals a prominent emission feature at 7.5 $\mu$m, resulting from the blend of three hydrogen recombination lines. While the contribution from partially self-absorbed synchrotron radiation cannot be ruled out, we argue that thermal bremsstrahlung from a warm (a few $10^4$ K) wind accounts for the MIR excess; the same outflow is responsible for the emission lines. The inferred mass outflow rate indicates that the system's low luminosity is due to a substantial fraction of the mass supplied by the donor star being expelled through a wind rather than accreted onto the black hole.

 - **Abstract**
 Bars are considered an efficient mechanism for transporting gas toward the central regions of galaxies, potentially enhancing nuclear activity. However, the extent to which bars influence active galactic nuclei (AGNs), and whether their efficiency varies with environment, remain open questions. In this study, we aim to quantify the role of bars in triggering AGNs by comparing the AGN fraction in barred and non-barred galaxies across different environments. We constructed a sample from the Galaxy Zoo DECaLS catalog, ensuring a control selection where both samples share similar distributions in stellar mass, redshift, magnitude, concentration index, and local density parameter. AGNs were identified using spectroscopic data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, yielding 1330 barred AGNs and 1651 unbarred AGNs. We use the [OIII]5007 luminosity (Lum[OIII]) and the accretion rate parameter R as indicators of nuclear activity. Based on these, we applied criteria to distinguish powerful from weak AGNs, allowing a more precise assessment of the bar's impact on the supermassive black hole. Our analysis reveals that barred galaxies tend to host a higher fraction of powerful AGNs. From Lum[OIII], we find that more active nuclei reside in massive, blue galaxies with young stellar populations. We also observe a slight tendency for barred galaxies to host less massive black holes accreting more efficiently. The classification of strong and weak bars shows that more prominent bars correlate with higher nuclear activity. While this trend shows no significant differences in intermediate-density environments, it becomes evident in both low- and high-density regions, where galaxies with strong bars show enhanced AGN activity.

 - **Abstract**
 Several models of nuclear dust in active galactic nuclei (AGN) have been presented in the literature to determine its physical and geometrical properties, usually assuming the dust density distribution as the main aspect producing differences in the mid-infrared (MIR) emission of AGNs. We present a study of the MIR emission of nearby AGNs by exploring the effects of dust distribution and chemical composition on the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) using radiative transfer simulations. Our model grid includes smooth, clumpy, and two-phase dust distributions, combined with two dust compositions: the interstellar medium (ISM) dust composition including large grains (up to $\rm{10 \ \mu m}$), and the oxide/silicate-based composition from Reyes-Amador et al. (2024). A synthetic SED library was generated and analysed both on a model-to-model basis and with observed MIR spectra from 68 AGNs. We found that dust density distribution and dust composition significantly influence the spectral shapes and silicate features at $10$ and $\rm{18 \ \mu m}$, especially at edge-on orientations. The smooth distribution produces stronger and broader silicate absorption features, while the clumpy distribution generates stronger features in emission. The two-phase distributions exhibit intermediate characteristics depending on the clumpiness fraction ($f_{\text{cl}}$) and filling factor ($f_{\text{fill}}$). The ISM dust composition with large grains is more suited to reproduce the observed features and a higher fraction of good fits, particularly with Type-2 SEDs, independently of dust density distributions. The Reyes-Amador et al. (2024) composition provides a larger number of good fits with Type-1 SEDs for $f_{\text{cl}} \leq 0.5$, and with Type-2 SEDs for $f_{\text{cl}} \geq 0.9$. This work shows that no single dust distribution or composition reproduces all observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Sunspots survive on the solar surface for time-scales ranging from days to months. This requires them to be in an equilibrium involving magnetic fields and hydrodynamic forces. Unfortunately, theoretical models of sunspot equilibrium are very simplified as they assume that spots are static and possess a self-similar and axially symmetric magnetic field. These assumptions neglect the role of small scale variations of the magnetic field along the azimuthal direction produced by umbral dots, light bridges, penumbral filaments, and so forth. We aim at studying whether sunspot equilibrium is maintained once azimuthal fluctuations in the magnetic field, produced by the sunspot fine structure, are taken into account. To this end we apply the FIRTEZ Stokes inversion code to spectropolarimetric observations to infer the magnetic and thermodynamic parameters in two sunspots located at disk center and observed with two different instruments: one observed from the ground with the 1.5-meter German GREGOR Telescope and another with the Japanese spacecraft Hinode. We compare our results with three dimensional radiative magnetohydrodynamic simulations of a sunspot carried out with the MuRAM code. We infer clear variations in the gas pressure and density of the plasma directly related to fluctuations in the Lorentz force and associated with the filamentary structure in the penumbra. Similar results are obtained in the umbra despite its lack of observed filamentary structure. Results from the two observed sunspots are in excellent qualitative and quantitative agreement with the numerical simulations. Our results indicate that the magnetic topology of sunspots along the azimuthal direction is very close to magnetohydrostatic equilibrium, thereby helping to explain why sunspots are such long-lived structures capable of surviving on the solar surface for days or even full solar rotations.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The radio emission from magnetars is poorly understood and poorly characterized observationally, in particular for what concerns single pulses and sporadic events. The interest in it was boosted by the detection in 2020 of an extremely bright ms radio signal from the Galactic magnetar designated Soft Gamma Repeater (SGR) SGR J1935+2154, which occurred almost simultaneously with a typical magnetar short burst of X-rays. As of now, this event remains the Galactic radio pulse that is the most reminiscent of fast radio bursts (FRBs) and the only one with a sound association with a known progenitor. Aims. We aim to constrain the rate of impulsive radio events from magnetars, by means of an intensive monitoring using a high-sensitivity radio telescope. Methods. We performed a long-term campaign on seven Galactic magnetars (plus one candidate) using the Northern Cross transit radio telescope (in Medicina, Italy) searching for short timescales and dispersed radio pulses. Results. We obtained no detections in more than 560 hours of observation, setting an upper limit at 95% confidence level of <52 yr$^{-1}$ on the rate of events with energy >10$^{28}$ erg, which is consistent with limits in literature. Furthermore, under some assumptions on the magnetars properties and energetic behavior, we found that our upper limits point towards the fact that the entire population of FRBs observed cannot be explained by radio bursts emitted by magnetars.
#### Collimation of Fast Radio Burster 20201124A; Repeaters vs. Apparent Non-Repeaters

 - **Abstract**
 The recent report of a period in the active repeating Fast Radio Burster 20201124A and measurement of its spindown rate place bounds on the solid angle of its emission on the basis of energetics. The bound depends on the (unknown) efficiency of conversion of rotational energy to coherent radio emission and implies a lower bound on the Lorentz factor of the radiating charges. Bursts may be emitted along the magnetic dipole axis, in repeaters aligned with the rotational axis and the line of sight but misaligned in apparent non-repeaters. This may explain the difficulty of finding periodicity in repeaters and the low duty cycle of apparent non-repeaters.
#### A Criterion for Magnetars Producing Giant Flares

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, the straight flux rope in the model of giant flares on magnetars (Meng et al. 2014) was replaced with a curved one and the equilibrium behavior of the flux rope was investigated. Two footpoints of the flux rope are anchored to the spherical surface of magnetar. The forces acting on the flux rope include magnetic tension, magnetic pressure, curvature force, gravity. The equilibrium in the flux rope, so as in the global configuration, is achieved as these forces offset each other. Changes in the background environment drive the configuration to evolve through a set of equilibria in a quasi-static fashion until the critical point is reached and the loss of equilibrium in the configuration occurs, invoking a giant flare. We establish a criterion to identify magnetars capable of producing giant flares. Among the four forces, the curvature force as well as the magnetic compression tend to expel the flue rope outward. In a given magnetic configuration, the curvature force and magnetic compression are proportional to the square of the current intensity of the flux rope, which is determined by the frozen-flux condition and background magnetic field strength. We find that only when $\eta = G M m / ({{{R^4}{B_0}^2}})< 0.48 $ is satisfied, the system reaches a critical point and potentially undergoes catastrophe. Here, $G, M, m, R$, and $B_{0}$ are the gravitational constant, the mass of neutron star, the mass of flux rope, the radius of neutron star, and the surface magnetic field strength of neutron star, respectively. The physical meaning of this criterion is that when $\eta \propto m / B_{0}^{2}$ is small enough, the curvature force and magnetic pressure can be sufficiently large to overcome gravitational confinement. This criterion establishes a basis for identifying magnetars capable of producing giant flares.

 - **Abstract**
 Together optical/near infrared integral field spectroscopy and resolved sub-millimetre interferometry data have mapped the ionised and molecular gas motions in nearly one thousand galaxies at redshifts $z>0.5$. While these measurements have revealed a number of key properties about the evolution of disc structure and kinematics, heterogenous techniques and samples have led to disparate findings - especially when comparing different dynamical tracers (e.g., H$\alpha$, [C$\scriptstyle\rm~II$], CO). In this paper we present a literature compilation of 237 disc galaxies with measurements of velocity dispersion and rotational velocity between $z=0.5-8$, a subset of 63 galaxies have measurements of molecular gas fractions. We explore the connection between disc velocity dispersion measurements over 8 Gyrs as traced by multiple phases with the expectations from Toomre stability models. When sample properties are taken into account (e.g., stellar mass, tracer) there is little evolution in disc dispersions between $z\sim1.5-8$, consistent with expectations from model assumptions. We find ionised gas dispersions are higher by $\sim2\times$ from molecular gas dispersions at a fixed gas mass. These results are sensitive to the molecular gas tracer with results from [C$\scriptstyle\rm~II$] showing mixed behaviour indicative of its multi-phase origin. The [C$\scriptstyle\rm~II$] kinematics can be reconciled with molecular and ionised gas tracers when star-formation rates are taken into account.
#### The incidence of magnetic cataclysmic variables can be explained by the late appearance of white dwarf magnetic fields

 - **Abstract**
 Assuming that white dwarf (WD) magnetic fields are generated by a crystallization- and rotation-driven dynamo, the impact of the late appearance of WD magnetic fields in cataclysmic variables (CVs) has been shown to potentially solve several long-standing problems of CV evolution. However, recent theoretical works show that the dynamo idea might not be viable and that the late appearance of WD magnetic fields might be an age effect rather than related to the cooling of the core of the WD. We investigated the impact of the late appearance of WD magnetic fields on CV evolution assuming that the fields appear at fixed WD ages. We performed CV population synthesis with the BSE code to determine the fractions of CVs that become magnetic atcdifferent evolutionary stages. These simulations were complemented with MESA tracks that take into account the transfer of spin angular momentum to the orbit which can cause a detached phase. We find that the observed fraction of magnetic CVs as a function of orbital period is well reproduced by our simulations, and that in many CVs the WD should become magnetic close to the period minimum. The detached phase generated by the transfer of spin angular momentum is longest for period bouncers. Interpreting the late appearance of strong WD magnetic fields as a simple age effect naturally explains the relative numbers of magnetic CVs in observed samples. As many period bouncers might detach for several gigayears, the late appearance of WD magnetic fields at a fixed age and independent of the core temperature of the WD can significantly reduce the predicted number of accreting period bouncers.

 - **Abstract**
 Emission Line Galaxies (ELGs) are crucial for cosmological studies, particularly in understanding the large-scale structure of the Universe and the role of dark energy. ELGs form an essential component of the target catalogue for the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), a major astronomical survey. However, the accurate selection of ELGs for such surveys is challenging due to the inherent uncertainties in determining their redshifts with photometric data. In order to improve the accuracy of photometric redshift estimation for ELGs, we propose a novel approach CNN-MLP that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs). This approach integrates both images and photometric data derived from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys Data Release 10. By leveraging the complementary strengths of CNNs (for image data processing) and MLPs (for photometric feature integration), the CNN-MLP model achieves a $\sigma_{\mathrm{NMAD}}$ (normalised median absolute deviation) of 0.0140 and an outlier fraction of 2.57%. Compared to other models, CNN-MLP demonstrates a significant improvement in the accuracy of ELG photometric redshift estimation, which directly benefits the target selection process for DESI. In addition, we explore the photometric redshifts of different galaxy types (Starforming, Starburst, AGN, Broadline). Furthermore, this approach will contribute to more reliable photometric redshift estimation in ongoing and future large-scale sky surveys (e.g. LSST, CSST, Euclid), enhancing the overall efficiency of cosmological research and galaxy surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a decade-long investigation of a poorly studied cluster, Berkeley 65 (Be 65), using deep optical data from the telescopes of ARIES, Nainital Observatory. We estimate its radius ($R_{cluster}$ = 1.6$^{'}$, aspect ratio of $\sim$1.1), distance (2.0 $\pm$ 0.1 kpc) and age ($\sim$160 Myrs). A clear turn-off point at $\sim$1.7 M$_\odot$ in the mass function suggests the escape of low-mass stars, and the lower photometric mass compared to the dynamical mass indicates ongoing disruption due to external forces. Our long-baseline optical photometric data also identifies 64 periodic and 16 non-periodic stars in this region. We have presented the light curves and the classification of those variables. The periodic stars have periods ranging from $\sim$0.05 days to $\sim$3.00 days and amplitude ranges from $\sim$8 mmag to $\sim$700 mmag. The nonperiodic stars show variation from $\sim$30 mmag to $\sim$500 mmag. The periodic stars include main-sequence pulsating variables such as Slow Pulsating B-type, $\delta$ Scuti, RR Lyrae, and $\gamma$ Doradus. We report a detached binary system and rotating variables similar to BY Draconis-type stars exhibiting variable brightness caused by starspots, chromospheric activity, and magnetic field-related phenomena.
#### Inferring Obscured Cosmic Black Hole Accretion History from AGN Found by JWST/MIRI CEERS Survey

 - **Abstract**
 This study presents the black hole accretion history (BHAH) of obscured active galactic nuclei (AGNs) identified from the JWST CEERS survey by Chien et al. (2024) using mid-infrared (MIR) SED fitting. We compute black hole accretion rates (BHARs) to estimate the black hole accretion density (BHAD), $\rho_{L_{\mathrm{disk}}}$, across $0 < z < 4.25$. MIR luminosity functions (LFs) are also constructed for these sources, modeled with modified Schechter and double power law forms, and corresponding BHAD, $\rho_{\mathrm{LF}}$, is derived by integrating the LFs and multiplying by the luminosity. Both $\rho_{\mathrm{LF}}$ extend to luminosities as low as $10^7 \, L_{\odot}$, two orders of magnitude fainter than pre-JWST studies. Our results show that BHAD peaks between redshifts 1 and 3, with the peak varying by method and model, $z \approx 1$--2 for $\rho_{L_{\mathrm{disk}}}$ and the double power law, and $z \approx 2$--3 for the modified Schechter function. A scenario where AGN activity peaks before cosmic star formation would challenge existing black hole formation theories, but our present study, based on early JWST observations, provides an initial exploration of this possibility. At $z \sim 3$, $\rho_{\mathrm{LF}}$ appears higher than X-ray estimates, suggesting that MIR observations are more effective in detecting obscured AGNs missed by X-ray observations. However, given the overlapping error bars, this difference remains within the uncertainties and requires confirmation with larger samples. These findings highlight the potential of JWST surveys to enhance the understanding of co-evolution between galaxies and AGNs.

 - **Abstract**
 Oscillatory magnetic reconnection is a periodic magnetic reconnection process, during which the current sheet's orientation and the magnetic connections change periodically. This periodic variation is generally considered to originate from the magnetic reconnection itself rather than from external driving processes. We conduct 2.5-dimensional radiative magnetohydrodynamic simulations to investigate the emergence of a magnetic flux tube from the convection zone into the lower corona, where the emerging magnetic fields reconnect with background ones. During the reconnection process within 5771 s, the current sheet's orientation has been reversed 41 times, corresponding to 40 oscillation periods. Notably, the longest period is 30 minutes, which is consistent with the previous observational results. We find that the main factor leading to the reversal of the current sheet's orientation is the quasi-periodic external force provided by the emergence of plasma and magnetic fields from the convection zone. We also find the shifting of the upward outflows from the reconnection region along the horizontal direction due to the alternating changes of the reconnection inflow and outflow regions. In addition to the quasi-periodic change of the current sheet orientation, the reconnection rate at the main X-point also oscillates with a period between 100-400 s, which corresponds to the period of p-mode oscillations.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the strong gravitational lensing properties of fuzzy dark matter (FDM) halos, focusing on the magnification properties near radial critical curves (CCs). Using simulated lenses we compute magnification maps for a range of axion masses and halo configurations. We show that FDM produces enhanced central magnification and secondary CCs that are not easily reproduced by standard cold dark matter (CDM), even when including subhalos. The strength and scale of these effects depend primarily on the de~Broglie wavelength, governed by the axion and halo masses. We find that axion masses in the range $m_\psi \sim 10^{-22}$--$10^{-21}\,\mathrm{eV}$ in galaxy-mass halos lead to distinctive magnification distributions. Our results suggest that observations of highly magnified, compact sources near radial arcs, such as quasars or supernovae, could serve as a powerful test for the presence of FDM.

 - **Abstract**
 The multi-messenger science using different observational windows to the Universe such as Gravitational Waves (GWs), Electromagnetic Waves (EMs), Cosmic Rays (CRs), and Neutrinos offer an opportunity to study from the scale of a neutron star to cosmological scales over a large cosmic time. At the smallest scales, we can explore the structure of the neutron star and the different energetics involved in the transition of a pre-merger neutron star to a post-merger neutron star. This will open up a window to study the properties of matter in extreme conditions and a guaranteed discovery space. On the other hand, at the largest cosmological scales, multi-messenger observations allow us to study the long-standing problems in physical cosmology related to the Hubble constant, dark matter, and dark energy by mapping the expansion history of the Universe using GW sources. Moreover, the multi-messenger studies of astrophysical systems such as white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes of different masses, all the way up to a high redshift Universe, will bring insightful understanding into the physical processes associated with them that are inaccessible otherwise. This white paper discusses the key cases in the domain of multi-messenger astronomy and the role of observatories in India which can explore uncharted territories and open discovery spaces in different branches of physics ranging from nuclear physics to astrophysics.
#### Chemical tagging of tidal tail star candidates of NGC 6362

 - **Abstract**
 The inner Milky Way disk globular cluster NGC~6362 appears to exhibit tidal tails composed of stars that have proper motions and positions in the color-magnitude diagram similar to those of cluster stars. Because recent results seem also to show that these stars are distributed across the regions least affected by interstellar absorption and reproduce the observed composite star field density map, we carried out a detailed spectroscopic analysis of a number of chemical element abundances of tidal tail star candidates in order to investigate the relationship of them with NGC~6362. From European Southern Observatory's VLT@FLAMES spectra we found that the red giant branch stars selected as cluster's tidal tail stars do not have overall metallicities nor abundances of Mg, Ca, Sc, Ti, Cr, Ni and Ba similar to the cluster's ones. Moreover, they are mainly alike to stars that belong to the Milky Way thick disk, some of them could be part of the thin disk and a minor percentage could belong to the Milky Way halo star population. On the other hand, since the resulting radial velocities do not exhibit a distribution function similar to that of cluster's stars, we concluded that looking for kinematic properties similar to those of the cluster would not seem to be an approach for selecting cluster's tidal tail stars as suitable as previously thought.
