 - **Abstract**
 Recent JWST observations of massive galaxies at z > 2 have detected blueshifted absorption in Na I D and other resonant absorption lines, indicative of strong gas outflows in the neutral phase. However, the measured mass outflow rates are highly uncertain because JWST observations can only probe the column density of trace elements such as sodium, while most of the gas is in the form of hydrogen. The conversion between the column density of sodium and that of hydrogen is based on observations of gas clouds within the Milky Way, and has not been directly tested for massive galaxies at high redshift. In order to test this conversion, we study a unique system consisting of a massive quiescent galaxy (J1439B) at z = 2.4189 located at a projected distance of 38 physical kpc from the bright background quasar QSO J1439. The neutral outflow from the galaxy is observed as a sub-damped Lyman-alpha absorber in the spectrum of the background quasar, which enables a direct measurement of the hydrogen column density from Lyman transitions. We obtain new near-infrared spectroscopy with Magellan/FIRE and detect Na I D and other resonant absorption lines from Mg II, Mg I, and Fe II. We are thus able to derive new, empirical calibrations between the column density of trace elements and the hydrogen column density, that can be used to estimate the mass and the rate of neutral gas outflows in other massive quiescent galaxies at high redshift. The calibration we derive for Na I is only 30% lower than the local relation that is typically assumed at high redshift, confirming that the neutral outflows observed with JWST at z > 2 are able to remove a large amount of gas and are thus likely to play a key role in galaxy quenching. However, using the local calibration for Mg II yields an order-of-magnitude discrepancy compared to the empirical calibration, possibly because of variations in the dust depletion.

 - **Abstract**
 The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have identified a class of compact galaxies at high redshifts ($4 \lesssim z \lesssim 11$), dubbed "little red dots" (LRDs). The supermassive black holes (SMBHs) of $10^{5-8}{\rm\,M}_{\odot}$ in LRDs favor a heavy-seed origin. We propose a mechanism for their formation: Clusters of primordial black holes, formed through long-short mode coupling on small scales in the early Universe, undergo sequential mergers over extended timescales. This mechanism can evade cosmic microwave background distortions and result in heavy-seed SMBHs via runaway mergers. We employ Monte Carlo simulations to solve the Smoluchowski coagulation equation and determine the runaway merging timescale. The resulting stochastic gravitational wave background offers a distinct signature of this process, and the forming SMBHs can be highly spinning at their formation due to the spin residual of the cluster from tidal fields. This mechanism may explain the rapidly spinning SMBHs in LRDs under the assumption of obscured active galactic nuclei.

 - **Abstract**
 We search a sample of 5,685,060 isolated sources in the All Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN) with 14.5<g<15 mag for slowly varying sources with brightness changes larger than ~0.03 mag/year over 10 years. We find 426 slowly-varying systems. Of these systems, 200 are identified as variables for the first time, 226 are previously classified as variables, and we find equal numbers of sources becoming brighter and fainter. Previously classified systems were mostly identified as semi-regular variables (SR), slow irregular variables (L), or unknown (MISC or VAR), as long time scale variability does not fit into a standard class. Much like Petz & Kochanek 2025, the sources are scattered across the color magnitude diagram and can be placed into 5 groups that exhibit distinct behaviors. There are also six AGN. There are 262 candidates (~62 percent) that also show shorter time scale periodic variability, mostly with periods longer than 10 days. The variability of 66 of these candidates may be related to dust. Combining the new slow variable candidates with the candidates from Petz & Kochanek 2025, we have found a total of 1206 slow variables.

 - **Abstract**
 We present GokuNEmu, a ten-dimensional neural network emulator for the nonlinear matter power spectrum, designed to support next-generation cosmological analyses. Built on the Goku $N$-body simulation suite and the T2N-MusE emulation framework, GokuNEmu predicts the matter power spectrum with $\sim 0.5 \%$ average accuracy for redshifts $0 \leq z \leq 3$ and scales $0.006 \leq k/(h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}) \leq 10$. The emulator models a 10D parameter space that extends beyond $\Lambda$CDM to include dynamical dark energy (characterized by $w_0$ and $w_a$), massive neutrinos ($\sum m_\nu$), the effective number of neutrinos ($N_\text{eff}$), and running of the spectral index ($\alpha_\text{s}$). Its broad parameter coverage, particularly for the extensions, makes it the only matter power spectrum emulator capable of testing recent dynamical dark energy constraints from DESI. In addition, it requires only $\sim $2 milliseconds to predict a single cosmology on a laptop, orders of magnitude faster than existing emulators. These features make GokuNEmu a uniquely powerful tool for interpreting observational data from upcoming surveys such as LSST, Euclid, the Roman Space Telescope, and CSST.

 - **Abstract**
 The physical origin of Little Red Dots (LRDs)--compact extragalactic sources with red rest-optical continua and broad Balmer lines--remains elusive. The redness of LRDs is likely intrinsic, suggesting optically thick gas emitting at a characteristic effective temperature of $\sim5000{\rm~K}$. Meanwhile, many LRD spectra exhibit a Balmer break, often attributed to absorption by a dense gas shell surrounding an AGN. Using semi-analytical atmosphere models and radiation transport calculations, we show that a super-Eddington accretion system can give rise to a Balmer break and a red optical color simultaneously, without invoking external gas absorption for the break or dust reddening. The break originates from a discontinuity in opacity across the Balmer limit, similar to that of early-type stars, but the lower photosphere density of super-Eddington systems, $\rho<10^{-9}{\rm~g~cm^{-3}}$, implies a significant opacity contrast even at a cool photosphere temperature of $\sim5000{\rm~K}$. Furthermore, while accretion in the form of a standard thin disk requires fine tuning to match the optical color of LRDs, an alternative scenario of a geometrically thick, roughly spherical accretion flow implies an effective temperature $4000{\rm~K}\lesssim T_{\rm eff}\lesssim6000{\rm~K}$ that is very insensitive to the accretion rate (analogous to the Hayashi line in stellar models). The continuum spectra from the latter scenario align with the Balmer break and optical color of currently known LRDs. We discuss predictions of our model and the prospects for more realistic spectra based on super-Eddington accretion simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observational results from the DESI collaboration reveal tensions with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model and favor a scenario in which dark energy (DE) decays over time. The DESI DR2 data also suggest that the DE equation of state (EoS) may have been phantom-like ($w < - 1$) in the past, evolving to $w > - 1$ at present, implying a recent crossing of the phantom divide at $w = - 1$. Scalar field models of DE naturally emerge in ultraviolet-complete theories such as string theory, which is typically formulated in higher dimensions. In this work, we investigate a class of thawing scalar field models propagating on a (4+1)-dimensional phantom braneworld, and demonstrate that their effective EoS exhibits a phantom-divide crossing. Alongside the Hubble parameter and EoS of DE, we also analyse the evolution of the Om diagnostic, and demonstrate that the time dependence of these quantities is in excellent agreement with the DESI DR2 observations. Furthermore, we perform a comprehensive parameter estimation using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, and find that the $\chi^2$ values for all our models are remarkably close to that of the widely used CPL parametrisation, indicating that our models fit the data very well.

 - **Abstract**
 The polarization of starlight and thermal dust emission from aligned non-spherical grains provides a powerful tool for tracing magnetic field morphologies and strengths in diffuse interstellar medium to star-forming regions, and constraining dust grain properties and their alignment mechanisms. However, the physics of grain alignment is not yet fully understood. The alignment based on RAdiative Torques (RATs), known as RAT Alignment or RAT-A mechanism is the most acceptable mechanism. In this work, we investigate the grain alignment mechanisms in F13 (F13N and F13C) and F13S filamentary regions of the Cocoon Nebula (IC 5146) using polarized thermal dust emission observations from JCMT/POL-2 at 850 $\mu$m. We find that the polarization fraction decreases with increasing total intensity and gas column density in each region, termed as polarization hole. We investigate for any role of magnetic field tangling on the observed polarization hole by estimating the polarization angle dispersion function. Our study finds that the polarization hole is not significantly influenced by magnetic field tangling, but majorly due to decrease in RAT alignment efficiency of grains in denser regions. To test whether RAT-A mechanism can reproduce the observational results, we estimate minimum alignment size of grains using RAT theory. Our study finds strong evidence for RAT-A mechanism that can explain the polarization hole. We also find potential hints that the observed higher polarization fractions in some regions of F13 filament can be due to combined effects of both suprathermal rotation by RATs and enhanced magnetic relaxation, supporting the Magnetically-Enhanced RAT (M-RAT) mechanism.

 - **Abstract**
 The blazar Markarian 501 (Mrk 501) was observed on three occasions over a 4-month period between 2022 March and 2022 July with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). In this paper, we report for the first time on the third IXPE observation, performed between 2022 July 9 and 12, during which IXPE detected a linear polarization degree of $\Pi_X=6\pm2$ per cent at a polarization angle, measured east of north, of $\Psi_X=143^\circ\pm11^\circ$ within the 2-8 keV X-ray band. The X-ray polarization angle and degree during this observation are consistent with those obtained during the first two observations. The chromaticity of the polarization across radio, optical, and X-ray bands is likewise consistent with the result from the simultaneous campaigns during the first two observations. Furthermore, we present two types of models to explain the observed spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and energy-resolved polarization: a synchrotron self-Compton model with an anisotropic magnetic field probability distribution in the emitting volume, as well as an energy-stratified shock model. Our results support both the shock scenario as well as support that small levels of magnetic field anisotropy can explain the observed polarization.

 - **Abstract**
 The NASA Great Observatories Maturation Program is a development plan to efficiently and effectively develop large, strategic astrophysics missions. Suborbital rocket and balloon programs have long been a key development tool for enabling large missions in NASA astrophysics. We review the significance of these suborbital missions in the preceding decades to demonstrate their contributions to the Great Observatories Maturation Program for the Habitable Worlds Observatory and beyond. We show that suborbital instruments have obtained new science observations of astrophysical sources across the electromagnetic spectrum, matured high-priority component technologies, and served as a training ground for principal investigators of Explorer-class astrophysics satellites. A brief discussion of emerging CubeSat and SmallSat missions and their place in the NASA astrophysics portfolio is also provided.

 - **Abstract**
 We present initial results from a planned 10 year survey of Ca II H & K emission, using observations made with the ARC 3.5m Telescope at Apache Point Observatory. The primary goal of the survey is to investigate activity cycles in low mass stars. The sample includes stars chosen from the legacy Mount Wilson survey carried out by Olin Wilson more than 50 years ago, together with newly identified planet-host stars and a select sample of early-mid M dwarfs. This paper presents the first four years of data, comprising 1040 observations of 271 stars, with a specific focus on K and M stars. We identify a subsample of 153 stars for continuing observations over the full 10 year survey. Early results indicate that our data are consistent with the MWO cycle periods over a time span of more than 50 years; that there is a bifurcation in activity in the late K range with separate populations of low and high activity stars at lower masses; and that M dwarf planet hosts tend to be mainly found in the population of low activity stars, even in the unbiased (by activity) TESS sample, potentially indicating a link between activity and planet formation. We have also found indications of possible cyclic variability in some of the lower mass stars in the sample. Our ultimate goal is to link the activity cycle and rotation periods in a robust sample of stars spanning FGKM spectral types and to investigate the implications for the underlying magnetic dynamo.
#### AT2019cmw: A highly luminous, cooling featureless TDE candidate from the disruption of a high mass star in an early-type galaxy

 - **Abstract**
 We present optical/UV photometric and spectroscopic observations, as well as X-ray and radio follow-up, of the extraordinary event AT2019cmw. With a peak bolometric luminosity of ~$\mathrm{10^{45.6}\,erg\,s^{-1}}$, it is one of the most luminous thermal transients ever discovered. Extensive spectroscopic follow-up post-peak showed only a featureless continuum throughout its evolution. This, combined with its nuclear location, blue colour at peak and lack of prior evidence of an AGN in its host lead us to interpret this event as a `featureless' tidal disruption event (TDE). It displays photometric evolution atypical of most TDEs, cooling from ~30 kK to ~10 kK in the first ~300 days post-peak, with potential implications for future photometric selection of candidate TDEs. No X-ray or radio emission is detected, placing constraints on the presence of on-axis jetted emission or a visible inner-accretion disk. Modelling the optical light curve with existing theoretical prescriptions, we find that AT2019cmw may be the result of the disruption of a star in the tens of solar masses by a supermassive black hole (SMBH). Combined with a lack of detectable star formation in its host galaxy, it could imply the existence of a localised region of star formation around the SMBH. This could provide a new window to probe nuclear star formation and the shape of the initial mass function (IMF) in close proximity to SMBHs out to relatively high redshifts.
#### Imaging-Spectroscopic diagnosis of the Giant Sloshing Spiral in the Virgo Cluster with the Einstein Probe Follow-up X-ray Telescope

 - **Abstract**
 We performed deep X-ray observations of the Virgo cluster using the Einstein Probe Follow-up X-ray Telescope (EP-FXT) with a total exposure of 295 ks. Leveraging the large field of view (FoV) and low particle background of EP-FXT, the image reveals a giant spiral feature connecting the cold fronts in the northwest and southeast, forming a coherent structure consistent with earlier results from XMM-Newton and Suzaku. We also present two-dimensional maps of temperature, metallicity, and entropy across the Virgo Cluster, covering a FoV of approximately 28.5 arcmin. These maps clearly show a spiral structure with high density, low temperature, high metallicity, and low entropy. The results support a scenario where the spiral morphology arises from gas sloshing driven by a minor merger. Additionally, EP-FXT temperature measurements agree well with XMM-Newton data within uncertainties.

 - **Abstract**
 The ring structures of disk galaxies are vital for understanding galaxy evolution and dynamics. However, due to the scarcity of ringed galaxies and challenges in their identification, traditional methods often struggle to efficiently obtain statistically significant samples. To address this, this study employs a novel semi-supervised deep learning model, GC-SWGAN, aimed at identifying galaxy rings from high-resolution images of the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys. We selected over 5,000 confirmed ringed galaxies from the Catalog of Southern Ringed Galaxies (CSRG) and the Northern Ringed Galaxies from the GZ2 catalog (GZ2-CNRG), both verified by morphology expert R. J. Buta, to create an annotated training set. Additionally, we incorporated strictly selected non-ringed galaxy samples from the Galaxy Zoo 2 dataset and utilized unlabelled data from DESI Legacy Surveys to train our model. Through semi-supervised learning, the model significantly reduced reliance on extensive annotated data while enhancing robustness and generalization. On the test set, it demonstrated exceptional performance in identifying ringed galaxies. With a probability threshold of 0.5, the classification accuracy reached 97\%, with precision and recall for ringed galaxies at 94\% and 93\%, respectively. Building on these results, we predicted 750,000 galaxy images from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys with r-band apparent magnitudes less than 17.0 and redshifts in the range 0.0005 < z < 0.25, compiling the largest catalog of ringed galaxies to date, containing 62,962 galaxies with ring structures. This catalog provides essential data for subsequent research on the formation mechanisms and evolutionary history of galaxy rings.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetars are likely to be the origin of all fast radio bursts. The recent detection of circularly polarized bursts suggests that they might be generated deep inside magnetar magnetospheres. However, the mechanism behind the circular polarization remains uncertain. Here, we study the propagation of an intense radio pulse in a longitudinally magnetized electron-dominant plasma by particle-in-cell simulations. When the field strength of the radio pulse exceeds the background magnetic field, it can excite a nonlinear plasma wakefield and continually erodes due to energy transfer to the wake. Along the magnetic field, the plasma wakefield launched by the right-circularly polarized pulse is much stronger and more nonlinear than that by the left-circularly polarized pulse. Hence, the erosion rates of the two circularly polarized modes are significantly different. We discover that this asymmetric erosion can generate circularly polarized modes from a linearly polarized pulse at relativistic intensities, even when the cyclotron frequency is much higher than the radio frequency. Finally, we present a proof-of-principle simulation to demonstrate the generation of circularly polarization by this magneto-induced asymmetric erosion in the nonuniform environment of magnetar magnetospheres.

 - **Abstract**
 In this article, we have presented non-relativistic boundary conditions across a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) shock front propagating in van der Waals gases. The expression for the strength of the non-relativistic MHD shock wave has been obtained, and the Rankine-Hugoniot (R-H) shock jump relations, or boundary conditions, for the pressure, the density, and the particle velocity across an MHD shock front have been derived in terms of a shock compression ratio. The simplified forms of shock jump relations have been written simultaneously for the weak and strong MHD shock waves in terms of the magnetic field strength, the non-idealness parameter, and the ratio of specific heats of the gas. Further, the case of weak shocks has been explored under two distinct conditions, viz., (i) when the applied magnetic field is weak and (ii) when the field is strong, respectively. The case of strong shocks has also been investigated under two distinct ways: (i) as in the purely non-magnetic case, when the ratio of densities on either side of the shock nearly equals $(\gamma+1)/(\gamma-1)$ or (ii) when the applied magnetic field is large. This is when the ambient magnetic pressure is large as compared with the ambient gas pressure. Finally, the effects on the shock strength and the pressure across the MHD shock front are studied due to the magnetic field strength and the non-idealness parameter of the gases. This study presents an overview of the influence of the magnetic field strength and the non-idealness parameter on the shock strength, the pressure, the density, and the particle velocity across the MHD shock front in van der Waals gases.
#### The Impact of Natal Kicks on Black Hole Binaries

 - **Abstract**
 In massive binary-star systems, supernova explosions can significantly alter the orbit during the formation of compact objects. Some compact objects are predicted to form via direct collapse, a scenario with negligible mass loss and no baryonic ejecta emitted. In this scenario, most of the energy is released via neutrinos, and any resulting natal kick arises from asymmetries in their emission. Here I investigate stellar collapse leading to binary black hole (BH) formation, with a focus on how the natal kick influences the gravitational-wave-driven merger time. Broadly, I find three regimes. For low natal kicks, the effect on the time-to-coalescence is negligible. For moderate natal kicks, if the binary remains bound, up to 50% of binary BHs experience a decrease in their time-to-coalescence by more than an order of magnitude. For large natal kicks, although most binaries become unbound, those that remain bound may acquire retrograde orbits and/or lead to shorter time-to-coalescence. For binary BH mergers, large natal kicks ($\gtrsim100$ km/s) are hard to reconcile with both neutrino natal kicks and the complete collapse scenario. This suggests that retrograde orbits and shortened merger times could only arise in volatile BH formation scenarios or if spin-axis tossing is at work. Consequently, electromagnetic observations of BHs in massive star binaries within the Local Group offer a more effective means to probe the physics behind complete collapse. Another promising population for deciphering the complete collapse scenario is that of massive, wide binaries. Although Gaia may help shed light on these systems, longer observational baselines will likely be needed to fully understand the roles of neutrino natal kicks and stellar collapse in BH formation.

 The Euclid space telescope of the European Space Agency (ESA) is designed to provide sensitive and accurate measurements of weak gravitational lensing distortions over wide areas on the sky. Here we present a weak gravitational lensing analysis of early Euclid observations obtained for the field around the massive galaxy cluster Abell 2390 as part of the Euclid Early Release Observations programme. We conduct galaxy shape measurements using three independent algorithms (LensMC, KSB+, and SourceXtractor++). Incorporating multi-band photometry from Euclid and Subaru/Suprime-Cam, we estimate photometric redshifts to preferentially select background sources from tomographic redshift bins, for which we calibrate the redshift distributions using the self-organising map approach and data from the Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS). We quantify the residual cluster member contamination and correct for it in bins of photometric redshift and magnitude using their source density profiles, including corrections for source obscuration and magnification. We reconstruct the cluster mass distribution and jointly fit the tangential reduced shear profiles of the different tomographic bins with spherical Navarro--Frenk--White profile predictions to constrain the cluster mass, finding consistent results for the three shape catalogues and good agreement with earlier measurements. As an important validation test we compare these joint constraints to mass measurements obtained individually for the different tomographic bins, finding good consistency. More detailed constraints on the cluster properties are presented in a companion paper that additionally incorporates strong lensing measurements. Our analysis provides a first demonstration of the outstanding capabilities of Euclid for tomographic weak lensing measurements.
#### Minimal Roles of Solar Subsurface Meridional Flow in the distributed-shear Babcock-Leighton Dynamo

 - **Abstract**
 The subsurface meridional flow has long been recognized as a critical factor in driving the solar cycle. Specifically, the equatorward return flow in the tachocline is widely believed to be responsible for the formation of the sunspot butterfly diagram and determine the solar cycle period within the framework of flux transport dynamo (FTD) models. We aim to investigate whether the subsurface meridional flow also plays a significant role in the recently developed distributed-shear Babcock-Leighton (BL) dynamo model, which operates within the convection zone, rather than the tachocline. Various meridional flow configurations, including a deep single cell, a shallow single cell, and double cells, are applied in the distributed-shear BL dynamo model to explore the mechanisms driving the butterfly diagram and variations in the cycle period. Subsurface meridional flow plays a minimal role in the distributed-shear BL dynamo. A solar-like butterfly diagram can be generated even with a double-cell meridional flow. The diagram arises from the time- and latitude-dependent regeneration of the toroidal field, governed by latitude-dependent latitudinal differential rotation and the evolution of surface magnetic fields. The cycle period is determined by the surface flux source and transport process responsible for polar field generation, which corresponds to the $\alpha$-effect in the BL-type dynamo. The cycle period may exhibit varying dependence on the amplitude of the subsurface flow. The distributed-shear BL dynamo differs fundamentally from the FTD models, as it does not rely on the subsurface flux transport. This distinction aligns the distributed-shear BL dynamo more closely with the original BL dynamo and the conventional $\alpha\Omega$ dynamo. Although the subsurface meridional flow plays a negligible role in our distributed-shear BL dynamo, the poleward surface flow is essential.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar-mass binary black hole\,(BBH) mergers resulting from binary-single interactions\,(BSIs) in active galactic nucleus\,(AGN) disks are a potential source of gravitational wave\,(GW) events with measurable eccentricities. Previous hydrodynamical simulations have shown that ambient gas can significantly influence the dynamics of BSIs. However, due to limitations such as the use of purely Newtonian dynamics and small sample sizes, a direct estimation of the BBH merger probability during BSI has remained elusive. In this work, we directly quantify the merger probability, based on a suite of 1800 two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations coupled with post-Newtonian \emph{N}-body calculations. Our results demonstrate that dense gas can enhance the merger probability by both shrinking the spatial scale of the triple system and increasing the number of binary-single encounters. These two effects together boost the merger probability by a factor of $\sim$5, from 4\% to as high as 20\%. Among the two effects, our analysis suggests that the increase in encounter frequency plays a slightly more significant role in driving the enhancement. Moreover, this enhancement becomes more significant at larger radial distances from the central SMBH, since the total gas mass enclosed within the Hill sphere of the triple system increases with radius. Finally, the BSI process in AGN disks can naturally produce double GW merger events within a timescale of $\sim$year, which may serve as potential observational signatures of BSI occurring in AGN disk environments.

 - **Abstract**
 The intensities of total, linearly polarized, and unpolarized synchrotron emission are measures for the strengths of total, ordered, and isotropic turbulent fields in the sky plane. Faraday rotation measures (RMs) provide a model of the regular field. The quadratic difference between ordered and regular field strengths yields the strength of the anisotropic turbulent field. - Based on observations of M31 at 3.6 cm, 6.2 cm, and 20.5 cm wavelengths and assuming equipartition between the energy densities of total magnetic fields and total cosmic rays, we measured average equipartition strengths of the magnetic field in the emission torus of M31 of 6.3\pm\0.2 \muG for the total, 5.4\pm0.2 \muG for the isotropic turbulent, and 3.2\pm0.3 \muG for the ordered field in the sky plane. The average strength of the axisymmetric regular field, Breg, is 2.0\pm0.5 \muG and remains almost constant between 7 kpc and 12 kpc radius. Quadratic subtraction of the component Breg,perp in the sky plane from the ordered field Bord,perp yields the strength of the anisotropic turbulent field Ban,perp, which is 2.7\pm0.7 \muG. - The average strength of the regular field is about 40% smaller than the equipartition strength of the ordered field, which is consistent with the assumption of equipartition. The almost constant ratio between regular and isotropic turbulent fields of about 0.39 is consistent with present-day dynamo models. The almost constant ratio between anisotropic and isotropic turbulent fields of about 0.57 indicates that anisotropic turbulent fields are generated by the shearing of isotropic turbulent fields. - The average magnetic energy density is about five times larger than the thermal energy density of the diffuse warm ionized gas, while the magnetic energy density is similar to the kinetic energy density of turbulent motions of the neutral gas.

 - **Abstract**
 Data collected so far by the Pierre Auger Observatory have enabled major advances in ultra-high energy cosmic ray physics and demonstrated that improved determination of masses of primary cosmic-ray particles, preferably on an event-by-event basis, is necessary for understanding their origin and nature. Improvement in primary mass measurements was the main motivation for the upgrade of the Pierre Auger Observatory, called AugerPrime. As part of this upgrade, scintillator detectors are added to the existing water-Cherenkov surface detector stations. By making use of the differences in detector response to the electromagnetic particles and muons between scintillator and water-Cherenkov detectors, the electromagnetic and muonic components of cosmic-ray air showers can be disentangled. Since the muonic component is sensitive to the primary mass, such combination of detectors provides a powerful way to improve primary mass composition measurements over the original Auger surface detector design. In this paper, the so-called Scintillator Surface Detectors are discussed, including their design characteristics, production process, testing procedure and deployment in the field.

 - **Abstract**
 SIMP-0136 is a T2.5 brown dwarf whose young age ($200\pm50$~Myr) and low mass ($15\pm3$~M$_{\rm Jup}$) make it an ideal analogue for the directly imaged exoplanet population. With a 2.4 hour period, it is known to be variable in both the infrared and the radio, which has been attributed to changes in the cloud coverage and the presence of an aurora respectively. To quantify the changes in the atmospheric state that drive this variability, we obtained time-series spectra of SIMP-0136 covering one full rotation with both NIRSpec/PRISM and the MIRI/LRS on board JWST. We performed a series of time-resolved atmospheric retrievals using petitRADTRANS in order to measure changes in the temperature structure, chemistry, and cloudiness. We inferred the presence of a ~250 K thermal inversion above 10 mbar of SIMP-0136 at all phases, and propose that this inversion is due to the deposition of energy into the upper atmosphere by an aurora. Statistical tests were performed in order to determine which parameters drive the observed spectroscopic variability. The primary contribution was due to changes in the temperature profile at pressures deeper than 10 mbar, which resulted in variation of the effective temperature from 1243 K to 1248 K. This changing effective temperature was also correlated to observed changes in the abundances of CO2 and H2S, while all other chemical species were consistent with being homogeneous throughout the atmosphere. Patchy silicate clouds were required to fit the observed spectra, but the cloud properties were not found to systematically vary with longitude. This work paints a portrait of an L/T transition object where the primary variability mechanisms are magnetic and thermodynamic in nature, rather than due to inhomogeneous cloud coverage.

 - **Abstract**
 The next generation neutrino telescope, IceCube-Gen2, will be sensitive to the astrophysical and cosmogenic flux of neutrinos across a broad energy range, from the TeV to the EeV scale. The planned design includes 8 cubic kilometers of ice instrumented with approximately 10,000 optical sensors, a surface array, and a radio array of antennas embedded in the ice laid out sparsely over 500 km^2. The radio array provides sensitivity to ultra-high energy neutrinos using independent radio stations that can trigger on Askaryan emission from neutrino interactions in the ice. In this contribution, we present the design for the radio array along with its planned implementation, which is expected to increase sensitivity to neutrinos with energies beyond 100PeV by at least an order of magnitude over existing arrays. Furthermore, we will quantify the expected science output by presenting measurement forecasts for the main science cases of diffuse flux and point source discovery, as well as cross-section and flavor measurements.

 - **Abstract**
 The identification of potential sources of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) remains challenging due to magnetic deflections and propagation losses, which are particularly strong for nuclei. In previous iterations of this work, we proposed an approach for UHECR astronomy based on Bayesian inference through explicit modelling of propagation and magnetic deflection effects. The event-by-event mass information is expected to provide tighter constraints on these parameters and to help identify unknown sources. However, the measurements of the average mass through observations from the surface detectors at the Pierre Auger Observatory already indicate that the UHECR masses are well represented through its statistical average. In this contribution, we present our framework which uses energy and mass moments of $\ln A$ to infer the source parameters of UHECRs, including the mass composition at the source. We demonstrate the performance of our model using simulated datasets based on the Pierre Auger Observatory and Telescope Array Project. Our model can be readily applied to currently available data, and we discuss the implications of our results for UHECR source identification.

 - **Abstract**
 Jet luminosity from active galaxies and the rate of star formation have recently been found to be uncorrelated observationally. We show how to understand this in the context of a model in which powerful AGN jets enhance star formation for up to hundreds of millions of years while jet power decreases in time, followed by a longer phase in which star formation is suppressed but coupled to jet power increasing with time. We also highlight characteristic differences depending on environment richness in a way that is also compatible with the observed SEDs of high redshift radio galaxies. While the absence of a direct correlation between jet power and star formation rate emerges naturally, our framework allows us to also predict the environment richness, range of excitation and redshift values of radio AGN in the jet power-star formation rate plane.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an improved baryonification (BFC) model that modifies dark-matter-only $N$-body simulations to generate particle-level outputs for gas, dark matter, and stars. Unlike previous implementations, our approach first splits each simulation particle into separate dark matter and baryonic components, which are then displaced individually using the BFC technique. By applying the hydrostatic and ideal gas equations, we assign pressure and temperature values to individual gas particles. The model is validated against hydrodynamical simulations from the FLAMINGO and TNG suites (which feature varied feedback prescriptions) showing good agreement at the level of density and pressure profiles across a wide range of halo masses. As a further step, we calibrate the BFC model parameters to gas and stellar mass ratio profiles from the hydrodynamical simulations. Based on these calibrations, we baryonify $N$-body simulations and compare the resulting total matter power spectrum suppressions to the ones from the same hydrodynamical simulation. Carrying out this test of the BFC method at each redshift individually, we obtain a 2 percent agreement up to $k=5\,h$/Mpc across all tested feedback scenarios. We also define a reduced, 2+1 parameter BFC model that simultaneously accounts for feedback variations (2 parameters) and redshift evolution (1 parameter). The 2+1 parameter model agrees with the hydrodynamical simulations to better than 2.5 percent over the scales and redshifts relevant for cosmological surveys. Finally, we present a map-level comparison between a baryonified $N$-body simulation and a full hydrodynamical run from the TNG simulation suite. Visual inspection of dark matter, gas, and stellar density fields, along with the integrated pressure map, shows promising agreement. Further work is needed to quantify the accuracy at the level of observables.

 - **Abstract**
 The LIGO Scientific, Virgo, and KAGRA collaboration has identified two binary neutron star merger candidates, GW170817 and GW190425, along with several binary black hole candidates. While GW170817 was confirmed as a BNS merger through its electromagnetic counterparts, GW190425 lacked such observations, leaving its classification uncertain. We examine the possibility that GW190425 originated from black holes that merged after dark matter accretion caused their progenitor neutron stars to implode. Using this event, we place constraints on dark matter parameters, such as its mass and interaction cross section. We simulate GW190425-like events and analyze them using future gravitational wave detector networks, including upcoming upgrades to current detector networks and next-generation observatories. We show that a network with A+ sensitivity can not classify a GW190425-like event with sufficient confidence. Detector networks with A# sensitivity can classify such events only if the neutron stars follow a relatively stiff equation of state, whose stronger tidal imprint differs measurably from a binary black hole waveform. Next-generation observatories like the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer recover the tidal signature even for soft, compact stars, enabling confident classification. Finally, we forecast the dark matter constraints that future gravitational wave networks could achieve for similar events.

 - **Abstract**
 Infrared (IR) radiation dominates dense, interstellar clouds, yet its effect on icy grains remains largely unexplored. Its potential role in driving the photodesorption of volatile species from such grains has recently been demonstrated, providing a crucial link between the solid state reservoir of molecules and the gas phase. In this work, we investigate IR-induced photodesorption of CO for astrophysically relevant ice systems containing perhydropyrene (PHP). This fully superhydrogenated version of pyrene is used as an analogue for large carbonaceous molecules such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and related species, as well as hydrogenated carbonaceous grains. The abundance and range of strong IR absorption bands of these carbonaceous species make them interesting candidates for IR-induced effects. We present IR spectroscopic and mass spectrometric measurements probing the effects of IR radiation on two ice systems: a layered ice with CO on top of PHP, and a CO:PHP mixed ice. These ices were irradiated with IR radiation from the FELIX IR Free Electron Laser (FEL) FEL-2. In accordance with previous studies, we confirm that direct excitation of CO is not an efficient pathway to CO desorption, indicating that another energy dissipation mechanism exists. We demonstrate that vibrational excitation of the PHP CH stretching modes leads to efficient CO photodesorption. The derived photodesorption yields are an order of magnitude higher for the layered than the mixed system and comparable to those previously obtained for CO photodesorption from CO on amorphous solid water upon excitation of H$_2$O vibrational modes. Our results indicate that IR excitation of carbonaceous molecules and grains in dense clouds could potentially play an important role in the desorption of volatile species such as CO from icy grains.
#### Gravitational lensing rarely produces high-mass outliers to the compact binary population

 - **Abstract**
 All gravitational-wave signals are inevitably gravitationally lensed by intervening matter as they propagate through the Universe. When a gravitational-wave signal is magnified, it appears to have originated from a closer, more massive system. Thus, high-mass outliers to the gravitational-wave source population are often proposed as natural candidates for strongly lensed events. However, when using a data-driven method for identifying population outliers, we find that high-mass outliers are not necessarily strongly lensed, nor will the majority of strongly-lensed signals appear as high-mass outliers. This is both because statistical fluctuations produce a larger effect on observed binary parameters than does lensing magnification, and because lensing-induced outliers must originate from intrinsically high-mass sources, which are rare. Thus, the appearance of a single lensing-induced outlier implies the existence of many other lensed events within the catalog. We additionally show that it is possible to constrain the strong lensing optical depth, which is a fundamental quantity of our Universe, with the detection or absence of high-mass outliers. However, constraints using the latest gravitational-wave catalog are weak$\unicode{x2014}$we obtain an upper limit on the optical depth of sources at redshift $1$ magnified by a factor of $5$ or more of $\tau(\mu\geq5,z=1)\leq 0.035 \unicode{x2014}$and future observing runs will not make an outlier-based method competitive with other probes of the optical depth. Future work will investigate the ability of the full inferred population of compact binaries to inform the distribution of lenses in the Universe, opening a unique opportunity to access the high-redshift Universe and constrain cosmic structures.

 - **Abstract**
 Baryonic feedback alters the matter distribution on small and intermediate scales, posing a challenge for precision cosmology. The new, component-wise baryonification (BFC) approach provides a self-consistent framework to model feedback effects for different observables. In this paper we use this framework to fit kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) observations from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) alongside halo X-ray gas fractions from eROSITA, investigating baryonic feedback in a cosmological context. We first show that the kSZ data from ACT is consistent with the gas fractions from eROSITA, both suggesting a feedback model that is stronger than what is assumed in most hydrodynamical simulations. This finding is in contrast to older, pre-eROSITA gas fraction measurements that point towards weaker feedback in tension with the kSZ results. We suspect these discrepancies to be due to selection bias in the pre-eROSITA sample, or differences in halo mass estimation between the two data sets. In a further step, we use the BFC model to predict the baryonic suppression of the matter power spectrum. Based on our combined fit to data from ACT and eROSITA, we find a power spectrum suppression that exceeds the percent-level at modes above $k=0.3-0.6 \,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, growing to 2-8 percent at $k=1\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, and to 20-25 percent at $k=5\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, consistent with strong-feedback hydrodynamical simulations. Finally, we compare our best-fitting model to the observed gas density and pressure profiles of massive galaxy clusters from the X-COP sample, finding excellent agreement. These results show that BFC provides a self-consistent picture of feedback across mass- and length scales as well as different cosmological observables, thus making it promising for applications to multiwavelength studies to jointly constrain cosmology and baryonic effects.
