 - **Abstract**
 We study the structure and properties of Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) Stars as alternatives to conventional neutron stars. The work focuses on the thermodynamic study of gases composed of charged scalar bosons and fermions (electrons, protons, and neutrons) under a uniform magnetic field, paying particular attention to the low-temperature limit. Expressions are derived for the thermodynamic potential, particle densities, energies, anisotropic pressures, and magnetization, including both statistical and vacuum contributions, with the latter separated into the contribution from the Lowest Landau Level (LLL) and excited levels. Based on these results, anisotropic equations of state (EoS) are constructed that incorporate chemical equilibrium and charge neutrality conditions for a mixed \textit{npe}+$\pi^-$ gas. These EoS are then implemented in a system of anisotropic structure equations based on an axisymmetric metric, allowing for the analysis of how the magnetic field modifies the structure of BEC stars, including their masses, radii, deformations, gravitational redshifts, and mass quadrupole moments. Numerical results are presented showing the influence of the magnetic field on the global properties of these stars, including potential observable signatures.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the timescales of atomic gas turbulence is crucial to understanding the interplay between star formation and the interstellar medium (ISM). To investigate the timescales of turbulence low-mass galaxies ($10^{6.8}<M_\odot<10^9$), this study combines temporally resolved star formation histories (SFHs) -- derived from color-magnitude diagrams -- with kinematic data of the atomic and ionized hydrogen in a large sample of nearby, star-forming, low-mass galaxies. To best understand the timescales involved, SFHs and gas kinematics were analyzed in 400$\times$400 parsec regions to capture the local impacts of star formation. No strong correlation was found between the ionized gas velocity dispersion and the star formation activity over the past 5-500 Myr. In contrast, a consistent and significant correlation between the atomic hydrogen turbulence measures and the star formation activity t$\geq$100 Myr ago was identified. This correlation suggests the star formation activity and atomic gas are coupled on this timescale. This connection between star-formation activity $>$100 Myr ago, and the HI turbulence properties, may be related to the time scales over which turbulence decays in the ISM. Additionally, the results demonstrate a possible difference in the global and local turbulence properties of low-mass galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 The CGM around unobscured AGN has received much attention in recent years. Comparatively, nebulae associated with obscured AGN are less studied. Here, we simulate the Ly$\alpha$, H$\alpha$, and HeII nebulae around the two types of AGN at $z=2-3$ with ten massive systems from the FIRE simulations based on the unified model to show their differences and to test if they can be used to constrain the AGN model. We post-process the data with the CLOUDY and the Ly$\alpha$ radiative transfer code, RASCAS. Overall, we find that the Ly$\alpha$ nebulae around the unobscured AGN (type-I nebulae) and obscured AGN (type-II nebulae) do not exhibit significant differences in the luminosity, area, and HeII/Ly$\alpha$ when the simulated cutout is set to the halo virial radius. Whereas, the type-II nebulae exhibit less symmetric morphologies, flatter surface brightness profiles, and larger emission line widths (at $R\geq 10$ kpc) than those of the type-I nebulae. These nebulae properties exhibit complicated correlations with the AGN, indicating that nebulae observations can be applied to constrain the AGN engine. However, independent observations on nebulae in the mentioned emissions are insufficient to test the unified model as a priori in observations is not possible to know the direction and opening angle of the ionization cone. We prompt that the joint observations of Ly$\alpha$ nebulae and radio jets can help to reveal the ionization cone to probe the unified model. Our calculations suggest that this method requires $\geq 75$ type-II Ly$\alpha$ nebulae with current instruments to reach a confidence level of $\geq 95\%$.

 - **Abstract**
 We use data from the EMU (Evolutionary Map of the Universe) and POSSUM (Polarization Sky Survey of the Universe's Magnetism) radio southern sky surveys, conducted with the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP), to compile a catalogue of Galactic supernova remnants (SNRs) and candidate SNRs within the region of $277.5^\circ \leq \ell \leq 311.7^\circ$ Galactic longitude, $|b| \leq 5.4^\circ$ Galactic latitude, as well as an additional field along the Galactic plane, approximately $315.5^\circ \leq \ell \leq 323.0^\circ$ Galactic longitude, $-4.5^\circ \leq b \leq 1.5^\circ$ Galactic latitude. In the areas studied, there are 44 known SNRs and 46 SNR candidates that have been previously identified in the radio. We confirm eight of these candidates as SNRs based on evidence of linear polarization or through the calculation of nonthermal spectral indices. Additionally, we identify possible radio counterparts for seven SNR candidates that were previously only identified in X-rays (four) or optical (three). We also present six new SNRs and 37 new SNR candidates. The results of this study demonstrate the utility of ASKAP for discovering new and potential SNRs and refining the classification of previously identified candidates. In particular, we find that the EMU and POSSUM surveys are particularly well suited for observing high-latitude SNRs and confirming SNR candidates with polarization. The region studied in this work represents approximately one-quarter of the Galactic plane, by longitude, that will eventually be surveyed by EMU/POSSUM and we expect that the ongoing surveys will continue to uncover new SNRs and SNR candidates.
#### The Timing Evolution of the Magnetar Swift J1818.0-1607 During a Period of Reduced Activity

 - **Abstract**
 We report results from an observational campaign of the radio-loud magnetar Swift J1818.0-1607 using the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) at 2.0 GHz, which began in November 2021 during a period of reduced activity approximately 20 months after its March 2020 outburst. Over the 60-day duration reported here, the integrated pulse profile remained consistently stable, exhibiting a single, narrow peak with with a small precursor component and no evidence of a postcursor one. This pulse profile is in sharp contrast to the double-peaked morphology observed during an observing campaign approximately 120 days preceding ours. Along with this change in the integrated pulse profile shape, we also measure a slower spin-down rate compared to the end of that preceding campaign. Together, these differences suggest that a mode-switching event likely occurred between the end of that campaign and the start of ours. Finally, we derived a phase-connected timing solution from our data, from which we inferred a characteristic age of approximately 2500 years, about 2.5 times older than the most recent published estimate, and a surface dipole magnetic field strength of roughly 1 x 10^14 G, nearly three times weaker. These updated estimates reflect the short-term variations in the magnetar's spin-down rate, from which both its age and magnetic field strength are inferred, rather than intrinsic changes in the magnetar itself.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the synchrotron emission signatures of shocks driven by active galactic nucleus (AGN) wind in elliptical galaxies based on our two-dimensional axisymmetric hydrodynamic $\textit{MACER}$ numerical simulations. Using these simulation data, we calculate the synchrotron radiation produced by nonthermal electrons accelerated at shocks, adopting reasonable assumptions for the magnetic field and relativistic electron distribution (derived from diffusive shock acceleration theory), and predict the resulting observational signatures. In our fiducial model, shocks driven by AGN winds produce synchrotron emission with luminosities of approximately $10^{29}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}\,Hz^{-1}}$ in the radio band (0.5-5 GHz), with spectral indices of $\alpha \approx -0.4$ to $-0.6$ during the strongest shock phases, gradually steepening to about $-0.8$ to $-1.4$ as the electron population ages. Spatially, the emission is initially concentrated in regions of strong shocks, later expanding into more extended, diffuse structures. We also apply our model to the dwarf elliptical galaxy Messier 32 (M32), and find remarkable consistency between our simulated emission and the observed nuclear radio source, suggesting that this radio component likely originates from hot-wind-driven shocks. Our results indicate that AGN winds not only influence galaxy gas dynamics through mechanical energy input but also yield direct observational evidence via nonthermal radiation. With the advent of next-generation radio facilities such as the FAST Core Array, SKA, and ngVLA, these emission signatures will serve as important probes for detecting and characterizing AGN feedback.

 - **Abstract**
 Deep space navigation presents significant challenges due to the unavailability of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals and severe signal attenuation over interplanetary distances. Traditional terrestrial systems, such as NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) and ESA ESTRACK, rely on Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) for angular positioning. However, these systems are limited by relatively short baselines, atmospheric distortions requiring extensive calibration, and reduced visibility availability due to Earth rotation. This research proposes a complementary deep space navigation approach using space based interferometry, in which radio signals from the spacecraft are received and cross correlated onboard Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) satellites. By replacing terrestrial VLBI stations with dual GEO platforms, the method significantly extends the effective baseline, removes atmospheric phase errors, and provides almost continuous visibility to deep space targets. Unlike Earth based systems, GEO based interferometry maintains persistent station mutual visibility, enabling higher measurement availability and more flexible mission support. A complete system model is presented, including the principles of dual frequency phase based angular tracking and a structured error budget analysis. Theoretical results show that the GEO based system achieves a total angular error of approximately 3.73 nanoradians, within the same order of magnitude as terrestrial VLBI. Space based architecture nearly doubles the geometrical availability for interferometric tracking, while eliminating atmospheric distortions. These findings support the feasibility of the GEO based VLBI concept and motivate continued research and field validation for future deep space navigation applications.

 - **Abstract**
 Crystal Eye is a space-based all-sky monitor optimized for the autonomous detection and localization of transients in the 10 keV to 30 MeV energy range, a region where extensive observations and monitoring of various astrophysical phenomena are required. By focusing on the operating environment and its impact on the observation process, we optimized the detector design and assessed its scientific potential. We explored the use of novel techniques to achieve the science goals of the experiment. We assumed the orbit of a potential future mission at approximately 550 km altitude near the equatorial region with a 20° inclination. In such an orbit, the main background contributions for this kind of detector are from different particles and radiation of cosmic origin and secondaries produced by their interaction in the Earth's atmospheric and geomagnetic environment. We studied the response of the detector in this background environment, using the Geant4 Monte Carlo simulation toolkit. We also calculated other detector performance parameters to estimate its scientific capabilities. The detector effective area and efficiency are calculated for low energy gamma-ray sources and used to estimate its sensitivity to short-duration transient and persistent sources. The calculation shows a better effective area and sensitivity by several factors compared to existing instruments of similar type. A method is also developed and discussed to estimate the online transient-localization performance of the detector, suggesting a better localization precision by about an order of magnitude than those typically reported by existing gamma-ray monitors. We present here the simulation study and results of an innovative detector design concept that can make a significant contribution in the multi-messenger era. Moreover, this study can be useful as a technical reference for similar future experiments.

 - **Abstract**
 The Perseus cluster (Abell 426) is a nearby massive galaxy cluster that spans several degrees. We combined SRG/eROSITA, XMM-Newton, and Chandra data to get a complete coverage of this cluster in X-rays up to $R_{\rm 200c}$ and beyond, although at the largest radii, spatial non-uniformities of X-ray background and foreground dominate. While the Perseus central part represents a canonical cool-core structure with clear signs of AGN Feedback, the outskirts, in turn, serve as a convincing example of a merger-perturbed system. X-ray data suggest that IC310 is the main galaxy of a subcluster that merges with Perseus over the past $\sim 4\,{\rm Gyr}$. Overall, this configuration resembles the merger between the Coma cluster and the NGC4839 group. It is statistically more likely to find a merging group near the apocenter of its orbit. Therefore, it is not surprising that IC310 in Perseus has a relatively small velocity relative to the main cluster, similarly to NGC4839 in Coma. Perseus also hosts a high-velocity radio galaxy, NGC1265 (line-of-sight velocity is almost twice the virial velocity of the main cluster), which is known for its spectacular radio tail. Unless this galaxy has been accelerated by a time-variable potential associated with the merger, it has to move almost along the line of sight through the entire cluster, which would be a rare, but not a truly exceptional configuration. Both galaxies, IC310 and NGC1265, have remarkable radio tails with sharp bends that are reminiscent of a "snake biting its tail". We speculate that these curious shapes are natural consequences of their (different) orbits in Perseus. For IC310, the proximity to the apocenter and the reversal of its radial velocity might play a role. For NGC1265, the nearly line-of-sight motion coupled with the gas motions in the merging system might be important.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an augmentation to longstanding evidence from observations and MHD modeling that (1) every solar emerging bipolar magnetic region (BMR) is made by an emerging omega-loop flux rope, and (2) twist in the flux-rope field makes the emerged field sigmoidal. Using co-temporal full-disk coronal EUV images, magnetograms, and continuum images from Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), we found and tracked the emergence of 42 emerging single-BMR sigmoidal active regions (ARs) that have sunspots in both polarity domains. Throughout each AR's emergence, we quantified the emerging BMR's tilt angle to the east-west direction (the x-direction in SDO images) by measuring in the continuum images the tilt angle of the line through the (visually located) two centroids of the BMR's opposite-polarity sunspot clusters. As each AR emerges, it becomes either S-shaped (shows net right-handed magnetic twist) or Z-shaped (shows net left-handed magnetic twist) in the coronal EUV images. Nineteen of the ARs become S-shaped and 23 become Z-shaped. For all 42 ARs, in agreement with published MHD simulations of the emergence of a single-BMR sigmoidal AR from a subsurface twisted flux rope, if the AR becomes S-shaped, the emerging BMR pivots counterclockwise, and if the AR becomes Z-shaped, the emerging BMR pivots clockwise. For our 42 ARs, the pivot amount roughly ranges from 10° to 90° and averages about 35°. Thus, at the onset of the emergence of our average emerging omega-loop flux rope, the magnetic field's twist pitch angle at the flux rope's top edge is plausibly about 35°.
#### X-Raying a Be star disk: fundamental parameters of the eclipsing binary Be star V658 Car

 - **Abstract**
 With its two stellar eclipses and two disk attenuations per binary orbit, V658 Carinae stands out as the first clear eclipsing Be + sdOB system. This rare alignment offers a unique opportunity to probe the structure and dynamics of a Be star disk with unprecedented detail. In this study, we present the most comprehensive observational dataset and modeling effort for this system to date, including optical, near-infrared, and ultraviolet spectroscopy, space-based photometry, and optical polarization. Using a new ray-tracing code, we apply a three-component model, consisting of an oblate, rapidly rotating Be star, a symmetric circumstellar disk, and a compact stripped companion, to reproduce the system's light curve, polarization, and spectral features. Our analysis yields precise constraints on the stellar and disk parameters, determining its status as the second known late-type Be + stripped star, and also provides strong spectroscopic evidence for a tenuous circumsecondary envelope. Despite the model's overall success, several key observables, such as the $H_{\alpha}$ equivalent width and the secondary attenuation, remain poorly reproduced, pointing to the need for more sophisticated modelling. In particular, future improvements should incorporate the companion's radiative feedback on the disk and account for asymmetric disk structures expected by the gravitational interaction with the companion. Owing to its unique geometry and rich diagnostics, V658 Car establishes itself as a benchmark system for Be stars (and rapid rotators in general), stripped stars, post-RLOF massive binaries, and circumstellar disk structures.

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20093

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.20093

 - **Abstract**
 We provide a method to calculate the evolution of an eccentric and inclined orbit under the magnetic effect. Taking the unipolar interaction as an example, we study both coplanar and inclined orbits. We calculate the Lorentz force and then the changes in orbital energy and angular momentum. Combined with the total energy dissipation we write down the evolution equations of semi-major axis, eccentricity, inclination and spin. This set of equations can be used to study the orbital and spin evolution under the magnetic interaction.
#### Constraints on extra charges in dyonic Kerr-Newman-Kasuya-Taub-NUT black hole from the observations of quasi-periodic oscillations

 - **Abstract**
 This paper investigates the influence of the dimensionless electric charge ($Q/M$), magnetic charge ($P/M$), and Taub-NUT parameter ($n/M$) of a dyonic Kerr-Newman-Kasuya-Taub-NUT black hole on quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) observed in X-ray binaries. Using the relativistic precession model, we calculate the three fundamental frequencies arising from particle motion in the accretion disk around the black hole. These theoretical predictions are then confronted with observational QPO data from five X-ray binaries (GRO J1655-40, XTE J1859$+$226, XTE J1550-564, GRS 1915$+$105, and H1743-322), and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique is used to constrain the black hole parameters. Our analysis reveals no significant evidence for nonzero values of $Q/M$ and $P/M$ across all sources, thereby allowing us to place several stringent upper limits on electric charge ($Q/M$) and magnetic charge ($P/M$) of the black hole in these systems. Similarly, no compelling indication of a nonzero Taub-NUT parameter is found in QPOs from GRO J1655-40, XTE J1859$+$226, XTE J1550-564, and H1743-322. In contrast, the posterior distribution derived from GRS 1915$+$105 data suggests a nonzero Taub-NUT parameter, i.e., gravitomagnetic monopole moment. This result indicates a potential deviation from the Kerr metric in this astrophysical black hole.
#### Interpreting nebular emission lines in the high-redshift Universe

 - **Abstract**
 One of the most remarkable outcomes from JWST has been the exquisite UV-optical spectroscopic data for galaxies in the high-redshift Universe ($z \geq 5$), enabling the use of various nebular emission lines to infer conditions of the interstellar medium. In this work, we evaluate the reliability of these diagnostics, specifically those used to recover the star formation rate (SFR), the ionising photon production efficiency, and the gas-phase oxygen abundance. We use forward-modelled galaxy spectra from idealised toy models and the FLARES cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to assess how these diagnostic lines respond to variations in the underlying stellar populations and star-dust geometry. We find that due to the clumpy nature of FLARES galaxies, they exhibit strong internal variation in age, metallicity and dust attenuation, biasing the interpretation using these diagnostics. In FLARES, the SFRD at the bright-end of the SFR function can be underestimated by as much as $30 \%$ compared to the true values. Similarly, the true ionising photon production efficiency in FLARES remains almost constant with stellar mass, while estimates using H$\alpha$ or H$\beta$ can underestimate it by more than 0.5 dex at the massive end ($>10^{9.5}$ M$_{\odot}$), introducing an artificial declining trend. The FLARES mass-metallicity relation derived from line ratios (dust corrected) exhibits a flat trend, whereas the intrinsic mass-weighted relation shows a strong positive correlation. These findings highlight the critical importance of understanding the biases introduced due to the coupling of star-dust geometry and heterogeneous stellar population when interpreting nebular emission lines at high redshift. Hence the accurate interpretation of high-redshift galaxy spectra requires careful forward modelling that accounts for realistic star-dust geometry and population variations.

 - **Abstract**
 We show that primordial black holes (PBHs) with significant spin and bulk motion produce sharply collimated neutrino bursts from Hawking evaporation, arising from the interplay of spin-induced angular anisotropy and relativistic Doppler boosting. This effect shifts the neutrino spectrum into the multi-GeV to hundreds of GeV range, where atmospheric backgrounds drop steeply, and enhances the flux by orders of magnitude within a narrow forward cone. We compute the full lab-frame neutrino distribution and derive updated constraints on PBH number density from non-observation of such bursts in IceCube and KM3NeT. Our results identify directional high-energy neutrino bursts as a distinctive, testable signature of spinning PBHs, providing a complementary probe of the PBH dark matter hypothesis and Hawking radiation.

 - **Abstract**
 The Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy provides us with the unique opportunity to study an ongoing Galactic cannibalistic event between our Milky Way Galaxy and a satellite dwarf galaxy. We present the first major membership star catalog of the Sagittarius dwarf core ($\approx$400,000 sources) and Messier 54 ($\approx$2000 sources) with positions, proper motions, and parallaxes from $Gaia$ DR3, supplemented with metallicities from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment. We isolate the Sagittarius dwarf core (3.7 core radii) and Messier 54 (0.125 core radii) using literature positions. Using evolutionary sub-samples separated within a color-magnitude diagram, we analyze the structures and substructures of the Sagittarius core and infer its positional relationship with Messier 54 within 5D phase space. A sample of Milky Way stars from a similar galactic latitude was used to identify contaminants and separate member stars from the core of the Sgr dSph and Messier 54 using a Gaussian distribution in proper motion space. We present the derived proper motion, parallaxes, and metallicities for these evolutionary sub-samples while demonstrating the precision of our sample using red clump standard candles. We find a distance modulus for the Sagittarius core and Messier 54 of $(m-M)_{0}=17.002^{+0.038}_{-0.042}$ mag and $(m-M)_{0}=17.011^{+0.038}_{-0.039}$ mag, corresponding to a heliocentric distance of $d=25.14^{+0.45}_{-0.48}$ kpc and $d=25.25^{+0.48}_{-0.45}$ kpc respectively. With red clump distance analysis, our results imply there is no separation between the Sagittarius core and Messier 54.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the analysis results of flux and spectral variability of the blazar OP 313 across intra-night to short-term timescales using BVRI photometric data, gathered over 25 nights from Nov 2024 to May 2025, using two optical telescopes in ARIES, India. The source was in an outburst state during this period. We searched for intraday variations (IDV), using two powerful statistical tests: the Power Enhanced F-test and the Nested ANOVA test. The source displayed IDV in the R band for five of the ten nights, yielding a duty cycle of 34$\%$. During the entire monitoring of the source, it showed variations of over two mag in all B, V, R, and I data bands. We obtained a variability timescale for a variable light curve, giving us an upper limit for the size of the emission region. We generated optical SEDs of the blazar for these 25 nights, fitted a power law of form $(F_\nu \propto \nu^{-\alpha_{o}})$ and found the weighted mean spectral index to be 1.471$\pm$0.004. An analysis of the color-magnitude diagram shows that, contrary to the redder-when-brighter (RWB) trend typically observed in FSRQs, this source exhibits a bluer-when-brighter (BWB) trend on short-term variability (STV) timescales - a behavior more commonly associated with BL Lac object. We explore potential physical mechanisms responsible for the observed spectral variability.

 - **Abstract**
 Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are known to exhibit stochastic variability across a wide range of timescales and wavelengths. AGN flares are extreme outbursts that deviate from this typical behavior and may trace a range of energetic physical processes. Using six years of data from Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) Data Release 23, we conduct a systematic search for AGN flares among a sample of well-sampled AGNs and AGN candidates. We construct two catalogs: the AGN Flare Coarse Catalog (AGNFCC), containing 28,504 flares identified via Bayesian blocks and Gaussian Processes, and the AGN Flare Refined Catalog (AGNFRC), comprising 1,984 high-confidence flares selected using stricter criteria. We analyze their spatial distribution, temporal characteristics, host AGN type and potential origins. Some flares can be associated with known supernovae, tidal disruption events, or blazars, and a few may be linked to binary black hole mergers or microlensing events. These catalogs provide a valuable resource for studying transient phenomena in AGNs and are publicly available at this https URL.

 - **Abstract**
 Multi-messenger astronomy was galvanized by the detection of gravitational waves (GWs) from the binary neutron star (BNS) merger GW170817 and electromagnetic (EM) emission from the subsequent kilonova and short gamma ray burst. Maximizing multi-messenger constraints on these systems requires combining models of the progenitors and products of BNS mergers within a single framework in anticipation of future GW and EM detectors. We demonstrate how combining models of different aspects of the BNS progenitor-merger-remnant system into a full multi-messenger modeling pipeline reveals insight into modeling challenges that will need to be addressed in the coming decade of multi-messenger astronomy. Motivated by GW170817, this combined model relates the progenitor astrophysics of a BNS population with their GW observability and localizability, kilonova light curves, gamma-ray burst afterglow flux, and kilonova remnant evolution. We find joint correlations between the GW and EM observables that depend on a complicated interplay between modeling assumptions and theoretical uncertainties. Next generation detectors will generically provide multi-messenger constraints on BNSs with median GW network signal-to-noise ratio $\approx 10$, median of the 90$^{\rm th}$ percentile sky area $\approx 10$ sq. deg., and kilonova $i$-band apparent magnitudes ranging from $\approx 33$ to $23$. We find no more than 4\% of the BNSs are simultaneously detectable by a network of two Cosmic Explorers and one Einstein Telescope and by the Roman and Rubin telescopes for 55 and 180 sec. exposures in a $K$-like band and $i$ and $g$ bands, respectively. We discuss key modeling assumptions that will be transmitted as multi-messenger systematics in the analysis of future datasets, such as uncertain astrophysical processes of binary populations and the nuclear equation of state for tests of nuclear physics and dark matter.

 - **Abstract**
 Upcoming stage 4 surveys, such as the Simons Observatory, LSST, and Euclid, are poised to measure weak gravitational lensing of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and galaxies with unprecedented precision. While the power spectrum is the standard statistic used to analyze weak lensing data, non-Gaussianity from non-linear structure growth encodes additional cosmological information in higher-order statistics. We forecast the ability of future surveys to constrain cosmological parameters using the weak lensing power spectrum and bispectrum from both CMB and galaxy surveys, including their cross-correlations. We consider an eight-parameter model ($\Lambda$CDM + $\sum m_\nu$ + $w_0$) and assess constraints for stage 4 survey specifications. In the absence of systematics, both the CMB and galaxy lensing bispectra are found to be detectable at high signal-to-noise. We test two priors: a ''strong'' one based on constraints from CMB temperature and $E$-mode polarization anisotropies, and a ''weak'' one with minimal assumptions. With the weak prior, the bispectrum significantly improves parameter constraints by breaking degeneracies. For strong priors, improvements are more limited, especially for the CMB bispectrum. On small scales, where non-linear effects dominate, the bispectrum's constraining power can rival that of the power spectrum. We also find strong synergy between CMB and galaxy lensing; combining both probes leads to tighter constraints, particularly on neutrino mass. It was recently found that the CMB lensing bispectrum is strongly affected by the Born approximation, so we also consider post-Born corrections but find that our main conclusions remain the same. These results highlight the potential of higher-order lensing statistics and motivate further work on neglected effects such as non-Gaussian covariance, instrumental systematics, and baryonic feedback.
#### Gravitational lensing of fast radio bursts: prospects for probing microlens populations in lensing galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational lensing by a stellar microlens of mass $M$ forms two images separated by micro-arcseconds on the sky and has a time delay of $2\times10^{-5}(M/{\rm M_\odot})$ seconds. Although we cannot resolve such micro-images in the sky, they could be resolved in time if the source is a fast radio burst (FRB). In this work, we study the magnification ($|\mu|$) and time delay~($t_d$) distributions of micro-images led by different microlens populations. We find that, in microlensing of typical strongly lensed (macro-)images in galaxy lenses, micro-images stemmed from a population of stellar mass microlenses in the $[0.08, 1.5]\:{\rm M_\odot}$ range and a second (dark) microlens population in $[10^{-3} - 10^{-2}]\:{\rm M_\odot}$ range reside in different parts of $|\mu|-t_d$ plane. For the global minimum macro-image, due to low stellar mass density, we find that the stellar population leads to peaks in autocorrelation at ${>}10^{-6}$ seconds, whereas the secondary population leads to peaks at ${<}10^{-6}$ seconds, allowing us to differentiate different microlens populations. However, an increase in stellar density introduces new peaks at ${<}10^{-6}$ seconds, which can pollute the inference about the presence of multiple microlens populations. In addition, we also show that the number of micro-images, hence the number of peaks in the autocorrelation, is also sensitive to the underlying stellar mass function, allowing us to constrain the stellar initial mass function (IMF) with FRB microlesning in the future. This work is a first step towards using FRB lensing to probe the microlens population within strong lenses, and more detailed studies are required to assess the effect of various uncertainties that we only discussed qualitatively.

 - **Abstract**
 Modern sky surveys produce vast amounts of observational data, making the application of classical methods for estimating galaxy properties challenging and time-consuming. This challenge can be significantly alleviated by employing automatic machine and deep learning techniques. We propose an implementation of the ULISSE algorithm aimed at determining physical parameters of galaxies, in particular star-formation rates (SFR) and stellar masses ($M_{\ast}$), using only composite-color images. ULISSE is able to rapidly and efficiently identify candidates from a single image based on photometric and morphological similarities to a given reference object with known properties. This approach leverages features extracted from the ImageNet dataset to perform similarity searches among all objects in the sample, eliminating the need for extensive neural network training. Our experiments, performed on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, demonstrate that we are able to predict the joint star formation rate and stellar mass of the target galaxies within 1 dex in 60% to 80% of cases, depending on the investigated subsample (quiescent/star-forming galaxies, early-/late-type, etc.), and within 0.5 dex if we consider these parameters separately. This is approximately twice the fraction obtained from a random guess extracted from the parent population. Additionally, we find ULISSE is more effective for galaxies with active star formation compared to elliptical galaxies with quenched star formation. Additionally, ULISSE performs more efficiently for galaxies with bright nuclei such as AGN. Our results suggest that ULISSE is a promising tool for a preliminary estimation of star-formation rates and stellar masses for galaxies based only on single images in current and future wide-field surveys (e.g., Euclid, LSST), which target millions of sources nightly.

 - **Abstract**
 Supernovae (SNe) associated with X-Ray Flashes (XRFs) are extremely rare. Therefore, the discovery of each new object in this class offers a unique opportunity to improve our understanding about their origins and potential connection with other high-energy phenomena. SN 2025kg is one of the most recent events discovered in this category, and exhibits a double-peaked light curve, with an initial cooling phase followed by the main peak. Here, we investigate the possible mechanisms powering its bolometric light curve and expansion velocities, using numerical calculations to simulate the explosion. We found that low ejecta masses (Mej ~ 2 Msun) and moderate explosion energies (E ~ 2e51 erg) are required to reproduce the data. Our models also show that a large amount of nickel (M_Ni = 0.85 Msun) is needed to achieve the high luminosity of SN 2025kg, which makes this scenario difficult to sustain. As an alternative, we explore a model in which a millisecond magnetar serves as the primary energy source. A magnetar with a spin period of 3 ms, approximately, and a magnetic field of 28e14 G gives an adequate match to the data. To account for the early cooling phase, we assume the presence of a dense circumstellar material surrounding the progenitor, with a mass of 0.27 Msun and an extension of 500 Rsun. A comparison and modeling of a select group of SNe--SN 2006aj, SN 2020bvc and SN 2023pel--is also presented. A remarkable similarity emerges between SN 2025kg and SN 2023pel. As SN 2023pel was recently proposed to be powered by a magnetar, this further supports the magnetar scenario for SN 2025kg.

 - **Abstract**
 JWST observations have revealed an overabundance of bright galaxies at $z \geq 9$, creating apparent tensions with theoretical predictions within standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We address this challenge using a semi-empirical approach that connects dark matter halos to observed UV luminosity through physically motivated double power-law star formation efficiency (SFE) model as a function of halo mass, redshift and perform joint Bayesian analysis of luminosity functions spanning $z = 4 - 16$ using combined HST and JWST data. Through systematic model comparison using information criteria (AIC, BIC, DIC), we identify the optimal framework requiring redshift evolution only in the low-mass slope parameter $\alpha(z)$ while maintaining other SFE parameters constant. Our best-fitting model achieves excellent agreement with observations using modest, constant UV scatter $\sigma_{\rm UV} = 0.32$ dex, significantly lower than the $\gtrsim 1.3$ dex values suggested by previous studies for $z > 13$. This reduced scatter requirement is compensated by strongly evolving star formation efficiency, with $\alpha$ increasing toward higher redshifts, indicating enhanced star formation in low-mass halos during cosmic dawn. The model also successfully reproduces another important observational diagnostic such as effective galaxy bias across the full redshift range. Furthermore, model predictions are consistent up to a redshift of $z\sim 20$. Our results demonstrate that JWST's early galaxy observations can be reconciled with standard cosmology through the interplay of modest stochasticity and evolving star formation physics, without invoking extreme burstiness or exotic mechanisms.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the detection of the binary system 2MASS J02132062+3648506 AB using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) archive data observed at 4-8 GHz. The system is a triple consisting of a tight binary ($\sim0.2"$) of two M dwarfs of spectral class M4.5 and M6.5 and a wide T3 brown dwarf companion ($\sim$16.4"). The binary displays coronal and chromospheric activity as traced by previously measured X-ray flux and H$\alpha$ emission. We detect the unresolved binary at a peak flux density of $\sim356\ \mu \mathrm{Jybeam}^{-1}$ at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of $\sim36$ and determine a radio luminosity of $\mathrm{log}L_R/\mathrm{log}L_\mathrm{bol}\approx-7.76$. The radio emission is quiescent, polarised at a mean circular polarisation fraction $f_\mathrm{c}=45.20 \pm 1.58$ % and exhibits a spectral index $\alpha=-0.44\pm0.07$ . We probe the binary using the Enhanced Multi-Element Remotely Linked Interferometer Network (e-MERLIN) with an angular resolution of $\sim40$ mas at 5 GHz and detect a component at a peak flux density of $\sim90\ \mu$Jy $\mathrm{beam}^{-1}$ at a SNR $\sim5$ . We propose a gyrosynchrotron origin for the radio emission and estimate a magnetic field strength $B<174.86$ G, an emitting region of size $L<1.54$ times the radius of the M4.5 primary and a plasma number density $n_\mathrm{e}<2.91\times10^5\ \mathrm{cm}^{-3}$. The brown dwarf companion is not detected. Additionally, we have analysed observations of 2MASS J04183483+213127, a chromospherically active L5 brown dwarf which is also not detected. Accordingly, we place $3\sigma$ flux density upper limits at $36.9\ \mu$Jy $\mathrm{beam}^{-1}$ and $42.3\ \mu$Jy $\mathrm{beam}^{-1}$ for Stokes I and V respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a spectroscopic analysis of a broad-line active galactic nucleus (AGN) selected as little red dot at $z = 5.3$ behind the Bullet cluster (Bz5.3), based on JWST/NIRCam and NIRSpec data. The detection of strong FeII, OI, and CaII triplet emission lines, along with the evidence of broad Balmer lines, provides unambiguous evidence of a broad-line region (BLR) and an accreting supermassive black hole. Notably, we report the first detection of the $\lambda1304$ bump (i.e., blend of OI$\lambda$1304 and SiII) at high redshift, a feature commonly seen in local AGNs but not yet reported in the early Universe. The OI$\lambda$1304/$\lambda8446$ photon ratio is highly suppressed (0.1-0.3), implying significant internal dust extinction, with estimated dust attenuation $A_V \sim 0.4$-$1.0$. We identify Ly$\beta$ fluorescence as the dominant excitation mechanism of the low-ionization lines, with additional contributions from collisional excitation. High OI$\lambda$8446 equivalent width and weak OI$\lambda$7774 support this interpretation. The detection of iron emission, whether from broad permitted or narrow forbidden lines, supports the presence of a stratified BLR, as also recently proposed in local LRDs. Photoionization modeling of OI$\lambda$8446 and CaII further suggests the coexistence of multiple gas phases with distinct densities and ionization states, highlighting the complexity of the BLR. Bz5.3 thus offers a rare window into early AGN activity and BLR physics at early times.
#### Fast and "lossless" propagation of relativistic electrons along magnetized non-thermal filaments in galaxy clusters and the Galactic Center region

 - **Abstract**
 Relativistic leptons in galaxy clusters lose their energy via radiation (synchrotron and inverse Compton losses) and interactions with the ambient plasma. At z~0, pure radiative losses limit the lifetime of electrons emitting at ~GHz frequencies to t<100 Myr. Adiabatic losses can further lower Lorentz factors of electrons trapped in an expanding medium. If the propagation speed of electrons relative to the ambient weakly magnetized (plasma $\beta\sim10^2$) Intracluster Medium (ICM) is limited by the Alfvén speed, $v_{a,ICM}=c_{s,ICM}/\beta^{1/2}\sim 10^7\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$, GHz-emitting electrons can travel only $l \sim v_{a,ICM}t_r\sim 10\,kpc$ relative to the underlying plasma. Yet, elongated structures spanning hundreds of kpc or even a few Mpc are observed, requiring either a re-acceleration mechanism or another form of synchronization, e.g., by a large-scale shock. We argue that filaments with ordered magnetic fields supported by non-thermal pressure have $v_{a}\gg v_{a,{\rm ICM}}$ and so can provide such a synchronization even without re-acceleration or shocks. In particular, along quasi-stationary filaments, electrons can propagate without experiencing adiabatic losses, and their velocity is not limited by the Alfvén or sound speeds of the ambient thermal plasma. This model predicts that along filaments that span significant pressure gradients, e.g., in the cores of galaxy clusters, the synchrotron break frequency $\nu_b\propto B$ should scale with the ambient gas pressure as $P^{1/2}$, and the emission from such filaments should be strongly polarized. While some of these structures can be observed as "filaments", i.e., long and narrow bright structures, others can be unresolved and have a collective appearance of a diffuse structure, or be too faint to be detected, while still providing channels for electrons' propagation.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Technetium (Tc)-rich M-type stars have been known for over 45 years. However, the origin of Tc in these stars, particularly its detection without the concomitant detection of other s-process elements, typically produced during the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) s-process nucleosynthesis, remains poorly understood. Technetium was first identified in the spectra of S-type stars (which exhibit prominent ZrO bands) in 1952. The simultaneous enrichment of both Zr and Tc is well understood within the framework of s-process nucleosynthesis, which occurs during the AGB phase. However, despite being known for 45 years, Tc-rich M stars remain an enigma, as M-type stars are typically not enriched in heavy elements. Aims. This study aims at analyzing high-resolution spectra of a large sample of M-type stars to examine their spectral characteristics, and to compare their spectral properties with those of Tc-rich S-type stars in an attempt to understand the origin of their difference. Methods. We define a robust classification scheme to assign M stars to the Tc-rich or Tc-poor class. We compute nucleosynthesis models to trace the evolution of Zr and Tc abundances across successive thermal pulses during the AGB phase. We further analyze spectral indices measuring the depth of the TiO and ZrO bands as well as the wavelength of the Tc blend on both synthetic and observed spectra. Results. The Tc lines in Tc-rich M stars are similar to those in S stars. However, Tc-rich M stars exhibit stronger TiO bands than S stars while displaying similarly strong ZrO bands. Spectral synthesis, together with location in the HR diagram and spatial properties suggest that Tc-rich M stars may have slightly lower metallicity and lower masses than Tc-rich S stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Determining the processes by which galaxies transition from a star-forming to a quiescent state (quenching) is paramount to our understanding of galaxy evolution. One of the key mechanisms by which this takes place is via a galaxy's interactions with a local, over-dense environment (satellite or environmental quenching). In the very local Universe, we see these processes in action, and can also observe their effects via the distribution of satellite galaxy properties. However, extending similar analyses outside of the local Universe is problematic, largely due to the difficulties in robustly defining environments with small and/or incomplete spectroscopic samples. We use new environmental metrics from the high-completeness Deep Extragalactic VIsible Legacy Survey (DEVILS) to explore the properties of satellite galaxies at intermediate redshift (0.3$<$z$<$0.5) and compare directly to the Galaxy And Mass Assembly Survey (GAMA) at 0$<$z$<$0.2. Importantly, both the galaxy properties and environmental metrics in DEVILS and GAMA are derived in an identical manner, reducing any methodology biases. We find: i) that satellite galaxies in DEVILS and GAMA show suppressed star-formation in comparison to isolated systems at the same stellar mass, by $\sim$0.5dex in log$_{10}$(SFR/M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$), ii) that this suppression is strongest in higher mass dark matter halos (up to $\sim$1dex in log$_{10}$(SFR/M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$) in the most massive halos) and iii) that at fixed stellar and halo mass, this suppression increases with time - with satellite passive fractions increasing by $\sim$10-15\% over the last $\sim$5Gyr. This is consistent with previous observations and numerical simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 The parameter space for mass loss in Type Ia supernova progenitors is large, with different progenitor scenarios favoring different mass loss regimes. Here we focus on the impact that uniform and isotropic outflows have on the circumstellar environment of Type Ia supernova progenitors. We vary mass loss rate, wind velocity, and outflow duration, and evolve supernova remnant (SNR) models in this grid of circumstellar structures in order to compare the bulk properties of these models (ages, radii, and \feka\ centroids and luminosities) to observations. We find that roughly 50\% of young Type Ia SNRs in the Milky Way and the Large Magellanic Cloud had progenitors that did not substantially modify their surroundings on $\sim$pc scales. This group includes SN Ia with a range of luminosities, and at least some likely products of double detonation explosions in sub-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs. The other half of our sample can be divided in two distinct classes. A small subset of SNRs ($\sim$15\%) have large radii and low \feka\ centroids and are likely expanding into large cavities excavated by fast ($\sim$1000 km/s), sustained progenitor outflows. The majority of the SNRs that are expanding into a modified medium ($\sim35\%$) show evidence for dense material, likely associated with slow ($\sim$10 km/s) progenitor outflows, possibly a byproduct of accretion processes in near-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs spawned by younger stellar populations.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper investigates the symmetry and magnetic field properties of the jets in the radio galaxy NGC 1052, with particular attention to the impact of the ionized torus that surrounds the central region on the emitted radiation. Our study is based on three new 43 GHz Very-Long-Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations and one 86 GHz observation conducted between April 2021 and April 2022. We derive key jet parameters, such as speed, width, and flux density for both jets at the two frequencies and compare them with those obtained from previous VLBI campaigns. Additionally, we present the first (43-86) GHz spectral index image of NGC 1052, which is crucial to assess the role of the torus at high frequencies. Finally, we leverage the derived observational parameters to constrain the magnetic field strength and configuration in the launched jets. We observe variability in the jet morphology at 43 GHz across the three epochs, which can be associated with the propagation of jet knots launched from the nuclear region. The stacked 43 GHz image reveals that the western and receding jet is approximately three times fainter than its eastern (approaching) counterpart in the sub-mas region. This asymmetry, together with the (43-86) GHz spectral index map, suggests that free-free absorption may affect the 43 GHz emission. On the contrary, the jets appear highly symmetric at 86 GHz. From the stacked images at 43 GHz and 86 GHz, we extract the jet width, which is consistent with previous VLBI studies and supports the presence of a parabolic jet profile on very compact scales. Overall, our results suggest that the jets are intrinsically launched symmetrically, and that the observed time-dependent asymmetries may result from free-free absorption by the torus and the downstream propagation of jet components, a scenario supported by previous theoretical studies.

 Despite their discovery fifteen years ago, the nature and origin of the Fermi bubbles remain unclear. We here investigate the effect a magnetic field can have on a subsonic breeze outflow emanating from the Galactic centre region. The presence of this magnetic field allows anisotropic diffusion of cosmic rays within the outflow, shaping the resultant cosmic ray distribution obtained out at large distances within the Galactic halo. We show that our magnetohydrodynamic Galactic breeze model, in combination with an opening angle for the injection of cosmic rays, leads to $\gamma$-ray emission from the Fermi bubble region with relatively sharp edges.

 In the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, the masses of the galaxy clusters inferred using background galaxies via weak-lensing shear should agree with the masses measured using the galaxy projected radius-velocity phase-space data via the escape velocity profile. However, prior work indicates that the correlation between caustic-inferred escape masses and weak lensing masses is statistically consistent with zero. Based on recent advancements in the measurement of the escape edge and its physical interpretation, we conduct a revised comparison between these two independent mass inference techniques for 46 galaxy clusters between $0.05 \le z \le 0.3$ and over an order of magnitude in mass, $14.4 \le {\rm log}_{10} M/M_{\odot} \le 15.4$. We find excellent agreement, with a correlation ($0.679^{+0.046}_{-0.049}$), and a mean relative difference between the two mass measurements consistent with zero (0.02 $\pm$ 0.02 dex). The observed scatter between these direct mass estimates is 0.17 dex and is consistent with the reported individual mass errors, suggesting that there is no need for an additional intrinsic component. We discuss the important practical consequences of these results, focusing on the systematic uncertainties inherent to each technique, and their implications for cosmology.

 - **Abstract**
 Most of the ionized mass in the Milky Way is in the Warm Ionized Medium (WIM) and not in the bright H~II regions. The WIM is traced by dispersion measure and has been extensively studied in recombination lines (primarily, H$\alpha$) and optical nebular lines (primarily, S+ and N+). The observations can be well explained by a photo-ionized nebula with a low ionization parameter. It is generally thought that the source of ionization (and heating) of the WIM is due to Lyman continuum leaking from HII regions which are concentrated in the Galactic plane. The rays of the diffuse Galactic Lyman-continuum radiation field incident on the Warm Neutral Medium (WNM) are absorbed, forming an ionized skin. In nebulae with low-ionization parameter the transition from ionized gas to neutral gas is gradual, unlike the case for HII regions with their sharp Stromgren spheres. The transition region is warm enough to excite oxygen and nitrogen atoms to emit [OI] 6300,6363 and [NI] 5198,5200. Domgorgen & Mathis (1994) recognized the value of [OI] 6300 as a diagnostic of the fraction of the diffuse continuum that is absorbed by the WNM and therefore constrains the fraction of the diffuse Lyman continuum that escapes to the halo. Unfortunately, observations of Galactic [OI] 6300 have been stymied by bright [OI] 6300 airglow emission. [NI] 5200,5198 has been a historically less popular probe because this doublet is less luminous than the oxygen doublet. However, we point out that the [NI] airglow is two orders of magnitude smaller than that of [OI]. Furthermore, even in the presence of comparable airglow, the WIM [NI] emission can be inferred using the doublet intensity ratio for which a medium-resolution spectrometer such as the Local Volume Mapper will suffice. Separately, we note, in extragalactic systems, that [OI]6300/[NI]5200 is a robust measure of the O/N abundance ratio.

 - **Abstract**
 We present $\texttt{PyBird-JAX}$, a differentiable, $\texttt{JAX}$-based implementation of $\texttt{PyBird}$, using internal neural network emulators to accelerate computationally costly operations for rapid large-scale structure (LSS) analysis. $\texttt{PyBird-JAX}$ computes one-loop EFTofLSS predictions for redshift-space galaxy power spectrum multipoles in 1.2 ms on a CPU and 0.2 ms on a GPU, achieving 3-4 orders of magnitude speed-up over $\texttt{PyBird}$. The emulators take a compact spline-based representation of the input linear power spectrum $P(k)$ as feature vectors, making the approach applicable to a wide range of cosmological models. We rigorously validate its accuracy against large-volume simulations and on BOSS data, including cosmologies not explicitly represented in the training set. Leveraging automatic differentiation, $\texttt{PyBird-JAX}$ supports Fisher forecasting, Taylor expansion of model predictions, gradient-based searches, and vectorised ensemble sampling. Interfaced with a variety of samplers and Boltzmann solvers, $\texttt{PyBird-JAX}$ provides a high-performance, end-to-end inference pipeline. Combined with a symbolic-$P(k)$ generator, a typical Stage-4 LSS MCMC converges in minutes on a GPU. Our results demonstrate that $\texttt{PyBird-JAX}$ delivers the precision and speed required for upcoming LSS surveys, opening the door to accelerated cosmological inference with minimal accuracy loss and no pretraining. In a companion paper [1], we put $\texttt{PyBird-JAX}$ to use in achieving LSS marginalised constraints free from volume projection effects through non-flat measures.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy mergers and interactions have long been suggested as a significant driver of galaxy evolution. However, the exact extent to which mergers enhance star formation and AGN activity has been challenging to establish observationally. In previous work, we visually classified a sample of galaxies with various types of faint tidal features in DECaLS images. In this paper, we cross-correlate this sample with a principal component analysis of Sloan Digital Sky Survey data to investigate how the presence of these features, as well as their specific nature, correlates with intense star formation and AGN activity. Averaged over all tidal classes, we find that tidal feature galaxies are 10.3$\pm$1.5 times more likely to be in a starburst phase, and 24.3$\pm$5.0 times more likely to have rapidly quenched (post-starbursts), than those in a mass-matched control sample. Examining differences between tidal classes, galaxies with \textit{arm} features are 1.4$\pm$0.2 times more likely to be starbursting than the other categories, while those with \textit{shell} features are 2.7$\pm$0.6 times more likely to be in a quiescent state. In a similar analysis, we identify which galaxies show evidence of AGN activity and find no significant difference between the fraction of those with or without tidal features. Overall, our results reinforce the notion that mergers play an important role in driving star formation and rapid quenching in galaxies, and provide some of the first empirical evidence that the strength of this effect has a dependence on the detailed nature of the interaction, as traced by the tidal feature morphology.
