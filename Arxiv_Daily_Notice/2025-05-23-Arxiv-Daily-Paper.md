 - **Abstract**
 Binary stars containing a white dwarf and a main-sequence star, WDMS binaries, can be used to study a wide range of aspects of stellar astrophysics. We build a magnitude-limited sample of unresolved WDMS binaries from Gaia DR3 to enlarge these studies. We look for WDMS with available spectra whose location in the Gaia colour-magnitude diagram bridges between the evolutionary sequences of single white dwarfs and the main-sequence. To exclude spurious sources we apply quality cuts on the Gaia photometry and astrometry and we fit the SED (spectral energy distribution) of the objects with VOSA (Virtual Observatory SED Analyser) to exclude single sources. We further clean the sample via visual inspection of the Gaia spectra and publicly available images of the objects. We re-fit the SEDs of the finally selected WDMS with VOSA using composite models to measure their stellar parameters and we search for eclipsing systems by inspecting available ZTF and CRTS light curves. The catalogue consists of 1312 WDMS and we manage to derive stellar parameters for 435. This is because most WDMS are dominated by the main-sequence companions, making it hard to derive parameters for the white dwarfs. We also identify 67 eclipsing systems and estimate a lower limit to the completeness of the sample to be ~50% (~5% if we consider that not all WDMS in the studied region have Gaia spectra). Our catalogue increases by one order of magnitude the volume-limited sample we presented in our previous work. Despite the fact that the sample is incomplete and suffers from heavy observational biases, it is well characterised and can therefore be used to further constrain binary evolution by comparing the observed properties to those from synthetic samples obtained modeling the WDMS population in the Galaxy, taking into account all selection effects.
#### The alternating 'changing-look' blazar OQ 334 (B2 1420+32): New observational clues to the blazar state transitions

 - **Abstract**
 The high-luminosity blazar OQ 334 is a leading exponent of the intriguing rare phenomenon of alternating between a flat-spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) and a BL Lac (BLL) states. Its two optical continuum outbursts observed during the $\sim$ 1.5-year long time span, starting Jan 2018, had been shown to coincide with transition from the FSRQ to BLL state, manifested by a sharp drop in the equivalent width of MgII broad emission-line. Recently, a continuous monitoring of its blazar state, over a much longer duration (past $\sim$ 5 years) has become possible by deploying the observed $\gamma-ray$ spectral slope ($\Gamma_{\gamma}$) as a diagnostic. This opens prospects of making a much less biased and statistically more robust check on the association of optical flaring with FSRQ $\rightarrow$ BLL transition. We find that all 4 such transitions ($\Gamma_{\gamma}$ becoming < 2.0), observed during the past $\sim$ 5 years, were accompanied by an optical flare. While this appears consistent with the transition to BL Lac state happening purely due to an enhanced optical continuum (flaring) swamping out the broad emission-lines, this simple scheme may need additional ingredients, considering the hint found for a day-like offset between the flaring and the state transition.

 - **Abstract**
 Luminous quasars at $z>4$ provide key insights into the early Universe. Their rarity necessitates wide-field multi-band surveys to efficiently separate them from the main astrophysical contaminants (i.e., ultracool dwarfs). To expand the sample of high-$z$ quasars, we conducted targeted selections using optical, infrared, and radio surveys, complemented by literature-based quasar candidate catalogs. In this paper, we report the discovery of \nqsos\ new quasars at $4.6<z<6.9$ (six at $z\geq6.5$), with $M_{1450}$ between $-$25.4 and $-$27.0. We also present new spectra of six $z>6.5$ quasars we selected, but whose independent discovery has already been published in the literature. Three of the newly discovered quasars are strong radio emitters (L$_{1.4~\rm GHz}$$=0.09-1.0\times$10$^{34}$erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$). Among them, one source at $z=4.71$ exhibits typical blazar-like properties, including a flat radio spectrum, radio-loudness $\sim$1000, and multi-frequency variability. It is also detected by SRG/eROSITA X-ray telescope (f$_{\rm 0.2-2.3keV} \sim 1.3\times10^{-13}$erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$). In addition, for seven $6.3<z<6.9$ quasars we present near-infrared spectroscopy and estimate the central black hole mass from their C$\rm IV$ and Mg$\rm II$ broad emission this http URL masses (log[M$_{\rm BH,MgII}$]$=8.58-9.14~\rm M_{\odot}$) and Eddington ratios ($\lambda_{\rm Edd,MgII}=0.74-2.2$) are consistent with other $z>6$ quasars reported in the literature. A $z = 6.3$ quasar exhibits a velocity difference of approximately $9000$ km s$^{-1}$ between the C$\rm IV$ and Mg$\rm II$ emission lines, making it one of the most extreme C$\rm IV$ outflows currently known. Additionally, the sample includes three high-ionization broad absorption line quasars. One of these quasars shows potential evidence of an extremely fast outflow feature, reaching $48000$ km s$^{-1}$.

 - **Abstract**
 The detailed study of gas flows in local Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) is essential for understanding the regulation of star formation and black hole growth, which are fundamental to galaxy evolution. One such AGN case study is NGC 5643, a nearby ($D_{L}\sim17.3$ Mpc) star-forming, late-type, Seyfert galaxy, where inflows and outflows have been observed in detail. NGC 5643 has been studied at multiple wavelengths, however, a key missing component is sensitive, high-resolution neutral hydrogen ($\mathrm{H\,I}$) observations. We present 21-cm observations of NGC 5643 with MeerKAT, revealing six low-$\mathrm{H\,I}$ mass ($M_{\text{$\mathrm{H\,I}$}}\sim10^{7} M_\odot$) sources surrounding NGC 5643 and $\mathrm{H\,I}$ in IC 4444, $\sim230$ kpc north of NGC 5643. In NGC 5643, $\mathrm{H\,I}$ extends beyond the stellar disk with several morphological and kinematical asymmetries. North of the disk is an extended 30 kpc tail with counter-rotating velocities. This is $\mathrm{H\,I}$ gas accreting onto the regularly rotating disk of NGC 5643 from the environment. Within the spiral arms of the disk, we identify extraplanar gas components, tracing galactic fountains driven by star formation regions. These fountains have a molecular gas component and show an increased $\mathrm{H}_2$/$\mathrm{H\,I}$ ratio. In the circum-nuclear region, we observe spatially unresolved $\mathrm{H\,I}$ absorption that is slightly blue-shifted ($\sim72$ \kms) with an $\mathrm{H\,I}$ emission counterpart at redshifted velocities. These MeerKAT observations provide a complete census of the $\mathrm{H\,I}$ in and around this nearby Seyfert galaxy, providing missing information on the cold gas flows fuelling the star formation and nuclear activity.

 - **Abstract**
 The dwarf galaxy Peekaboo was recently identified as a Local Volume (LV) gas-rich and 'eXtremely Metal-Poor' (XMP) dIrr. Its gas metallicity is Z~Zsun/50, with +/-1$\sigma$ uncertainty range of [Zsun/72-Zsun/35]). Its the "Tip of Red Giant Stars" (TRGB)-based distance is of 6.8$\pm$0.7 Mpc. HST data for its individual stars reveal that its older RGB stars comprise a smaller part, while the majority of visible stars have ages of less than one to a few Gyr. Thus, Peekaboo dwarf can be considered as the nearest record-low-Z dwarf. As such, the galaxy deserves a deeper multi-method study, including properties of both, young massive stars and the fainter older population, and its ionised gas and the dominant baryonic component of HI gas. We use the direct (Te) method for the east HII region, in which the [OIII]4363A line is well detected, to estimate its parameter 12+log(O/H). Since in the west HII region the line [OIII]4363A is not detected, its O/H is estimated via the empirical "strong-line" method. The resulting value of O/H is very close to that in the east HII region. The new spectroscopy of Peekaboo dwarf allows us to improve substantially the accuracy of its direct O/H estimate, which appears of 12+log(O/H) = 6.99$\pm$0.06. The new data reveal that emission lines in the E region consist of two components with the velocity difference of ~65 km/s. The fainter, approaching, component can be related to a fast-moving WR star thrown from a cluster or a binary system. Using the HST $V$ magnitudes and colour $V-I$, we identify tentative O-type and very hot candidate WO stars, which are likely the ionising stars of the studied HII regions. With the new optical spectra, the Peekaboo galaxy is confirmed as the lowest-metallicity dwarf in the Local Volume and the valuable object for indeep multi-method studies.

 - **Abstract**
 The possibility of the emergence of a stratified region in the uppermost part of the Earth's outer core with long-term magnetic field generation is assessed, taking into account uncertainties in the thermal conductivity of the Earth's core and the present-day heat flow across the core-mantle boundary (CMB). The radial structures of the Earth's outer core are calculated for various values of thermal conductivity and CMB heat flow using a one-dimensional thermo-chemical model. The results show that there exist solutions that allow both emergence of stable stratification and long-term magnetic field generation although their thickness of stratified region is thinner than 100 km. In order to satisfy both emergence of stratified region and long-term magnetic field generation, possible value of the present-day CMB heat flow (13-15 TW) suggests a thermal conductivity of 77-121 W/m/K at CMB, which is in good agreement with the values estimated from the electrical conductivity measurements under the Earth' s core condition. The thickness of the stratified region in this case is about 50 km, which is also consistent with the thickness of the stratified region estimated from the geomagnetic secular variation. However, the proposed values of thermal conductivity obtained by this analysis could be smaller when the present-day CMB heat flow becomes smaller than the constraint used in this study.

 - **Abstract**
 Formaldehyde (H$_2$CO) and methanol (CH$_3$OH) have served as traditional tracers of the star formation process for decades. Studies of the environments which produce these species, though, have pointed to significant differences in the physical environments within which each molecule resides. In this paper we investigate the physical and chemical conditions which give rise to formaldehyde and methanol emission in the nearby starburst galaxy NGC 253. We employ high spatial (1.$''$6 or $\sim28$ pc) and spectral ($\sim10$ km/s) imaging of the NGC 253 central molecular zone (CMZ) from the ALCHEMI Large Program to constrain radiative transfer models of the dense gas volume density, and temperature, molecular species column density, and source filling factor within eight giant molecular clouds (GMCs). We also measure the relative abundances of the two nuclear spin isomers of CH$_3$OH to investigate its formation history. The physical and chemical conditions derived clearly indicate that H$_2$CO and CH$_3$OH originate from distinct physical environments. H$_2$CO traces low volume density and high kinetic temperatures, while CH$_3$OH traces high volume density and low kinetic temperatures. The H$_2$CO abundances are constant, though poorly constrained, within the eight NGC 253 GMCs analyzed, while the CH$_3$OH abundance shows a radial gradient from low to high values within the NGC 253 CMZ. Our findings highlight the complex chemical and physical differentiation of CH$_3$OH and H$_2$CO in the starburst environment of NGC 253. Methanol formation appears to be influenced by warm, dynamic processes rather than cold cloud chemistry, while formaldehyde primarily forms via gas-phase reactions. These results challenge the assumption of a direct chemical link between CH$_3$OH and H$_2$CO and underscores the impact of starburst-driven shocks, turbulence, and cosmic rays on molecular gas chemistry.

 - **Abstract**
 Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) published for the first time epoch photometry, BP/RP (XP) low-resolution mean spectra, and supervised classification results for millions of variable sources. This extensive dataset offers a unique opportunity to study their variability by combining multiple Gaia data products. In preparation for DR4, we propose and evaluate a machine learning methodology capable of ingesting multiple Gaia data products to achieve an unsupervised classification of stellar and quasar variability. A dataset of 4 million Gaia DR3 sources is used to train three variational autoencoders (VAE), which are artificial neural networks (ANNs) designed for data compression and generation. One VAE is trained on Gaia XP low-resolution spectra, another on a novel approach based on the distribution of magnitude differences in the Gaia G band, and the third on folded Gaia G band light curves. Each Gaia source is compressed into 15 numbers, representing the coordinates in a 15-dimensional latent space generated by combining the outputs of these three models. The learned latent representation produced by the ANN effectively distinguishes between the main variability classes present in Gaia DR3, as demonstrated through both supervised and unsupervised classification analysis of the latent space. The results highlight a strong synergy between light curves and low-resolution spectral data, emphasising the benefits of combining the different Gaia data products. A two-dimensional projection of the latent variables reveals numerous overdensities, most of which strongly correlate with astrophysical properties, showing the potential of this latent space for astrophysical discovery. We show that the properties of our novel latent representation make it highly valuable for variability analysis tasks, including classification, clustering and outlier detection.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the impact of dark matter on the structure and deformation of magnetars. We assume a perturbative approach for the magnetic field deformation and that the dark matter only interacts gravitationally with hardonic matter. Assuming that the DM is significantly softer than HM, we find that the magnetic field can affect dark matter through the deformation of space-time. The number of stars having a dark matter halo outside the hadronic matter surface increases with an increase in dark matter fraction and the stiffness of the dark matter equation of state. As the magnetic field deforms the stars from sphericity, we can have a situation where we have a non-symmetric dark matter halo outside the star. This can have interesting observational gravitational signatures unique to magnetars with having DM halo.

 - **Abstract**
 Relativistic jets can be produced within the accretion disk of an active galactic nucleus (AGN), leading to distinct thermal emission as they propagate through a dense disk environment. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of dynamical evolution of jets embedded in an AGN disk and their associated observational properties, focusing on scenarios in which jets either successfully break out of the disk or become choked. By modeling the jet-cocoon system propagation, we calculate the thermal emission contributions from the jet-head shock breakout, disk cocoon, and jet cocoon components. Our results reveal that soft X-ray flares are the most prominent observable signatures, with duration ranging from O(10^2) s to O(10^5) s, occasionally exhibiting double-peaked light curves, whereas UV/optical flares are detectable only for powerful jets, persisting for several days to tens of days. This thermal emission serves as a critical electromagnetic counterpart to jet-producing events and provide insights into jet dynamics and AGN disk properties. Our findings highlight the importance of multi-wavelength follow-up observations to establish a diagnostic paradigm for candidate electromagnetic counterpart identification to AGN-embedded events and to distinguish thermal flares from AGN background variability.

 - **Abstract**
 Weak lensing alters galaxy sizes and fluxes, influencing the clustering patterns of galaxies through cosmic magnification. This effect enables the reconstruction of weak lensing convergence $\hat{\kappa}$ maps for DES and DECaLS by linearly combining galaxy overdensities across magnitude bins in the $g$, $r$, and $z$ photometry bands \citep{Qin+,Qin2+}. In this study, we enhance the lensing reconstruction method by addressing biases in the magnification coefficient estimation, which arise from incomplete consideration of selection effects, especially those induced by photometric redshift (photo-$z$) selection. Using a Random Forest-based photo-$z$ estimation for DECaLS and DES galaxies, we quantify the impact of photo-$z$ induced selection on magnification coefficient estimation. Our results show that neglecting photo-$z$ selection introduces significant biases in the magnification coefficient, leading to deviations in the reconstructed convergence map amplitude $A$, with values ranging from 0.4 to 3.5 depending on the survey, redshift, and magnitude cuts. By incorporating an improved magnification coefficient estimation that accounts for photo-$z$ selection, these biases are significantly reduced, with $A$ converging to $\sim 1$ as the magnitude cuts approach optimal values. This improvement is consistently observed across DES and DECaLS datasets and redshift bins, despite differences in survey strategies and depths. Our findings highlight the importance of addressing photo-$z$ induced selection to achieve unbiased weak lensing reconstructions and accurate cosmic magnification measurements.

 - **Abstract**
 Identifying AGNs in dwarf galaxies is critical for understanding black hole formation but remains challenging due to their low luminosities, low metallicities, and star formation-driven emission that can obscure AGN signatures. Machine learning (ML) techniques, particularly unsupervised methods, offer new ways to address these challenges by uncovering patterns in complex data. In this study, we apply Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) to explore the SED manifold of dwarf galaxies and evaluate AGN selection biases across diagnostics. We train a 51 by 51 SOM on 30,344 dwarf galaxies (redshift less than 0.055 and stellar mass below 10 to the 9.5 solar masses) from the NSA catalog using nine-band photometry from near-UV to mid-infrared. A set of 438 previously identified dwarf AGNs, selected via various methods, was mapped onto the SOM. AGNs identified by different methods occupy distinct and partially overlapping regions in SED space, reflecting selection biases tied to host properties. BPT selected AGNs cluster in higher-mass regions, while X-ray and variability-selected AGNs show broader distributions. WISE-selected AGNs are concentrated in lower-mass regions and form two clumps: one associated with bluer, starburst-like systems and the other with redder, more AGN-like SEDs. This separation may help distinguish true AGN hosts from starburst contaminants in WISE-selected samples. AGNs selected via traditional emission-line, broad-line, and WISE methods tend to avoid SOM regions linked to strong star formation. In contrast, a subset of AGNs in low-mass galaxies occupy regions indicative of high AGN luminosity relative to stellar content, highlighting luminous AGNs in faint hosts. These results demonstrate the utility of manifold learning for improving AGN selection in the low-mass regime.

 - **Abstract**
 M dwarfs are the most abundant stars in the Galaxy and serve as key targets for stellar and exoplanetary studies. It is particularly challenging to determine their metallicities because their spectra are complex. For this reason, several authors have focused on photometric estimates of the M-dwarf metallicity. Although artificial neural networks have been used in the framework of modern astrophysics, their application to a photometric metallicity estimate for M dwarfs remains unexplored. We develop an accurate method for estimating the photometric metallicities of M dwarfs using artificial neural networks to address the limitations of traditional empirical approaches. We trained a neural network on a dataset of M dwarfs with spectroscopically derived metallicities. We used eight absolute magnitudes in the visible and infrared from Gaia, 2MASS, and WISE as input features. Batch normalization and dropout regularization stabilized the training and prevented overfitting. We applied the Monte Carlo dropout technique to obtain more robust predictions. The neural network demonstrated a strong performance in estimating photometric metallicities for M dwarfs in the range of -0.45<[Fe/H]<0.45dex and for spectral types as late as M5.0V. On the test sample, the predictions showed uncertainties down to 0.08dex. This surpasses the accuracy of previous methods. We further validated our results using an additional sample of 46 M dwarfs in wide binary systems with FGK-type primary stars with well-defined metallicities and achieved an excellent predictive performance that surpassed the 0.1dex error threshold. This study introduces a ML-based framework for estimating the photometric metallicities of M dwarfs and provides a scalable data-driven solution for analyzing large photometric surveys. The results outline the potential of artificial neural networks to enhance the determination of stellar parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 In the axion model, electromagnetic waves interacting with axions induce frequency-dependent time delays, determined by the axion mass and decay constant. These small delays are difficult to detect, making traditional methods ineffective. To address this, we computed time delays for various parameters and found a prominent dispersion signal when the wave frequency equals half the axion mass. Based on this, we developed a machine learning-based pipeline, achieving 95\% classification accuracy and demonstrating strong detection capability in low signal-to-noise data. Applying this to PSR J1933-6211, we found no axion-induced delays within current sensitivity limits. While existing constraints are limited by atomic clock resolution in radio telescopes, future advances in optical clocks and broader bandwidths will enable more extensive searches. In particular, combining high-precision optical clocks with next-generation radio telescopes, such as the Qitai Radio Telescope, could improve decay constant constraints by four orders of magnitude for axion masses in the $10^{-6} \sim 10^{-4}$ eV range.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetothermal (MHD) winds and jets originate in a wide range of regions of protoplanetary disks (1-30 au) and are thought to be the primary mechanisms driving accretion onto the central star. One indirect signature of these processes is the free-free emission from ionized gas close to the star. We analyze a sample of 31 Class II disks: 18 full disks (FD) and 13 transition disks (TD). All sources show evidence of excess free-free emission over the contribution of the thermal dust. We investigate the origin of this emission and whether it is associated with other observables. We first analyzed a sample of objects in Taurus, exploring correlations with the properties of the central star, the disk, and other disk-wind tracers. We compared our findings with a sample of TD for which free-free emission was shown to be likely associated with an MHD-wind/jet. We found no correlation between the detected free-free emission and either the X-ray or the [OI]6300A line properties. We found a strong correlation between the ionized mass loss rate, as inferred from the free-free emission, and the accretion rate, suggesting that free-free emission in FD is associated with an MHD-wind/jet. The detected free-free emission in both TD and FD is likely similarly associated with an ionized gas close to the star from an MHD-wind/jet. The free-free emission detected in TD shows hints of shallower correlations with accretion properties than in FD. Whereas the efficiency in transforming accretion into outflow might differ in TD and FD, considering the correlations between free-free emission and accretion properties, this difference could simply result from a bias toward strong accretors in the TD sample. Therefore, observations of a more complete and uniform sample are necessary to determine whether this change in correlations holds only for strong accretors or for TD in general.

 - **Abstract**
 The computation of magnitudes and distances from low signal-to-noise observations is known to be problematic, in the sense that the magnitudes and distances tend to assume extreme values, or are even undefined or unphysical in the case of negative observed fluxes or parallaxes. In this work we show that magnitudes can be computed consistently at all signal-to-noise levels, and even for negative fluxes, if the prior information that the true flux or distance is non-negative is properly included. Furthermore, we derive an all-purpose estimator for distances from a prior implementing only the non-negativity of the true parallax. We apply our results to the case of combining magnitudes to colours, and magnitudes and distances to obtain absolute magnitudes. The resulting expressions are easy to compute and we show that the resulting distribution functions for magnitudes, colours, distances, and absolute magnitudes are not only consistent for all signal-to-noise levels and applicable to both, positive and negative observed fluxes and parallaxes, but also show no strong tails. While biases at very low signal-to-noise levels are unavoidable, the estimator for distances derived in this work is less biased than previously used estimators. We find that the magnitude, colour, distance, and absolute magnitude distributions for vanishing signals converge to limiting distributions, whose median values are important for assessing biases when working with data at low signal-to-noise levels.

 - **Abstract**
 It is still unknown how much water has escaped from Mars during its history. Hydrogen escape from Mars's atmosphere probably played a major role in drying the planet, but present-day Hloss rates (about 3x10^26 atoms per second on average) cannot explain the geological evidence for the large volumes of liquid water on ancient Mars. Here we used the three-dimensional Mars-Planetary Climate Model to show that H loss rates could have increased by more than one order of magnitude (6x10^27 atoms per second) during higher spin axis obliquity periods, notably in the last few million years when Mars's obliquity was about 35 deg on average. The resulting accumulated H escape over Mars's history translates into an approx. 80 m global equivalent layer, which is close to the lower limit of geological estimates, assessing the major role of atmospheric escape in drying Mars.

 - **Abstract**
 The observed power-law spectra of relativistic jets from active galactic nuclei clearly indicate a synchrotron mechanism of radiation by particles that similarly possess a power-law energy spectrum. However, the issue of their angular anisotropy has not been given sufficient attention until recently, although the example of the solar wind (where a strongly magnetized wind is realized in a similar way) shows the importance of taking this circumstance into account. In this paper, we study the evolution of an initially isotropic power-law spectrum of radiating particles as they propagate along expanding relativistic jets. It is shown that for relativistic flows in which the electric field plays a crucial role, the preservation of the first adiabatic invariant does not lead to a decrease in the pitch angles of radiating particles as they enter the region of weak magnetic fields. This is due to the drift nature of the particle motion.

 - **Abstract**
 Herbig Ae/Be stars are young, pre-main-sequence stars that provide critical insights into the processes of stellar formation, early stellar evolution and protoplanetary this http URL of the key features of such stars are their circumstellar dusty disk and bipolar ionized outflows, which are key components for understanding planet formation processes and energy/matter deposition in the interstellar medium, respectively. In this context, imaging polarimetry is probably the sharpest tool to characterize the various structures and dynamics around the central star, due to the sensitivity of polarization to the morphology of the emitting, scattering and absorbing media. We take advantage of never published, near-ultraviolet polarimetric data of LK-H{\alpha}-233 taken by the Faint Object Camera aboard the Hubble Space Telescope in 1991, 1994 and 1995, which remained dormant in the archives despite their quality. Using the most recent and robust reduction pipeline for this instrument, we obtained high spatial resolution (0.0287 x 0.0287 arcsecond2) maps of this object at 4118 Å, together with polarimetric measurements. A dark lane, bisecting the approaching and receding polar outflows, suggests the presence of a circumstellar disk or dust torus, obscuring the pre-main sequence star and collimating the ejecta. Polarization reveals that the outflows have an X-shape structure with a significant centro-symmetric pattern in polarization angle, indicating that the outflows are both hollow and scattering the emission from the buried star. We constrain the half-opening angle of both the outflows and circumstellar disk, determine the inclination of the system and estimate the obscured star's intrinsic flux. This study highlights the importance of high-resolution polarimetric observations in understanding the complex environment around Herbig Ae/Be stars and advocates for future similar instruments.
#### Impacts of Tidal Locking on Magnetospheric Energy Input to Exoplanet Atmospheres

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the effect of planetary corotation on energy dissipation within the magnetosphere-ionosphere system of exoplanets. Using MHD simulations, we find that tidally locked exoplanets have a higher cross-polar cap potential (CPCP) compared to fast-rotating planets with the same magnetic field strength, confirming previous studies. Our simulations show that for a given interplanetary magnetic field, an increase in corotation period leads to a higher CPCP. Notably, this difference in CPCP between tidally locked and rotating planets persists across a range of solar wind conditions, including extreme environments such as those experienced by hot Jupiters. Furthermore, we observe that variations in corotation have little impact on CPCP for Earth-sized planets. These results underscore the significance of both corotation dynamics and planetary size in understanding how exoplanets interact with their stellar environments.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) as a potential source of the parity-violating signatures recently implied by observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies and the large-scale structure of the Universe. Among various possibilities, helical PMFs are of particular interest, as they inherently violate parity symmetry and can explain the observed magnetic fields, especially in void regions. PMFs, if generated in the early universe, can source curvature perturbations, which evolve into the present density fluctuations observed in galaxy surveys. Motivated by this, we focus on the imprint of helical PMFs on the trispectrum of the sourced primordial curvature perturbations, a leading-order statistics sensitive to parity-violating signals in three-dimensional space. We derive the analytic expressions for the trispectrum of the primordial curvature perturbations sourced by taking into account both the helical and non-helical PMFs and analytically reduce their expressions by using the pole approximation, whose validity is confirmed by comparison with the exact results. We find that, varying the ratio of the amplitude of the helical to non-helical power spectrum, the structure of the trispectrum qualitatively changes, particularly the ratio of the imaginary to real components of the trispectrum. Our findings highlight the primordial trispectrum as a promising probe of cosmological parity violation in the early universe and provide a theoretical basis for future precise observations of higher order statistics in the CMB anisotropies and the galaxy clustering.

 - **Abstract**
 AGNs exhibit a wide range of black hole masses and inflow/outflow properties. It is now possible to probe regions close to the event horizons of nearby SMBHs using VLBI with earth-sized baselines, as performed by the EHT. This study explores the emission properties of accretion and outflows near the event horizon of both low-mass and high-mass SMBHs. Using resistive GR-MHD simulations, we model AGNs with thin Keplerian disks. This contrasts with widely studied models featuring thick disks, such as magnetically arrested disks (MADs) or the standard and normal evolution (SANE) scenario. Our models serve as simplified representations to study disk-jet-wind structures. These simulations are postprocessed and ray-traced, using constraints of black hole mass and observed SEDs. Thermal synchrotron emission generated near the event horizon is used to create emission maps, which are analysed by separating accretion and outflow components to determine their contributions to the total intensity. Whether the emission appears optically thick or thin at a given frequency depends on its position relative to the synchrotron SED peak. At 230 GHz, low-mass SMBHs appear optically thicker than high-mass ones, even at lower accretion rates. Doppler beaming affects the brightness of emission from outflows with changing viewing angles in low-mass systems. Eddington ratios from our models align with those inferred by the EHTC for M87 and SgrA* using thicker MAD/SANE models. Although thin disks are optically thicker, their spectral properties make high-mass systems appear optically thinner at 230 GHz; ideal for probing GR effects like photon rings. In contrast, low-mass systems remain optically thicker at these frequencies because of synchrotron self-absorption, making outflow emissions near the horizon more pronounced. However, distinguishing these features remains challenging with current EHT resolution.
#### Periodic Variability in Space Photometry of 181 New Supermassive Black Hole Binary Candidates

 - **Abstract**
 Robust detections of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) are essential to unravel the role of galaxy mergers in galaxy evolution and for identifying potential sources of low-frequency gravitational waves. One of the most commonly used observational signatures of SMBHBs is periodic variability in the light curves of active galactic nuclei (AGN), which may arise from accretion rate modulation or relativistic Doppler boosting due to binary orbital motion. However, intrinsic stochastic AGN variability can mimic such periodic signals, complicating robust identification. We report the discovery of 181 new SMBHB candidates from a sample of approximately 770,000 AGN observed by the Gaia space observatory. Periodic signals were identified using a novel and computationally efficient Bayesian model selection framework, enabling unbiased source selection and quantifying the likelihood of periodicity over stochastic variability. These candidates nearly double the known SMBHB population and provide a prioritized target list for next-generation time-domain surveys.
