 - **Abstract**
 We report on the observation and measurement of astrometry, photometry, morphology, and activity of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, also designated C/2025 N1 (ATLAS), with the NSF-DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory. The third interstellar object, comet 3I/ATLAS, was first discovered on UT 2025 July 1. Serendipitously, the Rubin Observatory collected imaging in the area of the sky inhabited by the object during regular commissioning activities. We successfully recovered object detections from Rubin visits spanning UT 2025 June 21 (10 days before discovery) to UT 2025 July 7. Facilitated by Rubin's high resolution and large aperture, we report on the detection of cometary activity as early as June 21st, and observe it throughout. We measure the location and magnitude of the object on 37 Rubin images in r, i, and z bands, with typical precision of about 20 mas (100 mas, systematic) and about 10 mmag, respectively. We use these to derive improved orbit solutions, and to show there is no detectable photometric variability on hourly timescales. We derive a V-band absolute magnitude of H_V = (13.7 +/- 0.2) mag, and an equivalent effective nucleus radius of around (5.6 +/- 0.7) km. These data represent the earliest observations of this object by a large (8-meter class) telescope reported to date, and illustrate the type of measurements (and discoveries) Rubin's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will begin to provide once operational later this year.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyzed the deepest Hubble Space Telescope (HST) F275W ultraviolet (UV) imaging of M87 to obtain the most robust constraints on its star formation rate (SFR) and star formation history (SFH). After removing the galaxy continuum and globular clusters, we detected an excess of UV point sources near the center. By comparing their colors to young stellar source (YSS) colors generated by stochastically simulated star formation (SF) for various SFRs and SFHs, we ruled out their origin as a UV-upturn population and identified them as YSS. We found an extremely low SFR of $\sim 2\times10^{-5}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ in M87, with evidence of a weak starburst $\sim$125 Myr ago that formed $\sim 1000$ M$_\odot$ of stars. Unlike other cool-core clusters where SF is stronger and directly linked to cooling gas, we found no spatial correlation between YSS and H$\alpha$ filaments. Comparing SF activity with M87's AGN outburst history suggests that recent AGN feedback events ($\lesssim$12 Myr ago) neither triggered nor were associated with any detectable SF, however, earlier outbursts may have triggered weak starbursts. We detected UV filaments co-spatial with H$\alpha$ filaments with similar lengths and widths, though they are obscured by dust near the center. These filaments are likely powered by metal-line emission from collisional ionization, suggesting ongoing low-level precipitation of the intracluster medium. Our results indicate that AGN feedback has quenched SF significantly in M87 for at least 200 Myr, even though some precipitation persists. Additionally, we identified a hotspot created by the counterjet, with the spectral index also constrained.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we explore the properties of diffuse intergalactic gas residing in the outskirts of the four nearby, low-mass galaxy groups NGC1052, NGC5866, NGC4631, and NGC3992 (all at cz<2000 km/s) beyond their group virial radii. Using archival ultraviolet absorption spectra of bright AGN observed with HST/COS, we search for HI Ly a absorption near the groups' recession velocities along 35 sightlines that pass the outer group medium (OGrM) at normalized impact parameters rho/Rvir=1-3. We derive HI column densities of the absorbers and constrain the physical conditions in the gas by using a hydrostatic toy model of the groups' gas environment and assuming photoionization. HI Ly absorption near the groups' recession velocities is detected along 19 sightlines with HI column densities in the range log N(HI)=12.50-14.34, implying a high OGrM detection rate of more than 50 percent. We transform this value into an incidence rate of OGrM absorbers per unit redshift of dN/dz=this http URL is 25 percent above the value derived for the general population of Ly a absorbers within z = 0 filaments and more than twice the value for the z = 0 Ly a forest. From the modeling, we obtain lower limits for the gas densities from log n_H=-5.00 to -3.72, comparable to densities found in the overall Ly a forest. Our study unveils a large cross section and overdensity of Ly a absorbers in the outskirts of these four nearby groups. Such an overdensity is in line with a previously proposed scenario, in which AGN feedback lifts gaseous material to large distances beyond the virial radius of groups into the OGrM. However, a larger survey of OGrM absorbers and a comparison with hydrodynamical simulations will be necessary to constrain the cosmological mass density of OGrM absorbers and pinpoint their role in cosmological structure formation and galaxy/group evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the conditions that enable particle acceleration at non-relativistic collisionless shocks is essential to unveil the origin of cosmic rays. We employ 2D and 3D hybrid simulations (with kinetic ions and fluid electrons) to explore particle acceleration and magnetic field amplification in non-relativistic perpendicular shocks, focusing on the role of shock drift acceleration and its dependence on the shock Mach number. We perform an analysis of the ion injection process and demonstrate why efficient acceleration is only observed in 3D. In particular, we show that ion injection critically depends on the "porosity" of the magnetic turbulence in the downstream region near the shock, a property describing how easily the post-shock region allows particles to traverse it and return upstream without being trapped. This effect can only be properly captured in 3D. Additionally, we explore the impact of numerical resolution on ion energization, highlighting how resolving small-scale turbulence -- on scales below the thermal ion gyroradius -- is essential for accurately modeling particle injection. Overall, our results emphasize the necessity of high-resolution 3D simulations to capture the fundamental microphysics driving particle acceleration at perpendicular shocks.

 - **Abstract**
 Numerical simulations have become an indispensable tool in astrophysics. To interpret their results, it is critical to understand their intrinsic variability, that is, how much the results change with numerical noise or inherent stochasticity of the physics model. We present a set of seven realisations of high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations of a Milky Way-like galaxy with the Auriga galaxy formation model. All realisations share the same initial conditions and code parameters, but draw different random numbers for the inherently stochastic parts of the model. We show that global galaxy properties at $z=0$, including stellar mass, star formation history, masses of stellar bulge and stellar disc, the radius and height of the stellar disk change by less than $10\%$ between the different realisations, and that magnetic field structures in the disc and the halo are very similar. In contrast, the star formation rate today can vary by a factor of two and the internal morphological structure of the stellar disc can change. The time and orbit of satellite galaxies and their galaxy properties when falling into the main halo are again very similar, but their orbits start to deviate after first pericenter passage. Finally, we show that changing the mass resolution of all matter components in the Auriga model changes galaxy properties significantly more than the intrinsic variability of the model, and that these changes are systematic. This limits detailed comparisons between simulations at different numerical resolutions.

 - **Abstract**
 Most general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of black hole (BH) hot accretion flows are initialized with small rotating tori and produce stable jets with only small fluctuations. However, recent studies using larger scale Bondi-like initial conditions have reported intermittent jet activity and loss of coherent rotation. To investigate the differences, we modify the standard torus setup across four BH spins: $a_*=0$, $0.5$, $0.9$, $-0.9$. First, we increase the torus size significantly (pressure maximum at 500 gravitational radii), allowing long simulations ($2.8\times10^5$ gravitational times) without gas depletion. These runs reproduce the weak variability seen in smaller tori, indicating that a larger dynamic range alone does not cause strong fluctuations. We observe moderate suppression of the accretion rate by factors of $\sim 1.6, ~2.5$ for BH spins $a_*=0.5,~0.9$, respectively, compared to $a_*=0$. Also, the density profile scales as $\rho(r)\propto r^{-1.1}$ for prograde BHs. Next, we considerably strengthen the initial magnetic field in the large torus by setting the plasma-$\beta\approx 1$. This induces strong variability in the evolution. The jet efficiency in the $a_*=0.9$ model, for instance, now varies by over 3 orders of magnitude, and gas rotation reverses directions. Combining these results with prior studies, we propose that a key parameter is the ratio $R$ between the rotational and magnetic energies in the initial state. Strong variability appears later in models with a larger value of $R$. The implication is that all simulations, and by extension all hot accretion flows in Nature, will ultimately develop intermittent jets if evolved long enough.
#### Reconstructing galactic feedback history via the Lyman-$α$ forest with Habitable Worlds Observatory

 - **Abstract**
 Recent studies have focused on the low-$z$ Ly$\alpha$ forest as a potential constraint on galactic feedback, as different AGN and stellar feedback models in hydrodynamic simulations produce varying intergalactic medium (IGM) statistics. However, existing low-$z$ Ly$\alpha$ forest data provide insufficient observational constraints for simulations due to their low precision and the lack of observations from $z \sim 0.4$ to $1.8$. The Habitable Worlds Observatory, equipped with an ultraviolet (FUV / NUV) spectrograph, could provide transformative data for this science by increasing both absorbers in the redshift range where current data are lacking and increasing the precision of the Ly$\alpha$ forest observational data at $z \leq 0.4$. This spectrograph should cover the wavelengths $1215-3402$ Å~and have a spectral resolution of $R =$~40,000. Distinguishing between certain active-galactic nuclei feedback models requires high precision ($\sim 5-10$\%) measurements of the Ly$\alpha$ forest 1D transmitted flux power spectrum for $z\leq 1.8$. This requires $\sim 830$ QSO spectra with S/N~$\geq5$ - $25$ depending on redshift. This data would also enable a comprehensive study on the thermal state of the IGM across time, and address the tension between the observed and simulated Ly$\alpha$ forest $b$-value distribution.

 - **Abstract**
 Long-period radio transients (LPTs) are an emerging group of radio transients that show periodic polarised radio bursts with periods varying from a few minutes to a few hours. Fewer than a dozen LPTs have been detected so far, and their origin (source and emission mechanism) remains unclear. Here, we report the discovery of a 1.5 hr LPT, ASKAP J144834-685644, adding to the current sample of sources. ASKAP J144834-685644 is one of the very few LPTs that has been detected from X-rays to radio. It shows a steep radio spectrum and polarised radio bursts, which resemble the radio emission in known LPTs. In addition, it also shows highly structured and periodic narrow-band radio emission. Multi-wavelength properties suggest that the spectral energy distribution (SED) peaks at near ultraviolet wavelengths, indicating the presence of a hot magnetic source. Combining multi-wavelength information, we infer that ASKAP J144834-685644 may be a near edge-on magnetic white dwarf binary (MWD), although we can not fully rule out ASKAP J144834-685644 being an isolated white dwarf pulsar or even a transitional millisecond pulsar (despite the lack of radio pulsations). If ASKAP J144834-685644 is an MWD binary, the observed broadband spectral energy distribution can be explained by emission from an accretion disk. This hints that some fraction of optically bright LPTs may be accreting binaries with the radio period being the orbital period. It might further suggest a connection between optically bright non-accreting synchronized LPTs, such as polars, and non-accreting asynchronous WD pulsars, such as AR Sco and J1912-4410.

 - **Abstract**
 Extreme emission line galaxies (EELGs) at high redshifts are considered key contributors to cosmic reionization at $z>6$ due to their higher ionization efficiencies. We have identified 119 H$\beta$ + [OIII] emitters at $z\sim7$ selected by a flux excess in the medium-band filter F410M in the public James Webb Space Telescope Cycle-1 fields. Our emitters exhibit a wide range in rest-frame H$\beta$ + [OIII] equivalent width (EWs), 420 $<$ EW$_{0}$/Å $<$ 6850 (with the median value of $\sim1700$ Å). Among them, 19 are EW$_{0}$ $>$ 3000 Å, which represent extreme populations even in the context of recent findings with JWST. They are characterized by (i) low stellar mass ($\sim 3\times10^{7}$ $\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$), (ii) blue colors ($\beta_{\rm UV}\sim -2.2$), and (iii) low dust attenuation ($A_{\mathrm{V}}\sim 0.1$ mag). We discuss the physical mechanisms responsible for the observed high rest-frame H$\beta$ + [OIII] EWs, including (1) photoionization by AGN, (2) stellar photoionization in the vicinity of HII regions, and (3) radiative shocks powered by outflows either from AGN or massive stars. Notably, we find 13 emitters with spatially offset H$\beta$ + [OIII] emission compared to the UV and stellar components. Given the absence of obvious signatures of actively accreting black holes, these emitters are likely under strong feedback-driven winds from massive stars. Lastly, we report a unique overdensity of EELGs in one of the observed fields. The discovery of such a "star-bursting" overdensity supports the idea that large ionizing bubbles formed around some EEGLs in the early Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 The Sun continuously expels a fraction of its own mass in the form of a steadily accelerating outflow of ionized gas called the "solar wind." The solar wind is the extension of the Sun's hot (million-degree Kelvin) outer atmosphere that is visible during solar eclipses as the bright and wispy corona. In 1958, Eugene Parker theorized that a hot corona could not exist for very long without beginning to accelerate some of its gas into interplanetary space. After more than half a century, Parker's idea of a gas-pressure-driven solar wind still is largely accepted, although many questions remain unanswered. Specifically, the physical processes that heat the corona have not yet been identified conclusively, and the importance of additional wind acceleration mechanisms continue to be investigated. Variability in the solar wind also gives rise to a number of practical "space weather" effects on human life and technology, and there is still a need for more accurate forecasting. Fortunately, recent improvements in both observations (with telescopes and via direct sampling by space probes) and theory (with the help of ever more sophisticated computers) are leading to new generations of predictive and self-consistent simulations. Attempts to model the origin of the solar wind are also leading to new insights into long-standing mysteries about turbulent flows, magnetic reconnection, and kinetic wave-particle resonances.

 - **Abstract**
 We characterize the post-inflationary evolution of the equation of state of the universe from the end of inflation until the onset of radiation domination, when the inflaton is coupled to a daughter field through a trilinear interaction. We consider an inflaton potential that is quadratic near the minimum and flattens in the inflationary regime. By simulating the dynamics in 2+1-dimensional lattices, we have tracked the long-term evolution of the equation of state for about ten e-folds of expansion, for various coupling strengths. The trilinear interaction initially excites daughter field modes through a process of tachyonic resonance immediately after inflation and triggers a temporary deviation of the equation of state from $\bar{w} = 0$ to a maximum value $\bar{w} = \bar{w}_{\rm max} < 1/3$. However, at much later times, the inflaton homogeneous mode once again dominates the energy density, pushing the equation of state towards $\bar{w} = 0$ until the onset of perturbative reheating. By combining the lattice results with a Boltzmann approach, we characterize the entire post-inflationary expansion history, which allows to calculate precise predictions for the inflationary CMB observables. We also accurately compute the redshift of the stochastic gravitational wave background produced during preheating, and show that taking the temporary return of the equation of state towards $\bar{w} = 0$ into account can reduce the amplitude by many orders of magnitude relative to previous estimates.

 - **Abstract**
 Waves are thought to play a significant role in the heating of the solar atmosphere and the acceleration of the wind. Among the many types of waves observed in the Sun, the so-called p-modes with a 3 mHz frequency peak dominate the lower atmosphere. In the presence of magnetic fields, these waves can be converted into magnetohydrodynamic modes, which then leak into the corona through magnetic conduits. High-resolution off-limb observations have indeed revealed signatures of ubiquitous and global 3 mHz oscillations in the corona, although limited to low heights and to incompressible modes. We present high-cadence, high-resolution observations of the corona in the range 1.7 - 3.6 solar radii taken in broad-band 580-640 nm visible light by the Metis coronagraph aboard Solar Orbiter. These observations were designed to investigate density fluctuations in the middle corona. The data were acquired over several days in March 2022, October 2022, and for two days in April 2023. We selected representative regions of the corona on three sample dates. Analysis of the data in those regions revealed the presence of periodic density fluctuations. By examining several time-distance diagrams, we determined the main properties (apparent propagation speed, amplitude) of those fluctuations. We also show power spectra in selected locations in order to determine the dominant frequencies. We found wave-like, compressible fluctuations of low amplitude - of the order of 0.1 % of the background - in several large-scale regions in the corona at least up to 2.5 solar radii. We also found that the apparent propagation speeds of these perturbations typically fall in the range 150 - 450 km/s. A power spectrum analysis of time series revealed an excess power in the range 2-7 mHz, often with peaks at 3 or 5 mHz, i.e. in a range consistent with p-mode frequencies of the lower solar atmosphere.

 - **Abstract**
 Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) offers a principled and flexible framework for conducting Bayesian inference in any situation where forward simulations are feasible. However, validating the accuracy and reliability of the inferred posteriors remains a persistent challenge. In this work, we point out a simple diagnostic approach rooted in ensemble learning methods to assess the internal consistency of SBI outputs that does not require access to the true posterior. By training multiple neural estimators under identical conditions and evaluating their pairwise Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergences, we define a consistency criterion that quantifies agreement across the ensemble. We highlight two core use cases for this framework: a) for generating a robust estimate of the systematic uncertainty in parameter reconstruction associated with the training procedure, and b) for detecting possible model misspecification when using trained estimators on real data. We also demonstrate the relationship between significant KL divergences and issues such as insufficient convergence due to, e.g., too low a simulation budget, or intrinsic variance in the training process. Overall, this ensemble-based diagnostic framework provides a lightweight, scalable, and model-agnostic tool for enhancing the trustworthiness of SBI in scientific applications.

 - **Abstract**
 We present early results from a high-resolution analysis ($\sim$100-200pc) of the CO(2-1)/CO(1-0) line ratio in twelve nearby galaxies. We use new ALMA CO(1-0) observations from the Fundamental CO(1-0) Transition Survey (FACTS), and re-imaged CO(2-1) data from PHANGS. We make empirical classifications based on the optical and molecular gas morphologies, which show clear systematic trends in the variation of $R_{21}$ as a function of galactic structure. The sample includes barred and unbarred, and flocculent galaxies. The barred spiral galaxies follow a general trend: $R_{21}$ is high in the center, low along the bar, increases at the bar ends, and then declines in the outer parts of the disk. The structure dependence suggests the importance of galactic dynamics on molecular gas evolution, and consequently on star formation, in galaxies. $R_{21}$ fluctuates in the spiral arms for both barred and unbarred galaxies. HII regions increase $R_{21}$ locally in their surrounding gas and are often associated with galactic structures. Together, $R_{21}$ varies systematically as a function of galactic structure, dynamics, and star formation activity.

 I measure and collect timings of phase markers (like eclipse times) for the orbits of 25 X-ray binaries (XRBs) so as to calculate the steady evolutionary period change ($\dot{P}$). I combine these with my observed $\dot{P}$ measures from 52 cataclysmic variables (CVs). Further, I subtract out the contributions from gravitational radiation ($\dot{P}_{\rm GR}$) and mass transfer ($\dot{P}_{\rm mt}$), deriving the period change from the residual unknown angular momentum loss ($\dot{P}_{\rm AML}$=$\dot{P}$-$\dot{P}_{\rm GR}$-$\dot{P}_{\rm mt}$). I have $\dot{P}_{\rm AML}$ measures for 77 XRBs and CVs, with these being direct measures of the driver of binary evolution. The venerable Magnetic Braking Model (MBM) of binary evolution has its most fundamental predictions tested, with most systems having predictions wrong by over one order-of-magnitude. Other proposed mechanisms to explain the AML also fail, so we are left with no known mechanism that dominates the AML. An alternative path to the AML law is empirical, where my $\dot{P}_{\rm AML}$ measures are fitted to a power-law involving the fundamental binary properties. With this, the dominant AML law for systems with orbital periods ($P$) from 0.13--1.0 days is $\dot{P}_{\rm AML} = -1500\times10^{-12} P^{1.29} M_{\rm prim}^{2.75} M_{\rm comp}^{-1.00}\dot{M}^{0.43}_{-8}$, in appropriate units. Similar AML laws for binaries below the Period Gap and for binaries with $P$$>$1.0 day are derived. These three AML laws are of good accuracy and are the best representations of the actual evolution for all 77 XRBs and CVs of all classes, so the three taken together can be called `universal'.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the feasibility of detecting galactic orbit dark matter passing through Earth by measuring its gravitational coupling with a wire under tension. We do so by exploring the transverse and longitudinal waves induced on the wire to detect a massive particle passing within $\sim 1$ m of the wire. The particle's $r^{-2}$ interaction with the wire provides an initial momentum which develops into a propagating wave carrying a distinctive time dependent displacement. Most interestingly, we find that both transverse and longitudinal waves develop with unique profiles, allowing for a full, three dimensional reconstruction of the particle's trajectory and its mass over velocity ratio. We find that, at interaction distances of 0.1 to 100 mm with a 90 micron diameter copper beryllium wire, Planck scale dark matter with mass $\sim 10^{19}$ GeV/$c^2$ would create immeasurable displacements on the scale of $10^{-24}$ to $10^{-26}$ m. In order to create displacements detectable by modern, commercially available, displacement sensors on the nanometer scale we require dark matter with a particle mass greater than $4 \times 10^7$ kg ($\sim 2 \times 10^{32}$ GeV/$c^2$). This is outside the upper limit of the Planck scale by 13 orders of magnitude and would also have such a low particle flux that a detection event would be implausible. Finally, we perform a similar analysis for a charged wire and an elementary charged particle with their electrostatic interaction, finding that a sufficiently slow charged particle would produce a transverse displacement comparable to the sensitivity of currently available sensors.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of accreting black hole (BH) systems, such as microquasars and supermassive black holes, often reveal a precessing jet with changing directions, indicating a misaligned accretion flow relative to the BH spin. The precession is commonly attributed to the Lense-Thirring (LT) effect, which arises from the BH's rotation twisting the surrounding spacetime and accretion flow. In the strongly magnetized regime, which is preferred accretion flow conditions for M~87$^*$ and likely other jet-producing systems, the large-scale magnetic field can significantly influence the flow dynamics. Here, we perform large-scale three-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of tilted accretion onto a rotating BH, and find a never-seen-before new retrograde precession. This precession arises from a magnetic torque on the disk generated by the poloidal magnetic field aligned with the BH's rotation, opposing the LT torque. This finding highlights the unique property of highly magnetized accretion flows around BHs and provides a new interpretation of jet precession observed in many systems.

 Context: Helioseismology aims to infer the properties of the solar interior by analyzing observations of acoustic oscillations. The interpretation of the helioseismic data is however complicated by the non-trivial relationship between helioseismic observables and the physical perturbations associated with acoustic modes, as well as by various instrumental effects. Aims: We aim to improve our understanding of the signature of acoustic modes measured in the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) continuum intensity and Doppler velocity observables by accounting for radiative transfer, solar background rotation, and spacecraft velocity. Methods: We start with a background model atmosphere that accurately reproduces solar limb darkening and the Fe I 6173Å spectral line profile. We employ first-order perturbation theory to model the effect of acoustic oscillations on inferred intensity and velocity. By solving the radiative transfer equation in the atmosphere, we synthesize the spectral line, convolve it with the six HMI spectral windows, and deduce continuum intensity (hmi.Ic_45s) and Doppler velocity (hmi.V_45s) according to the HMI algorithm. Results: We analytically derive the relationship between mode displacement in the atmosphere and the HMI observables, and show that both intensity and velocity deviate significantly from simple approximations. Specifically, the continuum intensity does not simply reflect the true continuum value, while the line-of-sight velocity does not correspond to a straightforward projection of the velocity at a fixed height in the atmosphere. Our results indicate that these deviations are substantial, with amplitudes of approximately 10% and phase shifts of around 10 degrees across the detector for both observables. Moreover, these effects are highly dependent on the acoustic mode under consideration and the position on the solar disk.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations with the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) have revealed 19 nearby M dwarfs showing bright circularly polarised radio emission. One of the possible sources of such emission is through magnetic star-planet interactions (MSPI) with unseen close-in planets. We present initial results from a spectroscopic survey with the Habitable-zone Planet Finder (HPF) and NEID spectrographs designed to characterize this sample and further investigate the origin of the radio emission. We provide four new insights into the sample. I) We uniformly characterize the stellar properties, constraining their effective temperatures, surface gravities, metallicities, projected rotational velocities, rotation periods, stellar radii, and stellar inclinations where possible. Further, from a homogenous analysis of the HPF spectra, we infer their chromospheric activity and spectroscopic multiplicity states. From this, we identify GJ 625, GJ 1151, and LHS 2395 as single, quiescent stars amenable to precise RV follow-up, making them strong MSPI candidates. II) We show that the distribution of stellar inclinations are compatible with an isotropic distribution, providing no evidence for a preference to pole-on configurations. III) We refine the radial velocity solution for GJ 625 b, the only currently known close-in planet in the sample, reducing the uncertainty in its orbital period by a factor of three, to facilitate future phase-dependent radio analysis. IV) Finally, we identify GJ 3861 as a spectroscopic binary with an orbital period of $P=14.841181_{-0.00010}^{+0.00011}$ d, making it the only confirmed binary with a relatively short orbit in the sample, where we surmise the radio emission is likely related to magnetospheric interactions between the two stars. These results advance our understanding of radio-emitting M dwarfs and establish an observational foundation for identifying MSPI.

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows and kilonovae (KNe) are electromagnetic transients that can accompany binary neutron star (BNS) mergers. Therefore, studying their emission processes is of general interest for constraining cosmological parameters or the behavior of ultra-dense matter. One common method to analyze electromagnetic data from BNS mergers is to sample a Bayesian posterior over the parameters of a physical model for the transient. However, sampling the posterior is computationally costly, and because of the many likelihood evaluations needed in this process, detailed models are too expensive to be used directly in inference. In the present article, we address this problem by introducing fiesta, a python package to train machine learning (ML) surrogates for GRB afterglow and kilonova models that can accelerate likelihood evaluations. Specifically, we introduce extensive ML surrogates for the state-of-the-art GRB afterglow models afterglowpy and pyblastafterglow, as well as a new surrogate for the KN emission as modeled by the possis code. Our surrogates enable evaluation of the lightcurve posterior within minutes. We also provide built-in posterior sampling capabilities in fiesta that rely on the flowMC package which scale efficiently to higher dimensions when adding up to tens of nuisance sampling parameters. Because of its use of the JAX framework, fiesta also allows for GPU acceleration during both surrogate training and posterior sampling. We apply our framework to reanalyze AT2017gfo/GRB170817A and GRB211211A using our surrogates, thus employing the new pyblastafterglow model for the first time in Bayesian inference.

 - **Abstract**
 Alfvén waves are known to be important carriers of magnetic energy that could play a role in coronal heating and/or solar wind acceleration. As these waves are efficient energy carriers, how they are dissipated still remains one of the key challenges. Using a series of 1.5-D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations, we explore wave energy trapping associated with field-aligned density enhancements. We examine the parameters which govern the wave reflection and trapping. The goal of our simulations is to find optimal conditions for wave trapping, which would ultimately promote the energisation of the solar atmosphere. In agreement with previous studies, we find that maximum wave reflections happen only for a narrow range of density enhancement widths, namely when it is comparable to the Alfvén wave wavelength. In our paper, we explain this scale-selectivity using a semi-analytical model that demonstrates the importance of wave interference effects. As expected, we find that spatially extended regions of density inhomogeneities favour enhanced wave reflection and trapping. However, wave interference causes saturation of the reflected energy for very extended regions of varying density.

 - **Abstract**
 One of the most fundamental relationships in modern cosmology is the cosmic distance duality relation (CDDR), which describes the relationship between the angular diameter distance ($D_{\rm A}$) and the luminosity distance ($D_{\rm L}$), and is expressed as: $\eta(z)=D_{\rm L}(z)(1+z)^{-2}/D_{\rm A}(z)=1$. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive test of the CDDR by combining baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data from the SDSS and DESI surveys with type Ia supernova (SN) data from PantheonPlus and DESY5. We utilize an artificial neural network approach to match the SN and BAO data at the same redshift. To explore potential violations of the CDDR, we consider three different parameterizations: (i) $\eta(z)=1+\eta_0z$; (ii) $\eta(z)=1+\eta_0z/(1+z)$; (iii) $\eta(z)=1+\eta_0\ln(1+z)$. Our results indicate that the calibration of the SN absolute magnitude $M_{\rm B}$ plays a crucial role in testing potential deviations from the CDDR, as there exists a significant negative correlation between $\eta_0$ and $M_{\rm B}$. For PantheonPlus analysis, when $M_{\rm B}$ is treated as a free parameter, no evidence of CDDR violation is found. In contrast, fixing $M_{\rm B}$ to the $M_{\rm B}^{\rm D20}$ prior with $-19.230\pm0.040$ mag leads to a deviation at approximately the $2\sigma$ level, while fixing $M_{\rm B}$ to the $M_{\rm B}^{\rm B23}$ prior with $-19.396\pm0.016$ mag remains in agreement with the CDDR. Furthermore, overall analyses based on the SDSS+DESY5 and DESI+DESY5 data consistently show no evidence of the deviation from the CDDR.

 - **Abstract**
 Many white dwarfs are observed in compact double white dwarf binaries and, through the emission of gravitational waves, a large fraction are destined to merge. The merger remnants that do not explode in a Type Ia supernova are expected to initially be rapidly rotating and highly magnetized. We here present our discovery of the variable white dwarf ZTF J200832.79+444939.67, hereafter ZTF J2008+4449, as a likely merger remnant showing signs of circumstellar material without a stellar or substellar companion. The nature of ZTF J2008+4449 as a merger remnant is supported by its physical properties: hot ($35,500\pm300$ K) and massive ($1.12\pm0.03$ M$_\odot$), the white dwarf is rapidly rotating with a period of $\approx$ 6.6 minutes and likely possesses exceptionally strong magnetic fields ($\sim$ 400-600 MG) at its surface. Remarkably, we detect a significant period derivative of $(1.80\pm0.09)\times10^{-12}$ s/s, indicating that the white dwarf is spinning down, and a soft X-ray emission that is inconsistent with photospheric emission. As the presence of a mass-transferring stellar or brown dwarf companion is excluded by infrared photometry, the detected spin down and X-ray emission could be tell-tale signs of a magnetically driven wind or of interaction with circumstellar material, possibly originating from the fallback of gravitationally bound merger ejecta or from the tidal disruption of a planetary object. We also detect Balmer emission, which requires the presence of ionized hydrogen in the vicinity of the white dwarf, showing Doppler shifts as high as $\approx$ 2000 km s$^{-1}$. The unusual variability of the Balmer emission on the spin period of the white dwarf is consistent with the trapping of a half ring of ionised gas in the magnetosphere of the white dwarf.

 - **Abstract**
 Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are spun up during their accretion phase in a binary system. The exchange of angular momentum between the accretion disk and the star tends to align the spin and orbital angular momenta on a very short time scale compared to the accretion stage. In this work, we study a subset of $\gamma$-ray MSPs in binaries for which the orbital inclination $i$ has been accurately constrained thanks to the Shapiro delay measurements. Our goal is to constrain the observer viewing angle $\zeta$ and to check whether it agrees with the orbital inclination $i$, thus $\zeta \approx i$. We use a Bayesian inference technique to fit the MSP $\gamma$-ray light-curves based on the third $\gamma$-ray pulsar catalogue (3PC). The emission model relies on the striped wind model deduced from force-free neutron star magnetosphere simulations. We found good agreement between those two angles ($i$ and $\zeta$) for a significant fraction of our sample, between 1/2 and 2/3, confirming the spin-orbit alignment scenario during the accretion stage. However about one third of our sample deviates significantly from this alignment. The reasons are manifold: either the $\gamma$-ray fit is not reliable or some precession and external torque avoid an almost perfect alignment.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate gravitational lensing in the strong-field regime for a black hole in F(R) Euler Heisenberg Gravity with Rainbow gravity modifications. This black hole spacetime is characterized by the Euler Heisenberg parameter, F(R) parameters, Rainbow functions, the black hole charge Q, and mass M . We numerically compute the strong deflection angle and its associated coefficients, and explore their astrophysical implications for supermassive black holes in different galaxies. Our findings show that increasing the Euler Heisenberg parameter enhances key lensing observables such as the photon sphere radius, critical impact parameter, angular position, relative magnification, Einstein ring radius, and time delay for a fixed Q . Conversely, increasing Q decreases these parameters while keeping other quantities fixed. Additionally, a higher Euler Heisenberg parameter reduces the deflection angle and angular separation S , whereas increasing Q causes both to increase. Our study reveals that black holes in this modified gravity framework can act as strong gravitational lenses, producing deflection angles that surpass those of Reissner Nordstrom and Schwarzschild black holes under specific conditions. These results highlight the unique topological features of modified charged black holes and suggest their potential as astrophysical candidates, offering new insights into their observational signatures. Furthermore, we analyze the sensitivity of the lensing predictions with respect to changes in the functional forms of the Rainbow functions. The combined effects of F(R) gravity, Euler Heisenberg electrodynamics, and Rainbow gravity introduce novel qualitative features not present in the individual models.

 - **Abstract**
 The inflated radii observed in hundreds of hot Jupiters (HJ) represent a long-standing open issue. In this study, we quantitatively investigate this phenomenon within the framework of Ohmic dissipation arising from magnetic induction in the atmosphere, one of the most promising mechanisms for explaining the radius anomaly. We simulate the evolution of irradiated giant planets with {\tt MESA}, spanning the observed range of masses and equilibrium temperatures, incorporating an internal source of Ohmic dissipation that extends to deep layers of the envelope. We infer average atmospheric wind intensities, averaged in the region $p\lesssim 10$ bar, in the range 0.01-1 km/s in order to reproduce the range of observed radii, decreasing roughly linearly with planetary mass, and much more steeply with equilibrium temperature. This is consistent with the expected effects of magnetic drag from the induced field, which is higher for more intense irradiation, via conductivity, and for larger masses, which have higher dynamo fields. Due to the evolution of the dynamo field and the proportionality of the induced currents on it, the Ohmic efficiency typically decreases by at least one order of magnitude from 0.1 to 10 Gyr, at contrast with the common assumption of a constant-in-time value. Notably, the extent of the main convective region, and the associated heat flux supporting the dynamo, is reduced in the presence of strong Ohmic dissipation, which in turn depends on the dynamo field strength, generating a non-trivial coupling of the latter with the atmospheric induction, potentially leading to an oscillatory behaviour of the field strength. These findings remain generally valid even when accounting for a long-term increase in the main-sequence host star luminosity, although this case can more readily lead to HJ re-inflation, consistent with previous studies.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic reconnection in current layers that form intermittently in radiatively inefficient accretion flows onto black holes is a promising mechanism for particle acceleration and high-energy emission. It has been recently proposed that such layers, arising during flux eruption events, can power the rapid TeV flares observed from the core of M87. In this scenario, inverse Compton scattering of soft radiation from the accretion flow by energetic electron-positron pairs produced near the reconnection layer was suggested as the primary emission mechanism. However, detailed calculations show that radiation from pairs alone cannot account for the GeV emission detected by the Fermi observatory. In this work, we combine analytic estimates with 3D radiative particle-in-cell simulations of pair-proton plasmas to show that the GeV emission can be naturally explained by synchrotron radiation from protons accelerated in the current sheet. Although the exact proton content of the layer is uncertain, our model remains robust across a broad range of proton-to-pair number density ratios. While protons are subdominant in number compared to pairs, our simulations demonstrate that they can be accelerated more efficiently, leading to a self-regulated steady state in which protons dominate the energy budget. Ultimately, proton synchrotron emission accounts for approximately 5% to 20% of the total dissipation power. The majority is radiated as MeV photons via pair synchrotron emission, with a smaller fraction emitted as TeV photons through inverse Compton scattering.

 Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are known to be unpredictable in time and position. A few (observationally) exceptional events have been observed, as GRB221009A that stands out for its fluence and peak flux, being orders of magnitude higher than what measured so far. Analyzing the observed fluence, peak flux or duration distributions typically requires one to assume some scenarios, and the consistency of the observed data with the predictions turns out to be an important model diagnostic. However, it is also of interest to model these distributions using general statistical properties that do not rely on specific model assumptions, allowing one to derive inferences only based on the consistency of the observed distributions with the hypothesis of one single population of events that generate them. We obtained fluences, peak fluxes and durations from the catalogues of GRBs observed by the CGRO-BATSE and Fermi-GBM instruments. We selected the extreme values in slots of equal duration and modelled their distributions by the generalized extreme value (GEV) formalism. The GEV distribution is a limit distribution naturally arising when the number of observations is large and is essentially independent of the phenomena producing the observed data. The distributions of extreme values for fluences, peak fluxes and durations are consistent with being extracted from a single population of events but the fluence and peak flux recorded for GRB221009A constitutes a striking exception. The probability to observe such an event, assuming it is a cosmological GRB, is low, with a median value of about one event per millennium for the fluence and about one event per century for the peak flux.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze two different scenarios for the late Universe dynamics, resulting into Hubble parameters deviating from the $\Lambda$CDM, mainly for the presence of an additional free parameter, which is the dark energy parameter. The first model consists of a pure evolutionary dark energy paradigm, as result of its creation by the gravitational field of the expanding Universe. The second model also considers an interaction of the evolutionary dark energy with the matter component, postulated via the conservation of the sum of their ideal energy-momentum tensors. These two models are then compared \textit{via} the diagnostic tool of the effective running Hubble constant, with the binned data of the so-called ``Master sample'' for the Type Ia Supernovae. The comparison procedures, based on a standard MCMC analysis, led to a clear preference of data for the dark energy - matter interaction model, which is associated to a phantom matter equation of state parameter (very close to $-1$) when, being left free by data (it has a flat posterior), it is fixed in order to reproduce the decreasing power-law behavior of the effective running Hubble constant, already discussed in literature.

 - **Abstract**
 Double white dwarf binaries are an important remnant of binary evolution as they are possible type Ia supernova progenitors and strong sources of gravitational waves in the low-frequency regime. The double-lined double white dwarf (DBL) survey searches for compact double white dwarfs where both stars are spectrally disentangleable. Candidates are identified by being overluminous compared to the cooling sequence of a typical mass, single white dwarf. In this second DBL survey instalment, we present full orbital solutions of 15 double white dwarf binaries from our ongoing campaign to accurately measure a magnitude-limited mass-period distribution. 12 of these systems are fully solved for the first time. A long-standing bias in the full population has been evident, favouring systems with orbital periods up to a few hours, with little exploration of the majority of the compact double white dwarf population, whose orbital period distribution centres at approximately 20hr. The 15 systems in this study span the orbital period range 5-75hr, significantly augmenting the number of well-characterised systems over these periods, and in general have two similar mass stars combining to approximately 1.0 solar masses. We witness that the orbitally derived mass ratios generally show an excellent agreement with those deduced from atmospheric fits to double-lined spectra in previous work, emphasising the power of wide-scale spectroscopic surveys to efficiently locate the highest mass, double-lined double white dwarfs in the local Galaxy.

 We present new constraints on the halo masses and matter density profiles of DESI galaxy groups by cross-correlating samples of Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) and Bright Galaxy Survey (BGS) galaxies with the publicly available CMB lensing convergence map from ACT DR6. This provides an independent, lensing-based calibration of halo masses, complementary to methods relying on clustering or dynamics. We derive constraints on the mean halo mass for three DESI-selected samples, finding $\log(M_{\rm halo}/(M_\odot/h)) \approx 13.18$, 13.03 and 13.02 for the Main LRG, Extended LRG, and BGS samples, respectively. Using a halo model approach, we also compare the projected galaxy-matter density profiles with previously reported gas profiles inferred from measurements of the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect. This work addresses one of the key uncertainties in interpreting kSZ signals -- the unknown host halo mass distribution -- by providing an independent and consistent mass calibration. The agreement between the gas and total mass profiles at large aperture suggests that sufficiently far from the group center (2--3 virial radii), we recover all the baryons, offering a resolution to the 'missing baryon' problem. We further study the cumulative gas fractions for all galaxies as well as for the most massive galaxy groups in the sample ($\log(M_{\rm halo}/(M_\odot/h)) \approx 13.5$), finding values that are physically sensible and in agreement with previous findings using kSZ and X-ray data: compared to the TNG300 simulation, the observed gas fractions are systematically lower at fixed radius by $\gtrsim$4$\sigma$, providing compelling, independent evidence for stronger baryonic feedback in the real Universe. These findings highlight the power of combining CMB lensing with galaxy surveys to probe the interplay between baryons and dark matter in group-sized halos.
