 - **Abstract**
 Recent high-resolution solar observations have unveiled the presence of small-scale loop-like structures in the lower solar atmosphere, often referred to as unresolved fine structures, low-lying loops, and miniature hot loops. These structures undergo rapid changes within minutes, and their formation mechanism has remained elusive. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of two small loops utilizing data from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS), the Goode Solar Telescope (GST) at Big Bear Solar Observatory, and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) and the Helioseismic Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), aiming to elucidate the underlying process behind their formation. The GST observations revealed that these loops, with lengths of $\sim$3.5 Mm and heights of $\sim$1 Mm, manifest as bright emission structures in H$\alpha$ wing images, particularly prominent in the red wing. IRIS observations showcased these loops in 1330 angstrom slit-jaw images, with TR and chromospheric line spectra exhibiting significant enhancement and broadening above the loops, indicative of plasmoid-mediated reconnection during their formation. Additionally, we observed upward-erupting jets above these loops across various passbands. Furthermore, differential emission measurement analysis reveals an enhanced emission measure at the location of these loops, suggesting the presence of plasma exceeding 1 MK. Based on our observations, we propose that these loops and associated jets align with the minifilament eruption model. Our findings suggest a unified mechanism governing the formation of small-scale loops and jets akin to larger-scale X-ray jets.

 I show that the small differences between the orbital parameters of the dark comet 2005 VL1 and the Venera 2 spacecraft (reported in arXiv:2503.07972) are of the magnitude expected from gravitational deflection by a close encounter of Venera 2 with Venus.

 - **Abstract**
 The Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies (S$^4$G), together with its Early Type Galaxy (ETG) extension, stand as the most extensive dataset of deep, uniform mid-infrared (mid-IR; 3.6 and 4.5$\,\mu$m) imaging for a sample of $2817$ nearby ($d<40 \,$Mpc) galaxies. However, the velocity criterion used to select the original sample results in an additional 422 galaxies without HI detection that ought to have been included in the S$^4$G on the basis of their optical recession velocities. In order to create a complete magnitude-, size- and volume-limited sample of nearby galaxies, we collect $3.6\,\mu$m and $i$-band images using archival data from different surveys and complement it with new observations for the missing galaxies. We denote the sample of these additional galaxies as Disc Galaxy (DG) extension. We present the Complete Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies (CS$^4$G), encompassing a sample of $3239$ galaxies with consistent imaging, surface brightness profiles, photometric parameters, and revised morphological classification. Following the original strategy of the S$^4$G survey, we produce masks, surface brightness profiles, and curves of growth using masked $3.6\,\mu$m and $i$-band images. From these profiles, we derive the integrated quantities: total magnitude, stellar mass, concentration parameter, and galaxy size, converting to $3.6\,\mu$m. We re-measure these parameters also for the S$^4$G and ETG to create a homogenous sample. We present new morphological revised $T$-types, and we showcase mid-IR scaling relations for the photometric parameters. We complete the S$^4$G sample by incorporating 422 galaxies. The CS$^4$G includes at least 99.94\% of the complete sample of nearby galaxies, meeting the original selection criteria, and it will enable a wide set of investigations into galaxy structure and evolution.
#### Galaxy-cluster-stacked Fermi-LAT III: substructure and radio-relic counterparts

 - **Abstract**
 Faint $\gamma$-ray signatures emerge in Fermi-LAT data stacked scaled to the characteristic $R_{500}$ radii of MCXC galaxy clusters. This third paper in a series shows a $4.3\sigma$ excess of discrete 4FGL-DR4 catalog $\gamma$-ray sources at the $r<1.5R_{500}$ radii of 205 clusters, coincident with an $r\sim R_{500}$ diffuse $2.6\sigma$ excess of 1-100 GeV emission from 75 high-latitude clusters. The source excess becomes highly ($>5\sigma$) significant when considering the substantial ($3.4\sigma$) and unexpectedly rapid quenching of $\gamma$-ray sources just inside the virial shock. The excess sources show radial, spectral, and luminosity distributions better matching radio-relic counterparts or substructure than present tentative classifications as blazar-candidates. Their spectral distribution is bimodal: flat-spectrum sources are consistent with enhanced hadronic emission behind weak, Mach $\sim2$ shocks, while softer sources may be phoenix counterparts.

 - **Abstract**
 The stellar companions in the binary black hole systems Gaia BH2 and BH3, both of which are $\alpha$-enhanced red giant branch stars, are expected to show normal modes with the characteristic signature of convectively-driven solar-like oscillations. We investigate this using photometry from the TESS mission and find such a signal for Gaia BH2. For Gaia BH2, we measure a power excess frequency of $\nu_{\rm max}=60.15\pm0.57$ $\mu$Hz and a large separation of $\Delta\nu=5.99\pm0.03$ $\mu$Hz, yielding a mass of $1.19^{+0.08}_{-0.08}$ M$_\odot$, which is in agreement with spectroscopically derived parameters. Seismic modeling favors an age for the red giant of $5.03^{+2.58}_{-3.05}$ Gyr, strongly suggesting that it is a young, $\alpha$-enriched giant star, which are thought to arise from a binary accretion or merger scenario. Ground-based photometry of Gaia BH2 spanning 8 years indicates a photometric period of $398\pm5$ d, which we tentatively attribute to rotation. If this rotation is physical, it can not be explained solely by evolutionary spin-down or magnetic braking, and implies that the red giant underwent some tidal forcing mechanism. Suggestively, this period is close to the pseudo-synchronous spin period of P$_\text{spin}=428\pm1$ days derived from the binary orbit. For Gaia BH3, we are unable to identify an asteroseismic signal in the TESS data despite predicting that the amplitude of the signal should lie well above the measured noise level. We discuss a number of scenarios for why this signal may not be visible.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new parametric strong lensing analysis of the galaxy cluster MACS J0138.0-2155 at z = 0.336, the first known to show two multiply-imaged supernova (SN) siblings, SN Requiem and SN Encore at z= 1.949. We exploit HST and JWST multiband imaging in synergy with new MUSE spectroscopy to develop an improved lens mass model. We include 84 cluster members (of which ~60% are spectroscopically confirmed) and two perturber galaxies along the line of sight. Our observables consist of 23 spectroscopically confirmed multiple images from 8 background sources, spanning a fairly wide redshift range, from 0.767 to 3.420. To accurately characterise the sub-halo mass component, we calibrate the Faber-Jackson scaling relation based on the stellar kinematics of 14 bright cluster galaxies. We build several lens models, with different cluster total mass parametrisations, to assess the statistical and systematic uncertainties on the predicted values of the position and magnification of the observed and future multiple images of SN Requiem and SN Encore. Our reference best-fit lens model reproduces the observed positions of the multiple images with a root-mean-square offset of 0".36, and the multiple image positions of the SNe and their host galaxy with a remarkable mean precision of only 0".05. We measure a projected total mass of $M(<60~ \rm kpc) = 2.89_{-0.03}^{+0.04} \times 10^{13} M_{\odot}$, consistent with that independently derived from the Chandra X-ray analysis. We demonstrate the reliability of the new lens model by reconstructing the extended surface-brightness distribution of the multiple images of the host galaxy. The discrepancy between our model-predicted magnification values with those from previous studies, critical for understanding the intrinsic properties of the SNe and their host galaxy, underscores the need to combine cutting-edge observations with detailed lens modelling.

 - **Abstract**
 The point-spread function of the integral-field unit (IFU) mode of the JWST's NIRSpec is heavily under-sampled, creating resampling noise seen as low-frequency sinusoidal-like artifacts, or "wiggles". These artifacts in the data are not corrected in the JWST data pipeline, and significantly impact the science that can be achieved at a single-pixel level. We present WICKED (WIggle Corrector Kit for NIRSpEc Data), a tool designed to empirically remove wiggles. WICKED uses the Fast Fourier Transform to identify wiggle-affected spaxels across the data cube. Spectra are modeled with a mix of integrated aperture and annular templates, a power-law, and a second-degree polynomial. The method works across all medium- and high-resolution NIRSpec gratings: F070LP, F100LP, F170LP, and F290LP. WICKED can recover the true overall spectral shape up to a factor of 3.5x better compared to uncorrected spectra. It recovers the equivalent width of absorption lines within 5% of the true value-~3x better than uncorrected spectra and ~2x better than other methods. WICKED significantly improves kinematic measurements, recovering the line-of-sight velocity (LOSV) within 1% of the true value -- more than 100x better than uncorrected spectra at S/N ~40. As a case study, we applied WICKED to G235H/F170LP IFU data of the elliptical galaxy NGC5128, finding good agreement with previous studies. In wiggle-affected regions, the uncorrected spectrum showed stellar LOSV and velocity dispersion differences compared to the WICKED-cleaned spectrum, of ~17x and ~36x larger than the estimated uncertainties, respectively. Wiggles in NIRSpec IFU data can introduce severe biases in spectral shape, line measurements, and kinematics to values larger than the typical uncertainties. WICKED provides a robust, user-friendly solution, enabling precise single-pixel studies and maximizing JWST's potential.
#### Cosmology with Supernova Encore in the strong lensing cluster MACS J0138$-$2155: photometry, cluster members, and lens mass model

 - **Abstract**
 The strongly lensed Supernova (SN) Encore at a redshift of $z = 1.949$, discovered behind the galaxy cluster MACS J0138$-$2155 at $z=0.336$, provides a rare opportunity for time-delay cosmography and studies of the SN host galaxy, where previously another SN, called SN Requiem, had appeared. To enable these studies, we combine new James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) imaging, archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging, and new Very Large Telescope (VLT) spectroscopic data to construct state-of-the-art lens mass models that are composed of cluster dark-matter (DM) halos and galaxies. We determine the photometric and structural parameters of the galaxies across six JWST and five HST filters. We use the color-magnitude and color-color relations of spectroscopically-confirmed cluster members to select additional cluster members, identifying a total of 84 galaxies belonging to the galaxy cluster. We construct seven different mass models using a variety of DM halo mass profiles, and explore both multi-plane and approximate single-plane lens models. As constraints, we use the observed positions of 23 multiple images from eight multiply lensed sources at four distinct spectroscopic redshifts. In addition, we use stellar velocity dispersion measurements to obtain priors on the galaxy mass distributions. We find that six of the seven models fit well to the observed image positions. Mass models with cored-isothermal DM profiles fit well to the observations, whereas the mass model with a Navarro-Frenk-White cluster DM profile has an image-position $\chi^2$ value that is four times higher. We build our ultimate model by combining four multi-lens-plane mass models and predict the image positions and magnifications of SN Encore and SN Requiem. Our work lays the foundation for building state-of-the-art mass models of the cluster for future cosmological analysis and SN host galaxy studies.

 - **Abstract**
 The Sun's open-closed flux boundary (OCB) separates closed and open magnetic field lines, and is the site for interchange magnetic reconnection processes thought to be linked to the origin of the slow solar wind (SSW). We analyse the global magnetic field structure and OCB from December 2010 to December 2019 using three coronal magnetic field models: a potential field source surface (PFSS) model, a static equilibrium magnetofrictional model, and a time-dependent magnetofrictional model. We analyse the model and cycle dependence of the OCB length on the photosphere, as well as the magnetic flux in the vicinity of the OCB. Near solar maximum, the coronal magnetic field for each model consists predominantly of long, narrow coronal holes, and nearly all the open flux lies within one supergranule-diameter (25 Mm) of the OCB. By comparing to interplanetary scintillation measurements of SSW speeds, we argue that the fraction of open flux within this 25 Mm band is a good predictor of the amount of SSW in the heliosphere. Importantly, despite its simplicity, we show that the PFSS model estimates this fraction as well as the time-dependent model. We discuss the implications of our results for understanding SSW origins and interchange reconnection at the OCB.

 - **Abstract**
 This thesis investigates the evolution of galaxies in diverse environments, utilizing Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data to explore the impact of environmental richness on central and satellite galaxies across stellar mass ranges, compared to isolated systems. The sample is limited to 0.03 < z < 0.1 and apparent magnitudes brighter than 17.78, ensuring spectroscopic completeness and reliable stellar population estimates. Galaxies are categorized by environment as field or cluster/group systems, with further separation into satellites and centrals. By analyzing the star formation rate (SFR)-stellar mass plane, this work identifies systematic differences in the blue cloud (BC), green valley (GV), and red sequence (RS) across environments. Morphological and stellar population analyses reveal that T-type, metallicity, and stellar age transitions highlight the role of environmental quenching. A newly introduced T-Type \emph{vs.} specific SFR diagram provides evidence that morphological transformation precedes full quenching. Correlating galaxy properties with time since infall through projected phase space confirms the delayed-then-rapid quenching model for low- and intermediate-mass galaxies, extending it to morphology. Time-scales for quenching and morphological transitions are also derived as a function of stellar mass.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigated by means of MUSE/VLT observations the true size of the coronal line region (CLR) in a local sample of nine active galactic nuclei known for displaying prominent coronal emission. Our analysis show that the CLR is extended from several hundred parsecs to a few kiloparsecs in the lines of [Fe VII] (IP=99 eV) and [Fe X] (IP=235 eV). In all cases, the coronal emission is closely aligned along the radio-jet axis and constrained to the limits of the [O III] ionisation cone. Besides the nuclear emission, secondary emission peaks in [Fe VII] and [Fe X] are found along the extended emission, with a shallow decrease of the line intensity with increasing distance from the AGN. Both facts suggest the action of an additional excitation mechanism besides nuclear photoionisation for the origin of the coronal gas. This is further supported by the fact that in some sources the extended coronal emission accounts for more than 50\% of the total emission and by the high degree of gas excitation in the off-nuclear region. A positive trend between the coronal line luminosity and the jet power points to shocks induced by the jet passage as the key mechanism to produce and excite this gas. We provide the first estimate of the [Fe X] coronal gas size, being in the kpc range. Our results stress the importance of the CLR as a key ingredient that should be fully considered in models trying to explain the physics of the narrow line region in AGN.
#### A demarcation criterion for hydrogen burning of millinovae

 - **Abstract**
 Millinovae are a new class of transient supersoft X-ray sources with no clear signature of mass ejection. They show similar triangle shapes of $V/I$ band light curves with thousand times fainter peaks than typical classical novae. Maccarone et al. regarded the prototype millinova, ASASSN-16oh, as a dwarf nova and interpreted the supersoft X-rays to originate from an accretion belt on a white dwarf (WD). Kato et al. proposed a nova model induced by a high-rate mass-accretion during a dwarf nova outburst; the X-rays originate from the photosphere of a hydrogen-burning hot WD whereas the $V/I$ band photons are from the irradiated accretion disk. Because each peak brightness differs largely from millinova to millinova, we suspect that not all the millinova candidates host a hydrogen burning WD. Based on the light curve analysis of the classical nova KT Eri that has a bright disk, we find that the disk is more than two magnitudes brighter when the disk is irradiated by the hydrogen burning WD than when not irradiated. We present the demarcation criterion for hydrogen burning to be $I_{\rm q} - I_{\rm max} > 2.2$, where $I_q$ and $I_{\rm max}$ are the $I$ magnitudes in quiescence and at maximum light, respectively. Among many candidates, this requirement is satisfied with the two millinovae in which soft X-rays were detected.
#### Effects of intrinsic AGN variability on optical QPOs related to sub-pc binary black hole systems in broad line AGN

 - **Abstract**
 In this manuscript, an oversimplified model is proposed to test the effects of intrinsic AGN variability on expected optical quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) related to sub-pc binary black hole systems (BBHs) in broad line AGN. The commonly accepted CAR (Continuous AutoRegressive) process is applied to describe intrinsic AGN variability related to each BH accreting system in a sub-pc BBH system. Considering obscurations related to orbital rotations with periodicity $T_p$, artificial light curves including signals for optical QPOs can be built. Then, comparing the intrinsic periodicities $T_p$ with the measured robust periodicities $T_o$ through the artificial light curves, distributions of $T_p/T_o$ have four significant peaks around 1, 2, 3 and 4, leading less than half of the artificial light curves to have consistency between $T_o$ and $T_p$. Moreover, different collected model parameters have few effects on the distributions of $T_p/T_o$, indicating the effects of intrinsic AGN variability on optical QPOs are significantly strong and stable. Furthermore, after checking properties of optical QPOs in the light curves with different time steps, there are tiny effects of time steps on optical QPOs.

 - **Abstract**
 At present, there is a lack of effective probes to distinguish between mid-infrared (MIR) outbursts induced by tidal disruption events (TDEs) and changing-look active galactic nuclei (CLAGNs) based on only MIR data. Here, we propose that the time variation of MIR color (K-corrected W1-W2 after subtracting the quiescent fluxes) is a promising probe. With an optically selected sample containing TDEs, ambiguous nuclear transients (ANTs), and CLAGNs, we studied the MIR color variation of their MIR counterparts using NEOWISE-R data. We found that the MIR color of TDEs and ANTs turns red faster than CLAGNs during the rising phase, and TDEs have a redder color than ANTs at the earliest phase. The former may be caused by the difference between the ultraviolet light curves of TDEs/ANTs and CLAGNs, or be related to no or relatively weak underlying AGN in TDEs/ANTs, while the latter may be related to the difference in the dust geometry. Based on color variation rate, we selected high-probability TDE, ANT, and CLAGN candidates from MIR outbursts in samples of Jiang et al. (2021) and Masterson et al. (2024). We found that both samples are mixtures of TDEs/ANTs and CLAGNs. For MIR outbursts whose hosts are not Seyfert galaxies, we estimated that $\sim50\%-80\%$ are TDEs and inferred a rate of infrared TDEs of $1.5-2.8\times10^{-5}$ galaxy$^{-1}$ yr$^{-1}$, comparable with that of optical TDEs. The rest are CLAGNs, suggesting the presence of weak AGNs that cannot be identified using common diagnoses. We predicted that with our method, a large amount of dust-obscured TDEs could be selected from future infrared surveys with higher data quality and cadence.
#### C3PO IV: co-natal stars depleted in refractories are magnetically more active -- possible imprints of planets

 - **Abstract**
 Chemical abundance anomalies in twin stars have recently been considered tell-tale signs of interactions between stars and planets. While such signals are prevalent, their nature remains a subject of debate. On one hand, exoplanet formation may induce chemical depletion in host stars by locking up refractory elements. On the other hand, exoplanet engulfment can result in chemical enrichment, both processes potentially producing similar differential signals. In this study, we aim to observationally disentangle these processes by using the Ca II infrared triplet to measure the magnetic activity of 125 co-moving star pairs with high SNR, high-resolution spectra from the Magellan, Keck, and VLT telescopes. We find that co-natal star pairs in which the two stars exhibit significant chemical abundance differences also show differences in their magnetic activity, with stars depleted in refractories being magnetically more active. Furthermore, the strength of this correlation between differential chemical abundances and differential magnetic activity increases with condensation temperature. One possible explanation is that the chemical anomaly signature may be linked to planet formation, wherein refractory elements are locked into planets, and the host stars become more active due to more efficient contraction during the pre-main-sequence phase or star-planet tidal and magnetic interactions.
#### 3D non-LTE Ca II line formation in metal-poor FGK stars. I. Abundance corrections, radial velocity corrections, and synthetic spectra

 - **Abstract**
 The Ca II resonance doublet (HK) and the near-infrared triplet (CaT) are among the strongest features in stellar spectra of FGK-type stars. These spectral lines remain prominent down to extremely low metallicities and are thus useful for providing stellar parameters via ionisation balance and as radial velocity diagnostics. However, the majority of studies that model these lines in late-type stars still rely on one dimensional (1D) hydrostatic model atmospheres and the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). We present 3D non-LTE radiative transfer calculations of the CaT and HK lines in an extended grid of 3D model atmospheres of metal-poor FGK-type. We investigate the impact of 3D non-LTE effects on abundances, line bisectors and radial velocities. We used a subset of 3D model atmospheres from the recently published STAGGER-grid to synthesize spectra in 3D (non-)LTE. For comparison, similar calculations were performed in 1D (non-)LTE using models from the MARCS grid. Abundance corrections for the CaT lines relative to 1D LTE range from +0.1 to -1.0 dex, with more severe corrections for strong lines in giants. With fixed line strength, the abundance corrections become more negative with increasing effective temperature and decreasing surface gravity. Radial velocity corrections relative to 1D LTE based on cross-correlation of the whole line profile range from -0.2 km/s to +1.5 km/s, with more severe corrections where the CaT lines are strongest. The corrections are even more severe if the line core alone is used to infer the radial velocity. The line strengths and shapes, and consequently the abundance and radial velocity corrections, are strongly affected by the chosen radiative transfer assumption, 1/3D (non)-LTE. We release grids of theoretical spectra that can be used to improve the accuracy of stellar spectroscopic analyses based on the Ca II triplet lines.

 - **Abstract**
 This article focuses on NGC7538 IRS1, one of the most luminous and studied HC HII regions in the northern hemisphere. Our aim is to identify the young stellar objects (YSOs) embedded within the ionized gas and study their kinematic structures. This work expands on a recent survey called "Protostellar Outflows at the EarliesT Stages" (POETS), which has been devoted to studying young outflow emission on scales of 10-100 au near luminous YSOs, before they start photoionizing the surrounding medium. We carried out multi-epoch Very Long Baseline Array observations of the 22 GHz water masers toward NGC7538 IRS1 to measure the maser 3D velocities, which, following POETS' findings, are reliable tracers of the protostellar winds. Recently, we reobserved the water masers in NGC7538 IRS1 with sensitive global very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations to map weaker maser emission. Our study confirms the presence of two embedded YSOs, IRS1a and IRS1b, at the center of the two linear distributions of 6.7 GHz methanol masers observed in the southern and northern cores of the HC HII region, which have been previously interpreted in terms of edge-on rotating disks. The water masers trace an extended (~200 au) stationary shock front adjacent to the inner portion of the disk around IRS1a. This shock front corresponds to the edge of the southern tip of the ionized core and might be produced by the interaction of the disk wind ejected from IRS1a with the infalling envelope. The water masers closer to IRS1b follow the same LSR velocity (Vlsr) pattern of the 6.7~GHz masers rotating in the disk, but the direction and amplitude of the water maser proper motions are inconsistent with rotation. We propose that these water masers are tracing a photo-evaporated disk wind, where the maser Vlsr traces mainly the disk rotation and the proper motions the poloidal velocity of the wind.

 - **Abstract**
 We use archival JWST/NIRCam images in the F115W, F150W, and F200W filters to measure the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) magnitudes across the disk of the late-type spiral galaxy NGC 628. In this exploratory study, we demonstrate how the metallicity-dependence of TRGB magnitudes in the near-infrared (NIR) filters can be exploited by making use of the theoretical isochrones to determine metallicities of the fossil 10 Gyr old population over kiloparsec scales without being affected by the age-metallicity-reddening degeneracy. We obtain a smooth metallicity gradient that decreases from $Z$=0.003 in the central regions to $Z$=0.002 in the external parts, with a typical error on $Z$ of 0.0002. The extinction variation across the disk caused by the diffuse interstellar dust is spiky with a median value of $A_V$=0.12 mag. We propose that the large bubbles in the disks of galaxies offer dust-free lines of sight for measuring the TRGB magnitudes, and hence the distance to galaxies, to an accuracy that is as good as that of the halo populations. Using the Phantom Void, we obtain a TRGB distance modulus of 29.81$\pm0.05(\rm stat)\pm0.06(\rm sys)$ mag for NGC 628, which agrees well with the most recent PNLF measurement of 29.89$^{+0.06}_{-0.09}$ for this galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 Aims. In the low-collisional, partially ionized plasma (PIP) of solar prominences, uncharged emitters might show different signatures of magnetic line broadening than charged emitters. We investigate if the widths of weak metall emissions in prominences exceed the thermal line broadening by a different amount for charged and for uncharged emitters. Methods. We simultaneously observe five optically thin, weak metall lines in the brightness center of a quiescent prominence and compare their observed widths with the thermal broadening. Results. The inferred non-thermal broadening of the metall lines does not indicate systematic differences between the uncharged Mg b2 and Na D1 and the charged Fe II emitters, only Sr II is broader. Conclusions. The additional line broadening of charged emitters is reasonably attributed to magnetic forces. That of uncharged emitters can then come from their temporary state as ion before recombination. Magnetically induced velocities will retain some time after recombination. Modelling partially ionized plasmas then requires consideration of a memory of previous ionization states.

 - **Abstract**
 Type II Cepheids (T2Ceps), alongside RR Lyrae stars, serve as important distance indicators for old population II stars due to their period-luminosity (PL) relations. However, studies of these relations in the Sloan photometric system are rather limited in the literature. Our goal is to calibrate PL relations (and their counterparts in Wesenheit magnitudes) in the Sloan-Pan-STARSS gP1rP1iP1 bands for Galactic T2Ceps located in the vicinity of the Sun. We collected data for 16 T2Ceps of the BLHer type and 17 of the WVir type using 40 cm telescopes of the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network. Geometric parallaxes were adopted from Gaia Data Release 3. We have calibrated PL and period-Wesenheit relations for Milky Way BLHer and WVir stars in the solar neighborhood, as well as for a combined sample of both types. The relationships derived here will allow to determine the distances to T2Ceps that will be discovered by the Legacy Survey of Space and Time survey and, in turn, to probe the extended halo of the Milky Way, as well as the halos of nearby galaxies. To the best of our knowledge, the relations derived in this study are the first for Milky Way T2Ceps in the Sloan bands.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The nearby middle-aged gamma-ray pulsar J1741-2054 and its pulsar wind nebula (PWN) have been studied in X-rays, and its bow-shock nebula (BSN) has been investigated in the Balmer lines, but they have never been observed in far ultraviolet (FUV). Aims. To further study the thermal and magnetospheric emission from PSR J1741-2054 and the BSN properties, we observed them in the FUV range with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Methods. We imaged the target in two FUV filters of the HST's ACS/SBC detector. We also re-analyzed previous optical observations of the pulsar and its BSN. We fit the pulsar's FUV-optical spectrum separately and together with its X-ray spectrum. Results. We found that the pulsar's FUV-optical spectrum consists of a thermal and nonthermal components. A joint fit of the FUV-optical and X-ray spectra with combinations of a nonthermal and thermal components showed a hard optical nonthermal spectrum with a photon index $\Gamma_{opt} \approx 1.0-1.2$ and a softer X-ray component, $\Gamma_X \approx 2.6-2.7$. The thermal emission is dominated by the cold component with the temperature $kT_{cold}\approx 40-50$ eV and emitting sphere radius $R_{cold}\approx 8-15$ km, at $d=270$ pc. An additional hot thermal component, with $kT_{hot}\sim 80$ eV and $R_{hot}\sim 1$ km, is also possible. Such a spectrum resembles the spectra of other middle-aged pulsars, but it shows a harder (softer) optical (X-ray) nonthermal spectrum. We detected the FUV BSN, the first one associated with a middle-aged pulsar. Its closed-shell morphology is similar to the H$\alpha$ BSN morphology, while its FUV flux, $\sim10^{-13}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, is a factor of $\sim 4$ higher than the H$\alpha$ flux. This FUV BSN has a higher surface brightness than the two previously known ones.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent wide-field galaxy surveys have led to an explosion in numbers of galaxy-scale strong gravitational lens candidates. However, the vast majority feature massive luminous red galaxies as the main deflectors, with late-type galaxies being vastly under-represented. This work presents a dedicated search for lensing by edge-on late-type galaxies in the Ultraviolet Near Infrared Optical Northern Survey (UNIONS). The search covers $3600$ deg$^2$ of $r$-band observations taken from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. We consider all sources with magnitudes in the range $17 < r < 20.5$, without any colour preselection, yielding a parent sample of seven million sources. We characterise our parent sample via the visual inspection of $120\,000$ sources selected at random. From it, we estimate, with a 68\% confidence interval, that 1 in every $30\,000$ sources is an edge-on lens candidate, with at least eight high-quality candidates in the parent sample. This corresponds to 1 candidate per $17\,000$ edge-on late-type galaxies. Our search relies on a convolutional neural network (CNN) to select a reduced sample of candidates, followed by a visual inspection to curate the final sample. The CNN is trained from scratch using simulated $r$-band observations of edge-on lenses, and real observations of non-lenses. We find 61 good edge-on lens candidates using the CNN. Moreover, combining the CNN candidates with those found serendipitously, and those identified while characterising the parent sample, we discovered 4 grade A, 20 grade B, and 58 grade C edge-on lens candidates; effectively doubling the known sample of these systems. We also discovered 16 grade A, 16 grade B, and 18 grade C lens candidates of other types. Finally, based on the characterisation of the parent sample, we estimate that our search found around 60\% of the bright grade A and B edge-on lens candidates within the parent sample.
