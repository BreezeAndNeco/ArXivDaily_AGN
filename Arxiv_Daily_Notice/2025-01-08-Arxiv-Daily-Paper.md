 - **Abstract**
 Using a recent Chandra ACIS observation of the eclipsing cataclysmic variable (CV) V1460 Her (2MASS J16211735+4412541) with a fast-rotating ($P_{\rm spin} = 38.9$~s) white dwarf, we estimated a flux $F_{0.5-7 {\rm keV}}^{\rm abs} = (1.9\pm 0.5)\times 10^{-14}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, a factor of $\sim7$ lower than found from previous Swift XRT observations $\approx8$ years ago, when the CV was quiescent. The drop in the flux suggests a corresponding drop in the accretion rate, and the resulting intrinsic luminosity $L_{0.5-7 {\rm keV}} \sim 1.6\times 10^{29}$ erg s$^{-1}$ places V1460 Her among the lowest-luminosity magnetic CVs known, in a state of very low accretion.

 - **Abstract**
 Wet extreme mass-ratio inspirals (wet EMRIs), which arise from stellar-mass black holes (sBHs) inspiral into supermassive black holes (SMBHs) within the gas-rich environments of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), are primary sources of gravitational waves (GWs) for space-borne detectors like LISA, TianQin, and Taiji. Unlike "dry EMRIs", which form through gravitational scattering in nuclear star clusters, wet EMRIs are naturally accompanied by interactions with accretion disks, offering rich multi-messenger science opportunities. They are distinct in generating transient electromagnetic (EM) signals, such as quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs), which serve as valuable probes of accretion disk physics and SMBH environments. Their GW signals provide an unprecedented precision of the order of $O(10^{-4}\sim 10^{-6})$ in measuring SMBH mass and spin, enabling the calibration of traditional EM techniques and offering insights into jet formation models. Additionally, wet EMRIs serve as bright and dark sirens for cosmology, facilitating percent-level precision measurements of Hubble parameter through AGN host identification or statistical association. These systems hold immense potential for advancing our understanding of black hole dynamics, accretion physics, and cosmology.

 - **Abstract**
 Pulsar polarization profiles are critical for understanding their magnetospheric structures and radiation mechanisms. We present polarization profile measurements for 25 pulsars in globular clusters (GCs) from the observation of the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). The diversity of polarization profiles shows complex magnetic structure and emission pattern of pulsars. Among these, the polarization profiles of 15 pulsars were firstly measured. M53A present a 57\% linear polarization ratio, being highest among these 25 GC pulsars. M15H present a 42\% circular polarization ratio, which is the highest among these 25 pulsars. The average ratios of circular and absolute circular polarization of these GC pulsars are -1\% and 10\% respectively, lower than normal pulsars measured with Parkes (\citealt{Oswald2023}), which are 5\% and 32\%, respectively. The Rotation Measure (RM) values of each pulsar were measured, giving the range of pulsar(s) from M3, M5, M15, M71, M53, NGC6517, NGC6539, NGC6760 being 8(1) to 16(1) rad $m^{-2}$, -1(2) to -4(6) rad $m^{-2}$, -70(2) to -76(1) rad $m^{-2}$, -480(14) rad $m^{-2}$ (M71A only), -2(1) rad $m^{-2}$ (M53A only), 187(1) to 212(2) rad $m^{-2}$, 109(1) rad $m^{-2}$ (NGC6539A only), and 102(1) to 129(4) rad $m^{-2}$. The GCs closer to the Galactic plane (GP) tend to have larger RM. This is consistent with previous study (\citealt{Hutschenreuter2022}).
#### Decameter-sized Earth impactors -- I: Orbital properties

 - **Abstract**
 Numerous decameter-sized asteroids have been observed impacting Earth as fireballs. These objects can have impact energies equivalent to hundreds of kilotons of TNT, posing a hazard if they impact populated areas. Previous estimates of meteoroid flux using fireball observations have shown an Earth impact rate for decameter-size objects of about once every $2$-$3$ years. In contrast, telescopic estimates of the near-Earth asteroid population predict the impact rate of such objects to be of order $20$-$40$ years, an order-of-magnitude difference. While the cause of this discrepancy remains unclear, tidal disruption of a larger near-Earth body has been proposed as an explanation for these excess decameter-sized impactors. The release in 2022 of previously classified United States Government (USG) satellite sensor data for fireball events has provided a wealth of new information on many of these impacts. Using this newly available USG sensor data, we present the first population-level study characterizing the orbital and dynamical properties of 14 decameter-sized Earth impactors detected by USG sensors since 1994, with a particular focus on searching for evidence of tidal disruption as the cause of the impact rate discrepancy. We find there is no evidence for recent ($\lesssim 10^4$ years) tidal disruption and weak evidence for longer-term tidal disruption in the decameter impactor population, but that the latter conclusion is limited by small number statistics. We also investigate the origins of both the impactor and near-Earth asteroid populations of decameter-sized objects from the main asteroid belt. We find that both populations generally originate from the same source regions: primarily from the $\nu_6$ secular resonance ($\sim70$%) with small contributions from the Hungaria group ($\sim20$%) and the 3:1 Jupiter mean-motion resonance ($\sim10$%).
#### Little Red Dots are Tidal Disruption Events in Runaway-Collapsing Clusters

 - **Abstract**
 I hypothesize a physical explanation for the "Little Red Dots" (LRDs) discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The first star formation in the universe occurs in dense clusters, some of which may undergo runaway collapse and form an intermediate mass black hole. This process would appear as a very dense stellar system, with recurring tidal disruption events (TDEs) as stellar material is accreted by the black hole. Such a system would be compact, UV-emitting, and exhibit broad H-alpha emission. If runaway collapse is the primary mechanism for forming massive black hole seeds, this process could be fairly common and explain the large volume densities of LRDs. In order to match the predicted number density of runaway collapse clusters, the tidal disruption rate must be on the order of 10^-4 per year. A top-heavy stellar initial mass function may be required to match observations without exceeding the predicted LambdaCDM mass function. The TDE LRD hypothesis can be verified with followup JWST observations looking for TDE-like variability.

 - **Abstract**
 Hydrogen-poor supernovae (SNe) of Type Ibc are explosions of massive stars that lost their hydrogen envelopes, typically due to interactions with a binary companion. We consider the case where the natal kick imparted to the neutron star (NS) or black hole (BH) remnant brings the compact object to a collision with a main-sequence companion, eventually leading to full tidal disruption of the companion. Subsequently, super-Eddington accretion onto the NS/BH launches a powerful, fast wind which collides with the SN ejecta and efficiently converts the kinetic energy of the wind into radiation. The radiation is reprocessed by the surrounding ejecta into a luminous ($\sim 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at peak), days to months-long transient with optical peaks from $-19$ to $-21$ mag, comparable to (super)luminous Type Ibc SNe and fast blue optical transients (FBOTs) like AT2018cow. From a Monte-Carlo analysis we estimate the fraction of tidal disruptions following SNe in binaries to be $\sim 0.1$--$1$\%, roughly compatible with the event rates of these luminous SNe. At the broad-brush level, our model reproduces the multi-wavelength and spectral observations of FBOTs, and has the potential to explain peculiar features seen in some (super)luminous SNe which are difficult to reproduce by the conventional magnetar spindown mechanism, such as late-time hydrogen lines, bumpy light curves, and pre-peak excess.
#### On stellar hotspots due to star-planet magnetic interactions: How much power can actually be transmitted to the chromosphere?

 - **Abstract**
 Star-Planet Magnetic Interactions (SPMI) have been proposed as a mechanism for generating stellar hot-spots with energy outputs on the order of $10^{19-21}$ watts. This interaction is primarily believed to be mediated by Alfvén waves propagating towards the star. The stellar atmosphere dictates where and how much of this incoming energy can actually be deposited as heat. The stellar transition region separating the chromosphere from the corona of cool stars gives rise to a significant variation of the Alfvén speed over a short distance, and therefore a reflection of the Alfvén waves at the transition region is naturally expected. We aim to characterize the efficiency of energy transfer due to SPMI by quantifying a frequency dependent reflection of the wave energy at the stellar transition region and its transmission to the stellar chromosphere. Magnetohydrodynamic simulations are employed to model the frequency-dependent propagation of Alfvén waves through a realistic background stellar wind profile. The transmission efficiency as a function of the wave frequency is quantified, and further analysis is conducted to characterize the overall energy transfer efficiency of SPMI in several candidate systems where chromospheric hotspots have been tentatively detected. Low-frequency waves experience greater reflection compared to high-frequency waves, resulting in reduced energy transfer efficiency for lower frequencies. Conversely, the parametric decay instability of Alfvén waves substantially diminishes the energy transfer efficiency at higher frequencies. As a result, there exists a frequency range where energy transfer is most efficient. A significant fraction of the Alfvén wave energy is reflected at the stellar transition region, and in most realistic scenarios, the transmission efficiency to the chromosphere is found to be approximately 10 percent.

 - **Abstract**
 With the rapidly increasing rate of microlensing planet detections, microlensing modeling software faces significant challenges in computation efficiency. Here, we develop the Twinkle code, an efficient and robust binary-lens modeling software suite optimized for heterogeneous computing devices, especially GPUs. Existing microlensing codes have the issue of catastrophic cancellation that undermines the numerical stability and precision, and Twinkle resolves them by refining the coefficients of the binary-lens equation. We also devise an improved method for robustly identifying ghost images, thereby enhancing computational reliability. We have advanced the state of the art by optimizing Twinkle specifically for heterogeneous computing devices by taking into account the unique task and cache memory dispatching patterns of GPUs, while the compatibility with the traditional computing architectures of CPUs is still maintained. Twinkle has demonstrated an acceleration of approximately 2 orders of magnitude (>~100 times) on contemporary GPUs. The enhancement in computational speed of Twinkle will translate to the delivery of accurate and highly efficient data analysis for ongoing and upcoming microlensing projects. Both GPU and CPU versions of Twinkle are open-source and publicly available.

 - **Abstract**
 Thorne-Żytkow Objects (TŻOs) have been predicted to form when a neutron star is engulfed by a diffuse, convective giant envelope. Accretion onto a neutron star at a rate that is larger than $10^{-4}\, M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ is expected to lead to significant emission of neutrinos of all flavors with energy of 1-100 MeV. Since the neutrino signal is expected to largely vary in time (from milliseconds to thousands of years), we outline detection strategies tailored to the signal duration. We find that neutrino detection from TŻOs up to the Small Magellanic Cloud is within the reach of current- and next-generation neutrino observatories, such as Super- and Hyper-Kamiokande, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, and JUNO. Interestingly, if targeted searches for neutrinos from TŻO candidates (e.g. VX Sgr in our Galaxy as well as HV 2112 and HV 11417 in the Small Magellanic Cloud) should lead to positive results, neutrinos could positively identify the nature of such sources and their accretion rate. Our findings should serve as motivation for establishing dedicated searches for neutrino emission from TŻOs. This is especially timely since it is challenging to detect TŻOs via electromagnetic radiation unambiguously, and the TŻO gravitational wave signal could be probed with next-generation detectors for sources within our Galaxy only.
#### Time-resolved Hubble Space Telescope UV observations of an X-ray quasi-periodic eruption source

 - **Abstract**
 X-ray quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are a novel mode of variability in nearby galactic nuclei whose origin remains unknown. Their multi-wavelength properties are poorly constrained, as studies have focused almost entirely on the X-ray band. Here we report on time-resolved, coordinated Hubble Space Telescope far ultraviolet and XMM-Newton X-ray observations of the shortest period X-ray QPE source currently known, eRO-QPE2. We detect a bright UV point source ($L_{\rm FUV} \approx {\rm few} \times 10^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$) that does not show statistically significant variability between the X-ray eruption and quiescent phases. This emission is unlikely to be powered by a young stellar population in a nuclear stellar cluster. The X-ray-to-UV spectral energy distribution can be described by a compact accretion disk ($R_{\rm out} = 343^{+202}_{-138} \ R_{\rm g}$). Such compact disks are incompatible with typical disks in active galactic nuclei, but form naturally following the tidal disruption of a star. Our results rule out models (for eRO-QPE2) invoking i) a classic AGN accretion disk and ii) no accretion disk at all. For orbiter models, the expected radius derived from the timing properties would naturally lead to disk-orbiter interactions for both quasi-spherical and eccentric trajectories. We infer a black hole mass of log$_{10}(M_{\rm BH}) = 5.9 \pm 0.3$ M$_{\odot}$ and Eddington ratio of 0.13$^{+0.18}_{-0.07}$; in combination with the compact outer radius this is inconsistent with existing disk instability models. After accounting for the quiescent disk emission, we constrain the ratio of X-ray to FUV luminosity of the eruption component to be $L_{\rm X} / L_{\rm FUV} > 16-85$ (depending on the intrinsic extinction).

 - **Abstract**
 We present Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph observations from the Hubble Space Telescope of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the center of PKS0745-191, a brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) undergoing powerful radio-mode AGN feedback ($P_{\rm cav}\sim5\times10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$). These high-resolution data offer the first spatially resolved map of gas dynamics within a SMBHs sphere of influence under such powerful feedback. Our results reveal the presence of highly chaotic, non-rotational ionized gas flows on sub-kpc scales, in contrast to the more coherent flows observed on larger scales. While radio-mode feedback effectively thermalizes hot gas in galaxy clusters on kiloparsec scales, within the core, the hot gas flow may decouple, leading to a reduction in angular momentum and supplying ionized gas through cooling, which could enhance accretion onto the SMBH. This process could, in turn, lead to a self-regulating feedback loop. Compared to other BCGs with weaker radio-mode feedback, where rotation is more stable, intense feedback may lead to more chaotic flows, indicating a stronger coupling between jet activity and gas dynamics. Additionally, we observe a sharp increase in velocity dispersion near the nucleus, consistent with a very massive $M_{\rm BH}\sim1.5\times10^{10} M_\odot$ SMBH. The density profile of the ionized gas is also notably flat, paralleling the profiles observed in X-ray gas around galaxies where the Bondi radius is resolved. These results provide valuable insights into the complex mechanisms driving galaxy evolution, highlighting the intricate relationship between SMBH fueling and AGN feedback within the host galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 Using multi-viewpoint observations from STEREO and SOHO during three solar cycles from 23 to 25, we study the magnetic flux rope (MFR) structures of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) near the Sun and magnetic clouds (MCs) at 1au. The study aims to investigate two phenomena: 1) the occurrence rate of CMEs near Hale sector boundaries (HBs) and 2) solar-cycle variation of MFR axial orientations in CMEs and MCs. Our preliminary results include: 1) the axes of MFRs in cycle 25 present a systematic northward orientation, which is the same as in cycle 23 but opposite to cycle 24; 2) the majority of the MFRs occurred near HBs (within 30 degrees) and some exceptional events occurred at non-HBs; 3) the axial fields in MCs present a similar north-south orientation, which changes from cycle to cycle. We discuss the implication of solar cycle variations of MFR axial orientations for space weather forecasts.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the results from a study of two massive ($M_{500c} > 6.0 \times 10^{14} M_{\odot}$) strong lensing clusters selected from the South Pole Telescope cluster survey for their high Einstein radius ($R_E > 40''$), SPT-CLJ2325$-$4111 and SPT-CLJ0049$-$2440. Ground-based and shallow HST imaging indicated extensive strong lensing evidence in these fields, with giant arcs spanning 18\arcsec\ and 31\arcsec, respectively, motivating further space-based imaging followup. Here, we present multiband HST imaging and ground-based Magellan spectroscopy of the fields, from which we compile detailed strong lensing models. The lens models of SPT-CL\,J2325$-$4111 and SPT-CL\,J0049$-$2440 were optimized using 9, and 8 secure multiple-imaged systems with a final image-plane rms of 0\farcs63 and 0\farcs73, respectively. From the lensing analysis, we measure the projected mass density within 500~kpc of $M(<500 ~{\rm kpc}) = 7.30\pm0.07 \times 10^{14}$$M_{\odot}$, and $M(<500 ~{\rm kpc})=7.12^{+0.16}_{-0.19}\times 10^{14}$ $M_{\odot}$ for these two clusters, and a sub-halos mass ratio of $0.12\pm{0.01}$ and $0.21^{+0.07}_{-0.05}$, respectively. Both clusters produce a large area with high magnification ($\mu\geq 3$) for a source at $z=9$, $A^{lens}_{| \mu | \geq 3 }=4.93^{+0.03}_{-0.04} arcmin^2$, and $A^{lens}_{| \mu | \geq 3 }=3.64^{+0.14}_{-0.10} arcmin^2$ respectively, placing them in the top tier of strong lensing clusters. We conclude that these clusters are spectacular sightlines for further observations that will reduce the systematic uncertainties due to cosmic variance. This paper provides the community with two additional well-calibrated cosmic telescopes, as strong as the Frontier Fields, suitable for studies of the highly magnified background Universe.
#### Empirical Modeling of Magnetic Braking in Millisecond Pulsars to Measure the Local Dark Matter Density and Effects of Orbiting Satellite Galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel method that enables us to estimate the acceleration of individual millisecond pulsars (MSPs) using only their spin period and its time derivative. For our binary MSP sample, we show that one can obtain an empirical calibration of the magnetic braking term that relies only on observed quantities. We find that such a model for magnetic braking is only valid for MSPs with small surface magnetic field strengths ($<3\times10^8$ G) and large characteristic ages ($>$ 5 Gyr). With this method we are able to effectively double the number of pulsars with line-of-sight acceleration measurements, from 28 to 54 sources. This expanded dataset leads to an updated measurement of the total density in the midplane, which we find to be $\rho_0$ = 0.086 $\pm$ 0.001 stat. $\pm$ 0.006 sys. M$_\odot$/pc$^3$, and an updated measurement of the local dark matter density, which we calculate to be $\rho_{0,\mathrm{DM}}$ = 0.014 $\pm$ 0.005 stat. $\pm$ 0.006 sys. M$_\odot$/pc$^3$ (0.53 $\pm$ 0.30 GeV/cm$^3$). This updated value for $\rho_{0,\mathrm{DM}}$ is in good agreement with literature values derived from kinematic estimates. We show that each new acceleration measurement improves the precision of $\rho_{0,\mathrm{DM}}$ by the same amount as roughly 10$^5$ stars. The pulsar accelerations are very asymmetric above and below the disk; we show that the shape and size of this asymmetry can be largely explained by the north-south asymmetry of disk star counts and the offset in the Milky Way disk and halo centers of mass due to the Large Magellanic Cloud.
#### The Quasar Feedback Survey: zooming into the origin of radio emission with e-MERLIN

 - **Abstract**
 We present 6 GHz e-MERLIN observations of 42 $z<0.2$ type 1 and type 2 mostly radio-quiet quasars ($L_{\rm[OIII]}\gtrsim10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$; $L_{\rm AGN}\gtrsim10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$) from the Quasar Feedback Survey. The nature and origin of radio emission in these types of sources is typically ambiguous based on all-sky, low-resolution surveys. With e-MERLIN, we investigate radio emission on sub-kiloparsec scales ($\sim$10s-100s pc). We find 37/42 quasars are detected, with a diversity of radio morphologies, including compact cores, knots and extended jet-like structures, with sizes of 30-540 pc. Based on morphology and brightness temperature, we classify 76 per cent of the quasars as radio-AGN, compared to the $\sim$57 per cent identified as radio-AGN at the $\sim$1-60 kpc scales probed in prior studies. Combining results from e-MERLIN and the Very Large Array, 86 per cent reveal a radio-AGN. On average, $\sim$60 per cent of the total radio flux is resolved away in the e-MERLIN maps, and is likely dominated by jet-driven lobes and outflow-driven shocks. We find no significant differences in measured radio properties between type 1 and type 2 quasars, and estimate sub-relativistic jet speeds of $\sim$0.2-0.3c and modest jet powers of $P_\mathrm{jet} \approx \times$10$^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$ for the few targets, where these measurements were possible. These quasars share characteristics with compact radio-selected populations, and the global radio emission likely traces strong interactions between the AGN (jets/outflows) and their host galaxy ISM from 10s parsec to 10s kiloparsec scales.
#### The Galactic Bulge exploration IV.: RR~Lyrae stars as traces of the Galactic bar -- 3D and 5D analysis, extinction variation

 - **Abstract**
 We created new reddening maps and derived new extinction laws from visual to near-infrared passbands using improved RR~Lyrae period-absolute magnitude-metallicity relations, thus enabling distance estimates for individual bulge RR~Lyrae variables. The extinction law is most uniform in RIK and RJK and the distances to individual RR~Lyrae based on these colors are determined with an accuracy six and four percent, respectively. Using only the near-infrared passbands for distance estimation we inferred the distance to the Galactic center equal to djk = 8.2 +- 0.001(stat) +- 0.53(sys)pc after geometrical correction. We show that variations in the extinction law toward the Galactic bulge can mimic a barred spatial distribution in the bulge RR~Lyrae star population in visual passbands. This arises from a gradient in extinction differences along Galactic longitudes and latitudes, which can create the perception of the Galactic bar, particularly when using visual passband-based distances. A barred angle in the RR~Lyrae spatial distribution disappears when near-infrared passband-based distances are used, as well as when reddening law variations are incorporated in visual passband-based distances. The prominence of the bar, as traced by RR~Lyrae stars, depends on their metallicity, with metal-poor RR~Lyrae stars ([Fe/H]<-1.0dex) showing little to no tilt with respect to the bar. Metal-rich ([Fe/H]>-1.0dex) RR~Lyrae stars do show a barred/bulge signature in spatial properties derived using near-infrared distances, with an angle {\iota} = 18 +- 5deg, consistent with previous bar measurements from the literature. The 5D kinematic analysis, primarily based on transverse velocities, indicates a rotational lag in RR~Lyrae stars compared to red clump giants. Despite variations in the extinction law, our kinematic conclusions are robust across different distance estimation methods.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an independent validation and comprehensive re-calibration of S-PLUS Ultra-Short Survey (USS) DR1 12-band photometry using about 30,000--70,000 standard stars from the BEst STar (BEST) database. We identify spatial variation of zero-point offsets, up to 30--40\,mmag for blue filters ($u$, $J0378$, $J0395$) and 10\,mmag for others, predominantly due to the higher uncertainties of the technique employed in the original USS calibration. Moreover, we detect large- and medium-scale CCD position-dependent systematic errors, up to 50\,mmag, primarily caused by different aperture and flat-field corrections. We then re-calibrate the USS DR1 photometry by correcting the systematic shifts for each tile using second-order two-dimensional polynomial fitting combined with a numerical stellar flat-field correction method. The re-calibrated results from the XPSP and the SCR standards are consistent within 6\,mmag in the USS zero-points, demonstrating both the typical precision of re-calibrated USS photometry and a sixfold improvement in USS zero-point precision. Further validation using SDSS and Pan-STARRS1, as well as LAMOST DR10 and Gaia photometry, also confirms this precision for the re-calibrated USS photometry. Our results clearly demonstrate the capability and the efficiency of the BEST database in improving calibration precision to the milli-magnitude level for wide-field photometric surveys. The re-calibrated USS DR1 photometry is publicly available (\href{this https URL}{doi: https://doi.org/10.12149/101503}).

 - **Abstract**
 Solar flares release magnetic energy through reconnection, accelerating electrons into nonthermal velocity distributions, including crescent-shaped electron populations. These energetic electron distributions are crucial in driving instabilities which can lead to distinct electromagnetic emissions. This study investigates the emission properties of crescent-shaped electron velocity distribution functions (EVDFs) under different frequency ratios ($\omega_{pe}/\Omega_{ce}$), critical for understanding plasma conditions in various astrophysical environments, by comparing the emissions and intensities of waves among different cases. Here, we study and analyze three distinct frequency ratio conditions (2.2, 10, and 1, designated as cases A, B, and C, respectively). We found that the beam-Langmuir (BL) and upper-hybrid (UH) modes can be efficiently excited, leading to further plasma emissions in different cases. Our study reveals that the fundamental (O/F) emission can reach a maximum value of $\sim$$10^{-4} E_{\mathrm{k}0}$, while the harmonics (H) can extend to $\sim$$1.5 \times 10^{-5} E_{\mathrm{k}0}$ depending on the frequency ratio of the environment. The intensity of the fundamental mode exceeds previous findings for pure-ring, beam, and ring-beam distributions, highlighting the impact of crescent-shaped electron velocity distributions on wave excitation and emission processes. This effect is notably influenced by different frequency ratios, offering new insights into the way that nonthermal electron distributions affect the plasma emission process.

 - **Abstract**
 We present broadband X-ray observations of the High Mass X-ray Binary (HMXB) pulsar SMC X-2, using concurrent NuSTAR and NICER observations during its 2022 outburst. The source is found to be spinning with a period of 2.37281(3) s. We confirm the existence of cyclotron resonant scattering feature (CRSF) at 31 keV in addition to the iron emission line in the X-ray continuum of the source. Spectral analysis performed with the physical bulk and thermal Comptonization model indicates that the bulk Comptonization dominates the thermal Comptonization. Using phase-resolved spectroscopy, we have investigated the variations of the spectral parameters relative to pulse phase that may be due to the complex structure of magnetic field of the pulsar or the impact of the emission geometry. It is observed that the spectral parameters exhibit significant variabilities relative to the pulsed phase. Time-resolved spectroscopy is employed to examine the evolution of the continuum and changes in the spectral characteristics. Measurements of luminosity along with variations in cyclotron line energy and photon index suggest that the source may be accreting in the super-critical regime.

 - **Abstract**
 The existence of a strange quark star (QS) predicted in the Bodmer-Witten hypothesis has been a matter of debate. The combustion from a neutron star to a strange QS in its accreted process in a low-mass X-ray binary is proposed to be a scenario that generates gamma-ray bursts (GRBs); the baryon contamination of the outflow is very low and mainly from the masses of crusts ($M_{\rm crust}$) of QSs. A special subset of GRBs detected in the past 16 years are collected and used to estimate $M_{\rm crust}$ under this assumption of QSs as central engines. Correspondingly, $M_{\rm crust}$ is calculated in the frameworks of several models for cold dense quark matter (MIT bag model and Nambu-Jona-Lasino model with or without the impacts from the formation of color superconducting condensates being considered), for comparison with the observation. In conclusion, we find that the GRB samples have so far failed to provide positive support for this hypothesis.

 - **Abstract**
 Coronal holes are thought to be composed of relatively broad columnar structures known as plumes. Here we demonstrate that the plumes (and inter-plumes) in polar coronal holes are composed of fine-scale filamentary structure, with average scales of 2-10$^{\arcsec}$. The fine structure is the off-limb analogue of the previously found 'plumelets' of \cite{Uritsky_2021}. The off-limb observations enable an examination of the fine-structure without the influence of the underlying atmosphere along the line of sight. Hence, we show that the fine-scale structure is present at least until the edge of the field of view of the Solar Dynamics Observatory. The fine structure is found to have spatial distribution that follows a $k^{-1}$ power law perpendicular to the inferred magnetic field direction. For a small sample of the fine structure, the cross-sectional profiles are measured as a function of height. In some cases, the measurements indicate that the fine structure expands super-radially, consistent with existing models of polar field expansion and the expansion of the plumes. We discuss the implications of the presence of the fine structure with respect to understanding wave propagation in the coronal holes and their contribution to powering the solar wind.

 - **Abstract**
 T Tauri stars and their discs are crucial for understanding stellar evolution and the formation of planets in low-mass systems. These stars exhibit significant variability, notably emitting intense X-ray flares due to magnetic reconnection events. During these events, magnetic energy is converted into kinetic energy of particles. Some of these particles then heat the plasma of the underlying chromosphere, emitting the observed X-rays. A portion of particles are thought to escape the chromosphere to interact with the surrounding circumstellar environment. The question is what impact do particles produced by magnetic reconnection events have on the discs of young stars. The complex characteristics of protoplanetary discs around T Tauri stars require an interdisciplinary strategy to enhance our understanding of these objects. This thesis contribute to establish a framework combining observational methodologies, chemical and dynamic models of protoplanetary discs, and the mechanics of acceleration and transport of energetic particles. We indroduce the role of ionisation in disc dynamics, including its sources. Not only from standard sources like stellar radiation and galactic cosmic rays but also from non-thermal ionisation due to magnetic reconnection events. We then examine energetic particles accelerated during magnetic reconnection events in T Tauri flares as an alternative source of ionisation, requiring the construction of a theoretical model based on solar flares. Then, we present a study revealing that particles from magnetic reconnection events could significantly contribute to the ionisation of the inner disc. Finally, we present a complementary study accounting for temporal effects, showing that considering these particles could increase the ionisation rate as well as viscosity, accretion rate, volumetric heating rate, and chemical complexity of inner protoplanetary discs.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Blazars are a distinct subclass of active galactic nuclei (AGN), known for their fast variability, high polarization, and intense emission across the electromagnetic spectrum, from radio waves to gamma rays. Gamma-ray blazar candidates of uncertain type (BCU) are an ongoing challenge in gamma-ray astronomy due to difficulties in classification and redshift determination. Aims. This study continues an optical spectroscopic campaign aimed at identifying the characteristics of BCUs to improve classification and redshift estimates, particularly focusing on low-synchrotron-peak sources. Methods. We conducted a detailed analysis of optical spectroscopic data for a sample of 21 low-synchrotron-peak BCUs plus one bl lac with contradictory results in the literature, using the 3.58-m Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (TNG, La Palma, Spain). Results. Our analysis identifies 14 out of the 21 BCUs as flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs), demonstrating the effectiveness of our selection criteria. Notably, four FSRQs have redshifts exceeding 1, including 4FGL J2000.0+4214 at z = 2.04. Six sources are classified as bl lacs, with one of them, 4FGL J0746.5-0719, showing a featureless spectrum in this work despite previously exhibiting strong lines, suggesting it may be a changing-look blazar. One source remains classified as a BCU due to a noisy spectrum. Additionally, we observed a bl lac object, 4FGL J1054.5+2211, due to inconsistent redshift estimates in the literature, but we could not confirm any redshift due to its featureless spectrum. Our findings provide insights into the classification and redshift estimation of blazar candidates, emphasizing the need for continued spectroscopic monitoring.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The Sun is a privileged laboratory of stellar evolution, thanks to the quality and complementary nature of available constraints. Using these observations, we are able to draw a detailed picture of its internal structure and dynamics which form the basis of the successes of solar modelling. Amongst such constraints, the depletion of lithium and beryllium are key tracers of the required efficiency and extent of macroscopic mixing just below the solar convective envelope. Thanks to revised determinations of these abundances, we may use them in conjunction with other existing spectroscopic and helioseismic constraints to study in detail the properties of macroscopic transport. Aims. We aim at constraining the efficiency of macroscopic transport at the base of the convective envelope and determining the compatibility of the observations with a suggested candidate linked with the transport of angular momentum in the solar radiative interior. Methods. We use recent spectroscopic observations of lithium and beryllium abundance and include them in solar evolutionary model calibrations. We test the agreement of such models in terms of position of the convective envelope, helium mass fraction in convective zone, sound speed profile inversions and neutrino fluxes. Results. We constrain the required efficiency and extent of the macroscopic mixing at the base of the solar convective envelope, finding that a power law of density with an index n between 3 and 6 would reproduce the data, with efficiencies at the base of the envelope of about 6000 cm2 /s, depending on the value of n. We also confirm that macroscopic mixing worsens the agreement with neutrino fluxes and that the current implementations of the magnetic Tayler instability are unable to explain the observations.
#### Implications of the intriguing constant inner mass surface density observed in dark matter halos

 - **Abstract**
 It is known for long that the observed mass surface density of cored dark matter (DM) halos is approximately constant, independently of the galaxy mass (i.e., rhoc X rc simeq constant}, with rhoc and rc the central volume density and the radius of the core, respectively). Here we review the evidence supporting this empirical fact as well as its theoretical interpretation. It seems to be an emergent law resulting from the concentration-halo mass relation predicted by the current cosmological model, where the DM is made of collisionless cold DM particles (CDM). We argue that the prediction rhoc X rc simeq constant is not specific to this particular model of DM but holds for any other DM model (e.g., self-interacting) or process (e.g., stellar or AGN feedback) that redistributes the DM within halos conserving its CDM mass. In addition, the fact that rhoc X rc simeq constant is shown to allow the estimate of the core DM mass and baryon fraction from stellar photometry alone, particularly useful when the observationally-expensive conventional spectroscopic techniques are unfeasible.

 - **Abstract**
 Fanaroff-Riley (FR) type 0 radio galaxies are a subclass of radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN) that lack extended kpc-scale jets, different from the classical FRI and FRII radio galaxies. They constitute the most abundant population of radio galaxies in the local Universe (z<0.1), yet remain largely unexplored. VLBI observations of a limited number of FR0s demonstrated that their central supermassive black hole (SMBH) are able to lunch mostly two-sided jets, with mildly relativistic bulk speed. In this work, we highlight the need of further high-resolution radio observations to probe the jet structures of these compact radio galaxies, by showing exploratory results of our EVN+eMERLIN observation campaign of FR0s. A preliminary analysis of these recent data reveals a possible change of the jet direction at different scales. We shortly discuss their physical conditions to explain the observed jet compactness, stressing the role of the SMBH spin vector in shaping their radio morphology

 - **Abstract**
 The black hole X-ray binary GRS 1915+105 was bright for 26 years since its discovery and is well-known for its disk instabilities, quasi-periodic oscillations, and disk wind signatures. We report a long-term spectral-timing tracing of this source from mid-2017 until the onset of the "obscured state", based on the complete data from the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) and the Insight--Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (HXMT), whose hard coverage decisively informs the modeling at lower energies. In the soft state predating 2018, we observed highly ionized winds. However, in the hard state shortly before transitioning into the "obscured state" on May 14, 2019 (MJD 58617), the winds exhibited a discernible reduction in ionization degree ($\log \xi$), decreasing from above 4 to approximately 3. Our analysis involves the measurement of the frequencies of the quasi-periodic oscillations and the estimation of the properties of the ionized winds and the intensities of different spectral components through spectroscopy during the decay phase. We delve into the origin of these infrequently observed warm outflows in the hard state. It is found that the launching radius of the winds in the hard decay phase is similar to that in the soft state, indicating the launching mechanism of those winds in both states is likely the same. The presence of the ionized winds is preferentially dependent on the periphery of the accretion disk, but not directly related to the corona activities in the center of the binary system.

 We present the most extensive set to date of high-quality RR Lyrae light curve templates in the griz bands, based on time-series observations of the Dark Energy Camera Plane Survey (DECaPS) East field, located in the Galactic bulge at coordinates (RA, DEC)(J2000) = (18:03:34, -29:32:02), obtained with the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) on the 4-m Blanco telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO). Our templates, which cover both fundamental-mode (RRab) and first-overtone (RRc) pulsators, can be especially useful when there is insufficient data for accurately calculating the average magnitudes and colors, hence distances, as well as to inform multi-band light curve classifiers, as will be required in the case of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). In this paper, we describe in detail the procedures that were adopted in producing these templates, including a novel approach to account for the presence of outliers in photometry. Our final sample comprises 136 RRab and 144 RRc templates, all of which are publicly available. Lastly, in this paper we study the inferred Fourier parameters and other light curve descriptors, including rise time,skewness, and kurtosis, as well as their correlations with the pulsation mode, period, and effective wavelength.

 - **Abstract**
 Mrk 421 was in its most active state around early 2010, which led to the highest TeV gamma-ray flux ever recorded from any active galactic nuclei. We aim to characterize the multiwavelength behavior during this exceptional year for Mrk 421, and evaluate whether it is consistent with the picture derived with data from other less exceptional years. We investigated the period from November 5, 2009, (MJD 55140) until July 3, 2010, (MJD 55380) with extensive coverage from very-high-energy (VHE; E$\,>\,$100$\,$GeV) gamma rays to radio with MAGIC, VERITAS, Fermi-LAT, RXTE, Swift, GASP-WEBT, VLBA, and a variety of additional optical and radio telescopes. We investigated the variability and correlation behavior among different energy bands in great detail. We find the strongest variability in X-rays and VHE gamma rays, and PSDs compatible with power-law functions. We observe strong correlations between X-rays and VHE gamma rays. We also report a marginally significant positive correlation between high-energy (HE; E$\,>\,$100$\,$MeV) gamma rays and the ultraviolet band. We detected marginally significant correlations between the HE and VHE gamma rays, and between HE gamma rays and the X-ray, that disappear when the large flare in February 2010 is excluded from the correlation study. The activity of Mrk 421 also yielded the first ejection of features in the VLBA images of the jet of Mrk 421. Yet the large uncertainties in the ejection times of these radio features prevent us from firmly associating them to the specific flares recorded during the campaign. We also show that the collected multi-instrument data are consistent with a scenario where the emission is dominated by two regions, a compact and extended zone, which could be considered as a simplified implementation of an energy-stratified jet as suggested by recent IXPE observations.
#### Polarization aberrations in next-generation Giant Segmented Mirror Telescopes (GSMTs). II. Influence of segment-to-segment coating variations on high-contrast imaging and polarimetry

 - **Abstract**
 Direct exo-Earth imaging is a key science goal for astronomy in the next decade. This ambitious task imposes a target contrast of ~10^-7 at wavelengths from I to J-band. In our prior study, we determined that polarization aberrations can limit the achievable contrast to 10^-5 to 10^-6 in the infrared. However, these results assumed a perfect coronagraph coupled to a telescope with an ideal coating on each of the mirrors. In this study we seek to understand the influence of polarization aberrations from segment-to-segment coating variations on coronagraphy and polarimetry. We use the Poke open-source polarization ray tracing package to compute the Jones pupil of each GSMT with spatially-varying coatings applied to the segments. The influence of the resultant polarization aberrations is simulated by propagating the Jones pupil through physical optics models of coronagraphs using HCIPy. After applying wavefront control from an ideal adaptive optics system, we determine that the segment-to-segment variations applied limit the performance of coronagraphy to a raw contrast of approximately 10^-8 in I-band, which is 2-3 orders of magnitude lower the target performance for high-contrast imaging systems on the ground. This is a negligible addition to the nominal polarization aberrations for ground-based systems. We further observe negligible degradation in polarimetric imaging of debris disks from segment-to-segment aberrations above and beyond the impact of nominal polarization aberration.

 - **Abstract**
 The ringed disk around HL Tau stands out as the iconic signature of planet formation, but the origin of the substructures is still debated. The HL Tau system also drives a powerful bipolar wind, and we analyze its outermost component traced by CO emission, to determine the relationship of the flow with the disk and its substructures. We use ALMA observations of the ${}^{12}$CO (2-1) line at 1.3 mm, with 0.2 km/s and ~ 0.28" resolution, conducted within the ALMA-DOT project. The channel maps and position-velocity diagrams show a rich structure of concatenated bubble- and arc-shaped features, whose size and distance from the source increase with velocity. The superposition of the features generates the apparent conical shape. The tomographic reconstruction of the morphology and kinematics of the red-shifted lobe suggests the presence of distinct nested shells having higher velocity and faster acceleration going toward the axis, rotating in the same sense of the disk. Such configuration can be justified by different classes of models. In this paper we compare the derived wind parameters with the predictions of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) disk winds. Under this hypothesis, the launch radii of the three outermost shells are found to be at 55, 67 and 86 au from the star, coincident with regions of enhanced gas density in the disk. The wind may be capable of removing angular momentum from the outer disk, and we derive a magnetic lever arm of $\lambda \sim 4 - 5$, higher than that commonly adopted for MHD winds from these regions. Interpretations are discussed. The arrangement of the wind in nested shells with brighter emission rooted in rings of enhanced gas density could support the results of non-ideal MHD simulations according to which magnetic instabilities can generate the disk ring-gap system with a connected layered wind, alternatively to the action of yet undetected protoplanets.

 - **Abstract**
 The mass accretion process controls pre-main-sequence evolution, although its intrinsic instability has yet to be fully understood, especially towards the protostellar stage. In this work, we have undertaken a thorough examination of the mid-infrared variability of Spitzer-selected YSOs in the Cygnus-X star-forming region over the last decade, using the NEOWISE time series. This work compares two groups of young stars: embedded Class I objects, and the more evolved flat-spectrum/Class II sources. We report on 48 candidate eruptive variables within these groups, including 14 with characteristics that resemble the photometric behaviour of FUors. We also include an additional 20 YSOs, which are of a less certain categorisation. We find the candidate FUors to be an order of magnitude more common among the younger Class I systems than more evolved objects. A large number of the identified short-duration eruptive YSOs display mid-infrared colour behaviour that is redder-when-brighter, which contrasts with optically bright outbursts seen in YSOs. Finally, we note the unusual long-term rising behaviours of four Class I YSOs, with rise timescales longer than five years, which is far slower than 6-12 month timescale for the majority of optically discovered FUors. Additionally, our broader investigation of MIR variability for embedded class I YSOs shows that there is a higher incidence of high amplitude variability for these stars, than is seen in class II sources. This holds true for all variable class I YSOs, not just the eruptive sources.

 - **Abstract**
 Studying the isotopic composition of cosmic-rays (CRs) provides crucial insights into the galactic environment and helps improve existing propagation models. Special attention is given to the secondary-to-primary ratios of light isotopic components in CRs, as these measurements can offer complementary data compared to traditional secondary-to-primary ratios like B/C. Recently, a precision measurement of the Deuterium (D) abundance in CR in the 2-21 GV rigidity range provided by the AMS02 experiment unexpectedly detected an excess of D with respect to its expected secondary nature, opening the field for new measurements at high rigidity to determine how the spectrum evolves and whether there is confirmation of a primary or primary plus secondary origin. While there are theoretical models that attempt to explain this excess, the experimental uncertainties on D production cross-sections and on CR propagation models remain significant, and only new and precise measurements can dissipate existing doubts. In this work we review the current experimental scenario and we propose a dedicated experiment able to extend the D abundance measurement up to 100 GeV/nucl without the need of a magnetic spectrometer, using a multiple scattering based technique for the measurement of particle momentum. The expected performances of the proposed detector were assessed through a dedicated simulation using the GEANT4 package, and its role in the current particle physics scenario is discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate AGN feedback from an intermediate-mass black hole at the center of a dwarf spheroidal galaxy, by performing isolated galaxy simulations using a modified version of the GADGET-3 code. We consider Leo II (PGC 34176) in the Local Group as our simulation reference model. Beginning with black hole seeds ranging from $10^3$ to $10^6$ M$_{\odot}$, our simulations focus on comparing stellar-only feedback with AGN+stellar/SN feedback over 13.7 Gyr of galactic evolution. Our results indicate that a low-mass AGN in a dwarf galaxy influences the star formation history under specific physical conditions. While AGN feedback is generally negative on star formation, instances of positive feedback were also identified. Despite measurable effects on the evolution of the dwarf host galaxy, black hole seeds exhibited only marginal growth. We tested several physical scenarios as modified models in our simulations, primarily concerning the dynamics of the central black holes, which may wander within dwarf galaxies rather than being centrally located. However, none of these adjustments significantly impacted the growth of the black hole seeds. This suggests that intermediate-mass black holes may struggle to achieve higher masses in isolated environments, with mergers and interactions likely playing crucial roles in their growth. Nevertheless, AGN feedback exhibited non-negligible effects in our simulated dwarf spheroidal galaxies, despite the assumed dominant role of stellar feedback in the low-mass regime.

 - **Abstract**
 Over the past decade, observations of evaporating exoplanets have become increasingly common, driven by the discovery of the near-infrared helium-triplet line as a powerful probe of atmospheric escape. This process significantly influences the evolution of exoplanets, particularly those smaller than Jupiter. Both theoretical and observational studies have aimed to determine how efficiently exoplanets convert their host star's X-ray and ultraviolet (XUV) radiation into atmospheric mass loss. In this study, we employ the open-source atmospheric escape model p-winds to systematically analyze all publicly available helium triplet spectroscopic detections related to exoplanetary atmospheric escape. Our findings indicate that the retrieved outflows strongly depend on the ratio of XUV flux to planetary density ($F_{\text{XUV}}/\rho_p$), supporting the theoretical framework of energy-limited mass loss. We constrain population-level photoevaporative efficiencies to $0.34 \pm 0.13$ and $0.75 \pm 0.21$ for hydrogen-helium fractions of $0.90$ and $0.99$, respectively. These results offer new insights into exoplanetary atmospheric evolution and will aid future studies on exoplanet population demographics.
