#### The Nature of Galactic Spiral Arms

 - **Abstract**
 Spiral arms are the defining features of broad morphological classes of disc galaxies, but their nature and influence on galaxy evolution is still under debate. A key diagnostic for their nature is the spiral arm pattern speed: the radial profile of the angular rotation rate of spiral features. This profile determines the location and number of dynamical resonances where peculiar motions and azimuthal metallicity fluctuations in stars and gas can manifest; their precise patterns have the potential to support or reject theories of spiral structure. However, limited observations of this type have been carried out so far, despite an increasing number of theoretical predictions emerging from realistic and detailed cosmological simulations. A systematic observational programme focussed on the resolved kinematics and metallicities of stellar populations around galaxy spiral arms is required to confront these predictions. This calls for wide-area multi-object spectrographs on 12m-class telescopes capable of accurately capturing such data across the full coverage of spiral arms in nearby galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding dense matter under extreme conditions is one of the most fundamental puzzles in modern physics. Complex interactions give rise to emergent, collective phenomena. While nuclear experiments and Earth - based colliders provide valuable insights, much of the quantum chromodynamics phase diagram at high density and low temperature remains accessible only through astrophysical observations of neutron stars, neutron star mergers, and stellar collapse. Astronomical observations thus offer a direct window to the physics on subatomic scales with gravitational waves presenting an especially clean channel. Next-generation gravitational - wave observatories, such as the Einstein Telescope, would serve as unparalleled instruments to transform our understanding of neutron star matter. They will enable the detection of up to tens of thousands of binary neutron star and neutron star - black hole mergers per year, a dramatic increase over the few events accessible with current detectors. They will provide an unprecedented precision in probing cold, dense matter during the binary inspiral, exceeding by at least an order of magnitude what current facilities can achieve. Moreover, these observatories will allow us to explore uncharted regimes of dense matter at finite temperatures produced in a subset of neutron star mergers, areas that remain entirely inaccessible to current instruments. Together with multimessenger observations, these measurements will significantly deepen our knowledge of dense nuclear matter.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultracompact Galactic binaries with orbital periods below an hour are among the strongest persistent gravitational-wave (GW) sources in the mHz band and will constitute the dominant population detected by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Tens of thousands are predicted to be individually resolved, with a substantial fraction bright enough for electromagnetic (EM) follow-up. This opens an unprecedented multi-messenger window on compact binary evolution, tidal interactions, mass transfer, and the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae. We highlight key science enabled by joint GW + EM constraints and emphasize the critical need for rapid, high-cadence spectroscopic capabilities in the 2040s. In particular, the most compact (<10 min) binaries detected by LISA will require read-noise-free, zero-dead-time spectroscopic facilities, potentially realized through coordinated arrays of telescopes with time-staggered exposures, to measure radial velocities, tidal heating signatures, and orbital evolution with the precision needed for transformative multi-messenger studies.
#### The AURORA Survey: The Mass -- Metallicity and Fundamental Metallicity Relations at $z \sim 2.3$ Based Purely on Direct $T_e$ Metallicities

 - **Abstract**
 We present new constraints on the Mass -- Metallicity (MZR) and Fundamental Metallicity Relations (FMR) using a sample of 34 galaxies at $1.38\leq~z\leq~3.5$ (median $z=2.28$). These galaxies have direct $T_e$ measurements from [O\sc{iii}]4363Å~and/or [O\sc{ii}]7320,7331Å~auroral emission lines detected with \textit{JWST}/NIRSpec as part of the AURORA survey. The detection of both oxygen auroral lines allows for dual-zone direct $T_e$ measurements and expands the dynamic range in $12+\log\mathrm{(O/H)}$ (7.68 to 8.65 dex), stellar mass ($10^{8}$ to $10^{10.4}$ M$_\odot$), and star-formation rate ($1$ to $100$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$) compared to previous direct $T_e$ studies of the high-redshift MZR and FMR. We characterize the $z\sim2$ MZR and find a slope of $0.27\pm0.04$ and normalization of $12+\log\mathrm{(O/H)} = 8.44\pm0.04$ at $10^{10}$ M$_\odot$ with an intrinsic scatter of 0.10 dex, consistent with past strong-line MZR measurements. Comparisons with $z\sim2$ predictions from six simulations reveal that none reproduce our observed MZR normalization evolution between $z\sim0$ and $z\sim2$. This discrepancy suggests current models do not fully capture the chemical enrichment and feedback processes occurring at cosmic noon. However, all 34 galaxies are on or above the star-forming main sequence such that our sample may be biased towards lower $12+\log\mathrm{(O/H)}$ if the FMR persists at $z\sim2$. Correcting for this selection effect would increase O/H by $\approx0.1$ dex at 10$^{9.3}$ M$_\odot$ (the median mass of our sample) bringing our MZR into better agreement with that of \texttt{TNG}. Lastly, we find our $z\sim2.3$ sample is consistent with the $z\sim0$ FMR within 0.1 dex in O/H, indicating that the smooth secular mechanisms regulating chemical enrichment, star formation, stellar mass, and outflows were in place at cosmic noon.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an algorithm to efficiently sample the full space of planetary interior density profiles. Our approach uses as few assumptions as possible to pursue an agnostic algorithm. The algorithm avoid the common Markov Chain Monte Carlo method for an optimisation-based gradient descent approach designed for computational efficiency. In this work, we use Uranus and Neptune as test cases and obtain empirical models that provide density and pressure profiles consistent with the observed physical properties (total mass, radius, and gravitational moments). We compare our findings to other work and find that while other studies are generally in line with our findings, they do not cover the entire space of solutions faithfully. Furthermore, we present guidance for modellers that construct Uranus or Neptune interior models with a fixed number of layers. We provide a statistical relation between the steepness classifying a density discontinuity and the resulting number of discontinuities to be expected. For example, if one classifies a discontinuity as a density gradient larger than 0.02 kg m$^{-4}$, then most solutions should have at most one such discontinuity. Finally, we find that discontinuities, if present, are concentrated around a planetary normalised radius of 0.65 for Uranus and 0.7 for Neptune. Our algorithm to efficiently and faithfully investigate the full space of possible interior density profiles can be used to study all planetary objects with gravitational field data.

 - **Abstract**
 The cosmic Middle Ages, spanning the last 8-10 Gyr of the Universe, is a critical period in which massive early-formed systems coexist with global star formation quenching in less massive galaxies, yet galaxies experience further dynamical, morphological and chemical evolution. Understanding the relative role of internal drivers and of interaction with the evolving large-scale structures remains a highly complex and unsettled issue. To make transformative progress on these questions we must characterize the physical and kinematic properties (integrated and spatially resolved) of stellar populations in galaxies, fossil record of their past star formation and assembly histories, together with gas properties, across a wide range of masses and environmental scales, over this critical cosmic epoch. Volume-representative samples of 10^6 galaxies down to 10^9 solar masses are essential to fully trace the complex interplay between physical processes and to physically connect progenitor and descendant galaxy populations. This demands a deep and extensive survey with high signal-to-noise, medium-resolution, rest-frame optical spectroscopy. Current and planned facilities in the 2020-2030s cannot simultaneously achieve the required sample size, spectral quality, mass limit, and spatial coverage. A dedicated large-aperture spectroscopic facility with wide-area high-multiplex MOS and large field-of-view IFU is needed to provide transformative insights into the physical mechanisms regulating star formation and galaxy evolution.
#### The contribution from smalls scales on two-point shear analysis: comparison between power spectrum and correlation function

 - **Abstract**
 A known problem in cosmic shear two-point statistics is the apparent inconsistency between analyses performed in harmonic space (power spectrum) and real space (angular correlation). This arises mainly from two factors: first, scale cuts in one space correspond to soft cuts in the other, as the relationship between the two spaces is mediated by Bessel functions. For the same reason, astrophysical effects that are compact in one space may not be in the other, which can lead to biased parameter estimates. In this paper, we argue that these two statistics are complementary: we expect a robust theory to provide consistent constraints regardless of the chosen scale cuts. We present the consequences of pushing our analysis to smaller scales in both spaces, accounting for different models of Intrinsic Alignment and Baryonic Feedback in HSC Y3 data: we find that the harmonic-space analysis is significantly less sensitive to the specific modeling of small-scale physics, with model-choice-driven biases in $S_8$ being 2-3 times smaller than in real space. We show that using a flexible, simulation-based emulator for baryonic feedback (BACCO) in combination with the TATT model for intrinsic alignments provides the most consistent cosmological constraints between the two spaces when pushing to the smallest scales. In contrast, the standard HMCode-2016 model results in a $\sim 1.1\sigma$ tension between the two statistics. While harmonic space appears more robust for cosmological inference given current model uncertainties, real-space analyses offer a clearer separation of baryonic effects and will play a crucial role in distinguishing between baryonic feedback models in upcoming surveys.
#### Quantifying Systematic Age Discrepancies in Very Young Star Clusters

 - **Abstract**
 We infer the ages of three young stellar clusters, NGC 2004, NGC 7419, and NGC 2100, using Stellar Ages, a statistical algorithm designed to infer stellar population properties from color magnitude diagrams. Recent studies have revealed emerging inconsistencies in the inferred ages of very young stellar clusters with ages less than or equal to 50 Myr. Here, we identify and quantify two distinct discrepancies. First, we identify a systematic age offset of 0.55 plus minus 0.09 dex between red supergiant and bright blue star age estimates, equivalent to a factor of approximately 3.5 in linear age, with bright blue star ages appearing systematically younger than those inferred from red supergiants. Second, given the observed numbers of red supergiants and bright blue stars, we find a pronounced deficit of lower-mass main-sequence stars relative to expectations from a standard initial mass function. Although these discrepancies resemble those reported for intermediate-age clusters, their magnitude and character suggest that they are unique to the evolution of massive stars. Together, these results highlight population-level inconsistencies with single-star evolutionary models and underscore the need to consider multiple evolutionary tracers when age-dating young clusters. By combining individual stellar ages with population-wide constraints, our approach refines prior work on cluster age determinations and provides new insight into massive star evolution and the interpretation of cluster demographics.
#### SHARP: Beyond JWST -- Revealing the galaxy birth and growth with the resolution of the ELT

 - **Abstract**
 A deep understanding of the life-cycle of galaxies, particularly those of high mass, requires clarifying the mechanisms that regulate star formation (SF) and its abrupt shutdown (quenching), often capable of stopping SF rates of hundreds of solar masses per year. What initially triggers quenching, and what sustains the quiescent state thereafter, especially given the frequent presence of large gas reservoirs or even massive gas inflows, are unsolved key issues. Ultimately, the crucial connection between the galaxy life-cycle and the surrounding Intergalactic (IGM) and Circumgalactic (CGM) Medium remains largely unclear. Addressing these issues requires studying star formation, chemical enrichment, and quenching homogeneously up to high redshift. The upcoming AO-assisted Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), will deliver sharper and deeper data than the JWST. SHARP is a concept study for a near-IR (0.95-2.45 mu) spectrograph designed to fully exploit the capabilities of ELT. Designed for multi-object slit spectroscopy and multi-Integral Field spectroscopy, SHARP points to achieve angular resolutions (~30 mas) far superior to NIRSpec at JWST(100 mas) to decipher and reconstruct the life-cycle oa galaxies.
#### The mass distribution of clumpy accretion onto the nearby young star TW Hya

 - **Abstract**
 The proliferation of high time-resolution and decades-long monitoring of classical T Tauri stars provides a vast opportunity to test the variability of the star-disk connections. However, most monitoring surveys use single broad-band filters, which makes the conversion of photometric variability into accretion rate difficult. In this study, we analyze accretion bursts onto the nearby young star TW Hya over short (hours, days) and long (months, years) timescales by calibrating TESS and ASAS-SN $g$-band photometry to accretion rates with simultaneous spectroscopy. The high cadence TESS light curve shows bursts of accretion in clumps with masses from a sensitivity limit of $\sim10^{-13}$~M$_\odot$ up to $3\times 10^{-11}$\,M$_\odot$. The average burst duration of 1.8 days is longer than a simple estimate of the thermal response timescale, supporting the interpretation that the photometric variability probes the instantaneous accretion rate. The reset timescale of 1.2--2 days derived from the structure function and previously reported quasi-periods of 3.5--4 days are consistent with bursts that may be related to the different rotation between the stellar magnetosphere and inner disk or with azimuthal asymmetries in the inner disk. The near-daily ASAS-SN light curve across 8 years reveals some seasonal changes in brightness with a standard deviation of $\sim 0.13$ mag, about half of the scatter seen on short timescales. This study demonstrates the importance of coordinating contemporaneous multi-epoch spectroscopy with time domain surveys to interpret light curves of young stars.
#### Pulsed radio emission from a Central Compact Object

 - **Abstract**
 The high magnetic fields and rapid spins of young pulsars associated with supernova remnants, such as the Crab and the Vela, established the standard pulsar model in which massive stellar explosions produce rapidly rotating, radio-luminous neutron stars. Central Compact Objects (CCOs), identified in X-rays at the centers of other remnants, challenged this view, as decades of searches yielded no radio detections. Here we show that the prototypical young CCO 1E 1207.4-5209 is in fact a faint radio pulsar rotating at the 0.4s X-ray period. Analysis of its polarization indicates that the radio beam intersects our line of sight near the magnetic pole, affirming its radio faintness' being intrinsic. Once its supernova remnant dissipates, this source would be misidentified as an apparently gigayear-old pulsar. The CCO's low radio flux density may explain why many supernova remnants lack detectable radio pulsars and suggests a hidden population of young, slowly rotating neutron stars.
#### Uncovering the population of compact binary mergers and their formation pathways with gravitational waves through the Einstein Telescope

 - **Abstract**
 Ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) observatories have transformed our view of compact-object mergers, yet their reach still limits a comprehensive reconstruction of the processes that generate these systems. Only next-generation observatories, with order-of-magnitude improvements in sensitivity and access to lower frequencies, will be capable of radically extending this detection horizon. GW observations will make it possible to detect the complete population of binary black hole (BBH) mergers out to redshifts of $z \simeq 100$. This capability will deliver an unprecedented map of merger events across cosmic time and enable precise reconstruction of their mass and spin distributions, while for several thousand events the signal-to-noise ratio will surpass 100, enabling precision physics of BHs and neutron stars (NSs). The access to lower frequencies will also open the intermediate-mass window, detecting systems of order $\sim 10^3 M_\odot$, potentially in coordination with multi-band observations from LISA. At higher redshifts, where Population III stars have so far remained beyond reach - even for the James Webb Space Telescope - GW observations by next-generation detectors will routinely provide observations of BH mergers thought to originate from these primordial stellar populations. Such measurements are expected to play a central role in clarifying the early assembly of supermassive black holes. A single detection of a binary BH system at $z \gtrsim 30$, or of a compact object with sub-solar mass and no tidal deformability, would constitute strong evidence for the existence of primordial black holes. Such a discovery would have profound consequences for our understanding of dark matter and the early Universe. Ultimately, the GW observations will become revolutionary for identifying the physical channels responsible for compact binary formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar polar fields are essential for the solar cycle and the heliospheric magnetic field. Cycle 25 is now entering its declining phase, the critical period during which most of the cycle's polar fields are established. Therefore, reliable polar-field prediction is now especially important. Polar-field evolution is governed by the poleward transport of already-emerged active-region (AR) flux over a timescale of a few years. Thus, surface flux-transport models can reliably provide one-year predictions without requiring information about future AR emergence. Our prediction method is validated using simulations of the surface magnetic field from 2020-2025 and hindcasts of the 2023-2024 polar fields, employing a newly constrained profile of the meridional flow. Using the most recent HMI synoptic magnetogram as the initial condition, we predict the polar-field evolution from October 2025 to October 2026. The southern polar field is predicted to strengthen gradually, while the northern field is expected to decline sharply until March 2026 due to some ARs with abnormal polarity. By that time, the northern polar field becomes exceptionally weak, and the southern field remains relatively weak, raising concerns about the polar-field strength at the cycle 25/26 minimum and the amplitude of cycle 26.

 - **Abstract**
 Sunspot groups often emerge in spatial-temporal clusters, known as nests or complexes of activity. Quantifying how frequently such nesting occurs is important for understanding the organisation and recurrence of solar magnetic fields. We introduce an automated approach to identify nests in the longitude-time domain and to measure the fraction of sunspot groups that belong to them. The method combines a smooth representation of emergence patterns with a density-based clustering procedure, validated using synthetic solar-like cycles and corrected for variations in data density. We apply this method to 151 years of sunspot-group observations from the Royal Greenwich Observatory Photoheliographic Results (RGO, 1874-1976) and Kislovodsk Mountain Astronomical Station (KMAS, 1955-2025) catalogues. Across all cycles and latitude bands, the mean nesting degree is $\langle D\rangle = 0.61 \pm 0.12$, implying that about 60 percent all sunspot groups emerge within nests. Nesting is strongest at mid-latitudes (10$^\circ$-20$^\circ$), and results from the two independent datasets agree in the period of overlap. The identified nests range from compact clusters to long-lived, drifting structures, offering new quantitative constraints on the persistence and organisation of solar magnetic activity.

 - **Abstract**
 The evolution of galaxies in groups is profoundly influenced by a variety of physical processes, with ram pressure and tidal interactions playing pivotal roles in shaping their structural and evolutionary pathways. The relative influence of these two processes is still debated in groups compared to clusters, as ram pressure is less understood there. We study NGC 2276, a nearby galaxy (z$\sim$0.0079) where the dominant process is still an open question. We examine the distribution of stellar populations in NGC 2276 using multiwavelength data to assess potential evidence of tidal interactions and ram-pressure stripping. We present the first HST WFC3/UVIS images of NGC 2276, and use them to investigate the distribution of stellar populations across the disk of NGC 2276, where we assume that the bluer broadband filters mainly trace younger stellar populations, while the redder filters trace mainly older stellar populations. Furthermore, by comparing HST images with maps of H$\alpha$ emission from Calar Alto's PMAS/PPAK integral field unit (IFU) and near-IR maps from Spitzer's IRAC, we identify arm-like overdensity features that trace the spiral structure of this galaxy and tracked the variation of their pitch angle with radius. Our results indicate that the distribution of the stellar populations is asymmetrical. The youngest stellar populations (up to $\sim$100 Myr) show higher concentration on the leading side of the galaxy and are more diffuse on the trailing side, consistent with gas compression due to ram-pressure. This asymmetry is visible in the red filters as well. We also show that the average pitch angles of the overdensity features increase with galactocentric distance. Our findings are consistent with the fact that ram pressure is the leading mechanism for the peculiar morphology of NGC 2276, but do not exclude the possibility that tidal interactions could have played a role.

 - **Abstract**
 The advent of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) and recent advances in reconstruction of gamma-ray photons with Cherenkov telescopes are bound to push the limit of angular resolution to an unprecedented precision of less than one arcminute at tens of TeV. Naturally, such instrumental improvements open up possibilities for new and interesting scientific studies. We aim to show that the study of pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) in particular is bound to profit from these high-resolution measurements. This is because PWNe are the dominant Galactic source population at TeV energies, exhibit hard spectra up to hundreds of TeV and from X-ray observations are known to possess plentiful structure on arcminute scales. Using HESS J1813-178 and MSH 15-52 as examples, we create simple leptonic models of the TeV morphology of these sources based on X-ray observations and existing gamma-ray measurements. Then, assuming different models for the exposure and point spread function of the observatory, we create mock observations with the future CTAO southern array. We use these to assess the ability of these observations to differentiate between models and study the physics of these sources, in particular to infer the structure of the magnetic field and electron distributions. We find that future observations with the CTAO southern array at multi-TeV energies - in combination with existing X-ray measurements - will likely be able to constrain the distributions of magnetic field and high-energy electrons in these sources. We demonstrate that the sensitivity of these measurements can be significantly enhanced with the improved angular resolution achievable with novel reconstruction algorithms. However, we also show that in the relevant multi-TeV regime, signal-photon statistics remain a limitation and trading event statistics for improved angular resolution is not necessarily advantageous.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive kinematic and ionization analysis of the warm ionized filaments ($10^4$ K) in M87, the central galaxy of the Virgo cluster, using new integral field spectroscopy from MEGARA (GTC) and SITELLE (CFHT). MEGARA targets the southeastern (SE) filaments (3 kpc from the nucleus), coincident with the only known molecular gas clump, and the far eastern (FE) filament (15 kpc), spatially isolated within an old radio lobe. SITELLE fully maps the filaments, offering the first complete views of their kinematics and excitation. Combined with archival ALMA, MUSE and Chandra data, these observations offer a multi-phase view of gas dynamics. The filaments display complex motions inconsistent with simple rotation. Velocity structure functions (VSFs) of the warm and cold gas in the central and SE filaments show consistent steep slopes (2/3) and flattening on small scales of a few hundred parsecs, possibly suggesting energy injection from Type Ia supernovae, though interpretation is method-limited. The FE filament shows a lower VSF amplitude, suggesting less active driving. ALMA CO emission is co-spatial and kinematically aligned with the ionized gas, the latter showing broader velocity dispersions. Ionization diagnostics indicate AGN-related processes (e.g., shocks) dominate, with higher-energy excitation near the radio lobes and lower-energy fossil feedback signatures in the FE filament. Finally, the filaments follow the same strong H$\alpha$-X-ray surface brightness correlation seen in other clusters, supporting local thermal coupling between phases. However, the FE filament deviates from this trend, possibly due to uplift from past AGN outbursts or limitations in the analysis method.

 - **Abstract**
 Characterizing the interior structure of exoplanets is an inverse problem often solved using Bayesian inference, but this approach is hampered by the high computational cost of planetary structure models. To overcome this barrier, we present a robust framework that accelerates inference by replacing the computationally expensive physics-based forward model with a fast polynomial chaos-Kriging (PCK) surrogate directly within a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling loop. We rigorously validate our approach using a suite of tests, including a direct comparison against a benchmark MCMC inference using the full forward model, and a large-scale coverage study with 1000 synthetic test cases to demonstrate the statistical reliability of our inferred credible intervals. Our surrogate-assisted framework achieves a computational speedup of over 2 orders of magnitude (factor of $\sim$320), reducing single-CPU inference times from days to minutes. This efficiency is achieved with a surrogate that requires only a few hundred forward model evaluations for training \rev{for a single planet}. This data efficiency provides significant flexibility for model developments and a clear advantage over common machine learning approaches, which typically demand vast training sets ($>10^6$ model runs) and intensive pre-computation. The PCK surrogate maintains high fidelity with $R^2 > 0.99$ for most scenarios, and root-mean-square errors typically an order of magnitude smaller than observational uncertainties. This efficiency enables large scale population studies while preserving statistical robustness, which is computationally impractical with traditional methods.
#### Across the Universe: GW231123 as a magnified and diffracted black hole merger

 - **Abstract**
 GW231123 appears as the most massive binary black hole (BBH) ever observed by the LIGO interferometers with total mass $190-265 M_\odot$. A high observed mass can be explained by the combination of cosmological redshift and gravitational magnification if the source is aligned with a gravitational lens, such as a galaxy. Small-scale objects such as stars and remnants diffract the signal, distorting the wavefront and providing additional lensing signatures. Here we present an analysis of GW231123 combining for the first time the effects of diffraction by a small-scale lens and gravitational magnification by an external potential, modelled as an embedded point-mass lens (PL), finding an intriguing case for the lensing hypothesis. Lensing is favoured by the data, with a false alarm probability of the observed Bayes factors bounded below $<1\%$, or $\sim 2.6 \sigma$ confidence level. Including lensing lowers the total source mass of GW231123 to $100-180 M_\odot$, closer to BBHs reported so far, and also removes discrepancies between different waveform approximants and the need for high component spins. We reconstruct all source and lens properties, including the microlens mass $190-850 M_\odot$, its offset, the magnitude of the external gravitational potential and its orientation. The embedded PL analysis leads to a lighter microlens compared to the isolated PL. Within our assumptions, the reconstruction is complete up to an ambiguity between the distance and projected density (mass-sheet degeneracy). Assuming a single galaxy as the macroscopic lens allows us to infer the total amplification of the signal, placing the event at redshift $0.7-2$, and predict the probability $~55\%$ of forming an additional detectable image due to strong lensing by the macrolens. We discuss the implications of our findings on the source and nature of the microlens, including a possible dark matter origin.
#### A VLA search for compact radio sources in the explosive molecular outflows DR 21 and G5.89

 - **Abstract**
 We present high-angular-resolution ($\sim0\rlap{.}''1$) VLA Ku-band (12--18 GHz) observations of two explosive molecular outflows (EMOs), DR 21 and G5.89, in a search for runaway stars related to these explosive events. In DR 21, we identified 13 compact radio sources (CRS), 9 located in the DR 21 core and near the CO streamer ejection region. The radio properties of the CRSs show that three are nonthermal radio emitters, likely magnetically active stars, while the nature of the remaining CRSs cannot be conclusively identified. All detected CRSs are good candidates for follow-up proper motion studies to confirm whether they are runaway stars. We also identify multiple ionized arc-shaped structures that can be fitted with parabolas whose symmetry axes converge to a position coincident with CRSs #11, raising the possibility that this source is the main ionizing star. A re-analysis of the 18 molecular outflow streamers refines the center of the explosive event, which aligns closely with the position indicated by the arcs convergence point, supporting a common stellar origin for the EMOs and the HII-region. In G5.89, the observations reveal a shell with a square-like morphology. The strong extended emission from this HII region prevents the detection of weak compact radio sources inside the shell; only two were identified well beyond the shell, and a single parabolic arc was fitted within this region. Overall, arc structures in ionized regions seem to be good tracers of the origin of the ionizing sources.

 - **Abstract**
 The exteriors of stellar and galactic dynamos are usually modeled as a current-free potential field. A more realistic description might be that of a force-free magnetic field. Here, we suggest that, in the absence of outflows, neither of those reflect the actual behavior when the magnetic field spreads diffusively into a more poorly conducting turbulent exterior outside dynamo. In particular, we show that the usual ordering of the dipole magnetic field being the most slowly decaying one is altered, and that the quadrupole can develop a toroidal component that decays even more slowly with radial distance. This behavior is best seen for spherical dynamo volumes and becomes more complicated for oblate ones. In either case, however, those fields are confined within a magnetosphere beyond which the field drops exponentially. The magnetosphere expands ballistically (i.e., linearly in time $t$) during the exponential growth phase of the dynamo, but diffusively proportional to $t^{1/2}$ during the saturated phase. We demonstrate that the Faraday displacement current, which plays a role in a vacuum, can safely be neglected in all cases. For quadrupolar configurations, the synchrotron emission from the magnetosphere is found to be constant along concentric rings. The total and the polarized radio emissions from the dipolar or the quadrupolar configurations display large scale radial trends that are potentially distinguishable with existing radio telescopes. The superposition of magnetic fields from galaxies in the outskirts of the voids between galaxy clusters can therefore not explain the void magnetization of the intergalactic medium, reinforcing the conventional expectation that those fields are of primordial origin.
#### Investigating the AGN variability timescale -- black hole mass relationship with Gaia, SDSS and ZTF

 - **Abstract**
 Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) exhibit variability in their luminosities with timescales that correlate with the mass of the black hole at the centre of the AGN. Presently, the empirical correlation lacks sufficient precision to confidently convert these timescales into black hole masses, especially at the low-mass end. To find more AGNs with timescale measurements, we study a very large catalog of AGNs from the Gaia Data Release 3 called GLEAN (Gaia variabLE AgN; 872228 objects). We identify GLEAN objects with optical spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR17 and light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) DR21. After fitting the light curves with a damped random walk model, we find that the GLEAN light curves have insufficient sampling to extract reliable amplitude and timescale measurements outside the range of 50-100 days. On the other hand, well-sampled ZTF light curves allow more accurate estimations of these parameters. The fractional variability amplitude is an effective, model-independent metric for measuring variability amplitude, but only when derived from high-quality light curves. We provide a catalog of 127 GLEAN AGNs with spectroscopic virial black hole masses, and variability amplitudes and timescales. Though we do not find any low-mass black holes in this AGN sample, we confirm a relationship between the damped random walk timescale and the black hole mass that is consistent with previous studies.

 - **Abstract**
 A large part of the hot corona consists of magnetically confined, bright plasma loops. These observed loops are in turn structured into bright strands. We investigate the relationship between magnetic field geometry, plasma properties and bright strands with the help of a 3D resistive MHD simulation of a coronal loop rooted in a self-consistent convection zone layer. We find that it is impossible to identify a loop as a simple coherent magnetic flux tube that coincides with plasma of nearly uniform temperature and density. The location of bright structures is determined by a complex interplay between heating, cooling and evaporation timescales. Current sheets form preferentially at the interfaces of magnetic flux from different sources. They may also form within bundles of magnetic field lines since motions within magnetic concentrations drive plasma flows on a range of timescales that provide further substructure and can locally enhance magnetic field gradients and thus facilitate magnetic reconnection. The numerical experiment therefore possesses aspects of both the flux tube tectonics and flux braiding models. While modelling an observed coronal loop as a cylindrical flux tube is useful to understand the physics of specific heating mechanisms in isolation, it does not describe well the structure of a coronal loop rooted in a self-consistently evolving convection zone.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic fields are critical at many scales to galactic dynamics and structure, including multiphase pressure balance, dust processing, and star formation. Dynamo action determines their dynamical structure and strength. Simulations of combined large- and small-scale dynamos have successfully developed mean fields with strength and topology consistent with observations but with turbulent fields much weaker than observed, while simulations of small-scale dynamos with parameters relevant to the interstellar medium yield turbulent fields an order of magnitude below the values observed or expected theoretically. We use the Pencil Code accelerated on GPUs with Astaroth to perform high-resolution simulations of a supernova-driven galactic dynamo including heating and cooling in a periodic domain. Our models show that the strength of the turbulent field produced by the small-scale dynamo approaches an asymptote at only modest magnetic Prandtl numbers. This allows us to use these models to suggest the essential characteristics of this constituent of the magnetic field for inclusion in global galactic models. The asymptotic limit occurs already at magnetic Prandtl number of only a few hundred, many orders of magnitude below physical values in the the interstellar medium and consistent with previous findings for isothermal compressible flows.
