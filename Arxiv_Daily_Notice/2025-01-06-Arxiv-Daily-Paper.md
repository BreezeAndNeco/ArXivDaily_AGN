 - **Abstract**
 Data sizes for next generation radio telescopes, such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), are far above that of their predecessors. The CLEAN algorithm was originally developed by Högbom [1974], long before such data sizes were thought possible and is still the most popular tool used for deconvolution in interferometric imaging. In order to facilitate these new large data sizes and reduce computation time a distributed approach to the algorithm has been investigated. The serial nature of the CLEAN algorithm, due to its matching pursuit design, makes this challenging. Splitting the image into a number of tiles which can be individually deconvolved has been investigated, but this creates discontinuities in the deconvolved image and makes it difficult to deconvolve faint sources in the presence of a point spread function associated with bright sources in other tiles. A method of feedback between each of the tiles has been developed to deal with these problems. This new approach has been tested on a simulated dataset containing multiple point sources of known intensity. When compared to a standard Högbom deconvolution the tiled feedback version produced a reconstructed image, containing sources up to 2.1 Jy, which agreed to between -0.1 Jy and +0.04 Jy of the standard method across the whole deconvolved image at a speed up to 10.66 times faster.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed study of SN 2024ahr, a hydrogen-poor superluminous supernova (SLSN-I), for which we determine a redshift of $z=0.0861$. SN 2024ahr has a peak absolute magnitude of $M_g\approx M_r\approx -21$ mag, rest-frame rise and decline times (50$\%$ of peak) of about 40 and 80 days, respectively, and typical spectroscopic evolution in the optical band. Similarly, modeling of the UV/optical light curves with a magnetar spin-down engine leads to typical parameters: an initial spin period of $\approx 3.3$ ms, a magnetic field strength of $\approx 6\times 10^{13}$ G, and an ejecta mass of $\approx 9.5$ M$_\odot$. Due to its relatively low redshift we obtained a high signal-to-noise ratio near-IR spectrum about 43 rest-frame days post-peak to search for the presence of helium. We do not detect any significant feature at the location of the He I $\,\lambda 2.058$ $\mu$m feature, and place a conservative upper limit of $\sim 0.05$ M$_\odot$ on the mass of helium in the outer ejecta. We detect broad features of Mg I $\,\lambda 1.575$ $\mu$m and a blend of Co II $\,\lambda 2.126$ $\mu$m and Mg II, $\lambda 2.136$ $\mu$m, which are typical of Type Ic SNe, but with higher velocities. Examining the sample of SLSNe-I with NIR spectroscopy, we find that, unlike SN 2024ahr, these events are generally peculiar. This highlights the need for a large sample of prototypical SLSNe-I with NIR spectroscopy to constrain the fraction of progenitors with helium (Ib-like) and without helium (Ic-like) at the time of the explosion, and hence the evolutionary path(s) leading to the rare outcome of SLSNe-I.

 - **Abstract**
 White dwarfs (WDs) are the most abundant compact objects, and recent surveys have suggested that over a third of WDs in accreting binaries host a strong (B $\gtrsim$ 1 MG) magnetic field. However, the origin and evolution of WD magnetism remain under debate. Two WD pulsars, AR Sco and J191213.72-441045.1 (J1912), have been found, which are non-accreting binaries hosting rapidly spinning (1.97-min and 5.30-min, respectively) magnetic WDs. The WD in AR Sco is slowing down on a $P/\dot{P}\approx 5.6\times 10^6$ yr timescale. It is believed they will eventually become polars, accreting systems in which a magnetic WD (B $\approx 10-240$ MG) accretes from a Roche lobe-filling donor spinning in sync with the orbit ($\gtrsim 78$ min). Here, we present multiwavelength data and analysis of Gaia22ayj, which outbursted in March 2022. We find that Gaia22ayj is a magnetic accreting WD that is rapidly spinning down ($P/\dot{P} = 6.1^{+0.3}_{-0.2}\times 10^6$ yr) like WD pulsars, but shows clear evidence of accretion, like polars. Strong linear polarization (40%) is detected in Gaia22ayj; such high levels have only been seen in the WD pulsar AR Sco and demonstrate the WD is magnetic. High speed photometry reveals a 9.36-min period accompanying a high amplitude ($\sim 2$ mag) modulation. We associate this with a WD spin or spin-orbit beat period, not an orbital period as was previously suggested. Fast (60-s) optical spectroscopy reveals a broad ``hump'', reminiscent of cyclotron emission in polars, between 4000-8000 Angstrom. We find an X-ray luminosity of $L_X = 2.7_{-0.8}^{+6.2}\times10^{32} \textrm{ erg s}^{-1}$ in the 0.3-8 keV energy range, while two VLA radio campaigns resulted in a non-detection with a $F_r < 15.8\mu\textrm{Jy}$ 3$ \sigma$ upper limit. The shared properties of both WD pulsars and polars suggest that Gaia22ayj is a missing link between the two classes of magnetic WD binaries.

 - **Abstract**
 We present ORACLE, the first hierarchical deep-learning model for real-time, context-aware classification of transient and variable astrophysical phenomena. ORACLE is a recurrent neural network with Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), and has been trained using a custom hierarchical cross-entropy loss function to provide high-confidence classifications along an observationally-driven taxonomy with as little as a single photometric observation. Contextual information for each object, including host galaxy photometric redshift, offset, ellipticity and brightness, is concatenated to the light curve embedding and used to make a final prediction. Training on $\sim$0.5M events from the Extended LSST Astronomical Time-Series Classification Challenge, we achieve a top-level (Transient vs Variable) macro-averaged precision of 0.96 using only 1 day of photometric observations after the first detection in addition to contextual information, for each event; this increases to $>$0.99 once 64 days of the light curve has been obtained, and 0.83 at 1024 days after first detection for 19-way classification (including supernova sub-types, active galactic nuclei, variable stars, microlensing events, and kilonovae). We also compare ORACLE with other state-of-the-art classifiers and report comparable performance for the 19-way classification task, in addition to delivering accurate top-level classifications much earlier. The code and model weights used in this work are publicly available at our associated GitHub repository (this https URL).

 - **Abstract**
 The isotropic stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) generated by a population of supermassive black hole binaries (BHBs) provides a unique window into their cosmic evolution. In addition to the isotropic power spectrum, the anisotropic component of the signal carries additional information about the supermassive black holes (BHs) and host galaxy connection. The measurement of this signal is usually carried out by angular power spectra, which is only a sufficient measure for a Gaussian and statistically isotropic distribution. In contrast, the contribution from supermassive BHBs in nano-hertz SGWB will be hosted by fewer massive galaxies, making the nano-hertz background anisotropic and non-Gaussian. As a result, the performance of angular power spectra in extracting the underlying physics is limited. In this work, we propose a novel technique called the Multi-Tracer Correlated Stacking, which enables the detection of anisotropies in the SGWB by stacking the signal from regions of the sky with tracers of BHs such as active galactic nucleus (AGNs), quasars, bright galaxies, etc., that can be mapped up to high redshift. We demonstrate this technique on a simulated supermassive BHBs distribution using an AGN catalog, which maps the underlying matter distribution approximately up to redshift $z=5$. This stacking technique uniquely distinguishes between isotropic and anisotropic distributions of SGWB source, surpassing the capabilities of angular power spectrum-based methods in detecting anisotropic signals. This highlights the effectiveness of this technique in detecting anisotropic SGWB signals and in the future, this technique can play a crucial role in its discovery.

 - **Abstract**
 Binospec is a wide-field optical (360 to 1000 nm) spectrograph commissioned at the MMT 6.5m telescope in 2017. In direct imaging mode Binospec addresses twin 8$^\prime$ (wide) by 15$^\prime$ (slit length) fields of view. We describe an optical fiber based integral field unit (IFU) that remaps a 12$^{\prime\prime}$ x 16$^{\prime\prime}$ contiguous region onto two pseudo slits, one in each Binospec channel. The IFU, commissioned in 2023, fits into the space of a standard slit mask frame and can be deployed as desired in a mixed program of slit masks, long slits, and IFU observations. The IFU fibers are illuminated by a hexagonal lenslet array with a 0.6$^{\prime\prime}$ pitch. A separate bundle of sky fibers consists of close-packed bare fibers arranged within an 11.8$^{\prime\prime}$ circular aperture. The 640 IFU fibers and 80 sky fibers have a core diameter of 150$\mu$m, corresponding to 0.90$^{\prime\prime}$. Three gratings are available, 270lpm with R$\sim$2000, 600lpm with R$\sim$5300, and 1000 lpm with R$\sim$6000.

 - **Abstract**
 For the 696 trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) with absolute magnitudes $5.5 < H_r < 8.2$ detected in the Dark Energy Survey (DES), we characterize the relationships between their dynamical state and physical properties -- namely $H_r$, indicating size; colors, indicating surface composition; and flux variation semi-amplitude $A$, indicating asphericity and surface inhomogeneity. We seek ``birth'' physical distributions that can recreate these parameters in every dynamical class. We show that the observed colors of these TNOs are consistent with 2 Gaussian distributions in $griz$ space, ``near-IR bright'' (NIRB) and ``near-IR faint'' (NIRF), presumably an inner and outer birth population, respectively. We find a model in which both the NIRB and NIRF $H_r$ and $A$ distributions are independent of current dynamical states, supporting their assignment as birth populations. All objects are consistent with a common rolling $p(H_r)$, but NIRF objects are significantly more variable. Cold classicals (CCs) are purely NIRF, while hot classical (HC), scattered, and detached TNOs are consistent with $\approx70\%$ NIRB, and resonances' NIRB fractions show significant variation. The NIRB component of the HCs and of some resonances have broader inclination distributions than the NIRFs, i.e. their current dynamics retains information about birth location. We find evidence for radial stratification within the birth NIRB population, in that HC NIRBs are on average redder than detached or scattered NIRBs; a similar effect distinguishes CCs from other NIRFs. We estimate total object counts and masses of each class within our $H_r$ range. These results will strongly constrain models of the outer solar system.

 - **Abstract**
 To date, only two strongly lensed type Ia supernovae (SNIa) have been discovered with an isolated galaxy acting as the lens: iPTF16geu and SN Zwicky. The observed image fluxes for both lens systems were inconsistent with predictions from a smooth macro lens model. A potential explanation for the anomalous flux ratios is microlensing: additional (de)magnification caused by stars and other compact objects in the lens galaxy. In this work, we combine observations of iPTF16geu and SN Zwicky with simulated microlensing magnification maps, leveraging their standardizable candle properties to constrain the lens galaxy mass slope, $\eta$, and the fraction of dark compact objects, $f_{\rm dc}$. The resulting mass slopes are $\eta = 1.70 \pm 0.07$ for iPTF16geu and $\eta = 1.81 \pm 0.10$ for SN Zwicky. Our results indicate no evidence for a population of dark compact objects, placing upper limits at the $95\%$ confidence level of $f_{\rm dc} < 0.25$ for iPTF16geu and $f_{\rm dc} < 0.47$ for SN Zwicky. Assuming a constant fraction of dark compact objects for both lensed SNe, we obtain $f_{\rm dc} < 0.19$. These results highlight the potential of strongly lensed SNIa to probe the innermost parts of lens galaxies and learn about compact matter.

 - **Abstract**
 The cold and hot interstellar medium (ISM) in star forming galaxies resembles the reservoir for star formation and associated heating by stellar winds and explosions during stellar evolution, respectively. We utilize data from deep $Chandra$ observations and archival millimeter surveys to study the interconnection between these two phases and the relation to star formation activities in M51 on kiloparsec scales. A sharp radial decrease is present in the hot gas surface brightness profile within the inner 2 kpc of M51. The ratio between the total infrared luminosity ($L_{\rm IR}$) and the hot gas luminosity ($L_{\rm 0.5 - 2\,keV}^{\rm gas}$) shows a positive correlation with the galactic radius in the central region. For the entire galaxy, a twofold correlation is revealed in the $L_{\rm 0.5 - 2\,keV}^{\rm gas}$${-}$$L_{\rm IR}$ diagram, where $L_{\rm 0.5 - 2\,keV}^{\rm gas}$ sharply increases with $L_{\rm IR}$ in the center but varies more slowly in the disk. The best fit gives a steep relation of ${\rm log}(L_{\rm 0.5-2\,keV}^{\rm gas} /{\rm erg\,s^{-1}})=1.82\,{\rm log}(L_{\rm IR} /{L_{\rm \odot}})+22.26$ for the center of M51. The similar twofold correlations are also found in the $L_{\rm 0.5 - 2\,keV}^{\rm gas}$${-}$molecular line luminosity ($L^\prime_{\rm gas}$) relations for the four molecular emission lines CO(1-0), CO(2-1), HCN(1-0), and HCO$^+$(1-0). We demonstrate that the core-collapse supernovae (SNe) are the primary source of energy for heating gas in the galactic center of M51, leading to the observed steep $L_{\rm 0.5 - 2\,keV}^{\rm gas}$${-}$$L_{\rm IR}$ and $L_{\rm 0.5 - 2\,keV}^{\rm gas}$${-}$$L^\prime_{\rm gas}$ relations, as their X-ray radiation efficiencies ($\eta$ $\equiv$ $L_{\rm 0.5 - 2\,keV}^{\rm gas}$/$\dot{E}_\mathrm{SN}$) increase with the star formation rate surface densities, where $\dot{E}_\mathrm{SN}$ is the SN mechanical energy input rate.

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate determination of binary fractions ($f_{\rm b}$) and mass ratio ($q$) distributions is crucial for understanding the dynamical evolution of open clusters. We present an improved multiband fitting technique to enhance the analysis of binary properties. This approach enables an accurate photometric determination of $f_{\rm b}$ and $q$ distribution in a cluster. The detectable mass ratio can be down to the $q_{\rm lim}$, limited by the minimum stellar mass in theoretical models. First, we derived an empirical model for magnitudes of Gaia DR3 and 2MASS bands that match the photometry of single stars in the Pleiades. We then performed a multiband fitting for each cluster member, deriving the probability density function (PDF) of its primary mass ($\mathcal{M}_1$) and $q$ in the Bayesian framework. 1154 main-sequence (MS) single stars or unresolved MS+MS binaries are identified as members of the Pleiades. By stacking their PDFs, we conducted a detailed analysis of binary properties of the cluster. We found the $f_{\rm b}$ of this sample is $0.34 \pm 0.02$. The $q$ distribution exhibits a three-segment power-law profile: an initial increase, followed by a decrease, and then another increase. This distribution can be interpreted as a fiducial power-law profile with an exponent of -1.0 that is determined in the range of $0.3 < q < 0.8$, but with a deficiency of binaries at lower $q$ and an excess at higher $q$. The variations of $f_{\rm b}$ and $q$ with $\mathcal{M}_1$ reveal a complex binary distribution within the Pleiades, which might be attributed to a combination of primordial binary formation mechanisms, dynamical interactions, and the observational limit of photometric binaries imposed by $q_{\rm lim} (\mathcal{M}_1)$.

 - **Abstract**
 Gas and dust in the Galactic Center are subjected to energetic processing by intense UV radiation fields, widespread shocks, enhanced rates of cosmic-rays and X-rays, and strong magnetic fields. The Giant Molecular Clouds in the Galactic Center present a rich chemistry in a wide variety of chemical compounds, some of which are prebiotic. We have conducted unbiased, ultrasensitive and broadband spectral surveys toward the G+0.693-0.027 molecular cloud located in the Galactic Center, which have yielded the discovery of new complex organic molecules proposed as precursors of the "building blocks" of life. I will review our current understanding of the chemistry in Galactic Center molecular clouds, and summarize the recent detections toward G+0.693-0.027 of key precursors of prebiotic chemistry. All this suggests that the ISM is an important source of prebiotic material that could have contributed to the process of the origin of life on Earth and elsewhere in the Universe.
#### AT2021aeuk: A Repeating Partial Tidal Disruption Event Candidate in a Narrow-line Seyfert 1

 - **Abstract**
 A black hole (BH) can tear apart a star that ventures within its tidal radius, producing a luminous flare as the stellar debris falls back, known as a tidal disruption event (TDE). While TDEs in quiescent galaxies are relatively well understood, identifying TDEs in active galactic nuclei (AGN) still remains a significant challenge. We present the discovery of AT2021aeuk, a transient exhibiting dual flares within around three years in a narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy. Multi-wavelength observations triggered during the second flare in 2023 revealed an extraordinary X-ray V-shaped light curve, strongly anti-correlated with the optical light curve and accompanied by a lag of $\sim$40 days. This behavior is inconsistent with both supernova and pure AGN origins. In addition, a new broad component emerges in the Balmer lines during the second flare, showing a clear reverberation signal to the continuum variation. We propose that the dual-flare may be linked to a repeating partial TDE (rpTDE), where the second flare results from a collision between the TDE stream and the inner accretion disk, triggering an optical flare while simultaneously partially destroying the X-ray corona. However, other mechanisms, such as a stellar-mass BH (sBH) merger within an accretion disk, could produce similar phenomena, which we cannot entirely rule out. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory will be a powerful tool for further investigating the nature of such events in the future.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent solar observations of bipolar light bridges (BLBs) in sunspots have, in a few individual cases, revealed magnetic fields up to 8.2 kG, which is at least twice as strong as typical values measured in sunspot umbrae. However, the small number of such observations hinted that such strong fields in these bright photospheric features that separate two opposite-polarity umbrae, are a rare phenomenon. We determine the field strength in a large sample of BLBs with the aim of establishing how prevalent such strong fields are in BLBs. We apply a state-of-the-art inversion technique that accounts for the degradation of the data by the intrinsic point spread function of the telescope, to the so far largest set of spectropolarimetric observations, by Hinode/Solar Optical Telescope spectropolarimeter, of sunspots containing BLBs. We identified 98 individual BLBs within 51 distinct sunspot groups. Since 66.3% of the BLBs were observed multiple times, a total of 630 spectropolarimetric scans of these 98 BLBs were analysed. All analysed BLBs contain magnetic fields stronger than 4.5 kG at unit optical depth. The field strengths decrease faster with height than the fields in umbrae and penumbrae. BLBs display a unique continuum intensity and field strength combination, forming a population well separated from umbrae and the penumbrae. The high brightness of BLBs in spite of their very strong magnetic fields points to the presence of a so far largely unexplored regime of magnetoconvection.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive galaxies in cooling flow clusters display clear evidence of feedback from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Joint X-ray and radio observations have shown that AGN radio jets push aside the surrounding hot gas and form cavities in the hot intracluster medium (ICM). These systems host complex, kiloparsec-scale, multiphase filamentary structures, from warm ionized (10,000 K) to cold molecular ($<$100 K). These striking clumpy filaments are believed to be a natural outcome of thermally unstable cooling from the hot ICM, likely triggered by feedback processes while contributing to feeding the AGN via Chaotic Cold Accretion (CCA). However, the detailed constraints on the formation mechanism of the filaments are still uncertain, and the connection between the different gas phases has to be fully unveiled. By leveraging a sample of seven X-ray bright cooling-flow clusters, we have discovered a tight positive correlation between the X-ray surface brightness and the H$\alpha$ surface brightness of the filaments over two orders of magnitude, as also found in stripped tails.

 - **Abstract**
 The Lyman-alpha (LyA) line of atomic hydrogen encodes crucial information about both the intrinsic sources and surrounding environments of star-forming regions throughout the Universe. Due to the complexity of resonant scattering, analytic solutions remain scarce, with most studies focusing on idealized, static configurations. However, observations of LyA emitting galaxies consistently reveal signatures of outflows, imprinted through red-peak dominance in spectral line profiles. In this paper, we derive novel analytic solutions for resonant-line radiative transfer in moving media, specifically homologous-like cloud expansion and unbounded cosmological flows, which capture the main physics of velocity gradients. To validate these analytic solutions and identify regimes where diffusion-based assumptions hold, we introduce a robust Gridless Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer (GMCRT) method. By integrating optical depths exactly in the comoving frame, GMCRT updates photon frequencies continuously to account for Doppler shifts induced by velocity gradients. We demonstrate excellent consistency between GMCRT and our analytic solutions in regimes where diffusion approximations apply. At higher velocities or lower optical depths, discrepancies highlight the limitations of simplified formalisms. We also provide scaling relations for a point source in a cloud with a maximum-to-thermal velocity ratio beta = V_max / v_th, as modifying the standard dependence on line centre optical depth of (atau_0)^1/3 by additional factors, e.g. characteristic escape frequency scale as x_esc ~ beta^1/3, force multipliers as M_F ~ beta^-1/3, and trapping time as t_trap ~ beta^-2/3. Our work complements numerical simulations by improving physical intuition about nonstatic environments when interpreting LyA observations and guiding future subgrid prescriptions in galaxy formation models.

 - **Abstract**
 We employ deep learning (DL) to improve photometric redshifts (photo-$z$s) in the Kilo-Degree Survey Data Release 4 Bright galaxy sample (KiDS-Bright DR4). This dataset, used as a foreground for KiDS lensing and clustering studies, is flux-limited to $r<20$ mag with mean $z=0.23$ and covers 1000 deg$^2$. Its photo-$z$s were previously derived with artificial neural networks from the ANNz2 package, trained on the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) spectroscopy. Here we considerably improve over these previous redshift estimations by building a DL model, Hybrid-z, which combines four-band KiDS images with nine-band magnitudes from KiDS+VIKING. The Hybrid-z framework provides photo-$z$s for KiDS-Bright, with negligible mean residuals of O($10^{-4}$) and scatter at the level of $0.014(1+z)$ -- reduction by 20% over the previous nine-band derivations with ANNz2. We check our photo-$z$ model performance on test data drawn from GAMA, as well as from other KiDS-overlapping wide-angle spectroscopic surveys, namely SDSS, 2dFLenS, and 2dFGRS. We find stable behavior and consistent improvement over ANNz2 throughout. We finally apply Hybrid-z trained on GAMA to the entire KiDS-Bright DR4 sample of 1.2 million galaxies. For these final predictions, we design a method of smoothing the input redshift distribution of the training set, to avoid propagation of features present in GAMA, related to its small sky area and large-scale structure imprint in its fields. Our work paves the way towards the best-possible photo-$z$s achievable with machine learning for any galaxy type both for the final KiDS-Bright DR5 data and for future deeper imaging, such as from the Legacy Survey of Space and Time.

 - **Abstract**
 The dwarf galaxies comparable to the LMC and SMC, with stellar masses $7.5 <{\rm log}(M_{\ast}/M_{\odot})<9.5$, are found in a diversity of environments and have long quenching timescales. The way this phenomenon results from the dwarfs' halo properties or their locations in the large-scale structure is not well understood. We study the star-formation rates of dwarfs in the Illustris TNG50 simulation across different environments, focusing on the dwarfs having host halos with virial masses $9 < {\rm log}(M_{200}/M_{\odot}) < 11.5$, which we demonstrate are in the field as opposed to dwarf satellites in hosts with ${\rm log}(M_{200}/M_{\odot}) \geq 11.5$. Our field dwarf sample is heterogeneous, consisting of primary (central) galaxies, with smaller numbers of secondaries and dwarf galaxies that are on backsplash orbits around massive galaxies. We quantify the field dwarfs' large-scale environmental using the tidal index $\Theta_1$ and the distance to the nearest massive galaxy ${\rm d_{massive}}$, and we study how the quenched fraction and star-formation histories are correlated with these metrics. Those with ${\rm d_{massive}}>1.5$ Mpc and $\Theta_1<0$ are well isolated, with only $\sim 1\%$ being quenched. The quenched field dwarfs are in majority the backsplash dwarfs located in the neighborhood of cluster-scale halos. We discover a two-halo galactic conformity signal that arises from the tendency of the quenched dwarfs, particularly the backsplash sample, to have a quenched massive galaxy as a neighbor. We attribute the low quenched fractions of the simulated LMC/SMC analogs in the field to the locations of their low-mass hosts in the sparse large-scale environment, which predominate over the relatively small number of backsplash and pre-processed dwarfs in denser environments.
