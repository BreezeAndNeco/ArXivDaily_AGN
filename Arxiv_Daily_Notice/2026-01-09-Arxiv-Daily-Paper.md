#### Disk-to-Corona State Transition and Extreme X-ray Variability in the Tidal Disruption Event AT2019teq
 - **Authors:** Vera Berger, Erin Kara, Joheen Chakraborty, Megan Masterson, Kevin Burdge

 - **Abstract**
 We present a five-year X-ray spectral and timing analysis of the optically selected Tidal Disruption Event (TDE) AT2019teq, which displays extreme variability, including order-of-magnitude changes in flux on minute-to-day timescales, and a rare late-time emergence of hard X-ray emission leading to the longest-lived corona in a known TDE. In one epoch, we detect sub-mHz quasi-periodic oscillations with significance tested via MCMC-based red-noise simulations (p $\leq 0.03$). AT2019teq exhibits a clear spectral evolution from a soft (blackbody-dominated) state to a hard (power-law-dominated) state, with a late-time radio brightening that may be associated with the state transition. We identify similarities between AT2019teq's evolution and X-ray binary soft-to-hard state transitions, albeit at higher luminosity and much faster timescales. We use the presence of both a disk-dominated and a corona-dominated state to apply multiple mass estimators from X-ray spectral and variability properties. These techniques are mutually consistent within $2\sigma$ and systematically yield a lower black hole mass ($\log(M_{BH}/M_{\odot}) = 5.67 \pm 0.09$) than inferred from host galaxy scaling ($\log(M_{BH}/M_{\odot})=6.14 \pm 0.19$).

 - **Abstract**
 The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array and the James Webb Space Telescope are transforming our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution in the early Universe. By combining their capabilities, these observatories provide unprecedented insights into the gas, dust, and stars of high-redshift galaxies at spatially resolved scales, unveiling the complexities of their interstellar medium, kinematics, morphology, active galactic nuclei, and star formation activity. This review summarizes recent breakthroughs in the study of galaxies during the first billion years of cosmic history, highlighting key discoveries, open questions, and current limitations. We discuss how observations, theoretical models, and simulations are shaping our understanding of early galaxy evolution and identify promising directions for future research. While significant progress can be achieved through optimized use of existing facilities and collaborative efforts, further advances will require enhanced angular resolution and sensitivity, motivating upgrades to current instruments and the development of next-generation observatories.

 - **Abstract**
 The Fermi and eROSITA bubbles in the Milky Way represent an archetypal case of galactic nucleus feedback, yet their origin remains highly debated. Here we use hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the formation of the "Fermi bubbles" in the nearby Circinus galaxy, a pair of kpc-scaled elliptical bubbles seen in both radio and X-ray observations. We find that a pair of active galactic nucleus (AGN) jets drive forward shocks in the circumgalactic medium, and after evolving for ~0.95 Myr, the shock-delineated bubble pair roughly matches the observed Circinus bubbles in size and morphology. Our mock X-ray image and spectrum reproduce the observed edge-brightened X-ray surface brightness distribution and spectrum quite well, and suggest that non-thermal emissions from the jet ejecta also contribute substantially to radio and X-ray emissions from the inner "hotspot" region. We further show that AGN winds tend to produce more spherical bubbles with a wider base near the galactic plane, inconsistent with observations. The hotspot emissions and the misalignment between the galaxy rotational axis and the bubble's axis argue against a starburst wind origin. Our study thus corroborates the AGN jet-shock model for the origin of both the Circinus bubbles and the Fermi bubbles, and suggests that AGN jet feedback may be a common origin of extended gaseous bubbles in regular disk galaxies, potentially playing an important role in their evolution.
#### Investigating HII Regions in the Disk of NGC 7331 with the Circumgalactic H$α$ Spectrograph

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the ionized gas kinematics of HII regions in the disk of NGC 7331 using integral field unit data collected with the Circumgalactic H$\alpha$ Spectrograph (CH$\alpha$S). NGC 7331 is a well-studied nearby galaxy with HII regions resolved by seeing-limited observations, making it ideally suited for this work. The galaxy disk features vigorous star formation, especially in the central ring of starburst activity. We present a catalog of 136 HII regions detected in the SIRTF Nearby Galaxies Survey (SINGS) H$\alpha$ image. Using this refined catalog, we perform aperture photometry on the SINGS narrowband H$\alpha$ images of NGC 7331, extracting the H$\alpha$ luminosity L(H$\alpha$) of these regions. We present corresponding measurements of the average line-of-sight ionized gas velocity dispersion $\sigma$ in these HII regions with CH$\alpha$S. High-resolution velocity and dispersion maps of the galactic disk are produced from the CH$\alpha$S spectral imaging, selecting spaxels with high signal to noise in order to measure velocity dispersions as low as 12 km s$^{-1}$. Our measurements of the L(H$\alpha$), $\rm \Sigma_{SFR}$ and $\sigma$ in NGC 7331 are consistent with spatially resolved observations of HII regions in large surveys of nearby galaxies. We explore the L(H$\alpha$)$- \sigma$ relationship, identifying turbulent HII regions with nonthermal dispersions likely driven by stellar feedback. The dispersion is correlated with the star formation rate surface density, and using the relation $\rm \sigma \propto \epsilon \Sigma_{SFR}^{\alpha}$, HII regions in NGC 7331 are best fit by $\epsilon = 80$ , $\alpha =0.285$.

 - **Abstract**
 Decayless kink oscillations are frequently observed in solar coronal loops and are considered potential contributors to coronal heating. Despite the ubiquity of this wave phenomenon, its driving mechanism remains unclear. Studies to derive the polarization state of these oscillations, which would be a key to identifying the drivers, have been limited due to observational constraints. We analyze a 3D MHD simulation of coronal loops using the MURaM code. Synthetic extreme ultraviolet (EUV) emission maps, combined with velocity diagnostics, are used to identify and characterize transverse wave motions in the simulated loop structures. This is the first demonstration of decayless kink waves emerging self-consistently in a 3D MHD loop-in-a-box model. The simulation produces persistent, low-amplitude, decayless kink oscillations that closely match observed properties. These oscillations arise spontaneously, without any imposed periodic driver, and exhibit clear linear polarization with oscillation planes not aligned to the principal axes. The observed coherency of linear polarization with oscillation cycles favors a self-sustained or quasi-steady type wave driver over a stochastic or broadband source.

 - **Abstract**
 The recent detection of a nanohertz stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) challenges conventional astrophysics by observed signal amplitude exceeds predictions from standard SMBHB populations without implausible accretion histories. To resolve this amplitude tension, we introduce the Radiative SIDM Dilution this http URL explain the observed spectrum emerges as a hybrid signal by an astrophysical floor, dynamically suppressed by the cored halos of Self-Interacting Dark Matter (SIDM),and a dominant cosmological peak generated during a supercooled phase transition in the dark sector. By performing a free spectral reconstruction and Bayesian model comparison, we demonstrate that a transition defined by a nucleation temperature $T_* \approx 1.24$ MeV and inverse duration $\beta/H_* \approx 150$ not only fills the spectral gap left by stalled binaries but yields statistical evidence($\Delta \text{BIC} \approx 15$) over purely standard astrophysical interpretations. The thermodynamics required to reproduce this SGWB signature also resolves the thermal overproduction of resonant SIDM. The entropy injected by the transition naturally provides the specific dilution factor $D \approx 100$ needed to reset the dark matter relic density to observation. This mechanism also has broader cosmological this http URL residual dark radiation alleviates the Hubble tension $\Delta N_{\rm eff} \sim 0.3$ while bubble collisions generate magnetohydrodynamic turbulence sufficient to seed primordial magnetic fields $B_0 \sim 10^{-13}$ G. These convergences suggest that the NANOGrav excess is not an anomaly, but the acoustic signature of the entropy injection event that rendered the dark sector cosmologically viable.

 - **Abstract**
 Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are the compact, energetic central regions of galaxies, powered by supermassive black holes that accrete surrounding gas and dust. Their optical spectra can be identified by strong emission-line signatures (broad and/or narrow lines). Those showing only narrow lines are classified as 'Type 2' AGN. Extensive surveys like SDSS cover AGN in the Northern Sky, but the equivalent coverage in the Southern Sky remains limited. We address this by presenting a new catalogue of Type 2 AGN from the 6dF Galaxy Survey (6dFGS), which has 136,304 spectra covering roughly 17{,}000~\mathrm{deg}^2, mainly of low-redshift galaxies. We use a median absolute deviation cut on the continuum-fitted spectrum to select emission line galaxies. AGN were identified by fitting the 6dFGS spectra with a modified Python QSO fitting tool (PyQSOFit). All selected spectra were visually inspected and corrected for fitting errors where necessary. 10,492 narrow emission line galaxies were identified in 6dFGS, including 5000 Type 2 AGN classified from Baldwin--Phillips--Terlevich (BPT) diagram. They have a median redshift of z$ \sim 0.032$ and a median $[\mathrm{O\,III}]$ luminosity of $\Log(L_{[\mathrm{O\,III}]}/ergs s^{-1}) \sim 40.04$.

 - **Abstract**
 The jet compositions of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are very important to understand the energy dissipation and radiation mechanisms, but it remains an open question in GRB physics. In this paper, we present a systematic analysis to search for 88 bright GRBs that include a total of 129 pulses observed by Fermi/GBM with redshift measured, and extract the spectra of each pulse with Band function (Band), cutoff power-law (CPL), blackbody (BB), non-dissipative photospheric (NDP), Band+BB, as well as CPL+BB. We find that 80 pulses, 35 pulses, and 14 pulses present purely non-thermal, hybrid, and thermal spectra, respectively. By focusing on those 80 pulses with purely non-thermal spectra, one can estimate the lower limits of magnetization factor ($\sigma$) via suppressing the pseudo-thermal component. It is found that 30 pulses in 21 GRBs are the lower limit of $\sigma>5$ at the photosphere by adopting $R_{0}=10^{10}$ cm. It suggests that at least the outflow of those GRB jets with high $\sigma$ is dominated by Poynting-flux. On the other hand, we also perform the light curve fitting with a fast-rise-exponential-decay (FRED) model for 15 bright GRBs with a high magnetization factor in our sample, and find that a correlation between pulse width ($w$) and energy of 13 GRBs really exists in their energy-resolved light curves. It is also a piece of independent evidence for those GRBs with a high value $\sigma$ to support the origin of the Poynting flux outflow.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the UV/X-ray joint spectral analyses of four Seyfert~1 galaxies (PG 0804+761, NGC 7469, SWIFT J1921.1-5842, and SWIFT J1835.0+3240) using the data acquired with the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope and Soft X-ray Telescope onboard AstroSat. We model the intrinsic UV/X-ray continuum with the accretion disk, warm and hot Comptonization using the OPTXAGNF and FAGNSED models, where the disk seed photons are Comptonized in the warm and hot corona. The Eddington ratio of the four Seyferts ranges from 0.01 to 1. In the case of SWIFT J1835.0$+$3240, we infer a compact warm corona ($ R_{warm} - R_{hot} \lesssim 18 r_{g}$) while, PG 0804+761, NGC 7469, and SWIFT J1921.1-5842 may exhibit a larger warm Comptonizing region ($\gtrsim 32r_{g}$). We could constrain the spin parameter in PG 0804+761, $a^{\star} = 0.76_{-0.20}^{+0.08}$ (1$\sigma$ error), with the FAGNSED model. In SWIFT J1835.0+3240 and SWIFT J1921.1-5842, the UV/X-ray spectral variability may be driven by the thermal Comptonization of the disk seed photons in the hot corona. Furthermore, the observed spectral hardening with the decrease in disk temperature and accretion rate compared to earlier observations may indicate a state transition in SWIFT J1835.0+3240 from a high/soft to a low/hard state.

 - **Abstract**
 In this pilot study, we investigate the PN population in M~33, a nearby spiral galaxy ($\simeq 840$~kpc), using data from the DR3 of the Javalambre-Photometric Local Universe Survey (J-PLUS), a 12-band photometric dataset extensively used to identify H$\alpha$ line emitters. From the 143 known PNe of M~33, the photometry of only 13 are present in the J-PLUS catalog, as available on the J-PLUS portal. With the aim of recovering a larger fraction of the M~33 PN population, the software SExtractor is adopted to extract the sources in the J-PLUS images and obtain the photometric data for the PNe known in the literature, performing PSF photometry when possible. With this procedure the photometry of 98 PNe was obtained using H$\alpha$ image as detection image, including the 13 already present in the J-PLUS catalog. Using diagnostic color-color diagrams (DCCDs) based on criteria developed for Milky Way halo PNe, we identified 16 sources with PN-like colors. Cross-match with existing catalogs revealed that most of these candidates are H II regions, though one source remains unidentified. Additionally, analyzing their full width at half maximum, most of them would not be PN candidates. This highlights the method's ability to select emission-line objects but also underscores the challenge of distinguishing PNe from contaminants using photometry alone. The J-PLUS colors of 98 known PNe were analyzed, together with literature information on their radial velocities, resulting in the identification of one possible halo PN. This is the first paper which aims at detecting extragalactic PNe in multi-band surveys such as J-PLUS, the Southern Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS) and the Javalambre-Physics of the Accelerating Universe Astrophysical Survey (J-PAS), paving the way for similar studies in these surveys for other nearby galaxies, which lack catalogs of known PNe.

 - **Abstract**
 Research on dual active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is crucial for understanding the coevolution of galaxies and supermassive black holes. However, the current number of dual AGNs remains scarce. In this work, we selected 173 new dual AGNs, 4 AGN triplets, and 1 AGN quadruplet from the Million Quasars Catalog, all with low redshift ($z < 0.5$), a projected distance ($r_p$) of no more than 100 kpc, and a line-of-sight velocity difference ($|\Delta v|$) of less than 600 km s$^{-1}$, thus supplementing existing low-redshift dual AGNs demographics. Visual inspection of the optical images from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Legacy Survey was performed for each pair, revealing that $\sim$16\% of pairs exhibit tidal features. Statistical analyses show an increasing number of dual AGNs with decreasing redshift, with velocity difference primarily at $|\Delta v| < $ 300 km s$^{-1}$, which is likely an artifact of our selection strategy. The tidal sample peaks as having 13 pairs at 5-20$h^{-1}_{70}$ kpc, but drops to 1 pair $> 55\,h^{-1}_{70}$ kpc. Our study also explores thewide separation ($r_p>10$ kpc) dual AGNs, finding 165 such systems, with 25 displaying clear tidal features. Furthermore, some extra galaxies, AGNs, and/or their candidates were found in the same regions of the pairs or multiplets forming interacting systems with these pairs or multiplets.
#### Explainable machine learning classification of \textit{Chandra} X-ray sources: SHAP analysis of multi-wavelength features

 - **Abstract**
 Extensive astronomical surveys, like those conducted with the {\em Chandra} X-ray Observatory, detect hundreds of thousands of unidentified cosmic sources. Machine learning (ML) methods offer an efficient, probabilistic approach to classify them, which can be useful for making discoveries and conducting deeper studies. In earlier work, we applied the LightGBM (ML model) to classify 277,069 {\em Chandra} point sources into eight categories: active galactic nuclei (AGN), X-ray emitting stars, young stellar objects (YSO), high-mass X-ray binaries, low-mass X-ray binaries, ultraluminous X-ray sources, cataclysmic variables, and pulsars. In this work, we present the classification table of 54,770 robustly classified sources (over $3\sigma$ confidence), including 14,066 sources at $>4\sigma$ significance. To ensure classification reliability and gain a deeper insight, we investigate the multiwavelength feature relationships learned by the LightGBM model, focusing on AGNs, Stars, and YSOs. We employ Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques, specifically, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), to quantify the contribution of individual features and their interactions to the predicted classification probabilities. Among other things, we find infrared-optical and X-ray decision boundaries for separating AGN/Stars, and infrared-X-ray boundaries for YSOs. These results are crucial for estimating object classes even with limited multiwavelength data. This study represents one of the earliest applications of XAI to large-scale astronomical datasets, demonstrating ML models' potential for uncovering physically meaningful patterns in data in addition to classification. Finally, our publicly available, extensive, and interactive catalogue will be helpful to explore the contributions of features and their combinations in greater detail in the future.
#### Empirical Evidence of Planetary Group Configurations Modulating Solar Activity

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04669

 - **Abstract**
 Our prior research found that a $90^{\circ}$ configuration of two planetary groups were temporally associated with significant changes in global electromagnetic standing waves (Schumann resonances) during and after the three $90^{\circ}$ configuration events occurring in late 2017 and early 2018. Specifically noted were reductions in variability moving into an event and level changes immediately after a event. Because global standing-wave data have a short history and no $90^{\circ}$ events have occurred since that period, we examine here whether these geometric configuration events correspond to similar signatures in the long sunspot count record. Using daily sunspot data from January 1935 through December 2024, we conducted empirical studies assessing variance changes, post-event level shifts, and potential intrinsic oscillatory structure. In Study A, a variance-ratio test showed that sunspot variability was systematically lower during the events than in the preceding period, with 21 of 26 events since 1935 exhibiting reduced variance (binomial $p=0.0025$). In Study B, solar activity level declined roughly 21 days after events ended, with 21 of 26 events showing negative changes (binomial $p=0.0025$). In Study C, wavelet and filtering analyses revealed no internal solar oscillations at comparable timescales. These findings provide empirical evidence that the configuration events are associated with shifts in solar activity. The next three configuration events in mid- and late-2026 offer an opportunity to assess these patterns in real time.
#### First measurement of the Hubble constant from a combined weak lensing and gravitational-wave standard siren analysis

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new measurement of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) resulting from the first joint analysis of standard sirens with weak gravitational lensing and galaxy clustering observables comprising three two-point correlation functions (3$\times$2pt). For the 3$\times$2pt component of the analysis, we use data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 3 release. For the standard sirens component, we use data from the Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog 4.0 released by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) Collaboration. For GW170817, the only standard siren for which extensive electromagnetic follow-up observations exist, we also use measurements of the host galaxy redshift and inclination angle estimates derived from observations of a superluminal jet from its remnant. Our joint analysis yields $H_0 = 67.9^{+4.4}_{-4.3}$~km~s$^{-1}$~Mpc$^{-1}$, a $6.4\%$ measurement, while improving the DES constraint on the total abundance of matter $\Omega_m$ by $22\%$. Removing the jet information degrades the $H_0$ precision to $9.9\%$. The measurement of $H_0$ remains a central problem in cosmology with a multitude of approaches being vigorously pursued in the community aiming to reconcile significantly discrepant measurements at the percent-level. In light of the impending new data releases from DES and LVK, and anticipating much more constraining power from 3$\times$2pt observables using newly commissioned survey instruments, we demonstrate that incorporating standard sirens into the cosmology framework of large cosmic surveys is a viable route towards that goal.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigated the long-term evolution of the cyclotron line energy, as well as the relationship between cyclotron line energy and luminosity in the high-mass X-ray binary Vela X-1, based on archival Swift/BAT monitoring from 2005 to 2024 and pulse-to-pulse analysis of nine NuSTAR observations from 2012 to 2024. Our results provide the first confirmation that the long-term decay of the harmonic line energy ($E_{\rm cyc,H}$) in Vela X-1 has ended. We further report the first detection of a transient increase in $E_{\rm cyc,H}$ between 2020 and 2023, which suggests a sudden and significant change in the magnetic field configuration or accretion geometry. In addition, $E_{\rm cyc,H}$ shows slightly lower values at low luminosities and tends to flatten at higher luminosities, in the range of $(0.13\text{--}1.21) \times10^{37} $erg $\rm{s}^{-1}$. The fundamental line energy ($E_{\rm cyc,F}$) exhibits no significant variation with time or luminosity, remaining stable at approximately 25 keV.

 - **Abstract**
 While the temporal variations of the spectro-polarimetric nature of pulsars remains unexplored, this investigation offers significant potential for uncovering key insights into pulsar emission mechanisms, magnetic field geometry, and propagation effects within the magnetosphere. We developed a package for investigating time-varying spectral behavior for full Stokes parameters and demonstrate it on a millisecond pulsar (MSP) J2144-5237 in a binary system (orbital period ~10 days) using the Parkes UWL receiver. In this study we report rotation measure (RM) variation with orbital phase. We find that the temporal variations in the spectra of Stokes I, Q, and V are generally correlated throughout the orbit, while Stokes U exhibits intervals of both correlation and anticorrelation with Stokes I, depending on the orbital phase. We also provide a Poincare sphere representation of the polarization properties of J2144-5237, demonstrating a systematic temporal change of Poincare sphere location for the main component with orbital phase. To our knowledge, this is the first investigation of time-varying properties of the spectro-polarimetric nature of any pulsars or MSPs. Extending this study to probe the spectro-temporal nature of full Stokes data on a larger sample of MSPs or pulsars has the potential to provide vital information on emission mechanisms inside the magnetosphere, interstellar propagation effects, and binary interactions.
#### Triaxial Magnetars as Sources of Fast Radio Bursts

 - **Abstract**
 I suggest that some of the mysterious temporal properties of Fast Radio Bursts (FRB) may be explained if they are produced by dynamically triaxial magnetars. If the bursts are narrowly collimated along open field lines, then observed repeating FRB may be those in which the moment of inertia tensor is only slightly triaxial and the rotation axis, open field lines and radiation point nearly to the observer. Apparently non-repeating FRB may be triaxial with the direction of open field lines and radiation wandering across the sky, reducing their duty factors by several orders of magnitude. A slightly triaxial moment tensor in repeaters moves the line of sight into or out of the radiation pattern or within it, explaining periods of greater or lesser (or absent) activity, and making the probability of detecting a burst vary aperiodically. The dynamics of triaxial bodies may also thwart the coherent integration of gravitational signals from fast-rotating accreting neutron stars.

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) remains a long-standing problem in astrophysics. Recent JWST observations reveal an unexpectedly abundant population of overmassive black holes at z>4-6, where the BH masses lie far above local scaling relations and not reproduced by current cosmological models. How such overmassive black holes form and rapidly grow within young galaxies has remained unclear. Here we present fully cosmological radiation-hydrodynamic simulations that, for the first time, self-consistently follow the birth, early growth, and emergent observable signatures of SMBHs in proto-cluster environments. We find that heavy seeds of order $10^6 M_\text{sun}$ naturally form, exceeding typical theoretical expectations by an order of magnitude. These seeds rapidly develop dense, optically thick disks whose strong electron scattering produces broad H$\alpha$ emission comparable to that seen in little red dots (LRDs). Sustained super-Eddington accretion then drives fast growth to $\sim 3 \times 10^7 ~M_\text{sun}$ by $z \sim 8$. These results provide a unified physical scenario in which LRDs correspond to a short-lived, enshrouded phase of heavy-seed formation, naturally evolving into the overmassive quasars detected by JWST and ultimately the progenitors of today's SMBHs.

 - **Abstract**
 The nature of the remnant of a binary neutron star (BNS) merger is uncertain. Though certainly a black hole (BH) in the cases of the most massive BNSs, X-ray lightcurves from gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows suggest a neutron star (NS) as a viable candidate for both the merger remnant as well as the central engine of these transients. When jointly observed with gravitational waves (GWs), X-ray lightcurves from BNS merger events could provide critical constraints on the remnant's nature. We aim to assess the current and future capabilities to detect a NS remnant through X-ray observations following GW detections. To this end, we simulate GW signals from BNS mergers and the subsequent X-ray emission from newborn millisecond magnetars. The GW detectability is modeled for both current and next-generation interferometers, while the X-ray emission is reproduced using a dedicated numerical code that models magnetar spin-down and ejecta dynamics informed by numerical-relativity simulations. In our simulations, 2% - 16% of BNS mergers form millisecond magnetars. Among these, up to 70% could be detectable, amounting to up to 1 millisecond magnetar detection per year with SVOM/MXT-like instruments during the LIGO Virgo KAGRA LIGO India (LVKI) O5 run, with optimal detectability occurring about 2 hours post-merger. For next-generation GW interferometers, this rate could increase by up to three orders of magnitude, with peak detectability 3 to 4 hours post-merger. We also explore how the magnetar's magnetic field strength and observer viewing angle affect detectability and discuss optimized observational strategies. Although more likely with upcoming GW interferometers, detecting the spin-down emission of a millisecond magnetar may already be within reach, warranting sustained theoretical and observational efforts given the profound implications for mergers, GRBs, and NS physics of a single detection.

 - **Abstract**
 The launch of relativistic jets of plasma on astrophysical to cosmological scales are observed in a variety of astrophysical sources, from active galactic nuclei to X-rays binaries. While these jets can be reproduced by the general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic (GRMHD) and particle-in-cells (GRPIC) simulations of the dynamical Kerr magnetosphere, the development of analytic models to describe the physics of the jets has remained limited. A key challenge is to analytically describe the individual trajectories of accelerated charged particles which ultimately build up the jet and emit radiation. In this work, we provide a first simple but fully analytical model of jet launching from the Kerr magnetosphere based on the motion of charged particles. To that end, we use the integrability of electrogeodesic motion in the Kerr monopole magnetosphere to study the ejection of charged particles near the poles. This enables us to derive (i) a criterion for the rotation axis to constitute a stable latitunal equilibrium position, thereby representing an idealized jet, (ii) the expression for the magnetic frame-dragging effect, and (iii) the condition for an asymptotic observer to measure blueshifted particles emanating from the black hole surroundings. Our study reveals that particles can be accelerated only in a specific region whose maximal radius depends on the spin and magnetization of the black hole. Alongside these results, we provide a detailed review of the construction of test magnetospheres from (explicit and hidden) symmetries of the Kerr geometry and the condition for the separability of the electrogeodesic motion in a test magnetosphere, which serves as a basis for the model we study in this work.

 - **Abstract**
 Ionisation controls the chemistry, thermal balance, and magnetic coupling in protoplanetary discs. However, standard ionisation vectors such as stellar UV, X-rays, Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs) might not be efficient enough, as UV/X-rays are attenuated rapidly with depth, while GCRs are modulated. Turbulence-induced magnetic reconnection in disc atmospheric layers offers a physically motivated, in-situ source of energetic particles (EPs) that has never been considered. We quantify the ionisation and heating produced by EPs accelerated by turbulent reconnection, identify where they dominate over X-rays and GCRs, and determine energetic thresholds for their relevance. We provide scalable diagnostics tied to the local energy budget. We adopt a Fermi-like acceleration model with parameters linked to a turbulent reconnection geometry trigger by the magneto-rotational instability, yielding a steady-state energy distribution of the EP forming a power-law of index $p=2.5$. We propagate electrons and protons through the disc and compute primary and secondary ionisation and associated heating on a fiducial T Tauri disc model background. The non-thermal normalisation is set by the fraction of local viscous accretion energy dissipation channelled to EPs, parametrised by $\kappa$. For $\kappa\gtrsim 0.4\%$, EPs ionisation overpass standard sources like X-rays and GCRs in the disc atmosphere and intermediate/deep layers out to radii of a few tens of AU. Even at $\kappa\sim 0.025\%$, EPs contribute at the few-percent level, thus are chemically and dynamically relevant. EP-induced heating complements UV/X-ray heating in the atmosphere and persists deeper. These results identify EPs accelerated by turbulence-induced magnetic reconnection as a rather robust, disc-internal ionisation channel that should be included in thermo-chemical and dynamical models of protoplanetary discs.

 - **Abstract**
 Active galactic nuclei are known to exhibit flux variations across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Among these, correlations between UV/optical and X-ray flux variations serve as a key diagnostics for understanding the physical connection between the accretion disk and the corona. In this work, we present the results of analysis of ultraviolet (UV) and X-ray flux variations in the narrow line Seyfert 1 galaxy Mrk 1044. Simultaneous observations in the far-UV band (FUV: 1300$-$1800 Å) and the X-ray band (0.5$-$7 keV) obtained during 31 August $-$ 8 September 2018 with the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope and the Soft X-ray Telescope onboard \textit{AstroSat} were used for this study. Significant flux variability was detected in both FUV and X-ray bands. The fractional root mean square variability amplitude ($F_{\rm var}$) was found to be 0.036 $\pm$ 0.001 in the FUV band and 0.384 $\pm$ 0.004 in the X-ray band. To explore potential time lag between the two bands, cross-correlation analysis was performed using both the interpolated cross-correlation function (ICCF) and just another vehicle for estimating lags in nuclei (JAVELIN) methods. Results from both approaches are consistent within 2$\sigma$ uncertainty, indicating that X-ray variations lead the FUV variations, with measured lags of 2.25$\pm$0.05 days (ICCF) and $2.35_{-0.01}^{+0.02}$ days (JAVELIN). This is the first detection of a time delay between UV and X-ray variations in Mrk 1044. The observed UV lag supports the disk reprocessing scenario, wherein X-ray emission from the corona irradiates the accretion disk, driving the observed UV variability.
#### Addressing Known Challenges in Solar Flare Forecasting I: Limb-Flare Prediction with a 4-pi Full-Heliosphere Framework

 - **Abstract**
 A demonstrated failure mode for operational solar flare forecasting is the inability to forecast flares that occur near, or just beyond, the solar limb. To address this shortcoming, we develop a "4pi" full-heliosphere event forecasting framework and evaluate its statistical classification ability against this specific challenge. A magnetic surface flux transport model is used to generate full-sun maps of the photospheric radial magnetic field from which active regions (ARs) are identified and tracked using a new labeling scheme that is observer-location agnostic and allows for post-facto modifications. Flare-relevant magnetic parameters couple to a "visibility" index that specifies AR location relative to the visible solar limb and expected flare detection. Flare labels are assigned according to peak Soft X-ray flux, and a statistical classification is performed using nonparametric discriminant analysis. A version where new or emerging ARs on the far ("invisible" side of the Sun are incorporated into the model by way of far-side helioseismology, is also tested. We evaluate the new framework by its performance specifically including the limb areas using Brier Skill Score and ROC Skill Score, finding improvement at the 2-sigma level or less. However, we do find that the number of False Negatives, or "missed" forecasts decreases, and find strong evidence that the additional information provided by the far-side helioseismology can help predict near- and just-beyond-limb flares, particularly for East-limb events. While individual components of this framework could be improved, we demonstrate that a known failure mode for solar flare forecasting can be mitigated with available resources.

 - **Abstract**
 The central molecular zone (CMZ), surrounding the Galactic centre, is the largest reservoir of dense molecular gas in the Galaxy. Despite its relative proximity, the 3D structure of the CMZ remains poorly constrained, primarily due to projection effects. We aim to constrain the line-of-sight location of two molecular clouds in the CMZ -the 50 and 20 km/s clouds- and to investigate their possible physical connection using stellar kinematics and photometry. This study serves as a pilot for future applications across the full CMZ. We estimated the line-of-sight position of the clouds by analysing stellar kinematics, stellar densities, and stellar populations towards the cloud regions and a control field. We find an absence of westward moving stars in the cloud regions, which indicates that they lie on the near side of the CMZ. This interpretation is supported by the stellar density distributions. The similar behaviour observed in the two clouds, as well as in the region between them (the ridge), suggests that they are located at comparable distances and are physically linked. We also identified an intermediate-age stellar population (2-7 Gyr) in both regions, consistent with that observed on the near side of the CMZ. We estimated the line-of-sight distances at which the clouds and the ridge become kinematically detectable (i.e. where the proper motion component parallel to the Galactic plane differs from that of the control field at the 3 sigma level) by converting their measured proper motions parallel to the Galactic plane using a theoretical model of the stellar distribution. We find that the 50 and 20 km/s clouds are located at $43\pm8$ pc and $56\pm11$ pc from Sgr A*, respectively, and that the ridge lies at $56\pm11$ pc; this supports the idea that the clouds are physically connected through the ridge.
