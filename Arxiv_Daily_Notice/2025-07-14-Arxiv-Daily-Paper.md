 - **Abstract**
 Deep imaging of structures from the Cosmic Dawn (CD) and the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) in five targeted fields is one of the highest priority scientific objectives for the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Selecting 'quiet' fields, which allow deep imaging, is critical for future SKA CD/EoR observations. Pre-observations using existing radio facilities will help estimate the computational capabilities required for optimal data quality and refine data reduction techniques. In this study, we utilize data from the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) Phase II extended array for a selected field to study the properties of foregrounds. We conduct deep imaging across two frequency bands: 72-103 MHz and 200-231 MHz. We identify up to 2,576 radio sources within a 5-degree radius of the image center (at RA (J2000) $8^h$ , Dec (J2000) 5°), achieving approximately 80% completeness at 7.7 mJy and 90% at 10.4 mJy for 216 MHz, with a total integration time of 4.43 hours and an average RMS of 1.80 mJy. Additionally, we apply a foreground removal algorithm using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and calculate the angular power spectra of the residual images. Our results indicate that nearly all resolved radio sources can be successfully removed using PCA, leading to a reduction in foreground power. However, the angular power spectra of the residual map remains over an order of magnitude higher than the theoretically predicted CD/EoR 21 cm signal. Further improvements in data reduction and foreground subtraction techniques will be necessary to enhance these results.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a multi-phase study of the gas in the circumnuclear region (~1.1x1.0 kpc^2) of the nearby Seyfert 1.8 galaxy NGC 1365, observed in the context of the Mid-IR Activity of Circumnuclear Line Emission (MIRACLE) program. We combined spatially resolved spectroscopic observations from JWST/MIRI, VLT/MUSE, and ALMA to investigate the ionized atomic gas and the warm and cold molecular phases. MIRI data revealed over 40 mid-IR emission lines from ionized and warm molecular gas. Moment maps show that both cold and warm molecular gas follow the rotation of the stellar disk along the circumnuclear ring. The ionized gas displays flux and kinematic patterns that depend on ionization potential (IP): low-IP species (<25 eV) trace the disk, while higher-IP lines (up to ~120 eV) trace outflowing material. The [O III]5700 and [Ne V]14 lines both trace the southeast nuclear outflow cone. Additionally, [Ne V]14 detects the northwest counter-cone, obscured in the optical and thus invisible in [O III]5700. Mid-IR diagnostics, unlike optical ones, clearly reveal the AGN as the primary ionization source in the nucleus. Emission from high-IP species is spatially coincident with the ionization cones and not with star-forming regions. Using the [Ne V]24/[Ne V]14 ratio, we derive an electron density of (750+-440) cm^(-3), in agreement with values from the [S II] optical doublet. For the first time, we apply a fully self-consistent approach combining advanced photoionization and kinematic models (HOMERUN+MOKA3D) to constrain intrinsic outflow properties, overcoming the limitations of simplified classical methods. Exploiting the synergy of JWST/MIRI and VLT/MUSE, HOMERUN reproduces fluxes of over 60 emission lines from optical to mid-IR, disentangling AGN and star formation contributions and yielding robust estimates of outflow mass, geometry, and energetics.

 - **Abstract**
 Supernova 2023ixf occurred on May 18th 2023 in the nearby galaxy Messier 101 (D ~ 6.85 Mpc), making it the closest supernova in the last decade. Following its discovery, astronomers around the world rushed to observe the explosion across the electromagnetic spectrum in order to uncover its early-time properties. Based on multi-wavelength analysis during its first year post-explosion, supernova 2023ixf is a type II supernova that interacted with dense, confined circumstellar material in its local environment -- this material being lost from its red supergiant progenitor in the final years before explosion. In this article, we will review the findings of >80 studies already published on this incredible event as well as explore how the synthesis of SN 2023ixf observations across the electromagnetic spectrum can be used to constrain both type II supernova explosion physics in addition to the the uncertain mass loss histories of red supergiant stars in their final years.
#### Reverberation Mapping Data of NGC 5548 Imply a Multicomponent Broad-Line Region

 - **Abstract**
 Line broadening and variability are observational hallmarks of active galactic nuclei which allow us to measure supermassive black hole masses as well as constrain the geometry and kinematics of the emitting gas, with the most precise measurements requiring a degree of modeling. Two popular models of the broad-line region describe the emitting gas as either a distribution of puffed up clouds or a thin disk with strong velocity gradients. As we show in this work, key features in the reverberation mapping dataset obtained by the AGN STORM team in NGC 5548 cannot be accounted for by either simple model. In several emission lines the observed broad-line profile has a single peak yet the delay profile has a distinct double peak, strongly motivating a BLR with emission from multiple components. We demonstrate a few possibilities that may alleviate the tension and better represent the true nature of the broad-line emitting gas in NGC 5548 and beyond.
#### Magnetic properties of orphan penumbrae

 - **Abstract**
 Orphan penumbrae (OPU) are features resembling sunspot penumbrae, but are not connected to an umbra. Here we compare OPUs and sunspot penumbrae, including their filaments. We also identify and describe the main mechanisms for the formation of OPUs and we characterise their decay process. Our study is based on spectropolarimetric inversions of active regions observed with the Hinode spectropolarimeter. We manually identified 80 individual OPUs, allowing us to study them statistically. In addition, we analysed the time-evolution of selected OPUs using data provided by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager. Orphan penumbrae display a broad range of shapes, associated with typically $\Omega$-shaped magnetic field configurations, where opposite polarity fields predominate at the two ends of the OPU. In addition, the properties of the OPU filaments are remarkably uniform between different OPUs, resembling the ones in sunspot penumbrae. Most OPUs form by either a patch of a penumbra separating from a sunspot, or by new magnetic flux emerging close to the polarity inversion line of an active region. We observe chromospheric fibrils above almost all OPUs in Hinode H$\alpha$ images, indicating that a part of the magnetic field of the OPUs extends to the chromosphere. Our results show that OPU filaments can form given a broad range of boundary conditions for the magnetic field.

 - **Abstract**
 The gas-phase metallicity affects heating and cooling processes in the star-forming galactic interstellar medium (ISM) as well as ionising luminosities, wind strengths, and lifetimes of massive stars. To investigate its impact, we conduct magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the ISM using the FLASH code as part of the SILCC project. The simulations assume a gas surface density of 10 M$_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$ and span metallicities from 1/50 Z$_\odot$ to 1 Z$_\odot$. We include non-equilibrium thermo-chemistry, a space- and time-variable far-UV background and cosmic ray ionisation rate, metal-dependent stellar tracks, the formation of HII regions, stellar winds, type II supernovae, and cosmic ray injection and transport. With the metallicity decreasing over the investigated range, the star formation rate decreases by more than a factor of ten, the mass fraction of cold gas decreases from 60% to 2.3%, while the volume filling fraction of the warm gas increases from 20% to 80%. Furthermore, the fraction of H$_\mathrm{2}$ in the densest regions drops by a factor of four, and the dense ISM fragments into approximately five times fewer structures at the lowest metallicity. Outflow mass loading factors remain largely unchanged, with values close to unity, except for a significant decline at the lowest metallicity. Including the major processes that regulate ISM properties, this study highlights the strong impact of gas phase metallicity on the star-forming ISM.

 - **Abstract**
 Mergers of compact objects, binary black holes and mergers including at least one neutron star, are a predicted source of high-energy neutrinos. These astrophysical events are now routinely detected through observation of their gravitational wave signature and, at least in one instance, their electromagnetic counterparts were also detected. Particles accelerated during the coalescence of compact objects may also interact to produce high-energy neutrinos, which have yet to be detected, but observations are ongoing. The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration publicly releases information on candidate gravitational wave events from compact binary coalescences in low latency during the current observing run (O4). To aid the electromagnetic follow-up, using data from the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, we search, in real time, for neutrinos spatially and temporally coincident with these gravitational wave candidate events using a time window of 1000 seconds centered on the merger time. We use two methods, both of which have been previously used to search for neutrino emission from gravitational-wave transients: an unbinned maximum likelihood analysis applied to significant alerts and a Bayesian analysis with astrophysical priors, applied to both significant and low-significance alerts. In addition, we search for long-duration neutrino emission up to 14 days after the merging of binaries containing a neutron star. We report analysis results determined in real time for these searches, and set upper limits on both flux and isotropic-equivalent energy emitted in neutrinos.

 - **Abstract**
 newASTROGAM is a breakthrough mission concept for the study of the non-thermal Universe from space with gamma rays in the energy range from 15 keV to 3 GeV. It is based on advanced space-proven detector technologies, which will achieve unprecedented sensitivity, angular and energy resolution combined with polarimetric capability. Since the MeV gamma-ray energy range is the most under-explored electromagnetic window to the Universe, a mission in this energy range can for the first time sensitively address fundamental astrophysics questions connected to the physics of compact objects and merger events, jets and their environments, supernovae and the origin of the elements, potentially constrain the nature of dark matter and many more science objectives. The mission will detect and follow-up many of the key sources of multi-messenger astronomy in the 2040s. newASTROGAM provides an unprecedentedly broad energy coverage from keV to GeV energies. The payload concept consists of a Silicon tracker combined with a crystal calorimeter. Both detectors are surrounded by an anti-coincidence detector to reject charged cosmic rays. In addition, a thin X-ray coded mask provides very good imaging capabilities. Such a mission can uniquely detect gamma rays via the photoelectric effect, Compton scattering and electron-positron pair production. newASTROGAM is proposed to the ESA call for medium-class mission ideas (M8).

 - **Abstract**
 Radiation belts are regions of magnetically trapped particle radiation found around all of the sufficiently magnetized planets in the Solar System and recently also observed around brown dwarfs, yet despite their ubiquity, there is not yet a general theory or model to predict the uppermost energy limits that any particular magnetospheric system's radiation belts can attain. By considering only the most fundamental loss processes, a model and corresponding theory are developed that successfully bound and explain the maximum observed energies of all documented radiation belt systems. Interestingly, this approach yields a relatively simple function for the uppermost energy limit that depends on only the surface magnetic field strength of the system. The model predicts an energy limit for all radiation belt systems that asymptotes at 7 +/- 2 TeV (for protons and electrons), offering intriguing new insight on potential sources of galactic cosmic rays. This model is also applied to an exoplanetary system, demonstrating that the planet is likely a synchrotron emitter and showcasing the model's use for identifying candidate targets for synchrotron-emitting astrophysical systems and revealing details critical to habitability at those remote worlds.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy clusters produce a very hostile environment to galaxies, whose gas gets stripped by ram-pressure, suffer galaxy interactions and witness quenching of their star formation. Clusters, like Abell 2142, grow not only through galaxy accretion but also through group infall. Our goal is to study the physical and dynamical state of the most conspicuous infalling group, on a filament projected at 1.3 Mpc from the Abell 2142 centre. The galaxy group is the leading edge of a spectacular trailing 700-kpc-long X-ray tail of hot gas stripped by ram-pressure. The infalling galaxies are not quenched yet, and are ideal objects to study the transformation processes due to the cluster environment. We use integral field spectroscopy from MaNGA to derive stellar and gas kinematics, and MegaCam for ugr photometry. Stellar populations (with age and metallicity) are obtained through full-spectrum fitting using Nburst. The gas kinematics and excitation are derived from the line emission of H$\alpha$, [NII], [OIII] and H$\beta$. The group contains four galaxies, of which two are merging and partly superposing on the line of sight. With a simple parametric model for each velocity field, we succeed in disentangling the contribution of each galaxy and derive their physical state and kinematics. The galaxies are perturbed, and intra-group gas is observed as tidal tails and loops. They are mainly disks in rotation, although some regions reveal elevated dispersion, typical of out-of-equilibrium gas. All galaxies show sustained star formation, with a global star formation rate of 45 M$_\odot$/yr. We conclude that the long X-ray tail must have come from the hot intra-group medium, present before the group infall, and does not correspond to the ram-pressure stripping of the galaxy gas. The galaxy interactions within the group are still enhancing the star formation, from the disks that are still rich in dense gas.
#### BASS XLVIII: [Ne v] λ3427 Emission in Powerful Nearby Active Galactic Nuclei

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08179

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the high-ionization, narrow [Ne v] $\lambda$3427 emission line in a sample of over 340 ultrahard X-ray (14-195 keV) selected Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) drawn from the BASS project. The analysis includes measurements in individual and stacked spectra, and considers several key AGN properties such as X-ray luminosity, supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass, Eddington ratios, and line-of-sight column density. The [Ne v] $\lambda$3427 line is robustly detected in ~43% (146/341) of the AGN in our sample, with no significant trends between the detection rate and key AGN/SMBH properties. In particular, the detection rate remains high even at the highest levels of obscuration (>70% for log[N_H/cm^-2] > 23). On the other hand, even some of our highest signal-to-noise spectra (S/N > 50) lack a robust [Ne v] detection. The typical (median) scaling ratios between [Ne v] line emission and (ultra-)hard X-ray emission in our sample are log L[Ne v]/L(14-150 keV) = -3.75 and log L[Ne v]/L(2-10 keV) = -3.36. The scatter on these scaling ratios, of ~0.5 dex, is comparable to, and indeed smaller than, what is found for other commonly used tracers of AGN radiative outputs (e.g., [O III] $\lambda$5007). Otherwise, we find no significant relations between the (relative) strength of [Ne v] and the basic AGN/SMBH properties under study, in contrast with simple expectations from models of SMBH accretion flows. Our results reaffirm the usability of [Ne v] as an AGN tracer even in highly obscured systems, including dual AGN and high redshift sources.
#### Time Variation in the TeV Cosmic Ray Anisotropy with IceCube and Energy Dependence of the Solar Dipole

 - **Abstract**
 There is an observed anisotropy in the arrival direction distribution of cosmic rays in the TeV-PeV regime with variations on the scale of one part in a thousand. While the origin of this anisotropy is an open question, a possible factor is cosmic-ray interactions with interstellar and heliospheric magnetic fields. These magnetic fields may change over time - for example, due to changes in solar activity throughout its 11-year solar cycle. The cosmic-ray anisotropy can reflect these time-dependent magnetic fields. In addition to these speculative sources, there are several known sources of time variation in this anisotropy, such as the Compton-Getting Effect from the Earth's orbital motion. We discuss a preliminary study with limited statistics of time variation undertaken by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, including a measurement of the Compton-Getting Effect as well as a general, model-independent search for other time variations. Further, we use the Compton-Getting Effect to present a preliminary measurement of the cosmic-ray spectral index as a function of energy below the knee.
#### Dynamo Confinement of a Radiatively Spreading Solar Tachocline Revealed by Self-consistent Global Simulations

 - **Abstract**
 The helioseismically observed solar tachocline is a thin internal boundary layer of shear that separates the rigidly-rotating solar radiative zone from the differentially-rotating convective zone and is believed to play a central role in the 22-year solar dynamo cycle. The observed thinness of the tachocline has long been a mystery, given the expected tendency of such shear to undergo radiative spreading. Radiative spreading is the process by which the meridional circulation and angular velocity burrow into a stably-stratified fluid owing to the mitigating effect of radiative thermal diffusion. A confinement mechanism is thus required to keep the tachocline so thin. In previous work using global dynamo simulations, we achieved a statistically-stationary confined tachocline where the confinement mechanism was derived from the Maxwell stress arising from a dynamo-generated nonaxisymmetric poloidal magnetic field. However, the parameters chosen meant that the tachocline was confined against viscous spread instead of radiative spread. Here, we show that the previously identified dynamo confinement mechanism still succeeds in a simulation that lies in the more solar-like radiative spreading regime. In particular, a nonaxisymmetric, quasicyclic dynamo develops in the convective zone and overshoot layer, penetrates into the radiative zone via a novel type of skin effect, and creates a Maxwell stress that confines the tachocline over many magnetic cycles. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first fully self-consistent rendering of a confined tachocline in a global numerical simulation in the parameter regime appropriate to the Sun.

 - **Abstract**
 The supernova remnant (SNR) RCW86 is among the few SNRs with Balmer-emission lines containing broad and narrow spectral components that trace fast, non-radiative shocks in partially-ionized gas.\ These are invaluable laboratories for collisionless shock physics, especially for poorly-understood phenomena like electron-ion equilibration, and shock precursors. Here we present the first $\sim$0.3 pc spatial scale integral field unit (IFU) observations of the southwestern RCW86 shock, obtained as part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-V Local Volume Mapper (SDSS-V LVM). The forward shock, clearly visible as thin filaments in narrowband images, have broad H$\alpha$ components, indicating shock velocities varying from 500--900 km/s in the south to 1000--1500 km/s in the north. The varying velocity widths and broad-to-narrow intensity ratios show that electrons and ions have lower equilibration ($T_e/T_p \rightarrow 0.1$) in faster ($>$800 km/s) shocks, in line with previous studies. The broad components are generally redshifted from the narrow components by $\lesssim$100 km/s, likely due to shock-obliquity or non-Maxwellian post-shock distributions. We observe high extinction-corrected Balmer-decrements of 3--5 in the narrow components, indicating that conversion of Ly$\beta$ photons to H$\alpha$ is more efficient than Ly$\gamma$ to H$\beta$. Broad HeII$\lambda$4686 was marginally ($\gtrsim$2$\sigma$) detected in the southern shock, meaning the shock is impacting gas with high ($>$30--100\%) neutral fraction. We also find the first evidence of an intermediate H$\alpha$ component in RCW86, with $\Delta$V(FWHM) = 193--207 km/s, likely due to a neutral precursor. We also briefly discuss the southwestern radiative shock, and lay out the exciting future of studying astrophysical shocks with LVM.

 - **Abstract**
 Active galactic nuclei (AGN) play a crucial role in galaxy evolution by influencing the observational properties of their host galaxies. We investigate the host galaxy properties of X-ray selected AGNs, focusing on differences between obscured and unobscured AGNs, and between high-(log([OIII]5007/H$\beta$}$>$0.5) and low-excitation sources (log([OIII]5007/H$\beta$$<$0.5). We selected a sample of AGNs from the spectroscopic zCOSMOS survey with 0.5 $< zsp <$ 0.9 based on the Mass-Excitation (MEx) diagram and X-ray emission. AGNs were classified as obscured or unobscured using hydrogen column density, and as high- or low-excitation based on the [OIII]5007/H$\beta$ ratio. We analysed various AGN properties, including the hardness ratio, X-ray luminosity, emission line ratios such as the ionisation-level sensitive parameter O32=log([OIII]5007/[OII]3727), and the metallicity sensitive parameter R23=log(([OIII]5007+[OII]3727/H$\beta$), and the specific black hole accretion rate. Unobscured AGNs exhibit a more evident correlation between the [OIII]5007/[OII]3727 ionisation ratio and X-ray luminosity than obscured AGNs, while high-excitation obscured AGNs reach, on average, higher X-ray luminosities. Furthermore, high-excitation AGNs typically show high values of R23, suggesting low metallicities, similar to that observed in high-redshift galaxies (4 $< z <$ 6). We find a positive correlation between the parameters $\lambda$sBHAR and N$_H$, R23 and O32 parameters. The correlation suggests that AGNs with a high specific accretion rate have not only a higher production of high-energy photons, which ionise the surrounding medium more intensely, but are also usually associated with environments less enriched in heavy elements. These results provide insights into the complex interplay between AGN activity, host galaxy properties, and the role of obscuration in shaping galaxy evolution.
#### The Rosetta Stone Project. I. A suite of radiative magnetohydrodynamics simulations of high-mass star-forming clumps

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Star formation and, in particular, high-mass star formation are key astrophysical processes that are far from being fully understood. Unfortunately, progress in these fields is slow because observations are hard to interpret as they cannot be directly compared to numerical simulations. Synthetic observations are therefore necessary to better constrain the models. Aims. With the Rosetta Stone project, we aim to develop an end-to-end pipeline to compare star formation simulations with observations as accurately as possible in order to study the evolution from clumps scales to stars. Methods. Using the adaptive mesh-refinement code RAMSES, we computed a first grid of model of star-forming clumps to develop our pipeline and explore the impact of the clump initial conditions on their evolution. The main purpose of this set of simulations is to be converted into synthetic observations to enable a direct comparison with real star-forming clumps observed with Herschel and ALMA. Results. The Rosetta Stone simulations presented here provide a catalog available for full post-processing and subsequent comparison with observations (RS1). Among all the parameters explored here, the strength of the magnetic field has the strongest influence on the clump evolution (fragmentation, star formation, global collapse) at both large and small scales. Numerical parameters such as the resolution per Jeans length or the threshold for accretion onto sink particles affects the formation of low-mass sinks. Finally, the widely used L/M ratio is found to be a good indicator of the clump evolutionary state regardless of its initial condition, but this could change when more feedback processes (jets, HII regions) are included. Conclusions. We now have a new suite of simulations of star-forming clumps that is available for full post-processing and subsequent comparison with the observations,

 - **Abstract**
 Type III radio bursts are a signature of the flux of near-relativistic electrons ejected during solar flares. These bursts are frequently observed by spacecraft such as the Parker Solar Probe. It is traditionally believed that these electron beams generate Langmuir waves through the two-stream instability, which are then converted into electromagnetic waves. In this study, we revise that model by examining how the electron distribution becomes truncated due to the "time-of-flight" effect as the beam travels through a randomly inhomogeneous, and gently varying solar-wind plasma. Rather than the two-stream instability, this truncation destabilizes the distribution and leads to the generation of Langmuir waves via a linear instability; we confine our analysis to this linear regime and do not take into account the back reaction of the generated Langmuir waves on the electron distribution, which is nonlinear. The instability grows until slower electrons arrive and dampen the waves. Our qualitative analysis shows that the resulting wave intensity growth and decay closely match the intensity-time profile of observed Type III radio bursts at the fundamental frequency, supporting this modified theory.

 We report on the $\gamma$-ray emission above 100~MeV from the GOES M3.3 flare SOL2012-06-03. The hard X-ray (HXR) and microwave emissions have typical time profiles with a fast rise to a well-defined peak followed by a slower decay. The $>$100~MeV emission during the prompt phase displayed a double-peaked temporal structure with the first peak following the HXR and microwaves, and the second one, about three times stronger, occurring $17 \pm 2$ seconds later. The time profiles seem to indicate two separate acceleration mechanisms at work, where the second $\gamma$-ray peak reveals a potentially pure or at least largely dominant ion acceleration. The Atmospheric Imaging Assembly imaging shows a bright elliptical ribbon and a transient brightening in the north-western (NW) region. Nonlinear force-free extrapolations at the time of the impulsive peaks show closed field lines connecting the NW region to the south-eastern part of the ribbon and the magnetic topology revealed clusters of nulls. These observations suggest a spine-and-fan geometry, and based on these observations we interpret the second $\gamma$-ray peak as being due to the predominant acceleration of ions in a region with multiple null points. The $>$100 MeV emission from this flare also exhibits a delayed phase with an exponential decay of roughly 350 seconds. We find that the delayed emission is consistent with ions being trapped in a closed flux tube with gradual escape via their loss cone to the chromosphere.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the problem of magnetic confinement of accreted matter forming an accretion mound near the magnetic poles of a neutron star. We calculate the magnetic field geometry of the accreted mound by solving the magnetostatic Grad Shafranov (GS) equation in radially stretched spherical coordinates with high resolution and an extended domain. In this work, we propose a new physically motivated multipolar current free boundary condition at the outer radial boundary. We have evaluated a large suite of GS solutions for different neutron star magnetic fields and mound configurations. We find that with sufficient resolution, the ring-shaped mound profiles spread latitudinally on the neutron star surface, towards the equator, with a potential decline in dipole moment at outer radii, demonstrating the onset of field burial. A higher latitudinal spread towards the equator leads to more effective magnetic field burial. Along with the ring-shaped mound profile on a hard crust majorly used in this work, we also model mounds formed on a pre-existing ocean, which is more physically motivated. Additionally, we explore different GS solutions for a quadru-dipolar surface magnetic field. We find that such configurations lead to asymmetric polar mounds. We discuss the validity of such solutions for different relative strengths of the quadrupole and dipolar components.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic fields are expected to impact the atmospheric dynamics of hot and ultra-hot Jupiters due to their increased ionization fractions, compared to that of cooler exoplanets, but our ability to model these magnetic processes is limited by the different coupling regimes between the day and night sides of the planets. One common approach is to approximate the magnetic interactions as a drag acting on the atmosphere. In this work, we examine, within the context of this drag approximation, the impact of including vertical and meridional drag, in addition to zonal drag, from a background dipole magnetic field on the flows in hot Jupiter atmospheres as well as a relaxation of the assumption of solely meridional currents and demonstrate that the inclusion of meridional and vertical drag can limit flows over the poles in hotter atmospheres, something not seen in models that only consider zonal drag, and the assumption of only meridional currents results in an underestimation of the equatorial drag in all cases examined.

 - **Abstract**
 The slow particle diffusion in pulsar halos, inferred from TeV gamma-ray surface brightness profiles, is attributed to cross-field diffusion under the anisotropic diffusion model. This model assumes sub-Alfvénic interstellar turbulence in the surrounding medium of the pulsar and a rough alignment of the line-of-sight of observers towards the pulsars with the local mean magnetic field direction in the halo. In this model, the expected morphology of a pulsar halo is highly dependent on the properties of the interstellar magnetic field. We investigate the anisotropic diffusion of electron-positron pairs across multiple coherence of magnetic fields in pulsar halos in this work. We focus particularly on their influences on the predicted gamma-ray surface brightness profile and the asymmetry of the halo's morphology, as well as the observational expectations by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). Our results indicate that the requirement of a specific magnetic field geometry can be alleviated when accounting for a limited (and realistic) coherence length of the magnetic field in the model. Also, the halo's morphology may appear less asymmetric, especially after being smoothed by the point spread function of instruments. It largely relaxes the tension between the asymmetric morphology of halos predicted by the model and lack of apparent asymmetric halos detected so far. Our findings demonstrate the important influence of the coherence length of interstellar magnetic field on the distribution of particles around their accelerators, and the consequence on the measured source morphology.

 - **Abstract**
 Here we report on a new survey for pulsars and transients in the 10 pc region around Sgr A* using the Effelsberg radio telescope at frequencies between 4 to 8 GHz. Our calibrated full-Stokes data were searched for pulsars and transients using PulsarX, TransientX and PRESTO. Polarisation information is used in the scoring of the candidates. Our periodicity acceleration and jerk searches allowed us to maintain good sensitivity towards binary pulsars in $\gtrsim$ 10-hr orbits. In addition we performed a dedicated search in linear polarisation for slow transients. While our searches yielded no new discovery beyond the redetection of the magnetar SGR J1745-2900, we report on a faint single pulse candidate in addition to several weak periodicity search candidates. After thoroughly assessing our survey's sensitivity, we determined that it is still not sensitive to a population of millisecond pulsars. Next generation radio interferometers can overcome the limitations of traditional single-dish pulsar searches of the Galactic Centre.

 We present an update on the arrival-direction analyses conducted on intermediate angular scales using the complete Phase I data of the Pierre Auger Observatory up to the end of $2022$ with a total exposure of $135{,}000\,\text{km}^2\,\text{sr}\,\text{yr}$. We show the arrival-direction distribution of the ultra-high-energy cosmic rays along the supergalactic plane above $20\,\text{EeV}$, and an update in the search for magnetically-induced signatures in the arrival directions. Furthermore, we present the potential of introducing estimators for the rigidity ordering of the events to enhance arrival-direction analyses on small to intermediate angular scales. To achieve this, we take advantage of two estimators working on the response of the surface detector: an analytical fit based on air-shower universality and a deep neural network.

 - **Abstract**
 The surface detector of the Pierre Auger Observatory has recently been upgraded with the addition of radio antennas, forming the radio detector (RD). This contribution outlines the standard methods for reconstructing extensive air showers using the RD, along with recent developments. The reconstruction pipeline is based on a robust understanding of the detector itself. The entire instrument, including the antenna pattern and analog chain, has been meticulously characterized within the Offline software framework, based on measurements in the laboratory as well as in the field. To ensure data integrity, stations identified as unreliable through monitoring are excluded before event reconstruction. Absolute calibration is achieved at the 5 percent level by analyzing the diffuse galactic radio emission. Next, the electric field that induced voltages in the antenna is calculated by unfolding the antenna response pattern. Key observables, such as the energy fluence (the energy deposited in the ground per unit area) and the arrival time of the pulse, are then determined. With these quantities, shower parameters can be reconstructed with very good accuracy in two chi-square-minimization fits: one to determine the shower's arrival direction via a spherical wavefront fit (predicted within 0.2 degree), and the other to estimate the distance to the shower maximum and the electromagnetic cascade energy (predicted within 5 percent) using a lateral density function

 - **Abstract**
 The large-scale dipolar structure in the arrival directions of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays with energies above $8\,$EeV observed by the Pierre Auger Collaboration is a well-established anisotropy measurement. This anisotropy is understood to be of extragalactic origin, as the maximum of the dipolar component is located ${\sim}115^\circ$ away from the Galactic Center. Cosmic rays interact with background radiation and magnetized regions on their path from their sources to Earth. These interactions, which depend on the cosmic-ray energy, charge and mass composition, give rise to different horizons and deflections that are expected to lead to different anisotropies in the arrival directions of cosmic rays at Earth. The Auger Collaboration has determined that the mass composition of cosmic rays at ultra-high energies is mixed, becoming increasingly heavier as a function of energy. Thus, different dipole amplitudes are expected to be measured at a given energy when separating the data into composition-distinct subsets of lighter and heavier elements. In this contribution, we investigate the composition signature on the large-scale anisotropy taking advantage of composition estimators obtained from the data gathered with the surface detector. A way of probing for composition signatures in anisotropy patterns is then to divide the data into subsets of ``lighter'' and ``heavier'' elements per energy bin. In a simulation library, we evaluate the possibility of measuring a separation in total dipole amplitude between two such populations of the measured dataset under a source-agnostic model. We present the results using two different composition estimators, one based on air-shower universality and one inferred with deep learning.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first photo- and spectropolarimetric observations of the changing-look active galactic nucleus NGC~1346 taken with the Perkins telescope (November 2022, March 2025) and VLT/FORS2 (August and September 2024), which have revealed a new spectral transition. We find that NGC~1346 has reverted to its former (2001) type-1 spectral state after having been a type-2 active galactic nucleus from 2004 to 2022. More and more intense broad H$\beta$ (3720 $\pm$ 310 km.s$^{-1}$ full width at half maximum) and H$\alpha$ (2985 $\pm$ 230 km.s$^{-1}$) emission lines appeared between August and September 2024, suggesting that the broad-line region (BLR) is increasingly irradiated. The strong blueshift of the Balmer lines ($\sim$ 1600 km.s$^{-1}$) indicates that the gas is moving toward the observer, possibly due to a radiation-driven outflow. The strong difference between 2022's ($\sim$ 3\%) and 2024-2025's de-biased polarization ($\le$ 0.5\%), the blueing of the spectra between August and September 2024, and the slow rise in the integrated flux between 2022 and 2025 argue against asymmetric or temporary obscuration by a cloud passing in front of the line of sight. Two options, either a re-illumination of the BLR or a tidal disruption event, can explain the observed properties of NGC~1346. Timely follow-up observations taken while the phenomenon is still ongoing are needed to determine which of the two solutions is the correct one.

 - **Abstract**
 Lorentz invariance violation is a feature of several quantum gravity models in which Lorentz symmetry is broken at high energies, possibly leading to changes in particle behavior and interactions. In this work, we investigate vacuum Cherenkov radiation, a reaction in which an electron spontaneously emits a photon. This process, forbidden when Lorentz symmetry is unbroken, is a phenomenological consequence of some quantum gravity models. We derive, for the first time, the spectra for the vacuum Cherenkov reaction, and confirm our results numerically. These results can be used to derive limits on Lorentz invariance violation.

 - **Abstract**
 We present results of optical identifications for Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) radio sources using the Ultraviolet Near Infrared Optical Northern Survey (UNIONS). A cross-match between UNIONS and VLASS Epoch 2 catalogs yields 146,212 radio galaxies down to $r=24.5$ mag over a wide area of $\sim4,200\ \mathrm{deg^2}$. We perform g-dropout selections and find $>200$ sources at $z\sim4$ optimistically. Of 63,019 sources with valid photo-$z$, 8,692 are at $z_\mathrm{photo}>1$, and 1,171 are at $z_\mathrm{photo}>2$. Based on spectral luminosities at 1.4 GHz using the valid photo-$z$, we identify $\sim49,000$ radio-loud AGNs (RLAGNs) with $\textit{L}_\mathrm{1.4GHz}>10^{24}$ W/Hz, and all radio galaxies at $z>1$ are RL. Adopting radio loudness instead, 138,266 out of 146,212 UNIONS-VLASS radio galaxies are RL. Thus, our catalog greatly increases the number counts of RLAGNs at $z>1$. We further cross-match the UNIONS-VLASS catalog with LOw-Frequency ARray Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) at 144 MHz and Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-cm (FIRST) at 1.4 GHz, yielding 101,671 UNIONS-VLASS-LoTSS, 79,638 -FIRST, and 64,672 -LoTSS-FIRST sources, respectively. This multifrequency radio dataset reveals sources of various spectral shapes, including the steep spectrum of aged populations, the peaked spectrum of young populations, and the upturned spectrum potentially associated with transient sources. The UNIONS-VLASS radio galaxies will be covered by the Euclid wide survey, offering legacy values to benefit multi-faceted studies related to RLAGNs and beyond.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed spectroscopic study of ionised gas in the nearby (~3.3Mpc) dwarf galaxy NGC 2366, a local analogue of Green Pea galaxies, based on observations with the SCORPIO-2 instrument at the Russian 6-m BTA telescope. Using scanning Fabry-Perot interferometry and long-slit spectroscopy, we examine the gas kinematics, excitation mechanisms, and chemical abundances across the disc of NGC 2366, including its prominent starburst region Mrk 71 and the companion region NGC 2363. We identified 20 regions with locally elevated Ha velocity dispersion, only four of which correspond to known high-energy sources. We argue that one of the remaining objects can be a previously unidentified Wolf-Rayet star and two - supernova remnants. For 15 HII regions, we measure electron temperatures, oxygen and nitrogen abundances via the `direct' Te method, with 12 + log(O/H) ranging from 7.6 to 8.0 in most of the regions. We show that Mrk 71 has higher oxygen abundance compared to the other \HII regions in the galaxy, contrary to the previous indirect estimates suggesting flat gradient throughout the galaxy. Together with the localized spatial variations of metallicity in the area, it is indicative of metal enrichment by the outflow from the super star cluster in the centre of Mrk 71.

 - **Abstract**
 Blazars are characterized by relativistic jets that are closely aligned with our line of sight. This results in relativistic beaming, making blazars among the most luminous extragalactic sources across the electromagnetic spectrum, from radio waves to gamma-rays and, potentially, in high-energy neutrinos. We present a comprehensive study of multi-messenger emission from blazar jets powered by magnetic reconnection occurring at varying distances from the supermassive black hole (SMBH). By generalizing previous models, we explore how the emission characteristics depend self-consistently on the spatial evolution of key jet properties, including magnetization, bulk Lorentz factor, and external photon fields (accretion disc, broad-line region, and dusty torus). Using numerical simulations, we examined the impact of the initial jet magnetization, particle acceleration efficiency, jet-to-accretion power ratio, and mass accretion rate on the broadband photon spectra and neutrino emission. Our findings reveal distinct emission regimes characterized by different dominant radiative processes: synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton dominate closer to the SMBH where magnetization is high, while external Compton (EC) processes become significant near the broad-line region (BLR). Neutrino production efficiency is highest upstream of the BLR, driven by enhanced photon target densities from synchrotron and external photons available for photopion interactions, whereas the proton particle distribution is hard. Our model predictions are compared with observations of gamma-ray luminosities and synchrotron peak energies of Fermi-detected blazars, highlighting magnetic reconnection as a potential mechanism driving both electromagnetic and neutrino emissions in astrophysical jets.

 The IceTop array at the surface of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory measures extensive air showers produced by cosmic-ray particles with energies from PeV up to EeV, covering the transition region from galactic to extragalactic sources. This contribution presents significant improvements that will enhance the measurement of the cosmic-ray energy spectrum. (I) To analyze more than a decade of data with increasing snow overburdens on the detector, an improved method to handle the time-dependent attenuation of the detector signals was developed. (II) New analysis cuts have been developed to increase the measured event rate while improving the reconstruction quality. (III)~A~new reconstruction method that separately fits the electromagnetic and muonic components, while incorporating data from the deep in-ice detector, enables the reconstruction of air showers with cores outside the IceTop array, up to zenith angles of 50°. These improvements will significantly increase the event statistics and extend the IceTop spectrum towards higher energies.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive analysis of the early spectra of type II and type IIb supernovae (SNe) to explore their diversity and distinguishable characteristics. Using 866 publicly available spectra from 393 SNe, 407 from type IIb SNe (SNe IIb) and 459 from type II SNe (SNe II), we analysed H$\alpha$ and He~I 5876 A at early phases ($<40$ days from the explosion) to identify possible differences between these two SN types. By comparing the pseudo-equivalent width (pEW) and full width at half maximum (FWHM), we find that the strength of the absorption component of these lines serves as a quantitative discriminator, with SNe IIb exhibiting stronger lines at all times. The most significant differences emerge within the first 10-20 days. To assess the statistical significance of these differences, we apply statistical methods and machine-learning techniques. Population density evolution reveals a clear distinction in both pEW and FWHM. Quadratic Discriminant Analysis confirms distinct evolutionary patterns, particularly in pEW, while FWHM variations are less pronounced. A combination of t-distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding and Linear Discriminant Analysis effectively separates the two SN types. Additionally, a Random Forest Classifier demonstrates the robustness of pEW and FWHM as classification criteria, allowing for accurate classification of newly observed SNe II and IIb based on computed classification probabilities. Applying our method to low-resolution spectra obtained from the Zwicky Transient Facility Bright Transient, a magnitude-limited survey, we identified 34 misclassified SNe. This revision increases the estimated fraction of SNe IIb from 4.0% to 7.26%. This finding suggests that misclassification significantly impacts the estimated core-collapse SN rate. Our approach enhances classification accuracy and provides a valuable tool for future supernova studies.

 - **Abstract**
 The rapid neutron-capture process (r-process) is responsible for the creation of roughly half of the elements heavier than iron, including precious metals like silver, gold, and platinum, as well as radioactive elements such as thorium and uranium. Despite its importance, the nature of the astrophysical sites where the r-process occurs, and the detailed mechanisms of its formation, remain elusive. The key to resolving these mysteries lies in the study of chemical signatures preserved in ancient, metal-poor stars. In this review, we explore r-process nucleosynthesis, focusing on the sites, progenitors, and formation mechanisms. We discuss the role of potential astrophysical sites such as neutron star mergers, core-collapse supernovae, magneto-rotational supernovae, and collapsars, that can play a key role in producing the heavy elements. We also highlight the importance of studying these signatures through high-resolution spectroscopic surveys, stellar archaeology, and multi-messenger astronomy. Recent advancements, such as the gravitational wave event GW170817 and detection of the r-process in the ejecta of its associated kilonovae, have established neutron star mergers as one of the confirmed sites. However, questions remain regarding whether they are the only sites that could have contributed in early epochs or if additional sources are needed to explain the signatures of r-process found in the oldest stars. Additionally, there are strong indications pointing towards additional sources of r-process-rich nuclei in the context of Galactic evolutionary timescales. This review summarizes what has been learned so far, the challenges that remain, and the exciting prospects for future discoveries. The increasing synergy between observational facilities, computational models, and large-scale surveys is poised to transform our understanding of r-process nucleosynthesis in the coming years.
#### The THESAN-ZOOM project: Mystery N/O more -- uncovering the origin of peculiar chemical abundances and a not-so-fundamental metallicity relation at $3<z<12$

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of metallicities and chemical abundances at $3<z<12$ in the THESAN-ZOOM simulations. We find that smoothly curved gas-phase and stellar mass-metallicity relations (MZR) are already in place at $z\approx12$ and evolve slowly ($\sim$0.2 dex increase for gas, $\sim$0.4 dex increase for stars at a fixed stellar mass) down to $z=3$, governed largely by the efficiency with which galaxies retain their metals, rather than gas fraction. The canonical fundamental metallicity relation (FMR) survives in stars but breaks down and inverts for gas in low-mass galaxies ($M_\ast\lesssim10^{9}\mathrm{M_\odot}$) due to regular dilution by low-metallicity gas inflow. We find broad agreement of gas-phase N/O, Fe/O, and C/O with high-redshift observations, including the presence of nitrogen-rich galaxies (NRGs; $\log(\mathrm{N/O})>-0.6$) without the need for exotic yields in our chemical network. Instead, bursty star formation naturally generates order-of-magnitude excursions in N/O on $\lesssim$100 Myr timescales due to temporally differential galactic winds; after a starburst, stellar feedback expels gas, leaving a large population of asymptotic-giant-branch stars to dominate the enrichment of the relatively low-mass interstellar medium. NRGs lie below the main sequence and typically exhibit $\mathrm{EW}[H$\beta$]\lesssim40$ Å, in apparent tension with observed high-EW NRGs. This tension is reconciled if observed NRGs are in the initial stages of a subsequent starburst, illuminating previously enriched gas, which is supported by the finding of high SFR surface density nitrogen-rich giant molecular clouds.

 - **Abstract**
 Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are among the most energetic phenomena in the universe, capable of regulating star formation in galaxies via radiative and mechanical feedback. While AGN feedback is well studied in host galaxies, its influence on neighbouring galaxies within the same large-scale environment remains less understood. In this work, we use the EAGLE cosmological hydrodynamical simulation to examine how proximity to AGN affects star formation in nearby star-forming galaxies (SFGs) out to 2 Mpc. A control sample matched in stellar mass and local density allows us to isolate AGN-driven environmental effects, quantified through the $\Delta$SFR offset defined as the difference between a galaxy's star formation rate (SFR) and that of its matched controls. We find a significant and mass-dependent impact where $61\%$ of AGN-adjacent SFGs show suppressed star formation, while $39\%$ exhibit enhancement. Although the overall magnitude of these offsets is modest, the trends are statistically robust and consistent across the population. Suppression is prevalent in massive, gas-poor galaxies in high-mass halos, consistent with thermal feedback inhibiting gas cooling. Enhanced SFRs appear in low-mass, gas-rich galaxies, suggesting AGN-driven compression may locally trigger star formation. These trends emerge despite EAGLE implementing AGN feedback as a single-mode, stochastic thermal process, indicating that such models can reproduce both quenching and triggering regimes. Our findings demonstrate that AGN feedback extends well beyond host galaxies, impacting neighbouring systems in a non-uniform, distance-, mass-, and gas-dependent manner. This non-local AGN influence represents a critical, yet often overlooked, mechanism in shaping galaxy evolution within large-scale structures, bridging high-energy astrophysical processes and cosmic-scale environmental regulation.
