 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the impact of gravitational-wave (GW) recoil on the growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the early Universe. Forming ~10^9 Msun SMBHs by z ~ 6 is challenging and may require hierarchical mergers of smaller seed black holes. We extend a semi-analytic seed model (Sassano et al. 2021) by explicitly incorporating GW recoil physics. Our model includes: (1) recoil velocity formulae calibrated to numerical relativity for spinning, unequal-mass BH binaries (Campanelli et al. 2007; Lousto et al. 2012); (2) assignment of spin magnitudes and orientations based on seed type (Pop III remnant, stellar cluster, or direct-collapse); and (3) a retention probability scheme comparing the recoil speed to the host halo escape velocity. We find that including GW recoil reduces final SMBH masses by ~20-30% by z = 6 and creates a population of off-nuclear ("wandering") BHs amounting to a few percent of the total. Observable consequences include spatial offsets ~0.1 arcsec and line-of-sight velocity shifts ~10^2-10^3 km/s in a few percent of high-z quasars. All code is publicly available at this https URL

 - **Abstract**
 Periodic variability in active galactic nuclei (AGN) light curves has been proposed as a signature of close supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries. Recently, 181 candidate SMBH binaries were identified in Gaia DR3 based on periodicity in their $\sim$1000-day light curves. By supplementing Gaia photometry with longer-baseline light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and the Catalina Real Time Transient Survey (CRTS), we test whether the reported periodic signals persist beyond the Gaia DR3 time window. We find that in all 116 cases with available ZTF data, the Gaia-inferred periodic model fails to predict subsequent variability, which appears stochastic rather than periodic. The periodic candidates thus overwhelmingly appear to be false positives; red noise contamination appears to be the primary source of false detections. We conclude that truly periodic AGN are exceedingly rare, with at most a few in $10^6$ AGN exhibiting stable periodicity on 100 to 1000 day timescales. Models predict that the Gaia AGN light curve sample should contain dozens of true SMBH binaries with periods within the observational baseline, so the lack of strictly periodic light curves in the sample suggests that most short-period binary AGN do not have light curves dominated by simple periodicity.

 - **Abstract**
 The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has begun to spectrally characterize small exoplanets orbiting M-dwarf stars, but interpretation of these spectra is ambiguous, with stellar, instrumental, or atmospheric origins possible for apparent spectral features. Consequently, interpretation of JWST small exoplanet spectra follows a Bayesian approach, with less theoretically plausible interpretations facing a higher burden of proof. Here, we use photochemical modeling to evaluate the plausibility of warm exo-Titans, exoplanets with N$_2$-CH$_4$ atmospheres analogous to Titan but orbiting closer to their host stars. Consideration of warm exo-Titans is motivated by arguments from planet formation, as well as tentative evidence from observations. Using TRAPPIST-1e as a case study, we show that the higher instellation experienced by warm exo-Titans reduces their CH$_4$ lifetime $\tau_{\text{CH}_{4}}$ relative to true Titan by orders of magnitude, reducing the probability of observing them. We constrain the $\tau_{\text{CH}_{4}}$ on a warm exo-Titan to be $\leq0.1\times$ (and most likely $\leq0.02\times$) true Titan, implying the absolute probability of detecting a warm exo-Titan is $<0.1$ and likely $<0.01$. This finding is consistent with recent JWST nondetections of CH$_4$-dominated atmospheres on warm terrestrial exoplanets. The low prior probability means that the standard of proof required to claim a warm exo-Titan detection is high, and we offer specific suggestions towards such a standard of proof. Observation of oxidized carbon species would corroborate a putative warm exo-Titan detection. Confirmed detection of warm exo-Titans would signal the need to fundamentally rethink our understanding of the structure, dynamics, and photochemistry of Titan-like worlds.
#### GLACE survey: OSIRIS/GTC multi-object spectroscopy of the rich galaxy cluster ZwCl 0024.0+1652 at z~0.4. III. The mass-SFR relation and the quenching of cluster galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy clusters are among the largest and densest structures in the Universe. Their high density generally increases the suppression of star formation, known as quenching, altering galaxy properties. We study the quenching of emission-line galaxies (ELGs) in the rich cluster ZwCl 0024.0+1652 (Cl0024) at redshift $z\sim0.4$, aiming to determine if and how star formation is suppressed. Using multi-object spectroscopy from the GLACE survey, we extracted fluxes and redshifts of [O II]$\lambda\lambda3727,3729$, $\mathrm{H\beta}$, and [O III]$\lambda5007$ emission lines to derive star formation rates (SFRs) for 173 ELGs. We also performed spectral energy distribution fitting to obtain key evolutionary parameters such as stellar masses ($M_\star$) and the 4000 Å break ($D4000$) index. We derived the $M_\star-\mathrm{SFR}$ relation for 98 star-forming galaxies (SFGs), finding 34.7% exhibit suppressed SFRs in the cluster, compared to 11.0% in the field. While the SFRs show no significant variation with local density, the fraction of SFGs is 1.55 times higher in the cluster outskirts than in intermediate-density regions. The specific SFR decreases strongly with $D4000$ for active SFGs but remains constant for suppressed galaxies. The fraction of suppressed galaxies in the infall region is 2.6 times higher than in the core, especially in the infalling structure B of the cluster. The cluster's total mass does not appear to be a key factor in SFG quenching. Star formation in Cl0024 galaxies is suppressed by the dense cluster environment. This suppression is evident in SFG fractions and parameters tracing long-term evolution, indicating prolonged quenching. The SFGs preferentially reside in low-density regions, while suppressed galaxies dominate the infall region, supporting a 'delayed-then-rapid' quenching scenario.

 - **Abstract**
 Every large galaxy has a black hole in its center. The interaction between the black hole and their host profoundly shapes galactic evolution and the Universe as a whole. The key feature of this interaction are black hole jets - or more generally winds - which every black hole must have. Despite our Galaxy's central black hole, Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), proximity and importance, the active wind from it has eluded scientists for over half a century. Here we report the discovery of a large active wind from Sgr A* using unprecedentedly deep observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA). We detect a large conical clearing in the cold molecular gas surrounding Sgr A* that is at least 1 parsec in length and has a 45-degree opening angle. The morphology and energetics of this structure are consistent with active clearing by a hot wind from Sgr A*. This finding resolves the long-standing mystery of the missing wind from Sgr A*, and delivers the most detailed look yet of black hole feeding and feedback processes in our Galactic center.
#### Radiation GRMHD Models of Accretion onto Stellar-Mass Black Holes: II. Super-Eddington Accretion

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive analysis of super-Eddington black hole accretion simulations that solve the GRMHD equations coupled with angle-discretized radiation transport. The simulations span a range of accretion rates, two black hole spins, and two magnetic field topologies, and include resolution studies as well as comparisons with non-radiative models. Super-Eddington accretion flows consistently develop geometrically thick disks supported by radiation pressure, regardless of magnetic field configuration. Radiation generated in the inner disk drives substantial outflows, forming conical funnel regions that limit photon escape and result in very low radiation efficiency. The accretion flows are highly turbulent with thermal energy transport dominated by radiation advection rather than diffusion. Angular momentum is primarily carried outward by Maxwell stress, with turbulent Reynolds stress playing a subdominant role. Both strong and weak jets are produced. Strong jets arise from sufficient net vertical magnetic flux and rapid black hole spin and can effectively evacuate the funnel, enabling radiation to escape through strong geometric beaming. In contrast, weak jets fail to clear the funnel, which becomes obscured by radiation-driven outflows and leads to distinct observational signatures. Spiral structures are observed in the plunging region, behaving like density waves. These super-Eddington models are applicable to a variety of astronomical systems, including ultraluminous X-ray sources, little red dots, and black hole transients.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the possible identification of the optical counterpart of the Rapid Burster MXB 1730-335 in the stellar system Liller 1. The identification was performed by taking advantage of a set of images acquired with the Hubble Space Telescope/Advanced Camera for Surveys in the optical band, and with the Gemini South Telescope in the near-infrared. The analysis of these images revealed the presence of a star with a position possibly compatible with the X-ray and radio band coordinates of the Rapid Burster, and showing significant optical variability. According to its location in the color-magnitude diagram, the candidate companion appears to belong to the young (~ 1-2 Gyr old) super-solar metallicity ([M/H]= +0.3) sub-population recently discovered in Liller 1. We discuss the main characteristics of the candidate counterpart and the Rapid Burster binary system as derived from the available data, also highlighting the need for further coordinated observations to solidly confirm their association and better clarify their physical properties.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent results from the James Webb Space Telescope show that nearby spiral galaxies are dominated by the presence of H I and H II bubbles that strongly shape their surrounding medium. These bubbles result from the feedback of high-mass stars at different stages of their life cycle. However, early (pre-supernova) feedback from high-mass stars is still poorly quantified. Recent results from numerical simulations suggest that the impact of high-mass star early feedback (photoionization, wind) on star formation properties is complex, time-dependent, and strongly depends on physical conditions, including the magnetic field properties. In our Galaxy, ionized (H II) regions observed in different evolution stages show a high diversity of star formation in their associated photo-dissociation regions (PDRs). However, the way in which the low- to high-density interstellar medium evolves to this situation remains elusive. Quantifying the impact of early feedback from high-mass stars on star formation properties and star formation laws (star formation rate, star formation efficiency versus gas surface density, {\Sigma}gas) will allow for a better understanding of the evolution of star formation laws in external galaxies, the laws that are key ingredients of galaxy evolution models. PRIMA, with its high sensitivity, large mapping efficiency, and polarimetric capabilities, offers a unique opportunity to address the way radiative feedback and magnetic field control star formation in the Milky Way.

 - **Abstract**
 Microlensing is one of the most powerful tools for probing the nature of dark halo objects and the sources they lens. As our nearest massive galaxy, M31 provides a rich source population with many potential lenses in its halo crossing our field of view at any one time. In this paper we explore the probability that X-ray sources in M31 will be lensed by white dwarfs in M31's halo. We find an expected lensing rate of 2.6/year within the mean archival Swift XRT field-of-view, and 6.3/year for the whole galaxy. For X-ray emitting sources harboring accreting neutron stars and black holes, we find that microlensing offers a unique opportunity to constrain the properties of the inner accretion flow. Our results demonstrate that it is feasible to recover both the spin of the black hole and the temperature profile of the accretion disk by discerning their effects upon the profile of the microlensing magnification. We show that these parameters have a significant effect on the shape of the light curve, with the effect of spin being more pronounced at smaller impact parameters and higher energies, while the effect of the temperature profile is larger at lower energies and larger impact parameters. This suggests that multi-band observations of a single lensing event could be used to robustly constrain both parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 Identifying solar active regions (ARs), which consist of one or more pairs of magnetic patches with opposite polarities, is essential due to their significant role in dynamic solar atmospheric phenomena. In this study, we analyze ARs during their emergence and evolution on the solar surface using a complex network-based method known as Identifying Solar Magnetic Patches (ISMP). To examine the magnetic characteristics, we selected a subregion of 125 $\times$ 125 pixels centered on AR NOAA No., 1158, observed in 2011. Line-of-sight magnetogram data were obtained from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). Our statistical analysis reveals that the distributions of patch area, lifetime, and magnetic flux follow power-law behavior, with exponents approximately equal to $\alpha$ = 2.14, 2.5, and 1.42, respectively. Furthermore, a Hurst exponent of 0.57 indicates the presence of long-range temporal correlations in the emergence of new magnetic patches.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have revealed massive, evolved galaxies only a few hundred million years after the Big Bang, challenging standard cosmological models. To test the hypothesis that the Galactic nucleus may act as a source of matter and energy capable of accelerating galaxy formation, we examined whether the Milky Way itself shows signs of central activity. Expansion of the Galactic center would imply such activity in its nuclear region. To investigate this possibility, we analyzed stellar motions along the south north axis of the Galaxy using Gaia DR3 data. Average Galactocentric radial velocities were computed in 50 control points, spaced by 0.1 kpc with a sampling radius of 0.05 kpc, up to 5 kpc from the Galactic center. The results show a strong symmetry: in the northern region, 36 of 50 points have positive velocities, with an average of 19.15 +/- 10.80 km/s (N = 50), while in the southern region, 37 of 50 points have negative velocities, with an average of - 19.24 +/- 8.22 km/s (N = 50). A Students t test confirms that the two distributions differ significantly (0.003). The combination of positive average velocities in the north and negative average velocities in the south indicates a symmetric outflow of stars away from the Galactic center, consistent with expansion in its central region. These Galactocentric radial velocities are consistent with the formation of massive, evolved galaxies within 300 My, as observed by JWST. If extended to other galaxies, the results (together with earlier findings on globular cluster motions) suggest that aspects of standard galaxy formation models may require refinement. This interpretation, however, remains preliminary and requires further study.
#### Mitigating Random-Phase Sampling Noise in the Cepheid Period-Luminosity Relation: A Cross-Filter Consistency Approach

 - **Abstract**
 The Period-Luminosity (PL) relation is usually derived using time-averaged magnitudes, which require multiple-epoch observations to determine periods and adequately sample the light curves. Although single-epoch observations are more practical and require significantly less observational effort, they inherently introduce greater photometric scatter, leading to an increased dispersion in the derived Period-Luminosity relations. In this paper, we explore, in detail, a method that transforms single random-phase data to their mean-light values, using information obtained in other bands for the same Cepheid. This approach enables the accurate re-construction of mean-light PL relations for wavelengths observed with space-based facilities, for instance, where the number of epochs per star makes simple averaging or template fitting less than optimal, with the latter requiring very high-precision periods for predictive phasing. While applying this technique across multiple bands, from optical to mid-IR, we focus particularly on widely separated bands covering the mid-IR to the optical. We showcase this method using the J band (as being observed by JWST) as the random-phase component. Our results show that this correction reduces the scatter of the PL relation in the J band by a factor of approximately $0.7\times$, equivalent to increasing the number of random-phase observations by a factor of 10, needed to obtain the same increase in precision as delivered here.
#### New constraint on Europa's ice shell: magnetic signature from the ocean

 - **Abstract**
 Jupiter's icy moons are believed to host subsurface liquid oceans, and among them, Europa stands out as one of the most promising candidates for extraterrestrial life. Yet, the processes driving oceanic flows beneath its ice shell, as well as the factors controlling the thickness of this ice, remain incompletely understood. One especially distinctive feature of Europa is that its salty ocean is electrically conducting and thus influenced by Jupiter's time-varying magnetic field, which is believed to drive a large-scale zonal flow. Here, we examine hos this magnetically-induced jet affects both the heat flux and the dynamics of the convective flow within Europa's ocean. We first show that the magnetically-driven jet efficiently transports heat in stably stratified regions near the top of the ocean, and may alter the expected convective scaling laws in deeper layers. Second, by analysing the latitudinal distribution of heat flux and relating it to ice-thickness variations, we make predictions that can be compared with current observations. In anticipation of the upcoming JUICE and Europa Clipper missions, we discuss how improved measurement precision could help further constrain the ocean's properties and refine our model-based forecasts.
#### JWST/NIRCam imaging of the Bipolar Planetary Nebula NGC 6537: the (Infra)red Spider, Revealed

 - **Abstract**
 We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) near-infrared (NIRCam) Br$\alpha$, H$_2$, [Fe II], and PAH imaging of the molecule-rich, high-excitation bipolar planetary nebula (PN) NGC 6537 (the Red Spider), complemented by new ALMA and Chandra observations and archival HST images. The resulting multiwavelength view of the Red Spider establishes the detailed lobe/torus structure of the nebula and the mass-loss history of its progenitor star. The extinction-penetrating JWST/NIRCam Br$\alpha$ and PAH and ALMA 3 mm continuum imaging exposes the complexity of the ionized inner nebula. JWST/NIRCam H$_2$ imaging traces the full, $\sim$1.1 pc extent of the bubble-like lobes formed by fast ($\sim$300-400 km s$^{-1}$) polar outflows, while ALMA $^{13}$CO(1-0) mapping reveals a point-symmetric, slowly ($\sim$10 km s$^{-1}$) expanding equatorial torus of radius $\sim$0.13 pc. In striking contrast, the [Fe II] image displays an extended S-shaped emission morphology that traces collisions between an active, collimated wind and slower-moving material along the lobe rims. No X-rays are detected from the nebula or its central star in deep Chandra/HRC-I imaging. However, the combined HST and JWST imaging reveals a near-IR excess at the central star indicative of emission from hot ($\sim$1000 K) circumstellar dust. We propose that interactions between the nebular progenitor star and a close companion are responsible for the ejection of NGC 6537's molecular torus, the formation of a circumbinary dust disk, and the launching of fast, wandering, collimated outflows that have inflated the polar lobe bubbles traced by near-IR H$_2$ emission and are presently generating the [Fe II]-emitting shocks.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the impact of dust shielding on Lyman-Werner (LW) radiation fields and its implications for supermassive black hole (SMBH) seed formation at high redshift. Using an updated version of the GAMETE/QSOdust semi-analytical model, we implement a simple dust shielding prescription that accounts for the absorption of LW photons by dust grains. We find that even modest dust enrichment can significantly reduce the effective LW radiation field, allowing H2 cooling to persist in regions previously thought to be affected by LW feedback. This changes the conditions for seed formation, particularly for heavy seeds which require suppression of H2 cooling. Our results suggest that dust shielding extends the redshift range and volume where heavy seeds can form, and significantly alters the relative importance of different seed populations. We discuss the implications for the formation of high-redshift SMBHs and future observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. There remains much mystery about how or if wave-energy in the photosphere can be transferred sufficiently upwards through the solar atmosphere to contribute to coronal heating. In light of a plethora of theoretical and idealised studies, we must complement our understanding with realistic and self-driven simulations in order to confidently quantify such contributions. Aims. In this study we aim to connect the various environments from the photosphere to low corona and identify wave drivers, transitions and dissipation mechanisms. We will analyse the effects of the presence of twisted magnetic features and vortical flows on the transport of such wave modes as the structures evolve. Methods. We adopt the most significant frequency (MSF) decomposition method to trace wave activity through a 3D realistic quiet Sun simulation. We focus on vertical and temporal evolution, identifying wave sources and shifts in the dominant modes. Results. We identify two frequencies, at 3.5 and 5 mHz, that connect oscillations in the upper convection zone to the dynamics in the solar atmosphere. We see distinct differences in the absence and presence of swirling structures on the upwards propagation of these oscillations. Furthermore, we validate the use of the highest frequency MSFs as a proxy for the location of shocks in the chromosphere, and use the results to understand the connection between shocks and the propagation of oscillations in the upper atmosphere. We discuss the relation of energy transfer via shocks, mode conversion, and jets. Finally, we find the contribution of 3.5 and 5 mHz signals to the overall wave power in the domain to be significant, up to 50%.

 - **Abstract**
 An increasing number of ambiguous nuclear transients, including some extreme nuclear transients, have been reported, which cannot be simply explained by the tidal disruption event (TDE) due to their high energy and/or overmassive black holes. Stars that form in or are captured by AGN disks will grow and migrate inward, potentially exploding as supernovae once the inner cold accretion disk disappears during the phase of AGN decay. We propose that tidal disruption of a supernova (TDS) by a supermassive black hole (SMBH) can produce nuclear transients that are even more luminous than typical TDEs and are not limited by the SMBH mass. In this scenario, the SMBH can capture the supernova ejecta, which subsequently self-intersects and circularizes into an accretion disk. Based on hydrodynamical simulations, we find that the accretion rate of the TDS disk exhibits a slow decline that can last for months to decades. The peak accretion rate of a typical core-collapse SN scenario can exceed the Eddington limit for SMBHs with $M_{\rm BH} \lesssim 10^{7.5}\,M_\odot$, while it remains sub-Eddington for more massive SMBHs. This model provides a mechanism for triggering an energetic TDE-like flare with luminosity \(\gtrsim10^{45}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}\) in galaxies with $M_{\rm BH}\gtrsim10^{8}\,M_\odot$ or triggering turn-on changing-look AGNs.

 - **Abstract**
 It is commonly supposed that quenched field dwarfs near the edge of the Local Group (LG) are backsplash galaxies, having previously orbited within the Milky Way (MW) or M31's virial radius, whereas galaxies on first infall should still have gas and star formation. We measured proper motions (PMs) for six dwarf galaxies located 400-1000 kpc from the MW using the Hubble Space Telescope. For four galaxies (Aquarius, Cetus, Pisces, Tucana), we report the first PMs. For the remaining two (Leo T and Pegasus), we measure PMs with order-of-magnitude improvement. We compute orbital histories to assess whether any of the six are backsplash galaxies. While some have non-zero likelihoods of past interaction with the MW or M31, these are weak and typically occur at large distances (e.g., $>$ 2Rvir). The properties of Aquarius, Leo T, Pisces, and Pegasus are consistent with first passage through a massive halo. Cetus, which shows a low probability (~4-6%) of interacting with the MW or M31 in the last 6 Gyr, is more likely a backsplash galaxy resulting from an interaction with M31 over 6 Gyr ago, in the same regime where rigid orbital models become less reliable. Tucana has been thought to be a backsplash galaxy, but our orbits indicate it cannot have interacted with a massive LG host. Our results highlight the diversity of evolutionary pathways for isolated, intermediate-mass dwarfs ($M_* \approx 10^5-10^7 M_{\odot}$) and the need to reassess quenching mechanisms beyond environmental interactions with massive hosts.

 - **Abstract**
 The magnetic breakout model explains a variety of solar eruptions, ranging from small-scale jets to large-scale coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Most of our previous studies are focused on jets and CMEs in single null-point topologies. Here, we investigate the initiation of CMEs and associated particle acceleration in a double null-point (or nested fan-spine) topology during multiple homologous M- and X-class flares from an active region. The initiation of the flare and associated eruption begins with inflow structures moving towards the inner null of the closed fan-spine topology. The first explosive breakout reconnection of the flux rope at the inner null produced a circular and remote ribbons along with successful eruption of the flux rope and associated fast EUV (shock) wave. Simultaneous flare reconnection beneath the erupting flux rope produced a typical two-ribbon flare along with two hard X-ray footpoint sources. When the flux rope (with shock) reaches the outer null, the second explosive breakout reconnection produces another large-scale remote ribbon. The radio observations reveal quasiperiodic Type III bursts (period=100-s) and a Type II burst during the breakout reconnection near the inner and outer nulls, along with gradual solar energetic particles (SEPs) observed at 1 AU for magnetically connected events. This study highlight the importance of two successive breakout reconnection in the initiation of CMEs in nested-null topologies and associated particle acceleration/release into the interplanetary medium. The particles are accelerated by the shock ahead of the flux rope, which formed during the inner breakout reconnection. These findings have significant implications for particle acceleration and escape processes in multi-scale null-point topologies that produce jets and CMEs.

 - **Abstract**
 Erupting flux ropes play crucial role in powering a wide range of solar transients, including flares, jets, and coronal mass ejections. These events are driven by the release of stored magnetic energy, facilitated by the shear in the complex magnetic topologies. However, the mechanisms governing the formation and eruption of flux ropes, particularly the role of magnetic shear distribution in coronal arcades are not fully understood. We employ magnetohydrodynamic simulations incorporating nonadiabatic effects of optically thin radiative losses, magnetic field-aligned thermal conduction, and spatially varying (steady) background heating, to realistically model the coronal environment. A stratified solar atmosphere under gravity is initialized with a non-force-free field comprising sheared arcades. We study two different cases by varying the initial shear to analyze their resulting dynamics, and the possibility of flux rope formation and eruptions. Our results show that strong initial magnetic shear leads to spontaneous flux rope formation and eruption via magnetic reconnection, driven by Lorentz force. The shear distribution infers the non-potentiality distributed along arcades and demonstrates its relevance in identifying sites prone to eruptive activity. The evolution of mean shear and the relative strength between guide to reconnection fields during the pre- and post-eruption phases are explored, with implications of bulk heating for the ``hot onset'' phenomena in flares, and particle acceleration. On the other hand, the weaker shear case does not lead to formation of any flux ropes. Our findings highlight the limitations of relying solely on foot point shear and underscore the need for coronal scale diagnostics. These results are relevant for understanding eruptive onset conditions and can promote a better interpretation of coronal observations from current and future missions.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of a dense molecular ring-like structure in a dense (10$^5$ cm$^{-3}$), cold (pc-scale CO depletion at a factor of 5), and young (10$^4$ year) star-forming region G34.74-0.12, revealed by C$^{18}$O (2-1), HNC (1-0), and N$_2$H$^+$ (1-0) observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The ring-like structure is redshifted with respect to the clump, spanning from $V_{\rm sys,lsr} + 0.9$ to $V_{\rm sys,lsr} + 2.9$ km s$^{-1}$, with a total mass of 109 $M_{\odot}$. It is spatially coincident with 1.3 mm and 3.0 mm dust continuum emission from cores, and several protostellar outflows. However, no free-free emission or H\textsc{ii} region is detected in association with this structure. With a slow expansion speed indicated by the position-velocity diagram, this ring structure differs from rings previously identified in more evolved star-forming regions. Possible explanations for the ring-like structure include a relic wind-blown bubble produced by a deeply embedded young stellar object, a hollow cavity formed by cloud-cloud interactions, a gas ring resulting from a temperature gradient, or a line-of-sight superposition of multiple outflows or dense clouds. This discovery offers a rare observational glimpse into the earliest dynamical processes involved in massive star formation.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigated microlensing events detected by the OGLE and KMTNet surveys during the 2024 observing season, focusing on those that exhibit very complex anomaly features. Through this analysis, we found that the light curves of three events including OGLE-2024-BLG-0657, KMT-2024-BLG-2017, and KMT-2024-BLG-2480 cannot be readily interpreted using standard three-body lensing models such as a binary lens with a single source (2L1S) or a single lens with a binary source (1L2S). In this work we present detailed analyses of these events to uncover the nature of their anomalous features. An initial analysis using 2L1S modeling of the light curves showed that while it was difficult to simultaneously explain all of the multiple anomaly features, the main anomaly feature could be accounted for. Based on this model, we conducted four-body modeling that includes an additional lens or source. Through this approach, we found that the complex anomalies observed in the three events could be explained by a 2L2S model, in which both the lens and the source are binaries. Analysis of the color and magnitude revealed that the source is a binary system consisting of G- and K-type main sequence stars for OGLE-2024-BLG-0657, two K-type main sequence stars for KMT-2024-BLG-2017, and a K-type star with an early G-type main sequence companion for KMT-2024-BLG-2480. A Bayesian analysis incorporating constraints from the lensing observables indicates that the lenses in KMT-2024-BLG-2017 and KMT-2024-BLG-2480 are likely binary systems of low-mass stars located in the Galactic bulge, whereas the lens system OGLE-2024-BLG-0657L is likely a binary composed of two stellar remnants situated in the Galactic disk.

 - **Abstract**
 Scaling relations between galactic parameters represent key pieces of evidence for investigating the processes of galaxy formation and evolution. In most studies, these relations have been obtained for large portions of the galaxies (i.e., on kpc scales), but it is also important to evaluate these relations in smaller scales. In this work, we used optical data cubes of a subsample of nearby galaxies of the DIVING 3D survey. These allowed us to analyze the scaling relations involving stellar velocity dispersion, stellar population age, and stellar population metallicity at the nuclear and circumnuclear regions of galaxies. We detected correlations between the stellar velocity dispersion and the age, metallicity, and total stellar mass. These correlations are independent of galaxy inclinations, considering all morphological types, nuclear activity, and the presence or absence of galactic bars. We detected, for the first time, a correlation between the stellar velocity dispersion and stellar metallicity in the nuclear regions of galaxies. It is found to be qualitatively consistent with the well-known stellar mass-metallicity relation. We also noted that barred galaxies tend to show younger and less metal-rich stellar populations than unbarred galaxies in the central regions, which may be a consequence of the bar triggering star formation in the nuclear regions of these objects. Some active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in our sample are positioned above the observed correlation between stellar velocity dispersion and stellar population age, suggesting that their nuclear stellar populations are younger than expected. This may be a consequence of positive AGN feedback, triggering star formation. Conversely, starburst galaxies do not show nuclear stellar populations at ages over one billion years.

 - **Abstract**
 The combination of ALMA submillimeter and JWST/MIRI mid-infrared observations offers a transformative view of protostellar jets and outflows by probing cold and warm gas components across diverse physical conditions. We present a detailed comparison of gas distribution in these regimes for the jet/outflow system associated with G205.46$-$14.56S3 (HOPS 315), focusing on the inner $\sim$800 AU along the jet. ALMA CO and SiO trace both lobes of the bipolar jet, revealing high-velocity collimated jets and wider outflow components. JWST/MIRI detects mainly the blueshifted lobe; the redshifted side is likely obscured by strong mid-infrared extinction. Shorter-wavelength MIRI H$_2$ rotational lines (S(7)-S(4)) trace compact jet structures resembling SiO emission, while longer-wavelength lines (S(3)-S(1)) reveal more extended emission akin to low-velocity CO. From H$_2$ rotational emission, we identify two molecular gas temperature components: warm $(\sim 773 \pm 44 K)$ and hot $(\sim 2499\pm720 K)$. Using the ortho-to-para ratio, we estimate visual extinction $A_V \approx 23.3 \pm 2.5$ mag. JWST/MIRI emission imply a jet mass-loss rate of $\dot{M}_{J, blue, jwst} \approx (0.27 \pm 0.1) \times 10^{-6}M_\odot {yr}^{-1}$. The combination of ALMA and JWST reveals stratified layers within the outflow and jet, as well as shock structures, providing a comprehensive view of their physical conditions. This multiwavelength study demonstrates that combining submillimeter observations from ALMA with infrared data from JWST is crucial for uncovering the full physical and chemical structure of protostellar jets and outflows.

 - **Abstract**
 Decades of observations on the star V Canum Venaticorum (V CVn) have revealed an unusual inverse relationship between its linear polarization and light curves (sometimes with a lead/lag time between them) and an almost constant polarization position angle. One theory proposed to explain this behaviour is the existence of a bow shock driven by a spherically symmetric time-varying dusty wind from the star, which is assumed to vary due to radial pulsations. To test this hypothesis, this study uses a new framework developed in \textsc{ZEUS3D}, a multiphysics magnetohydrodynamics code. The results of this work show that when a time-varying stellar wind is at its maximum brightness, the polarization signal is at a minimum due to the wind structure and a dense, symmetric shell that forms around the star. Conversely, when the brightness is at a minimum, the symmetric shell around the star is much less dense, and the polarization is instead dominated by the asymmetric bow shock structure, causing the polarization signal to attain a maximum value. Numerically reproducing the observed inverse relationship between the polarization and light curve provides a strong theoretical argument that a variable stellar wind bow shock is the solution to the curious case of V CVn.

 - **Abstract**
 It is anticipated that mass accretion rates exceeding approximately $10^{19}\,{\rm g\,s^{-1}}$ in X-ray pulsars lead to radiation-driven outflows from super-critical accretion discs. The outflows launched from the disc influence the angular distribution of X-ray radiation, resulting in geometrical beaming. The beaming, in turn, impacts the apparent luminosity of the X-ray pulsar, detectability of pulsations, and the spectral composition of the X-ray flux. We employ a straightforward geometrical model of the outflows, perform Monte Carlo simulations, and model the spectra of radiation, reprocessed by the walls of the accretion cavity formed by the outflows. We consider the reprocessed emission only; direct pulsar emission is not included in our modelling. Our results demonstrate that the spectra of reprocessed radiation depend on the actual luminosity of the central engine, the geometry of the outflows, and the viewing angle - most notably on the latter, through changing visibility of the hotter wall regions near the disc plane. The high-energy part of the reprocessed spectrum depends strongly on viewing angle (harder at lower inclinations), while the soft flux varies comparatively little with inclination. In our model, this contrast is a prediction: variable ultra-luminous X-ray sources are expected to exhibit strong high-energy angle sensitivity together with comparatively modest soft-band variation, naturally arising if precession modulates the effective inclination.

 The solar wind originates from regions of open magnetic fields on the Sun, but the relevant processes remain unsolved. We present a self-consistent numerical model of the source region of the wind, in which jets similar to those observed on the Sun naturally emerge due to magnetic reconnection between closed and open magnetic fields. In this process material is transferred from closed to open field lines and fed into the solar this http URL quantify the mass flux through the magnetic field connected to the heliosphere and find that it greatly exceeds the amount required to sustain the wind. This supports a decades-old suspicion based on spectroscopic observations and shows that magnetic reconnection in the low solar atmosphere could sustain the solar wind.

 Self-lensing (SL) in binary systems has the potential to provide a unique observational window into the Galactic population of compact objects. Using the $\mathtt{startrack}$ and COSMIC population synthesis codes, we investigate how different supernova mechanisms affect the observable population of SL systems, with particular attention to the mass gap (2$\mathrm{-}$5 M$_\odot$) in compact object distributions. We test three supernova remnant formation models with different convective growth timescales ($f_{\rm mix}$ = 0.5, 1.0, and 4.0), simulating SL binary systems across the Galactic disk and bulge. We identify distinct groupings of SL sources based on lens mass and Einstein crossing time, clearly differentiating neutron star from black hole systems and close from wide orbits. Notably, the delayed $f_{\rm mix} = 0.5$ model predicts a significantly higher fraction of systems with lens masses in the mass gap region (up to $\sim10$ times more for certain surveys), suggesting that SL observations could help constrain this controversial population. Our analysis reveals a strong preference for systems with low centre-of-mass velocities ($v_{\rm cm}\leq20$ km/s) across all models, resulting primarily from physical processes governing compact object formation and binary survival. While many potential detections will have limited observational coverage, ZTF is predicted to yield several dozen well-covered systems that should enable detailed characterization. When applying simple detection criteria including photometric precision and signal-to-noise requirements, predicted rates decrease by approximately two orders of magnitude, but still yield up to a few tens of expected detections for LSST and ZTF in the Galactic disk population.

 - **Abstract**
 High-density molecular gas plays a vital role in supporting star formation within galaxies. However, traditional tracers of dense gas, such as the low-$J$ transitions of HCN and HCO$^+$, are predominantly optically thick. This characteristic presents a significant challenge in accurately estimating the column density of dense gas and mapping its spatial distribution. Optically-thin tracers, including HC$_3$N (10-9) and isotopologues of HCN, HCO$^+$, HNC (1-0), among others, emerge as better tracers, by enabling more precise measurements and analyses of the dense gas in galaxies. Here, we present the first high-resolution ($\sim$3.8$''$, corresponding to $\sim$65 pc) molecular line observations of the nearby starburst galaxy M~82 with IRAM Northern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA). Notably, HC$_3$N (10-9) and H$^{13}$CN (1-0) emission lines are brighter at the northeast part (NE lobe) than those at the southwest part (SW lobe) of M~82, suggesting a higher accumulation of dense gas at the NE lobe. The spatial distributions of H41$\alpha$ and 3-mm continuum emission indicate that starburst activity varies across the central starburst disk, with more intense star formation occurring at the SW lobe compared to the NE lobe. The average optical depths of HCN and HCO$^+$ (1-0) across the triple-peaked regions exhibit significant variation, with the highest values observed at the NE lobe. Our results suggest a potential evolutionary sequence in M~82, where the distributions of star formation and dense gas appear to be partially decoupled -- a phenomenon that classical dense gas tracers cannot adequately probe.

 - **Abstract**
 We report JWST NIRCAM and MIRI observations of Sgr B2, the most active site of star formation in the Galaxy. These observations, using 14 filters spanning 1.5 to 25 microns, have revealed a multilayered and highly structured cloud that contains both a revealed, low-extinction and hidden, high-extinction population of massive stars. JWST has detected new candidate HII regions around massive stars previously missed by radio telescopes. MIRI has detected radiation escaping from the forming massive cluster Sgr B2 N along its outflow cavities, demonstrating that infrared radiation finds geometric escape routes even in the densest, most heavily embedded regions in the universe. JWST further highlights the gas asymmetry in the cloud, showing a sharp, straight cutoff along the eastern cloud edge. Despite the great sensitivity of these observations, no extended population of YSOs has been detected, placing a limit on their minimum extinction; this result hints that star formation has only just begun in the cloud. Together, these results suggest that, despite already holding the crown for most actively star-forming cloud, we have underestimated the total star formation in Sgr B2. JWST unveils previously hidden massive stars and ionized structures, offering a transformative view of how stars form under some of the most extreme Galactic conditions.

 - **Abstract**
 The physics-determined broadband spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of blazars have been widely used to study the property during their flaring/outburst states, while the non-flaring state takes up most of their lifetime and the general property of blazars has been barely discussed. In this work, for the first time, we used the archival data and employed the physics-determined SED processing method to form approximately average-state SEDs for 513 \textit{Fermi} bright BL Lacs. In general, we found that the magnetic field ($B$) is weaker than those obtained for flaring/outburst state by nearly one order of magnitude, and the dissipation region size ($R$) is larger than those obtained for flaring/outburst state, suggesting that the dissipation region could be more extend and less magnetized. A correlation between the synchrotron-self Compton (SSC) peak frequency ($\log \nu_{\rm ssc}$) against the synchrotron peak frequency ($\log \nu_{\rm sy}$) suggest that the inverse Compton scattering of HBLs suffer a significant Klein-Nishina (KN) suppression, we quantified the condition of KN suppression by determining the critical synchrotron peak frequency ($\nu_{\rm sy}^{\rm c}$) and found 359 out of 513 sources in our sample suffer KN suppression. Furthermore, our analysis of the relationship between synchrotron curvature ($1/b_{\rm sy}$) and $\log \nu_{\rm sy}$ indicates that the energy-dependent probability acceleration (EDPA) mechanism may dominate the particle acceleration in BL Lac jets.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed investigation of the temporal and spectral evolution of the emission from the blazar PKS 2155-304, a high-synchrotron-peaked (HSP) blazar. Using $\gamma$-ray, X-ray, optical/UV, and infrared data assembled from the Markarian Multiwavelength Data Center, we constructed multi-band light curves and temporally resolved spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of PKS 2155-304 to probe the origin of its emission. The light curves show significant variability, with fractional variability peaking at 0.75 in X-rays, 0.4 in the optical/UV, and 0.65 in $\gamma$-ray band-consistent with expectations for HSPs. Segmenting the $\gamma$-ray light curve with Bayesian blocks, we defined 253 time-resolved epochs with adequate multi-band coverage and categorized them into quiescent states (QS), multiwavelength flares (MWF), $\gamma$-ray flares ($\gamma$F), X-ray flares (XF), and optical/UV flares (OUF). Each SED is modeled within a synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) framework that self-consistently evolves particle injection and cooling; a neural-network surrogate is used to accelerate parameter inference. Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests reveal state-dependent parameter variations relative to QS: (i) during MWF, the magnetic field B, electron luminosity $L_{e}$, maximum electron Lorentz factor $\gamma_{max}$, and Doppler factor $\delta$ differ significantly; (ii) during $\gamma$F, a harder electron index p is estimated; (iii) XF shows higher B and $\gamma_{max}$ with a more compact emitting region; and (IV) during OUF, changes in B, $L_{e}$, $\gamma_{max}$, $\delta$, and p are found while the emitting-zone size remains approximately constant. The jet power is electron-dominated (magnetic-to-electron power ratio $\eta_{B}\simeq0.09-0.17$), with $\eta_{B}$ rising during XF. These results suggest that variations in acceleration efficiency and magnetization drive band-dependent flaring in PKS 2155-304.

 - **Abstract**
 The intensity and energy spectrum of energetic charged radiation in the heliosphere are significantly influenced by solar activity. This phenomenon is known as solar modulation of galactic cosmic rays. As interplanetary travel becomes a reality, missions in low Earth orbit become longer and more frequent. In low Earth orbit we need to estimate the influence of Earth's magnetosphere accurately to assess the radiation hazard experienced by astronauts during space missions, there is an emergent need for accurately depicting the space radiation environment and predicting the cosmic-ray flux in the heliosphere. Here we present a new effective and predictive model of solar modulation which incorporates fundamental physics processes of particle transport such as diffusion, convection, and adiabatic cooling to compute the energy spectrum; and temporal evolution of cosmic radiation in the inner heliosphere. Empowered by this model and a time-dependent effective description of the geomagnetic field, we will show our estimates of the dose rates experienced by astronauts over time, as they orbit Earth onboard the International Space Station and while travelling through interplanetary space.

 - **Abstract**
 Millimeter-wave observations of pulsars, while crucial for understanding their emission mechanisms, remain scarce. We demonstrate that high-precision cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments like the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), though designed for cosmology, offer a unique capability for such time-domain science due to their high cadence and broad sky coverage in millimeter bands. While previous ACT searches have focused on transients lasting minutes or longer, we develop and validate analysis methods to search for periodic, millisecond-scale transients, a capability not typically associated with CMB experiments. We describe a phase-resolved mapmaking approach, which leverages the known periodicity of the signal to enhance sensitivity and offers advantages in diagnosing systematic errors. We also introduce a template-based fit to the raw data timestreams that independently validate our results. Applying these methods to estimate the millimeter flux of the Crab Pulsar (PSR B0531+21), we derive 95% confidence upper limits of 4.6 mJy, 4.4 mJy, and 20.7 mJy on the pulsar's period-averaged flux density at 96 GHz, 148 GHz, and 225 GHz, respectively. These constraints fill a gap in our knowledge of the Crab Pulsar's spectral energy distribution, suggesting that it does not significantly flatten or invert at millimeter wavelengths. This work demonstrates the potential for future searches of short-timescale astrophysical phenomena with the next-generation CMB experiments like the Simons Observatory.

 - **Abstract**
 The existence of intergalactic magnetic fields (IGMF) has so far not been established through observations. The IGMF is expected to be generated either via processes mainly connected to astrophysical processes or it could be a relic of phase transitions in the early universe. Upper bounds to the average field present are set via observations of Faraday rotation measure. Lower bounds have been derived from the non-detection of secondary gamma-rays possibly produced in electromagnetic cascades. We investigate the presence of IGMFs by studying the GeV gamma-ray emission from the nearby blazar Mkn~501 ($z=0.034$), searching for evidence of the extended halo expected to be observed around the point source. We analyse 14 years of data from Fermi-LAT and Swift-XRT/BAT to construct a time-average synchrotron-self Compton model for the TeV spectrum of Mkn~501. This injection spectrum is used to simulate the resulting cascade emission with the ELMAG code for different magnetic field and coherence length configurations. These templates are fit to the Fermi-LAT data to find a best-fitting model for the cascade emission. We find significant ($\ge 5 \sigma$ trial-corrected) evidence for extended secondary emission around Mkn~501, which is consistent with an IGMF with $B_\mathrm{rms}=1.5_{-0.6}^{+1.6}\times 10^{-15}~\mathrm{G}$ and a coherence length of $\ell_C=(10\pm 3)~\mathrm{kpc}$. The source needs to actively inject TeV gamma-rays for at least 45000 years to match the level of secondary emission. Our results indicate that the secondary gamma-rays are significantly present in the $\it{Fermi}$-LAT data. The effect of plasma-heating by pairs in the cascade appears to be negligible for Mkn 501. This is consistent with the observation that Mkn~501 is one of the objects with the lowest injection power among the blazars studied in the context of cascade emission.

 - **Abstract**
 The quiescent or dynamic nature of fine scale ray-like features in the sun corona, observed in visible light, is still an open question. Here, we show that most of daily and hourly periodic variations in visible light brightness of the high corona (up to 15 Rs) are aligned to the tip of streamers and are consistent with the periodicity of plasma release from simulations of tearing-induced magnetic reconnection at the heliospheric current sheet. The areas in which we detect periodicities can be used as tracers of non-quiescent fine coronal rays. This also allows their distinction from coronal rays more likely to be real quiescent features or associated with smaller and/or faster unresolved brightness variations. In the low- and middle-corona (down to 1.4 Rs) similar brightness variations are observed along loop-like and cusp-like features marking boundaries of streamers which then connect to radial features in the high corona. This suggests the presence of additional mechanisms in the low- and middle-corona periodically releasing density structures in the solar wind. The periodicity distributions show a solar cycle modulation with shorter periods (smaller structures) during solar maximum. Periodicities are observed within streamers during solar minimum, but are visible at all latitudes, even extending radially from the poles, during solar maximum.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate axion-like particles coupled to gravity through a parity-violating Chern-Simons (CS) interaction. In this framework, axion dark matter (DM) can decay into pairs of circularly polarized gravitons, producing a persistent, nearly monochromatic GW signal. We compute the expected signal at Earth assuming a Navarro-Frenk-White Galactic halo model with the corresponding velocity distribution, and compare it with the narrowband sensitivities of the LIGO O4 run and the projected reach of the Einstein Telescope. The resulting bounds on the axion-graviton coupling $\alpha$ improve upon the cosmological stability requirement for axion masses $m_\phi \lesssim 10^{-11}$ eV, excluding values up to four orders of magnitude below the stability limit. This constitutes a robust direct terrestrial constraint on the axion-gravity CS coupling. We also discuss distinctive observational signatures, such as circular polarization asymmetries, annual modulation, and potential enhancements from DM substructures, which could serve as smoking-gun evidence for parity-violating gravitational interactions.
#### A Study of Spectral Variability between flaring and non-flaring state in M74 X-1

 - **Abstract**
 We conducted an extensive long-term spectral and timing study of the ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) M74 X-1, using data taken between 2001 and 2021 by Chandra and XMM-Newton X-ray observatories. Our analysis shows that flares are present in some observations, whereas they are absent in others. Flaring state exhibits two-component spectra at a lower average flux level, whereas the non-flaring state displays single-component spectra at a higher average flux level. The M74 X-1 spectra are best described by the combination of accretion disk and Comptonization components, a dual thermal disk blackbody model, and a modified multi-temperature disk blackbody model. Using the dual thermal disk blackbody model, we obtain cool and hot temperatures of $T_{in}$ (cool) = $0.38^{+0.08}_{-0.06}$ keV and $T_{in}$ (hot) = $1.67^{+0.18}_{-0.13}$ keV, respectively, suggesting two temperature emitting regions and indicating possible presence of outflowing wind along with the accretion disk. We found a Gaussian feature at $E_{line}$ = $0.96^{+0.05}_{-0.11}$ keV with $\sigma$ = $0.11^{+0.13}_{-0.06}$ keV in the spectra of the flaring state which can be interpreted as the unresolved wind feature in the system when compared to similar feature seen in other ULXs. Plotting the hardness luminosity diagram, we get a trend of increasing hardness with luminosity, suggesting the presence of geometrical beaming in a low-inclination system. Additionally, using the hot disk blackbody component from the dual thermal disk blackbody model, we estimate the mass of the compact object to be M = $7.1^{+1.4}_{-1.3}$ M$_\odot$, classifying it as a stellar-mass black hole and confirming super-Eddington accretion in the system.

 - **Abstract**
 We characterize two candidate cool galactic outflows in two relatively low mass, highly inclined Virgo cluster galaxies: NGC4424 and NGC4694. Previous analyses of observations using the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) carbon monoxide (CO) line emission maps did not classify these sources as cool outflow hosts. Using new high sensitivity, high spatial resolution, JWST mid-infrared photometry in the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-tracing F770W band, we identify extended structures present off of the stellar disk. The identified structures are bright in the MIRI F770W and F2100W bands, suggesting they include PAHs as well as other dust grains. As PAHs have been shown to be destroyed in hot, ionized gas, these structures are likely to be outflows of cool (T$\leq 10^4$K) gas. This work represents an exciting possibility for using mid infrared observations to identify and measure outflows in lower mass, lower star formation galaxies.
#### Pressure Regulated Formation of Molecular Clouds and Stars: The case of the Milky Way

 - **Abstract**
 We present a steady-state analytical model for pressure-regulated formation of molecular clouds (MC) and stars (SF) in gaseous galactic disks and apply it to the Milky Way (MW). MC formation depends on midplane interstellar pressure $P_{\text{ISM}}$ and metallicity $Z$, and for galactocentric distances $R\gtrsim5$ kpc, $P_{\text{ISM}}(R)$ scales approximately linearly with molecular gas surface density $\Sigma_{\rm mol}(R)$. The molecularization of the cold neutral medium (CNM) is due to the opacity of small dust grains that protect the center of the cloud from dissociating radiation when the column density is $\Sigma_d\geq 5\ (Z/Z_\odot)M_\odot\text{ pc}^{-2}$. The H$_2$ formation rate per hydrogen atom is $F\sim10^{-15}(P_{\text{ISM}}/P_\odot)T_{100}^{-1/2}\text{s}^{-1}$, and the corresponding formation rate per unit area is $\dot{\Sigma}^{+}_{\rm mol}\sim 5\times10^{-2}\left(P_{\text{ISM}}/{P_\odot}\right)T_{100}^{-1/2}M_\odot~\text{kpc}^{-2}~\text{yr}^{-1}$, where $P_\odot$ is the pressure at the solar circle and $T_{100}=T/100\text{ K}$ is the temperature of the cloud. In equilibrium, this equals the molecular gas destruction rate $\dot{\Sigma}^{-}_{\rm mol}$ due to SF. Self-gravity sets in when the column density of a cloud reaches $\Sigma_{\rm sg}=\Sigma_{\rm sg,\odot}(P_{\text{ISM}}/P_\odot)^{1/2}$, with $\Sigma_{\rm sg,\odot}\sim30\ M_\odot\ \text{pc}^{-2}$. Given the distribution of $P_{\text{ISM}}(R)$ and $Z(R)$ in the MW, the SF process at $5\lesssim R\lesssim11$ kpc follows a two-step track: first, MCs form from CNM gas and then they form stars when self-gravity sets in. The resulting SFR surface density is $\Sigma_\text{SFR}(R)\approx (1.6-4)\times10^{-3}\left(P_{\text{ISM}}/P_\odot\right)\ \text{M}_\odot~\text {kpc}^{-2}\text{yr}^{-1}$ with an average final SF efficiency of $\epsilon_{\rm sf}\sim (3-8)\times 10^{-2}$.
#### Combining PIC and MHD to model particle acceleration in astrophysical shocks

 - **Abstract**
 When supersonic plasma flows collide, many physical processes contribute to the morphology of the resulting shock. One of these processes is the acceleration of non-thermal ions, which will, eventually, reach relativistic speeds and become cosmic rays. This process is difficult to simulate in a computer model because it requires both macro-physics (the overall shape of the shock) and micro-physics (the interaction between individual particles and the magnetic field). The combined PIC-MHD method is one of several options to get around this problem. It is based on the assumption that a plasma can be described as a combination of a thermal gas, which can be accurately described as a fluid using grid-based magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and a small non-thermal component which has to be described as individual particles using particle-in-cell (PIC). By combining aspects of both methods, we reduce the computational costs while maintaining the ability to trace the acceleration of individual particles. We apply this method to a variety of astrophysical shock configurations to investigate if, and how, they can contribute to the cosmic ray spectrum.
#### Negative gas-phase metallicity gradients in the narrow line region and galactic disc of local AGN-host galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 The gas-phase metallicity distribution in galaxies provides significant information on their evolution. We report the discovery of nega- tive radial gradients in the gas-phase metallicity of the narrow-line region of the nine galaxies in the Measuring Active Galactic Nuclei Under MUSE Microscope (MAGNUM) galaxies: Centaurus A, Circinus, IC 5063, NGC 1068, NGC 1365, NGC 1386, NGC 2992, NGC 4945, NGC 5643. From strong-line abundance relations for active galactic nuclei (AGN) and star-forming regions, along with emission-line ratio diagnostics, we determine spatially resolved gas-phase metallicities for the kinematic components, galaxy disc and outflow. These relations involve sensitive strong emission lines, specifically [O III]5007, [N II]6584, H{\alpha}, H\b{eta}, [S II]6716, and [S II]6731. The existence of predominantly negative radial metallicity gradients in these AGN host galaxies indicates that metals are not necessarily moved from the central regions to the outskirts by AGN activity and that the gas-phase metallicity in galaxies may follow the general inside-out star formation scenario.
#### A New Population of Point-like, Narrow-line Objects Revealed by the James Webb Space Telescope

 - **Abstract**
 We report a new population of objects discovered using the data from the James Webb Space Telescope, which are characterized by their point-like morphology and narrow permitted emission lines. Our sample includes nine objects found in three JWST wide survey fields, which have z=3.624 to 5.378 and M_B ~ -18.3 to -21.4 mag. Their light distributions follow gaussian profiles, with the full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) values only 3.7%--34.6% larger than those of the point spread functions. Their sharpest FWHM sizes correspond to only 0.49 to 0.96 kpc. They have very strong [O III] and Halpha lines (median rest-frame equivalent widths of 1610.6 and 1374.0 A, respectively), and the line widths of the latter are only 150--360 km/s. Due to the limitation of the current data, the exact nature of this new population is still uncertain. The emission line diagnostics shows that at least one object is consistent with being AGN. On the other hand, the spectral energy distributions of most of the nine objects can be fitted reasonably by normal galaxy templates, which suggest that they could also be very young (median age of 120 Myrs), star-forming (median star formation rate of 1.8 Msun/yr) galaxies in the early formation stage (having acquired a median stellar mass of only 10^{8.4} Msun). If they are indeed star-forming galaxies, their gas-phase metallicities range from 12+log(O/H) = 7.8 to 8.3. It will be critical to understand this population by deeper medium-resolution spectroscopy in the future. If they are AGNs, they constitute a new kind of type 2 AGNs that are low-luminosity and almost "hostless". If they are star-forming galaxies, they also constitute a new kind whose early formation is likely a secular process starting from a very compact core, which is in line with the picture of a monolithic collapse.
