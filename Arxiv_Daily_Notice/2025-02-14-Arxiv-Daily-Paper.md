 - **Abstract**
 The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission identified a potential 0.88 REarth planet with a period of 7.577 days, orbiting the nearby M1V star GJ 341 (TOI 741.01). This system has already been observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to search for presence of an atmosphere on this planet. Here, we present an in-depth analysis of the GJ 341 system using all available public data. We provide improved parameters for the host star, an updated value of the planet radius, and support the planetary nature of the object (now GJ 341 b). We use 57 HARPS radial velocities to model the magnetic cycle and activity of the host star, and constrain the mass of GJ 341 b to upper limits of 4.0 MEarth (3 sigma) and 2.9 MEarth (1 sigma). We also rule out the presence of additional companions with M sin i > 15.1 MEarth, and P < 1750 days, and the presence of contaminating background objects during the TESS and JWST observations. These results provide key information to aid the interpretation of the recent JWST atmospheric observations and other future observations of this planet.

 - **Abstract**
 JWST observations have uncovered a new population of red, compact objects at high redshifts dubbed 'Little Red Dots' (LRDs), which typically show broad emission lines and are thought to be dusty Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Some of their other features, however, challenge the AGN explanation, such as prominent Balmer breaks and extremely faint or even missing metal high-ionization lines, X-ray, or radio emission, including in deep stacks. Broad-line AGN are known to vary in time, which is why we take advantage of two years of available JWST observations of the multiply-imaged $z=7.045$ LRD A2744-QSO1, with lensing-induced time delays between the three images spanning 22 yr (2.7 yr in the rest-frame), to investigate its photometric and spectroscopic variability. We find the equivalent widths (EWs) of the broad H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ lines, which are independent of magnification and other systematics, to exhibit significant variations, up to $18\pm3$ % for H$\alpha$ and up to $22\pm8$ % in H$\beta$, on a timescale of 875 d (2.4 yr) in the rest-frame. This suggests that A2744-QSO1 is indeed an AGN. We find no significant photometric variability beyond the limiting systematic uncertainties, so it currently cannot be determined whether the EW variations are due to line-flux or continuum variability. These results are consistent with a typical damped random walk (DRW) variability model for an AGN like A2744-QSO1 ($M_{\mathrm{BH}}=4\times10^7 \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) given the sparse sampling of the light-curve with the available data. Our results therefore support the AGN interpretation of this LRD, and highlight the need for further photometric and spectroscopic monitoring in order to build a detailed and reliable light-curve.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, Freedman et al. (2024) report agreement of distances derived from the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) and the J-Region Asymptotic Giant Branch (JAGB) at the 1$\%$ level for both nearby galaxies with ground-based imaging (0.5-4 Mpc) as well distant galaxies with JWST imaging (7-23 Mpc). Here we compare the same ground-based JAGB distances to uniformly reduced space-based optical TRGB distances from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We uncover a significant offset between these two distance scales of $\Delta\mu$ = 0.17 $\pm$ 0.04 (stat) $\pm$ 0.06 (sys) mag (9$\%$ in distance), with the HST TRGB distances being further. Inspections of the HST color-magnitude diagrams make a compelling case that the issue lies in the underlying JAGB distances. The source of the disagreement may lie with the lower resolution or photometric calibration of the ground-based near-infrared data, a contrast to the general agreement found between JWST JAGB and other space-based, second-rung distance indicators (Cepheids, Miras, TRGB) presented within Riess et al. (2024). High-resolution, near-infrared observations from an ongoing HST program will enable the simultaneous measurement of Cepheid, JAGB, and TRGB distances in four of these nearby galaxies and allow us to investigate whether the discrepancy noted here is due to ground-based observational systematics, or something intrinsic to the JAGB method relevant for this particular sample. A resolution of this discrepancy is required if the JAGB is to be used to determine a highly precise local value of the Hubble constant.

 - **Abstract**
 We examine the detectability of $\gamma$-ray emission originating from the radioactive decays of unstable nuclei that are synthesized in relativistic outflows launched in magneto-rotational core-collapse supernovae. The observed lines have enhanced energies due to the Lorentz boosted nuclei and can also be seen until later times due to time dilation of the rest-frame half-lives. We find that instruments like $\textit{e-ASTROGAM}$ and $\textit{INTEGRAL/SPI}$ are sensitive to these boosted line emissions from 100s of keV to 10s of MeV at a distance of 10 kpc over time scales of 10s of days. For favorable viewing angles, these decays can be detected to extragalactic distances for rapidly spinning proto-magnetar models. On the other hand, detection for off-axis jets is challenging, even for a supernova at the galactic center. Measuring multiple decay lines in addition to the integrated luminosity over $\sim$10 days post-bounce would allow for the ability to distinguish between models and shed light on central engine properties like magnetic field and spin.

 - **Abstract**
 This study presents observations of a large pseudostreamer solar eruption and, in particular, the post-eruption relaxation phase, as captured by Metis onboard the Solar Orbiter on October 12, 2022, during its perihelion passage. Utilizing total brightness data, we observe the outward propagation of helical features up to 3 solar radii along a radial column that appears to correspond to the stalk of the pseudostreamer. The helical structures persisted for more than 3 hours following a jet-like coronal mass ejection associated with a polar crown prominence eruption. A notable trend is revealed: the inclination of these features decreases as their polar angle and height increase. Additionally, we measured their helix pitch. Despite a 2-minute time cadence limiting direct correspondence among filamentary structures in consecutive frames, we find that the Metis helical structure may be interpreted as a consequence of twist (nonlinear torsional Alfvén waves) and plasma liberated by interchange reconnection. A comparison was performed of the helix parameters as outlined by fine-scale outflow features with those obtained from synthetic white-light images derived from the high-resolution magnetohydrodynamics simulation of interchange reconnection in a pseudostreamer topology by Wyper et al. (2022). A remarkable similarity between the simulation-derived images and the observations was found. We conjecture that these Metis observations may represent the upper end in spatial and energy scale of the interchange reconnection process that has been proposed recently as the origin of the Alfvénic solar wind.

 - **Abstract**
 The combination of visual and spectroscopic orbits in binary systems enables precise distance measurements without additional assumptions, making them ideal for examining the parallax zero-point offset (PZPO) at bright magnitudes (G < 13) in Gaia. We compiled 249 orbital parallaxes from 246 binary systems and used Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations to exclude binaries where orbital motion significantly impacts parallaxes. After removing systems with substantial parallax errors, large discrepancies between orbital and Gaia parallaxes, and selecting systems with orbital periods under 100 days, a final sample of 44 binaries was this http URL weighted mean PZPO for this sample is -38.9 $\pm$ 10.3 $\mu$as, compared to -58.0 $\pm$ 10.1 $\mu$as for the remaining systems, suggesting that orbital motion significantly affects parallax measurements. These formal uncertainties of the PZPO appear to be underestimated by a factor of approximately 2.0. For bright stars with independent trigonometric parallaxes from VLBI and HST, the weighted mean PZPOs are -14.8 $\pm$ 10.6 and -31.9 $\pm$ 14.1 $\mu$as, respectively. Stars with $G \leq 8$ exhibit a more pronounced parallax bias, with some targets showing unusually large deviations, likely due to systematic calibration errors in Gaia for bright stars. The orbital parallaxes dataset compiled in this work serves as a vital resource for validating parallaxes in future Gaia data releases.

 - **Abstract**
 Theoretical and numerical simulations of black hole hot accretion flows have shown the ubiquitous existence of winds and predicted their properties such as velocity and mass flux. In this paper, we have summarized from literature the physical properties of winds launched from low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGN), which are believed to be powered by hot accretion flows, and compared them with theoretical predictions. We infer that for both ultra-fast outflows and hot winds, the observed wind velocity as a function of their launching radius and the ratio between wind mass flux and black hole accretion rate show good consistency with theoretical predictions. For the prototype LLAGN M81* with abundant observational data, we have examined various observed properties of wind in detail, including velocity, mass flux of the wind, the power-law index of the radial profile of inflow rate, and the jet-to-wind power ratio. Good agreements are found with theoretical predictions, providing strong support to the theory of wind launched from hot accretion flows.

 - **Abstract**
 Accreting millisecond pulsars (AMSPs) are excellent laboratories to study reflection spectra and their features from an accretion disk truncated by a rapidly rotating magnetosphere near the neutron star surface. These systems also exhibit thermonuclear (type-I) bursts that can provide insights on the accretion physics and fuel composition. We explore spectral properties of the AMSP SRGA J144459.2-0604207 observed during the outburst that recently led to its discovery in February 2024. We aim to characterize the spectral shape of the persistent emission, both its continuum and discrete features, and to analyze type-I bursts properties. We employ XMM and NuSTAR overlapping observations taken during the most recent outburst from SRGA J1444. We perform spectral analysis of the persistent (i.e., non-bursting) emission employing a semi-phenomenological continuum model composed of a dominant thermal Comptonization plus two thermal contributions, and a physical reflection model. We also perform time-resolved spectral analysis of a type-I burst employing a blackbody model. We observe a broadened iron emission line, thus suggesting relativistic effects, supported by the physical model accounting for relativistically blurred reflection. The resulting accretion disk extends down to 6 gravitational radii, inclined at ~$53^{\circ}$, and only moderately ionized (log$\xi\simeq2.3$). We observe an absorption edge at ~9.7 keV that can be interpreted as an Fe XXVI edge blueshifted by an ultrafast ($\simeq0.04$c) outflow. Our broadband observations of type-I bursts do not find evidence of photospheric radius expansion. The burst recurrence time shows a dependence on the count rate with the steepest slope ever observed in these systems. We also observe a discrepancy of ~3 between the observed and expected burst recurrence time, which we discuss in the framework of fuel composition and high NS mass scenarios.

 - **Abstract**
 One of the instruments aboard the Sunrise III mission, the Tunable Magnetograph (TuMag), is a tunable imaging spectropolarimeter in visible wavelengths. It is designed to probe the vector magnetic field and the line-of-sight velocity of the photosphere and the lower chromosphere. The quasi-simultaneous observation of two spectral lines provides excellent diagnostic measurements of the magnetic and dynamic coupling in these layers. The key technologies employed for TuMag are an LCVR-based polarimeter and a solid, LiNbO3 Fabry-Pérot etalon as a spectrometer. However, it also incorporates several innovative features, such as home-made high-sensitivity scientific cameras and a double filter wheel. TuMag can sequentially observe any two out of the three spectral lines of Fe I at 525.02 and 525.06 nm and of Mg I at 517.3 nm. Laboratory measurements have demonstrated outstanding performance, including a wavefront root-mean-square error better than {\lambda}/13 for image quality, a full-width-at-half-maximum of 8.7 pm for the filtergraph transmission profile, and polarimetric efficiencies > 0.54. Here we report on the concept, design, calibration, and integration phases of the instrument, as well as on the data reduction pipeline.
#### Investigating Solar Wind Outflows from Open-Closed Magnetic Field Structures Using Coordinated Solar Orbiter and Hinode Observations

 - **Abstract**
 ESA/NASA's Solar Orbiter (SO) allows us to study the solar corona at closer distances and from different perspectives, which helps us to gain significant insights into the origins of the solar wind. In this work, we present the analysis of solar wind outflows from two locations: a narrow open-field corridor and a small, mid-latitude coronal hole. These outflows were observed off-limb by the Metis coronagraph onboard SO and on-disk by the Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) onboard Hinode. Magnetic field extrapolations suggest that the upflow regions seen in EIS were the sources of the outflowing solar wind observed with Metis. We find that the plasma associated with the narrow open-field corridor has higher electron densities and lower outflow velocities compared to the coronal hole plasma in the middle corona, even though the plasma properties of the two source regions in the low corona are found to be relatively similar. The speed of solar wind from the open-field corridor also shows no correlation with the magnetic field expansion factor, unlike the coronal hole. These pronounced differences at higher altitudes may arise from the dynamic nature of the low-middle corona, in which reconnection can readily occur and may play an important role in driving solar wind variability.
#### Evidence of a diffuse, extended continuum source in quasars from the relative sizes of the broad line region and the UV-optical continuum source measured with microlensing

 - **Abstract**
 Microlensing by stars in the lens galaxy of a gravitationally lensed quasar is a phenomenon that can selectively magnify quasar subregions, producing observable changes in the continuum brightness or distortions in the emission line profiles. Hence, microlensing allows us to probe the inner quasar regions. In this paper, we report measurements of the ratio of the broad emission line region (BLR) radius to the continuum source radius in eight lensed quasars, for the CIV, MgII, and H$\alpha$ emission lines and their respective underlying continua at $\lambda\lambda$ 1550Å, 2800Å, and 6563 Å. The microlensing-induced line profile distortions and continuum magnifications were observed in the same single-epoch datasets, and simultaneously compared with microlensing simulations. We found that, on average, the inner radius of the BLR starts at the end of the UV-optical continuum source, independently of the line ionization and the wavelength of the continuum. The half-light radius of the BLR is, on average, a factor of six larger than the half-light radius of the continuum source, independently of the quasar's bolometric luminosity. We also found a correlation between the BLR radius and the continuum source radius, supporting the idea that the dominant contribution to the UV-optical continuum may come from the BLR itself. Our results independently confirm the results of reverberation mapping studies, and extend them to higher-redshift, higher-luminosity quasars.

 - **Abstract**
 The methylidyne cation (CH$^+$) and the methyl cation (CH$_3^+$) are building blocks of organic molecules, yet their coupled formation and excitation mechanisms remain mainly unprobed. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), with its high spatial resolution and good spectral resolution, provides unique access to the detection of these molecules. Our goal is to use the first detection of CH$^+$ and CH$_3^+$ rovibrational emission in the Orion Bar and in the protoplanetary disk d203-506, irradiated by the Trapezium cluster, to probe their formation and excitation mechanisms and constrain the physico-chemical conditions. We use spectro-imaging acquired using both the NIRSpec and MIRI-MRS instruments to study the CH$^+$ and CH$_3^+$ spatial distribution at very small scales, and compare it to excited H$_2$ emission. CH$^+$ and CH$_3^+$ emissions originate from the same region as highly excited H$_2$. Our comparison between the Bar and d203-506 reveals that both CH$^+$ and CH$_3^+$ excitation and/or formation are highly dependent on gas density. The excitation temperature of the observed CH$^+$ and CH$_3^+$ rovibrational lines is around $T$ ~ 1500 K in the Bar and $T$ ~ 800 K in d203-506. Moreover, the column densities derived from the rovibrational emission are less than 0.1 % of the total known (CH$^+$) and expected (CH$_3^+$) column densities. These results show that CH$^+$ and CH$_3^+$ level populations strongly deviate from ETL. CH$^+$ rovibrational emission can be explained by chemical formation pumping with excited H$_2$ via C$^+$ + H$_2^*$ = CH$^+$ + H. These results support a gas phase formation pathway of CH$^+$ and CH$_3^+$ via successive hydrogen abstraction reactions. However, we do not find any evidence of CH$_2^+$ emission in the JWST spectrum. Finally, observed CH$^+$ intensities coupled with chemical formation pumping model provide a diagnostic tool to trace the local density.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents a comprehensive study of the eclipse properties of the spider millisecond pulsar (MSP) J1908$+$2105, using wide-band observations from the uGMRT and Parkes UWL. For the first time, we observed that this pulsar exhibits extended eclipses up to 4 GHz, the highest frequency band of the UWL, making it one of only three MSPs known to have such high-frequency eclipses. This study reveals synchrotron absorption as the primary eclipse mechanism for J1908$+$2105. We present modeling of synchrotron optical depth with various possible combinations of the parameters to explain the observed eclipsing in this as well as other spider MSPs. Observed eclipses at unusually high frequencies for J1908$+$2105 significantly aided in constraining the magnetic field and electron column density in the eclipse medium while modeling the synchrotron optical depth. Combining our findings with data from other MSPs in the literature, for the first time we note that a higher cutoff frequency of eclipsing, particularly above 1 GHz, is consistently associated with a higher electron column density ($>$ 10$^{17}$ cm$^{-2}$) in the eclipse medium. Additionally, we present the first evidence of lensing effects near eclipse boundaries in this MSP, leading to significant magnification of radio emissions. The orbital phase resolved polarization analysis presented in this paper further indicates variation in rotation measure and consequently stronger magnetic fields in the eclipse region.

 - **Abstract**
 We present accretion disc size measurements for the well-known quasar 3C 273 using reverberation mapping (RM) performed on high-cadence light-curves in seven optical filters collected with the Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO). Lag estimates obtained using Javelin and PyROA are consistent with each other and yield accretion disc sizes a factor of ~2-7 larger than `thin disc' theoretical expectations. This makes 3C 273 one of a growing number of active galactic nuclei (AGN) to display the so-called `accretion disc size' problem usually observed in low-luminosity AGN. Power-law fits of the form tau~lambda^beta to the lag spectrum, and nufnu ~ nu^beta to the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the variations, both give results consistent with the `thin disc' theoretical expectation of beta=4/3. The Starkey et al. `flat disc with a steep rim' model can fit both the lag estimates and the SED variations. Extrapolating the observed optical lags to putative dust-forming regions of the disc gives r~100-200 light-days. These radii are consistent with the size of the broad line region (BLR) as determined by near-infrared interferometric studies as well as with the best-fit location of the outer edge for the `flat disc with a steep rim' model. Therefore, the accretion disc in 3C 273 might be sufficiently extended to be dusty, allowing the BLR to emerge from it in a dusty outflow. A flux variation gradient analysis and the structure function of our LCO light-curves confirm that the optical variability in 3C 273 is dominated by the accretion disc rather than its radio jet.

 - **Abstract**
 Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) driven atmospheric escape is a key process in the atmospheric evolution of close-in exoplanets. In many evolutionary models, the energy-limited mass-loss rate with a constant efficiency (typically $\sim10\%$) is assumed for calculating the mass-loss rate. However, hydrodynamic simulations have demonstrated that this efficiency depends on various stellar and planetary parameters. Comprehending the underlying physics of the efficiency is essential for understanding planetary atmospheric evolution and recent observations of the upper atmosphere of close-in exoplanets. We introduce relevant temperatures and timescales derived from physical principles to elucidate the mass-loss process. Our analytical mass-loss model is based on phenomenology and consistent across a range of planetary parameters. We compare our mass-loss efficiency and the radiation hydrodynamic simulations. The model can predict efficiency in both energy-limited and recombination-limited regimes. We further apply our model to exoplanets observed with hydrogen absorption (Ly$\alpha$ and H$\alpha$). Our findings suggest that Ly$\alpha$ absorption is detectable in planets subjected to intermediate EUV flux; under these conditions, the escaping outflow is insufficient in low-EUV environments, while the photoionization timescale remains short in high-EUV ranges. Conversely, H$\alpha$ absorption is detectable under high EUV flux conditions, facilitated by the intense Ly$\alpha$ flux exciting hydrogen atoms. According to our model, the non-detection of neutral hydrogen can be explained by a low mass-loss rate and is not necessarily due to stellar wind confinement or the absence of a hydrogen-dominated atmosphere in many cases. This model assists in identifying future observational targets and explicates the unusual absorption detection/non-detection patterns observed in recent studies.

 - **Abstract**
 It remains challenging to systematically survey nearby diffuse dwarf galaxies and address the formation mechanism of this population distinguishing from regular ones. We carry out a pilot search for these galaxies in the COSMOS field using the deep \textit{HST}/F814W imaging data. We report three diffuse dwarf galaxies satisfying the criteria: (1) redshift $z<0.2$, (2) effective radius $r_{\rm e}>1.0''$, and (3) central surface brightness $\mu_{\rm 0}>24$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$. Two of the three galaxies, COSMOS-UDG1 and COSMOS-UDG2, are recognized as ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) with redshift $z=0.130$ and $0.049$, respectively. The third galaxy, COSMOS-dw1, is spectroscopically confirmed as a dwarf galaxy at $z=0.004$. We derive the physical properties through fitting their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) extracted from deep multiwavelength observations. COSMOS-dw1 has a stellar mass of $5.6_{-2.7}^{+2.5}\times10^{6}$ M$_{\odot}$, harboring neutral hydrogen gas of mass $4.90\pm0.90\times10^{6}$ M$_{\odot}$, hinting that this galaxy may be in the nascent stages of quenching. The estimated dynamical mass of $3.4\times10^{7}\,M_{\odot}$ further suggests that COSMOS-dw1 is predominantly of dark matter. COSMOS-UDG1 and COSMOS-UDG2 exhibit comparable stellar masses of $\sim 2\times10^{8}$ M$_{\odot}$. Notably, COSMOS-UDG1 is younger and more metal-rich than COSMOS-UDG2 and COSMOS-dw1. Conversely, COSMOS-UDG2 and COSMOS-dw1 have similar stellar metallicities, yet COSMOS-UDG2 is older than COSMOS-dw1. All three galaxies adhere to the stellar mass-metallicity relation (MZR) for dwarf galaxies in the local Universe, implying they belong to the dwarf galaxy population.

 - **Abstract**
 The ultra-long wavelength sky ($\nu\lesssim 30$ MHz) is still largely unexplored, as the electromagnetic wave is heavily absorbed and distorted by the ionosphere on Earth. The far-side of the Moon, either in lunar-orbit or on lunar-surface, is the ideal site for observations in this band, and the upcoming Moon-based interferometers will obtain multi-frequency high-resolution sky maps. Making use of the lunar occultation of the sky and the anisotropy of antenna primary beam response, we propose a novel method to reconstruct the ultra-long wavelength spectral shape in multiple directions in the sky using only one antenna on lunar orbit. We apply the method to one antenna on one of the nine daughter satellites of the proposed Discovering the Sky at Longest wavelength (DSL) project. Using simulated observation data between 1 - 30 MHz from one dipole antenna, we find that the spectra for different regions on the sky can be reconstructed very well and the free-free absorption feature in each region can be derived from the reconstructed spectra. This work demonstrates the feasibility to reconstruct the anisotropic ultra-long wavelength spectra with very limited instrumentation on a lunar-orbit, with mature technologies already in place. It extends the application of such kind of satellite in revealing the distribution of free electrons in the Galactic interstellar medium from the distribution of absorption features in the ultra-long wavelength sky.

 - **Abstract**
 Space weather forecasting is critical for mitigating radiation risks in space exploration and protecting Earth-based technologies from geomagnetic disturbances. This paper presents the development of a Machine Learning (ML)- ready data processing tool for Near Real-Time (NRT) space weather forecasting. By merging data from diverse NRT sources such as solar imagery, magnetic field measurements, and energetic particle fluxes, the tool addresses key gaps in current space weather prediction capabilities. The tool processes and structures the data for machine learning models, focusing on time-series forecasting and event detection for extreme solar events. It provides users with a framework to download, process, and label data for ML applications, streamlining the workflow for improved NRT space weather forecasting and scientific research.

 - **Abstract**
 Hydrogen 21-cm Line Intensity Mapping offers the unique opportunity to access the Dark Ages and trace the formation and evolution of the large scale structure of the Universe prior to star and galaxy formation. In this work we investigate the potential of future Earth- and Moon-based 21-cm surveys to constrain the growth of structures during the currently unexplored redshift range $30 < z < 200$. On the one hand we show how foregrounds limit the capabilities of Earth-based instruments in achieving precision below $10\%$ level. On the other hand, observations from the far side of the Moon, not affected by foregrounds generated by Earth's atmosphere, will reach percent or even sub-percent precision in terms of reconstructing the growth of cosmic structures. Such remarkable precision will improve by orders of magnitude parameter constraints on models that induce deviations from $\Lambda$CDM, not only during the Dark Ages, but also during recombination or that manifests mostly in the low-redshift Universe, like Early Dark Energy and nDGP models. Thus, because of their insensitivity to non-linearities or astrophysical processes, line intensity mapping surveys will provide a formidable consistency check to potential claims of discoveries of new physics that affect the growth of structures.

 - **Abstract**
 In the centers of many galaxy clusters, the hot ($\sim$10$^7$ K) intracluster medium (ICM) can become dense enough that it should cool on short timescales. However, the low measured star formation rates in massive central galaxies and absence of soft X-ray lines from cooling gas suggest that most of this gas never cools - this is known as the "cooling flow problem." The latest observations suggest that black hole jets are maintaining the vast majority of gas at high temperatures. A cooling flow has yet to be fully mapped through all gas phases in any galaxy cluster. Here, we present new observations of the Phoenix cluster using the James Webb Space Telescope to map the [Ne VI] $\lambda$7.652$\mu$m emission line, allowing us to probe gas at 10$^{5.5}$ K on large scales. These data show extended [Ne VI] emission cospatial with (i) the cooling peak in the ICM, (ii) the coolest gas phases, and (iii) sites of active star formation. Taken together, these imply a recent episode of rapid cooling, causing a short-lived spike in the cooling rate which we estimate to be 5,000-23,000 M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. These data provide the first large-scale map of gas at temperatures between 10$^5$-10$^6$ K in a cluster core, and highlight the critical role that black hole feedback plays in not only regulating but also promoting cooling.
