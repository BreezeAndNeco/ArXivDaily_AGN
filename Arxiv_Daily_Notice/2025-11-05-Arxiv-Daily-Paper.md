#### The interstellar flux gap: From dust to kilometer-scale objects

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Three kilometer-sized interstellar objects (ISOs) have been detected transiting the Solar System, and spacecraft have directly measured micrometer-scale interstellar dust (ISD). Yet no intermediate-size interstellar meteoroids have been identified in current meteor surveys. Aims. We test whether a power-law flux extrapolation connecting spacecraft ISD and kilometer-scale ISOs is consistent with meteor surveys, and we quantify the expected interstellar impacting flux based on various observational reports. Methods. We compiled differential fluxes and limits from spacecraft ISD, radar and optical meteor surveys, and theoretical estimates. We evaluated the power-law size-frequency fits, computed the 3I-like flux, and compared measured fluxes to predictions. Results. The spacecraft-measured dust flux exceeds extrapolations constrained by meteor surveys and kilometer-scale ISOs by $\sim$2-7 orders of magnitude. An $r^{-3.0}$ fit combining spacecraft ISD detections with kilometer-scale ISOs overpredicts the number of meteors with hyperbolic orbits, whereas slopes of $r^{-2.7}$-$r^{-2.3}$ (derived from radar and optical meteor upper limits, respectively) instead yield interplanetary-to-interstellar flux ratios of $10^{3}$-$10^{6}$. Conclusions. A simple power-law from ISD to ISOs is inconsistent with meteor survey constraints and yields unrealistic predictions for interstellar meteoroids. The data reveal a gap between submicron dust entrained in the Local Interstellar Cloud (LIC) and macroscopic bodies ejected from planetary systems. This gap may reflect distinct origins and destruction-transport processes rather than a continuous size-frequency distribution. This would imply either the dominance of a small-particle LIC component or the need to reassess spacecraft dust fluxes.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed study of Bayesian inference workflows for pulsar timing array data with a focus on enhancing efficiency, robustness and speed through the use of normalizing flow-based nested sampling. Building on the Enterprise framework, we integrate the i-nessai sampler and benchmark its performance on realistic, simulated datasets. We analyze its computational scaling and stability, and show that it achieves accurate posteriors and reliable evidence estimates with substantially reduced runtime, by up to three orders of magnitude depending on the dataset configuration, with respect to conventional single-core parallel-tempering MCMC analyses. These results highlight the potential of flow-based nested sampling to accelerate PTA analyses while preserving the quality of the inference.

 - **Abstract**
 The study of binary millisecond pulsars (MSPs) in globular clusters (GCs) is a key ingredient to study binary and stellar evolution under extreme conditions. In this context, an accurate analysis of the optical emission, which is mostly dominated by the companion star, is essential for a comprehensive characterization of these systems and their role within their environment. In this work, we present a multi-wavelength investigation of five binary MSPs in the Galactic GC M3 (NGC 5272) using archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data. Our analysis builds on the timing solutions obtained with the FAST radio Telescope by Li et al. (2024). For each MSP, we carry out precise astrometric cross-matching with the accurate radio positions to identify potential counterparts. When a match is found, we analyse its location in the colour-magnitude diagrams and compare the results with updated binary evolution models to infer the system properties. We confirm the identification of the optical companion to M3B, matching the source previously reported by Cadelano et al. (2019), and successfully identify and characterize the optical companions to M3D and M3F. All three are consistent with helium white dwarfs, as expected from the canonical formation scenario. For M3A and M3E, no reliable counterparts are found, but we place strong upper limits on the brightness and mass of the undetected companion. In the case of M3E, we detect a red object near the radio position in two F814W observations; however, astrometric measurements over a 15-year baseline reveal a significant proper motion inconsistent with cluster membership, identifying the source as a foreground contaminant. This study highlights the effectiveness of combining precise radio timing with deep, multi-band HST images to uncover and constrain the nature of MSP companions in GCs, offering insights into their formation and evolutionary histories.
#### Inferring the physics of protoplanetary disc evolution from the irradiated Cygnus OB2 region -- A comparison of viscous and MHD wind-driven scenarios

 - **Abstract**
 Our current understanding has crystallised around two possible evolution scenarios for protoplanetary discs (turbulent viscosity and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wind-driven) - but which dominates remains uncertain. Our aims are twofold: Firstly, we investigate whether a single set of model parameters can reproduce the observational constraints of non-irradiated and irradiated discs. Secondly, we propose a novel approach to break degeneracies between the two evolution scenarios by studying the relation of stellar accretion rate and externally driven wind mass-loss rates, which evolve differently depending on the mechanism of angular momentum transport in the outer disc. We evolve synthetic populations of protoplanetary discs using 1D vertically integrated models for both viscous and MHD wind-driven disc evolution including both internal X-ray and external far ultraviolet (FUV) photoevaporation for both evolution scenarios. We investigate both weak and strong FUV field environments, where the strong FUV field is calculated based on an environment similar to the Cygnus OB2 association. While both scenarios are able to reproduce observational constraints, our simulations suggest that different parameters are needed for the angular momentum transport to explain disc lifetimes and disc mass - stellar accretion rate relation in weakly and strongly irradiated regions. We find that the predicted median disc radii are much larger in low FUV environments compared to Cygnus OB2, but also decreasing with time. In the viscous scenario, the median disc radius in a low FUV field environment is ~100au larger than for the MHD wind-driven scenario. We further show that studying stellar accretion rates and externally driven wind mass-loss rates (provided that they can be isolated from internally driven winds; i.e. MHD wind) is indeed a promising way of disentangling the two evolution scenarios.
#### Dust back-reaction on gas around planets modifies the cold thermal torque

 - **Abstract**
 A nascent planet in a gas disk experiences radial migration due to the different torques which act on it. It has recently been shown that the torques produced by the gas and dust density variations around a non-accreting low-mass planet, the so-called cold thermal and dust streaming torques, can surpass each of the other torque components. We investigate how the total torque acting on the planet is affected by the presence of dust grains and their aerodynamic back-reaction on gas, while taking into account the cold thermal torque produced by thermal diffusion in the gas component. We perform high-resolution local and global three-dimensional two-fluid simulations within the pressureless-fluid dust approximation using the Fargo3D code. We explore the influence of different dust species parameterized by the Stokes number, focusing on non-accreting protoplanets with masses from one-third the mass of Mars to one Earth mass. The dust feedback has substantial impact on the asymmetry of the cold thermal lobes (which produce the cold thermal torque). However, the total torque is dominated by the dust torque when St $>10^{-2}$. The dust torque becomes more negative over time due to the formation of dust lobes that resemble the cold thermal lobes that form in the gas component. Therefore, the dust streaming torque prevails over the cold thermal torque. On the other hand, when St $\leq10^{-2}$, the dust streaming torque is negligible and thus, the total torque on the planet comes from the gaseous component of the disk. Our results suggest that a planet embedded in a gas-dust disk may experience stagnant migration or inward runaway migration in regions of the protoplanetary disk where the dust is not fully coupled to the gas. However, this behaviour could change in regions with strong dust-gas coupling or in the inner transition region of the disk, where the cold thermal torque may become relevant.
#### The lives and deaths of faint satellite galaxies around M31

 - **Abstract**
 We present predictions for proper motions, infall times and times of first pericentric passage for 39 of M31's satellite galaxies. We estimate these by sampling satellite orbits from cosmological N-body simulations matched on mass, distance and velocity along the line of sight, in addition to properties of the host system. Our predictions are probabilistic based on repeated sampling from the uncertainty distributions of all quantities involved. We use these constraints on the satellites' orbital histories in conjunction with their published star formation histories to investigate the dominant environmental mechanisms for quenching satellites of M31-like hosts. Around half of the satellites appear to have quenched before their first pericentric passage around M31. Only the most massive satellites (with stellar masses > 10^8 M_sun) are able to maintain star formation for up to billions of years after infall. The majority of faint satellites, with stellar masses < 10^8 M_sun , were likely quenched before entering the M31 system. We compare our results for M31 against predictions for the Milky Way's satellites from the literature; M31's has a more active recent accretion history with more recently quenched satellites than the Milky Way.

 - **Abstract**
 Accretion processes in the planetary-mass regime remain poorly constrained, yet they strongly influence planet formation, evolution, and the composition of circumplanetary disks (CPDs). We investigate the resolved Balmer hydrogen emission-line profiles and their variability in the ~13Mjup, 30-45 Myr-old companion Delorme to constrain the underlying accretion mechanisms. Using VLT/UVES, we obtained 31 new epochs of high-resolution optical spectra (330-680 nm, R = 50,000), probing variability from hours to years. We analyze the shape and flux variability of hydrogen emission lines and compare them to two proposed origins: magnetospheric accretion funnels and localized accretion shocks. We detect Balmer lines from Halpha to H10 (6564-3799 AA) and a UV continuum excess, both indicative of ongoing accretion. All features are variable. The hydrogen lines decompose into two static components that vary only in flux. The broader velocity component correlates strongly with the UV excess and is qualitatively consistent with magnetospheric funnel models, but not with shock models. This component dominates the shape variability. The narrower component, which correlates less with the UV excess, is better matched by shock-emission models and drives most of the flux variability. Line fluxes show low variability on hour timescales but up to ~100% over weeks, similar to T Tauri stars. Our findings support magnetospheric accretion as the origin of the broad component. The narrow component may arise from accretion shocks or chromospheric activity. Higher-cadence observations could reveal rotational modulations and help constrain the object's rotation period and accretion geometry.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate if systems of multiple Lyman-alpha emitters (LAEs) can serve as a proxy for dark matter halo mass, assess how their radiative properties relate to the underlying halo conditions, and explore the physics of star formation activity in LAEs and its relation to possible physically related companions. We use data from the One-hundred-deg$^2$ DECam Imaging in Narrowbands (ODIN) survey, which targets LAEs in three narrow redshift slices. We identify physically associated LAE multiples in the COSMOS field at $z = 2.4$, $z = 3.1$, and $z=4.5$, and use a mock catalog from the IllustrisTNG100 simulation to assess the completeness and contamination affecting the resulting sample of LAE multiples. We then study their statistical and radiative properties as a function of multiplicity, where we adopt the term multiplicity to refer to the number of physically associated LAEs. We find a strong correlation between LAE multiplicity and host halo mass in the mocks, with higher multiplicity systems preferentially occupying more massive halos. In both ODIN and the mock sample, we find indications that the mean Ly$\alpha$ luminosity and UV magnitude of LAEs in multiples increase with multiplicity. The halo-wide LAE surface brightness densities in Ly$\alpha$ and UV increase with multiplicity, reflecting more compact and actively star-forming environments. The close agreement between the model and ODIN observations supports the validity of the Ly$\alpha$ emission model in capturing key physical processes in LAE environments. Finally, a subhalo-based perturbation induced star formation model reproduces the minimum subhalo mass distribution in simulations at $z=2.4$, suggesting that local perturbations, rather than the presence of LAE companions, drive star formation in these systems. For the higher redshifts, neighbor perturbations do not seem to be the main driver that triggers star formation.
#### Star Formation Histories and Stellar Dynamics in the Central Galaxies of RX J0820.9+0752, A1835, and PKS 0745-191

 - **Abstract**
 We present Keck Cosmic Web Imager observations of stellar populations in three galaxies at the centers of cooling flow clusters. All three host rich molecular gas reservoirs and show prominent Balmer absorption from $30-100$ Myr-old stars consistent with long lasting star formation. Two systems, A1835 and PKS 0745-191, have extended young stellar populations in their centers with recent star formation rates of 100 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and 8 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, respectively. In A1835 we uncover a massive blueshifted clump of young stars moving at high speed with respect to the gas and central galaxy. We suggest this feature is a young population that formed in a gaseous outflow that has detached from its natal gas and is falling back toward the galaxy. This result, combined with a companion study (arXiv:2404.02212) tracing nebular emission which presumably cooled from the hot X-ray atmosphere, indicates that star formation is proceeding in a dynamically complex environment resulting from the central galaxy's motion with respect to the cooling clouds and motion induced by feedback from the central radio jets. In RX J0820.9+0752 intermediate age stars are found in a filament outside of the nucleus with no discernible star formation at the center of the galaxy. All projected galaxies are composed of old stellar populations with deep D4000 breaks and are devoid of detectable warm gas. While in some instances they may be interacting gravitationally with the central galaxy, they cannot have donated the upward of $10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$ of molecular gas found in these systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Evidence suggests that protostellar outbursts likely play a critical role in the stellar mass assembly process, but the extent of this contribution is not well understood. Using the proposed observing program of PRIMA, a concept far-IR observatory (PRIMA GO Case #43 in Moullet et al. 2023), we examine the probe's ability to unambiguously determine whether or not variable accretion events dominate the stellar mass assembly process ($M_{\rm burst}\geq0.5M_{*}$). To do this, we construct multiple protostellar ensembles using Herschel 70$\mu$m flux data and evolve them using a toy Monte Carlo simulation through steady-state and high magnitude accretion events. Ensembles are observed at various epochs in the evolution process to conclude how many large amplitude outbursts are observationally recoverable during the proposed program. Based on our synthetic observations and our simulation specifications, we determine that observing a protostellar ensemble of at least 2000 protostars using PRIMA's proposed program is sufficient for determining the importance of protostellar outbursts in the stellar mass assembly process.
#### The complicated nature of the X-ray emission from the field of the strongly lensed hyperluminous infrared galaxy PJ1053+60 at z=3.549

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of XMM-Newton X-ray observations of PJ1053+60, a hyperluminous infrared galaxy (HyLIRG) at z=3.549 that is strongly lensed by a foreground group at z=0.837. We also present GNIRS spectroscopy confirming the presence of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) to the southwest of PJ1053+60 ($AGN_{SW}$) at $z_{SW}$ = 1.373 $\pm$ 0.006. Using this redshift prior, we decompose the X-ray spectrum of PJ1053+60 into $AGN_{SW}$ and high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB) components from the HyLIRG. The HMXB component has an unusually high luminosity, $\sim$ 50 times higher than calibration derived from local galaxies, and a characteristic photon index likely too flat to be caused by high-mass X-ray binaries at rest frame energies above a few keV. Our 2-D spatial decomposition also suggests a similarly high X-ray HMXB luminosity, although the limited spatial resolution prevents meaningful morphological constraints on the component. We conclude that the enhanced X-ray emission may only be explained by the presence of another AGN ($AGN_{FG}$) embedded in the foreground group lensing the PJ1053+60 system. The presence of $AGN_{FG}$ is further supported by the detection of a point-like radio continuum source that coincides with the brightest group galaxy (BGG) of the foreground lens. Our study demonstrates the limited capability of current X-ray observatories while highlighting the need for higher angular resolution observations to definitively characterize the nature of X-ray emission in distant, strongly lensed HyLIRGs.
#### Plasma flow in force-free magnetospheres: two-fluid model near pulsars and black holes

 - **Abstract**
 Force-free electrodynamics describes the electromagnetic field of the magnetically dominated plasma found near pulsars and active black holes, but gives no information about the underlying particles that ultimately produce the observable emission. Working in the two-fluid approximation, we show how particles can be "painted on" to a force-free solution as a function of boundary conditions that encode the particle output of "gap regions" where the force-free approximation does not hold. These boundary conditions also determine the leading parallel electric field in the entire magnetosphere. Our treatment holds in a general (possibly curved) spacetime and is phrased in language intrinsic to the 1+1 dimensional "field sheet spacetimes" experienced by particles stuck to magnetic field lines. Besides the new results, this provides an elegant formulation of some standard equations; for example, we show that the zero-gyroradius guiding center approximation is just the Lorentz force law on the field sheet. We derive a general perturbative method and apply it to pulsar and black hole magnetospheres with radial magnetic fields to produce fully analytic models that capture key features of the full problem. When applied to more realistic magnetic field configurations together with simulation-informed boundary conditions for the gap regions, this approach has the potential to provide global magnetosphere models without the need for global particle-in-cell simulations.
#### GMCs and Star Formation in the Galaxy: I. Effects of an HII region on a GMC

 - **Abstract**
 The destruction of Giant Molecular Clouds is a key component in galaxy evolution. We theoretically model the destruction of GMCs by HII regions, which evaporate ionized gas and eject neutral gas during their expansion. HII regions follow one of three tracks, depending on the EUV luminosity, $S$, of the ionizing OB association: the expansion can stall inside the cloud; it can break out, forming a blister (champagne) flow; or, for $S>S_{\rm com}$, it can result in the formation of a cometary cloud. We present results for the accumulated mass loss, $M_{\rm loss}(t)$, and the final mass loss, $M_{{\rm loss},f}$, by evaporation and ejection for a range of cloud masses ($10^4<M<10^{7}$ M$_\odot$), cloud surface densities ($50<\Sigma<1000$ M$_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$), OB association luminosities ($10^{44}<S<10^{52}$ s$^{-1}$), and off-center position of the association. We do not consider starbursts; our neglect of radiation pressure restricts our treatment to $S<10^{52} [(M/10^6$ M$_\odot)^{0.3})/(\Sigma /100$ M$_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$)] s$^{-1}$, and our neglect of gravity restricts $(M/10^6$ M$_\odot$)($\Sigma/ 100$ M$_\odot$ pc$^{-2}) < 10$. We find that $M_{{\rm loss},f}$ for the range $0.1 < M_{{\rm loss},f}/M < 0.7$ , is proportional to $S^p$, where $p\sim 0.45-0.75$ depends on $M$, $\Sigma$, and association position. We find analytic fits to $S_{\rm com}$ as a function of $\Sigma$, $M$, and association position. $S> S_{\rm com}$ associations destroy at least 70% of the initial cloud. We find a critical cloud mass $M_{\rm survive}$ above which clouds never become cometary and lose $<$ 70% of their mass via a single association. Low mass clouds mostly lose mass via ejection of neutral gas.
#### A Correlation Between the Final Separation and Mass Ratio from Common Envelope Simulations

 - **Abstract**
 Analytical models for common envelope evolution (CEE), particularly the energy formalism, are used in binary population synthesis to predict post-CEE configurations. This formalism is based on an efficiency parameter alpha, which relates the orbital energy released during CEE to that required to unbind the envelope of the giant. However, one of the main challenges is that CEE is a multiscale, multiphysics process. As a result, there may not be a universal value for alpha, or even a general expression. Using 13 3D simulations of CEE with RGBs (1 and 2 M$_\odot$ primary; four mass ratios; with and without corotation), we present an empirical linear correlation between the post-plunge-in separation and the mass ratio, normalized by the giant radius. This trend for the plunge-in phase of CEE persists across RGB, AGB, and supergiant simulations in the literature, even for partially bound envelopes. Therefore, alpha from simulations should not be used to predict the final separation, but rather as a diagnostic of whether sufficient orbital energy has been liberated to completely eject the envelope immediately after the radial plunge. If this condition is not met, further in-spiral is expected in later stages of CEE, which may explain why the final separation of post-CEE observations is generally smaller than those predicted by the linear fit. Our results reinforce the idea that a better description could emerge if CEE is treated as a sequence of distinct phases, rather than treating it as a single event governed by alpha.
#### Measurement of angular cross-correlation between the cosmological dispersion measure and the thermal Sunyaev--Zeldovich effect

 - **Abstract**
 The dispersion measures (${\rm DMs}$) from fast radio bursts (FRBs) and the thermal Sunyaev--Zeldovich (tSZ) effect probe the free-electron density and pressure, respectively, in the intergalactic medium (IGM) and the intervening galaxies and clusters. Their combination enables disentangling the gas density and temperature. In this work, we present the first detection of an angular cross-correlation between the ${\rm DMs}$ and the Compton $y$ parameter of the tSZ effect. The theoretical expectation is calculated using the halo model $\texttt{HMx}$, calibrated with hydrodynamic simulations. The observational cross-correlation is measured over angular separations of $1^\prime$--$1000^\prime$ using the ${\rm DMs}$ from $133$ localized FRBs and the $y$-maps from the Planck satellite and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). We detect a positive correlation with amplitudes of $\mathcal{A}=2.26 \pm 0.56$ ($4.0 \sigma$) for Planck and $\mathcal{A}=1.38 \pm 0.92$ ($1.5 \sigma$) for ACT, where $\mathcal{A}=1$ corresponds to the theoretical prediction of the Planck 2018 $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Assuming an isothermal gas, the measured amplitude implies an average electron temperature of $\approx 2 \times 10^7 \, {\rm K}$. The correlation is highly sensitive to the matter clustering parameter $\sigma_8$, and its dependence on other cosmological and astrophysical parameters -- such as the ionized fraction, the Hubble constant, and baryon feedback -- differs from that of the ${\rm DM}$ alone. This suggests that future joint analyses of the ${\rm DMs}$ and the tSZ effect could help break degeneracies among these parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 Since their discovery more than 60 years ago, accreting supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei (AGN) were recognized as highly variable sources, requiring an extremely compact, dynamic environment. Their variability traces to multiple phenomena, including changing accretion rates, temperature changes, foreground absorbers, and structural changes to the accretion disk. Spurred by a new generation of time-domain surveys, the extremes of black hole variability are now being probed. We report the discovery of an extreme flare by the AGN J224554.84+374326.5, which brightened by more than a factor of 40 in 2018. The source has slowly faded since then. The total emitted UV/optical energy to date is $\sim10^{54}$ erg, i.e., the complete conversion of approximately one solar mass into electromagnetic radiation. This flare is 30 times more powerful than the previous most powerful AGN transient. Very few physical events in the Universe can liberate this much electromagnetic energy. We discuss potential mechanisms, including the tidal disruption of a high mass $(>30\, M_\odot)$ star, gravitational lensing of an AGN flare or supernova, or a supermassive (pair instability) supernova in the accretion disk of an AGN. We favor the tidal disruption of a massive star in a prograde orbit in an AGN disk.

 - **Abstract**
 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), owing to their great distances and compact sizes, serve as fundamental anchors for defining the celestial reference frame. With about 1.9 million AGNs observed in Gaia DR3 at optical precision comparable to radio wavelengths, Gaia provides a solid foundation for constructing the next-generation, kinematically non-rotating optical reference frame. Accurate assessment of systematic residuals in AGN astrometry is therefore crucial. In this talk, we analysed the parallaxes and proper motions of Gaia DR3 AGNs to characterize systematic errors and their correlations with various physical and observational properties. A subset of Gaia-CRF3 AGNs exhibits significant astrometric offsets, mainly arising from dual or lensed quasars whose structural variations induce photocenter jitter, mimicking parallax and proper motion. Such sources must be carefully excluded from reference frame construction. To this end, we introduce an astrometric quality index for each source to quantify its astrometric reliability. The results reveal a strong correlation between lower quality index values and increasing errors in position, proper motion, and parallax, demonstrating that the proposed index provides an effective metric for selecting high-fidelity AGNs as primary reference sources.

 - **Abstract**
 The quark star (QS) is a hypothetical and yet undiscovered stellar object, and its existence would mark a paradigm shift in research on nuclear and quark matter. Although compactness is a well-known signature for distinguishing between two branches of QSs and neutron stars (NSs), some QSs can overlap with NSs in the radius-mass plane. To manifest their evident differences, we investigate the tidal properties of QSs and NSs. We then find that the magnetic-type Love number is a robust indicator for differentiating between QSs and NSs, whereas the electric-type one is insufficient when QSs and NSs have similar masses and radii. Finally, we show that gravitational waves from binary star mergers can be sensitive to differences between QSs and NSs to the detectable level.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the application of the data-driven branch of the MURaM code, which follows the evolution of the actual active region over 4 days and reproduces many key coronal extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) emission features seen in remote sensing observations. Radiative magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations that account for sophisticated energy transport processes, such as those in the real corona, have been extended with the ability to use observations as time-dependent boundaries, such that the models follow the evolution of actual active regions. This opens the possibility of a one-to-one model of a target region over an extensive time period. We use a hybrid strategy that combines fast-evolving idealized zero-$\beta$ models that capture the evolution of the large-scale active region magnetic field over a long time period and sophisticated radiative MHD models for a shorter time period of interest. Synthesized EUV images illustrate the formation of coronal loops that connect the two sunspots or fan out to the domain boundary. The model reveals in three-dimensional space the finer structures in the coronal heating and plasma properties, which are usually concealed behind the EUV observables. The emission-measure-weighted line-of-sight velocity, which represents the Doppler shift of a spectral line forming in a certain temperature range, reveals vigorous dynamics in plasma at different temperatures and ubiquitous MHD waves, as expected in the real solar corona.

 - **Abstract**
 We study supernova (SN) classification using the machine learning method of the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) in the Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope Ultra-Deep Field (CSST-UDF) photometric survey, and explore the improvement of the cosmological constraint. We generate the mock light curve data of Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) and core collapse supernova (CCSN) using SNCosmo with SALT3 SN Ia model and CCSN templates, and apply the SuperNNova (SNN) program for classifying SNe. Our study indicates that the SNN combined with the Joint Light-curve Analysis like (JLA-like) cuts can enhance the purity of the CSST-UDF SN Ia sample up to over 99.5% with 2,193 SNe Ia and 4 CCSNe, which can significantly increase the reliability of the cosmological constraint results. The method based on the Bayesian Estimation Applied to Multiple Species (BEAMS) with Bias Corrections (BBC) framework is used to correct the SN Ia magnitude bias caused by the selection effect and CCSN contamination, and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is employed for cosmological constraints. We find that the accuracy of the constraints on the matter density $\Omega_{\rm M}$ and the equation of state of dark energy $w$ can achieve 14% and 18%, respectively, assuming the flat $w$CDM model. This result is comparable to that from the current surveys that relied on spectroscopic confirmation. It indicates that our data analysis method is effective, and the CSST-UDF SN photometric survey is powerful in exploring the expansion history of the Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 In the paper we discuss the possibility of the influence of parametric excitation, in particular, planetary gravitational interaction, on the behavior of stellar magnetic activity cycles. Using the well-known Parker dynamo modeling, we demonstrate the doubtfulness of the fact that planetary rotation can be a determining factor in the formation of the cycle itself. However, we show that even a weak parametric influence can be sufficient to modulation of magnetic field oscillations, and, in particular, to the occurrence of beats. This result is discussed in the context of the influence of Jupiter on the occurrence of maxima and minima of the magnetic activity of our Sun.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of a coordinated campaign to observe radio and optical stellar flares from the nearby M dwarf flare star EV~Lac. From a total of 27 hours of radio and 29 hours of optical observations, we examine the correspondence of the action of accelerated electrons of different energies in two distinct regions of the stellar atmosphere. We find that out of 9 optical flares with suitable radio coverage, only four have plausible evidence for a radio response. Optical photometric properties cannot predict which flares will have a radio response. From flares with time-resolved optical spectroscopy available, optical-only flares have similar implied electron distributions, while those with radio responses better correlate with higher low-energy cutoffs. The optical flares with a radio response all exhibit a delay between the optical and radio peaks of $\approx$1-7 minutes, with the optical flare peaking earlier in all cases. This likely indicates multiple loops are involved in the event, and/or the different impacts on electrons trapped in a magnetic loop (producing radio emission), versus those directly precipitating from the loop (producing the optical flare). We also remark on the radio spectral index behavior at early times for the largest radio flare observed in this study, which we interpret as evidence for increased opacity from a chromospheric evaporation front.

 - **Abstract**
 Active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback is widely viewed as the most promising solution to the long-standing cooling flow problem in galaxy clusters, yet previous models prescribe jet properties inconsistent with accretion physics. We perform high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations of a Perseus-like cluster using the MACER framework, incorporating both jets and winds constrained by general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations and observations. The combined feedback reproduces key observables--including cold gas mass, star formation rate, thermodynamic radial profiles, and black hole growth--while jet-only or wind-only models fail. The success arises from turbulence driven by jet-wind shear that enhances kinetic-to-thermal energy conversion, boosting heating efficiency by factors of three and six relative to wind-only and jet-only cases, respectively, yielding a self-consistent solution to cluster cooling flows.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an application of the Balanced Neural Ratio Estimation (BNRE) algorithm to improve the statistical validity of parameter estimates used to characterize the Epoch of Reionization, where the common assumption of a multivariate Gaussian likelihood leads to overconfident and biased posterior distributions. Using a two-parameter model of the Ly$\alpha$ forest autocorrelation function, we show that BNRE yields posterior distributions that are significantly better calibrated than those obtained under the Gaussian likelihood assumption, as verified through the Test of Accuracy with Random Points (TARP) and Simulation-Based Calibration (SBC) diagnostics. These results demonstrate the potential of Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) methods, and in particular BNRE, to provide statistically robust parameter constraints within existing astrophysical modeling frameworks.

 - **Abstract**
 Disc winds driven by thermal and magnetic processes are thought to play a critical role in protoplanetary disc evolution. However, the relative contribution of each mechanism remains uncertain, particularly in light of their observational signatures. We investigate whether spatially resolved emission and synthetic spectral line profiles can distinguish between thermally and magnetically driven winds in protoplanetary discs. We modelled three disc wind scenarios with different levels of magnetisation: a relatively strongly magnetised wind ($\beta$4), a rather weakly magnetised wind ($\beta$6), and a purely photoevaporative wind (PE). Using radiative transfer post-processing, we generated synthetic emission maps and line profiles for [OI] 6300 Å, [NeII] 12.81 $\mathrm{\mu}$m, and o-H2 2.12 $\mathrm{\mu}$m, and compared them with observations. The $\beta$4 model generally produces broader and more blueshifted low-velocity components across all tracers, consistent with compact emission regions and steep velocity gradients. The $\beta$6 and PE models yield narrower profiles with smaller blueshifts, in better agreement with most observed narrow low-velocity components (NLVCs). We also find that some line profile diagnostics, such as the inclination at maximum centroid velocity, are not robust discriminants. However, the overall blueshift and full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the low-velocity components provide reliable constraints. The $\beta$4 model reproduces the most extreme blueshifted NLVCs in observations, while most observed winds are more consistent with the $\beta$6 and PE models. Our findings reinforce previous conclusions that most observed NLVCs are compatible with weakly magnetised or purely photoevaporative flows. The combination of line kinematics and emission morphology offers meaningful constraints on wind-driving physics.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the complicated processes that regulate star formation and cause a galaxy to become quiescent is key to our comprehension of galaxy evolution. We used nine well resolved star-forming z<1 galaxies from the UVCANDELS survey, where a total of 10 HST bands including UV follow up in UVIS/F275W allow us to reconstruct the star formation histories (SFHs) of regions across each galaxy. This approach provides a powerful tool to explore the spatio-temporal connection between star formation and galaxy evolution. The spatial and temporal profiles of stellar mass and star formation rate surface density were obtained from the SFHs of these regions. We measure scaling relations and projected radial profiles of regions within each galaxy at the time of observation and at 1 Gyr lookback time, noting possible trends in the evolution. By comparing the change in star formation over time we can infer the timing and location of star formation and see early signs of star formation shut off before quenching occurs. We compared the star formation rate density -- stellar mass density scaling relations for individual galaxies as they evolve from 1 Gyr lookback time. The correlation lines pivot around a log-stellar mass surface density of 7.25 [$M_\odot$ $kpc^{-2}$] may be evidence of a self-regulating process on these scales. Radial profiles of galaxy Log sSFR show an overall decrease over 1 Gyr, but five galaxies show a greater change in Log sSFR at the outskirts than the center indicating a possible early onset of quenching in these galaxies.
