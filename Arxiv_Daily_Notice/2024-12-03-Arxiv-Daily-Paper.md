#### Nonthermal Signatures of Radiative Supernova Remnants II: The Impact of Cosmic Rays and Magnetic Fields

 - **Abstract**
 Near the ends of their lives, supernova remnants (SNRs) enter a "radiative phase," when efficient cooling of the postshock gas slows expansion. Understanding SNR evolution at this stage is crucial for estimating feedback in galaxies, as SNRs are expected to release energy and momentum into the interstellar medium near the ends of their lives. A standard prediction of SNR evolutionary models is that the onset of the radiative stage precipitates the formation of a dense shell behind the forward shock. In Paper I, we showed that such shell formation yields detectable nonthermal radiation from radio to $\gamma$-rays, most notably emission brightening by nearly two orders of magnitude. However, there remains no observational evidence for such brightening, suggesting that this standard prediction needs to be investigated. In this paper, we perform magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of SNR evolution through the radiative stage, including cosmic rays (CRs) and magnetic fields to assess their dynamical roles. We find that both sources of nonthermal pressure disrupt shell formation, reducing shell densities by a factor of a few to more than an order of magnitude. We also use a self-consistent model of particle acceleration to estimate the nonthermal emission from these modified SNRs and demonstrate that, for reasonable CR acceleration efficiencies and magnetic field strengths, the nonthermal signatures of shell formation can all but disappear. We therefore conclude that the absence of observational signatures of shell formation represents strong evidence that nonthermal pressures from CRs and magnetic fields play a critical dynamical role in late-stage SNR evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Over the last few decades, there has been considerable interest in the violation of the sacred "Chandrasekhar" mass limit of white dwarfs (WDs). Peculiar over-luminous type Ia supernovae (such as SNLS-03D3bb) lend observational support to the idea that these super-Chandrasekhar WDs exist. Our group, for more than a decade, has been actively working on the theoretical possibility of these objects through the presence of the star's magnetic field. The magnetic field greatly contributes to the existence of these massive WDs, both through classical and quantum effects. In this work, we explore super-Chandrasekhar WDs, formed via evolution from a main sequence star, as a result of the classical effects of the star's magnetic field. We obtain super-Chandrasekhar WDs and new mass limit(s), depending on the magnetic field geometry. We explore the full evolution and stability of these objects from the main sequence stage through the one-dimensional stellar evolution code STARS. In order to do so, we have appropriately modified the given codes by introducing magnetic effect and cooling. Our simulation confirms that massive WDs are possible in the presence of a magnetic field satisfying underlying stability.
#### Combined Surface Flux Transport and Helioseismic Far-side Active Region Model (FARM)

 - **Abstract**
 Maps of the magnetic field at the Sun's surface are commonly used as boundary conditions in space-weather modeling. However, continuous observations are only available from the Sun's Earth-facing side. One commonly used approach to mitigate the lack of far-side information is to apply a surface flux transport (SFT) model to model the evolution of the magnetic field as the Sun rotates. Helioseismology can image active regions on the far side using acoustic oscillations, and hence has the potential to improve the modeled surface magnetic field. In this study, we propose a novel approach for estimating magnetic fields of active regions on the Sun's far side based on seismic measurements, and then include them into a SFT model. To calibrate seismic signal to magnetic field, we apply our SFT model to line-of-sight magnetograms from SDO/HMI to obtain reference maps of global magnetic fields. The resulting maps are compared with seismic maps on the Sun's far side computed using helioseismic holography. The spatial structure of the magnetic field within an active region is reflected in the spatial structure of seismic phase shifts. We assign polarities to the unipolar magnetic-field concentrations based on Hale's law and require approximate flux balance between the two polarities. From 2010 to 2024, we modeled 859 active regions, with an average total unsigned flux of $7.84\cdot 10^{21}$ Mx and an average area of $4.48\cdot 10^{10}$ km$^{2}$. Approximately $4.2\%$ of the active regions were found to have an anti-Hale configuration, which we manually corrected. Comparisons between modeled open-field areas and EUV observations reveal a substantial improvement in agreement when far-side active regions are included. This proof of concept study demonstrates the potential of the ``combined surface flux transport and helioseismic Far-side Active Region Model'' (FARM) to improve space-weather modeling.
#### Constraints on the dark matter-baryon interaction cross section from galaxy cluster thermodynamics

 - **Abstract**
 Dark matter (DM) models with a non-zero DM-baryon interaction cross section imply energy transfer between DM and baryons. We present a new method of constraining the DM-baryon interaction cross section and DM particle mass for velocity-independent interactions using the thermodynamics of galaxy clusters. If the baryonic gas in these clusters is in thermodynamic equilibrium and DM cools baryons, this cooling rate is limited by the net heating rate of other mechanisms in the cluster. We use the REFLEX clusters from the Meta-Catalogue of X-ray detected Clusters of Galaxies (MCXC) with mass estimates from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) catalog of Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) selected galaxy clusters. This yields 95% upper bounds on the DM-proton interaction cross section for velocity-independent interactions of $\sigma_0\leq9.3\times10^{-28} \mathrm{~cm^2}$ for DM masses, $m_\chi = 10^{-4} - 10^{-1}$ GeV. These constraints are within an order of magnitude of the best constraints derived in this mass range, and serve as a complementary, independent constraint. We also apply this model to the fractional interacting DM scenario, where only 10% and 1% of the DM is interacting. Unlike other methods, this constraint scales linearly with this fraction. This yields 95% upper bounds of $\sigma_0\leq1.1\times10^{-26} \mathrm{~cm^2}$ and $\sigma_0\leq8.2\times10^{-26} \mathrm{~cm^2}$, which are the strongest existing constraints for this scenario. This paper serves as a proof of concept. Upcoming SZ measurements will provide temperature profiles for galaxy clusters. Combining these measurements with more complex thermodynamic models could lead to more robust constraints.
#### On the universality of the halo mass function beyond ${\Lambda}$CDM cosmology

 - **Abstract**
 The abundance of dark matter haloes as a function of halo mass is a key diagnostic for constraining the cosmological model. The theoretical framework based on excursion set arguments, when applied to an initial Gaussian random field of density fluctuations, predicts universal behaviour for this quantity, when variables are recast in terms of peak height. The great advantage of this, if true, is that it implies one simply needs to accurately simulate only a single cosmological model to build an emulator for any other cosmology of interest. This tantalising possibility has inspired a number of studies over the years. In practice, the diversity of ways for defining haloes has led to a variety of mixed results concerning this issue. In this work, we utilise a suite of high-resolution cosmological $N$-body simulations, to revisit this question for friends-of-friends haloes. We perform our study in the context of the flat, time-evolving dark energy model (hereafter $w$CDM), and with simple modifications of the primordial physics afforded through variations of the scalar power spectral index and its possible running. We construct the universal mass function locus from our fiducial simulation (a ${\Lambda}$CDM model) and emulate this using a linear interpolating function. We then compare this against the loci that we measure for our array of alternate models. We find mass functions that are consistent with universality to within ${\lesssim} \ 5\%$ in the fractional difference, with respect to variations of the 8 cosmological parameters that we have considered (2 variations per parameter) and for redshifts $z < 7$.

 - **Abstract**
 Spectrum analysis at 3 mm of the central region ($r\sim$800 pc) of NGC\,4303 showed molecular gas lines of both dense gas tracers (HCN, HNC, HCO$^+$, and C$_2$H) and diffuse gases ($^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O). Molecular gas derived parameters: $H_2$ mass $M_{H_2}$=(1.75$\pm$0.32)$\times10^{8}$ M$_{\odot}$; radial velocity, V$_{dense}=$178$\pm$60 km\,s$^{-1}$, and V$_{CO}=$151$\pm$29 km\,s$^{-1}$; HCN luminosity $L_{HCN}$=(7.38$\pm$1.40)$\times10^{6}\,\,K\,\,km\,\,s^{-1}\,pc^{2}$; dense gas mass $M_{dense}$=(4.7$\pm$0.3) $\times 10^{7}$ M$_{\odot}$, and dense gas tracers abundances indicating that dense gas contributes significantly to the total molecular gas mass. To explore the AGN nature and central dusty torus of the galaxy, CIGALE was used to fit the integrated spectral energy distribution from submillimeter to UV frequencies. Large torus properties are estimated: luminosity $L_{TORUS}$\,=\,(7.1$\pm$2.8) $\times 10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and line of sight inclination of 67$\pm$16$^\circ$, which is consistent with a Type 2 AGN; total infrared luminosity $L_{IR}$=(3.51$\,\pm$\,0.30)$\times 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$; star formation rate $SFR$=6.0$\pm$0.3 M$_{\odot}$\,yr$^{-1}$; and found that the AGN contribution is marginal at $\sim$20\%.

 - **Abstract**
 Quiet-Sun regions cover most of the Sun's surface; its magnetic fields contribute significantly to the solar chromospheric and coronal heating. However, characterizing the magnetic fields of the quiet Sun is challenging due to their weak polarization signal. The 4-m \textit{Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope} (\textit{DKIST}) is expected to improve our understanding of the quiet-Sun magnetism. In this paper, we assess the diagnostic capability of the Diffraction-Limited Near Infrared Spectropolarimeter (DL-NIRSP) instrument on \textit{DKIST} on the energy transport processes in the quiet-Sun photosphere. To this end, we synthesize high-resolution, high-cadence Stokes profiles of the \ion{Fe}{1} 630~nm lines using a realistic magnetohydrodynamic simulation, degrade them to emulate the \textit{DKIST}/DL-NIRSP observations, and subsequently infer the vector magnetic and velocity fields. For the assessment, we first verify that a widely used flow-tracking algorithm, Differential Affine Velocity Estimator for Vector Magnetograms, works well for estimating the large-scale ($> 200$ km) photospheric velocity fields with these high-resolution data. We then examine how the accuracy of inferred velocity depends on the temporal resolution. Finally, we investigate the reliability of the Poynting flux estimate and its dependence on the model assumptions. The results suggest that the unsigned Poynting flux, estimated with existing schemes, can account for about $71.4\%$ and $52.6\%$ of the reference ground truth at $\log \tau =0.0$ and $\log \tau = -1$. However, the net Poynting flux tends to be significantly underestimated. The error mainly arises from the underestimated contribution of the horizontal motion. We discuss the implications on \textit{DKIST} observations.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a 19.7 - 214 $\mu$m imaging atlas of local (4 - 181 Mpc; median 43 Mpc) active galactic nuclei (AGN) observed with FORCAST and HAWC+ on board the SOFIA telescope with angular resolutions ~ 3"- 20". This atlas comprises 22 Seyferts (17 Type 2 and 5 Type 1) with a total of 69 images, 41 of which have not been previously published. The AGN span a range of luminosities of log$_{10}$ ($L_{bol}$ [erg/s]) = [42, 46] with a median of log$_{10}$ ($L_{bol}$ [erg/s]) = 44.1 $\pm$ 1.0. We provide total fluxes of our sample using aperture photometry for point source objects and a 2-D Gaussian fitting for objects with extended host galaxy emission, which was used to estimate the unresolved nuclear component. Most galaxies in our sample are point-like sources, however, four sources (Centaurus A, Circinus, NGC 1068, and NGC 4388) show extended emission in all wavelengths. The 30 - 40 $\mu$m extended emission in NGC 4388 is coincident with the narrow line region at PA ~ 50$^{\circ}$, while the dusty extension at longer wavelengths arises from the host galaxy at PA ~ 90$^{\circ}$. Our new observations allow us to construct the best sampled spectral energy distributions (SEDs) available between 30 - 500 $\mu$m for a sample of nearby AGN. We estimate that the average peak wavelength of the nuclear SEDs is ~ 40 $\mu$m in $\nu$F$_{\nu}$ , which we associate with an unresolved extended dusty region heated by the AGN.

 - **Abstract**
 Infrared-faint radio sources (IFRSs) are believed to be a rare class of radio-loud active galactic nuclei (RL AGN) characterized by their high radio-to-infrared flux density ratios of up to several thousands. Previous studies have shown that a fraction of IFRSs are likely to be hosted in dust-obscured galaxies (DOGs). In this paper, our aim was to probe the dust properties, star formation rate (SFR), and AGN activity of IFRSs by modeling the UV-to-infrared spectral energy distribution (SED) of 20 IFRSs with spectroscopic redshifts ranging from 1.2 to 3.7. We compare the Bayesian evidence of a three-component model (stellar, AGN and cold dust) with that of a two-component model (stellar and cold dust) for six IFRSs in our sample with far-infrared (FIR) photometry and find that the three-component model has significantly higher Bayesian evidence, suggesting that IFRSs are most likely to be AGN. The median SED of our IFRS sample shows similarities to AGN-starburst composite in the IR regime. The derived IR luminosities of IFRSs indicate that they are low-luminosity counterparts of high-redshift radio galaxies. We disentangle the contributions of AGN-heated and star-formation-heated dust to the IR luminosity of IFRSs and find that our sample is likely AGN-dominated. However, despite the evidence for significant impact of AGN on the host galaxy, the AGN luminosity of our sample does not show correlation with the SFR of the sources.

 - **Abstract**
 The Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) has been fully operational since 11 January 2020. We present a comprehensive analysis of the beam structure for each of the 19 feed horns on FAST's L-band receiver across the Stokes I, Q, U, and V parameters. Using an on-the-fly mapping pattern, we conducted simultaneous sky mapping using all 19 beams directed towards polarization calibrators J1407+2827 and J0854+2006 from 2020 to 2022. Electromagnetic simulations were also performed to model the telescope's beam patterns in all Stokes parameters. Our findings reveal a symmetrical Gaussian pattern in the Stokes I parameter of the central beam without strong sidelobes, while the off-center beams exhibit significant asymmetrical shapes that can be fitted using a combination of log-normal and Gaussian distributions. The inner beams have higher relative beam efficiencies and smaller beam sizes compared to those of the outer beams. The sidelobes of the inner beams contribute approximately 2% of the total flux in the main lobe, increasing to 5% for outer beams, with a peak at 6.8%. In Stokes U, a distinct four-lobed cloverleaf beam squash structure is observed, with similar intensity levels in both inner and outer beams. In Stokes V, a two-lobed beam squint structure is observed in the central beam, along with a secondary eight-lobed structure. The highest squint peak in Stokes V is about 0.3% of the Stokes I in the outer beams. These results align closely with the simulations, providing valuable insights for the design of radio multi-beam observations.

 - **Abstract**
 The paper proposes a new approach for approximating the lateral distribution functions (LDF) of Cherenkov light emitted by the electromagnetic component of extensive air showers (EAS) in the Earth's atmosphere. The information basis of the study is a series of simulations with the CORSIKA code. To approximate the LDF atmospheric Cherenkov light the probability density functions of one-dimensional fractional stable distributions were used. The results obtained in the work allow us to propose a fast modeling method for the CORSIKA code using a procedure similar to the Nishimura-Kamata-Greisen (NKG) for calculating the LDF of the EAS electromagnetic component.

 - **Abstract**
 Current and future searches for dark matter axions, based on their resonant conversion to photons in a magnetic field, span many orders of magnitude, from the very low mass GUT-scale axion to the very high mass post-inflation axion. The higher end of this range, 10 GHz and above is challenging for conventional microwave cavity-based experiments, owing to the steep drop-off in volume and thus conversion power with frequency. We present results on a first step towards a tunable microwave resonator that can be made suitably large and sufficiently high in frequency to begin probing the lower end of the post-inflation axion mass range. The design incorporates a tunable symmetric lattice and a photonic band gap structure that confines the TM$_{010}$ mode to which the axion couples, while suppressing all TE modes to which the axion does not.
#### A Short-lived Rejuvenation during the Decades-long Changing-look Transition in the Nucleus of Mrk 1018

 - **Abstract**
 Changing-look active galactic nuclei (CL-AGNs), characterized by emerging or disappearing of broad lines accompanied with extreme continuum flux variability, have drawn much attention for their potential of revealing physical processes underlying AGN evolution. We perform seven-season spectroscopic monitoring on Mrk~1018, one of the earliest identified CL-AGN. Around 2020, we detect a full-cycle changing-look transition of Mrk~1018 within one year, associated with a nucleus outburst, which likely arise from the disk instability in the transition region between the outer standard rotation-dominated disk and inner advection-dominated accretion flow. Over the past forty-five years, the accretion rate of Mrk~1018 changed 1000 times and the maximum Eddington ratio reached 0.02. By investigating the relation between broad-line properties and Eddington ratio ($L_{\rm bol}/L_{\rm Edd}$), we find strong evidence that the full-cycle type transition is regulated by accretion. There exists a turnover point in the Balmer decrement, which is observed for the first time. The broad Balmer lines change from a single peak in Type 1.0-1.2 to double peaks in Type 1.5-1.8 and the double-peak separation decreases with increasing accretion rate. We also find that the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the broad Balmer lines obeys FWHM$\propto (L_{\rm bol}/L_{\rm Edd})^{-0.27}$, as expected for a virialized BLR. The velocity dispersion $\sigma_{\rm line}$ follows a similar trend in Type 1.5-1.8, but displays a sharp increases in Type 1.0-1.2, resulting in a dramatic drop of FWHM/$\sigma_{\rm line}$. These findings suggest that a virialized BLR together with accretion-dependent turbulent motions might be responsible for the diversity of BLR phenomena across AGN population.

 - **Abstract**
 Photons emitted during the formation of primordial hydrogen and helium atoms over the Epoch of Recombination are expected to be preserved as additive distortions to the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) spectrum. The 'ripple' like spectral features from Cosmological Recombination Radiation (CRR) have never been detected, and are expected to be 9 orders of magnitude fainter than the CMB. Array of Precision Spectrometers for the Epoch of Recombination - APSERa - is an upcoming ground-based experiment to detect the CRR signal over 2-6 GHz. While astrophysical foregrounds may be theoretically separated from the CRR signal using their inherently different spectral characteristics, instrument generated systematics present a practical problem. We present a first ever study to detect the CRR lines in the presence of a non-ideal antenna adopting a toy model for antenna beam chromaticity. Using Euclidean distance and Pearson correlation coefficient as metrics to distinguish between CRR signal presence and absence in a simulation pipeline, we demonstrate that it is indeed possible to detect the signal using a chromatic antenna. Furthermore, we show that there are different tolerances to the antenna non-ideality based on the type of chromaticity, observing location, and LST. These can inform antenna and experiment design for a practical detection.

 - **Abstract**
 The radiation reprocessing model, in which an optically-thick outflow absorbs the high-energy emission from a central source and re-emits in longer wavelengths, has been frequently invoked to explain some optically bright transients, such as fast blue optical transients (FBOTs) whose progenitor and explosion mechanism are still unknown. Previous studies on this model did not take into account the frequency dependence of the opacity. We study the radiative reprocessing and calculate the UV-optical-NIR band spectra from a spherical outflow composed of pure hydrogen gas, for a time-dependent outflowing mass rate. Electron scattering and frequency-dependent bound-free, free-free opacities are considered. The spectrum deviates from the blackbody at NIR and UV frequencies; in particular, it has $\nu L_{\nu} \propto \nu^{1.5}$ at NIR frequencies, because at these frequencies the absorption optical depth from the outflow's outer edge to the so-called photon trapping radius is large and is frequency dependent. We apply our model to the proto-type FBOT AT2018cow by {the spectra} to the observed SED. The best-fit mass loss rate suggests that the total outflow mass in AT2018cow is $M_{\rm out} \approx 5.7^{+0.4}_{-0.4} \, M_{\odot}$. If that equals the total mass lost during an explosion, and if the progenitor is a blue supergiant (with a pre-explosion mass of $\sim 20 \, M_{\odot}$), then it will suggest that the central compact remnant mass is at least $\approx \, \rm{14 \, M_{\odot}}$. This would imply that the central remnant is a black hole.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyse and model rapid rotations of polarization orientations in PSR B1919+21's single pulses, based on FAST observation data. In more than one third of B1919+21's single pulses, polarization angle (PA) is found to rotate quasi-monotonically with pulse longitude, by over 180 or even 360 degrees. Most of these quasi-monotonic PA curves have negative slopes with respect to pulse longitude. Oscillations of circular polarization fraction accompany these PA rotations. This rapid rotation could be induced by quick change of phase lag between normal wave modes within an individual pulse. We propose a phenomenological model to successfully reproduce the observed polarization rotations in single pulses, and calculate phase lags in a dipolar magnetic field of an aligned rotating pulsar, with a dispersion relation of orthogonal wave modes in strongly magnetized plasma. The weak frequency dependence of observed polarization rotation requires the radio emission height to be low, approximately 10 times the neutron star radius.

 - **Abstract**
 High-$z$ radio galaxies (HzRGs) are considered important objects for understanding the formation and evolution of massive galaxies in the early universe. However, till date, detailed studies of the stellar population of HzRGs such as the star-formation history have been scarce. Therefore, this study conducted a new survey to establish a less-biased sample of HzRGs and consequently investigate their properties. We utilized a sample of $g$-dropout Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) obtained from an optical wide and deep imaging survey made by Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC). Based on the cross-matching of this LBG sample with the VLA FIRST radio survey data, we constructed a photometric sample of high-redshift radio galaxies (HzRGs) at $z \sim 4$ for $\sim$560 deg$^2$ survey field. Consequently, we identified 146 HzRG candidates. To analyze the characteristics of these candidates, we focus on objects exhibiting the near-infrared photometry of VIKING or UKIDSS and the mid-infrared photometry of unWISE (28 objects). The results indicate that 7 objects exhibit SEDs consistent with galaxies at $z \sim 4$. The HzRG candidates have very large stellar masses with $\sim 4.2 \times 10^{11} M_{\odot}$ on average. This stellar mass is similar to that of previously discovered USS HzRGs at $z \sim 4$, though our sample is affected by a sample selection bias that selects only HzRGs with $M_{\star} > 10^{11} M_{\odot}$. Further, the SEDs of those HzRG candidates suggest a past fast quenching with a rough timescale of $\sim$0.1 Gyr, as evidenced from the rest-frame UVJ diagram.

 - **Abstract**
 The binary Yarkovsky effect on the secondary asteroid (BYS) was recently discovered to influence binary asteroid systems by pushing the secondary asteroid toward a synchronous orbit on a short timescale. However, the binary Yarkovsky effect on the primary (BYP) remains less understood, partly due to non-linear effects from partial eclipses, but could have significant implications for singly synchronous binaries. In this work, we studied the BYP effect by numerical methods and estimated its induced orbital drifting rates for real binary asteroids. We find an empirical modified solution to estimate the effective BYP: the traditional BYP formula multiplied by $(r_s / r_p)^(\alpha -1 )$. We confirm that the BYP pushes the primary towards a synchronous orbit where its spin equals the mean motion. The parameter $\alpha$ is insensitive to the ratio of the spin rate to the mean motion and decreases slightly with increasing thermal inertia. For small binary systems with a typical thermal inertia of 200 tiu, $\alpha$ is approximately 1.7. The BYP is found to affect the mutual orbit of singly synchronous binaries with a timescale typically an order of magnitude longer than that of the BYS. Drift rates induced by the BYP for known small binary asteroids (primary radius < 1 km) range from -0.001 to -1 cm $yr^{-1}$. A comparative analysis with observed orbital drift rates shows agreement for pre-impact Didymos and 1996 FG$_3$ but discrepancies for 2001 SL$_9$ and 1999 KW$_4$, suggesting complex dynamics in these systems involving the BYP, the binary Yarkovsky-O'Keefe-Radzievskii-Paddack (BYORP) effect, and tides. The BYP is changing the mutual orbits of most discovered binary asteroids. We suggest that the BYP should be considered along with BYORP and tidal effects when studying binary systems' long-term dynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 The existence of massive white dwarfs (WDs) containing more than Chandrasekhar's maximum mass has been suggested via the detection of peculiar type Ia Supernovae. It had been crucial to directly detect those 'super' (more massive)-Chandrasekhar WDs to confirm their existence. The WD's small size and cold internal environment have been a great disadvantage for detecting them via electromagnetic surveys like GAIA and SDSS. Although many WDs are detected in optical observations, none of the super-Chandrasekhar WDs was observed directly. Mukhopadhyay and his group proposed a decade ago that one of the possibilities to explain the high mass of super-Chandrasekhar WD is to exercise the existence of a strong magnetic field in the WD interior. The group also recently proposed that a high magnetic field, in turn, can nontrivially deform the star from a spherical shape. In the presence of rotation and obliquity angle, such WDs can radiate continuous gravitational waves (CGW). This opens up the exciting possibility of detecting the super-Chandrasekhar WDs with the upcoming detector LISA. However, the gravitational wave (GW) amplitude will decay with time due to electromagnetic radiation and quadrupolar radiation. Altogether, those decay mechanisms will set a timescale for detecting WDs via CGW. Even with a timescale bound, we can expect to detect a few super-Chandrasekhar WDs with a couple of years of cumulative detection, leading to the direct detection of super-Chandrasekhar WDs.

 - **Abstract**
 Gaia XP spectra for over two hundred million stars have great potential for mapping metallicity across the Milky Way. Several recent studies have analyzed this data set to derive parameters and characterize systematics in the fluxes. We aim to construct an alternative catalog of atmospheric parameters from Gaia XP spectra by fitting them with synthetic spectra based on model atmospheres, and provide corrections to the XP fluxes according to stellar colors, magnitudes, and extinction. We use GaiaXPy to obtain calibrated spectra and apply FERRE to match the corrected XP spectra with models and infer atmospheric parameters. We train a neural network using stars in APOGEE to predict flux corrections as a function of wavelength for each target. Based on the comparison with APOGEE parameters, we conclude that our estimated parameters have systematic errors and uncertainties in $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$, $\log g$, and [M/H] about $-38 \pm 167$ K, $0.05 \pm 0.40$ dex, and $-0.12 \pm 0.19$ dex, respectively, for stars in the range $4000 \le T_{\mathrm{eff}} \le 7000$ K. The corrected XP spectra show better agreement with both models and Hubble Space Telescope CALSPEC data. Our correction increases the precision of the relative spectrophotometry of the XP data from $3.2\% - 3.7\%$ to $1.2\% - 2.4\%$. Finally, we have built a catalog of atmospheric parameters for stars within $4000 \le T_{\mathrm{eff}} \le 7000$ K, comprising $68,394,431$ sources, along with a subset of $124,188$ stars with $\mathrm{[M/H]} \le -2.5$. Our results confirm that the Gaia XP flux calibrated spectra show systematic patterns as a function of wavelength that are tightly related to colors, magnitudes, and extinction. Our optimization algorithm can give us accurate atmospheric parameters of stars with a clear and direct link to models of stellar atmospheres, and can be used to efficiently search for extremely metal-poor stars.

 - **Abstract**
 The dynamic of relativistic jets in the inner parsec regions is deeply affected by the nature of the magnetic fields. The level of magnetization of the plasma, as well as the geometry of these fields on compact scales, have not yet been fully constrained. In this paper we employ multi-frequency and multi-epoch very long baseline interferometry observations of the nearby radio galaxy NGC 315. We aim to derive insights into the magnetic field properties on sub-parsec and parsec scales by examining observational signatures such as the spectral index, synchrotron turnover frequency, and brightness temperature profiles. This analysis is performed by considering the properties of the jet acceleration and collimation zone, which can be probed thanks to the source vicinity, as well as the inner part of the jet conical region. We observe remarkably steep values for the spectral index on sub-parsec scales ($\alpha \sim -2$, $S_\nu \propto \nu^\alpha$) which flatten around $\alpha \sim -0.8$ on parsec scales. We suggest that the observed steep values may result from particles being accelerated via diffusive shock acceleration mechanisms in magnetized plasma and subsequently experiencing cooling through synchrotron losses. The brightness temperature of the 43 GHz cores indicates a dominance of the magnetic energy at the jet base, while the cores at progressively lower frequencies reveal a gradual transition towards equipartition. Based on the spectral index and brightness temperature along the incoming jet, and by employing theoretical models, we derive that the magnetic field strength has a close-to-linear dependence with distance going from parsec scales up to the jet apex. Overall, our findings are consistent with a toroidal-dominated magnetic field on all the analyzed scales.

 - **Abstract**
 Interactions between magma oceans and overlying atmospheres on young rocky planets leads to an evolving feedback of outgassing, greenhouse forcing, and mantle melt fraction. Previous studies have predominantly focused on the solidification of oxidized Earth-similar planets, but the diversity in mean density and irradiation observed in the low-mass exoplanet census motivate exploration of strongly varying geochemical scenarios. We aim to explore how variable redox properties alter the duration of magma ocean solidification, the equilibrium thermodynamic state, melt fraction of the mantle, and atmospheric composition. We develop a 1D coupled interior-atmosphere model that can simulate the time-evolution of lava planets. This is applied across a grid of fixed redox states, orbital separations, hydrogen endowments, and C/H ratios around a Sun-like star. The composition of these atmospheres is highly variable before and during solidification. The evolutionary path of an Earth-like planet at 1 AU ranges between permanent magma ocean states and solidification within 1 Myr. Recently solidified planets typically host H2O- or H2-dominated atmospheres in the absence of escape. Orbital separation is the primary factor determining magma ocean evolution, followed by the total hydrogen endowment, mantle oxygen fugacity, and finally the planet's C/H ratio. Collisional absorption by H2 induces a greenhouse effect which can prevent or stall magma ocean solidification. Through this effect, as well as the outgassing of other volatiles, geochemical properties exert significant control over the fate of magma oceans on rocky planets.

 - **Abstract**
 Our study aims to elucidate both short-term and long-term variations in the light curve of the eclipsing system OGLE-LMC-ECL-14413, with a particular focus on the unusual reversals in eclipse depth. We aim to clarify the role of the accretion disk in these fluctuations, especially in long-cycle changes spanning hundreds of days. Additionally, we seek to determine the evolutionary stage of the system and gain insights into the internal structure of its stellar components. We analyzed photometric time series from the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) project in the I and V bands, and from the MAssive Compact Halo Objects project in the BM and RM bands, covering a period of 30.85 years. Using light curve data from 27 epochs, we constructed models of the accretion disk. An optimized simplex algorithm was employed to solve the inverse problem, deriving the best-fit parameters for the stars, orbit, and disk. We also utilized the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics software to assess the evolutionary stage of the binary system, investigating the progenitors and potential future developments. We found an orbital period of 38.15917(54) d and a long-term cycle of approximately 780 d. Temperature, mass, radius, and surface gravity values were determined for both stars. The photometric orbital cycle and the long-term cycle are consistent with a disk containing variable physical properties, including two shock regions. The disk encircles the more massive star and the system brightness variations align with the long-term cycle at orbital phase 0.25. Our mass transfer rate calculations correspond to these brightness changes. \texttt{MESA} simulations indicate weak magnetic fields in the donor star's subsurface, which are insufficient to influence mass transfer rates significantly.

 - **Abstract**
 Some Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) host outflows which have the potential to alter the host galaxy's evolution (AGN feedback). These outflows have been linked to enhanced radio emission. Here we investigate the connection between low-frequency radio emission using the International LOFAR Telescope and [O III] $\lambda$5007 ionised gas outflows using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Using the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) Deep Fields, we select 198 AGN with optical spectra, 115 of which are detected at 144 MHz, and investigate their low-frequency radio emission properties. The majority of our sample do not show a radio excess when considering radio luminosity - SFR relationship, and are therefore not driven by powerful jets. We extract the [O III] $\lambda$5007 kinematics and remove AGN luminosity dependencies by matching the radio detected and non-detected AGN in $L_{\mathrm{6\mu m}}$ and redshift. Using both spectral fitting and $W_{80}$ measurements, we find radio detected AGN have a higher outflow rate (67.2$\pm$3.4 percent) than the radio non-detected AGN (44.6$\pm$2.7 percent), indicating a connection between ionised outflows and the presence of radio emission. For spectra where there are two components of the [O III] emission line present, we normalise all spectra by the narrow component and find that the average broad component in radio detected AGN is enhanced compared to the radio non-detected AGN. This could be a sign of higher gas content, which is suggestive of a spatial relationship between [O III] outflows and radio emission in the form of either low-powered jets or shocks from AGN winds.

 - **Abstract**
 In binary neutron star mergers, the remnant can be stabilized by differential rotation before it collapses into a black hole. Therefore, the angular momentum transport mechanisms are crucial for predicting the lifetime of the hypermassive neutron star. One such mechanism is the Tayler-Spruit dynamo, and recent simulations have shown that it could grow in proto-neutron stars formed during supernova explosions. We aim to investigate whether hypermassive neutron stars with high neutrino viscosity could be unstable to the Tayler-Spruit dynamo and study how magnetic fields would evolve in this context. Using a one-zone model based on the result of a 3D GRMHD simulation, we investigate the time evolution of the magnetic fields generated by the Tayler-Spruit dynamo. In addition, we analyze the dynamics of the 3D GRMHD simulation to determine whether the dynamo is present. Our one-zone model predicts that the Tayler-Spruit dynamo can increase the toroidal magnetic field to $ \ge 10^{17}$ G and the dipole field to amplitudes $\ge 10^{16}$ G. The dynamo's growth timescale depends on the initial large-scale magnetic field right after the merger. In the case of a long-lived hypermassive neutron star, an initial magnetic field of $\ge 10^{12}$ G would be enough for the magnetic field to be amplified in a few seconds. However, we show that the resolution of the current GRMHD simulations is insufficient to resolve the Tayler-Spruit dynamo due to high numerical dissipation at small scales. We find that the Tayler-Spruit dynamo could occur in hypermassive neutron stars and shorten their lifetime, which would have consequences on multi-messenger observations.
#### A direct measurement of the electron density turbulence parameter $C_1$ towards the magnetar XTE J1810-197

 - **Abstract**
 We report the first, direct measurement of the electron density turbulence parameter $C_1$, enabled by 550-750 MHz observations with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope. The parameter $C_1$ depends on the power law index of the wavenumber spectrum of electron density inhomogeneities in the ionized interstellar medium. Radio waves propagating through the inhomogeneous ionized medium suffer multipath propagation, as a result of which the pulsed emission from a neutron star undergoes scatter broadening. Consequently, interference between the delayed copies of the scatter-broadened electric field manifests as scintillation. We measure a scintillation bandwidth $\Delta\nu_d=149\pm3$ Hz as well as a scatter-broadening timescale $\tau_d=1.22\pm0.09$ ms at 650 MHz towards the magnetar XTE J1810-197, using which we estimate $C_1=1.14\pm0.09$ directly from the uncertainty relation. This is also the first reported direct measurement of a scintillation bandwidth of order 100 Hz. We describe the methods employed to obtain these results and discuss their implications in general, as well as for the magnetar XTE J1810-197. We also discuss how such, effectively in-situ, measurements of $C_1$ can aid in inferring the wavenumber spectrum power law index, and hence, quantitatively discriminate between the various possible scattering scenarios in the ionized medium.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper aims to present the time-dependent coupling between the coronal model COolfluid COroNal UnsTructured (COCONUT) and the heliospheric forecasting tool EUHFORIA. We perform six COCONUT simulations where a flux rope is implemented at the solar surface using either the Titov-Démoulin CME model or the Regularized Biot-Savart Laws (RBSL) CME model. At regular intervals, the magnetic field, velocity, temperature, and density of the 2D surface $R_{b}=21.5~\;R_{\odot}$ are saved in boundary files. This series of coupling files is read in a modified version of EUHFORIA to update progressively its inner boundary. After presenting the early stage of the propagation in COCONUT, we examine how the disturbance of the solar corona created by the propagation of flux ropes is transmitted into EUHFORIA. In particular, we consider the thermodynamic and magnetic profiles at L1 and compare them with those obtained at the interface between the two models. We demonstrate that the properties of the heliospheric solar wind in EUHFORIA are consistent with those in COCONUT, acting as a direct extension of the coronal domain. Moreover, the disturbances initially created from the propagation of flux ropes in COCONUT continue evolving from the corona in the heliosphere to Earth with a smooth transition at the interface between the two simulations. Looking at the profile of magnetic field components at Earth and different distances from the Sun, we also find that the transient magnetic structures have a self-similar expansion in COCONUT and EUHFORIA. However, the amplitude of the profiles depends on the flux rope model used and its properties, thus emphasizing the important role of the initial properties in solar source regions for accurately predicting the impact of CMEs.

 - **Abstract**
 The QCD axion, originally proposed to solve the strong CP problem in QCD, is a prominent candidate for dark matter (DM). In the presence of strong magnetic fields, such as those around neutron stars, axions can theoretically convert into photons, producing detectable electromagnetic signals. This axion-photon coupling provides a unique experimental pathway to probe axions within a specific mass range. We investigate a novel observational approach using the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) to search for radio transients that could arise from interactions between neutron stars and dense DM clumps known as axion miniclusters. By observing the core of Andromeda with the VErsatile GBT Astronomical Spectrometer (VEGAS) and the X-band receiver (8 to 10 GHz), we achieve sensitivity to axions with masses in the range of (33 - 42)$\,\mu$eV, with a mass resolution of $3.8 \times 10^{-4}\,\mu$eV. We detail our observational and analytical strategies developed to capture transient signals from axion-photon conversion, achieving an instrumental sensitivity of $2\,$mJy per spectral channel. Despite our sensitivity threshold, no candidate signals exceeding the 5$\sigma$ level were identified. Future implementations will extend this search across additional spectral bands and refine the modeling used for the processes involved, strengthening the constraints on axion DM models.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a global census of metals in the Universe and their evolution with cosmic time, synthesizing robust estimates of metals in stars, hot intra-cluster gas, and gaseous absorbers tracing neutral gas as well as ionized gas in the circumgalactic and intergalactic media. We observe a 13-fold increase in the stellar metal mass density from z~2.5 to 0.7, over which time stars emerge as the most important metal reservoir at low redshifts, housing ~31% of the total expected metal density at z~0.1. Hot virialized intracluster/intragroup gas accounts for ~15% and 10% of metals at z~0.1 and 0.7, respectively. Using metallicity measurements from CCC, KODIAQ-Z, and HD-LLS surveys covering redshifts z<1 to z~2-3.5 we investigate the global distribution of metals in extragalactic ionized gas as a function of HI column density. During the period from z~3 to z<1, the global metal density of cool (T~10^{4-5} K) gas has doubled. However, the fractional contribution of the ionized gas to the total expected metal density decreased from ~20% at z~3 to ~4% at z<1. The cosmic metal density of all gas phases has increased with cosmic time, reflecting an "inside-out" metal dispersion by feedback mechanisms and galactic outflows.

 - **Abstract**
 The production of silicon monoxide (SiO) can be considered as a fingerprint of shock interaction. In this work, we use high-sensitivity observations of the SiO (2-1) and H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$ (1-0) emission to investigate the broad and narrow SiO emission toward 146 massive star-forming regions in the ATOMS survey. We detected SiO emission in 136 regions and distinguished broad and narrow components across the extension of 118 sources (including 58 UC $H_{II}$ regions) with an average angular resolution of 2.5$^{\prime}$$^{\prime}$. The derived SiO luminosity ($L_{SiO}$) across the whole sample shows that the majority of $L_{SiO}$ (above 66$\%$) can be attributed to broad SiO, indicating its association with strong outflows. The comparison of the ALMA SiO images with the filamentary skeletons identified from H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$ and in the infrared data (at 4.5, 8, and 24 $mu$m), further confirms that most SiO emission originates from outflows. However, note that for nine sources in our sample, the observed SiO emission may be generated by expanding UC $H_{II}$ regions. There is a moderate positive correlation between the bolometric luminosity ($L_{bol}$) and $L_{SiO}$ for both components (narrow and broad). The UC $H_{II}$ sources show a weaker positive correlation between $L_{bol}$ and $L_{SiO}$ and higher $L_{SiO}$ compared to the sources without UC $H_{II}$ regions. These results imply that the SiO emission from UC $H_{II}$ sources might be affected by UV-photochemistry induced by UC $H_{II}$ regions.

 - **Abstract**
 We examine the physical implications of the centrifugal and gravitational electromotive forces on magnetic reconnection in a Kerr black hole background. We find that both forces increase the reconnection rate, though the underlying mechanisms differ substantially. The gravitational force leads to a separation of charge density, breaking the quasi-neutrality of the plasma. In contrast, the centrifugal electromotive force affects the electric current by reducing the effective length of the current sheet. This reduction arises from the non-Euclidean spatial geometry observed by a locally comoving observer with respect to the rotating sheet. This phenomenon amplifies both the transport of charged carriers and the thermal-inertia effect within the current sheet, irrespective of the presence of a black hole.

 - **Abstract**
 To investigate the radio properties of the recently found high-redshift population, we collected a sample of $919$ little red dots (LRDs) from the literature. By cross-matching their coordinates with the radio catalogues based on the first- and second-epoch observations of the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) and the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-centimeters (FIRST) survey, we found no radio counterparts coinciding with any of the LRDs. To uncover possible sub-mJy level weak radio emission, we performed mean and median image stacking analyses of empty-field 'Quick Look' VLASS and FIRST image cutouts centred on the LRD positions. We found no radio emission above $3\sigma$ noise levels ($\sim11$ and $\sim18~\mu$Jy~beam$^{-1}$ for the VLASS and FIRST maps, respectively) in either of the stacked images for the LRD sample, while the noise levels of the single-epoch images are comparable to those found earlier in the stacking of high-redshift radio-quiet active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The non-detection of radio emission in LRDs suggests these sources host weaker (or no) radio AGNs.

 - **Abstract**
 Quasars are objects of high interest for applications in extragalactic astrophysics, cosmology, and astrometry. One of their useful qualities is owed to their relativistic jets: they can be radio-loud. However, the fraction of radio-loud vs. radio-quiet quasars is subject to ongoing investigations, where the statistical power is limited by the low number of known quasars with radio counterparts. In this analysis, we revisited the radio-loudness statistics of quasars by significantly expanding the pool of known sources. Our main goal was to create a new, value-added catalogue of quasars with information about their extinction-corrected magnitudes, radio flux density, possible contamination levels, and other data flags, besides their sky coordinates and photometric redshifts. We cross-matched the optical Quaia catalogue of about 1.3 million quasars (selected from the Gaia data set) with 1.9 million sources from the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) radio catalogue. We explored different thresholds for the matching radius, balancing the completeness and purity of the resulting Quaia-VLASS catalogue, and found that 1.5 arc seconds is a sufficient choice. Our main finding is that the radio-loud fraction of quasars is in good agreement with previous works (< 10%), and there is no significant large-scale pattern in radio-loudness across the sky. The exact estimate depends on the G-band magnitude limit, and we observed some weak trends with redshift and absolute optical magnitude, possibly indicating remnant systematic effects in our data sets. The cross-matched Quaia-VLASS catalogue with 43,650 sources is available to the public for future analyses. This latest census of QSOs with radio counterparts will facilitate further investigations of the dichotomy of radio-loud and radio-quiet quasars, and it may also support other lines of investigations using quasars in cosmology and astrophysics.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic rays (CRs) are fundamental to the chemistry and physics of star-forming regions, influencing molecular gas ionization, mediating interactions with interstellar magnetic fields, and regulating star formation from the diffuse interstellar medium to the creation of stellar cores. The electronic GeV component of CRs is expected to produce non-thermal synchrotron radiation detectable at radio frequencies, yet such emissions from Galactic star-forming regions remain elusive. This study reports the first statistical attempt to detect synchrotron emission at 144 MHz using the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) in the nearby Perseus molecular cloud (300 pc). By median-stacking 353 prestellar and 132 protostellar cores from the Herschel Gould Belt Survey and using LOFAR Two-Meter Sky Survey (LoTSS) data (20" resolution), 18 protostellar and 5 prestellar radio candidates were initially identified. However, these were likely extragalactic contaminants within the Herschel catalog. Stacked analyses did not reveal significant radio counterparts for prestellar and protostellar cores, with upper limits of $5\, \mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ and $8\, \mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$, respectively. Non-detections suggest strong extinction mechanisms like free-free absorption and the Razin-Tsytovich effect for protostellar cores. For prestellar cores, analytical magnetostatic-isothermal models constrain the maximum ordered magnetic-field strength to 100 $\mu$G. Future predictions suggest that Square Kilometre Array-Low (SKA-Low) arrays could detect this emission in 9 hours (AA*) or 4 hours (AA4), enabling more sensitive constraints on synchrotron radiation in star-forming cores.

 - **Abstract**
 The fine structures of solar radio bursts reveal complex dynamics in the corona, yet the observed characteristics of these sub-second bursts are additionally complicated by radio wave scattering in the turbulent solar corona. We examine the impact of anisotropic turbulence in radio-wave propagation simulations with non-radial magnetic field structures in shaping the morphology, time-characteristics, and source position of fine structures. The apparent sources are found to move along the direction of the magnetic-field lines and not along the density gradient, whereas the major axis of the scattered source is perpendicular to the local magnetic field (the scattering anisotropy axis). Using a dipolar magnetic field structure of an active region, we reproduce observed radio fine structure source motion parallel to the solar limb associated with a coronal loop and provide a natural explanation for puzzling observations of solar radio burst position motions with LOFAR. Furthermore, the anisotropy aligned with a dipolar magnetic field causes the apparent source images to bifurcate into two distinct components, with characteristic sizes smaller than in unmagnetized media. The temporal broadening induced by scattering reduces the observed frequency drift rate of fine structures, depending on the contribution of scattering to the time profile. The findings underscore the role of magnetic field geometry and anisotropic scattering for the interpretation of solar radio bursts and highlight that anisotropic scattering produces more than a single source.

 - **Abstract**
 Disk winds play a crucial role in the evolution of protoplanetary disks. Typical conditions for star and planet formation are in regions with intermediate or strong UV radiation fields produced by massive stars. The $\sigma$-Orionis cluster is the ideal site to study disk winds under these conditions; its outer parts can be used to study disk evolution, while its innermost regions to study the effect of external irradiation. For this, we analyze the $\rm [OI]\,\lambda$6300, $\rm [NII]\,\lambda$6583, and $\rm [SII]\,\lambda$6731,$\lambda$6716 lines using high-resolution MIKE spectra of 27 classical T Tauri stars and complemented by intermediate-resolution X-shooter data. We decompose the line profiles into multiple Gaussian components. We calculated luminosities, line ratios, and kinematic properties of these components. We found that the $\rm [OI]\,\lambda$6300 line luminosity and kinematic properties are similar to those found in low-mass star-forming regions (SFRs). The frequency of single-component $\rm [OI]\,\lambda$6300 line profiles reflects the expected evolutionary stage given the intermediate age of $\sigma$-Orionis. This points to internal processes contributing to the line emission. However, the highly irradiated disks do not follow the accretion - [OI] luminosity relation found in low-mass SFRs, and all exhibit single-component line profiles. Line ratios of highly ionized species of [NII] and [SII] show higher ratios than typical values found in low-mass SFRs. The innermost regions of $\sigma$-Orionis are clearly affected by external irradiation, evidenced by the lack of correlation in the accretion - [OI] luminosity relation. The broad line widths of close-in sources, however, indicate a contribution from internal processes, such as magnetohydrodynamical winds and/or internal photoevaporation. This suggests a coevolution of internal and external winds in $\sigma$-Orionis.
#### The role of ammonia in the distribution of volatiles in the primordial hydrosphere of Europa

 - **Abstract**
 The presence of a hydrosphere on Europa raises questions about its habitability, and studies of its volatile inventory can provide insight into its formation process. Different scenarios suggest that Europa's volatiles could be derived from cometary ices or devolatilized building blocks. The study of post-accretion processes, in particular the "open ocean" phase that likely occurred before the formation of the icy crust, is crucial to distinguish these origins, as this phase is likely to have influenced the volatile inventory. The abundance of ammonia in Europa's building blocks is also crucial for understanding the composition of its ocean and primordial atmosphere. We aim to investigate ocean-atmosphere equilibrium during the post-accretion period by varying the ammonia fraction in the atmosphere. Our model evaluates the vapor-liquid equilibrium of water and volatiles, as well as the chemical equilibrium within the ocean, to study Europa's early hydrosphere. We explore two initial conditions: one in which Europa's hydrosphere originates from comet-like building blocks, and another in which it forms in equilibrium with a thick, CO$_2$-rich atmosphere. In both scenarios, the initial ratio of accreted CO$_2$ to NH$_3$ determines the magnitude of their partial pressures in Europa's early atmosphere. If this ratio exceeds a certain threshold (set to $10^{-4}$ in this study), the atmosphere will be CO$_2$-rich; otherwise, it will be CO$_2$-depleted by multiple orders of magnitude. Overall, our work provides a initial assessment of the distribution of primordial volatiles in Europa's primitive hydrosphere, and provides a baseline for interpreting data from the upcoming Europa Clipper mission.

 - **Abstract**
 The stability of toroidal magnetic fields within the interior of stars remains a significant unresolved issue in contemporary astrophysics. In this study, we combine a nonlocal linear analysis with 3D direct numerical simulations to examine the instability of toroidal fields within nonrotating, stably stratified stellar interiors in spherical geometry. Both analyses start from an equilibrium solution derived from balancing the Lorentz force with an anisotropic component of the fluid pressure, which is unstable to the (nonaxisymmetric) Tayler instability, and account for the combined effects of gravity and thermal diffusion. The numerical simulations incorporate finite magnetic resistivity and fluid viscosity while reaching a regime of highly stable stratification that has never been explored before. The linear analysis, which is global in the radial direction, shows that gravity significantly reduces the growth rate of the instability and uncovers the importance of unstable modes with low radial wavenumbers operating at low latitudes. The simulations trace the entire evolution of the instability from the linear to the nonlinear phase and strongly corroborate the findings of the linear analysis. Our results reveal that in highly stratified stellar interiors, the newly configured magnetic fields remain unstable only on the thermal diffusion timescale. Combining the linear analysis results with stellar evolution models of low-mass stars, we find that the limiting toroidal field strength for Tayler instability in red giant cores decreases with the stellar evolution. The predicted field strengths align with the ones expected from recent asteroseismic observations, suggesting that the observed fields may be remnants of a Tayler instability during the transition from the main sequence to the giant phase.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate UV continuum slopes $\beta$ of 974 galaxies at $z=4-14$ using archival JWST/NIRSpec PRISM spectra obtained from major JWST GTO, ERS, and GO programs, including JADES, CEERS, and UNCOVER. Among these galaxies, we identify a remarkable galaxy at $z=9.25$, dubbed EBG-1, with a significantly blue UV slope $\beta=-2.99\pm0.15$, unlike the rest of the galaxies that exhibit red continua or ambiguous blue continua hindered by large uncertainties. We confirm that the $\beta$ value negligibly changes by the data reduction and fitting wavelength ranges for UV emission/absorption line masking. The extreme blue slope, $\beta=-3.0$, rules out significant contributions from dust extinction or AGN activity. Comparing with stellar and nebular emission models, we find that such a blue UV slope cannot be reproduced solely by stellar models even with very young, metal-poor, or top-heavy contiguous star formation associated with strong nebular continua making the UV slopes red, but with a high ionizing photon escape fraction, $f_\mathrm{esc}^\mathrm{ion} \gtrsim 0.5$, for a weak nebular continuum. While the H$\beta$ emission line is not detected, likely due to the limited sensitivity of the spectrum, we find moderately weak [O III] $\lambda\lambda$4959,5007 emission lines for the given star-formation rate ($3\, \mathrm{M_\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) and stellar mass ($10^{8.0} \, \mathrm{M_\odot}$) that are about three times weaker than the average emission lines, again suggestive of the high ionizing photon escape fraction, $f_\mathrm{esc}^\mathrm{ion} \sim 0.7$ or more. EBG-1 would provide crucial insights into stellar and nebular continuum emission in high-redshift galaxies, serving as an example of the ionizing photon escaping site at the epoch of reionization.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new scale decomposition method to investigate turbulence in wavenumber-frequency space. Using 3D magnetohydrodynamic turbulence simulations, we show that magnetic fluctuations with time scales longer than the nonlinear time exhibit an inverse cascade toward even smaller frequencies. Low frequency magnetic fluctuations support turbulence, acting as an energy reservoir that is converted into plasma kinetic energy, the latter cascading toward large wavenumbers and frequencies, where it is dissipated. Our results shed new light on the spatio-temporal properties of turbulence, potentially explaining the origin and role of low frequency turbulent fluctuations in the solar wind.

 - **Abstract**
 Presolar grains are stardust particles that condensed in the ejecta or in the outflows of dying stars and can today be extracted from meteorites. They recorded the nucleosynthetic fingerprint of their parent stars and thus serve as valuable probes of these astrophysical sites. The most common types of presolar silicon carbide grains (called mainstream SiC grains) condensed in the outflows of asymptotic giant branch stars. Their measured silicon isotopic abundances are not significantly influenced by nucleosynthesis within the parent star, but rather represents the pristine stellar composition. Silicon isotopes can thus be used as a proxy for galactic chemical evolution. However, the measured correlation of $^{29}$Si/$^{28}$Si versus $^{30}$Si/$^{28}$Si does not agree with any current chemical evolution model. Here, we use a Monte Carlo model to vary nuclear reaction rates within their theoretical or experimental uncertainties and process them through stellar nucleosynthesis and galactic chemical evolution models to study the variation of silicon isotope abundances based on these nuclear reaction rate uncertainties. We find that these uncertainties can indeed be responsible for the discrepancy between measurements and models and that the slope of the silicon isotope correlation line measured in mainstream SiC grains agrees with chemical evolution models within the nuclear reaction rate uncertainties. Our result highlights the importance of future precision reaction rate measurements for resolving the apparent data-model discrepancy.

 - **Abstract**
 The circumgalactic medium (CGM), as the gas repository for star formation, might contain the answer to the mysterious galaxy quenching and bimodal galaxy population origin. We measured the X-ray emission of the hot CGM around star-forming and quiescent galaxies. We detect extended X-ray emission from the hot CGM around star-forming galaxies with $\log(M_*/M_\odot)>11.0$ and quiescent galaxies with $\log(M_*/M_\odot)>10.5$, extending out to $R_{\rm 500c}$. $L_{\rm X, CGM}$ of star-forming galaxies with median stellar masses $\log(M_{\rm *,med}/M_\odot) = 10.7, 11.1, 11.3$ are approximately $0.8\,, 2.3\,, 4.0 \times 10^{40}\,\rm erg/s$, while for quiescent galaxies with $\log(M_{\rm *,med}/M_\odot) = 10.8, 11.1, 11.4$, they are $1.1\,, 6.2\,, 30 \times 10^{40}\,\rm erg/s$. Notably, quiescent galaxies with $\log(M_{\rm *,med}/M_\odot) > 11.0$ exhibit brighter hot CGM than their star-forming counterparts. In halo mass bins, we detect similar X-ray emission around star-forming and quiescent galaxies with $\log(M_{\rm 200m}/M_\odot) > 12.5$, suggesting that galaxies in the same mass dark matter halos host equally bright hot CGM. We emphasize the observed $L_{\rm X, CGM} - M_{\rm 500c}$ relations of star-forming and quiescent galaxies are sensitive to the stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR). A comparison with cosmological hydrodynamical simulations (EAGLE, TNG100, and SIMBA) reveals varying degrees of agreement, contingent on the simulation and the specific stellar or halo mass ranges considered. Either selected in stellar mass or halo mass, the star-forming galaxies do not host brighter stacked X-ray emission from the hot CGM than their quiescent counterparts at the same mass range. The result provides useful constraints on the extent of feedback's impacts as a mechanism for quenching star formation as implemented in current cosmological simulations.
