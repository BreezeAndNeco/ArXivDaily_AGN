 - **Abstract**
 The XMM-Newton X-ray observatory has played a prominent role in astrophysics, conducting precise and thorough observations of the X-ray sky for the past two decades. The most recent iteration of the 4XMM catalogue and one of its latest data releases DR11 mark significant improvements over previous XMM-Newton catalogues, serving as a cornerstone for comprehending the diverse inhabitants of the X-ray sky. We employ detections and spectra extracted from the 4XMM-DR11 catalogue, subjecting them to fitting procedures using simple models. Our study operates within the framework of the XMM2ATHENA project, which focuses on developing state-of-the-art methods that exploit existing XMM-Newton data. We introduce and publicly release four catalogues containing measurements derived from X-ray spectral modelling of sources. The first catalogue encompasses outcomes obtained by fitting an absorbed power law model to all the extracted spectra for individual detections within the 4XMM-DR11 dataset. The second catalogue presents results obtained by fitting both an absorbed power law and an absorbed blackbody model to all unique physical sources listed in the 4XMM-DR11s catalogue, which documents source detection results from overlapping XMM-Newton observations. For the third catalogue we use the five band count rates derived from the pipe line detection of X-ray sources to mimic low resolution spectra to get a rough estimate of the spectral shape (absorbed power-law) of all 4XMM-DR11 detections. In the fourth catalogue, we conduct spectral analyses for the subset of identified sources with extracted spectra, employing various models based on their classification into categories such as AGN, stars, X-ray binaries, and cataclysmic variables. The scientific potential of these catalogues is highlighted by discussing the capabilities of optical and mid-infrared colours for selecting absorbed AGN. (abridged)

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic rays interacting with the Earth's atmosphere generate extensive air showers, which produce Cherenkov, fluorescence and radio emissions. These emissions are key signatures for detection by ground-based, sub-orbital, and satellite-based telescopes aiming to study high energy cosmic ray and neutrino events. However, detectors operating at ground and balloon altitudes are also exposed to a background of atmospheric charged particles, primarily pions, kaons, and muons, that can mimic or obscure the signals from astrophysical sources. In this work, we use coupled cascade equations to calculate the atmospheric pion, kaon and muon fluxes reaching detectors at various altitudes. Our analysis focuses on energies above 10 GeV, where the influence of the Earth's magnetic field on particle trajectories is minimal. We provide angular and energy-resolved flux estimates and discuss their relevance as background for extensive air shower detection. Our results are potentially relevant for interpreting data from current and future balloon-borne experiments such as EUSO-SPB2 and for refining trigger and veto strategies in Cherenkov and fluorescence telescopes.
#### ALMA-IMF. XXI.: N$_2$H$^+$ kinematics in the G012.80 protocluster: Evidence for filament rotation and evolution

 - **Abstract**
 (abridged) We aim to characterize kinematic processes in the G012.80 protocluster. We principally focus on the N$_2$H$^+$(1$-$0) emission to trace the dense and cold gas. Additionally, we use lines such as DCN(3$-$2), H41$\alpha$, C$^{18}$O(1$-$0), and SiO(5$-$4), as well as continuum maps. We perform a N$_2$H$^+$ hyperfine spectral line fitting to analyze multiple velocity components and spectral parameters. We estimate velocity gradients, column densities, and line-mass profiles for the two main filaments in G012, named R1 and R2. Line-mass profiles follow $\lambda$($\omega$) = 5660 M$_{\odot}$ pc$^{-1}$($\omega$/pc)$^{0.30}$ (R1) and $\lambda$($\omega$) = 6943 M$_{\odot}$ pc$^{-1}$($\omega$/pc)$^{0.20}$ (R2), which are much larger than those of typical low-mass filaments. R1 and R2 show disparate position-velocity (PV) features. R1 exhibits a transverse velocity gradient of 10.4 kms$^{-1} $pc$^{-1}$ and few dense cores. This gradient is interpreted with a simple rotation toy model, combined with line-mass profile, and corresponds to a rotational timescale of 0.1 Myr. In contrast, R2 exhibits compact velocity structures ($\Delta$V < 2 kms$^{-1}$), likely due to collapse, as evidenced by the presence of a comparatively large number of massive cores and protostellar outflows. R2 is forming prestellar and protostellar cores at a rate of 55.3 M$_{\odot}$ Myr$^{-1}$, with an efficiency similar to the Orion Integral Shaped Filament (ISF). The R1 filament, in contrast, lacks protostellar cores and only contains a few prestellar cores, resulting in an estimated SFR of 4.2 M$_{\odot}$ Myr$^{-1}$, more than an order of magnitude below that of R2. Combining these lines of evidence, we suggest that R1 is younger and still rotating, while R2 has evolved to collapse with a higher SFR. G012 thus hosts filaments at different evolutionary stages.

 - **Abstract**
 Sunspot numbers constitute the longest and most widely used record of solar activity, with direct implications for space weather forecasting and heliophysical research. Traditional sunspot counting relies on visual inspection or algorithmic feature detection, both of which are limited by subjectivity, image quality, and methodological inconsistencies. Recent advances in deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), enable the direct use of solar imagery for automated prediction tasks, reducing reliance on manual feature engineering. In this work, we present a supervised vision-based regression framework to estimate daily sunspot numbers from full-disk continuum images acquired by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard NASA Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). Images from 2011-2024 were paired with daily sunspot numbers from the SILSO Version 2.0 dataset of the Royal Observatory of Belgium. After preprocessing and augmentation, a CNN was trained to predict scalar sunspot counts directly from pixel data. The proposed model achieved strong predictive performance, with R2 = 0.986 and RMSE = 6.25 on the test set, indicating close agreement with SILSO reference values. Comparative evaluation against prior studies shows that our approach performs competitively with, and in several cases outperforms, statistical and hybrid machine learning methods, while offering the novel advantage of bypassing explicit detection and manual feature extraction. Interpretability analyses using Grad-CAM and Integrated Gradients confirmed that the network consistently attends to sunspot regions when forming predictions. These results highlight the potential of deep vision-based approaches for operational solar monitoring, providing a scalable and automated pathway for real-time estimation of classical heliophysical indices

 - **Abstract**
 Galactic and intergalactic flows often exhibit relative motion between the cold dense gas and the hot diffuse medium. Such multiphase flows -- involving gas at different temperatures, densities, and ionization states -- for instance, galactic winds, are frequently turbulent. However, idealized simulations typically model the winds and driven turbulence separately, despite their intertwined roles in galaxy evolution. To address this, we investigate the survival of a dense cloud in a hot wind subject to continuous external turbulent forcing. We perform 3D hydrodynamic simulations across a range of turbulent Mach numbers in the hot phase $\mathcal{M}_{\rm turb}=v_{\rm turb}/c_{\rm s, wind}$ from 0.1 to 0.7 ($c_{\rm s, wind}$ and $v_{\rm turb}$ being the sound speed and the turbulent velocity in the hot phase, respectively). We find that in spite of the additional subsonic turbulence, cold clouds can survive if the cooling time of the mixed gas $t_{\rm cool, mix}$ is shorter than a modified destruction time $\tilde{t}_{\rm cc}$, i.e., $t_{\rm cool,mix}/\tilde{t}_{\rm cc}<1$ where $\tilde{t}_{\rm cc}=t_{\rm cc}/(1+\left(\mathcal{M}_{\rm turb}/\left(f_{\rm mix}\mathcal{M}_{\rm wind}\right)\right)^2)^{1/2}$, where $f_{\rm mix}\sim0.6$ is a fudge factor. Moreover, in the `survival regime', turbulence can enhance the growth of cold clouds by up to an order of magnitude because of more efficient stretching and an associated increase in the surface area. This increase in mass transfer between the phases leads to significantly faster entrainment of cold material in turbulent winds. In contrast to the narrow filamentary tails formed in laminar winds, turbulence stretches the cold gas orthogonally, dispersing it over a larger area and changing absorption line signatures.

 - **Abstract**
 We study low angular momentum, advective accretion flows around a Kerr black hole within the framework of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) in the steady state. By solving the full set of GRMHD equations, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the behavior of magnetized plasma in the strong gravity regime near a rotating black hole. The accretion solutions are obtained for a set of input parameters, namely energy (${\cal E}$), angular momentum (${\cal L}$), magnetic flux ($\Phi$), and isorotation parameter ($I$). By systematically varying these parameters, we generate a family of global GRMHD accretion solutions that characterize the physical environment around the black hole. Using this approach, we investigate whether the inferred magnetic field strengths reported by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) for Sagittarius A$^*$ at various radii can be reproduced. We find that, for a broad range of parameter values, our model successfully recovers the EHT inferred magnetic field strengths with an accuracy of approximately $10\%$, offering a self-consistent framework for interpreting near-horizon accretion physics.

 - **Abstract**
 The CCAT Observatory is a ground-based submillimeter to millimeter experiment located on Cerro Chajnantor in the Atacama Desert, at an altitude of 5,600 meters. CCAT features the 6-meter Fred Young Submillimeter Telescope (FYST), which will cover frequency bands from 210 GHz to 850 GHz using its first-generation science instrument, Prime-Cam. The detectors used in Prime-Cam are feedhorn-coupled, lumped-element superconducting microwave kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs). The telescope will perform wide-area surveys at speeds on the order of degrees per second. During telescope operation, the KIDs are exposed to changes in the magnetic field caused by the telescope's movement through Earth's magnetic field and internal sources within the telescope. We present and compare measurements of the magnetic sensitivity of three different CCAT KID designs at 100 mK. The measurements are conducted in a dilution refrigerator (DR) with a set of room temperature Helmholtz coils positioned around the DR. We discuss the implications of these results for CCAT field operations.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) of massive galaxies at ages below 1 Gyr pose a challenge to standard models of galaxy formation, which predict significantly longer assembly timescales. One possible explanation is that active galactic nuclei (AGN) drive large scale outflows that accelerate galaxy growth. To test this scenario in the local Universe, we analyzed Gaia DR3 data for stars within 5 kpc of the Galactic center, computing galactocentric radial velocities (v_radial_gc) in 27 spatial sectors covering the entire Galaxy, with radial binning of 0.25 kpc. Coordinate transformations and velocity calculations were performed using the Astropy library. We find that 21 of 27 sectors exhibit statistically significant outward motions of 3-50 km/s, while one quadrant shows negative velocities, likely related to the configuration of an activity zone and/or the Galactic bar. Both disk and halo populations also display small but significant mean expansion of 3-9 km/s (p<0.01). These results are consistent with our previous studies, where globular clusters showed outward velocities of 17-31 km/s up to 12 kpc, and axisymmetric analyses of Gaia DR3 stars indicated expansion of ~19 km/s to 5 kpc. Taken together, the evidence suggests that the Milky Way exhibits measurable central expansion, potentially reflecting AGN-driven feedback. This interpretation departs from standard theory and should be regarded as preliminary, requiring further study. However, if confirmed, such expansion could provide a natural explanation for the rapid appearance of massive galaxies observed by JWST.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent near- and mid-infrared (IR) observations reveal the existence of appreciable amounts of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon dust in the harsh environments of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), the origins of which are still under discussion. In this paper, we analyze the near-IR spectra of AGNs obtained with AKARI to systematically study the properties of the aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon dust a ected by the AGN activity. We perform the spectral fitting and the spectral energy distribution fitting for our sample of 102 AGNs to obtain the fluxes of the aromatic and aliphatic spectral features, the total IR luminosity (L_IR), and the fractional luminosity of AGN components (L_AGN/L_IR). As a result, we find that L_aromatic/L_IR is systematically lower for the AGN sample, especially much lower for AGNs with the aliphatic feature seen in the absorption, than for star-forming galaxies (SFGs), while L_aliphatic/L_aromatic is systematically higher for the AGN sample than for the SFG sample, increasing with the AGN activity indicated by L_AGN/L_IR. In addition, the profiles of the aliphatic emission features of the AGN sample are significantly di erent from those of the SFG sample in that the AGNs have the feature intensities systematically stronger at longer wavelengths. We conclude that both aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon dust are likely of circumnuclear origins, suggesting that a significant amount of the aliphatic hydrocarbon dust may come from a new population created through processes such as shattering of large carbonaceous grains by AGN outflows.

 - **Abstract**
 This review surveys recent advances in the numerical modeling of solar prominences and coronal rain achieved with the fully open-source adaptive-grid, parallelized Adaptive Mesh Refinement Versatile Advection Code (MPI-AMRVAC). We examine how these models have contributed to our understanding of the formation and evolution of cool plasma structures in the solar corona. We first discuss prominence models that focus on prominence formation and their dynamic behavior. We then turn to coronal rain, highlighting its connection to thermal instability and its role in the exchange of mass and energy between the corona and chromosphere. Particular attention is given to the growing efforts to connect simulations with observations through synthetic emission and spectral diagnostics.

 - **Abstract**
 The role of spiral arms in galaxies -- whether they enhance star formation efficiency or primarily act as material gatherers -- remains an open question. Observational studies have yielded ambiguous results, in part due to the choice of star formation rate (SFR) tracers and their inherent limitations. These limitations are addressed here by applying multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting to individual arm and interarm regions. We expand on our previous study of two galaxies to include six diverse galaxies, spanning over an order of magnitude in total stellar mass and factors of several in total SFR, for which spiral arms have been mapped. We find that the specific star formation rate (sSFR = SFR/M$_{star}$) can be used as a proxy for the star formation efficiency (SFE=SFR/M$_{gas}$), since the two quantities are directly proportional to each other in our regions. In our analysis of both tracers (sSFR and SFE) no significant difference is found the between arm and interarm regions, except for one galaxy (NGC 1097), supporting the gatherers scenario.

 - **Abstract**
 There is increasing observational evidence for a failed galaxy formation pathway for some ultradiffuse galaxies (UDGs) at low redshift however they currently lack simulated counterparts. We attempt to identify dark matter halos at high redshift within the MAGNETICUM cosmological simulations that could plausibly be their progenitors. We build a toy model of passive galaxy evolution within the stellar mass-halo mass relation to trace z = 0 observations of UDGs back to their z = 2 locations. We identify a population of 443 galaxies that match these parameter space positions within the simulation. We build two comparison samples within the simulation that follow the stellar mass-halo mass relationship at z = 2, one of which is stellar mass matched (with varying smaller halo masses) and the other is halo mass matched (with varying larger stellar masses) to our sample. We identify that our failed galaxy progenitor candidates have 1) flatter, cored dark matter halos; 2) more extended stellar bodies; 3) a larger fraction of their gas in the outskirts of their halos; 4) lower metallicities and 5) higher star formation rates than the control samples. Findings 1) and 2) are similar to low redshift observations of UDGs. Finding 3) will aid the removal of gas and permanent quenching of star formation which is a requirement of the failed galaxy formation scenario. The low metallicities of finding 4) match those observed in low redshift failed galaxy UDGs. Comparing the high star formation rates of finding 5) to recent JWST observations suggests that a starburst would naturally explain the high globular cluster richness of the UDGs. Many of the properties we find for these failed galaxy progenitors can be explained by an assembly bias of their dark matter halo to later formation times. We conclude by proposing that the fraction of failed galaxy UDGs is expected to increase with environmental density.
#### High energy gamma-ray sources in the VVV survey - III. Spectroscopic confirmation of an AGN at low Galactic latitudes

 - **Abstract**
 We aim to spectroscopically confirm the nature of VVV-J181258.71-314346.7, a candidate counterpart to the unassociated gamma-ray source 4FGLJ1812.8-3144. This object was selected based on its near-infrared photometric properties and moderate variability, as part of a broader effort to identify active galactic nuclei (AGN) behind the Galactic bulge and disc. We obtained near-infrared spectra using the Flamingos-2 instrument at Gemini South, covering the $1.1 $--$ 1.8~\mu$m range with a spectral resolution of $R \sim 1200$. Standard data reduction procedures were applied, including telluric correction and wavelength calibration. The analysis focused on the identification of emission lines and the estimation of the redshift using cross-correlation techniques and spectral template fitting. Despite a relatively low signal-to-noise ratio, the spectrum reveals the presence of Pa$\beta$ and Fe\,\textsc{ii} emission lines. The measured redshift is $z = 0.206 \pm 0.001$, which confirms the extragalactic nature of the source. The spectral features such as line ratios and full width at half maximum are consistent with those typically observed in type-1 AGNs, particularly Seyfert 1 galaxies. This study demonstrates the ability of near-infrared spectroscopy to reveal AGNs that are obscured by highly extincted and crowded galactic fields. The confirmation of an AGN at low Galactic latitude ($b\sim -6.5$°) shows that near-IR surveys like VVV can successfully penetrate the zone of avoidance. Extending this approach to additional candidates is crucial for improving the census of AGNs hidden behind the Milky Way, as well as for constraining the population of unassociated gamma-ray sources in these troublesome regions.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.04517

 - **Abstract**
 We present measurements of the dusty torus sizes of 51 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with a redshift of $z<$ 0.8. Our analysis utilizes about 16 years of optical photometric data of 146 AGNs from various time-domain surveys, including ASAS-SN, CRTS, and ZTF, along with 14 years of infrared data in the $W$1 ($\sim$ 3.4 $\mu$m) and $W$2 ($\sim$ 4.6 $\mu$m) bands obtained from the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). The estimated dust torus size ranges from 1000 to 3000 days, using both the cross-correlation analysis and lightcurve modeling through `MICA'. The measured lag has been corrected by $(1+z)^{-0.37}$, to account for cosmological time dilation and the torus temperature-gradient scaling. We conduct a linear regression analysis for both the $W$1 and $W$2 bands to examine the radius--luminosity ($R$--$L_{BOL}$) relationship under two conditions: one where the slope is fixed at 0.5 and one where it is allowed to vary. For the fixed slope of 0.5, we find the ratio of R$_{\mathrm{BLR}}$: R$_{W1}$: R$_{W2}$ to be 1: 9: 12, indicating that the torus lies outside the BLR and that its size increases with wavelength. Furthermore, we determine the relationship between torus size and L$_{BOL}$, yielding best-fit slopes of $0.413\pm0.047$ for the $W$1 band and $0.397\pm0.058$ for the $W$2 band. Both slopes are shallower than predicted by the dust radiation equilibrium model. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the torus size systematically decreases as the Eddington ratio increases, a trend that can be explained by the self-shadowing effects of slim disks.
#### Suzaku observations of outskirts of nearby clusters and groups: I. electron density and gas fraction to the virial radius

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of Suzaku observations of 14 nearby galaxy clusters and groups (z < 0.06), extending radial coverage out to the virial radius (approximately r200). The sample spans a wide mass range, from M500 about 2x10^13 to 7x10^14 solar masses, and includes well-studied systems such as Coma, Perseus, and Virgo. We carefully modeled all background components, including the soft X-ray foregrounds (the Local Hot Bubble, Milky Way Halo, and super-virial temperature components), the cosmic X-ray background, and the non-X-ray background, and assessed their effects on the derived properties of the intracluster medium (ICM). We constructed radial profiles of emission measure, electron density, and temperature. Temperatures decrease smoothly with radius, typically dropping to about one-third to half of their peak values near r200. For relaxed clusters, the emission measure profiles outside the core regions are well described by a beta model with beta around 0.6-0.7, while groups show slightly flatter slopes of beta around 0.4-0.65. Beyond r2500, electron density profiles follow a power-law decline with a slope close to 2. At r500 and r200, the electron density and the gas mass fraction show a tight correlation with the system mass, except for three clusters with bright subclusters. In massive clusters, the gas fraction increases with radius and approaches the cosmic baryon fraction near r200. In contrast, lower-mass systems exhibit gas fractions of around 0.1 at r200. The observed mass dependence of gas fractions suggests that feedback and related processes play an increasingly important role toward the group scale, shaping the connection between baryons and dark matter halos.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy observations suggest there is about one merger of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHB) throughout the observable universe in a year. Here, we introduce the methodology to search for gravitational waves from these events with Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs). Modelling the inspiral, the merger, the ringdown, and the gravitational wave memory components of the signal in simulated data, we demonstrate a proof of principle for detection and parameter estimation. We study a few representative SMBHB mergers with chirp masses spanning $10^{8} - 10^{10}~M_\odot$ at distances from a few Mpc to 100~Mpc to asses their detectability in PTA observations. Assuming the fixed binary inclination angle of $90^{\circ}$ corresponding to the maximum displacement memory signal, these signals appear distinct for a PTA with 25 pulsars timed for 13 years with 100 ns precision. We demonstrate the capabilities of PTAs to constrain chirp masses and distances of detected merging binaries, as well as to place limits. The sky position uncertainties of the order of $1^{\circ}$, which we find in this optimistic example, could potentially enable electromagnetic follow-up and multi-messenger observations of SMBHB mergers. Finally, we show that the measurement uncertainties on the parameters of simulated merging binaries depend weakly on the presence of the gravitational wave background with Hellings-Downs correlations in our simulated data.

 Jets in active galactic nuclei have to cross significant distances within their host galaxies, meeting large numbers of stars of different masses and evolution stages in their paths. Given enough time, supernova explosions within the jet will eventually happen, and may have a strong impact on its dynamics, potentially triggering powerful non-thermal activity. We carried out a detailed numerical study to explore the dynamics of the interaction between the ejecta of a supernova explosion and a relativistic extragalactic jet. By means of relativistic hydrodynamics simulations using the code RATPENAT, we simulated the jet-ejecta interaction in two different geometries or scenarios: a two-dimensional, axisymmetric simulation, and a three-dimensional one, which includes the orbital velocity of the exploding star. Although initially filling a region much smaller than the jet radius, the ejecta expands and eventually covers most of the jet cross section. The expansion is enhanced as more energy from the jet is converted into kinetic and internal energy of the ejecta, which also favors the ejecta disruption, all this occurring on timescales ~ 10^4 yr. Although a complete numerical convergence of the results is unattainable given the subsonic, turbulent nature of the interaction region, the simulations are consistent in their description of the gross morphological and dynamical properties of the interaction process. At the end of the simulations, the supernova ejecta has already partially mixed with the relativistic jet. The results also suggest that the jet-ejecta interaction may be a non-negligible non-thermal emitter. Moreover, due to efficient mixing, the interaction region can be a potential source of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays of heavy composition.

 - **Abstract**
 Type II solar radio bursts are commonly associated with shocks generated by coronal mass ejections (CMEs), where plasma waves are excited by magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) processes and converted into radio waves at the local plasma frequency or its harmonics. However, there are instances where type II bursts occur in the absence of whitelight CMEs. We analysed one such metric type II radio burst observed on November 2, 2023, characterized by split band features and fundamental-harmonic lanes. Notably, no CME was detected with space-based coronagraphs during this event. However, an intense M1.6 class flare was observed just before the type II burst and an extreme ultraviolet (EUV) disturbance was observed expanding into surrounding regions. The absence of any whitelight CME seen in any coronagraph field of view even though the EUV shock had a moderate speed of $\approx500~km/s$, which was close to the shock speed derived from radio observations, %indicates that the shock in the inner corona was most-likely produced by the very intense solar flare and the type II was associated with the EUV disturbance seen in the lower corona. These observations indicate that the shock in the inner corona was most-likely driven by the EUV ejecta seen in the lower corona, but the ejecta did not survive as a CME in the coronagraph field of view.

 These notes review theoretical models of massive black hole formation, growth and observables. They start with a brief summary of basic properties of massive black hole properties. The current view on massive black holes and active galactic nuclei at high redshift is then summarized, highlighting the JWST ``revolution'' and the questions raised by the recent observations. The notes then touch on massive black hole formation and growth mechanisms, emphasizing the processes at play at early cosmic times. Then techniques for modeling the cosmic massive black hole evolution, are reviewed with an emphasis on cosmological simulations, before approaching how observables are derived from models. They conclude with a section reflecting on the main questions on the JWST-discovered population in light of the material presented in the earlier sections.

 - **Abstract**
 Over the past decades, there has been growing observational and theoretical evidence that cosmic-ray-induced instabilities play an important role in both acceleration and transport of cosmic rays (CRs). For instance, the efficient acceleration of charged particles at supernova remnant shocks requires rapidly growing instabilities, so much so that none of the proposed processes seem sufficient to warrant acceleration to PeV energies. In this work, we investigate whether an acoustic instability triggered by the presence of a CR pressure gradient can lead to significant self-confinement of charged particles in the vicinity of shocks. We validate the expected growth rates and obtain the scale and energy of magnetic field perturbations induced by such system using magnetohydrodynamical simulations. Our results suggest a strong suppression of the diffusion coefficient for particles with Larmor radius around a thousandth of the precursor scale length.

 - **Abstract**
 When performing X-ray observations with a Wolter-I telescope, the presence of bright off-axis sources can introduce unfocused rays, known as straylight, which contaminate the detector and compromise the scientific analysis. Among the different components of straylight, single reflections off the hyperboloid section of the mirror shells often produce arc-like patterns on the detector. These arcs depend not only on the off-axis angle of the source but also on the geometrical alignment of the individual shells. In this paper, we introduce the SHell misAlignment Detection for straylight Estimation (SHADE) algorithm, a novel and flexible tool designed to infer the misalignment parameters of individual shells, reproduce the geometry of straylight arcs and predict its pattern on the detector. SHADE allows us to model each shell displacement with two parameters: $(\gamma,\xi)$ that represents the tilt amplitude and direction. While the algorithm is general and applicable to any Wolter-like telescope, we demonstrate its effectiveness using a set of XMM-Newton observations of the low-mass X-ray binary GX5-1. As a proof of concept, we recover the best-fit misalignment parameters for a selected shell, obtaining $\gamma = 21.9''^{+10.3}_{-9.02}$ and $\xi = 5.88^{+1.02}_{-0.97}$ rad. SHADE represents a new approach to diagnosing mirror misalignments from straylight patterns and can support both pre and post-launch calibration efforts and future telescope designs.

 - **Abstract**
 Twisted coronal loops in the solar atmosphere may become kink-unstable when their magnetic field lines are sufficiently twisted. This instability can trigger magnetic reconnection, leading to the emission of electromagnetic radiation, which manifests as a solar flare. Previous research has demonstrated that oscillations in microwave emissions, resembling observed quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs), can be generated by the reconnecting loop. Our aim is to investigate the relationship between the oscillations of the loop and these microwave pulsations. Using 3D magnetohydrodynamical simulations, we examine two models: a straight loop in a uniform-density atmosphere and a curved loop in a gravitationally stratified atmosphere. Using new methodology, we extract the reconnecting loop-top from both models and identify structural oscillations. We then compare these oscillations with the gyrosynchrotron (GS) radiation emitted from the simulations, which is forward-modelled using a radiative transfer code. We find that oscillations in the GS emissions are driven by sausage and kink-mode oscillations. However, the relationship between the oscillation frequencies of the GS emission and the identified loop oscillation modes is complex. The dominant mode in the former may result from interference between sausage-mode and kink-mode oscillations or entirely different mechanisms. Results such as these increase our understanding of the time-dependent behaviour of solar flares and lay the groundwork for potential diagnostic tools that could be used to determine physical parameters within a flaring loop

 - **Abstract**
 PG0043+039 has been identified as an extremely X-ray-weak quasar and as a peculiar broad-absorption-line quasar based on UV HST spectra. We took simultaneous deep X-ray observations of PG0043+039 with XMM-Newton and NuSTAR, UV spectra with the HST, and optical spectra with the HET telescope in 2022. PG0043+039 was an extreme low-X-ray-luminosity quasar in 2022. This AGN showed an extreme steep alpha_oX value of -2.47. The X-ray luminosity was a factor of 3.4 higher in the meantime in 2013. The optical and UV continuum only decreased by a factor of 1.3 - 1.5 from 2013 to 2022. Very strong emission-line intensity variations by factors of eight or more were observed in the OVI_1038 and SiIV_1403 lines between 2013 and 2022. The other UV emission lines such as Ly_alpha only decreased by a factor of 1.4. We derived a black hole mass of M=6.95*10^{8} M_solar (based on H_beta). This corresponds to an Eddington ratio of L/L_edd = 0.115. PG0043+039 exhibits strong and broad absorption lines in the UV. The highly ionized absorption lines show the largest velocity blueshifts in their broad absorption lines. The PV absorption is very strong, with equivalent widths of 7 - 10 AA. PG0043+039 shows strong Ly_alpha emission despite strong PV absorption. All the strong absorption-line troughs in the UV varied in unison in velocity space back and forward (-2000.+-this http URL-1, +2740.+-this http URL-1) without any major changes in absorption strength or in their profiles for the years 1991, 2013, and 2022. We found no general correlations of X-ray/opt/UV continuum variations with the broad absorption line variations. However, based on the simultaneous UV and X-ray observations - taken in 2013 and 2022 - we see higher maximum velocities of the blueshifted broad absorption lines in the UV when the X-ray flux was lower.

 - **Abstract**
 PKS 2155-304 is a well-known high-frequency peaked BL Lac (HBL) at redshift z=0.116, which has been extensively studied across the electromagnetic spectrum due to its rapid and large-amplitude variability. Several violent outbursts in X-rays and $\gamma$-rays have been observed in the past, with intra-night variability in very-high-energy $\gamma$-rays (VHE; E > 100 GeV) detected down to the minute timescale. The alternation of quiescent and enhanced states, observed with a tentative quasi-periodicity of 1.74 $\pm$ 0.13 years in high-energy (HE; 100 MeV < E < 100 GeV) $\gamma$-rays, makes this source a key target also for ground-based $\gamma$-ray instruments and in particular for the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes. Its brightness, proximity, and well-determined redshift make this $\gamma$-ray source a prime target for fundamental physics studies, including tests of Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV), searches for axion-like particles (ALPs), and constraints on the distribution of the extragalactic background light (EBL). In the last two years, PKS 2155-304 has been independently monitored by the Major Atmospheric Gamma-ray Imaging Cherenkov (MAGIC) telescopes and the first Large-Sized Telescope (LST-1) of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) located at the Roque de Los Muchachos Observatory (La Palma, Spain). The observations were carried out at large zenith angles (LZA; ZA > 55°), and the VHE data have been complemented with simultaneous observations in HE $\gamma$-rays (Fermi-LAT), X-rays (Swift-XRT) and optical wavelengths (ASAS-SN).

 - **Abstract**
 Pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) are prominent sources in the very-high energy (VHE) gamma-ray sky, constituting the most numerous identified source class in the H.E.S.S. Galactic Plane Survey (HGPS). They are comprised of energetic particles originating from the pulsar and expanding into the surrounding medium. As such, PWNe are of very high scientific interest as PeVatron candidates, objects that could potentially accelerate particles up to PeV energies. Additionally other aspects of their acceleration mechanism are being actively investigated, such as the open question of whether they accelerate not only leptonic but also hadronic particles, and the details of their morphology and particle transport mechanism. As PWNe emit photons over a broad range of the electromagnetic spectrum, multiwavelength (MWL) studies are crucial for the investigation and study of their emission. In this vein we present a joint eROSITA X-ray and H.E.S.S. gamma-ray study of the PWN MSH 15-52. We showcase our custom code for integrating the EDR and DR1 eROSITA data into the Gammapy framework, a python package optimised for the analysis of gamma-ray data. We present the first 3D (spatial and spectral) fit to eROSITA data by using Gammapy. We furthermore combine these data with the public H.E.S.S. gamma-ray observations of MSH 15-52, resulting in a joint physical fit of the underlying particle population, and a subsequent discussion of the physical implications of our results. Finally we give an outlook towards future efforts in MWL studies of PWNe and the broader context of MWL data analysis with Gammapy.

 - **Abstract**
 We developed the full magnetohydrodynamical analytical jet model that allows accurate reproducing of a transversal and longitudinal structure for a highly collimated relativistic jets. This model can be used as a setup for convenient solution of radiative transfer equations and modelling the total intensity and polarization maps. We show that the analytical fits are in excellent agreement with the numerical solutions of full magnetohydrodynamical equations. Our approach allows setting easily different models for an emitting plasma number density. For example, we show that the equipartition number density ranges from several to tens of percent of a total number density. We show that the Doppler-corrected emissivity distribution behave in such a way that we may expect a limb brightened intensity pattern on a sub-parsec scale and a spine-brightened structure downstream. We reproduce the broken power-law dependence of a jet pressure at its boundary from the jet radius. The corresponding power exponents are in agreement with the parabola-to-cone transition observed directly in nearby sources.
#### Exploring Low-Amplitude Variability in First Overtone Cepheids with TESS

 - **Abstract**
 Classical Cepheid stars that pulsate in the first overtone radial mode often exhibit additional periodicities at the millimagnitude level. Extensive studies of the OGLE data of the Magellanic Clouds have revealed distinct groups based on their period ratio with the first overtone mode. These groups are similar to those found in overtone RR Lyrae stars. Theoretical calculations suggest that some of the observed periodicities may be consistent with non-radial modes, while others remain unexplained. Currently, we only know of a handful of examples from the Galactic Cepheid sample that exhibit low-amplitude periodicities. The purpose of this study is to undertake a systematic search for low-amplitude variability in overtone Cepheids of the Milky Way in the photometric data of the full-frame images of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, which were produced with the MIT Quick Look Pipeline. We applied standard Fourier analysis and classified the additional signals according to their period ratio to the overtone pulsation period. We found 127 stars in total to exhibit additional periodicities. In 17 stars, these can be identified as a second radial overtone. A further 83 stars were observed to display periodic signals with a ratio of $P_{\mathrm{x}}/P_{1\mathrm{O}}$ in the range 0.60$-$0.65. In 15 stars, the $P_{1\mathrm{O}}/P_{\mathrm{x}}$ is found to be near $\sim$0.68, of which six are also found to be in the previous group. Furthermore, we observed the presence of low-amplitude signals in 22 stars outside the aforementioned period ratios. It is possible that some of these may be direct detections of non-radial modes, with no harmonic frequency peak in the 0.60$-$0.65 period range. The TESS measurements revealed that the amplitudes and frequencies of these signals often vary within a TESS sector, a phenomenon that challenges theoretical models.
#### From theory to observation: understanding filamentary flows in high-mass star-forming clusters

 - **Abstract**
 Here we use data from multi-scale galactic MHD simulations to observe filaments and star forming clumps on 10's of pc scales and investigate flow rate relationships along, and onto filaments as well as flows towards the clumps. Using the FilFinderPPV identification technique, we identify the prominent filamentary structures in each data cube. Each filament and its corresponding clump are analysed by calculating flow rates along each filament towards the clump, onto each filament from increasing distances, and radially around each clump. This analysis is conducted for two cubes, one feedback dominated region, and one with less feedback. Looking at the face-on inclination of the simulations (0 degrees), we observe different trends depending on the environmental conditions (more or less feedback). The median flow rate in the region with more feedback is 8.9$\times$10$^{-5}$ M$_{sun}\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ and we see that flow rates along the filaments toward the clumps generally decrease in these regions. In the region with less feedback we have a median flow rate of 2.9$\times$10$^{-4}$ M$_{sun}\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ and when looking along the filaments here we see the values either increase or remain constant. We find that the flow rates from the environments onto the primary filaments are of an order of magnitude sufficient to sustain the flow rates along these filaments. When discussing the effects of galactic and filamentary inclination, we also observe that viewing the filaments from different galactic inclinations can reveal the presence of feeder structures (smaller filamentary structures aiding in the flow of material). The method used to estimate these flow rates, which has been previously applied to observational data, produced results consistent with those obtained from the simulations themselves, providing high confidence in the flow rate calculation method.
