 - **Abstract**
 Precision cosmology with Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) requires robust quality control of large, heterogeneous datasets. Current data processing often relies on manual, subjective rejection of photometric data, a practice that is not scalable for forthcoming surveys like the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). We present a Bayesian framework that automates this step by integrating anomaly detection directly into the light curve fitting process. While the framework is model-agnostic and compatible with any spectral energy distribution (SED) model, here we demonstrate its application with the SALT3 model, implemented fully on GPU using \texttt{JAX-bandflux} for computational efficiency. Our method models the probability of each photometric measurement being anomalous with respect to the model, simultaneously inferring the physical supernova parameters and each data point's posterior probability of being a contaminant. Applying this framework to the Hawaii Supernova Flows dataset, we demonstrate its three principal capabilities: (i) robust mitigation of isolated outliers; (ii) automated identification and rejection of entirely corrupted bandpasses; and (iii) preservation of valid data by flagging only specific anomalous points within otherwise usable filters. We also find that contaminants are systematically brighter and bluer, which if uncorrected could bias subsequent cosmological inference.

 - **Abstract**
 We present results from a deep, coordinated $XMM$-$Newton$ + $NuSTAR$ observation of the type 1 Seyfert PG 1426+015, a source of particular interest as the most massive reverberation-mapped black hole to date ($\log [M_{\rm{BH}}/M_{\odot}]$ = $9.01^{+0.11}_{-0.16}$). The high-resolution RGS data confirm the 'bare' nature of the source, showing no evidence for absorption beyond the Galactic column, while the broadband spectrum unambiguously reveals the presence of relativistic reflection from the innermost accretion disc (in the form of a relativistically broadened iron emission and associated Compton reflection hump) as well as confirming the presence of the strong soft excess reported previously. We explore whether relativistic reflection can successfully account for the soft excess along with the higher-energy reflection features, utilizing the two most-commonly used reflection codes (REFLIONX, XILLVER). Ultimately we find that both models are able to successfully reproduce the soft excess, though in the case of the XILLVER model this is contingent on reducing the strength of the O VIII line included in the model, as otherwise this feature prevents the model from reproducing the data. The reflection models that successfully reproduce the broadband data imply a relatively high density for the accretion disc of $\log [n_{\rm{e}} / \rm{cm}^{-3}] \sim 18$, consistent with the loose anti-correlation seen from other AGN in the $\log [n_{\rm{e}} / \rm{cm}^{-3}]$ vs $\log[m_{\rm{BH}} \dot{m}^2]$ plane, as well as a moderate-to-high black hole spin of $a^* \gtrsim 0.7$. This preliminary spin constraint is strongly dependent on the assumption that the soft excess is dominated by relativistic reflection.
#### Planet Earth in reflected and polarized light - III. Modeling and analysis of a decade-long catalog of Earthshine observations

 - **Abstract**
 Earthshine observations offer a unique opportunity to study Earth as an exoplanet seen from the Moon. As the Sun-Earth-Moon geometry changes, Earth can be observed as a spatially unresolved exoplanet at different phase angles, providing important context for future observations of Earth-like exoplanets. Here, we present a catalog of Earthshine polarization spectra obtained with FORS2 on the VLT, covering diverse scenes, surface conditions, cloud properties, and weather patterns for over a decade. For the first time, we model this extensive dataset in detail using a homogeneous modeling framework. Previous efforts to model some of these spectra struggled to reproduce the observed polarization continuum, even with advanced 3D radiative transfer models incorporating satellite-derived surface and atmospheric data. We improve upon this with a 3D model that includes subgrid cloud variability, wavelength-dependent surface albedo maps, and an accurate treatment of ocean glint. Our simulations successfully reproduce most observed spectra to a much higher precision than previously possible. Our statistical analysis reveals that the spectral slope in the visible can distinguish between ocean and mixed surfaces in both reflected and polarized light, which is not possible using broadband filters alone. Polarized light at large phase angles, beyond the Rayleigh scattering regime, is particularly effective in differentiating oceans from land, unlike reflected light. We also identify correlations between cloud optical thickness and the polarized spectral slope, and between cloud cover and broadband B-R differences in reflected light, demonstrating the diagnostic power of these observations. This work highlight the potential of polarization for characterizing Earth-like exoplanets. From polarization alone, we can infer oceans, vegetation, and an active water cycle, key indicators of a habitable planet.

 - **Abstract**
 We use high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations to model mechanical and thermal feedback from AGN onto the evolution of Seyfert-type galaxies, studying the morphology of central galaxies growing within dark matter (DM) halos with masses logM/Mo ~11.8 at z=0. In Paper I, we focused on the end products at z=0, here we analyze evolution for z<10. Black holes (SMBHs) of ~10^6 Mo were seeded at z~9.1 and z~3.7, producing jets along their spin axes. Obtained SMBH accretion rates vary in the range ~0.3-10^(-4) of the Eddington rate. We compared the basic properties of galaxies, such as star formation rate, masses, gas and stellar fractions, bulge-to-disk mass ratios, SMBH masses, etc., over the range of redshifts. Our results indicate that jets and associated over-pressured bubbles have substantial effects on Seyfert galaxy evolution, including properties of the interstellar and circumgalactic medium (ISM and CGM), and even beyond. This feedback can suppress and even quench star formation, reduce stellar mass and gas fraction, modify the bulge-to-disk ratios, drive outflows from galaxies and host DM halos, and metal-enrich the CGM. The jets are largely but not exclusively contained within galaxies. However, over-pressured bubbles cross and modify the composition of the CGM and IGM, their thermodynamic and dynamic state, and generate vorticity. The CGM emerges as a complex region, where action of galactic outflows and jet-formed bubbles combines with the influx from cosmological filaments and diffuse accretion. Ultimately, the above processes affect the gas balance within the galaxy, its morphology, and gas supply to the SMBH, limiting its growth.
#### Origin of Pulsed Radio Emission from Magnetars

 - **Abstract**
 Extended periods of radio pulsations have been observed for six magnetars, displaying characteristics different from those of ordinary pulsars. In this Letter, we argue that radio emission is generated in a closed, twisted magnetic flux bundle originating near the magnetic pole and extending beyond 100 km from the magnetar. The electron-positron flow in the twisted bundle has to carry electric current and, at the same time, experiences a strong drag by the radiation field of the magnetar. This combination forces the plasma into a ``radiatively locked'' state with a sustained two-stream instability, generating radio emission. We demonstrate this mechanism using novel first-principles simulations that follow the plasma behavior by solving the relativistic Vlasov equation with the discontinuous Galerkin method. First, using one-dimensional simulations, we demonstrate how radiative drag induces the two-stream instability, sustaining turbulent electric fields. When extended to two dimensions, the system produces electromagnetic waves, including superluminal modes capable of escaping the magnetosphere. We measure their frequency and emitted power, and incorporate the local simulation results into a global magnetospheric model. The model explains key features of observed radio emission from magnetars: its appearance after an X-ray outburst, wide pulse profiles, luminosities $\sim 10^{30}{\rm{erg/s}}$, and a broad range of frequencies extending up to $\sim 100\, \mathrm{GHz}$.

 - **Abstract**
 White dwarfs accreting planetary debris provide detailed insight into the bulk composition of rocky exo-planetesimals. However, only one Kuiper-Belt analogue has been identified in that way so far. Here, we report the accretion of an icy extra-solar planetesimal onto white dwarf WD 1647+375 using ultraviolet spectroscopy from the Hubble Space Telescope. The accreted material is rich in the volatiles carbon, nitrogen, and sulphur, with a chemical composition analogous to Kuiper-belt objects (KBOs) in our solar system. It has a high nitrogen mass fraction ($5.1\pm1.6$ per cent) and large oxygen excess ($84\pm7$ per cent), indicating that the accreted planetesimal is water-rich (a water-to-rock ratio of $\simeq2.45$), corroborating a cometary- or dwarf planet-like composition. The white dwarf has been accreting at a rate of $\approx 2\times10^{8}$ g s$^{-1}$ for the past 13 years, implying a minimum mass of $\sim10^{17}$ g for the icy parent body. The actual mass could be several orders of magnitude larger if the accretion phase lasts $\sim10^5$ yr as estimated in the literature from debris disc studies. We argue that the accreted body is most likely a fragment of a KBO dwarf planet based on its nitrogen-rich composition. However, based on the chemical composition alone, it is difficult to discern whether this icy body is intrinsic to this planetary system, or may have an interstellar origin.
#### First High-Resolution Observations of Chromospheric Swirls with the Dunn Solar Telescope

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first observations of chromospheric swirls using the Hydrogen-alpha Rapid Dynamics camera and Rapid Oscillations in the Solar Atmosphere imaging instruments at the Dunn Solar Telescope. These vortices contribute to heating and dynamics across the solar atmosphere. We analyze the morphology and evolution of 34 swirls and their cospatial bright points (BPs) from the photosphere to the mid-chromosphere. To examine swirl-BP interactions and temporal behavior, we use image segmentation, Fourier and spectral analysis, and local correlation tracking. The observed swirls have an average lifetime of 7.9$\pm$5 min and diameter of 3.6$\pm$1 Mm, with a positive correlation indicating smaller swirls tend to be short-lived. 76$\%$ are associated with a compact BP appearing 12 s to 9 min after swirl formation. Swirl motion is also closely linked to their BP(s) global motions. The swirls exhibit a mean angular speed of 0.04 rad s$^{-1}$, radial speed of 17.7 km s$^{-1}$, and period of 180 s. We observe the formation of a spiral-shaped swirl driven by a BP interacting with a large photospheric vortex. The BP is dragged toward the vortex centre, after which the swirl forms. The BP undergoes changes in orientation and elongation that mirror the swirl's chromospheric development. A time lag of -42.5 s between the sudden change in the BP's orientation and the peak of the swirl's intensity variation suggests torsional Alfven waves may contribute to swirl evolution. Our results support a magnetic origin for swirls rooted in motions of photospheric BPs.

 - **Abstract**
 Large-scale galaxy redshift surveys conducted over the last couple of decades have proven crucial in deepening our understanding of structure growth in the Universe and galaxy evolution. While there have been several such surveys, until now those that achieve the high completeness and precision necessary to probe the low-mass end of galaxy groups have been limited to relatively low redshifts ($z\lesssim0.3$), with surveys exploring the more distant Universe being constrained by small sample sizes and/or low redshift completeness. The recent Deep Extragalactic VIsible Legacy Survey (DEVILS) aims to explore galaxy environment over the last $\sim6$ Gyr with a completeness level comparable to the most complete local Universe surveys ($>85\%$). In this work, we present the galaxy group catalogue for the D10-COSMOS field from DEVILS, which achieves a redshift completeness of $90\%$ for galaxies with $Y<21.2$ mag. We showcase the science potential by exploring the impact of environment on the fraction and power of active galactic nuclei (AGN), finding that satellites in galaxy groups show no evidence of altered AGN properties, while satellites in clusters exhibit increased AGN fractions but decreased AGN luminosities.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the dark matter (DM) annihilation signals from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the impact of the LMC on the DM annihilation signals from the Milky Way (MW) halo, using a MW-LMC analogue from the Auriga magneto-hydrodynamical simulations. We find that the gamma-ray signals from DM annihilation from the LMC rises above the MW foreground by a factor of greater than 100 for the s-wave velocity-independent annihilation model, as well as for the Sommerfeld, p-wave, and d-wave velocity-dependent models. We derive upper limits on the annihilation cross section of DM particles in the LMC using Fermi-LAT data for all velocity-dependent cross section models. Bounds for d-wave annihilation are more stringent by $\sim 4-6$ orders of magnitude relative to previous bounds from dwarf galaxies, and for p-wave emission our bounds are $\sim 2-3$ orders of magnitude more stringent. We also demonstrate that the impact of the LMC on the DM annihilation signals from the MW halo is greatest for the p-wave and d-wave models towards the outer MW halo, while the impact is minimal for Sommerfeld and s-wave models. The LMC boosts the DM density and velocity distribution in the outer MW halo, both by bringing in high-speed DM particles and by accelerating the DM particles of the MW, affecting the DM annihilation signals from the MW for the p-wave and d-wave models.
#### Characterizing the Time Variability of 2M1207 A+b with JWST NIRSpec/PRISM

 - **Abstract**
 We present JWST NIRSpec/PRISM IFU time-resolved observations of 2M1207 A and b (TWA 27), a $\sim 10$ Myr binary system consisting of a $\sim 2500$ K sub-stellar primary hosting a $\sim 1300$ K companion. Our data provide 20 time-resolved spectra over an observation spanning 12.56 hours. We provide an empirical characterization for the spectra of both objects across time. For 2M1207 A, non-linear trend models are statistically favored within the ranges 0.6-2.3 $\mu$m and 3.8-5.3 $\mu$m. However, most of the periods constrained from sinusoidal models exceed the observing window, setting a lower limit of 12.56 hours. We find the data at H$\alpha$ and beyond 4.35 $\mu$m show a moderate time correlation, as well as a pair of light curves at 0.73-0.80 $\mu$m and 3.36-3.38 $\mu$m. For 2M1207 b, light curves integrated across 0.86-1.77 $\mu$m and 3.29-4.34 $\mu$m support linear trend models. Following the interpretation of Zhang et. al. (2025), we model the 2M1207 b data with two 1D atmospheric components, both with silicate and iron condensates. The model of time variability as changes to the cloud filling factor shows broad consistency with the variability amplitudes derived from our data. Our amplitudes, however, disagree with the models at $\approx$0.86-1 $\mu$m. While an additional model component such as rainout chemistry may be considered here, our analysis is limited by a low signal-to-noise ratio. Our results demonstrate the capability of JWST to simultaneously monitor the spectral variability of a planetary-mass companion and host at low contrast.
#### Vanishing Refractories: Tracing Dust Evolution in the BP Tau Protoplanetary Disk

 - **Abstract**
 We present a multi-wavelength analysis of the dust of BP Tau's protoplanetary disk. We use new optical spectra of BP Tau, taken with the Magellan/MIKE spectrograph in tandem with archival UV and mid-infrared observations. We use the magnetospheric accretion model to analyze the Ca II K and Mg II 2796.4 Å emission lines and derive the abundance of Ca and Mg in the accretion flows as a proxy for the refractory abundance in the innermost gas disk. Furthermore, we used irradiated accretion disk models to compare the spectral energy distribution (SED) to observations and model in detail the 10$\mu$m and 20$\mu$m silicate features to obtain the spatial distribution and stoichiometry of the dust in which the refractories are locked in the disk. We find a significant degree of depletion of refractory material in the innermost gas disk with median abundances of $\rm [Ca/H] = -2.0^{+0.1}_{-0.0}$ and $\rm [Mg/H] = -1.30^{+0.2}_{-0.3}$ and attribute this to both radial drift and dust trapping due to a pressure bump/gap. Our SED modeling recovers the inner cavity that extends up to 8 AU, consistent with sub-mm observations. We found a significant decrease of the Mg-to-Fe ratio with decreasing radius, with Mg-rich silicates in the outer wall and Fayalite in the inner wall, consistent with the Mg depletion inferred from the emission lines.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar surface abundances are records of the state of the gas from which stars formed, and thus trace how individual elements have mixed into the surrounding medium following their ejection from stars. In this work, we test the common assumption of instantaneous and homogeneous metal mixing during the formation of the first Population II stars by characterizing the chemical homogeneity of the gas in simulated star-forming environments enriched by Population III stellar feedback. Testing the homogeneity of metal mixing in this time period is necessary for understanding the spread of abundances in the most metal-poor stars, and the (in)homogeneity of individual sites of star formation. Using Aeos, a suite of star-by-star cosmological simulations, we quantify how gas abundances change over space and time relative to Population II stellar abundances using Mahalanobis distances, a measure of covariance-normalized dissimilarity. We find that the homogeneous mixing assumption holds only within $\sim100$ pc of a star-forming region and $\sim 7$ Myr following the star formation event. Beyond this regime, deviations between stellar and gas abundances increase until they become indistinguishable from assuming a homogeneous mix of metals averaged over the initial mass function. This highlights the limited applicability of assuming instantaneous and homogeneous mixing in realistic halo environments at high redshift. We identify critical mixing scales that are necessary to explore chemical evolution in the early Universe. These scales can be applied to determine the precision needed for accurate chemical tagging of observed data and to explore parameter space with analytical models.
#### The impact of rotational mixing in intermediate-age star clusters with extended main-sequence turn-offs and extended red clumps

 - **Abstract**
 The extended main-sequence turn-offs (eMSTOs) and extended red clumps (eRCs) observed in intermediate-age star clusters challenge the traditional understanding of clusters as simple stellar populations. Recently, eMSTOs have been interpreted as signatures of stellar rotation. In this work, we test the effectiveness of rotational mixing in shaping the color-magnitude diagram (CMD) of star clusters. We computed a set of separate single-age synthetic stellar populations, referred to as "Base Stellar Populations" (BSPs), including stellar rotation. These BSPs were generated from two grids of stellar models that share the same input physics but differ in the efficiency of rotational mixing. We used an optimization algorithm to determine the best combination of BSPs to fit the CMDs of two star clusters: the Small Magellanic Cloud cluster NGC 419 and the Milky Way cluster NGC 1817. The synthetic clusters with weak rotational mixing provide the best fit to both the eMSTO and eRC features for both clusters, and are consistent with the luminosities and asteroseismic masses we derived for eRC stars in NGC 1817. In contrast, synthetic clusters with strong rotational mixing result in overly bright post-main-sequence stars, inconsistent with observations. This suggests that, for intermediate-mass stars, the influence of rotational mixing of chemical elements on stellar evolution cannot be so strong as to significantly increase the post-main-sequence luminosity. A simple test suggests that accounting for self-extinction by decretion discs in equator-on fast rotators could influence inferred rotation distributions and help reconcile the projected rotational velocity discrepancy across the eMSTO between models and observations.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a non-parametric reconstruction of the three-dimensional velocity field of the Scorpius-Centaurus OB association (Sco- Cen). Using Gaia DR3 astrometry and radial velocities, we infer the velocity field using information field theory on a 70 x 70 x 50 grid at 3 pc resolution. Our model suggests the existence of a primary stellar velocity field with a secondary field that accounts for an additional young kinematic component in Upper Scorpius and Lupus. We find clear tracers of a feedback-driven expansion of the association, while Galactic rotation appears to play a subordinate role. The results confirm the existence of cluster chains and reveal coherent large-scale expansion with characteristic speeds of 1-2 km s$^{-1}$ and local maxima of about 10 km s$^{-1}$. Power spectra indicate an excess of small-scale structure and slopes shallower than Kolmogorov, consistent with energy injection from stellar feedback. Maps of the divergence reveal net positive values, implying an approximate dispersal timescale of 10-15 Myr. A comparison with molecular gas in Lupus and Ophiuchus shows broadly consistent patterns but systematic velocity offsets of several km s$^{-1}$, suggesting partial decoupling for optically visible young stars and gas. The framework presented provides a physically motivated description of the Sco-Cen velocity field and a basis for quantifying the dynamical state and feedback history of OB associations in the local Galaxy.
#### Volatile-bearing mineral atmospheres of hot rocky exoplanets as probes of interior state and composition

 - **Abstract**
 The atmospheres of hot rocky exoplanets (HREs), should they persist, are products of interactions with underlying magma oceans. Spectra collected by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) hint at a CO/CO$_2$-rich atmosphere on the HRE 55 Cancri e, indicative of such a process. Here, we aim to identify diagnostic features that can be used to infer the composition and geochemical state of HREs. We construct a coupled atmosphere-interior model that computes the equilibrium gas speciation in the atmosphere in the system Si-Mg-Fe-O-C-H-S-N-He. The model accounts for both the equilibrium vaporisation of mineral gases and the partitioning of volatile species between the magma ocean and atmosphere. Using a fiducial planet with the properties of 55 Cancri e, we explore a parameter space that spans volatile mass fractions from 0.1 to 10 times that of the Earth, solar- to Earth-like metallicities, and 12 orders of magnitude in oxygen fugacity fO$_2$. We find fO$_2$ to be the major control of the shape of emission and transmission features. The presence of species such as SO$_2$ and the relative intensities of H$_2$O and CO$_2$ features allow to distinguish the origin of the gas, accreted or outgassed, while the atmospheric mass is more challenging to constrain. Inflated HREs, whose densities are compatible with a nebular atmosphere are rare, but a viable explanation for the planet TOI-1408 c. The majority of HREs, including 55 Cancri e, are too dense to be dominated by H$_2$-rich nebular gas yet too puffy for an Earth-like volatile budget, implying modest atmospheres of mixed heritage that are degenerate in fO$_2$, volatile mass and composition. The MIRI observation of 55 Cancri e disfavours oxidised Earth-like and reduced primoridal atmospheres alike, while the NIRCam data remain inconclusive. Future observations at wavelengths beyond 8 $\mu$m are key to discerning between potential scenarios.

 - **Abstract**
 The polarized light of the cosmic microwave background is sensitive to new physics that violates parity symmetry. For example, the interaction of photons with the fields of elusive dark matter and dark energy could cause a uniform rotation of the plane of linear polarization across the sky, an effect known as cosmic birefringence. We extract the cosmological rotation angle, $\beta$, using Bayesian analysis of parity-violating correlations, $EB$ and $TB$, of polarization data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) Data Release 6. We use prior probabilities for instrumental miscalibration angles derived from the optics model for the ACT telescope and instruments, and marginalize over a residual intensity-to-polarization leakage. We measure $\beta = 0.215^\circ\pm 0.074^\circ$ (68\% confidence level), which excludes $\beta=0$ with a statistical significance of $2.9\sigma$. Although there remain systematics in the ACT data that are not understood and do not allow us to draw strong cosmological conclusions, this result is consistent with previous independent results from the \wmap\ and \planck\ missions. It is suggestive that independent data sets and analyses using different methodologies have yielded the same sign and comparable magnitudes for $\beta$.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultraluminous X-ray pulsars (ULXPs) serve as unique astrophysical laboratories, offering critical insights into accretion physics under extreme conditions, such as strong magnetic fields and super-Eddington accretion rates. Additionally, the nature of pulsars, i.e., the equation of state of supranuclear matter, is still a matter of intense debate, basing on either conventional neutron stars or strange stars in the litterateurs. In this work, we investigate accretion columns of ULXPs based on the strangeon-star model, focusing on the thermal mound at the column base. Accounting for Coulomb and strangeness barriers of the strangeon stars, we find that the mound can reach $0.7-0.95\,\rm km$ in height with temperatures above $10^9\, \rm K$, enabling substantial neutrino emission via electron-positron annihilation. Heat transport along the strangeon star surface contributes a luminosity of $10^{36} \, \rm erg\, s^{-1} $, independent of the accretion rate. At low accretion rates ($< 10^{20}\, \rm g\,s^{-1}$), photons dominate the luminosity, while at higher rates ($> 10^{21}\, \rm g\, s^{-1}$), photon trapping makes neutrino emission the main cooling channel, with total luminosity exceeding photon emission, which saturates near $10^{41}\, \rm erg\,s^{-1}$. Estimating neutrino fluxes at Earth, we find that only the nearest ULXP, Swift J0243.6$+$6124, could produce a marginally detectable signal, while most extragalactic sources remain well below background levels. These results emphasize the key role of the thermal mound and strangeon star properties in determining accretion luminosities and neutrino emission, offering insights for future modeling and observations of ULXPs.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic field extrapolation from the solar photosphere to the corona plays an important role in solar physics research. In this work, we present a fully-implicit viscous-relaxation nonlinear force-free field (FIVR-NLFFF) extrapolation code based on a viscous magnetohydrodynamic relaxation model. The method solves the magnetic induction equation alongside a simplified momentum equation, which assumes a balance between the Lorentz force and the viscous force. Under this assumption, the velocity field driving the magnetic field evolution is determined instantaneously by the Lorentz force distribution. Through viscous dissipation, the system relaxes toward a minimum-energy state, consistent with the vector magnetogram prescribed at the lower boundary. To enhance numerical stability, we adopt a fully implicit time integration scheme and employ central finite differences for spatial discretization. The resulting system of nonlinear algebraic equations is solved using the Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov method, as implemented in the Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation (PETSc). We validate the code using three benchmark models: the Low and Lou force-free solution, the Titov-Démoulin magnetic flux rope model, and a strongly sheared arcade configuration containing a current sheet. Quantitative comparisons demonstrate good agreement with the reference solutions. Notably, the code's ability to handle discontinuities and reconstruct coronal current sheets makes it a promising tool for studying magnetic fields that may directly trigger solar eruptions.
#### Fermi-LAT Detected Gamma-ray Emission Likely Associated with SNR Kes 78

 - **Abstract**
 We have analyzed the GeV gamma-ray emission in the region of the supernova remnant (SNR) Kes 78 using $\sim$16.7 years of Fermi-LAT observations and found that the catalog sources 4FGL J1852.4+0037e and 4FGL J1851.8$-$0007c are better represented as two extended sources modeled as `2Ext'. One of them, designated as E2, is located at R.A.$=282.86^\circ$, Dec.$=-0.11^\circ$ with the 68\% containment radius $R_{68} = 0.31^\circ$, and is detected with a significance of 15.2$\sigma$ in the 0.2--500 GeV energy range. The gamma-ray emission of source E2 is well described by a log-parabola (LogP) spectral model with spectral index $\Gamma$ = 1.2 and curvature $\beta$ = 0.3. The fitting with electron-proton number ratio $K_{\rm ep}=0.01$ indicates that the GeV emission of source E2 is dominated by hadronic emission. Given the dense molecular environment surrounding the middle-aged SNR Kes 78, the hadronic scenario provides a natural explanation for the observed GeV emission. The extended source E2 can also be replaced with two point sources. One of them, designated as PTS1, is coincident with the newly discovered PSR J1852$-$0002g within the 68\% positional uncertainty circle, indicating a possible gamma-ray contribution from this PSR. The gamma-ray spectrum of source PTS1 can be well described by a LogP spectral shape. The synchro-curvature radiation model provides a satisfactory spectral fit for source PTS1, suggesting that some of the GeV emission from the Kes 78 region might possibly originate from the magnetosphere of PSR J1852$-$0002g.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first near-infrared interferometric data of a QSO at z=4. The K-band observations were performed with GRAVITY+ on the VLTI using all 4 UTs, detecting a differential phase signal that traces the spatially resolved kinematics for both the H$\beta$ and H$\gamma$ lines in the broad line region. We fit the two lines simultaneously with an updated model that includes distinct rotating and conical outflowing components. We find that more than 80\% of the HI line emission from the BLR originates in an outflow with a velocity up to $10^4$ km s$^{-1}$. This is oriented so that our line of sight is along an edge of the conical structure, which produces the prominent blue wing on the line profile. A combination of anisotropic line emission and mid-plane opacity lead to the single-sided phase signal. The model is able to qualitatively match both the outflowing CIV line profile and the systemic OI fluorescent emission. The derived black hole mass of $8\times10^8$ M$_\odot$ is the highest redshift black hole mass measurement to date obtained directly from BLR dynamics. It is an order of magnitude lower than that inferred from various single epoch scaling relations, and implies that the accretion is highly super-Eddington. With reference to recent simulations, the data suggest that this QSO is emitting close to its radiative limit in a regime where strong outflows are expected around a polar conical region.
#### Investigating aerosols as a reconciliation mechanism for K2-18 b JWST MIRI and NIRISS/NIRSpec observations

 - **Abstract**
 Recent JWST observations of the temperate sub-Neptune K2-18 b with NIRISS SOSS/NIRSpec G395H and MIRI LRS have yielded apparently inconsistent results: the MIRI spectra exhibit spectral features nearly twice as large as those seen at shorter wavelengths, challenging the high-metallicity, CH4-rich non-equilibrium model that fits the NIRISS/NIRSpec data. We perform a suite of atmospheric retrievals on both datasets, including free-chemistry, non-equilibrium, and aerosol models, using laboratory-derived complex refractive indices for a variety of photochemical haze analogues. Free retrievals systematically return lower metallicities than inferred by self-consistent chemical disequilibrium models, and the inclusion of absorbing aerosols, especially CH4-dominated, nitrogen-poor tholins, can further reduce the inferred metallicity by over an order of magnitude. These hazes reproduce the observed NIRISS slope through scattering and match MIRI features via C-H bending absorption near 7 um, while yielding particle properties consistent with photochemical production in H2-rich atmospheres. Although their inclusion improves the joint fit and reduces tension between datasets, it also significantly lowers the retrieved CH4 abundance, highlighting degeneracies between metallicity, composition, and aerosol properties. Our results underscore the importance of aerosol absorption in interpreting temperate sub-Neptune spectra, and motivate future JWST observations and laboratory work to break these degeneracies.

 - **Abstract**
 Submillimeter astronomy is poised to revolutionize our understanding of the Universe by revealing cosmic phenomena hidden from optical and near-infrared observations, particularly those associated with interstellar dust, molecular gas, and star formation. The Xue-shan-mu-chang 15-meter submillimeter telescope (XSMT-15m), to be constructed at a premier high-altitude site (4813 m) in Qinghai, China, marks a major milestone for Chinese astronomy, establishing the China mainland's first independently developed, world-class submillimeter facility. Equipped with state-of-the-art instruments, XSMT-15m will address a diverse range of frontier scientific questions spanning extragalactic astronomy, Galactic structure, time-domain astrophysics, and astrochemistry. In synergy with current and forthcoming observatories, XSMT-15m will illuminate the formation and evolution of galaxies, unravel the physical and chemical processes shaping the interstellar medium, and explore transient phenomena in the submillimeter regime. These capabilities will advance our understanding across extragalactic astronomy, Galactic ecology, astrochemistry, and time-domain astrophysics, inaugurating a new era for submillimeter research in China and the northern hemisphere.

 - **Abstract**
 The quest to uncover periodic patterns within the $\gamma$-ray emissions of jetted active galactic nuclei (AGN) has recently emerged as a focal point in astrophysics. One of the primary challenges has been the necessity for prolonged exposures in the $\gamma$-ray energy band. In our investigation, we leverage 12 years' worth of observations from the \textit{Fermi}-LAT to systematically explore periodicity across 1492 jetted AGN cataloged in 4FGL, representing the largest sample analyzed to date. Our analysis involves a robust pipeline employing nine distinct techniques designed to detect potential periodic emissions within their $\gamma$ rays. We note that 24 objects with previous hints of periodicity are deliberately excluded in the present work since they were reanalyzed in a dedicated paper using a similar methodology. Using this thorough approach, we do not find any evidence for periodic signals in the 1492 jetted AGN $\gamma$-ray light curves analyzed here.

 - **Abstract**
 With the rise of the integral field spectroscopy, we are currently dealing with large amounts of spatially resolved data, whose analysis has become challenging, especially when observing complex objects such as nearby galaxies. We aim to develop a method to automatically separate different physical regions within the central parts (1"~160 pc, on average) of galaxies. This can allow us to better understand the systems, and provide an initial characterisation of the main ionisation sources affecting its evolution. We have developed an unsupervised hierarchical clustering algorithm to analyse data cubes based on spectral similarity. It clusters together spaxels with similar spectra, which is useful to disentangle between different physical processes. We have applied this method to a sample of 15 nearby (distances <100 Mpc) galaxies, 7 from the Galaxy Activity, Torus, and Outflow Survey (GATOS) and 8 archival sources, all observed with the medium resolution spectrometer (MRS) of the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) on board of the JWST. From the clusters, we computed their median spectrum and measured the line and continuum properties. We used these measurements to train random forest models and create several empirical mid-IR diagnostic diagrams for the MRS channel 3 wavelength range, including among others the bright [Ne II], [Ne III], and [Ne V] lines, several H2 transitions, and PAH features. The clustering technique allows to differentiate emission coming from an AGN, the disc, and star forming regions in galaxies, and other composite regions, potentially ionised by several sources simultaneously. This is supported by the results from the empirical diagnostic diagrams, that are indeed able to separate physically distinct regions. This innovative method serves as a tool to identify regions of interest in any data cube prior to an in-depth analysis of the sources. [abridged]
#### Searching for radio emission from radio quiet magnetars with MeerKAT

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetars occupy the neutron star population, with magnetic field strengths of more than 10e12 G. They have been proposed as one of the most likely progenitor models for the phenomenon of energetic, ms-duration, extragalactic radio bursts (FRBs) intensively since FRB-like bursts emitted from the galactic Magnetar SGR 1935+2154. Only a low fraction of the magnetars (six in total) has been detected in the radio regime and most magnetars are radio quiet. We conducted regular observations of 13 radio quiet magnetars to probe the long term radio quietness using MeerKAT. These provide deep constraints on the radio emission of magnetars, relevant for the progenitor models of FRBs Given that MeerKAT is an interferometer, we probe the magnetars for radio emission in both imaging and time domain. We search in the time domain in a DM range of 20 pc/cm^3 to 10000 pc/cm^3 for single pulses using a TransientX based search pipeline (FRB perspective) as well as from a pulsar perspective by folding the data using the X-ray ephemeris. We use the imaging domain to search for radio emission in Stokes I and V as well as to create light curves using snapshot imaging having the long transient perspective as well. We find no radio emission in the time domain for any of the observed magnetars but provide deep limits of the mean flux density 60 uJy and the single pulse fluence of 39 mJy. From the image domain, we provide upper limits on the persistent radio radio emission and the light curve for the 13 magnetars. Additionally, an ULPT and an additional magnetar were observed in the images. We provide an extensive series of deep upper limits in the time domain but also as a novelty limits from the imaging domain for the magnetars. We encourage monitoring of radio quiet magnetars independent of their X-ray flux with high cadence for further insights in their potential for emitting in the radio regime.
#### Diversity in planetary architectures from pebble accretion: Water delivery to the habitable zone with pebble snow

 - **Abstract**
 "Pebble snow" describes a planet formation mechanism where icy pebbles in the outer disk reach inner planet embryos as the water ice line evolves inward. We model the effects pebble snow has on sculpting planetary system architectures by developing "The PPOLs Model". The model is capable of growing any number of protoplanet seed masses by pebble accretion simultaneously and accounts for differences in rocky and icy pebble composition, the filtering of pebbles by other protoplanets, the pebble isolation mass, and a self-consistently evolving snow line. The growth and bulk composition are recorded across a grid of protoplanetary disks with stellar masses ranging from 0.125 - 2.0${M_{\odot}}$ (M to A stars) and disk masses ranging from 1 - 40 % of the stellar mass. Three system architectures emerge following a low-, mid-, and high-disk mass fraction that remains consistent across stellar mass. The low-mass architecture is the only one to yield short period Mars-Earth mass cores with bulk water content spanning orders of magnitude and may be prelude to observed "peas in a pod" systems. The high-mass architecture produces proto-gas giant cores in the outer disk. The middle-mass architecture produces a bimodal peak in mass within a system, with the outer protoplanet mass at the snow line growing to an order of magnitude larger, resembling the Solar System. Solar system-like architectures appear for a small range of initial disk masses around F and G stars, but are not a common feature around K and M stars.

 - **Abstract**
 In this letter, we present a systematic search for the electromagnetic counterparts of binary neutron star (BNS) merger candidate GW231109_235456 by examining all transients reported within the 90% probability region and detected within four days of the merger. While non-detection in $\gamma$-ray, we identify two optical candidates, each associated with and residing in a host galaxy, which locate within 330 Mpc from earth; notably, one of them, AT2023xqy, is located at a distance of $178.6$ Mpc, in good agreement with the estimated distance of the GW candidate ($\sim165^{+70}_{-69}~\mathrm{Mpc}$). Near the trigger time of GW231109_235456 (MJD 60257.996), AT2023xqy showed evidence of a $\sim$15-day rise, first detected at $3\sigma$ significance on MJD 60259.097 and confirmed above $5\sigma$ on MJD 60262.088. This was followed by a rapid $\sim$5-day decline and a plateau lasting at least 50 days, with the subsequent decay unobserved due to a data gap. The spatiotemporal coincidences indicate that AT2023xqy could be a candidate for the EM counterpart of BNS merger candidate GW231109_235456, though its lightcurve is difficult to reconcile with a standard kilonova. We examine two possible scenarios to explain the origin of AT2023xqy, a BNS merger-irrelevant scenario involving a peculiar supernova or a BNS merger-relevant scenario involving a magnetar-powered kilonova under extreme conditions. Follow-up radio observations are strongly encouraged, as they may provide critical insights into the nature of AT2023xqy.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate mass transport, mixing, and disk evolution in non-radiative black hole accretion flows using Lagrangian tracer particles embedded in general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations. Our simulation suite spans magnetically arrested disk (MAD) and standard and normal evolution (SANE) states across a range of black hole spins. By tracking tracer trajectories, we directly measure both advective inflow and stochastic spreading of fluid elements. The tracer distributions are well described by a combination of coherent inward drift and Gaussian-like broadening, consistent with an advection-diffusion picture. MADs exhibit systematically faster inflow than SANEs, with retrograde flows showing the most rapid infall; the innermost stable circular orbit leaves little imprint in MADs but remains more visible in SANEs. Turbulent fluctuations drive strong radial dispersion in all cases, with a superdiffusive scaling of sigma ~ t^0.95 in MADs and sigma ~ t^0.75 in SANEs for high-spin prograde disks. Mixing times decrease toward the event horizon and are consistently shorter in MADs and retrograde configurations. Tracers also reveal how accretion sources shift over time: turbulence draws inflow from a broad range of initial radii, with rapid torus depletion in MADs driving the mean source radius outward as r ~ t^(2/3), while SANEs evolve more gradually with r ~ t^(1/2). We show that the finite mass of the initial torus has a strong influence on late-time behavior, especially in MADs, where imprints of differently sized initial conditions may be accessible as early as t ~ 10000 GM/c^3.
