 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic fields in large scale structure filaments beyond galaxy clusters remain poorly understood. Superclusters offer a unique setting to study these low density environments, where weak signals make detection challenging. The Faraday rotation measure (RM) of polarized sources along supercluster lines of sight helps constrain magnetic field properties in these regions. This study aims to determine magnetic field intensity in low density environments within superclusters using RM measurements at different frequencies. We analyzed three nearby (z<0.1) superclusters, Corona Borealis, Hercules, and Leo, where polarization observations were available at 1.4 GHz and 144 MHz. Our catalogue includes 4497 polarized background sources with RM values from literature and unpublished 144 MHz data. We constructed 3D density cubes for each supercluster to estimate density at RM measurement locations. By grouping RM values into three density bins (outskirts, filaments, and nodes) we examined RM variance linked to mean density. We found an RM variance excess of 2.5 \pm 0.5 rad^2 m^{-4} between the lowest-density regions outside the supercluster and the low-density filamentary regions within. This suggests an intervening magnetic field in the supercluster filaments. Modeling the RM variance with a single scale, randomly oriented magnetic field, we constrained the line of sight magnetic field to B_{//} = 19^{+50}_{-8} nG after marginalizing over reversal scale and path length. Our findings align with previous studies of large scale structure filaments, suggesting that adiabatic compression alone (B_{||} \sim 2 nG) cannot fully explain the observed field strengths. Other amplification mechanisms likely contribute to the evolution of magnetic fields in superclusters.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the COSMOS-Web Lens Survey (COWLS), a sample of over 100 strong lens candidates from the $0.54$\,deg$^2$ COSMOS-Web survey, discovered using exquisite James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) imaging across four wavebands. Following two rounds of visual inspection, over 100 candidates were ranked as `high confidence' or `likely' by at least $50\%$ of inspectors. The COWLS sample has several notable properties: (i) magnified source galaxies spanning redshifts $z \sim 0.1$ to $z \sim 9$, which therefore extend into the epoch of reionisation; (ii) the highest-redshift lens galaxies known, pushing galaxy density profile evolution studies beyond $z \sim 2$; (iii) all lenses are distributed within a contiguous $0.54$\,deg$^2$ region, allowing for joint strong and weak lensing analyses; and (iv) a subset exhibits lensed source emission ray-traced near the lens galaxy centers, enabling studies of supermassive black holes and dust absorption. A key innovation of our approach is the use of lens modelling to aid in identifying lenses that may otherwise be missed. This paper is accompanied by the first COWLS public release, providing JWST NIRCam imaging in four bands, lens models, pixelized source reconstructions and lens redshift estimates : this https URL

 - **Abstract**
 We model the formation of star clusters in a dwarf galaxy progenitor during the first 700 Myr of cosmic history using a cosmological radiation-hydrodynamic simulation with a realistic sub-grid star formation efficiency (SFE) model, derived from AU-scale radiation-MHD simulations of molecular clouds with varying mass, density, and metallicity. Using this model for cloud-scale SFEs, the galaxy forms stars stochastically, assembling most of its $10^6~{\rm M_\odot}$ in stars by redshift $z=8$ through two star-forming bursts (SFBs), each lasting $\sim10~{\rm Myr}$, separated by $80~{\rm Myr}$ of quiescence. Clouds reach SFEs up to $80\%$ during the first SFB, forming bound star clusters (densities $\sim10^{2-4} ~{\rm M_\odot\:pc^{-2}}$, radii $\lesssim 3~{\rm pc}$) resembling those observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in strongly lensed galaxies. Star clusters follow a flat power-law mass function with slope $\Gamma \sim -0.4$. The most massive star clusters ($10^{4-5} ~{\rm M_\odot}$) grow through mergers and have metallicity spreads of $0.05 - 0.1$ dex that roughly scale with mass. The second SFB forms loosely bound star clusters with higher metallicities: $-1.95 < \log(Z/{\rm Z_\odot}) < -1.50$ at lower SFEs ($2 - 20\%$). At $z \sim 8.7$, a nuclear star cluster (NSC) is seeded, growing $83\%$ of its mass ($ 2.4 \times 10^5 ~{\rm M_\odot}$, $20\%$ of the galaxy's stellar mass) through mergers with pre-existing clusters and the rest through in-situ star formation. The early formation of NSCs has interesting implications for seeding supermassive black holes and the population of "little red dots" recently discovered by JWST at $z \gtrsim 5$.
#### The COSMOS-Web Lens Survey (COWLS) III: forecasts versus data

 - **Abstract**
 We compare forecasts for the abundance and properties of strong gravitational lenses in the COSMOS-Web survey, a $0.54$ deg$^2$ survey of the COSMOS field using the NIRCam and MIRI instruments aboard JWST, with the first catalogue of strong lens candidates identified in the observed NIRCam data, COWLS. We modify the lenspop package to produce a forecast for strong lensing in COSMOS-Web. We add a new mock galaxy catalogue to use as the source population, as well as the COSMOS-Web survey specifications, including the transmission data for the four NIRCam filters used. We forecast 107 strong lenses can be detected in COSMOS-Web across all bands, assuming complete subtraction of the lens galaxy light. The majority of the lenses are forecast to have small Einstein radii ($\theta_{\rm E} < 1$ arcsecond) and lie at redshifts between $0 < z <2$, whilst the source redshift distribution peaks at $z\sim 3$ and has a long tail extending up to $z \sim 11$, unambiguously showing that strong lensing in JWST can probe the entirety of the epoch of reionisation. We compare our forecast with the distributions of Einstein radii, lens photometric redshifts, and lens and source magnitudes in the observed lenses, finding that whilst the forecast and observed Einstein radii distributions match, the redshifts and magnitudes do not. The observed lens redshift distribution peaks at a slightly lower redshift than the forecast one, whilst the lens magnitudes are systematically brighter in the observed data than in the forecast. Assuming the validity of the lenspop forecast, this finding motivates further inspection of the COWLS data to search for the as-yet undiscovered population of faint, high-redshift lenses.

 - **Abstract**
 We present observations of ASASSN-13dn, one of the first supernovae discovered by ASAS-SN, and a new member of the rare group of Luminous Type II Supernovae (LSNe II). It was discovered near maximum light, reaching an absolute magnitude of M$_{v}$ $\sim$ -19 mag, placing this object between normal luminosity type II SNe and superluminous SNe A detailed analysis of the photometric and spectroscopic data of ASASSN-13dn is performed. The spectra are characterized by broad lines, in particular the H$\alpha$ lines where we measure expansion velocities ranging between 14000 - 6000 km s$^{-1}$ over the first 100 days. H$\alpha$ dominates the nebular spectra, and we detect a narrow P-Cygni absorption within the broader emission line with an expansion velocity of 1100 km s$^{-1}$. Photometrically, its light curve shows a re-brightening of $\sim$ 0.6 mag in the $gri$ bands starting at 25$\pm$2 days after discovery, with a secondary peak at $\sim 73$d, followed by an abrupt and nearly linear decay of 0.09 mag d$^{-1}$ for the next 35 days. At later times, after a drop of 4 magnitudes from the second maximum, the light curves of ASASSN-13dn shows softer undulations from 125 to 175 days. We compare ASASSN-13dn with other LSNe II in the literature, finding no match to both light curve and spectroscopic properties. We discuss the main powering mechanism and suggest that interaction between the ejecta and a dense CSM produced by eruptions from an LBV-like progenitor could potentially explain the observations.
#### Relighting the fire in Hickson Compact Group (HCG) 15: magnetised fossil plasma revealed by the SKA Pathfinders \& Precursors

 - **Abstract**
 In the context of the life cycle and evolution of active galactic nuclei (AGN), the environment plays an important role. In particular, the over-dense environments of galaxy groups, where dynamical interactions and bulk motions have significant impact, offer an excellent but under-explored window into the life cycles of AGN and the processes that shape the evolution of relativistic plasma. Pilot Survey observations with the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) survey recovered diffuse emission associated with the nearby (z = 0.0228) galaxy group HCG15, which was revealed to be strongly linearly polarised. We study the properties of this emission in unprecedented detail to settle open questions about its nature and its relation to the group-member galaxies. We perform a multi-frequency spectropolarimetric study of HCG15 incorporating our ASKAP EMU observations as well as new data from MeerKAT, LOFAR, the GMRT, and the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA), plus X-ray data from XMM-Newton and optical spectra from the Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT). Our study confirms that the diffuse structure represents remnant emission from historic AGN activity, likely associated with HCG15-D, some 80-86 Myr ago (based on ageing analysis). We detect significant highly linearly-polarised emission from a diffuse 'ridge'-like structure with a highly ordered magnetic field. Our analysis suggests that this emission is generated by draping of magnetic field lines in the intra-group medium (IGrM), although further exploration with simulations would aid our understanding. We confirm that HCG15-C is a group-member galaxy. Finally, we report the detection of thermal emission associated with a background cluster at redshift z ~ 0.87 projected onto the IGrM of HCG15, which matches the position and redshift of the recent SZ detection of ACT-CL J0207.8+0209.

 - **Abstract**
 Modern astronomical surveys detect asteroids by linking together their appearances across multiple images taken over time. This approach faces limitations in detecting faint asteroids and handling the computational complexity of trajectory linking. We present a novel method that adapts ``digital tracking" - traditionally used for short-term linear asteroid motion across images - to work with large-scale synoptic surveys such as the Vera Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (Rubin/LSST). Our approach combines hundreds of sparse observations of individual asteroids across their non-linear orbital paths to enhance detection sensitivity by several magnitudes. To address the computational challenges of processing massive data sets and dense orbital phase spaces, we developed a specialized high-performance computing architecture. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through experiments that take advantage of the extensive computational resources at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. This work enables the detection of significantly fainter asteroids in existing and future survey data, potentially increasing the observable asteroid population by orders of magnitude across different orbital families, from near-Earth objects (NEOs) to Kuiper belt objects (KBOs).

 - **Abstract**
 Sub-Neptunes have been found to be one of the most common types of exoplanets, yet their physical parameters and properties are poorly determined and in need of further investigation. In order to improve the mass measurement and parameter determination of two sub-Neptunes, K2-266 d and K2-266 e, we present new transit observations obtained with CHaracterising ExOPlanets Satellite (CHEOPS) and Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), increasing the baseline of transit data from a few epochs to 165 epochs for K2-266 d, and to 121 epochs for K2-266 e. Through a two-stage fitting process, it is found that the masses of K2-266 d and K2-266 e are 6.01$\pm$0.43 $M_\oplus$ and 7.70$\pm$0.58 $M_\oplus$, respectively. With these updated values and one order of magnitude better precision, we confirm the planets to belong to the population of planets that has been determined to be volatile-rich. Finally, we present the results of dynamical simulations, showing that the system is stable, the orbits are not chaotic, and that these two planets are close to but not in 4:3 mean motion resonance.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast Radio Bursts are millisecond-duration bursts originating from distant sources. They are classified into two categories: non-repeating FRBs, which manifest as singular events, and repeating FRBs, which emit multiple bursts over time In this work, we report a search for X- and Gamma-ray counterparts to a selected sample of R-FRBs using data from the Agile satellite. The sample focused on sources with an excess dispersion measure below $300 \, {\rm pc \, cm^{-3}}$. The analysis focused on the bursts covered by AGILE Mini-Calorimeter high resolution data. No astrophysical signals were identified, and we derived upper limits on the flux above 400 keV for the associated sources adopting a spectral magnetar model, one of the leading models for FRB emission. Moreover, for a single burst of FRB 20200120E we estimated the flux UL from the SuperAGILE detector data in the $18-60$ keV. We performed also a check of the GRID coverage for each burst in the $0.03 - 10$ GeV energy band on short timescales, from $10$ to $10^3$ s, and on longer ones including the complete $\sim$17 years AGILE/GRID archive. We then considered the famous event FRB 200428 from the galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154 as reference to extrapolate a possible X-ray emission in MCAL and SuperAGILE bands, from the radio energies of R-FRBs using the E$_{\mathrm{X}}$/E$_{\mathrm{radio}}$ of FRB 200428 as fixed parameter. We compared these energies with historical magnetar X-ray bursts rescaled in the same bands. Our observations set useful constraints on the FRB magnetar model in particular, the MCAL ULs are currently the most stringent in the 0.4--30 MeV band
#### Flares in the Changing Look AGN Mrk 590. II: Deep X-ray observations reveal a Comptonizing inner accretion flow

 - **Abstract**
 Mrk 590 is a Changing Look AGN currently in an unusual repeat X-ray and UV flaring state. Here, we report on deep X-ray observations with XMM-Newton, NuSTAR, and NICER, obtained at a range of X-ray flux levels. We detect a prominent soft excess below 2 keV; its flux is tightly correlated with that of both the X-ray and UV continuum, and it persists at the lowest flux levels captured. Our Bayesian model comparison strongly favors inverse Comptonization as the origin of this soft excess, instead of blurred reflection. We find only weak reflection features, with R~0.4 assuming Compton-thick reflection. Most of this reprocessing occurs at least $\sim$800 gravitational radii (roughly three light-days) from the continuum source. Relativistically broadened emission is weak or absent, suggesting the lack of a standard `thin disk' at small radii. We confirm that the predicted broad-band emission due to Comptonization is roughly consistent with the observed UV--optical photometry. This implies an optically thick, warm ($kT_e\sim0.3$ keV) scattering region that extends to at least $\sim10^3$ gravitational radii, reprocessing any UV thermal emission. The lack of a standard `thin disk' may also explain the puzzling $\sim3$-day X-ray to UV delay previously measured for Mrk 590. Overall, we find that the X-ray spectral changes in Mrk 590 are minimal, despite substantial luminosity changes. Other well-studied changing look AGN display more dramatic spectral evolution, e.g., disappearing continuum or soft excess. This suggests that a diversity of physical mechanisms in the inner accretion flow may produce a UV--optical changing-look event.

 - **Abstract**
 Over the last years, a number of broadband reverberation mapping campaigns have been conducted to explore the short-term UV and optical variability of nearby AGN. Despite the extensive data collected, the origin of the observed variability is still debated in the literature. Frequency-resolved time lags offer a promising approach to distinguish between different scenarios, as they probe variability on different time scales. In this study, we present the expected frequency-resolved lags resulting from X-ray reprocessing in the accretion disk. The predicted lags are found to feature a general shape that resembles that of observational measurements, while exhibiting strong dependence on various physical parameters. Additionally, we compare our model predictions to observational data for the case of NGC 5548, concluding that the X-ray illumination of the disk can effectively account for the observed frequency-resolved lags and power spectra in a self-consistent way. To date, X-ray disk reprocessing is the only physical model that has successfully reproduced the observed multi-wavelength variability, in both amplitude and time delays, across a range of temporal frequencies.

 - **Abstract**
 Low-luminosity Active Galactic Nuclei (LLAGN) represent a unique class of AGN in the local universe. Extensive studies of these objects are essential for a comprehensive understanding of jet physics, as past research has largely focused on more powerful radio sources. In this report, we present our recent VLBI studies of two prominent nearby LLAGN, NGC 4261 and M104 (the Sombrero galaxy). Specifically, we address the kinematics, collimation, and fundamental physical parameters of their jets, and probe the possible origin of the radio emission at millimeter wavelengths.
#### ASKAP and VLASS search for a radio-continuum counterpart of ultra-high-energy neutrino event KM3-230213A

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of an Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) 944 MHz and Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) 3~GHz search for a radio-continuum counterpart of the recent ultra-high-energy (UHE) neutrino event, KM3-230213A. Using (ASKAP), we catalog 1052 radio sources within the 1.5$^\circ$ radius search area (68% certainty region) around the particle's calculated origin, 10 of which we classify as blazar candidates based on their radio spectra. The most prominent radio source in the search area is the nearby spiral galaxy UGCA 127 (nicknamed Phaedra, From Greek: $\phi\alpha i\delta\rho\alpha$, a Cretan princess of Greek Mythology, derived from Phaidros, Greek: ${\phi}{\alpha}{\iota}{\delta}{\rho}o{\varsigma}$, meaning 'bright'.). Its non-thermal radio spectrum classifies it as a non-blazar active galactic nucleus (AGN). We also present an extended radio source, WISEA J061715.89-075455.4 (nicknamed Hebe, From Greek: $H{\beta}{\eta}$, the Greek goddess of youth.), located only ~7' from the geometric center of the search area, with a very unusual highly polarized compact component. Finally, we present a strong radio source, EMU J062248-072246 (nicknamed Narcissus, From Greek $N{\alpha}{\rho}{\kappa}{\iota}{\sigma}{\sigma}o{\zeta}$ was a self-absorbed hunter from Thespiae in Boeotia.), which has a maximum self-absorption spectral slope of +2.5 at low frequencies, and exhibits ~25% flux density variability over the ~5-year VLASS 3~GHz survey.

 - **Abstract**
 We aim to study the polarization and magnetic field properties of the SNR HB 9 using new 21-cm continuum cube data from the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio telescope (FAST). We computed the Faraday depth at 21 cm, and re-analyzed the rotation measures (RMs) of HB 9 using in addition Effelsberg 2695-MHz and Urumqi 4800-MHz polarization data. FAST total-intensity images of two subbands are decomposed into components of multiple angular scales to check spectral-index variation via temperature versus temperature plots (TT-plots). The filamentary emission has a spectral index ($S\sim\nu^{\alpha}$) of $\alpha=-$0.52, corresponding to freshly accelerated relativistic electrons. The diffuse emission has a steeper spectrum of $\alpha=-$0.63, corresponding to confined electrons that are no longer accelerated. The FAST detected 1385-MHz polarized emission might come from a thin layer in the outer envelope of the shells, with a Faraday depth of 4-28 rad m$^{-2}$ from the Faraday rotation synthesis result. The RMs derived from the Effelsberg 2695-MHz and Urumqi 4800-MHz polarization data show about 70 rad m$^{-2}$ in the eastern and northern shell, and 124 rad m$^{-2}$ in the inner and southern patches. The regular magnetic field is about 5$-$8 $\mu$G over the remnant. The northern shell shows depolarization at 2695 MHz relative to the 4800-MHz polarization data, indicating an additional random magnetic field of 12 $\mu$G on the scale of 0.6 pc. The shock wave might have entered the dense gas environment in the northern-shell region and has driven turbulence to cause depolarization at 2695 MHz.
#### The role of Trees of Fragmenting Granules (TFG) in the formation of the solar supergranular pattern from Hinode observations

 - **Abstract**
 We present in this paper an exceptional scientific dataset allowing to investigate the structure and evolution of the interior of solar supergranulation cells. Trees of Fragmenting Granules (TFG) and associated flows were evidenced using Local Correlation Tracking techniques (LCT) from a 24 H duration sequence of Hinode (JAXA/NASA) observations. The treatment of the dataset exhibits the evolution of the TFG and shows that their mutual interactions are able to build horizontal flows with longer lifetime than granules (1 to 2 hours) over a scale of 10 arcsec (the mesogranulation). These flows act on the diffusion of the intranetwork magnetic elements and also on the location and shape of the network. Hence, the TFG appear as one of the major elements involved in supergranular formation and evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Multifrequency polarimetry, recently extended to the X-ray band thanks to the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) satellite, is an essential tool for understanding blazar jets. High-frequency-peaked BL Lacs (HBLs) and extreme high-frequency-peaked BL Lacs (EHBLs) are especially interesting because the polarimetric properties of their synchrotron emission, extending up to the X-ray band, can be fully tracked by sensitive polarimetric measurements. We investigated the polarization properties of the synchrotron emission of these sources, starting directly from relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of recollimated relativistic jets. To bridge the gap between fluid and kinetic scales, we elaborated a post-processing code based on the Lagrangian macroparticle approach, which models the spectral evolution and emission of non-thermal particles within the jet given the local fluid conditions. When comparing our results with early particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, we find that shocks formed through jet recollimation are primarily superluminal, limiting particle acceleration in a laminar flow. However, recent PIC simulations suggest that acceleration can occur in the presence of small-scale turbulence or inhomogeneities even in superluminal configuration. In this case, we reproduce the observed polarization chromaticity (i.e. the polarization degree increases with frequency), along with a stable polarization angle between the X-ray and optical bands. This study sheds light on the role of recollimation shocks in blazar jets and supports the energy-stratified shock model as a plausible explanation for IXPE observations.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel approach using neural networks to recover X-ray spectral model parameters and quantify uncertainties, balancing accuracy and computational efficiency against traditional frequentist and Bayesian methods. Frequentist techniques often fall into local minima, compromising parameter estimation, while Bayesian methods, though more reliable, suffer from high computational costs. To address these challenges, we apply Monte Carlo Dropout within various neural network architectures trained on simulated spectra generated from a multiparameter emission model convolved with an instrument response. The model parameters are sampled from a predefined prior, and our proof of concept is illustrated using simulated data based on the NICER response matrix for simple emission models with up to five parameters. Our method delivers well-defined posterior distributions comparable to Bayesian inference, achieves accuracy akin to conventional spectral fitting, and is significantly less prone to local minima, thereby reducing the risk of selecting parameter outliers. Moreover, the approach improves computational speed by roughly an order of magnitude compared to traditional Bayesian techniques. This work demonstrates the potential of neural network-based methods as a robust alternative for X-ray spectral analysis, particularly in the context of future astronomical missions expected to generate extensive datasets.

 - **Abstract**
 After exploring the infrared softness diagram to characterize the hardness of the incident ionizing radiation in star-forming regions, we exploit the availability of high-excitation lines in the same spectral regime to explore its use for studying the narrow-line regions in AGN. We adapted the IR softness diagram to consider very high-excitation lines, such as [Ne V] 14.3,24.3 $\mu$m or [O IV] 25.9$\mu$m. The measured emission-line ratios were included as inputs for the code HCm-Teff-IR, in order to provide a quantification for both the ionization and the $\alpha_{\rm OX}$ parameters. The latter is sensitive to the spectral shape of the incident continuum in AGN. We applied this to a large AGN sample including different spectral types with available Spitzer/IRS, Herschel/PACS and/or SOFIA/FIFI-LS mid-IR spectroscopic observations. The combination of the ([Ne II] 12.8 $\mu$m+[Ne III] 15.6$\mu$m)/[Ne V] 14.3$\mu$m and [O III] 52,88 $\mu$m/[O IV] 25.9$\mu$m emission line ratios is a robust proxy for the shape of the ionizing continuum in AGN. An alternative based on the [S III] 18.7 $\mu$m+[S IV] 10.5$\mu$m lines can be used instead. The inclusion of very high-excitation lines in HCm-Teff-IR, to derive both $\alpha_{\rm OX}$ and $U$ for the studied sample, points to a bimodal distribution of galaxies. One of the peaks is characterized by relatively harder values of $\alpha_{\rm OX}$ around -1.4 in combination with low values for log $U$ around -2.4, while the other peak shows a softer $\alpha_{\rm OX}$ around -1.7 and high values of log $U$ around-1.5. This result is consistent with the existence of two very marked AGN populations., one with a softer ionizing continuum, possibly dominated by a radiatively efficient accretion disk in bright Seyfert nuclei. In contrast, we observe a harder radiation field in low-luminosity AGN, where the accretion disk is expected to recede.

 - **Abstract**
 Astrophysical compact objects, such as magnetars, neutron star mergers, etc, have strong electromagnetic fields beyond the Schwinger field ($B_c = 4.4 \times 10^{13}\, {\rm G}$). In strong electric fields, electron-positron pairs are produced from the vacuum, gamma rays create electron-positron pairs in strong magnetic fields, and propagating photons experience vacuum refringence, etc. Astrophysical compact objects with strong electromagnetic fields open a window for probing fundamental physics beyond weak field QED. Ultra-intense lasers and high-energy charged particles may simulate extreme astrophysical phenomena.
#### Secondary black hole-induced magnetic reconnection in OJ 287: Implications for X-ray and radio emission

 - **Abstract**
 OJ 287, a nearby blazar, has exhibited remarkable variability in its optical light curve since 1888, characterized by ~12-year quasi-periodic outbursts. These events are attributed to the orbital dynamics of a supermassive binary black hole system at the heart of the blazar. This study explores the role of magnetic reconnection and the formation of plasmoid chains in driving the energetic processes responsible for OJ 287's variability. We propose that the passage of the secondary black hole through the magnetic field of the primary black hole's accretion disk triggers magnetic reconnection, which contributes to the observed X-ray and radio emission features in OJ 287. We explore the connection between binary black hole interactions, accretion disk dynamics, and the formation of plasmoid chains as the secondary black hole passes through the magnetic field forest from the accretion disk and the jet of the primary. Our approach relies on numerical simulations to understand the formation of plasmoid chains resulting from black hole interactions and accretion disk dynamics. Based on such results, we employ simulation outcomes to examine the potential contribution to observed emissions, validating our assumptions about plasmoid chain creation. With this idea, we aim to establish a direct link between numerical simulations and observed emission, particularly in the case of OJ 287. Our findings confirm that the formation of plasmoid chains coincides with specific anomalous emission events observed in OJ 287. Notably, the radio emission patterns cannot be explained by a single blob model, as the necessary size to mitigate synchrotron self-absorption would be too large. This highlights the complexity of the emission processes and suggests that plasmoid chains could contribute to additional emission components beyond the steady jet.

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate atomic models for astrophysical plasma can be very complex, requiring thousands of states. However, for a variety of applications such as large-scale forward models of the Stokes parameters of a spectral line in the solar corona, it is necessary to build much reduced atomic models. We present two examples of such models, focused on the two near-infrared Fe XIII lines observed on the ground at 10750, 10801 Angstroms. These lines are primary diagnostics for a range of missions (especially the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope, DKIST) to measure electron densities and magnetic fields in the solar corona. We calculate the Stokes parameters for a range of coronal conditions using CHIANTI (for intensities) and P-CORONA (for intensities and polarization), and use P-CORONA and a realistic global MHD simulation to show that the reduced models provide accurate results, typically to within 5% those obtained with larger models. Reduced models provide a significant decrease (over three orders of magnitude) in the computational time in spectropolarimetric calculations. The methods we describe are general and can be applied to a range of conditions and other ions.
#### Hints of Primordial Magnetic Fields at Recombination and Implications for the Hubble Tension

 - **Abstract**
 Primordial Magnetic Fields (PMFs), long studied as potential relics of the early Universe, accelerate the recombination process and have been proposed as a possible way to relieve the Hubble tension. However, previous studies relied on simplified toy models. In this study, for the first time, we use the recent high-precision evaluations of recombination with PMFs, incorporating full magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations and detailed Lyman-alpha radiative transfer, to test PMF-enhanced recombination ($b\Lambda$CDM) against observational data from the cosmic microwave background (CMB), baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), and Type Ia supernovae (SN). Focusing on non-helical PMFs with a Batchelor spectrum, we find a preference for present-day total field strengths of approximately 5-10 pico-Gauss. Depending on the dataset combination, this preference ranges from mild ($\sim 1.8\sigma$ with Planck + DESI) to moderate ($\sim 3\sigma$ with Planck + DESI + SH0ES-calibrated SN) significance. The $b\Lambda$CDM has Planck + DESI $\chi^2$ values equal or better than those of the $\Lambda$CDM model while predicting a higher Hubble constant. The favored field strengths align closely with those required for cluster magnetic fields to originate entirely from primordial sources, without the need for additional dynamo amplification or stellar magnetic field contamination. Future high-resolution CMB temperature and polarization measurements will be crucial for confirming or further constraining the presence of PMFs at recombination.
