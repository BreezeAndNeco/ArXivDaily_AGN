#### Velocity Reconstruction from KSZ: Measuring $f_{NL}$ with ACT and DESILS

 - **Abstract**
 The kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect offers an indirect way to reconstruct large-scale cosmic velocities, by correlating high-resolution CMB temperature maps with galaxy surveys. In this work, we present the first three-dimensional reconstruction of the large-scale velocity field using a photometric galaxy survey, using data from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys (DESILS) and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) DR5. We detect an $11.7\sigma$ correlation between our velocity reconstruction and the galaxy field, using only DESILS LRGs in the northern Galactic hemisphere. We find that the overall amplitude of the kSZ-induced correlation is low relative to a halo model prediction ($b_v = 0.45^{+0.06}_{-0.05}$), in agreement with previous results which find high feedback and smoothed gas profiles near massive galaxies. We use this measurement to place new constraints on local-type primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG), obtaining $f_{\rm NL}\!=\!-39^{+40}_{-33}$. This represents the most stringent $f_{\rm NL}$ constraint from kSZ velocity-based analyses to date. We validate our findings through extensive null tests, including tests for CMB foregrounds based on comparing 90 and 150 GHz CMB data.

 - **Abstract**
 High-redshift observations from JWST indicate that optical strong line ratios do not carry the same constraining power as they do at low redshifts. Critically, this prevents a separation between stellar- and black hole-driven ionizing radiation, thereby obscuring both active galactic nuclei demographics and star formation rates. To investigate this, we compute a large suite of photoionization models from Cloudy powered by stellar populations and accreting black holes over a large grid of ages, metallicities, initial mass functions, binarity, ionization parameters, densities, and black hole masses. We use these models to test three rest-frame optical strong line ratio diagnostics which have been designed to separate ionizing sources at low redshifts: the [NII]-BPT, VO87, and OHNO diagrams. We show that the position of a model in these diagrams is strongly driven by the ionization parameter (log U) and the gas-phase metallicity, often more so than the ionizing spectrum itself; in particular, there is significant overlap between stellar population and accreting black hole models at high log U and low Z. We show that the OHNO diagram is especially susceptible to large contamination of the AGN region defined at z=1 for stellar models with high log U and low Z, consistent with many observed JWST spectra at high redshift. We show that the optical line ratio diagnostics are most sensitive to the shape of the <54 eV ionizing continuum, and that the derived ionizing sources for a given set of optical strong line ratios can be highly degenerate. Finally, we demonstrate that very high ionization (>54 eV) emission lines that trace ionizing sources harder than normal stellar populations help to break the degeneracies present when using the strong line diagnostics alone, even in gas conditions consistent with those at high redshifts.

 - **Abstract**
 One challenge with explaining how high levels of planetary debris can enrich, or "pollute", old ($\sim$3 Gyr) and very old ($\sim$10 Gyr) white dwarfs is that debris reservoirs deplete on shorter timescales, akin to the solar system's already eviscerated Main Belt and Kuiper Belt. Here, I explore how these extrasolar reservoirs can be resupplied through supernovae that propel distant ($\gtrsim 10^4$ au) dust, sand and pebbles, and potentially boulders and comets, into the inner ($\lesssim 10^2$ au) planetary system. I analytically constrain the geometry of these blast waves, and derive expressions for the probability of apt blast configurations occurring. I then derive the minimum kick magnitudes needed to generate stable, leaky and broken post-blast orbits, and prove that within this formalism, at most 23 per cent of true anomalies along an eccentric orbit could allow for resupplied planetary debris to experience repeated pericentre passages. By linking these kick magnitudes with debris sizes and relating these quantities to the local neighbourhood supernova rate, I conclude that the probabilities for ejection or resupply per supernova blast are $\approx$100 per cent for micron-sized dust and millimetre-sized pebbles and sand, and $\approx$0 per cent for asteroids larger than $\sim$10 km. In between these extremes, I expect metre-sized boulders to be resupplied at least once to very old white dwarfs over their cooling ages. The efficacy of this debris delivery mechanism is dependent on the time-varying sources and sinks in an exo-Oort cloud and how its parent white dwarf has, throughout its cooling age, traversed the Milky Way.

 - **Abstract**
 We perform kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) velocity reconstruction on data from ACT DR6 and DESI-LS DR9. To estimate the cross-power between kSZ velocity reconstruction and galaxy density, we make use of a novel quadratic maximum likelihood QML power spectrum estimator implementation in red-shift binned spherical coordinates. We find a detection of the kSZ signal from the cross-correlation between the estimated velocity field and the large-scale galaxy field of $11.7 \sigma$. We estimate an amplitude $A=0.39 \pm 0.04$ of the kSZ signal with respect to a halo model prediction, possibly indicating a high feedback in massive halos, in agreement with previous studies. Our result demonstrates the feasibility of an optimal QML pipeline at the resolution required for this analysis, and will be a powerful tool for kSZ cosmology with upcoming high-resolution surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 Binary neutron star mergers can produce extreme magnetic fields, some of which can lead to strong magnetar-like remnants. While strong magnetic fields have been shown to affect the dynamics of outflows and angular momentum transport in the remnant, they can also crucially alter the properties of nuclear matter probed in the merger. In this work, we provide a first assessment of the latter, determining the strength of the pressure anisotropy caused by Landau level quantization and the anomalous magnetic moment. To this end, we perform the first numerical relativity simulation with a magnetic polarization tensor and a magnetic-field-dependent equation of state using a new algorithm we present here, which also incorporates a mean-field dynamo model to control the magnetic field strength present in the merger remnant. Our results show that -- in the most optimistic case -- corrections to the anisotropy can be in excess of $10\%$, and are potentially largest in the outer layers of the remnant. This work paves the way for a systematic investigation of these effects.

 - **Abstract**
 An analysis of the photometric growth and decay rates of sunspots and pores was carried out. According to the \textit{Solar Dynamics Observatory/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager} (SDO/HMI) data for the period 05.2010-03-2025, $\approx 3.5\cdot 10^{\rm 5}$ sunspots and pores were detected and their evolution tracked. The growth and decay rates of sunspots depend non-monotonically on the area. For small-area sunspots $S \lesssim 50$ $\mu$sh, a rapid increase in velocity is observed with increasing the area for the growth stage $dS^{\rm gr}_{\rm sp}\approx 0.2 \cdot S^{\rm 1.35}$ and for the decay stage $dS^{\rm dc}_{\rm sp}\approx 0.28 \cdot S^{\rm 1.26} $ $\mu$sh/day. For sunspots $S\gtrsim 50$ $\mu$sh, the growth rate depends weakly on the area: $dS^{\rm gr}_{\rm sp}\approx 11.9 \cdot S^{\rm 0.32}$ $\mu$sh/day. For the decay stage of sunspots with an area of $S\approx 50\,-\,150$ $\mu$sh, the decay rate also depends weakly on the area and can be approximated as $dS^{\rm dc}_{\rm sp}\approx 11 \cdot S^{\rm 0.15} $. For sunspot areas $S\gtrsim 150$ $\mu$sh, the decay rate accelerates with increasing area: $dS^{\rm dc}_{\rm sp}\approx 0.14 \cdot S^{\rm 0.96} $ $\mu$sh/day. For solar pores, the growth and decay rates of solar pores are linearly related to the area. The growth and decay rates for the spots of the leading and trailing polarities are determined. In the range of spot areas $S\approx 100\,-\,200$ $\mu$sh, the growth and decay rates of sunspots of trailing polarity are higher than those of sunspots of leading polarity.

 - **Abstract**
 The large-scale environments of active galactic nuclei (AGN) reveal important information on the growth and evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Previous AGN clustering measurements using 2-point correlation functions have hinted that AGN with massive black holes preferentially reside in denser cosmic regions than AGN with less-massive SMBHs. At the same time, little to no dependence on the accretion rate is found. However, the significance of such trends have been limited. Here we present kth-nearest-neighbor (kNN) statistics of 2MASS galaxies around AGN from the Swift/BAT AGN Spectroscopic survey. These statistics have been shown to contribute additional higher-order clustering information on the cosmic density field. By calculating the distances to the nearest 7 galaxy neighbors in angular separation to each AGN within two redshift ranges(0.01 < z < 0.03 and 0.03 < z < 0.06), we compare their cumulative distribution functions to that of a randomly distributed sample to show the sensitivity of this method to the clustering of AGN. We also split the AGN into bins of bolometric luminosity, black hole mass, and Eddington ratio (while controlling for redshift) to search for trends between kNN statistics and fundamental AGN properties. We find that AGN with massive SMBHs have significantly closer neighbors than AGN with less-massive SMBHs (at the 99.98% confidence level), especially in our lower redshift range. We find less significant trends with luminosity or Eddington ratio. By comparing our results to empirical SMBH-galaxy-halo models implemented in N-body simulations, we show that small-scale kNN trends with black hole mass may go beyond stellar mass dependencies. This suggests that massive SMBHs in the local universe reside in more massive dark matter halos and denser regions of the cosmic web, which may indicate that environment is important for the growth of SMBHs.

 - **Abstract**
 The process of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) fuelling relies on the transport of gas across several orders of magnitude in physical scale until the gas reaches the supermassive black hole at the centre of a galaxy. This work explores the role of kinematically misaligned gas in the fuelling of AGN in a sample of 4769 local galaxies from the MaNGA survey. We investigate for the first time the relative role of external interactions and the presence of kinematic misalignment as mechanisms to explain the observed increase in AGN fraction in galaxies with large stellar to gas kinematic misalignment ($>$45 degrees). Using a sample of galaxies with evidence of recent external interactions we find that there is a significantly higher fraction of AGN in those where a large stellar to gas kinematic misalignment is observed (20$^{+6}_{-4}\%$) compared with 6.2$^{+0.6}_{-0.5}\%$ in galaxies where no kinematic misalignment is observed. We determine that gas to stellar misalignment has an important role in the fraction of AGN observed, increasing the AGN fraction beyond the potential effect of external interactions. This result demonstrates the importance of misaligned structures to the fuelling of supermassive black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 Despite hundreds of detected fast radio bursts (FRBs), the faint-end slope ($\gamma$) of their energy distribution remains poorly constrained, hindering understanding of whether bright, cosmological FRBs and faint, Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154-like bursts share a common origin. In this study, we constrain this faint-end slope, modeled with a Schechter-like distribution, by searching for potential associations between bursts from the CHIME/FRB Catalog-1 and galaxies in the local volume. We cross-matched Catalog-1 FRBs with 495 local volume galaxies within 21 Mpc, identified from the HECATE catalog, and found no associations. Assuming the FRB energy function extends to $\sim 3 \times 10^{34}$ erg-the energy of the Galactic magnetar burst from SGR 1935+2154-this null result constrains $\gamma$ to be $<$ 2.3 (95% confidence upper limit), representing the first empirical estimate for extragalactic FRBs at such low energies. This finding supports the hypothesis that the FRB population is dominated by bright, likely cosmological bursts with a relatively flat energy distribution ($\gamma < 2.5$). However, the constraint weakens if higher energy thresholds are assumed. A flatter energy function is consistent with the observed anti-correlation between FRB dispersion measure and fluence, as seen across various observational bands. While the contribution of low-energy bursts, such as those from the Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154, appears minimal, our results suggest that normal magnetars like SGR 1935+2154 could dominate the FRB population if their burst rates and energies scale with age and magnetic field. Upcoming CHIME/FRB Catalog-2 data and targeted nearby galaxy surveys will further refine these constraints, offering critical insight into whether FRBs arise from a single population or diverse origins.

 - **Abstract**
 We present morphological classifications for the hosts of 1189 hard X-ray selected (14-195 keV) active galactic nuclei (AGNs) from the Swift-BAT 105-month catalog as part of the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey (BASS). BASS provides a powerful all-sky census of nearby AGN, minimizing obscuration biases and providing a robust dataset for studying AGN-host galaxy connections. Classifications are based on volunteer-based visual inspection on the Zooniverse platform, adapted from Galaxy Zoo DECaLS (GZD). Dual-contrast grz color composite images, generated from public surveys (e.g., NOAO Legacy Survey, Pan-STARRS, SDSS) and dedicated observations enabled key morphological features to be identified. Our analysis reveals that, with respect to a control sample of inactive galaxies matched in redshift and i-band magnitude, BASS AGN hosts show a deficiency of smooth ellipticals (~70%) and disks with prominent arms (~80%), while displaying an excess of mergers or disturbed systems (~400%), and disk galaxies without a spiral structure (~300%). These trends suggest a preference for AGN activity in gas-rich, dynamically disturbed environments or transitional disk systems. We also find a higher bar fraction among AGN hosts than the control sample (~50% vs. ~30%). We further explore the relations between AGN properties (e.g., X-ray luminosity, black hole mass, and Eddington ratio) and host morphology, and find that high-luminosity and high-accretion AGN preferentially reside in smooth or point-like hosts. In parallel, lower-luminosity AGN are more common in disk galaxies. These results underscore the importance of morphological studies in understanding the fueling and feedback mechanisms that drive AGN activity and their role in galaxy evolution. Our dataset provides a valuable benchmark for future multiwavelength surveys (e.g. LSST, Roman, and Euclid) and automated morphological classification efforts.
#### A Comprehensive Multiwavelength Study of the OH Megamaser galaxy IRAS 09320+6134

 - **Abstract**
 We present a multiwavelength study of the gas distribution, kinematics and excitation of the OH megamaser galaxy IRAS 09320+6134 (UGC 5101) using Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph Integral Field Unit, Hubble Space Telescope, and Very Large Array observations. The HST ACS F814W i-band and H$\alpha$ + [N II] $\lambda\lambda$ 6548,84 narrow-band images indicate that this galaxy is a late-stage merger. The ionized gas emission in the inner $\sim$ 2 kpc radius, traced by the GMOS data, is consistent with two kinematic components: (i) a rotating disk, observed as a narrow component in the emission-line profiles, with velocity dispersion of $\sigma$ $\leq$ 200 km s$^{-1}$, and (ii) an outflow, traced by a broad component in the emission-line profiles, with $\sigma\geq$ 500 km s$^{-1}$. The disk component is well reproduced by a model of rotation in a plane with similar orientation to that of the large-scale galaxy disk. The outflow component presents bulk velocities of up to -500 km s$^{-1}$ and corresponds to a mass outflow rate of $\dot{M}_o = 0.122 \pm 0.026 M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. Emission-line ratio diagrams indicate that the gas excitation is mainly due to an active galactic nucleus, likely the driver of the outflow. The VLA radio image reveals a dominant radio core with two-sided emission along the NE-SW direction. The radio core's spectral index and brightness temperature indicate AGN emission, with the extended emission resembling both in morphology and spectral index the emission observed in radio-quiet quasars. Combined with previous similar studies of other OHM galaxies, the present work supports that this phase is linked to the triggering of an AGN, that seems to occur in the final stages of a merger.

 - **Abstract**
 Feedback from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) is a key process in the evolution of massive halos in the Universe. New observational information on feedback is crucial for improving the implementation of the physics in numerical models. In this work, we apply a novel image-manipulation technique, termed 'X-arithmetic', to a sample of 15 galaxy clusters and groups deeply observed with Chandra. This technique decomposes perturbations in feedback-dominated regions into images excluding either (1) weak shocks and sound waves, (2) bubbles inflated by jets, or (3) cooling and slow gas motions (isobaric perturbations), enabling efficient spatial identification of these features without involving spectroscopic analysis. We confirm the nature of previously (spectroscopically-)identified features and newly establish the origin of other structures. We find that feedback produces multiple shocks in groups and massive galaxies, but only one to two shocks in clusters. Prominent isobaric structures are abundant around inner cavities in clusters, compared to almost no such structures in groups. These differences suggest that feedback effects are stronger in smaller-mass systems, possibly due to the shallower gravitational potential of groups or more violent feedback. Follow-up spectroscopy, guided by the X-arithmetic results, suggests that earlier-identified "isothermal shocks" could be a mix of isobaric and adiabatic structures. We applied X-arithmetic to galaxy cluster simulations, demonstrating its straightforward application and future potential for testing the feedback physics details in simulations. Our feasibility study shows that imaging data from future X-ray observatories like AXIS will be ideal for expanding X-arithmetic application to a larger sample of objects.

 - **Abstract**
 The advent of next-generation telescope facilities brings with it an unprecedented amount of data, and the demand for effective tools to process and classify this information has become increasingly important. This work proposes a novel approach to quantify the radio galaxy morphology, through the development of a series of algorithmic metrics that can quantitatively describe the structure of radio source, and can be applied to radio images in an automatic way. These metrics are intuitive in nature and are inspired by the intrinsic structural differences observed between the existing Fanaroff-Riley (FR) morphology types. The metrics are defined in categories of asymmetry, blurriness, concentration, disorder, and elongation ($ABCDE$/single-lobe metrics), as well as the asymmetry and angle between lobes (source metrics). We apply these metrics to a sample of $480$ sources from the Evolutionary Map of the Universe Pilot Survey (EMU-PS) and $72$ well resolved extensively studied sources from An Atlas of DRAGNs, a subset of the revised Third Cambridge Catalogue of Radio Sources (3CRR). We find that these metrics are relatively robust to resolution changes, independent of each other, and measure fundamentally different structural components of radio galaxy lobes. These metrics work particularly well for sources with reasonable signal-to-noise and well separated lobes. We also find that we can recover the original FR classification using probabilistic combinations of our metrics, highlighting the usefulness of our approach for future large data sets from radio sky surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 Large SEPs can cause adverse space weather hazard to humans technology and such events are especially associated with halo coronal mass ejections (CMEs). But in turn, a significant portion of halo-CMEs are not associated with large SEPs. The objective of this study is to gain an understanding of the source region distinctions between halo-CMEs in SEP and No-SEP events. Among the 176 halo-CMEs observed from 2010-2024, we screen out 45 large SEP events and 131 No-SEP events from this dataset. It is revealed that CME speed is a good discriminator between SEP and No-SEP events. Through classifying the source regions of all the halo-CMEs, we find that 53\% of SEP events originate from ``Single AR'', and 47\% from ``Multiple ARs'' or ``Outside of ARs''. The corresponding proportion for No-SEP events is 70\% and 30\%. This suggests that SEP source regions are more likely to originate from large-scale sources. We have also calculated the relevant magnetic parameters of the source regions and found that SEP source regions have higher magnetic free energy and reconnection flux compared to No-SEP source regions. However, SEP source regions are smaller in terms of the intensive magnetic parameters such as mean characteristic magnetic twist $\alpha$ and mean shear angles. Our statistical results can provide new potential variables for forecasting SEPs.

 - **Abstract**
 The formation and evolution of the ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) continues to remain a puzzle. Similarities and differences in the morphological and the kinematical properties of the UDGs with their possible precursors, namely low-surface brightness (LSBs), L*-type high-surface brightness (HSBs) and dwarf galaxies, may provide crucial constraints on their origin and evolution. We selected samples of UDGs, LSBs, HSBs and dwarfs from TNG50-1. We first obtained a few possible scaling relations involving some mass properties to analyse if the regression fits for UDGs are in compliance with those of the other samples. Then, we studied individual galaxy cutouts to evaluate the intrinsic shapes of their dark-matter (DM) and stellar components, orbital and kinematical properties related to their stellar velocity dispersion. Finally, we constructed the mock IFU data using the SimSpin code to extract the stellar kinematic moment maps. We observe that the UDGs and the dwarf galaxies have nearly similar regression fits in a. stellar-to-gas mass ratio vs gas mass, b. stellar-to-gas mass ratio vs total dynamical mass, c. stellar central surface density vs ratio of stellar-to-total dynamical mass, and d. total baryonic mass vs total dynamical mass parameter spaces. Next, we find that the isolated UDGs are prolate rotators similar to the dwarf population, while the tidally-bound UDGs can exhibit both prolate and oblate-rotating shapes. The DM and stellar velocity anisotropy properties of the UDGs suggest that they reside in a cored, dwarf-like halo and may be classified by early-type galaxies. Finally, the stellar kinematic properties suggest that both the UDGs and the dwarfs are slow-rotators having low to nearly no-rotations in contrast to the late-type, disc-dominated, fast-rotating LSBs and HSBs. Therefore, we may conclude that the UDGs and the dwarfs possibly have a common dynamical lineage.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the infrared variability of carbon stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Our sample consists of 11,134 carbon stars identified in both visual and infrared bands. Among these, 1,184 objects are known Mira variables based on the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment III (OGLE-III) observations. We study the infrared variability of the entire sample using the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) photometric data spanning the past 16 years, including the AllWISE multiepoch data and the Near-Earth Object WISE Reactivation (NEOWISE-R) 2024 final data release. We generate light curves using WISE observations in the W1 and W2 bands and compute Lomb-Scargle periodograms for all sample stars. From the WISE light curves, we derive reliable variability parameters for 1,615 objects. Among these, we identify 672 objects exhibiting clear Mira-like variations: 445 of these are previously known Miras from OGLE-III, while 227 are candidates for new Mira variables identified from the WISE data. We establish period-magnitude and period-color relations in both visual and infrared bands for the known Miras and the newly identified candidates from WISE data. We anticipate that these relations will serve as valuable references for studying carbon stars in other galaxies, including the Milky Way.

 - **Abstract**
 JWST has revealed a large population of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the distant universe, which are challenging our understanding of early massive black hole seeding and growth. We expand the exploration of this population to lower luminosities by stacking $\sim 600$ NIRSpec grating spectra from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) at $3<z<7$, in bins of redshift, [OIII]5007 luminosity and equivalent width, UV luminosity and stellar mass. In various stacks, we detect a broad component of H$\alpha$ without a counterpart in [OIII], implying that it is not due to outflows but is tracing the Broad Line Region (BLR) of a large population of low-luminosity AGN not detected in individual spectra. We also consider the possible contribution from Supernovae (SNe) and Very Massive Stars and conclude that while this is very unlikely, we cannot exclude some potential contribution by SNe to some of the stacks. The detection, in some stacks, of high [OIII]4363/H$\gamma$, typical of AGN, further confirms that such stacks reveal a large population of AGN. We infer that the stacks probe black holes with masses of a few times $10^6~M_\odot$ accreting at rates $L/L_{Edd}\sim 0.02-0.1$, i.e. a low mass and dormant parameter space poorly explored by previous studies on individual targets. We identify populations of black holes that fall within the scatter of the local $M_{BH}-M_{*}$ scaling relation, indicating that there is a population of high-z BHs that are not overmassive relative to their host galaxies and which have been mostly missed in previous JWST observations. Yet, on average, the stacks are still overmassive relative the local relation, with some of them 1-2 dex above it. We infer that the BH mass function (BHMF) at $3<z<5$ rises steeply at low masses. The BHMF is consistent with models in which BHs evolve through short bursts of super-Eddington accretion.

 - **Abstract**
 We revisit the local Hubble constant measurement from type Ia supernovae calibrated with Cepheids (SH0ES) by remodelling the supernova data using two supernova populations emerging from the observed bimodal distribution of the SALT2 stretch parameter. Our analysis accounts for population differences in both intrinsic properties (related to possible initial conditions, including supernova progenitor channels) and host-galaxy extinction (expected from well-known environmental differences associated observationally with the two populations). Based on a two-population Bayesian hierarchical modelling of the SALT2 light-curve parameters from the Pantheon+ compilation, we simultaneously constrain intrinsic and extrinsic properties of both supernova populations, match probabilistically the calibration supernovae with the corresponding population in the Hubble flow, and derive the Hubble constant. The difference between the two supernova populations is primarily driven by their mean absolute magnitudes and total-to-selective extinction coefficients. This is related but not equivalent to the traditional mass-step correction (including its broadening for reddened supernovae). The mean extinction coefficient of the supernova population used to propagate distances from the calibration galaxies to the Hubble flow is found to be consistent with the Milky Way-like interstellar dust model with R_B~4 and substantially higher than the extinction model assumed in the SH0ES measurement. Allowing for possible differences between reddening in the calibration galaxies and the corresponding population in the Hubble flow, we obtain H_0=70.59+/-1.15 km/s/Mpc. For the most conservative choice assuming equal prior distributions, we find H_0=71.45+/-1.03 km/s/Mpc. Our reanalysis of type Ia supernovae results in a reduction of the discrepancy with the Planck H_0 by at least 30 and up to 50 per cent (3.5-2.2sigma).

 - **Abstract**
 We estimated radiative efficiency, spin and SMBH mass values for sample of 33 distant low luminosity AGNs. The distribution of the estimated spin values (majority of objects have a spin greater than 0.8) is fairly typical for many types of AGNs. The dependence of the estimated spin values on the estimated SMBH masses shows strong correlation between them, which suggests a rapid increase in spin with mass, i.e. that the main mechanism of mass growth in this case is disk accretion. We did not find any significant qualitative differences in the spin characteristics between our objects and objects of other types considered in the paper.
#### Revision of conservative lower bound on intergalactic magnetic field from Fermi and Cherenkov telescope observations of extreme blazars

 - **Abstract**
 Joint observations of extreme blazars with Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) and Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACT) have been previously used to derive lower bounds on intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF). We update these previous bounds using a set of extreme blazars that are detected in the Very-High-Energy (VHE, photon energies above 100 GeV) band by both Fermi/LAT and IACTs. We measure IGMF-dependent suppression of secondary delayed gamma-ray flux from electron-positron pairs deposited in the intergalactic medium by VHE gamma-rays interacting with Extragalactic Background Light. From overall 22 extreme blazars detected by Fermi/LAT and IACTs in the VHE band, seven have their spectral characteristics inconsistent with the possibility of zero magnetic field along their lines of sight, even under the most restrictive assumption that the sources have only switched on at the start of VHE band observations. Adopting this assumption, we derive a "conservative" lower bound on the IGMF strength at the level of 2e-17 G. The tightest bound is imposed by the signal of 1ES 0502+675, a source that has not been considered in the IGMF analysis before. Our bound is comparable to the bound derived by MAGIC collaboration, but is weaker than that previously derived from analysis of Fermi/LAT and HESS telescope data, even though our dataset includes that data. We clarify the origin of this discrepancy.
#### Cool Gas in the Circumgalactic Medium of Massive Post Starburst Galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 Observing the interplay between galaxies and their gaseous surroundings is crucial for understanding how galaxies form and evolve, including the roles of long-lived cool gas reservoirs, starburst and AGN driven outflows. We use stacked Mg II absorption lines in the spectra of background quasars to study the cool gas out to 9Mpc from massive quiescent, star-forming and post-starburst galaxies with stellar masses $\log_{10}(M_{\mathrm{gal}}/M_\odot) \gtrsim 11.4$ and $0.4 \lesssim z \lesssim 0.8$ selected from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) CMASS galaxies. Consistent with previous studies, we observe a decline in absorption strength indicating a decrease in cool gas content with increasing distance from the galaxies, as well as decreasing star formation rate of the galaxies. Beyond 1Mpc, this decline levels off to the same absorption strength in all galaxy types, suggesting a transition from the circumgalactic medium (CGM) to the intergalactic medium (IGM) at approximately the virial radius of the host dark matter haloes. We find that post-starburst galaxies, that have experienced a recent burst of star formation that has rapidly quenched, exhibit significantly stronger Mg II absorption within 1Mpc than star-forming or quiescent galaxies of the same stellar mass. Because post-starburst galaxies are a potentially significant pathway for the formation of quiescent elliptical galaxies, our results have wide reaching implications for understanding the mechanisms involved in quenching star formation in galaxies. We speculate that the excess cool gas absorption out to 1Mpc around post-starburst galaxies is related to their observed high velocity ($\sim$1000\,km/s) cool gas outflows. Thus, strong, short-lived bursts of star formation impact the CGM around galaxies on Mpc distances and Gyr timescales.
#### MeerKAT radio continuum imaging of nearby star-forming spirals in the NGC 6221, NGC 3256/3263, and NGC 2434 galaxy groups

 - **Abstract**
 Context. We present high-resolution MeerKAT 1.3 GHz radio continuum images of star-forming spirals in the nearby galaxy groups around NGC 6221, NGC 3256/3263 and NGC 2434. This sample spans the evolutionary timeline for galaxy groups, encompassing early, intermediate, and late stages, respectively. The NGC 6221 group contains an interacting galaxy pair with tidal debris, along with at least three dwarf galaxies. In contrast, the NGC 3256/3263 group represents a loose group consisting of several spiral as well as dwarf galaxies, while a massive elliptical galaxy dominates the NGC 2434 group. Aims. We study the star formation activity in all detected galaxies, as it is one of the dominant physical processes in their formation and evolution, seeking evidence of environmental impact. Methods. We use MeerKAT radio continuum data and archival WISE infrared data to locate and measure the star formation rate in all group members. In particular, we used polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) as tracers of gas heated due to star formation activity. Furthermore, we create in-band spectral index maps, providing insights into the underlying physical processes associated with the detected star-forming regions. Results. We found that galaxies are distributed differently in the WISE colour-colour diagram depending on their evolutionary group stage, as expected. Except for ESO 059-G012, the galaxies in our sample follow the radio-W3PAH correlation. A possible scenario that explains the ESO 059-G012 result is that the galaxy has already consumed the gas. We also found evidence that the interaction among the spiral galaxies NGC 3263, NGC 3256B and NGC 3256C is causing the Vela Cloud complex and that the galaxies NGC 6221 and NGC 3256 might host a low-luminosity AGN, as was previously proposed in the literature.

 - **Abstract**
 Synchrotron X-ray emission from a pulsar wind nebula (PWN) is a sensitive probe of its magnetic field and high-energy particle population. Here we analyze contemporaneous NuSTAR and XMM-Newton observations of the PWN G54.1+0.3, powered by pulsar PSR J1930+1852. We also present a preliminary timing analysis of the central pulsar PSR J1930+1852 and analyze its X-ray pulse profiles in different energy bands. We detect X-ray emission from the combined pulsar and PWN system up to $\approx70$ keV, while emission from the PWN itself has been detected up to $\approx30$ keV, with a photon index $\Gamma$ increasing from $\sim 1.9$ to $\sim 2.4$ with photon energy between 3 and 30 keV. PWN G54.1+0.3's X-ray spectrum is consistent with a broken power law, with break energy $E_{\rm break} \approx 5$ keV, consistent with synchrotron cooling of a single power-law particle spectrum. The best-fit broadband spectral energy distribution model after the inclusion of this new spectral data indicates a maximum particle $E_{\rm max} \sim 400$ TeV. We discuss PSR J1930+1852 and PWN G54.1+0.3 in the context of other PWNe powered by young energetic pulsars.
