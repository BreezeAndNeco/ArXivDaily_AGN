 - **Abstract**
 The magnetic field configuration in the interior of neutron stars and its stability are open problems and may be impacted by the influence of a turbulent cascade within the star. Assessing the impact of turbulent flow with numerical simulations requires incredibly high resolution as well as long lived simulations covering multiple Alfven times. We present a series of simulations of magnetised neutron stars with resolution up to 29m and lasting at their longest 1.2s to assess this issue, the longest lasting and highest resolution such simulations to date. At the highest resolution we find evidence for a turbulent cascade absent in an unmagnetised star which cannot be captured with lower resolution simulations, consistent with Kolmogorov power law scaling. The presence of turbulence triggers an inverse cascade of helicity, while at late times the net helicity appears to vanish, suggesting that a twisted-torus is not formed in the magnetic field. We find that the presence of the magnetic field excites a characteristic quadrupolar oscillation of the density profile at 145 Hz, consistent with Alfvenic modes proposed as the source of quasi-periodic oscillations observed in magnetars.

 - **Abstract**
 The dusty and molecular torus is one of the most elusive structures surrounding supermassive black holes, yet its importance is unequivocal for understanding feedback and accretion mechanisms. The torus and accretion disk feed the inspiraling gas onto the supermassive black hole (SMBH) and launch outflows, fundamentally connecting the SMBH activity to the host galaxy. This scenario situates the torus as the interface between the AGN and its host galaxy with a flow cycle of molecular gas and dust of a few parsecs in size. Here, we utilize a novel aperture-masking interferometric mode onboard the JWST, achieving twice the previously possible resolution, and bringing out the fainter features that clearly show the torus being the critical interface for feeding material from galaxy scales into the SMBH. We also identify that $<1$% of the emission arises from an arc structure composed of hot dust entrained in a molecular and ionized outflow. The rest of the emission, $12$%, is associated with dust heated by the AGN and/or radio-jet at large scales. Combined with continuum data, gas tracers, and torus models, our study shows that most of the dust mass is located in the equatorial axis in the form of a disk feeding the AGN.

 - **Abstract**
 SDSSJ163712.21+363155.9 is a candidate hyper-runaway star, first identified from its unusual spectrum in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, which exhibits oxygen, magnesium, and silicon lines redshifted by several $100\,$km/s, leading to the suggestion it was ejected from a thermonuclear supernova. We have acquired GTC OSIRIS spectroscopy of SDSSJ1637+3631 establishing a warm ($T_\mathrm{eff}=15680\pm250\,$K) carbon+oxygen dominated atmosphere, that is also abundant in the intermediate mass elements silicon, sulphur, and calcium. We interpret SDSSJ1637+3631 as the donor to an accreting white dwarf that exploded in a dynamically-driven double-degenerate double-detonation (D6) type Ia supernova, where the current composition is consistent with a CO white dwarf core, enriched with intermediate mass elements from deposited supernova ejecta. While SDSSJ1637+3631 has a low-precision Gaia parallax, our spectroscopic surface gravity ($\log g=6.3\pm0.3\,$dex) helps constrain its tangential velocity to $1950^{+810}_{-530}\,$km/s, providing additional support to the D6 mechanism. Under the assumption that SDSSJ1637+3631 is a D6 survivor, we construct a kinematic model combining all astrometric, spectroscopic, and photometric information, but also including the structure and gravitational potential of the Milky Way. Our model localises the ejection site to the inner few kpc of the Galactic disc (though excluding the Galactic centre), with an ejection speed of $1870^{+360}_{-300}\,$km/s, and a $4.5^{+0.4}_{-0.5}\,$Myr time of flight.
#### Scale-dependent bias and mode coupling in redshift-space clustering near the BAO scale

 - **Abstract**
 The baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) feature in the 2-point clustering of biased tracers in redshift space can be described in a model-agnostic manner, relying only on the assumption that nonlinear growth approximately smears this feature with a Gaussian kernel sourced by gravitationally driven bulk flows as in the Zel'dovich approximation. An explicit model that demonstrated this in recent work did not account for two physical effects that are very likely observationally relevant in the context of ongoing surveys, namely, the scale-dependence of linear Lagrangian density and velocity bias and the effects of mode coupling. We rectify this shortcoming in this paper by showing that a simple model including these effects is able to accurately describe the multipoles of the 2pcf of realistic tracer samples at BAO scales. Our results indicate that the effects of scale-dependent bias will be important to model for surveys such as DESI, while those of mode coupling are relatively less significant. Our model for scale-dependent bias and mode coupling, which is motivated by model-agnostic arguments from peaks theory and the Zel'dovich approximation, lies in the class of `Laplace-Gauss' expansions, making it straightforward to incorporate these effects in the model-agnostic inference framework mentioned above.

 - **Abstract**
 The discovery of many exoplanets has revealed an incredible diversity of orbital architectures. These orbital configurations are intrinsically linked to the potential for habitable environments within the system, since the gravitational influence of the planets governs the angular momentum distribution within the system. This angular momentum distribution, in turn, alters the planetary orbits and rotational obliquities. In the case of giant planets, their gravitational influence can also produce significant redistribution of volatiles, particularly those that lie beyond the snow line. Here, we present the results of dynamical simulations that investigate the role of cold giant planets in scattering material to inner terrestrial planets. We highlight 10 exoplanetary systems with 2 or more known giant planets beyond the snow line, and adopt a solar system analog template that investigates the scattering of material within the range 3-8~AU. We show that increasing the eccentricity of a Jupiter analog from its present, near-circular, value to a moderate range (0.2-0.3) results in an order of magnitude increase in scattered material to the inner part of the system. The inclusion of a Saturn analog to the dynamical model produces a similar increase, highlighting the importance of multiple giant planets beyond the snow line. However, the addition of analogs to Uranus and Neptune can have a minor negative effect on scattering efficiency through the transfer of angular momentum from the inner giant planets.

 - **Abstract**
 Searches for supernovae (SNe) progenitors have relied on a direct detection of the star in fortuitous pre-explosion images. We propose an alternative method, using a combination of photometric stellar population fitting alongside integral-field-unit (IFU) spectroscopic analysis of the ionised gas to fully explore the SN environment and constrain the progenitor properties. Isochrone fitting of HST/WFC3 observations reveals the environment of iPTF13bvn contains two stellar populations with unique age ($\tau=\log{t [years]}$) and extinction ($A_V$) values, with the closest agreement found between past progenitor studies of iPTF13bvn and our oldest stellar population (P2): $\tau_{P2}=6.97^{+0.06}_{-0.06}$, a corresponding initial mass $M_{initial,P2} = 20.0 M_\odot$ and $A_{V,P2}=0.53^{+0.10}_{-0.08}$ mag. Further analysis with VLT/MUSE IFU-spectroscopic observations reveals no bright H II regions associated with iPTF13bvn, suggesting no immediate ongoing star formation. Extinctions derived from the ionised gas are a minimum of ~2.5 times higher than the resolved stellar population values, assisting in building a 3D picture of the environment. An analysis of the distribution of spaxel extinctions reveals increased variability in the environment of iPTF13bvn, on the edge of a spiral arm. Our study highlights the complex relationship between stars, gas and dust and how, when used in a holistic environmental analysis, they can begin to resolve degeneracies that have plagued past progenitor investigations. Specifically for iPTF13bvn, our results support a binary progenitor and a growing consensus for binarity as the predominant mass-loss mechanism for Type Ib SNe progenitors.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper we present the current status of the enhanced X-ray Timing and Polarimetry mission, which has been fully approved for launch in 2030. eXTP is a space science mission designed to study fundamental physics under extreme conditions of matter density, gravity, and magnetism. The mission aims at determining the equation of state of matter at supra-nuclear density, measuring effects of QED, and understanding the dynamics of matter in strong-field gravity. In addition to investigating fundamental physics, the eXTP mission is poised to become a leading observatory for time-domain and multi-messenger astronomy in the 2030s, as well as providing observations of unprecedented quality on a variety of galactic and extragalactic objects. After briefly introducing the history and a summary of the scientific objectives of the eXTP mission, this paper presents a comprehensive overview of: 1) the cutting-edge technology, technical specifications, and anticipated performance of the mission's scientific instruments; 2) the full mission profile, encompassing spacecraft design, operational capabilities, and ground segment infrastructure.

 - **Abstract**
 Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with dynamically measured masses have shown empirical correlations with host galaxy properties. These correlations are often the only method available to estimate SMBH masses and gather statistics for large galaxy populations across a range of redshifts, even though the scaling relations themselves are derived from a small subset of nearby galaxies. Depending on the scaling relation used, estimated SMBH masses can vary significantly. The most widely used scaling relations are the M$_{BH}-$M$_{\mathrm{bulge}}$ and M$_{BH}- \sigma$ relations, where M$_{\mathrm{bulge}}$ is galaxy bulge mass and $\sigma$ is the bulge velocity dispersion. In this paper, we determine how severely the choice of scaling relation impacts SMBH mass estimates for different subsets of a large galaxy population. For this analysis we use a sample of $\sim$ 400,000 galaxies, including 1,240 Type 1 AGN from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We calculate SMBH masses from M$_{BH}-$M$_{\mathrm{bulge}}$ and M$_{BH}- \sigma$ and compare to single-epoch virial SMBH masses from broad-line H$\beta$, which are derived independently of black hole-host galaxy scaling relations. We find that SMBH masses derived from the single-epoch virial relation for H$\beta$ are better reproduced by M$_{BH}- \sigma$ than M$_{BH}-$M$_{\mathrm{bulge}}$. Finally, in cases where $\sigma$ and M$_{\mathrm{bulge}}$ cannot be measured directly, we show that it is possible to infer $\sigma$ from photometry with more accuracy than we can infer M$_{\mathrm{bulge}}$.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the novel capabilities of the enhanced X-ray Timing and Polarimetry (eXTP) mission to study the strong gravity region around stellar-mass black holes in X-ray binary systems and supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei. eXTP can combine X-ray spectral, timing, and polarimetric techniques to study the accretion process near black holes, measure black hole masses and spins, and test Einstein's theory of General Relativity in the strong field regime. We show how eXTP can improve the current measurements of black holes of existing X-ray missions and we discuss the scientific questions that can be addressed.
#### Measuring monster MBHs: maybe mighty, maybe merely massive

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate black hole mass (MBH) measurements in high-z galaxies are difficult yet crucial to constrain the growth of supermassive BHs, and to discriminate between competing BH seed models. Recent studies claimed the detection of massive BHs in very distant AGN, implying extreme growth conditions. However, these estimates are usually obtained by extrapolating indirect methods that are calibrated for moderately accreting, low-luminosity AGN in the local universe. To assess the reliability of the single epoch method (SE) in the distant universe, we compute the MBH for a sample of hyper-luminous distant quasars and a sample of highly accreting AGN using the X-ray scaling method. We first verify that this X-ray method yields reliable MBH values for distant highly accreting objects. Then, we carry out a systematic comparison with the SE method and find that these two indirect methods yield consistent MBH over a broad range of luminosities, intrinsic absorption, and accretion rates. The only discrepancies are associated with AGN that are substantially absorbed (underestimated by the SE method), and AGN accreting well above the Eddington limit (overestimated by the SE method). The latter result casts some doubts on the claim of overmassive BHs in highly accreting AGN in the early universe. Our study also reveals that one of the frequently used AGN catalogs consistently underestimates the MBH values by a factor of 2.5. Although this factor is of the order of the uncertainty generally associated with the SE method, we demonstrate that the use of underestimated values may result in potentially misleading conclusions. Specifically, for this AGN sample we confirm strong positive correlations for Gamma vs. lambda_Edd and for the X-ray bolometric correction vs. lambda_Edd, as well as for Gamma vs. the soft excess strength, at odds with the conclusions inferred using underestimated MBH values.
#### First joint absorption and T$_e$-based metallicity measured in a GRB host galaxy at $z=4.28$ using JWST/NIRSpec

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first gamma-ray burst (GRB) host galaxy with a measured absorption line and electron temperature (T$_e$) based metallicity, using the temperature sensitive [OIII]$\lambda$4363 auroral line detected in the JWST/NIRSpec spectrum of the host of GRB 050505 at redshift $z=4.28$. We find that the metallicity of the cold interstellar gas, derived from the absorption lines in the GRB afterglow, of 12 + log(O/H)$\sim 7.7$ is in reasonable agreement with the temperature-based emission line metallicity in the warm gas of the GRB host galaxy, which has values of 12 + log(O/H) = 7.80$\pm$0.19 and 7.96$\pm$0.21 for two common indicators. When using strong emission line diagnostics appropriate for high-z galaxies and sensitive to ionisation parameter, we find good agreement between the strong emission line metallicity and the other two methods. Our results imply that, for the host of GRB050505, mixing between the warm and the cold ISM along the line of sight to the GRB is efficient, and that GRB afterglow absorption lines can be a reliable tracer of the metallicity of the galaxy. If confirmed with a large sample, this suggest that metallicities determined via GRB afterglow spectroscopy can be used to trace cosmic chemical evolution to the earliest cosmic epochs and in galaxies far too faint for emission line spectroscopy, even for JWST.
#### The properties of primordially-seeded black holes and their hosts in the first billion years: implications for JWST

 - **Abstract**
 James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have opened a tantalising new window onto possible black holes as early as redshifts of $z \sim 10.4$. These show a number of puzzling properties including unexpectedly massive black holes in place by $z \sim 10$ and inexplicably high black hole-to-stellar mass ratios of $M_{\rm BH}/M_*\geq 0.1$. These pose a serious challenge for "astrophysical" seeding and growth models that we aim to explain with ``cosmological" primordial black holes (PBHs) in this work. We present PHANES, an analytic framework that follows the evolution of dark matter halos, and their baryons in the first billion years, seeded by a population of PBHs with seed masses between $10^{0.5}-10^6 M_\odot$. PBH seeded models yield a black hole mass function that extends between $10^{1.25-11.25} ~(10^{0.75-7.25})M_\odot$ at $z \sim 5 (15)$ for the different models considered in this work. Interestingly, PBH-seeded models (with spin $s=0$ or $-1$) naturally result in extremely high values of $M_{\rm BH}/M_*\geq 0.25$ at $z \sim 5-15$. For a typical stellar mass of $M_* =10^9 M_\odot$, we find an average value of $M_{\rm BH}/M_* \sim 0.4~ (1.6)$ for $s=0~(-1)$ at $z=5$, providing a smoking gun for PBH-seeded models. Another particularity of PBH-seeded models is their ability of producing systems with high black hole-to-stellar mass ratios that are extremely metal poor ($Z \leq 10^{-2}~Z_\odot$). Yielding a PBH-to-dark matter fraction $\leq 10^{-9}$ and a stellar mass function that lies four orders of magnitude below observations, our model is in accord with all current cosmological and astrophysical bounds.

 - **Abstract**
 In May 2024, the Sun exhibited intense magnetic activity, marked by numerous high-intensity flares resulting from the interaction and merging of NOAA ARs 13664 and 13668 in the southern hemisphere and AR 13663 in the northern hemisphere. Notably, AR 13664 displayed an extended lifetime, remaining visible after a full solar rotation and continuing to produce significant flaring activity. In this study, we investigate the evolution of sub-photospheric plasma flows associated with these ARs during their disk passage using ring-diagram analysis of SDO/HMI Dopplergrams. We analyze flow divergence, vorticity, and kinetic helicity across depths from the surface to 25 Mm, revealing pronounced temporal and depth-dependent variations. Our observations indicate that the majority of flares occur on the days when the Normalized Helicity Gradient Variance, a measure of kinetic helicity spread, peaks or on the following day. Furthermore, we examine the relationship between subsurface flow dynamics and surface magnetic properties of these complex active regions to understand the interaction between them.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel method of constraining volcanic activity on extrasolar terrestrial worlds via characterization of circumstellar plasma tori. Our work generalizes the physics of the Io plasma torus to propose a hypothetical circumstellar plasma torus generated by exoplanetary volcanism. The quasi-steady torus mass is determined by a balance between material injection and ejection rates from volcanic activity and corotating magnetospheric convection, respectively. By estimating the Alfvén surfaces of planet-hosting stars, we calculate the torus mass-removal timescale for a number of exoplanets with properties amenable to plasma torus construction. Assuming a uniform toroidal geometry comparable to Io's "warm" torus, we calculate quasi-steady torus masses inferable from the optical depth of atomic spectral features in torus-contaminated stellar spectra. The calculated quasi-steady masses can be used to constrain the volcanic outgassing rates of each species detected in the torus, providing quantitative estimates of bulk volcanic activity and interior composition with minimal assumptions. Such insight into the interior state of an exoplanet is otherwise accessible only after destruction via tidal forces. We demonstrate the feasibility of our method by showcasing known exoplanets which are susceptible to tidal heating and could generate readily-detectable tori with realistic outgassing rates of order 1 ton s$^{-1}$, comparable to the Io plasma torus mass injection rate. This methodology may be applied to stellar spectra measured with ultraviolet instruments with sufficient resolution to detect atomic lines and sensitivity to recover the ultraviolet continuum of GKM dwarf stars. This further motivates the need for ultraviolet instrumentation above Earth's atmosphere.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a near-infrared spectroscopic and imaging analysis of the star-forming region IRAS 16475-4609, based on TripleSpec/SOAR spectroscopy and NEWFIRM/CTIO imaging, complemented by archival radio and sub-millimeter data. Our spectroscopic analysis indicates that the central source is an early B-type star (B0-B0.7V) powering a compact HII region characterized by strong HI and HeI recombination lines, and molecular H$_2$ emission. We derive a distance of 3.51$\pm$0.74 kpc, consistent with the position of the Scutum-Crux near arm at Galactic longitudes of $\sim$340$^\circ$. At this distance, the ionized gas traced by Brackett-$\gamma$ emission has a radius of 0.27$\pm$0.06 pc, placing the source in a transition phase between ultra-compact and compact HII regions. From radio data, we estimate an ionizing photon flux of N$_{ly}$=(2.3$\pm$0.3)$\times10^{47}$ photons s$^{-1}$, and an electron temperature of T$_e$=(5.4$\pm$0.2)$\times$10$^3$ K for the ionized gas. The analysis also reveals an obscured high-density molecular clump southwest of the HII region, coincident with an ATLASGAL sub-millimeter peak, indicating a potential site of ongoing and triggered star formation as the ionization front advances into the surrounding molecular material. These results suggest that IRAS 16475-4609 is a young high-mass star-forming region with stellar feedback actively shaping its environment, offering valuable insight into the early evolution of compact HII regions.
#### The VMC Survey -- LIV. Anomalous Cepheids in the Magellanic Clouds Period-Luminosity relations in the near-infrared bands

 - **Abstract**
 Anomalous Cepheids (ACs) are less studied metal-poor pulsating stars ([Fe/H]<-1.5) compared to Classical Cepheids (CCs) and RR Lyrae stars. They follow distinct Period-Luminosity (PL) and Period-Wesenheit (PW) relations and pulsate in either the fundamental (F) or first overtone (1O) mode. Our goal is to assess the precision and accuracy of AC-based distances and evaluate their potential for establishing an independent distance scale. We derive new PL and PW relations for F-mode, 1O-mode, and, for the first time, combined F+1O ACs in the Magellanic Clouds. We study their wavelength dependence and apply the relations to estimate distances to Local Group stellar systems hosting ACs, while also confirming AC classifications. Our analysis is based on near-infrared time-series photometry in the Y, J, and Ks bands for about 200 ACs in the Magellanic Clouds from the VISTA survey of the Magellanic Clouds system (VMC, 2009-2018). VMC data are complemented with optical photometry from Gaia DR3 and OGLE-IV, which also provide periods and pulsation modes. Custom light-curve templates were used to derive precise intensity-averaged magnitudes for 118 ACs in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and 75 in the Small Magellanic Cloud. These data were used to derive multi-band PL and PW relations, calibrated using the geometric LMC distance from eclipsing binaries. We find that PL relation slopes increase and dispersions decrease with wavelength. Using Gaia parallaxes, we determine the LMC distance modulus and the LMC-SMC relative distance. We also confirm the AC nature of several new candidates in Galactic Globular Clusters and derive a distance modulus for the Draco dSph galaxy of 19.425+/-0.048 mag. A 0.1 mag discrepancy with RR Lyrae-based distances may reflect metallicity effects. Future spectroscopic surveys and Gaia DR4 will help refine the AC distance scale and quantify metallicity impacts.

 - **Abstract**
 The Parker Solar Probe (PSP) mission has revealed frequent occurrences of switchbacks (SBs) and small-scale magnetic flux ropes (SMFRs) as prominent structures within the solar wind. These mesoscale features are observed across all heliocentric distances, with heightened activity in the young solar wind, such as successive SMFRs, blobs, and SBs using PSP in situ observations. One study, in particular, focuses on SMFRs observed during the intervals of PSP co-rotating with the Sun, which suggests a similar source of the observed solar wind. In this letter, we identified SBs at the boundaries of SMFRs as a regularly observed phenomenon and found instances where SBs and SMFRs co-occur, with the significance level $\alpha<0.05$. The SMFR-related SBs - observed at the leading and trailing edges of an SMFR - exhibit well-organized axial co-orientations, with their polarity flipping, meaning the radial direction remains constrained while the transversal field reverses. Furthermore, the axial field directions of SMFRs-related SBs appear to be more closely connected than to another SB that is spatially closer and are linked to the SMFR orientation. Our analysis of their relative geometry, which examines the alignment between SBs and the SMFR axis, reveals a distinct tendency emphasizing their correlation, further supporting the idea that the axes of SMFR-related SBs are presumably determined by the SMFR orientation. Observations suggest that a fraction of SBs is spatially and temporally associated with SMFRs, implying that processes related to SMFR boundaries may contribute to SB formation, or that SBs tend to develop in magnetic environments shaped by SMFRs.

 - **Abstract**
 A primary characteristic of solar flares is the efficient acceleration of electrons to nonthermal deka-keV energies. While hard X-Ray (HXR) observation of bremsstrahlung emission serves as the key diagnostic of these electrons. In this study, we investigate the time evolution of flare-accelerated electrons using the warm-target model. This model, unlike the commonly used cold-target model, can determine the low-energy cut-off in the nonthermal electron distribution, so that the energetics of nonthermal electrons can be deduced more accurately. Here, we examine the time-evolution of nonthermal electrons in flares well-observed by the RHESSI and the Solar Orbiter (SolO, using the STIX instrument) spacecrafts. Using spectroscopic and imaging HXR observations, the time evolution of the low-energy cut-off of the accelerated electron distribution, the total power of nonthermal electrons, total rate of nonthermal electrons, and excess thermal emission measure from the nonthermal electrons, are investigated. We find that the time profile of the low-energy cut-off of the accelerated electron distribution shows a high-low-high trend around the HXR bursts of flares, while the time evolution of the total rate of injected electrons shows a low-high-low behavior. Although the total power of nonthermal electrons is sensitive to the cut-off energy, the temporal variation of the flare power follows the temporal variation of the acceleration rate. We further find that the highest contribution of the excess thermal emission measure coming from thermalization of injected electrons takes place around the hard X-ray peak.

 Scheduled for launch in 2030, the enhanced X-ray Timing and Polarization (eXTP) telescope is a Chinese space-based mission aimed at studying extreme conditions and phenomena in astrophysics. eXTP will feature three main payloads: Spectroscopy Focusing Arrays (SFAs), Polarimetry Focusing Arrays (PFAs), and a Wide-field Camera (W2C). This white paper outlines observatory science, incorporating key scientific advances and instrumental changes since the publication of the previous white paper [1]. We will discuss perspectives of eXTP on the research domains of flare stars, supernova remnants, pulsar wind nebulae, cataclysmic variables, X-ray binaries, ultraluminous X-ray sources, AGN, and pulsar-based positioning and timekeeping.

 In this new era of time-domain and multi-messenger astronomy, various new transients and new phenomena are constantly being discovered thanks to the rapid advances in observations, which provide the excellent opportunity to study the physics in the extreme environments. The enhanced X-ray Timing and Polarimetry mission (eXTP), planned to be launched in 2030, has several key advantages, including advanced polarimetry, high sensitivity & large effective area, and wide energy range coverage, which make it a groundbreaking project in high-energy astrophysics. In this article, we briefly introduce the potential time-domain and multi-messenger targets for eXTP, including gravitational-wave (GW) counterparts, gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), magnetars and fast radio bursts (FRBs), tidal disruption events (TDEs), supernovae, high energy neutrinos and TeV active galactic nucleus (AGNs), and so on. We discuss the advantages of future eXTP observations for detecting these sources, their detection capabilities, the abilities to distinguish theoretical models, and their applications in gravity and cosmology.

 In this paper we present the science potential of the enhanced X-ray Timing and Polarimetry (eXTP) mission, in its new configuration, for studies of strongly magnetized compact objects. We discuss the scientific potential of eXTP for QED studies, especially leveraging on the recent observations made with the NASA IXPE mission. Given eXTP's unique combination of timing, spectroscopy, and polarimetry, we focus on the perspectives for physics and astrophysics studies of strongly magnetized compact objects, such as magnetars and accreting X-ray pulsars. Developed by an international Consortium led by the Institute of High Energy Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the eXTP mission is expected to launch in early 2030.

 - **Abstract**
 Dark matter (DM) continues to evade direct detection, but neutron stars (NSs) serve as natural laboratories where even a modest DM component can alter their structure. While many studies have examined DM effects on NSs, they often rely on specific choices of equations of state (EOS) models, assume isotropy, and lack a Bayesian statistical framework, limiting their predictive power. In this work, we present a Bayesian framework that couples pressure-anisotropic nuclear EOS to a self-interacting fermionic DM component, constrained by NICER and GW170817 data. Our results show that DM mass fractions up to $\sim10\%$ remain consistent with current data, which softens the high-density EOS, leading to reduced stellar radii and tidal deformabilities while requiring negligible pressure anisotropy. Bayesian model comparison reveals no statistically significant preference between pure baryonic and DM-admixed NSs, indicating that DM inclusion enhances physical realism without complexity penalties. However, existing data cannot tightly constrain the DM parameters, and our empirical radius definition introduces a systematic bias toward the DM core configurations. To address this, we therefore introduce the DM radius span $\Delta R_\chi \equiv R_{\chi,\mathrm{max}} - R_{\chi,\mathrm{min}}$ as a unified diagnostic for DM distributions. This parameter simultaneously characterizes core-halo transition features while exhibiting strong linear correlations ($\Delta R_\chi < 4\,\mathrm{km}$) with both DM and BM parameters, providing a clear avenue for future constraints. Our approach bridges current limitations and future potential in probing DM through compact star observations.

 - **Abstract**
 We conducted a comprehensive analysis of young stellar object (YSO) variability at submillimeter and mid-infrared (mid-IR) wavelengths for the M\,17 \ion{H}{2} region, using 3.5 years monitoring data from the JCMT Transient Survey at $450$ and $850\,\mu$m and 9 years mid-IR monitoring data from the NEOWISE mission. Our study encompasses observations of 198 and 164 bright submillimeter peaks identified within the deep JCMT coadded maps at 450 and $850\,\mu$m, and 66 YSOs seen by NEOWISE W2 that were previously identified in mid-IR observations. We find one robust linear submillimeter variable, an intermediate mass protostar, with a $4\%$ peak flux change in 3.5 years of JCMT monitoring that sets a lower limit of $16\%$ luminosity increase for the source. At mid-IR wavelengths, our analysis reveals secular and stochastic variability in 22 YSOs, with the highest fraction of secular variability occurring at the earliest evolutionary stage. This mid-IR fractional variability as a function of evolutionary stage result is similar to what has previously been found for YSO variability within the Gould Belt and the intermediate-mass star formation region M17\,SWex, though overall less variability is detected in M\,17 in submillimeter and mid-IR. We suspect that this lower detection of YSO variability is due to both the greater distance to M\,17 and the strong feedback from the \ion{H}{2} region. Our findings showcase the utility of multiwavelength observations to better capture the complex variability phenomena inherent to star formation processes and demonstrate the importance of years-long monitoring of a diverse selection of star-forming environments.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed analysis of a C9.3 white-light flare using high-resolution observations from the New Vacuum Solar Telescope (NVST). The flare occurred near the eastern solar limb on September 11, 2023, within NOAA AR 13431, and produced beam electrons with energies just below 50 keV as observed by the the Hard X-ray Imager (HXI) onboard the Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory (ASO-S). Two white-light flare kernels were detected in the TiO band, connected by filamentary brightenings aligned with penumbral fibrils, suggesting a photospheric contribution to the white-light emission. Notably, the impact of the flare on the solar photosphere was characterized by sudden vortex flows and significant amplification of magnetic field in the white-light flare kernel region. We infer that this impact is driven by the propagation of flare-generated Alfvén wave pulses, which deposited energy into the photosphere. These observations support the potential role of the Alfvén wave mechanism in driving energy transport and heating during white-light flares.

 - **Abstract**
 Internal gas inflows driven by galaxy mergers are considered to enhance star formation rates (SFR), fuel supermassive black hole growth and stimulate active galactic nuclei (AGN). However, quantifying these phenomena remains a challenge, due to difficulties both in classifying mergers and in quantifying galaxy and AGN properties. We quantitatively examine the merger-SFR-AGN connection using Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) galaxies using novel methods for both galaxy classification and property measurements.} {Mergers in HSC-SSP observational images are identified through fine-tuning Zoobot, a pretrained deep representation learning model, using images and labels based on the Galaxy Cruise project. We use galaxy and AGN properties that were produced by fitting Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) spectra using the SED fitting code ProSpect, which fits panchromatically across the far-UV through far-infrared wavelengths and obtains galaxy and AGN properties simultaneously.} \textbf{{Little differences are seen in SFR and AGN activity between mergers and controls, with $\Delta \mathrm{SFR}=-0.009\pm 0.003$ dex, $\Delta f_{\mathrm{AGN}}=-0.010\pm0.033$ dex and $\Delta L_{\mathrm{AGN}}=0.002\pm0.025$ dex. After further visual purification of the merger sample, we find $\Delta \mathrm{SFR}=-0.033\pm0.014$ dex, $\Delta f_{\mathrm{AGN}}=-0.024\pm0.170$ dex, and $\Delta L_{\mathrm{AGN}}=0.019\pm0.129$ dex for pairs, and $\Delta \mathrm{SFR}=-0.057\pm0.024$ dex, $\Delta f_{\mathrm{AGN}}=0.286\pm0.270$ dex, and $\Delta L_{\mathrm{AGN}}=0.329\pm0.195$ dex for postmergers. These numbers suggest secular processes being an important driver for SF and AGN activity, and present a cautionary tale when using longer timescale tracers.

 We have examined the nuclear spectra of very massive star-forming galaxies at $z \sim 0$ to understand how they differ from other galaxies with comparable masses, which are typically passive. We selected a sample of 126 nearby massive star-forming galaxies ($<100~{\rm Mpc}$, $10^{11.3}~\rm{M_\odot} \leq M_{\rm stellar} \leq 10^{11.7}~\rm{M_\odot}$, $1 ~{\rm M_\odot~yr^{-1}}< {\rm SFR} <13 ~{\rm M_\odot~yr^{-1}}$) from the 2MRS-Bright WXSC catalogue. LEDA morphologies indicate at least 63\% of our galaxies are spirals, while visual inspection of Dark Energy Survey images reveals 75\% of our galaxies to be spirals with the remainder being lenticular. Of our sample 59 have archival nuclear spectra, which we have modelled and subsequently measured emission lines ([NII]$\rm{\lambda 6583}$, H$\alpha\rm{\lambda 6563}$, [OIII]$\rm{\lambda 5008}$, and H$\beta\rm{\lambda 4863}$), classifying galaxies as star-forming, LINERS, or AGNs. Using a BPT diagram we find $83 \pm 6$ \% of our galaxies, with sufficient signal-to-noise to measure all 4 emission lines, to be LINERs. Using the [NII]$\rm{\lambda 6583}$/H$\alpha\rm{\lambda 6563}$ emission line ratio alone we find that $79 \pm 6$ \% of the galaxies (46 galaxies) with archival spectra are LINERs, whereas just $\sim 30\%$ of the overall massive galaxy population are LINERs (Belfiore et al. 2016). Our sample can be considered a local analogue of the Ogle et al. (2016, 2019) sample of $z \sim 0.22$ massive star-forming galaxies in terms of selection criteria, and we find 64\% of their galaxies are LINERs using SDSS spectra. The high frequency of LINER emission in these massive star-forming galaxies indicates that LINER emission in massive galaxies may be linked to the presence of gas that fuels star formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Large number of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) producing Very-High-Energy (VHE) gamma-rays (energies above 100~GeV) has been revealed using observations with Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs). However, our knowledge of the VHE emitting AGN population is limited in the absence of an unbiased sky survey. We use long exposure of Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) to perform a survey of VHE emitting AGN at Galactic latitudes |b|>10 degrees. We consider clustering of gamma-ray events with energies E>100 GeV around positions of AGN from the 4-th LAT source catalog to select sources detected in the VHE range. The VHE AGN catalog produced in this way contains overall 175 sources detected with high confidence and additional 100 sources detected at more than 3-sigma level. It is 90% complete at the flux limit 1.3e-12 erg/cm2s. Less than half of the source sample (71) are previously reported VHE emitters, other sources are new detections in the VHE band. The majority of VHE AGN detectable at the survey flux limit are BL Lac type objects. We find their luminosity function to derive their spatial density (6.5+/-0.5)e-7/ Mpc3 and the characteristic luminosity scale ~1e44 erg/s. Ten sources in the VHE AGN catalog are nearby radio galaxies and seven are flat spectrum radio quasars, while 20 sources are unclassified AGN. We also include in our catalog four unidentified sources that may or may not be VHE AGN. 63 source in the catalog are "extreme" blazars, with 41 of them being new VHE band detections. In spite of the fact that the VHE flux is heavily attenuated by the pair production in interactions with Extragalactic Background Light (EBL), the catalog includes 7 sources at redshift larger than 1. Some of these sources show peculiar hardening of the VHE band spectra that point either to errors in redshift determination, or to limitations of modeling of cosmological evolution of EBL.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a census of the Compton-thick (CT) active galactic nucleus (AGN) population and the column density ($N_{\rm{H}}$) distribution of AGN in our cosmic backyard using a mid-infrared selected AGN sample within 15 Mpc. The column densities are measured from broadband X-ray spectral analysis, mainly using data from $\textit{Chandra}$ and $\textit{NuSTAR}$. Our sample probes AGN with intrinsic 2-10 keV luminosities of $L_{\rm 2-10, int} = 10^{37}$-$10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$, reaching a parameter space inaccessible to more distant samples. We directly measure a 32$^{+30}_{-18}\%$ CT AGN fraction and obtain an $N_{\rm{H}}$ distribution that agrees with that inferred by the $\textit{Swift}$-BAT survey. Restricting the sample to the largely unexplored domain of low-luminosity AGN with $L_{\rm 2-10, int}$ $\leq$ $10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$, we found a CT fraction of 19$^{+30}_{-14}\%$, consistent with those observed at higher luminosities. Comparing the host-galaxy properties between the two samples, we find consistent star formation rates, though the majority of our galaxy have lower stellar masses (by $\approx 0.3$ dex). In contrast, the two samples have very different black hole mass ($M_{\rm BH}$) distributions, with our sample having $\approx$1.5 dex lower mean mass ($M_{\rm BH}$ $\sim$ 10$^{6}$ $M_\odot$). Additionally, our sample contains a significantly higher number of LINERs and H$_{\rm{II}}$-type nuclei. The Eddington ratio range probed by our sample, however, is the same as $\textit{Swift}$-BAT, although the latter dominates at higher accretion rates, and our sample is more evenly distributed. The majority of our sample with $\lambda_{\rm Edd} \ge$ 10$^{-3}$ tend to be CT, while those with $\lambda_{\rm Edd} <$ 10$^{-3}$ are mostly unobscured or mildly obscured.
#### Fading in the Flow: Suppression of cold gas growth in expanding galactic outflows

 - **Abstract**
 Multiwavelength observations reveal multiphase outflows that play a crucial role in redistributing gas and metals in and around galaxies. Theoretical modelling of such multiphase outflows often employs wind tunnel simulations of a spherical cold ($\sim 10^4 \ \rm K$) cloud facing a uniform hot ($\sim 10^6\ \rm K$) wind. However, outflows are naturally expanding and wind conditions change downstream -- a crucial aspect overlooked in most idealized simulations. To address this, we examine how an expanding wind influences the survival, morphology, and dynamics of a cloud. We perform idealized hydrodynamic simulations of radiative cloud-crushing in an expanding wind, where the steady background wind is modelled using the adiabatic Chevalier & Clegg 1985 (CC85) analytic solution. Moving downstream, we find that the clouds remain locally isobaric with the wind, leading to a steep decline in their density contrast with respect to the ambient medium, and they eventually dissipate into the wind. This also suppresses the growth of cold gas mass in comparison to a plane-parallel wind since entrained clouds move into a less radiative background. Using analytic scaling arguments, we present a physical picture of cloud evolution in a CC85 wind. Cloud expansion and local pressure equilibrium are the key regulators of cold mass growth. Unlike traditional homogeneous wind tunnel simulations, our simulations account for the differential expansion experienced by the long cometary tails of clouds moving in an outflow. Consequently, a strong head-to-tail emission gradient in the filamentary cold gas tails develop -- features closer to observations. In addition, we demonstrate that the dynamics of individual clouds may substantially alter the radial properties of their host multiphase outflows.
#### The detection of spatially resolved protosteller outflows and episodic jets in the outer Galaxy

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first detection of spatially resolved protostellar outflows and jets in the outer Galaxy. We observed five star-forming regions in the outer Galaxy (Sh 2--283, NOMF05-16/19/23/63; galactocentric distance = 15.7--17.4 kpc) with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). Towards Sh 2--283, we have detected distinct outflow ($\sim$5--50 km s$^{-1}$) and jet components ($\sim$50--100 km s$^{-1}$) associated with the protostar in CO(3--2) emission. The outflows and jets are well-collimated, with the jets exhibiting multiple bullet structures. The position-velocity diagram along the CO flow axis shows two characteristic structures: (a) the flow velocity which linearly increases with the position offset from the core center (Hubble-like flow), and (b) continuous velocity components of the periodical flows (spine-like structures), which may indicate the episodic mass-ejection event. The time intervals of the mass-ejection events are estimated to be 900--4000 years based on the slopes of these spine-like structures. These characteristics align with those of nearby protostellar systems, indicating that early star formation in low-metallicity environments, such as the outer Galaxy, resembles that in the inner Galaxy. In contrast to the physical similarities, the $N\mathrm{(SiO)}$/$N\mathrm{(CO)}$ ratio in the jet bullet appears to be lower than that measured in the low-mass protostellar sources in the inner Galaxy. This may indicate the different shock chemistry or different dust composition in the outer Galaxy source, although non-LTE effects could also affect the observed low $N\mathrm{(SiO)}$/$N\mathrm{(CO)}$ ratio. We also report the new detection of the other 4 outflow sources in the outer Galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, it has been noticed that the discrepancies in the integrated colour indices (CIs) between star clusters and models are mostly due to the projection of bright stars in the apertures. In order to reduce this problem, the method of adaptive aperture photometry has been proposed. This method has been applied to star clusters from the M 31 Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) survey, and studies show that the adaptive aperture photometry performs better than the conventional approach. The aim of this study is to determine the best achievable limits on the accuracy and applicability of the aperture photometry method for studying star clusters in the local Universe. We computed a large network of artificial 3D star clusters spanning the parameter space of the M 31 clusters. We then simulated images of these clusters by projecting each onto a 2D plane from 100 directions. Star cluster images were generated in six passbands to match the PHAT survey. To investigate the limiting accuracy of aperture photometry and the limits of its applicability to star cluster studies, we measured the simulated images and performed parameter determination tests. We demonstrate that star clusters with and without post-main-sequence stars have significant photometric differences. We show that in order to obtain reliable physical parameters of star clusters, the CIs must be measured using an aperture with a radius larger than the cluster's half-light radius. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the parameter determination of young clusters (~10 Myr) is problematic regardless of the aperture size used. Therefore, it is advisable to determine the parameters of these clusters using colour-magnitude diagram fitting methods, when possible. We also show that the randomness of the viewing angle can lead to a CI uncertainty of up to 0.1 mag, depending on cluster parameters and aperture size.

 - **Abstract**
 Phase mixing has long been understood to be a viable mechanism for expediting the dissipation of Alfvén wave energy resulting in the subsequent heating of the solar atmosphere. To fulfil the conditions necessary for phase mixing to occur, we consider the cross-field gradient in the Alfvén speed as a free parameter in our model. Using a single-fluid description of a partially ionized chromospheric plasma, we explore the efficiency of damping of shear Alfvén waves subject to phase mixing when a pulse wave driver is employed. Our results demonstrate a strong dependence of the dissipation length of shear Alfvén waves on both the ionization degree of the plasma and the gradient of the Alfvén speed. When assessing the efficiency of phase mixing across various inhomogeneities, our findings indicate that waves originating from a pulse driver exhibit initially identical heating rates as those generated by a continuous wave driver. One key difference observed was that Alfvén pulses possess a lower overall decay rate due to a change in damping profile from exponential to algebraic. This discrepancy arises from the absence of a consistent injection of energy into the base of the domain, that preserves longitudinal gradients of the magnetic field perturbations more effectively. These findings demonstrate the importance of understanding the relations between the wave driver, damping mechanisms, and propagation dynamics in resolving the atmospheric heating problem.

 - **Abstract**
 Baryonic physics has a considerable impact on the distribution of matter in our Universe on scales probed by current and future cosmological surveys, acting as a key systematic in such analyses. We seek simple symbolic parametrisations for the impact of baryonic physics on the matter power spectrum for a range of physically motivated models, as a function of wavenumber, redshift, cosmology, and parameters controlling the baryonic feedback. We use symbolic regression to construct analytic approximations for the ratio of the matter power spectrum in the presence of baryons to that without such effects. We obtain separate functions of each of four distinct sub-grid prescriptions of baryonic physics from the CAMELS suite of hydrodynamical simulations (Astrid, IllustrisTNG, SIMBA and Swift-EAGLE) as well as for a baryonification algorithm. We also provide functions which describe the uncertainty on these predictions, due to both the stochastic nature of baryonic physics and the errors on our fits. The error on our approximations to the hydrodynamical simulations is comparable to the sample variance estimated through varying initial conditions, and our baryonification expression has a root mean squared error of better than one percent, although this increases on small scales. These errors are comparable to those of previous numerical emulators for these models. Our expressions are enforced to have the physically correct behaviour on large scales and at high redshift. Due to their analytic form, we are able to directly interpret the impact of varying cosmology and feedback parameters, and we can identify parameters which have little to no effect. Each function is based on a different implementation of baryonic physics, and can therefore be used to discriminate between these models when applied to real data. We provide publicly available code for all symbolic approximations found.

 - **Abstract**
 Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are powered by accretion disks onto supermassive black holes in the the centers of galaxies. AGN are believed to play important roles in the evolution of both supermassive black holes and their host galaxies over cosmic time. AGN and the nuclear star clusters (NSCs) that interact with them remain unresolved with present and planned telescopes. As a result, the properties of AGN and NSCs are highly uncertain. Here we review how binary black hole (BBH) mergers can occur in AGN disks and how both the gravitational wave (GW) and electromagnetic wave (EM) properties of such mergers allow us to reverse-engineer the properties of AGN disks and NSCs over cosmic time. We point out that the feature in the BBH mass spectrum around $\sim 35M_{\odot}$ is an excellent probe of hierarchical merger models. Likewise constraints on the spins of upper-mass gap BH ($\gtrsim 50M_{\odot}$) test the AGN channel. The effective spin ($\chi_{\rm eff}$) distribution, including asymmetry, islands of structure and magnitudes are excellent tests of AGN model predictions. We also argue, that the rate of AGN-driven BBH mergers as a function of redshift should scale slightly shallower than the AGN number density, at least out to redshifts of $\sim 2$, and should turnover at the same redshift as the AGN number density. Finally, we emphasize a determination of an AGN fraction of observed BBH mergers ($f_{\rm BBH,AGN}$), \emph{regardless of the actual value}, allows us to infer the average properties of AGN disks and NSCs out to high redshift.

 - **Abstract**
 Although all coronal mass ejections (CMEs) that propagate into the heliosphere should contain a magnetic flux rope (MFR) component, the majority do not exhibit the expected white-light MFR morphology of a leading edge plus cavity. This different appearance could be the result of distortion of the internal magnetic structure, merging with other structures, or simply projection effects. These factors complicate the interpretation of CMEs. This complexity is exemplified by a CME observed on 28 March 2022. The event originated from a single eruption, evolving as a textbook CME in the low corona but appearing as a complex two-MFR structure in white-light observations. Why? To answer this question, we performed a multi-view data and modeling analysis to describe the CME coronal evolution. The thermodynamic MHD model, CORHEL-CME, helps reveal the magnetic configuration of this CME and also reveals that the ambient field plays a crucial role in shaping the complex structure of the CME during early evolution. Our research underscores the importance of integrating multiview observations with physics-based models to gain a deeper insight into the development of complex CMEs.
#### Evidence for a sign change of the ISW effect in the very recent universe: hot voids and cold overdensities at $z<0.03$

 - **Abstract**
 We find that CMB photons passing through local voids ($z<0.03$) are hotter than expected at the $2.7-3.6\sigma$ level. Combined with earlier findings showing a $>5\sigma$ cooling of CMB photons in galactic filaments in the same redshift range, we now have possible evidence for a negative Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect in the very recent universe. In addition to having opposite sign, the observed amplitude is an order of magnitude larger than the predicted Rees-Sciama and ISW effects for the nearby universe. An altered growth of gravitational potentials at very low redshift, as predicted by some dark energy and modified gravity models, could give rise to the observed sign change. We discuss the results in light of the latest Data Release 2 results of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) showing evidence for dynamical dark energy. When removing the CMB quadrupole, we find the temperatures measured in voids to a large degree uncorrelated with the temperature measured in galaxies and the observed mean difference of $41\mu$K between void and galaxy temperatures is about $6.5\sigma$ larger than found in simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 The evolution of warped disks is governed by internal, oscillatory shear flows driven by their distorted geometry. However, these flows are known to be vigorously unstable to a hydrodynamic parametric instability. In many warped systems this might coexist and compete with the magnetorotational instability. The interplay of these phenomena and their combined impact on the internal flows has not been studied. To this end we perform three-dimensional, magneto+hydrodynamic unstratified shearing box simulations with an oscillatory radial forcing function, to mimic the effects of a warped disk. In the hydrodynamic study we find that the parametric instability manifests as strong, vertical `elevator' flows which resist the sloshing motion. Above a critical forcing amplitude, these also emerge in our magnetized runs and dominate the vertical stress, although they are partially weakened by the MRI and hence the system equilibrates with larger radial sloshing flows. Below this critical forcing, the MRI effectively quenches the parametric instability. In all cases we find that the internal stresses are anisotropic in character and better described by a viscoelastic relationship with the shearing flows. Unfortunately, these important effects are typically unresolved in global simulations of warped disks and are simplified in analytically tractable models. The incorporation of such complex, warp-amplitude-dependent, viscoelastic stresses will sensitively regulate the laminar flow response, and inevitably modify the detailed spatio-temporal evolution of warped systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Diffuse, low surface-brightness radio emission in merging galaxy clusters provides insights into cosmic structure formation, the growth of magnetic fields, and turbulence. This paper reports a search for diffuse radio emission in a pilot sample of six high-redshift ($1.01 < z < 1.31$) galaxy clusters from the MeerKAT Massive Distant Cluster Survey (MMDCS). These six clusters are selected as the most massive $(M_{\rm 500c} = 6.7\,- 8.5 \times 10^{14}~\rm{M_{\odot}})$ systems based on their Sunyaev-Zel'dovich mass from the full MMDCS sample of 30 ACT DR5 clusters, and were observed first to explore the high-mass, high-redshift regime. Diffuse radio emission is confidently detected in four clusters and tentatively identified in two, with $k$-corrected radio powers scaled to 1.4 GHz ranging from $(0.46 \pm 0.16)$ to $(4.51 \pm 1.68) \times 10^{24}\, \mathrm{WHz^{-1}}$ and linear sizes between 0.47 and 1.08 Mpc. Combining $Chandra$ X-ray data with MeerKAT radio data, we find that 80$\%$ of clusters with X-ray observations exhibit disturbed morphologies indicative of mergers. These $z > 1$ galaxy clusters scatter around the established radio power-mass scaling relation observed at lower redshifts, supporting turbulent re-acceleration models in high-redshift mergers. However, their radio spectra are predicted to steepen ($\alpha < -1.5$) due to enhanced inverse Compton losses in the cosmic microwave background, rendering them under-luminous at 1.4 GHz and placing them below the correlation. Our results demonstrate that merger-driven turbulence can sustain radio halos even at $z > 1$ while highlighting MeerKAT's unique ability to probe non-thermal processes in the early universe.

 Coronal waves, significant solar phenomena, act as diagnostic tools for scientists studying solar atmosphere properties. Here, we present a novel observation detailing how a coronal wave event, associated with an X5.0 class flare, influenced the properties of an adjacent coronal hole through interaction. The coronal wave was observed in both extreme ultraviolet observations from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly aboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory and Lyman-alpha observations from the Solar Disk Imager aboard the Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory. Utilizing the method of differential emission measure, we found that as the coronal wave passed through, the adjacent coronal hole experienced an increase in temperature from 1.31 to 1.43 MK and a rise in density from $\sim$1.62$\times10^{8}$ to 1.76$\times10^{8}$ cm$^{-3}$ within the rising period of $\sim$7 minutes. Subsequently, after the wave passed, the entire coronal hole transitioned to a new state with a slight temperature increase and a 14$\%$ decrease in density, with more pronounced changes observed at the coronal hole's boundary. Taking into account the impacts of radiative loss and heat conduction, the coronal wave was estimated to provide an average energy of 2.2$\times10^{8}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ to the coronal hole during the short rising period. This study highlights the identification of the coronal wave in both extreme ultraviolet and Lyman-alpha observations, shedding light on the significant energy input, particularly within the coronal hole. These findings provide new insights into better understanding kinematics of fast coronal waves, energy transfer processes open versus closed magnetic topologies, and the possible acceleration of solar winds.

 - **Abstract**
 Radio-loud active galaxies (RLAGN) can exhibit various morphologies. The Fanaroff-Riley (FR) classifications, which are defined by the locations of peaks in surface brightness, have been applied to many catalogues of RLAGN. The FR classifications were initially found to correlate with radio luminosity. However, recent surveys have demonstrated that radio luminosity alone does not reliably predict radio morphology. We have devised a new-semi automated method involving ridgeline characterisations to compile the largest known classified catalogue of RLAGN to date with data from the second data release of the LOFAR Two-Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS DR2). We reassess the FR divide and its cause by examining the physical and host galaxy properties of $3590$ FRIIs and $2354$ FRIs (at $z \leq 0.8$). We find that RLAGN near the FR divide with $10^{25} \le L_{144} \le 10^{26} $ WHz$^{-1}$ are more likely to show FRI over FRII morphology if they occupy more massive host galaxies. We find no correlation, when considering selection effects, between the FR break luminosity and stellar mass or host-galaxy rest-frame absolute magnitude. Overall, we find the cause of different radio morphologies in this sample to be complex. Considering sources near the FR divide with $10^{25} \le L_{144} \le 10^{26} $ WHz$^{-1}$, we find evidence to support inner environment having a role in determining jet disruption. We make available a public catalogue of morphologies for our sample, which will be of use for future investigations of RLAGN and their impact on their surroundings.

 We present measurements of the radial profile of mass and galaxy number density around X-ray selected ROSAT All Sky Survey-Multi-Component Matched Filter galaxy clusters using Year 3 data from the Dark Energy Survey. We measure the projected cross-correlation signal of the RedMaGiC "high density" galaxies around an approximately volume-limited sample of 255 galaxy clusters at a median redshift of $z=0.4$ and an X-ray luminosity $L_X > 10^{44} \,\text{ergs} \, \text{s}^{-1} \, \text{h}^{-2}$. This cross-correlation signal measured with a signal-to-noise ratio of 16.41 allows us to infer a 3D number density profile which shows a significant steepening at the edges of these galaxy clusters, namely the splashback radius of $r_{sp}$ /$h^{-1} \mathrm{M_{\odot}} = 2.19^{+0.50}_{-0.43}$. We present the dependence of the splashback radius value over a range of absolute galaxy magnitude cuts to look for any evidence of dynamical friction affecting these results. The weak lensing signal around our galaxy clusters measured with a signal-to-noise ratio of 32.19 allows us to infer a halo mass $\text{log} (M_{\rm 200m} / h^{-1} \text{Mpc}) = 14.68_{-0.04}^{+0.04}$. Comparison of the location of the splashback radius with the spherical overdensity boundary $r_{\rm 200m}$ shows consistency with the $\mathrm{\Lambda CDM}$ predictions. We present the first inference of the average mass accretion rate of galaxy clusters using our measurements of the splashback radius.

 - **Abstract**
 The dispersion of extragalactic fast radio bursts (FRBs) can serve as a powerful probe of the diffuse plasma between and surrounding galaxies, which contains most of the Universe's baryons. By cross-correlating the dispersion of background FRBs with the locations of foreground galaxies, we can study the relative spatial distributions of plasma and galaxies on scales of 0.1 to 50 Mpc, which are strongly affected by feedback processes in galaxy formation. Here we present the measurement of the dispersion$\unicode{x2013}$galaxy angular cross-power spectrum between 2873 FRBs from the Second CHIME/FRB Catalog and nearly 6 million galaxies from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Legacy Imaging Survey. Over five photometric galaxy redshift bins spanning $0.05 < z <0.5$ and at 5.1$\sigma$ significance, we make the first definitive detection of spatial correlations in FRB dispersion measure due to cosmic structure. While parameter inferences should be interpreted with caution because of incomplete modelling of both the signal and systematic errors, our data indicate that the plasma$\unicode{x2013}$galaxy cross-power spectrum cuts off relative to the matter power spectrum at a scale $k_\textrm{cut}^{-1}=0.9^{+0.4}_{-0.4}\,\textrm{Mpc}$. This scale is consistent with those X-ray stacking analyses that suggest dark-matter halos with group-scale masses are largely evacuated of their baryons by feedback processes. Our study demonstrates that FRBs are promising tools to discern the physics of baryonic structure formation and will only become more powerful as FRB surveys expand.

 - **Abstract**
 In a previous study, we used JWST to identify three new brown dwarfs in the center of a nearby star-forming cluster, IC 348. The faintest object had an estimated mass of 3-4 $M_{\rm Jup}$, making it a contender for the least massive brown dwarf confirmed with spectroscopy. Two of the new brown dwarfs also exhibited absorption features from an unidentified aliphatic hydrocarbon, which were not predicted by atmospheric models and were not previously detected in atmospheres outside of the solar system. We have used JWST to perform a deeper survey for brown dwarfs across a larger field in IC 348. We have identified 39 brown dwarf candidates in NIRCam images and have obtained spectra for 15 of them with NIRSpec, nine of which are classified as substellar members of the cluster. The faintest new members have mass estimates of $\sim2$ $M_{\rm Jup}$, providing a new constraint on the minimum mass of the IMF. Two new members ($\sim2$ and 10 $M_{\rm Jup}$) exhibit large excess emission from circumstellar disks, demonstrating that they harbor the raw materials for planet formation. Finally, eight of the nine new brown dwarfs and one known member that is newly observed with NIRSpec show the aforementioned hydrocarbon features. Among the total of 11 brown dwarfs in IC 348 that have hydrocarbon detections, the features are stronger at fainter magnitudes, indicating that the hydrocarbon is a natural constituent of the atmospheres of the coolest newborn brown dwarfs. We propose a new spectral class "H" that is defined by the presence of the 3.4 $\mu$m fundamental band of the hydrocarbon.
