#### Quenching pathways in the green valley at low redshift: confronting SDSS AGN hosts with IllustrisTNG and EAGLE

 - **Abstract**
 We compare low-redshift ($z<0.1$) BPT-selected pure optical AGN hosts in SDSS DR7 to colour-selected "green-valley" analogue central galaxies in IllustrisTNG100 and EAGLE Ref-L0100N1504. To reduce cross-dataset systematics, we define the green valley internally using $(g-r)$ percentiles: for galaxies with $\log_{10}(M_\star/M_\odot)>10$, we select the 75th-95th percentiles (SDSS observed-frame fibre colours; simulations rest-frame synthetic colours within 30 kpc). SDSS hosts are linked to the MPA-JHU catalogue for stellar masses and aperture-corrected total SFRs. TNG green-valley centrals are almost entirely quenched, with a sharp pile-up at the imposed SFR floor and median $\log_{10}\mathrm{sSFR}\simeq-14.85$ ($\sim$3.5 dex below SDSS). EAGLE instead produces a broad, continuous distribution with median $\log_{10}\mathrm{sSFR}\simeq-11.71$ and substantial overlap with SDSS, robust to varying the lower percentile between 60 and 90. At fixed mass, TNG yields higher green-valley occupancy fractions (reaching $\gtrsim60$ per cent near $M_\star\sim10^{11}M_\odot$) than EAGLE (20-40 per cent). A simple forward model of nebular line ratios places EAGLE analogues across the star-forming and composite loci in the BPT plane, while TNG analogues concentrate in a LINER-like, low-sSFR regime. We infer that TNG's kinetic mode drives an efficient, near-binary shutdown of star formation, whereas EAGLE's stochastic thermal feedback supports a slower decline more consistent with local AGN hosts. All catalogues and analysis scripts are publicly released.

 - **Abstract**
 The MAGIC detection of near-TeV gamma-rays from the 2021 outburst of the recurrent nova RS Ophiuchi (RS Oph) has established it as a TeV-scale particle accelerator. However, the underlying production mechanism --\textit{hadronic} versus \textit{leptonic}-- remains uncertain due to the non-detection of coincident neutrinos at IceCube. Indeed, the neutrino flux predicted by the hadronic model for RS Oph was below IceCube sensitivity. T Coronae Borealis (T CrB), a nova similar to RS Oph, is anticipated to undergo an outburst soon. Being closer to Earth (0.8 kpc versus 2.45 kpc for RS Oph), T CrB is expected to yield a higher neutrino flux, making the upcoming outburst a once in a lifetime opportunity to test-and potentially detect-nova neutrinos. In this work, we present the first model-based estimates of the hadronic secondary fluxes from T CrB and assess their detectability with gamma-ray (LHAASO, Fermi-LAT, MAGIC, H.E.S.S., MACE, and HERD) and neutrino (IceCube and KM3NeT) telescopes. We adopt two proton-acceleration mechanisms: (i) an external shock (ES) driven mechanism at the interaction ($10^{13}$ cm) of nova ejecta and the red giant wind, and (ii) magnetic reconnection (MR) near the white dwarf surface ($10^{9}$ cm). The latter, arising deep inside the nova system, will fully absorb gamma-rays while allowing only neutrinos to escape. This could potentially produce neutrino signals hours before the ES origin photons or neutrinos-a unique temporal delay signature. For our benchmark ES model, gamma-rays are detectable across all facilities, while the neutrino detection prospect is poor. Only a tiny upper part of the ES model parameter space is above IceCube/KM3NeT sensitivity. In contrast, both observatories have significantly better prospects for detecting neutrinos in the MR scenario.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar variability may originate from various phenomena such as binarity, pulsations, or rotation. These mechanisms can induce flux variations of similar magnitudes, shapes, and periods. We aim to determine mechanisms responsible for the sinusoidal variations in main-sequence stars hotter than 6500 K. We conducted our analysis using TESS long-cadence data complemented with high-resolution spectra from three spectrographs. From the initial sample of almost 46000 objects, we selected 35 targets for spectroscopic follow-up. Comparison of light curves and radial velocity curves allowed for robust classification of these targets. Among the 35 selected objects, 18 displayed variability, suggesting the presence of a companion (including the discovery of 7 new binary systems and 1 candidate for a triple-star system), 1 was identified as a new pulsator, 9 as new candidates for spotted stars, and 7 objects had uncertain classification. Our analysis shows that at least half of randomly selected stars with sinusoidal brightness variations are binaries. The presented results illustrate the need for an individual approach to stellar classification, especially in cases where the photometric data alone is insufficient for determining the underlying phenomena behind the observed variations.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar convection in the presence of magnetic field affects the emergent intensity, as well as the structure and evolution of cool main-sequence dwarfs. We aim to understand the effect of faculae-like field strengths on near-surface stellar convection using 3D radiative MHD simulations of near-surface magneto-convection. We compare simulations of F, G, K and M main-sequence stars with a small-scale dynamo (SSD) to faculae-like spatially averaged field strengths (from 100 to 500 G). We focus on the effect of imposed magnetic field on the thermodynamic stratification and velocities, along with the bolometric intensity and surface field strength. Imposed magnetic fields result in reduced average density and gas pressure near the surface compared to the SSD simulations. The temperature stratification also shows a dip at and just below the stellar surface. The changes in average bolometric intensity are within a percent, with different trends with field strength for different stellar types. In addition, the convective velocities are reduced. The magnitude of changes in thermodynamic quantities are related to field strength as well as the stellar $T_{\rm eff}$. Faculae-strength magnetic fields modify the near surface convection by reducing gas pressure and density as well as suppressing convection in regions with strong field concentrations. The strength of these effects depends on the stellar type.

 - **Abstract**
 We present observational evidence supporting the presence of a stratified accretion disk wind in active galactic nuclei (AGN), based on multi-wavelength spectroscopic analysis of broad and narrow emission lines. The diversity in emission line profiles, ionization potentials, and kinematic signatures suggests a structured outflow emerging from the accretion disk, with different zones contributing to specific spectral features. High-ionization lines (e.g., Civ {\lambda}1549) exhibit strong blueshifts and asymmetric profiles indicative of fast, inner winds, while low-ionization lines (e.g., H\b{eta}, Mgii {\lambda} 2800) show more symmetric profiles consistent with predominant emission from slower, denser regions farther out, although exhibiting systematic blueshifts in quasars radiating at high Eddington ratios. The intermediate ionization lines (e.g., Aliii {\lambda}1860) present a situation that is intermediate in terms of shift amplitudes, although in several super-Eddington candidates radial outflow velocity may reach values comparable to the ones of the high ionization lines. These results are consistent with radiatively driven wind models featuring radial stratification. We made preliminary photoionization modeling assuming unabsorbed radiation emitted from the corona and the hotter disk regions emission or absorbed by a layer of gas. Our findings provide new constraints on the geometry and physical conditions of AGN winds, providing clear evidence in favor of stratified wind emission.

 - **Abstract**
 Intense magnetic fields in the atmospheres of neutron stars render non-trivial angular dependence of intensity and polarization of soft X-ray emission originating from their surfaces. By tracking the complex electric field vector for each photon during its atmospheric transport and propagation in general relativistic and birefringent magnetospheres, our Monte Carlo simulation, named MAGTHOMSCATT, allows for capturing the complete polarization properties, including the intricate interplay between linearity and circularity. The new inclusion in MAGTHOMSCATT of quantum electrodynamical influences on polarization in the magnetosphere is presented. We simulate the pulsed and polarized X-ray emission from the outer layers of optically thick, fully ionized atmospheres of neutron stars, with a focus on the radiation emitted from extended polar caps of magnetars, which are the most highly magnetized neutron stars. Using the recent intensity pulse profile data for the magnetar 1RXS J11708-4009, we constrain the geometric parameters, namely the angles between the magnetic axis and the observer's viewing direction relative to the spin axis, as well as the sizes of emission regions. The distributions of these parameters and the best-fit configuration are provided. In addition, we discuss the important impacts of vacuum birefringence in the magnetosphere on increasing the linear polarization degree. A comparison with the case of a weakly magnetized neutron star, RX J0822.0-4300, is also discussed. Our simulation still needs further development, particularly to incorporate the vacuum resonance effect. Nevertheless, the formalism presented here can be employed to constrain geometric parameters for various types of neutron stars.
#### The GLASS-JWST Early Release Science Program. V. H$α$ luminosity functions at $z\sim1.3$ and $z\sim2.0$

 - **Abstract**
 We present H$\alpha$ luminosity function (LF) measurements at redshifts $z\sim1.3$ and $z\sim2.0$ using JWST NIRISS grism data from the GLASS-JWST survey. Based on emission lines spectroscopically identified in the F115W, F150W and F200W filters, we select 99 H$\alpha$ emitters. Through detailed effective volume and completeness analysis for each source, we construct the H$\alpha$ LF in two redshift bins. Thanks to the sensitivity of NIRISS WFSS and gravitational lensing magnification, our sample reaches intrinsic H$\alpha$ luminosities $\sim$10 times deeper than previous grism surveys, down to $L_{\rm H\alpha}\sim10^{40.5}~\rm erg~s^{-1}$ at $z\sim1.3$ and $L_{\rm H\alpha}\sim10^{40.9}~\rm erg~s^{-1}$ at $z\sim2.0$ with completeness larger than 0.8, corresponding to star formation rates of 0.4 and 1.0 $M_{\odot}~\rm yr^{-1}$, respectively. We robustly constrain the faint-end slope of the H$\alpha$ luminosity function to be $-1.50^{+0.14}_{-0.08}$ at $z\sim1.3$ and $-1.60^{+0.17}_{-0.09}$ at $z\sim2.0$ after considering the cosmic variance of $\sim 20\%$, consistent with previous estimations. The emission-line samples presented here will enable further detailed studies of galaxy properties including metallicities. We find a negligible contribution from bright active galactic nuclei in our sample. We estimate integrated cosmic star formation rate densities of $0.097^{+0.015}_{-0.016}~M_{\odot}~\rm yr^{-1}~Mpc^{-3}$ at $z\sim1.3$ and $0.129^{+0.025}_{-0.030}~M_{\odot}~\rm yr^{-1}~Mpc^{-3}$ at $z\sim2.0$. The methodology presented here can be readily applicable to other JWST slitless spectroscopic datasets and future wide-field slitless surveys, including those from Euclid, Roman, and the Chinese Space Station Telescope.
#### Unveiling Multimessenger Emission from Hidden Cores of Microquasars

 - **Abstract**
 Microquasars are radio-emitting X-ray binaries accompanied by relativistic jets. They are established sources of 100~TeV gamma rays and are considered promising candidates for cosmic-ray acceleration. Motivated by recent detections of $\sim 100~$TeV photons from Cygnus~X-1 and $\sim~$PeV photons from Cygnus~X-3 by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO), we employ the Astrophysical Multimessenger Emission Simulator (AMES) to model their multimessenger emission considering compact outflow regions as cosmic-ray accelerators, spanning from radio to ultra-high-energy gamma rays. Our results show that the observed $>$TeV gamma rays can originate from either $p\gamma$ or $pp$ interactions, depending on the location and physical conditions of the emission region, while also reproducing the lower-energy spectra. The different configurations yield unique, observationally testable predictions. In the $0.1-10$~TeV energy range, where current observations provide only upper limits, they predict either a deep dip, a mild suppression, or a power-law spectrum. Additionally, models involving AU-scale blob regions predict strong variability, while those invoking more extended and static external zones show more stable behavior. We also provide a possible qualitative explanation for the distinct modulation patterns across different energy bands, which relies primarily on changes in the Doppler factor and external $\gamma\gamma$ absorption. Finally, our neutrino predictions, which properly account for muon and pion cooling effects, reveal a significantly suppressed flux, indicating that detecting these sources may be more challenging than previously anticipated.
#### Interpreting the diversity of afterglow emission from radio-detected tidal disruption events with instantaneous and delayed outflows

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal disruption events (TDEs) occur when a star is gravitationally disrupted by the tidal field of a supermassive black hole during a close encounter. Radio emission has recently been detected in TDEs and is commonly attributed to synchrotron radiation from both wind and jetted outflows. However, several TDEs exhibit bright radio flares at late times, which cannot be easily explained if the wind is launched promptly after the stellar disruption. In this study, we model the radio light curves of TDEs with delayed radio flares using three scenarios: an instantaneous wind, a delayed wind, and a delayed relativistic jet. We show that the instantaneous wind model struggles to reproduce delayed radio flare events, indicating the necessity of an additional delayed outflow component. In contrast, the delayed wind model provides a consistent explanation for the observed radio phenomenology, successfully reproducing events both with and without delayed radio flares. For some delayed radio flare events (e.g., ASASSN-15oi and AT 2019dsg), both the delayed wind and delayed jet models can reproduce the observed radio light curves. The delayed jet model produces x-ray and optical emission that is detectable at typical TDE distances, in contrast to wind-driven scenarios. This highlights how multiwavelength observations offer an effective means of distinguishing among possible outflow mechanisms.

 - **Abstract**
 Cepheids are fundamental distance indicators, playing a crucial role not only in the cosmic distance ladder but also in mapping the structure, kinematics, and extinction properties of the Milky Way. Using high-precision photometry and parallaxes from $Gaia$, we identify a significant anti-correlation between the $G$-band extinction coefficient and reddening for Galactic Cepheids, quantified as $R_G = 1.921 \pm 0.060 - (0.107 \pm 0.022)\,E(G_{\mathrm{BP}} - G_{\mathrm{RP}})$. We propose that this anti-correlation is partly driven by the pronounced non-linear effects inherent to the broad $Gaia$ bands, while the remaining part arise from the $R_V$ variations caused by diverse interstellar medium. Adopting a fixed $R_G$ would not only lead to an overestimation of the metallicity dependence of Cepheid luminosities, but also systematically underestimate the distances to highly reddened Cepheids. Moreover, the strong reddening dependence of $R_G$ makes Wesenheit function based on it unsuitable for highly reddened Cepheids, since the definition of Wesenheit magnitudes requires a fixed extinction coefficient. In contrast, infrared-based distances, being less affected by non-linear effects and insensitive to $R_V$, provide the most reliable Cepheid distances at present. This work emphasizes the importance of accurately determining $R_V$ for Galactic Cepheids and accounting for non-linear effects in distance measurements, particularly in the optical bands.
#### Kilonova and progenitor properties of merger-driven gamma-ray bursts

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) prompt and afterglow emission, as well as a kilonova (KN), are the expected electromagnetic (EM) counterparts of Binary Neutron Star (BNS) and Neutron Star -- Black Hole (NSBH) mergers. We aim to infer the KN ejecta parameters and the progenitor properties by modeling merger-driven GRBs with a claim of KN, good data and robust redshift measurement. We model the afterglow and KN, and perform a Bayesian analysis, within the Nuclear physics and Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (NMMA) framework. The KN emission is modeled with the radiative transfer code POSSIS and for afterglow we use the afterglowpy library. In contrast to previous approaches, our methodology simultaneously models both afterglow and KN. We find that all GRBs in our sample have a KN, but we were unable to confirm or exclude its presence in GRB 150101B. A BNS progenitor is favored for GRB 160821B, GRB 170817A/AT2017gfo, GRB 211211A, and GRB 230307A. For GRB 150101B and GRB 191019A, we obtain a slight preference for NSBH scenario, while a BNS is also viable. For KN emission, we find that the median wind mass $\langle M_{\rm wind}\rangle=0.027^{+0.046}_{-0.019}$ $M_{\odot}$ is larger than the dynamical $\langle M_{\rm dyn}\rangle = 0.012^{+0.007}_{-0.006}$ $M_{\odot}$. We find that $M_{\rm wind}$ and the beaming corrected kinetic energy of the jet can be attributed as $log(M_{\rm wind})=-20.23+0.38\,log(E_{0,J})$. We confirm the results of numerical simulation that $\tilde\Lambda$ increases with decrease in $\mathcal{M}_{\rm \,Chirp}$. Our work shows that EM modeling can be effective for probing the progenitors, and for the first time presents the progenitor properties of a sizable sample of merger-driven GRBs.

 - **Abstract**
 Filamentary infrared dark clouds (IRDCs) are believed to represent the initial conditions for massive star and cluster formation. We investigate the IRDC G035.39-00.33 using SiO, H13CO+, CH3OH, and CS emission observed with ALMA at 3.5\arcsec\ resolution (0.05 pc). The SiO emission traces shock activity within the cloud, providing insights into current star formation and cloud formation mechanisms. We identify several regions with broad SiO emission clearly associated with outflows, pinpointing the locations of ongoing star formation across the cloud. The ALMA images also reveal a series of spatially extended SiO emission spots with narrow line profiles, aligned along an arc-like path that is also seen in CS and CH3OH emission. While the broad SiO emission is mainly associated with the main cloud filament, as seen in visual extinction, the narrow SiO arch is located at the edge of the cloud, far from the identified sites of star formation activity. The presence of these arc-like morphologies suggests that large-scale shocks may have compressed the gas in the surroundings of the G035.39-00.33 cloud, shaping its filamentary structure. By inspecting the large-scale radio continuum emission around G035.39-00.33, we find that this IRDC is part of a larger star-forming complex where the densest and coolest material appears at the interacting regions between a Supernova Remnant (SNR) and an expanding HII region. In particular, we hypothesize that this IRDC may be spatially coincident with the ionized expanding gas associated with the previously identified SNR G35.6-0.4. We suggest that collisions between giant molecular clouds and expanding gas flows from interacting SNRs and HII regions may be responsible for the observed arc-like structures. Such shock compressions could play an important role in the formation of IRDCs and in the potential triggering of star formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio transients whose phys- ical origin remains uncertain. Magnetar-based models, motivated by observed properties such as polarization and large rotation measures, suggest that FRB emission may be modulated by the magnetar spin period. We present an efficient method to search for periodic signals in repeating FRBs by combining phase folding and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) parameter estimation. Our method accelerates period searches. We test the method using observational data from repeater FRB 20201124A, and show that it can recover reported candidate periods.
#### Unveiling SN 2022eyw: A Bright Member of the Type Iax Supernova Subclass

 - **Abstract**
 We present comprehensive photometric and spectroscopic observations of Supernova (SN) 2022eyw, a luminous member of the Type Iax SN subclass. SN 2022eyw reached a peak absolute magnitude of $M_g = -17.80\pm0.15$ mag and exhibited a rise time of $\sim$15 days, placing it among the brighter Iax events. The bolometric light curve indicates a synthesized $^{56}$Ni mass of $0.120\pm0.003~\text{M}_{\odot}$, with an estimated ejecta mass of $0.79\pm0.09~\text{M}_{\odot}$ and kinetic energy of $0.19\times10^{51}$ erg. The spectral evolution from -8 to +110 days past maximum reveals features characteristic of bright Type Iax Supernovae, including a transition from Fe III to Fe II dominance, moderate expansion velocities, and a lack of strong C III absorption. TARDIS spectral modelling of the early-phase spectra indicates a well-mixed ejecta dominated by Fe-group elements. In addition, traces of unburnt carbon are detected, pointing to incomplete burning as expected in pure deflagration models. Late-time spectral evolution shows a blend of permitted and forbidden lines. Comparison with deflagration models suggests that SN 2022eyw originated from a partial deflagration of a Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf, with explosion properties intermediate between the N3-def and N5-def models. These observations support pure deflagration of a CO white dwarf as a viable explosion mechanism for its luminous members.

 - **Abstract**
 Using Gaia DR3 data, binary star catalogs have been created containing information on a total of more than 2.6 million pairs. This increases by more than an order of magnitude the ensemble of binary stars with known characteristics, which previously numbered about 140 thousand pairs. To perform statistical analysis of the complete ensemble of binary stars, including both previously known and newly discovered pairs, cross-identification by coordinates was carried out between the most complete pre-Gaia publication compilative binary star catalog ILB and data from binary star catalogs based on Gaia DR3 results. An analysis of the results of this identification was performed, showing the dependence of its characteristics both on the data from the source catalogs and on coordinates. It is shown that in dense stellar fields, particularly in the Galactic disk, an increase in the fraction of false positive identifications can be expected. At the same time, for systems with large proper motion, there is a high probability of a false negative outcome. Possible modifications to the identification method are proposed to reduce the role of the described systematic errors and increase the reliability of its results.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Processing radio interferometric data often requires storing forward-predicted model data. In direction-dependent calibration, these data may have a volume an order of magnitude larger than the original data. Existing lossy compression techniques work well for observed, noisy data, but cause issues in calibration when applied to forward-predicted model data. Aims. To reduce the volume of forward-predicted model data, we present a lossless compression method called Simulated Signal Compression (Sisco) for noiseless data that integrates seamlessly with existing workflows. We show that Sisco can be combined with baseline-dependent averaging for further size reduction. Methods. Sisco decomposes complex floating-point visibility values and uses polynomial extrapolation in time and frequency to predict values, groups bytes for efficient encoding, and compresses residuals using the Deflate algorithm. We evaluate Sisco on diverse LOFAR, MeerKAT, and MWA datasets with various extrapolation functions. Implemented as an open-source Casacore storage manager, it can directly be used by any observatory that makes use of this format. Results. We find that a combination of linear and quadratic prediction yields optimal compression, reducing noiseless forward-predicted model data to 24% of its original volume on average. Compression varies by dataset, ranging from 13% for smooth data to 38% for less predictable data. For pure noise data, compression achieves just a size of 84% due to the unpredictability of such data. With the current implementation, the achieved compression throughput is with 534 MB/s mostly dominated by I/O on our testing platform, but occupies the processor during compression or decompression. Finally, we discuss the extension to a lossy algorithm.

 - **Abstract**
 Over the past two decades, the \textit{Swift} and \textit{Fermi} missions have identified a rare class of ``double-trigger'' gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) that produce two independent trigger events. These events are characterized by a sufficiently long quiescent period during which the on-board trigger system can reset, resulting in the subsequent emission being recorded as a second independent event. Consistent sky localization confirms that both trigger events originated from the same astrophysical source. Here, we present a systematic classification and characteristics study of three such cases: GRB 091024A, GRB 110709B, and GRB 220627A. We investigate each trigger episode emission independently using standard classification diagnostics, including duration ($T_{90}$), hardness ratio, minimum variability timescale (MVT), spectral lag ($\tau_{\rm lag}$), peak energy ($E_{\rm p}$), and energetics. We compare these properties with those of typical long GRBs (LGRBs) and with single-trigger LGRBs that exhibit extended quiescent periods. Our analysis reveals that all sub-bursts from the three double-trigger events consistently lie within the LGRB classification region. These results indicate that double-trigger GRBs are not a physically distinct subclass, but rather products of LGRB central engines that undergo extended dormancy and subsequent reactivation.
