#### The power of polarimetry for characterising exoplanet atmospheres, clouds, and surfaces with NASA's Habitable Worlds Observatory

 - **Abstract**
 The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), planned for launch in the 2040s, represents the next major step in exoplanet characterisation. HWO will, for the first time, enable detailed studies of the atmospheres and surfaces of Earth-like exoplanets through high-contrast reflection spectroscopy across the UV, optical, and near-infrared. These wavelength ranges provide access to key molecular absorption features, including O2, O3, H2O, CO2, and CH4, as well as potential surface biosignatures such as the vegetation red edge or ocean glint, making HWO a cornerstone mission for assessing planetary habitability. Clouds are a dominant factor in determining planetary climate and observability, yet their properties remain highly degenerate when constrained using reflected flux alone. Spectropolarimetry, a measure of the polarisation state of reflected light as a function of wavelength and orbital phase, provides a powerful complementary diagnostic. Polarisation is highly sensitive to cloud particle size, composition, shape, vertical distribution, and surface type, enabling degeneracies between atmospheric and surface models to be broken. Numerous studies have demonstrated the value of polarimetry for characterising a wide range of exoplanets, from hot Jupiters to cooler potentially habitable worlds. HWO's proposed instrument suite includes a coronagraph, a high-resolution imager, and a candidate high-resolution spectropolarimeter, offering multiple pathways to exploit polarimetry across diverse planetary regimes. This white paper argues that incorporating polarimetric capability into HWO instruments would significantly enhance the mission's scientific return. We highlight the unique opportunity for UK leadership in both instrument development and theoretical modelling, and advocate for a strong UK role in shaping HWO's polarimetric capabilities to maximise its impact on exoplanet science.

 - **Abstract**
 The central engines of Little Red Dots (LRDs) may be ``black hole stars" (BH*s), early stages of black hole growth characterized by dense gas envelopes. So far, the most direct evidence for BH*s comes from a handful of sources where the host galaxy is completely outshone as suggested by their remarkably steep Balmer breaks. Here we present a novel scheme to disentangle BH*s from their host galaxies assuming that the [OIII]5008Å line arises exclusively from the host. Using a sample of 98 LRDs ($z$~$2-9$) with high quality NIRSpec/PRISM spectra, we demonstrate that the host-subtracted median stack displays a Balmer break $>2\times$ stronger than massive quiescent galaxies, with the rest-optical continuum resembling a blackbody-like SED ($T_{\rm{eff}}$~$4050$ K, $\log(L_{\rm{bol}})$~$43.9$ erg s$^{-1}$, $R_{\rm{eff}}$~$1300$ au). We measure a steep Balmer decrement (H$\alpha$/H$\beta>10$) and numerous density-sensitive features (e.g., FeII, HeI, OI). These are hallmark signatures of dense gas envelopes, providing population-level evidence that BH*s indeed power LRDs. In the median LRD, BH*s account for $\sim20\%$ of the UV emission, $\sim50\%$ at the Balmer break, and $\sim90\%$ at wavelengths longer than H$\alpha$ with the remainder arising from the host. BH*s preferentially reside in low-mass galaxies ($M_{\rm{\star}}$~$10^{8}\,{\rm M}_{\rm{\odot}}$) undergoing recent starbursts, as evidenced by extreme emission line EWs (e.g., [OIII]5008Å~$1100$Å, CIII]~$12$Å), thereby favoring BH* origins linked to star-formation. We show V-shaped LRD selections are biased to high BH*/host fractions ($\gtrsim60\%$ at 5500Å) -- less dominant BH*s may be powering JWST's blue broad-line AGN. We find BH*s are so commonplace and transient (duty cycle $\sim1\%$, lifetime $\sim10$ Myrs) that every massive black hole may have once shone as a BH*.
#### It's More Complicated Than You Think: A Forward Model to Infer the Recent Star Formation History, Bursty or Not, of Galaxy Populations

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of the early Universe (z > 4) with the James Webb Space Telescope reveal galaxy populations with a wide range of intrinsic luminosities and colors. Bursty star formation histories (SFHs), characterized by short-term fluctuations in the star formation rate (SFR), may explain this diversity, but constraining burst timescales and amplitudes in individual galaxies is challenging due to degeneracies and sensitivity limits. We introduce a population-level simulation-based inference framework that recovers the power and timescales of SFR fluctuations by forward-modeling galaxy populations and distributions of rest-UV to rest-optical spectral features sensitive to star formation timescales. We adopt a stochastic SFH model based on a power spectral density formalism spanning 1 Myr-10 Gyr. Using simulated samples of N=500 galaxies at z~4 with typical JWST/NIRSpec uncertainties, we demonstrate that: (i) the power of SFR fluctuations can be measured with sufficient precision to distinguish between simulations (e.g., FIRE-2-like vs. Illustris-like populations at >99% confidence for timescales < 100 Myr); (ii) simultaneously modeling stochastic fluctuations and the recent (t_L < 500 Myr) average SFH slope is essential, as secular trends otherwise mimic burstiness in common diagnostics; (iii) frequent, intense bursts impose an outshining limit, and bias inference toward underestimating burstiness due to the obscuration of long-timescale power; and (iv) the power of SFR fluctuations can be inferred to 95% confidence across all timescales in both smooth and bursty populations. This framework establishes a novel and robust method for placing quantitative constraints on the feedback physics regulating star formation using large, uniformly selected spectroscopic samples.
#### How supermassive black holes shape central entropies in galaxy clusters

 - **Abstract**
 A significant fraction of galaxy clusters show central cooling times of less than 1 Gyr and associated central cluster entropies below $30\,\mathrm{keV}\,\mathrm{cm}^2$. We provide a straight forward explanation for these low central entropies in cool core systems and how this is related to accretion onto supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Assuming a time-averaged equilibrium between active galactic nucleus (AGN) jet heating of the radiatively cooling intracluster medium (ICM) as well as Bondi accretion, we derive an equilibrium entropy that scales with the SMBH and cluster mass as $K\propto M_\bullet^{4/3}M_{500\mathrm{c}}^{-1}$. At fixed cluster mass, overly massive SMBHs would raise the central entropy above the cool core threshold, thus implying a novel way of limiting SMBH masses in cool core clusters. We find a limiting mass of $1.4\times10^{10}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ in a cool core cluster of mass $10^{15}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$. We carry out three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of an idealized Perseus-like cluster with AGN jets and find that they reproduce the predictions of our analytic model, once corrections for elevated jet entropies are applied in calculating X-ray emissivity-weighted cluster entropies. Our findings have significant implications for modelling galaxy clusters in cosmological simulations: a combination of overmassive SMBHs and high heating efficiencies preclude the formation of cool core clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal disruption events (TDEs) have been proposed as candidate sources of high-energy neutrinos. Successful and choked jets, as well as the accretion disk, corona, wind, and outflow regions in a TDE have been examined and shown to produce TeV - PeV neutrinos. In this work, we use the IceCube 12.5 year high energy starting events (HESE) dataset and perform a maximum likelihood analysis to investigate the spatial and temporal correlations between HESE dataset and a selected sample of 89 TDEs. Our results indicate that the currently observed data do not show any significant correlation and hence is consistent with the background only hypothesis. Using this result, we place constraints on the fraction of TDEs harboring intrinsic jets ($f_{\rm jet}$) and the corresponding isotropic-equivalent cosmic ray (CR) energy ($\mathcal{E}_{\rm CR}$). We note that even with limited statistics, we can constrain the parameter space as $\mathcal{E}_{\rm CR} \lesssim 3 \times 10^{53}$ erg for $f_{\rm jet} \gtrsim 0.6$ at more than 90% C.L. Finally, we discuss the theoretical implications of our results and the limits on the all-sky diffuse neutrino flux from TDEs. With more observational data in the electromagnetic band for TDEs and neutrino observations from IceCube and KM3NeT, our analysis can be used to place stringent constraints on physical parameters associated with TDEs.
#### Radiation hydrodynamic simulation of the Haro 11 galaxy: the escape of LyC and Ly$α$ in a dwarf galaxy merger

 - **Abstract**
 The Haro 11 galaxy merger is the closest known Lyman Continuum (LyC) leaker and a strong Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) emitter, making it an important analogue of the high-$z$ galaxies that reionised the early Universe. To investigate how Haro 11's properties arise, we perform a radiation hydrodynamics simulation of the merger, and create mock observations of LyC, Ly$\alpha$, and H$\alpha$, from which we compute their luminosities ($L$) and escape fractions ($f_{\rm esc}$). We track these quantities along multiple sightlines as the two progenitor galaxies merge, from the first interaction until the system resembles present-day Haro 11. We find that $L$ and $f_{\rm esc}$ vary by 1-2 orders of magnitude for LyC due to sightline variations. At the two pericentre passages, the total $f_{\rm esc}^{\rm LyC}$ increases by roughly an order of magnitude. Conversely, $f_{\rm esc}^{\rm Ly\alpha}$ shows a moderate increase at the pericentre passages, which affects the inference of LyC properties from Ly$\alpha$. We attribute this to a displacement of the LyC-emitting stars relative to the \Lya-emitting gas, combined with an increased density from gas compression. Furthermore, $f_{\rm esc}^{\rm LyC}$ is boosted during star formation bursts, likely due to stellar feedback. As direct comparison with Haro 11, the simulation qualitatively matches its morphology and luminosities. We find that among the dense stellar knots, knot C is the main contributor to both intrinsic and escaping LyC emission. Additionally, the Ly$\alpha$ spectra displays distinct features found in observations, implying similar gas conditions are present.

 - **Abstract**
 The Euclid Early Release Observations (ERO) programme targeted the Perseus galaxy cluster in its central region over 0.7deg$^2$. We combined the exceptional image quality and depth of the ERO-Perseus with FUV and NUV observations from GALEX and AstroSat/UVIT, as well as $ugrizH\alpha$ data from MegaCam at the CFHT, to deliver FUV-to-NIR magnitudes of the 87 brightest galaxies within the Perseus cluster. We reconstructed the star-formation history (SFH) of 59 early-type galaxies (ETGs) within the sample, through the spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting code CIGALE and state-of-the-art stellar population (SP) models to reproduce the galactic UV emission from hot, old, low-mass stars (i.e. the UV upturn). In addition, for the six most massive ETGs in Perseus [stellar masses $\log_{10}(M_{\ast}/M_{\odot}) \geq 10.3$], we analysed their spatially resolved SP through a radial SED fitting. In agreement with our previous work on Virgo ETGs, we found that (i) the majority of ETGs needs the presence of an UV upturn to explain their FUV emission, with temperatures $\langle T_{\rm UV}\rangle$~33800 K; (ii) ETGs have grown their stellar masses quickly, with SF timescales $\tau\lesssim 1500$ Myr. We found that all ETGs in the sample have formed more than about 30% of their stellar masses at z~5, up to ~100%. At z~5, the stellar masses of the most massive nearby ETGs, which have present-day stellar masses $\log_{10}(M_{\ast}/M_{\odot})\gtrsim 10.8$, are then found to be comparable to those of the red quiescent galaxies observed by JWST at similar redshifts (z>4.6). This study can be extended to ETGs in the 14000 deg$^2$ extragalactic sky that will soon be observed by Euclid, in combination with those from other major upcoming surveys (e.g. Rubin/LSST), and UV observations, to ultimately assess whether the nearby massive ETGs represent the progeny of the massive high-z JWST red quiescent galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 Binary neutron star mergers are expected to generate intense magnetic fields that power relativistic and non-relativistic outflows and shape their multimessenger signatures. These fields likely arise from the turbulent amplification of initially weak magnetic fields during the merger, particularly via the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability at the collisional interface between the stars. While previous studies have shown efficient amplification to magnetar-level strengths, the degree of large-scale coherence of the resulting field remains uncertain. We present general-relativistic, dynamical spacetime, magnetohydrodynamic simulations following the evolution of initially weak, pulsar-like magnetic fields in a binary neutron star merger. We find rapid magnetic field growth at small scales with clear signatures of small-scale turbulent dynamo action. At the highest resolutions, we additionally observe the emergence of coherent magnetic structures on larger scales. Our results imply that strong, ordered magnetic fields may be present immediately after merger, with important implications for the subsequent evolution of the remnant and its observable electromagnetic and gravitational-wave signals.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of 22,656 narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLSy1s) from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR17 ($0.1\leq z\leq 0.9$), identifying a sample of spectroscopically anomalous sources. These anomalies were detected via the spectroscopic quasar anomaly detection (SQuAD) algorithm, which employed principal component analysis and hierarchical k-means clustering. Various physical diagnostic analysis were performed such as the color excess ($E_{(B-V)}$) calculations, Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) color analysis, probing O III, equivalent width as an inclination indicator, the BPT diagram and eigenvector 1 diagram. We detected 620 anomalous NLSy1s classified into two groups i.e. 246, Red NLSy1s, exhibiting host galaxy dominated spectra with a low luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGN) core revealed by the emission line widths. Another set of 374 Blue NLSy1s, strongly luminous galaxies with enhanced AGN activity, bluer continuum as compared to a typical NLSy1 and stronger Fe II emission. Finally, the third group of 257 outliers, identified as Intermediate Seyferts, a class of Seyfert galaxies identified by composite emission profiles, and extremely strong emission lines paired with virtually no continuum. These sources also exhibit rare and high ionization emission lines unseen in any other NLSy1 spectra (e.g. [Ne V]$\lambda3345$, Ne V $\lambda3426$, Ne III $\lambda3869$ etc). We conclude that the differentiating factor between red and blue NLSy1s is not dust obscuration or orientation effect, but intrinsic distinction in AGN activity. The resulting sample is presented as a value-added catalog.

 - **Abstract**
 Here we present the results of our search through the Early Data Release (EDR) of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) for extreme coronal line emitters (ECLEs) - a rare classification of galaxies displaying strong, high-ionization iron coronal emission lines within their spectra. With the requirement of a strong X-ray continuum to generate the coronal emission, ECLEs have been linked to both active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and tidal disruption events (TDEs). We focus our search on identifying TDE-linked ECLEs. We identify three such objects within the EDR sample, highlighting DESI's effectiveness for discovering new nuclear transients, and determine a galaxy-normalized TDE-linked ECLE rate of $R_\mathrm{G}=5~^{+5}_{-3}\times10^{-6}~\mathrm{galaxy}^{-1}~\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ at a median redshift of z = 0.2 - broadly consistent with previous works. Additionally, we also identify more than 200 AGNs displaying coronal emission lines, which serve as the primary astrophysical contaminants in searches for TDE-related events. We also include an outline of the custom python code developed for this search.

 - **Abstract**
 We examine the possibility that evidence for a non-zero value of the CP violating $ \frac{e^2 }{32\pi^2}\theta_{EM} \int d^4 x {\vec E}\cdot {\vec B}$ coupling might be extracted from Event Horizon Telescope observations of the black holes SgA* and M87*. The Fischler-Kundu\cite{FK} effect predicts a universal Hall current in the relaxation of charge falling onto the black hole horizon. We argue that this leads to a non-zero value of a certain CP-violating observable ${\cal C}$, defined below. The effect can be masked by parity violating plasma currents. In particular, evidence for polarization flips \cite{flip} in the signals from M87* indicate strong plasma effects in the data. We suggest that time averaging the data over periods including the flip might leave over a residual that would be an indicator of the FK signal. In addition, similarities in the polarization patterns between the two very different black holes, and a part of the signal that is uniform in frequency, might enable us to distinguish the universal topological signal from source and frequency dependent plasma effects. Current data does not appear to be sufficient to perform such a test.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the hypothesis that the evolution of the Universe can be described by a single dark fluid whose effective equation of state (EoS), $\omega_{\rm{eff}}$, is a linear combination of a logarithmic term and a power law term, both involving the Lambert $W$ function. This particular form of EoS was first proposed by S. Saha and K. Bamba in 2019 and has two parameters, $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$, which must be determined from observations. To this end, we place limits on these parameters by combining recent baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data -- including measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) -- with Type Ia supernova observations from the Pantheon+ compilation, along with direct determinations of the Hubble parameter. From this combined analysis, we obtain a best-fit value for the Hubble parameter, $H_0 = 67.4 \pm 1.2~\text{km\,s}^{-1}\text{Mpc}^{-1}$, while current measurements of the sound horizon at the baryon drag epoch yield $r_d = 146\pm 2.5$~Mpc. Furthermore, we study the evolution of the deceleration parameter, the effective EoS, and the jerk parameter, and support our findings using the $Om(z)$ diagnostic. The model exhibits noticeable deviations from the predictions of the concordance $\Lambda$CDM model. Despite these differences, our results indicate that the model provides a coherent description of late-time cosmic evolution and the observed accelerated expansion of the Universe. Finally, we assess the observational viability of the model using information criteria, particularly the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and compare these results with those obtained for the $\Lambda$CDM model, which serves as our reference.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the results of a pilot study that searched for dual active galactic nuclei (AGN) in local ($z<$0.25) galaxies hosting double-peaked narrow emission lines in their optical spectra. We present high-resolution $L-$band (1.5 GHz or 18 cm) continuum images from the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) as well as WFC3/IR F160W images from the \textit{Hubble Space Telescope} of two candidate dual AGN systems: J0948+6848 and J1223+5409. In both targets, we detected compact non-thermal radio emission that is approximately co-spatial with the near-infrared AGN. Both systems host two high brightness temperature ($>10^{8}$ K) radio sources that indicate the presence of either a parsec-scale-separation dual AGN ($d_{\text{sep}} \sim 90$ pc and $\sim 56$ pc, respectively) or a radio jet. Matched-resolution multi-band radio observations are necessary to further characterize the AGN activity in these systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Blue lurkers (BLs) are rejuvenated main-sequence stars hidden among normal main-sequence stars on color-magnitude diagrams of star clusters. In comparison, the blue straggler stars, formed via similar mass transfers or mergers, occupy a distinct space in the color-magnitude diagrams. We compile a list of BL candidates in open clusters using available rotation catalogs. BLs can be identified using either unusually faster rotation compared to similar mass stars, which is a signature of recent accretion, or the presence of a companion, which can only be formed by mass donation, e.g., an extremely low mass white dwarf. Here, we searched for fast-rotating stars on the main sequence of open clusters using Kepler, TESS, and spectroscopic rotation indicators, such as rotation periods and $v\sin i$ measurements. We identified 97 new BL candidates across 35 open clusters, almost tripling the previously known sample of 36. Based on the estimated completeness of $\approx$3\%, thousands of BLs are likely hidden within the cluster population. Detailed spectroscopic and time-series analyses will be essential to confirm their mass-transfer histories.

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of the radio emission in active galactic nuclei (AGN) is still debated. Multiple physical mechanisms can contribute to the spectrum at these frequencies, including relativistic jets, the jet base, outflows, star formation, and synchrotron emission from the hot corona. Recently, new extreme radio variability has been observed in the class of low-mass/high-Eddington AGN known as narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies, suggesting that another, more exotic mechanism may also play a role, especially at frequencies above 10 GHz. To investigate this relatively unexplored area of the radio spectrum, we observed a sample of 50 NLS1s with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA), and 20 of them were observed twice. In this sample, 24 sources were not detected, while the others are typically characterized by a steep spectrum that can be modeled with a power law. We also identified two new candidate jetted NLS1s, including a high-frequency peaker, which is an extremely young relativistic jet. We found no significant variability in the sources observed twice. We conclude that the radio spectrum of NLS1s is typically dominated by optically thin emission, likely from low-power outflows, or by circumnuclear star formation, with a limited contribution from relativistic jets. Further studies at different spatial scales and at other wavelengths are necessary to fully constrain the origin of the radio emission in this class of active galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 Characterizing protostellar outflows is fundamental to understanding star formation feedback, yet traditional methods are often hindered by projection effects and complex morphologies. We present a multi-modal deep learning framework that jointly leverages spatial and spectral information from CO observations to infer outflow mass, inclination, and position angle ($PA$). Our model, trained on synthetic ALMA observations generated from 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations, utilizes a cross-attention fusion mechanism to integrate morphological and kinematic features with probabilistic uncertainty estimation. Our results demonstrate that Vision Transformer architectures significantly outperform convolutional networks, showing remarkable robustness to reduced spatial resolution. Interpretability analysis reveals a physically consistent hierarchy: spatial features dominate across all parameters, whereas spectral profiles provide secondary constraints for mass and inclination. Applied to observational ALMA data, the framework delivers stable mass and $PA$ estimates with exceptionally tightly constrained inclination angles. This study establishes multi-modal deep learning as a powerful, interpretable tool for overcoming projection biases in high-mass star formation studies.

 - **Abstract**
 Comet C/2023 P1 (Nishimura) was observed by the Solar Orbiter Heliospheric Imager (SoloHI), onboard the Solar Orbiter spacecraft, from 2023 September 1 to 14. During this period, the ion tail of the comet exhibited continual fluctuations and four tail disconnection events (TDEs), each coinciding with the passage of a coronal mass ejection (CME). In this work, we report on the ion tail dynamics of the best observed TDE, which occurred on September 11. The SoloHI white-light images reveal an abrupt bending, subsequent kinks, and severing of a downstream portion of the pre-existing ion tail. The onset of disconnection occurred $\sim$6.5 hours after the projected passage of the CME leading edge in the images, consistent with a CME flank encounter. After the disconnection, the ion tail reformed within $\sim$24 hours, with a regrowth rate of $\sim$86$\pm7~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, indicating the rate at which newly ionized material forms along the magnetic field draped around the comet's coma. After the TDE, the detached tail drifted anti-sunward at an estimated speed of $\sim$295$\pm20~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, comparable to the local CME flank's speed, suggesting that the severed plasma was most likely carried away from the comet by the CME. This study provides the first direct, quantitative characterization of comet-CME interactions and the subsequent regrowth phase of a cometary TDE. These measurements were achievable by SoloHI's unique inner-heliospheric coverage, thanks to a combination of high photometric sensitivity, short exposure times, and a wide field of view that preserves the fine-scale tail dynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 Empirical solar wind speed models play an important role in enabling space weather forecasting with low computational cost. Among these, one model called WS model is based on the asymptotic expansion factor. However, it is known that it fails in the case of pseudostreamers. In this study, as a first step toward constructing a solar wind speed empirical model based on physical parameters, we investigated the effect of the radial profile of flux-tube shape on the solar wind speed using one-dimensional numerical simulations. In the simulations, ad hoc Alfvén waves are injected from the photosphere at $r=R_\odot$ as the energy source, and the MHD equations are solved out to the interplanetary space at $r=70R_\odot$ to reproduce solar wind acceleration. As a result, even when the coronal base magnetic field and the asymptotic expansion factor are fixed, the final solar wind speed varies by approximately 300 km s$^{-1}$ depending on changes in the expansion height or non-monotonic expansion. Additionally, across all simulations performed, a better correlation is found with the quantities that reflect the information about the radial profile of flux-tube shape than the asymptotic expansion factor. Our results suggest that, as a physical characteristic parameter of the solar wind speed, an operation that can account for the expansion factor throughout the corona is necessary.
#### A redshift survey of the nearby galaxy cluster Abell 2199 : No upturn of the faint-end slope of galaxy luminosity function

 - **Abstract**
 We determine the galaxy luminosity function of cluster galaxies in the nearby galaxy cluster Abell 2199 (A2199), focusing on the faint-end slope down to $M_r \sim -14.5$. To achieve this, we augment the existing dataset by adding redshift data from our deep MMT/Hectospec survey and from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), significantly improving the spectroscopic completeness down to $r_{\mathrm{petro},0} = 20.8$ within the central $30^\prime$ region. The resulting luminosity function is well described by a Schechter function with a characteristic magnitude $M^* = -21.30 \pm 0.27$ and a faint-end slope $\alpha = -1.23 \pm 0.05$. This faint-end slope is consistent with those measured in the nearby Coma and Virgo clusters and in a cluster from the TNG50 cosmological simulation, and is slightly shallower than that of field galaxies. These findings indicate that the previously claimed steep faint-end upturn (with $\alpha \sim -2$) in nearby galaxy clusters is not supported. Instead, they indicate that environmental processes in dense cluster cores does not seem to trigger the formation or survival of low-mass galaxies, thereby preventing a steep faint-end upturn in the luminosity function.
#### Cross-correlating galaxies and cosmic dispersion measures: Constraints on the gas-to-halo mass relation from 2MASS galaxies and 133 localized fast radio bursts

 - **Abstract**
 We conduct a cross-correlation analysis between large-scale structures traced by the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) galaxy catalog and the cosmic dispersion measures of 133 localized fast radio bursts (FRBs). The cross-correlation signal is measured as a function of the comoving separation $R$ between 2MASS galaxies and background FRB sightlines, making full use of the available redshift information for both datasets. Our measurements are consistent with a null detection over the range $0.01 < R\, [h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}] < 1$. Using a halo-based model in which free-electron density profiles are drawn from the hydrodynamical simulation IllustrisTNG-300 (TNG300), we show that the null signal at $R \sim 0.01\, h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$ is inconsistent with the TNG300 prediction. This discrepancy indicates that the hot-gas mass fraction in halos with masses of $10^{12-13}\, M_\odot$ hosting 2MASS galaxies must be lower than that predicted by TNG300. A simple phenomenological modification of the TNG300 model suggests that the hot-gas mass fraction in halos of $10^{12-13}\, M_\odot$ should be below $\sim 10\%$ of the global baryon fraction in the nearby universe, implying the need for stronger feedback in this mass range. Our constraints are consistent with those inferred from X-ray emission and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich measurements in galaxies, while providing a direct estimate of the hot-gas mass fraction that does not rely on electron-temperature measurements. These results demonstrate that galaxy-FRB cross correlations offer a powerful probe of feedback processes in galaxy formation.

 - **Abstract**
 This work investigates the origin of the TeV emission detected by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) from NGC 4278, a galaxy hosting a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (LLAGN). Considering two plausible scenarios, AGN jets and winds, we model the X-ray, GeV, and TeV emission during both TeV-low (quasi-quiet) and TeV-high (active) states. The spectral energy distributions can be explained either by single-zone leptonic emission from moderately relativistic jets or by lepto-hadronic emission from sub-relativistic winds. The best-fit parameters suggest that the transition from the quasi-quiet to the active state may be driven jointly by an enhanced accretion rate and the expansion of jets or winds. We further show that future MeV and very-high-energy $\gamma$-ray observations can discriminate between the {leptonic and lepto-hadronic scenarios}. Although the neutrino flux from NGC~1068 predicted by the wind model is too low to be detected with current neutrino observatories, a lepto-hadronic wind scenario can account for the PeV diffuse neutrino background when adopting a local LLAGN density corrected for the TeV duty cycle, $n_{\rm L,0}(\Delta T_{\rm TeV}/T) \sim 10^{-5}~\rm Mpc^{-3}$, as inferred from the LHAASO detection.

 - **Abstract**
 This work conducts a three-dimensional (3D), nonlinear magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation to investigate wave generating, time-dependent reconnection around a magnetic null point. A non-periodic perturbation (in the $xz$-plane) triggers oscillatory reconnection (OR) at the 3D null, resulting in a self-sustained oscillation with a constant period $P$. We investigate the response of the system using three distinct wave proxies (compressible parallel, compressible transverse and incompressible parallel) as well as Spectral Proper Orthogonal Decomposition for decoupling and analyzing the resultant MHD wave behavior. We find that OR generates a slow magnetoacoustic wave of period $P$ that propagates outwards in all directions along the spine and fan plane of the 3D null point. We also find the generation of a propagating Alfvén wave of period $P$, exclusively along the $y$-axis in the fan plane, i.e. in the direction perpendicular to the spine motion. These findings provide new insights into waves generated from a 3D null point and their implications for coronal seismology.

 - **Abstract**
 Twenty co-orbital asteroids of Venus are currently known, several of which may evolve into potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs) over timescales of thousands of years. We report the identification and first dynamical characterization of 2025 TV$_{10}$, a newly discovered Venus co-orbital asteroid, and assess its potential collisional hazard to Earth. We performed numerical simulations of a large number of asteroid clones, and we studied their close encounters with Venus and Earth. The asteroid may leave its co-orbital orbit on timescales of 1200 yr. The orbit of 2025 TV$_{10}$ is one of the closest of the absolute minimum of the "minimum orbital intersection distance" (MOID) with Earth for the Venus co-orbital asteroids known to date. Owing to its orbital parameters, 2025 TV$_{10}$ represents one of the most dynamically hazardous members of the Venus co-orbital population identified to date. Its faint magnitude and restricted observability windows make future observations challenging but essential for constraining its orbit.

 - **Abstract**
 The Spectro-Photometer for the History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization and Ices Explorer (SPHEREx) will provide all-sky spectral survey data covering optical to mid-infrared wavelengths with a spatial resolution of 6\farcs2, which can be widely used to study galaxy formation and evolution. We investigate the galaxy-galaxy blending in SPHEREx datasets using the mock galaxy catalogs generated from cosmological simulations and observational data. Only $\sim0.7\%$ of the galaxies will be blended with other galaxies in all-sky survey data with a limiting magnitude of 19 AB mag. However, the fraction of blended galaxies dramatically increases to $\sim7$--$9\%$ in the deep survey area around the ecliptic poles, where the depth reaches $\sim22$ AB mag. We examine the impact of the blending in the number count and luminosity function analyses using the SPHEREx data. We find that the number count can be overestimated by up to $10$--$20\%$ in the deep regions due to the flux boosting, suggesting that the impact of galaxy-galaxy blending on the number count is moderate. However, galaxy-galaxy blending can marginally change the luminosity function by up to 50\%\ over a wide range of redshifts. As we only employ the magnitude limit at $K_s$-band for the source detection, the blending fractions determined in this study should be regarded as lower limits.

 - **Abstract**
 Eta-Virginids is a less-known meteor shower active in March. We investigated the meteoroids of this shower using fireball data from the European Fireball Network supplemented by video data of faint meteors. We first derived the criteria for assigning meteors to this shower. A fragmentation model was then applied to selected shower fireballs with good deceleration data and light curves. Meteoroid fragmentation strengths and bulk densities were derived and compared with three other showers. We have confirmed the four year periodicity in the activity of eta-Virginids and their presence in the 3:1 mean motion resonance with Jupiter. The orbital period of four years was directly measured for the fireballs. Fainter meteors showed somewhat longer periods but the shower is poor in faint meteors. No member fainter than magnitude +1 was observed instrumentally. The physical properties of meteoroids are different from cometary streams and are similar to the Geminids. The limiting fragmentation strength of 0.5 MPa and typical bulk density of cm-sized meteoroids of 1500 kg/m3 suggest that the parent body is a carbonaceous asteroid. Besides Geminids, eta-Virginids is another stream of asteroidal origin. Some small meteoroids have densities around 2500 kg/m3. Three asteroids of the sizes between 40 - 120 meters have been found to have similar orbits but their relation to eta-Virginids remains uncertain.
#### Little Red Dots and Supermassive Black Hole Seed Formation in Ultralight Dark Matter Halos

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate how supermassive black hole (SMBH) seeds form in the early Universe at the centers of ultralight dark matter (ULDM) halos. Focusing on the ULDM Jeans scale, we identify the critical conditions under which high-redshift baryonic gas, strongly confined by central solitonic cores of the halos, undergoes direct and monolithic collapse. The solitonic potential naturally drives rapid inflow and shock heating, allowing the gas to exceed the critical atomic-cooling and fragmentation-suppression threshold of $\sim 3 \times 10^4 {\rm K}$ without invoking an external UV background. We derive semi-analytic relations for the halo mass, soliton mass, baryonic core radius, and thermodynamic state of the gas, including the effects of baryonic contraction. These relations simultaneously determine the minimum and maximum SMBH seed masses as functions of redshift. In this framework, pristine gas clouds that satisfy the temperature threshold collapse without fragmentation, forming SMBH seeds with characteristic masses of order $\sim 10^5M_\odot$, while systems below the threshold are expected to form compact star clusters instead. Our model also implies an upper limit on the attainable SMBH mass, predicting a maximum mass scale of order $\sim10^{10}M_\odot$, consistent with the most massive quasars observed to date. The ULDM particle mass required to reproduce the inferred seed mass scale, $m \simeq 10^{-22}{\rm eV}$, coincides with the value favored by galactic-scale observations, providing a unified explanation for the characteristic masses of both galactic cores and early SMBH seeds. Our model predicts efficient SMBH seed formation at redshifts $z \gtrsim 10$ and offers a natural interpretation of recently observed little red dots as SMBHs embedded in compact, hot, ionized gas clouds.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper we introduce PERTURB-c, a correlation-aware framework for interpreting black box regression models with one-dimensional structured inputs. We demonstrate this framework on a simulated case study with machine learning based transit spectroscopy retrievals of exoplanet WASP-107b. Characterising many exoplanet atmospheres can answer important questions about planetary populations, but traditional retrievals are very resource intensive; machine learning based methods offer a fast alternative however (i) they require high volumes data (only obtainable through simulations) to train and (ii) their complexity renders them black-boxes. Better understanding how they reach predictions can allow us to inspect for biases, which is especially important with simulated data, and verify that predictions are made on the basis of physically plausible features. This ultimately improves the ease of adoption of machine learning techniques. The most used methods to explain machine learning model predictions (such as SHAP and other methods that rely on stochastic sample generation) suffer from high computational complexity and struggle to account for interactions between inputs. PERTURB-c addresses these issues by leveraging physical knowledge of the known spectral correlation. For visualisation of this analysis, we propose a heat-map-based representation which is better suited to large numbers of input features along a single dimension, and that is more intuitive to those who are already familiar with retrieval methods. Note that while we chose this exoplanet retrieval context to demonstrate our methodologies, the PERTURB-c framework is model agnostic and in a broader context has potential value across a plethora of adjacent regression problems.
#### Investigating the emission signatures of pulsar halo candidate HESS J1813-126

 - **Abstract**
 Extended gamma-ray sources surrounding middle-aged pulsars, primarily observed at teraelectronvolt energies, have been interpreted as pulsar halos, where relativistic $e^\pm$ diffuse into the interstellar medium and produce inverse-Compton (IC) emission. HESS J1813-126, associated with the energetic, radio-quiet gamma-ray pulsar PSR J1813-1246, has been suggested as a candidate pulsar halo, though its nature remains uncertain. We interpreted the high-energy emission of PSR J1813-1246 using the synchro-curvature (SC) radiation model and tested whether the gamma-ray spectral energy distribution (SED) of HESS J1813-126 can be explained as a pulsar halo powered by PSR J1813-1246. We explain the X-ray and gamma-ray SEDs of the pulsar using the SC framework. We further computed the transport and losses of $e^\pm$ injected by the pulsar through time-dependent diffusion-loss equations, exploring various common pulsar halo transport models. The resulting IC emission was compared with \textit{Fermi}-LAT, H.E.S.S., HAWC, and LHAASO data. We present predictions for the surface brightness profiles (SBPs) and the aperture-dependent emission for the different transport models, providing key diagnostics for assessing the observability of HESS J1813-126 with current and future instruments. The SC framework successfully reproduces the emission of PSR J1813-1246. The SED of HESS J1813-126 can be consistently reproduced within different pulsar halo frameworks, albeit with distinct predictions across different transport models. The corresponding SBP predictions and aperture-dependent emission offer testable signatures for future imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes, which will be crucial for discriminating between the transport models. We further examined the link between the pulsar central engine and its extended halo by comparing the pair multiplicities in the magnetospheric and halo regions.
#### Mixing-induced thermal instabilities and coronal condensations

 - **Abstract**
 Cool, dense material is frequently observed to permeate the hot, tenuous solar corona in the form of prominences, spicules and coronal rain. Both the cool material and surrounding corona exist at temperatures that are effectively thermally stable, in that their local radiative losses occur on relatively long timescales compared to the dynamics. However, as the solar atmosphere evolves, driving mixing between the condensations and surrounding hot material, intermediate temperatures form, which can become subject to highly efficient radiative losses. The thermal energy lost due to radiation can far exceed the turbulent heating thus the system undergoes mixing-induced cooling. Here, a 3D radiative MHD simulation is performed of the shear-driven Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability (KHI) occurring between a cool condensation and the hot solar corona. During the evolution, thermal instabilities form naturally within the mixing layer, and grow with time to produce long, narrow structures that extend perpendicular to the magnetic field. The thermal instabilities form self-consistently within the mixing layer as small isolated events, and are then stretched by the background flows to create long structures in relatively narrow planes. The turbulent flows agitate the condensations and cause them to fragment, creating smaller localised clumps of cool, dense (prominence-like) material that can merge and further fragment. In the presented simulation, the thermal instabilities act to replenish the cool, dense material lost due to mixing, with the total mass of cool material being approximately constant through time. By analysing the thermal energy loss due to optically-thin radiation, thermal instabilities are found to account for 15-20\% of all radiative losses in the turbulent plasma.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a systematic pulse-by-pulse analysis of 22 long-duration GRBs observed by \emph{Swift}, each exhibiting a well-separated precursor before the main burst. We compare duration, spectral hardness ratio, minimum variability timescale (MVT), and spectral lag between these components. Both precursors and main bursts have durations and hardness broadly consistent with Type II GRBs. However, precursors show longer MVTs (by factors of 3-10) and diverse lags with near-zero median values, while main bursts display variable MVTs and positive lags. These differences suggest precursors may originate from distinct dissipation conditions, possibly due to cocoon shock breakout or early magnetically dominated outflows. Despite temporal differences, both episodes are consistent with a single collapsar origin, providing no evidence for dual-progenitor events. Our findings support pulse-resolved classification and show that precursors offer critical insights into jet formation and pre-burst activity.

 - **Abstract**
 We set out to accurately measure gravity in the low-acceleration range $(10^{-11},10^{-9})$ m\,s$^{-2}$ from 3D motions of isolated wide binary stars. Gaia DR3 provides precise measurements of the four sky-plane components of the 3D relative displacement and velocity ($\mathbf{r}, \mathbf{v}$) for a wide binary, but not comparably precise line-of-sight (radial) separation and relative velocity $v_{r}$. Based on our new observations and the public databases/publications, we assemble a sample of 36 nearby (distance $<150$pc) wide binaries in the low-acceleration regime with accurate values of $v_{r}$ (uncertainty $< 100$ m\,s$^{-1}$). Kinematic contaminants such as undetected stellar companions are well under control using various observational diagnostics such as Gaia's ruwe parameter, the color-magnitude diagram, multi-epoch observations of radial velocities, Speckle interferometric follow-up observations, and requiring Hipparcos-Gaia proper motion consistency. For the parameter $\Gamma \equiv \log_{10}\sqrt{\gamma}$ with $\gamma \equiv G/G_{\rm N}$ (where $G$ is a parameter generalizing Newton's constant $G_{\rm N}$ in elliptical orbits), we find $\Gamma=0.102_{-0.021}^{+0.023}$, inconsistent with standard gravity at $4.9\sigma$, giving a gravity boost factor of $\gamma=1.600_{-0.141}^{+0.171}$. Four wide binaries have 3D relative velocities exceeding their estimated Newtonian escape velocities with $1<v_{\rm obs}/v_{\rm escN}\le1.2$. These systems are unlikely to be chance associations and are expected in a nonstandard paradigm such as Milgromian dynamics (MOND). The hypothesis that Newtonian gravity can be extrapolated to the low-acceleration limit is falsified by this independent study with accurate 3D velocities. Future radial velocity monitoring and Speckle interferometric imaging for larger samples will be useful to refine the present result.

 - **Abstract**
 AGN variability offers a direct probe of accretion physics, disk structure, and black hole growth, but progress has been limited by sample size, cadence heterogeneity, and photometric systematics. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will deliver multi-band light curves for millions of AGN, enabling variability studies at a true population scale. We synthesize recent results from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), which demonstrate that optical variability amplitudes and timescales are primarily regulated by accretion state, with secondary dependence on black hole mass and redshift, and establish the feasibility of survey-driven continuum reverberation mapping. ZTF measurements reveal optical continuum-emitting region sizes that often exceed standard thin disk predictions, implicating diffuse continuum emission from the broad line region as a significant contributor to observed inter-band lags. We evaluate the implications of LSST cadence and survey strategy, particularly the deep drilling fields, for continuum and emission line reverberation mapping, changing-look AGN, extreme variability quasars, and periodic variability searches. Key limitations of broadband photometric variability are identified, including variable emission line contamination, diffuse BLR continuum emission, and cadence-dependent lag recoverability. We argue that realizing LSST's full scientific potential requires community-scale, standardized variability metric pipelines, probabilistic classification integrated with alert brokers for follow-up triggering, and complementary medium-band photometric observations to isolate the accretion disk continuum. Together, these elements will enable LSST to convert photometric variability into quantitative constraints on accretion disks, BLR structure, and supermassive black hole growth across cosmic time.

 The massive hot stars play crucial role in the dynamics of galaxies. These stars influence their surroundings through strong winds which are highly structured processes. The theoretical study of the non-symmetric phenomena of the stellar winds are becoming important these days, mainly because 1-D models are not sufficient enough. We present a new version of our Monte Carlo radiative transfer code Andy Antares with improved treatment of the velocity field for arbitrary geometries. Our aim is to develop a numerical scheme that can incorporate a general velocity field defined at discrete points. Our main objective is to calculate radiative transfer in a general input hydrodynamic model. The Andy Antares code currently calculates pure radiative transfer. The input model is pre-calculated by another hydrodynamical code. The whole radiative transfer calculation is then processed in a Cartesian grid. Radiative transfer is solved using the Monte Carlo approach in 3-D regardless of the input hydrodynamical model's dimension. The velocity field at any given point is interpolated using the trilinear interpolation. The optical depth is then integrated numerically along the photon's path. We verified the accuracy of the numerical velocity interpolation by comparison with results obtained for analytical velocity fields, achieving successful outcomes. We also tested the radiative transfer solution on a 3-D model generated from a 2-D hydrodynamic model, and obtained emergent radiation. The code is suitable for the numerical solution of radiative transfer in 3-D with arbitrary velocity fields.

 - **Abstract**
 Particle-in-cell (PIC) numerical simulations are currently among the most advanced tools to investigate particle acceleration at relativistic shocks. Still, they come with limitations imposed by finite computing power, whose impact is not straightforward to evaluate a priori. Observational features are hence required as verification. energy electrons accelerated at external shocks, provides a testbed for such predictions. Current numerical studies suggest that in GRB afterglows the maximum synchrotron photon energy, which corresponds to the limit of electron acceleration, may fall within the $\sim$ 0.1--10 keV X-ray energy band at late times, $t\gtrsim 10^6 - 10^7$ s. To test this prediction, we analyzed the X-ray spectra of six GRBs with \emph{Swift}/XRT detections beyond $10^7$ s: our analysis reveals no clear evidence of a spectral cutoff. Using a model that accounts for the effect of the finite opening angle of the shock on the observed maximum synchrotron photon energy, we show that these observations are incompatible with PIC simulation predictions, unless one or more physical afterglow parameters attain values at odds with those typically inferred from afterglow modeling (small radiative efficiency, low ambient density, large equipartition fraction $\epsilon_{\rm B}$ of the magnetic field). These findings challenge existing numerical simulation results and imply a more efficient acceleration of electrons to high-energies than seen in PIC simulations, with important implications for our understanding of particle acceleration in relativistic shocks.

 - **Abstract**
 One of the major discoveries by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is the identification of a large population of luminous galaxies at $z>10$, challenging theoretical models for early galaxy formation. The unexpectedly high number density of these systems has triggered intense debate about potential differences in the physical properties of galaxies at such extreme redshifts and those at lower redshift. However, progress has been limited by the lack of rest-frame optical diagnostics, which are critical for constraining the key properties. Here we present deep JWST/MIRI observations of a UV-luminous galaxy at $z=11.04$, CEERS2-588, only 400 Myr after the Big Bang. CEERS2-588 is detected in the MIRI F560W and F770W bands, while deep MIRI/MRS spectroscopy yields no detection of H$\alpha$ or [OIII]$\lambda5007$ line, revealing a prominent Balmer break detected for the first time at $z>10$. Spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting indicates an extended star formation history possibly reaching $z>15$, followed by rapid quenching within the recent $\sim10$ Myr, in stark contrast to other $z>10$ galaxies. The MIRI detections also significantly improve our stellar mass estimate to $\mathrm{log}(M_*/M_\odot)=9.1^{+0.1}_{-0.1}$, making CEERS2-588 the most massive galaxy securely confirmed at $z>10$. Remarkably, the inferred gas-phase metallicity is near solar, exceeding predictions from current theoretical models. These results suggest that efficient starbursts play a key role in producing the abundant luminous galaxy population in the early universe.
#### Extreme-Value Distribution Analysis of the Second CHIME/FRB Catalog: Assessing the Rarity of the One-off FRB 20250316A

 - **Abstract**
 We present a statistical analysis of the extreme brightness of the fast radio burst FRB 20250316A, a luminous, apparently non-repeating event detected by CHIME/FRB. Employing a model-agnostic framework based on the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution applied to the second CHIME/FRB catalog, we quantify its rarity within the current population. Bayesian fitting of GEV models to block maxima of peak flux and fluence data reveals FRB 20250316A to be a profound statistical outlier. For the peak flux, the analysis yields a return period of $\sim$ 600 years ($1\sigma$ credible level), with the underlying distribution being of the heavy-tailed, unbounded Fréchet type ($\xi > 0$). The fluence analysis indicates greater complexity: while the full sample suggests a Fréchet-type distribution with a $\sim50$-year return period in $1\sigma$ credible level, the removal of three other notable outliers points toward a light-tailed Weibull-type distribution ($\xi < 0$) with a finite upper bound far exceeded by FRB 20250316A. This dichotomy highlights the challenge in characterizing the tail of the FRB luminosity function with limited data. Although less extreme in recurrence time than the ``Brightest Of All Time'' gamma-ray burst GRB 221009A, FRB 20250316A constitutes a similarly exceptional event (a potential FRB ``BOAT'') within the short observational history of wide-field radio surveys. Our results underscore the existence of rare, highly luminous events that may probe the upper limits or distinct sub-populations of the FRB luminosity distribution.

 - **Abstract**
 We use deep Hubble Space Telescope imaging to study stellar populations in the outer halo of the spiral galaxy M96, located in the dynamically active Leo I galaxy group. Our imaging targets two fields at a projected distance of 50 kpc from the galaxy's center, with a 50% photometric completeness limit of F814W = 28.0, nearly two magnitudes below the tip of the red giant branch. In both fields we find a clear detection of red giant stars in M96's halo, with a space density that corresponds to an equivalent broadband surface brightness of $\mu_V \approx $ 31.7 mag arcsec$^{-2}$. We find little evidence for any difference in the spatial density or color of the RGB stars in the two fields. Using isochrone matching we derive a median metallicity for the red giants of [M/H] = -1.36 with an interquartile spread of $\pm$0.75 dex. Adopting a power-law radial density profile, we also derive a total halo mass of $M_h = 7.8^{+17.4}_{-4.9}\times10^9$ M$_\odot$, implying a stellar halo mass fraction of $M_{*,halo}/M_{*,tot} = 15^{+33}_{-9}$%, on the high end for spiral galaxies, but with significant uncertainty. Finally, we find that M96 appears offset from the stellar halo mass-metallicity relationship for spirals, with a halo that is distinctly metal-poor for its halo mass. While a variety of systematic effects could have conspired to drive M96 off this relationship, if confirmed our results may argue for a markedly different accretion history for M96 compared to other spirals in the nearby universe.
#### Mapping the Extended Lyman-Alpha Emission within the Circumgalactic Medium of Quasars Hosted by Dusty Starbursts with CubeCarve

 - **Abstract**
 We present a study of extended Ly$\alpha$ emission around four quasars hosted by dusty starbursts, which are composite systems thought to represent a transitional stage in quasar evolution. To extract faint CGM emission in the presence of bright point sources, we introduce {\it CubeCarve}, a dual-channel deconvolution algorithm that separates unresolved quasar emission from spatially extended structure. This approach enables reliable recovery of \Lya\ emission projected onto the quasar position without introducing subtraction artifacts. Using {\it CubeCarve}, we find that the \Lya\ surface brightness profiles of these systems are, on average, fainter and shallower than those of quasars of similar bolometric luminosities. We also find that the total integrated \Lya\ luminosities of the nebulae are lower in systems whose host galaxies exhibit brighter far-infrared emission. These results suggest that the CGM conditions in composite systems differ from those in the broader quasar population. Our study highlights both the physical diversity of quasar CGM environments and the effectiveness of {\it CubeCarve} for recovering diffuse emission in modern IFU datasets.
#### BE Lyncis is not a Black Hole Binary: Lessons From Gaia and Hipparcos Astrometry

 - **Abstract**
 BE Lyncis (BE Lyn) is a well-studied high-amplitude $\delta$ Scuti variable star (HADS). Recently, Niu et al. (2026) analyzed a 39-year baseline of times of maximum light of BE Lyn, reporting that it is the most eccentric binary known ($e \approx 0.9989$) and hosts the nearest black hole (BH) known to date. We analyze Hipparcos and Gaia astrometry of BE Lyn, predicting what the observed proper motion anomaly (PMA) over the 25 year baseline between the two missions would be were the companion really a $\gtrsim 17.5\,M_{\odot}$ BH. We find that the predicted PMA is at least an order of magnitude larger than the observed value of $\approx 1.7 \pm 0.8$ mas yr$^{-1}$, regardless of the assumed orientation of the orbit. We predict the expected Gaia DR3 RUWE for different orientations of the putative BH binary, finding that it ranges from $\approx 2.5$-$4.0$, much larger than the reported value of $1.073$. The observed value is instead consistent with a low-mass secondary or a single star. We find that BE Lyncis would have received a 7-parameter acceleration solution if it were a BH binary, in contradiction with its absence from the Gaia DR3 non-single star catalogs. Finally, we show that the reported orbit is impossible because the luminous star would overflow its Roche lobe at periastron, irrespective of inclination. We recommend caution in interpreting light-travel time effect (LTTE) models that require very high eccentricities, face-on inclinations, or large companion masses. The observed pulsation timing variations are most likely simply a result of red noise or pulsation phase evolution.
