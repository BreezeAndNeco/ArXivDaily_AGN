 - **Abstract**
 Context: Recent studies using Gaia data have reported tidal tail detections for tens to hundreds of open clusters. However, a comprehensive assessment of the reliability & completeness of these detections is lacking. Aims: This work aims to summarise the expected properties of tidal tails based on N-body simulations, review the reliability of tidal tail detections in the literature, and grade them according to a set of diagnostic tests. Methods: We used a grid of 68-20000 Msun simulated clusters & analysed the formation & evolution of the tails. We compiled 122 catalogues (58 unique clusters) from literature, within 500 pc of the Sun. We employed tests based on photometric, morphological & dynamical signatures, & comparisons with simulations, to grade their tails. Results: Based on the simulations, we analysed the complex morphology of the tails & their properties (e.g., size, span, stellar types, number density, & mass function) at various cluster masses & ages. During the first 200 Myr of evolution, the tails typically form a characteristic S shape, with an amplitude that scales with cluster mass. The tail span increases at a rate of 4 times the initial velocity dispersion, & the near-tail is predominantly populated by recent escapees. Conclusions: In the 122 published tail catalogues, we found that 15 gold & 55 silver catalogues passed the majority of the tests. The remaining 51 were graded as bronze; care should be taken before using these for further analysis. The age, metallicity, binary fraction, & mass function of stars in the tails were generally consistent with those of their parent clusters. The gold/silver catalogues (69 catalogues of 40 clusters) represent reliable samples for detailed analyses of tails. Future data will be essential for further validation & for leveraging tidal tails as tracers of cluster dissolution & the Galactic potential.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations have revealed star-forming regions as possible origin sites of very-high-energy (TeV) cosmic rays, not associated with supernova remnants. Colliding-wind binaries (CWBs) are strong X-ray and radio synchrotron emitters and have been proposed as potential accelerators of such particles. We perform high-resolution three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations coupled with test-particle integration to investigate how local plasma conditions affect particle acceleration in CWBs. We find that the maximum particle energies and the hardness of the energy distributions depend on the shock magnetization and cooling efficiency. For moderate magnetization ($\gt$1 G), CWBs can accelerate hadronic particles up to hundreds of TeV or even PeV energies, with more than 1\% of particles reaching the very-high-energy range. By correlating the local acceleration rate with plasma quantities - \textit{magnetic field strength, current density, vorticity, and velocity divergence} - we show that turbulence and magnetic field complexity dominate the acceleration, while classical diffusive shock acceleration plays a limited role. These results suggest that turbulent, magnetically driven processes are key to producing relativistic particles in CWBs, with implications for future high sensitivity $\gamma$-ray observations (e.g. LACT and CTAO).
#### Mineral cloud formation above magma oceans in sub-Neptune atmospheres

 - **Abstract**
 The potential presence of a magma surface below a thick atmosphere primarily composed of hydrogen in some sub-Neptune exoplanets suggests a strong link between the interior composition and atmosphere through chemical coupling of volatile and refractory species. In this study, we aim to model the possibility for mineral cloud formation in the atmosphere of sub-Neptunes from outgassing of refractory species at the magma surface. In our specific cases, we find that mineral clouds easily form near the magma-atmosphere boundary, but also higher in the atmosphere once vapour is mixed to the cooler atmospheric regions. We find that the vertical cloud structure depends on the mixing profile of the atmosphere, with stronger mixing allowing particles to remain lofted in the atmosphere, while weak to moderate mixing produces larger, more sedimented cloud particle profiles. We suggest that due to the strong thermal feedback from cloud opacity, clouds may play an important role in the overall structure of the interior-surface-atmosphere coupled system in sub-Neptunes, as well as affect their observed spectral properties, especially at near-infrared wavelengths.

 - **Abstract**
 Here we present an open-source cloud model for substellar atmospheres, called Virga. The Virga-v0 series has already been widely adopted in the literature. It is written in Python and has heritage from the Ackerman & Marley (2001) model (often referred to as eddysed), used to study clouds on both exoplanets and brown dwarfs. In the development of the official Virga-v1 we have retained all the original functionality of eddysed and updated/expanded several components including the back-end optical constants data, calculations of the Mie properties, available condensate species, saturation vapor pressure curves and formalism for fall speeds calculations. Here we benchmark Virga by reproducing key results in the literature, including the SiO2 cloud detection in WASP-17 b and the brown dwarf Diamondback-Sonora model series. Development of Virga is ongoing, with future versions already planned and ready for release. We encourage community feedback and collaborations within the GitHub code repository.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a pseudo-Newtonian stationary circumbinary slim disk model. We extend the slim disk formalism by including the binary tidal torque and solve the resulting steady-state equations to determine the circumbinary disk structure. We compare the binary slim disk solutions with corresponding binary thin disk solutions, calculate the disk spectrum, explore the impact of different parameters on the system, and estimate the binary shrinkage timescale. We find that; (1) due to the different disk density profiles, the integrated tidal torque exerted on the disk is significantly smaller for the slim disk than for the thin disk; as a result thin disks onto binary black holes can be radiatively significantly more efficient than slim disks; (2) The presence of the secondary alters the emission of the circumbinary disk, making it different from the spectrum of a single black hole Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN); (3) The tidal torque boosts the viscous torque in the outer part of the disk (radii greater than the binary separation), which is strongly dependent on the disk parameters, including the binary mass ratio $q$, the orbital separation $a$, the viscous parameter $\alpha$ and the accretion rate $\dot M$; (4) The vertical component of the potential of the secondary slightly decreases the integrated tidal torque. However, both the vertical and radial components of the potential of the secondary have small impact on the disk radiative flux; (5) Using the integrated disk tidal torque backreacting on the secondary at different orbital separations, we find that the disk provides an efficient way to shrink the binary orbital separation.

 - **Abstract**
 Several models have been proposed to explain the formation of solar prominences, among which the evaporation--condensation model and the direct injection model are the most popular ones. In our previous study we proposed to unify these two models, namely, both are due to localized heating in the chromosphere, presumably via magnetic reconnection. When the localized heating is located in the upper chromosphere, the cold in-situ plasmas are heated to coronal temperatures, then evaporated to the corona, and finally condensate to form a prominence. Such a process is manifested as the evaporation-condensation model. When the localized heating is located in the lower chromosphere, the enhanced in-situ pressure would push the cold plasmas in the upper chromosphere to the corona directly, which is manifested as the direct injection model. While the idea was confirmed by the one-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations, the heating was imposed ad hoc. In order to simulate the localized heating more self-consistently, we perform two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations in this paper, where the localized heating is naturally realized by magnetic reconnection at different heights. The simulations further validate our model. Besides, mass circulation in the solar atmosphere is also briefly discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 The first direct detection of the gravitational wave (GW) event GW170817 and its electromagnetic (EM) counterpart open a new window for studying of multi-messenger astronomy. However, how to identify the remnant of binary neutron star (NS) merger via EM radiation remain an open question. In this paper, we propose a method of color evolution of kilonova emission to identify its progenitors. We assume that the energy of the kilonova is contributed from radioactive decay, magnetar spin-down, and pulsar wind nebula (PWN). The color evolution of kilonova emission associated with short GRB is significant when the spectrum is thermal emission, while it tends towards a constant when the spectrum is non-thermal radiation. On the other hand, if the central engine is a black hole (BH) which is promptly generated by the NS-NS merger or NS-BH merger, then the kilonova is powered only by the radioactive decay. There is no color evolution at the beginning before the peak of kilonova emission, but is significantly and rapidly increasing after the peak. On the contrary, if the central engine is a magnetar or stable NS, the kilonova emission is contributed from radioactive decay, magnetar, and PWN. The color evolution after the peak of kilonova emission is complex behavior which depends on the rotational energy and spin-down time-scale of magnetar, and finally tend to a constant in the late state.

 - **Abstract**
 SCUPOL, the polarimeter for SCUBA on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT), was used for polarization observations of 104 regions at 850 micron wavelength and 15 arcsec resolution in the mapping mode by Matthews et al. (2009). They presented the polarization values and magnetic field morphologies in these regions. In this work, we took the opportunity to use this big legacy survey data to investigate further the collective statistical properties of the measured polarization in different star-forming regions containing cores and filaments. We did not reproduce the polarization maps but used the polarization value catalogs to investigate the statistics of distributions. In some of these regions, the data from the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA) polarization observation at 1.3 mm wavelength and 2.5 arcsec resolution were also available from the TADPOL survey (Hull et al., 2014). We used that data and compared it with JCMT/SCUPOL values. We also study how the direction of outflows appears to relate to the mean B-field direction from large scale (JCMT observation at 15 arcsec) to small scale (CARMA observation at 2.5 arcsec) for the nine core regions common in both.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutron star mergers produce $r$-process elements, with yields that are sensitive to the kinematic and thermodynamic properties of the ejecta. These ejecta properties are potentially affected by dynamically-important feedback from $r$-process heating, which is usually not coupled to the hydrodynamics in post-merger simulations modeling the ejecta launching and expansion. The multi-messenger detection of GW170817 showed the importance of producing reliable ejecta predictions, to maximize the diagnostic potential of future events. In this paper, we develop a prescription for including $r$-process heating as a source term in the hydrodynamic equations. This prescription depends on local fluid properties and on the $Y_{e}$ history as recorded by dedicated tracer particles, which exchange information with the grid using the Cloud-in-Cell method. The method is implemented in long-term viscous hydrodynamic simulations of accretion disk outflows to investigate its feedback on ejecta properties. We find that $r$-process heating can increase the unbound disk ejecta mass by $\sim 10\%$ relative to a baseline case that only considers alpha particle recombination. Nuclear heating also enhances the radial velocity of the ejecta with $Y_e < 0.25$ by up to a factor of two, while concurrently suppressing marginally-bound convective ejecta.

 - **Abstract**
 The dense and gaseous environments of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) can catalyze repeated mergers of stellar-mass black holes (BHs), potentially explaining the high-mass tail of binary black hole (BBH) mergers observed by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK). We present a semi-analytical population synthesis framework that captures key physical processes in AGN disks, including gas capture, migration, binary pair-up, gas hardening, and dynamical binary-single interactions. Our simulations show that AGN disks can produce hierarchical mergers, especially near migration traps, and may contribute to the high-mass, high-spin BBH population. This work opens prospects for constraining both the AGN channel and supermassive black hole growth with future gravitational-wave detections.

 - **Abstract**
 A major aspect of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) involves searching for electromagnetic transmissions from extraterrestrial sources, often using our own transmissions as a guide. Previous studies have suggested that humanity's most consistently detectable technosignatures were transmissions from our deep-space networks and interplanetary radar. In this study, we analyze NASA Deep Space Network logs to explore what strategies for selecting SETI targets and scheduling observations would enhance the chances of detecting such networks. Analyzing Deep Space Network uplink transmission logs over the last 20 yr, we find that these emissions were predominantly directed along the ecliptic plane, towards or directly away from the Sun, and towards other planets. The average duty cycle within the Earth Transit Zone is 20 times higher than that across all ecliptic latitudes. In the case of Mars, we find a species that is able to observe the Solar System for radio emission during an Earth-Mars conjunction in the past 20 yr would have had a 77% chance of observing during one of our transmissions, a $4\times10^5$-fold increase over intercepting our Deep Space Network transmission versus a random observer at a random time. These findings quantify how SETI searches might benefit from prioritizing edge-on exoplanet systems and aligning observation windows with exoplanetary conjunctions or planet-planet occultations because they significantly improve the likelihood of intercepting transmissions from any civilizations employing deep-space networks similar to our own.

 - **Abstract**
 Redback pulsars are a subclass of millisecond pulsar system with a low-mass non-degenerate companion star being ablated by the pulsar. They are of interest due to the insights they can provide for late-stage pulsar evolution during the recycling process. J0523.5-2529 is one such candidate where redback-like emission has been seen at multiple wavelengths except radio. It is a system with a binary orbit of 16.5 hours and a low-mass non-degenerate companion of approximately 0.8 solar masses. The aim of this work was to conduct follow-up radio observations to search for any exhibited radio pulsar emission from J0523.5-2529. This work employs a periodicity and single burst search across 74 percent of the system's orbital phase using a total of 34.5 hours of observations. Observations were carried out using the Murriyang Telescope at Parkes and the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT). Despite extensive orbital phase coverage, no periodic or single-pulse radio emission was detected above a signal-to-noise threshold of 7. A comprehensive search for radio pulsations from J0523.5-2529 using Parkes and GBT yielded no significant emission, likely due to intrinsic faintness, scattering, or eclipses by the companion's outflow. The results demonstrate the elusiveness of the pulsar component in some redback systems and highlight the need for multi-wavelength follow-up and higher-frequency radio observations to constrain the source nature and binary dynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxies reside in extended dark matter halos, but their baryonic content, especially dust, remains less well understood. We aim to investigate the amount and distribution of dust in galactic halos by measuring shifts in the observed magnitudes of background galaxies. Dust absorbs and scatters shorter-wavelength light, reddening background sources. We quantify this effect using multi-band magnitude shifts in the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS) Data Release 4, distinguishing it from achromatic magnification. Our pipeline is validated using MICE2 mock catalogues, and we explore potential systematics arising from galaxy selection, in contrast to previous quasar-based studies. Simulations show that input halo and dust masses can be recovered independently and jointly using galaxy-galaxy lensing (GGL) and magnitude shifts. A minimum redshift separation of $\Delta z_{\mathrm B}\sim0.3$ and brightness cuts are required to minimise overlap effects and the effects of photometric noise, respectively. Applying our pipeline to KiDS data, we first confirm the achromaticity of magnitude shifts in five near-infrared filters ($ZYJHK_{\rm s}$). In optical bands ($ugri$), joint analysis constrains halo mass and dust mass to $0.2$ dex and $0.3$ dex, respectively, yielding $M_{\rm dust}=7.24^{+0.52}_{-0.64} \times 10^7\,M_\odot$ and $\log(M_{\rm halo}^{\rm DM}/M_\odot)=12.33^{+0.08}_{-0.04}$. These results agree with previous studies and represent the first successful measurement of magnitude shifts and halo extinction with KiDS, confirming that galaxies reside in extended baryonic halos enriched by gas and dust from feedback processes.
#### Direct Solution of the Time-Dependent Covariant Radiative Transfer Equation and its Coupling to General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamics with cuHARM

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper we present a major update to the general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) code cuHARM, which adds fully covariant treatment of radiation transport and the subsequent radiation backreaction on the dynamics of the fluid. For the radiative calculations, we discretize and solve the radiation transfer equation on a geodesic grid, in order to resolve the angular distribution of the radiation field everywhere in space. This allows for detailed treatment of non-isotropic radiation fields, which is crucial for accurately resolving regions of intermediate optical depth. We present the equations solved, the numerical methods used, and standard tests used to verify the different aspects of a radiation hydrodynamics code, in particular radiation transport and radiation-fluid interaction. We present an application of the code to the case of black hole radiative accretion. This new radiation module is fully GPU-accelerated and represents a major advance in the capabilities of cuHARM.
#### Long-term simultaneous 2.25/8.60~GHz monitoring of the newly-discovered repeating FRB~20240114A

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the simultaneous monitoring of the repeating fast radio burst (FRB) 20240114A at 2.25 and 8.60~GHz, conducted 66 times between 2024 January 29 and 2025 February 15 with the Shanghai Tianma Radio Telescope (TMRT). In about 180 hours of observation, we detected 155 bursts at 2.25~GHz above a fluence threshold of 0.72~Jy~ms, but none at 8.60~GHz above a fluence threshold of 0.27~Jy~ms. FRB~20240114A exhibited frequency-dependent activity, as evidenced by the non-detections in 14.3 hours of observations at 2.25~GHz prior to 2024 February 24, despite its reported activity below 2~GHz. In contrast to its low-activity state reported below 1.4~GHz between 2024 June and December, FRB~20240114A exhibited high activity at 2.25~GHz in 2024 July with a mean burst rate of $1.72^{+0.18}_{-0.16}~\rm{hr}^{-1}$, followed by a low-activity state. We also detected a short-term reactivation at 2.25~GHz around 2025 January 20, about two weeks after renewed activity was reported below 1.4~GHz by other telescopes. The median burst width at 2.25~GHz is 3~ms, which is narrower than that at lower frequencies. The waiting time distribution peaks at 1019~s, and burst arrivals on hourly timescales consistent with a Poisson process. The isotropic-equivalent energy of bursts spans $10^{37} -10^{39}$~erg. The distribution of burst energy above the completeness threshold ($7.5\times10^{37}$~erg) follows a power-law relation with an index of $\gamma=-1.20\pm0.03\pm0.02$. Finally, we find that FRB~20240114A is at least two orders of magnitude less active at 8.60~GHz than at 2.25~GHz, and we constrain the broadband spectra of the detected bursts.
#### Main and interpulse interaction in PSRs J1842+0358 and J1926+0737: evidence for interpole communication

 - **Abstract**
 Our understanding of the elusive radio-pulsar emission mechanism would be deepened by determining the locality of the emission. Pulsars in which the two poles interact can potentially help solve this challenge. We here report the discovery of interaction of emission between the main and the interpulse in two pulsars -- J1842+0358 and J1926+0737, based on FAST and MeerKAT data. When emission is bright in one pulse, it is dim in the other. Even when split in just 2 groups (strong versus weak) the anti-correlated brightness can change by a factor $\gtrsim$2. Both sources furthermore show the same quasi-periodic modulation from the main and interpulse, at timescales exceeding 100 pulse periods. The longitude stationary modulation from at least one pulse suggests that it is a key signature for interpulse pulsars showing main and interpulse interaction. If the interaction happens within an isolated magnetosphere, without external influences, either communication between the opposite poles is required, or global changes drive both. This detailed study of these two sources was only made possible by improved sensitivity. The fact that both show two-pole modulation strongly suggests this is a general phenomenon in interpulse pulsars. In regular pulsars only one pole is visible, and a number of these show correlated changes between the profile and spin-down rate, that are also thought to be caused by global magnetospheric changes. Our results strengthen the case that such interactive magnetospheres are common to all pulsars.
#### Beyond the Nyquist frequency: Asteroseismic catalog of undersampled Kepler late subgiants and early red giants

 - **Abstract**
 Subgiants and early red giants are crucial for studying the first dredge-up, a key evolutionary phase where the convective envelope deepens, mixing previously interior-processed material and bringing it to the surface. Yet, very few have been seismically characterized with Kepler because their oscillation frequencies are close to the 30 minute sampling frequency of the mission. We developed a new method as part of the new PyA2Z code to identify super-Nyquist oscillators and infer their global seismic parameters, $\nu_\mathrm{max}$ and large separation, $\Delta\nu$. Applying PyA2Z to 2 065 Kepler targets, we seismically characterize 285 super-Nyquist and 168 close-to-Nyquist stars with masses from 0.8 to 1.6 M$_\odot$. In combination with APOGEE spectroscopy, Gaia spectro-photometry, and stellar models, we derive stellar ages for the sample. There is good agreement between the predicted and actual positions of stars on the HR diagram (luminosity vs. effective temperature) as a function of mass and composition. While the timing of dredge-up is consistent with predictions, the magnitude and mass dependence show discrepancies with models, possibly due to uncertainties in model physics or calibration issues in observed abundance scales.
