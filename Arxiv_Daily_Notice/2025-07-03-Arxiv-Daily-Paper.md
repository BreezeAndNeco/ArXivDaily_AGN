 - **Abstract**
 One striking feature of binary black hole (BBH) mergers observed in the first decade of gravitational-wave astronomy is an excess of events with component masses around $35\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. Multiple formation channels have been proposed to explain this excess. To distinguish among these channels, it is essential to examine their predicted population-level distributions across additional parameters. In this work, we focus on BBH mergers near the $35\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ peak and infer the population distributions of primary mass ($m_1$), mass ratio ($q$), effective spin ($\chi_{\rm eff}$), and redshift ($z$). We observe a gradual increase in the merger rate with $m_1$, rising by a factor of $3$ from $20\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ to a peak around $34\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, followed by a sharp, order-of-magnitude decline by $50\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. This population also shows a weak preference for equal-mass mergers and has a $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distribution skewed toward positive values, with a median of zero excluded at approximately $90\%$ confidence. We find no significant $q-\chi_{\rm eff}$ correlation in the $35\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ peak population, suggesting that lower-mass systems ($m_1<20\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) likely drive the $q-\chi_{\rm eff}$ anti-correlation observed in the full BBH merger catalog. The redshift evolution of the merger rate is consistent with the cosmic star formation rate. We compare our findings with predictions from a wide range of formation channels. We find that common variants of the pair-instability supernova scenario, as well as hierarchical merger models, are incompatible with the observed features of the $35\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ population. Ultimately, none of the formation channels we consider can explain all or even most of the features observed in this population. The ''mid-thirties'' of black hole mergers are in crisis.

 - **Abstract**
 The gravitational potential of supermassive black holes is so powerful that it triggers some of the most intense phenomena in the Universe. Accretion onto these objects and relativistic jet emission from their vicinity are observable across a wide range of frequencies and throughout cosmic history. However, despite this wealth of data, many aspects of their underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Investigating this phenomena across all frequencies is crucial, yet some energy windows are still poorly explored. One such window is the MeV energy range: many key signatures related to the emission from the SMBH environment - both in quiescent and active phases - are expected to lie between one and several hundreds MeV. In this work, we explore some of the open questions regarding the behavior and emission processes in the surroundings of SMBHs, and how these questions might be approached. From the elusive nature of Fermi bubbles around our Galactic Centre, to the origin of high-energy neutrinos in the nuclei and jets of Active Galactic Nuclei, to the nature and emission mechanisms of the most powerful blazars, the MeV window stands out as a crucial key to understanding SMBH physics.

 - **Abstract**
 Many theoretical and observational studies have suggested that galaxy mergers may trigger enhanced star formation or active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity. We present an analysis of merging and nonmerging galaxies from $0.2 \leq z \leq 3$ in the IllustrisTNG50 simulation. These galaxies encompass a range of masses ($M_\star > 10^{8}M_\odot$), multiple merger stages, and mass ratios ($\geq1:10$). We examine the effect that galaxy mergers have on star formation and black hole accretion rates in the TNG50 universe. We additionally investigate how galaxy and black hole mass, merger stage, merger mass ratio, and redshift affect these quantities. Mergers in our sample show excess specific star formation rates (sSFR) at $z \leq 3$ and enhanced specific black hole accretion rates (sBHAR) at $z \lesssim 2$. The difference between sSFRs and sBHARs in the merging sample compared to the non-merging sample increases as redshift decreases. Additionally, we show that these enhancements persist for at least $\sim1$ Gyr after the merger event. Investigating how mergers behave in the TNG50 simulation throughout cosmic time enables both a better appreciation of the importance of spatial resolution in cosmological simulations and a better basis to understand our high-$z$ universe with observations from \textit{JWST}.

 - **Abstract**
 The astrophysical origin of elements synthesized through the rapid neutron capture process ($r-$process) is a long standing mystery. The hot and dense environments of core-collapse supernovae have been suggested as potential $r-$process sites, particularly the neutrino-driven wind from the newly-born protoneutron star (PNS). Wind models that neglect the potential effects of strong magnetic fields and/or rapid rotation of the PNS typically fail to achieve the necessary conditions for production of the third $r-$process peak, but robustly produce a limited or weak $r-$process for neutron-rich winds. Axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamic simulations of rotating and non-rotating PNS winds with magnetar-strength fields reveal that high entropy material is quasi-periodically ejected from the equatorial closed zone of the PNS magnetosphere. Here, we post-process tracer particle trajectories from these simulations using a nuclear reaction network in order to explore the resulting nucleosynthesis across a range of PNS magnetic field strengths, rotation rates, and neutrino luminosities (cooling phase after core-bounce). We find that a robust $r-$process up to and beyond the third peak is generic to magnetar birth, even for magnetic fields as weak as $\sim 5\times 10^{14}$ G. Depending on the distribution of magnetic field strengths and rotation at birth, we estimate that magnetized PNS winds could account for $\sim 5-100\%$ of the Galactic $r-$process inventory, extending up to the third peak. The robust $r-$process in our calculations is accompanied by overproduction of elements with mass number $\rm A\lesssim 120$ compared to the Solar abundances. We also find that $^{92}\rm Mo$ (a $p-$isotope) is produced in significant quantities in neutron-rich winds.
#### A theoretical prediction for the dipole in nearby distances using cosmography

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmography is a widely applied method to infer kinematics of the Universe at small cosmological scales while remaining agnostic about the theory of gravity at play. Usually cosmologists invoke the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric in cosmographic analyses, however generalised approaches allow for analyses outside of any assumed geometrical model. These methods have great promise to be able to model-independently map the cosmic neighborhood where the Universe has not yet converged to isotropy. In this regime, anisotropies can bias parameter inferences if they are not accounted for, and thus must be included for precision cosmology analyses, even when the principle aim is to infer the background cosmology. In this paper, we develop a method to predict the dipole in luminosity distances that arises due to nearby inhomogeneities. This is the leading-order correction to the standard isotropic distance-redshift law. Within a very broad class of general-relativistic universe models, we provide an interpretation of the dipole in terms of the gradients in expansion rate and density which is free from any underlying background cosmology. We use numerical relativity simulations, with improved initial data methods, alongside fully relativistic ray tracing to test the power of our prediction. We find our prediction accurately captures the dipole signature in our simulations to within ~10% for redshifts $z\lesssim 0.07$ in reasonably smooth simulations. In the presence of more non-linear density fields, we find this reduces to $z\lesssim 0.02$. This represents up to an order of magnitude improvement with respect to what is achieved by naive, local cosmography-based predictions. Our paper thus addresses important issues regarding convergence properties of anisotropic cosmographic series expansions that would otherwise limit their applicability to very narrow redshift ranges.
#### Breaking Through the Cosmic Fog: JWST/NIRSpec Constraints on Ionizing Photon Escape in Reionization-Era Galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 The escape fraction of Lyman continuum photons (fesc(LyC)) is the last key unknown in our understanding of cosmic reionization. Directly estimating the escape fraction (fesc) of ionizing photons in the epoch of reionization (EoR) is impossible, due to the opacity of the intergalactic medium (IGM). However, a high fesc leaves clear imprints in the spectrum of a galaxy, due to reduced nebular line and continuum emission, which also leads to bluer UV continuum slopes (betaUV). Here, we exploit the large archive of deep JWST/NIRSpec spectra from the DAWN JWST Archive to analyze over 1'400 galaxies at 5 < zspec < 10 and constrain their fesc based on SED fitting enhanced with a picket fence model. We identify 71 high-confidence sources with significant fesc based on Bayes factor analysis strongly favouring fesc > 0 over fesc = 0 solutions. We compare the characteristics of this high-escape subset against both the parent sample and established diagnostics including betaUV slope, O32, and SFR surface density (SigmaSFR). For the overall sample, we find that most sources have a low escape fraction (<1%), however, a small subset of sources seems to emit a large number of their ionizing photons into the IGM, such that the average fesc is found to be ~10%, as needed for galaxies to drive reionization. Although uncertainties remain regarding recent burstiness and the intrinsic stellar ionizing photon output at low metallicities, our results demonstrate the unique capability of JWST/NIRSpec to identify individual LyC leakers, measure average fesc and thus constrain the drivers of cosmic reionization.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive study of five nearby active galaxies featuring large (tens of kpc) extended emission-line regions (EELRs). The study is based on large-format integral field spectroscopic observations conducted with the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) at the Very Large Telescope (VLT). The spatially resolved kinematics of the ionized gas and stellar components show signs of rotation, bi-conical outflows, and complex behavior likely associated with past interactions. Analysis of the physical conditions of the EELRs indicates that in these systems, the active galactic nucleus (AGN) is the primary ionization source. Using radiative transfer simulations, we compare the ionization state across the EELRs to estimate the required AGN bolometric luminosities at different radial distances. Then, considering the projected light travel time, we reconstruct the inferred AGN luminosity curves. We find that all sources are consistent with a fading trend in intrinsic AGN luminosity by 0.2--3 dex over timescales of 40,000--80,000 years, with a time dependence consistent with previous studies of fading AGNs. These results support the hypothesis that most AGN undergo significant fluctuations in their accretion rates over multiple timescales ranging from 10,000 to 1,000,000 years, as proposed by existing theoretical models. These results provide new insights into the transient phases of AGN activity at previously unexplored scales and their potential long-term impact on their host galaxies through various feedback mechanisms.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the star formation process across the disk of M33 using a multiwavelength dataset and disk dynamics. We computed numerically equilibrium values of gas densities and scale heights across the disk, taking into account dark matter and testing several analytic approximations that are often used to estimate these variables and the hydrostatic pressure. Orthogonal regressions and hierarchical Bayesian models, as well as random forest (RF) analyses, were used to establish the fundamental relations at physical scales from 160~pc to 1~kpc. The gas pressure, is the main driver of the star formation rate (SFR) surface density throughout the whole star-forming disk of M33. High-pressure regions enhance the atomic-to-molecular gas conversion, with the molecular hydrogen mass surface density being tightly correlated to pressure and a uniform scaling law throughout the M33 disk. The relation between pressure and SFR surface density differs, showing a change in slope from the inner to the outer disk. Scaling laws do not depend on the physical scale and brings out an intrinsic scatter linked to variations in the efficiency and relative age of the molecular gas-to-stars conversion. In the inner disk, where spiral arms are present and the stellar surface density dominates gravity, the pressure and SFR surface densidy establish an almost linear correlation with a smaller dispersion than that of the molecular gas -- SFR surface density relation. In the atomic gas-dominated outer disk, the SFR density has a steeper dependence on pressure, which we propose could be the result of an increasing fraction of diffuse molecular gas that does not form stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetospheric accretion is a key process that shapes the inner disks of T Tauri stars, controlling mass and angular momentum evolution. It produces strong ultraviolet and optical emission that irradiates the planet-forming environment. In this work, we characterize the magnetospheric geometries, accretion rates, extinction properties, and hotspot structures of 67 T Tauri stars in the largest and most consistent study of ultraviolet and optical accretion signatures to date. To do so, we apply an accretion flow model to velocity-resolved H$\alpha$ profiles for T Tauri stars from the HST/ULLYSES program with consistently-derived stellar parameters. We find typical magnetospheric truncation radii to be almost half of the usually-assumed value of 5 stellar radii. We then model the same stars' HST/STIS spectra with an accretion shock model, finding a diverse range of hotspot structures. Phase-folding multi-epoch shock models reveals rotational modulation of observed hotspot energy flux densities, indicative of hotspots that persist for at least 3 stellar rotation periods. For the first time, we perform a large-scale, self-consistent comparison of accretion rates measured using accretion flow and shock models, finding them to be consistent within $\sim$0.16 dex for contemporaneous observations. Finally, we find that up to 50% of the total accretion luminosity is at short wavelengths accessible only from space, highlighting the crucial role of ultraviolet spectra in constraining accretion spectral energy distributions, hotspot structure, and extinction.

 - **Abstract**
 We conducted a multi-wavelength monitoring campaign of the blazar S5 0716+714 from 2022 November 26 to 2023 May 28 using optical telescopes in Egypt and Bulgaria. Data were taken during 84 nights in 11 of which intranight monitoring was performed. We also use optical and gamma-ray survey data. On long-term time-scales, we find a gradual decrease of the S5 0716+714 activity since the beginning of 2020 in both optical and gamma-rays. On short-term time-scales, the individual optical light curves are strongly correlated among each other with no time lags observed. The V-band percentage variability amplitude equals 97.59 +/- 0.02 per cent. We find moderate flatter-when-brighter spectral behaviour with the strength of the 'spectral index - flux' anti-correlation decreasing towards the longer wavelengths. The main feature of the short-term light curves is a transient quasi-periodic oscillation with a period of 43.5 +/- 3.6 d. The V-band light curve is modelled with two helically moving blobs and a synchrotron flare. We estimate the resulting parameters, as well as limits on the radius, magnetic field strength, and electron Lorentz factor of the region responsible for the flare. On intranight time-scales, we find smooth flux variations with no flares and derive a duty cycle in the range ~10-20 per cent. The lack of flares on intranight time-scales could result from a temporarily homogeneous jet flow without formation of turbulent cells in terms of prevented Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. The analysis of the data reveals a low activity of S5 0716+714 on all time-scales during the observation period.
#### Surface Waves at Switchback Boundaries in the Young Solar Wind from Parker Solar Probe Observations

 - **Abstract**
 Switchbacks (SBs) are localized magnetic field deflections in the solar wind, marked by abrupt changes in the magnetic field direction relative to the ambient solar wind. Observations onboard Parker Solar Probe (PSP) at heliocentric distances below 50 Solar Radii (Rs) showed that within SBs, perturbations in the magnetic field ({\Delta}B) and the bulk solar wind velocity ({\Delta}V) align, i.e., {\Delta}B~{\Delta}V, producing enhanced radial velocity spikes. In this study, we examine the characteristics of SB boundaries, with particular attention to the role of boundary shear flow instabilities (Kelvin-Helmholtz instability - KHI) for surface wave phenomena based on the in situ magnetic field, plasma speed, and plasma density measurements from PSP. The results indicate that SB boundaries can be unstable for generating KHI-driven surface waves, suggesting that the wave activity observed at SB boundaries is caused by shear flow instabilities. In addition, the continued development of KHI may lead to boundary erosion, contributing to the radial evolution of SBs via structural weakening or broadening. However, when {\Delta}B and {\Delta}V are closely aligned, the boundary remains stable unless the velocity shear significantly exceeds the magnetic shear. Since the observed velocity shear typically ranges from 40% to 90% of magnetic shear, the instability condition is generally not satisfied. Thus, the configuration leading to the instability arises from deviations from precise alignment of {\Delta}B and {\Delta}V in the young solar wind, and the release of the KHI presumably leads to the formation of the {\Delta}B and {\Delta}V alignment observed at SB boundaries located at 35-55 Rs.

 - **Abstract**
 Due to its proximity, Markarian 421 is one of the most extensively studied jetted active galactic nuclei. Its spectral energy distribution and light curve are widely studied, serving as primary means for understanding jet radiation mechanisms. Numerous intriguing observational results have been discovered, some of which, such as the hard X-ray excess, and the associated variability between X-ray and very-high-energy (VHE) emissions, challenge the commonly adopted one-zone leptonic model. In this work, by establishing a time-dependent leptohadronic model, we explore whether the hard X-ray excess and the associated variability between X-ray and VHE emissions could be interpreted by emission from hadronic interactions. Our modeling finds that for the hard X-ray excess found in 2013, both of the secondary emissions from photohadronic and hadronuclear interactions could be a possible explanation for the hard X-ray excess without introducing a super-Eddington jet power. The emission from the photohadronic interactions contributes only to the hard X-ray band, while the hadronuclear interactions also predict VHE emissions associated with the hard X-rays. While for the hard X-ray excess found in 2016, only the secondary emissions from photohadronic interactions provide an interpretation at the cost of introducing a super-Eddington jet power. For the associated variability between X-ray and VHE emissions in 2017, we find that hadronic interactions fail to provide a possible interpretation.

 - **Abstract**
 In this Letter, we simulate the collision between outflows from the tidal disruption of a 1M$_\odot$ main sequence star around a $10^6$M$_\odot$ black hole and an initially spherically symmetric circumnuclear cloud. We launch super-Eddington outflows self-consistently by simulating the disruption of stars on both bound and unbound initial orbits using general relativistic smoothed particle hydrodynamics. We find shocks formed as early as $\sim 10~$days after the initial stellar disruption produce prompt radio emission. The shock radius ($\approx~10^{17}$~cm), velocity ($\sim 0.15$c) and total energy ($\sim 10^{51}$ erg) in our simulations match those inferred from radio observations of tidal disruption events (TDEs). We ray-trace to produce synthetic radio images and spectra to compare with the observations. While the TDE outflow is quasi-spherical, the synchrotron emitting region is aspherical but with reflection symmetry above and below the initial orbital plane. Our synthetic spectra show continuous decay in peak frequency, matching prompt radio TDE observations. Our model supports the hypothesis that synchrotron radio flares from TDEs result from the collision between outflows and the circumnuclear material.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the relationship between supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their host galaxies at different redshifts is crucial for unraveling the processes of SMBH-galaxy co-evolution. We present the properties of nine type 1 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) at intermediate redshift ($2<z<4$) using the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES). All of them show the significant $\mathrm{H\alpha}$ broad line and the AGN contribution in spectral energy distribution. Our sample covers SMBH masses of $10^{6.1-8.2}\ M_\odot$ and stellar masses of $10^{9.3-11.0}\ M_\odot$, comparable to those of the AGNs observed in the local universe. In the low-mass SMBH regime ($<10^{8}\ M_\odot$), the BH-to-stellar mass ratios in our sample ($0.01-0.1\%$) differ from those of the AGNs at $z>4$ ($1-10\%$), suggesting that black holes and galaxies may trace different evolutionary pathways at intermediate and high redshift. We also perform 2D image decomposition using GALFIT to constrain the bulge mass by evaluating the bulge contribution in the rest-frame near-infrared flux. We identify the AGNs with low BH-to-bulge mass ratios compared to those observed in the nearby bulge-dominant galaxies. This finding suggests the existence of a galaxy-first evolutionary path, in which bulge formation occurs before substantial gas is efficiently accreted onto the central engine.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic reionization marks a critical epoch when the first galaxies ionized the intergalactic medium through the escape of Lyman continuum (LyC) radiation. Young, massive star clusters are believed to be the primary LyC sources, yet the physical mechanisms enabling LyC escape remain poorly understood. Most existing studies rely on spatially integrated observations, which lack the resolution to resolve internal galaxy structure and pinpoint where and how LyC photons escape. To address this, we propose a science case for the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) that enables spatially resolved spectroscopy of LyC-emitting star clusters and their environments in low-redshift galaxies. This requires a UV integral field unit (IFU) with coverage down to ~ 900 Angstrom and a spatial resolution of 10-100 pc-capabilities essential for directly detecting LyC escape and mapping the surrounding interstellar medium. With such instrumentation, we will map cluster-scale LyC escape fractions, characterize the physical conditions of the surrounding interstellar medium, and directly observe feedback-driven outflows that facilitate LyC leakage. These observations will enable novel calibrations of indirect LyC indicators at unprecedented spatial resolution and establish direct connections between local LyC processes and those in high-redshift, clumpy star-forming galaxies. In the long run, this program will build the physical framework needed to understand how galaxies reionized the early universe and shaped its subsequent evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the possibility that Type Ia supernovae might be produced by binary systems where the companion of the exploding white dwarf is an M-dwarf star. Such companion would appear as a runaway star, retaining its pre-explosion orbital velocity along with a kick imparted by the supernova ejecta. It might be rapidly rotating, from being tidally locked with the white dwarf prior to explosion in a very close binary. For this study, we perform a series of multidimensional hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the interaction between M-dwarf companions and SN ejecta, followed by post-impact stellar evolution modeling using the MESA code. Our initial models in the 3D simulations had high spin angular momenta and the effects of magnetic braking have been included. They very significantly reduce the final rotation. A surviving companion candidate, MV-G272, has recently been discovered in the supernova remnant G272.2-3.2, which is an 8.9$\sigma$ proper motion outlier, although being slowly rotating. Our results show that the properties of this companion (luminosity, effective temperature, surface gravity) can be reproduced by our post-impact M-dwarf models. The slow rotation, which is a common characteristic with several proposed hypervelocity SN companions, can be explained by magnetic braking during the post-impact evolution, thus supporting the possibility that the MV-G272 star is the surviving companion of the Type Ia supernova now found as G272.2-3.2 SNR.

 Protoplanets can interact with their natal disks and generate gas and dust substructures such as gaps and rings. However, how these planet-induced substructures affect the disk temperature, and how that in turn influences the substructures, remains unclear. We aim to study disk substructures and the thermal structure self-consistently and explore their impact on volatile distribution. To this end, we perform iterative multi-fluid hydrodynamical and radiative transfer simulations of planet-disk interactions. We find that the temperature in a structured disk deviates significantly from that of a smooth disk due to giant planet formation. In particular, midplane temperatures in gaps can increase by tens of Kelvin, leading to volatile sublimation as well as radial shifts and multiplication of icelines. Comparing our multi-dust models with previous gas-only models, we find that the former produces slightly shallower gaps and temperatures about 10 K ($\sim25\%$) higher. Furthermore, the temperature at dust rings formed by pressure bumps can drop by several Kelvin, creating volatile freeze-out regions. Nevertheless, the overall midplane ice distribution is not strongly sensitive to whether dust is included. We also investigate the effect of varying disk viscosity. Increasing $\alpha$ viscosity from $10^{-4}$ to $10^{-2}$ leads to a roughly 10 K ($\sim25\%$) warmer midplane due to enhanced vertical dust mixing. However, higher viscosity suppresses gap opening and reduces the temperature enhancement within gaps. As a result, iceline locations do not follow a simple trend with viscosity. Finally, we propose an observational strategy using ALMA to test our predicted temperature changes within disk gaps.

 - **Abstract**
 Changing-Look Active Galactic Nuclei (CLAGN) are a rare subset of AGN that show significant changes to the flux of broad Balmer emission lines. Recent studies of CLAGN, such as 1ES 1927+654 and Mrk 590, have revealed that changes in the optically observed accretion rate are accompanied by changes in radio activity. We present a time-domain population study of 474 spectroscopically confirmed CLAGN at radio wavelengths using the Australia SKA Pathfinder Variable and Slow Transients Survey and the Very Large Array Sky Survey. We compare the radio properties of this CLAGN sample to a control sample of AGN that have not had recent changing-look events, and to AGN that were found to have transitioned from radio-quiet to radio-loud over 10-year timescales in VLASS. For 20 newly studied CLAGN detected in ASKAP VAST, we do not detect Mrk 590 or 1ES 1927+654-like fading of the radio flux in the 10 years following changing-look events. For 6 CLAGN with a sufficiently low redshift and high enough mass, we rule out a Mrk 590-like flare. We find that at the population level, CLAGN have higher VAST/VLASS detection rates, lower fractions of radio loudness, and higher variability rates in the 1 GHz frequency compared to the control AGN. Through VLA observations of radio SEDs and Magellan spectroscopic observations, we do not find evidence of a link between CLAGN and AGN that transitioned from radio-loud to radio-quiet in VLASS. We discuss the implications of this study for the physical mechanisms that drive enhanced accretion episodes.

 - **Abstract**
 Spectroscopic observations are essential for confirming associations, measuring kinematics, and determining stellar populations in dwarf galaxies. Here, we present Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI) spectra for 12 MATLAS survey dwarfs. For 9, we confirm recession velocities consistent with their literature-assumed host galaxies. We propose revisions of the host galaxy associations for MATLAS-631, 1494, and 1938. For MATLAS-1494, our measured redshift reclassifies it from an ultra-diffuse galaxy candidate to a dwarf galaxy that is of smaller physical size and places it in the field. It also appears old and passive, providing a challenge to models that invoke quenching by tidal effects. Additionally, we measure stellar population estimates for 7 of the 12 galaxies, finding a 'mixed bag' of old quenched galaxies and those that are currently forming stars. Compared to the literature we find generally younger ages and higher metallicities. This result may help reconcile the observed offset of MATLAS survey dwarf galaxies from the universal stellar mass-metallicity relationship reported by Heesters et al. (2023).

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed comparison of  $\Lambda$CDM, $\omega$CDM, and $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM cosmologies using the latest redshift-resolved BAO measurements from DESI DR2. By separating $r_d$-dependent and $r_d$-independent observables and applying both fixed and model-derived sound horizon values, we test the consistency of each model across 24 observables spanning redshift 0.2 to 2.3. Our results show that the $\omega$CDM model is statistically favored over $\Lambda$CDM, with lower $\chi^2$, AIC, and BIC values and reduced residuals, especially at $z = 0.706$ and 0.934. In contrast, the $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM model is strongly disfavored, even when using model-specific $r_d$, due to large residuals caused by the unphysical high-redshift behavior.

 - **Abstract**
 Fourier neural operators (FNOs) provide a mesh-independent way to learn solution operators for partial differential equations, yet their efficacy for magnetized turbulence is largely unexplored. Here we train an FNO surrogate for the 2-D Orszag-Tang vortex, a canonical non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) benchmark, across an ensemble of viscosities and magnetic diffusivities. On unseen parameter settings the model achieves a mean-squared error of $\approx 6 \times 10^{-3}$ in velocity and $\approx 10^{-3}$ in magnetic field, reproduces energy spectra and dissipation rates within $96\%$ accuracy, and retains temporal coherence over long timescales. Spectral analysis shows accurate recovery of large- and intermediate-scale structures, with degradation at the smallest resolved scales due to Fourier-mode truncation. Relative to a UNet baseline the FNO cuts error by $97\%$, and compared with a high-order finite-volume solver it delivers a $25\times$ inference speed-up, offering a practical path to rapid parameter sweeps in MHD simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we present for the first time a comprehensive statistical study between type II radio bursts from the metric (m) to the dekameric-hectometric (DH) domain and their associated solar and space weather (SW) phenomena, namely, solar flares (SFs), sunspot (SN) configurations, filament eruptions, coronal mass ejections (CMEs), their interplanetary (IP) counterparts (ICMEs) and shocks, in situ detected particles and geomagnetic storms (GSs). The m-only and m+DH radio signatures are identified from dynamic spectra provided by the ground-based RSTN stations distributed over the globe together with Wind/WAVES satellite data. The DH-only type IIs are adopted from a ready catalog based on Wind/WAVES spacecraft data. We perform the temporal and spatial association between the radio emission and the listed above activity events during solar cycle (SC) 24, separately for the three sub-categories, m-only, m+DH and DH-only type IIs. A quantitative assessment on the occurrence rates is presented as a function of the strength of the specific SW phenomena: highest rates are obtained with CMEs, SFs, filament eruptions, and SN configurations, whereas a much weaker relationship is found with ICMEs, IP shocks, energetic particles, and GSs. The potential of the obtained rates to be used in empirical or physics-based models for SW forecasting is discussed.

 We present an investigation of the Extreme-Ultraviolet (EUV) wave linked to the flare that occurred on 28 October 2021, along with the associated coronal loop oscillation and type II radio burst. The EUV wave was observed by multi-viewpoint with Solar Dynamics Observatory and Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory - A. The associated coronal mass ejection (CME) was observed by Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) as well by COR1 coronagraph. From the multi-view observation, we found that the EUV wave is propagated ahead of the connected CME. The coronal magnetic field measurement was performed by the coronal loop oscillations as well by the associated m-type II radio burst observations. We found the magnetic field strength values computed by both methods are consistence and are in the range of ~ 5 to 10 G.

 - **Abstract**
 Light reprocessed by dust grains emitting in the infrared allows the study of the physics at play in dusty, embedded regions, where ultraviolet and optical wavelengths are attenuated. Infrared telescopes such as JWST have made it possible to study the earliest feedback phases, when stars are shielded by cocoons of gas and dust. This phase is crucial for unravelling the effects of feedback from young stars, leading to their emergence and the dispersal of their host molecular clouds. Here we show that the transition from the embedded to the exposed phase of star formation is short (< 4 Myr) and sometimes almost absent (< 1 Myr), across a sample of 37 nearby star-forming galaxies, covering a wide range of morphologies from massive barred spirals to irregular dwarfs. The short duration of the dust-clearing timescales suggests a predominant role of pre-supernova feedback mechanisms in revealing newborn stars, confirming previous results on smaller samples and allowing, for the first time, a statistical analysis of their dependencies. We find that the timescales associated with mid-infrared emission at 21 {\mu}m, tracing a dust-embedded feedback phase, are controlled by a complex interplay between giant molecular cloud properties (masses and velocity dispersions) and galaxy morphology. We report relatively longer durations of the embedded phase of star formation in barred spiral galaxies, while this phase is significantly reduced in low-mass irregular dwarf galaxies. We discuss tentative trends with gas-phase metallicity, which may favor faster cloud dispersal at low metallicities.

 The X-ray Integral Field Unit is the X-ray imaging spectrometer on-board one of ESA's next large missions, Athena. Athena is set to investigate the theme of the Hot and Energetic Universe, with a launch planned in the late-2030s. Based on a high sensitivity Transition Edge Sensor (TES) detector array operated at very low temperature (50 mK), X-IFU will provide spatially resolved high resolution spectroscopy of the X-ray sky in the 0.2-12 keV energy band, with an energy resolution goal of 4 eV up to 7 keV [3 eV design goal]. This paper presents the current calibration plan of the X-IFU. It provides the requirements applicable to the X-IFU calibration, describes the overall calibration strategy, and details the procedure and sources needed for the ground calibration of each parameter or characteristics of the X-IFU.

 - **Abstract**
 The $L_{\rm IR}-L_{\rm HCN}$ relation suggests that there is a tight connection between dense gas and star formation. We use data from the Close AGN Reference Survey (CARS) to investigate the dense gas - star formation relation in AGN hosting galaxies, and the use of dense gas as an active galactic nuclei (AGN) diagnostic. Our sample contains five Type-1 (unobscured) AGN that were observed with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) with the aim to detect HCN(4-3), HCO$^+$(4-3) and CS(7-6). We detect the dense gas emission required for this analysis in 3 of the 5 targets. We find that despite the potential impact from the AGN on the line fluxes of these sources, they still follow the $L_{\rm IR}-L_{\rm HCN}$ relation. We then go on to test claims that the HCN/HCO+ and HCN/CS line ratios can be used as a tool to classify AGN in the sub-mm HCN diagram. We produce the classic ionised emission-line ratio diagnostics (the so-called BPT diagrams), using available CARS data from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE). We then compare the BPT classification with the sub-mm classification made using the dense gas tracers. Where it was possible to complete the analysis we find general agreement between optical and sub-mm classified gas excitation mechanisms. This suggests that AGN can contribute to the excitation of both the low density gas in the warm ionised medium and the high density gas in molecular clouds simultaneously, perhaps through X-ray, cosmic ray or shock heating mechanisms.

 - **Abstract**
 The aim of this work is to construct mock galaxy catalogues that accurately reproduce the redshift evolution of galaxy number density, clustering statistics, and baryonic properties, such as stellar mass for luminous red galaxies (LRGs) and absolute magnitude in the $r$-band for the bright galaxy sample (BGS), based on the first three years of observations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). To achieve this, we applied the subhalo abundance matching (SHAM) technique to the Uchuu $N$-body simulation, which follows the evolution of 2.1 trillion particles within a volume of $8\,h^{-3}\,\mathrm{Gpc}^{3}$, assuming a Planck base-$\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Using SHAM, we populated Uchuu subhalos with LRGs and BGS-BRIGHT ($r<19.5$) galaxies up to redshift $z=1.1$, assigning stellar masses to LRGs and luminosities to BGS galaxies (up to $M_{\rm r}\leq 20$). Furthermore, we analyzed the clustering dependence on stellar mass and luminosity for each tracer. Our results show that the Uchuu BGS-BRIGHT and LRG mocks accurately reproduce the observed redshift evolution of clustering, with better than 5\% agreement for separations of $1<r<20\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$ and below 10\% for $0.1<r<1\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$. For the Uchuu-LRG mock, we successfully captured the stellar mass dependence of clustering, while for the Uchuu-BGS mock, we replicated the clustering for various volume-limited subsamples. We also find good agreement between the data and mocks in the dependence of large-scale bias on luminosity for BGS-BRIGHT galaxies and on stellar mass for LRGs. Altogether, these results equip DESI with robust tools for generating high-fidelity lightcones for the remainder of the survey, thereby enhancing our understanding of the galaxy--halo connection.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first cosmological constraints from a joint analysis of galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing using extended SubHalo Abundance Matching (SHAMe). We analyse stellar mass-selected Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) galaxy clustering and Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS-1000) galaxy-galaxy lensing and find constraints on $S_8\equiv\sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3}=0.793^{+0.025}_{-0.024}$, in agreement with Planck at 1.7$\sigma$, and consistent with previous results. We are able to constrain all 5 SHAMe parameters, which describe the galaxy-subhalo connection. We validate our methodology by first applying it to simulated catalogues, generated from the TNG300 simulation, which mimic the stellar mass selection of our real data. We show that we are able to recover the input cosmology for both our fiducial and all-scale analyses. Our all-scale analysis extends to scales of galaxy-galaxy lensing below $r_\mathrm{p}<1.4\,\mathrm{Mpc}/h$, which we exclude in our fiducial analysis to avoid baryonic effects. When including all scales, we find a value of $S_8$, which is 1.26$\sigma$ higher than our fiducial result (against naive expectations where baryonic feedback should lead to small-scale power suppression), and in agreement with Planck at 0.9$\sigma$. We also find a 21% tighter constraint on $S_8$ and a 29% tighter constraint on $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ compared to our fiducial analysis. This work shows the power and potential of joint small-scale galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing analyses using SHAMe.

 - **Abstract**
 Periodic variations in the Sun and Moon's gravitational pull cause small changes in Earth's rotational axis direction called nutation. Nutation components in the retrograde quasi-diurnal frequency band measured in the terrestrial reference frame are amplified by resonance with the Free Core Nutation (FCN), a rotational mode of Earth's fluid core. Dissipative processes at the core-mantle boundary (CMB) dampen this resonance, contributing to the observed phase lag between tidal forcing and Earth's rotational response. This phase lag is commonly attributed to electromagnetic (EM) coupling between the core and the electrically conducting lower mantle. However, estimates of mantle conductivity and radial magnetic field strength at the CMB suggest these effects are insufficient. We show that the missing dissipation arises naturally from the excitation of internal waves in the fluid core by topographic features at the CMB. Adapting a theoretical framework originally developed for tidal flow over oceanic topography, we compute the form drag and associated power flux induced by CMB topography. Our results are consistent with a CMB topography characterized by a root mean square amplitude of a few kilometers. The model favors weak stratification at the top of the core, though stronger stratification remains compatible with increased topographic amplitude. This mechanism provides independent constraints on CMB topography and stratification, complementing seismological and magnetic observations. Its generality offers a new framework for probing deep-interior dynamics across terrestrial planets.

 - **Abstract**
 Hydrogen recombination lines (HRLs) are valuable diagnostics of the physical conditions in ionized regions around high-mass stars. Understanding their broadening mechanisms and intensity trends can provide insights into the densities, temperatures, and kinematics of HII regions. We investigate the properties of ionized gas around massive protostars by analyzing hydrogen recombination lines (H-alpha and H-beta) in the Q-band. Observations were conducted using the Yebes 40m radio telescope in the Q-band (30.5~50 GHz) toward six high-mass protostars selected from the SOMA Survey (G45.12+0.13, G45.47+0.05, G28.20-0.05, G35.20-0.74, G19.08-0.29, and G31.28+0.06). The line profiles were analyzed to assess broadening mechanisms, from which electron densities and temperatures were derived. We compared our results with Q-band data from the TianMa 65m Radio Telescope (TMRT) and ALMA Band 1 Science Verification observations of Orion KL. A total of eight H-alpha (n = 51 to 58) and ten H-beta (n = 64 to 73) lines were detected toward G45.12+0.13, G45.47+0.05, and G28.20-0.05, with non-detections in the other sources. Electron densities of \sim \mathrm{1\text{--}5 \times 10^{6}~cm^{-3}} and temperatures of 8000-10000 K were derived. Orion KL shows one order of magnitude lower electron density, but a similar temperature. Notably, G45.12 and G28.20 show increasing intensity with frequency for both H-alpha and H-beta, in contrast to the decreasing trend in Orion KL. The observed line widths indicate contributions from both thermal and dynamical broadening, suggesting high-temperature ionized gas affected by turbulence, outflows, rotation, or stellar winds. Pressure broadening may also play a minor role. The contrasting intensity trends likely reflect differences in local physical conditions or radiative transfer effects, warranting further study through higher-resolution observations and modeling.

 - **Abstract**
 IZw18 is one of the lowest-metallicity star-forming galaxies known at z$\sim$0, considered a unique local analogue of the first galaxies. The origin of its hard ionizing continuum, expected to be a common feature in the early Universe and traced by He\textsc{ii} emission lines, remains intensely debated and challenging to explain. Here we combine optical (GTC/MEGARA) and mid-infrared (JWST/MIRI) integral field spectroscopic observations for IZw18 to shed new light on the high-ionization phenomenon. This letter reports the first detection of the high-ionization [Ne\textsc{v}]14.32 $\mu$m line in IZw18. Its emission is spatially extended and coincident with the He\textsc{ii} peak, revealing the presence of highly energetic ionizing sources that surpass mechanisms previously proposed on the basis of He\textsc{ii} alone. Our kinematic studies highlight that the He\textsc{ii}$\lambda$4686-emitting gas displays higher velocity dispersions and a different velocity pattern compared to the H$\beta$ emission, suggesting the presence of energetic processes such as shocks or stellar-driven feedback. Additionally, integrated spectra show asymmetric blueshifted profiles in the He\textsc{ii}$\lambda$4686 line, possibly indicating \textbf{early-stage} stellar-driven outflows potentially facilitating future ionizing photon leakage. Our spatial analysis also reveals differences in structure between the emission of H$\beta$ and He\textsc{ii}$\lambda$4686, with the He\textsc{ii}$\lambda$4686 peak offset by a projected distance of 140 pc from the peak H$\beta$ emission. This indicates distinct locations for the most extreme ionizing sources compared to moderate ionizing sources. Our findings underscore the complex interplay of physical processes in extremely metal-poor environments with \textbf{high-ionized} gas, offering new insights into the conditions prevailing in the early galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper we revisit our spectropolarimetric and velocimetric analysis of the young M dwarf AU Mic based on data collected with SPIRou at the Canada-France-Hawaii telescope, over a monitoring period of 2041 d from 2019 to 2024. The longitudinal magnetic field, the small-scale magnetic field, and the differential temperature of AU Mic, derived from the unpolarized and circularly-polarized spectra, were clearly modulated with the stellar rotation period, with a pattern that evolved over time. The magnetic modeling with Zeeman-Doppler imaging provides a consistent description of the global field of AU Mic that agrees not only with the Least-Squares Deconvolved profiles of the circularly-polarized and unpolarized spectral lines, but also with the small-scale field measurements derived from the broadening of spectral lines, for each of the 11 subsets of the full data. We find that the large-scale field was mostly poloidal, with a dominant dipole component slightly tilted to the rotation axis which decreased from 1.4 to 1.1 kG before increasing at the end of the campaign. The average small-scale field followed a similar trend, decreasing from 2.8 to 2.6 kG then rising. The long-term magnetic evolution we report for AU Mic suggests that, if cyclic, the cycle period is significantly longer than 6 yr. From velocimetric data, we derived improved mass estimates for the two transiting planets, respectively equal to M_b = 6.3+2.5-1.8 M_earth and M_c = 11.6+3.3-2.7 M_earth, yielding very contrasting densities of 0.32+0.13-0.10 and 2.9+1.1-0.8 g/cm3, and a new 90% confidence upper limit of 4.9 M_earth for candidate planet d (period 12.7 d) suspected to induce the transit-timing variations of b and c. We also confirm our claim regarding candidate planet e orbiting with a period of 33.11+-0.06 d, albeit with a smaller mass of M_e = 21.1+5.4-4.3 M_earth.

 - **Abstract**
 We report in this paper circularly and linearly polarized observations of the young active M dwarfs AU Mic and EV Lac with the near-infrared SPIRou spectropolarimeter at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, collected from August to October 2023 over a few rotation cycles of both stars. Applying Least-Squares Deconvolution (LSD) to our spectra, we detected Zeeman signatures in circular (Stokes V) and linear (Stokes QU) polarization, and Zeeman broadening in unpolarized (Stokes I) LSD profiles, all exhibiting clear rotational modulation. Using the stellar surface tomographic technique of Zeeman-Doppler imaging on our sets of observations, along with a simple parametric description of how the small-scale and large-scale fields relate to each other, we recovered the magnetic topologies of AU Mic and EV Lac successively from LSD Stokes V, Stokes IV and Stokes IVQU profiles, to investigate how the reconstructed maps evolve as we provide more information, and ultimately infer reliable magnetic maps of both stars. We find that AU Mic hosts a fairly simple and mostly poloidal large-scale field aligned with the rotation axis within about 10deg, whereas that of EV Lac is more complex, stronger and less axisymmetric. Both stars feature intense small-scale fields, of about 4 kG for AU Mic and 6 kG for EV Lac when averaged over the whole stellar surface. Stokes QU Zeeman signatures allow one to reconstruct stellar magnetic fields more reliably, and are especially useful for stars with more complex fields and low vsini's like EV Lac.

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of magnetic fields observed on both astrophysical and cosmological scales is a compelling problem that has the potential to shed light on the early Universe. We analytically investigate inflationary magnetogenesis in scenarios where a brief departure from slow-roll inflation - akin to mechanisms proposed for primordial black hole formation - leads to enhanced magnetic field generation with a growing power spectrum. Focusing on the Ratra model, we derive an analytic bound on the growth of the magnetic field power spectrum in this context, showing that the spectral index can reach $d \ln {\cal P}_B / d \ln k = 4.75$ during the growth phase. This growth enables amplification from CMB-safe large-scale amplitudes to values of astrophysical relevance. We further compute the stochastic gravitational wave background sourced by the resulting magnetic fields, incorporating their rich spectral features. Under suitable conditions, the induced signal exhibits a characteristic frequency dependence and amplitude within reach of future gravitational wave observatories, providing a distinctive signature of this mechanism and a specific class of templates for upcoming gravitational wave searches.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy clusters, the pinnacle of structure formation in our universe, are a powerful cosmological probe. Several approaches have been proposed to express cluster number counts, but all these methods rely on empirical explicit scaling relations that link observed properties to the total cluster mass. These scaling relations are over-parametrised, inducing some degeneracy with cosmology. Moreover, they do not provide a direct handle on the numerous non-gravitational phenomena that affect the physics of the intra-cluster medium. We present a proof-of-concept to model cluster number counts, that bypasses the explicit use of scaling relations. We rather implement the effect of several astrophysical processes to describe the cluster properties. We then evaluate the performances of this modelling for the cosmological inference. We developed an accelerated machine learning baryonic field-emulator, built upon the Lagrangian Deep Learning method and trained on the CAMELS simulations. We then created a pipeline that simulates cluster counts in terms of XMM observable quantities. We finally compare the performances of our model, with that involving scaling relations, for the purpose of cosmological inference based on simulations. Our model correctly reproduces the cluster population from the calibration simulations at the fiducial parameter values, and allows us to constrain feedback mechanisms. The cosmological-inference analyses indicate that our simulation-based model is less degenerate than the approach using scaling relations. This novel approach to model observed cluster number counts from simulations opens interesting perspectives for cluster cosmology. It has the potential to overcome the limitations of the standard approach, provided that the resolution and the volume of the simulations will allow a most realistic implementation of the complex phenomena driving cluster evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the discovery of 30 transiting giant planets that were initially detected using data from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission. These new planets orbit relatively bright ($G \leq 12.5$) FGK host stars with orbital periods between 1.6 and 8.2 days, and have radii between 0.9 and 1.7 Jupiter radii. We performed follow-up ground-based photometry, high angular-resolution imaging, high-resolution spectroscopy and radial velocity monitoring for each of these objects to confirm that they are planets and determine their masses and other system parameters. The planets' masses span more than an order of magnitude ($0.17\,M_J < M_p < 3.3\,M_J$). For two planets, TOI-3593 b and TOI-4961 b, we measured significant non-zero eccentricities of $0.11^{+0.05}_{-0.03}$ and $0.18^{+0.04}_{-0.05}$ respectively, while for the other planets, the data typically provide a 1-$\sigma$ upper bound of 0.15 on the eccentricity. These discoveries represent a major step toward assembling a complete, magnitude-limited sample of transiting hot Jupiters around FGK stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar-gas kinematic misalignments are a transient phenomenon observed in $\sim11\%$ of the local galaxy population. According to current models, misaligned gas is expected to lose angular momentum and relax into the galactic plane on timescales of $\sim0.1$ Gyr, driving gas toward the central regions of the galaxy. Recent observational studies have found a higher incidence of active galactic nuclei in misaligned galaxies. We use the EAGLE simulation to explore the connection between stellar-gas misalignments and enhanced central black hole (BH) activity between $0<z<1$. We use a sample of $\sim5600$ galaxies with a stellar mass of $M_{*}\geqslant \mathrm{10^{9.5}}$ M$_\odot$ that feature long-lived stellar-gas alignment, counter-rotation, and unstable misalignments (non-coplanarity). Over time windows of $0.5$ Gyr, we find that galaxies experiencing an unstable misalignment have systematically enhanced BH growth during relaxation. Galaxies with long-term counter-rotation show little difference in BH growth compared to aligned galaxies. We suggest that this enhanced BH growth is driven by loss of angular momentum in unstable misaligned gas discs which is able to drive gas inward toward the vicinity of the BH. At $z\approx0.1$, we find a greater incidence of overmassive BHs in galaxies that have spent a greater fraction of time with unstable stellar-gas kinematic misalignments over the preceding $\approx2$ Gyr compared to control samples of aligned galaxies. In agreement with observations, we conclude that BH activity is enhanced in misaligned systems in EAGLE and suggest that the presence of overmassive BHs may be indicative of a past stellar-gas kinematic misalignment.

 - **Abstract**
 Using high spatiotemporal resolution, multi-wavelength observations from the New Vacuum Solar Telescope (NVST) and the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), we present a detailed analysis of a small-scale chromospheric jet driven by plasmoid-mediated magnetic reconnection. Our results reveal that the entire process is governed by the dynamic evolution of photospheric magnetic footpoints, which proceeds in two distinct stages. An initial separating motion of the footpoints corresponds to a mild reconnection phase, characterized by a short current sheet and the eruption of a cool H$\alpha$ jet. Subsequently, a converging motion of the footpoints triggers an intense reconnection phase. During this intense stage, the current sheet rapidly elongates, and the resulting decrease in its aspect ratio initiates a tearing-mode instability, forming a plasmoid. The appearance of this plasmoid mediates the onset of fast magnetic reconnection, which produces a hot EUV jet and is concurrent with significant magnetic flux cancellation. We interpret this cancellation as the submergence of newly formed, post-reconnection loops. Furthermore, we identify a distinct, high-temperature plasma blob in the jet spire, significantly hotter than the surrounding jet plasma. We attribute this feature to a secondary heating process, likely caused by reconnection between the upward-propagating plasmoid and the overlying magnetic cusp structure. These observations provide a comprehensive, observationally driven picture (from the initial photospheric triggers to the multi-stage, plasmoid-mediated reconnection) that forms chromospheric jets, highlighting the critical role of footpoint motions in solar atmospheric dynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 We present multi-wavelength imaging and analysis of a low surface brightness (LSB) dwarf galaxy in the Extended Chandra Deep Field South (ECDFS), SMDG0333094-280938, with particular emphasis on data from the Euclid space telescope and from the Vera C.\ Rubin Observatory. The galaxy is clumpy and blue, and appears to host globular clusters (GCs), suggesting a distance of ~50-60 Mpc which would make the dwarf an ultra-diffuse galaxy (UDG). We carry out spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting from the far-ultraviolet to the near-infrared, in order to estimate the galaxy age and metallicity. We infer a recent peak of star formation that may have led to the formation of the UDG through feedback-driven expansion. This early analysis illustrates how Euclid and Rubin are poised to identify and characterize many thousands of UDGs and other LSB galaxies in the near future, including their GCs and stellar populations.
#### ML-Driven Strong Lens Discoveries: Down to $θ_E \sim 0.03''$ and $M_\mathrm{halo}< 10^{11} M_\odot$

 - **Abstract**
 We present results on extending the strong lens discovery space down to much smaller Einstein radii ($\theta_E\lesssim0.03''$) and much lower halo mass ($M_\mathrm{halo}<10^{11}M_\odot$) through the combination of JWST observations and machine learning (ML) techniques. First, we forecast detectable strong lenses with JWST using CosmoDC2 as the lens catalog, and a source catalog down to 29th magnitude. By further incorporating the VELA hydrodynamical simulations of high-redshift galaxies, we simulate strong lenses. We train a ResNet on these images, achieving near-100\% completeness and purity for ``conventional" strong lenses ($\theta_E\gtrsim 0.5''$), applicable to JWST, HST, the Roman Space Telescope and Euclid VIS. For the first time, we also search for very low halo mass strong lenses ($M_{halo}<10^{11}M_\odot$) in simulations, with $\theta_E\ll 0.5''$, down to the best resolution ($0.03''$) and depth (10,000~sec) limits of JWST using ResNet. A U-Net model is employed to pinpoint these small lenses in images, which are otherwise virtually impossible for human detection. Our results indicate that JWST can find $\sim 17$/deg$^2$ such low-halo-mass lenses, with the locations of $\sim 1.1$/deg$^2$ of these detectable by the U-Net at $\sim100$\% precision (and $\sim 7.0$/deg$^2$ at a 99.0\% precision). To validate our model for finding ``conventional" strong lenses, we apply it to HST images, discovering two new strong lens candidates previously missed by human classifiers in a crowdsourcing project (Garvin et al. 2022). This study demonstrates the (potentially ``superhuman") advantages of ML combined with current and future space telescopes for detecting conventional, and especially, low-halo-mass strong lenses, which are critical for testing CDM models.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first optical-UV spectral systematic analysis of 30 Type 1 AGN selected in the FIR and X-ray in the Lockman-SpReSO Survey. The sample of faint objects (m_B = 19.6-21.8) covers a large redshift range of 0.33 > z > 4.97 with high S/N (~21 on average). A detailed spectral analysis based on the Quasar Main Sequence phenomenology prescription was applied to deblend the principal optical-UV emitting regions. Our sample spans a bolometric luminosity range of 44.85 < log Lbol < 47.87, absolute B-magnitude -20.46 > M_B > -26.14, BH mass of 7.59 < log MBH < 9.80, and Eddington ratio -1.70 < log REdd < 0.56. The analysis shows that 18 high-z objects correspond to Population B, whereas three low-z fall in Populations A2, B1, and B1+. The remaining eight are candidates to be Pop. B and one Pop. A object. None of them are extreme accretors. We looked for tendencies in our sample and compared them with other samples with different selection criteria. Evidence for winds was explored using CIV1549 line half-height centroid cmed finding wind velocities between 941 and -1587 kms-1. This result is consistent with samples with similar ranges of z and M_B. The Baldwin effect showed a slope of -0.23 pm 0.03 dex consistent with previous studies. Spectra from twelve objects in our sample were found in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 17 database. We applied the same methodology to compare them to our spectra, finding no evidence of variability.
