#### The Galactic Magnetic Field and UHECR Deflections

 - **Abstract**
 Ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) experience deflections as they traverse the Galactic magnetic field (GMF), which must be accounted for when tracing them back to their sources. After briefly summarizing our results on uncertainties in cosmic-ray deflections from the UF23 ensemble of GMF models (Unger & Farrar, 2024), we report a new preliminary fit of the GMF including foreground emission from the Local Bubble. This fit uses the analytic model of Pelgrims et al. (2024) for the magnetic field in the thick shell Galactic bubbles. We also discuss how variations in toroidal halo field modeling account for the key differences between the Jansson & Farrar (2012) GMF model and the UF23 ensemble. We also extend our previous analysis of the origin of the highest-energy "Amaterasu" event observed by the Telescope Array to include the four highest-energy events detected by the Pierre Auger Observatory. Amaterasu and PAO070114 are the UHECR events with the smallest localization uncertainties of 4.7% and 2.4%, respectively. Neither of their back-tracked directions aligns with any compelling candidate for a continuous UHECR accelerator. This strengthens the evidence that at least a fraction of the highest energy events originate from transient sources.
#### Addressing the core-cusp and diversity problem of dwarf and disk galaxies using cold collisionless DARKexp theory

 - **Abstract**
 Observed dwarf galaxies tend to have linearly rising rotation curves, which indicate flat density cores in their centers. Furthermore, disk galaxies show a wide range of rotation curves shapes. High resolution simulations of cold collisionless dark matter do not reproduce flat central profiles, or the observed diversity of rotation curve shapes; even hydrodynamic simulations incorporating baryonic feedback cannot do that robustly. However, numerical simulations are not the only way to make predictions about density profiles of equilibrium dark matter halos. A theoretical model based on statistical mechanics shows that maximum entropy solutions for cold collisionless self-gravitating dark matter halos can have a range of inner density profiles, including flat density cores. These theoretical profiles, called DARKexp, have only one shape parameter, and are able to fit the observed rotation curves of galaxies with last measured velocities in the range ~20-200 km/s. Here we present fits to 96 SPARC catalog galaxies, and the Milky Way. DARKexp also provides good fits to the projected stellar density distributions of ultrafaint dwarfs that show cores, suggesting that the dark matter halo hosts could have flat density cores. Thus, DARKexp appears to be able to address the core-cusp problem and the diversity of rotation curves with cold collisionless dark matter alone, without baryonic feedback.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, it was proposed that an off-center dipole magnetic configuration, together with a non-trivial temperature profile, may be the best model to explain the X-ray light curve of PSR J0030+0451 observed by the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (\emph{NICER}). Using a theoretical model for the electric current density in a force-free pulsar magnetosphere, we compute from first principles the distribution of electric current over the polar cap associated with an off-center magnetic dipole. We then use a simple prescription to compute the resulting temperature distribution, which allows us to derive the observed X-ray light curve. We investigate the role of the volumetric return current region in the polar cap and find that although it does not make a big difference in an aligned dipole case, the difference can be bigger in the case of an off-center dipole. Finally, we apply Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) fitting to the X-ray light curves of pulsars PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0437--4715 with and without the volumetric return current, and find that our model can reasonably recover the observed X-ray light curves.

 - **Abstract**
 The fourth flight of the Focusing Optics X-ray Solar Imager sounding rocket experiment (FOXSI-4) aimed to achieve the first imaging spectroscopic observations of mid-to-large class ( >= GOES C5 class) solar flares, in contrast to the previous three flights that targeted relatively quiet regions of the Sun. To meet the emerging requirements for hard X-ray focal plane detectors for providing simultaneous diagnostics of spectrally (<1 keV FWHM) and spatially (<50 um) separated coronal and chromospheric emissions from solar flares, we developed a new strip-configuration detector called the wide-gap CdTe semiconductor double-sided strip detector (CdTe-DSD). The wide-gap CdTe-DSD employs a unique design principle to enhance position resolution. This enhancement is realized by expanding the gaps between electrodes to induce charge-sharing across adjacent strip electrodes and using this sharing energy information for position reconstruction to a level finer than the strip-pitch. However, the detector response becomes complex and requires consideration of various factors, such as the charge loss due to wider gaps and the dependence on the depth of photon interaction. Thus, we developed an energy reconstruction method that fully leverages the energy information between adjacent strips and from both the cathode and anode sides, achieving an energy resolution of 0.75 keV (FWHM) at 14 keV. Furthermore, we conducted an X-ray scanning experiment using a synchrotron beam at Spring-8 to evaluate the detector response with a fine scale of 10 um. Based on these results, we established a sub-strip position reconstruction method, demonstrating that X-rays interacting at the center of the gap can be determined with an accuracy of 20 um, and even those at the strip center can be determined with an accuracy of 50 um.

 - **Abstract**
 Precise tracking and measurement of the energy carried by the individual magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modes has important implications and utility in astrophysical and laboratory plasmas. Previously, this was only achievable in limited linear MHD cases in the $\beta \ll 1$ or $\beta \gg 1$ regimes. In a series of papers, of which this is the third, we introduced the Eigenenergy Decomposition Method (EEDM) and derived exact analytical expressions for the modal energy components--called eigenenergies--of nonlinear 3D disturbances governed by the homogeneous ideal-MHD equations. Here, we extend the method to inhomogeneous ideal-MHD by introducing a source term accounting for gravity, and provide detailed guidelines for applying the decomposition scheme to any general inhomogeneous quasi-linear PDEs that possess a globally conserved quantity, beyond the realm of MHD. Furthermore, we show that the eigenenergies can be used to locate and measure nonlinear mode conversions, which is an additional feature of the method. Finally, we provide well-categorized context for the application of the method to simulations and discuss the possible numerical inaccuracies that may inevitably arise due to discretization. This paper provides a more mature description of the method and its interpretation, and is recommended as the starting point for readers unfamiliar with the method.

 - **Abstract**
 The distribution and physical conditions of molecular gas are closely linked to star formation and the subsequent evolution of galaxies. Emission from carbon monoxide (CO) and its isotopologues traces the bulk of molecular gas and provides constraints on the physical conditions through their line ratios. However, comprehensive understanding on how the particular choice of line modeling approach impacts derived molecular properties remain incomplete. Here, we study the nearby starburst galaxy M82, known for its intense star formation and molecular emission, using the large set of available multi-CO line observations. We present high-resolution (${\sim}85$ pc) emission of seven CO isotopologue lines, including $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, and C$^{18}$O from the $J = 1-0$, $2-1$ and $3-2$ transitions. Using \texttt{RADEX} for radiative transfer modeling, we analyze M82\textsc{\char39}s molecular properties with (i) a one-zone model and (ii) a variable density model, comparing observed and simulated emissions via a minimum $\chi^2$ analysis. We find that inferred gas conditions -- kinetic temperature and density -- are consistent across models, with minimal statistical differences. However, due to their low critical densities (${<}10^{4}$ cm$^{-3}$), low-$J$ CO isotopologue lines do not effectively probe higher density gas prevalent in starburst environments like that of M82. Our results further imply that this limitation extends to high-redshift ($z{\gtrapprox}1$) galaxies with similar conditions, where low-$J$ CO lines are inadequate for density constraints. Future studies of extreme star-forming regions like M82 will require higher-$J$ CO lines or alternative molecular tracers with higher critical densities.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery and characterization of ZTF J0112+5827, a new magnetic cataclysmic variable with an orbital period of 80.9 minutes. ROSAT observations revealed X-ray emission with an average flux of $(68.4 \pm 15.7) \times 10^{-14}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ (0.1--2.4 keV). The ZTF light curves show ellipsoidal-like variability in the $g$ band and two prominent humps at phases $\sim$0.0 and $\sim$0.7 in $i$ and $r$ bands. Spectroscopic observations with the Palomar 200-inch telescope revealed cyclotron emission features and strong He II and Balmer emission lines. Doppler tomography shows clear accretion streams with line-of-sight velocities of $\sim$500 km s$^{-1}$, but no accretion disk. Analysis of cyclotron harmonics indicates a magnetic field strength of $38.7^{+1.3}_{-1.1}$ MG, confirming ZTF J0112+5827 as a polar system containing a strongly magnetic white dwarf.

 - **Abstract**
 In this manuscript, we investigate observational correlations between the properties of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) across the gamma, X-ray, and optical bands during the prompt and plateau phases of their light curves (LCs). Our analysis includes all GRBs with known redshifts detected by the Neil Gehrels {\it Swift} Observatory ({\it Swift}) and the {\it Fermi} Gamma-ray Space Telescope ({\it Fermi}), as well as ground-based optical telescopes. We identify a tight correlation with the $R^2$ coefficient of $\sim 0.89$ for the three-dimensional Dainotti relation between the luminosity at the end of the plateau, its duration measured by {\it Swift}, and the peak luminosity measured by {\it Fermi} in the 10-1000 keV band. When accounting for redshift evolution, we achieve very small intrinsic scatter $\sigma_{int}=0.25\pm0.04$ ($\sim 43\%$ reduction compared to the previous results). Additionally, we explore correlations involving the optical luminosity at the end of the plateau, yielding promising results. We investigate the clustering of different classes of GRBs in the investigated parameter space and discuss its impact on the correlations. Finally, we discuss the theory supporting the evidence of the plateau emission. We present a new paradigm for the GRB plateau: energy extraction from a quickly rotating black hole via spin-down by a magnetically arrested disk. We compare this model with observations and explain multiple observed features. We predict the plateau luminosity - time anti-correlation and discuss the cosmological evolution within this proposed model. Furthermore, within this new model, we discuss the possible physical origin of the clustering of long and short GRBs in the parameter space of plateau luminosity - time - prompt luminosity.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Trojan asteroids of Mars date from an early phase of solar system evolution. Based on a sample of <10 asteroids, MT distribution has been previously shown to be both asymmetric and inhomogeneous with population evolution dominated by thermal radiation forces acting over timescales of Gyr. Remarkably, a single asteroid family associated with (5261) Eureka (H~16) at L5 contains most MTs and all members of the stable population fainter than H=18. Aims. Using the currently available sample of MTs and their orbits, we take a fresh look at this population to re-evaluate these earlier conclusions and to search for additional features diagnostic of the evolutionary history of MTs and the Eureka family in particular. Methods. We perform harmonic analysis on numerical time series of the osculating elements to compile a new proper element catalogue comprising 16 L5 and 1 L4 Mars Trojan asteroids. We then combine sample variance analysis with statistical hypothesis testing to identify clusters in the distribution of orbits and assess their significance. Results. We identify two small clusterings significant at 95% confidence of three H=20-21 asteroids each and investigate their likely origin. One of the clusters is probably the result of rotational breakup of a Eureka family asteroid ~10^8 yr ago. The significantly higher tadpole libration width of asteroids in the other cluster is more consistent with an origin as impact ejecta from Eureka itself and on a timescale comparable to the ~1 Gyr age of its family. We further confirm the previously reported correlations in Eureka family orbital distribution attributed to the long-term action of radiation-driven forces and torques on the asteroids.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze JWST NIRSpec+MIRI/MRS observations of the infrared (IR) Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) features in the central regions ($\sim$0.26'' at 6 micron; $\sim$50-440 pc depending on the source) of local luminous IR galaxies. In this work, we examine the effect of nuclear obscuration on the PAH features of deeply obscured nuclei, predominantly found in local luminous IR galaxies, and we compare these nuclei with ``normal'' star-forming regions. We extend previous work to include shorter wavelength PAH ratios now available with the NIRSpec+MIRI/MRS spectral range. We introduce a new diagnostic diagram for selecting deeply obscured nuclei based on the 3.3 and 6.2 micron PAH features and/or mid-IR continuum ratios at $\sim$3 and 5 micron. We find that the PAH equivalent width (EW) ratio of the brightest PAH features at shorter wavelengths (at 3.3 and 6.2 micron) is impacted by nuclear obscuration. Although the sample of luminous IR galaxies used in this analysis is relatively small, we find that sources exhibiting a high silicate absorption feature cluster tightly in a specific region of the diagram, whereas star-forming regions experiencing lower extinction levels occupy a different area in the diagram. This demonstrates the potential of this technique to identify buried nuclei. To leverage the excellent sensitivity of the MIRI imager onboard JWST, we extend our method of identifying deeply obscured nuclei at higher redshifts using a selection of MIRI filters. Specifically, the combination of various MIRI JWST filters enables the identification of buried sources beyond the local Universe and up to z$\sim$3, where other commonly used obscuration tracers such as the 9.7 micron silicate band, are out of the spectral range of MRS. Our results pave the way for identifying distant deeply obscured nuclei with JWST.
#### Bursty acceleration and 3D trajectories of electrons in a solar flare

 - **Abstract**
 During a solar flare, electrons are accelerated to non-thermal energies as a result of magnetic reconnection. These electrons then propagate upwards and downwards from the energy release site along magnetic field lines and produce radio and X-ray emission. On 11 November 2022, an M5.1 solar flare was observed by the Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX) on board Solar Orbiter together with various ground- and space-based radio instruments. The flare was associated with several fine hard X-ray (HXR) structures and a complex set of metric radio bursts (type III, J, and narrowband). By studying the evolution of X-ray, extreme ultraviolet, and radio sources, we aim to study the trajectories of the flare-accelerated electrons in the lower solar atmosphere and low corona. We used observations from the STIX on board Solar Orbiter to study the evolution of X-ray sources. Using radio imaging from the Nançay Radio heliograph (NRH) and the Newkirk density model, we constructed 3D trajectories of 14 radio bursts. Imaging of the HXR fine structures shows several sources at different times. The STIX and NRH imaging shows correlated changes in the location of the HXR and radio source at the highest frequency during the most intense impulsive period. Imaging and 3D trajectories of all the bursts show that electrons are getting accelerated at different locations and along several distinct field lines. The longitude and latitude extent of the trajectories are ~30 arcsec and ~ 152 arcsec. We find that the electrons producing HXR and radio emission have similar acceleration origins. Importantly, our study supports the scenario that the flare acceleration process is temporally and spatially fragmentary, and during each of these small-scale processes, the electron beams are injected into a very fibrous environment and produce complex HXR and radio emission.

 - **Abstract**
 In the current galaxy formation paradigm, collisions play a crucial role. A fraction of galaxy collisions results in flyby events, and a galaxy that has passed through another galaxy is called a backsplash galaxy. Such flyby events are of particular interest for explaining the quenching of isolated galaxies. One signature of backsplash galaxies is that they have high velocities relative to their environment, since they do not move in the same flow as surrounding galaxies. This feature can be studied in simulations, but it is also useful to have a theory that can predict the velocities of backsplash galaxies. In this paper, we develop such a theory based on the Zel'dovich approximation and use it to determine the maximal expected velocity of a backsplash galaxy in a given volume.
#### On the diversification and dissipation of protoplanetary disks

 - **Abstract**
 Protoplanetary disk evolution exhibits trends with stellar mass as well as diversity of structure and lifetime, with implications for planet formation and demographics. We show how varied outcomes can result from evolving structures in the inner disk that attenuate stellar soft X-rays that otherwise drive photoevaporation in the outer disk. The magnetic truncation of the disk around a rapidly rotating T Tauri star is initially exterior to the co-rotation radius and``propeller" accretion is accompanied by an inner magnetized wind, shielding the disk from X-rays. Stellar contraction while rotation is ``locked" to the disk causes the truncation radius to migrate interior to the co-rotation radius, the inner wind to disappear, and photoevaporation to erode a gap in the disk, accelerating its dissipation. This X-ray attenuation scenario explains the trend of longer lifetime, reduced structure and compact size of disks around lower-mass stars. It also explains an observed lower bound and scatter in the distribution of disk accretion rates. Disks that experience early photoevaporation and form gaps can efficiently trap solids at a pressure bump at 1--10 au, triggering giant planet formation, while those with later-forming or no gaps form multiple smaller planets on close-in orbits, a pattern consistent with observed exoplanet demographics.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Substellar objects, including brown dwarfs and free-floating planetary-mass objects, are a significant product of star formation. Their sensitivity to initial conditions and early dynamical evolution makes them especially valuable for studying both planetary and stellar formation processes. Aims. We search for brown dwarfs and isolated planetary mass objects in a young star forming region to better constrain their formation mechanisms. Methods. We take advantage of Euclid unprecedented sensitivity, spatial resolution and wide-field of view to search for brown dwarfs and free-floating planetary mass objects in the LDN 1495 region of the Taurus molecular clouds. We combine the recent Euclid Early Release Observations with older very deep ground-based images obtained over more than 20 yr to derive proper motions and multi-wavelength photometry, and select members based on their morphology and their position in a proper motion diagram and in 9 color-magnitude diagrams. Results. We identify 15 point sources with proper motions, colors, and luminosity consistent with being members of LDN 1495. Six of these objects were already known M9-L1 members. The remaining nine are newly identified sources that could have spectral types ranging from late-M to early-T with masses potentially as low as 1-2 MJup based on their luminosity and according to evolutionary models. However, follow-up observations are needed to confirm their nature, spectral type and membership. If extrapolated to theentire Taurus star forming region, this result suggests the potential presence of several dozen free-floating planetary mass objects.

 - **Abstract**
 Dense cores in massive, parsec-scale molecular clumps are sites that harbor protocluster formation. We present results from observations towards a hub-filament structure of a massive Infrared Dark Cloud (IRDC) G14.225-0.506 using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The dense cores are revealed by the 1.3 mm dust continuum emission at an angular resolution of $\sim$ 1.5'' and are identified through the hierarchical Dendrogram technique. Combining with the N$_2$D$^+$ 3-2 spectral line emission and gas temperatures derived from a previous NH$_3$ study, we analyze the thermodynamic properties of the dense cores. The results show transonic and supersonic-dominated turbulent motions. There is an inverse correlation between the virial parameter and the column density, which implies that denser regions may undergo stronger gravitational collapse. Molecular outflows are identified in the CO 2-1 and SiO 5-4 emission, indicating active protostellar activities in some cores. Besides these star formation signatures revealed by molecular outflows in the dense cores, previous studies in the infrared, X-ray, and radio wavelengths also found a rich and wide-spread population of young stellar objects (YSOs), showing active star formation both inside and outside of the dense cloud.

 - **Abstract**
 The apparent slipping motion of flare loops is regarded as a key feature of the 3D magnetic reconnection in the solar flares. The slippage with a super-Alfvénic speed could be defined as slipping-running reconnection while the slippage with a sub-Alfvénic speed is called slipping reconnection. Due to the limitation of the observational instrument temporal resolution, the apparent slippage of the flare loop footpoints along the flare ribbons with super-Alfvénic speed is quite rare to our knowledge. In this paper, we report a unique event that exhibits not only the sub-Alfvénic slippage, but also the quasiperiodic super-Alfvénic slippage of ribbon substructures during a C3.4-class flare (SOL2023-01-18-T15:23), using the high temporal resolution observations of the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph ($\sim$2 s). The super-Alfvénic slippage with a speed of up to $\sim$ 1688 km s$^{-1}$ is directly observed in this study. The calculated period of the apparent super-Alfvénic slippage in both ribbons is between 8.4 and 11.9 seconds. This work provides the first observational evidence of the periodicity for the slipping-running magnetic reconnection.

 - **Abstract**
 The non-detection of periodicity related to rotation challenges the magnetar model for fast radio bursts (FRBs). Moreover, a bimodal distribution of the burst waiting times is widely observed in hyper-active FRBs, a significant deviation from the exponential distribution expected from stationary Poisson processes. By combining the epidemic-type aftershock sequence (ETAS) earthquake model and the rotating vector model (RVM) involving the rotation of the magnetar and orientations of the spin and magnetic axes, we find that starquake events modulated by the rotation of FRB-emitting magnetar can explain the bimodal distribution of FRB waiting times, as well as the non-detection of periodicity in active repeating FRBs. We analyze data from multiple FRB sources, demonstrating that differences in waiting time distributions and observed energies can be explained by varying parameters related to magnetar properties and starquake dynamics. Our results suggest that rotation-modulated starquakes on magnetars can possibly be a unified source for FRBs. Notably, we find that active repeaters tend to have small magnetic inclination angles in order to hide their periodicity. We also show that our model can reproduce the waiting time distribution of a pulsar phase of the galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154 with a larger inclination angle than the active repeaters, which could explain the detection of spin period and the relatively low observed energy for FRBs from the magnetar. The spin periods of active repeaters are not well constrained, but most likely fall in the valley region between the two peaks of the waiting time distributions.

 - **Abstract**
 We use FUV spectra of 36 T Tauri stars, predominately from $\textit{Hubble Space Telescope}$'s ULLYSES program, to examine the kinematic properties of fluorescent H$_2$ emission lines for evidence of disk outflows. Leveraging improvements to the $\textit{HST}$-COS wavelength solution, we co-add isolated lines within four fluorescent progressions ([$\textit{v'}$,$\textit{J'}$] = [1,4], [1,7], [0,2], and [3,16]) to improve signal-to-noise, and we fit each co-added line profile with one or two Gaussian components. Of the high S/N line profiles (S/N $\geq$ 12 at the peak of the profile), over half are best fit with a combination of a broad and narrow Gaussian component. For profiles of the [1,4] and [1,7] progressions, we find a systematic blue-shift of a few km s$^{-1}$ between the broad and narrow centroid velocities and stellar radial velocities. For the [0,2] progression, we find centroid velocities consistently blueshifted with respect to stellar radial velocities on the order of -5 km s$^{-1}$ for the single and narrow components, and -10 km s$^{-1}$ for the broad components. Overall, the blueshifts observed in our sample suggest that the molecular gas traces an outflow from a disk wind in some sources, and not solely disk gas in Keplerian rotation. The low-velocity systematic blue-shifts, and emitting radii as inferred from line FWHMs, observed in our sample are similar to those observed with optical [O I] surveys of T Tauri stars. We estimate H$_2$ mass-loss rates of 10$^{-9}$ to 10$^{-11}$ $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, but incomplete knowledge of wind parameters limits comparisons to global models.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the potential bias in the identification of fast radio burst (FRB) host galaxies due to radio localisation uncertainty. Using a sample of FRBs localised to typically 0.5'' by the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP), we artificially increase the localisation uncertainty up to 10'', and re-run the Probabalistic Association of Transients to their Hosts (PATH) algorithm to determine the most likely host galaxy. We do not find evidence of a significant change in identified hosts until the localisation precision is worsened to 2'' or greater.

 - **Abstract**
 Image denoising based on deep learning has witnessed significant advancements in recent years. However, existing deep learning methods lack quantitative control of the deviation or error on denoised images. The neural networks Self2Self is designed for denoising single-image, training on it and denoising itself, during which training is costly. In this work we explore training Self2Self on an astronomical image and denoising other images of the same kind, which is suitable for quickly denoising massive images in astronomy. To address the deviation issue, the abnormal pixels whose deviation exceeds a predefined threshold are restored to their initial values. The noise reduction includes training, denoising, restoring and named TDR-method, by which the noise level of the solar magnetograms is improved from about 8 G to 2 G. Furthermore, the TDR-method is applied to galaxy images from the Hubble Space Telescope and makes weak galaxy structures become much clearer. This capability of enhancing weak signals makes the TDR-method applicable in various disciplines.

 - **Abstract**
 We examine the effects of thermal conduction on relativistic, magnetized, viscous, advective accretion flows around rotating black holes considering bremsstrahlung and synchrotron cooling processes. Assuming the toroidal component of magnetic fields as the dominant one, we self-consistently solve the steady-state fluid equations to derive the global transonic accretion solutions for a black hole of spin $a_{\rm k}$. Depending on the model parameters, the magnetized accretion flow undergoes shock transitions and shock-induced global accretion solutions persist over a wide range of model parameters including the conduction parameter ($\Upsilon_{\rm s}$), plasma-$\beta$, and viscosity parameter ($\alpha_{\rm B}$). We find that the shock properties -- such as shock radius ($r_{\rm s}$), compression ratio ($R$), and shock strength ($S$) -- are regulated by $\Upsilon_{\rm s}$, plasma $\beta$, and $\alpha_{\rm B}$. Furthermore, we compute the critical conduction parameter ($\Upsilon_{\rm s}^{\rm cri}$), a threshold beyond which shock formation ceases to exist, and investigate its dependence on plasma-$\beta$ and $\alpha_{\rm B}$ for both weakly rotating ($a_{\rm k} \rightarrow 0$) and rapidly rotating ($a_{\rm k} \rightarrow 1$) black holes. Finally, we examine the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the accretion disc and observe that increased thermal conduction and magnetic field strength lead to more luminous emission spectra from black hole sources.

 - **Abstract**
 HSC 120505.09-000027.9 (J1205$-$0000) is one of the highest redshift ($z=6.72$) dust-reddened quasars (red quasars) known to date. We present an improved analysis of Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array data of the [CII] $158\ \rm{\mu m}$ line and the underlying rest-frame far-infrared (FIR) continuum emission, previously reported in Izumi et al. (2021a), toward J1205$-$0000. Red quasars are thought to be a transitional phase from an obscured starburst to a luminous blue quasar, in some cases associated with massive outflows driven by the active galactic nucleus (AGN). J1205$-$0000 has a high FIR luminosity, $L_{\mathrm{FIR}}=2.5\times 10^{12}\ L_{\odot}$ and a total IR luminosity of $L_{\mathrm{TIR}}=3.5\times 10^{12}\ L_{\odot}$, corresponding to a star formation rate (SFR) of $\sim 528\ M_{\odot}\ \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. With the [CII]-based dynamical mass of $\sim 1 \times 10^{11}~M_\odot$, we conclude that J1205$-$0000 is hosted by a starburst galaxy. In contradiction to Izumi et al. (2021a), our improved analysis shows no hint of a broad component in the [CII] line spectrum. Thus there is no evidence for a host galaxy-scale fast [CII] outflow, despite the fact that J1205$-$0000 has fast nuclear ionized outflows seen in the rest-frame UV. We explore several scenarios for this discrepancy (e.g., early phase of AGN feedback, reliability of the [CII] line as a tracer of outflows), and we claim that it is still too early to conclude that there is no significant negative AGN feedback on star formation in this red quasar.

 - **Abstract**
 Jets emanating from active galactic nuclei (AGN) represent some of the most formidable particle accelerators in the universe, thereby emerging as viable candidates responsible for the detection of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). If AGN jets indeed serve as origins of UHECRs, then the diffuse flux of these cosmic rays would be dependent on the power and duty cycle of these jets, which are inherently connected to the nature of black hole accretion flows. In this article, we present our cosmological semi-analytic framework, JET(Jets from Early Times), designed to trace the evolution of jetted AGN populations. This framework serves as a valuable tool for predictive analyses of cosmic ray energy density and, potentially, neutrino energy density. By using JET, we model the formation and evolution of galaxies and supermassive black holes (SMBHs) from z = 20 to z = 1, incorporating jet formation and feedback mechanisms and distinguishing between various accretion states determined by the SMBH Eddington ratios. The implications of different SMBH growth models on predicting cosmic ray flux are investigated. We provide illustrative examples demonstrating how the associated diffuse UHECR fluxes at the source may vary in relation to the jet production efficiencies and the selected SMBH growth model, linking cosmological models of SMBH growth with astroparticle backgrounds.
#### FEASTS Combined with Interferometry (IV): Mapping HI Emission to a limit of $N_{\text{HI}}=10^{17.7} \text{cm}^{-2}$ in Seven Edge-on Galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 We present a statistical study of the neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) gas extending into the circumgalactic medium perpendicular to the disk for 7 edge-on galaxies with inclinations above $85^{\circ}$ from the FEASTS program with a $3\sigma$ ($20\,\text{km}\,\text{s}^{-1}$) column density ($N_{\text{HI}}$) depth of $5\times10^{17} \text{cm}^{-2}$. We develop two photometric methods to separate the extraplanar HI from the disk component, based on existing interferometric data and parametric modeling of the disk flux distribution respectively. With both methods, the FEASTS data exhibit clear extended wings beyond the disk along the minor axis. The extraplanar HI accounts for 5% to 20% of the total HI mass and extends to $20\text{-}50$ kpc at $N_{\text{HI}}=10^{18} \text{cm}^{-2}$. We find a tight positive correlation between vertical extensions of the extraplanar HI and total HI mass $M_\text{HI}$. The iso-density shape of HI at $N_{\text{HI}}=10^{18} \text{cm}^{-2}$ has an average axis ratio of $0.56\pm0.11$. The off-disk $N_{\text{HI}}$ profiles of these edge-on galaxies well represent the lower envelop of previous Lyman-$\alpha$ absorption measurements at low-redshift. Our results suggest that at $N_{\text{HI}}=5\times10^{17} \text{cm}^{-2}$, the HI extends considerably further than the known thin and thick disks in the vertical direction, but still remains much flattener than a spherical distribution, consistent with theoretical expectations that outflow, circulation, and accretion should have different impacts in these two directions. We show the tension of our results with Illustris and TNG predictions, highlighting the constraining power of our results for future simulations.
#### Overall Ultra-high Energy Neutrino Emission from GRBs during Jet Expansion

 - **Abstract**
 The ultra-relativistic jet released in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is expected to produce ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs), prompt gamma-ray emission and hence prompt high-energy neutrinos by photopion interactions. In this work, we calculate the time-integrated neutrino spectrum during the expansion of jets by taking into account the time evolution of cosmic ray and secondary spectra and neutrino production. We numerically solve the continuity equations for nucleons, pions, and muons for their spectral evolution. Since pion and muon damping weakens as the jet expands, the neutrino production at large radii at high energies may dominate that around the jet energy dissipation radius. Compared with the usually adopted approaches that only consider neutrino production around the energy dissipation radius, the overall UHE neutrino fluence integrated over time can be significantly larger, and the flavor fraction of electron neutrinos as function of neutrino energy is different at UHE, due to neutrino production at radii much larger than the energy dissipation radius. The faster magnetic field decay leads to larger UHE neutrino fluence, and the UHE neutrino spectra is weakly dependent on the energy dissipation radius and the jet Lorentz factor. Observations of prompt EeV neutrinos from GRBs by the next-generation neutrino telescopes, e.g., GRAND and IceCube-Gen2, will test the hypothesis of GRBs as UHECR sources and probe the physics of GRB jets.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the occurrence of accretion bursts, dust accumulation, and the prospects for planetesimal formation in a gravitationally unstable magnetized protoplanetary disk with globally suppressed but episodically triggered magnetorotational instability (MRI), particularly in young intermediate-mass stars (YIMSs) but with a brief comparison to low-mass counterparts. We use numerical magnetohydrodynamics simulations in the thin-disk limit (FEOSAD code) to model the formation and long-term evolution of a gravitationally unstable magnetized protoplanetary disk, including dust dynamics and growth, since the collapse of a massive slowly-rotating prestellar cloud core. Massive gas concentrations and dust rings form within the inner disk region owing to the radially varying efficiency of mass transport by gravitational instability (GI). These rings are initially susceptible to streaming instability (SI). However, gradual warming of the dust rings, thanks to high opacity and GI-induced influx of matter increases the gas temperature above a threshold for the MRI to develop via thermal ionization of alkaline metals. The ensuing MRI bursts destroy the dust rings, making planetesimal formation via SI problematic. In the later evolution phase, when the burst activity starts to diminish, SI becomes inefficient because of growing dust drift velocity and more extended inner dead zone, both acting to reduce the dust concentration below the threshold for SI to develop. Low-mass objects appear to be less affected by these adverse effects. Our results suggest that disks around young intermediate-mass stars may be challenging environments for planetesimal formation via SI. This may explain the dearth of planets around stars with $M_\ast > 3.0 \,$$M_\odot$.
#### Unbiased estimates of the shapes of haloes using the positions of satellite galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 The shapes of dark matter haloes are sensitive to both cosmology and baryon physics, but are difficult to measure observationally. A promising way to constrain them is to use the positions of satellite galaxies as tracers of the underlying dark matter, but there are typically too few galaxies per halo for reliable shape estimates, resulting in biased shapes. We present a method to model sampling noise to correct for the shape bias. We compare our predicted median shape bias with that obtained from the FLAMINGO suite of simulations and find reasonable agreement. We check that our results are robust to resolution effects and baryonic feedback. We also explore the validity of our bias correction at various redshifts and we discuss how our method might be applied to observations in the future. We show that median projected halo axis ratios are on average biased low by 0.31 when they are traced by only 5 satellites. Using the satellite galaxies, the projected host halo axis ratio can be corrected with a residual bias of ~ 0.1, by accounting for sampling bias. Hence, about two-thirds of the projected axis ratio bias can be explained by sampling noise. This enables the statistical measurement of halo shapes at lower masses than previously possible. Our method will also allow improved estimates of halo shapes in cosmological simulations using fewer particles than currently required.

 - **Abstract**
 High-velocity clouds (HVCs) in the Galactic center have garnered significant attention due to their mysterious formation, potentially linked to starburst events or supermassive black hole activity in the region. However, it remains challenging to explain the observed column density and velocity distribution of HVCs. The discovery of high-velocity molecular clouds (HVMCs), which are denser and more massive, adds to this complexity. To address this, we conduct three-dimensional numerical simulations to explore the origin and magneto-hydrodynamic evolution of HVCs in the context of a starburst in the Galactic center. By incorporating magnetic fields and an initial tangential velocity for the clouds, our simulation results align with the observed properties of HVCs, supporting the notion that these clouds can originate from a starburst process. In addition, ~5% of the total mass of initial clouds can survive after 3.5 Myr, as a result, the following star formation will be more efficient than a feedback process that destroys all cool clouds.

 - **Abstract**
 Henrietta Swan Leavitt's discovery of the relationship between the period and luminosity (hereafter the Leavitt Law) of 25 variable stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud, published in 1912, revolutionized cosmology. These variables, eventually identified as Cepheids, became the first known "standard candles" for measuring extragalactic distances and remain the gold standard for this task today. Leavitt measured light curves, periods, and minimum and maximum magnitudes from painstaking visual inspection of photographic plates. Her work paved the way for the first precise series of distance measurements that helped set the scale of the Universe, and later the discovery of its expansion by Edwin Hubble in 1929. Here, we re-analyze Leavitt's first Period-Luminosity relation using observations of the same set of stars but with modern data and methods of Cepheid analysis. Using only data from Leavitt's notebooks, we assess the quality of her light curves, measured periods, and the slope and scatter of her Period-Luminosity relations. We show that modern data and methods, for the same objects, reduce the scatter of the Period-Luminosity relation by a factor of two. We also find a bias brightward at the short period end, due to the non-linearity of the plates and environmental crowding. Overall, Leavitt's results are in excellent agreement with contemporary measurements, reinforcing the value of Cepheids in cosmology today, a testament to the enduring quality of her work.
