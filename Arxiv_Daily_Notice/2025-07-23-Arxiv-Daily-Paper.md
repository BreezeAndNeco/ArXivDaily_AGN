 - **Abstract**
 A significant fraction of, and possibly all, stars form in binary or multiple systems. For Solar-mass stars in the Galactic field, the distribution of orbital separations is log-normal over seven orders of magnitude, from $10^{-2} - 10^5$ au. In contrast, the separation distributions of systems in nearby star-forming regions paints a much more confusing picture. There appears to be an excess of systems in the separation range 10 - 1000 au, and recent high-resolution spectroscopic observations of close (<10 au) systems suggest a field-like distribution in some star-forming regions, but a possible excess with respect to the field in other regions. Furthermore, the resolution limit of numerical simulations of binary star formation is $\sim$1\,au, and consequently comparisons with the binary distributions in star-forming regions and in the field are restricted. In this paper, we demonstrate that these observational uncertainties, and limitations in the simulations, are potentially a much bigger problem than previously realised. We show that the log-normal separation distribution in the field can be reproduced by combining constituent binary populations whose initial separation distributions have a very different form to a log-normal. We also argue that the observed excess of binaries in the range 10 - 62 au in the ONC compared to the Galactic field is not necessarily inconsistent with the field population, because the ONC is only one of many star-forming regions that populate the field. We propose that further observations of spectroscopic binaries in star-forming regions to probe and complete the <10 au parameter space are urgently needed.

 - **Abstract**
 By comparing Cepheid brightnesses with geometric distance measures including Gaia EDR3 parallaxes, most recent analyses conclude metal-rich Cepheids are brighter, quantified as $\gamma \sim -0.2$ mag/dex. While the value of $\gamma$ has little impact on the determination of the Hubble constant in contemporary distance ladders (due to the similarity of metallicity across these ladders), $\gamma$ plays a role in gauging the distances to metal-poor dwarf galaxies like the Magellanic Clouds and is of considerable interest in testing stellar models. Recently, Madore & Freedman (2025, hereafter MF25) recalibrated Gaia EDR3 parallaxes by adding to them a magnitude offset to match certain historic Cepheid parallaxes which otherwise differ by $\sim1.6\sigma$. A calibration which adjusts Gaia parallaxes by applying a magnitude offset (i.e., a multiplicative correction in parallax) differs significantly from the Gaia Team's calibration (Lindegren et al. 2021), which is additive in parallax space - especially at distances much closer than 1 kpc or beyond 10 kpc, outside the $\sim$2-3 kpc range on which the MF25 calibration was based. The MF25 approach reduces $\gamma$ to zero. If extrapolated, it places nearby cluster distances like the Pleiades too close compared to independent measurements, while leaving distant quasars with negative parallaxes. Further, by shortening the Milky Way distance scale, the MF25 calibration raises the local Hubble constant by $\sim$1 km/s/Mpc, increasing the Hubble tension significantly. We conclude that the MF25 proposal for Gaia calibration and $\gamma \sim 0$ produces farther-reaching consequences, many of which are strongly disfavored by the data.

 - **Abstract**
 The dominant formation channel of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) has been extensively studied for many years. Several hypervelocity white dwarfs (HVWDs) with space velocities of $\gtrsim 1000\,\mathrm{kms}^{-1}$ have recently been discovered. One possible origin of these stars is the dynamically-driven double-degenerate double-detonation (D6) scenario, in which an accreting sub-Chandrasekhar mass carbon-oxygen (CO) WD detonates as a SN Ia. In this scenario, the less massive WD may survive its companion's detonation and be ejected as a HVWD. Most of the observed HVWDs are hotter and puffier than normal WDs, perhaps due to their recent proximity to a SN. In this work, we test whether these properties can be explained by long-lived stable carbon (C) burning in the interiors of CO WD donors triggered by a SN shock. We model the long-term evolution of CO WDs following rapid energy injection using 1D models. We find that stable C burning can be ignited in CO WDs with masses of $0.95 - 1.10\,M_{\odot}$ if SN energy penetrates sufficiently deeply. The resulting born-again stars settle on the C-burning main sequence while they convert their interiors from C and O to Ne and Mg, where they have temperatures and radii similar to some of the observed HVWDs. However, the timescale over which C-burning WDs remain inflated is $\lesssim 10^5\,$yr, which is at least an order of magnitude shorter than the kinematic ages of observed hot HVWDs. We conclude that observed HVWDs are unlikely to be inflated by C burning. The stellar evolution of observed HVWDs remains an open problem.

 - **Abstract**
 The extreme-ultraviolet (EUV; 100 -- 911 Å) spectra of F, G, K, and M stars provide diagnostics of the stellar chromosphere through the corona, with line and continuum formation temperatures spanning roughly 10$^{4}$ - 10$^{7}$ K. The EUV stellar spectrum in turn drives atmospheric photochemistry and numerous escape processes on orbiting planets. We present a new study of the EUV history of solar-type stars, using new and archival {\it Hubble Space Telescope} observations of solar analogs (T$_{\odot}$ $\pm$ 150 K for stars older than 100 Myr) and ``Young Suns" (age $<$ 100 Myr) that will evolve into main sequence early G-type stars to predict the 90 -- 360 Å EUV flux from a sample of 23 stars. We find that the EUV activity evolution for solar-type stars follows a two-component behavior: a saturated L(EUV)/L$_{bol}$ plateau (at a level of about 10$^{-4}$) followed by a power law decay ($\alpha$ $\approx$ $-$1.1) after ages of $\approx$ 50 -- 100 Myr. Consequently, the EUV flux incident at 1 AU around solar analogs varies over the lifetime of the Sun, ranging from 100 $\times$ the present day UV irradiance at 10 Myr to 0.3 $\times$ the present-day level at 10 Gyr. We find that the EUV luminosity is approximately the same as the soft X-ray luminosity up to approximately 1 Gyr, after which the EUV luminosity of the stars dominate. In comparison to Sun-like stars, the EUV saturation level of early/mid M dwarfs is several times higher and lasts $\sim$10 -- 20 times longer.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a catalogue of optical and near-infrared counterparts to radio sources detected in the Euclid Deep Field North (EDF-N) using observations from the LOw-Frequency ARray (LOFAR) High Band Antenna (HBA) at 144 MHz with 6 arcsec angular resolution. The catalogue covers a circular region of $10deg^2$ and includes 23309 radio sources with a peak signal-to-noise ratio greater than 5. After masking regions close to stars and with unreliable photometry in the optical or near-infrared, the catalogue includes 19550 sources. To carry out a robust identification strategy, we combined the statistical power of the Likelihood Ratio (LR) method, including both colour and magnitude information, with targeted visual inspection. The resulting catalogue boasts a remarkable identification rate of 99.2%, successfully matching 19401 out of 19550 radio sources with reliable optical and/or near-infrared counterparts. For 19391 of the matched sources, we successfully derived photometric redshift for the host galaxy by performing an SED fit using the available data in the optical, near-infrared, far-infrared, and radio. LOFAR sources within the catalogue exhibit a median redshift of 1.1, with some extending up to z=6. Around 7% of the sample is detected only in infrared using IRAC and tends towards higher redshifts, with a median of z=3.0. This comprehensive catalogue serves as a valuable resource for future research, enabling detailed investigations into the properties and evolution of LOFAR-detected sources and their host galaxies.
#### Molecules and Chemistry in Red Supergiants

 - **Abstract**
 The envelopes of Red Supergiants (RSGs) have a unique chemical environment not seen in other types of stars. They foster an oxygen-rich synthesis but are tempered by sporadic and chaotic mass loss, which distorts the envelope and creates complex outflow sub-structures consisting of knots, clumps, and arcs. Near the stellar photosphere, molecules and grains form under approximate LTE conditions, as predicted by chemical models. However, the complicated outflows appear to have distinct chemistries generated by shocks and dust destruction. Various RSG envelopes have been probed for their molecular content, mostly by radio and millimeter observations; however, VY Canis Majoris (VY CMa) and NML Cygni (NML Cyg) display the highest chemical complexity, and also the most complicated envelope structure. Thus far, over 29 different molecules have been identified in the envelopes of RSGs. Some molecules are common for circumstellar gas, including CO, SiO, HCN and H$_2$O, which have abundances of $\sim$$10^{-6}$--$10^{-4}$, relative to H$_2$. More exotic oxides have additionally been discovered, such as AlO, AlOH, PO, TiO$_2$, and VO, with abundances of $\sim$$10^{-9}$--$10^{-7}$. RSG shells support intricate maser emission in OH, H$_2$O and SiO, as well. Studies of isotope ratios in molecules suggest dredge-up at least into the H-burning shell, but further exploration is needed.
#### Relativistic X-ray reflection and thermonuclear burst from accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar SRGA J144459.2-604207

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results obtained from the spectral and temporal study of thermonuclear bursts from the millisecond X-ray pulsar SRGA J144459.2-604207 detected with NICER. The dynamic evolution of the spectral parameters in a broad energy range is also investigated during a simultaneously detected burst with XMM-Newton and NuSTAR. The burst profiles exhibit a strong energy dependence, as observed with XMM-Newton, NICER, and NuSTAR. We investigated the reflection feature during these bursts using the disk reflection model. As observed during the peak of the NICER bursts, the reflection model can contribute 30 per cent of the overall emission. During the NICER bursts, a correlation is observed between the flux of the blackbody and the reflection components. The measurements of the mass accretion rate indicate that the bursts may be powered by a mixed H/He fuel. Moreover, the broadband NICER and NuSTAR spectra are also used to probe the reflection signature in the burst-free persistent region using the relativistic reflection model. Based on the variability of the count rate during the NuSTAR observation, we also investigate the evolution of spectral parameters during two different flux levels of the NuSTAR observation. The inner disk radius (Rin) and the angle of inclination are found to be nearly 11 Rg and 50 degrees, respectively. The magnetic field strength at the poles of the neutron star is estimated to be 6 x 10^8 G, assuming that the inner disk is truncated at the magnetospheric boundary.

 - **Abstract**
 Fluctuations and structure across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales are frequently studied in the solar wind. The properties of the low-frequency fluctuations are of relevance to turbulent energy injection into the plasma and the transport of high-energy cosmic rays. Correlation analysis of decade-long intervals of interplanetary data permits study of fluctuations at time scales much longer than suitably defined correlation times, and therefore at frequencies well below those associated with the Kolmogorov inertial range of in situ turbulence. At the frequencies of interest, we study the familiar occurrence of the 1/f spectral signature. We also study point spectral features due to solar rotation and their relation with the 1/f signal. We report novel properties at timescales ranging from minutes up to years, using data selected by wind speed, phase of solar cycle, and cartesian components of the magnetic field. A surprising finding is that the power in solar rotation harmonics is consistent with an extension of the 1/f spectrum, down to frequencies as low as around 5e-7 Hz. The presence of a broadband 1/f spectrum across different wind types supports the interpretation that 1/f signals may be related to or even originate from the solar dynamo.

 - **Abstract**
 The combination of the $z=0-13.5$ cosmic star formation history and active galactic nuclei (AGN) luminosity history as inferred by the James Webb Space Telescope is connected to the cosmic spectral energy distribution (CSED) to explore the sources of reionisation. We compute the redshift evolution of the corresponding cosmic ionising photon emissivity, the neutral fraction and the cosmic microwave background optical depth. We use the generative SED modelling code ProSpect to bracket the ionising emissivity between escape fractions of $f_{\mathrm{esc}} = 1 - 100\%$ for both the stars and AGN. Stars alone could have achieved reionisation by $z\approx 6$ with $f_{\mathrm{esc}} \gtrsim 10-30\%$, depending on the metallicity. On the other hand, AGN by themselves would have struggled to produce sufficiently many ionising photons even with $f_{\mathrm{esc}} = 100\%$. A hybrid model containing both stars and AGN is explored where we find best fit (median$\pm 1\sigma$) $f_{\mathrm{esc}}= 12\%$ ($12^{+10}_{-11}\%$) for the stars and $f_{\mathrm{esc}}= 63\%$ ($79^{+21}_{-44}\%$) for the AGN, maintained at all redshifts. In essence, the joint growth of stellar mass and super massive black holes produces neither more or less ionising photons than needed to reionise $\gtrsim 99\%$ of the intergalactic medium by $z\approx 6$.

 - **Abstract**
 The discrepancy between the early-time estimation and late-time observation on the cosmic baryon content - the 'missing baryon problem' - is a longstanding problem in cosmology. Although recent studies with fast radio bursts (FRBs) have largely addressed this discrepancy, the precise spatial distribution of these baryons remains uncertain due to the effect of galaxy feedback. Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations such as Simba have shown that the partitioning of baryons between the intergalactic medium (IGM) and haloes is sensitive to feedback models, motivating the connection of baryon distribution with feedback physics. With the Simba simulation suite, this study investigates how feedback affects the distribution of matter within large-scale cosmic structures, with implications for FRB foreground modeling. We apply the T-web method to classify the cosmic web into different structures: knots, filaments, sheets, and voids. We then analyze how the different feedback variants of Simba affect the distribution of matter within each structure. Our results show that in Simba, the fractions of IGM gas in different cosmic web structures vary only a few percent under different feedback models. However, jet feedback produces noticeable changes in the gas distribution within structures, enhancing the diffuse IGM on the outskirts of filaments and knots. This research provides a new perspective on the impact of feedback on the IGM and motivates a refined data model for the FRB foreground mapping.
#### Waiting Time Distribution of Supra-Arcade Downflows

 - **Abstract**
 Supra-arcade downflows (SADs) are dark, sunward-moving structures above the arcade of flare loops. Naturally they are considered to be associated with outflows resulting from magnetic reconnection at the vertical current sheet beneath the eruptive structure. Despite the extensive investigations on the SAD properties, the timing information, particularly the waiting time between consecutive SADs, has not been systematically examined. Here, using the 131~Å passband of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on-board the Solar Dynamics Observatory, we studied the waiting time distribution (WTD) of SADs in 7 eruptive flares. In six of the 7 flares, the SADs are identified and tracked in previous studies, by two different methods; and in the 7th flare, by our optimized manual method. Based on statistical evaluations, we found that most of the WTDs are best fitted by a power-law function with the slope ranging from 1.7 to 2.4, in accordance with the prediction of non-stationary Poisson processes or self-organized criticality; but often they can also be fitted almost equally well by a log-normal function. These results rule out linear random or quasi-periodic processes to be responsible for the generation of SADs, but suggest that several nonlinear mechanisms be coupled together in the reconnection outflow region to shape the heavy-tailed WTD of SADs.
#### Ionized gas in NGC 4258: Exploring the AGN -- Star formation connection

 - **Abstract**
 NGC 4258 is a prime target for studying feedback in Low-Luminosity Active Galactic Nuclei (LLAGNs) due to its proximity and comprehensive multi-wavelength coverage. Using new Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS) data from SITELLE at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, we analysed the galaxy's nebular emission lines. Our study focused on spatially resolved line ratios and Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich diagrams, revealing that the ''anomalous spiral arms'' exhibit intense interactions between the jet and interstellar medium (ISM) extending up to 6 kpc with velocity dispersions peak at 200-250 km/s in these regions, contrasting with star-forming areas showing lower values around of 30-50 km/s. Analysis of covering fractions indicates heightened AGN ionization cones aligned with the radio jet, alongside evidence of shock quenching observed in the lower "anomalous arc". Conversely, jet-induced compression may stimulate star formation in other areas. We derived a galaxy-wide star formation rate of $\sim3 M_{\odot}\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ decreasing to $0.3 M_{\odot}\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ within the central $3.4 \mathrm{kpc}^2$. SITELLE's broad field coverage elucidates the galaxy's structural details, confirming that low-power jets significantly influence the host galaxy across parsec and kpc scales. The velocity dispersion map reveals asymmetric or double-peaked emission lines, tracing jet-disk interactions likely responsible for the formation of anomalous arm features. Small-scale ionizing clusters were detected in regions with disrupted gas flows, possibly formed through tidal interactions or shock compression. NGC~4258 thus presents a compelling case for studying LLAGN-driven feedback, illustrating how optical IFS combined with multi-wavelength data clarifies the impact of outflows and shocks on nearby spiral galaxies, providing insights into how these processes shape star formation and ISM conditions.

 - **Abstract**
 We computed the thermal microwave emission from a 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation and compared it with observations of solar jets. The simulation treats the emergence of magnetic flux into the solar atmosphere and its interaction with a low, pre-existing ambient magnetic field. This interaction leads to the formation and development of a jet, driven by an eruption. The computed 17 GHz radio emission is compared with a number of observed jets, with respect to their morphology, their flux, and the rise time of the radio flux. We find that the MHD model reproduces the characteristics of lower-intensity jets reasonably well, whereas there are differences with stronger jets. We suggest possible ways to obtain more realistic jets from MHD simulations, so that they match better the real jets.

 - **Abstract**
 The plasma-$\beta$ is an important fundamental physical quantity in solar plasma physics, which determines the dominating process in the solar atmosphere, i.e., magnetic or thermodynamic processes. Here, for the first time, we provide variations of magnetic field and plasma-$\beta$ along magnetically structured loops from the photosphere to the corona. We have selected several fan loops rooted in sunspot umbra observed simultaneously by the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph and Solar Dynamics Observatory. The 3-min slow waves enabled us to trace and analyze several fan loops with cross-sectional areas in the lower atmosphere and locate their footpoints at the photosphere. We find the RMS magnetic field strengths in the range 1596-2269 G at the photospheric footpoints of the fan loops, which decrease rapidly to 158-236 G at the coronal footpoints. We estimated the plasma-$\beta$ at the photospheric and coronal footpoints in the range 0.2-0.5 and 0.0001-0.001, respectively. We found plasma-$\beta$$<$$1$ along the whole loop, whereas the plasma-$\beta$$\approx$$1$ layer is found to be at sub-photospheric heights. We compared our findings for isolated individual fan loops with a previously established model for active regions and found an almost similar pattern in variations with height, but with different plasma-$\beta$ values. Our results demonstrate the seismological potential of 3-min slow waves omnipresent in the umbral sunspot atmosphere to probe and map isolated loops and determine magnetic field and plasma-$\beta$ along these loops. The obtained parameters provide crucial ingredients for the theoretical modeling of the umbral atmosphere and wave dynamics along loops.

 - **Abstract**
 OGLE-2011-BLG-0462 is an isolated black hole of ~7 solar masses at a distance of 1.5 kpc identified thanks to the astrometric microlensing technique. It is the first specimen discovered of the large population of ~10^8 stellar-mass black holes that are believd to wander in the Galaxy. Electromagnetic radiation powered by accretion from the interstellar medium is expected from OGLE-2011-BLG-0462, but has not been detected at any wavelength. We present the results of a deep pointed observation with the Chandra satellite that provides an upper limit of 3x10^29 erg/s on the luminosity of OGLE-2011-BLG-0462 in the 0.5-7 keV energy range. This is about one order of magnitude below the previous limit obtained from shallower observations that serendipitously covered the sky position of this black hole. Our results are briefly compared with models of the source and with the X-ray upper limits for candidate isolated black holes and black holes in wide binary systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond radio pulses with extremely high bright temperature. Their physical origin is still a mystery. The discovery of FRB 20020428 supports the idea that at least a portion of FRBs is generated by magnetars. However, FRB 20200428 and other radio bursts of SGR 1935+2154 are much less energetic than that of extragalactic FRBs. Thus, whether the progenitors of extragalactic FRBs are magnetars is still in controversy. Here, we investigate the volumetric rates of radio bursts from SGR 1935+2154, non-repeating FRBs and FRB 20180916B using the uniform samples detected by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME). We find that they share a similar relation between the volumetric rate $R$ and the burst energy $E$, i.e., $R\propto E^{-\gamma}$ with $\gamma=1.31\pm 0.13$ from $10^{29}$ erg to $10^{42}$ erg. Our results support the hypothesis that both repeating and non-repeating FRBs originate from magnetars.

 - **Abstract**
 We review recent advances in multimessenger astrophysics, with particular emphasis on Centaurus A and on two pivotal events: the gravitational-wave detection GW 170817 and the ultra-high-energy neutrino KM3-230213A. Centaurus A is the prototype multimessenger source. The GW 170817 event, arising from a binary neutron star merger, marked a transformative moment in astronomy through the joint observation of gravitational waves and a broad spectrum of electromagnetic signals. The KM3-230213A neutrino, detected by the KM3NeT Collaboration, is the most energetic neutrino observed to date and poses significant challenges for current models, given its tension with null results from IceCube and the Pierre Auger Observatory. We assess astrophysical interpretations, including galactic, cosmogenic, and transient extragalactic sources, as well as implications for cosmic-ray acceleration. These cases underscore the scientific potential of high-energy multimessenger events in probing both the extreme universe and new physics.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on NICER X-ray observations of the Be X-ray binary A 0538-66 located in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Fast pulsations (69 ms) in this source were discovered in 1980 during a bright outburst in which it reached a luminosity of ~8E38 erg/s, but were never reobserved since then. We clearly detected the pulsations at P=69.3055 +/- 0.0005 ms with a pulsed fraction of ~20% during a short time interval (~11 minutes) on 2023 January 9, when A 0538-66 had a luminosity of ~8E36 erg/s (0.3-10 keV). The pulsations were not detected in other NICER observations (total exposure ~162.7 ks), during which A 0538-66 had a similar or lower luminosity. On 2023 February 8-9 the source exhibited a strong variability, with short flares reaching ~1E38 erg/s, but no periodic pulsations were detected. Assuming the magnetospheric radius lies within the corotation radius during pulsations, we estimate the neutron star magnetic field is below ~2.7E10 G. This would make A 0538-66 the high-mass X-ray binary with the weakest known magnetic field. We discuss implications for magnetic field evolution in accreting pulsars and propose that, alternatively, A 0538-66 has a stronger magnetic field and during the NICER detection, a centrifugal barrier may have been active while part of the plasma accumulated at the magnetosphere sporadically leaked through it via an instability mechanism, allowing accretion onto the polar caps.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) can accelerate electrons, causing bursts such as type IV emissions in the solar radio continuum. Although radio spectroscopy is a powerful diagnostic tool for the corona, the origin and mechanisms of type IV bursts remain uncertain. In situ measurements can occasionally shed some light on these mechanisms, but they are limited in space and time. Sophisticated numerical modelling offers the best approach to improve our understanding of the physical processes involved. This research examines type IV radio bursts, exploring the effects of various electron distribution properties and CMEs on their generation and characteristics. To transcend idealised assumptions, we employ realistic, anisotropic electron distributions - obtained from particle transport simulations within complex magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) environments - as input for radio emission models. We use the 3D MHD model COCONUT to generate coronal background configurations, including a CME modelled as a modified Titov-Démoulin magnetic flux rope (MFR). These MHD simulations are used by the PARADISE particle transport code, which injects energetic electrons into the MFR and tracks their evolution. Finally, we feed the electron distributions and solar wind parameters into the Ultimate Fast Gyrosynchrotron (GS) Codes to compute radio emission along lines of sight. Electrons injected close to the MFR's central axis remain largely confined, producing a GS emission spectrum resembling observed type IV characteristics. Varying observer positions, CME properties, and spectral indices of the electron energy distributions modify the intensities and durations of the observed bursts. The strongest GS emission is observed to originate from the CME flanks. Our results indicate that GS emission is the major component in type IV spectra, although additional contributors cannot be ruled out.

 - **Abstract**
 Differences in the ingress and egress shapes of transit light curves can indicate morning-evening temperature contrasts on transiting planets. Here, we pinpoint an alternative mechanism that can introduce asymmetries in transit light curves, potentially affecting the accurate determination of morning-evening differences. Small-scale magnetic field concentrations on the surfaces of the host star affect the visibility of stellar limb regions, making them brighter relative to the non-magnetic case. A difference in magnetization between the star's western and eastern limbs can thus create an asymmetry in limb brightness and, consequently, an asymmetry between transit ingress and egress. We model the limb darkening and stellar limb asymmetry in solar-like stars using the 3D radiative MHD code MURaM to simulate magnetized stellar atmospheres and the MPS-ATLAS code to synthesize spectra using ray-by-ray approach. Our results show that ingress-egress depth differences can reach up to 600 ppm for a 10000 ppm transit at 600 nm, depending on the magnetization of the stellar limbs--significantly interfering with planetary signals. Observations of the Sun show that such concentrations are often not accompanied by spots and do not manifest in photometric variability, indicating that even photometrically quiet stars can produce such asymmetries. However, planetary and stellar asymmetries exhibit distinct wavelength dependencies, which we propose to leverage for disentangling them.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: The mechanism behind the heating of the solar chromosphere remains unclear. Friction between neutrals and charges is expected to contribute to plasma heating in a partially ionised plasma (PIP). Aims: We aim to study the efficiency of the frictional heating mechanism in partially ionised plasmas by comparing a single-fluid model (1F) using ambipolar diffusion and a two-fluid model (2F) that incorporates elastic collision terms. Methods: We use the code MANCHA-2F to solve the equations for both models numerically. The simulations involve the vertical propagation of fast magneto-acoustic waves from the top of the photosphere through the chromosphere. The model atmosphere is vertically stratified, including a horizontal, homogeneous magnetic field. We also apply the linear theory to supplement the numerical results. Finally, we look at the assumptions of the 1F model to find out what causes the model discrepancies. Results: The results show that the temperature increase for the 1F model is slightly higher than for the 2F model, especially with long-period waves. The wave energy flux indicates that in the 2F model, the wave is transporting less energy upwards. From the linear theory, we find that the wave in the 2F model loses more energy than in the 1F model in the deep layers, but the opposite occurs in the high layers. Conclusions: The efficient dissipation in the 2F model in deep layers reduces the energy flux at the high layers, reducing heating and explaining the temperature differences between models. We attribute those discrepancies to the contribution of pressure forces to the drift velocity and the omission of a term related to the centre of mass frame reference in the 1F energy equation.}

 - **Abstract**
 Narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s) are generally known to be radio-quiet Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), but a tiny subset of them are found to be extremely radio-loud with radio loudness parameter ($R_{\rm 1.4~GHz}$) $>$ 100. Given their rarity we investigated intra-night optical variability (INOV) and radio characteristics of a sample of 16 extremely radio-loud NLS1s. For all but four sample sources we report intra-night photometric monitoring for the first time with at least one monitoring session per source lasting for a minimum of 3.0 hours duration. In our sample, we detect INOV with a high duty cycle (up to 25 per cent) and large average amplitude ($\overline{\psi}$ $\sim$ 0.16) similar to that found in blazars. Using 3.0 GHz Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) and auxiliary multi-frequency radio data we find that our RL-NLS1s are luminous ($L_{\rm 3.0~GHz}$ $\geq$ 10$^{24}$ W~Hz$^{-1}$), compact (less than a few kpc), variable, flat spectrum (${\alpha}_{\rm radio}$ $>$ -0.5) radio sources. The INOV, radio characteristics, and radio luminosity ($L_{\rm 1.4~GHz}$) versus super-massive black hole mass ($M_{\rm SMBH}$) plot infer that extremely radio-loud NLS1s are low-$z$ and low-luminosity analogs of flat spectrum radio quasars wherein the former are powered by, on average, one order-of-magnitude less massive SMBHs.

 - **Abstract**
 The Single-Mirror Small-Size Telescope (SST-1M) is an Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope designed for detecting very high-energy gamma rays. With a compact design achieved through the adoption of silicon-photomultiplier pixels and a lightweight structure, SST-1M offers a large field of view of about 9° and features a mirror system of 4 m diameter with an optical PSF (at 80% of photon inclusion) of 0.08° on axis and 0.21° at 4° off-axis, and a fully digitizing readout almost deadtime free up to few kHz. The SST-1M achieved a high-performance and cost-effective solution for implementing an array of small-sized telescopes. The stereoscopic system of two SST-1Ms is temporarily installed at the Ondřejov Observatory in the Czech Republic. From an altitude of only about 510 m and in harsh meteorological conditions, the system is detecting galactic sources and flares of AGNs. The accurate calibration of the detector and the simulation benchmark are ongoing. The results of its performance are shown. A future final location is being considered and a future performance outlook is discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 Newborn pulsars resulting from core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are promising sources of high-energy (HE) cosmic rays and neutrinos. In this work, we focus on HE neutrinos generated by interactions between protons accelerated in relativistic pulsar winds and SN ejecta. Using a binned likelihood analysis, we evaluate the detection prospects of these neutrinos with IceCube and explore their potential for probing the initial spin period ($P$) and magnetic field strength ($B$) of newborn pulsars. Noticing a degeneracy in neutrino signal with $B/P^2$ across a broad parameter space, we find that HE neutrinos from a galactic newborn pulsar ($d=10$ kpc) with $(B/10^{12}~{\rm G})(P/{\rm ms})^{-2} \gtrsim 0.003$ can be detected at $\gtrsim 3\sigma$ significance. Even in the absence of a nearby pulsar, the diffuse flux from the cosmologic population of pulsars could be probed by next-generation detectors like IceCube-Gen2 and GRAND200k. For galactic pulsars with $(B/10^{12}~{\rm G})(P/{\rm ms})^{-2} \gtrsim 0.08$, the combination $B/P^2$ can be measured with an accuracy of better than 20\% at the $3\sigma$ confidence level. Additionally, we show that for pulsars with detectable HE neutrino signals, the emission can be clearly distinguished from neutrinos produced by interactions between SN ejecta and the circumstellar medium, due to their distinct temporal and spectral features.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations in the Galaxy and nearby spirals have established that the HI-to-H$_2$ transition at solar metallicity occurs at gas weight of $P_{\rm DE}/k_B\approx 10^4 \ \rm K \ cm ^{-3}$, similar to solar neighbourhood conditions. Even so, state-of-the-art models of a self-regulated interstellar medium underproduce the molecular fraction ($R_{\rm mol}\equiv M_{\rm H_2}/M_{\rm HI}$) at solar neighbourhood conditions by a factor of $\approx2-4$. We use the GHOSDT suite of simulations at a mass resolution range of $100-0.25\ M_{\odot}$ (effective spatial resolution range of $\sim 20-0.05\ \rm pc$) run for 500 Myr to show how this problem is affected by modeling choices such as the inclusion of photoionizing radiation, assumed supernova energy, numerical resolution, inclusion of magnetic fields, and including a model for sub-grid clumping. We find that $R_{\rm mol}$ is not converged even at a resolution of 1 $M_{\odot}$, with $R_{\rm mol}$ increasing by a factor of 2 when resolution is improved from 10 to $1\ M_{\odot}$. Models excluding either photoionization or magnetic fields result in a factor 2 reduction in $R_{\rm mol}$. The only model that agrees with the observed value of $R_{\rm mol}$ includes our sub-grid clumping model, which enhances $R_{\rm mol}$ by a factor of $\sim3$ compared with our fiducial model. This increases the time-averaged $R_{\rm mol}$ to $0.25$, in agreement with the Solar circle value, and closer to the observed median value of $0.42$ in regions comparable to the solar neighbourhood in nearby spirals. Our findings show that small-scale clumping in the ISM plays a significant role in H$_2$ formation even in high-resolution numerical simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 The rotation of the linear polarisation plane of photons during propagation, also known as cosmic birefringence, is a powerful probe of parity-violating extensions of standard electromagnetism. Using Planck legacy data, we confirm previous estimates of the isotropic birefringence angle, finding $\beta \simeq 0.30 \pm 0.05$ [deg] at 68% CL, not including the systematic error from the instrumental polarisation angle. If this is a genuine signal, it could be explained by theories of Chern--Simons-type coupled to electromagnetism, which could lead to a harmonic scale-dependent birefringence signal, if the hypothesis of an ultra-light (pseudo) scalar field does not hold. To investigate these models, we pursue two complementary approaches: first, we fit the birefringence angle estimated at different multipoles, $\beta_{\ell}$, with a power-law model and second, we perform a non-parametric Bayesian reconstruction of it. Both methods yield results consistent with a non-vanishing constant birefringence angle. The first method shows no significant dependence on the harmonic scale (up to $1.8\sigma$ CL), while the second method demonstrates that a constant model is favored by Bayesian evidence. This conclusion is robust across all four published Planck CMB solutions. Finally, we forecast that upcoming CMB observations by Simons Observatory, LiteBIRD and a wishful CMB-Stage 4 experiment could reduce current uncertainties by a factor of approximately 7.

 - **Abstract**
 Low redshift fast radio bursts (FRBs) provide robust measurements of the host-galaxy contribution to the dispersion measure (DM), which can constrain the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of the hosts. We curate a sample of 20 nearby FRBs with low scattering timescales and face-on host galaxies with stellar masses ranging from $10^9 < M^* / M_\odot < 10^{11}$. We fit the distribution of the host galaxy DM to a quadratic model as a function of stellar mass with a mass-independent scatter and find that the more massive the host, the lower its host DM. We report that this relation has a negative slope of $m = -97 \pm 44$ pc/cm$^{-3}$ per dex in stellar mass. We compare this measurement to similar fits to three sub-grid models implemented in the CAMELS suite of simulations from Astrid, IllustrisTNG, and SIMBA and find that fine-tuning of the host ISM contribution as a function of stellar mass is required in order to reconcile the observational data with the predictions of the fiducial CAMELS-Astrid model. More generally, models which attribute a positive correlation between stellar mass and host dispersion measure ($m > 0$) to the CGM are in tension with our measurement. We show that this conclusion is robust to a wide range of assumptions, such as the offset distribution of FRBs from their hosts and the statistics of the cosmic contribution to the DM budget along each sightline. Our results indirectly imply a lower limit on the strength of baryonic feedback in the Local Universe $(z < 0.2)$ in isolated $\sim L^*$ halos, complementing results from weak lensing surveys and kSZ observations which target higher halo mass and redshift ranges.
