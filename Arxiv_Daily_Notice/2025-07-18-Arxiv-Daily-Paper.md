#### Three-dimensional Dynamics of Strongly Magnetized Ion-Electron Relativistic Reconnection

 - **Abstract**
 We present 3D simulations of semirelativistic collisionless magnetic reconnection, where upstream ions are subrelativistic while electrons are ultrarelativistic. We employ the realistic proton-to-electron mass ratio and explore a range of upstream ion magnetization spanning two orders of magnitude, with our highest-magnetization run achieving unprecedentedly large domain sizes. Through a parameter scan, we find that as the system transitions from mildly to trans- and ultrarelativistic regimes the qualitative behavior of reconnection becomes strongly influenced by 3D effects mediated by drift-kink and flux-rope kink dynamics. As a result, magnetic-energy dissipation at high magnetizations, and the subsequent nonthermal particle acceleration, can become less efficient, contrary to general expectations for 3D relativistic reconnection. Our results have important implications for understanding reconnection in magnetized astrophysical scenarios, such as the surroundings of black holes and neutron stars.

 - **Abstract**
 We characterize the magnetic field properties of 352 massive galaxy clusters from the TNG-Cluster magnetohydrodynamical cosmological simulation with a focus on central magnetic field morphology in cool-core (CC) vs non-cool-core (NCC) clusters. We present the central values and radial profiles of magnetic field strength and plasma parameter as a function of mass, cooling status and redshift. Compared to low-redshift observations, TNG-Cluster produces reasonable magnetic field amplitudes in the central regions of clusters spanning a range of 1-200 muG. We then discuss the main finding of this work: z=0 cool-core clusters have preferentially tangential magnetic fields at a characteristic scale of ~ 0.1 r500c. These strongly tangential field orientations are specific to CCs. In contrast, across the full cluster population, magnetic fields show isotropic configurations at all radii and redshifts. As individual halos grow, the evolution of their magnetic field topologies is diverse: tangential features can be short-lived, persist over large cosmological time-scales, or periodically appear, vanish, and reappear towards z=0. We discuss the underlying physics and possible physical scenarios to explain the origin of these structures. We argue that both AGN feedback-driven outflows, and merger-driven sloshing motions, cannot explain the population-wide tangential bias in magnetic field orientation. Instead, we propose that the trapping of internal gravity waves is responsible for the tangentially biased magnetic field topologies that we find in cool-core TNG-Cluster halos, due to the strong entropy gradient in these clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the previously unexplored role of magnetic fields in the formation of second-generation (SG) stars in proto-globular clusters (GCs) using 3D radiation-magnetohydrodynamical simulations. This study is based on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) scenario and incorporates photoionization feedback and stellar winds from AGB stars. We model SG formation within a young ($34$ Myr) massive ($10^6 $ Msun) proto-GC moving through a magnetized, homogeneous interstellar medium. Our results indicate that variations in magnetic field strength and orientation significantly influence the gas geometry and SG star-forming regions around the cluster. Overall, magnetic fields limit SG formation to the very center of the cluster, with stronger magnetic fields tending to form more compact SG clusters. For magnetic field strengths of $0.5$ and $5$ microG, we observe no substantial changes in the mass of formed SG stars. However, with a strong $50$ microG field, we see a $25$ percent increase or a $70$ percent decrease in total SG mass, for a field aligned parallel or perpendicular to the cluster's motion, respectively. This variation reflects how magnetic fields influence gas accretion, as our results suggest that gas accreted from the interstellar medium (ISM) slightly dominates over AGB ejecta in the cluster, except in cases of strong perpendicular fields, where gas accretion is efficiently suppressed. Additionally, stronger magnetic fields limit the cluster's ability to retain its ejecta, leading to the formation of stars with lower helium abundances. On the other hand, a strong perpendicular magnetic field produces SG stars that originate from AGB ejecta and exhibit the highest helium abundances.

 - **Abstract**
 Active galactic nuclei (AGN) emit radiation via accretion across the entire energy spectrum. While the standard disk and corona model can somewhat describe this emission, it fails to predict specific features such as the soft X-ray excess, the short-term optical/UV variability, and the observed UV/X-ray correlation in AGN. In this context, the fraction of AGN emission in different bands (i.e., bolometric corrections) can be useful to better understand the accretion physics of AGN. Past studies have shown that the X-ray bolometric corrections are strongly dependent on the physical properties of AGN, such as their luminosities and Eddington ratios. However, since these two parameters depend on each other, it has been unclear which is the main driver of the X-ray bolometric corrections. We present here results from a large study of hard X-ray-selected (14-195 keV) nearby ($z<0.1$) AGN. Based on our systematic analysis of the simultaneous optical-to-X-ray spectral energy distributions of 236 unobscured AGN, we found that the primary parameter controlling the X-ray bolometric corrections is the Eddington ratio. Our results show that while the X-ray bolometric correction increases with the bolometric luminosity for sources with intermediate Eddington ratios ($0.01-1$), this dependence vanishes for sources with lower Eddington ratios ($<0.01$). This could be used as evidence for a change in the accretion physics of AGN at low Eddington ratios.

 - **Abstract**
 Even though magnetic fields play an important role in galaxy evolution, the redshift evolution of galactic-scale magnetic fields is not well constrained observationally. In this paper we aim to provide an observational constraint on the time-scale of the mean-field dynamo, and derive the magnetic field in a distant galaxy at $z=0.414$. We obtained broadband spectro-polarimetric $1-8$ GHz Very Large Array observation of the lensing system B1600+434, which is a background quasar gravitationally lensed by a foreground spiral galaxy into two images. We apply Rotation Measure (RM) synthesis and Stokes $QU$ fitting to derive the RM of the two lensed images, which we use to estimate the lensing galaxy's magnetic field. We measured the RM difference between the lensed images, and detected Faraday dispersion caused by the magneto-ionic medium of the lensing galaxy at $z=0.414$. Assuming that the RM difference is due to the large-scale regular field of the galaxy's halo, we measure a coherent magnetic field with a strength of $0.2 - 3.0\,\mu$G at 0.7 kpc, and $0.01 - 2.8 \,\mu$G at 6.2 kpc vertical distance from the disk of the galaxy. We derive an upper limit on the dynamo e-folding time: $\tau_{\rm dynamo} < 2.9~\times 10^8$~yr. We find turbulence on scales below 50 pc, and a turbulent field strength of $0.2 - 12.1 \, \mu$G. We measure the magnetic field in the halo of a spiral galaxy, and find turbulence on scales of $<50$ pc. If the RM difference is due to large-scale fields, our result follows the expectation from mean-field dynamo theory, and shows that galaxies at $z \simeq 0.4$ already have magnetic field strengths similar to present-day galaxies. However, we note the caveat of the possibility of the turbulent field of the lensing galaxy contributing to the observed RM difference.
#### Sample Variance Denoising in Cylindrical 21-cm Power Spectra

 - **Abstract**
 State-of-the-art simulations of reionisation-era 21-cm signal have limited volumes, generally orders of magnitude smaller than observations. Consequently, the Fourier modes in common between simulation and observation have limited overlap, especially in cylindrical (2D) k-space that is natural for 21-cm interferometry. This makes sample variance (i.e. the deviation of the simulated sample from the population mean due to finite box size) a potential issue when interpreting upcoming 21-cm observations. We introduce \texttt{21cmPSDenoiser}, a score-based diffusion model that can be applied to a single, forward-modelled realisation of the 21-cm 2D power spectrum (PS), predicting the corresponding \textit{population mean} on-the-fly during Bayesian inference. Individual samples of 2D Fourier amplitudes of wave modes relevant to current 21-cm observations can deviate from the mean by over 50\% for 300 cMpc simulations, even when only considering stochasticity due to sampling of Gaussian initial conditions. \texttt{21cmPSDenoiser} reduces this deviation by an order of magnitude, outperforming current state-of-the-art sample variance mitigation techniques like Fixing \& Pairing by a factor of few at almost no additional computational cost ($\sim6$s per PS). Unlike emulators, the denoiser is not tied to a particular model or simulator since its input is a (model-agnostic) realisation of the 2D 21-cm PS. Indeed, we confirm that it generalises to PS produced with a different 21-cm simulator than those on which it was trained. To quantify the improvement in parameter recovery, we simulate a 21-cm PS detection by the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Arrays (HERA) and run different inference pipelines corresponding to commonly-used approximations. We find that using \texttt{21cmPSDenoiser} in the inference pipeline outperforms other approaches, yielding an unbiased posterior that is 50\% narrower.
#### The vanishing of the long photometric cycle in AU Monocerotis

 - **Abstract**
 Double periodic variables (DPVs) are a group of semi-detached interacting binaries that exhibit a long photometric cycle with an average length of $\sim33$ times the orbital period of the system. It has been proposed that this long photometric cycle originates from a modulated mass transfer rate from the donor star, which itself is driven by an internal magnetic dynamo. One of the most well-studied DPVs in the Milky Way is AU Monocerotis (AU Mon). We aim to enhance our understanding of the long photometric cycle in AU Mon by characterising its behaviour through the analysis of available photometric data from several databases and surveys. We summarise previous findings on the system and analyse its published multi-wavelength photometry from different sources, covering 46.3 years, to study the variability of its light curve. We find that the orbital period has remained constant over recent decades, but the long cycle of approximately 417 days vanished around 2010. From an O-C analysis, we conclude that the system is experiencing a change in its orbital period of no greater than $0.038\pm0.040$ s yr$^{-1}$, and thus, imposing a value of $2\times10^{-8}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ for $\dot{M}$ in a fully conservative mass transfer regime. A time-series analysis of the disentangling light curve in the Ic filter shows a transient periodicity of approximately 1910 days lasting at least 2000 days before it also disappears around the year 2020. An analysis of the available APASS light curves around the year 2013 shows a strong periodicity at approximately 280 days, which appears to be stronger in the Z filter. We report what is the second observation of the sudden disappearance of the long cycle in a DPV, after the Galactic DPV TYC 5353-1137-1. The disappearance of the long cycle in AU Mon is a strong constraint for current models that aim to explain the long cycle in DPVs.

 - **Abstract**
 The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has unveiled a population of enigmatic, compact sources at high redshift known as ''Little Red Dots'' (LRDs), whose physical nature remains a subject of intense debate. Concurrently, the rapid assembly of the first supermassive black holes (SMBHs) requires the formation of heavy seeds, for which supermassive stars (SMSs) are leading theoretical progenitors. In this work, we perform the first quantitative test of the hypothesis that LRDs are the direct observational manifestation of these primordial SMSs. We present a novel, first-principles pipeline generating synthetic spectra for a non-rotating, metal-free $10^6 \, M_\odot$ SMS. We establish that its luminosity ($L_\lambda \approx 1.7 \times 10^{44} \, \text{erg} \, \text{s}^{-1} \, \mu\text{m}^{-1}$ at 4050 Angstroms) provides a decisive constraint, matching prominent LRDs. Our model self-consistently reproduces their defining spectral features: the extreme, V-shaped Balmer break is an intrinsic photospheric effect, while the complex line phenomenology, strong H$\beta$ in emission with other Balmer lines in absorption arises from non-LTE effects in a single stellar atmosphere. Applying physically motivated broadening, our spectrum provides an excellent quantitative match to LRDs at both high ($z=7.76$) and low ($z=3.55$) redshift. Our model provides a simple, self-consistent physical picture for LRDs, offering a compelling alternative to multi-component obscured AGN scenarios and suggesting we may be directly witnessing the final, luminous moments of an SMBH progenitor before its ultimate collapse.
#### Fermi-GBM Observations of GRB 230307A: An Exceptionally Bright Long-Duration Gamma-ray Burst with an Associated Kilonova

 - **Abstract**
 On March 7th, 2023 the \textit{Fermi} Gamma-ray Burst Monitor observed the second highest fluence gamma-ray burst (GRB) ever, GRB~230307A. With a duration beyond 100~s, GRB~230307A contains a multitude of rapidly-varying peaks, and was so bright it caused instrumental effects in the GBM detectors. The high fluence of this burst, (6.02 $\pm$ 0.02)$\times$10$^{-3}$ erg cm$^{-2}$, prompted rapid follow-up across the electro magnetic spectrum including the discovery of an associated kilonova. GRB~230307A is one of a few long GRBs with an associated compact merger origin. Three main temporal regions of interest are identified for fine time-resolution spectral analysis: triggering pulse, main emission, and late emission, and the parameter evolution is traced across these regions. The high flux of the burst allowed for the statistical preference of a more complex, physically-motivated model, the Double Smoothly Broken Power Law, over typical spectral fitting functions for GRBs. From this model the evolution of the parameters was found to be in accordance with those expected for synchrotron radiation in the fast-cooling regime. Additionally, it was found that the flux experiences a steep decline in late time intervals, a feature which is often attributed to high-latitude emission, which follows the dissipation episodes. Furthermore, GRB~230307A was found to have one of the highest inferred bulk Lorentz factors of $\Gamma = 1600$. GRB~230307A is a noteworthy burst in terms of flux alone, but additionally provides a unique insight into the possible temporal and spectral characteristics of a new long merger class of GRBs.

 - **Abstract**
 The dynamical evolution of short-period low-mass binary stars (with mass $M < 1.5M_{\odot}$, from formation to the late main-sequence, and with orbital periods less than $\sim$10 days) is strongly influenced by tidal dissipation. This process drives orbital and rotational evolution that ultimately results in circularized orbits and rotational frequencies synchronized with the orbital frequency. Despite the fundamental role of tidal dissipation in binary evolution, constraining its magnitude of (typically parameterized by the tidal quality factor $\mathcal{Q}$) has remained discrepant by orders of magnitude in the existing literature. Recent observational constraints from time-series photometry (e.g., Kepler, K2, TESS), as well as advances in theoretical models to incorporate a more realistic gravitational response within stellar interiors, are invigorating new optimism for resolving this long-standing problem. To investigate the prospects and limitations of constraining tidal $\mathcal{Q}$, we use global sensitivity analysis and simulation based inference to examine how the initial conditions and tidal $\mathcal{Q}$ influence the observable orbital and rotational states. Our results show that even under the simplest and most tractable models of tides, the path towards inferring $\mathcal{Q}$ from individual systems is severely hampered by inherent degeneracies between tidal $\mathcal{Q}$ and the initial conditions, even when considering the strongest possible constraints (i.e., binaries with precise masses, ages, orbital periods, eccentricities, and rotation periods). Finally as an alternative, we discuss how population synthesis approaches may be a more promising path forward for validating tidal theories.
#### Solar Spicules, Filigrees and Solar Wind Switchbacks

 - **Abstract**
 Spicules, the smallest observable jet-like dynamic features ubiquitous in the chromosphere, are supposedly an important potential source for small-scale solar wind transients, with supporting evidence yet needed. We studied the high-resolution H-alpha images (0.10'') and magnetograms (0.29'') from Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO) to find that spicules are an ideal candidate for the solar wind magnetic switchbacks detected by the Parker Solar Probe (PSP). It is not that spicules are a miniature of coronal jets, but that they have unique properties not found in other solar candidates in explaining solar origin of switchbacks. (1) The spicules under this study originate from filigrees, all in a single magnetic polarity. Since filigrees are known as footpoints of open fields, the spicule guiding field lines can form a unipolar funnel, which is needed to create an SB patch, a group of fieldlines that switch from one common base polarity to the other polarity. (2) The spicules come in a cluster lined up along a supergranulation boundary, and the simulated waiting times from their spatial intervals exhibit a number distribution continuously decreasing from a few sec to ~30 min, similar to that of switchbacks. (3) From a time-distance map for spicules, we estimate their occurrence rate as 0.55 spicules per Mm^2 and second, sufficiently high for detection by PSP. In addition the dissimilarity of spicules with coronal jets, including the absence of base brightening and low correlation with EUV emission is briefly discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 Large-scale solar ejections are well understood, but the extent to which small-scale solar features directly influence the solar wind remains an open question, primarily due to the challenges of tracing these small-scale ejections and their impact. Here, we measure the fine-scale motions of network bright points along a coronal hole boundary in high-resolution H-alpha images from the 1.6m Goode Solar Telescope at Big Bear Solar Observatory to quantify the agitation of open flux tubes into generating Alfvenic pulses. We combine the motion, magnetic flux, and activity duration of the flux tubes to estimate the energy content carried by individual Alfvenic pulses, which is ~10+25 erg, adequately higher than the energies ~10+23 erg estimated for the magnetic switchbacks observed by the Parker Solar Probe (PSP). This implies the possibility that the surface-generated Alfvenic pulses could reach the solar wind with sufficient energy to generate switchbacks, even though some of then are expected to be reflected back in the stratified solar atmosphere. Alfvenic pulses further reproduce for the first time other properties of switchbacks, including the filling factor above ~8% at granular and supergranular scales, which correspond best to the lower end of the mesoscale structure. This quantitative result for solar energy output in the form of Alfvenic pulses through magnetic funnels provides a crucial clue to the ongoing debate about the dynamic cycle of energy exchange between the Sun and the mesoscale solar wind that has been raised, but has not been adequately addressed, by PSP near-Sun observations.
#### Solar Chromospheric Network as a Source for Solar Wind Switchbacks

 - **Abstract**
 Recent studies suggest that the magnetic switchbacks (SBs) detected by the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) carry information on the scales of solar supergranulation (large scale) and granulation (medium scale). We test this claim using high-resolution H-alpha images obtained with the visible spectro-polarimeters (VIS) of the Goode Solar Telescope (GST) in Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO). As possible solar sources, we count all the spicule-like features standing along the chromospheric networks near the coronal hole boundary visible in the H-alpha blue-wing but absent in the red-wing images and measure the geometric parameters of dense sections of individual flux tubes. Intervals between adjacent spicules located along the chromospheric networks are found in the range of 0.4-1.5 Mm (0.03 deg - 0.12 deg) tending to be smaller than the medium scale of SBs. Inter-distances between all pairs of the flux tubes are also counted and they appear in a single peak distribution around 0.7 Mm (0.06 deg) unlike the waiting time distribution of SBs in a scale-free single power-law form. Length-to-diameter ratio of the dense section of flux tubes is as high as 6-40, similar to the aspect ratio of SBs. Number of spicules along a network can be as high as 40-100, consistent with numerous SBs within a patch. With these numbers, it is agued that the medium scale of SBs can be understood as an equilibrium distance resulting from random walk within each diverging magnetic field funnels connected to the chromospheric networks.
#### Bar-driven Streaming Motions Mimic a Massive Bulge in the Inner Milky Way

 - **Abstract**
 The circular speed curve of the Milky Way provides a key constraint on its mass distribution, reflecting the axisymmetric component of the gravitational potential. This is especially critical in the inner Galaxy ($R \lesssim 4$ kpc), where non-axisymmetric structures such as the stellar bar and nuclear stellar disk strongly influence dynamics. However, significant discrepancies remain between circular speed curves inferred from stellar dynamical modeling and those derived from the terminal-velocity method applied to gas kinematics. To investigate this, we perform three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations including cooling, heating, star formation, and feedback, under a realistic gravitational potential derived from stellar dynamical models calibrated to observational data. This potential includes the Galactic bar, stellar disks, dark matter halo, nuclear stellar disk, and nuclear star cluster. We generate synthetic longitude-velocity ($l$-$v$) diagrams and apply the terminal-velocity method to derive circular speeds. The simulated gas reproduces the observed terminal-velocity envelope, including a steep inner rise. We find this feature arises from bar-driven non-circular motions, which cause the terminal-velocity method to overestimate circular speeds by up to a factor of 2 at $R \sim 0.4$ kpc, and enclosed mass by up to a factor of 4. These results suggest that inner gas-based rotation curves can significantly overestimate central mass concentrations. The steep inner rise in gas-derived circular speeds does not require a massive classical bulge but can be explained by bar-induced streaming motions. Rather than proposing a new mechanism, our study provides a clear, Milky Way-specific demonstration of this effect, emphasizing the importance of dynamical modeling that explicitly includes non-circular motions for accurate mass inference in the inner Milky Way.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we carry out multiwavelength observations of simultaneous longitudinal and transverse oscillations of a quiescent filament excited by an extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) wave on 2023 February 17. A hot channel eruption generates an X2.3 class flare and a fast coronal mass ejection (CME) in active region (AR) NOAA 13229 close to the eastern limb. The CME drives an EUV wave, which propagates westward at a speed of ~459 km s-1. After arriving at the filament ~340.3 Mm away from the flare site, the filament is disturbed and starts large-amplitude oscillations, which are mainly observed in 171 this http URL longitudinal oscillations last for nearly two cycles. The average initial amplitude, velocity, period, and damping time are ~4.7 Mm, ~26.5 km s-1, ~1099.1 s, and ~2760.3 s, respectively. According to the pendulum model, the curvature radius and minimum horizontal magnetic field strength of the dips are estimated to be 6.7-9.9 Mm and 4.6-5.6 G. The transverse oscillations last for 2-3 cycles. The average initial amplitude, velocity, period, and damping time are ~1.8 Mm, ~11.2 km s-1, ~994.4 s, and ~3576.2 s, respectively. The radial magnetic field strength of the dips are estimated to be 6.6-7.4 G.

 - **Abstract**
 This study introduces an innovative framework aimed at overcoming the ongoing issue of mass-sheet degeneracy (MSD) in time-delay cosmography by incorporating observations of both gravitationally lensed and unlensed Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). By simultaneously using lensing magnification measurements $\mu^{\rm{obs}}$ and cosmic distance ratios ($D_s/D_{ds}$), we develop a Bayesian framework capable of breaking the MSD. Specifically, we reconstruct the distance-redshift and magnitude-redshift relations from unlensed Type Ia supernovae using Gaussian process to avoid dependence on specific cosmological models. Our framework shows substantial efficacy in resolving the MSD by imposing constraints on the MSD parameter $\lambda$. Furthermore, we extend this framework to analyze multiple gravitational lensing systems. The results show strong agreement with the fiducial MSD parameters used in the data simulation, confirming our method's effectiveness in mitigating the MSD. Ultimately, this technique enables the derivation of corrected time-delay distance measurements under the MSD, improving the precision of cosmological parameters inferred from strong lensing systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Sagittarius~A$^*$, the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy, exhibits flares across various wavelengths, yet their origins remain elusive. We performed 3D two-temperature General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of magnetized accretion flows initialized from multi-loop magnetic field configuration onto a rotating black hole and conducted General Relativistic Radiative Transfer (GRRT) calculations considering contributions from both thermal and non-thermal synchrotron emission processes. Our results indicate that the polarity inversion events from the multi-loop magnetic field configurations can generate $138\,\rm THz$ flares consistent with observations with the help of non-thermal emission. By tracing the intensity evolution of light rays in GRRT calculations, we identify the precise location of the flaring region and confirm that it originates from a large-scale polarity inversion event. We observe time delays between different frequencies, with lower-frequency radio flares lagging behind higher frequencies due to plasma self-absorption in the disk. The time delay between near-infrared and 43 GHz flares can reach up to $\sim 50$ min, during which the flaring region gradually shifts outward, becoming visible at lower frequencies. Our study confirms that large-scale polarity inversion in a Standard And Normal Evolution (SANE) accretion flow with a multi-loop initial magnetic configuration can be a potential mechanism driving flares from Sgr~A$^*$.

 - **Abstract**
 In the final paper of this series, we discuss new perspectives and challenges in the study of interstellar medium (ISM), leveraging comprehensive catalogs and physical insights presented in our previous papers. We focus on key questions of far-infrared (FIR) fine-structure lines (FSLs): their origins, diagnostic value, and implications of correlations. Our analysis reveals a strong dependence on elemental abundance, so that FSL/H$\alpha$ traces metallicity, [N II]/[C II] traces N/O, and $\sim$80% of [C II] emission arises from neutral gas without systematic variations. We conclude a coherence exists between the emissions from ionized and neutral gases regarding energy sources and distribution. We argue that [C II] is physically a metallicity-dependent star formation rate (SFR) tracer, while its correlations with atomic or molecular gas masses are secondary. Crucially, the [C II] ``deficit'' is only part of a universal ``deficit'' problem that shows in all neutral and ionized gas lines including extinction-corrected H$\alpha$, caused by infrared (IR) luminosities and characterized by a dichotomy in gas and dust behaviors. This universal ``deficit'' marks a breakdown of the obscuration-corrected star-formation rate (SFR) calibration and imperils SFR estimates. We argue that it is caused by either IR ``excess'' or ionized gas ``deficit'', and present possible scenarios. A renewed picture of ISM structure is needed to reconcile with ionized--neutral gas coherence, metallicity dependence, and gas--dust dichotomy. We also discuss differences of FIR FSL at high redshifts: the offset in ``deficit'' trends, the similar [O III]/[C II] in metal-poor galaxies, and elevated [O III]/[C II] in dusty galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational wave (GW) observations are expected to serve as a powerful and independent probe of the expansion history of the universe. By providing direct and calibration-free measurements of luminosity distances through waveform analysis, GWs provide a fundamentally different and potentially more robust approach to measuring cosmic-scale distances compared to traditional electromagnetic observations, which is known as the standard siren method. In this review, we present an overview of recent developments in GW standard siren cosmology, the latest observational results, and prospects for constraining cosmological parameters using future GW detections. We first introduce standard sirens based on how redshift information is obtained and outline the Bayesian framework used in cosmological parameter estimation. We then review the measurements on the Hubble constant from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA network and present the potential role of future standard siren observations in cosmological parameter estimations. A central focus of this review is the unique ability of GW observations to break cosmological parameter degeneracies inherent in the EM observations. Since the cosmological parameter degeneracy directions of GW and EM observations are quite different (roughly orthogonal in some cases), their combination can significantly improve constraints on cosmological parameters. This complementarity is expected to become one of the most critical advantages for GW standard siren cosmology. Looking forward, we highlight the importance of combining GW standard sirens with other emerging late-universe cosmological probes such as fast radio bursts, 21 cm intensity mapping, and strong gravitational lensing to forge a precise cosmological probe for exploring the late universe. Finally, we introduce the challenges and the role of machine learning in future standard siren analysis.

 - **Abstract**
 Pressure isotropy, i.e., radial pressure equal to tangential pressure, is often assumed when studying neutron stars. However, multiple physical mechanisms, including pion/kaon condensation, magnetic fields, superfluidity, dark matter clustering, and violations of general relativity, can lead to a pressure anisotropy. This work presents a comprehensive measurement of pressure anisotropy in neutron stars. Our analysis incorporates both an extensive set of nuclear experimental constraints and multi-messenger astrophysical observations, including gravitational wave detections and electromagnetic observations. The Bayesian framework employed marginalizes over equation of state uncertainties and allows the anisotropy to vary between individual neutron stars. We find the Bayes factor for anisotropy against isotropy is $e^{0.46}=10^{0.20}=1.58\gtrsim 3:2$. Additionally, the posterior indicates a population-wide preference for negative pressure anisotropy, with GW170817 serving as the primary contributor. The individual variability suggests density-scale-independent anisotropy, potentially attributable to magnetic fields, dark matter clustering, or deviations from general relativity rather than phase transitions. While the evidence for pressure anisotropy remains inconclusive, these results demonstrate that pressure anisotropy can be utilized as a valuable diagnostic tool for identifying missing physics in neutron star modeling or revealing tension among observations in the era of multi-messenger astronomy.

 - **Abstract**
 The extraction of the sky-averaged 21 cm signal from Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionization faces significant challenges. The bright and anisotropic Galactic foreground, which is 4 - 6 orders of magnitude brighter than the 21 cm signal, when convolved with the inevitably chromatic beam, introduces additional spectral structures that can easily mimic the real 21 cm signal. In this paper, we investigate the signal extraction for a lunar-orbit experiment, where the antenna moves fast in orbit and data from multiple orbits have to be used. We propose a physics-motivated and correlated modeling of both the foreground and the measurement errors. By dividing the sky into multiple regions according to the spectral index distribution and accounting for the full covariance of modeling errors, we jointly fit both the foreground and the 21 cm signal using simulated data for the Discovering the Sky at the Longest wavelength lunar orbit experiment. This method successfully extracts the 21 cm signals of various amplitudes from the simulated data even for a testing antenna with a relatively high level of chromaticity. This approach, which is robust against moderate beam chromaticity, significantly relaxes the stringent design and manufacturing requirements for the antenna, offering a practical solution for future 21 cm global signal experiments either on the ground or in space.

 - **Abstract**
 Quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) provide a powerful tool for probing the structure of the innermost accretion flow and corona around supermassive black holes. RE~J1034+396, the most prominent AGN known to host an X-ray QPO, exhibits both short-term and long-term QPO evolution, offering a unique opportunity to investigate accretion disk and corona physics through its temporal behavior. We report a possible long-term ($\sim 92.2$ days) cyclic evolution of the QPO in RE~J1034+396, joining the detected QPO ($\sim 3730$ s) and its short-term ($\sim 17$ ks) modulation to form a possible QPO triplet, which is potentially the first such structure identified in an AGN. By applying the relativistic precession model to the QPO triplet, we constrain the black hole mass to $1.7^{+0.9}_{-0.8} \times 10^{6}\ M_\odot$, consistent with independent estimates, and find a low dimensionless black hole spin of $0.017^{+0.028}_{-0.012}$. We propose an exploratory model that involves a quasiperiodic ultra-fast outflow (UFO) within the framework of the relativistic precession model, explaining the QPO lag reversal, the modulation of hard-band QPO amplitude by soft-band flux, and the long-term evolution of timing properties. Supporting evidence includes blueshifted emission and absorption lines indicating a strong UFO at $\sim 0.3c$. This work provides new insights into the inner regions of AGN accretion disks and motivates further efforts in both numerical modeling and high-cadence timing observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Based on solutions of the cascade equations, the air-shower universality is a framework that for all air showers with the same energy, zenith angle, depth of shower maximum, and muon number predicts the same longitudinal, lateral, and energy distributions of electromagnetic shower particles. We employ a universality-based model of shower development that incorporates hadronic particle components to reconstruct observables from extensive air showers produced by ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. The model can estimate key parameters, such as the depth of the shower maximum and the number of muons at the event level. We discuss the performance of the reconstruction algorithm using both air-shower simulations, and preliminary results obtained from the Phase-I data of the Pierre Auger Observatory.

 - **Abstract**
 To elucidate the cascade direction of the solar wind turbulence, we analyzed magnetic helicity density spectra from the Parker Solar Probe data across more than 500 heliocentric distances. For the first time, we confirmed a persistent inverse cascade extending from the Sun to Mercury's orbital vicinity. This finding challenges the conventional hypothesis that the magnetic helicity density within the inner heliosphere is random. Furthermore, our analysis revealed a radial sign change of the spectral magnetic helicity density at a frequency whose value decreases logarithmically with distance. These results provide new insights into the evolution of solar wind turbulence in the inner heliosphere.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the physical environment of the Galactic mid-infrared (MIR) bubble [HKS2019] E71 (hereafter E71) through a multi-wavelength approach. E71 is located at the edge of a filamentary structure, as traced in Herschel images (250-500 $\mu$m), Herschel column density map, and molecular maps in the velocity range [-20,-14] km/s. It hosts a stellar cluster (radius~1.26 pc, distance~1.81+/-0.15 kpc) associated with radio continuum emission, including a centrally positioned B1.5-type massive star (hereafter 'm2'), along with an enhanced population of evolved low-mass stars and young stellar objects. MIR images and molecular line maps reveal a PDR surrounding 'm2', exhibiting an arc-like structure along the edges of E71. Regularly spaced molecular and dust condensations are identified along this structure. The position-velocity map of 12CO emission suggests an expansion of molecular gas concentrated at the periphery of E71. Near-infrared spectroscopic observations with TANSPEC confirm the presence of the accretion process in a massive young stellar object (MYSO) located near the edge of the bubble. High-resolution uGMRT radio continuum maps uncover substructures in the ionized emission, both toward the MYSO and the center of E71. These findings support that 'm2' has shaped an arc-like morphology through its feedback processes. The pressure exerted by 'm2' and the velocity structure of the 12/13CO(1-0) emission suggest that the stellar feedback has likely driven out molecular material, leading to the formation of the expanding E71 bubble. Our overall investigation infers that the "collect and collapse" process might be a possible mechanism that can describe the ongoing star formation activities around the E71 bubble.
#### A Torus Remnant Revealed by the Infrared Echo of TDE AT2019qiz: Implications for the Missing Energy and QPE Formation

 - **Abstract**
 AT2019qiz is the first standard optical tidal disruption event (TDE) with detection of X-ray quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs), providing strong evidence for TDE-QPE association. Moreover, it belongs to the rare subset of optical TDEs with prominent infrared (IR) echoes revealed by the multi-epoch photometry from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). The IR light curve shows an early bump, followed by a steady rise until the second-to-last epoch, after which it appears to enter a plateau phase. The dust temperature decreased until the fourth epoch and remains approximately constant for the subsequent five epochs. We have fitted the last five epochs using a convex dust ring model, resulting in an inner radius $>1.2$ pc. Such a large radius greatly exceeds the inner radius of the active galactic nuclei (AGN) torus for a $10^6\,M_{\odot}$ black hole and thus could be a torus remnant with the inner part having vanished, further supporting the unified scenario of recently faded AGNs, TDEs, and QPEs. Consequently, a connection between QPEs and IR-bright TDEs is naturally expected. Moreover, the echo requires at least a peak bolometric luminosity of $(6.6, 9.5, 1.0)\times 44 \,\text{erg}\,\text{s}^{-1}$ assuming silicate, silicon carbide, and graphite dust grains, respectively, all of which are significantly higher than the peak optical blackbody luminosity. It adds to the accumulating evidence that the missing energy of TDEs may lie in the unobservable extreme UV. This work highlights the unique value of IR echoes in the study of TDEs and QPEs, and a promising prospect in the era of the Near-Earth Object (NEO) Surveyor, the successor to WISE.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the results of a comprehensive analysis of X-ray observations carried out with \textit{Chandra}, \textit{XMM-Newton} and \textit{NuSTAR} of the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) associated with PSR B1853+01, located inside the W44 supernova remnant (SNR). Previous X-ray observations unveiled the presence of a fast-moving pulsar, PSR B1853+01, located at the southern edge of the W44 thermal X-ray emission region, as well as an elongated tail structure trailing the pulsar. Our analysis reveals, in addition, the presence of an ``outflow'' feature ahead of the pulsar extending for about 1 \arcmin ($\sim$ 1.0 pc at the distance of 3.2 kpc). At larger scales, the entire PWN seems to be surrounded by a faint, diffuse X-ray emission structure. The southern part of this structure displays the same unusual morphology as the ``outflow'' feature ahead of the pulsar, and extends along $\sim 6$ \arcmin ($\sim$ 5 pc) in the direction of the pulsar proper motion. In this report, a spatially-resolved spectral analysis for the different extended regions around PSR B1853+01 is carried out. For an updated value of the column density of $0.65_{+0.46}^{-0.42} \times 10^{22} ~\textrm{cm}^{-2}$, a power-law fit to the ``outflow'' region yields a spectral index $\Gamma \approx 1.24_{+0.23}^{-0.24}$, which is significantly harder than that of the pulsar ($\Gamma \approx 1.87_{+0.48}^{-0.43}$) and the pulsar tail ($\Gamma \approx 2.01_{+0.39}^{-0.38}$). We argue that both the ``outflow'' structure and the surrounding halo-like X-ray emission might be produced by high-energy particles escaping the PWN around PSR B1853+01, a scenario recently suggested also for other Bow-shock PWNe with jet-like structures and/or TeV halos.

 - **Abstract**
 Upcoming Stage-IV surveys will deliver measurements of distribution of matter with unprecedented precision, demanding highly accurate theoretical models for cosmological parameter inference. A major source of modeling uncertainty lies in astrophysical processes associated with galaxy formation and evolution, which remain poorly understood. Probes such as the thermal and kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effects, X-rays, and dispersion measure from fast radio bursts offer a promising avenue for mapping the distribution and thermal properties of cosmic baryons. A unified analytical framework capable of jointly modeling these observables is essential for fully harnessing the complementary information while mitigating probe-specific systematics. In this work, we present a detailed assessment of existing analytical models, which differ in their assumptions and prescriptions for simultaneously describing the distribution of matter and baryons in the universe. Using the Magneticum hydrodynamical simulation, we test these models by jointly analyzing the 3D auto- and cross-power spectra of the matter and baryonic fields that underpin the above probes. We find that all models can reproduce the power spectra at sub-percent to few-percent accuracy, depending on the tracer combination and number of free parameters. Their ability to recover underlying halo properties, such as the evolution of gas abundance and thermodynamic profiles with halo mass, varies considerably. Our results suggest that these models require further refinement and testing for reliable interpretation of multi-wavelength datasets.

 - **Abstract**
 We present deep HST imaging of one of the nearest ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) outside of the Local Group: F8D1, a satellite of M81 known to be tidally disrupting. UDGs are an enigmatic and diverse population, with evolutionary pathways ranging from tidal processing to bursty feedback and high initial angular momentum. To determine F8D1's evolutionary drivers, we resolve stars in F8D1's central $\sim$1 kpc and in a parallel field $\sim$6 kpc along its major axis to deep photometric limits, reaching below the Red Clump. We also image eight shallower fields along F8D1's major and minor axes. We calculate the star formation history (SFH) in the two deep fields, finding that while currently quiescent, both regions experienced a substantial burst $\sim$2 Gyr ago and a smaller burst $\sim$500 Myr ago, which likely formed F8D1's nuclear star cluster. In the shallow fields, using the ratio of evolved Asymptotic Giant Branch and Red Giant Branch stars out to $\sim$13 kpc along F8D1's known stellar stream, we confirm that F8D1 was globally star-forming until at least 2 Gyr ago. We estimate a total progenitor stellar mass, including the stream, of $\sim$1.3$\times$10$^8\ M_{\odot}$, with an average [M/H] $\sim$ $-$0.8. We compare F8D1's properties to those of Local Group galaxies with similar initial stellar mass. We find that F8D1 is consistent with a progenitor star-forming galaxy similar to NGC 6822, which is in the midst of a transition to a Sagittarius-like system. Notably, this evolutionary sequence can be accomplished through tidal processing alone, in galaxies that have experienced sufficiently bursty feedback to create cored profiles.
