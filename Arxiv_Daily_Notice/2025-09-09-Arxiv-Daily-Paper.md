 - **Abstract**
 Multiwavelength analyses of astrophysical transients are essential for understanding the physics of these events. To make such analyses more efficient and effective, we present the Open mulTiwavelength Transient Event Repository (OTTER), a publicly available catalog of published transient event metadata and photometry. Unlike previous efforts, our data schema is optimized for the storage of multiwavelength photometric datasets spanning the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Open source software, including an application programming interface (API) and web application, are available for viewing, accessing, and analyzing the dataset. For the initial release of OTTER, we present the largest ever photometric archive of tidal disruption events (TDEs), including $\gtrsim 80,000$ observations of 232 TDEs spanning from radio to X-ray wavelengths. We demonstrate the power of this infrastructure through four example analyses of the TDE population. We plan to maintain this dataset as more TDEs are discovered in the future and encourage other users to contribute by uploading newly published data via our web application. The infrastructure was built with the goal of archiving additional transient data (supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, fast blue optical transients, fast radio bursts, etc.) in the future. The web application is available at this https URL and the API documentation is available at this https URL.

 - **Abstract**
 The forthcoming GRAVITY+ instrument promises to usher in an era of "industrial-scale" mass measurements of isolated black holes (BHs), with the potential to assemble a sample of many tens of BHs via interferometric microlensing over several years. A key challenge will be selecting interferometric follow-up targets from an order-of-magnitude larger pool of ongoing microlensing events when using traditional selection based on event timescale alone. Gould (2023) proposed a criterion optimized for BH selection using space-based microlens parallax measurements enabled by a satellite. We adapt it to work with microlens parallax constraints obtainable from ground-based data only. Using Galactic simulations, we show that our selection criterion is highly efficient, expecting to detect about a dozen BHs per year with GRAVITY+ from following up ~35 selected events.

 - **Abstract**
 JWST has revealed a previously unknown population of low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the early Universe. These JWST-AGN at high redshifts are characterised by a set of peculiar properties, including unusually weak X-ray emission. Here we investigate the apparent lack of X-ray emission in the framework of the ``AGN radiative dusty feedback'' scenario based on the effective Eddington limit for dust. We analyse how the boundary in the $N_\mathrm{H} - \lambda$ plane, defined by the column density versus the Eddington ratio, is modified as a function of the dusty gas parameters (metallicity, dust grain size and composition). Low metallicity gas with little dust content tends to survive against radiation pressure, and likely accumulates in the nuclear region. We suggest that such dust-poor gas can provide long-lived absorption and may lead to heavy X-ray obscuration, as observed in early JWST-AGN. The blowout vs. stalling condition of the obscuring clouds indicates that higher metallicities are required to eject heavier column densities, while large columns of gas can stall in low metallicity environments. Therefore the metallicity may play a key role in the AGN radiative dusty feedback scenario. We discuss how other peculiar properties of JWST-AGN --such as Balmer absorption features and weak radio emission-- may be naturally interpreted within the same physical framework.
#### Gamma-ray lines, electron-positron annihilation, and possible radio emission in X-ray pulsars

 - **Abstract**
 Accretion onto neutron stars (NSs) in X-ray pulsars (XRPs) results in intense X-ray emission, and under specific conditions, high-energy nuclear interactions that produce gamma-ray photons at discrete energies. These interactions are enabled by the high free-fall velocities of accreting nuclei near the NS surface and give rise to characteristic gamma-ray lines, notably at 2.2 MeV, 5.5 MeV, and 67.5 MeV. We investigate the production mechanisms of these lines and estimate the resulting gamma-ray luminosities, accounting for the suppression effects of radiative deceleration in bright XRPs and the creation of electron-positron pairs in strong magnetic fields. The resulting annihilation of these pairs leads to a secondary emission line at $\sim 511$ keV. We also discuss the possibility that non-stationary pair creation in the polar cap region could drive coherent radio emission, though its detectability in accreting systems remains uncertain. Using a numerical framework incorporating general relativistic light bending and magnetic absorption, we compute the escape fraction of photons and distinguish between actual and apparent gamma-ray luminosities. Our results identify the parameter space - defined by magnetic field strength, accretion luminosity, and NS compactness - where these gamma-ray signatures may be observable by upcoming MeV gamma-ray missions. In particular, we highlight the diagnostic potential of detecting gravitationally redshifted gamma-ray lines and annihilation features for probing the mass-radius relation and magnetospheric structure of NSs.

 - **Abstract**
 New populations of red active galactic nuclei (known as ``Little Red Dots'') discovered by JWST exhibit remarkable spectral energy distributions. Leveraging X-ray through far-infrared observations of two of the most luminous known Little Red Dots, we directly their bolometric luminosities. We find evidence that more than half of the bolometric luminosity likely emerges in the rest-frame optical, with $L_{\rm bol}/L_{5100} = 5$, roughly half the value for ``standard'' Active Galactic Nuclei. Meanwhile, the X-ray emitting corona, UV-emitting black-body, and reprocessed mid to far-infrared emission are all considerably sub-dominant, assuming that the far-infrared luminosity is well below current measured limits. We present new bolometric corrections that dramatically lower inferred bolometric luminosities by a factor of ten compared to published values in the literature. These bolometric corrections are in accord with expectations from models in which gas absorption and reprocessing are responsible for the red rest-frame optical colors of Little Red Dots. We discuss how this lowered luminosity scale suggests a lower mass scale for the population by at least an order of magnitude {\bf (e.g., $\sim 10^5-10^7~{\rm M_{\odot}}$ black holes, and $\sim 10^8~{\rm M_{\odot}}$ galaxies)}, alleviating tensions with clustering, overmassive black holes, and the integrated black hole mass density in the Universe.
#### Super-slowly rotating Ap (ssrAp) stars: New spectroscopic observations

 - **Abstract**
 The rotation periods of Ap stars range over five to six orders of magnitude. The origin of their differentiation remains unknown. We carry out a systematic study of the longest period Ap stars to gain insight into their properties. We analyse newly obtained spectra of a sample of super-slowly rotating Ap (ssrAp) star candidates identified by a TESS photometric survey to confirm that their projected equatorial velocity v sin i is consistent with (very) long rotation periods, to obtain a first determination of their magnetic fields, and to test their binarity. The value of v sin i in 16 of the 18 studied stars is low enough for them to have moderately to extremely long rotation periods. All stars but one are definitely magnetic; for five of them, the magnetic field was detected for the first time. Five new stars with resolved magnetically split lines were discovered. Five stars that were not previously known to be spectroscopic binaries show radial velocity variations; in one of them, lines from both components are observed.
#### The possible accretion discs of GN-z11 at redshift z = 10.6, MoM-z14 at z = 14.44 and other high redshift objects

 - **Abstract**
 The JWST has enabled the discovery of Active Galactic Nuclei at high redshifts. The intrinsic UV spectrum of GN-z11 at redshift z = 10.6 has a spectral slope compatible with a standard accretion disc. By fitting a disc model to its spectrum, we find that the mass of the black hole must be above 1.6e7 Msun in order that it lies below the Eddington limit. We define this mass as the Eddington mass of the black hole. We note that the spectral shape is consistent with that of accreting stellar mass black holes sources in their soft state, for which no variability is expected. Mom-z14 is a more distant object at z = 14.44 and has a similar UV slope. Disc model-fitting gives a similar result but lower mass accretion rate. We also examine 3 further high redshift objects: GS z14-1, GHZ2 and GS-z11-1 at z = 13.86, 12.34 and 11.28, again obtaining similar results. If sub-Eddington accretion discs are indeed the origin of much of the UV emission from these objects, then the existence of massive black holes less than 440 and 290 Myr after the Big Bang point either to exceptional black hole seeds or to primordial black holes. The observed spread of UV spectral slopes in high redshift objects suggests that our approach may be relevant to about half of that population.

 - **Abstract**
 JWST has provided critical mid-infrared data for cold brown dwarfs. It has also provided low-resolution near-infrared spectra, and for faint sources these are the first spectra at these wavelengths. We use these data and other literature sources to synthesize near-infrared photometry on the MKO system for 19 T and Y dwarfs, on the Euclid system for 44 T and Y dwarfs, and on the Roman system for 48 T and Y dwarfs. We also synthesize Euclid I_E magnitudes for 15 T and Y dwarfs. Using the Beiler et al. 2024 observational effective temperatures (T_eff), together with ATMO 2020++ model colors, we show that the absolute 4.6um magnitude can be used as a proxy for T_eff. We present a polynomial fit to the M_W2:T_eff relationship for cool dwarfs with 250 < T_eff K < 1000. We select five Y dwarfs with 275 < T_eff K < 400 which have a range in near- to mid-infrared colors. Comparison of the JWST spectral energy distribution to ATMO 2020++ models indicate that Y dwarfs which are bluer in J - W2 are lower gravity or more metal-rich than their redder counterparts, with stronger CO and CO_2 absorption at 4.2 < lambda um < 4.9. The near-infrared color diagrams show significant scatter, with complex dependencies on T_eff, metallicity and gravity. In order to disentangle these effects, opacity sources for cool model atmospheres need to be more complete at lambda < 1um.
#### ATLAS Photometry of Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS

 - **Abstract**
 We present calibrated ATLAS photometry of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1) from 28 March through 29 Aug 2025, obtained with the five-site, robotic ATLAS network in the c (420-650~nm), o (560-820~nm), and Teide w (420-720~nm) bands. Stacked difference images yield reliable light curves measured in four fixed apertures that capture the evolving coma. We observe 3I/ATLAS transitioning in color from red (c-o)~0.7 before MJD 60860 to near-solar (c-o)~0.3 after MJD 60870, coincident with the appearance of a prominent anti-solar tail. The absolute magnitude curve H(t) shows a slope break near MJD 60890 at r~3.3 au from -0.035 to -0.014 mag/day, or in terms of coma cross section as a function of heliocentric distance, r^{-3.9} to r^{-1.2}. We interpret the evolution as a shift from dust lifted from a reddened surface to production of small, optically bright icy grains and changing coma optical depth. We release the aperture photometry with geometry and uncertainties to enable cross-instrument synthesis of 3I/ATLAS activity and color evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar eruptive events are complex phenomena, which most often include coronal mass ejections (CME), CME-driven compressive and shock waves, flares, and filament eruptions. CMEs are large eruptions of magnetized plasma from the Sun's outer atmosphere or corona, that propagate outward into the interplanetary space. Over the last several decades a large amount of remote solar eruption observational data has become available from ground-based and space-borne instruments. This has recently required the development of software approaches for automated characterisation of eruptive features. Most solar feature detection and tracking algorithms currently in use have restricted applicability and complicated processing chains, while complexity in engineering machine learning (ML) training sets limit the use of data-driven approaches for tracking or solar eruptive related phenomena. Recently, we introduced Wavetrack - a general algorithmic method for smart characterization and tracking of solar eruptive features. The method, based on a-trous wavelet decomposition, intensity rankings and a set of filtering techniques, allows to simplify and automate image processing and feature tracking. Previously, we applied the method successfully to several types of remote solar observations. Here we present the natural evolution of this approach. We discuss various aspects of applying Machine Learning (ML) techniques towards segmentation of high-dynamic range heliophysics observations. We trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) image segmentation models using feature masks obtained from the Wavetrack code. We present results from pre-trained models for segmentation of solar eruptive features and demonstrate their performance on a set of CME events based on SDO/AIA instrument data.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the nature of dark matter (DM) particles remains a pivotal challenge in modern cosmology. Current cosmological research on these phenomena primarily utilizes cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations and other late-time probes, which predominantly focus on large scales. We introduce a novel probe, the 21 cm forest signal, which can be used to investigate DM properties on small scales during the epoch of reionization, thereby addressing the gap left by other cosmological probes. Annihilation and decay of DM particles, as well as Hawking radiation from PBHs, can heat the intergalactic medium (IGM). This heating suppresses the amplitude of the 21 cm forest 1D power spectrum. Therefore, the 1D power spectrum provides an effective method for constraining DM properties. However, astrophysical heating processes in the early universe can also affect the 21 cm forest 1D power spectrum. In this work, we assess the potential of using the SKA to observe the 21 cm forest 1D power spectrum for constraining DM properties, under the assumption that astrophysical heating can be constrained reliably by other independent probes. Under low astrophysical heating conditions, the 1D power spectrum could constrain the DM annihilation cross section and decay lifetime to $\langle\sigma v\rangle \sim {10^{-31}}\,{\rm cm^{3}\,s^{-1}}$ and $\tau \sim {10^{30}}\,{\rm s}$ for ${10}\,{\rm GeV}$ DM particles, and probe PBHs with masses $\sim {10^{15}}\,{\rm\,g}$ at abundances $f_{\mathrm{PBH}} \simeq 10^{-13}$. These constraints represent improvements of 5-6 orders of magnitude over current limits. Furthermore, the 21 cm forest 1D power spectrum has the potential to exceed existing bounds on sub-GeV DM and to probe PBHs with masses above $10^{18}\,{\rm g}$, which are otherwise inaccessible by conventional cosmological probes.
#### Millimetre continuum from LBV stars and their environs. NIKA2 observations and Virtual Observatory data

 - **Abstract**
 Multi-wavelength studies of their circumstellar environments around LBVs are essential to quantify their feedback at Galactic scales. Dominant emission mechanisms at millimetre wavelengths are, however, still poorly understood. Stellar winds, circumstellar dust, and ionised gas have not been explored together in the case of LBVs. We aim to study the millimetre continuum emission of Galactic LBVs to disclose the presence of these components, to describe their morphology and to measure their relevance in the mass and energy injection to the interstellar medium. We have used the NIKA2 continuum camera at the IRAM 30-m radio telescope to observe and analyse 1.15 and 2 mm continuum from the LBVs HD168607, HD168625, MN87, MN101, and G79.29+0.46. We used Virtual Observatory to complement our observations with archival data from optical, infrared, mm- and cm-wavelengths. With this information, we have built complete SEDs for the five sources, covering six decades of the electromagnetic spectrum. All targets except MN87 were detected at both wavelengths, with features including compact sources, extended nebular emission, shells, and unrelated background structures. Spectral indices of compact sources are consistent with thermal emission from stellar winds. We modelled the SEDs and successfully reproduced the emission from stellar photospheres, circumstellar dust, thermal stellar winds and enshrouding HII regions. Our models, in agreement with previous literature results, reveal the presence of unresolved hot dust very close to the stars and provide the first estimates for the fundamental parameters of MN101. This pilot study highlights the great potential of millimetre continuum studies of LBVs and possibly other evolved massive stars. The mm spectral window bridges the far-IR and radio regimes and can disclose the relative contribution of dust and free-free emission in this kind of sources.
#### Probing baryonic feedback and cosmology with 3$\times$2-point statistic of FRBs and galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 The impact of galaxy formation processes on the matter power spectrum is uncertain and may bias cosmological parameters inferred by large-scale structure surveys. Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), through their dispersion measures (DMs) encoding the integrated column density of baryons, offer a unique window into the distribution of gas. In this work, we investigate the constraining power of a 3x2-point correlation statistic of FRB DMs and galaxies. We present the correlation formalism, derive covariance matrices and forecast signal-to-noise ratios and Fisher parameter constraints. Assuming host galaxy DM variance of 90 pc cm$^{-3}$, for $10^4$ ($10^5$) FRBs across 35% of the sky, the angular DM power spectrum is noise dominated at multipoles $\ell \gtrsim 20$ ($\ell \gtrsim 100$), which implies that the analysis can be conducted using arcmin-scale localizations, where the redshift distribution of the FRB population can be modeled through the FRB luminosity function or FRB position cross-correlations with galaxies. We show that while $10^4$ ($10^5$) FRB DM correlations can constrain cosmological parameters at 40-70% (30-40%) level, this is a factor of 2-3 (1.5-2) weaker than the precision attainable with galaxy clustering alone due to shot noise from the limited FRB number density, variance of the field and host DMs. On the contrary, feedback-sensitive scales are not accessible in galaxy surveys. We demonstrate that combining FRB DMs and galaxies auto- and cross-correlations in a 3x2-point analysis breaks feedback-cosmology degeneracies, yielding 10-18% (7-13%) precision on cosmological parameters and 3% (2%) constraints on feedback using $10^4$ ($10^5$) FRBs. This work positions the 3x2-point statistic of FRB DMs and galaxies as a promising multi-probe strategy, bridging the gap between constraining astrophysical feedback models and precise measurement of cosmological parameters.
#### Reassessing the Spin of Second-born Black Holes in Coalescing Binary Black Holes and Its Connection to the chi_eff-q Correlation

 - **Abstract**
 The mass ratio q and effective inspiral spin chi_eff of binary black hole mergers in GWTC-4.0 have been reported to display a weakeran ti-correlation compared to GWTC-3, a feature whose origin has been explored by several groups. In this work, within the isolated binary evolution framework, we adopt a recently proposed wind prescription for helium stars to systematically investigate the spin of the second-born black hole and its role in shaping this correlation. Using the stellar and binary evolution code MESA, which includes a recently proposed helium-star wind prescription alongside internal differential rotation and tidal interactions,we find that the recently proposed wind prescription for helium stars is substantially weaker than the standard Dutch wind scheme, particularly at subsolar metallicity. Using this scheme, we perform detailed binary modeling of a helium star with a black hole companion. Our results show that the spin magnitude of the resulting black hole is insensitive to the helium star's evolutionary stage at the onset of tidal interactions or to the companion mass. Instead, wind mass loss plays the dominant role: more massive helium-star progenitors produce lower-spinning black holes. The initial stellar rotation has only a minor effect, especially under strong tidal coupling, consistent with the common assumption of orbital synchronization. Using the derived relation between the mass and spin of the second-born black hole, we find that the properties of most binary black holes in GWTC-4.0-specifically the mass ratio q and effective inspiral spin chi_eff-can be reproduced. We further show that the q-chi_eff correlation is sensitive to the assumed mass function (e.g., Gaussian and uniform distribution), displaying notable deviations from the Power-Law+Peak model.

 - **Abstract**
 The multi-scale structure of the solar surface magnetic field is essential for understanding both the Sun's internal dynamo processes and its external magnetic activity. The surface flux transport (SFT) model has been successful in describing the large-scale evolution of the surface field, but its ability to capture observed multi-scale features, quantified by magnetic power spectra, remains uncertain. Here, we evaluate the SFT model by comparing observed and simulated power spectra across a broad range of spatial scales and by analyzing the effects of key transport parameters. We find that the simulations reproduce the observed spectra well at spherical harmonic degrees $l\lesssim60$, but diverge progressively at smaller spatial scales $l\gtrsim60$. This divergence likely arises from the diffusion approximation used to model the random walk of supergranulation. Power at $20 \lesssim l \lesssim 60$ is primarily determined by the magnetic flux sources, while at $l \lesssim 20$, the spectra are more sensitive to transport parameters. The meridional flow profile, including its equatorial gradient, peak latitude, and polar distribution, along with turbulent diffusivity, has distinct impacts on the low-degree modes ($l \leq 5$). In particular, a comparison of the $l$=3 and $l$=5 multipoles strengths suggests that the poleward flow above $\sim\pm60^\circ$ latitudes is very weak. This study presents the first quantitative validation of SFT models using magnetic power spectra and provides new constraints on surface flux transport physics.

 - **Abstract**
 Several Algol-type binaries were detected to be experiencing rapid orbital decay, which is in contradiction with the conservative mass transfer model.} In this work, we investigate whether anomalous magnetic braking (MB) of intermediate-mass Ap/Bp stars, characterized by surface magnetic fields of $\sim10^2 \mathendash 10^4~\rm G$, could drive orbital decay through magnetic wind-field coupling. Using the stellar evolution code {\ttfamily MESA}, we simulate the evolution of several \add{main-sequence binaries containing Ap/Bp stars}, with typical initial parameters \add{of Algol binaries}. Our models indicate that the anomalous MB mechanism could induce orbital decay in long timescales (hundreds of Myr to several Gyr), \add{reproducing several basic Algol parameters such as the effective temperatures and luminosities of donor stars. However, the predicted orbital period decay rates are much lower than those observed in several Algol systems. We analyze the limitations of the anomalous MB model and discuss alternative mechanisms that could account for the long- or short-term orbital period variations observed in Algol systems, including a surrounding circumbinary disk, stellar expansion, the Applegate mechanism, and the light travel-time effect. Long-term observations are still required to distinguish between these mechanisms in the future.

 POEMMA Balloon with Radio (PBR) is a NASA super-pressure balloon mission building toward the proposed Probe Of Extreme Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (POEMMA) dual satellite mission. In its planned 2027 launch, PBR will study Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays, Neutrinos, and High-Altitude Horizontal Airshowers from 33 km above the Earth. By operating at balloon altitudes, PBR will provide a novel vantage point to study air-shower physics while offering competitive instantaneous exposure to neutrinos from transient astrophysical phenomena. The payload's optical instrument is a 0.95 m$^2$ aperture hybrid Schmidt telescope with a 3.81 m$^2$ segmented mirror focusing light onto a Fluorescence Camera and a bi-focalized Cherenkov Camera. The payload will also feature a Radio Instrument consisting of two sinuous antennas based on the Payload for Ultrahigh Energy Observations (PUEO) low-frequency instrument. A combined gamma ray/x-ray detector and IR cloud camera round out the instrumentation package, meaning PBR will be the first multi-hybrid balloon-borne multi-messenger observatory flown. This extensive instrumentation must be combined into a radio quiet payload that satisfies the scientific needs and can operate in near vacuum at extreme temperatures, all while meeting NASA safety requirements and weighing no more than 3000 lbs (1361 kg). Accomplishing these tasks together will mark a significant step toward establishing technological readiness for the POEMMA satellite mission. We present an overview of PBR's mechanical and optical systems, additionally detailing our strategies to mitigate electromagnetic interference for the radio instrument and prepare for the harsh near-space environment.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the nonlinear evolution of the magnetic buoyancy instability in rotating and non-rotating gas layers using numerical solutions of non-ideal, isothermal MHD equations. The unstable magnetic field is either imposed through the boundary conditions or generated by an imposed $\alpha$-effect. In the case of an imposed field, we solve for the deviations from the background state with periodic boundary conditions. We also include cosmic rays as a weightless fluid which exerts a dynamically significant pressure and amplifies magnetic buoyancy, known as the Parker instability. Without rotation, systems with an imposed magnetic field evolve to a state with a very weak magnetic field, very different from the marginally stable eigenfunction, where the gas layer eventually becomes very thin as it is supported by thermal and turbulent pressures alone. However, this does not happen when the $\alpha$-effect maintains the magnetic field. Rotation fundamentally changes the development of the instability. A rotating system develops nonlinear oscillations, and the magnetic field direction changes even with an imposed magnetic field. We demonstrate that the cause is a secondary $\alpha$-effect at large altitudes as the gas flow produced by the instability becomes helical. The secondary $\alpha$-effect has an anomalous sign with the $\alpha$-coefficient being negative in the northern hemisphere, whereas the Coriolis force produces a positive $\alpha$. The mean-field dynamo action outside the original gas layer can also lead to a switch in the magnetic field parity from quadrupolar to dipolar. Altogether, the magnetic buoyancy instability and the mean-field dynamo action become separated as distinct physical effects in a nonlinear rotating system. We show that none of the assumptions used in analytic studies of the Parker instability is corroborated by numerical results.

 - **Abstract**
 The Wang-Sheeley-Arge (WSA) model has been the cornerstone of operational solar wind forecasting for nearly two decades, owing to its simplicity and physics-based formalism. However, its performance is strongly dependent on several empirical parameters that are typically fixed or tuned manually, limiting its adaptability across varying solar conditions. In this study, we present a neural enhancement to the WSA framework (referred to as WSA+) that systematically optimizes the empirical parameters of the WSA solar wind speed relation using in-situ observations within a differentiable physics-constrained pipeline. The approach operates in two stages: first, a neural optimizer adjusts WSA parameters independently for each Carrington Rotation to better match the observed solar wind data. Then, a neural network learns to predict these optimized speed maps directly from magnetogram-derived features. This enables generalization of the optimization process and allows inference for new solar conditions without manual tuning. The developed WSA+ preserves the interpretability of the original relation while significantly improving the match with OMNI in-situ data across multiple performance metrics, including correlation and error statistics. It consistently outperforms the traditional WSA relation across both low and high solar activity periods, with average improvements of approximately 40 percent. By integrating data-driven learning with physical constraints, WSA+ offers a robust and adaptable enhancement, with immediate utility as a drop-in replacement in global heliospheric modeling pipelines.

 - **Abstract**
 The traditional model which assumed GRBs as originating from a single Black Hole (BH) have been modified by the Binary Driven Hypernova (BdHN) model in which the trigger of the GRB originate from a binary system composed of a 10 solar mass CO core and a 2 solar mass neutron star binary companion. The binary period being as short as minutes to hours. Recent results evidence that the most energetic GRBs may have as precursors a sequence of two types of SN: a pair-SN followed soon after by a more traditional core collapse. All this appear to open the way to two new types of SNe: the Pair-SNe without a remnant and a magnetized-rotating-core collapse leading to the formation of a pulsar. We generalize our previous assumptions, here the possibility of fission of the rapidly rotating CO core is examined. The role of the magnetic field of the CO core are equally examined with the magneto-hydrodynamic associated process, all the way to generate overcritical fields and e+ e- pairs. All this appear to open the way to a new types of SN, much in line with pair-SN models and a significant change from the initial non rotating models. The BdHN are characterized by seven new physics Episodes here all used to formulate the new approach. The substantial modification of each Episode are outlined by a leading order treatment.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic reconnection is an important driving mechanism of many chromospheric phenomena, e.g., UV bursts and chromospheric jets. Information about magnetic field is indispensable for analyzing chromospheric magnetic reconnection, which is mainly encoded in polarization signals. The purpose of this work is to predict possible Stokes features related to chromospheric reconnection events, from realistic two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulation and Stokes profile synthesis. An emerging magnetic flux sheet is imposed at the bottom boundary of a well-relaxed unipolar atmosphere that spans from the upper convection zone to the corona. The reconnection region is heated to $\sim$7 kK and the outflow velocity reaches up to $\sim$35 km s$^{-1}$. Through Stokes profile synthesis, several Stokes features related to reconnections and plasmoids are reproduced. We found sign reversal features on circular polarization and amplitude reduction features on linear polarization at reconnection sites. Also, we report strong linear and circular polarization signals corresponding to huge ($\sim$300 km) and tiny ($\sim$40 km) plasmoids, respectively. We conclude that both linear and circular polarization signals may reveal the distinctive physical mechanisms in reconnections, and enhance the understanding of magnetic reconnection in observations.

 - **Abstract**
 In high-energy astrophysics, interpreting observed spectra hinges on understanding the competition between energy gains and radiative losses. To progress along these lines, we report on particle-in-cell simulations of particle acceleration in relativistic, magnetized turbulent pair plasmas including synchrotron radiative losses. Our key finding is that the particle energy spectrum does not terminate at this maximal energy but extends beyond with a steepened spectrum, up to the synchrotron burn-off limit where particles cool within a gyrotime. For our adopted parameters (magnetization $\sigma \approx 1 $ and amplitude $\delta B/B_0\simeq 1$), the particle distribution follows ${\rm d}n/{\rm d}\gamma\propto \gamma^{-s}$ with $s\simeq 3$ below the predicted maximal energy, then steepens to $s\simeq 4$ above. The particle distribution and the radiated synchrotron spectra display strong variability near the cutoff energy down to timescales well below the largest eddy turn-around time. We substantiate our results by demonstrating that the acceleration rate itself displays a broken powerlaw-like distribution whose maximal value is the gyrofrequency. The highest energy particles are accelerated by a generalized Fermi process in ideal electric fields, driven by a gradient of the $4$--velocity field $u_E$ of the magnetic field lines of relativistic amplitude, $\delta u_E \gtrsim c$, ordered on a scale comparable to the particle gyroradius. We contend that this is a generic feature of relativistic, large-amplitude turbulence. Lastly, we apply our results to the Crab nebula, which exhibits a hierarchy of characteristic Lorentz factors similar to that studied here. We conclude that stochastic acceleration in this environment is a promising mechanism for explaining the highest-energy part of the synchrotron spectral energy distribution, and its variability.

 - **Abstract**
 Based on archival Chandra X-ray observation, optical integral-field spectroscopic data and radio interferometric data, we report the discovery of a pair of giant bubbles (with a projected radius ~ 5 kpc) of ionized gas emerging from a highly inclined starburst galaxy NGC 6286, which is undergoing strong tidal interactions with its close neighbor NGC 6285. The bubbles are manifested by extraplanar soft X-ray emission with an X-shaped morphology, which is tightly co-spatial with $\rm H\alpha$ line emission and partially coincident with radio continuum. Low surface brightness diffuse X-ray emission can be traced out to ~ 90 kpc from the galactic center, revealing the presence of an extended hot gaseous halo. X-ray spectral analysis of the bubbles yields a gas temperature of $0.70^{+0.16}_{-0.18}$ keV, a relatively high value among known galactic-scale bubbles in the local universe. An average energy injection rate of ~ $10^{43}$ erg $\rm s^{-1}$ is required to inflate the bubbles within an estimated dynamical age of ~ 6.4 Myr. The multi-wavelength properties of the bubbles can be understood with the conventional superwind scenario, in which disk/halo gas is swept up into an expanding, cooling shell by a hot tenuous wind. The current starburst in NGC 6286 is energetically sufficient to launch the superwind, although we cannot rule out the possibility of a more violent AGN in the recent past as the driving source. Future high-resolution spectroscopic observations will help to shed light on the origin of the superwind and its role as an important galactic feedback process.

 - **Abstract**
 Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are known to drive ionized gas into their host galaxies, which may affect the evolution of both the central supermassive black holes and their hosts. In the case of NGC 3516, a nearby Seyfert 1 galaxy, these AGN winds have historically proven difficult to disentangle from galactic rotation. Using long slit spectroscopy at multiple position angles from the Hubble Space Telescope Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph and the Apache Point Observatory Kitt Peak Ohio State Multi Object Spectrograph, we separate these kinematic components by fitting multiple Gaussians to the H{\alpha}, N II, H{\beta}, and O III emission lines along the slits. We present a biconical outflow model that agrees well with the observed kinematics of the outflowing gas in the narrow-line region (NLR). Our results indicate that the structure of the O III emission is explained by dusty gas spirals in the galactic disk that are illuminated by the ionizing bicone, which is viewed along one edge, resulting in the complex nuclear kinematics. Our view into the bicone edge is consistent with the multiple, deep components of ionized absorption lines seen in UV and X-ray spectra of NGC 3516. The observed turnover in the velocity of the NLR clouds matches that from a simple dynamical model of radiative acceleration by the AGN and gravitational deceleration by the AGN and galaxy, indicating they are the principal forces at work on the gas clouds. Finally, the model launch radii indicate that the outflowing clouds originate primarily from the inner dusty spirals near the AGN.

 - **Abstract**
 Black hole X-ray binaries (BH XRBs) launch powerful relativistic jets during bright outburst phases. The properties of these outflows change dramatically between different spectral/accretion states. Collimated, compact jets are observed during the hard state and are quenched during the soft state, while discrete ejecta are mainly launched during the hard-to-soft state transition. Currently, we still do not understand what triggers the formation and destruction of compact jets or the launch of discrete ejecta. In this context, finding a unique link between the jet evolution and the properties of the X-ray emission, such as its fast variability, would imply a major progress in our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms that drive relativistic outflows in BH XRBs. Here we show that a brief but strong radio re-brightening during a predominantly soft state of the BH XRB MAXI J1348$-$630 was contemporaneous with a significant increase in the X-ray rms variability observed with NICER in 2019. During this phase, the variability displayed significant changes and, at the same time, MAXI J1348$-$630 launched two pairs of relativistic discrete ejecta that we detected with the MeerKAT and ATCA radio-interferometers. We propose that short-lived compact jets were reactivated during this excursion to the hard-intermediate state and were switched off before the ejecta launch, a phenomenology that has been very rarely observed in these systems. Interestingly, with the caveat of gaps in our radio and X-ray coverage, we suggest a tentative correspondence between the launch of ejecta and the drop in X-ray rms variability in this source, while other typical X-ray signatures associated with discrete ejections are not detected. We discuss how these results provide us with insights into the complex and dynamic coupling between the jets and hot corona in BH XRBs.

 - **Abstract**
 The most significant excess in the arrival directions of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays with energies $\gtrsim40\,\mathrm{EeV}$ is found in the direction of several interesting source candidates, most prominently the nearby radio galaxy Centaurus A. Naturally, Cen A has been suspected to create the anisotropy - but very different scenarios have been proposed. This includes a subdominant source contribution in combination with isotropic background sources, as well as a scenario where Cen A supplies the whole cosmic-ray flux above the ankle. Recently, it was suggested that the overdensity could instead consist of strongly deflected events from the Sombrero galaxy. Thanks to the recent development of several models of the Galactic magnetic field, it is now possible to test these proposed scenarios explicitly. Leveraging the measured overdensity direction, significance, angular scale, and energy evolution, we place limits on the allowed signal fraction, the possible ejected charge number and the strength of the extragalactic magnetic field between the respective source and Earth. We find that the scenario of a subdominant source in the overdensity region requires the charge number to be $Z\lesssim6$ and the extragalactic magnetic field quantity $B/\mathrm{nG} \sqrt{L_c/\mathrm{nG}}$ to be between $~1$ and $~100$. For the Sombrero galaxy to be the source, the dominant charge number has to be around $Z=6$ with $1\lesssim B/\mathrm{nG} \sqrt{L_c/\mathrm{nG}}\lesssim20$. We find that a scenario where all the flux above $30\,\mathrm{EeV}$ is supplied by Cen A or M83 is possible for $20\lesssim B/\mathrm{nG} \sqrt{L_c/\mathrm{nG}}\lesssim30$ and a mixed composition - explaining both the Centaurus region excess and the distribution of the highest-energy events - however, another contributing source is possibly required in the energy range $<30\,\mathrm{EeV}$.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the analysis of the stellar and interstellar medium (ISM) properties of MARTA-4327, a star-forming galaxy at z=2.224 observed by means of deep JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy in both medium- and high-resolution gratings as part of the "Measuring Abundances at high Redshift with the Te Approach" (MARTA) programme. We report one of the highest-redshift detections of the Wolf-Rayet (WR) blue and red bumps in a non-lensed system. The broad He ii${\lambda}$4686 feature is consistent with a young (${\sim 5-6}$ Myr) burst dominated by WN stars, although both SSP models and empirical templates struggle to reproduce the nitrogen stellar features at ${\approx}$ 4640 A. Based on the relative strength of the available optical stellar features, we disfavor the presence of very massive stars (VMS) in this system. Elemental abundance ratios such as Ne/O, N/O, and Ar/O align with observations of local star-forming galaxies (including WR galaxies), suggesting that any impact of the WR population on the chemical enrichment of the ISM is strongly localized. However, the gas-phase Fe/O ratio appears enhanced compared to local galaxies of similar metallicity, which we interpret as evidence for reduced Fe depletion onto dust grains, possibly linked to localized destruction in WR-driven wind environments. In addition, we detect a broad and blueshifted (~70 km/s) H${\alpha}$ component, revealing the presence of an ionized outflow with a mass loading factor ${\eta \sim 0.2}$. Finally, we report the robust detection of O I${\lambda}$8446 emission (among the first at high redshift), which we interpret as originating from Ly${\beta}$ fluorescence and/or collisional excitation in dense clumps. Overall, MARTA-4327 represents a unique system for studying the role of massive stars in shaping the ISM in galaxies at Cosmic Noon.

 - **Abstract**
 Radio continuum emission provides a unique opportunity to study star-formation unbiased by dust obscuration. However, if radio observations are to be used to accurately trace star-formation to high redshifts, it is crucial that the physical processes which affect the radio emission from star-forming galaxies are well understood. While inverse Compton (IC) losses from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) are negligible in the local universe, the rapid increase in the strength of the CMB energy density with redshift [$\sim (1+z)^4$] means that this effect becomes increasingly important at $z\gtrsim3$. Using a sample of ~200,000 high-redshift (3 < z < 5) Lyman-break galaxies selected in the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV), we have stacked radio observations from the MIGHTEE survey to estimate their 1.4-GHz flux densities. We find that for a given rest-frame UV magnitude, the 1.4-GHz flux density and luminosity decrease with redshift. We compare these results to the theoretical predicted effect of energy losses due to inverse Compton scattering off the CMB, and find that the observed decrease is consistent with this explanation. We discuss other possible causes for the observed decrease in radio flux density with redshift at a given UV magnitude, such as a top-heavy initial mass function at high redshift or an evolution of the dust properties, but suggest that inverse Compton scattering is the most compelling explanation.

 - **Abstract**
 The strong magnetic fields of neutron stars are closely linked to their observed thermal, spectral, and timing properties, such as the distribution of spin periods and their derivatives. To understand the evolution of astrophysical observables over time, it is essential to develop robust theoretical frameworks and numerical models that solve the coupled thermal and magnetic field evolution equations, incorporating detailed microphysical inputs like thermal and electrical conductivities and neutrino emission rates. These efforts are key to uncovering how the strength and geometry of magnetic fields change with age, ultimately shedding light on the diverse phenomenology of neutron stars. In this review, we outline the fundamental theory underlying magneto-thermal evolution models, with an emphasis on numerical methods and a comprehensive set of benchmark tests intended to guide current and future code development. We revisit established results from axisymmetric simulations, highlight recent progress in fully three-dimensional models, and offer a perspective on the anticipated developments in this rapidly evolving field.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar jets, characterized by small-scale plasma ejections along open magnetic field lines or the legs of large-scale coronal loops, play a crucial role in the dynamics of the solar atmosphere. Although spectral and EUV images have been widely used to analyze the formation and evolution of jets, the detailed 3D structure at the base of the jet has not been studied in detail due to the limitations in the spatial resolution of observations. Solar Orbiter enables us to investigate the structure of solar jets with much higher spatial and temporal resolutions and from a different angle than from Earth. By combining observations made by instruments onboard Solar Orbiter with data from the SDO, we analyzed recurrent solar jets originating in a mixed-polarity region near an active region. Additionally, we employed potential field and magnetohydrostatic extrapolation techniques to determine the magnetic field topology associated with the jets. The jets display dynamic, multi-strand outflows emanating from compact bright kernels above the magnetic inversion line, with apparent speeds exceeding 100 km/s. Magnetic field evolution reveals continuous flux cancellation at the jet footpoints. Throughout the sequence, base flows are confined within quasi-separatrix layers, with the highest velocities and temperatures located near coronal null points. Over four eruptions, the magnetic topology evolves from a simple fan-spine configuration with a single null to a more complex dome-shaped base containing multiple nulls with separatrix curtain, accompanied by a morphological transition from narrow, well-collimated spire to broader, fragmented outflows. These results provide the first direct observational evidence that dynamic changes in null-point geometry modulate jet morphology and energetics via successive reconnection episodes.

 - **Abstract**
 In this review, the methodology of large eddy simulations (LES) is introduced and applications in astrophysics are discussed. As theoretical framework, the scale decomposition of the dynamical equations for compressible neutral fluids by means of spatial filtering is explained. For cosmological applications, the filtered equations in co-moving coordinates are formulated. Moreover, the decomposition is extended to magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). While energy is dissipated through numerical diffusivities in implicit large eddy simulations (ILES), explicit subgrid-scale (SGS) models are applied in LES to compute energy dissipation, mixing, and dynamo action due to numerically unresolved turbulent eddies. The most commonly used models in astrophysics are the Smagorinsky model, the hydrodynamical SGS turbulence energy equation model, and the non-linear structural model for both non-relativistic and relativistic MHD. Model validation is carried out a priori by testing correlations between model and data for specific terms or a posteriori by comparing turbulence statistics in LES and ILES. Since most solvers in astrophysical simulation codes have significant numerical diffusion, the additional effect of SGS models is generally small. However, convergence with resolution increases in some cases. A recent example is magnetic field amplification in binary neutron star mergers. For mesh-free codes, it has been shown that explicit modelling of turbulent diffusion of metals has a significant impact. Moreover, SGS models can help to compute the turbulent velocity dispersion consistently and to parameterize sub-resolution processes that are influenced by turbulence, such as the star formation efficiency in galaxy simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 The kinematics of the Milky Way bulge is known to be complex, reflecting the presence of multiple stellar components with distinct chemical and spatial properties. In particular, the bulge hosts a bar structure exhibiting cylindrical rotation, and a central velocity dispersion peak extending vertically along the Galactic latitude. However, due to severe extinction and crowding, observational constraints near the Galactic plane are sparse, underscoring the need for additional data to improve the completeness and accuracy of existing kinematic maps, and enabling robust comparison with dynamical models. This work aimed to refine the existing analytical models of the Galactic bulge kinematics by improving constraints in the innermost regions. We present updated maps of the mean velocity and velocity dispersion by incorporating new data near the Galactic plane. We combined radial velocity measurements from the GIBS and APOGEE surveys with both previously published and newly acquired MUSE observations. A custom\ -- developed Python\ -- based tool, {\tt PHOTfun}, was used to extract spectra from MUSE datacubes using PSF photometry based on DAOPHOT-II, with an integrated GUI for usability. The method included a dedicated extension, {\tt PHOTcube}, optimized for IFU datacubes. We applied Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques to identify and correct for foreground contamination and to derive new analytical fits for the velocity and velocity dispersion distributions. Our analysis included nine new MUSE fields located close to the Galactic plane, bringing the total number of mapped fields to 57 including ~23000 individual RV measured. The updated kinematic maps confirm the cylindrical rotation of the bulge and reveal a more boxy morphology in the velocity dispersion distribution, while preserving a well\ -- defined central peak.

 - **Abstract**
 The stellar initial mass function (sIMF) describes the distribution of stellar masses formed in a single star formation event in a molecular cloud clump. It is fundamental to astrophysics and cosmology, shaping our understanding of unresolved stellar populations, galactic chemical enrichment and habitable zones, and black hole growth. This White Paper reviews studies on the core mass function, stellar multiplicity, and dynamical processes affecting sIMF determinations, as well as the link between star-forming clumps and the galaxy-wide IMF (gIMF). The evidence gleaned from observed systems for the dependency of the sIMF on the metallicity and density of the clump is portrayed. We examine evidence from gravitational lensing, stellar and gas kinematics, and spectral diagnostics to assess environmental dependencies of the gIMF. Theoretical perspectives provide further insights into the sIMF's variability. Beyond summarizing current knowledge, this work aims to establish a shared framework and define strategies for studying a variable IMF in the era of near-infrared integral-field spectroscopy, 30m-class telescopes and major space-based observatories.

 - **Abstract**
 Adaptive binning is a crucial step in the analysis of large astronomical datasets, such as those from integral-field spectroscopy, to ensure a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) for reliable model fitting. However, the widely used Voronoi-binning method and its variants suffer from two key limitations: they scale poorly with data size, often as O(N^2), creating a computational bottleneck for modern surveys, and they can produce undesirable non-convex or disconnected bins. I introduce PowerBin, a new algorithm that overcomes these issues. I frame the binning problem within the theory of optimal transport, for which the solution is a Centroidal Power Diagram (CPD), guaranteeing convex bins. Instead of formal CPD solvers, which are unstable with real data, I develop a fast and robust heuristic based on a physical analogy of packed soap bubbles. This method reliably enforces capacity constraints even for non-additive measures like S/N with correlated noise. I also present a new bin-accretion algorithm with O(N log N) complexity, removing the previous bottleneck. The combined PowerBin algorithm scales as O(N log N), making it about two orders of magnitude faster than previous methods on million-pixel datasets. I demonstrate its performance on a range of simulated and real data, showing it produces high-quality, convex tessellations with excellent S/N uniformity. The public Python implementation provides a fast, robust, and scalable tool for the analysis of modern astronomical data.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the X-ray quiescent and flaring properties from a unique, 7-day multiwavelength observing campaign on the M1 flare star AU Mic. Combining the XMM-Newton X-ray spectra with the chromospheric line and broadband NUV and optical continuum observations provides a dataset that is one of the most comprehensive to date. We analyze the sample of 38 X-ray flares and study in detail the X-ray flare temperature ($T$) and emission measure (EM) evolutions of three largest flares with the X-ray flare energies of $>10^{33}$ erg. The $T-\mathrm{EM}$ evolution tracks and multi-wavelength emission evolutions of the largest-amplitude Neupert-type flare reveal that the so-called ``Flare H-R diagram" is consistent with thermal coronal flare emission evolution. The two other more gradual and longer duration X-ray flares are interpreted as having larger size scales. None of the 17 H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ flares show clear blue/red wing asymmetries, including the ones associated with the potential X-ray dimming event previously reported. The above largest-amplitude Neupert flare shows clear symmetric H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ broadenings with roughly $\pm$400 and $\pm$600 km s$^{-1}$, respectively, which are synchronized with the optical/NUV continuum emission evolution. Radiative hydrodynamic modeling results suggest that electron beam heating parameters that have been used to reproduce M-dwarf flare NUV/optical continuum emissions can reproduce these large broadenings of H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ lines. These results suggest that these most energetic M-dwarf flares are associated with stronger magnetic field flux densities and larger size scales than solar flares but can be interpreted in terms of the standard flare model.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Understanding the demographics of white dwarf - main sequence (WDMS) binaries is key to uncovering the formation of various stellar exotica and refining the details of binary stellar evolution. Despite several dedicated efforts to identify unresolved WDMS binaries, their population remains incomplete, even within a 100 pc volume-limited sample. Aims. This study aims to identify WDMS binaries hidden within the main sequence of the optical color-magnitude diagram (CMD), improving the completeness of WDMS binaries within a volume-limited sample of 100 pc. Methods. We use NUV-optical CMDs to distinguish unresolved WDMS binaries from the rest of the populations. High-precision astrometric and photometric data from Gaia DR3 and NUV data from GALEX GR6/7 are combined to construct CMDs. Using the binary spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting algorithm within the Virtual Observatory SED Analyzer (VOSA) tool, we estimate stellar parameters such as effective temperature, bolometric luminosity, and radii. The masses of the WD companions are determined using white dwarf evolutionary models. As we use the sources which are detected only in NUV band of GALEX, this study directly complements to majority of the previous studies. Results. We identify 596 WD-MS binary candidates within 100 pc, with 497 newly reported. Our method predominantly identifies binaries with cooler WD companions (median ~7,000 K) compared to previous studies. The WD masses range from ~0.2 and 1.3 M$_\odot$, and most MS companions are of M spectral type.

 - **Abstract**
 We select a mass-complete sample of 225 quiescent galaxies at $z>2$ with $M_* > 10^{10}\ \mathrm{M}_\odot$ from PRIMER and JADES photometry spanning a total area of $\simeq320$ sq. arcmin. We restrict our analysis to only area with optical coverage in three $HST$ ACS filters, and provide evidence that this is important for selecting the most complete and clean samples of $z>2$ massive quiescent galaxy candidates. We investigate the contamination in our sample via $JWST$ NIRSpec spectroscopic validation, $Chandra$ X-ray imaging, and ALMA interferometry, calculating a modest total contamination fraction of $12.9_{-3.1}^{+4.0}$ per cent. The removal of $HST$ data increases star-forming galaxy contamination by $\simeq10$ per cent and results in a $\simeq20$ per cent loss of candidates recovered from $HST$+$JWST$ data combined. We calculate massive quiescent galaxy number densities at $2<z<5$, finding values three times larger than pre-$JWST$ estimates, but generally in agreement with more-recent and larger-area $JWST$ studies. In comparison with galaxy evolution simulations, we find that most can now reproduce the observed massive quiescent galaxy number density at $2<z<3$, however they still increasingly fall short at $z>3$, with discrepancies of up to $\simeq 1$ dex. We place 14 of our $z>3$ massive quiescent galaxies on the BPT and WHaN diagrams using medium-resolution spectroscopic data from the EXCELS survey. We find a very high incidence of faint AGN in our sample, at a level of $\simeq50$ per cent, consistent with recent results at cosmic noon. This is interesting in the context of maintenance-mode feedback, which is invoked in many simulations to prevent quenched galaxies from re-igniting star formation. To properly characterise the evolution of early massive quiescent galaxies, greater coverage in optical filters and significantly larger spectroscopic samples will be required.
#### Black-hole mass estimation through accretion disk spectral fitting for high-redshift blazars

 - **Abstract**
 High-redshift ($z>2$) blazars, with relativistic jets aligned toward us, probe the most powerful end of the active galactic nuclei (AGN) population. We aim at determining the black hole masses and mass accretion rates of high-$z$ blazars in a common framework that utilizes a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) fitting method and the Shakura-Sunayev multi-temperature accretion disk model, accounting also for attenuation due to neutral hydrogen gas in the intergalactic medium (IGM). We compiled a sample of 23 high-redshift blazars from the literature with publicly available infrared-to-ultraviolet photometric data. We performed a Bayesian fit to the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the accretion disk, accounting for upper limits, and determined the black hole masses and mass accretion rates with their uncertainties. We also examined the impact of optical-ultraviolet attenuation due to gas in the IGM. We find that neglecting IGM attenuation in SED fits leads to systematically larger black-hole mass estimates and correspondingly lower Eddington ratios, with the bias becoming more severe at higher redshift. Our MCMC fits yield median black-hole masses in the range $\sim (10^{8}-10^{10})\,M_{\odot}$ and a broad distribution of median Eddington ratios ($\lambda_{\rm Edd}\sim 0.04 - 1$). Comparison with previous literature shows no clear method-dependent systematic offsets, although individual mass estimates can differ by up to a factor of a few. We also demonstrate that assumptions about black-hole spin introduce a systematic degeneracy. This work is to our knowledge the first systematic study to model the accretion-disk emission of a large sample of high-$z$ blazars within a single, consistent statistical framework. Our results emphasize the importance of accounting for IGM attenuation and of using uniform fitting methods when comparing disk-based black hole estimates across samples.
#### Black hole accretion, star formation, and chemical evolution with PRIMA/FIRESS spectroscopy: toward the cosmic noon and beyond

 - **Abstract**
 The PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA) will deliver the first comprehensive view of the obscured side of star formation and black hole accretion that dominates galaxy growth at cosmic noon. Around 90% of UV/optical photons from young stars and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are absorbed by dust and reradiated in the mid- to far-infrared, where key diagnostic lines trace accretion, star formation, and the physical and chemical conditions of galaxies. PRIMA will conduct blind spectroscopic surveys out to $z \sim 3-4$, enabling an unbiased determination of the co-evolution of star formation and black hole growth with cosmic time. We simulate a 200 arcmin$^2$ blind spectroscopic survey with FIRESS to measure star formation and black hole accretion rates for hundreds of galaxies at cosmic noon. Follow-up observations will provide relative N/O abundances and N/O-independent metallicities from multiple mid-IR lines. In its high-resolution mode, FIRESS will probe feedback processes through P-Cygni profiles, blueshifted OH absorption, and emission-line wings from highly ionised gas. Beyond cosmic noon, PRIMA will pioneer rest-frame mid-IR spectroscopy of galaxies during reionisation. Bright high-ionisation lines will constrain the primary ionising continuum of luminous Lyman-$\alpha$ emitters and low-metallicity AGN, revealing the conditions that shaped the first galaxies and black holes. By bridging the gap between optical and radio facilities, PRIMA will deliver an unobscured, end-to-end view of the processes driving galaxy evolution from the earliest epochs to the peak of activity.
