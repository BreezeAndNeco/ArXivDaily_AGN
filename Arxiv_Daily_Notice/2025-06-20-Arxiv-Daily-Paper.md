 - **Abstract**
 We present a broad-line active galactic nucleus (AGN) at z = 5.077, observed with both NIRSpec/MSA and NIRSpec/IFU by the JADES and BlackTHUNDER surveys. The target exhibits all the hallmark features of a 'Little Red Dot' (LRD) AGN. The combination of spatially resolved and high-resolution spectroscopy offers deeper insight into its nature. The H$\alpha$ line has multiple components, including two broad Gaussians, yielding a black-hole mass of $\log(M_{\rm BH}/M_\odot) = 7.65$, while the narrow [O III]$\lambda$5007 gives a galaxy dynamical mass of $\log(M_{\rm dyn}/M_\odot) = 9.1$, suggesting a dynamically overmassive black hole relative to the host galaxy. The target has two satellites, and is immersed in a 7-kpc wide pool of ionized gas. A spatially detached outflow is also tentatively detected. H$\alpha$ shows strong absorption with high equivalent width (EW), ruling out a stellar origin, and with velocity and velocity dispersion of v = -13 km s$^{-1}$ and $\sigma$ = 120 km s$^{-1}$. There is tentative evidence (2.6 $\sigma$) of temporal variability in the EW of the H$\alpha$ absorber over two rest-frame months. If confirmed, this would suggest a highly dynamic environment. Notably, while the H$\alpha$ absorber is clearly visible and even dominant in the high-resolution G395H observations, it is not detected in the medium-resolution G395M data of the same epoch. This implies that the current incidence rate of absorbers in LRDs - and especially of rest-frame absorbers - may be severely underestimated, because most LRDs rely on lower-resolution spectroscopy. In this context, the high incidence rate of rest-frame absorbers in LRDs may indicate a configuration that is either intrinsically stationary, such as a rotating disc, or that exhibits time-averaged stability, such as an oscillatory 'breathing mode' accretion of cyclic expansion and contraction of the gas around the SMBH.

 - **Abstract**
 The morphology of X-ray halos in early-type galaxies depends on key structure assembly processes such as feedback and mergers. However, the signatures of these processes are difficult to characterize due to their faint and amorphous nature. We demonstrate that the truncation in the temperature profile of X-ray halos, defined by the radial location of the peak temperature, is significantly more impacted by recent mergers or galaxy interactions than feedback processes. At a fixed stellar mass, a highly asymmetric X-ray halo can be nearly a factor of ten more truncated than a relaxed one. This analysis led to a discovery of previously unknown asymmetric features in the optical and X-ray halos of three massive galaxies. We detect the intra-group star light and a large ~45 kpc size stellar stream connected to NGC 0383, suggesting that a recent stellar accretion event has triggered its active galactic nuclei to emit a powerful radio jet. While the disturbed X-ray halo of NGC 1600 is also related to a galaxy-satellite tidal interaction detected in optical imaging, the X-ray shape and asymmetry of NGC 4555 is highly unusual for a galaxy in a low dense environment, requiring further investigation. These results highlight the importance of truncations and deep imaging techniques for untangling the formation of X-ray halos in massive galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 The cosmic X-ray background (CXB) is produced by the emission of unresolved active galactic nuclei (AGN), thus providing key information about the properties of the primary and reprocessed X-ray emission components of the AGN population. Equally important, studies of individual sources provide additional constraints on the properties of AGN, such as their luminosity and obscuration. Until now, these constraints have not been self-consistently addressed by intrinsically linking emission, absorption, and reflection. Here we perform numerical simulations with the ray-tracing code, RefleX, which allows us to self-consistently model the X-ray emission of AGN with flexible geometries for the circumnuclear medium. Using the RefleX-simulated emission of an AGN population, we attempt to simultaneously reproduce the CXB and absorption properties measured in the X-rays, namely the observed fraction of $N_{\mathrm{H}}$ in bins of log($N_{\mathrm{H}}$) and the fraction of absorbed AGN, including their redshift and luminosity evolution. We sample an intrinsic X-ray luminosity function and construct gradually more complex physically motivated geometrical models. We examine how well each model can match all observational constraints using a simulation-based inference (SBI) approach. We find that, while the simple unification model can reproduce the CXB, a luminosity dependent dusty torus is needed to reproduce the absorption properties. When adding an accretion disc, the model best matches all constraints simultaneously. Our synthetic population is able to reproduce the dependence of the covering factor on luminosity, the AGN number counts from several surveys, and the observed correlation between reflection and obscuration. Finally, we derive an intrinsic Compton-thick fraction of 21$\pm$7%, consistent with local observations.
#### Detection of over 37,000 giant pulses per hour from PSR J1823$-$3021A with UHF baseband observations from MeerKAT

 - **Abstract**
 Giant pulses (GPs) occur in high magnetic-field millisecond pulsars (MSPs) and young Crab-like pulsars. Motivated by the fast radio bursts (FRBs) discovered in a globular cluster (GC) in the M81, we undertook baseband observations of PSR J1823$-$3021A, the most active GP emitter in a GC with the MeerKAT UHF band receiver (544-1088 MHz). The steep spectral index of the pulsar yields a GP rate of over 37,000 GPs/hr with $S/N>7$, significantly higher than the 3000 GPs/hr rate detected by Abbate et al. 2020 with the L-band (856-1712 MHz) receiver. Similarly to Abbate et al 2020, we find that the GPs are (1) strongly clustered in 2 particular phases of its rotation, (2) well described by a power-law in terms of energies, (3) typically broadband, and have steep spectral indices of $\approx-3$. Although the integrated pulse profile is not significantly polarised ($<1\%$ linear and $<3\%$ circular), one of the brightest GPs displays notable polarisation of $7\%$ (linear) and $8\%$ (circular). The high-time resolution data reveals the GPs have a range of single-peak and multi-peak morphologies, including GPs with three distinct peaks. For the first time, we measured the temporal scattering of the pulsar using 49 bright, narrow, single-pulse GPs, obtaining a mean value of $5.5\pm0.6$ $\mu$s at 1 GHz. The distinct periodicity and low polarisation of GPs differentiate them from typical FRBs, although potential quasi-periodicity substructures in some GPs may suggest a connection to magnetars/FRBs.

 - **Abstract**
 Optical observations of solar corona provide key information on its magnetic geometry. The large-scale open field of the corona plays an important role in shaping the ambient solar wind and constraining the propagation dynamics of the embedded structures, such as interplanetary coronal mass ejections. Rigorous analysis of the open-flux coronal regions based on coronagraph images can be quite challenging because of the depleted plasma density resulting in low signal-to-noise ratios. In this paper, we present an in-depth description of a new image segmentation methodology, the Quasi-Radial Field-line Tracing (QRaFT), enabling a detection of field-aligned optical coronal features approximating the orientation of the steady-state open magnetic field. The methodology is tested using synthetic coronagraph images generated by a three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic model. The results of the numerical tests indicate that the extracted optical features are aligned within $\sim 4-7$ degrees with the local magnetic field in the underlying numerical solution. We also demonstrate the performance of the method on real-life coronal images obtained from a space-borne coronagraph and a ground-based camera. We argue that QRaFT outputs contain valuable empirical information about the global steady-state morphology of the corona which could help improving the accuracy of coronal and solar wind models and space weather forecasts.

 - **Abstract**
 Due to dust grain alignment with magnetic fields, dust polarization observations of far-infrared emission from cold molecular clouds are often used to trace magnetic fields, allowing a probe of the effects of magnetic fields on the star formation process. We present inferred magnetic field maps of the Pillars of Creation region within the larger M16 emission nebula, derived from dust polarization data in the 89 and 154 micron continuum using SOFIA/HAWC+. We derive magnetic field strength estimates using the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method. We compare the polarization and magnetic field strengths to column densities and dust continuum intensities across the region to build a coherent picture of the relationship between star forming activity and magnetic fields in the region. The projected magnetic field strengths derived are in the range of 50-130 microGauss, which is typical for clouds of similar n(H2), i.e., molecular hydrogen volume density on the order of 10^4-10^5 cm^(-3). We conclude that star formation occurs in the finger tips when the magnetic fields are too weak to prevent radial collapse due to gravity but strong enough to oppose OB stellar radiation pressure, while in the base of the fingers the magnetic fields hinder mass accretion and consequently star formation. We also support an initial weak field model (<50 microGauss) with subsequent strengthening through realignment and compression, resulting in a dynamically important magnetic field.
#### Mapping the Excitation Mechanisms in the LINER I Active Galactic Nucleus NGC 5005: Positive Feedback and a Thin LINER Cocoon

 - **Abstract**
 We present a spatially resolved Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich analysis of the narrow-line region (NLR) in the low-ionization nuclear emission-line region (LINER) I galaxy NGC 5005 using Hubble Space Telescope narrowband imaging of [O III]${\lambda}$5007, H${\beta}$, H${\alpha}$, and [S II]${\lambda}{\lambda}$6717,6731. With a resolution of ${\lesssim}$0.1 (${\lesssim}$10 pc at z = 0.003), we dissect the NLR into H II (star-forming), Seyfert, and LINERs across spatial scales extending up to r$\sim$8 kpc from the nucleus. Our results reveal a compact nuclear region exhibiting Seyfert-like emission, consistent with photoionization by a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (AGN). Surrounding this Seyfert-like nucleus is a thin ($\sim$20 pc thick) higher-excitation LINER-like cocoon, likely arising from shock-excited gas in the interstellar medium (ISM). Beyond this cocoon, a centrally localized extended (r$\sim$1 kpc) LINER-like region surrounds the Seyfert-like nucleus and cocoon, likely ionized by the AGN, while a more extended (r${\gtrsim}$2 kpc) LINER-like zone may be ionized by a combination of post-AGB stars and shocks from gas inflows. We also detect H II-like regions at both small and large scales. In the inner 500 pc, these regions may be triggered by jet-ISM interactions, potentially inducing localized star formation. At r$\sim$4 kpc, we identify an outer H II-like region tracing a large-scale star-forming ring, where ionization is dominated by young stars.

 - **Abstract**
 We consider the question of whether core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) can produce rapid neutron capture process (r-process) elements and how future MeV gamma-ray observations could address this. Rare types of CCSNe characterized by substantial magnetic fields and rotation, known as magnetorotational supernovae (MR-SNe), are theoretically predicted to produce these elements, although direct observational evidence is lacking. We suggest that this critical question be addressed through the study of some of the eleven CCSN remnants located within 10 kpc, as well as through the detection of gamma-ray emission from a future Galactic supernova. We use a two-dimensional MR-SN model to estimate the expected gamma flux stemming from nuclear decays in the range of a few tens of keV to a few MeV. Our results indicate that an observation of Sn-126 (Sb-126) in a remnant stands out as a signature of an r-process-producing supernova. Since the neutron-rich conditions that lead to the production of the r-process could also enhance the production of Fe-60, the detection of substantial Fe-60 (Co-60) would be indicative of favorable conditions for the r-process. In the case of a future supernova explosion, when the evolution of the spectrum is studied over ten days to a few years, a rich picture emerges. At various epochs, second peak r-process isotopes such as Sb-125, I-131, Te-132, I-132 and La-140 produce gamma-ray signals that emerge above the background from explosive burning products and electron-positron annihilation. The weak r-process isotopes Nb-95, Ru-103, Rh-106 also have periods of prominence. While MR-SNe are predicted to have a relatively small main r-process contribution, third peak isotopes like Ir-194 could still be above next-generation MeV gamma instrument sensitivities.

 - **Abstract**
 More and more observations have indicated the existence of slow diffusion phenomena in astrophysical environments, such as around the supernova remnants and pulsar $\gamma$-ray halos, where the diffusion coefficient of cosmic rays (CRs) near the source region is significantly smaller than that far away from the source region. The inhomogeneous diffusion indicates the existence of multiple diffusion this http URL the CR mirror diffusion with the scattering one, we aim to explore their diffusion characteristics in different magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence regimes and understand the effect of different MHD modes on mirror and scattering diffusion. We perform numerical simulations with the test particle method. Within the global frame of reference, we first measure parallel and perpendicular CR diffusion and then determine the mean free path of CRs with varying this http URL main results demonstrate that: (1) CRs experience a transition from superdiffusion to normal diffusion; (2) mirror diffusion is more important than scattering diffusion in confining CRs; (3) CR diffusion strongly depends on the properties of MHD turbulence; and (4) magnetosonic and Alfvén modes dominate the parallel and perpendicular diffusion of CR particles, respectively. The diffusion of CRs is a complex problem of mixing the mirror diffusion and scattering diffusion. The property of turbulent magnetic fields influences CR diffusion. The CR slow diffusion due to the presence of magnetic mirrors in turbulence has important implications for explaining observations near a CR source.
#### Galactic seismology: can the Gaia 'phase spiral' co-exist with a clumpy, turbulent interstellar medium?

 - **Abstract**
 The Gaia satellite revealed a remarkable spiral pattern ('phase spiral', PS) in the z-Vz phase plane throughout the solar neighbourhood, where z and Vz are the displacement and velocity of a star perpendicular to the Galactic plane. As demonstrated by many groups, the kinematic signature reflects the Galactic stellar disc's response to a dynamical disturbance in the recent past (~0.3-3 Gyr). However, previous controlled simulations did not consider the impact of the multiphase interstellar medium (ISM) on the existence of the PS. This is crucial because it has been suggested that this weak signal is highly susceptible to scattering by small-scale density fluctuations typical of the ISM. This has motivated us to explore the formation and fate of the PS in a high-resolution, N-body/hydrodynamical simulation of an idealised Galaxy analogue bearing a realistic ISM, which interacts impulsively with a massive perturber. In our models, high gas surface densities within the disc encourage vigorous star formation, which in turn couples with the gas via feedback to drive turbulence. We find that the PS is almost non-existent if the ISM has an excess of power on sub-kiloparsec scales compared to longer wavelengths. This can happen in the absence of star formation and feedback when the gas is allowed to cool. In the presence of turbulent gas maintained by stellar feedback, the PS has a patchy spatial distribution and a high degree of intermittency on kiloparsec scales. We anticipate that future studies of the phase-spiral behaviour on all scales will provide crucial information on star-gas dynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 To advance research on galaxies in the era of large-scale sky surveys, we introduce GalaxyGenius, a Python package designed to produce synthetic galaxy images tailored to different telescopes based on hydrodynamical simulations. The package comprises three main modules: data preprocessing, ideal data cube generation, and mock observation. Specifically, the preprocessing module extracts necessary properties of star and gas particles for a selected subhalo from hydrodynamical simulations and creates the execution file for the following radiative transfer procedure. Subsequently, building on the above information, the ideal data cube generation module executes a widely-used radiative transfer project, specifically the SKIRT, to perform the SED assignment for each particle and the radiative transfer procedure to produce an IFU-like ideal data cube. Lastly, the mock observation module takes the ideal data cube and applies the throughputs of aiming telescopes while also incorporating the relevant instrumental effects, point spread functions (PSFs), and background noise to generate desired mock observational images of galaxies. To showcase the outcomes of GalaxyGenius, We create a series of mock images of galaxies based on the IllustrisTNG and EAGLE simulations for both space and ground-based surveys spanning from the ultraviolet to infrared wavelength coverages, including CSST, Euclid, HST, JWST, Roman, and HSC. GalaxyGenius offers a flexible framework developed to generate mock galaxy images with customizable recipes. These generated images can serve as valuable references for verifying and validating new approaches in astronomical research, and they can also act as training sets for deep learning relevant studies where real observational data are insufficient.
#### Soft X-ray line emission from hot gas in intervening galaxy halos and diffuse gas in the cosmic web

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic hot gas emission is closely related to halo gas acquisition and galactic feedback processes. Their X-ray observations reveal important physical properties and movements of the baryonic cycle of galactic ecosystems. However, the measured emissions toward a target at a cosmological distance would always include contributions from hot gases along the entire line of sight to the target. Observationally, such contaminations are routinely subtracted via different strategies. In this work, we aim at answering an interesting theoretical question regarding the amount of soft X-ray line emissions from intervening hot gases of different origins. We tackle this problem with the aid of the TNG100 simulation. We generated typical wide-field lightcone and estimated their impacts on spectral and flux measurements toward X-ray-emitting galaxy-, group- and cluster-halo targets at lower redshifts. We split the intervening hot gases into three categories, that is, the hot gas that is gravitationally bound to either star-forming or quenched galaxy halos, and the diffuse gas which is more tenuously distributed permeating the cosmic web structures. We find that along a given line of sight, the diffuse gas that permeates the cosmic web structures produces strong oxygen and iron line emissions at different redshifts. The diffuse gas emission in the soft X-ray band can be equal to the emission from hot gases that are gravitationally bound to intervening galaxy halos. While the hot gas emission from the quiescent galaxy halos can be significantly less than that from star-forming halos along the line of sight. The fluxes from all of the line-of-sight emitters as measured in the energy band of 0.4--0.85 keV can reach ~20--200 % of the emission from the target galaxy, group, and cluster halos.
#### Massive stars exploding in a He-rich circumstellar medium. XI. Diverse evolution of five Ibn SNe 2020nxt, 2020taz, 2021bbv, 2023utc and 2024aej

 - **Abstract**
 We present the photometric and spectroscopic analysis of five Type Ibn supernovae (SNe): SN 2020nxt, SN 2020taz, SN 2021bbv, SN 2023utc, and SN 2024aej. These events share key observational features and belong to a family of objects similar to the prototypical Type Ibn SN 2006jc. The SNe exhibit rise times of approximately 10 days and peak absolute magnitudes ranging from $-$16.5 to $-$19 mag. Notably, SN 2023utc is the faintest Type Ibn supernova discovered to date, with an exceptionally low r-band absolute magnitude of $-16.4$ mag. The pseudo-bolometric light curves peak at $(1-10) \times 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$, with total radiated energies on the order of $(1-10) \times 10^{48}$ erg. Spectroscopically, these SNe display relatively slow spectral evolution; the early spectra are characterised by a hot blue continuum and prominent He I emission lines. Early spectra show blackbody temperatures exceeding $10000~\mathrm{K}$, with a subsequent decline in temperature during later phases. Narrow He I lines, indicative of unshocked circumstellar material (CSM), show velocities of approximately $1000~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$. The spectra suggest that the progenitors of these SNe underwent significant mass loss prior to the explosion, resulting in a He-rich CSM. Light curve modelling yields estimates for the ejecta mass ($M_{\rm ej}$) in the range $1-3~M_{\odot}$, with kinetic energies ($E_{\rm Kin}$) of $(0.1-1) \times 10^{50}$ erg. The inferred CSM mass ranges from $0.2$ to $1~M_{\odot}$. These findings are consistent with expectations for core-collapse events arising from relatively massive, envelope-stripped progenitors.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed analysis of the light curves and pulsation properties of First Overtone (FO) Cepheids in the Magellanic Clouds (MCs) obtained using observations and predictions from stellar pulsation models. Multiwavelength observational light curves were compiled from the literature (OGLE-IV, Gaia and VMC). We investigate the period-amplitude (PA), period-colour (PC), period-luminosity (PL), and amplitude-colour (AC) relations for FO Cepheids at multiwavelengths. We find that the PA distribution of FO Cepheids in the MCs modelled using a Gaussian Mixture Model shows that the SMC consists of higher amplitude stars than the LMC. We find multiple break-points in the PC/PL/AC relations for FO/FU Cepheids in the optical and near-infrared bands including the one near to P = 2.5 d in the MCs using piecewise regression analysis and F- test statistics. Similarly, for the LMC FO Cepheids, we find a break-point in the PC/PL/AC relations near P = 0.58 d. The slopes of the PC relations for LMC FO Cepheids are found to be shallow for 0.58 < P(d) < 2.5 but steeper for P < 0.58 d and P > 2.5 d. We complemented the observed relations using theoretical models for FO Cepheids with chemical compositions Z = 0.008 and Z = 0.004, appropriate for the LMC and SMC, respectively computed with MESA-RSP. Our results show that the pulsation properties of FO Cepheids in PC/PL/AC relations and colour-magnitude diagram are strongly correlated and their connections can provide stringent constraints for the theoretical pulsation models.

 - **Abstract**
 The cluster R136 in the LMC contains a population of stars in excess of 100 M$_\odot$, including R136a1, the most massive star known. Very Massive Stars (VMSs) play an influential role in feedback processes and may potentially produce exotic supernova types and black holes of tens of solar masses. The evolutionary history and final fate of the three most luminous stars, R136a1, R136a2, and R136a3, has been a puzzling issue. We aim to resolve this by rotating single-star MESA models. We produce interpolated model grids and apply a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo analysis to compare our models with observations. The nature of supernova progenitors strongly depends on mass loss and the AM coupling schemes. We predict no pair-instability and no GRB progenitors from our fiducial model grid at LMC metallicity. The onset of Wolf-Rayet-type mass-loss rates on the main sequence leads to a rapid decrease in stellar mass and luminosity. The mass turnover implies that the evolutionary history can only be inferred if additional constraints are available. We utilise the surface helium abundance, which poses a conundrum: R136a1, the most luminous star, is less enriched in helium than R136a2 and R136a3. We propose that this can be explained if both R136a2 and R136a3 were initially more massive than R136a1. From a rigorous confrontation of our models to spectroscopically-derived observables, we estimate an initial mass of 346$\pm41$ M$_\odot$ for R136a1, and $\gtrsim$500 M$_\odot$ for R136a2 and R136a3. Even though VMSs are only present in the youngest clusters below 2 Myr of age, our study strengthens their role in local and galaxy evolution. At LMC metallicity, they will be observable as helium-enriched massive stars after their drastic mass loss, produced via single-star evolution. If the core collapse leads to a supernova, it will be of Type Ib/c. [abridged]

 - **Abstract**
 Flares and associated Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) are energetic stellar phenomena that shape the space weather around planets. Close-in exoplanets orbiting active cool stars are likely exposed to extreme space weather whose effects on the planets are not understood well enough. The terrestrial Trappist-1 exoplanets are excellent targets to study the impact of CMEs on close-in planets and their atmospheres. We study the role of planetary magnetic fields in shielding the planet from external forcing. We expand on recent studies of CME-induced Joule heating of planetary interiors and atmospheres by including a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model of the interaction. We study the interaction of CMEs with Tr-1b & e using MHD simulations. We consider magnetic flux rope and density pulse CMEs. We calculate induction heating in the planetary interior and ionospheric Joule heating for various intrinsic magnetic field strengths and CME energies. Magnetospheric compression is the main driver of magnetic variability. Planetary magnetic fields enhance induction heating in the interior although the effect is weaker with flux rope CMEs. Single event dissipation rates with 1-hour CMEs amount to 20 TW and 1 TW for Trappist-1b and e, respectively. Taking CME occurrence rates into account, annual average heating rates are ~10 TW (b) and ~1 TW (e), which are placed near the lower end of previous estimates. Within the range of studied planetary magnetic field strengths $B_p$, magnetospheric Poynting fluxes scale with $B_p^3$. Thus, stronger magnetic fields increase CME energy absorption. Ionospheric Joule heating rates amount to $10^{3-4}$ TW and decrease for stronger magnetic fields $B_p$. These heating rates exceed the average stellar XUV input by 1-2 orders of magnitude and might severely impact atmospheric erosion. In a steady state stellar wind ionospheric Joule heating amounts to ~$10^2$ TW.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a kinematical study of the ionized and molecular gas in the central region (~7-14"~100-200pc) of the nearby radio galaxy Cen A. We used JWST/MIRI MRS 5-28$\mu$m observations taken as part of the MIR Characterization of Nearby Iconic galaxy Centers (MICONIC) of the MIRI EC. The two gas phases present contrasting morphologies and kinematics. The brightest emission from the ionized gas, traced with a range of IP lines ([Fe II] to [Ne VI]), is extended along the direction of the radio jet. We also detected emission from low IP emission lines and H$_2$ transitions in the galaxy disk. Both gas phases present rotational motions but also complex kinematics. The observations reveal several ionized gas kinematical features that are consistent with simulation predictions of a jet-driven bubble and outflow interacting with the galaxy ISM. These include broad components in the nuclear line profiles ($\sigma$~600km/s), high velocities (~ +1000, -1400km/s) confined within the nuclear region, velocities of hundreds of km/s in several directions in the central 2", and enhanced velocity dispersions perpendicular to the radio jet. Moreover, we find evidence of shock excitation in the nuclear region based on MIR line ratios. We compared the ionized gas mass outflow rate with Cen A's AGN luminosity and radio jet power and demonstrate that both mechanisms provide sufficient energy to launch the outflow. The noncircular motions observed in the H$_2$ lines can be reproduced with either a warped rotating disk model or a radial component. The latter might be to related to gas streamers detected in cold molecular gas. There is no clear indication of a fast nuclear H$_2$ outflow, only a weak blueshifted component. This could be due to a relatively low nuclear warm H$_2$ column density and/or the limited geometrical coupling of Cen A's inner radio jet with the circumnuclear disk of the galaxy. (Abridged)

 - **Abstract**
 As part of the N2CLS Survey, we have identified a remarkable overdensity of ten bright dusty star-forming galaxies at z$\sim$5.2 in the GOODS-N field. Three of these galaxies, N2GN_1_01, 06, and 23 (known as GN10, HDF850.1, and S3, respectively), had previously been spectroscopically confirmed as members of the exceptional large-scale structure at z$\sim$5.1-5.3, which is notably elongated along the line of sight, spanning 30 cMpc. We present the spectroscopic confirmation of N2GN_1_13 at z$_{\rm spec}$=5.182, a massive dusty star-forming galaxy identified through targeted NOEMA observations, and N2GN_1_61 at z$_{\rm spec}$=5.201, revealed using JWST/FRESCO data. In addition to these five spectroscopically confirmed members, we identify five further candidates with photometric redshifts consistent with the overdense structure. These galaxies are massive (with a median stellar mass of 10$^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$) and highly obscured (with a median A$_V$ of 2.9), caught in a short-lived yet extreme starburst phase at z$\sim$5.2. Their high SFRs (with a median of 680 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$), efficient baryon to stellar mass conversion ($\epsilon_{\star}>$20%), substantial gas reservoir and dust content, suggest rapid evolution and imminent quenching. Six of these galaxies reside in overdense filaments, while the remaining four may trace new distinct structures which will have to be spectroscopically confirmed. These few dusty galaxies dominate the star formation within the overdensity, contributing more than the numerous H$_{\alpha}$ emitters, and surpassing the cosmic average star formation rate density for this epoch. Their properties suggest an accelerated evolution that current models and simulations have difficulty reproducing.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive analysis of inflationary models in light of projected sensitivities from forthcoming CMB and gravitational wave experiments, incorporating data from recent ACT DR6, DESI DR2, CMB-S4, LiteBIRD, and SPHEREx. Focusing on precise predictions in the $(n_s, \alpha_s, \beta_s)$ parameter space, we evaluate a broad class of inflationary scenarios -- including canonical single-field models, non-minimally coupled theories, and string-inspired constructions such as Starobinsky, Higgs, Hilltop, $\alpha$-attractors, and D-brane models. Our results show that next-generation observations will sharply constrain the scale dependence of the scalar power spectrum, elevating $\alpha_s$ and $\beta_s$ as key discriminants between large-field and small-field dynamics. Strikingly, several widely studied models -- such as quartic Hilltop inflation and specific DBI variants -- are forecast to be excluded at high significance. We further demonstrate that the combined measurement of $\beta_s$ and the field excursion $\Delta\phi$ offers a novel diagnostic of kinetic structure and UV sensitivity. These findings underscore the power of upcoming precision cosmology to probe the microphysical origin of inflation and decisively test broad classes of theoretical models.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of the cosmic velocity field could become an important cosmological probe in the near future. To take advantage of future velocity-flow surveys we must however have the theoretical predictions under control. In many respects, the velocity field is easier to simulate than the density field because it is less severely affected by small-scale clustering. Therefore, as we also show in this paper, a particle-mesh (PM) based simulation approach is usually sufficient, yielding results within a few percent of a corresponding P$^3$M simulation in which short-range forces are properly accounted for, but which also carry a much larger computational cost. However, in other respects the velocity field is much more challenging to deal with than the density field: Interpolating the velocity field onto a grid is significantly more complicated, and the vorticity field (the curl-part of the velocity field) is severely affected by both sample variance and discretisation effects. While the former can be dealt with using fixed amplitude initial conditions, the former makes it infeasible to run fully converged simulations in a cosmological volume. However, using the $N$-body code CONCEPT we show that one can robustly extrapolate the cosmic vorticity power spectrum from just 4 simulations with different number of particles. We expect our extrapolated vorticity power spectra to be correct within 5\% of the fully converged result across three orders of magnitude in $k$.

 - **Abstract**
 A subclass of early impulsive solar flares, cold flares, was proposed to represent a clean case, where the release of the free magnetic energy (almost) entirely goes to acceleration of the nonthermal electrons, while the observed thermal response is entirely driven by the nonthermal energy deposition to the ambient plasma. This paper studies one more example of a cold flare, which was observed by a unique combination of instruments. In particular, this is the first cold flare observed with the Expanded Owens Valley Solar Array and, thus, for which the dynamical measurement of the coronal magnetic field and other parameters at the flare site is possible. With these new data, we quantified the coronal magnetic field at the flare site, but did not find statistically significant variations of the magnetic field within the measurement uncertainties. We estimated that the uncertainty in the corresponding magnetic energy exceeds the thermal and nonthermal energies by an order of magnitude; thus, there should be sufficient free energy to drive the flare. We discovered a very prominent soft-hard-soft spectral evolution of the microwave-producing nonthermal electrons. We computed energy partitions and concluded that the nonthermal energy deposition is likely sufficient to drive the flare thermal response similarly to other cold flares.

 - **Abstract**
 At the moment, one of the main ways to infer the disk mass is to use a combination of CO isotopologue line observations. A number of theoretical studies have concluded that CO must be a reliable gas tracer as its relative abundance depends on disk parameters only weakly. However, the observed line fluxes cannot always be easily used to infer the column density, much less the abundance of CO. The aim of this work is to study the dependence of the CO isotopologue millimeter line fluxes on the astrochemical model parameters of a standard protoplanetary disk around a T Tauri star and to conclude whether they or their combinations can be reliably used to determine disk parameters. Our case is set apart from earlier studies in the literature by the usage of a comprehensive chemical network with grain surface chemistry together with line radiative transfer. We use the astrochemical model ANDES together with the radiative transfer code RADMC-3D to simulate CO isotopologue line fluxes from a set of disks with varying key parameters (disk mass, disk radius, stellar mass, and inclination). We study how these values change with one parameter varying and others fixed and approximate the dependences log-linearly. We describe the dependences of CO isotopologue fluxes on all chosen disk parameters. Physical and chemical processes responsible for these dependences are analyzed and explained for each parameter. We show that using a combination of the $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O line fluxes, the mass can be estimated only within two orders of magnitude uncertainty and characteristic radius within one order of magnitude uncertainty. We find that inclusion of grain surface chemistry reduces $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O fluxes which can explain the underestimation of disk mass in the previous studies.

 - **Abstract**
 The z=1.14 $\infty$ galaxy consists of two ringed nuclei with an active supermassive black hole (SMBH) in between them. The system is likely the result of a nearly face-on collision between two disk galaxies with massive bulges. In van Dokkum et al. (2025) we suggested that the SMBH may have formed from shocked and compressed gas at the collision site, in a runaway gravitational collapse. Here we test this hypothesis using newly obtained NIRSpec IFU observations. We first confirm that the system has a cloud of gas in between the nuclei that is photo-ionized by an AGN-like object near its center. Next, we constrain the origin of the SMBH from its radial velocity. If it formed in the cloud its velocity should be similar to the surrounding gas, whereas it would be offset if the SMBH had escaped from one of the nuclei or were associated with a faint galaxy. We find that the radial velocity of the SMBH is within $\sim 50$ km/s of that of the surrounding gas, as expected if the SMBH formed within the cloud. Unexpectedly, we find that both nuclei have active SMBHs as well, as inferred from very broad H$\alpha$ emission with FWHM $\sim 3000$ km/s. This rules out scenarios where the central SMBH was ejected from one of the nuclei in a gravitational recoil. Taken together, these results strengthen the hypothesis that the object at the center of the $\infty$ galaxy is a newly formed SMBH.
