#### Characterizing Lyman alpha emission from high-redshift galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 The Lyman $\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) line from high-redshift galaxies is a powerful probe of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium (IGM) can significantly attenuate the emergent Ly$\alpha$ line, even in the damping wing of the cross-section. However, interpreting this damping wing imprint relies on our prior knowledge of the spectrum that escapes from the galaxy and its environs into the IGM. This emergent spectrum is highly sensitive to the composition and geometry of the interstellar and circumgalactic media, and so exhibits a large galaxy to galaxy scatter. Characterizing this scatter is further complicated by non-trivial selection effects introduced by observational surveys. Here we build a flexible, empirical model for the emergent Ly$\alpha$ spectra. Our model characterizes the emergent Ly$\alpha$ luminosity, the velocity offset of the Ly$\alpha$ line with respect to the systemic redshift, and the H$\alpha$ luminosity, with multivariate probability distributions conditioned on the UV magnitude. We constrain these distributions using $z\sim5-6$ galaxy observations with VLT MUSE and JWST NIRCam, forward-modeling observational selection functions together with galaxy parameters. Our model results in Ly$\alpha$ equivalent width distributions that are a better match to (independent) Subaru observations than previous empirical models. The extended distributions of Ly$\alpha$ equivalent widths and velocity offsets we obtain could facilitate Ly$\alpha$ transmission during the early stages of the EoR. We also illustrate how our model can be used to identify GN-z11-like outliers, potentially originating from merging systems. We publish fitting functions and make our model publicly available.

 - **Abstract**
 The landmark multi-messenger observations of the binary neutron star (BNS) merger GW170817 provided firm evidence that such mergers can produce short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs). However, the limited number of BNS detections by current gravitational-wave (GW) observatories raises the question of whether BNS mergers alone can account for the full observed sGRB population. We analyze a comprehensive set of 64 BNS population synthesis models with a Monte Carlo-based framework to reproduce the properties of sGRBs detected by Fermi-GBM over the past 16 years. We consider three jet geometry scenarios: a universal structured jet calibrated to GW170817, a universal top-hat jet, and a non-universal top-hat jet with distributions of core opening angles. Our results show that models characterized by low local BNS merger rates ($R_{BNS}(0) \lesssim 50$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$) predict too few observable sGRBs to reproduce the Fermi-GBM population, effectively disfavoring them as sole progenitors. Even when relaxing assumptions on jet geometry, low-rate models remain viable only for wide jets ($\theta_c \ge 15^\circ$), in tension with the narrow jet cores ($\theta_c \approx 6^\circ$) inferred from sGRB afterglow observations. In contrast, models with local merger rates of order $R_{BNS}(0) \approx 100$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ successfully reproduce the observed sGRB population, assuming a plausible fraction of BNS mergers launch relativistic jets and realistic jet geometries. This analysis highlights the power of combining GW observations of BNS mergers with electromagnetic observations of sGRBs to place robust constraints on the BNS merger population and to assess their role as progenitors of sGRBs.
#### ARCHITECTS I: Impact of subgrid physics on the simulated properties of the circumgalactic medium

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy evolution is shaped by star formation and stellar feedback at scales unresolved by current high-resolution cosmological simulations. Precise subgrid models are thus necessary, and different approaches have been developed. However, they are degenerate and often primarily calibrated to reproduce stellar masses from observations. To explore these degeneracies, we perform three cosmological zoom-in radiation-hydrodynamics simulations of the same galaxy within a $5\times10^{11}\rm\ M_\odot$ dark matter halo at $z\sim1$, each with a different subgrid model: mechanical feedback, a combination of mechanical feedback and thermal feedback, and delayed cooling. We calibrate the simulations to match in stellar mass, isolating the effect of the models on the circumgalactic medium (CGM). Our findings demonstrate that despite producing galaxies with comparable stellar masses, the three models lead to distinct feedback modes, resulting in notable variations in the CGM properties. The delayed cooling run is dominated by ejective feedback and exhibits high burstiness, whereas mechanical and the hybrid models primarily feature preventive feedback, respectively acting at the galaxy and halo scales. Delayed cooling reduces the baryon mass to half the universal baryon fraction while mechanical feedback retains most baryons, with the hybrid model standing in between. Delayed cooling also ejects significantly more metals into the CGM than both other models. While for delayed cooling and mechanical feedback metals are almost evenly distributed in the CGM, they are concentrated around satellites in the hybrid model. These discrepancies emphasize the need to design an appropriate subgrid model to understand how stellar feedback regulates galaxy growth.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy evolution is driven by star formation and stellar feedback on scales unresolved by current high-resolution cosmological simulations, requiring robust subgrid models. However, these models remain degenerate, often calibrated primarily to match observed stellar masses. To explore these degeneracies, we conduct three state-of-the-art cosmological zoom-in simulations of the same galaxy, each incorporating different subgrid models: mechanical feedback, a combination of mechanical and thermal feedback, and delayed cooling. We compare their circumgalactic media (CGM) through quasar absorption sightlines of HI, MgII, CIV, and OVI. Our findings demonstrate that despite producing galaxies with the same stellar masses, the models lead to distinct feedback modes and CGM properties. Column densities and covering fractions serve as effective diagnostics of subgrid models, with all four ions providing strong constraints as they trace diverse gas phases, exhibit complementary spatial distributions, and originate from different mechanisms. Although all simulations bracket observed column density distributions, direct comparisons are limited by scarce detections and significant scatter in absorption strengths. Covering fractions of weak absorbers provides the most robust constraints. All models fail to reproduce HI and MgII covering fractions, and delayed cooling overproduces OVI covering fractions, while the other models underproduce them. The simulation including mechanical feedback reproduces the observed CIV covering fractions well, whereas the other models show slight offsets. We argue that this discrepancy is likely driven by unresolved thermal structures for HI and MgII, and insufficient metals for CIV and OVI, arising from missing physics such as AGNs or cosmic rays.

 - **Abstract**
 At low redshifts, hydroxyl megamasers (OHMs) have been shown to trace galaxy mergers, obscured starbursts, high molecular gas densities, and candidate dual supermassive black hole systems. Given this astrophysical utility, exploring these sources at larger cosmological look-back times is therefore of key interest. While previous OHM surveys have been limited to redshifts of $z \lesssim 0.25$, the ability to expand the OHM frontier is significantly enhanced with new high-sensitivity radio facilities such as MeerKAT. In this Letter, we report the discovery of an OHM in the gravitational lens system HATLAS J142935.3-002836 at $z = 1.027$, the most distant OHM source yet detected. The spectrum has blended 1667 and 1665 MHz emission and exhibits a highly complex profile, with spectral components ranging in widths of $<8$ km s$^{-1}$ to $\sim300$ km s$^{-1}$. The integrated (magnification uncorrected) luminosity of log($L_{\rm OH} / L_{\odot}$) = 5.51 $\pm$ 0.67 makes this the most apparently luminous OHM known to date. In the same wide-band dataset, we have also detected a previously unknown ${\rm H I}$ absorption line. The signal-to-noise ratio of over 150 with just a 4.7 h observation highlights the potential that MeerKAT and the future Square Kilometre Array mid-frequency array offer to explore the high-redshift OHM universe.
#### The Interplanetary Habitable Zone

 - **Abstract**
 The concept of a system-wide measure of the sustainment of life (habitability) for space-faring interplanetary species is introduced and explored. Although largely agnostic to the details of how interplanetary life might operate (e.g., via technology or by utilizing organism traits that are, as of now, unknown to us), some assumptions must be made about energy harvesting, orbital mobility costs, radiation risks, and resource requirements. A multi-modal figure of merit is developed for evaluating an interplanetary habitable zone (IHZ). An agent-based model is also developed to simulate the dispersal of interplanetary life in a planetary system and characterize the IHZ. For the solar system, resource weightings between planetary bodies dictate many overall behaviors, including the sequence of migration from Earth to the Moon, Mars, and asteroid belt. Comparisons with the Trappist-1 exoplanetary system also point to critical sensitivities in the balance between resource availability and risk or cost factors (e.g., radiation risks and orbital Delta-v costs) that determine the structure of an IHZ. Results suggest that our solar system may have an inherent, and significant, advantage for a space-faring species over a system like Trappist-1. This modeling approach may also have application to emerging space economies in our own solar system.

 - **Abstract**
 Cold atomic and molecular gas are commonly observed in the winds of both external galaxies and the Milky Way, yet the survival and origin of these cool phases within hot galactic winds is poorly understood. To help gain insight into these problems, we carry out time-dependent chemical modelling of cool clouds in the Milky Way's nuclear wind, which possess unusual molecularto-atomic hydrogen ratios that are inconsistent with both disc values and predictions from chemical equilibrium models. We confirm that CO and Hi emission comparable to that in the observed nuclear wind clouds cannot be produced by gas in chemical equilibrium, but that such conditions can be produced in a molecule-dominated cloud that has had its atomic envelope rapidly removed and has not yet reached a new chemical equilibrium. Clouds in this state harbour large reservoirs of molecular gas and consequently have anomalously large CO-to-H2 conversion factors, suggesting that the masses of the observed clouds may be significantly larger than suggested by earlier analyses assuming disc-like conversions. These findings provide a new framework for interpreting cold gas in galactic winds, providing strong evidence that cold outflows can originate from the galactic disc molecular clouds that survive acceleration into the wind but lose their diffuse atomic envelopes in the process, and suggesting that the Milky Way's nuclear outflow may be more heavily mass-loaded than previously thought.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding turbulence in interplanetary coronal mass ejections is fundamental to space plasma research and critical for assessing the impact of space weather on geospace. Turbulence governs energy cascade, plasma heating, magnetic reconnection, and solar wind magnetosphere coupling, thereby influencing both ICME evolution and geoeffectiveness. While previous event-based and statistical studies have examined ICME turbulence and its radial evolution in great detail, no significant measurements of ICME magnetic turbulence at a specific vantage point have been made using multiple observatories separated azimuthally. Here, we present the first multipoint analysis of MHD turbulence across ICME plasma regions, using four spacecraft at the Sun-Earth L1 point, separated by 80 RE along the dawn-dusk direction. Previous studies reveal that ICME shocks, sheaths, and magnetic clouds are highly non-uniform, with strong azimuthal variability. Using high-resolution magnetic field observations from ISRO's Aditya-L1, NASA's Wind and ACE, and NOAA's DSCOVR, we analyze turbulence associated with the 10th October 2024 solar storm, which triggered the second-strongest geomagnetic storm of solar cycle 25. Our results reveal significant variability and differing turbulence maturity across small separations, supported by analysis of field-aligned and perpendicular magnetic field cascades, indicating strong anisotropies. Sheath turbulence is substantially modified by shock induced energy injection. Evidence of compressible turbulence and plasma energization at the flux rope interaction region indicates that internal processes, such as magnetic reconnection, strongly influence ICME plasma evolution, highlighting pronounced spatial variability in turbulence and plasma states observed by multiple L1 monitors near Earth and underscoring their potential role in space weather impacts.
#### Solar active region scaling laws revisited

 - **Abstract**
 The systematic variation of solar active region (AR) properties with their magnetic flux has been the subject of numerous studies but the proposed scaling laws still vary rather widely. A correct representation of these laws and the deviations from them is important for modelling the source term in surface flux transport and dynamo models of space climate variation, and it may also help constrain the subsurface origin of active regions. Here we determine active region scaling laws based on the recently constructed ARISE active region data base listing bipolar ARs for cycle 23, 24 and 25. For the area $A$, pole separation $d$ and tilt angle $\gamma$ we find scalings against magnetic flux $\Phi$ and heliographic latitude $\lambda$. Residuals from these relations are also modelled. These scaling relations are recommended for use in space climate research for the modelling of future data or missing past data, as well as for the identification of candidate rogue ARs. We confirm that the tilt angle distribution of non-Hale ARs shows a significant excess at low tilts (anti-Hale ARs). In contrast to earlier studies we show that neither the anti-Hale ARs nor non-Hales in general follow Joy's law: instead, their tilt angle distribution is best represented by vanishing mean tilt. These results are most easily reconciled with a scenario where the AR flux loops originate in the deep convective zone or below, gaining tilt during their rise under the action of the Coriolis force. A small fraction of the loops is subjected to extreme, intermittent torques resulting in either very large tilts or anti-Hale orientation. Anti-Hale ARs are suggested to be fully curled `XO-loops', and their excess is caused by a simple mechanical effect, as the contact of their legs increases resistance against further deformation by the torque.

 - **Abstract**
 The observations of protostellar systems show a transition in the radial profile of specific angular momentum (and rotational velocity), evolving from $j\sim{\rm constant}$ ($v_{\phi}\sim r^{-1}$) in the infalling-rotating envelope to $j\propto r^{1/2}$ ($v_{\phi}\sim r^{-1/2}$) in the Keplerian disk. We employ global MHD disk simulations of gravitational collapse starting from a supercritical prestellar core, that forms a disk and envelope structure in a self-consistent manner, in order to determine the physics of the Envelope-Disk Transition Zone (ENDTRANZ). Our numerical results show the transition from the infalling-rotating envelope to Keplerian disk happens through a jump in the $j-r$ profile over a finite radial range, which is characterized by the positive local gravitational torques. The outer edge of the ENDTRANZ is identified where the radial infall speed ($v_r$) begins a sharp decline in magnitude and $j$ begins a transition from $j\sim{\rm constant}$ toward $j\sim r^{1/2}$. Moving radially inward, the centrifugal radius ($r_{\rm CR}$) is defined where $v_{\phi}$ first transitions to Keplerian velocity at the disk's edge. Farther inward of $r_{\rm CR}$, model disk develops a super-Keplerian rotation due to self-gravity. The inner edge of the ENDTRANZ is defined at the centrifugal barrier ($r_{\rm CB}$) where $v_r$ drops to negligible values. Inside $r_{\rm CB}$, a net negative gravitational torque drives mass accretion onto the protostar. On observational grounds, we identify a jump in the observed $j-r$ profile in L1527 IRS for the first time using the ALMA eDisk data. Comparison with the numerical radial behavior from our MHD disk simulations suggests the observed $j-r$ jump can be used as a kinematical tracer for the existence of ENDTRANZ. Our results offer insights into the observable imprint of angular momentum redistribution mechanisms during star-disk formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutron stars in globular clusters follow complex evolutionary pathways shaped by binary interactions, mass transfer, and dynamical exchanges. Direct N-body simulations such as NBODY6++GPU successfully model stellar dynamics and compact object formation, but they usually do not track pulsar spin evolution or magnetic field decay explicitly. Building on Papers I and II of this series, we identify this gap and present a case study from an existing simulation with N = 105000 particles, showing how a neutron star forms and evolves for 200 Myr without any pulsar-physics tracking. We compare this situation with recent implementations and outline a seven-scenario framework that includes magnetic dipole spin-down, exponential magnetic field decay, environmental torques, accretion-driven spin-up, gravitational-wave emission, and merger-driven evolution. As an example, the neutron star we label Pulsar973 forms at t = 800 Myr with a post-supernova mass of 5.35 solar masses and evolves to 2.52 solar masses by t = 1000 Myr, but still lacks period P, period derivative Pdot, magnetic field B, and scenario classification. We provide mathematical formulations and specific integration points within NBODY6++GPU (Hermite scheme, Ahmad-Cohen neighbors, KS regularization, and BSE stellar evolution) to enable scenario-based pulsar evolution within direct N-body simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 GPM 1839-10 is an intriguing long-period radio transient (LPT), distinguished by its activity spanning at least three decades and its highly unusual emission characteristics. These features include orthogonal polarization mode (OPM) switches, down-drifting sub-structures, and distinct linear-to-circular polarization conversion behaviors. In this work, we present follow-up observations utilizing the FAST telescope at L-band, yielding a total of seven detected radio pulses. We find a consistent association between OPM switches and a decrease in polarized intensity. This feature strongly supports the hypothesis that the OPM switches are generated by the incoherent summation of OPMs. Our measured Rotation Measures (RMs) are consistent with previous observations, indicating that the magneto-ionic environment is stable. If the source is in a binary system, such stability suggests it may host a weakly magnetized companion. Crucially, we firstly observe clear evidence of a cyclotron absorption feature in one radio pulse, a signature rarely observed in radio sources. This feature allows us to infer that the magnetic field strength at the absorption site has a lower limit of tens of Gauss, which is necessary for the phenomenon to occur. This characteristic can be explained in a scenario where GPM 1839-10 possesses a weakly magnetized companion star.
#### Dynamical Preconditions for Ice Formation in Supernova Remnant and Cloud Interactions: A 2D MHD Study

 - **Abstract**
 Water ice has been detected in several supernova remnants despite the strong heating and radiation in these environments. This challenges standard expectations for dust survival. Using two dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we study how a supernova shock interacts with a dense interstellar cloud. The simulations show that the shock naturally compresses the cloud into dense structures similar to those inferred in well known remnants. Although temperatures remain high in the adiabatic phase, simple considerations indicate that cooling would act quickly once included. These results suggest that shock cloud interactions create the physical conditions needed for water ice to form. Future work including radiative cooling and grain surface chemistry will allow direct modelling of ice growth in these compressed regions.

 - **Abstract**
 The Milky Way hosts astrophysical accelerators capable of producing high-energy cosmic rays. These cosmic rays can interact with the interstellar medium (ISM) across the Galaxy to produce neutrinos and gamma rays (propagation component), while their interactions with ambient material at their acceleration sites, such as supernova remnants, can give rise to the source component of the gamma-ray and neutrino flux. In this paper, we estimate the source component of the Galactic neutrino flux using simulated populations of Galactic gamma-ray sources. We compare our results with observations from neutrino experiments in the energy range of 1-30 TeV. Using simulated populations of Galactic TeV gamma-ray sources, we exploit the correlation between gamma rays and neutrinos and introduce a bracketing approach to constrain the range for the source contribution of the Galactic neutrino flux. For the upper limit, we used a simulation describing the entity of Galactic gamma-ray sources, whereas the lower limit was estimated using the hadronic component of the Galactic supernova remnant population. Our results show that the difference between this maximum and minimum is less than an order of magnitude and the flux range is comparable to the Galactic neutrino flux from the cosmic-ray interaction with the ISM. The results agree with the observed signals from IceCube and ANTARES and suggest that the propagation component, combined with the minimum source contribution predicted by the supernova-remnant model, approaches the observed neutrino flux, leaving little room for significant enhancements of the emission originating from propagating cosmic rays.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive stars dominate the radiative and mechanical feedback of young stellar populations, yet their intense ultraviolet fields and strong winds are typically presumed to preclude Earth-like habitability. We quantify this expectation by mapping time dependent habitable zones (HZs) for solar-metallicity stars with initial masses of $0.8$-$120\,M_\odot$. From rotating and non-rotating \textsc{GENEC} tracks we derive bolometric ``climate'' HZ boundaries and enforce XUV energy-limited escape and wind ram-pressure retention constraints for a dipole-magnetized Earth analogue. The operational inner edge is set by the most restrictive limit, and we measure the annulus lifetime, the longest continuous residence at fixed orbit, and the maximum number of dynamically packed terrestrial planets it can host. We find a sharp main-sequence ceiling: while a $9\,M_\odot$ star sustains an operational HZ for $\sim 30$~Myr at $\sim 70$-$130$~AU, the main-sequence annulus becomes brief and extremely narrow by $12\,M_\odot$ and disappears by $15\,M_\odot$. Post main-sequence evolution can reopen HZs up to $\sim 25$-$30\,M_\odot$, but only for $\sim 0.03$-$1.5$~Myr at hundreds to $\sim 10^3$~AU, disappearing by $\sim 40\,M_\odot$. Rotation modestly increases habitable lifetimes near the upper main sequence without altering the high mass ceiling. Initial Mass Function (IMF) weighting shows that massive stars contribute only $\sim 10^{-4}$ of the habitable planet-time budget. Even so, they still add of order a few $10^{5}$ operationally habitable Earth analogues to the Milky Way at any instant. This implies that massive star systems are unlikely to dominate the Galaxy wide habitability budget, but they may still provide a set of short-lived, observationally distinct targets for biosignature searches.

 - **Abstract**
 Modern studies in astrophysics and cosmology increasingly rely on simulations and cross-survey analyses, yet differences in data generation, instrumentation, calibration, and unmodeled physics introduce distribution mismatches between datasets (``domain shift''). In machine-learning pipelines, this occurs when the joint distribution of inputs and labels differs between the training (source) and application (target) domains, causing source-trained models to underperform on the target. Transfer learning and domain adaptation provide principled ways to mitigate this effect. We study a concrete simulation-to-observation case: semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) to transfer a four-class spectral classifier -- high-redshift quasars, low-redshift quasars, galaxies, and stars -- from J-PAS mock catalogs based on DESI spectra to real J-PAS observations. Our pipeline pretrains on abundant labeled DESI$\rightarrow$J-PAS mocks and adapts to the target domain using a small labeled J-PAS subset. We benchmark SSDA against two baselines: a J-PAS--only supervised model trained with the same target-label budget, and a mocks-only model evaluated on held-out J-PAS data. On this held-out J-PAS data, SSDA achieves a macro-F1 score (balancing precision and recall) of $0.82$ and an overall true positive rate of $0.89$, compared to $0.79/0.85$ for the J-PAS--only baseline and $0.73/0.87$ for the mocks-only model. The gains are driven primarily by improved quasar classification, especially in the high-redshift subclass ($\mathrm{F1}=0.66$ vs.\ $0.55/0.37$), yielding better-calibrated candidate lists for spectroscopic targeting (e.g., WEAVE-QSO) and AGN searches. This study shows how modest target supervision enables robust, data-efficient simulation-to-observation transfer when simulations are plentiful but target labels are scarce.

 Little attention has been paid to group velocities of three-dimensional (3D) MHD waves in solar coronal seismology. This study aims to present a rather comprehensive examination on the group velocities of trapped 3D kink modes in coronal slabs, emphasizing the connection of mode analysis to both mode characterization and impulsively excited 3D kink waves. We work in linear, ideal, pressureless MHD, and take the equilibrium slab to be symmetrically structured only in one transverse direction. The dispersion relation is numerically solved, with the results understood by making in-depth analytical progress. We address both the transverse fundamental and its first overtone. We develop a three-subgroup scheme for categorizing 3D kink modes on the plane spanned by the axial and out-of-plane wavenumbers. The group ($\vec{v}_{\rm gr}$) and phase velocities ($\vec{v}_{\rm ph}$) sit on the same side of the equilibrium magnetic field ($\vec{B}_0$) for the ``$\vec{B}_0$-same-side A'' and ``$\vec{B}_0$-same-side F'' subgroups, which are further discriminated by the directional similarity of $\vec{v}_{\rm gr}$ and $\vec{B}_0$. The ``$\vec{B}_0$-straddling'' subgroup is peculiar in that $\vec{v}_{\rm gr}$ and $\vec{v}_{\rm ph}$ lie astride $\vec{B}_0$, a feature that cannot be found for waves in unbounded uniform media in pressureless MHD. This ``$\vec{B}_0$-straddling'' subgroup pertains to both the fundamental and its overtones. We further place our results in the context of impulsive waves, employing the method of stationary phase to predict the large-time wavefront morphology in the plane of symmetry of the equilibrium slab. Wavefronts directed toward $\vec{B}_0$ derive exclusively from ``$\vec{B}_0$-straddling'' modes, and are confined to narrow sectors.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a parametric strong-lensing model for the galaxy cluster MACS J1931.8-2635 ($z_l = 0.35$), accompanying the detection of the spectroscopically confirmed SN Eos at $z = 5.13$ (Coulter et al. 2026). We identify 10 new multiple-image systems in recent VENUS JWST/NIRCam imaging, so that the model is constrained with a total of 19 robust multiple-image systems -- nine of which also have a spectroscopic redshift. For the point-like source corresponding to SN Eos, our model predicts a total of five images, with the observed radial image pair having a similar magnification of $\mu \simeq 25 - 30$ and a small time delay of $< 5$ days, in agreement with their simultaneous observation. According to the model, the other three predicted images arrived earlier, with time delays of $3.7 \pm 0.7$, $3.5 \pm 0.7$ and $54.0 \pm 10.8$ years prior to the two observed images, and with magnifications of $12.9 \pm 2.6$, $13.0 \pm 2.9$ and $2.2 \pm 0.4$, respectively. The absence of detections at the predicted positions, where the host galaxy's images are also visible, confirms the transient nature of the source. SN Eos and its host galaxy are studied in separate articles, and we here focus on the lens model. The final model reaches a very good $r.m.s.$ distance between model and observations of $0.44''$. We present the lens-modeling results, including newly identified systems such as a triply imaged, grand-design spiral galaxy candidate at $z \simeq 3.65_{-0.09}^{+0.04}$, and briefly discuss the potential of using high-redshift lensed SNe for cosmography.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic properties of dust grains play a fundamental role in their alignment with ambient magnetic fields and magnetic dipole emission. In the radiative torque (RAT) paradigm, superparamagnetic inclusions (SPIs) embedded within dust grains are expected to significantly enhance magnetic susceptibility and alignment efficiency. Previous studies have generally assumed SPIs of a single characteristic size. In this work, we develop an effective superparamagnetism model that explicitly accounts for a power-law size distribution of SPIs. We show that the effective zero-frequency susceptibility can be described by the superparamagnetic susceptibility of uniform-sized inclusions evaluated at the critical blocking size, reduced by a factor $F_{\rm eff}\sim 0.1$. It exhibits a slight increase with dust temperature $T_{d}$, in contrast to the rapid decrease for the case of single-size SPIs. For rotating grains at angular frequency $\omega$, we identify a characteristic resonance size of SPIs that dominates the magnetic response, $N_{\rm res} = (T_{d}/T_{\rm act}) \ln (\nu_{0}/\omega)$ with $T_{\rm act}$ activation temperature and $\nu_{0}$ the characteristic attempt frequency of SPIs. The frequency-dependent effective susceptibility is well described by the maximum susceptibility $\chi_{\rm eff}^{\rm max}(\omega)$ at $N_{\rm res}$, reduced by a factor $G_{\rm eff}\sim 0.1$. Unlike models assuming uniform-sized inclusions, we find that the effective susceptibility exhibits a nearly flat spectrum for frequency below $\nu_{0}$, arising from the progressive activation of larger inclusions at lower frequencies. This effective superparamagnetism model based on the SPI size distrbution has important implications for magnetic grain alignment, dust polarization, and magnetic dipole emission across diverse environments.

 - **Abstract**
 The center of the Galaxy is a prominent source in X-rays and gamma-rays. The study of its high-energy (HE) emission is crucial in understanding the physical phenomena taking place in this dense and extreme environment, where the closest supermassive black hole (SMBH) to us, Sgr A*, is lurking nearly invisible, today, in most of the energy spectrum. These phenomena are probably common to other galactic nuclei and may explain the feedback processes between nuclear regions and galaxies, so important for the overall evolution of the Universe. The Galactic center HE emission is very complex and consists of both thermal and non thermal radiation produced by compact and extended sources, surrounded by more diffuse components. All these objects and media are interacting with each other in the narrow and dense Central Molecular Zone (CMZ). Some of them also show relevant extensions towards the Galactic poles, indicating energetic outflows that seem to link the center to the recently observed large Galactic polar structures. In spite of the fundamental advances obtained in the last twenty five years with the most sensitive X-ray and gamma-ray observatories, several questions remain open to investigations. We review here the main observational results and the open issues on the high-energy diagnostics of the Galactic nuclear activity, focusing on processes that take place in the CMZ, and in particular discussing the role of the present and past SMBH activities in powering this region and possibly the whole Galaxy.
#### Nonlinear diffusive shock acceleration with upstream escape reproduces DAMPE observations

 - **Abstract**
 We develop a self-consistent nonlinear extension of diffusive shock acceleration that incorporates cosmic ray (CR) backreaction on the shock precursor together with a physically motivated upstream-escape mechanism that produces an exponential high energy cutoff. The CR pressure gradient decelerates the upstream flow facing the shock wave, generating an extended precursor in which higher rigidity particles sample a larger cumulative velocity gradient and thereby acquire a progressively harder spectrum. Finite-size/escape effects are modeled by a momentum-dependent loss term, which naturally terminates acceleration and steepens the spectrum near the cutoff. The precursor compression ratio is not imposed as a closure condition but is determined dynamically by requiring consistency between the injection rate inferred from thermal leakage at the subshock and the injection strength demanded by the nonlinear shock modification, with CR-driven wave heating providing stabilizing negative feedback. Applying the model to young supernova-remnant-like parameters and standard one-zone Galactic diffusion, we reproduce the main features of the latest DAMPE proton spectrum: gradual hardening from hundreds of GeV to multi-TeV energies and a subsequent exponential cutoff at tens of TeV. The resulting spectral evolution follows directly from the competition between precursor-mediated nonlinear feedback and upstream escape.

 - **Abstract**
 In the I-band color-magnitude diagrams (CMD) of resolved nearby galaxies, the reddest asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars form a previously unremarked-upon, but nevertheless distinct and easily-identified population of high-luminosity stars. Hereafter we refer to this population as being comprised of I-Band AGB (IAGB) stars. Identifying these stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) and in NGC4258 (for all three of which there are published geometric distances) we find that the marginalized luminosity functions are each well approximated by single-peaked Gaussians, having one-sigma dispersions of +/- 0.22 mag, +/- 0.25 mag and +/- 0.24 mag, respectively. The zero points for the modal I-band absolute magnitudes of IAGB stars are found to be M_I = -4.49 +/- 0.003 mag (stat) in the LMC (4204 stars), M_I = -4.67 +/- 0.008 mag (stat), for the SMC sample (916 stars), and M_I = -4.78 +/- 0.030 mag (stat) for NGC4258 (62 stars). A global average over these three independent calibrations of the IAGB zero point (weighted inversely by squares of their systematic errors) gives <M_I> = -4.65 +/- 0.119 mag (stat) +/- 0.025 (sys). In Paper II we will show the results of applying the IAGB Method to 92 galaxies additional galaxies resolved by HST, reaching out to distances just short of 10 Mpc.

 - **Abstract**
 We demonstrate that magnetospheric interactions between merging neutron stars (NSs) generate dual-jetted current outflows, analogous to the Alfvén wings observed during planetary interactions in the Solar System. Using 3D relativistic MHD simulations, we model the interaction as a conducting sphere moving through a highly magnetized plasma of the companion's magnetosphere. Unusually, the interaction operates in a regime that is relativistic yet sub-Alfvénic. Electromagnetic draping amplifies magnetic fields in a narrow layer near the stellar surface, leading to the generation of electric currents along the local magnetic field. The generation of beamed outflows enhances instantaneous power of the pulsar-like radio and high energy emission, produces spin/orbital modulations, and is likely to lead to observable precursor emission preceding the main gravitational wave event.

 - **Abstract**
 Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of 92 galaxies that have a strong showing of I-band Asymptotic Giant Branch (IAGB) stars in their color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), are used to measure the relative offset between the mean apparent I-band magnitudes of the IAGB population and the corresponding apparent I-band magnitudes of the TRGB as measured in the same frames (and CMDs) of those individual galaxies. This first exploratory, large-sample comparison is independent of any extinction (foreground or internal) that may be shared by these two populations. The marginalized luminosity functions used to determine the modal value of the {\it IAGB } population are well fit by a single, symmetric Gaussian. The difference in the two apparent magnitudes (in the sense IAGB minus TRGB) is -0.589 mag, with a combined standard deviation of +/- 0.119 mag. Adopting M_I = -4.05 mag for the TRGB stars, the modal absolute magnitude of the IAGB is then calculated to be M_I(IAGB) = -4.64 +/- 0.12 mag. The ensemble dispersion quoted above gives a standard error on the mean of +/- 0.012 mag (based on the full sample of 92 galaxies). Independently, the three geometry-based zero points for I-band AGB stars are found (in Paper I) to be M_I = -4.49 +/- 0.003~mag in the LMC (4204 stars), M_I = -4.67 +/- 0.008 mag, for the SMC (916 stars) and M_I = -4.78 +/- 0.030 mag for NGC4258 (62 stars), leading to a global zero-point (weighted) average of <M_I> = -4.64 +/- 0.15 mag (stat). The scatter found in the anchors is comparable to the scatter in the field sample discussed here, but the calibration sample is small. The application of this method to galaxies well outside of the Local Group, shows that these standard candles can readily be found and measured out to at least 9 Mpc, using already available archival data

 - **Abstract**
 We construct a concept-object knowledge graph from the full astro-ph corpus through July 2025. Using an automated pipeline, we extract named astrophysical objects from OCR-processed papers, resolve them to SIMBAD identifiers, and link them to scientific concepts annotated in the source corpus. We then test whether historical graph structure can forecast new concept-object associations before they appear in print. Because the concepts are derived from clustering and therefore overlap semantically, we apply an inference-time concept-similarity smoothing step uniformly to all methods. Across four temporal cutoffs on a physically meaningful subset of concepts, an implicit-feedback matrix factorization model (alternating least squares, ALS) with smoothing outperforms the strongest neighborhood baseline (KNN using text-embedding concept similarity) by 16.8% on NDCG@100 (0.144 vs 0.123) and 19.8% on Recall@100 (0.175 vs 0.146), and exceeds the best recency heuristic by 96% and 88%, respectively. These results indicate that historical literature encodes predictive structure not captured by global heuristics or local neighborhood voting, suggesting a path toward tools that could help triage follow-up targets for scarce telescope time.

 - **Abstract**
 The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has enabled the discovery of hundreds of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at redshifts $z\gtrsim 4-7$. A non-negligible fraction of these SMBHs are hosted in galaxies with BH-to-galaxy mass ratios ($M_{\rm BH}/M_\star$) being excessively larger than that for local SMBHs by $\sim 1-2$ dex. The origin of these ``overmassive'' BHs remains elusive, demanding either a heavy seed formation scenario or rapid growth of seed BHs. Their deviation from local scaling relations challenges our understanding of how SMBHs and their host galaxies coevolve across cosmic time. In this paper, we apply phenomenological modelings for BHs and galaxies to dark matter halo merger histories from N-body simulations to investigate the subsequent evolution of JWST-discovered ``overmassive'' SMBHs. We find that early evolution of ``overmassive'' SMBHs is dominated by stunted accretion leading to gradual decreases in $M_{\rm BH}/M_\star$ ratios. In contrast, less massive SMBHs experience super-Eddington accretion during their early evolution, resulting in a slow increase of mass ratios toward $M_{\rm BH}/M_\star \sim 0.01$. Convergence occurs at $M_{\rm BH}\sim 10^8~M_\odot$ with $M_{\rm BH}/M_\star \sim 0.01$. At lower redshift, nearly all SMBHs evolve onto local relations, as expected given that our models adopt empirical relations derived from low-redshift observations. This suggests that the global feedback mechanisms regulating the coevolution of $M_{\rm BH}/M_\star$ ratios are implicitly encoded in local relations in terms of star-formation rate distribution, black hole accretion rate distribution and their active (quiescent) fractions.

 - **Abstract**
 A model-agnostic description of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) feature in redshift space requires a number of ingredients. Physically, one must describe the impact of cosmological bulk flows which progressively and anisotropically smear out the feature over time. One must also model the effects of the scale dependence of tracer bias and the mode coupling between short and long scales. All of these can be incorporated using the Zel'dovich approximation alone, without reference to any particular cosmological model. On the technical front, one needs a robust, complete and cosmology-independent basis to describe the shape of the real space BAO feature in linear theory, which can then be propagated to the nonlinearly evolved, measured feature in redshift space. In this work, we describe how these ingredients -- which we have systematically constructed in recent work -- come together in an accurate framework capable of describing the BAO-scale pairwise measurements of state-of-the-art galaxy surveys. Using mock observations and $N$-body simulations, we show that our template-free framework can produce unbiased and precise cosmological constraints for samples with realistic levels of nonlinearity. This work represents one of the final steps in constructing a data-ready analysis framework for model-agnostic cosmological inference from the BAO feature.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic fields are known to efficiently redistribute angular momentum in stars. They have been recently measured in the cores of red giant stars using asteroseismology. It was shown that core magnetic fields, if unaccounted for, can bias the measurements of the gravity offset $\epsilon_g$, which is otherwise well characterised for red giants. Exploiting this bias as a way to detect magnetic fields in the cores of red giants, we wish to increase the number of magnetic field detections in red giants, but also to establish a method that could be widely applicable to all red giants. We selected 218 Kepler red giants showing abnormal measured values of $\epsilon_g$. We used robust statistical criteria based on the expected lifetime of mixed modes to identify significant modes. We then adjusted an asymptotic expression for mixed modes to the observed frequencies, taking magnetic field and rotation into account, using Bayesian inference. We then assessed the probability of magnetic field detection and measured the magnetic field intensity using stellar models for the favourable cases. We found new magnetic red giant stars with fields ranging from 34 to 260 kG. For these stars, we measured values for $\epsilon_g$ now in agreement with the expected value. Adding these new detections to those of previous studies, we showed that the mass distribution of magnetic giants is similar to that of the complete catalogue of red giants, but different from the mass distribution of red giants with suppressed dipole modes. We also found that the core rotation of magnetic red giants follows a similar distribution as red giants in general. This could either mean that the detected fields do not have a predominant impact on the redistribution of angular momentum, or that other red giants also harbour an internal field that is currently non-detectable or has not yet been detected.
#### Large-scale and local environmental drivers of quenching: tracing H$α$ concentration in X-ray and optical galaxy groups

 - **Abstract**
 To explore the environmental mechanisms causing quenching in nearby star-forming galaxies, we study the variation with local and large-scale environments of a star formation concentration index, C-index $\equiv\log{(r_{50,{\rm H}\alpha}/r_{50,\rm cont}})$, that traces the spatially-resolved distribution of H$\alpha$ emission. Our analysis combines (i) GAMA spectroscopic redshift survey data to optically select galaxy groups and reconstruct the cosmic web, (ii) eROSITA data to identify X-ray-emitting groups, and (iii) SAMI Galaxy Survey data to characterise spatially-resolved star formation. We find that galaxies in X-ray+optical groups exhibit the lowest median C-index and the highest fraction of centrally-concentrated star-forming galaxies relative to optical groups and the field (independently of group or stellar mass). Star-forming galaxies in more X-ray luminous groups at fixed dynamical mass show more concentrated star formation. At large scales, nodes show the lowest median C-index and the highest fraction of centrally-concentrated star-forming galaxies relative to filaments and voids, which have similar C-index distributions. C-index correlates most strongly with the distance to the closest node, leaving no significant role for other local or large-scale environment metrics. Finally, regular star-forming galaxies tend to have spins aligned parallel to filaments, consistent with smooth gas accretion, while centrally-concentrated galaxies tend have spins aligned perpendicular to filaments, likely driven by mergers and associated with bulge growth. These results suggest that multi-scale environmental processes, i.e. locally and at large-scale, act to concentrate star formation toward galaxy centres, via gas-related mechanisms in nodes and ram-pressure stripping in X-ray+optical groups.

 HESS J0852-463 is a TeV {\gamma}-ray source located in the Galactic plane. The region consists of a supernova remnant (SNR, RX J0852.0-4622) with a shell-like morphology, commonly referred to as Vela Junior, and a pulsar denoted PSR J0855-4644. Pulsars are among the most efficient leptonic accelerators in our Galaxy, making this region particularly interesting to study. We utilise the most recent data taken by the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.), to investigate any {\gamma}-ray emission associated with the pulsar in this region, PSR J0855-4644. We applied a full forward folding method on the H.E.S.S. data. Utilising 3D modelling techniques, we evaluated the TeV {\gamma}-ray emission towards the various components of this complex system. The distinct energy-dependent morphology observed in our data motivates further investigation of this source. We resolved the emission in the Vela Junior region into various components, several of which correspond to the SNR itself. In particular, we find a new extended component which is coincident with the position of PSR J0855-4644. The spectrum follows a power-law distribution with a best-fit index of {\Gamma}E = 1.81 \pm 0.07stat which differs from the properties of the surrounding {\gamma}-ray emission of the Vela Junior SNR. A one-zone leptonic joint fit between the X-rays (from XMM-Newton) and {\gamma}-rays (from H.E.S.S.) leads to a lower limit on the magnetic field of 1.6{\mu}G and a spectral index of {\alpha} = 1.88 \pm 0.01, in line with expectations of pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe). In this paper, we report the first detection of the PWN of PSR J0855-4644 at TeV energies with the H.E.S.S. experiment at a significance of 12.2{\sigma}. This is attributed to the advanced techniques of the 3D analysis. Based on the pulsar's characteristics, its PWN is consistent with the known TeV PWNe population in the Galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 Quantum gravity theories often modify spacetime symmetries. In particular, Lorentz invariance may be violated when approaching the Planck scale. Although the scales at which interactions occur in extensive air showers induced by ultra-high-energy cosmic rays in the atmosphere are many orders of magnitude below the Planck scale, these violations might still be observable. In this work, the fluctuations in the number of muons in the extensive air showers measured at the Pierre Auger Observatory are exploited, for the first time, to constrain Lorentz invariance violations. The bounds derived in the hadronic sector are the strongest ever obtained, and do not rely on assumptions about the mass composition of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. The fluctuations in the number of muons constitute a new and powerful observable to further explore Lorentz invariance in a region of the parameter space not accessible to other observables.

 - **Abstract**
 Miras and other long-period variable (LPV) stars on the AGB follow period-luminosity (PL) relations. These relations have been difficult to study for Galactic LPVs because their distances were poorly known in the past. We aim to establish the PL relations of solar-neighbourhood Miras for several near-IR photometric bands. To this end, we used multi-epoch photometry from the DIRBE and unTimely/WISE catalogues, Gaia parallax distances, and contemporary pulsation periods obtained from optical observations of a well-selected sample of solar-neighbourhood Miras. We show that clearly defined PL relations in the nine investigated near-IR bands emerge from our data, and we report the slopes and zero-point magnitudes. We find that Galactic Miras are fainter in the near-IR than their Large Magellanic Cloud siblings. We derive average period-temperature, period-bolometric-luminosity, and period-radius relations from fits to synthetic SEDs constructed from the PL relations. By applying AGB evolutionary models, the scatter of stars around the PL sequences can also be used to test whether the parallax uncertainties quoted in the Gaia catalogue are realistic. Furthermore, we performed such tests based on a comparison with parallaxes obtained with the VLBI and with a sample of LPVs in the globular cluster 47 Tuc. We conclude that, for Galactic Miras with a fractional parallax uncertainty of <0.1 in the Gaia catalogue, the parallax uncertainty is underestimated by factors between 1.0 and 1.7, and most likely by $\sim1.3$. For more uncertain parallaxes, we find evidence that the distances (parallaxes) are generally overestimated (underestimated). Nevertheless, we find strong evidence that the large error-inflation factors reported for AGB stars in the literature are unrealistic. Our results lend confidence to the parallax measurements of these highly extended, variable stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Astrochemical observations have revealed a surprisingly high level of chemical complexity, including long carbon chains, in the earliest stages of Sun-like star formation. The origin of these species and whether they undergo further growth, possibly contributing to the molecular complexity of planetary systems, remain open questions. We present recent observations performed using the 100-m Green Bank Telescope of the prestellar core L1544 and the protostellar system IRAS 16293-2422. In L1544, we detected several complex carbon-bearing species, including $\mathrm{C_2S}$, $\mathrm{C_3S}$, $\mathrm{C_3N}$, $\mathrm{c\text{-}C_3H}$, $\mathrm{C_4H}$, and $\mathrm{C_6H}$, complementing previously reported emission of cyanopolyynes. In IRAS 16293-2422, we detected $\mathrm{c\text{-}C_3H}$ and, for the first time, $\mathrm{HC_7N}$. Thanks to the high spectral resolution, we refine the rest frequencies of several $\mathrm{c\text{-}C_3H}$ and $\mathrm{C_6H}$ transitions. We perform radiative transfer analysis, highlighting a chemical difference between the two sources: IRAS 16293-2422 shows column densities 10-100 times lower than L1544. We perform astrochemical modeling, employing an up-to-date chemical network with revised reaction rates. The models reproduce the general trends, with cyanopolyyne and polyynyl radical abundances decreasing as molecular size increases, but they underestimate the abundances of cyanopolyynes longer than $\mathrm{HC_5N}$ by up to two orders of magnitude. Current models, which include the dominant neutral-neutral formation routes, cannot account for this discrepancy, suggesting that the chemical network is incomplete. We propose that additional ion-molecule reactions are crucial for the formation of these species. Developing a more comprehensive chemical network for long carbon chains is essential for accurately interpreting present and future observations.

 - **Abstract**
 It has long been suspected that black hole accretion-outflow coupling is invariant from the stellar to supermassive scales. Stellar mass black hole accretion flows are known to launch jets and outflows as they transition through critical accretion rate thresholds, with values well constrained observationally owing to their short evolutionary timescales. In contrast, accretion flows in typical supermassive black hole (SMBH) systems (those in active galactic nuclei) evolve over thousands of years, making the critical transitions at which jets are launched impossible to constrain in individual systems. Tidal disruption events (TDEs) provide the unique opportunity to witness the birth and evolution of an accretion flow onto a SMBH which evolves on timescales of years. Here we show that TDEs launch outflows during a super-Eddington accretion phase and a second, physically distinct outflow, at a critical accretion rate of $L_{\rm crit} \approx0.02$ $L_{\rm Edd}$, the same as the critical accretion rate for state transitions observed in accreting stellar mass black holes. This work naturally explains the mechanism, observed properties, and detection rate for prompt and delayed outflows observed in TDEs, which until now have been open problems. More broadly, we demonstrate that SMBHs exhibit the same accretion-outflow coupling as stellar mass black holes and that the critical low accretion rate threshold for jet formation in black holes is scale invariant.

 - **Abstract**
 NGC 4631 X-8 is an ultraluminous X-ray pulsar (ULXP) having a spin period of about 9.7 s, discovered using XMM-Newton observations in 2025. The pulsar is known to show one of the largest spin-up rates ($\sim 9.6 \times 10^{-8}$ s s$^{-1}$) among the ULXP population. We explore the surface magnetic field of the neutron star in this source using different models, and find that the inferred magnetic field lies in the range of about $0.3-2 \times 10^{14}$G. We study the long-term magnetic field and spin period evolution of the pulsar assuming steady accretion using prevalent theoretical mechanisms and find that the pulsar will evolve to become a millisecond pulsar having decayed magnetic field of about $\sim 10^{9}$G in about a million years. The scenario of the formation of a millisecond pulsar is also probed using an estimate of the super-Eddington duty cycle of about 14% from the literature, which suggests that the neutron star would accrete sufficient matter to become a recycled millisecond pulsar. Exploring the magnetic field as well as the spin period evolution properties of ULXPs may enable us to understand the poorly understood evolutionary features of ULXPs, shed light on one of the pathways of millisecond pulsar formation and also help us to understand transient super-Eddington accretion phases in newborn magnetars, which are believed to power energetic events such as long gamma-ray bursts and Type I superluminous supernovae.

 - **Abstract**
 We present imaging and spectroscopic analyses of Chandra and XMM-Newton observations of ACT-CL J0123.5$-$0428, one of the most massive, highest redshift galaxy clusters detected within the survey fields of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope. The Chandra data are sufficient to characterize the morphology of this cluster and constrain the geometrically deprojected temperature in 2 spatial bins out to $r_{2500}$, revealing a dynamically relaxed system whose temperature drops to $kT = 1.8\pm0.6$ keV in the inner $\sim40$kpc. Within this same inner radius, the surface brightness and density of the ICM is sharply peaked, and the cooling time falls to $t_\mathrm{cool}=280^{+150}_{-120}$ Myr. A novel forward-modeling analysis of the XMM data extends imaging and spectroscopic measurements of this system out to $r_{500}$, constraining the redshift to $z=1.50\pm0.03$, with a mean temperature of $kT = 7.3\pm1.1$ keV and an emission-weighted mean metallicity of $Z/Z_\odot = 0.43^{+0.46}_{-0.25}$. We also utilize the limited optical/IR photometric coverage of the cluster to characterize the properties of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG), which is coincident with the X-ray peak. Despite the high redshift and strong cool core, the BCG exhibits no signs of recent or ongoing star formation, suggesting AGN feedback has been acting persistently to stem star formation since $z\sim 2.5$. These measurements identify ACT-CL J0123.5$-$0428 as the highest redshift, dynamically relaxed, cool core galaxy cluster discovered to date, making it a premier target for future astrophysical and cosmological studies.

 - **Abstract**
 The results of interferometric observations of the star-forming region S255IR in the frequency range 210--250 GHz are presented. The observations were carried out with the antenna array SMA (Hawaii, USA). Fifty-three molecules were detected, including complex organic molecules (COMs) such as CH$_3$CHO, CH$_3$CN, CH$_3$CH$_2$CN, and many others. Typical rotational temperatures in the hot core SMA1 fall in the range 100--200 K. Optical depths in the lines of methanol and some other molecules in the cores SMA1 and SMA2 were estimated. In SMA1, the optical depth of one of the strongest methanol lines, $5_{-1}-4_{-1}E$, proved to be $23.8 \pm 1.5$. Based on this value, one can assume that the lines of other oxygen-containing COMs, such as CH$_3$OCHO, CH$_3$OCH$_3$, CH$_3$CH$_2$OH, which are typically much less abundant in hot cores than methanol, are optically thin in SMA1. Most of the detected molecules can be roughly divided into two groups. The molecules of the first group emit exclusively toward the hot core SMA1, while some or all lines of the molecules of the second group, in addition to SMA1, can be seen toward a ring-like structure to the west of SMA1. This structure is most likely associated with the walls of a cavity formed by high-velocity outflows driven by young stellar objects (YSOs) in molecular cores SMA1, SMA2, and possibly SMA3. The gas temperature and density in the cavity walls were estimated using methanol lines. The temperature was found to be about 50--60 K, and the density about $10^7-10^8$ cm$^{-3}$. The column density of methanol near the brightness peaks in the lines of this molecule is about $5\times 10^{15}$~cm$^{-2}$. The column densities of other COMs in the ring-like structure will be determined in future studies with increased sensitivity achieved by spectral line stacking.

 - **Abstract**
 Long-period radio transients (LPTs) are a new class of radio sources characterized by long spin periods ($P_{\text{spin}}>10^3$ s) and highly variable radio emission. While known magnetars are relatively young ($\tau<10^5$ yrs) with spin periods clustered between $1-10$ sec, it has been proposed that LPTs may be linked to a missing population of older magnetars. In this paper, we present an extensive parametric analysis of isolated magnetar spin evolution using various propeller spin-down models. In general, at higher initial magnetar B-fields ($B_0>\sim10^{15}$ G) and larger ambient densities ($n_0>\sim10^2$ cm$^{-3}$), magnetars will transition to the propeller phase earlier, and they start accreting gas from the ISM or molecular clouds after $\tau\sim10^8$ yrs. We found that a transition from the pulsar to the propeller phase is required to reach the observed LPT period range of $P>10^3$ s. More specifically, our population synthesis study based on Monte-Carlo simulations shows that two propeller models can account for most of the observed LPT periods ($P\sim1-400$ [min]) and their period derivative constraints ($\dot{P}<10^{-9}$ s s$^{-1}$). Our spin-down models predict that (1) nearby radio-quiet neutron stars with the estimated dipole $B$-field range of $B\sim(1-5)\times10^{13}$ G will transition to the propeller phase eventually after $\tau>\sim10^7$ yrs; (2) thermal X-ray emission from accretion-phase magnetars becomes too faint for detection after traveling ($d>\sim10$ kpc) from their birth places; (3) sporadic radio outbursts observed from LPTs may not be explained by regular radio pulsar and magnetar emission mechanisms that operate during the propeller phase.
