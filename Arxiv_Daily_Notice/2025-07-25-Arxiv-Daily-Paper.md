 - **Abstract**
 Over the past few years \textit{JWST} has been a major workhorse in detecting and constraining the metal enrichment of the first galaxies in the early Universe and finding the source of the ionisation of their interstellar medium. In this work, we present new deep JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy of GS-z11-1, a galaxy at z = 11.28, in which we report the detection of multiple rest-frame UV and optical emission lines: CIII]$\lambda\lambda$1907,09, CIV]$\lambda\lambda$1548,51, [OII]$\lambda\lambda$3726,29, [NeIII]$\lambda$3869, H$\gamma$ and tentative evidence for HeII$\lambda$1640. The ionisation properties of GS-z11-1 are consistent with star formation, with potential contribution from an active galactic nucleus (AGN). We estimate a galaxy stellar mass of log(M$_{*}$/M$_{\odot}$) = 7.8$\pm$0.2 and log(SFR/(M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$))= 0.32$\pm$0.11 for the fiducial SF-only models. We measured C/O from the SED modelling of C/O = 1.20$\pm0.15 \times$ solar. This is one of the highest C/O abundances at z$>$10, and it is consistent with either PopII and PopIII enrichment paths. Despite this source being extremely compact, with a half-light radius of 73$\pm$10 pc, we see no increased equivalent width of NIV] and NIII] emission lines as seen in some other compact sources at similar redshifts, a potential signature of second-generation stars in GCs. Overall, this galaxy exhibits low metallicity and high ionisation parameter consistent with intense star-formation or AGN activity in the early Universe, possibly observed before the enrichment by the second generation of stars in proto-globular clusters in the core of the galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 Simulating black hole (BH) accretion and feedback from the horizon to galactic scales is extremely challenging, as it involves a vast range of scales. Recently, our multizone method has successfully achieved global dynamical steady-states of hot accretion flows in three-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations by tracking the bidirectional interaction between a non-spinning BH and its host galaxy. In this paper, we present technical improvements to the method and apply it to spin $a_*=0.9$ BHs, which power relativistic jets. We first test the new multizone set-up with a smaller Bondi radius, $R_B\approx400\,r_g$, where $r_g$ is the gravitational radius. The strongly magnetized accretion launches a relativistic jet with an intermediate feedback efficiency $\eta\sim30\,\%$, in between that of a prograde ($\eta\sim100\,\%$) and retrograde ($\eta\sim 10\,\%$) torus. Interestingly, both prograde and retrograde simulations also eventually converge to the same intermediate efficiency when evolved long enough, as accumulated magnetic fields remove gas rotation. We then extend strongly magnetized simulations to larger Bondi radii, $R_B\approx 2\times10^3,~2\times 10^4,~2\times 10^5\,r_g$. We find that the BH accretion rate $\dot{M}$ is suppressed with respect to the Bondi rate $\dot{M}_B$ as $\dot{M}/\dot{M}_B\propto R_B^{-1/2}$. However, despite some variability, the time-averaged feedback efficiency is $\eta\sim30\,\%$, independent of $R_B$. This suggests that BH feedback efficiency in hot accretion flows is mainly governed by the BH spin ($a_*$) rather than by the galactic properties ($R_B$). From these first-principles simulations, we provide a feedback subgrid prescription for cosmological simulations: $\dot{E}_{\rm fb}=2\times10^{-3}[R_B/(2\times10^5\,r_g)]^{-1/2}\dot{M}_Bc^2$ for BH spin $a_*=0.9$.

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are the strongest explosions in the Universe, and are powered by initially ultra-relativistic jets. The angular profile of GRB jets encodes important information about their launching and propagation near the central source, and can be probed through their afterglow emission. Detailed analysis of the multi-wavelength afterglow light curves of recent GRBs indeed shows evidence for an extended angular structure beyond the jet's narrow core. The afterglow emission is determined by the jet angular structure, our viewing angle, and the magnetic field structure behind the shock, often leading to degeneracies when considering the light curves and broad-band spectrum alone. Such degeneracies can be lifted with joint modeling of the afterglow light curves and polarization. In this work we study the evolution of the afterglow linear polarization and flux density from steep, core-dominated GRB jets, where most of their energy resides within a narrow core. We explore the dependence of the light and polarization curves on the viewing angle, jet angular energy structure and magnetic field configuration, and provide an analytical approximation for the peak polarization level, which occurs at a time close to that of a break in the light curve. Finally, we demonstrate how our results can be used to determine the nature of orphan GRB afterglows, distinguishing between a quasi-spherical "dirty fireball" and a steep jets viewed far off-axis and apply them on the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) detected orphan afterglow candidate AT2021lfa.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic strings appear in many well-motivated extensions to the standard model of particle physics. If they exist, an abundant population of compact objects known as cosmic string loops permeate the Universe at all times, providing a secondary source of density perturbations that are large amplitude and non-gaussian in nature. In general, these loops are not stationary in the rest frame of the dark matter, thus their relative velocities will typically seed both spherical and filamentary overdensities in the matter era. Building upon previous work, we provide an improved framework to compute the complete halo mass function for these string seeded overdensities, valid for any loop velocity distribution. Using this mass function, we also compute the subset of halos capable of undergoing a direct collapse, forming a population of black holes with initial mass $10^{4-5} \, M_{\odot}$ at high redshifts. Interestingly, for reasonable values of the string parameters, one can reproduce the abundance of ``Little Red Dots" as inferred by JWST.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the neutrino and gravitational wave (GW) signals from accretion disks formed during the failed collapse of a rotating massive star (a collapsar). Following black hole formation, a neutrino-cooled, shocked accretion disk forms, which displays non-spherical oscillations for a period of seconds before becoming advective and exploding the star. We compute the neutrino and GW signals (matter quadrupole) from collapsar disks using global axisymmetric, viscous hydrodynamic simulations. The neutrino signal with typical energies of O$(10)$ MeV is maximal during the neutrino-cooled (NDAF) phase that follows shock formation. This phase lasts for a few seconds and is easily detectable within O$(10-100)$ kpc by the IceCube Neutrino Telescope. Additional neutrino signatures from a precursor equatorial shock and by stochastic accretion plumes during the advective phase are detectable within the galaxy. The GW signal during the NDAF phase is detectable in the galaxy by current and next-generation ground-based observatories. The explosion (memory) GW signal is similar to that of standard core-collapse supernovae and can be probed with a deci-Hertz space-based detector. Shock oscillations during the NDAF phase impart time variations with frequency O$(10-100)$ Hz to the neutrino and GW signals, encoding information about the shock dynamics and inner disk. These time variations can be detectable in neutrinos by IceCube within O$(1-10)$ kpc depending on progenitor model, flavor transformation scenario, and detailed properties of the angular momentum transport mechanism.

 - **Abstract**
 Observational astronomy has undergone a significant transformation driven by large-scale surveys, such as the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS) Survey, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), and the Gaia Mission. These programs yield large, complex datasets that pose significant challenges for conventional analysis methods, and as a result, many different machine learning techniques are being tested and deployed. We introduce a new approach to analyzing multiband photometry by using a long-short term memory autoencoder (LSTM-AE). This model views mean measurements of multicolor photometry as a sequence in wavelength in order to encode patterns present in the stars' spectral energy distributions (SEDs) into a two-dimensional latent space. We showcase this by using Pan-STARRS grizy mean magnitudes, and we use globular clusters, labels from SIMBAD, Gaia DR3 parallaxes, and PanSTARRS images to aid our analysis and understanding of the latent space. For 3,112,259 stars in an annulus around the North Galactic Cap, 99.51% have their full SED shape reconstructed--that is the absolute difference between the observed and the model predicted magnitude in every band--within five hundredths of a magnitude. We show that the model likely denoises photometric data, potentially improving the quality of measurements. Lastly, we show that the detection of rare stellar types can be performed by analyzing poorly reconstructed photometry.
#### Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars as high-energy neutrino sources

 - **Abstract**
 The astrophysical sources responsible for the production of high energy neutrinos remain largely uncertain. The strongest associations suggest a correlation between neutrinos and active galactic nuclei (AGN). However, it is still unclear which specific regions and mechanisms of the accreting supermassive black hole (SMBH) are responsible for their production. In this paper we investigate the correlation between the positions of IceCat-1 neutrino events and a large, optically selected QSO catalog extracted from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Within this sample, we distinguish radio-quiet QSOs from flat-spectrum radio QSOs (FSRQs)based on radio emission data from the Cosmic Lens All Sky Survey (CLASS) catalog. While the associations between neutrino events and radio-quiet QSOs are consistent with being all random matches, FSRQs exhibit a moderately significant correlation (2.7 sigma) with neutrino positions. Additionally we observe that the distribution of minimum distances between neutrino events and FSRQs differs significantly for events at declinations above and below 20 deg. In particular, using the KS test, we find that the high-declination event distribution shows a strong deviation (4 sigma) from a random distribution. We interpret all these results as an indication that a large fraction (> 60%) of the neutrino events observed by IceCube could be produced by the FSRQ and that the emission mechanism is likely related to the relativistic jets rather than the "radio-quiet" (RQ) component of these sources, such as the accretion disk or corona.
#### Four decades of photometry of XX Trianguli, `the most spotted star' in the sky

 - **Abstract**
 Over the past 40 years the brightness variations of XX Tri, a single line RS CVn type binary system with a synchronized K-giant primary, has exceeded one magnitude in the V band. Although these changes are primarily caused by starspots, an additional activity-related mechanism may also be behind the long-term trend of overall brightness increase. By compiling the most complete photometric data set so far, we attempt to examine how the nature of seasonal-to-decadal changes can be linked to global magnetism. The long-term brightening of XX Tri was accompanied by a gradual increase in the effective temperature, which resulted in a blueing shift in the Herzsprung-Russell diagram. In the long term, a constant cycle of about 4 years is most strongly present in the entire data. Besides, we also found a modulation of about 11 years, and a slowly decreasing cycle of about 5.7-5.2 years. From the seasonal datasets we found that the most dominant rotation-related periods are scattered around the orbital period. From this we infer a solar-type surface differential rotation, although the surface shear is significantly smaller than that of the Sun. The 4-year cycle indicates flip-flop-like behavior: during this time, the 2-3 active longitudes usually present on the stellar surface are rearranged. The magnitude-range changes in the long term cannot be interpreted solely as changes in the number and size of spots; the unspotted brightness of XX Tri has also increased over the decades. This should alert users of photometric spot models to reconsider the basic concept of constant unspotted brightness in similar cases.

 - **Abstract**
 Although interstellar dust extinction serves as a powerful distance estimator, the solar system's location within the Galactic plane complicates distance determinations, especially for molecular clouds (MCs) at varying distances along the line of sight (LoS). The presence of complex extinction patterns along LoS introduces degeneracies, resulting in less accurate distance measurements to overlapping MCs in crowded regions of the Galactic plane. In this study, we develop the CUSUM-based Jump-point Analysis for Distance Estimation (CU-JADE), a novel method designed to help mitigate these observational challenges. The key strengths of CU-JADE include: (1) sensitivity to detect abrupt jumps in $Distance$-$A_{\lambda}$ ($D$-$A$) datasets, (2) minimal systematic errors as demonstrated on both mock and observed data, and (3) the ability to combine CUSUM analysis with multi-wavelength data to improve the completeness of distance measurements for nearby gas structures, even for extinction values as low as $\Delta A_{V} \gtrsim 0.15$ mag. By combining CO survey data with a large sample of stars characterized by high-precision parallaxes and extinctions, we uncovered the multi-layered molecular gas distribution in the high-latitude Cepheus region. We also determined accurate distances to MCs beyond the Cygnus Rift by analyzing the intricate structure of gas and extinction within the Galactic plane. Additionally, we constructed a full-sky 3D extinction map extending to 4 kpc, which provides critical insights into dense interstellar medium components dominated by molecular hydrogen. These results advance our understanding of the spatial distribution and physical properties of MCs across the Milky Way.

 - **Abstract**
 Fermi-type shear particle acceleration is a promising mechanism for sustaining ultra-relativistic particles along the kilo-parsec scale jets in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). We explore the possibility of synchrotron-limited electron acceleration in mildly relativistic shearing flows and present numerical solutions to the corresponding particle transport equation. We compare our findings with analytical calculations to infer an effective electron cutoff energy, and discuss the relationship to a simplified box model treatment. The results show that mildly relativistic large-scale jets offer a suitable environment for distributed electron acceleration beyond Lorentz factors of $\gamma_e \sim 10^8$.

 - **Abstract**
 We aim to construct a comprehensive global multi-scale kinematic equilibrium radiative-transfer model for the pre-transitional disc of DoAr 44 (Haro 1-16, V2062 Oph) in the Ophiuchus star-forming region. This model integrates diverse observational datasets to describe the system, spanning from the accretion region to the outer disc. Our analysis utilises a large set of observational data, including ALMA continuum complex visibilities, VLTI/GRAVITY continuum squared visibilities, closure phases, and triple products, as well as VLT/UVES and VLT/X-shooter H-alpha spectra. Additionally, we incorporated absolute flux measurements from ground-based optical observatories, Spitzer, IRAS, the Submillimeter Array, the IRAM, or the ATCA radio telescopes. These data sets were used to constrain the structure and kinematics of the object through radiative-transfer modelling. Our model reveals that the spectral line profiles are best explained by an optically thin spherical inflow/outflow within the co-rotation radius of the star, exhibiting velocities exceeding 380 km/s. The VLTI near-infrared interferometric observations are consistent with an inner disc extending from 0.1 to 0.2 au. The ALMA sub-millimetre observations indicate a dust ring located between 36 and 56 au, probably related to the CO2 condensation line. The global density and temperature profiles derived from our model provide insight into an intermediate disc, located in the terrestrial planet-forming zone, which has not yet been spatially resolved.

 - **Abstract**
 Diffuse non-thermal (NT) emission from the central starburst (CSB) of M82 has been measured at radio, X-ray and gamma-ray energies. Far-infrared (FIR), radio, and X-ray emission maps are mutually consistent, with radio and X-ray emissions spectrally similar - suggesting the latter to be Compton/FIR radiation. We present our analysis of 16.3 years of Fermi-LAT measurements, which - combined with newly-published VERITAS data - constitute the deepest, most extensive currently available gamma-ray dataset on M82. We model the NT radio to gamma-ray emission of the CSB as due to relativistic particles (CR). Key features of our models are the identification of the >50 GeV emission as pionic and the use of X-ray and radio emission to calibrate the CRe spectrum. This enables determination of the zero-point and slope of the CRp (and secondary CRe) spectrum, and meaningful estimates of the energy densities of CR and magnetic fields. We consider all relevant radiative processes involving CR, and use published detailed descriptions of the soft radiation fields in the CSB region - the most important of which is the FIR field, modeled as a graybody. Our SED modeling indicates that 1) the >10 GeV emission is mostly pionic, 2) the 0.1 < E/GeV < 10 emission is a combination of pionic and Compton/starlight (and subdominant NT bremss), 3) the <0.1 GeV gamma-ray emission is leptonic, and 4) the radio spectrum arises from primary and secondary CRe synchrotron at comparable levels: the corresponding CRe populations are described by a PL and a curved spectrum, respectively. Averaged over the FIR graybody models, the CRp spectral index and energy density are 2.3 and 385 eV/cm3 (for n(H) = 200 1/cm3), the primary-CRe and CRp maximum energies are 30 GeV and 7 TeV, and the magnetic field is B = 120 uG. The derived CR and B energy densities are in equipartition.

 - **Abstract**
 The orbital regime of a terrestrial planet plays a significant role in shaping its atmospheric dynamics, climate, and hence potential habitability. The orbit is also likely to play a role in shaping the response of a planetary atmosphere to the influx of material from an icy cometary impact. To investigate this response, we model the impact of an icy cometary body with an Earth-analogue exoplanet (i.e. an Earth-like planet orbiting a Sun-like star with a diurnal cycle) using a cometary impact and breakup model coupled with the 3D Earth-System-Model WACCM6/CESM2. To quantify the role that the atmospheric dynamics play in setting the response to a cometary impact, we compare our results with a previous study investigating an impact with a tidally-locked terrestrial exoplanet. We find that the circulation regime of the planet plays a key role in shaping the response of the atmosphere to an icy cometary impact. The weak, multi-celled circulation structure that forms on Earth-like planets is efficient at mixing material horizontally but not vertically, limiting the transport of water from the deep break-up site to higher altitudes. In turn, this limits the rate of water photodissociation at low pressures, reducing the magnitude of post-impact changes to composition. It also reduces the potential observability of an impact due to weakened cloud ice formation, and hence scattering, at low pressures. Despite this, small changes to the overall composition of the planet persist to quasi-steady-state, reinforcing the idea that ongoing bombardment may help to shape the composition/habitability of terrestrial worlds.

 - **Abstract**
 Short gamma-ray bursts are expected to be associated with compact object mergers, such as binary neutron star or neutron star-black hole systems, and are key high-energy multimessenger events. The detection of GRB 170817A, coinciding with the gravitational wave signal GW170817 from a BNS merger, confirmed the link between sGRBs and compact object mergers. Similarly, GRB 150101B displayed remarkable similarities to GRB 170817A, further supporting its association with compact binary mergers. The objective of this study is to uncover the intrinsic properties that differentiate merger-associated sGRBs from other GRBs by analyzing the Fermi GBM Burst Catalog and using GRB 170817A and GRB 150101B as reference events, enhancing our ability to select events from this class and promptly to search for their electromagnetic counterpart. We employed a clustering technique to classify GRBs based on their observed properties in gamma-rays (T90, Epeak and fluence). Prior to clustering, we tested three dimensionality reduction techniques, among which Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection demonstrated the best performance making it the preferred technique for our analysis. This combination of dimensionality reduction and clustering analysis allowed us to group GRBs with similar characteristics, with a focus on identifying those most likely associated with BNS mergers. Our analysis successfully identified a cluster of sGRBs events with characteristics consistent with sGRB merger-associated. A comparison between our sample of candidates and known kilonova candidates associated with sGRBs, identified through other methodologies, further validated our approach.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper examines the reliability of the Tremaine-Weinberg (TW) method in measuring the pattern speed of barred galaxies at high redshifts. Measuring pattern speeds at high redshift may help to shed light on the time evolution of interactions between galactic bars and dark matter halos. The TW method has been extensively employed for nearby galaxies, and its accuracy in determining bar pattern speeds has been validated through numerical simulations. For nearby galaxies, the method yields acceptable results when the inclination angle of the galaxy and the position angle of the bar fall within appropriate ranges. However, the application of the TW method to high-redshift galaxies remains unexplored in both observations and simulations. In this study, we generate mock observations of barred galaxies from the TNG50 cosmological simulation. These simulated observations are tailored to mimic the Integral Field Unit (IFU) spectroscopy data that the Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) would capture at a redshift of $z\simeq 1.2$. By applying the TW method to these mock observations and comparing the results with the known pattern speeds, we demonstrate that the TW method performs adequately for barred galaxies with bars sufficiently long to be detected by JWST at high redshifts. This work opens a new avenue for applying the TW method to investigate the properties of high-redshift barred galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy interactions can disturb gas in galactic discs, compress it, excite it, and enhance star formation. An intriguing system likely consisting of two interacting galaxies overlapping on the line-of-sight was previously studied through ionised gas observations from the integral-field spectrograph Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO (MaNGA). A decomposition into two components using MaNGA spectra, together with a multi-wavelength study, allowed to characterise the system as a minor-merger with interaction-induced star-formation, and maybe AGN activity. We use new interferometric observations of the CO(1-0) gas of this system from the NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) to confront and combine the spatially-resolved ionised and molecular gas observations. Mock NOEMA and MaNGA data are computed from simulated systems of two discs and compared to the observations. The NOEMA observations of the molecular gas, dynamically colder than the ionised gas, help to precise the configuration of the system, which we revisit as being a major merger. Combination of ionised and molecular gas data allow us to study the star-formation efficiency of the system.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutron stars emitting continuous gravitational waves may be regarded as gravitational pulsars, in the sense that it could be possible to track the evolution of their rotational period with long-baseline observations of next-generation gravitational wave interferometers. Assuming that the pulsar's electromagnetic signal is tracked and allows us to monitor the pulsar's spin evolution, we provide a physical interpretation of the possible observed correlation between this timing solution and its gravitational counterpart, if the system is also detected in gravitational waves. In particular, we show that next-generation detectors, such as the Einstein Telescope, could have the sensitivity to discern different models for the coupling between the superfluid and normal components of the neutron star and constrain the origin of timing noise (whether due to magnetospheric or internal processes). Observational confirmation of one of the proposed scenarios would therefore provide valuable information on the physics of gravitational wave emission from pulsars.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar activity can be witnessed in the form of sunspots and active regions, where the magnetic field is enhanced by up to a factor 1000 as compared to that of the quiet Sun. In addition, solar activity manifests itself in terms of flares, jets, coronal mass ejections, and production of highly energetic particles. All these processes are governed by the solar magnetic field. Here we study the spatial reach of the influence of the magnetic field of active regions on the photosphere and in the solar corona. An active region is modelled by a magnetic dipole located under the photosphere. This simplified description allows us to study the spatial influence of an active region in the solar atmosphere in a rough but easy way. We find that the area of influence of the magnetic field of an active region on the solar atmosphere increases with, both, the maximum strength of the magnetic field in the active region and the depth of the dipole under the photosphere. For a typical active region, the magnetic field can be neglected for distances beyond ca. 700 Mm on the photosphere and two solar radii in the solar corona.

 - **Abstract**
 SN\,2025kg, linked to EP250108a, is among the brightest broad-lined Type Ic supernova (SN Ic-BL) known, showing unique helium absorptions, a late-time broad H$\alpha$, and an early bump. In this {\em{Letter}}, we propose a jet-cocoon origin to explain EP250108a as off-axis cooling emission from a mildly relativistic inner cocoon viewed at $\sim45^\circ$ and the early bump of SN\,2025kg as the outer cocoon cooling emission, both constraining an energy of $\sim(1-2)\times10^{52}{\rm{erg}}$ and a progenitor radius of $\sim5\,R_\odot$. To explain SN\,2025kg's exceptionally luminous peak, potential energy injection into the $\sim2.5\,M_\odot$ ejecta from a magnetar with initial period $\sim1.7\,{\rm{ms}}$ and magnetic field $\sim2\times10^{15}{\rm{G}}$ may be required, implying a rapidly rotating $\sim4\,M_\odot$ progenitor. Thus, the progenitor may be a low-mass helium star with an extended helium envelope, supported by helium absorption lines and an inferred weak pre-SN wind. Hydrogen-rich material may reside in the inner ejecta layers, as suggested by the late-time broad H$\alpha$, possibly originating from main-sequence companion material evaporated by the magnetar wind. Since the observed near-solar metallicity challenges the popular quasi-chemically homogeneous evolution channel, the rapidly rotating helium-star progenitor of EP250108a/SN\,2025kg might attain angular momentum by being tidally spun up by a main-sequence companion in a close binary formed through isolated binary evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the influence of large-scale cosmic web environments on galaxy quenching using a volume-limited, stellar mass-matched galaxy sample from SDSS DR18. Galaxies are classified as residing in sheets, filaments, or clusters based on the eigenvalues of the tidal tensor derived from the smoothed density field. The quenched fraction increases with stellar mass and is highest in clusters, intermediate in filaments, and lowest in sheets, reflecting the increasing efficiency of environmental quenching with density. A flattening of the quenched fraction beyond $\log_{10}(M_\star/M_\odot) \sim 10.6$ across all environments signals a transition from environment-driven to mass-driven quenching. In contrast, the bulge fraction continues to rise beyond this threshold, indicating a decoupling between star formation suppression and morphological transformation. At the high-mass end ($\log_{10}(M_\star/M_\odot) \gtrsim 11.5$), both quenched and bulge fractions bifurcate, increasing in clusters but declining in sheets, suggesting a divergent evolutionary pathway where massive galaxies in sheets retain cold gas and disk-like morphologies, potentially sustaining or rejuvenating star formation. The AGN fraction also increases with stellar mass and is somewhat higher in sheets than in clusters, indicating enhanced AGN activity in low-density, gas-rich environments. The high-mass trends are independently corroborated by our analysis of specific star formation rate, $(u-r)$ colour, concentration index, and D4000 in the stellar mass-density plane, which show that massive galaxies in sheets remain bluer, younger, more star-forming, and structurally less evolved than their cluster counterparts. Our results highlight the cosmic web as an active driver of galaxy evolution.
