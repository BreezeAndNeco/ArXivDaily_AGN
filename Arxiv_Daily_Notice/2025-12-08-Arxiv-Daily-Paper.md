 - **Abstract**
 "Little red dots" (LRDs) represent a new population of astronomical objects uncovered by JWST whose nature remains debated. Although many LRDs are suspected as active galactic nuclei (AGN), they show little variability on days-years timescales. We report the discovery of two gravitationally lensed LRDs at redshift $\sim$4.3 behind the cluster RXCJ2211-0350, one of which (RX1) is quadruply imaged with time delays spanning $\sim$130 years. RX1 exhibits intrinsic color and brightness variations of up to 0.7 magnitude among its images. These changes are consistent with blackbody-temperature variations of a photosphere, indicating long-term variability analogous to Cepheid-like pulsations but in a far more extended ($R \sim 2000$ AU) and massive ($M \gtrsim 10^6 \, M_{\odot}$) systems. These results suggest LRDs as a distinct class of AGN with stellar-like envelopes.

 - **Abstract**
 The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will expand the reach of gravitational microlensing surveys by increasing the number of events monitored and the precision of their light curves. We investigate Roman's ability to detect triple-lens microlensing systems, cases where a foreground star with two bound exoplanets produces detectable anomalies in a microlensing event, using its planned high-cadence observations toward the Galactic bulge. We simulate a large set of high-magnification microlensing light curves based on Roman's expected survey characteristics. A detection criterion, based on a required $\chi^2$ improvement for a two-planet model, is applied to determine whether the second planet can be reliably distinguished from a single-planet (binary-lens) model. Our simulations show that the majority of two-planet microlensing events would be detectable with Roman. Events in which both planets are relatively massive (planet-star mass ratios of order $10^{-3}$), or in which the more massive planet occupies a favorable resonant configuration, produce strong central perturbations, resulting in detection efficiencies of roughly 90\%. By contrast, systems with only low-mass planets ($q \sim 10^{-4}$) or with less favorable alignments generate much weaker signals, which often fall below the detection threshold. In general, the planetary mass ratios and the resulting caustic geometry (e.g., central caustic size in resonant versus wide/close orbits) are the dominant factors governing detectability. Taking into account the expected frequency of planetary systems and the fraction of high-magnification events, we estimate that Roman will detect a high-magnification triple-lens event in approximately 4.5\% of multi-planet microlensing events, corresponding to about 64 events over the course of the full survey.

 - **Abstract**
 We use machine learning to measure the intracluster light (ICL) fractions of 177 galaxy groups and clusters identified from Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program imaging to explore how the ICL varies with the properties of its host cluster. We study the variation in ICL fraction with host cluster redshift, halo mass, and magnitude gap to investigate how the ICL develops over time, in various cluster environments, and with cluster relaxation. We find that there is a decreasing correlation with redshift (Spearman correlation $r_S=-0.604$, p-value $=9\times10^{-10}$), however this can be plausibly accounted for by including the effects of cosmological surface brightness dimming and the passive aging of stellar populations. There is a weak negative correlation with halo mass ($r_S=-0.330$, p-value $=8\times 10^{-5}$) where ICL fractions are higher in lower halo mass groups than higher halo mass clusters. We also find that there is a marginal positive correlation with magnitude gap ($r_S=0.226$, p-value = 0.01), indicating that relaxed clusters are more likely to host higher ICL fractions. These results are consistent with a scenario where the dominant formation mechanism of the ICL is galaxy-galaxy interactions such as tidal stripping, and demonstrates the capability of the method to easily construct large samples and study large-scale trends in the ICL fraction.
#### Keck Observations in the INfrared of Taurus and $ρ$ Oph Exoplanets And Ultracool dwarfs (KOINTREAU) I: A Planetary-Mass Companion and a Disk-Obscured Stellar Companion Discovered in Taurus

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first discoveries from Keck Observations in the INfrared of Taurus and $\rho$ Oph Exoplanets And Ultracool dwarfs (KOINTREAU), an adaptive optics imaging survey of young stars in the Taurus and $\rho$ Oph star-forming regions using the Keck infrared pyramid wavefront sensor (PyWFS). We have found two faint ($\Delta$K~7 mag), wide-separation companions to two ~3-Myr-old Taurus members. Relative astrometry for these systems show that both companions are bound to their host stars. We obtained near-infrared spectra of these companions using IRTF/SpeX (R~100) and Gemini/GNIRS (R~1000-2000), and combine these with photometry from our NIRC2 imaging, the Pan-STARRS survey, and Spitzer/IRAC archival imaging to constrain their properties. One companion, KOINTREAU-1b (at a projected separation of 690 au), has an average near-IR spectral type of M9$\pm$2, a gravity classification of VL-G, and a changing spectral type between the SpeX (M7) and GNIRS (L1) observations. We estimate this object's mass to be $10.6^{+2.5}_{-2.3}$ M$_{\rm Jup}$, making KOINTREAU-1b the fifth planetary-mass companion found in Taurus. The other companion, KOINTREAU-2b (projected separation 560 au), has a spectral type of M4.5$\pm$1 but is ~4 magnitudes underluminous relative to other Taurus stars of the same spectral type. We detect exceptionally strong He I 1.083 micron emission from this object, indicative of outflows driven by ongoing accretion, but with a conspicuous lack of accompanying H emission. We conclude that KOINTREAU-2b is a young star obscured by an edge-on disk and observed in scattered light. Finally, we derive a distortion solution for NIRC2 imaging which shows a 0.118° difference in position angle from the previous distortion solution.

 - **Abstract**
 A number of simulations have seen the emergence of strongly-toroidally-magnetized accretion disks from interstellar medium inflows. Recently, Guo et al. 2025 (G25) studied an idealized test problem of toroidally-magnetized disks in isothermal ideal MHD with an Eulerian static-mesh method, and argued the midplane behavior changes qualitatively (with a significant loss of toroidal magnetic flux) when the the thermal scale-length is resolved ($\Delta x < H_{\rm thermal}$). We rerun the G25 test problem with two Lagrangian methods: meshless finite-mass, and meshless finite-volume. We show that Lagrangian methods reproduce the high-resolution ($\Delta x \ll H_{\rm thermal}$) Eulerian G25 results. At low resolution ($\Delta x \gg H_{\rm thermal}$), behaviors differ: Lagrangian methods still lose flux and evolve 'as close as possible' to the converged solution, while Eulerian methods show no evolution. We argue this difference in convergence behavior is related to the ability of Lagrangian codes to follow flows to an arbitrarily thin midplane layer, analogous to the well-studied difference in Jeans fragmentation problems. This and results from other higher-resolution simulations and different codes suggest that the sustained midplane toroidal fields seen in recent Lagrangian multi-scale, multi-physics simulations cannot be a numerical resolution effect, and some physical difference between those simulations and the G25 test problem explains their different behaviors.
#### GA-NIFS: A smouldering disk galaxy undergoing ordered rotation at z=4.26

 - **Abstract**
 Rotating galaxies with relaxed gaseous disks have been discovered across cosmic time, from the local Universe to high redshift (z>4). But few such sources have been confirmed at z>4, making them a precious sample to examine what conditions result in such ordered kinematics in an early, more chaotic Universe. One of the best examples of this sample is the galaxy DLA0817g1 (z=4.2603), which shows remarkably clear rotation in ALMA [CII] data. We present recent JWST/NIRSpec IFU data (R~2700) of DLA0817g1, which we combine with archival ALMA [CII] observations to place constraints on its ISM conditions and morpho-kinematics. From a combination of line ratios, we find a high gas-phase metallicity (~0.7 solar), high fraction of obscured star formation, low ionisation (compared to other high-redshift galaxies observed with JWST), and no significant evidence for AGN (based on the WHAN diagnostic). Dynamical modelling with 3DBarolo reveal nearly identical rotation in Halpha and [CII], but with a higher velocity dispersion in the former. Using our metallicity estimate and previous CO and [CII] detections, we derive a new estimate of the molecular gas mass, relieving a previous strain in the mass budget. Altogether, we suggest that this is a 'smouldering' galaxy, where past star formation resulted in significant chemical enrichment (i.e., Zgas and Mdust), but the current activity is low (i.e., lower ionisation parameter and electron temperature). These new observations have opened a window into questions regarding the interplay of gas, metallicity, star formation, and kinematics in a prototypical early disk galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 Rapid detection and follow-up of electromagnetic (EM) counterparts to gravitational wave (GW) signals from binary neutron star (BNS) mergers are essential for constraining source properties and probing the physics of relativistic transients. Observational strategies for these early EM searches are therefore critical, yet current practice remains suboptimal, motivating improved, coordination-aware approaches. We propose and evaluate the Two-Step Localization strategy, a coordinated observational protocol in which one wide-field auxiliary telescope and one narrow-field main telescope monitor the evolving GW sky localization in real time. The auxiliary telescope, by virtue of its large field of view, has a higher probability of detecting early EM emission. Upon registering a candidate signal, it triggers the main telescope to slew to the inferred location for prompt, high-resolution follow-up. We assess the performance of Two-Step Localization using large-scale simulations that incorporate dynamic sky-map updates, realistic telescope parameters, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)-weighted localization contours. For context, we compare Two-Step Localization to two benchmark strategies lacking coordination. Our results demonstrate that Two-Step Localization significantly reduces the median detection latency, highlighting the effectiveness of targeted cooperation in the early-time discovery of EM counterparts. Our results point to the most impactful next step: next-generation faster telescopes that deliver drastically higher slew rates and shorter scan times, reducing the number of required tiles; a deeper, truly wide-field auxiliary improves coverage more than simply adding more telescopes.

 - **Abstract**
 Novae are thermonuclear eruptions on accreting white dwarfs in interacting binaries. Although most of the accreted envelope is expelled, the mechanism -- impulsive ejection, multiple outflows or prolonged winds, or a common-envelope interaction -- remains uncertain. GeV $\gamma$-ray detections from $>20$ Galactic novae establish these eruptions as nearby laboratories for shock physics and particle acceleration, underscoring the need to determine how novae eject their envelopes. Here we report on near-infrared interferometry, supported with multiwavelength observations, of two $\gamma$-ray detected novae. The images of the very fast 2021 nova V1674~Her, taken just 2--3 days after discovery, reveal the presence of two perpendicular outflows. The interaction between these outflows likely drives the observed $\gamma$-ray emission. Conversely, the images of the very slow 2021 nova V1405~Cas suggest a delay in the ejection of the bulk of the accreted envelope of more than 50 days after the start of eruption, as the nova slowly rises to visible peak and during which the envelope engulfed the system in a common envelope phase. These unprecedented images offer direct observational evidence that the mechanisms driving mass ejection from the surfaces of accreting white dwarfs are not as simple as previously thought, revealing multiple outflows and delayed ejections.

 - **Abstract**
 We discuss synchrotron absorption of a short electromagnetic pulse that propagates in a cold magnetized pair plasma. We show that the pulse can be absorbed when $\omega_{\rm B}/a_0< \omega< a_0\omega_{\rm B}$, where $a_0>1$ is the strength parameter of the pulse, and $\omega$ and $\omega_{\rm B}$ respectively are the frequency of the wave and the cyclotron frequency in the background magnetic field (all quantities are defined in the reference frame where the particles are at rest before being illuminated by the pulse). The condition $\omega_{\rm B}/a_0< \omega< a_0\omega_{\rm B}$ is essentially a generalization of the cyclotron resonance to strong electromagnetic pulses with $a_0>1$. When $\omega_{\rm B}/a_0< \omega< a_0\omega_{\rm B}$, the propagation of electromagnetic waves in a plasma can be very different with respect to the propagation in vacuum because the wave equation is strongly non-linear. Then it is unclear whether the particles are heated stochastically due to synchrotron absorption, as found by studying the motion of a test particle in the field of a vacuum electromagnetic wave. We discuss implications of our results for constraining emission models of fast radio bursts.

 - **Abstract**
 Radio pulsar timing, X-ray pulse profile modeling or gravitational-wave detections of binary mergers involving at least one neutron star offer the opportunity to elucidate the properties of dense and neutron rich matter in thermodynamic regimes inaccessible to nuclear laboratories. Such inference relies on building appropriate equation-of-state priors, such as the recently introduced semi-agnostic constructions that incorporate nuclear theory and experimental information available in low to intermediate density regimes, while offering the necessary flexibility at high density. In this paper, we assess how detections of mass, radius, and tidal deformability for low-mass ($\sim 1$M$_{\odot}$) or high-mass ($\sim 1.9$M$_{\odot}$) neutron stars would contribute to constraining nuclear empirical parameters in an inference based on semi-agnostic equation-of-state priors. We first assessed the correlation factors between nuclear empirical parameters and the zero-temperature and $\beta$-equilibrated pressure in different regimes of density. We then simulate observations for three nucleonic equations of state to test the recovery of the corresponding nuclear empirical parameters. We show that not all nuclear empirical parameters significantly correlate with the pressure and find a competition between them in the high-density regime that challenges their inference. We also find that using semi-agnostic constructions instead of assuming a nucleonic content up to the highest densities in the neutron-star core can help recover more accurately the true nuclear empirical parameters. Parameterizing the high-density regime of the equation of state with the nucleonic meta-model can pollute the inference of nuclear empirical parameters; semi-agnostic constructions are a solution to that. However, many nuclear matter empirical parameters contribute in a similar way to the building of baryonic pressure.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast radio bursts (FRBs) remain one of the most puzzling astrophysical phenomena. While most FRBs are detected only once or sporadically, we present the identification of FRB 20190520B as the first persistently active source over a continuous span of ~ four years. This rare long-term activity enabled a detailed investigation of its dispersion measure (DM) evolution. We also report that FRB 20190520B exhibits a substantial decrease in DM at a global rate of minus 12.4 plus or minus 0.3 pc cm^-3 yr^-1, exceeding previous FRB DM variation measurements by a factor of three and surpassing those observed in pulsars by orders of magnitude. The magnitude and consistency of the DM evolution, along with a high host DM contribution, strongly indicate that the source resides in a dense, expanding ionized medium, likely a young supernova remnant (SNR).
#### Investigating Unusually Extended Main Sequence Turnoff of the Galactic Open Cluster NGC 3532

 - **Abstract**
 Extended main-sequence turnoffs are observed in the color-magnitude diagrams of some young and intermediate-age star clusters. Here we report the case study of NGC 3532. Among the cluster member candidates identified using the ML-MOC algorithm on Gaia DR3 sources, we found that fast rotators are significantly redder. Stars near the main-sequence turnoff exhibit a multi-modal distribution in the Gaia broadening velocity ($v_{\rm broad}$). A comparison with relevant literature suggests binaries being typically interspersed with fast rotators, often manifesting as slow to moderate rotators. Additionally, chemically peculiar stars are predominantly located in the bluer regions of the turnoff, with those in the fast-rotator region having large values of Gaia re-normalised unit weight error, indicating plausible companions. Our analysis suggests multiple channels responsible for angular momentum loss to account for the extended turnoff.
#### Search for UHE gamma photons in cosmic rays by studying the geomagnetic influence on air-shower muons

 - **Abstract**
 A major challenge in ground-based ultra-high-energy gamma-ray observations remains in discriminating sporadic gamma-ray signals from a huge background of cosmic-ray events. To achieve good discrimination power of gamma rays against protons, an unconventional approach is presented that exploits the geomagnetic influence on air shower muons in Monte Carlo shower events. A recognizable polar asymmetry in the positive and negative muon distributions is noticed after transforming the impact coordinates of each muon from the observer plane onto the shower front plane, plus a judicious ignoring of the minimal attenuation of muons in the space between the two planes. A couple of observables, $d_{\text{max}}$ and $N_{\mu; \text{IQS}}^{\text{tr.}}$, can be extracted from the formation of two densely populated positive and negative muon zones in each shower. Both observables demonstrate excellent gamma/proton discrimination power, with efficiencies of $93.2\%$ and $98.6\%$. This analysis permitted the usage of muon detectors just covering a small area of $\simeq{1.4}\%$ of a square-km array for ultra-high-energy gamma-ray observations. It is expected that the present and future gamma-ray observatories will implement the current approach.
#### Stellar feedback drives the baryon deficiency in low-mass galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar feedback, as a key process regulating the baryon cycle, is thought to greatly redistribute baryonic material inside and outside the dark matter halos (DMHs), however the observational evidences are lacking. Through stacking analyses of ~400,000 galaxy spectra from Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), we find star formation driven cool outflows in Mg II absorption line. Assuming only gravity acts on the launched gas, our calculations reveal that outflows from low mass galaxies (log M*<10) are capable of escaping beyond the DMHs, which aligns well with our finding in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) absorption along the minor-axes of galaxies using background quasars. This research offers indirect evidence that stellar feedback drives the low baryon retention rate in low-mass haloes, implicating that baryonic processes within galaxies are connected with the diffuse matter beyond the DMHs.

 - **Abstract**
 Galactic-scale outflows are a crucial component of galaxy evolution, yet their properties in the early universe remain poorly constrained. We present the first statistical investigation of cool gas outflows in galaxies spanning a wide cosmic timeline from $z \approx 1$ to $z \approx 10$. Using thousands of public JWST/NIRSpec spectra, we employ a signal-to-noise weighted spectral stacking technique on the \ion{Mg}{2} $\lambda\lambda2796, 2803$ absorption doublet. We robustly detect blueshifted \ion{Mg}{2} absorption in all stellar mass and redshift bins. The outflow equivalent width exhibits a strong, positive correlation with stellar mass ($M_*$) at all epochs, increasing from $\sim 1$~Å at $M_* \approx 10^9~\mathrm{M}_\odot$ to over $3$~Å at $M_* > 10^{10.5}~\mathrm{M}_\odot$. Our work provides the first statistical constraints on cool outflows in the low-mass ($M_* \lesssim 10^{9.5}~\mathrm{M}_\odot$), high-redshift ($z > 3$) regime, vital for constraining feedback in the numerous progenitors of typical present-day galaxies. Crucially, the scaling relation between outflow properties and stellar mass shows no significant evolution at $z > 3$. This suggests a persistent, unevolving feedback mechanism governing the baryon cycle in the early universe, placing strong constraints on models that invoke a fundamental change in feedback physics at Cosmic Dawn, such as the feedback-free starburst model.

 - **Abstract**
 The Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154 has exhibited prolific high-energy (HE) bursting activity in recent years. Investigating its potential tera-electronvolt counterpart could provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of magnetar emission and very high-energy (VHE) processes in extreme astrophysical environments. We aim to search for a possible tera-electronvolt counterpart to both its persistent and sub-second-scale burst emission. We analysed over 25 h of observations from the Large-Sized Telescope prototype (LST-1) of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) during periods of HE activity from SGR 1935+2154 in 2021 and 2022 to search for persistent emission. For bursting emission, we selected and analysed nine 0.1 s time windows centred around known short X-ray bursts, targeting potential sub-second-scale tera-electronvolt counterparts in a low-photon-statistics regime. While no persistent or bursting emission was detected in our search, we establish upper limits for the tera-electronvolt emission of a short magnetar burst simultaneous to its soft gamma-ray flux. Specifically, for the brightest burst in our sample, the ratio between tera-electronvolt and X-ray flux is less than $10^{-3}$. The non-detection of either persistent or bursting tera-electronvolt emission from SGR 1935+2154 suggests that if such components exist, they may occur under specific conditions not covered by our observations. This aligns with theoretical predictions of VHE components in magnetar-powered fast radio bursts and the detection of MeV - GeV emission in giant magnetar flares. These findings underscore the potential of magnetars, fast radio bursts, and other fast transients as promising candidates for future observations in the low-photon-statistics regime with Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes, particularly with the CTAO.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar flares and coronal mass ejections, originating from solar active regions (ARs), are the primary drivers of space weather and can disrupt technological systems. Forecasting efforts heavily rely on photospheric magnetic field data from the Space-weather HMI Active Region Patch (SHARPs) data products. However, the crucial energy release occurs higher in the solar corona. Radio observations from instruments like the RATAN-600 telescope directly probe this region, but their scientific use has been hindered by a lack of standardized and accessible data products. To address this gap, we have developed the Ratan Active Region Patches (RARPs) database, a new public resource of multi-frequency radio spectra for solar ARs. Generated using RATANSunPy software, RARPs provides the first standardized radio counterpart to magnetic field archives. The database contains over 160,000 calibrated AR observations from 2009 to 2025, each including 3-18 GHz spectra and rich metadata. We demonstrate the scientific utility of this database by using machine learning to forecast solar flares. The radio spectra are first compressed into low-dimensional embedded features using an autoencoder, which are then used as predictors in baseline logistic regression classifiers. We compare the predictive power of these embedded RARPs features with that of the 18 SHARPs magnetic field parameters provided in the SHARPs data product headers. Our results show that while SHARPs data provides superior flare discrimination, the radio signatures in RARPs possess clear predictive potential and, for M-class and above flares, yield lower Brier Scores and positive Brier Skill Scores relative to SHARPs, indicating more accurate probabilistic forecasts for these events. This establishes radio data as a valuable and complementary information source.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent intensive monitoring campaigns of active galactic nuclei (AGN) have provided simultaneous X-ray, UV, and optical data of unprecedented quality. The observations reveal a strong correlation between the UV and optical variability, but a weaker correlation between the X-ray and UV bands, challenging the standard X-ray reprocessing scenario. We revisit the X-ray/UV connection in NGC 5548 by fitting archival 2014 HST and Swift/XRT light curves assuming X-ray reverberation from a dynamically evolving X-ray corona. Our results show that, as long as the corona height, photon index and power vary over time, X-ray reverberation can explain the observed UV and optical variability within 2% and 5%, respectively (on average). The evolution of the best-fit parameters suggests that fast changes in coronal geometry and energetics on a time scale of days are required to explain the observed variability.

 - **Abstract**
 Polarization-mode observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) are powerful tools for studying the dust grain populations in circumstellar disks. Many sources exhibit polarization signatures consistent with aligned dust grains, yet the physical origin of this alignment remains uncertain. One such source is BHB07-11, a Class I protobinary object in the Pipe Nebula with complex spiral arm structures in its circumbinary disk. While magnetic fields are often invoked to explain grain alignment in the interstellar medium, the contrasting conditions in circumstellar disk environments demand further investigation into grain alignment mechanisms. To determine BHB07-11's dominant polarization mechanism, we leverage ALMA polarization-mode dust continuum observations in Bands 3 ($\lambda$=3.1 mm), 6 ($\lambda$=1.3 mm), and 7 ($\lambda$=0.87 mm), in combination with high-resolution dust continuum and spectral line observations in Band 6. Observed polarization vectors in each band are consistent with emission from aligned grains and follow the structure of the spiral arms as shown in the high-resolution observations. Given the relationship between the observed polarization vector orientation and the spiral arms, we find that the polarization morphology is most consistent with grains aligned through a relative velocity flow between gas and dust in the spiral arms, as envisioned in the recently developed badminton birdie-like alignment mechanism, rather than alignment with a magnetic field or other known alignment mechanisms.

 - **Abstract**
 Trajectories of test particles in a time-varying nonspherical gravitational potential model of our Galaxy are considered. The role of the quadrupole component of the potential, which at distances greater than 50 kpc is associated with the distribution of matter in the Galaxy's neighborhood (mainly with the influence of the galaxy M31), is studied. It is shown that perturbations of the potential created by the environment can significantly change the trajectories of particles at distances greater than 100 kpc from the Galactic center, but the magnitude of this effect depends on the still poorly known trajectory of the galaxy M31. For some variants of this trajectory, structures resembling a "thin plane" of satellite galaxies cannot exist for more than 2-3 billion years.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel graph-based machine learning classifier for identifying the dark matter cosmic web environments of galaxies. Large galaxy surveys offer comprehensive statistical views of how galaxy properties are shaped by large-scale structure, but this requires robust classifications of galaxies' cosmic web environments. Using stellar mass-selected IllustrisTNG-300 galaxies, we apply a three-stage, simulation-based framework to link galaxies to the total (mainly dark) underlying matter distribution. Here, we apply the following three steps: First, we assign the positions of simulated galaxies to a void, wall, filament, or cluster environment using the T-Web classification of the underlying matter distribution. Second, we construct a Delaunay triangulation of the galaxy distribution to summarise the local geometric structure with ten graph metrics for each galaxy. Third, we train a graph attention network (GAT) on each galaxy's graph metrics to predict its cosmic web environment. For galaxies with stellar mass $\mathrm{>10^9 M_{\odot}}$, our GAT+ model achieves an accuracy of $85\,\%$, outperforming graph-agnostic multilayer perceptrons and graph convolutional networks. Our results demonstrate that graph-based representations of galaxy positions provide a powerful and physically meaningful way to infer dark matter environments. We plan to apply this simulation-based graph modelling to investigate how the properties of observed galaxies from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey are influenced by their dark matter environments.

 - **Abstract**
 High-mass stars and star clusters form from the fragmentation of massive dense clumps driven by gravity, turbulence, and magnetic fields. The ALMAGAL project observed $\sim1000$ clumps at $\sim$1000\,au resolution, enabling a statistically significant characterization of this process across a large range of clump physical parameters and evolutionary stages. In this work, we investigated the spatial distribution of dense cores in the 514 massive, potentially cluster-forming, clumps hosting at least 4 cores, to trace fragmentation's initial conditions and early evolution. We used quantitative descriptors, evaluated against the clump bolometric luminosity-to-mass ratio as an indicator of evolution. Core separations were measured with the minimum spanning tree method (MST) and compared with the Jeans gravitational fragmentation theory. We used the $Q$ parameter and the mass segregation ratio, $\Lambda_{MSR}$, to evaluate whether cores have specific arrangements or differences depending on their masses. ALMAGAL cores are usually arranged in elliptical groups with an axis ratio $e\sim2.2$, but $e\geq$5 is also observed. A single characteristic core separation per clump is found in $\sim76$% of cases, but signatures of multiple fragmentation lengths not rare. Typical core separations are compatible with the clump-averaged thermal Jeans length, $\lambda^{th}_{J}$, though a population, typical of low-fragmented/young clumps, has wider separations with $l\approx3\times\lambda^{th}_{J}$. The core separation decreases on average from $l\sim22000$ au in younger systems to $l\sim7000$ au in more evolved ones. Cores are typically distributed in fractal-type subclusters, with centrally concentrated patterns appearing only at later stages, but without a progressive evolutionary transition. Finally, mass segregation is found in 110 systems, with its occurrence increasing with evolution.
