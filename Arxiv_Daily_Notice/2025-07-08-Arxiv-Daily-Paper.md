 - **Abstract**
 The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) offers a unique opportunity to revolutionize our understanding of planetary formation and evolution. The goal of this Science Case Development Document (SCDD) is to investigate the physical and chemical processes that shape the composition and atmospheric mass loss in exoplanets. We review the key observables currently known as diagnostics of mass loss via transit observations, i.e., absorption lines of escaping hydrogen (Lyman-alpha), helium, and metals (Fe, Mg, C, O). We also explore the challenges to infer planetary formation processes based on atmospheric composition characterization. HWO could enable a broad, continuous coverage from far-ultraviolet to near-infrared spectroscopy (~100--1600 nm) at high resolution (R > 60, 000), which is essential to make these measurements, disentangle their planetary origin from stellar activity, and ultimately, contextualize the escape rates by simultaneously characterizing the composition, cloud predominance, and thermal structure of exoplanet atmospheres.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent studies have reported a non evolution of galaxy ages at redshifts higher than $z\sim$ 2.5, as well as galaxies older than the Universe. In this work, a sample of galaxies from JWST and HST was analysed via photometry to further understand this astronomical phenomenon. No prior cosmological parameters were assumed in the analysis, but the spectroscopic redshift. When compared to stellar population synthesis models, the results for mass-weighted galaxy ages indicate that the analysed objects seem to be divided into two subsets. The results for the subset with the majority of objects (60\% assuming a flat-$\Lambda$CDM cosmology) indicate an evolution of galaxy ages within the redshift range $z$=0.1-7.0, in the sense that higher redshift galaxies are younger than the Universe. Sources of systematic errors were discussed drawing into conclusion that degeneracies between reddening-age-metallicity, and/or AGN emission may explain the rest 40\% of the galaxies with ages older than expected from a flat-$\Lambda$CDM cosmology.

 GRB 221009A is the brightest gamma-ray burst (GRB) observed to date. Extensive observations of its afterglow emission across the electromagnetic spectrum were performed, providing the first strong evidence of a jet with a nontrivial angular structure in a long GRB. We carried out an extensive observation campaign in very-high-energy (VHE) gamma rays with the first Large-Sized Telescope (LST-1) of the future Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), starting on 2022 October 10, about one day after the burst. A dedicated analysis of the GRB 221009A data is performed to account for the different moonlight conditions under which data were recorded. We find an excess of gamma-like events with a statistical significance of 4.1$\sigma$ during the observations taken 1.33 days after the burst, followed by background-compatible results for the later days. The results are compared with various models of afterglows from structured jets that are consistent with the published multiwavelength data, but entail significant quantitative and qualitative differences in the VHE emission after one day. We disfavor models that imply VHE flux at one day considerably above $10^{-11}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. Our late-time VHE observations can help disentangle the degeneracy among the models and provide valuable new insight into the structure of GRB jets.
#### The properties of X-ray selected AGN in protoclusters pinpointed by Enormous Lya Nebulae

 - **Abstract**
 Protoclusters of galaxies are overdense regions of the Universe characterized by large gas reservoirs. Such environments make them perfect laboratories to investigate galaxy-AGN co-evolution and the growth of SMBHs. Galaxies living in such a dense regions are expected to growth efficiently their SMBH, resulting in a higher incidence of AGN than in the field. Some protoclusters exhibit extended Ly$\alpha$ nebulae in their central region, pinpointing the presence of massive gas reservoirs, but whose main powering mechanism is still debated. We aim to investigate the AGN population, and AGN enhancement, in three protoclusters at 2.3 < z < 3.2 which host enormous Ly$\alpha$ nebulae (ELANe). Additionally, we search for the presence of X-ray diffuse emission in the same region of the Ly$\alpha$ nebulae to reveal multi-phase gas in these protoclusters. We use deep (190-270 ks) Chandra observations to identify AGN among the protocluster members and perform X-ray spectral analysis to derive the properties of those sources. We compare the AGN fraction and space density with those observed in other known protoclusters and from the field environment. We find 11 X-ray detected AGN in the three protoclusters. Each structure hosts a central, X-ray powerful (log$(L_{\rm X}/{\rm erg \, s^{-1}}) \sim 45-46$), QSO, while the other X-ray sources are mostly moderately luminous (log$(L_{\rm X}/{\rm erg \, s^{-1}}) \sim 44$) and obscured Compton-Thin AGN. The fraction of AGN in our targets is comparable with estimates for other protoclusters, and significantly higher than what is found for low-redshift clusters. We also find a significant enhancement (2-4 dex) of AGN density with respect to the field and to non active galaxies in the protoclusters. Finally, we find no significant soft X-ray diffuse emissions from the nebulae, thus ruling out gravitational heating as the main powering mechanism of the ELANe.
#### ASASSN-24fw: An 8-month long, 4.1 mag, optically achromatic and polarized dimming event

 - **Abstract**
 We discuss ASASSN-24fw, a 13th-magnitude star that optically faded by $\Delta g = 4.12 \pm 0.02$ mag starting in September 2024 after over a decade of quiescence in ASAS-SN. The dimmimg lasted $\sim$8 months before returning to quiescence in late May 2025. The spectral energy distribution (SED) before the event is that of a pre-main sequence or a modestly evolved F star with some warm dust emission. The shape of the optical SED during the dim phase is unchanged and the optical and near-infrared spectra are those of an F star. The SED and the dilution of some of the F star infrared absorption features near minimum suggest the presence of a $\sim$0.25$M_\odot$ M dwarf binary companion. The 43.8 year period proposed by Nair & Denisenko (2024) appears correct and is probably half the precession period of a circumbinary disk. The optical eclipse is nearly achromatic, although slightly deeper in bluer filters, $\Delta (g-z)=0.31\pm0.15$ mag, and the $V$ band emission is polarized by up to 4%. The materials most able to produce such small optical color changes and a high polarization are big ($\sim$20 $\mu$m) carbonaceous or water ice grains. Particle distributions dominated by big grains are seen in protoplanetary disks, Saturn-like ring systems and evolved debris disks. We also carry out a survey of occultation events, finding 42 additional systems, of which only 7 (4) closely match $\varepsilon$ Aurigae (KH 15D), the two archetypes of stars with long and deep eclipses. The full sample is widely distributed in an optical color-magnitude diagram, but roughly half show a mid-IR excess. It is likely many of the others have cooler dust since it seems essential to produce the events.

 - **Abstract**
 We present new methods to quantify the AGN population in terms of a multi-dimensional luminosity function that describes the space density of sources as a function of both X-ray and radio luminosity. We compile a sample of 1891 radio and X-ray detected extragalactic sources from the Boötes and COSMOS fields. First, we investigate the X-ray--radio luminosity correlation in the sample and find that an apparent correlation is introduced due to the sensitivity limits of the surveys; when considering individual redshift bins we find a wide range of radio luminosities associated with a given X-ray luminosity, and vice versa, indicating little direct connection between the emission processes. We then measure the X-ray luminosity function, radio luminosity function and multi-dimensional X-ray--radio luminosity function across redshift ($0<z<6$). We apply luminosity thresholds in X-ray and radio to restrict our sample to those in the AGN-dominated regime and explore how the fraction of radio-selected AGN within the overall X-ray sample varies with increasing X-ray luminosity (and vice versa). We find that towards the highest X-ray and radio luminosities the fraction of sources with both an X-ray and radio detection increases towards 100%, indicating that at the highest luminosities we are more likely to obtain a detection in both bands, though the source will not necessarily be bright in both bands. Thus, the most luminous accretion events are more likely to be associated with the production of a jet, despite the distinct physical structures that produce the emission and likely persist over very different timescales.
#### JWST's PEARLS: Temperatures of Nine Highly Magnified Stars in a Galaxy at Redshift z = 0.94 and Simulated Stellar Population Dependence on Stellar Metallicity and the Initial Mass Function

 - **Abstract**
 We present stellar atmosphere modeling of JWST NIRCam photometry of nine highly magnified individual stars in a single galaxy at redshift z=0.94 known as the Warhol arc, which is strongly lensed by the galaxy cluster MACSJ0416. Seven of these transients were identified by Yan et al. (2023). The nine sources are all likely red supergiants with temperatures of T~4000K. We present new longslit spectroscopy of the Warhol arc acquired with Keck-I and the Large Binocular Telescope, and use these data to constrain the arc's oxygen abundance to be 12+log(O/H)=8.45+-0.08. We perform a microlensing simulation on synthetic stellar populations using a range of stellar metallicities and initial mass function slopes. The temperature distribution of the simulated detectable stars is sensitive to the choice of stellar metallicity, and setting the stellar metallicity equal to the arc's nebular metallicity (log(Z*/Zsun)=-0.24) produces a simulated temperature distribution that is consistent with the observations, while lower stellar metallicities (log(Z*/Zsun)<-0.75) produce simulated temperatures that are inconsistent with the observations. The expected detection rate is strongly anticorrelated with the IMF slope for {\alpha}>1.2. For the canonical IMF slope alpha=2.35, the simulation yields expected transient detection rates that agree with the observed detection rates in the HST Flashlights filters, but over predicts the detection rate by a factor of ~3-12 (<2sigma tension) in the JWST filters. The simulated detection rate is sensitive to the choice of stellar metallicity, with lower metallicities (log(Z*/Zsun)<-0.75) yielding a significantly lower simulated detection rate that further reduces the modest tension with the observations.
#### JWST's PEARLS: A Candidate Massive Binary Star System in a Lensed Galaxy at Redshift 0.94

 - **Abstract**
 Massive stars at cosmological distances can be individually detected during transient microlensing events, when gravitational lensing magnifications may exceed mu ~ 1000. Nine such sources were identified in JWST NIRCam imaging of a single galaxy at redshift z = 0.94 known as the "Warhol arc,'' which is mirror-imaged by the galaxy cluster MACS J0416.1-2403. Here we present the discovery of two coincident and well-characterized microlensing events at the same location followed by a third event observed in a single filter approximately 18 months later. The events can be explained by microlensing of a binary star system consisting of a red supergiant (T ~ 4000 K) and a B-type (T > 13,000 K) companion star. The timescale of the coincident microlensing events constrains the projected source-plane size to R < 270 AU. The most likely binary configurations consistent with the observational constraints on the temperatures and luminosities of each star are stars with initial masses M1 = 22.5+7.1-5.5 Msun and an initial mass ratio very close to unity. A kinematic model that reproduces the observed light curve in all filters gives a relatively small transverse velocity of ~50 km/s. This requires the dominant velocity component of several hundreds of km/s to be roughly parallel to the microcaustic. An alternative possibility would be that the three microlensing events correspond to unrelated stars crossing distinct microcaustics, but this would imply a highly elevated rate of events at their common position, even though no underlying knot is present at the location.
#### Radio Morphology of Gamma-ray Sources -- II. Giant Radio Galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 Giant radio sources, including galaxies and quasars (hereafter GRGs), are active galactic nuclei (AGN) hosting relativistic jets with source sizes exceeding the projected length of 0.7 Mpc. They are crucial to understanding the evolution of radio sources and their interaction with the surrounding environment. Some of these enigmatic objects, e.g., NGC 315, have also been reported as gamma-ray emitters. Since GRGs are thought to be aligned close to the plane of the sky, they are invaluable targets to explore the radiative mechanisms responsible for the observed gamma-ray emission. We have carried out a systematic search of gamma-ray emitting GRGs using sensitive low-resolution radio surveys, such as by Low Frequency Array, NRAO VLA Sky Survey, and Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey, and considering the fourth data release of the fourth Fermi-Large Area Telescope gamma-ray source (4FGL-DR4) catalog. By carefully inspecting the radio maps of all AGN included in the 4FGL-DR4 catalog, we have identified 16 gamma-ray emitting GRGs, including 8 of them being reported as GRGs for the first time. Some of their observed parameters, e.g., core dominance, appeared to differ from that found for the non-gamma-ray detected GRG population, possibly due to the relatively small viewing angle of the gamma-ray emitting jet. The observed gamma-ray properties of these objects were found to be similar to non-GRG gamma-ray emitting misaligned AGN. We conclude that the origin of the gamma-ray emission could be similar in both source populations.

 - **Abstract**
 We derive one dimensional (1D) analytical solutions for the transport equations of incompressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence developed by Zank et al. [2012], Adhikari et al. [2023], including the Elsässer energies and the correlation lengths. The solutions are suitable for an arbitrary given background convection speed and Alfvén speed profiles but require near equipartition of turbulent kinetic energy and magnetic field energy. These analytical solutions provide a simple tool to investigate the evolution of turbulence and resulting energetic particle diffusion coefficients in various space and astrophysical environments that possess simple geometry.

 - **Abstract**
 Follow-up studies of persistent emission from Fast Radio Burst (FRB) sources are critical for understanding their elusive emission mechanisms and the nature of their progenitors. This work presents new observations of the persistent radio source (PRS) associated with \ourfrb. We observe a gradual decay in the PRS brightness, which is punctuated by periods of brightening and dimming at both 1.5 GHz and 3 GHz. Furthermore, our low-frequency ($<1$ GHz) observations-the first for this source-reveal evidence of a spectral break which can be attributed to absorption processes. Interpreted within the framework of the magnetar wind nebula model, our data constrain the age of the magnetar progenitor to $53^{+17}_{-10}$ years, broadly consistent with previous work. Assuming the observed 1.5 GHz variability is driven by scintillation, we derive a conservative lower limit for the source's radius of $>0.52$ pc, for a screen at 10 kpc. The observations presented here challenge the predictions of the previously published best-fit hypernebula model for this source.
#### Earliest Galaxy Evolution in the CANUCS+Technicolor fields: Galaxy Properties at $z\sim10-16$ seen with the Full NIRCam Medium and Broad Band Filters

 - **Abstract**
 We present a sample of $z_{\rm phot}\sim10-16$ galaxies by exploiting one of the richest JWST NIRCam imaging data, taken in the CANUCS survey in Cycle 1 and the Technicolor (TEC) survey in Cycle 2. The combination of the CANUCS+TEC provides multi-epoch, deep NIRCam images in all medium bands (MBs) and broad bands (BBs) onboard NIRCam (22 filters in total), over $\sim23\ {\rm arcmin}^2$ in three independent lines of sight. We select high-$z$ galaxy candidates based on photometric redshifts, and obtain eight candidates at $z\sim10-16$, including a very robust candidate at $z\sim15.4$. The ultraviolet (UV) luminosity function (LF) from our sample is consistent with previous JWST studies showing a scatter of $\sim0.6$ dex across the literature, marking the significance of the field-to-field variance in interpreting galaxy abundance measurements at $z>10$. We find that the UV LF moderately evolves at $z>10$, and the LF normalization and the luminosity density decline by a factor of $\sim7$ from $z\sim11$ to $z\sim15$, indicating less steep evolution than $z<11$. We highlight the importance of MB filters, not only to minimize the contamination by low-$z$ interlopers but also to maximize the completeness. In particular, faint and less blue galaxies could be missed when the sample is built solely on BB data. The contamination and incompleteness of BB-only selected samples can bias our views of earliest galaxy evolution at $z>10$, including the UV LF by $\sim0.6$ dex, the size-magnitude relation by $\sim0.6$ dex, and the UV slope-magnitude relation by $\Delta\beta_{\rm UV}\sim-0.3$.

 - **Abstract**
 Jellyfish galaxies provide direct evidence of ram pressure stripping in cluster environments. We investigate the role of magnetic fields in the formation of jellyfish galaxies with a multiphase interstellar medium (ISM) using radiation magneto-hydrodynamic simulations. We impose magnetized (MHD) and non-magnetized (HD) winds on the gas-rich dwarf galaxies containing the magnetized or non-magnetized ISM. The MHD winds strip the disk gas more effectively than the HD winds because of the magnetic force acting against the local density gradient, which results in remarkably different ram pressure stripped features. The magnetic fields induced by the MHD winds generate a strong magnetic pressure, which forms smoothed disks and tail gas features. Since the stripped ISM in MHD wind cases travels while being nearly isolated from the intracluster medium (ICM), the stripped ISM mostly forms stars within 20~kpc of the galactic disks. In contrast, non-magnetized winds facilitate the efficient mixing of the stripped ISM with the ICM, resulting in the formation of abundant warm clouds that cool and collapse in the distant ($\sim50-100\,$kpc) tails at times of a few hundred Myr. Consequently, distant tail star formation occurs only in the HD wind runs. Finally, despite the different tail features, the star formation rates in the disk remain similar owing to the interplay between the increased gas stripping and the gas density increase in the disks of the MHD wind runs. These results suggest that the magnetized ICM may have a significant influence on jellyfish galaxies, whereas the magnetized ISM play a minor role.
#### Identifying the contributors to cosmic reionization with the Habitable World Observatory: LyC escape calibration in faint galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 Investigating how small-scale physical processes shape large-scale astrophysical phenomena is one of the key science themes of the Astro2020 decadal Survey. An example of this interplay is Cosmic Reionization, where ionizing photons from galaxies escaped into the intergalactic medium (IGM), driving its transition from neutral to ionized at $z>6$. Star-forming galaxies are thought to be the dominant sources of reionization. However, an open question remains as to whether bright or faint star-forming galaxies are the primary reionization contributors. This depends on the escape fraction $f_{~esc}^{LyC}$ -- the fraction of ionizing photons that successfully escape the galaxy's interstellar and circumgalactic medium to reach the IGM. Performing direct measurements of $f_{~esc}^{LyC}$ during the reionization epoch is not feasible, due to the near-zero transmission of the IGM at $z\gtrsim4$. However, by calibrating $f_{~esc}^{LyC}$ against indirect indicators (i.e. galaxy properties that correlate with $f_{~esc}^{LyC}$) at lower $z$, we can estimate its value in galaxies during reionization. Currently, $f_{~esc}^{LyC}$ calibrations are mostly limited to $\sim 90$ sources brighter $M_{UV} \sim -18$ at $z\sim0.3$. Yet, recent models suggest that fainter galaxies ($-19<M_{UV}<-13$) may be the major contributors to reionization. Our science goal is to extend $f_{~esc}^{LyC}$ calibrations to such faint magnitudes. With the Habitable Worlds Observatory, we aim to achieve a $\sim$ 20-fold increase in statistical power. Additionally, we plan to reach magnitudes as faint as 1/100 $L^*$ at $z\sim0.1$. Suitable targets will be selected from the upcoming Ultraviolet Explorer (UVEX) survey. Through this science case, we will be able to place robust constraints on the role of faint galaxies in the reionization of the Universe and identify its primary contributors.

 - **Abstract**
 We use intergalactic medium (IGM) metallicity distributions from several state-of-the-art cosmological simulations of Milky Way analogs and a semi-analytic model of ultra-faint dwarf galaxy (UFD) formation to model the stellar metallicities of UFDs in MW-like environments. We study simulations with different treatments of star formation, stellar feedback, and Population III enrichment, and in all cases, we find that only a few percent of the IGM accretable by UFD progenitors is enriched to metallicities $\rm [Fe/H]\ge-4$. When the metallicity of accreted IGM in the semi-analytic galaxy formation model is set using these IGM metallicity distributions, the model underpredicts UFD metallicities and their scatter compared to the observed luminosity--metallicity relation. Our results indicate that IGM enrichment is not the dominant mechanism setting metallicities of UFD stars. Instead, UFD stellar metallicity is determined primarily by the interplay between internal enrichment and metal loss through feedback-driven outflows. We examine models with different values of the maximum outflow mass loading factor $\eta_{\rm max}$ and show that the full range of average stellar metallicities of UFDs at $M_V<-7$ can be reproduced if the maximum mass loading factor varies in the range $200\lesssim\eta_{\rm max}\lesssim 2000$. We also consider stellar metallicity distribution functions (MDFs) within individual model galaxies with different assumptions about IGM enrichment and $\eta_{\rm max}$. We find that all considered models are in reasonable agreement with observed UFD MDFs, with model differences less than the uncertainties of current metallicity measurements.

 - **Abstract**
 Multiphase filamentary nebulae are ubiquitous in the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) of cool-core clusters, providing key insights into the cycle of baryons and the feeding and feedback of supermassive black holes. However, BCGs account for less than 1% of all early-type galaxies (ETGs). To broaden our understanding of how multiphase filamentary nebulae form in ETGs and connect to the greater picture of galaxy evolution, it is crucial to explore ETGs that are outside of the dense centers of galaxy clusters or groups. We present VLT-MUSE IFU observations of 126 nearby non-central ETGs, detecting warm ionized gas in 54 of them. 35 out of 54 display rotating disks that are morphologically and kinematically aligned with their stellar components, suggesting stellar mass loss as the origin of their warm gas. The remaining 19 host filamentary nebulae that are decoupled from the stellar components, resembling those observed in BCGs. These filamentary sources display unique emission line properties that cannot be fully explained by photoionization from post-asymptotic giant branch stars, active galactic nuclei, or fast gas shocks. For the eight filamentary sources that have been observed with Chandra, their soft X-ray emission indicates the presence of hot gas. We posit that their emission lines may be powered by EUV and X-ray radiation from the cooling of the hot gas, similar to cool-core clusters, but the detailed mechanisms and physical conditions may be different. As a detailed study case, we investigate NGC 4374, a non-central ETG with extensive Chandra observations, and find that its warm filaments are over pressured compared to the hot filaments - opposite with what is observed in cool-core clusters.

 We analyze imaging from Data Preview 1 of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory to explore the performance of early LSST pipelines in the 47 Tucanae field. The coadd-\texttt{object} catalog demonstrates the depth and precision possible with Rubin, recovering well-defined color magnitude diagrams for 47 Tuc Small Magellanic Cloud. Unfortunately, the existing pipelines fail to recover sources within $\sim$28 pc of the cluster center, due to the extreme source density. Using Rubin's forced photometry on stars identified via Difference Imaging, we can recover sources down to $\sim$14 pc from the cluster center, and find 14744 potential cluster members with this extended dataset. While this forced photometry has significant systematics, our analysis showcases the potential for detailed structural studies of crowded fields with the Rubin Observatory.
#### Little Red Dots from Ultra-Strongly Self-Interacting Dark Matter

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the possibility that the recently identified population of high-redshift, obscured quasars - known as "Little Red Dots" (LRDs) - originates from early black hole seed formation driven by ultra-strongly self-interacting dark matter (uSIDM). In this framework, dark matter halos undergo gravothermal core collapse due to large self-interaction cross sections, resulting in the rapid formation of massive black hole (BH) seeds with masses $\gtrsim 10^{5} M_\odot$ at redshifts $z \gtrsim 5$. We develop a semi-analytic model that tracks the evolution of the dark matter halo population, the redshift of collapse $z_{\rm coll}$, and the corresponding BH mass function. Black hole growth is modeled stochastically via a log-normal Eddington ratio distribution and a finite duty cycle. We find that the uSIDM scenario naturally reproduces key observed properties of LRDs, including their abundance, compactness, and characteristic BH masses, while offering a mechanism for early, obscured black hole formation that is difficult to achieve in standard CDM-based models. The predicted SMBH mass function at $z \sim 5$ shows excellent agreement with LRD observational data and SIDM merger-tree simulations, particularly at the high-mass end $(m_{\rm BH} \gtrsim 10^{7} M_\odot)$. These results suggest that LRDs may serve as powerful observational tracers of exotic dark sector physics and that SMBH formation in the early universe could be significantly shaped by non-gravitational dark matter interactions.

 - **Abstract**
 We present optical and near-infrared (NIR) observations of the outbursting, Halley-type comet 12P/Pons-Brooks. Three NIR spectra were obtained during two outbursts in October and November 2023, with the 3-meter Infrared Telescope Facility and the Palomar 200-inch Telescope, respectively. The NIR spectra exhibited absorption features at 1.5 and 2.0 $\mu$m, consistent with the diagnostic absorption bands of water ice, superimposed on a red dust-scattering continuum. We find that the absorption bands and the red continuum can be well explained by micrometer-sized crystalline ice at 140--170 K, along with sub-micrometer-sized refractory grains (e.g., amorphous carbon). In addition, an optical spectrum was obtained with the Lijiang 2.4-meter Telescope during the November 2023 outburst, which exhibited the emission bands of gaseous CN, C$_3$, C$_2$ and NH$_2$. The C$_3$/CN and C$_2$/CN ratios suggest that 12P/Pons-Brooks was ''typical'' in C$_3$ abundance but somewhat depleted in C$_2$. The specific kinetic energy of the 2023 November outburst is estimated to be $\sim8\times10^3$ J kg$^{-1}$, suggesting a likely triggering mechanism similar to 332P/Ikeya--Murakami and 17P/Holmes, i.e., the crystallization of amorphous water ice. A refractory-to-ice ratio of $\sim$1.7--3.2 is derived from the total mass loss of dust and gas, aligning with the lower-end estimates for 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and 1P/Halley. This suggests either a less evolved nucleus or an outburst region enriched in icy materials relative to the bulk nucleus.

 - **Abstract**
 Despite decades of research, the fundamental processes involved in the initiation and acceleration of solar eruptions remain not fully understood, making them long-standing and challenging problems in solar physics. Recent high-resolution observations by the Goode Solar Telescope have revealed small-scale magnetic flux emergence in localized regions of solar active areas prior to eruptions. Although much smaller in size than the entire active region, these emerging fluxes reached strengths of up to 2000 G. To investigate their impact, we performed data-constrained magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. We find that while the small-scale emerging flux does not significantly alter the pre-eruption evolution, it dramatically accelerates the eruption during the main phase by enhancing the growth of torus instability, which emerges in the nonlinear stage. This enhancement occurs independently of the decay index profile. Our analysis indicates that even subtle differences in the pre-eruption evolution can strongly influence the subsequent dynamics, suggesting that small-scale emerging flux can play a critical role in accelerating solar eruptions.
#### The physical mechanism of radio-quiet turn-on changing-look active galactic nuclei

 - **Abstract**
 It is suggested that the variation of mass accretion rate in accretion disk may be responsible for the occurrence of most changing-look active galactic nuclei (CL AGNs). However, the viscous timescale of a thin disk is far longer than the observed timescale of CL AGNs. Though this problem can be resolved by introducing the large-scale magnetic field, the mechanism for radio-quiet CL AGNs with weak/absent large-scale magnetic field remains a mystery. In this work, we assume that the thin accretion disk is collapsed from the inner advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) instead of substituting by the outer thin disk through advection. This idea is tested by comparing the cooling timescale ($t_{\rm cool}$) of an ADAF with the observed timescale ($t_{\rm tran}$) of turn-on CL AGNs. We compile a sample of 102 turn-on CL AGNs from the archived data and calculate the cooling timescale of an ADAF with the critical mass accretion rate based on some conventional assumptions. It is found that $t_{\rm cool}$ is much shorter than $t_{\rm tran}$ in most of the CL AGNs, which validates our assumption though $t_{\rm cool}$ is not consistent with $t_{\rm tran}$ ($t_{\rm cool}<t_{\rm tran}$). However, this is reasonable since most of the CL AGNs were observed only two times, indicating that the observed timescale $t_{\rm tran}$ is the maximum value because the changing-look can indeed happen before the second observation.

 - **Abstract**
 Spotless days (SLDs) as well as CMEs in the decay phase of the solar cycle are believed to be a good predictor of the forthcoming cycle. A sequential increase in SLDs is observed since cycle 21, and cycle 24 has the highest number of SLDs (since cycle 14), which offers a unique opportunity to probe the CME characteristics that occurred during SLDs (hereafter CME_SLD), in a statistical sense. Here, we investigate the CME_SLD during the descending phases of solar cycles 23 (2004-2008) and 24 (2015-2019). The fraction of CMEs that occurred on SLDs is found to be 14 and 11%, for cycles 23 and 24, respectively, compared to the total CMEs that occurred in the aforementioned durations. CME_SLD that occurred on the visible side of the solar disk are found to be slower, smaller in width, and carrying low Kinetic energy and mass compared to the entire population of CMEs. The distribution of annual evolution of speed, angular width and acceleration of the CMESLD with the CMEs that occurred on the non-SLD days (hereafter CME_Non-SLD) for the descending phases shows that the CME_SLD are different from the CME_non-SLD in terms of characteristics (such as speed, width and acceleration). A comparative analysis of CME_SLD kinematics of cycle 23 and 24 shows that the weakest cycle 24 has wider and more massive events. In contrast, other parameters of CME_SLD such as speed, acceleration and Kinetic energy do not have a disparate nature. CME_SLD in both SC23 and SC24 are statistically similar. Therefore, this investigation suggests that SLDs, and hence the sunspot number, may not be a sufficient candidate to predict the solar eruptive activities (e.g. CMEs). On the other hand, our analysis of the relation between the strength of the geomagnetic storm and probable candidate parameters revealed Dst index to be very well correlated with the product of V and Bz.

 - **Abstract**
 We present new JWST/NIRCam observations of the starburst irregular galaxy NGC 4449, obtained in Cycle 1 as part of the Feedback in Emerging extrAgalactic Star clusTers (FEAST) program, which we use to investigate its resolved stellar populations and their spatial distributions. NGC4449 NIR color-magnitude diagrams reveal a broad range of stellar populations, spanning different evolutionary phases, from young main sequence stars, to old red giant branch stars and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. The analysis of their spatial distributions shows that younger (< 10 Myr) populations form an S-shaped distribution aligned with the galaxy's north-south axis, while stars aged 10 - 60 Myr show shifting concentrations from the north to the south, consistent with the possibility that external interactions or tidal effects may have triggered star formation in spatially distinct bursts. Clusters of comparable ages generally follow these distributions, suggesting that cluster and field stars form at the same pace in each galaxy region. Thanks to the unprecedented high-spatial resolution and sensitivity of the JWST data we recover a clear gap between Oxygen-rich and the carbon star branch of the AGB population and the presence of a massive AGB star "finger". The analysis of these stars can provide constraints on AGB evolution models and dust production in this galaxy. These results confirms NGC 4449 status as a compelling example of a local dwarf starburst galaxy undergoing complex and possibly external driven star formation and underscore the power of JWST in probing the full lifecycle of stars in nearby starburst systems.

 - **Abstract**
 UV auroral emissions from giant planets are produced by extra-atmospheric energetic particles interacting with an atmosphere. They have been observed on Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus and should be present on Neptune. Even if the mechanisms are similar, each planet is unique due to its specific source of magnetospheric plasma and the structure and dynamics of its magnetosphere. How these precipitations modify atmospheric heating, dynamics and chemical balance at local and global atmospheric scale is still poorly known, especially on Uranus and Neptune, and critical to understanding the global atmosphere-magnetosphere system of giant planets and exoplanets. In this manucript we present how future observations by instruments, aboard \textit{the Habitable World Observatory} (HWO) will provide new information to better understand the origin and the atmospheric effects of these precipitations. A major interest is for the distant magnetospheres of Uranus and Neptune, never explored by an orbital spacecraft whose UV auroral emissions remains at (Uranus) or below (Neptune) the HST sensitivity. \textit{Pollux} is one such UV instrument concept, which will enable unprecedented high spectral resolution at fine spatial scale not previously seen and polarimetric observations of the planetary aurorae while \textit{LUMOS}, another UV instrument will image the full auroral regions with a good spectral resolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Thermochemical convection in Earth's outer core is driven by the crystallisation of the inner core that releases latent heat and light elements. A key question in core dynamics is whether a stable layer exists just below the core-mantle boundary. Recent core convection simulations, accounting for CMB heterogeneities, propose locally stable regions (or regional inversion lenses, RILs) rather than a global layer, allowing both stable and unstable regions to coexist. In this study, we consider a suite of numerical simulations of thermal, chemical, and thermochemical convection models focussed on Ekman number ($E=10^{-5}$) with thermal and chemical flux Rayleigh numbers $\widetilde{Ra}_T=30-4000$ and $\widetilde{Ra}_C=30-100000$, and thermal and chemical Prandtl numbers $Pr_T=1$ and $Pr_\xi=10$. Analysis of purely chemical models reveals light element accumulation (LEA) below the CMB, resulting in either locally stable regions near the poles or global layers, depending on the strength of chemical forcing. These chemically stratified regions persist in our thermochemical models even if the thermal field is fully destabilising. The addition of a heterogeneous CMB heat flux leads to the formation of RILs driven by thermal stratification. Stable regions in these thermochemical models have varying locations, properties, and morphologies depending on whether thermal or chemical convection dominates. In the investigated parameter range, these RILs are O(100 km) thick, and their strength and thickness generally increase with the strength of thermal driving; they are comparatively less sensitive to the strength of chemical driving. Our simulations reveal a diverse range of possible stable regions and/or a global layer at the top of Earth's core, with a seismically plausible range of thickness and strength, which may also have a signature in geomagnetic observations.

 - **Abstract**
 In the late stage of their evolution, low- to intermediate-mass stars pass through the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase, characterised by strong mass loss through dust driven winds. High angular resolution observations reveal that these winds harbour strong deviations from spherical symmetry, such as spirals and arcs, believed to be caused by hidden (sub-)stellar companions. Much more often, one observes spectral lines, where the presence of a companion is less clear. We study the impact of a binary companion on low-J CO spectral lines of AGB star outflows. By varying the orbital separation and wind velocity, we aim to find line shapes characteristic of more complex binary-induced morphologies. We generated a grid of nine 3D models of a mass-losing AGB star using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics code Phantom, with three values for both the outflow velocity and orbital separation. Utilising the radiative transfer code Magritte, we created synthetic spectral lines for the low rotational transitions of CO at different inclinations and position angles. Our simulations show a variety of morphologies, always with a pronounced spiral structure arising in the orbital plane, but with varying shapes in the meridional plane, and different degrees of global flattening. We find that the CO line profiles can deviate strongly from the parabolic or flat-topped profiles expected from spherically symmetric outflows. A variety of line shapes emerge, with two peaks near the terminal velocity, and a central bump near the central velocity being the most pronounced. In specific cases, the spectral lines can appear parabolic, hiding the presence of a binary companion. We find the CO spectral lines can serve as a binary diagnostic. The influence of the companion on the line can however also go easily unnoticed, as the features can be concealed by the beam profile and the noise of the observations.

 - **Abstract**
 The processes governing the production of astrophysical high-energy neutrinos are still debated, and the sources originating them remain an open question. Among the putative emitters, active galactic nuclei have gained increasing attention. Blazars, in particular, stand out due to their ability to accelerate particles in environments with external radiation fields. Recent observations suggest they may contribute to the neutrino flux detected by IceCube. We study the physical properties of a subsample of 52 blazars proposed as candidate neutrino emitters, based on a positional cross-correlation analysis between IceCube hotspots and the 5BZCat catalog. We aim to provide a first characterization of their central engines and physical nature, to explore the potential link with neutrino production. We analyze the optical spectroscopic properties of the 52 candidate neutrino-emitter blazars to infer their accretion regime. The study is complemented by radio and $\gamma$-ray data, which trace the intrinsic jet power. We compare the sample to other blazar populations in the literature, perform statistical tests, and explore, through simulations, the applicability of methods that include censored data. Overall, the target sample shows properties compatible with the reference samples. We observe a mild tendency to prefer objects with intense radiation fields, typical of radiatively efficient accretors, and high radio power. Among them, 24 are detected by Fermi-LAT, spanning various $\gamma$-ray luminosities. We also show that statistical tests commonly used in the literature need to be handled with caution, as they are sensitive to the number of censored data and the sample size.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding how the dynamical state of the interstellar medium (ISM) changes across spatial scales can provide important insights into how the gas is organized and ultimately collapses to form stars. To this end, we present ALMA $^{12}\mathrm{CO}(2-1)$ observations at $7$ pc ($0.4''$) spatial resolution across a $1.4~\mathrm{kpc}\times5.6~\mathrm{kpc}$ ($1'.3\times1'.3$) region located in the disk of the nearby ($D = 3.5$ Mpc), massive, star-forming galaxy NGC 253. We decompose this emission with a hierarchical, multiscale dendrogram algorithm to identify 2463 structures with deconvolved sizes ranging from $\sim3$ to $300$ pc, complete to a limiting mass of $10^4~\mathrm{M_\odot}$. By comparing the virial parameter of these structures against physical properties including size, mass, surface density, velocity dispersion, and hierarchical position, we carry out a comprehensive search for a preferred scale at which gravitationally bound structures emerge. Ultimately, we do not identify any emergent scale for bound objects in our data, nor do we find a correlation between the virial parameter and structure sizes. These findings suggest that gravitational binding cannot be used to define molecular clouds and emphasize the need for multiscale approaches to characterize the ISM.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a science case for the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) to map the circumgalactic medium (CGM) in emission by targeting ultraviolet emission lines, which trace the 10^4 - 10^6 K gas engaged in the feedback and accretion mechanisms driving galaxy evolution. While the CGM-galaxy connection is clearly evident through absorption line experiments and limited work done in optical and radio emission from the ground, the nature of this connection is poorly understood with regard to how these cosmic ecosystems exchange matter and energy. We outline a two-pronged experiment with Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) utilizing both multi-object spectroscopy to map kpc-scale CGM structures such as galactic superwinds and integral field spectroscopy to unveil the sub-kpc-scale processes such as thermal instabilities, which are theorized to govern the cool gas reservoirs long detected in pencil-beam absorption surveys. This article is an adaptation of a science case document developed by HWO's CGM/IGM Working Group.

 - **Abstract**
 The origins of the colors of Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs) represent a crucial unresolved question, central to understanding the history of our Solar System. Recent observational surveys have revealed correlations between the eccentricity and inclination of TNOs and their colors. This has rekindled the long-standing debate on whether these colors reflect the conditions of TNO formation or their subsequent collisional evolution. In this study, we address this question with 98.7% certainty, using a model-agnostic, data-driven approach based on causal graphs. First, as a sanity check, we demonstrate how our model can replicate the currently accepted paradigms of TNOs' dynamical history, blindly and without any orbital modeling or physics-based assumptions. In fact, our causal model (with no knowledge of the existence of Neptune) predicts the existence of an unknown perturbing body, i.e., Neptune. We then show how this model predicts, with high certainty, that the color of TNOs is the root cause of their inclination distribution, rather than the other way around. This strongly suggests that the colors of TNOs reflect an underlying dynamical property, most likely their formation location. Moreover, our causal model excludes formation scenarios that invoke substantial color modification by subsequent irradiation. We therefore conclude that the colors of TNOs are predominantly primordial.

 We investigate the role of tidal forces in molecular cloud formation by examining how apparent boundedness, as diagnosed by the classical virial parameter, relates to the actual gravitational state of clouds subject to tidal forces from their environment. Clouds are identified by a dendrogram algorithm in zoom-in regions taken from a simulation of a Milky Way-mass galaxy with the Voronoi mesh code AREPO that resolves star-forming regions at sub-parsec resolution. To look at a range of environments, we use data from three different regions that evolve differently in the center, near the equivalent of the Solar circle, and the outskirts of the modeled galaxy, at three different times, each spaced 2 Myr apart. We compute the importance of tidal forces on all identified clouds. We then compare the boundedness of clouds including only their internal potentials to boundedness also including the external gravitational potential. This comparison shows that tidal forces can unbind apparently bound clouds and bind apparently unbound clouds. We characterize the cloud population by comparing their virial parameters to their surface densities, finding the ratio of the maximum to the minimum eigenvalues of the tidal tensor, and determining the strength of gravitational instability in each examined region. We find that it is necessary to take the total gravitational potential into account rather than just the internal self-gravity of the clouds to have an accurate understanding of cloud dynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 The origins and acceleration mechanisms of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) are unknown. Many models attribute their extreme energies to powerful astrophysical jets. Understanding whether jet geometry -- specifically the opening angle and its orientation relative to Earth -- affects observational signatures, is crucial for interpreting UHECR data. In this work, we perform numerical simulations of UHECR propagation in a magnetized universe to investigate the spectral signatures of jetted and non-jetted astrophysical sources. We demonstrate, for the first time, that under certain conditions, emission geometry can play a decisive role in shaping the observed spectrum of individual UHECR sources. These findings provide new insights into the conditions necessary for detecting UHECRs from jets, and highlight how the interplay between emission geometry and magnetic fields influences observed energy spectra.

 - **Abstract**
 In recent years, a class of stripped-envelope supernovae (SESNe) showing two distinct light-curve peaks has emerged, where the first peak cannot be attributed to shock cooling emission. Such peculiar SNe are often studied individually, explained by a combination of powering mechanisms, but are rarely discussed broadly as a group. In this paper, we attempt to form a picture of the landscape of double-peaked SESNe and their powering mechanisms by adding two more objects -- SN 2021uvy and SN 2022hgk. SN 2021uvy is a broad, luminous SN Ib with an unusually long first peak rise and constant color evolution with rising photospheric temperature during the second peak. Though its first peak resembles SN 2019stc, their second peaks differ, making SN 2021uvy unique. SN 2022hgk shows photometric similarity to SN 2019cad and spectroscopic similarity to SN 2005bf, both proposed to be powered by a double-nickel distribution in their ejecta. We analyze their light curves and colors, compare them with a sample of double-peaked SESNe from the ZTF archive, and analyze the light curve parameters of the sample. We observe a correlation (p-value~0.025) between the peak absolute magnitudes of the first and second peaks. No single definitive powering mechanism applies to the whole sample, as it shows variety in the photometric and spectroscopic properties. However, sub-groups of similarity exist that can be explained by mechanisms like the double-nickel distribution, magnetar central engine, interaction, and fallback accretion. We also map out the duration between the peaks ($\Delta t^{21}$) vs the difference between peak absolute magnitudes ($\Delta M^{21}$) as a phase-space that could potentially delineate the most promising powering mechanisms for the double-peaked SESNe.

 - **Abstract**
 A proper modelling of the cosmic-ray ionisation rate within gas clouds is crucial to describe their chemical evolution accurately. However, this modelling is computationally demanding because it requires the propagation of cosmic rays throughout the cloud over time. We present a more efficient approach that simultaneously guarantees a reliable estimate of the cosmic-ray impact on the chemistry of prestellar cores. We introduce a numerical framework that mimics the cosmic-ray propagation within gas clouds and applies it to magnetohydrodynamic simulations performed with the code GIZMO. It simulates the cosmic-ray attenuation by computing the effective column density of H$_2$ that is traversed, which is estimated using the same kernel weighting approach as employed in the simulation. The obtained cosmic-ray ionisation rate is then used in post-processing to study the chemical evolution of the clouds. We found that cosmic-ray propagation affects deuterated and non-deuterated species significantly and that it depends on the assumed cosmic-ray spectrum. We explored correlations between the electron abundance, the cosmic-ray ionisation rate, and the abundance of the most relevant ions (HCO$^+$, N$_2$H$^+$, DCO$^+$, N$_2$D$^+$, and o-H$_2$D$^+$), with the purpose of finding simple expressions that link them. We provide an analytical formula to estimate the ionisation fraction, X(e$^-$), from observable tracers and applied it to existing observations of high-mass clumps. We obtained values of about 10$^{-8}$, which is in line with previous works and with expectations for dense clouds. We also provide a linear fit to calculate the cosmic-ray ionisation rate from the local H$_2$ density, which is to be employed in three-dimensional simulations that do not include cosmic-ray propagation.

 - **Abstract**
 Planets in the liquid-water habitable zone of low-mass stars experience large tidal forces, $10^3$ to $10^4$ times those on Earth, due to the small distance between the habitable zone and the host stars. Therefore, interior solid tides, ocean tides and atmospheric tides on these planets could be much stronger than that on Earth, but rare work has been done to explicitly simulate the ocean tides. Here, for the first time, we perform global ocean tide simulations and show that ocean tides on asynchronously rotating planets with large eccentricities can reach $\mathcal{O}(1000)\,\mathrm{m}$ in height and $\mathcal{O}(10)\,\mathrm{m\,s^{-1}}$ in flow speed. Interactions between tide and bottom topography can induce large energy dissipation, $\sim\mathcal{O}(100)\,\mathrm{W\,m^{-2}}$ in global mean. This tidal energy dissipation can strongly accelerate orbital evolution by 1-2 orders of magnitude. However, for planets with small eccentricities, the ocean tides are much weaker but still comparable to that on modern Earth. Our results suggest that ocean tides on eccentric planets orbiting low-mass stars are orders of magnitude more powerful than those on Earth and can dramatically influence surface geography and orbital evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we report auroral radio emission from a magnetic B star HD 142990 using the MeerKAT radio telescope at $900-1670$ MHz. The star is known to produce such emission (observed as periodic radio pulses) via electron cyclotron maser emission (ECME). However, past studies on ECME from this star were confined to observations at specific rotational phase ranges where one expects to see such pulses. We, for the first time, observed the star for its one complete rotation cycle and discovered that the star also produces 'off-pulse' emission, which we term as secondary enhancements. Two such enhancements were observed, one of which is left circularly polarized (LCP) and the other is right circularly polarized (RCP), the latter is confirmed to be persistent. Using simulation, we infer that such pulses are likely related to the large misalignment between the stellar rotation and magnetic dipole axes ($>80^\circ$), leading to the formation of highly complex magnetospheric plasma distribution. In addition, by extracting dynamic spectra for the primary pulses, we discovered prominent fine structures in one of the LCP pulses, with timescales as small as the instrumental time resolution (8 seconds). This is the first time that such structures are seen from a magnetic hot star, and has the potential to reveal detailed information about how the emission is driven, and the nature of the elementary sources of radiation. To pinpoint the origin of these fine structures and their significance, higher time and spectral resolution observations should be conducted in the future.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a systematic search for spatial association between a high-confidence sample of 3,166 morphologically selected galaxy mergers detected through SDSS imaging and the 4FGL-DR4 catalog of gamma-ray sources detected by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). Using a conservative 4$\sigma$ positional uncertainty threshold and a Poisson-based statistical framework, we identify 21 statistically significant associations with match probabilities $p < 0.05$. Among these are known classes of gamma-ray emitters such as flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs), BL Lacertae objects (BLL), and radio galaxies bolstering the hypothesis that merger-driven processes can fuel high-energy activity. Intriguingly, five of the associated sources remain unclassified in 4FGL-DR4, hinting at a possible link between galaxy mergers and a hitherto unrecognized population of gamma-ray sources. The dominance of AGN-like matches supports the scenario in which mergers trigger accretion onto central supermassive black holes, initiating AGN activity observable at gamma-ray energies. Moreover, the recurrent presence of unassociated sources among secure matches underscores the potential of merger catalogs as physically motivated priors in gamma-ray source identification efforts. This work constitutes the first dedicated effort to explore associations between gamma-ray sources and a large, morphologically selected sample of galaxy mergers, opening new avenues for understanding the role of interactions in high-energy astrophysics. We additionally examined the sample of 70 galaxy pairs from the Canadian Network for Observational Cosmology Field Galaxy Redshift Survey and found no statistically significant matches, with $p < 0.05$ within the 4$\sigma$ positional uncertainty threshold.

 - **Abstract**
 The powerful jets of blazars have been historically considered as likely sites of high-energy cosmic-ray acceleration. However, particulars of the launched jet and the locations of leptonic and hadronic jet loading remain unclear. In the case when leptonic and hadronic particle injection occur jointly, a temporal correlation between synchrotron radiation and neutrino production is expected. We use a first catalog of millimeter (mm) wavelength blazar light curves from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope for a time-dependent correlation with twelve years of muon neutrino events from the IceCube South Pole Neutrino Observatory. Such mm emission is known to trace activity of the bright jet base, which is often self-absorbed at lower frequencies and potentially gamma-ray opaque. We perform an analysis of the population, as well as analyses of individual, selected sources. We do not observe a significant signal from the stacked population. TXS 0506+056 is found as the most significant, individual source, though this detection is not globally significant in our analysis of selected AGN. Our results suggest that the majority of mm-bright blazars are neutrino dim. In general, it is possible that many blazars have lighter, leptonic jets, or that only selected blazars provide exceptional conditions for neutrino production.

 - **Abstract**
 One of JWST's most remarkable discoveries is a population of compact red galaxies known as Little Red Dots (LRDs). Their existence raises many questions about their nature, origin, and evolution. These galaxies show a steep decline in number density-nearly two orders of magnitude-from $z=6$ to $z=3$. In this study, we explore their potential evolution by identifying candidate descendants in CEERS, assuming a single evolutionary path: the development of a blue star-forming outskirt around the red compact core. Our color-magnitude selection identifies galaxies as red as LRDs at $z<4$, surrounded by young, blue stellar outskirts. Morphological parameters were derived from single Sérsic profile fits; physical properties were obtained from SED fitting using a stellar-only model. These "post-LRD" candidates show LRD-like features with $M_\ast \sim 10^{10} \ M_\odot $, central densities ($ \Sigma_\ast \sim 10^{11} \ M_\odot \ \text{kpc}^{-2}$ ), compact sizes, and red rest-frame colors, but with an added extended component. Their number density at $z = 3 \pm 0.5$ ( $ \sim 10^{-4.15} \, \text{Mpc}^{-3} $) matches that of LRDs at $5 < z < 7$ , supporting a possible evolutionary link. We observe a redshift-dependent increase in outskirts mass fraction and galaxy size-from $\sim 250$ pc at $ z = 5 $ to $\sim 600$ pc at $ z = 3 $-suggesting global stellar growth. Meanwhile, the core remains red and compact, but the V-shape fades as the outskirts grow. These findings support an evolutionary scenario in which LRDs gradually acquire an extended stellar component over cosmic time by cold accretion. This may explain the apparent decline in their observed number density at lower redshift.

 - **Abstract**
 An analytical treatment of the pulsar radio emission height as a function of phase is presented. Based on previous works, assuming a dipole field geometry, the emission height can be expressed as a function of phase and the impact angle. We found that: (1) The emission height is a quadratic function of the phase, given the magnetospheric geometry. The emission height is higher at the edge of the pulse profile than at the center. (2) The emission height is also quadratic function of the impact angle. This point can be compared directly with the observations of the geodetic precessing pulsar PSR J1906+0745. (3) Larger inclination angle may imply a higher emission height, when other parameters are similar. (4) By assuming curvature radiation, or inverse Compton scattering, the Lorentz factor of the radio emitting particles can be obtained as a function of phase.

 - **Abstract**
 The "Li-Dip" is an unexpected, striking, and highly non-standard anomaly of severe lithium depletion observed in mid-F dwarf stars, which has puzzled astronomers for nearly 40 years. Mechanisms proposed to explain the Li-Dip include effects related to rotation, magnetic fields, diffusion, gravity waves, and mass loss. The critical question became, which, if any, might be realistic? Here we show that mixing due to shear induced by stellar angular momentum loss is the unique mechanism driving the Li depletion. Each mechanism leaves a different signature in the subsurface Li distribution. The deepening surface convection zones of subgiants of NGC 188 evolving out of the Li-Dip dredge up the sub-surface material and thus reveal the signature of the responsible mechanism, rotation. Beryllium and boron data have also favored rotational mixing; however, these elements can be extremely difficult or impossible to observe. Our highly complementary approach provides fresh and very feasible perspectives on using Li to probe poorly understood physical mechanisms acting below the stellar surface, thereby improving fundamental understanding of stellar evolution. Rotational mixing may be the dominant mechanism that depletes Li in a wide range of Solar-type stars, including in the Sun. Possible connections to Big Bang Nucleosynthesis are discussed.
#### Impact of the Tayler magnetic instability on the surface abundance of boron in massive stars

 - **Abstract**
 Context: The surface abundances of massive stars show evidence of internal mixing, while asteroseismic data suggest that efficient angular momentum (AM) transport occurs in stellar interiors. It is of interest to find a consistent physical framework that is able to account for both of these effects simultaneously. Aims: We investigate the impact of the Tayler instability on the surface abundance of boron in massive B-type stars as predicted by rotating stellar models accounting for the advective nature of meridional currents. Methods: We used the Geneva stellar evolution code to compute models of 9, 12, and 15 Msun stars at different rotational velocities and with and without magnetic fields. We compared the surface boron abundances predicted by these models with those of observed B-type stars. Results: We find that models with only hydrodynamic transport processes overestimate the amount of boron depletion for stars with high rotation rates, in disagreement with observational constraints. We show that this excessively high mixing efficiency is a consequence of the high degree of differential rotation predicted by purely hydrodynamic models. We thus conclude that surface abundances of boron indicate that a more efficient AM transport is needed in stellar radiative zones. We then studied the impact of the Tayler instability as a possible physical explanation to this issue. Models including this instability are found to be in good agreement with constraints on the surface boron abundances, the evolutionary state, and the projected rotational velocity of moderately and fast-rotating B-type stars. Finally, we note that at low rotational velocities, models with magnetic fields do not predict sufficient depletion to be consistent with the observations. This could suggest that the current prescriptions for the Tayler instability may overestimate the AM transport in slow-rotating B-type stars.
#### Neutron Star-White Dwarf Merger as One Possible Optional Source of Kilonova-like Emission: Implications for GRB 211211A

 - **Abstract**
 Long-duration GRB 211211A, which lacked an associated supernova at such a low redshift $z=0.076$, but was associated with a possible kilonova emission, has attracted great attention. The neutron star-white dwarf (NS-WD) merger is proposed as a possible progenitor of GRB 211211A, and it could naturally explain the long duration of the prompt emission. However, the NS-WD merger is not an ideal site for producing heavy elements via r-process nucleosynthesis. In this Letter, we investigate the heavy elements produced in NS-WD mergers based on numerical simulations of nucleosynthesis via SkyNet, and then calculate the resulting kilonova-like emission to compare with the solidly observed case of possible kilonova emission associated with GRB 211211A. By adopting three models (i.e., Model-A, Model-B, and Model-C) from \cite{2023ApJ...956...71K} at different temperatures ($T=4$ GK, 5 GK, and 6 GK), which are treated as free parameters, we find that the mass number of the heaviest element produced in our simulations is less than 90 ($A< 90$). Moreover, by comparing the calculated kilonova-like emission with the afterglow-subtracted observations of the possible kilonova associated with GRB 211211A, it is found that the merger of NS and WD cannot be ruled out as the origin of GRB 211211A to produce the possible kilonova emission if the remnant of the WD-NS merger is a supramassive or stable magnetar. Otherwise, it is difficult to explain the early possible kilonova emission following GRB 211211A by invoking the merger of a WD and an NS.

 - **Abstract**
 Interband lags in the optical continua of active galactic nuclei (AGN) have been observed over years of monitoring, yet their physical origins remain unclear. While variable interband lags have been found in a few individual AGN potentially, the temporal behavior of interband lags of an AGN sample has not been explored systematically. Here, we analyze the interband lags of 94 bright AGN at $z<0.8$, using both seasonal one-year and full six-year $gri$-band light curves from Zwicky Transient Facility Data Release 22. We find that more than half of 94 AGN show significant seasonal variations in the interband lags. Besides, the short-term lags, derived by averaging lags inferred from multiple seasonal light curves, are consistently smaller than the long-term lags, which are inferred from the full six-year light curves. This supports recent theoretical simulations where the lag measurement is sensitive to the baseline of light curve and the lag variation could be simply attributed to the inherent randomness of AGN variability. Our findings suggest that the interband lags of AGN are more complex and stochastic than commonly thought, and highlight the importance of high-precision time-domain surveys in uncovering the properties of AGN variability as well as the associated accretion physics.

 - **Abstract**
 The next generation of cosmology surveys will probe the matter distribution of the universe to unparalleled precision. To match this level of precision in cosmological parameter estimation, we need to use information at small scales of $\sim$ 1 Mpc, which requires an accurate model of baryonic feedback. In this paper, we employ the Dark Matter + Baryon (DMB) model, a flexible halo model that is well-fit to various hydrodynamical simulations, to extract information on baryonic feedback from galaxy cluster observables. Using a sample of thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) selected galaxy clusters from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) - with masses calibrated via weak lensing from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) - we develop a robust end-to-end pipeline that directly models the calibrated observables. Our analysis demonstrates that the tSZ Y-M relation can constrain several DMB model parameters, providing key insights into baryonic feedback effects on cosmic shear at the several percent level. We find a preference for intermediate to strong levels of feedback, which is both consistent with several hydrodynamic simulations and competitive with similar analyses performed on complementary probes. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results in the context of current and upcoming cosmic shear surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) is one of the most intriguing mysteries in astroparticle physics and high-energy physics. Since UHECRs with light mass compositions are less deflected by the Galactic and extragalactic magnetic fields, their arrival directions are more strongly correlated with their origins. Charged-particle astronomy with UHECRs is hence a potentially viable probe of extremely energetic phenomena in the universe. The Global Cosmic Ray Observatory (GCOS) is a proposed next-generation observatory to elucidate these origins through precise measurements of UHECRs with unprecedented exposure and mass identification capabilities. We will focus on the ideas and requirements for GCOS summarized in arXiv:2502.05657 and share the recent advances in detector developments and future perspectives with interdisciplinary research.

 The China Space Station Telescope (CSST) is a next-generation Stage-IV sky survey telescope, distinguished by its large field of view (FoV), high image quality, and multi-band observation capabilities. It can simultaneously conduct precise measurements of the Universe by performing multi-color photometric imaging and slitless spectroscopic surveys. The CSST is equipped with five scientific instruments, i.e. Multi-band Imaging and Slitless Spectroscopy Survey Camera (SC), Multi-Channel Imager (MCI), Integral Field Spectrograph (IFS), Cool Planet Imaging Coronagraph (CPI-C), and THz Spectrometer (TS). Using these instruments, the CSST is expected to make significant contributions and discoveries across various astronomical fields, including cosmology, galaxy and active galactic nuclei (AGN), the Milky Way and nearby galaxies, stars, exoplanets, Solar System objects, astrometry, and transients and variable sources. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the CSST instruments, observational capabilities, data products, and scientific potential.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations reveal small-scale reconnection-driven plasma ejections, often termed nanojets, triggered by magnetic field interactions at slight misalignment angles. These fast, collimated plasma ejections are $\sim$1.5 Mm long and $\sim$0.5 Mm wide. In this study, we analyze two high-resolution extreme ultraviolet imaging datasets from the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager onboard the Solar Orbiter mission, corresponding to an eruptive (M7.6) and a confined (C1.2) flare, to investigate the dynamics of nanoflare ejections and, for the first time, compare their properties in distinct magnetic environments. We identified 59 nanoflare ejections: 44 in the eruptive flare and 15 in the confined flare event. Our analysis reveals that these events form two distinct classes: confined events exhibit lower speeds (41--174 kms$^{-1}$) and lower kinetic energies ($10^{20}$--$10^{22}$ erg), placing them closely in or near the picoflare energy regime, while eruptive events show higher speeds (131--775 kms$^{-1}$) and higher kinetic energies ($10^{22}$--$10^{24}$ erg), falling within the nanoflare regime. Furthermore, magnetic field extrapolations reveal a highly sheared arcade with greater twist and higher magnetic energy density in the eruptive event, compared to the less twisted configuration in the confined event. We infer that this sheared arcade configuration in the eruptive event creates favorable conditions for higher speeds and kinetic energies, unlike the less braided structure in the confined event. Our findings highlight the crucial role of the surrounding magnetic environment in regulating the energetics of nanoflare ejections in the solar atmosphere.

 - **Abstract**
 Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) measures two standard observables: group delay and fringe frequency (delay rate). While group delay is widely used to estimate a broad range of geodetic and astrometric parameters, fringe frequency has, to date, been largely ignored. Here, we show that the fringe frequency is a unique tool for direct estimation of the instantaneous Earth angular rotation velocity, which is not accessible with the group delay alone. We estimate the magnitude of the Earth angular rotation velocity using a 30-year set of VLBI data and obtain daily estimates of X and Y angles linking the Instantaneous Rotation Pole (IRP) and the International Celestial Reference System (ICRS) pole. The plain least-squares method was applied to analyse the fringe frequency available from routine geodetic VLBI observations. We estimate three components of the Earth rotation vector on a daily basis with a formal error of 1 prad/s in relative units, or better, if a large international VLBI network is at work. The newly obtained values can be used to monitor the Earth rotation irregularity in parallel to the traditional length-of-day (LOD) values and to directly assess the modern precession-nutation theory.

 - **Abstract**
 The B-mode of polarization of the CMB is a uniquely powerful probe of gravitational waves produced in the very early Universe. But searches for primordial B-mode anisotropies must contend with gravitational lensing, which induces late-time B-modes not associated with gravitational waves. These lensing B-modes can be removed -- i.e., delensed -- using observations of the E-modes and a proxy of the matter fluctuations along the line of sight that caused the deflections. The number density and redshift reach of galaxy surveys such as the upcoming Rubin observatory offer attractive prospects for using them to delens B-mode data from CMB experiments such as the Simons Observatory, LiteBIRD or CMB-S4. However, stochasticity and non-linear galaxy bias may in principle decorrelate the galaxy field from the matter distribution responsible for the lensing effect, thus hindering efforts to delens B-modes. In addition, non-linear gravitational evolution and bias introduce non-Gaussianities in the large-scale structure which further complicate the modelling. We quantify these effects by populating an N-body simulation with a magnitude-limited, photometric sample of galaxies similar to Rubin's gold selection, and using them to delens CMB maps lensed by the same matter distribution. We find that pipelines that treat the galaxy overdensity as a Gaussian field will incur negligible bias on the inferred tensor-to-scalar ratio, r. Moreover, we show that even in a highly conservative scenario where only the linear bias of the galaxies can be determined, the bias on r arising from this simplification is well within statistical uncertainties for a cosmic-variance limited scenario where Rubin-like galaxies are used for delensing.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of a deep neutral hydrogen (Hi) observation of the early-type galaxy NGC 2768 using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). Leveraging the high sensitivity of FAST, we discover an extended gas envelope around NGC 2768. The total Hi mass is measured to be 8.1 x 10^8 M_sun , representing a magnitude increase compared to previous Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) studies. Position-velocity (PV) diagram indicates the envelope mainly involves two components: an Hi disk of NGC 2768 and a newly discovered satellite galaxy without detectable counterparts in currently deep optical surveys. The center of the gas disk is mis-aligned with the optical disk of NGC 2768, with more gas redshifted, indicating it has been disturbed. Our study indicates NGC 2768 is currently undergoing a transition from a spiral galaxy to an S0. Previous deep WSRT observations reveal two dense clumps (named as Clumps A and Clump B throughout this paper) in the center of the envelope. We find Clump A corresponds to the densest part of the disk, while Clump B might be a newly discovered satellite galaxy which probably collided NGC 2768 about 0.38 Gyr ago. We also find tidal interactions between Clump B and PGC 2599651, NGC 2768 and UGC 4808. Based on these new findings, we finally analyze hierarchical accretion history of NGC 2768.

 - **Abstract**
 The corona is an integral component of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) which can produce the X-ray emission. However, many of its physical properties and the mechanisms powering this emission remain a mystery. In this work, we study the coronal X-ray variabilities of 13 AGNs by Gaussian Process. 2-10 keV light curves of 13 AGNs can be successfully described by the damped-random walk (DRW) model. The extracted coronal X-ray timescales range from 3 to 50 days. In the plot of variability timescale versus black hole mass, the coronal X-ray timescales of four sources occupy almost the same region as the optical timescales of the accretion disk, with the latter matching the predicted thermal instability timescale of the disk. In contrast, the X-ray timescales of the remaining sources exhibit a systematic offset toward lower values. We propose that the coronal X-ray variability may be driven by internal processes within the corona itself (such as thermal conduction). On the other hand, it may also be triggered by local thermal instabilities occurring in different regions (close to the central black hole) of the accretion disk, which propagate to the corona via disk-corona coupling.

 - **Abstract**
 Pulsars are typically characterized by their stable, highly magnetized, and fast-rotating nature, which underpins their persistent radio emissions. However, the discovery of prolonged radio-quiet ("off") states in intermittent pulsars, such as PSR B1931+24, has challenged the most fundamental theory of pulsar magnetospheric emission. Despite long-term monitoring with several telescopes, continuous emission during these "off" states had not been detected in 20 years of observations. Fortunately, sensitive observations via Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) revealed the mysterious weak emission containing occasional bursting dwarf pulses during the "off" states of PSR B1931+24. Along with a substantial decrease in flux density, a significant contraction in the integrated pulse width is measured in the "off" state compared to the radio-loud ("on") state, indicating alterations in the plasma supply and magnetospheric structure. Additionally, a previously unobserved dyssynchronous, nonuniform emission pattern is found in both states, supporting theories of a spatially inhomogeneous pair-cascade mechanism and challenging models of spatially coherent discharge. Furthermore, occasional dwarf pulses detected during the "off" state show flux and width distributions similar to those of the "on" state pulses, suggesting a potential link between the "on" and "off" state emissions of PSR B1931+24. Consequently, dwarf pulses are unlikely to represent a distinct emission mode as previously thought; instead, they appear to be part of a continuum within the pulsar's emission behaviors observed during the "on" state. These findings strongly support the basic theory of the pulsar magnetospheric emission and significantly advance our understanding of pulsar magnetospheric dynamics and their emission mechanisms.
#### Insights from the "Red devil" AT 2022fpx: A dust-reddened TDE family excluded by their apparent red color?

 - **Abstract**
 We report unnoticed but intriguing features in the peculiar nuclear transient AT 2022fpx, and investigate its type. These features include the constantly red optical color of $g-r>0$, stable soft X-ray flare ($kT\sim100$ eV) in the past $\sim$550 days, prominent mid-infrared echo peaked at $\sim$$10^{43.3}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and the confirmation of a weak AGN by weak flares in pre-event WISE mid-infrared light curves with no contemporary optical, radio or X-ray counterparts. The combination of the optical red color and possible TDE origin of AT 2022fpx is particularly attractive, as it challenges the most widely accepted and adopted "blue color" criterion for optical TDE selection. Although we still cannot confirm whether the red color is intrinsic, we however find that the "blue color" criterion can filter out normal TDEs whose optical-UV spectral energy distributions (SEDs) are either severely contaminated by prominent emission lines (especially H$\alpha$) or heavily dust-reddened. Hence, its potential selection effect may have been imprinted on the whole optical TDE family. Blackbody fitting on the optical (rest-frame $\sim$$4000-7000$ Å) and optical-UV ($\sim$$2000-7000$ Å) SEDs of four TDEs with high-cadence UV observations shows that $T_\mathrm{bb}$ rise by $\sim$40$-$110 % when the UV bands are included. The power-law models ($f_{\lambda}\propto\lambda^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha=2-3$) can fit the rest-frame $\sim$$2000-7000$ Å SEDs more consistently, indicating that SEDs should peak at shorter wavelengths, but not simple blackbodies. Hence, the estimated released energy for the optical-UV bright but X-ray faint TDEs based on blackbody SED fitting should be significantly lower than the intrinsic energy.

 - **Abstract**
 The work is devoted to the study of periodic structures in the magnetic field of the photosphere. The polarity of the Sun's magnetic fields shows cyclicity with periods of 1-3 years, which is possibly due to quasi-biennial variations that are found in various parameters of solar activity, interplanetary space, and in cosmic rays. In this work, variations in weak magnetic fields of the photosphere were investigated, which required the use of special data processing methods. Synoptic maps of the photospheric magnetic field for the period 1978-2016 (NSO Kitt Peak) were used. To highlight the contribution of weak magnetic fields, the saturation threshold for synoptic maps was set at 5 G. Based on thus transformed synoptic maps, a time-latitude diagram was constructed. For the selected latitude intervals, smoothing, trend removal and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) were performed. In the time-latitude diagram, 6 spatiotemporal regions with distinct cyclic structure were observed during 4 solar cycles (21-24). The periods ranged from 0.5 to 4 years with a maximum at 1.2 years. The amplitude of ripples is significantly higher for those intervals in which the polar field had positive sign. This effect confirms the connection of ripples variations with the polarity of the 22-year magnetic cycle.

 - **Abstract**
 Polarization measurements provide strong constraints on magnetic fields in star-forming systems. While magnetic field estimates of a few kiloGauss (kG) have been obtained near the surface of low-mass protostars, there are no analogous measurements in the immediate vicinity of the surface of massive protostars. We report the measurement of radio continuum circular polarization (CP) towards a massive protostar IRAS 18162-2048 for the first time wielding Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) observations. The fractional CP varies between $3-5\%$ across the observed frequency range of $4-6$ GHz. We consider multiple hypotheses for the production of CP and propose (i) gyrosynchrotron emission and (ii) Faraday conversion due to turbulence in the magnetic medium - both driven by mildly relativistic electrons as plausible mechanisms. We estimate, for the first time, a magnetic field $B\gtrsim20-35$ G close to the massive protostar. The Lorentz factor of the low energy electrons is estimated to be in the range $\gamma_{min}\sim5-7$ for gyrosynchrotron emission and $80-100$ for Faraday conversion from our observations. The magnetic field estimate can provide important constraints to the formation models of massive stars.

 - **Abstract**
 The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) now allows us to observe galaxies at the end of cosmic dawn ($z \sim 10-15$) with unprecedented detail, revealing their morphologies, sizes, and internal structures. These observations offer crucial insights into the physical processes driving early galaxy formation. In this work, we introduce the Phoebos hydrodynamical cosmological simulation, a state-of-the-art 100 Mpc volume designed to study the formation and evolution of galaxies at the end of cosmic dawn and into the epoch of reionization. Phoebos includes a stellar feedback model that is intentionally weak, in order to address the high abundance of massive galaxies seen by JWST at early epochs. At variance with most large cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, we do not employ an effective equation of state model, instead our radiative cooling model allows us to capture the multi-phase nature of the gas inside and around galaxies. Phoebos reproduces key observables of early galaxy formation at $z \gtrsim 8$, including the stellar mass function and the stellar-to-halo mass relation. It also recovers the observed slope of the stellar size-to-mass relation and matches the specific star formation rate remarkably well. These results suggest that highly efficient star formation in the presence of only mild regulation from stellar feedback, drives early galaxy growth, supporting a scenario of rapid stellar mass assembly during cosmic dawn. There are indications in the cosmic star formation density that, at lower redshifts, Phoebos might overpredict the stellar mass within the systems, suggesting that a transition to a stronger stellar feedback may be necessary to reproduce later-time observations. These results highlight the potential of Phoebos to interpret JWST observations and to probe the evolving physical processes that shape galaxy formation.

 - **Abstract**
 We attempt to measure the $z = 8.2$ Epoch of Reionization (EoR) 21-cm bispectrum (BS) using Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) $154.2~\mathrm{MHz}$ data. We find that $B(k_{1\perp}, k_{2\perp}, k_{3\perp}, k_{1\parallel}, k_{2\parallel})$ the 3D cylindrical BS exhibits a foreground wedge, similar to $P(k_{1\perp},k_{1\parallel})$ the 21-cm cylindrical power spectrum. However, the BS foreground wedge, which depends on $(k_{1\perp},k_{1\parallel})$, $(k_{2\perp},k_{2\parallel})$ and $(k_{3\perp},k_{3\parallel})$ the three sides of a triangle, is more complicated. Considering various foreground avoidance scenarios, we identify the region where all three sides are outside the foreground wedge as the EoR window for the 21-cm BS. However, the EoR window is contaminated by a periodic pattern of spikes that arises from the periodic pattern of missing frequency channels in the data. We evaluate the binned 3D spherical BS for triangles of all possible sizes and shapes, and present results for $\Delta^3$ the mean cube brightness temperature fluctuations. The best $2\sigma$ upper limits we obtain for the EoR 21-cm signal are $\Delta^3_{\rm UL} = (1.81\times 10^3)^3~\mathrm{mK}^3$ at $k_1 = 0.008~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ and $\Delta^3_{\rm UL} = (2.04\times 10^3)^3~\mathrm{mK}^3$ at $k_1 = 0.012~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ for equilateral and squeezed triangles, respectively. These are foreground-dominated, and are many orders of magnitude larger than the predicted EoR 21-cm signal $(\sim 10^3 ~\mathrm{mK}^3)$.

 - **Abstract**
 The study of star cluster evolution necessitates modeling how their density profiles develop from their natal gas distribution. Observational evidence indicates that many star clusters follow a Plummer density profile. However, most studies have focused on the phase after gas ejection, neglecting the influence of gas on early dynamical evolution. We investigate the development of star clusters forming within gas clouds, particularly those with a centrally concentrated gas profile. Simulations were conducted using the \texttt{Torch} framework, integrating the \texttt{FLASH} magnetohydrodynamics code into \texttt{AMUSE}. This permits detailed modeling of star formation, stellar evolution, stellar dynamics, radiative transfer, and gas magnetohydrodynamics. We study the collapse of centrally concentrated, turbulent spheres with a total mass of $2.5\times 10^3\, M_\odot$, investigating the effects of varying numerical resolution and star formation scenarios. The free-fall time is shorter at the center than at the edges of the cloud, with a minimum value of $0.55\,\mathrm{Myr}$. The key conclusions from this study are: (1) subclusters initially form even in dense gas clouds; (2) the final stellar density profile is consistent with a Plummer profile, but more centrally concentrated than analytically predicted; (3) gas collapses globally toward the center on the central free-fall time scale, contradicting the assumption in analytical models of local fragmentation and star formation; (4) hence, gas is predominantly ejected from the innermost regions; and (5) the final value of the SFE depends on the mass and formation time of the most massive star as well as the overall star formation timescale.

 - **Abstract**
 Long-period transients (LPTs) are a new and enigmatic class of objects that produce bright pulsations in the radio, with periods far exceeding those seen in rotationally powered pulsars. The proposed progenitors for LPTs are contested, with white dwarfs or magnetars being likely candidates. Here, we present the discovery of ILT\,J163430+445010, a new LPT detected in a blind search for Stokes\,V transients in the LOFAR Two-Metre Sky Survey. Unusual for LPTs, J1634+44 shows pulses that are 100\% circularly polarised, as well as pulses that are 100\% linearly polarised, with the polarisation state changing from pulse to pulse. We detect 19 pulses in total, each with a total polarisation fraction of $\sim100\%$ and a pulse duration of at most 10\,s. The pulses show a periodicity at $841.24808\pm0.00015$\,s, implying a low duty cycle of $0.012$. J1634+44 has a marginally detected counterpart in the ultraviolet GALEX MIS survey and the ultraviolet/optical UNIONS survey, suggesting that it contains a white dwarf with an effective temperature between 15000\,K and 33000\,K. We do not detect J1634+44 with a deep $J$-band exposure with UKIRT at a $3\sigma$ AB magnitude limit of 24.7, ruling out a main-sequence star or ultracool dwarf with a spectral type earlier than M7. The pulses from J1634+44 follow a particular pattern, with two pulses being produced every five periods after a waiting time of two or three periods. This pattern could be a result of spin-orbit coupling in a binary system with a 5:2 or 5:3 resonance, where a companion induces beamed radio emission on the white dwarf. The companion is most likely an ultracool dwarf or another white dwarf, making J1634+44 unique among the currently known sample of LPTs.

 - **Abstract**
 Disc winds play a crucial role in many accreting astrophysical systems across all scales. In accreting white dwarfs (AWDs) and active galactic nuclei (AGN), radiation pressure on spectral lines is a promising wind-driving mechanism. However, the efficiency of line driving is extremely sensitive to the ionization state of the flow, making it difficult to construct a reliable physical picture of these winds. Recently, we presented the first radiation-hydrodynamic (RHD) simulations for AWDs that incorporated detailed, multi-dimensional ionization calculations via fully frequency-dependent radiative transfer, using the Sirocco code coupled to PLUTO. These simulations produced much weaker line-driven winds (Mdot_wind / Mdot_acc < 1e-5 for our adopted parameters) than earlier studies using more approximate treatments of ionization and radiative transfer (which yielded Mdot_wind / Mdot_acc ~ 1e-4). One remaining limitation of our work was the assumption of an isothermal outflow. Here, we relax this by adopting an ideal gas equation of state and explicitly solving for the multi-dimensional temperature structure of the flow. In the AWD setting, accounting for the thermal state of the wind does not change the overall conclusions drawn from the isothermal approximation. Our new simulations confirm the line-driving efficiency problem: the predicted outflows are too highly ionized, meaning they neither create optimal driving conditions nor reproduce the observed ultraviolet wind signatures. Possible solutions include wind clumping on sub-grid scales, a softer-than-expected spectral energy distribution, or additional driving mechanisms. With the physics now built into our simulations, we are well-equipped to also explore line-driven disc winds in AGN.
#### Rossby number regime, convection suppression, and dynamo-generated magnetism in inflated hot Jupiters

 - **Abstract**
 Hot Jupiters (HJs) are commonly thought to host the strongest dynamo-generated magnetic fields among exoplanets, up to one order of magnitude larger than Jupiter. Thus, they have often been regarded as the most promising exoplanets to display magnetic star-planet interaction signals and magnetically-driven coherent radio emission, which unfortunately remains elusive, despite many diversified observational campaigns. In this work, we investigate the evolution of the internal convection and dynamo properties of HJs via one-dimensional models. We explore the dependency on orbital distance, planetary and stellar masses, and types of heat injection. We employ one-dimensional evolutionary models to obtain internal convective structures. Specifically, we obtain the Rossby number $\mathrm{Ro}$ as a function of planetary depth and orbital period, after showing that tidal synchronization is likely valid for all HJs. When the heat is applied uniformly, the convective layers of almost all HJs remain in the fast rotator regime, $\mathrm{Ro} \lesssim 0.1$, except possibly the most massive planets with large orbital distances (but still tidally locked). We recover magnetic field strengths for inflated HJs by applying well-known scaling laws for fast rotators. When strong heat sources are applied mostly in the outer envelope and outside the dynamo region, as realistic Ohmic models predict, convection in the dynamo region often breaks down. Consequently, the heat flux and the derived surface magnetic fields can be greatly reduced to or below Jovian values, contrary to what is commonly assumed, thus negatively affecting estimates for coherent radio emission, and possibly explaining the failure in detecting it so far.

 - **Abstract**
 Accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in galaxy mergers with separations $<$ 1kpc are crucial to our understanding of SMBH growth, galaxy evolution, and the evolution of SMBH binaries. Despite their importance, there are less than a handful known, and most have been discovered serendipitously. In this work, we employ a new selection method to systematically pre-select candidate advanced mergers likely to contain unresolved substructure at sub-arcsecond scales. By exploiting the large survey area and astrometric precision of the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we have identified a sample of 48 nearby advanced mergers that have red WISE colors ($W_1-W_2>0.5$) indicative of accretion activity and significant sub-arcsecond offsets between their optical and infrared coordinates as measured by SDSS and WISE. We conducted high resolution adaptive optics (AO) observations of this sample with the Keck NIRC2 camera in the $K_p$ band ($2.124 ~ \mu m$, $\Delta\lambda = 0.351 \mu m$) to search for evidence of previously unresolved substructure suggested by the optical-to-infared offsets. We find that a significant fraction (20/48 or 42%) of the sample shows substructure tracing the SDSS/WISE offset and unresolved by SDSS, demonstrating that our methodology is a promising pathway to find dual AGN in follow-up spectroscopy. Archival optical Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging reveals that substructure identified with Keck is often missed in the optical or erroneously identified due to partial obscuration, underscoring the importance of carrying out studies of late-stage mergers in the infrared.
