 - **Abstract**
 Space weather is among the most powerful and least understood forces shaping planetary atmospheres. In our Solar System, we observe its effects directly: atmospheric escape, chemical disruption, and spectacular auroral displays. Yet for exoplanets, we lack the tools and data to comprehensively assess the impacts of space weather, especially invisible elements like stellar winds, coronal mass ejections, energetic particles, and variable interplanetary magnetic fields. This problem lies at the intersection of four key fields: heliophysics, planetary science, astrobiology, and astrophysics. In 2023--2025, experts from these four fields convened at the W. M. Keck Institute for Space Studies to explore pathways for advancing the study of exospace weather. Organizing the subject into five core themes -- planets and their stellar particle environments, stellar magnetism and space weather modeling, quasi-steady stellar winds, transient events, and programmatic pathways -- our team synthesized concepts from across relevant fields and identified a wide array of opportunities for progress. This report is the product of that effort. It assembles cross-disciplinary knowledge; highlights outstanding theoretical challenges; explores promising innovations in observation, modeling, methodology, and instrumentation; and makes recommendations for accelerating community-wide progress. Together, these lay out a path to transforming the challenging, yet tractable problem of exospace weather into a foundational element of our understanding exoplanetary systems, and our own Solar System, in their entirety.

 - **Abstract**
 Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are important drivers of galactic evolution; however, the underlying physical processes governing their properties remain uncertain. In particular, the specific cause for the generation of the broad-line region is unclear. There is a region where the underlying accretion disc atmosphere becomes cool enough for dust condensation. Using models of the disc's vertical structure, accounting for dust condensation and irradiation from the central source, we show that their upper atmospheres become extended, dusty, and radiation-pressure-supported. Due to the density--temperature dependence of dust condensation, this extended atmosphere forms as the dust abundance slowly increases with height, resulting in density and temperature scale heights considerably larger than the gas pressure scale height. We show that such an atmospheric structure is linearly unstable. An increase in the gas density raises the dust sublimation temperature, leading to an increased dust abundance, a higher opacity, and hence a net vertical acceleration. Using localised 2D hydrodynamic simulations, we demonstrate the existence of our linear instability. In the non-linear state, the disc atmosphere evolves into ``fountains'' of dusty material that are vertically launched by radiation pressure before being exposed to radiation from the central source, which sublimates the dust and shuts off the radiative acceleration. These dust-free clumps then evolve ballistically, continuing upward before falling back towards the disc under gravity. This clumpy ionized region has velocity dispersions $\gtrsim 1000$ km/s. This instability and our simulations are representative of the Failed Radiatively Accelerated Dusty Outflow (FRADO) model proposed for the AGN broad-line region.

 - **Abstract**
 The evolution of the rest-frame ultraviolet luminosity function (UV LF) is a powerful probe of early star formation and stellar mass build-up. At z > 6, its bright end (MUV < -21) remains poorly constrained due to the small volumes of existing near-infrared (NIR) space-based surveys. The Euclid Deep Fields (EDFs) will cover 53 deg^2 with NIR imaging down to 26.5 AB, increasing area by a factor of 100 over previous space-based surveys. They thus offer an unprecedented opportunity to select bright z > 6 Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) and constrain the UV LF's bright end. With NIR coverage extending to 2um, Euclid can detect galaxies out to z = 13. We present forecasts for the number densities of z > 6 galaxies expected in the final EDF dataset. Using synthetic photometry from spectral energy distribution (SED) templates of z = 5--15 galaxies, z = 1--4 interlopers, and Milky Way MLT dwarfs, we explore optimal selection methods for high-z LBGs. A combination of S/N cuts with SED fitting (from optical to MIR) yields the highest-fidelity sample, recovering >76% of input z > 6 LBGs while keeping low-z contamination <10%. This excludes instrumental artefacts, which will affect early Euclid releases. Auxiliary data are critical: optical imaging from the Hyper Suprime-Cam and Vera C. Rubin Observatory distinguishes genuine Lyman breaks, while Spitzer/IRAC data help recover z > 10 sources. Based on empirical double power-law LF models, we expect >100,000 LBGs at z = 6-12 and >100 at z > 12 in the final Euclid release. In contrast, steeper Schechter models predict no z > 12 detections. We also present two ultra-luminous (MUV < -23.5) candidates from the EDF-N Q1 dataset. If their redshifts are confirmed, their magnitudes support a DPL LF model at z > 9, highlighting Euclid's power to constrain the UV LF's bright end and identify the most luminous early galaxies for follow-up.

 - **Abstract**
 We present precise J- and K-band photometric measurements for 128 near-infrared secondary standard stars, located in the 19 UKIRT/MKO primary faint standard fields. The data were collected over more than 50 nights, covering a decade of observations between 2008 and 2018 at the ESO La Silla Observatory, using the New Technology Telescope (NTT) equipped with the SOFI NIR camera. Presented magnitudes are calibrated onto the MKO photometric system. The J- and K-band magnitudes range from 10 to 15.8 mag, with median values of $\tilde{J}$ = 13.5 and $\tilde{K}$ = 13 mag. The selection process ensured high photometric quality, with a precision better than 0.01 mag for all stars. The catalog excludes stars with close neighbors, high proper motion, or variable stars. Using these fields for standardization can improve the precision and accuracy of photometric calibrations without increasing the observational time cost.

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce a focal-plane detector for advancing the energy and angular resolutions of current X-ray telescopes. The architecture integrates a metallic magnetic microcalorimeter (MMC) array of paramagnetic absorber pads with a thin layer of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond for simultaneous optical readout. An impinging X-ray photon induces a temperature transient in an absorber pad, kept at ~35 mK. This time- and temperature-dependent magnetic field transient is then optically imaged by diamond NV centers, kept at 4 K and positioned directly below the pad. For a 10 $\mu$m absorber length used with a 12 m focal length telescope, our design yields an optimal angular resolution of ~0.17 arcseconds and energy resolution of ~0.70 eV. Our NV-MMC design improves upon current transition-edge sensors (TES) or MMCs read-out by superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUID) by enabling simultaneous optical readout of the entire MMC array. Because no additional cryogenic multiplexing electronics are required, our approach scales naturally to larger and finer arrays, supporting finer angular resolutions and wider fields of view.

 - **Abstract**
 (Abridged) The bimodality between star-forming discs and quiescent spheroids requires the existence of two main processes: the galaxy quenching and the morphological transformation. In this paper, we aim to understand the link between these processes and their relation with the stellar mass of galaxies and their local environment. Taking advantage of the first data released by the Euclid Collaboration, covering more than 60 deg2 with space-based imaging and photometry, we analyse a mass-complete sample of nearly one million galaxies in the range 0.25<z<1 with $M_\ast>10^{9.5} M_\odot$. We divide the sample into four sub-populations of galaxies, based on their star-formation activity and morphology. We then analyse the physical properties of these populations and their relative abundances in the stellar mass vs. local density plane. Together with confirming the passivity-density relation and the morphology-density relation, we find that quiescent discy galaxies are more abundant in the low-mass regime of high-density environment. At the same time, star-forming bulge-dominated galaxies are more common in field regions, preferentially at high masses. Building on these results and interpreting them through comparison with simulations, we propose a scenario where the evolution of galaxies in the field significantly differs from that in higher-density environments. The morphological transformation in the majority of field galaxies takes place before the onset of quenching and is mainly driven by secular processes taking place within the main sequence, leading to the formation of star-forming bulge-dominated galaxies as intermediate-stage galaxies. Conversely, quenching of star formation precedes morphological transformation for most galaxies in higher-density environments. This causes the formation of quiescent disc-dominated galaxies before their transition into bulge-dominated ones.
#### Black holes in the low-mass galaxy regime: imprint of AGN feedback on the circumgalactic medium of central dwarf galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 Active galactic nuclei (AGN) have been observed in dwarf galaxies, yet the impact of black hole feedback in these low-mass systems remains unclear. To uncover the potential effects of AGN in the low-mass galaxy regime, we study the properties and demographics of active dwarf galaxies at $z=0$, using the IllustrisTNG simulations. We use data from the TNG50-1 simulation, selecting central galaxies with stellar masses in the range $8 \leq \log(M_\ast/{\rm M_\odot}) \leq 9.5$, and selecting AGN based on their Eddington ratio ($\lambda_{\rm Edd}$). We analyzed the properties and environment of AGN host galaxies and compared them with inactive control galaxies. The AGN fractions found in the simulation depend strongly on the threshold for $\lambda_{\rm Edd}$ in the AGN selection, ranging from $\sim$ 1\% ($\lambda_{\rm Edd} \geq 0.05$) to $\sim$ 24\% ($\lambda_{\rm Edd} \geq 0.01$). In comparison with non-AGN galaxies of similar stellar and halo mass, dwarf AGN hosts are deficient in neutral gas, having $\sim$ 3.9 times less neutral mass, in qualitative agreement with observations. The dearth in neutral gas is stronger beyond two stellar half-mass radii ($r \gtrsim 3$ kpc), and AGN hosts have more extended gas components than non-AGN galaxies, with a gas half-mass radius, on average, $\gtrsim$ 10 kpc larger. AGN hosts are also slightly less star-forming, but have no differences in local environment. We found that AGN can significantly decrease the neutral gas component of dwarf galaxies, a direct effect of the high-accretion feedback mode employed in IllustrisTNG. However, it is important to test our findings with observations to unveil the complete role of AGN in dwarf galaxies. In TNG50, dwarf AGN fractions are an order of magnitude larger than those observed, motivating a detailed investigation to precisely quantify the mismatch between simulations and observations.
#### Euclid: Quick Data Release (Q1)- The connection between galaxy close encounters and radio activity

 - **Abstract**
 Using the large statistics provided by both Euclid and the LOFAR surveys, we present the first large-scale study of the connection between radio emission, its morphology, and the merging properties of the hosts of radio sources up to z=2. By dividing the radio sample into active galactic nuclei (AGN) and star-forming galaxies, we find that radio-emitting AGN show a clear preference to reside within galaxies undergoing a merging event. This is more significant for AGN that present extended and/or complex radio emission: indeed, about half of them are associated with merging systems, while only 15% are hosted by an isolated galaxy. The observed trend is primarily driven by AGN residing at z < 1, especially in the case of high - P144MHz > 10^24 W Hz-1 sr-1 - radio luminosities (60% in mergers versus 10% isolated regardless of radio appearance). The situation is reversed in the case of radio-emitting star-forming galaxies, which are preferentially associated with isolated systems. This is more significant as we move towards low radio-luminosity/star-formation objects (P144MHz < 10^23 W Hz-1 sr-1) for which we find 40% in isolated systems versus 20% in mergers. These values hold regardless of redshift. We interpret the above result for AGN with their need to accrete outer gas from local encounters in order to trigger (radio) activity, especially in the case of extended radio emission such as hot-spots and lobes. This is mostly observed at z < 1, since in the local Universe galaxies are more gas deprived than their higher-redshift counterparts. Internal gas reservoirs instead seem sufficient to trigger star formation within the majority of galaxies, which indeed prefer to be associated with isolated systems at all redshifts probed.

 - **Abstract**
 The Sun's magnetic field is a key driver in coronal heating and consequently solar wind acceleration. Remote measurement of the photosphere provides the magnetic surface boundary condition necessary for data-constrained 3D global coronal models. With one such model, we explore how the spatial resolution of the surface boundary condition influences the global properties of the magnetic field and coronal heating. Using spherical harmonic decomposition, we quantify how three different resolution simulations vary in the low and middle corona. Through examination of the magnetic field, the squashing factor, and the heating rate, we demonstrate that small-scale photospheric magnetic flux enhances heating across spatial regimes. We calculate 40% more heating in our best resolution simulation as compared to our base resolution. We describe a strong correlation between the structure of the magnetic field and structure of the heating rate in the low corona across resolutions. These results provide key information as to what more efficient, low-resolution models might inherently miss. This can provide context to incorporate the effects of unresolvable features in future modeling efforts.

 - **Abstract**
 GHZ2 is among the highest-redshift galaxies discovered to date, exhibiting a spectrum rich with prominent emission lines in the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) and optical. These features raise critical questions about the mechanism powering this nebular emission, in particular the extremely strong C IV$\lambda$1548 emission (rest-frame EW $=$ 45 Angstrom). Here we aim to quantify the AGN contribution within this system using the BEAGLE-AGN tool to simultaneously fit the spectrum and photometry of GHZ2. We consider a range of models with and without AGN components, allowing us to disentangle the stellar and AGN contribution of GHZ2 for the first time. We conclude that a partial contribution by an AGN is significantly favored based on the Bayes factor comparison to models without an AGN component, measuring an AGN contribution of 54$^{+1}_{-1}$% and 26$^{+4}_{-2}$% for the C IV$\lambda$1548 and C III]$\lambda$1908 emission lines, respectively. We obtain an estimate for the black hole mass using the accretion luminosity ($L_{acc}$) from the best fit BEAGLE-AGN model, computing a value of log$_{10}$(M$_{BH}$/M$_{\odot}$) = 7.20$^{+0.04}_{-0.04}$, for an Eddington ratio of $\eta$ = 0.5 (with a systematic uncertainty of $\sim$1 dex). The inferred black hole mass to stellar mass ratio is 0.05$^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$, consistent with other high redshift AGN systems. If the black hole interpretation is confirmed, GHZ2 would represent the most distant black hole identified to date, making it an ideal laboratory to study AGN growth and their role in shaping high-redshift galactic evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 The small-scale turbulent dynamo is a key mechanism for amplifying galactic magnetic fields, yet the resulting field morphology remains poorly understood. Using 3D driven turbulence simulations across a range of compressibilities, characterised by Mach number, and Minkowski functionals, we quantitatively investigate the morphology of magnetic fields generated by the small-scale turbulent dynamo in both the exponentially growing kinematic stage and the statistically steady saturated stage. In both stages and across all Mach numbers, we find that the magnetic field departs significantly from a Gaussian random field. Magnetic structures are statistically less curved and more interconnected in the saturated stage than in the kinematic stage, with these morphological differences decreasing as compressibility increases. Our work provides a quantitative description of how density fluctuations in turbulence and the back-reaction of amplified magnetic fields via the Lorentz force together shape complex, non-Gaussian magnetic structures and offers a valuable framework for comparing simulations with polarisation observations.

 Recent polarimetric observations of blazars indicate the development of current-driven (CD) kink instability after passing the recollimation shocks in the relativistic jets and association with quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs). To investigate multi-wavelength polarized features of CD kink instability in jets, we develop {\tt RaptorP}, a new special relativistic module of the polarized General Relativistic Radiative Transfer (GRRT) code {\tt RAPTOR}. Based on 3D SRMHD simulations of over-pressured magnetized jets, we find that jet images vary at different frequencies. At low frequencies, the emission comes from the turbulent ambient medium surrounding the jet that obscures the inner jet structure. Electronic Vector Position Angle (EVPA) patterns are perpendicular to the jet propagation direction, indicating a dominance of the poloidal magnetic field. At high frequencies, bright knots and twisted kink structures appear, and EVPA patterns are consistent with a toroidal magnetic field. We also find that QPOs in light curves of intensity and linear polarization (degree and angle). The peak frequency in Power Spectral Densities (PSDs) is well-matched with the rotation period of the kink structure in relativistic jets. It shows an anti-correlation between total intensity and the degree of polarization at a lower inclination angle. Our findings, based on realistic polarized radiation calculations, will explain the observational signatures seen in blazars.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive stars play a fundamental role in galactic evolution through their strong stellar winds, chemical enrichment, and feedback mechanisms. Accurate modelling of their atmospheres and winds is critical for understanding their physical properties and evolutionary pathways. Traditional spectroscopic analyses often rely on the $\beta$-law approximation for wind-velocity profiles, which may not capture the complexity of observed phenomena. This study aims to introduce and validate the grId of Stellar atmOSphere and hydrodynamiC modELs for massivE Stars (ISOSCELES), a grid-based framework for the quantitative spectroscopic analysis of massive stars. The project leverages hydrodynamic wind solutions derived from the m-CAK theory, including both fast and $\delta$-slow solutions, to improve the accuracy of derived stellar and wind parameters. We constructed a comprehensive grid of models based on hydrodynamic wind solutions from the Hydwind code and synthetic spectral line profiles generated by the Fastwind code. The grid spans a broad parameter space covering OBA-type stars with solar metallicity. A semi-automatic fitting procedure was developed to analyse key spectral lines and derive the stellar and wind parameters. Applying ISOSCELES to six stars demonstrates its ability to reproduce observed spectral profiles with high fidelity. The $\delta$-slow solution proved effective for two early-type B supergiants. The grid also highlights the difference of using the $\beta$-law in modelling stellar winds compared with the m-CAK wind solutions. The ISOSCELES database represents a step forward in quantitatively analysing massive stars, offering an alternative to the $\beta$-law approximation. Future work will address the inclusion of UV lines and metallicity effects to further refine its applicability across diverse stellar populations.

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce a mock galaxy catalog built for the CSST extragalactic surveys using the primary runs of the Jiutian $N$-body simulation suites. The catalogs are built by coupling the GAlaxy Evolution and Assembly (GAEA) semi-analytical model of galaxy formation with merger trees extracted from the simulations using the Hierarchical Bound-Tracing (HBT+) algorithm. The spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and broadband magnitudes are computed using the neural-network-based stellar population synthesizer StarDuster, which is trained on radiative transfer simulations to account for detailed galaxy geometry in modeling dust obscuration. Galaxy light-cones up to $z=5$ are subsequently generated with the BLiC light-cone builder which interpolates the properties of galaxies over time using an optimized interpolation scheme. The resulting catalogs exhibit good convergence in many statistical properties of the galaxy population produced from two different resolution simulations. The catalogs reproduce a number of observed galaxy properties across a range of galaxy mass and redshift, including the stellar mass functions, the luminosity function, gas mass fraction, galaxy size-mass relation and galaxy clustering. We also present the photometric and redshift distributions of galaxies expected to be observed in the CSST surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 Axion-like particles (ALPs) can couple to photons in strong magnetic fields, producing characteristic fluctuations in X-ray spectra. Using data from NASA's Neutron Star Interior Composition EXplorer (NICER), we analyzed three pulsars, PSR J2229+6114, PSR J1849-0001, and PSR B0531+21, to search for such features. Each spectrum was modeled with a sliding-window power-law fitting method to identify local deviations from the smooth continuum. From these analyses, we derived constraints on the axion-photon coupling constant $g_{a\gamma\gamma}$ within a refined parameter space compared to previous studies, obtaining upper limits in the range $10^{-12}-10^{-14}GeV^{-1}$.

 - **Abstract**
 We present general-relativistic hydrodynamical simulations of inviscid circumbinary discs (CBDs) around near equal-mass binary black holes (BBH) in the binary-disc post-decoupling epoch. We use an approximate BBH spacetime with a post-Newtonian inspiral motion trajectory from ${\sim}80 (M/10^7 \mathrm{M_\odot}) \, \mbox{days}$ (separation of ${\sim}\,30$ gravitational radii) to ${\sim}100 (M/10^7 \mathrm{M_\odot}) \, \mbox{minutes}$ before merger. Initial data for the inspiral runs are produced from circular-orbits runs covering the formation timescale of the overdense {\lq}lump{\rq}, orbiting the CBD inner edge. The CBD non-axisymmetries (spiral waves and lump) lead to non-negligible angular momentum transport with effective viscosity ${\alpha_\mathrm{eff} \, {\sim} \, 10^{-3}{- 2\times 10}^{-2}}$. We post-process these simulations with a general-relativistic ray-tracing code to obtain synthetic observations in thermal emission. We find the lump and its associated electromagnetic (EM) modulation, already reported in the pre-decoupling epoch, to survive post-decoupling up until the end of the simulation. For LISA sources, our findings point to an active EM signature in UV during optimal gravitational wave source localization. For PTA sources and current BBH candidates detected through their optical periodicity: the lump{ in a low-viscosity CBD is a possible, though not unique, origin} for the observed periodicity.
#### The subtle statistics of the distance ladder: On the distance prior and selection effects

 - **Abstract**
 Statistical methodology is rarely considered significant in distance ladder studies or a potential contributor to the Hubble tension. We suggest it should be, highlighting two appreciable issues. First, astronomical distances are inferred latent parameters, requiring a prior. We show that the common assumption of (perhaps implicit) uniform priors on distance moduli biases distances low due to objects being intrinsically uniformly distributed in volume. At fixed measured redshifts, this biases the Hubble constant high. Second, selection effects introduce additional factors in the posterior. These typically counteract the effect of the volume prior to some extent, but depend significantly on the nature of the selection. Typical assumptions place $H_0$ at the top of the plausible range, corresponding to a redshift-selected sample. After a detailed analytic and mock-based study of these effects, we apply them to the CosmicFlows-4 sample, where introducing the distance prior causes an approximately 12~per cent increase in distances and $>8$ km/s/Mpc (55 statistical $\sigma$) decrease in the Hubble constant for the case of volume or magnitude selection. Redshift selection would fully undo this shift and is the more likely scenario, as a phenomenological model shows. We also investigate the SH0ES sample, where the volume-prior effect is modest ($1.6\sigma$) and is likely already accounted for within the SH0ES pipeline. Our work highlights the crucial need to model both the distance prior and selection accurately for robust distance ladders and derived parameters. The latter requires samples with known, homogeneous selection criteria, which should be prioritised in future surveys.
#### Measuring accretion disc properties in the transitional millisecond pulsar PSR J1023+0038 using XMM-Newton, NuSTAR, NICER and Chandra

 - **Abstract**
 Whether the accretion disc in the X-ray high-mode of transitional millisecond pulsars (tMSP) reaches near the neutron star surface by penetrating the magnetosphere is a crucial question with many implications, including for continuous gravitational wave emission from the pulsar. We attempt to answer this question for the tMSP PSR J1023+0038 by segregating high-mode data and performing detailed spectral analysis using the XMM-Newton EPIC-PN+MOS1+MOS2 joint observations, XMM-Newton+NuSTAR joint observations, NICER and Chandra individual observations during different epochs. With the sum of longest exposures ($\sim$202 ksec of high mode data from $\sim$364 ksec of total exposure), we performed a self-consistent spectral analysis and constrain the inner disc radius 16.8 $\pm$ 3.8 km with at least 3$\sigma$ significance. Such a measurement is found consistent with best-fit spectral values of inner disc radius from other observatory like NICER and a joint observations with XMM-Newton and NuSTAR within 3$\sigma$ limits. We also detect a Fe emission line at 6.45 keV, for the first time from a tMSP, in the Chandra spectrum with 99% significance with an upper limit of the inner disc radius of 21 R$_g$, supporting independently the fact that inner disc extends into neutron stars's magnetosphere during high mode. All results from our analysis imply that the accretion disc is significantly present and extended within the corotation radius of the neutron star in PSR J1023+0038 during the X-ray high-mode of the tMSP PSR J1023+0038. The measured range of inner disc radius is fully consistent with an independent analysis by Bhattacharyya (2020), which suggests continuous gravitational wave emission from this neutron star, and the standard model of X-ray pulsations in accreting MSPs.
#### Dark-Matter-Powered Population III Evolution: Lifetimes, Rotation, and Quasi-Homogeneity in massive Stars

 - **Abstract**
 Population III stars supplied the first light and metals in the Universe, setting the pace of re-ionisation and early chemical enrichment. In dense haloes their evolution can be strongly influenced by the energy released when WIMPs annihilate inside the stellar core. We follow the evolution of a \(20\,M_\odot\) Population III model with the \textsc{genec} code, adding a full treatment of spin dependent WIMP capture and annihilation. Tracks are calculated for six halo densities from \(10^{8}\) to \(3\times10^{10}\,\mathrm{GeV\,cm^{-3}}\) and three initial rotation rates between zero and \(0.4\,v/v_{\mathrm{crit}}\). As soon as the capture product reaches \(\rho_\chi\sigma_{\mathrm{SD}}\simeq2\times10^{-28}\,\mathrm{GeV\,cm^{-1}}\), the dark-matter luminosity rivals hydrogen fusion, stretching the main-sequence lifetime from about ten million years to more than a gigayear. The extra time allows meridional circulation to smooth out differential rotation; a star that begins at \(0.4\,v/v_{\mathrm{crit}}\) finishes core hydrogen burning with near solid-body rotation and a helium core almost twice as massive as in the dark-matter-free case. Because the nuclear timescale is longer, chemically homogeneous evolution now sets in at only \(0.2\,v/v_{\mathrm{crit}}\), rather than the \(\gtrsim0.5\,v/v_{\mathrm{crit}}\) required without WIMPs. For a star with \(0.4\,v/v_{\mathrm{crit}}\), the surface hydrogen fraction drops to \(X\!\sim\!0.27\), helium rises to \(Y\!\sim\!0.73\), and primary \(^{14}\mathrm N\) increases by four orders of magnitude at He exhaustion. Moderate rotation combined with plausible dark-matter densities can therefore drive primordial massive stars towards long-lived, quasi-homogeneous evolution with distinctive chemical and spectral signatures.
#### Radiative transfer modeling of the low-mass proto-binary system, IRAS 4A1 and 4A2

 - **Abstract**
 NGC 1333 IRAS4A is a well-studied low-mass sun-like proto-binary system. It has two components, A1 and A2, which are diverse according to their physical and chemical properties. We modeled this hot corino using the RATRAN radiative transfer code and explained different spectral signatures observed towards A1 and A2, specifically for CH3OH and H2CO. Our main goal is to understand the kinematical and chemical differences between A1 and A2 and to classify their dust emission and absorption properties. We considered a simple 1D spherical infalling envelope consisting of collimated outflow in the source. Recent high-resolution interferometric observations of ALMA shed new light on why the same molecular transitions towards A1 and A2 show different spectral profiles. The significant difference between spectral profiles observed towards A1 and A2 is mainly due to the dust opacity effect. Dust continuum emission toward A1 is optically thick, causing the transitions observed in absorption. Meanwhile, A2 is optically thin, leading to the observed emission profiles, and an inverse P-Cygni profile suggests the presence of an infalling envelope. Using high-resolution observations from ALMA and VLA, we expanded our model from the millimeter wavelength range to the centimeter wavelength range. This expansion demonstrates the opacity effect, which is reduced in the centimeter wavelength range, causing us to observe the lines in emission. Using our model, we reproduced the population inversion causing maser emission of methanol 44 GHz and 95 GHz transitions.
#### Observed Joys law of Bipolar Magnetic Region tilts at the emergence supports the thin flux tube model

 - **Abstract**
 Bipolar sunspots, or more generally, Bipolar Magnetic Regions, BMRs, are the dynamic magnetic regions that appear on the solar surface and are central to solar activity. One striking feature of these regions is that they are often tilted with respect to the equator, and this tilt increases with the latitude of appearance, popularly known as Joys law. Although this law has been examined for over a century through various observations, its physical origin is still not established. An attractive theory that has been put forward behind Joys law is the Coriolis force acting on the rising flux tube in the convection zone, which has been studied using the thin flux tube model. However, observational support for this theory is limited. If the Coriolis force is the cause of the tilt, then we expect BMRs to hold Joys law at their initial emergence on the surface. By automatically identifying the BMRs over the last two solar cycles from high resolution magnetic observations, we robustly capture their initial emergence signatures on the surface. We find that from their appearance, BMRs exhibit tilts consistent with Joys law. This early tilt signature of BMRs suggests that the tilt is developed underneath the photosphere, driven by the Coriolis force and helical convection, as predicted by the thin flux tube model. Considerable scatter around Joys law observed during the emergence phase, which reduces in the post emergence phase, reflects the interaction of the vigorous turbulent convection with the rising flux tubes in the near surface layer.
#### Broad Iron Line as a Relativistic Reflection from Warm Corona in AGN

 - **Abstract**
 We present that the broad feature usually observed in X-ray spectra can be explained by a ray-traced emission from a two-slab system containing a dissipative, warm corona on top of an accretion disk in an AGN. Such an accretion flow is externally illuminated by X-ray radiation from a lamp located above a central SMBH. Thermal lines from highly ionized iron ions (FeXXV and FeXXVI), caused by both internal heating and reflection from the warm corona, can be integrated into an observed broad line profile due to the close vicinity of the SMBH. We investigate the dependence of the broad line profile by varying the SMBH spin parameter, viewing angle, lamp height, and dissipation factor. Our results introduce a new method to probe properties of the warm corona using high-resolution spectroscopic measurements. We use the photoionization code TITAN to compute local ion populations and emission line profiles, and the ray-tracing code GYOTO to include relativistic effects on the outgoing X-ray spectrum. In our models, the temperature of the inner atmosphere covering the disk can reach values of 10^7 - 10^8 K due to internal warm corona dissipation and external illumination, which is adequate for generating the highly ionized iron lines. These lines can undergo significant gravitational redshift near the black hole, leading to a prominent spectral feature centered around 6.4 keV. For all computed models, the relativistic corrections shift highly ionized iron lines to the X-ray region, usually attributed to fluorescent emission from the illuminated skin of an accretion disk. Hence, in the case of a warm corona covering the inner disk regions, the resulting theoretical line profile under strong gravity is a sum of different iron line transitions, and those originating from highly ionized iron contribute the most to the observed total line profile in AGN.
#### Modelling the Solar Cycle Nonlinearities into the Algebraic Approach

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding and predicting solar-cycle variability requires accounting for nonlinear feedbacks that regulate the buildup of the Sun's polar magnetic field. We present a simplified but physically grounded algebraic approach that models the dipole contribution of active regions (ARs) while incorporating two key nonlinearities: tilt quenching (TQ) and latitude quenching (LQ). Using ensembles of synthetic cycles across the dynamo effectivity range $\lambda_R$, we quantify how these mechanisms suppress the axial dipole and impose self-limiting feedback. Our results show that (i) both TQ and LQ reduce the polar field, and together they generate a clear saturation (ceiling) of dipole growth with increasing cycle amplitude; (ii) the balance between LQ and TQ, expressed as $R(\lambda_R) = \mathrm{dev(LQ)}/\mathrm{dev(TQ)}$, transitions near $\lambda_R \approx 12^\circ$, with LQ dominating at low $\lambda_R$ and TQ at high $\lambda_R$; (iii) over $8^\circ \leq \lambda_R \leq 20^\circ$, the ratio follows a shallow offset power law with exponent $n \approx 0.36 \pm 0.04$, significantly flatter than the $n=2$ scaling assumed in many surface flux--transport (SFT) models; and (iv) symmetric, tilt-asymmetric, and morphology-asymmetric AR prescriptions yield nearly identical $R(\lambda_R)$ curves, indicating weak sensitivity to AR geometry for fixed transport. These findings demonstrate that nonlinear saturation of the solar cycle can be captured efficiently with algebraic formulations, providing a transparent complement to full SFT simulations. The method highlights that the LQ\--TQ balance is primarily controlled by transport ($\lambda_R$), not by active-region configuration, and statistically disfavors the SFT-based $1/\lambda_R^{2}$ dependence.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar Cycle 24 data are used to determine how often the Sun emerges sunspots in `activity nests', i.e., regions where sunspots and active regions (ARs) repeatedly emerge. We use the Solar Photospheric Ephemeral Active Region (SPEAR) catalog created from Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) data as well as the HMI Carrington Rotation maps of radial magnetic field, $B_r$. The Sun shows moderate nesting behavior with 41\% (48\%) of AR magnetic flux found in Northern (Southern) hemispheric nests that are short-lived ($\sim$4 months). Different rotation rates are used to search for nests that may not be evident `by eye'. The maximum number of nests are found with slightly prograde rotational velocities, with significant nest flux also found at synodic 451--452 nHz prograde and 409--411 nHz retrograde frequencies. Nest patterns show strong hemispheric asymmetry, indicating that the physical origin of nests identified herein must also be asymmetric or antisymmetric across the equator.
#### Only Nitrogen-Enhanced Galaxies Have Detectable UV Nitrogen Emission Lines at High Redshift

 - **Abstract**
 The detections of bright UV nitrogen emission lines in some high-redshift galaxies suggest unexpectedly high nitrogen-to-oxygen ratios ($\log(\rm N/O)\gtrsim-1.0$) compared to local values ($\log(\rm N/O)\gtrsim-1.5$) at similar metallicities ($12+\log(\rm O/H)\lesssim8.0$). Although the presence of these `N-enhanced' galaxies indicates signatures of atypical chemical enrichment processes in the early universe, the prevalence of nitrogen enhancement in high-$z$ galaxies is unclear. So far, only $\sim$10 $z>5$ galaxies have nitrogen abundance measurements, and they all suggest elevated N/O ratios. Do all high-redshift galaxies exhibit elevated N/O ratios, or are we simply missing `N-normal' galaxies whose nitrogen abundances follow the local N/O scaling relation? To tackle these questions, we calculate the detection limits of UV NIII] or NIV] lines in current JWST surveys CEERS and JADES, and compare them to predictions from both `N-enhanced' and `N-normal' AGN narrow-line region and H II region photoionization models. We find that CEERS can only detect galaxies with significant nitrogen enhancement ($\log(\rm N/O)\gtrsim-0.4$), while JADES can only detect galaxies with moderately elevated N/O ratios compared to local values ($\log(\rm N/O)\gtrsim-1.0$). Even for the deepest exposure in JADES, UV nitrogen lines produced by `N-normal' galaxies at $z>5$ are too faint and thus not detectable, making their nitrogen abundance unmeasurable. Our results suggest that the existing sample of galaxies with measurable nitrogen abundances at $z\gtrsim5$ is incomplete and biased toward galaxies with significantly elevated N/O ratios. Deep ($t_{\rm exp}\sim40-500\,$hours) spectroscopic surveys will be crucial for building a complete sample to study nitrogen enrichment mechanisms in the early universe.

 - **Abstract**
 A remarkable span of frontier astrophysics, from gravitational-wave archaeology to the origin of the elements to interpreting snapshots of the earliest galaxies, depends sensitively on our understanding of massive star formation and evolution in near-pristine, relatively enriched gas. From the surprisingly massive black holes detected by LIGO/Virgo to highly ionized nebulae with peculiar enrichment patterns observed in galaxies at Cosmic Dawn, evidence is mounting that our understanding of massive-star populations at very low metallicity remains critically incomplete. The fundamental limitation is the hand nature has dealt us: only a few star-forming galaxies within $\lesssim$1 Mpc can currently be resolved into individual stars, and none reach the extreme metallicities and star-formation intensities that characterized the early Universe. With an ultraviolet integral-field spectrograph aboard the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), this barrier will finally be broken. HWO will bring rare, actively star-forming, extremely metal-poor dwarf galaxies at $\sim$10-20 Mpc such as I Zw 18 within reach of resolved UV-optical spectroscopy, providing our first direct, statistical view of individual massive stars and the feedback they drive at $>$30 $M_\odot$ and $<$10% $Z_\odot$. This science is deeply synergistic with many next-generation facilities, yet requires the unique combination of spatial resolution and UV/optical sensitivity that only HWO can provide. The massive star science enabled by HWO within the Local Volume represents a transformational advance in our ability to probe the earliest stellar populations - those that seeded the Milky Way and other galaxies with the first heavy elements, and paved the way for life in the transparent, reionized Universe we inhabit today.
