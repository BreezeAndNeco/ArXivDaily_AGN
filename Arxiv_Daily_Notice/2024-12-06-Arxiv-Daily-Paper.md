#### Tracing cosmic gas in filaments and halos: Low-redshift insights from the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we leverage CMB data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and LSS data from the imaging survey conducted by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) to study the distribution of gas around galaxy groups at low redshift, $z \approx 0.3$, via the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect. In particular, we perform velocity-weighted stacking on the photometric Bright Galaxy Sample (BGS) to isolate the monopole and quadrupole of the kSZ signal, orienting the stacked images along 2D filaments identified using the Hessian of the projected gravitational potential. We find a 7.2$\sigma$ detection in the monopole of the signal (i.e., the gas density profile) and a 4$\sigma$ detection in the quadrupole ($m = 2$), constituting the first measurement of the alignment between gas distribution and the cosmic web through the kSZ effect. As it is a linear probe of the local gas density, the kSZ has heightened sensitivity to the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM), which is believed to house the majority of the ``missing baryons.'' Mapping out the gas density at low redshifts, as enabled by our measurements, is crucial for weak lensing surveys, for which the impact of baryons on small scales is a major impediment. We compare the anisotropic signal against two hydrodynamical simulations, TNG300-1 and Illustris, which have very different baryonic feedback prescriptions. We find that the anisotropic signal measured in the data is comparable but slightly larger and more extended compared with the simulations. This suggests that there is excess accretion and feedback taking place through the filaments, hinting at the possible presence of spin-filament alignment of the BGS objects.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy-cluster virial (structure-formation accretion) shock observations are shown to imply $\gtrsim1\%$ magnetization of a layer extending $\gtrsim10^{16}$ Debye lengths downstream, challenging the modelling of high Alfvén-Mach collisionless shocks. Unlike similar shocks in supernova remnants or relativistic shocks in $\gamma$-ray burst afterglows, where macroscopic magnetized layers were detected but purportedly attributed to preexisting or non-resonant cosmic-ray streaming-seeded substructure, the upstream of strong virial shocks is both weakly magnetized and pristine. Hence, some mechanism must generate large-scale and possibly self-similar magnetic sub-structure out of the accreted primordial plasma; such a mechanism may dominate other high-Mach shock systems, too.

 - **Abstract**
 Intermittent magnetic structures are a plausible candidate for explaining cosmic-ray (CR) diffusion rates derived from observed CR energy spectra. Independently, studies of extreme scattering events (ESEs) of radio quasars and pulsar scintillation have hinted that very straight, large-aspect-ratio, magnetic current sheets may be responsible for the localized large scattering of radio waves. The required shortest axis of the typical structures producing ESEs is of the same scale ($\sim$AU) as the gyroradii of $\sim$GeV CRs. In this paper, we propose that the same magnetic/density sheets can produce large scattering of both CRs and radio waves. We demonstrate that the geometry and volume filling factor of the sheets derived from quasar ESEs can explain the observed mean free path of GeV CRs without introducing free parameters. The model places constraints on the sheet geometry, such as straightness and large aspect ratio, and assumes the statistics of the sheets are similar throughout the Galactic volume. We, therefore, discuss observational tests of the sheet model, which includes observations of echoes in pulsars and fast radio bursts, gravitationally lensed quasars, the distribution of ESE durations, and spatial correlations between ESE events and rotation-measure fluctuations. Such tests will be enabled by upcoming wide-field radio instruments, including Canadian Hydrogen Observatory and Radio-transient Detector (CHORD) and Deep Synoptic Array 2000 Antennas (DSA-2000).

 - **Abstract**
 The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations enable the exploration of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with broad-line emission in the early universe. Despite their clear radiative and morphological signatures of AGNs in rest-frame optical bands, complementary evidence of AGN activity -- such as X-ray emission and UV/optical variability -- remains rarely detected. The weakness of X-rays and variability in these broad-line emitters challenges the conventional AGN paradigm, indicating that the accretion processes or environments around the central black holes (BHs) differ from those of low-redshift counterparts. In this work, we study the radiation spectra of super-Eddington accretion disks enveloped by high-density coronae. Radiation-driven outflows from the disk transport mass to the poles, resulting in moderately optically-thick, warm coronae formed through effective inverse Comptonization. This mechanism leads to softer X-ray spectra and larger bolometric correction factors for X-rays compared to typical AGNs, while being consistent with those of JWST AGNs and low-redshift super-Eddington accreting AGNs. In this scenario, UV/optical variability is suppressed due to photon trapping within super-Eddington disks, while X-ray emissions remain weak yet exhibit significant relative variability. These characteristics are particularly evident in high-redshift AGNs powered by lower-mass BHs with $\lesssim 10^{7-8}~M_\odot$, which undergo rapid mass accretion following overmassive evolutionary tracks relative to the BH-to-stellar mass correlation in the local universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Hydrogen-deficient Carbon (HdC) stars are a class of supergiants with anomalous chemical compositions, suggesting that they are remnants of CO-He white dwarf (WD) mergers. This class comprises two spectroscopically similar subclasses - dusty R Coronae Borealis (RCB) and dustless Hydrogen-deficient Carbon (dLHdC) stars. Both subclasses have a stark overabundance of $^{18}\textrm{O}$ in their atmospheres, but spectroscopic differences between them remain poorly studied. We present high-resolution ($R \approx 75000$) K-band spectra of six RCB and six dLHdC stars, including four newly discovered dLHdC stars, making this the largest sample to date. We develop a semi-automated fitting routine to measure $^{16}\textrm{O}/^{18}\textrm{O}$ ratios for this sample, tripling the number of dLHdC stars with oxygen isotope ratios measured from high resolution spectra. All six dLHdC stars have $^{16}\textrm{O}/^{18}\textrm{O}<1$, while the RCB stars have $^{16}\textrm{O}/^{18}\textrm{O}>4$. Additionally, for the first time, we find a trend of decreasing $^{16}\textrm{O}/^{18}\textrm{O}$ ratios with increasing effective temperature for HdC stars, consistent with predictions of theoretical WD merger models. However, we note that current models overpredict the low $^{16}\textrm{O}/^{18}\textrm{O}$ ratios of dLHdC stars by two orders of magnitude. We also measure abundances of C, N, O, Fe, S, Si, Mg, Na, and Ca for these stars. We observe a correlation between the abundances of $^{14}\textrm{N}$ and $^{18}\textrm{O}$ in our sample, suggesting that a fixed fraction of the $^{14}\textrm{N}$ is converted to $^{18}\textrm{O}$ in these stars via $\alpha$-capture. Our results affirm the emerging picture that the mass ratio/total mass of the WD binary determine whether an RCB or dLHdC is formed post-merger.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed reanalysis of the atmospheric properties of WASP-19b, an ultra-hot Jupiter (1.14 M Jup, 1.41 R Jup) orbiting an active Sun-like star every 0.79 day. We reanalyze a transit and secondary eclipse of WASP-19b observed by the Hubble Space Telescope's Wide Field Camera 3 spectrograph (1.1 - 1.7 microns). When combined with Spitzer photometry at longer wavelengths, our analyses indicate the presence of water absorption features in both the planet's transmission and emission spectra, consistent with results from previously published studies. We jointly fit WASP-19b's dayside emission and transmission spectra with a retrieval model in order to constrain its atmospheric composition, and explore the effect of stellar activity on its transmission spectrum in greater depth. We also compare our dayside emission spectrum to predictions from a general circulation model, and conclude that magnetic drag appears to be relatively unimportant in shaping WASP-19b's atmospheric circulation. Lastly, we compare the size of WASP-19b's dayside water absorption feature to the population of hot Jupiters with similar measurements, and show that it is located in the transitional irradiation regime where temperature inversions first begin to emerge. As in previous studies, we find that the current observations provide relatively weak constraints on this planet's atmospheric properties. These constraints could be significantly improved by the addition of spectroscopically resolved observations at longer wavelengths with JWST/NIRSpec PRISM.

 - **Abstract**
 Multiphase gas, with hot ($\sim10^6$K) and cold ($\sim10^4$K) gas, is ubiquitous in astrophysical media across a wide range of scales. However, simulating multiphase gas has been a long-standing challenge, due to the large separation between the size of cold gas structures and the scales at which such gas impacts the evolution of associated systems. In this study, we introduce a new subgrid framework for such multiphase gas, MOGLI: Model for Multiphase Gas using Multifluid hydrodynamics, in multifluid AREPO. We develop this approach based on first principles and theoretical results from previous studies with resolved small-scale simulations, leading to a minimal number of free parameters in the formulation. We divide the interactions in the model into three sources: drag, turbulent mixing and cold gas growth. As part of the model, we also include two methods for estimating the local turbulent velocities, one using the Kolmogorov scaling, and the other using the local velocity gradients. We verify the different components of the framework through extensive comparison with benchmark single-fluid simulations across different simulation parameters, such as how resolved the cold gas is initially, the turbulent Mach number, spatial resolution, and random initialisation of turbulence. We test the complete scheme and a reduced version, with and without cold gas growth. We find a very good qualitative and quantitative agreement across the different simulation parameters and diagnostics for both local turbulent velocity estimation methods. We also reproduce behaviour like the cold gas survival criteria as an emergent property. We discuss the applications and possible extensions of MOGLI and demonstrate its capability by running a simulation which would be computationally prohibitive to run as a resolved single-fluid simulation.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy formation theory identifies superwinds as a key regulator of star formation rates, galaxy growth, and chemical enrichment. Thermal and radiation pressure are known to drive galactic-scale winds in dusty starbursting galaxies (e.g. M82), but modern numerical simulations have recently highlighted that cosmic-ray (CR) driven winds may be especially important in normal galaxies with modest star formation rate surface densities. However, CR-driven winds have yet to be conclusively observed -- leaving significant uncertainty in their detailed microphysics. We present MeerKAT radio continuum and HI spectral-line observations of one such normal galaxy, NGC 1532; a nearby ($D\sim15\,\mathrm{Mpc}$) and edge-on ($i \gtrsim 80^{\circ}$) spiral galaxy tidally interacting with its smaller elliptical companion, NGC 1531. We find magnetized, highly-ordered radio continuum loops extending $\sim10$ kpc above and below the disk; visibly connecting discrete star-forming regions in the disk with the nucleus. The deep MeerKAT HI observations place an upper limit on the column density of neutral gas coincident with the outflow to $N_\mathrm{HI} \lesssim 3 \times 10^{19}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$. Unlike previously observed outflows -- for which ejected gas and dust can be traced across multiple wavelengths -- the loops in NGC 1532 show no detectable signs of dust or gas coincident with the radio emission far from the disk. We explore multiple possible mechanisms for driving this magnetic wind and favor an explanation where cosmic-ray pressure plays a significant role in launching these outflows.
#### Photospheric Swirls in a Quiet-Sun Region

 - **Abstract**
 Swirl-shaped flow structures have been observed throughout the solar atmosphere, in both emission and absorption, at different altitudes and locations, and are believed to be associated with magnetic structures. However, the distribution patterns of such swirls, especially their spatial positions, remain unclear. Using the Automated Swirl Detection Algorithm (ASDA), we identified swirls from the high-resolution photospheric observations, centered on Fe I 630.25 nm, of a quiet region near the Sun's central meridian by the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope. Through a detailed study of the locations of the detected small-scale swirls with an average radius of $\sim$300 km, we found that most of them are located in lanes between mesogranules (which have an average diameter of $\sim$5.4 Mm) instead of the commonly believed intergranular lanes. The squared rotation, expansion/contraction, vector speeds, and proxy kinetic energy are all found to follow Gaussian distributions. Their rotation speed, expansion/contraction speed, and circulation are positively correlated with their radius. These results suggest that photospheric swirls at different scales and locations across the observational 56.5" $\times$ 57.5" field-of-view (FOV) could share the same triggering mechanism at preferred spatial and energy scales. A comparison with previous work suggests that the number of photospheric swirls is positively correlated with the number of local magnetic concentrations, stressing the close relation between swirls and local magnetic concentrations:the number of swirls should positively correlate with the number and strength of local magnetic concentrations.

 - **Abstract**
 We search for transient gamma-ray emission in the energy range from 0.1-300 GeV using data from the Fermi-LAT telescope in coincidence with magnetar flares. For our analysis we look for coincidence with 15 distinct flares from 11 magnetars using two distinct time windows of $\pm$ 1 day and $\pm$ 15 days. For 14 of these flares from 10 magnetars, we do not see any statistically significant gamma-ray emission. However, we see two gamma-ray flares from one magnetar, namely 1E 1048.1-5937, with combined significance of $5\sigma$, observed after about 10 days from the peak of the X-ray flare. However, this magnetar is located close to the galactic plane (with galactic latitude of -0.52\degree) and this signal could be caused by contamination due to diffuse flux from gamma-ray sources in the galactic plane.

 - **Abstract**
 $\beta$ Cephei pulsating variable (BCEP) stars are the most massive pulsating variable stars in the main sequence, exhibiting both p- and g-mode pulsations. In this study, we identified 155 BCEP stars or candidates using data from TESS and Gaia, of which 83 were first confirmed as BCEP stars. They have visual magnitudes ranging from 8 to 12 mag and effective temperatures between approximately 20,000 and 30,000 K, while the parallaxes of most targets are between 0.2 and 0.6 mas. The study indicates that these BCEP stars have pulsation periods ranging from 0.06 to 0.31 days, with amplitudes ranging from 0.1 to 55.8 mmag in the TESS band. Additionally, the number of BCEP stars increases as the pulsation amplitude decreases. These targets align with the distribution region of BCEP stars in the luminosity-period (L-P) and temperature-period (T-P) diagrams. We have updated the L-P relation of BCEP stars. The Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) diagram indicates that these targets are in the main-sequence evolutionary phase, with masses ranging from 7 to 20 $M_{\odot}$ and luminosities between 2800 and 71,000 $L_{\odot}$. They are almost in the theoretical instability region of BCEP stars but as previously reported, this region at the low-mass end (red) is not filled. The distribution of the pulsation constant indicates that the dominant pulsation periods of BCEP stars consist mainly of low-order p-mode pulsations with a high proportion of radial fundamental modes. These BCEP stars are excellent objects for enhancing our understanding of the structure and evolution of massive stars through asteroseismology.

 - **Abstract**
 Our peculiar velocity imprints a dipole on galaxy density maps derived from redshift surveys. The dipole gives rise to an oscillatory signal in the multipole moments of the observed power spectrum which we indicate as the finger-of-the-observer (FOTO) effect. Using a suite of large mock catalogues mimicking ongoing and future $\textrm{H}\alpha$- and $\textrm{H}\scriptstyle\mathrm{I}$-selected surveys, we demonstrate that the oscillatory features can be measured with a signal-to-noise ratio of up to 7 (depending on the sky area coverage and provided that observational systematics are kept under control on large scales). We also show that the FOTO effect cannot be erased by correcting the individual galaxy redshifts. On the contrary, by leveraging the power of the redshift corrections, we propose a novel method to determine both the magnitude and the direction of our peculiar velocity. After applying this technique to our mock catalogues, we conclude that it can be used to either test the kinematic interpretation of the temperature dipole in the cosmic microwave background or to extract cosmological information such as the matter density parameter and the equation of state of dark energy.
#### First Measurements of the 4-Point Correlation Function of Magnetohydrodynamic Turbulence as a Novel Probe of the Interstellar Medium

 - **Abstract**
 In the Interstellar Medium (ISM), gas and dust evolve under magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence. This produces dense, non-linear structures that then seed star formation. Observationally and theoretically, turbulence is quantified by summary statistics such as the 2-Point Correlation Function (2PCF) or its Fourier-space analog the power spectrum. These cannot capture the non-Gaussian correlations coming from turbulence's highly non-linear nature. We here for the first time apply the 4-Point Correlation Function (4PCF) to turbulence, measuring it on a large suite of MHD simulations that mirror, as well as currently possible, the conditions expected in the ISM. The 4PCF captures the dependence of correlations between quadruplets of density points on the geometry of the tetrahedron they form. Using a novel functionality added to the \textsc{sarabande} code specifically for this work, we isolate the purely non-Gaussian piece of the 4PCF. We then explore simulations with a range of pressures, $P$, and magnetic fields, $B$ (but without self-gravity); these are quantified by different sonic $(M_{\rm S})$ and Alfvénic $(M_{\rm A})$ Mach numbers. We show that the 4PCF has rich behavior that can in future be used as a diagnostic of ISM conditions. We also show that a large-scale coherent magnetic field leads to parity-odd modes of the 4PCF, a clean test of magnetic field coherence with observational ramifications. All our measurements of the 4PCF (10 $M_{\rm S}, M_{\rm A}$ combinations, 9 time-slices for each, 34 4PCF modes for each) are made public for the community to explore.
#### Jets are the most robust observable ingredient of common envelope evolution

 - **Abstract**
 I examine images of 50 planetary nebulae (PNe) with observable post-common envelope evolution (CEE) binary central stars and find that jets are about 40 percent more common than dense equatorial outflows. Because, in some cases, energetic jets can compress an equatorial outflow and because fast jets might disperse early in the PN evolution and avoid detection, the CEE process is likelier to launch jets than to eject a dense equatorial outflow by a larger factor than 1.4. In most cases, the companion, mainly a main sequence star, launches the jets as it accretes mass from the envelope of the giant star. By CEE jets, I also refer to jets launched shortly before the onset of the CEE, likely a grazing envelope evolution phase, and shortly after the CEE. The jets and the accretion of mass by the companion before, during, and after the CEE affect envelope mass removal and the final orbital separation. Most numerical simulations of the CEE ignore jets, and those that include jets omit other processes. Despite the considerable progress in the last decade with tens of hydrodynamical simulations of the CEE, we are still far from correctly simulating the CEE. Including jets in simulations of the CEE requires heavy computer resources, but it must be the next step.
#### Atmospheric molecular blobs shape up circumstellar envelopes of AGB stars

 - **Abstract**
 During their thermally pulsing phase, Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars eject material that forms extended dusty envelopes. Visible polarimetric imaging found clumpy dust clouds within two stellar radii of several oxygen-rich stars. Inhomogeneous molecular gas has also been observed in multiple emission lines within several stellar radii of different oxygen rich stars, including W Hya and Mira. At the stellar surface level, infrared images have revealed intricate structures around the carbon semi-regular variable R Scl and in the S-type star $\pi^{\mathrm{1}}$ Gru. Infrared images have also shown clumpy dust structures within a few stellar radii of the prototypical carbon AGB star IRC+10216, and studies of the molecular gas distribution beyond the dust formation zone have also shown complex circumstellar structures. Because of the lack of sufficient spatial resolution, however, the distribution of molecular gas in the stellar atmosphere and the dust formation zone of AGB carbon stars is not known, nor is how it is subsequently expelled. Here we report observations with a resolution of one stellar radius of the recently formed dust and molecular gas in the atmosphere of IRC+10216. Lines of HCN, SiS, and SiC$_2$ appear at different radii and in different clumps, which we interpret as large convective cells in the photosphere, as seen in Betelgeuse. The convective cells coalesce with pulsation causing anisotropies that, together with companions, shape its circumstellar envelope.
#### The puzzling long GRB 191019A: Evidence for Kilonova Light

 - **Abstract**
 GRB 191019A was a long Gamma-ray burst (GRB) lasting about 65 s and, as such, originally thought to be linked to a core-collapse supernova. However, even though follow-up observations identified the optical counterpart close to the bright nucleus of a nearby ancient galaxy (z=0.248), no associated supernova was found. This led to the suggestion that the burst was caused by the merger of two compact stellar objects, likely in a dense circumnuclear environment. By using a recently developed diagnostic tool based on prompt emission temporal properties, we noticed that GRB 191019A falls among those long GRBs which are associated with compact mergers and with evidence of kilonova light. We thus re-analyzed unpublished GROND multi-color (g'r'i'z'JHK_s) data obtained between 0.4 and 15 days post trigger. Image subtraction confirmed the optical counterpart in all four optical bands, with GROND tracking its fading until 1.5 days post-burst. Incorporating publicly available Swift-XRT data, a joint fit of an afterglow plus a kilonova model revealed a better match than an afterglow-only scenario. The resulting kilonova properties resemble those of AT2017gfo associated with the binary neutron star merger GW170817, with a total ejected mass of about 0.06 solar mass. Contrary to previous findings inferring a high-density circumburst environment (n0=10^7-10^8 cm^-3), our analysis finds standard conditions (n0 = 1 cm^-3), suggesting the long duration of GRB 191019A was intrinsic rather than due to jet interaction with a dense external medium.

 - **Abstract**
 The properties of the entire neutron star population can be inferred by modeling their evolution, from birth to the present, through pulsar population synthesis. This involves simulating a mock population, applying observational filters, and comparing the resulting sources to the limited subset of detected pulsars. We specifically focus on the magneto-rotational properties of Galactic isolated neutron stars and provide new insights into the intrinsic radio luminosity law by combining pulsar population synthesis with a simulation-based inference (SBI) technique called truncated sequential neural posterior estimation (TSNPE). We employ TSNPE to train a neural density estimator on simulated pulsar populations to approximate the posterior distribution of the underlying parameters. This technique efficiently explores the parameter space by concentrating on regions that are most likely to match the observed data thus allowing a significant reduction in training dataset size. We demonstrate the efficiency of TSNPE over standard neural posterior estimation (NPE), achieving robust inferences of magneto-rotational parameters consistent with previous studies using only around 4% of the simulations required by NPE approaches. Moreover, for the first time, we incorporate data from the Thousand Pulsar Array (TPA) program on MeerKAT, the largest unified sample of neutron stars with consistent fluxes measurement to date, to help constrain the stars' intrinsic radio luminosity. We find that adding flux information as an input to the neural network largely improves the constraints on the pulsars' radio luminosity, as well as improving the estimates on other input parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, optical observations of the nova V5584 Sgr are presented. These observations cover different phases including pre-maximum, early decline, and nebular. The spectra are dominated by hydrogen Balmer, Fe II, and O I lines with P-Cygni profiles in the early phase, which are subsequently observed in complete emission. The presence of numerous Fe II lines and low ejecta velocity aligns with the Fe II type nova classification. From optical and NIR colors it is clear that this nova manifests dust formation in the ejecta. The dust temperature and mass were estimated from a spectral energy distribution (SED) fit to the JHK band magnitudes and the WISE data. Light curve analysis shows t$_2$ and t$_3$ values of $\sim$ 26 and $\sim$ 48 days, classifying the nova as moderately fast. The physical and chemical properties during early decline and later phases were evaluated using the photoionization code CLOUDY. The best-fit model parameters from two epochs of multiwavelength spectra are compatible with a hot white dwarf source with a roughly constant luminosity of $\sim$ (2.08 $\pm$ 0.10) $\times$ 10$^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$. We find an ejected mass of $\sim$ (1.59 $\pm$ 0.04) $\times$ 10$^{-4}$M$_{\odot}$. Abundance analysis indicates that the ejecta is significantly enriched relative to solar values, with O/H = 30.2, C/H = 10.8, He/H = 1.8, Mg/H = 1.68, Na/H = 1.55, and N/H = 45.5 in the early decline phase, and O/H = 4.5, Ne/H = 1.5, and N/H = 24.5 in the nebular phase.

 - **Abstract**
 The Main Belt asteroid (203) Pompeja shows evidence of extreme variability in visible and near-infrared spectral slope with time. The observed spectral variability has been hypothesized to be attributed to spatial variations across Pompeja's surface. In this scenario, the observed spectrum of Pompeja is dependent on the geometry of the Sun and the observer relative to the asteroid's spin pole and surface features. Knowledge of the rotational spin pole and shape can be gleaned from light curves and photometric measurements. However, dense light curves of Pompeja are only available from two apparitions. Further, previous estimates of Pompeja's sidereal period are close to being Earth-commensurate, making ground-based light curves difficult to obtain. To overcome these difficulties, we implement a pipeline to extract a dense light curve of Pompeja from cutouts of TESS Full Frame Images. We succeeded in obtaining a dense light curve of Pompeja covering $\sim$22 complete rotations. We measure a synodic period of $P_{syn} =24.092 \pm 0.005$ hours and amplitude of 0.073 $\pm$ 0.002 magnitudes during Pompeja's 2021 apparition in the TESS field of view. We use this light curve to refine models of Pompeja's shape and spin pole orientation, yielding two spin pole solutions with sidereal periods and spin pole ecliptic coordinates of $P_{\mathrm{sid}, 1} = 24.0485 \pm 0.0001$ hours, $\lambda_1 = 132^{\circ}$, $\beta_1 = +41^{\circ}$ and $P_{\mathrm{sid}, 2} = 24.0484 \pm 0.0001$ hours, $\lambda_2 =307^{\circ}$, $\beta_2 =+34^{\circ}$. Finally, we discuss the implications of the derived shape and spin models for spectral variability on Pompeja.

 - **Abstract**
 The dynamics of giant planet magnetospheres is controlled by a complex interplay between their fast rotation, their interaction with the solar wind, and their diverse internal plasma and momentum sources. In the ionosphere, the Hall and Pedersen conductances are two key parameters that regulate the intensity of currents coupling the magnetosphere and the ionosphere, and the rate of angular momentum transfer and power carried by these currents. We perform a comparative study of Hall and Pedersen conductivities and conductances in the four giant planets of our Solar System - Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. We use a generic ionospheric model (restraining the studied ions to H3+, CH5+, and meteoric ions) to study the dependence of conductances on the structure and composition of these planets' upper atmospheres and on the main ionization sources (photoionization, ionization by precipitating electrons, and meteoroid ablation). After checking that our model reproduces the conclusions of Nakamura et al. (2022, this https URL) at Jupiter, i.e. the contribution of meteoric ions to the height-integrated conductances is non-negligible, we show that this contribution could also be non-negligible at Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, compared with ionization processes caused by precipitating electrons of energies lower than a few keV (typical energies on these planets). However, because of their weaker magnetic field, the conductive layer of these planets is higher than the layer where meteoric ions are mainly produced, limiting their role in magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the radio emission of spectroscopically confirmed, X-ray weak, Broad Line AGN (BLAGN, or type 1) selected with JWST in the GOODS-N field, one of the fields with the best combination of deep radio observations and statistics of JWST-selected BLAGN. We use deep radio data at different frequencies (144\,MHz, 1.5\,GHz, 3\,GHz, 5.5\,GHz, 10\,GHz), and we find that none of the 22 sources investigated is detected at any of the aforementioned frequencies. Similarly, the radio stacking analysis does not reveal any detection down to an rms of $\sim 0.2\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$, corresponding to a $3\sigma$ upper limit at rest frame 5 GHz of $L_{5GHz}=2\times10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at the mean redshift of the sample $z\sim 5.2$. We compared this and individual sources upper limits with expected radio luminosities estimated assuming different AGN scaling relations. For most of the sources the radio luminosity upper limits are still compatible with expectations for radio-quiet (RQ) AGN; nevertheless, the more stringent stacking upper limits and the fact that no detection is found would suggest that JWST-selected BLAGN are weaker than standard AGN even at radio frequencies. We discuss some scenarios that could explain the possible radio weakness, such as free-free absorption from a dense medium, or the lack of either magnetic field or a corona, possibly as a consequence of super-Eddington accretion. These scenarios would also explain the observed X-ray weakness. We also conclude that $\sim$1 dex more sensitive radio observations are needed to better constrain the level of radio emission (or lack thereof) for the bulk of these sources. The Square Kilometer Array Observatory (SKAO) will likely play a crucial role in assessing the properties of this AGN population.
#### Investigating the Efficacy of Topologically Derived Time-Series for Flare Forecasting. I. Dataset Preparation

 - **Abstract**
 The accurate forecasting of solar flares is considered a key goal within the solar physics and space weather communities. There is significant potential for flare prediction to be improved by incorporating topological fluxes of magnetogram datasets, without the need to invoke three-dimensional magnetic field extrapolations. Topological quantities such as magnetic helicity and magnetic winding have shown significant potential towards this aim, and provide spatio-temporal information about the complexity of active region magnetic fields. This study develops time-series that are derived from the spatial fluxes of helicity and winding that show significant potential for solar flare prediction. It is demonstrated that time-series signals, which correlate with flare onset times, also exhibit clear spatial correlations with eruptive activity; establishing a potential causal relationship. A significant database of helicity and winding fluxes and associated time series across 144 active regions is generated using SHARP data processed with the ARTop code that forms the basis of the time-series and spatial investigations conducted here. We find that a number of time-series in this dataset often exhibit extremal signals that occur 1-8 hours before a flare. This, publicly available, living dataset will allow users to incorporate these data into their own flare prediction algorithms.
#### Journey to the center of the common envelope evolution. Inner dynamics of the post-dynamical inspiral

 - **Abstract**
 Three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of common envelope evolution are often terminated soon after the initial dynamical plunge of the companion transitions into a long-lasting post-dynamical inspiral with slowly varying semi-major axis, $a_\text{b}$. This premature termination is often due to insufficient numerical resolution and challenges associated with the softening of the gravitational potential of the two cores. In this work, we use statically-refined 3D hydrodynamical simulations to study binaries orbiting inside a common envelope, exploring the effects of varying numerical resolution, $\delta$, gravitational potential softening prescriptions, and the associated softening lengthscale, $\epsilon$. We find that quantities such as the binary inspiral timescale or the volume-averaged shearing rate typically converge to asymptotic values only for $\epsilon \le 0.1 a_\text{b}$ and $\delta \le 6 \times 10^{-3}a_\text{b}$ with smaller $\epsilon$ requiring correspondingly smaller $\delta$. After a few tens of binary orbits, the two cores become surrounded by a corotating, nearly hydrostatic gas structure, resembling the shared envelope of a contact binary. We propose that this structure is responsible for the slowing down of the dynamical inspiral, leading to an asymptotic inspiral timescale of approximately $10^5$ orbital periods for a binary mass ratio $q=1/3$, and approximately $10^6$ orbital periods for a binary mass ratio $q=1$. By investigating kinetic helicity, we argue that the magnetic field is unlikely to organize into large-scale structures via the usual $\alpha$--effect during the post-dynamical phase. Even in the absence of magnetic fields, we observe intermittent polar outflows collimated by partially centrifugally evacuated polar funnels. (abridged)

 - **Abstract**
 Hot dust-obscured galaxies (Hot DOGs), are a family of hyper-luminous, heavily obscured quasars. A number of studies have shown that these objects reside in significantly overdense regions of the Universe based on the identification of companions at optical through far-IR wavelengths. Here we present further characterization of their environments by studying the surface density of Lyman break galaxy (LBG) candidates in the vicinity of three Hot DOGs. For two of them, WISE J041010.60-091305.2 at z=3.631 and WISE J083153.25+014010.8 at z=3.912, we identify the candidate LBG companions using deep observations obtained with Baade/IMACS. For the third, WISE J224607.56-052634.9 at z=4.601, we re-analyse previously published data obtained with Gemini-S/GMOS-S. We optimise the LBG photometric selection criteria at the redshift of each target using the COSMOS2020 catalog. When comparing the density of LBG candidates found in the vicinity of these Hot DOGs with that in the COSMOS2020 catalog, we find overdensities of $\delta=1.83\pm 0.08$ ($\delta' = 7.49\pm 0.68$), $\delta=4.67\pm 0.21$ ($\delta' = 29.17\pm 2.21$), and $\delta = 2.36\pm 0.25$ ($\delta' = 11.60\pm 1.96$) around W0410-0913, W0831+0140, and W2246-0526, respectively, without (with) contamination correction. Additionally, we find that the overdensities are centrally concentrated around each Hot DOG. Our analysis also reveals that the overdensity of the fields surrounding W0410-0913 and W0831+0140 declines steeply beyond physical scales of $\sim$2 Mpc. If these overdensities evolve to clusters by z=0, these results suggest that the Hot DOG may correspond to the early formation stages of the brightest cluster galaxy. We were unable to determine if this is also the case for W2246-0526 due to the smaller field of view of the GMOS-S observations. Our results imply that Hot DOGs may be excellent tracers of protoclusters.

 - **Abstract**
 The next generation of galaxy surveys has the potential to substantially deepen our understanding of the Universe. This potential hinges on our ability to rigorously address systematic uncertainties. Until now, diagnosing systematic effects prior to inferring cosmological parameters has been out of reach in field-based implicit likelihood cosmological inference frameworks. As a solution, we aim to diagnose a variety of systematic effects in galaxy surveys prior to inferring cosmological parameters, using the inferred initial matter power spectrum. Our approach is built upon a two-step framework. First, we employ the Simulator Expansion for Likelihood-Free Inference (SELFI) algorithm to infer the initial matter power spectrum, which we utilise to thoroughly investigate the impact of systematic effects. This investigation relies on a single set of N-body simulations. Second, we obtain a posterior on cosmological parameters via implicit likelihood inference, recycling the simulations from the first step for data compression. For demonstration, we rely on a model of large-scale spectroscopic galaxy surveys that incorporates fully non-linear gravitational evolution and simulates multiple systematic effects encountered in real surveys. We provide a practical guide on how the SELFI posterior can be used to assess the impact of misspecified galaxy bias parameters, selection functions, survey masks, inaccurate redshifts, and approximate gravity models on the inferred initial matter power spectrum. We show that a subtly misspecified model can lead to a bias exceeding $2\sigma$ in the $(\Omega_\mathrm{m},\sigma_8)$ plane, which we are able to detect and avoid prior to inferring the cosmological parameters. This framework has the potential to significantly enhance the robustness of physical information extraction from full-forward models of large-scale galaxy surveys such as DESI, Euclid, and LSST.
