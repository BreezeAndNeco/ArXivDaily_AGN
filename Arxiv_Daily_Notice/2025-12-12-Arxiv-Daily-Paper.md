 - **Abstract**
 The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) is an extreme star formation environment, characterized by higher density, higher turbulence, stronger orbital shear, and stronger magnetic field strength than the Solar neighborhood. Whether classical theories of star formation hold within this extreme environment is still debated. In order to assess the impact of these different conditions on the interstellar medium (ISM) and on star formation, we present radiation MHD arepo simulations of a Milky Way-type galaxy. We set up a high-resolution ($M_{\rm cell}=20$ M$_\odot$) region in a ring around the Solar radius, as well as in the barred region of the Galaxy to have a coherent comparison between the CMZ and the Solar neighborhood. Although the high densities and strong levels of turbulence influence star formation and feedback, we find that a key difference in the regulation of star formation between the two environments comes from the short orbital times and the strong shear present in the CMZ. In particular, we highlight the role of the quick dynamical decoupling of stars and gas that leads to periodic re-embedding events in the early lifetimes of radiating O stars. Young stellar associations get efficiently sheared apart such that the ISM is deprived of the compounding effect of radiation and supernovae in disrupting molecular clouds. This changes dramatically the evolution of giant molecular clouds and how feedback can regulate star formation in the CMZ. Stellar feedback is no longer directly coupled to the molecular cloud from which they formed and no strong and disruptive superbubbles can develop. Instead, the feedback rather acts as a background source of turbulence.

 - **Abstract**
 Estimating the auto power spectrum of cosmological tracers from line-intensity mapping (LIM) data is often limited by instrumental noise, residual foregrounds, and systematics. Cross-power spectra between multiple lines offer a robust alternative, mitigating noise bias and systematics. However, inferring the auto spectrum from cross-correlations relies on two key assumptions: that all tracers are linearly biased with respect to the matter density field, and that they are strongly mutually correlated. In this work, we introduce a new diagnostic statistic, \(\mathcal{Q}\), which serves as a data-driven null test of these assumptions. Constructed from combinations of cross-spectra between four distinct spectral lines, \(\mathcal{Q}\) identifies regimes where cross-spectrum-based auto-spectrum reconstruction is unbiased. We validate its behavior using both analytic toy models and simulations of LIM observables, including star formation lines ([CII], [NII], [CI],[OIII]) and the 21-cm signal. We explore a range of redshifts and instrumental configurations, incorporating noise from representative surveys. Our results demonstrate that the criterion \( \mathcal{Q} \approx 1 \) reliably selects the modes where cross-spectrum estimators are valid, while significant deviations are an indicator that the key assumptions have been violated. The \( \mathcal{Q} \) diagnostic thus provides a simple yet powerful data-driven consistency check for multi-tracer LIM analyses.
#### Characterizing the Roman Grism Redshift Efficiency of Type Ia Supernova Host Galaxies for the High-Latitude Time-Domain Survey

 - **Abstract**
 The High-Latitude Time-Domain Survey (HLTDS) for the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (Roman) will discover thousands of high redshift Type Ia supernovae (SNeIa) to make generation-defining cosmological constraints on dark energy. To construct the Roman SN Hubble diagram, a strategy to obtain redshifts must be determined. While the nominal HLTDS will use only the Roman prism, in this work we consider the utility of the Roman grism observations from overlap with the High-Latitude Wide-Area Survey for SNIa cosmology. We determine a galaxy grism redshift recovery rate by simulating dispersed grism images and measuring redshifts with the Grizli software, obtaining an $H$-band 50% redshift recovery at magnitude 20.61 and 90% recovery at magnitude 19.27. To estimate the total number of spectroscopic redshifts expected for Roman SN cosmology, we also consider a Roman prism SN redshift efficiency and a ground-based telescope redshift efficiency for host-galaxies. We apply these redshift efficiencies to SNIa catalog level simulations and predict that $\sim$6800 SNe will have a SN or host spectroscopic redshift. Second, we evaluate the size of potential systematics related to modeling the grism redshift efficiency by considering the impact of additional dependencies on stellar mass and host galaxy color. We estimate the largest potential size of this systematic to be 0.0066$\pm$0.002 and -0.0266$\pm$0.007, roughly 42.9 and 49.6% of the statistical uncertainty for $w_0$ and $w_a$ respectively. Lastly, we consider the effects of assuming different redshift sources on the HLTDS survey strategy optimization by measuring relative changes to the dark energy Figure of Merit.

 - **Abstract**
 The period between z ~ 3-6, a key transformational phase in galaxy evolution preceding `cosmic noon' (z ~ 1-3), is very poorly explored in terms of feedback from AGN acting through gas outflows. In this work, we study the properties of outflows in AGN (mostly X-ray-selected) from the GOODS-S field, exploiting JWST NIRSpec IFU observations as part of the GA-NIFS GTO survey. Together with its twin sub-sample from COSMOS reported in a previous GA-NIFS work, this constitutes the largest spatially resolved sample of AGN outflows at these redshifts to date, comprising 16 targets with outflows (out of a total of 19 AGN), and probes the unexplored regime of AGN at z ~ 3-6 with bolometric luminosities ~$10^{45-46}$ erg/s. We mapped the rest-optical ionised gas emission lines at sub-kpc scales and spectrally isolated the broad wings tracing fast outflows from the gas at rest in the host galaxies. The incidence of ionised outflows in the GOODS-S + COSMOS GA-NIFS sample is high (>75\%), among the highest at any redshift. We inferred outflow velocities between ~600-2000 km/s, maximum radii of <1-4 kpc, and ionised gas mass outflow rates of ~0.1-100 $M_\odot$/yr, which in some cases can exceed the host galaxy star formation rate (SFR). We find that the outflow properties inferred for the GOODS-S + COSMOS GA-NIFS AGN sample and their relations with $L_{\rm bol}$ and SFR generally align with those observed for other spatially resolved literature samples of AGN outflows across different redshifts and AGN luminosities. Nonetheless, after accounting for any luminosity bias, our analysis suggests a cosmic evolution of the outflow properties, with higher median mass outflow rates (and possibly also mass loading factors) at higher redshifts, especially at z>3, indicating that AGN outflows were stronger in the early Universe than at later times, and thus potentially more capable of affecting their host galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 Space-based time-domain telescopes such as CoRoT, Kepler/K2 and TESS have profoundly impacted astrophysics over the past two decades. Continuous light curves with high cadence and high photometric precision are now available for millions of sources within our galaxy and beyond. In addition to revolutionizing exoplanet science, the data have enabled breakthroughs ranging from the solar system to stellar interiors, the transient universe, and active galaxies. The key summary points of this review are: (1) Stellar astrophysics has been transformed by the ability to probe the internal structures of stars, test the physics of stellar convection, connect stellar rotation and magnetic activity, and reveal complex variability in young stars. (2) Ages of stellar populations probe the formation history of our Milky Way, and binary star variability enables the detection of "dark" galactic populations such as solar-mass black holes and neutron stars. (3) Early-time observations of explosive transients provide new insights into the progenitors of supernovae, while the quasi-periodic variability of galaxies probes the physics of accretion processes onto supermassive black holes and the tidal disruption of stars. (4) Observations of solar system objects reveal asteroid compositions through their rotation periods and amplitudes, constrain the cloud structure of ice giants, and allow the discovery of new objects in the outer solar system. (5) Open data policies and software have contributed to remarkable scientific productivity and enabled discoveries by citizen scientists, including new exoplanets and exotic variability in mature Sun-like stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Our survey of the fourth $\mathit{Fermi}$ Large Area Telescope catalog (4FGL) unassociated gamma-ray source regions using the X-Ray Telescope (XRT) and Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope (UVOT) aboard the Neil Gehrels $\mathit{Swift}$ Observatory ($\mathit{Swift}$) provides new XRT and UVOT source detections and localizations to help identify potential low-energy counterparts to unassociated $\mathit{Fermi}$ gamma-ray sources. We present a catalog of 218 singlet and 70 multiplet $\mathit{Swift}$ X-ray sources detected within the positional uncertainty ellipses of 244 unassociated $\mathit{Fermi}$ gamma-ray sources from the 4FGL-DR4 catalog, 144 of which are not previously cataloged by Kerby et al. (2021b). For each X-ray source, we derive its X-ray flux and photon index, then use simultaneous UVOT observations with optical survey data to estimate its $V$-band magnitude. We use these parameters as inputs for a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network classifier (NNC) trained to classify sources as blazars, pulsars, or ambiguous gamma-ray sources. For the 213 singlet sources with X-ray and optical data, we classify 173 as likely blazars ($P_\mathrm{bzr} > 0.99$) and 6 as likely pulsars ($P_\mathrm{bzr} < 0.01$), with 34 sources yielding ambiguous results. Including 70 multiplet X-ray sources, we increase the number of $P_\mathrm{bzr} > 0.99$ to 227 and $P_\mathrm{bzr} < 0.01$ to 16. For the subset of these classifications that have been previously studied, a large majority agree with prior classifications, supporting the validity of using this NNC to classify the unknown and newly detected gamma-ray sources.

 - **Abstract**
 Deuterium fractionation provides a key diagnostic of the physical and chemical evolution of prestellar and protostellar cores, where it is strongly linked to CO depletion in cold, dense gas. We present the first spatially resolved maps of deuterium fraction and CO depletion in the Barnard 5 (B5) region of the Perseus molecular cloud, covering both a starless core and the protostellar core hosting the Class 0/I source IRAS 03445+3242. Using IRAM 30~m observations of N$_2$H$^+$(1--0), N$_2$D$^+$(1--0), H$^{13}$CO$^+$(1--0), and DCO$^+$(2--1), complemented by C$^{18}$O(2--1) data, we derive column density, deuterium fraction, and CO depletion maps. We find that the deuterium fraction in both mentioned nitrogen- and carbon-bearing species increases from the protostellar to the starless core, reaching $R_D^{\rm N_2H^+}=0.43\pm0.10$ and $R_D^{\rm HCO^+}=0.09\pm0.02$ in the starless core, compared with $0.15\pm0.03$ and $0.05\pm0.01$, respectively, in the protostellar core. The CO depletion factor also rises from $4.1\pm0.1$ to $5.0\pm0.1$ across the same transition. While the embedded YSO reduces deuteration in the dense inner gas, the less dense envelope traced by HCO$^+$ is only slightly affected at our resolution. Our analysis confirms that CO freeze-out and the presence of a protostar jointly regulate deuterium chemistry in star-forming regions.

 - **Abstract**
 We report spectral analysis on a 170 ks XRISM \textit{Resolve} exposure of the core of Cygnus A. Analyzing the full field of view spectrum in the $1.7-12.0$ keV band, we find evidence for two-temperature cluster gas. The hotter ($kT = 5.53 \pm 0.13$ keV) gas has a velocity dispersion of $261 \pm 13$ km s$^{-1}$ and a bulk velocity of $120 \pm 20$ km s$^{-1}$ with respect to the central galaxy. The cooler gas ($kT = 2.0^{+0.4}_{-0.3}$ keV) has an even broader velocity dispersion of $440 \pm 130$ km s$^{-1}$, with a systematic uncertainty of $120$ km s$^{-1}$. The relative line-of-sight velocity between the hotter and cooler gas can be as high as $450 \pm 140$ km s$^{-1}$. We interpret the high velocity dispersions as a combination of turbulence and bulk motion due to the cocoon shock. The upper limit on the non-thermal pressure fraction for the hotter gas is $7.7 \pm 0.7\%$. We associate the cooler gas with the central region ($<35$ kpc) and the hotter phase with the gas surrounding it ($35-100$ kpc). The total energy due to the kinetic motion is $5.1 \times 10^{60}$ erg, consistent with the energy associated with the central radio source. The kinetic energy injection rate is $6.9 \times 10^{44}-7.4 \times 10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$ under varying assumptions of injection timescales. The range of injection power is higher than the cooling luminosity, and thus the heating and cooling rates in Cygnus A are unbalanced.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyzed a large sample of SDSS spectra of Seyfert galaxies, subdividing Seyfert 1s based on their narrow-to-broad Halpha components. Comparing their narrow-lines (NL) to Seyfert2s in line-ratio diagrams, most of the NL of strong Sy 1.0 and Sy 1.2s (with dominant broad lines) are the same as those of pure Sy2s. In contrast, only 25-30 percent of the Sy1.8 and Sy1.9 nuclei (with weak broad lines) are located in the pure Sy2 region, with the rest falling in the composite-star-forming region. We explain these Seyfert-plus-star-formation spectra with a simple model. It shows that 85 percent of NL in Sy1.9 are from HII-regions, while 88 percent of the NL in Sy 1.0 arise from the same NLR as in pure Sy2. About 6 percent of the strong and weak Sy1's have NL dominated by LINER emission, while 15 percent of intermediate Seyferts (Sy 1.5 and Sy 1.6) do. To confirm this Seyfert 1 AGN plus star formation combination, we used stellar absorption-lines to compare their stellar populations. Their Hdelta strengths show that LINERs, pure Sy2s, and also the broad-line dominated Sy1s have old stellar populations. The weak Sy 1s show stronger Hdelta absorption, indicating larger proportions of young stars. About one third of the u band light in Sy1.0 and 1.2 is blended Balmer lines and continuum from the BLR. The NL gas reddening increases as the BLR strength decreases, from Sy1.0 (0.13 mag), to Sy1.9 (0.40 mag), to Sy2s and LINERs both with 0.50 mag. Our data do not support the simplest version of Seyfert 1 and 2 unification, where both AGN classes have identical NL.

 - **Abstract**
 We present FEADME (Fast Elliptical Accretion Disk Modeling Engine), a GPU-accelerated Python framework for modeling broad Balmer-line emission using a relativistic elliptical accretion-disk formalism. Leveraging Jax and NumPyro for differentiable forward modeling and efficient Bayesian inference, FEADME enables large-sample, reproducible analyses of disk-dominated emission-line profiles. We apply the framework to 237 double-peaked emitters (DPEs) from the literature and to five tidal disruption events (TDEs) with disk-like H$\alpha$ emission, fitting three physically motivated model families per spectrum and selecting the preferred model using approximate leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation. We find that AGN exhibit a broad, continuous distribution of disk geometries and kinematics, with significant diversity in disk parameters. Most TDE disk parameter distributions are statistically indistinguishable from those of the AGN, with the sole robust difference being that TDE disks are significantly more circular, consistent with rapid debris circularization in tidal disruption events. The majority of both AGN and TDEs favor models that include both a disk and an additional broad-line component, suggesting that disk emission commonly coexists with more isotropic or wind-driven gas. These results indicate that once a line-emitting disk forms, its spectroscopic appearance is governed by similar physical processes in both persistent AGN and transient TDE accretion flows, and they demonstrate the utility of FEADME for population-level studies of disk structure in galactic nuclei.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the discovery of EP250827b/SN 2025wkm, an X-ray Flash (XRF) discovered by the Einstein Probe (EP), accompanied by a broad-line Type Ic supernova (SN Ic-BL) at $z = 0.1194$. EP250827b possesses a prompt X-ray luminosity of $\sim 10^{45} \, \rm{erg \, s^{-1}}$, lasts over 1000 seconds, and has a peak energy $E_{\rm{p}} < 1.5$ keV at 90% confidence. SN 2025wkm possesses a double-peaked light curve (LC), though its bolometric luminosity plateaus after its initial peak for $\sim 20$ days, giving evidence that a central engine is injecting additional energy into the explosion. Its spectrum transitions from a blue to red continuum with clear blueshifted Fe II and Si II broad absorption features, allowing for a SN Ic-BL classification. We do not detect any transient radio emission and rule out the existence of an on-axis, energetic jet $\gtrsim 10^{50}~$erg. In the model we invoke, the collapse gives rise to a long-lived magnetar, potentially surrounded by an accretion disk. Magnetically-driven winds from the magnetar and the disk mix together, and break out with a velocity $\sim 0.35c$ from an extended circumstellar medium with radius $\sim 10^{13}$ cm, generating X-ray breakout emission through free-free processes. The disk outflows and magnetar winds power blackbody emission as they cool, producing the first peak in the SN LC. The spin-down luminosity of the magnetar in combination with the radioactive decay of $^{56}$Ni produces the late-time SN LC. We end by discussing the landscape of XRF-SNe within the context of EP's recent discoveries.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations suggest that Tycho's supernova remnant (SNR; SN 1572) is expanding into a cavity wall of molecular clouds (MCs), which decelerate the SNR and influence its multi-wavelength morphology. To constrain the physical properties of environmental MCs and search for heated gas, we perform a JCMT $^{12}$CO $J$=3--2 observation and compare with previous $^{12}$CO $J$=2--1, $^{12}$CO $J$=1--0 and $^{13}$CO $J$=1--0 data. We present the $^{12}$CO $J$=3--2 map toward Tycho and show that the $^{12}$CO $J$=3--2 spatial distribution and line profiles are similar to those of the lower-$J$ CO lines. By comparing the multiple transitions of CO and the RADEX (Radiative transfer code in non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium) models, we constrain the physical properties of molecular gas surrounding Tycho: the northern cloud has a molecular column density of $N({\rm H}_{2})=0.5$ -- $4.5\times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$, while other regions have $N({\rm H}_{2})=0.2$ -- $3.9\times10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$; the kinetic temperatures $T_{\rm k}$ of these clouds are in the range of 9 -- 22 K and the volume densities $n({\rm H}_{2})$ are 20 -- $700$ cm$^{-3}$. We also discuss the difficulty in finding hot molecular gas shocked by such a young SNR. We estimate that the shocked molecular layer can be as thin as 0.003 pc, corresponding to $0.2''$ at the distance of 2.5 kpc, which is 2 orders of magnitude smaller than the angular resolution of current CO observations. Therefore, our molecular observations are largely insensitive to the thin shocked gas layer; instead, they detect the environmental gas.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio pulses with largely unknown origins, with a subset exhibiting repeating behavior. Magnetars highly magnetized neutron stars and a leading progenitor candidate for FRBs also produce similar but much fainter millisecond radio pulses, suggesting a possible connection between the two phenomena. The irregularity of the time series of repeating FRBs and magnetar pulses may provide insight into the underlying progenitor activity. In this study, we analyze time-series data from three repeating FRB sources (four datasets) and the Galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154 to investigate potential patterns in burst arrival times, energy fluctuations, and peak-frequency shifts. We quantify the degree of randomness (Pincus Index; PI) and chaos (Largest Lyapunov Exponent; LLE) for these three parameters. We find that waiting times across all repeating FRBs exhibit high PI (high randomness) and low LLE (low chaos), consistent with the behavior of magnetar radio pulses. This similarity suggests that both may share a common triggering mechanism. In contrast, the energy fluctuations of both repeating FRBs and magnetar pulses occupy the same region in PI-LLE phase space but display much larger scatter than the other two domains. We discuss the possibility that beaming effects or strong variability in radio-emission efficiency may explain their distinct behavior in the energy domain.

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce the Morph approximation, a class of product approximations of probability densities that selects low-order disjoint parameter blocks by maximizing the sum of their total correlations. We use the posterior approximation via Morph as the importance distribution in optimal bridge sampling. We denote this procedure by MorphZ, which serves as a post-processing estimator of the marginal likelihood. The MorphZ estimator requires only posterior samples together with the prior and likelihood, and is fully agnostic to the choice of sampler. We evaluate MorphZ's performance across statistical benchmarks, pulsar timing array (PTA) models, compact binary coalescence (CBC) gravitational-wave (GW) simulations and the GW150914 event. Across these applications, spanning low to high dimensionalities, MorphZ yields accurate evidence at substantially reduced computational cost relative to standard approaches, and can improve these estimates even when posterior coverage is incomplete. Its bridge sampling relative error diagnostic provides conservative uncertainty estimates. Because MorphZ operates directly on posterior draws, it complements exploration-oriented samplers by enabling fast and reliable evidence estimation, while it can be seamlessly integrated into existing inference workflows.

 - **Abstract**
 Precise stellar parameters for M-type stars, the Galaxy's most common stellar type, are crucial for numerous studies. In this work, we refined the LAMOST DR10 M-type star catalog through a two-stage process. First, we purified the catalog using techniques including deep learning and color-magnitude diagrams to remove 22,496 non-M spectra, correct 2,078 dwarf/giant classifications, and update 12,900 radial velocities. This resulted in a cleaner catalog containing 870,518 M-type spectra (820,493 dwarfs, 50,025 giants). Second, applying a label transfer strategy using values from APOGEE DR16 for parameter prediction with a ten-fold cross-validated CNN ensemble architecture, we predicted $T_\text{eff}$, $\log g$, [M/H], and [$\alpha$/M] separately for M dwarfs and giants. The average internal errors for M dwarfs/giants are respectively: $T_\text{eff}$ 30/17 K, log $g$ 0.07/0.07 dex, [M/H] 0.07/0.05 dex, and [$\alpha$/M] 0.02/0.02 dex. Comparison with APOGEE demonstrates external precisions of 34/14 K, 0.12/0.07 dex, 0.09/0.04 dex, and 0.03/0.02 dex for M dwarfs/giants, which represents precision improvements of over 20\% for M dwarfs and over 50\% for M giants compared to previous literature results.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a Bayesian framework that enhances the identification of strongly lensed gravitational waves (GWs) by incorporating informative positional priors from the Euclid galaxy lens catalog. The core of our method introduces a two-step reweighting scheme: first, gravitational wave parameter estimation is performed under a uniform sky prior; the resulting posterior is then used to reweight galaxy positions within the Euclid catalog, constructing an astrophysically informed positional prior. Comparing this Euclid-informed prior against a uniform prior within our framework reveals distinct behaviors. While the posterior estimates of the intrinsic waveform parameters show little sensitivity to the prior change, the Bayes factor for lensing identification exhibits significant prior dependence. Crucially, for truly lensed event pairs, the Bayes factor systematically increases, whereas for unlensed pairs it decreases. This dual effect is vital for robust discrimination. Our analysis demonstrates that this multi-messenger approach significantly improves the confidence of lensing searches. For lensed pairs, the method boosts the Bayes factor by an average factor of $\sim 10$, while effectively suppressing false positives for unlensed coincidences. This underscores the critical importance of prior specification and showcases the substantial gains achievable by synergizing gravitational-wave data with electromagnetic survey information.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyzed the sizes and star-formation histories (SFHs) of 2908 galaxies with $M_\star \geq 10^9$ M$_\odot$ at $0.6 < z < 1.0$, drawn from the LEGA-C survey. The goal is to investigate the connection between galaxy sizes with SFH, stellar age, and metallicity. SFHs were derived with Prospector by fitting the high signal-to-noise, high spectral resolution spectroscopy drawn from the LEGA-C DR3 together with the broadband photometry from the UltraVISTA catalog. Galaxy sizes were measured by fitting a 2D S{é}rsic profile to the HST ACS~F814W images. We find diverse SFHs and quenching timescales ($\tau_\rm{q}$). The main quiescent population quenched over $\tau_\rm{q}=1.23\pm0.04$ Gyr, whereas compact post-starburst galaxies (PSBs) quenched much faster, $\tau_\rm{q}=0.13\pm0.03$ Gyr. At fixed stellar mass, smaller quiescent galaxies quenched more rapidly than larger ones; at fixed size, the dependence on stellar mass is weak. Larger quiescent galaxies are marginally younger, quenched more slowly, and have near-solar metallicities, while compact quiescent galaxies are older, metal-rich, and quenched faster. PSBs formed half their mass later ($z_\rm{form}\sim1.9$) and quenched on the shortest timescales. The general trends with galaxy size, $Z_\star$, and $z_\rm{form}$ for the quiescent populations remain consistent regardless of the method used to derive the stellar properties. We conclude that compact quiescent galaxies are consistent with both early, moderately fast quenching and with more rapid, late quenching. While this may suggest the existence of multiple quenching channels, our data are also compatible with a continuous distribution of quenching timescales. These findings suggest that different physical mechanisms may drive quenching across galaxy populations, potentially leading to similar morphological outcomes despite differing evolutionary histories.
#### A Systematic Study of Magnetic Fields Impacts on Neutrino Transport in Core-Collapse Supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 We quantify the impact of strong magnetic fields (assuming $B=B_0\cdot r_0^3/r^3$ with $B_0\gtrsim 10^{16}$ G) on the neutrino transport in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe). Magnetic fields quantize the momenta of electrons and positrons, resulting in an enhanced absorption cross section for low-energy neutrinos and suppressed chemical potentials for $e^\pm$. We include these changes in the M1 scheme for neutrino transport and perform 1-D CCSNe simulations with \texttt{GR1D}. The increased low-energy cross sections reduce the $\bar{\nu}_e$ mean energy $\langle E_{\bar\nu_e}\rangle$ while elevating the neutrino number luminosities $\mathcal{L_\nu}$ for both ${\nu}_e$ and $\bar{\nu}_e$ due to the lower energy weighted spectra. The reduction of chemical potential enhances the $\bar{\nu}_e$ emission while suppressing that of $\nu_e$, thereby driving an increase in the electron fraction behind the stalled shock at $\sim30$--$100$ km. This further amplifies $\langle E_{\nu_e}\rangle$ through an increased electron density. Consequently, magnetic fields amplify $L_{\nu_e}$ by increasing both $\mathcal{L}_{\nu_e}$ and $\langle E_{\nu_e}\rangle$ whereas for $\bar\nu_e$, the rise in $\mathcal{L}_{\bar\nu_e}$ is offset by a decreased $\langle E_{\bar\nu_e}\rangle$, leading to a minimal change in $L_{\bar\nu_e}$. A systematic parameter scan of dipole field configurations suggests that, for $r_0 > 30$ km, $\langle E_{\bar{\nu}_e} \rangle$ is significantly suppressed and $L_{\nu_e}$ is enhanced if $B_0 \geq {2.7} \times 10^{16}$ G. These magnetic effects become negligible for $B_0$ below $\sim {7.4} \times 10^{15}$ G.

 In this paper, we compute a full set of neutron star magnetosphere structures from the basic vacuum regime to the dissipation-less force-free regime by implementing a resistive prescription for the plasma. A comparison to the radiation reaction limit is also discussed. We investigated the impact of these resistive magnetospheres onto the multi-wavelength emission properties based on the polar cap model for radio wavelengths, on the slot gap model for X-rays and on the striped wind model for $\gamma$-rays.} % methods heading (mandatory) {We performed time-dependent pseudo-spectral simulations of the full Maxwell equations including a resistive Ohm's law. We deduced the polar cap shape and size, the Poynting flux, the magnetic field structure and the current sheet surface, depending on the magnetic obliquity~$\chi$ and on the conductivity~$\sigma$. We found that the geometry of the magnetosphere close to the stellar surface is not impacted by the amount of resistivity. Polar cap rims remain very similar in shape and size. However the Poynting flux varies significantly as well as the magnetic field sweep-back in the vicinity of the light-cylinder. This bending of field lines reflects into the $\gamma$-ray pulse profiles, changing the $\gamma$-ray peak separation~$\Delta$ as well as the time lag~$\delta$ between the radio pulse and $\gamma$-ray peaks. X-ray pulse profiles are also drastically affected by the resistivity. A full set of multi-wavelength light-curves can be compiled for future comparison with the third $\gamma$-ray pulsar catalogue. This systematic study will help to constrain the amount of magnetic energy flowing into particle kinetic energy and shared by radiation.
#### Does the Babcock-Leighton dynamo operate in rapidly rotating solar-type stars? Exploration using a 3D dynamo model at different rotation rates

 - **Abstract**
 The Babcock-Leighton dynamo, which relies on the generation of a poloidal field through the decay and dispersal of tilted bipolar magnetic regions (BMRs), is a promising paradigm for explaining the features of the solar magnetic cycle. In rapidly rotating stars, BMRs are expected to emerge at high latitudes, which are less efficient in generating the poloidal field due to poor cross-equatorial cancellation. The operation of the Babcock-Leighton dynamo in rapidly rotating stars is therefore questionable. We, for the first time, using a 3D kinematic dynamo model, STABLE, explore this question. By taking large-scale flows from mean-field hydrodynamics models for stars rotating at different speeds, We conduct a series of dynamo simulations in rapidly rotating stars, exploring the following four cases of spot deposition, each based on a different assumption about toroidal flux tube rise: (i) radial rise, (ii) parallel rise to the rotation axis, (iii) parallel rise combined with an increase in Joy's law slope with the stellar rotation rate, and (iv) increasing time delay and spot size. We find cyclic magnetic fields in all cases except case IV of the 1-day rotating star, for which the magnetic field is irregular. For the parallel-rise cases, the magnetic field becomes quadrupolar, and for all other cases, it is dipolar. Our work demonstrates that the Babcock-Leighton dynamo may operate even in rapidly rotating stars with starspots appearing at higher latitudes.

 - **Abstract**
 A medium-resolution spectroscopic survey of helium-rich hot subdwarfs has been carried out using the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT). Objectives include the discovery of exotic hot subdwarfs, resolving distinct subclasses, identifying evolutionary sequences, and establishing the past and future histories of many of these unusual stars. This paper extends the sample described by Jeffery et al. (2021) (arXiv:2011.09523) from 100 to 697 stars. It describes the selection criteria and presents spectral classifications based on the MK-like Drilling system. The sample includes 283 extremely helium-rich hot subdwarfs, 17 extreme helium stars, 110 intermediate helium-rich hot subdwarfs, as well as 21 helium-rich stars of other types. It now represents the largest homogeneous sample of both "normal" He-sdOs and "luminous" or "hot" He-sdOs. Interesting stars discovered include magnetic hot subdwarfs, extremely hot pre-white dwarfs and hot subdwarfs, including hot subdwarfs showing NV emission, one short-period binary, new extreme helium stars and several double-subdwarf candidates. The data form the basis for kinematic and model atmosphere analyses to follow.

 - **Abstract**
 We present various time series analysis methods to analyze multiple-sector observations of bright AGN from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and examine whether issues such as gaps and noise in these data can be mitigated. We determine variability timescales and search for quasi-periodicity using these methods and assess any differences. In this paper, we present an analysis of the $\approx$300-day TESS observation of a blazar 3C 371 using power spectrum density, structure-function, and weighted wavelet Z-transform approaches. To reduce the effect of gaps and noise, Continuous auto-regressive moving averages, Bartlett periodogram, and wavelet decomposition methods are used. We have also used recurrence analysis to account for the nonlinearity present in the data and to quantify variability or periodicity as the recurrent state. Considering the entirety of the TESS observations, we derive the variability timescale to be around 4.5 days. Sector-wise analysis found variability timescales in the range of 3.0--7.0 days, values that are found to be consistent using different methods. When analyzing multiple sectors together, significant variability, which could be quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs), of duration 3--6 days in individual segments, is detected. These may be attributed to the kink instabilities developed in the jet or the existence of mini-jets inside a jet undergoing precession. We find that these methods, when applied appropriately, can be used to study the variability in TESS data. The noise present in these TESS observations can be minimized using Bartlett's periodogram and wavelet decomposition to recover the real stochastic variability.

 - **Abstract**
 The Near Ultraviolet Transient Explorer (NUTEx) is a CubeSat-based near-ultraviolet (NUV) imaging payload designed for transient sky surveys and is currently under development. CubeSats are compact and cost-effective satellite platforms that have emerged as versatile tools for scientific exploration and technology demonstrations in space. NUTEx is an imaging telescope operating in the 200-300 nm wavelength range, intended for deployment on a micro-satellite bus. The optical system is based on a Ritchey Chretien (RC) telescope configuration, featuring a 146 mm primary mirror. The detector is a photon-counting microchannel plate (MCP) device with a solar-blind photocathode, paired with an in-house developed readout unit. The instrument has a wide field of view (FoV) of 4 deg, a peak effective area of approximately 18 sq cm at 260 nm, and can reach a sensitivity of 21 AB magnitude (SNR = 5) in a 200 second exposure. The primary scientific objective of NUTEx is to monitor the night sky for transient phenomena, such as supernova remnants, flaring M-dwarf stars, and other short-timescale events. The payload is currently scheduled for launch in Q2 2026. This paper presents the NUTEx instrument design, outlines its scientific goals and capabilities, and provides an overview of the electronics and mechanical subsystems, including structural analysis.

 - **Abstract**
 We discuss some aspects of stellar evolution in binary systems. While single stars can swell following the chemical evolution of their interior, stars belonging to binary systems cannot overflow the size of the Roche lobe and hydrostatic equilibrium is strictly impossible. The system is forced to exchange mass between its members through the inner Lagrangian point. In the first part of the paper, we discuss the standard evolution of binaries that have a non-degenerate donor star and a compact companion. We show that the model fails when to account for the occurrence of binary pulsars when they predict a long-standing mass transfer episode. Models including irradiation feedback and evaporation in close binaries are examined next. Following these sections, we discuss the case of systems with a black hole (BH). We show that if BHs are born non-rotating, binary interaction seems insufficient to speed them up, an indication that BH rotation is a feature present at birth. Finally, we discuss Blue Straggler Stars detected in open and globular clusters. Since they cannot be understood as single-born stars, we evaluate one of the proposed channels is mass transfer in close binaries, and discuss its viability and the limitations of the present models.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of tidal disruption events (TDEs) have already produced tens of strong candidate flares, and their number will greatly increase with upcoming wide field surveys. Nevertheless, the origin of the measured luminosity peak at early times is still unknown, and the ultimate sources of energy dissipation in TDEs are not fully understood. Here we present the first three-dimensional end-to-end simulation of a TDE by a $10^{4}M_\odot$ intermediate mass black hole (IMBH) with realistic parameters, run with the radiation-hydrodynamics code RICH. We find that the stellar debris fails to circularize efficiently, while a low-density, radiation-driven wind forms near pericenter and expands quasi-spherically. Radiation is advected by this outflow and released at the photosphere, which expands to radii of $\approx10^{13}$ cm and reaches temperatures of ~few $10^{4}$K at the peak of the light curve. The resulting luminosity briefly exceeds the Eddington limit before settling near that value. We systematically test the numerical convergence of our simulation by running it at three resolutions. While the nozzle shock at pericenter may be under-resolved, we find that global results are qualitatively converged and, largely, quantitatively robust. The upcoming Vera Rubin Observatory's LSST (g and r band) and ULTRASAT (near UV) will be able to observe events like our simulated IMBH TDE up to redshifts of z$\approx$0.1 and z$\approx$0.06, respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 The rapid quenching of satellite galaxies in dense environments is often attributed to environmental processes such as ram pressure stripping. However, stripping alone cannot fully account for the removal of dense, star-forming gas in many satellites, particularly in their inner regions. Recent models and indirect observations have suggested that star formation-driven outflows may play a critical role in expelling this remaining gas, yet direct evidence for such feedback-driven quenching remains limited. Here we report the discovery of an ionized gas outflow in NGC 4064, a Virgo cluster satellite that has already lost most of its cold gas through environmental stripping. MUSE observations from the Multiphase Astrophysics to Unveil the Virgo Environment (MAUVE) survey reveal a bi-polar outflow driven by residual, centrally concentrated star formation in NGC 4064 - despite its current star formation rate being ~0.4 dex below the star-forming main sequence due to prior interaction with the cluster environment. The outflow's mass loading factor is ~2, suggesting that stellar feedback could remove the remaining gas on timescales shorter than those required for depletion by star formation alone. These results demonstrate that even modest but centrally concentrated star formation can drive efficient feedback in stripped satellites, accelerating quenching in the final stages of their evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Inflation elegantly provides initial conditions for the standard model of cosmology, while solving the horizon, flatness, and magnetic monopole problems. Inflationary models make predictions for the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ and the spectral index $n_s$ of initial density fluctuations. In light of relevant data releases this year, we present constraints on these two parameters using the latest cosmic microwave background (CMB) and baryon acoustic oscillation data (BAO) available. Using data from Planck, the South Pole Telescope, Atacama Cosmology Telescope, and BICEP/Keck experiments, we derive $n_s=0.9682\,\pm\,0.0032$ and a 95% upper limit of $r<0.034$. This upper limit on $r$ is consistent with the official BICEP/Keck result given the numerical precision of the analyses and our choice to impose the self-consistency relation for single field slow-roll inflation on the tensor power spectrum; the $r$ constraint is not impacted by the additional CMB data. While adding DESI BAO data to the CMB data has a negligible impact on $r$, the $n_s$ constraint shifts upward to $0.9728\,\pm\,0.0029$, which favours monomial inflaton potentials with $N_\star\sim 50$ over Starobinsky $R^2$ or Higgs inflation with $N_\star = 51$ and $N_\star = 55$, respectively. This shift is caused by marginally significant differences between the CMB and DESI data that remain unexplained in the context of the standard model. We show that a class of polynomial $\alpha$-attractor models can predict the CMB and CMB+DESI $n_s$ results with $N_\star=47.1$ and $N_\star=55.1$, respectively. While future data will improve our sensitivity to $r$, robust $n_s$ constraints are just as crucial to differentiate between inflation models. We make the data needed to reproduce the new CMB and BAO results and visualisation tools for $r$-$n_s$ figures to compare to any inflation model available this https URL .

 - **Abstract**
 Common methods for studying the kinematics and geometry of outflowing gas rely on modeling emission and absorption lines in integrated spectra using methods that are not physically motivated, including empirical quantiles or fitting multiple Gaussian or Voigt profiles. Such methods are not always consistent with the interpretation of these features and, as a result, miss key underlying physics and can even lead to inaccurate interpretations of observations. To address this problem, we present the publicly available python code OutLines, which provides astrophysical models of spectral emission and absorption line profiles produced by outflows in a variety of environments. The OutLines code accounts for differences in parameterization of the velocity field and density profile while allowing for different outflow geometries, making OutLines versatile and useful for a wide variety of astrophysical phenomena. We demonstrate the wide applicability of OutLines by using the code to model line profiles in an H II region knot, super star clusters, a starburst galaxy, and an AGN. In each of these contexts, we illustrate how OutLines can illuminate key underlying physics in ways that improve our scientific understanding and address important open questions in astronomy, including the key mechanisms in the baryon cycle, the evolution of H II regions and galaxies, and even Lyman continuum escape. OutLines will be a critical resource as massively multiplexed spectroscopic surveys like WEAVE-LOFAR and 4MOST/WAVES come online, providing the means to probe feedback kinematics with deeper, higher resolution spectroscopy for unprecedented large samples of galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 We perform population synthesis modeling of isolated neutron stars in the Milky Way over its lifetime. Compared with previous studies, we use more detailed models of the interstellar medium and the magneto-rotational evolution of neutron stars. We demonstrate that presently, the spin-down rate at the propeller stage is the main uncertain factor that influences the number of accreting isolated neutron stars. If the propeller stage duration allows neutron stars to begin accreting matter from the interstellar medium and if the efficiency of accretion is high, then the number of accreting isolated neutron stars in eROSITA data can reach ~a few thousand. Still, uncertainties in spin-down at the propeller stage and in the accretion process can drastically decrease this number. We suggest that future observations of neutron stars in wide low-mass binaries recently discovered by Gaia can clarify these issues.

 - **Abstract**
 The discovery of joint sources of high-energy neutrinos and gravitational waves has been a primary target for the LIGO, Virgo, KAGRA, and IceCube observatories. The joint detection of high-energy neutrinos and gravitational waves would provide insight into cosmic processes, such as progenitor dynamics and outflows. The joint detection of multiple cosmic messengers can also elevate the significance of the observation when some or all of the constituent messengers are sub-threshold, not significant enough to declare their detection individually. Leveraging data from the LIGO, Virgo, and IceCube observatories, we conducted an archival investigation of sub-threshold multimessenger events. Complementing previous analyses, we used minimal assumptions to search for common sources of sub-threshold gravitational-wave and high-energy neutrino candidates during the third observing run (O3) of the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors. Our search did not identify significant joint sources. We therefore derive constraints on the rate density of joint sources for each compact binary merger population as a function of the energy emitted in neutrinos. Only a fraction of the gravitational-wave sources emit neutrinos, if the neutrino emission has high bolometric energy ($>10^{52}$ to $10^{54}$ erg).

 - **Abstract**
 In this work we perform Fisher forecasts on the expansion and the growth factors following model independent approaches from 3x2pt joint analysis of the galaxy lensing, clustering, and their cross-correlated spectra at the linear, and extending as well to non linear scales. For that, instead of choosing a specific model for the matter power spectrum, the main ingredient of these probes, we express it by parametrizing its components, such as the expansion and the growth factor, and those of the standard halo model and excursion set theory in several z bins, besides to the different bias and non-linear bias modelling functions. We apply the technique to Euclid, Rubin and SKA public specifications in the range 0.2 < z < 1.8 and show that one can then obtain model-independent constraints of the expansion E(z i ) and the growth factor G(z i ). We also show the change in gain in precision at each z- shell when going from pessimistic cut at linear scales to more optimistic non-linear settings, or the difference between using each survey alone or a combination of all of them, or the impact from fixing or adding more degrees of freedom in the non-linear modeling. We found that, in the most agnostic case, one can still reach high precision on E(z i ) in the order of the percent level when combining the three surveys at once while the growth factor G(z i ) has for the same settings one order of magnitude weaker constraints. We also found for both factors, an improvement that can reach one order of magnitude in precision when passing from linear to non-linear scales. We conclude that we will be able to constrain the two important factors of the background evolution and structure formation of the Universe when using non linear scales and the combined power of future surveys even in the most agnostic approaches.

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are typically discovered in previously quiescent galaxies. However, earlier studies have revealed a handful of TDEs occurring in pre-existing active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We discuss AT2019aalc, a promising TDE candidate in an AGN, and compare it to similar sources. We also explore Bowen fluorescence flares, a newly identified class of flaring supermassive black holes, as potential members of the TDE in AGN transient class. We aim to connect the observed properties of these flares with the expectations of TDE-in-AGN simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 Chemical abundance radial gradients provide key information on how the processes that affect chemical enrichment of the gas-phase interstellar medium (ISM) act at different galaxy scales. Whereas in the last decades there has been an increase in the number of galaxies studied with integral field spectroscopy, there is still not a clear picture on a subsequent characterization of the chemical abundance radial gradients in galaxies hosting Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). This lack of analysis is even more accentuated in the case of low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions (LINERs). For the first time, we analyze the chemical abundance radial gradients in a sample of LINER-like galaxies, whose nuclear emission has been previously (Paper I) discussed. We use a sample of 97 galaxies from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA), whose nuclear regions show LINER-like emission. We use the open-source code HII-CHI-Mistry to estimate the chemical abundance ratios 12+log(O/H) and log(N/O) in the HII regions across the disks in our sample, as well as in the nuclear parts where the LINER-like activity dominates. To fit the radial profiles we use a piecewise methodology which uses a non-fixed number of breaks to find the best fit for the data. We obtain that majority of our sample of galaxies exhibits departures from the single linear gradient both in 12+log(O/H) and log(N/O) (as expected from the inside-out scenario). We investigate whether these departures are driven by galaxy properties (stellar mass, neutral gas mass, stellar velocity dispersion), finding not correlation at all. We also report that in most cases there is no correlation between the shape of the 12+log(O/H) and log(N/O) radial profiles. We propose a model in which AGN (feed)back, acting at different scales depending on the galaxy and its evolutionary stage, might be responsible for these departures.

 - **Abstract**
 Current pulsar timing array (PTA) analyses do not take full advantage of pulsar distance information, thereby missing out on improved angular resolution and on a potential factor-of-two gain in detection sensitivity for individual gravitational-wave (GW) sources. In this work, we investigate the impact of precise pulsar distance measurements on angular resolution as an extension to previous work measuring the angular resolution of a dense, isotropic PTA [Jow et al., 2025]. We present a coherent map-making technique that utilizes precise pulsar distance measurements to reach the diffraction-limited resolution of an individual source: $\delta \theta_{\mathrm{diff}} \sim (1/\mathrm{SNR})(\lambda_{\mathrm{GW}}/r) \approx 2~\mathrm{arcmin}$, where the SNR refers to the detection strength of the source. With this level of angular resolution, identifying an EM counterpart may become feasible, enabling multi-messenger follow-up. We show that for $\rm SNR=10$, which may be the current sensitivity level using a coherent analysis, the diffraction limit is reached with roughly 9 pulsars. Moreover, angular resolution scales sharply with the number of known pulsar distances as $\sim (1/\mathrm{SNR})^{N_{\mathrm{dist}}/2}$. Thus, each additional pulsar with high signal-to-noise timing and precise distance measurement can improve PTA resolution by an order of magnitude. The distance to the best-timed millisecond pulsar (PSR J0437$-$4715) is already constrained to sub-parsec levels. We argue, therefore, that a coherent analysis of PTA data, fully incorporating pulsar distance information, is timely.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive study of the ionizing properties of 1721 galaxies at $5.6<z<6.5$ using deep JWST/NIRCam photometric imaging from the NEP, JADES, and PRIMER surveys spanning an unmasked area $\sim550$arcmin$^2$ across UV magnitudes $-22\lesssim M_{\rm UV}\lesssim-17.5$. Our $90\%$ stellar mass complete sample suggests little relation of UV slope with magnitude, $\beta_{\rm UV}=(-0.040\pm0.022)M_{\rm UV}-2.88^{+0.43}_{-0.44}$, implying $f_{\rm esc}^{\rm LyC}\simeq5\%$ based on calibrations from the Low-redshift Lyman Continuum Survey (LzLCS). We measure a constant ionizing photon production efficiency with UV magnitude, $\log_{10}(\xi_{\rm ion, 0}/\rm Hz\,erg^{-1}) = -0.006^{+0.019}_{-0.017}~M_{\rm UV} + 25.05^{+0.39}_{-0.34}$, consistent with HST canonical values. The total production rate of photons escaping into the IGM is computed as $\log_{10}(\dot{n}_{\rm ion}/\rm s^{-1}Mpc^{-3})=50.31^{+0.07}_{-0.06}$ for $M_{\rm UV}<-17$ galaxies from our star forming and smouldering UV luminosity functions (UVLFs), which differ in the faint-end slope ($\alpha_{\rm SFG}=-2.2\pm0.2$; $\alpha_{\rm sm}=-1.7\pm0.2$). Extrapolating to the latest UVLF turnover limits from the massive lensing galaxy cluster Abell S1063 ($M_{\rm UV, lim}=-13.5$) implies that a recombination-weighted HII clumping factor $C_{\rm HII, rec}=6.2^{+4.1}_{-2.1}$ is required to produce fully stably reionized at $z\simeq6$. A clumping factor of this magnitude resolves the ionizing photon budget crisis. Our methodology paves the way for indirect clumping measurements from galaxies which will provide insight into earlier stages of the EoR when the Ly$\alpha$-forest becomes saturated and more direct quasar measurements become impossible.

 - **Abstract**
 Upcoming space-based gravitational wave detectors such as LISA, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, will be sensitive to extreme- and intermediate-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs and IMRIs). These binaries are comprised of a supermassive black hole and a stellar-mass object or intermediate-mass black hole. Their detection will probe the structure of galactic nuclei and enable tests of general relativity. As these events will be observed over thousands of orbital cycles, they will be extremely sensitive to both the underlying spacetime and astrophysical environment, demanding exquisite theoretical models on both fronts to avoid biased or even erroneous results. In particular, many (E/)IMRIs are expected to occur within accretion discs around supermassive black holes, and the nonlinearities present when modeling these systems require numerical simulations. In preparation for future modeling of LISA sources, we have conducted a comparison between eight different hydrodynamical codes and applied them to the problem of a q = 10^{-4} mass ratio binary interacting with an accretion disc. Thicker discs appear more lenient, and all codes at sufficiently high resolutions are in good agreement with each other and analytical predictions. For thinner discs, beyond the reach of analytical models, we find substantial disagreement between 2D and 3D simulations and between different codes, including both the magnitude and sign of the torque. With time and energy efficiency in mind, codes that leverage moving meshes or grid-based Lagrangian remapping seem preferable, as do codes that can leverage graphical processing units and other energy-efficient hardware.

 - **Abstract**
 The elemental compositions of exoplanets encode information about their formation environments and internal structures. While volatile ratios such as carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) are used to trace formation location, the rock-forming elements - magnesium (Mg), silicon (Si), and iron (Fe) - govern interior mineralogy and are commonly assumed to reflect the host star's abundances. Yet this assumption remains largely untested. Ultra-hot Jupiters, gas-giant exoplanets with dayside temperatures above 3000 K, provide rare access to refractory elements that remain gaseous. Here we present high-resolution thermal emission spectroscopy of the exoplanet WASP-189b (Teq = 3354^{+27}_{-34} K) obtained with the Immersion Grating Infrared Spectrometer (IGRINS) on Gemini South. We detect neutral iron (Fe I), magnesium (Mg I), silicon (Si I), water (H_2O), carbon monoxide (CO), and hydroxyl (OH) at signal-to-noise ratios exceeding 4, and retrieve their elemental abundances. We show that the Mg/Si, Fe/Mg, and Si/Fe ratios are consistent with stellar values, while the refractory-to-volatile ratio is enhanced by roughly a factor of ~2. These findings demonstrate that giant-planet atmospheres can preserve stellar-like rock-forming ratios, providing an empirical validation of the stellar-proxy assumption that underpins planetary composition and formation models across exoplanet systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations have suggested that galactic outflows contain substantial amounts of dense and clumpy molecular gas, creating favourable conditions for igniting star formation. Indeed, theoretical models and hydrodynamical simulations have suggested that stars could form within galactic outflows, representing a new mode of star-formation that differs significantly from the typical star formation in star forming discs. In this paper, we examine 12 local galaxies with powerful Active Galactic Nuclei and high star-formation rate using spectroscopic data from the X-shooter spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope. We investigate the excitation mechanism and physical properties of these outflows via spatially resolved diagnostic diagrams (along with tests to rule out contribution by shocks and external photoionisation). Out of the seven galaxies with clearly detected outflows, we find robust evidence for star formation within the outflow of one galaxy (IRAS 20551-4250), with two additional galaxies showing tentative signs (IRAS 13120-5453 and F13229-2934). Therefore, our findings support previous results that star formation inside outflows can be a relatively common phenomenon among these active galaxies and may have played an important role in the formation and evolution of the spheroidal component of galaxies.
