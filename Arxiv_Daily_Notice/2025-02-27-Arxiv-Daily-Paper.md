 - **Abstract**
 Star formation through the dynamical magnetized collapse remains an active area of astrophysical research. We carry out a comprehensive exploration on the magnetized gravitational collapse of a non-rotating self-gravitating initially spherically symmetric prestellar cloud core using two-dimensional nonideal magnetohydrodynamic simulations incorporating ambipolar diffusion and Ohmic dissipation. Our study encompasses a broader range of equations of state (EOSs) in the form of $P(\rho) \propto \rho^{\Gamma}$, with the aim of constraining the choice of EOSs for allowing star formation. Our results reveal that the collapse with a $\Gamma$ no stiffer than $4/3$, complemented by magnetized virial theorem, allows the dynamical contraction of the prestellar core to happen continuously where a central point mass forms and steadily builds up its mass from the infalling envelope, with a mass accretion rate of a scale of the order of $c_{\rm s}^3/G$. The choice of an isothermal EOS most naturally facilitates the collapse as a magnetic analog of the inside-out collapse. In addition to that, our study exhibits that the nonisothermal magnetized collapse models with a $\Gamma$ no stiffer than 4/3 qualitatively demonstrate similar infall features to those of an isothermal EOS. Furthermore, the collapse models with a $\Gamma$ stiffer than $4/3$ fail to ensure the sufficient cooling to allow the direct mass growth of the central point mass, thus delaying the infall. Our work can offer deeper insights in understanding the significance of EOSs on the magnetized gravitational collapse, enabling star formation.

 - **Abstract**
 The observed star formation and wind outflow rates in galaxies suggest cold gas must be continually replenished via infalling clouds or streams. Previous studies have highlighted the importance of cooling-induced condensation on such gas, which enables survival, mass growth, and a drag force which typically exceeds hydrodynamic drag. However, the combined effects of magnetic fields, cooling, and infall remains unexplored. We conduct 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of radiatively cooling infalling clouds and streams in uniform and stratified backgrounds. For infalling clouds, magnetic fields aligned with gravity do not impact cloud growth or dynamics significantly, although we see enhanced survival for stronger fields. By contrast, even weak transverse magnetic fields significantly slow cloud infall via magnetic drag, due to the development of strong draped fields which develop at peak infall velocity, before the cloud decelerates. Besides enhancing survival, long, slow infall increases total cloud mass growth compared to the hydrodynamic case, even if reduced turbulent mixing lowers the rate of mass growth. Streams often result in qualitatively different behavior. Mass growth and hence accretion drag are generally much lower in hydrodynamic streams. Unlike in clouds, aligned magnetic fields suppress mixing and thus both mass growth or loss. Transverse fields do apply magnetic drag and allow streams to grow, when the streams have a well-defined 'head' pushing through the surrounding medium. Overall, regardless of the efficacy of drag forces, streams are surprisingly robust in realistic potentials, as the destruction time when falling supersonically exceeds the infall time. We develop analytic models which reproduce cloud/stream trajectories.
#### Evidence for Low Universal Equilibrium Black Hole Spin in Luminous Magnetically Arrested Disks

 - **Abstract**
 Relativistic collimated outflows, or jets, provide a crucial mode of active galactic nucleus feedback. Although the jets extract their energy from the black hole (BH) rotation, their effect on the BH spin is poorly understood. Because the spin controls radiative and mechanical BH feedback, lack of first-principles models for BH spin evolution limits our ability to interpret observations, including the recent LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA spin constraints. Particularly important are luminous disks, which rapidly grow and strongly torque their BHs. Jet-less and weakly magnetized standard luminous disks spin-up their BHs to near-maximum dimensionless spin, $a_{eq,NT}=0.998$. However, sufficient large-scale vertical magnetic flux can cause the inner disk to enter a magnetically arrested disk (MAD) state, whose jets can efficiently extract BH rotational energy and significantly spin-down the BH. Indeed, Lowell et al. 2024 found that non-radiative MADs spin-down their BHs to very low $a_\text{eq,MAD}^\text{nr}=0.07$. Moreover, their analytic model predicted that luminous MADs also spin-down their BHs to low $a_{eq,MAD}^{lum}\sim0.3-0.5$. To test this prediction, we perform 3D general relativistic (radiation) magnetohydrodynamic (GR(R)MHD) simulations of MADs across a wide range of BH spin ($-0.9\le{}a\le0.99$) and disk dimensionless thickness ($0.03\le{}h/r\le0.3$, which corresponds to Eddington ratio, $0.35\le{}\dot{m}/\dot{m}_\text{Edd}\le\infty$). We find that luminous MADs spin-down their BHs to a low universal equilibrium spin value, $a_{eq,MAD}^{lum}\simeq0.3$ for $0.03\le{}h/r\le0.1$. Moreover, we find evidence for quadratic convergence, $a_{eq,MAD}\simeq0.31-2.71(h/r)^2\to0.31$ as $h/r\to0$. We attribute this to disk thermodynamics becoming irrelevant as the cooling becomes more aggressive and magnetic forces start to dominate. We finish by discussing the astrophysical implications.

 - **Abstract**
 The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has opened a window on many new puzzles in the early Universe, including a population of high-redshift star clusters with extremely high stellar surface density, suggesting unique star formation conditions in the Universe's early evolution. We study the formation and evolution of these first star clusters and galaxies using an AREPO cosmological simulation box designed to resolve the intricate environments of the smallest halos hosting Population III star clusters at $z \geq 12$. Our approach, which prioritizes baryonic structure identification through a friends-of-friends algorithm, provides new insights into early star cluster formation and delivers predictions directly relevant to observations. We investigate the dynamical properties of these first star clusters and use numerical and analytical methods to understand the populations of virialized and non-virialized systems. Our findings indicate that high-$z$ star clusters in a feedback-free regime can achieve extreme surface densities, consistent with the systems detected by JWST. These results imply that JWST may have the opportunity to uncover stellar systems at high redshift whose dynamical state preserves evidence of the hierarchical structure formation process.

 - **Abstract**
 It has been a decade since the IceCube collaboration began detecting high-energy (HE) neutrinos originating from cosmic sources. Despite a few well-known individual associations and numerous phenomenological, observational, and statistical multiwavelength studies, the origin of astrophysical HE neutrinos largely remains a mystery. To date, the most convincing associations link HE neutrinos with active galactic nuclei (AGN). Consequently, many studies have attempted population-based correlation tests between HE neutrinos and specific AGN subpopulations (such as blazars). While some of associations are suggestive, no definitive population-based correlation has been established. This could result from either a lack of a population-based correlation or insufficient detection power, given the substantial atmospheric neutrino background. By leveraging blazar variability, we performed spatio-temporal blazar-neutrino correlation tests aimed at enhancing detection power by reliably incorporating temporal information into the statistical analysis. We used simulations to evaluate the detection power of our method under various test strategies. We find that: (1) with sufficiently large source samples, if 20% of astrophysical HE neutrinos originate from blazars, we should robustly observe $\sim$4$\sigma$ associations; (2) a counting-based test-statistic combined with a top-hat weighting scheme (rather than a Gaussian one) provides the greatest detection power; (3) applying neutrino sample cuts reduces detection power when a weighting scheme is used; (4) in top-hat-like weighting schemes, small p-values do not occur arbitrarily with an increase in HE neutrino error region size (any such occurrence is indicative of an underlying blazar-neutrino correlation).
#### Low-Eddington ratio, changing-look active galactic nuclei: the case of NGC 4614

 - **Abstract**
 Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are known to be variable sources across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, in particular at optical/ultraviolet and X-ray energies. Over the past decades, a growing number of AGN have displayed type transitions: from type 1 to type 2 or viceversa within a few years or even several months. These galaxies have been commonly referred to as changing-look AGN (CLAGN). Here we report on a new CLAGN, NGC 4614, which transitioned from a type 1.9 to a type 2 state. NGC 4614 is a nearly face-on barred galaxy at redshift $z = 0.016$, classified as a low-luminosity AGN. Its central black hole has a mass of about $1.6\times 10^7 M_\odot$ and an Eddington ratio around 1 percent. We recently acquired optical spectra of NGC 4614 at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo and the data clearly suggest that the broad H$\alpha$ component has strongly dimmed, if not disappeared. A very recent Swift observation confirmed our current optical data, with the AGN weakened by almost a factor of 10 with respect to previous X-ray observations. Indeed, NGC 4614 had been also observed by Swift/XRT 6 times in 2011, when the source was clearly detected in all observations. By fitting the stack of the 2011 Swift observations we obtain a photon index of $\Gamma=1.3\pm0.3$ and an equivalent hydrogen column density of $N_{\rm H}$=$1.2\pm0.3$ $\times$10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$, indicating that NGC 4614 can be moderately absorbed in the X-rays. Although a significant change in the foreground gas absorption that may have obscured the broad line region cannot be entirely ruled out, the most likely explanation for our optical and X-ray data is that NGC 4614 is experiencing a change in the accretion state that reduces the radiative efficiency of the X-ray corona.
#### vis-r: Quick radial profile modelling for radio interferometric visibilities

 - **Abstract**
 This paper describes a method for parametric radial profile modelling of radio interferometric visibility data. Image-based parametric modelling is common in the field of circumstellar debris disks, and high resolution ALMA observations make this method computationally expensive because many high resolution images must be generated and Fourier transformed. Most circumstellar disks are axisymmetric, so here a method that avoids generating images and instead models radial profiles is outlined. The two main elements are i) $u,v$ space visibility averaging, and ii) using the Discrete Hankel Transform to convert arbitrary parametric radial surface brightness profiles to visibilities. Vertical scale height can be included, but is fixed with radius; in principle this is a limitation but in practise radially-dependent vertical structure information is beyond even ALMA's capability for all but a few debris disks. Combined, these ingredients yield a method that is one to two orders of magnitude faster than image based methods and can be run on a laptop, is sufficient for most ALMA observations of debris disks, and can be used with gradient-based fitting methods such as Hamiltonian Monte-Carlo. A small software package is provided, which is dubbed vis-r.
#### JWST/MIRI detection of [Ne V] and [Ne VI] in M83: Evidence for the long sought-after AGN?

 - **Abstract**
 We report the first detections of [Ne V] 14.3 {\mu}m and [Ne VI] 7.7 {\mu}m at high confidence (S/N>=6) in the nuclear region of the nearby spiral galaxy M83. Emission line maps of these high ionization lines show several compact structures. Specifically, the [Ne VI] emission is located at 140 pc from the optical nucleus and appears as a point source of size ~<18 pc (FWHM =<0.8"). We investigate the possible source of this extreme emission through comparison with photoionization models and ancillary data. We find that photoionization models of fast radiative shocks are able to reproduce the observed high excitation emission line fluxes only for the lowest preshock density available in the library, n =0.01 cm^-3. Additionally, tailored active galactic nuclei (AGN) photoionization models assuming a two-zone structure are compatible with the observed high ionization fluxes. Our simple AGN model shows that the emission at the location of the [Ne VI] source can be the result of a cloud being ionized by the radiation cone of an AGN. We stress, however, that to definitively confirm an AGN as the main source of the observed emission, more complex modeling accounting for different geometries is required. Previously known as a purely starburst system, these new findings of the nuclear region of M83 will require a reassessment of its nature and of objects similar to it, particularly now that we have access to the unparalleled infrared sensitivity and spatial resolution of the James Webb Space Telescope.

 - **Abstract**
 Discovered over fifty years ago, neutron stars exhibit a remarkable variety of behaviors depending on their age, magnetic field strength, rotational dynamics, emission mechanisms, and surrounding environments. This diversity in their observational manifestations has led astronomers to classify neutron stars into numerous categories, much like wandering through a zoo and admiring various species. This chapter focuses on isolated (i.e., non-accreting) neutron stars. We review extensive observational results of rotation-powered pulsars, magnetars, X-ray dim isolated neutron stars and central compact objects, highlighting the unique properties and recent discoveries of these neutron star classes. We briefly touch on theoretical models that have significantly advanced our understanding of these classes, emphasizing the valuable insights they provide into the underlying physics of neutron stars.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the Dark Energy Camera All Data Everywhere (DECADE) weak lensing dataset: a catalog of 107 million galaxies observed by the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) in the northern Galactic cap. This catalog was assembled from public DECam data including survey and standard observing programs. These data were consistently processed with the Dark Energy Survey Data Management pipeline as part of the DECADE campaign and serve as the basis of the DECam Local Volume Exploration survey (DELVE) Early Data Release 3 (EDR3). We apply the Metacalibration measurement algorithm to generate and calibrate galaxy shapes. After cuts, the resulting cosmology-ready galaxy shape catalog covers a region of $5,\!412 \,\,{\rm deg}^2$ with an effective number density of $4.59\,\, {\rm arcmin}^{-2}$. The coadd images used to derive this data have a median limiting magnitude of $r = 23.6$, $i = 23.2$, and $z = 22.6$, estimated at ${\rm S/N} = 10$ in a 2 arcsecond aperture. We present a suite of detailed studies to characterize the catalog, measure any residual systematic biases, and verify that the catalog is suitable for cosmology analyses. In parallel, we build an image simulation pipeline to characterize the remaining multiplicative shear bias in this catalog, which we measure to be $m = (-2.454 \pm 0.124) \times10^{-2}$ for the full sample. Despite the significantly inhomogeneous nature of the data set, due to it being an amalgamation of various observing programs, we find the resulting catalog has sufficient quality to yield competitive cosmological constraints.

 - **Abstract**
 The spectral energy distribution (SED) of a galaxy represents the distribution of electromagnetic radiation emitted across all wavelengths, from radio waves to gamma rays. The galaxy SED is akin to its fingerprint, and serves as a fundamental tool in modern astrophysics. It enables researchers to determine crucial properties of galaxies, including their star-formation rates, stellar populations, dust content, and evolutionary state. By analyzing galactic SEDs, astronomers can reconstruct the physical processes occurring within galaxies and trace their evolutionary histories. This article explores our current understanding of the components that contribute to galactic SEDs, the observational techniques used to measure them, and their applications in understanding galaxy formation and evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 3C 454.3 is a flat spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) known for its high variability across the electromagnetic spectrum, showing structural and flux variability in its pc-scale jet, and correlated variability among frequency bands. This study aims to identify the structure, dynamics, and radiative processes common to the innermost regions of the blazar 3C 454.3. We investigate whether any jet component can be associated with $\gamma-$ray emission and variability. We analyze the relationship between the variable $\gamma-$ray emission and pc-scale jet properties in 3C 454.3 by combining $\gamma-$ray data spanning twelve years with contemporaneous VLBA multi-epoch images at 15 and 43 GHz. Spearman rank correlation tests are conducted to determine if the flux variability of any jet component is associated with $\gamma-$ray variability. Core emission at 43 and 15 GHz strongly correlates with $\gamma-$ray emission. The 43 GHz core (Q0) contributes around 37$\%$ of the observed $\gamma-$ray variability, while the 15 GHz core (K0) accounts for 30$\%$. A quasi-stationary component at 43 GHz, at a projected distance of 4.6 pc, correlates with the $\gamma-$ray flux, accounting for 20$\%$ of its emission between 2016 and 2021. We found a mobile component (Q3 between 2010.18 and 2011.16) at 43 GHz with a projected distance between 0.8 and 2.3 pc and apparent velocity of $\beta_{app} = 9.9 \pm 1.1$ c, accounting for approximately 28% of the $\gamma-$ray emission. The observed simultaneous variability in emission regions beyond the central parsec strongly suggests synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) as the primary mechanism for $\gamma-$ray production in these regions. Our findings demonstrate the existence of multiple $\gamma-$ray emission regions within the blazar jet but also suggest that some of these regions are non-stationary over time.
#### Search for new Galactic Wolf-Rayet stars using Gaia DR3. I. Candidate selection and the follow-up of the bright sample

 - **Abstract**
 Gaia DR3, released in June 2022, included low-resolution XP spectra that have been used for the classification of various types of emission-line objects through machine-learning techniques. The Gaia Extended Stellar Parametrizer for Emission-Line Stars (ESP-ELS) algorithm identified 565 sources as potential Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. Over half of them were already known as WR stars in the Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds. This study aimed to utilize Gaia DR3 data to identify new Galactic WR stars. We extracted all sources classified as WC or WN type stars by the ESP-ELS algorithm from the Gaia catalog. By applying judicious 2MASS color selection criteria, leveraging Gaia H$\alpha$ measurements, and filtering out objects already cataloged in various databases, we selected 37 bright candidates ($G \leq $ 16 mag) and 22 faint candidates ($G > $ 16 mag). Spectroscopic follow-up observations of these candidates were conducted using the 2SPOT facilities in Chile and France, as well as 1-m C2PU's Epsilon telescope at the Calern Observatory. This paper focuses on the brighter sample. Among the 37 targets, we confirmed 17 and 16 new Galactic WC and WN type WR stars, respectively. Three of them were recently reported as new WR stars in an independent study. The Gaia mission provides a valuable resource for uncovering WR stars missed in earlier surveys. While this work concentrated on a relatively small starting sample provided by the ESP-ELS algorithm, our findings highlight the potential for refining selection criteria to identify additional candidates not included in the outputs of the algorithm. Furthermore, the observation program underscores the utility of small telescopes in acquiring initial spectral data for sources with magnitudes up to $G \sim 16$ mag.

 - **Abstract**
 We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Band 3 observations of N$_2$H$^+$ (1-0) and CH$_3$CN (5-4), as well as Band 7 observations of the H$_2$CO molecular line emissions from the protostellar system GGD 27-MM2(E). Through position-velocity diagrams along and across the outflow axis, we study the kinematics and structure of the outflow. We also fit extracted spectra of the CH$_3$CN emission to obtain the physical conditions of the gas. We use the results to discuss the impact of the outflow on its surroundings. We find that N$_2$H$^+$ emission traces a dense molecular cloud surrounding GGD 27-MM2(E). We estimate that the mass of this cloud is $\sim$13.3-26.5 M$_\odot$. The molecular cloud contains an internal cavity aligned with the H$_2$CO-traced molecular outflow. The outflow, also traced by $\mathrm{CH_3 CN}$, shows evidence of a collision with a molecular core (MC), as indicated by the distinctive increases in the distinct physical properties of the gas such as excitation temperature, column density, line width, and velocity. This collision results in an X-shape structure in the northern part of the outflow around the position of the MC, which produces spray-shocked material downstream in the north of MC as observed in position-velocity diagrams both along and across of the outflow axis. The outflow has a mass of 1.7-2.1 M$_\odot$, a momentum of 7.8-10.1 M$_\odot$ km s$^{-1}$, a kinetic energy of 5.0-6.6$\times 10^{44}$ erg, and a mass loss rate of 4.9--6.0$\times10^{-4}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. The molecular outflow from GGD 27-MM2(E) significantly perturbs and erodes its parent cloud, compressing the gas of sources such as MC and ALMA 12. The feedback from this powerful protostellar outflow contributes to maintain the turbulence in the surrounding area.

 - **Abstract**
 The objective of this study is to develop a fully compressible magnetohydrodynamic solver for fast simulations of the global dynamo of the Sun using unstructured grids and GPUs. Accurate modeling of the Sun's convective layers is vital to predicting the Sun's behavior, including the solar dynamo and sunspot cycles. Currently, there are many efficient codes capable of conducting these large simulations; however, many assume an anealastic density distribution. The anelastic assumption is capable of producing accurate results for low mach numbers; however, it fails in regions with a higher mach number and a fully compressible flow must be considered. To avoid these issues, Wang et al. [1] created a Compressible High-ORder Unstructured Spectral difference (CHORUS) code for simulating fluid dynamics inside stars and planets. CHORUS++ augmented the CHORUS code to adopt a higher degree of polynomials by using cubed-sphere meshing and transfinite mapping to perform simulations on unstructured grids [2]. Recently, CHORUS++ was further developed for parallel magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) solutions on GPUs at Clarkson University. In this study the solar benchmark problems presented by Chen et al. [2] are extended to unsteady solar dynamo problems, with two different density scale heights. The CHORUS-MHD code is further accelerated by multiple GPUs and used to successfully solve these solar dynamo benchmark problems. [1] Wang, J., Liang, C., and Miesch, M.

 - **Abstract**
 In the latter moments of 17 July 2023, the solar active region 13363, near the southwestern face of the Sun, was undergoing considerable evolution, which resulted in a significant solar energetic particle (SEP) event measured by Parker Solar Probe's Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun (ISOIS) and near-Earth spacecraft. Remote observations from GOES and CHASE captured two M5.0+ solar flares that peaked at 23:34 and 00:06 UT from the source region. In tandem, STEREO COR2 first recorded a small, narrow coronal mass ejection (CME) emerging at 22:54 UT and then saw a major halo CME emerge at 23:43 UT with a bright, rapidly expanding core and CME-driven magnetic shock with an estimated speed of $\sim$1400 $kms^{-1}$. Parker Solar Probe was positioned at 0.65 au, near-perfectly on the nominal Parker spiral magnetic field line which connected Earth and the active region for a 537 $kms^{-1}$ ambient solar wind speed at L1. This fortuitous alignment provided the opportunity to examine how the SEP velocity dispersion, energy spectra, elemental composition, and fluence varied from 0.65 to 1 au along a shared magnetic connection to the Sun. We find a strong radial gradient, which is best characterized for H and He as $r^{-4.0}$ and most surprisingly is stronger for O and Fe which is better described by $r^{-5.7}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Recurrent and propagating intensity perturbations are frequently observed in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) channels along coronal fan loops above sunspots, and these perturbations are suggested to be slow magnetoacoustic waves. Numerous studies have been conducted to investigate their propagation speeds, damping, and excitation sources; however, there have been limited observational analyses on whether these waves are dispersive despite some theoretical studies. In this study, we apply cross-correlation analysis in the Fourier domain on slow magnetoacoustic waves using three different datasets: EUV intensity observed by SDO/AIA, differential emission measure (DEM) temperature maps, and Doppler velocities from Hinode/EIS spectrometer observations. The apparent phase velocities of the waves, which are the plane-of-sky component of the waves' phase velocities, are derived as functions of frequency for all the three datasets. It is found that the phase velocities show clear frequency dependency, with a general trend of increase with frequency, ranging from approximately 30 km/s around 3 mHz to about 80 km/s around 10 mHz. The frequency dependency of the phase velocities demonstrates that the slow magnetoacoustic waves in the coronal loops are dispersive. The dispersiveness of these waves can provide a useful tool for the diagnosis of physical conditions inside the coronal loops along which these waves travel.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar active regions (ARs) are the places hosting the majority of solar eruptions. Studying the evolution and morphological features of ARs is not only of great significance to the understanding of the physical mechanisms of solar eruptions, but also beneficial for the hazardous space weather forecast. An automated DBSCAN-based Solar Active Regions Detection (DSARD) method for solar ARs observed in magnetograms is developed in this work, which is based on an unsupervised machine learning algorithm called Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN). The method is then employed to identify ARs on the magnetograms observed by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) during solar cycle 24 and the rising phase of solar cycle 25. The distributions of the number, area, magnetic flux, and the tilt angle of bipolar of ARs in latitudes and time intervals during solar cycle 24, as well as the butterfly diagram and drift velocities are obtained. Most of these statistical results based on our method are in agreement with previous studies, which also guarantees the validity of the method. In particular, the dipole tilt angles in ARs in solar cycle 24 and the rising phase of solar cycle 25 are analyzed which reveal that 13% and 16% of ARs, respectively, violate Hale's law.

 - **Abstract**
 In previous works, we have shown that stars in the Orion and the Lagoon Nebula Clusters, and simulations of collapsing clouds, exhibit constant velocity dispersion as a function of mass, a result described by Lynden-Bell 50 years ago as an effect of a violent relaxation mechanism. In contrast, numerical simulations of turbulent clouds show that newborn massive stars experience stronger dynamical heating than low-mass stars. We analyzed turbulent numerical simulations and found that this effect arises from the fact that, in clouds that are globally turbulence-supported against collapse, massive stars are formed within more massive and denser clumps and in more crowded environments compared to low-mass stars. This allows them to accrete more mass and interact with other stars simultaneously. As they become more massive, their orbits tighten, increasing their velocity dispersion. In contrast, low-mass stars are formed in the periphery of such cores, more separated, and at lower densities. Thus, their velocity dispersion remains lower because they do not accrete as vigorously as massive stars and tend to be more isolated. We call this mechanism "accretion-induced orbital tightening." Our results and previous findings about violent relaxation provide a key observational diagnostic of how to distinguish the dynamic state of star-forming molecular clouds through the kinematics of their newborn stars.

 - **Abstract**
 The review aims to give an overview of atmospheric escape processes from exoplanets. I briefly discuss the physics of various escape processes responsible for atmospheric escape across different types of exoplanets. Transmission spectroscopy is one of the major workhorses to observe the escaping atmosphere from exoplanets. I discuss recent observations that established the fact that atmospheric escape is very common in exoplanets, especially during the early phase of their evolution when stellar high-energy radiation (X-ray and extreme ultraviolet, hence XUV) is strong. There are many theoretical efforts/models to understand atmospheric escape processes. Stellar radiation is one of the major drivers of atmospheric escape, but other stellar environments (e.g., stellar flares, stellar winds, stellar coronal mass ejections, and stellar magnetic field) also have control over how the escape process will be affected for a given property of exoplanet, as the planetary properties (e.g., gravity, thermal energy, magnetic field) plays an important role for atmospheric escape. I discuss all governing factors for the atmospheric escape process and corresponding theoretical models in detail. I also discuss how atmospheric escape plays a crucial role in the overall atmospheric evolution of exoplanets and can lead us to understand some features in recently observed exoplanet demographics.

 - **Abstract**
 Late-type stars are known to host numerous exoplanets, and their photometric variability, primarily caused by rotational modulation, provides a unique opportunity to study starspots. As exoplanets transit in front of their host stars, they may occult darker, spotted regions on the stellar surfaces. The monitoring of starspots from planetary transits, known as transit mapping, offers a possibility to detect small dark regions on magnetically active, late-type stars. These spots may be so small that they would be undetectable to other methods used to reconstruct stellar magnetic activity. We describe a Bayesian analysis framework on the transit light curves of planets orbiting K- and M-type main-sequence stars in search for spot occultation event candidates. We present a systematic analysis of high-precision, high-cadence light curves from Kepler and TESS to detect and characterise starspots during exoplanetary transits. According to our tests, the set of criteria applied in the analysis is robust and not prone to false positives. Our sample comprises K- and M-dwarfs hosting transiting exoplanets observed by the Kepler or TESS space telescopes at a high cadence, totalling 99 planets meeting our selection criteria. After analysing 3273 transit light curves from 99 planets, we find 105 candidates for starspot occultation events by six planets. We report new spot occultation candidates for the K-dwarfs HD 189733 and TOI-1268. The identified dark regions have a lower limit for radii between 1.6 degrees and 29.5 degrees and contrasts up to 0.69. We estimate a spot detection frequency of 3.7% and 4.2% for K- and M-dwarfs by TESS, and 37.5% for K-dwarfs by Kepler.

 - **Abstract**
 Nest200047 is a clear example of multiple radio bubbles from an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) in a galaxy group, featuring non-thermal filaments likely shaped by buoyancy, gas motions, and stabilized by magnetic fields. This study presents high-quality data obtained from uGMRT, MeerKAT, and VLA, alongside existing LOFAR data, to analyze the system's morphology and spectrum over a broad frequency range (53-1518 MHz). Our findings reveal new filamentary emission in the inner 60 kpc, surrounding and extending from the inner bubbles and jets, suggesting complex dynamical evolution of the non-thermal plasma in the group core. The filaments have widths of a few kpc and lengths from tens to hundreds of kpc, with a steep and curved radio spectrum ($\rm \alpha=1\sim2$). They exhibit a constant spectral index profile along their length, implying particles are either (re-)accelerated together or move at super-Alfvenic speeds. Spectral aging analysis yields jet active times between 50 and 100 Myr with short inactive phases, suggesting continuous energy injection typical of AGN feedback in galaxy groups. This study highlights the potential of combining high-quality radio data to understand recurrent jet activity and feedback, with implications for future research with the SKA observatory.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are manifestations of energy release in the solar atmosphere, which can be accompanied by dynamic mass motions and waves in the surrounding atmosphere. Here, we present observations of plasma moving in a helical trajectory along a set of coronal loops formed following the eruption of a CME on 2024 May 14. This helical motion was observed in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) images from the Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO), which provides new insights into plasma properties in a set of post-eruption coronal loops. We utilize images from the SDO Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) instrument to track the helical motion of plasma and to characterize its speed, acceleration, and physical properties. Additionally, we explore the evolution of the plasma density and temperature along the helical structure using the differential emission measure technique. The helical structure was visible in AIA for approximately 22 minutes, having a diameter of 22 Mm, and a total trajectory of nearly 184 Mm. Analysis of the AIA observations reveals that the plasma flow along this helical coronal loop exhibits speeds of 77-384 km s$^{-1}$ and temperatures ranging from 3.46 to 10.2 MK. Additionally, the densities were estimated to be between 4.3.106 and 1.55.107 cm-3, with an estimated magnetic field strength of 0.05-0.3 G. Following the launch of a CME, we find clear evidence for impulsive heating and expansion of plasma that travels a helical trajectory along a set of post-eruption loops. These observations provide an insight into impulsive plasma flows along coronal loops and indeed the topology of coronal loops.

 - **Abstract**
 We identify galaxies hosting ionised-gas high-velocity outflows from the complete sample of medium resolution (R1000) JWST/NIRSpec MSA spectroscopy taken as part of the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES). From a total sample of 1087 [OIII]5007 emitters we identify 40 galaxies with a blue-side broadened [OIII]5007 line at z=2.5-9. Of these, 34 are strong outflow candidates whilst 6 sources have broadening potentially driven by rotating clumps. Our outflow candidate sample is mainly composed of star-forming galaxies, including ~65 starbursts, which span the stellar mass range log10(M*/Msun)=7.5-11.0. It also includes two candidate type-2 active galactic nuclei (AGN) and a 'little red dot' (LRD). We report a median outflow velocity of 531(+146)(-159) km/s and an overall incidence rate of 3.4%. These values are significantly higher and lower respectively than recent similar works, which we accredit to the limiting resolution of the R1000 spectroscopy and a stricter outflow selection criterion. We find no correlation between the outflow velocity and the galaxy stellar mass or star-formation rate. The median ratio between outflow velocity and escape velocity is 0.77(+0.36)(-0.32), indicating that most outflows cannot escape the galaxy gravitational potentials. We do find an anti-correlation between mass loading factor and stellar mass up to M* ~(10^10)Msun, with most lowest stellar-mass M*<(10^9)Msun galaxies reaching values well above unity, as is the case for local starburst galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the evolution of the complex magnetic fields found in solar active regions is an active area of research. There are numerous models for such fields which range in their complexity due to the number of known physical effects included in them, the one common factor being they all extrapolate the field up from the photosphere. In this study we focus on the fact that, above the photosphere, and below the corona, lies the relatively cool and dense chromosphere -- which is often neglected in coronal models due to it being comparatively thin and difficult hard to model. We isolate and examine the effect including this boundary layer has on a 2.5D class of driven MHD models of an active region eruption. We find that it can result in significant changes to the dynamics of an erupting field far higher in the atmosphere than the chromosphere itself, generally delaying eruption and increasing the magnetic energy released in each eruption. We also test whether these effects can be approximated using a variation of the more computationally efficient magnetofrictional model, finding a number of simple adaptations of the standard magnetofrictional model capture the effect the chromospheric stratification well.

 - **Abstract**
 Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are the eruptions of magnetised plasma from the Sun and are considered the main driver of adverse space weather events. Hence, undrstanding its formation process, particularly the magnetic topology, is critical for accurate space weather prediction. Here, based on imaging observations and three-dimensional (3D) data-constrained thermodynamic magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulation in spherical coordinates, we exhibit the birth of a CME with intricate magnetic structure from multiple active regions (ARs) due to 3D magnetic reconnection. It is observed as a coronal jet between active regions, accompanied by the back-flowing of filament materials along the jet spine after the passage of the eruptive filament. This jet connects two dimming regions within different active regions. This is an observational proxy of 3D magnetic reconnection between the CME flux rope and the null-point magnetic field lines crossing active regions. Hereafter, the thermodynamic data-constrained MHD simulation successfully reproduces the observed jet and the reconnection process that flux ropes partake in, leading to a CME flux rope with a complex magnetic structure distinct from its progenitor. The generality of this scenario is then validated by data-inspired MHD simulations in a simple multipolar magnetic configuration. This work demonstrates the role of multiple active regions in forming CMEs with intricate magnetic structures. On the one hand, a non-coherent flux rope where not all twisted magnetic field lines wind around one common axis is naturally formed. On the other hand, our findings suggest that the topology of a real CME flux rope may not be solely determined by a single active region, particularly during periods of solar maximum.
#### Galactic foreground emissions randomization due to chaotic/turbulent dynamics of magnetized plasma dominated by magnetic helicity

 - **Abstract**
 Using results of numerical simulations and astrophysical observations (mainly in the WMAP and Planck frequency bands) it is shown that Galactic foreground emission becomes more sensitive to the mean magnetic field with the frequency, that results in the appearance of two levels of its randomization due to chaotic/turbulent dynamics of magnetized interstellar medium dominated by the magnetic helicity. The galactic foreground emission is more randomized at higher frequencies. The Galactic synchrotron and polarized dust emissions have been studied in detail. It is shown that the magnetic field imposes its level of randomization on the synchrotron and dust emission. The main method for the theoretical consideration used in this study is the Kolmogorov-Iroshnikov phenomenology in the frames of distributed chaos notion. Despite the vast differences in the values of physical parameters and spatio-temporal scales between the numerical simulations and the astrophysical observations, there is a quantitative agreement between the results of the astrophysical observations and the numerical simulations in the frames of the distributed chaos notion.

 - **Abstract**
 At least some short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) originate from neutron star mergers, systems that release both a relativistic collimated jet and slower, wider ejecta. These jets evolve through a dense, anisotropic medium shaped by the merger process, resulting in interactions that affect their morphology and observable signatures. We investigate the propagation of SGRB jets through funnel-like structures that can be static or expanding with mildly relativistic speed using 2D axisymmetric relativistic hydrodynamic simulations. Our models are based on radial and angular distributions of density and pressure from general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of binary neutron star mergers. We explore different values of the funnel opening angle and density contrast, observing that narrow funnels constrain jet expansion, leading to larger collimation. The polar structure of the ejecta mainly affects the jet evolution in the early stages, whereas the effect of expanding ejecta dominates in later stages. Jets propagating through a low-dense polar funnel move initially faster, while the presence of mildly relativistic ejecta maintains the outflow more collimated after the breakout. Our results highlight the importance of the structure and dynamical properties of the ejecta in shaping SGRB jets and their electromagnetic emission.
