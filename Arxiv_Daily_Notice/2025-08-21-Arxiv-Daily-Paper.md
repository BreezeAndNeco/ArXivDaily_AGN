 - **Abstract**
 This paper introduces a high resolution, machine learning-ready heliophysics dataset derived from NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), specifically designed to advance machine learning (ML) applications in solar physics and space weather forecasting. The dataset includes processed imagery from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) and Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI), spanning a solar cycle from May 2010 to July 2024. To ensure suitability for ML tasks, the data has been preprocessed, including correction of spacecraft roll angles, orbital adjustments, exposure normalization, and degradation compensation. We also provide auxiliary application benchmark datasets complementing the core SDO dataset. These provide benchmark applications for central heliophysics and space weather tasks such as active region segmentation, active region emergence forecasting, coronal field extrapolation, solar flare prediction, solar EUV spectra prediction, and solar wind speed estimation. By establishing a unified, standardized data collection, this dataset aims to facilitate benchmarking, enhance reproducibility, and accelerate the development of AI-driven models for critical space weather prediction tasks, bridging gaps between solar physics, machine learning, and operational forecasting.

 - **Abstract**
 Heliophysics is central to understanding and forecasting space weather events and solar activity. Despite decades of high-resolution observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), most models remain task-specific and constrained by scarce labeled data, limiting their capacity to generalize across solar phenomena. We introduce Surya, a 366M parameter foundation model for heliophysics designed to learn general-purpose solar representations from multi-instrument SDO observations, including eight Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) channels and five Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) products. Surya employs a spatiotemporal transformer architecture with spectral gating and long--short range attention, pretrained on high-resolution solar image forecasting tasks and further optimized through autoregressive rollout tuning. Zero-shot evaluations demonstrate its ability to forecast solar dynamics and flare events, while downstream fine-tuning with parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) shows strong performance on solar wind forecasting, active region segmentation, solar flare forecasting, and EUV spectra. Surya is the first foundation model in heliophysics that uses time advancement as a pretext task on full-resolution SDO data. Its novel architecture and performance suggest that the model is able to learn the underlying physics behind solar evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Energy awareness and efficiency policies are gaining more attention, over pure performance (time-to-solution) Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) when comparing the possibilities offered by accelerated systems. But in a field such as numerical astrophysics, which is struggling with code refactorings for GPUs, viable porting paths have to be shown before first. After summarizing the status and recurring problems of astrophysical code accelerations, we highlight how the field would benefit from portable, vendor-agnostic GPU portings. We then employ the DPEcho SYCL benchmark to compare raw performance and energy efficiency for heterogeneous hardware on a realistic application, with the goal of helping computational astrophysicists and HPC providers make informed decisions on the most suitable hardware. Aside from GPUs showing higher efficiency, we argue on the more informative nature of energy-aware KPIs, in that they convey the specific device performance in a data-driven way. We also present a convenient, flexible and cross-platform energy-measuring pipeline. Finally, we contextualize our results through measures with different compilers, presenting device (at the cores) versus node (at the plug) energy and comparing DPEcho with the High- Performance Linpack (HPL) benchmark.

 - **Abstract**
 The search for habitable conditions beyond Earth is a top priority in astrophysics. The discovery of habitable exoplanets beyond our solar system will require a suite of instruments providing long-term monitoring for detection (e.g. with space and ground-based radial velocity observations), spectroscopic characterization of atmospheric and surface properties, and eventually deep chronograph-aided observations from e.g. JWST, Roman Space Telescope, and the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). Detection of exoplanet magnetospheres is necessary to identify the most promising targets for follow-up characterization of biosignatures with these assets, and to provide an ensemble of objects for studies of magnetospheric conditions and atmospheric composition. Only observations of low-frequency radio emission will distinguish exoplanet magnetospheres (Hallinan et al. 2021). In this white paper, we present the two lunar radio array concepts under development that would be suitable to detect these exoplanet radio emissions. In addition, we also discuss the human exploration needed prior to construction of such lunar radio arrays while highlighting preferred candidate sites (Krolikowski & Elvis 2024) for the radio telescope.

 - **Abstract**
 The solar disk is a continuous source of GeV--TeV gamma rays. The emission is thought to originate from hadronic Galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) interacting with the gas in the photosphere and uppermost convection zone after being reflected by solar magnetic fields. Despite this general understanding, existing theoretical models have yet to match observational data. At the photosphere and the uppermost convection zone, granular convection drives a multi-scale magnetic field, forming a larger-scale filamentary structure while also generating turbulence-scale Alfvén wave turbulence. Here, we demonstrate that the larger-scale filamentary field shapes the overall gamma-ray emission spectrum, and the Alfvén wave turbulence is critical for further suppressing the gamma-ray emission spectrum below $\sim 100$~GeV. For a standard Alfvén wave turbulence level, our model's predicted spectrum slope from 1~GeV to 1~TeV is in excellent agreement with observations from Fermi-LAT and HAWC, an important achievement. The predicted absolute flux is a factor of 2--5 lower than the observed data; we outline future directions to resolve this discrepancy. The key contribution of our work is providing a new theoretical framework for using solar disk gamma-ray observations to probe hadronic GCR transport in the lower solar atmosphere.

 - **Abstract**
 The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has discovered a new population of objects, the Little Red Dots (LRDs), characterized by V-shaped spectra indicative of strong breaks around the Balmer limit and compact morphology that gave them their name. A popular explanation is that they are a sub-population of active galactic nuclei/supermassive black holes (AGN/SMBHs) predominantly found in the high-redshift Universe ($z\gtrsim3$). Similarly, direct collapse black holes (DCBHs), theorized to form from collapsing massive, extremely metal-poor gas clouds, have been invoked to explain high-redshift quasars, the most massive AGN sub-population. Here, we employ the semi-analytical code A-SLOTH to produce a population of DCBHs and compare them against observed LRD demographics and properties. Specifically, we compare the DCBH-seeded SMBH population against the standard stellar-remnant seeds and find that DCBH models agree better with observed LRD population statistics and host halo properties. Furthermore, for the most extreme and earliest LRD detections, interpreted to be systems with an AGN but little stellar component, DCBHs are able to reproduce the observed spectral shape and properties under multiple scenarios - high dust attenuation or AGN surrounded by dense gas - that have been proposed to explain the unique shape of LRD spectra. Even when super-Eddington accretion, invoked previously to explain the nature of LRDs, is enforced on stellar remnant seeds, the spectral characteristics of extreme LRDs cannot be reproduced. We emphasize the importance of gas-metallicity observations as an additional dimension besides the widely used SMBH-stellar mass ratios to further constrain the progenitors of LRDs.

 - **Abstract**
 AXIS, a Probe mission concept now in a Phase A study, will provide transformative studies of high-energy astrophysical phenomena thanks to its high-resolution X-ray spectral imaging. These capabilities are enabled by improvements to the mirror design that greatly increase the X-ray throughput per unit mass; and to the detector system, which operates more than an order of magnitude faster than heritage instruments while maintaining excellent spectral performance. We present updates to the design of the AXIS High-Speed Camera, a collaborative effort by MIT, Stanford University, the Pennsylvania State University, and the Southwest Research Institute. The camera employs large-format MIT Lincoln Laboratory CCDs that feature multiple high-speed, low-noise output amplifiers and an advanced single-layer polysilicon gate structure for fast, low-power clock transfers. A first lot of prototype CCID100 CCDs has completed fabrication and will soon begin X-ray performance testing. The CCDs are paired with high-speed, low-noise ASIC readout chips designed by Stanford to provide better performance than conventional discrete solutions at a fraction of the power consumption and footprint. Complementary Front-End Electronics employ state-of-the-art digital video waveform capture and advanced signal processing to further deliver low noise at high speed. The Back-End Electronics provide high-speed identification of candidate X-ray events and transient monitoring that relays fast alerts of changing sources to the community. We highlight updates to our parallel X-ray performance test facilities at MIT and Stanford, and review the current performance of the CCD and ASIC technology from testing of prototype devices. These measurements achieve excellent spectral response at the required readout rate, demonstrating that we will meet mission requirements and enable AXIS to achieve world-class science.
#### The implications of overmassive black holes at $z > 5$ for quasar and black hole growth

 - **Abstract**
 Recent JWST surveys of high-redshift galaxies have found surprisingly large black holes, with many being measured to be $\sim100$ times more massive than local galaxies with the same stellar mass. Here, we find that a population of these black holes would have dramatic implications for our understanding of their growth across cosmic time. We first show that the global black hole mass density at $z \sim 5$ would be comparable to local values. This would not occur if these black holes occupy a small fraction of galaxies, though it would be expected if these black holes radiate at high efficiencies (requiring that the central engines of AGN spin rapidly). We then show that the individual detected $z \sim 5$ black holes would remain overmassive compared to the local relation if they grow according to the average rates of state-of-the-art models. These systems must instead grow at least an order of magnitude more slowly than expected if they are to fall within the observed scatter of the local black hole mass-stellar mass relation. Such slow growth is surprising in comparison to other estimates of the radiative efficiency of AGN, especially because growth must be rapid at $z > 5$ in order to build up such massive black holes quickly. Finally, we highlight the challenges that overmassive black holes have on our understanding of the impact of quasar feedback on galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 Polarimetric properties of blazars allow us to put constraints on the acceleration mechanisms that fuel their powerful jets. By studying the multiwavelength polarimetric behaviour of high synchrotron peaked (HSP) and low synchrotron peaked (LSP) blazars, we aim to explore differences in their emission mechanisms and magnetic field structure in the acceleration region. In this study, we take advantage of several X-ray polarisation observations of HSP by the IXPE, including four new observations of Mrk 501, and optical polarisation observations of LSP from RoboPol and many others. We find that the polarisation degree (PD) distribution of HSP in X-rays is systematically higher than in optical and mm-radio wavelengths, as reported in previous IXPE publications. The distribution of the X-ray electric vector position angles (PA) is centered around the jet axis with most of the observations consistent with zero difference within uncertainties. In fact, the distribution of the offset of the PA from the jet axis is consistent between the LSP and HSP populations (with PA measured in optical for the first, X-ray for the latter), suggesting a common magnetic field structure close to the acceleration region, in strong support of the emerging energy stratified picture of particle acceleration followed by energy loss in blazar jets.

 - **Abstract**
 We review participatory science programs that have contributed to the understanding of star formation. The Milky Way Project (MWP), one of the earliest participatory science projects launched on the Zooniverse platform, produced the largest catalog of ``bubbles'' associated with feedback from hot young stars to date, and enabled the identification of a new class of compact star-forming regions (SFRs) known as ``yellowballs'' (YBs). The analysis of YBs through their infrared colors and catalog cross-matching led to discovering that YBs are compact photodissociation regions generated by intermediate- and high-mass young stellar objects embedded in clumps that range in mass from 10 - 10,000 solar masses and luminosity from 10 - 1,000,000 solar luminosities. The MIRION catalog, assembled from 6176 YBs identified by citizen scientists, increases the number of candidate intermediate-mass SFRs by nearly two orders of magnitude. Ongoing work utilizing data from the Spitzer, Herschel and WISE missions involves analyzing infrared color trends to predict physical properties and ages of YB environments. Methods include applying summary statistics to histograms and color-color plots as well as SED fitting. Students in introductory astronomy classes contribute toward continued efforts refining photometric measurements of YBs while learning fundamental concepts in astronomy through a classroom-based participatory science experience, the PERYSCOPE project. We also describe an initiative that engaged seminaries, family groups, and interfaith communities in a wide variety of science projects on the Zooniverse platform. This initiative produced important guidance on attracting audiences that are underserved, underrepresented, or apprehensive about science.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the analysis of one of the most extreme quasar outflows found to date in our survey of extremely high velocity outflows (EHVO). J164653.72+243942.2 (z ~ 3.04) shows variable CIV1548,1551 absorption at speeds larger than 0.1c, accompanied by SiIV, NV and Lya, and disappearing absorption at lower speeds. We perform absorption measurements using the Apparent Optical Depth method and SimBAL. We find the absorption to be very broad ({\Delta}v ~35,100 km/s in the first epoch and ~13,000 km/s in the second one) and fast (vmax ~ -50,200 km/s and -49,000 km/s, respectively). We measure large column densities ($\rm \log N_{H} >$ 21.6 $\rm\ [cm^{-2}]$) and are able to place distance estimates for the EHVO ($5\lesssim R\lesssim28$ pc) and the lower-velocity outflow ($7\lesssim R\lesssim540$ pc). We estimate a mass outflow rate for the EHVO to be $\dot M_{out}\sim50-290\rm \ M_\odot\ yr^{-1}$ and a kinetic luminosity of $\log\ L_{KE}\sim46.5-47.2\ \rm [erg\ s^{-1}$] in both epochs. The lower-velocity component has a mass outflow rate $\dot M_{out}\sim10-790\rm \ M_\odot\ yr^{-1}$ and a kinetic luminosity of $\log\ L_{KE}\sim45.3-47.2\ \rm [erg\ s^{-1]}$. We find that J164653.72+243942.2 is not an outlier among EHVO quasars in regard to its physical properties. While its column density is lower than typical BAL values, its higher outflow velocities drive most of the mass outflow rate and kinetic luminosity. These results emphasize the crucial role of EHVOs in powering quasar feedback, and failing to account for these outflows likely leads to underestimating the feedback impact on galaxies.

 REDWOODS on ShaneAO at Lick Observatory implements a second-stage, 3-sided reflective pyramid wavefront sensor (PWFS), which, under low-light conditions, offers an improved signal-to-noise ratio for deformable mirror commands to correct dynamic atmospheric aberrations. We modeled the REDWOODS limiting natural guide star magnitude. We also investigated performance tradeoffs between two PWFS modes that are available to REDWOODS, one with higher bandwidth error and another with higher aliasing error. We also implemented an experimental setup to image one of the REDWOODS PWFS masks.

 - **Abstract**
 We present optical integral-field spectroscopic data of ten nearby ($0.02\leq z \leq 0.05$) Seyfert 1 galaxies taken with the Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI). We map the spatially resolved kinematics of the [O III] gas and stars, and investigate the alignments between their global kinematic position angles (PA). Large-scale gas motions are primarily dominated by rotation, and are kinematically aligned with the stars ($\Delta\text{PA}\leq 30$ deg). However, eight galaxies exhibit non-rotational kinematic signatures (e.g., kinematic twists, possible outflows) in their ionized gas velocity fields near the nucleus. We compare aperture-wide measurements of the gas and stellar velocity dispersions ($\sigma_{\text{gas}}$ and $\sigma_\star$) to test the use of the width of the [O III] line core as a surrogate for $\sigma_\star$. Direct comparisons between $\sigma_{\text{gas}}$ and $\sigma_\star$ show that $\sigma_{\text{gas}}$ tends to underestimate $\sigma_\star$, and thus is not a reliable tracer of $\sigma_\star$ for our selected galaxies. We measure the extent of the narrow-line region (NLR) using several definitions, resulting in sizes of $\sim0.1$-$10$ kpc. For a given [O III] luminosity, our NLR sizes derived from the [O III]/H$\beta$ flux ratio or an [O III] isophotal radius are an order of magnitude larger than those measured from past imaging data.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the mass--spin diagram for classifying black holes and studying their formation pathways, providing an analogue to the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. This allows for black hole evolutionary tracks as a function of redshift, combining formation, accretion, and merger histories for the variety of black hole populations. A realistic black hole continuum constructed from initial mass and spin functions and approximate redshift evolution reveals possible black hole main sequences, such as sustained coherent accretion through cosmic time (i.e., Cosmic Accretion) or hierarchical merger trees. In the stellar-mass regime, we use a binary population synthesis software to compare three spin prescriptions for tidal evolution of Wolf-Rayet progenitors, showing how the mass--spin diagram exposes interesting modeling differences. We then classify black hole populations by applying supervised and unsupervised machine learning clustering methods to mass--spin datasets. While bare unsupervised clustering can nearly recover canonical population boundaries (stellar-mass, intermediate-mass, and supermassive), a more sophisticated approach utilizing deep learning via variational autoencoders for latent space representation learning aids in clustering of realistic datasets with subclasses that highly overlap in mass--spin space. We find that a supervised random forest can accurately recover the correct clusters from the learned latent space representation depending on the complexity of the underlying dataset, semi-supervised methods show potential for further development, and the performance of unsupervised classifiers is a great challenge. Our findings motivate future machine learning applications and demonstrate that the mass--spin diagram can be used to connect gravitational-wave and electromagnetic observations with theoretical models.

 - **Abstract**
 The Chromospheric LAyer SpectroPolarimeter missions, CLASP2 and CLASP2.1, demonstrated that the near-UV spectral region between 279.30 and 280.68 nm is suitable for studying the magnetism of the solar chromosphere. In particular, the spectropolarimetric observations in the Mg II h and k resonant doublet, Mn I 279.91 and 280.19 nm resonant lines, and Fe II 279.79 and 280.66 nm lines acquired by these suborbital space experiments have been proven useful for inferring the magnetic field stratification in the solar chromosphere. However, several lines of the CLASP2/2.1 spectral region with significant circular polarization signals had remained unexplored. After identifying two Ni I (279.95 and 280.59 nm), one Mn II (280.62 nm), and one Fe I (280.53 nm) lines, here we apply the Weak Field Approximation (WFA) to the spectropolarimetric observations of active region plages by CLASP2 and CLASP2.1. By comparing the results with previous studies, we are able to estimate the formation heights of these CLASP2/2.1 additional spectral lines and to demonstrate their suitability to determine the magnetic field stratification from the photosphere to the upper chromosphere.
#### New Insight from the James Webb Space Telescope on Variable Active Galactic Nuclei

 - **Abstract**
 Variability detected in galaxies is usually attributed to their active galactic nuclei (AGNs). While all AGNs are intrinsically variable, the classic AGN unification model predicts that type~2 AGNs rarely vary because their engines are obstructed by dust tori. Previous UV-to-near-IR variability studies largely support this expectation. Here, we present a variability study by James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) that reveals a more subtle picture. Using NIRCam imaging data from three surveys over $\sim$140~arcmin$^2$ in the COSMOS field, we found 117 galaxies with $\geq 4$$\sigma$ variability in the F356W band across a $\sim$2-year baseline. Cross-matching with existing JWST spectroscopic data in this area, we identified five of them at $z=0.19$--3.69, which were all coincidentally observed by a NIRSpec program almost contemporaneously with the last imaging epoch. One additional variable was identified at $z=0.90$ using the archival Keck telescope data. These six objects form our spectroscopic subsample. Interestingly, two reside in close-pair environments, while two others form a close pair themselves. Most of their light curves can hardly be explained by nuclear transients, and AGN variability is a more plausible cause. However, among these six objects, (1) only one shows broad permitted lines ($\Delta v > 1000$~km~s$^{-1}$) indicative of a type~1 AGN; (2) two show narrow permitted lines consistent with type~2 AGNs, with another one likely type~2 based on the host galaxy properties; and (3) two others, which form a pair, show no emission lines. Our results add more challenges to the unification model.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the cosmic expansion history within the framework of Galileon gravity by employing a redshift-based expression for the Hubble rate, $H(z)$, derived from the CPL parametrization $\omega_{DE}(z)=\omega_{0}+\omega_{a}\frac{z}{1+z}$. This parametrization allows for a time-dependent expansion history consistent with the non-linear Galileon field equations. To constrain the model parameters, we perform a MCMC analysis using $46$ Hubble parameter measurements, DESI DR2 BAO data and $1701$ Pantheon+ datasets. The best fit values obtained are $H_0 = 67.7043^{+1.4354}_{-1.4102}$ km/s/Mpc, $\Omega_{m0} = 0.2668^{+0.0212}_{-0.0217}$, $\omega_0 = -0.8827^{+0.1076}_{-0.0967}$ and $\omega_a = 0.0011^{+0.0660}_{-0.0622}$. Model comparison using information criteria yields $\Delta AIC=1.46$ and $\Delta BIC = 11.5$ indicating that the Galileon model is a strong contender to the $\Lambda$CDM model. The deceleration parameter shows a transition at $z_{tr} = 0.7873$, with $q_0 = -0.598$. Energy density and pressure remain physically viable with $\rho_{de}(z)>0$ and $p_{de}(z)<0$ with the present day equation of state $\omega(z)$ value of $-0.2915$, which suggests mild dynamical dark energy. NEC and DECare satisfied, while SEC is violated. The model yields $r_{0}=0.657$, $s_{0}=0.1173$ and Om diagnostic shows a peak value of $-0.45$ at $z = 0.377$, converging to $-1$ at late this http URL results demonstrate that Galileon gravity remains a viable and flexible alternative to $\Lambda$CDM in describing late-time cosmic acceleration.

 - **Abstract**
 We have re-processed single pulse candidates from the first four years (1997-2001) of the Parkes Multibeam receiver system observations, creating a new Parkes transient database (PTD II) that contains 165,592 single pulses from 363 known pulsars. Unlike previous databases, PTD II preserves the critical raw data segments of each detected pulse, enabling detailed analyses of emission physics while maintaining a compact size of only 1.5 GB. The database employs a sqlite3 structure organising pulsar metadata, observation files, and pulse events with their raw data stored in binary format. We provide processing tools for extracting and analysing single-pulse data, enabling fluence fitting and statistical analysis. Our pulsars exhibit diverse fluence distributions, such as log-normal, Gaussian, and unimodal. Temporal analyses reveal significant evolution in emission characteristics of several pulsars, including event rate variations spanning two orders of magnitude in PSR J1602-5100 and PSR J0942-5552. Beyond supporting fundamental pulsar emission studies, the database serves as a valuable training resource for developing new single-pulse detection algorithms in the presence of radio frequency interference.

 - **Abstract**
 NASA's Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, slated to launch in October 2026, will serve a critical role in the characterization and threat assessment of near-Earth Objects (NEOs), thus contributing to national and international planetary defense objectives. Operating from the Earth-Sun L2 point and observing in the near-infrared, Roman has the high sensitivity and high spatial resolution needed to measure the physical properties, compositions, and orbital trajectories of NEOs in order to understand their physical nature and potential hazards to Earth. Roman's planetary defense capabilities complement those of two wide-field survey missions: the now operational ground-based Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time and the upcoming space-based NEO Surveyor. Rubin, observing in visible light, will discover over 100,000 NEOs. NEO Surveyor, observing in the mid-infrared where NEO thermal emission peaks, will detect 200,000-300,000 NEOs, some as small as ~20 meters in diameter. With investment in developing the pipeline infrastructure required to extract information from moving target streaks, Roman will be able to observe NEOs down to the smallest sizes in order to improve our measurements of NEO orbits by 2-3 orders of magnitude, enable accurate diameter and albedo estimates in conjunction with NEO Surveyor, and reveal the spectral types and bulk compositions of the smallest NEOs. Together, these three US-led facilities will operate across the electromagnetic spectrum to form a comprehensive planetary defense network.

 - **Abstract**
 Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) typically exhibit a three-component structure in white-light (WL) coronagraphs. Utilizing the seamless observations of the inner corona ($\le$ 3 R$_\odot$), we have revealed the early evolution of the cavity and core of a CME starting at $\sim$18:20 UT on 2014 October 14. The CME originates from a hot channel (HC), which appears as the bright core and compresses the cavity in WL images. Specifically, most of the dark cavity in WL is filled by bright loop-like structures in 174 Å. The differential emission measure (DEM) analysis indicates that the electron temperature decreases from the core ($\sim$13.4 MK) to the cavity ($\sim$1.35 MK), and the CME cavity is significantly cooler than that enshrouding a prominence ($\ge$ 2 MK). The effective temperature of the cavity increases over time in general, probably due to the compression by the HC expansion. The evolution of the CME bright core includes slow-rise, fast-rise (up to $\sim$330 km s$^{-1}$), and residual-acceleration phases. The cavity exhibits an evolution similar to the core but lags by $\sim$4 minutes, with a lower speed peaking at $\sim$220 km s$^{-1}$. Moreover, the 2D radial speed distribution exhibits the highest speeds at the core apex. The kinematical results further confirm the compression of the cavity. The present event supports the new explanation of the CME structures, i.e., the magnetic flux rope (MFR), which is proxied by the HC, is only responsible for the core, while the cavity is likely a low-density region between the CME front and the MFR.
#### A unified picture of swirl-driven coronal heating: magnetic energy supply and dissipation

 - **Abstract**
 The coronal heating problem is one of the most critical challenges in solar physics. Recent observations have revealed that small-scale swirls are ubiquitous in the photosphere and chromosphere, suggesting that they may play a significant role in transferring magnetic energy into the corona. However, the overall contribution of swirls to the total magnetic energy supply and subsequent coronal heating remains uncertain. To address this, we perform statistical analyses of simulated swirls using a three-dimensional radiative magnetohydrodynamic simulation extending from the convection zone to the corona in the quiet Sun. Our results reveal that swirls account for approximately half of the total magnetic energy. Furthermore, they strongly suggest that swirls can trigger coronal heating events through magnetic reconnection. The occurrence frequency of these events follows a power-law-like distribution, consistent with observations of coronal heating signatures known as "nanoflares", indicating that swirls are promising candidates as their drivers.
#### Reconstruction of X-Ray Afterglow Light Curves of GRBs and its implication for constraining Cosmological Parameters

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) serve as important cosmological probes, whose X-ray afterglow light curves (LCs) may exhibit a plateau phase (with temporal slope $\alpha$ between 0 and 0.5) that may originate from magnetar energy injection. Similar to Type Ia Supernovae, GRBs with a common physical origin can be used as standardizable candles for cosmological studies. However, observational gaps in GRB light curves introduce significant uncertainties in plateau parameter estimation, thereby affecting cosmological constraints. In this work, we employ a stochastic reconstruction technique to reconstruct the X-ray afterglow LCs for 35 GRB samples exhibiting plateau features, generating 50 simulated data points for each LC. Using the reconstructed LCs, we calibrate three luminosity correlations: the $L_0$-$t_b$, $L_0$-$t_b$-$E_{p,i}$, and $L_0$-$t_b$-$E_{\gamma,\mathrm{iso}}$ relation, which are then applied to constrain both flat and non-flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmological models. The main results include: (i) the $L_0$-$t_b$ relation yields a slope $b \approx -1$, supporting a constant magnetar energy injection rate; (ii) light curve reconstruction has limited impact on cosmological parameter constraints; (iii) for the flat $\Lambda$CDM model constrained by the $L_0$-$t_b$-$E_{p,i}$ relation, the precision of $\Omega_m$ improves by 6.25\%; For the non-flat $\Lambda$CDM model constrained by the $L_0$-$t_b$-$E_{p,i}$ relation, the precision of $\Omega_\Lambda$ improves by 1.01\%. Our findings suggest that increasing the number of LC data points provides limited improvement to cosmological constraints, while expanding the sample size of GRBs with identical physical origins may be more crucial.

 - **Abstract**
 The polarized emission of astrophysical masers, especially OH and methanol lines, is an effective tool to study the magnetic field in high-mass star-forming regions. The magnetic field strength measurement via the Zeeman effect of OH maser emission is well established, but that of the methanol maser emission is still under debate because of its complex hyperfine structure. We aim to identify the dominating hyperfine transition of the Class II methanol maser emission by comparing the magnetic field strength measured with the excited OH maser emission and the Zeeman splitting of the methanol maser emission. We used quasi-simultaneous EVN observations of the two maser emissions at 6.035 GHz ex-OH and 6.668 GHz methanol toward two well-known high-mass young stellar objects: ON 1 and W75N. The observations were performed in full polarimetric mode and in phase-referencing mode to couple the maser features of the two maser emissions in each source. We detected linearly and circularly polarized emission in both maser transitions and HMYSOs. Specifically, we measured the magnetic field strength in twelve and five ex-OH maser features toward ON1 and W75N, respectively, and the Zeeman splitting of the methanol maser spectra in one and three maser features toward ON 1 and W75N, respectively. We determined that the two maser emissions likely probe the same magnetic field but at different densities. Indeed, a direct comparison of the magnetic field strength and the Zeeman splitting as measured with the ex-OH and methanol maser spots, respectively, provided values of the Zeeman splitting coefficient for the 6.7 GHz maser that do not match any of the table values present in the literature. We are not able to uniquely identify the dominating hyperfine transition; however, through density considerations, we can narrow the choice down to three hyperfine transitions: 3->4, 6->7A, and 7->8.

 - **Abstract**
 Molecular clouds (MCs) are cradles of star and planet formation, thereby playing an important role in the evolution of galaxies. Based on the unbiased Milky Way Imaging Scroll Painting (MWISP) survey data of $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, and C$^{18}$O (J=1--0) line emission in two regions toward the inner and outer Galaxy, i.e. the G50 ($44.75°\le l \le 60.25°$) and G120 ($119.75°\le l \le 130.25°$) regions, the distribution of molecular gas is studied. Both regions have Galactic latitudes of $|b| \le 5.25°$. A catalog containing 24724 MCs is constructed from the data. In our proximity, several molecular structures with large angular scales and small velocity dispersions are discovered, resembling curtains of mist. Beyond the nearby molecular gas, a clear aggregation of MCs along coherent structures in the Galactic plane is visible, sketching spiral arm structures. Nevertheless, the aggregation of MCs is also detected in the inter-arm region between the Perseus and Outer arms in the G50 region. The Galactic molecular disk in this inter-arm region is found to be thinner than that in the adjacent spiral arm region. In addition, the thickness of the Galactic molecular disk examined here is found to be correlated with the warp of it, indicating their homologous origins. The molecular disk has a typical thickness of ~220 pc in the inner Galaxy. Moreover, the dispersion of the MC systemic velocity decreases with increasing galactocentric radius, resulting in lower kinematic distance uncertainties at larger radii. However, the Perseus arm segment in the G120 region exhibits a relatively large cloud-to-cloud velocity dispersion and split components in its MC velocity distribution.

 - **Abstract**
 Strong gravitational lensing offers a powerful and direct probe of dark matter, galaxy evolution and cosmology, yet strong lenses are rare: only 1 in roughly 10,000 massive galaxies can lens a background source into multiple images. The European Space Agency's Euclid telescope, with its unique combination of high-resolution imaging and wide-area sky coverage, is set to transform this field. In its first quick data release, covering just 0.45% of the full survey area, around 500 high-quality strong lens candidates have been identified using a synergy of machine learning, citizen science and expert visual inspection. This dataset includes exotic systems such as compound lenses and edge-on disk lenses, demonstrating Euclid's capacity to probe the lens parameter space. The machine learning models developed to discover strong lenses in Euclid data are able to find lenses with high purity rates, confirming that the mission's forecast of discovering over 100,000 strong lenses is achievable during its 6-year mission. This will increase the number of known strong lenses by two orders of magnitude, transforming the science that can be done with strong lensing.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the early radio detection and multi-wavelength modeling of the short gamma-ray burst (GRB) 231117A at redshift $z=0.257$. The Australia Telescope Compact Array automatically triggered a 9-hour observation of GRB 231117A at 5.5 and 9 GHz following its detection by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory just 1.3 hours post-burst. Splitting this observation into 1-hour time bins, the early radio afterglow exhibited flaring, scintillating and plateau phases. The scintillation allowed us to place the earliest upper limit ($<10$ hours) on the size of a GRB blast wave to date, constraining it to $<1\times10^{16}$ cm. Multi-wavelength modeling of the full afterglow required a period of significant energy injection between $\sim 0.02$ and $1$ day. The energy injection was modeled as a violent collision of two shells: a reverse shock passing through the injection shell explains the early radio plateau, while an X-ray flare is consistent with a shock passing through the leading impulsive shell. Beyond 1 day, the blast wave evolves as a classic decelerating forward shock with an electron distribution index of $p=1.66\pm0.01$. Our model also indicates a jet-break at $\sim2$ days, and a half-opening angle of $\theta_j=16\mathring{.}6 \pm 1\mathring{.}1$. Following the period of injection, the total energy is $\zeta\sim18$ times the initial impulsive energy, with a final collimation-corrected energy of $E_{\mathrm{Kf}}\sim5.7\times10^{49}$ erg. The minimum Lorentz factors this model requires are consistent with constraints from the early radio measurements of $\Gamma>35$ to $\Gamma>5$ between $\sim0.1$ and $1$ day. These results demonstrate the importance of rapid and sensitive radio follow-up of GRBs for exploring their central engines and outflow behaviour.
#### The differences in the Narrow Line Region of nearby QSOs 1 and 2 -- I: higher excitation and contribution of shocks in type 1's

 - **Abstract**
 We compare the excitation of the Narrow-Line Region (NLR) of type 1 and type 2 QSOs for redshifts $0.4 \le z \le 0.5$ via the analysis of their emission line properties in Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) near-UV/optical spectra. We fit the continuum and emission lines, using two kinematic components for \oiii$\lambda$5007 and \hb\ (narrow and broad) and a single component for the weaker lines. We find two main differences in the NLR excitation of type 1 and 2 QSOs: (i) QSOs 2 have higher \oiii/\hb\ than QSOs 1 in both narrow and broad components; (ii) QSOs 1 present higher \nev, \neiii\ and \oiii$\lambda4363$ luminosities, higher \nev/\neiii\ and \neiii/\oii\ ratios and higher temperatures than QSOs 2. These differences support more highly excited regions, higher temperature gas and prevalence of shocks in type 1 relative to type 2 QSOs. We suggest two possible scenarios: (i) type 1 QSOs are seen more pole-on, allowing the observation of more highly excited gas closer to the nucleus, supporting the Unified Model scenario; (ii) evolution from type 2 to type 1 QSOs, with highest excitation regions obscured in type 2's and cleared up in a ``blow-out phase". Support for the evolutionary scenario is given by the usually higher L\oiii\ in QSOs 2, in the sense that these sources host a more powerful AGN that, in its evolution, clears up the excess dust and gas to reveal a lower-luminosity but more highly excited type 1 AGN.

 - **Abstract**
 The Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) has been tidally shaped by the interaction with the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The scope of such an interaction has recently been studied from different astrophysical properties of its star cluster population, which point to star clusters placed remarkably outside the known extension of the galaxy. In this work we report results for three of the recently identified most external SMC star clusters, OGLE-CL-SMC0133, OGLE-CL-SMC0237, and Lindsay~116, using deep GEMINI GMOS imaging. Once we confidently cleaned their color-magnitude diagrams from field star contamination, we estimated their fundamental parameters applying likelihood techniques. We also derived their structural parameters from normalized star number density radial profiles. Based on {\it Gaia} astrometric data, complemented with kinematics information available in the literature, we computed the 3D components of their space velocities. With similar ages (~ 2.2 Gyr) and moderately metal-poor overall abundances ([Fe/H] = -1.0 - -0.7 dex), OGLE-CL-SMC0237 is placed at 2.6 kpc from the SMC center and shares its disk rotation; OGLE-CL-SMC0133 is located at 7.6 kpc from the galaxy center and exhibits a kinematics marginally similar to the SMC rotation disk, while Lindsay~116 placed at 15.7 kpc from the center of the SMC is facing strong perturbations of its orbital motion with respect to an ordered rotational trajectory. Furthermore, its internal dynamical evolution would seem to be accelerated -- it seems kinematically older -- in comparison with star clusters in the outskirts of relatively isolated galaxies. These outcomes lead to conclude that Lindsay~116 is subject to LMC tides.

 - **Abstract**
 Cooling flows are observed in X-ray studies of the centres of cool core clusters, galaxy groups and individual elliptical galaxies. They are partly hidden from direct view by embedded cold gas so have been called Hidden Cooling Flows. X-ray spectra from the XMM RGS reveal emission from hot gas modified by photoelectric absorption by cold gas intrinsic to the flow. Here we present the spectral analysis of 6 more low redshift galaxy groups ranging from the nearest fossil group to 2 groups hosting bright radio sources. All reveal absorbed cooling flows. AGN feedback is ineffective in heating the inner cooling gas in groups and elliptical galaxies. We have extended the analysis to include 3 nearby spiral galaxies (the Sombrero, Whirlpool and Sculptor galaxies). They have similar absorbed soft X-ray spectra to elliptical galaxies and may also host cooling flows of 0.3 to 1.1\Msun/yr in their CircumGalactic Medium.

 - **Abstract**
 Elemental abundance diagnostics in the solar corona are crucial for understanding energy transport, plasma heating, and magnetic activity. Most earlier imaging-spectroscopic studies have relied on slit-based spectrometers, which offer high spectral resolution but are limited in spatiotemporal coverage and temperature diagnostics. In contrast, slitless spectrographs like the Marshall Grazing Incidence X-ray Spectrometer (MaGIXS) produce overlapping spatial-spectral data (overlappograms) to enable wide-field imaging spectroscopy with broader temperature coverage. However, extracting elemental abundances from overlappogram data remains inherently challenging due to spatial and spectral confusion. In this work, we present a proof-of-concept technique for elemental abundance diagnostics from overlappograms, demonstrating its feasibility with simulated MaGIXS-2 observations.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the third installment of the Alma Luminous Star (ALS) catalogue, aimed at creating the most comprehensive and clean sample of Galactic massive stars. This update extends the sample by adding approximately 2000 OB stars, incorporating astrometric and photometric data from the Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) alongside spectroscopic information from the Galactic O-Star Catalog based on recent ground-based spectroscopic surveys. Rigorous astrometric corrections are applied to Gaia DR3 parallaxes, proper motions, and photometry, ensuring accurate distance estimates through a Bayesian method suited to this stellar population's spatial distribution in the Milky Way. We perform some comparative analyses highlighting the improved distance accuracy over previous versions, underscore the importance of precise spectral classifications with competing catalogues, and identify areas for improvement in Gaia DR3 effective temperature and extinction estimates for massive stars. We also address the challenges of having robust definitions for these objects. In addition, we explore the catalogue's ability to trace Galactic features such as spiral arms, spurs and OB associations (with some insights on the nature of Gould's Belt). Finally, we discuss the potential for further expanding the sample with upcoming surveys. This effort marks a significant advancement in the creation of a reliable census of Galactic massive stars, contributing to our understanding of the Milky Way's structure and star formation history. This catalogue should serve as a valuable reference for the massive star community, supporting research on stellar interiors, winds, stellar feedback, and other processes that make OB stars key to the evolution of galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 Relativistic magnetic reconnection has been proposed as an important nonthermal particle acceleration (NTPA) mechanism that generates power-law spectra and high-energy emissions. Power-law particle spectra are in general characterized by three parameters: the power-law index, the high-energy cutoff, and the low-energy cutoff (i.e., the injection energy). Particle injection into the nonthermal power law, despite also being a critical step in the NTPA chain, has received considerably less attention than the subsequent acceleration to high energies. Open questions on particle injection that are important for both physical understanding and astronomical observations include how the upstream magnetization~$\sigma$ influences the injection energy and the contributions of the known injection mechanisms (i.e., direct acceleration by the reconnection electric field, Fermi kicks, and pickup acceleration) to the injected particle population. Using fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations, we uncover these relationships by systematically measuring the injection energy and calculating the contributions of each acceleration mechanism to the total injected particle population. We also present a theoretical model to explain these results. Additionally, we compare 2D and 3D simulations to assess the impact of the flux-rope kink and drift-kink instability on particle injection. We conclude with comparisons to previous work and outlook for future work.

 - **Abstract**
 This work investigates the initial mass and chemical evolution history of the Gaia-Enceladus dwarf galaxy. We combine spectroscopic data from APOGEE with astrometric data from Gaia DR3 to identify Gaia-Enceladus candidate stars via a machine-learning pipeline using t-SNE and HDBSCAN. By focusing on kinematic and chemical parameters, especially $\mathrm{[Fe/H]}$, $\mathrm{[Mg/Fe]}$, $\mathrm{[Al/Fe]}$, and $\mathrm{[Mn/Fe]}$, we uncover a population of metal-poor, high-eccentricity stars that align with literature criteria for Gaia-Enceladus debris. We then apply the \textit{OMEGA+} chemical evolution model, incorporating MCMC fitting of the observed abundance trends in the $\mathrm{[Mg/Fe]\times[Fe/H]}$ plane. Our best-fitting model indicates a gas mass of $4.93_{-0.72}^{+0.32}\times10^9\,{M_{\odot}}$ for Gaia-Enceladus, placing it at the higher end of previously suggested mass ranges. The model scenario suggests a short star formation timescale, substantial outflows, and a rapid build-up of metals mainly driven by core-collapse supernovae, with a lesser contribution from Type~Ia supernovae. Comparison with observational data in other chemical planes (e.g., $\mathrm{[Mg/Mn]\times[Al/Fe]}$) supports this scenario, emphasizing a distinct evolution path relative to the Milky Way. Additionally, our results provide indirect evidence that star formation in Gaia-Enceladus likely ceased within the first 4 Gyr, consistent with earlier inferences of an early merger event. These findings highlight the power of chemical evolution modeling in reconstructing the origin and mass of ancient accreted systems. Overall, we show that Gaia-Enceladus, through a rapid star formation and strong outflows, contributed a significant fraction of the metal-poor stellar halo of the Milky Way.

 - **Abstract**
 The James Webb Space Telescope recently uncovered a population of massive black holes (BHs) in the first billion years after the Big Bang. Among these high-redshift BH candidates, observations have identified a class of active galactic nuclei candidates, dubbed Little Red Dots (LRDs), with extraordinarily compact gas reservoirs and peculiar spectral features. LRDs clearly emerge at redshift z<8 and their abundance declines by z<5. Recent theoretical studies have explored the link between LRDs and the formation of heavy BH seeds in the early Universe, such as direct-collapse BHs (DCBHs). Here we present results from preliminary runs for the MELIORA cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, where we implement an accurate model for DCBH formation, accounting for the Lyman-Werner radiation field and mass-inflow rates in the target host haloes. We aim to test whether or not DCBH formation could lead to systems resembling those hypothesized for LRDs. We find that the population of newly formed DCBHs in the simulations exhibits a steep decline at z<6, akin to the emergence of LRDs, primarily driven by reduced inflows. The birth of DCBHs is associated with a significant gas compaction event, followed by a phase of intense luminosity in the 200 Myr after their birth, and subsequently by the formation of the first PopIII stars in these very haloes. If these DCBHs nurseries are associated with LRDs, then it could explain their weak emission from X-rays and hot dust.
