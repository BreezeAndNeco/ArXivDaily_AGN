 - **Abstract**
 We present the La Silla Schmidt Southern Survey (LS4), a new wide-field, time-domain survey to be conducted with the 1 m ESO Schmidt telescope. The 268 megapixel LS4 camera mosaics 32 2k$\times$4k fully depleted CCDs, providing a $\sim$20 deg$^2$ field of view with $1''$ pixel$^{-1}$ resolution. The LS4 camera will have excellent performance at longer wavelengths: in a standard 45 s exposure the expected 5$\sigma$ limiting magnitudes in $g$, $i$, $z$ are $\sim$21.5, $\sim$20.9, and $\sim$20.3 mag (AB), respectively. The telescope design requires a novel filter holder that fixes different bandpasses over each quadrant of the detector. Two quadrants will have $i$ band, while the other two will be $g$ and $z$ band and color information will be obtained by dithering targets across the different quadrants. The majority (90%) of the observing time will be used to conduct a public survey that monitors the extragalactic sky at both moderate (3 d) and high (1 d) cadence, as well as focused observations within the Galactic bulge and plane. Alerts from the public survey will be broadcast to the community via established alert brokers. LS4 will run concurrently with the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). The combination of LS4+LSST will enable detailed holistic monitoring of many nearby transients: high-cadence LS4 observations will resolve the initial rise and peak of the light curve while less-frequent but deeper observations by LSST will characterize the years before and after explosion. Here, we summarize the primary science objectives of LS4 including microlensing events in the Galaxy, extragalactic transients, the search for electromagnetic counterparts to multi-messenger events, and cosmology.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast X-ray Transients (FXTs) are a rare and poorly understood phenomenon with a variety of possible progenitors. The launch of the Einstein Probe (EP) mission has facilitated a rapid increase in the real-time discovery and follow-up of FXTs. We focus on the recent EP discovered transient EP241021a, which shows a peculiar panchromatic behavior. We obtained optical and near-infrared multi-band imaging and spectroscopy with the Fraunhofer Telescope at Wendelstein Observatory, the Hobby-Eberly Telescope, and the Very Large Telescope over the first 100 days of its evolution. EP241021a was discovered by EP as a soft X-ray trigger, but was not detected at gamma-ray frequencies. The observed soft X-ray prompt emission spectrum is consistent with non-thermal radiation, which requires at least a mildly relativistic outflow with bulk Lorentz factor $\Gamma \gtrsim 4$. The optical and near-infrared lightcurve has a two component behavior where an initially fading component $\sim t^{-1}$ turns to a rise steeper than $\sim t^{4}$ after a few days before peaking at $M_r\approx -22$ mag and quickly returning to the initial decay. The peak absolute magnitude is the most luminous optical emission associated to an FXT, superseding EP240414a. Standard supernova models are unable to reproduce either the absolute magnitude or rapid timescale ($<2$ d) of the rebrightening. The X-ray, optical and near-infrared spectral energy distributions display a red color $r-J\approx 1$ mag, and point to a non-thermal origin ($\nu^{-1}$) for the broadband emission. By considering a gamma-ray burst as a plausible scenario, we favor a refreshed shock as the cause of the rebrightening. This is consistent with the inference of an at least mildly relativistic outflow based on the prompt trigger. Our results suggest a likely link between EP discovered FXTs and low luminosity gamma-ray bursts.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a first two-dimensional general-relativistic analysis of superconducting regions in axially symmetric highly magnetized neutron star (magnetar) models with toroidal magnetic fields. We investigate the topology and distribution of type-II and type-I superconducting regions for varying toroidal magnetic field strengths and stellar masses by solving the Einstein-Maxwell equations using the XNS code. Our results reveal that the outer cores of low- to intermediate-mass magnetars sustain superconductivity over larger regions compared to higher-mass stars with non-trivial distribution of type-II and type-I regions. Consistent with previous one-dimensional (1D) models, we find that regardless of the gravitational mass, the inner cores of magnetars with toroidal magnetic fields are devoid of $S$-wave proton superconductivity. Furthermore, these models contain non-superconducting, torus-shaped regions - a novel feature absent in previous 1D studies. Finally, we speculate on the potential indirect effects of superconductivity on continuous gravitational wave emissions from millisecond pulsars, such as PSR J1843-1113, highlighting their relevance for future gravitational wave detectors.

 - **Abstract**
 M dwarfs are the most common type of star in the solar neighborhood, and many exhibit frequent and highly energetic flares. To better understand these events across the electromagnetic spectrum, a campaign observed AU Mic (dM1e) over 7 days from the X-ray to radio regimes. Here, we present high-time-resolution light curves from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) Ku band (12--18 GHz) and the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) K band (16--25 GHz), which observe gyrosynchrotron radiation and directly probe the action of accelerated electrons within flaring loops. Observations reveal 16 VLA and 3 ATCA flares of varying shapes and sizes, from a short (30 sec) spiky burst to a long-duration ($\sim$5 hr) decaying exponential. The Ku-band spectral index is found to often evolve during flares. Both rising and falling spectra are observed in the Ku-band, indicating optically thick and thin flares, respectively. Estimations from optically thick radiation indicate higher loop-top magnetic field strengths ($\sim$1 kG) and sustained electron densities ($\sim$10$^{6}$ cm$^{-3}$) than previous observations of large M-dwarf flares. We estimate the total kinetic energies of gyrating electrons in optically thin flares to be between 10$^{32}$ and 10$^{34}$ erg when the local magnetic field strength is between 500 and 700 G. These energies are able to explain the combined radiated energies from multi-wavelength observations. Overall, values are more aligned with modern radiative-hydrodynamic simulations of M-dwarf flares, and future modeling efforts will better constrain findings.

 - **Abstract**
 The {\em B}-field Orion Protostellar Survey (BOPS) recently obtained polarimetric observations at 870 ${\rm \mu m}$ towards 61 protostars in the Orion molecular clouds with $\sim 1^{\prime\prime}$ spatial resolution using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. From the BOPS sample, we selected the 26 protostars with extended polarized emission within a radius of $\sim 6^{\prime\prime}$ (2400~au) around the protostar. This allows to have sufficient statistical polarization data to infer the magnetic field strength. The magnetic field strength is derived using the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method. The underlying magnetic field strengths are approximately 2.0~mG for protostars with a standard hourglass magnetic field morphology, which is higher than the values derived for protostars with rotated hourglass, spiral, and complex magnetic field configurations ($\lesssim1.0$~mG). This suggests that the magnetic field plays a more significant role in envelopes exhibiting a standard hourglass field morphology, and a value of $\gtrsim2.0$ mG would be required to maintain such a structure at these scales. Furthermore, most protostars in the sample are slightly supercritical, with mass-to-flux ratios $\lesssim3.0$. In particular, the mass-to-flux ratios for all protostars with a standard hourglass magnetic field morphology are lower than 3.0. However, these ratios do not account for the contribution of the protostellar mass, which means they are likely significantly underestimated.

 - **Abstract**
 The evolution of galaxies is known to be connected to their position within the large-scale structure and their local environmental density. We investigate the relative importance of these using the underlying dark matter density field extracted from the Constrained Simulations in BORG (CSiBORG) suite of constrained cosmological simulations. We define cosmic web environment through both dark matter densities averaged on a scale up to 16 Mpc/h, and through cosmic web location identified by applying DisPerSE to the CSiBORG haloes. We correlate these environmental measures with the properties of observed galaxies in large surveys using optical data (from the NASA-Sloan Atlas) and 21-cm radio data (from ALFALFA). We find statistically significant correlations between environment and colour, neutral hydrogen gas (HI) mass fraction, star formation rate and Sérsic index. Together, these correlations suggest that bluer, star forming, HI rich, and disk-type galaxies tend to reside in lower density areas, further from filaments, while redder, more elliptical galaxies with lower star formation rates tend to be found in higher density areas, closer to filaments. We find analogous trends with the quenching of galaxies, but notably find that the quenching of low mass galaxies has a greater dependence on environment than the quenching of high mass galaxies. We find that the relationship between galaxy properties and the environmental density is stronger than that with distance to filament, suggesting that environmental density has a greater impact on the properties of galaxies than their location within the larger-scale cosmic web.

 - **Abstract**
 The chemical composition of the Sun is still a highly controversial issue. No solar model has yet been able to simultaneously reproduce the solar lithium and beryllium abundances, along with helioseismic results, including the rotation profile. Lithium and beryllium are fragile elements that are highly sensitive to the physical conditions, as well as to transport and mixing processes within and below the convective zone (CZ). Uncovering the transport mechanisms responsible for the depletion of Li and Be in the Sun is crucial for using them as tools to understand stellar interiors and the associated transport and mixing processes. We constructed rotating solar models based on Magg's abundance scale, incorporating the effects of convective overshoot and magnetic fields. The rotating model exhibits superior sound speed and density profile and successfully reproduces the observed ratios $r_{02}$ and $r_{13}$. It also matches the seismically inferred CZ depth, surface helium abundance, and rotation profile, as well as the detected Li and Be abundances and neutrino fluxes within $1\sigma$. The depletion of Li is dominated by convective overshoot and rotational mixing, while Be depletion is primarily driven by gravitational settling and rotational mixing. The presence of the tachocline accelerates Li depletion but slows down Be depletion. These distinct depletion mechanisms result in the surface abundances of Li and Be evolving differently over time.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the results of a spatially compete, high-sensitivity survey for Herbig-Haro (HH) outflows in the Western and Eastern Circinus molecular clouds. We have detected 28 new HH objects in Circinus West, doubling the number known in this dark nebula. We have also discovered 9 outflows in Circinus East, the first to be identified here. Although both Circinus West and East appear to be located at ~800 pc, their morphologies are distinct. Circinus West shows filamentary structure, while Circinus East is dominated by amorphous dark clouds. North-east of Circinus East, an extended distribution of young stars is centered on the ~6 Myr-old open cluster ASCC 79, which may have triggered the sequential formation of younger surrounding populations. New transverse velocities from Gaia show two dynamically distinct stellar populations in Circinus East; their velocity distribution is consistent with an active cloud-cloud collision between material ejected by the formation of O and B stars in ASCC~79 and a dynamically similar interloping cloud. Given the similar distances to Circinus West and East, and the presence in both of HH objects -- a phenomenon associated with stellar ages of ~1 Myr -- it is likely that these clouds are nominally related, but only Circinus East is subject to substantial feedback from the central cluster in the parent complex. This feedback appears to guide the morphology and evolution of Circinus East, resulting in a complex and possibly disruptive dynamical environment rich in star formation potential that contrasts with the relatively quiescent environment in Circinus West.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar inertial modes have the potential to surpass the diagnostic capabilities of acoustic waves in probing the deep interior of the Sun. The fulfillment of this potential requires an accurate identification and characterization of these modes. Among the set of detected inertial modes, the equatorially anti-symmetric "high-frequency retrograde'' (HFR) modes has attracted special interest because numerical studies have suggested that they are not purely toroidal, as initial observations suggested, and predicted that they would possess a significant radial flow signal at depth. Here, we analyze $\sim$13 years of HMI/SDO 5$^\circ$ ring tiles, and discover a horizontal-divergence signal, directly connected to radial flows, in the near surface layers of the Sun. We demonstrate that this signal is indeed part of the HFR modes and not spatial leakage from prograde flows associated with magnetic regions. The amplitudes of the horizontal divergence are approximately half that associated with radial vorticity. We also report the presence of a ridge of enhanced power, although with a signal-to-noise ratio of 0.3, in the retrograde frequencies that coincides with the HFR latitudinal overtones reported by models. Using numerical linear models we find reasonable agreement with observations, though future work on boundary considerations and the inclusion of the near-surface may improve future inferences. This is the first instance where numerical studies of solar inertial modes have guided observations, giving further confidence to past inferences that rely upon numerical models.
#### SOFIA FIFI-LS spectroscopy of DR21 Main: energetics of the spatially-resolved outflow from a high-mass protostar

 - **Abstract**
 Massive star formation is associated with energetic processes that may influence the physics and chemistry of parental molecular clouds and impact galaxy evolution. The high-mass protostar DR21 Main in Cygnus X possesses one of the largest and most luminous outflows ever detected in the Galaxy, but the origin of its structure and driving mechanisms is still debated. Our aim is to spatially resolve the far-infrared line emission from DR21 Main and to investigate the gas physical conditions, energetics, and current mass loss rates along its outflow. Far-infrared SOFIA FIFI-LS spectra covering selected high-J CO lines, OH, [O I], [CII] and [O III] lines are analyzed across the almost full extent of the DR21 Main outflow using 2.00' x 3.75' mosaic. The spatial extent of far-infrared emission follows closely the well-known outflow direction of DR21 Main in case of high-J CO, [O I] 63.18 um, and the OH line at 163.13 um. On the contrary, the emission from the [C II] 157.74 um and [O I] 145.53 um lines arises mostly from the eastern part of the outflow, and it is likely linked with a photodissociation region. Comparison of non-LTE radiative transfer models with the observed [O I] line ratios suggest H2 densities of ~10^5 cm^(-3) in the western part of the outflow and ~10^4 cm^(-3) in the East. Such densities are consistent with the predictions of UV-irradiated non-dissociative shock models for the observed ratios of CO and [O I] along the DR21 Main. Main outflow. Assuming that the bulk of emission arises in shocks, the outflow power of DR21 Main of 4.3-4.8x10^2 Lsol and the mass-loss rate of 3.3-3.7x10^(-3) Msol/yr are determined. Observations provide strong support for its origin in outflow shocks, and the stratification of physical conditions along the outflow. The total line cooling provides additional evidence that DR21 Main drives one of the most energetic outflows in the Milky Way.
#### Exploring magnetised galactic outflows in starburst dwarf galaxies NGC 3125 and IC 4662

 - **Abstract**
 The study of radio emission in starburst dwarf galaxies provides a unique opportunity to investigate the mechanisms responsible for the amplification and transport of magnetic fields. Local dwarfs are often considered proxies for early-Universe galaxies, so this study may provide insights into the role of non-thermal components in the formation and evolution of larger galaxies. By investigating the radio continuum spectra and maps of the starburst dwarf galaxies, we aim to draw conclusions on their magnetic field strengths and configurations, as well as the dynamics of cosmic ray (CR) transport. We perform a radio continuum polarimetry study of two of the brightest starburst IRAS Revised Bright Galaxy Sample (RBGS) dwarf galaxies, NGC 3125 and IC 4662. By combining data of the Australian Telescope Compact Array (2.1 GHz) and MeerKAT (1.28 GHz), we analyse the underlying emission mechanism and the CR transport in these systems. We find flat spectra in those dwarf galaxies over the entire investigated frequency range, which sharply contrasts with observations of massive spiral galaxies. Because the expected cooling time of CR electrons is much shorter than their escape time, we would expect a steepened steady-state CR electron spectrum. The flat observed spectra suggest a substantial contribution from free-free emission at high frequencies and absorption at low frequencies, which may solve this puzzle. For NGC 3125, we measure a degree of polarisation between 0.75% and 2.6%, implying a turbulent field and supporting the picture of a comparably large thermal emission component that could be sourced by stellar radiation feedback and supernovae.
#### Star formation and stellar & AGN feedback in the absence of accretion, not gas stripping, set the quenching timescale in satellite galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 Observational measurements hint at a peak in the quenching timescale of satellite galaxies in groups and clusters as a function of their stellar masses at $M_{\star} \approx 10^{9.5} \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$; less and more massive satellite galaxies quench faster. We investigate the origin of these trends using the EAGLE simulation in which they are qualitatively reproduced for satellites with $10^{9}<M_{\star}/\mathrm{M}_\odot<10^{11}$ around hosts of $10^{13}<M_\mathrm{200c}/\mathrm{M}_\odot<10^{14.6}$. We select gas particles of simulated galaxies at the time that they become satellites and track their evolution. Interpreting these data yields insights into the prevailing mechanism that leads to the depletion of the interstellar medium (ISM) and the cessation of star formation. We find that for satellites across our entire range in stellar mass the quenching timescale is to leading order set by the depletion of the ISM by star formation and stellar & AGN feedback in the absence of sustained accretion of fresh gas. The turnover in the quenching timescale as a function of stellar mass is a direct consequence of the maximum in the star formation efficiency (or equivalently the minimum in the total -- stellar plus AGN -- feedback efficiency) at the same stellar mass. We can discern the direct stripping of the ISM by ram pressure and/or tides in the simulations; these mechanisms modulate the quenching timescale but do not drive its overall scaling with satellite stellar mass. Our findings argue against a scenario in which the turnover in the quenching timescale is a consequence of the competing influences of gas stripping and 'starvation'.

 - **Abstract**
 The baryonic fraction of galaxies is observed to vary with the mass of its dark matter (DM) halo. Low-mass galaxies have low baryonic fractions which increase to a maximum for masses near $10^{12}\ M_{\odot}$, and decreases thereafter with increasing galaxy mass. This trend is generally attributed to the action of feedback from star formation at the low end and of active galactic nuclei at the high-mass end. An alternative is that the baryonic fraction is at least partially due to the ability of galaxies to competitively accrete gas in a group or clustered environment. Most galaxies in a group including those of lower masses, orbit the cluster centre at significant speeds and hence their accretion is limited by a Bondi-Hoyle type process, $\dot{M}_{acc} \propto M_{DM}^2$. In contrast, the few high-mass galaxies reside in the core of the cluster and accrete in a tidal accretion process, $\dot{M}_{acc} \propto M_{DM}^{2/3}$. These two mechanisms result in a baryonic mass fraction that increases as $M_{DM}$ at low masses and decreases as $M_{DM}^{-1/3}$ at high masses. This model predicts that lower-mass halos in small-N groups should have higher baryonic fractions relative to those in large clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultra-short Period exoplanets (USPs) like 55 Cnc e, hosting dayside magma oceans, present unique opportunities to study surface-atmosphere interactions. The composition of a vaporised mineral atmosphere enveloping the dayside is dictated by that of the surface magma ocean, which in turn is sensitive to its oxygen fugacity ($f$O$_2$). Observability estimations and characterisation of the atmospheric emission of 55 Cnc e have mostly remained limited to low spectral resolution space-based studies. Here, we aim to examine ground-based high-resolution observabilities of a diverse set of mineral atmospheres produced across a grid of mantle $f$O$_2$s varying over 12 orders of magnitude. We assume a Bulk Silicate Earth mantle composition and a substellar dayside temperature of T = 2500K in the near infrared wavelength (NIR) region. This spectral range is often featureless for this class of atmospheres at low-resolution. Coupling our newly developed simulator for synthesising realistic observations from high-resolution ground-based spectrographs (Ratri) to a pre-developed high-resolution cross-correlation spectroscopy (HRCCS) analysis pipeline (Upamana), we find that this array of mineral atmospheres would all be detectable with 11 hours of observing time of the dayside of 55 Cnc e with CARMENES and each individual scenario can be correctly differentiated within 1$\sigma$. Our analysis is readily able to distinguish between a planet with an Earth-like redox state (with $f$O$_2$ $\sim$3.5 log$_{10}$ units above the iron-wüstite, IW buffer) from a Mercury-like planet ($f$O$_2$ $\sim$5 log$_{10}$ units below IW). We thus conclude that the HRCCS technique holds promise for cataloguing the diversity of redox states among the rocky exoplanetary population.

 - **Abstract**
 Planetary growth within protoplanetary disks involves accreting material from their surroundings, yet the underlying mechanisms and physical conditions of the accreting gas remain debated. This study aims to investigate the dynamics and thermodynamic properties of accreting gas giants, and to characterize the envelope that forms near the planet during accretion. We employ three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of a Jupiter-mass planet embedded in a viscous gaseous disk. Our models incorporate a non-isothermal energy equation to compute gas and radiation energy diffusion and include radiative feedback from the planet. Results indicate that gas accretion occurs supersonically towards the planet, forming an ionized envelope that extends from the planetary surface up to 0.2 times the Hill radius in the no-feedback model, and up to 0.4 times the Hill radius in the feedback model. The envelope's radius, or ionization radius, acts as a boundary halting supersonic gas inflow and is pivotal for estimating accretion rates and H$\alpha$ emission luminosities. Including radiative feedback increases accretion rates, especially within the ionization radius and from areas to the right of the planet when the star is positioned to the left. The accretion luminosities calculated at the ionization radius are substantially lower than those calculated at the Hill radius, highlighting potential misinterpretations in the non-detection of H$\alpha$ emissions as indicators of ongoing planet formation.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of the single-component Sérsic profile fitting for the magnitude-limited sample of \IE$<23$ galaxies within the 63.1 deg$^2$ area of the Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1). The associated morphological catalogue includes two sets of structural parameters fitted using \texttt{SourceXtractor++}: one for VIS \IE images and one for a combination of three NISP images in \YE, \JE and \HE bands. We compare the resulting Sérsic parameters to other morphological measurements provided in the Q1 data release, and to the equivalent parameters based on higher-resolution \HST imaging. These comparisons confirm the consistency and the reliability of the fits to Q1 data. Our analysis of colour gradients shows that NISP profiles have systematically smaller effective radii ($R_{\rm e}$) and larger Sérsic indices ($n$) than in VIS. In addition, we highlight trends in NISP-to-VIS parameter ratios with both magnitude and $n_{\rm VIS}$. From the 2D bimodality of the $(u-r)$ colour-$\log(n)$ plane, we define a $(u-r)_{\rm lim}(n)$ that separates early- and late-type galaxies (ETGs and LTGs). We use the two subpopulations to examine the variations of $n$ across well-known scaling relations at $z<1$. ETGs display a steeper size--stellar mass relation than LTGs, indicating a difference in the main drivers of their mass assembly. Similarly, LTGs and ETGs occupy different parts of the stellar mass--star-formation rate plane, with ETGs at higher masses than LTGs, and further down below the Main Sequence of star-forming galaxies. This clear separation highlights the link known between the shutdown of star formation and morphological transformations in the Euclid imaging data set. In conclusion, our analysis demonstrates both the robustness of the Sérsic fits available in the Q1 morphological catalogue and the wealth of information they provide for studies of galaxy evolution with Euclid.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar bars are key structures in disc galaxies, driving angular momentum redistribution and influencing processes such as bulge growth and star formation. Quantifying the bar fraction as a function of redshift and stellar mass is therefore important for constraining the physical processes that drive disc formation and evolution across the history of the Universe. Leveraging the unprecedented resolution and survey area of the Euclid Q1 data release combined with the Zoobot deep-learning model trained on citizen-science labels, we identify 7711 barred galaxies with $M_* \gtrsim 10^{10}M_\odot$ in a magnitude-selected sample $I_E < 20.5$ spanning $63.1 deg^2$. We measure a mean bar fraction of $0.2-0.4$, consistent with prior studies. At fixed redshift, massive galaxies exhibit higher bar fractions, while lower-mass systems show a steeper decline with redshift, suggesting earlier disc assembly in massive galaxies. Comparisons with cosmological simulations (e.g., TNG50, Auriga) reveal a broadly consistent bar fraction, but highlight overpredictions for high-mass systems, pointing to potential over-efficiency in central stellar mass build-up in simulations. These findings demonstrate Euclid's transformative potential for galaxy morphology studies and underscore the importance of refining theoretical models to better reproduce observed trends. Future work will explore finer mass bins, environmental correlations, and additional morphological indicators.

 - **Abstract**
 Investigating the drivers of the quenching of star formation in galaxies is key to understanding their evolution. The Euclid mission will provide rich spatial and spectral data from optical to infrared wavelengths for millions of galaxies, enabling precise measurements of their star formation histories. Using the first Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1), we developed a probabilistic classification framework, that combines the average specific star-formation rate ($\rm sSFR_\tau$) inferred over two timescales ($\tau={10^8,10^9}$ yr), to categorize galaxies as `Ageing' (secularly evolving), `Quenched' (recently halted star formation), or `Retired' (dominated by old stars). We validated this methodology using synthetic observations from the IllustrisTNG simulation. Two classification methods were employed: a probabilistic approach, integrating posterior distributions, and a model-driven method optimizing sample purity and completeness using IllustrisTNG. At $z<0.1$ and $M_\ast \gtrsim 3\times10^{8}\, M_\odot$, we obtain Euclid class fractions of 68-72%, 8-17%, and 14-19% for Ageing, Quenched, and Retired populations, respectively, consistent with previous studies. The evolution with redshift shows increasing/decreasing fraction of Ageing/Retired galaxies. The fraction of quenched systems shows a weaker dependence on stellar mass and redshift, varying between 5% and 15%. We analysed the mass-size-metallicity relation for each population. Ageing galaxies generally exhibit disc morphologies and low metallicities. Retired galaxies show compact structures and enhanced chemical enrichment, while Quenched galaxies form an intermediate population, more compact and chemically evolved than Ageing systems. This work demonstrates Euclid's great potential for elucidating the physical nature of the quenching mechanisms that govern galaxy evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 To better understand the role of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in galaxy evolution, it is crucial to achieve a complete and pure AGN census. X-ray surveys are key to this, but identifying their counterparts (CTPs) at other wavelengths remains challenging due to their larger positional uncertainties and limited availability of deeper, uniform ancillary data. Euclid is revolutionising this effort, offering extensive coverage of nearly the entire extragalactic sky, particularly in the near-infrared bands, where AGN are more easily detected. With the first Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1), we identifyed, classifyed, and determined the redshifts of Euclid CTPs to known point-like sources from major X-ray surveys, including XMM-Newton, Chandra, and eROSITA. Using Bayesian statistics, combined with machine learning (ML), we identify the CTPs to 11 286 X-ray sources from the three X-ray telescopes. For the large majority of 10 194 sources, the associations are unique, with the remaining $\sim$ 10% of multi-CTP cases equally split between XMM-Newton and eROSITA. ML is then used to distinguish between Galactic (8%) and extragalactic (92%) sources. We computed photo-zs using deep learning for the 8617 sources detected in the 10th data release of the DESI Legacy Survey, reaching an accuracy and a fraction of outliers of about 5%. Based on their X-ray luminosities, over 99% of CTPs identified as extragalactic are classified as AGN, most of which appear unobscured given their hardness ratios. With this paper, we release our catalogue, which includes identifiers, basic X-ray properties, the details of the associations, and additional features such as Galactic/extragalactic classifications and photometric/spectroscopic redshifts. We also provide probabilities for sub-selecting the sample based on purity and completeness, allowing users to tailor the sample according to their specific needs.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy major mergers are a key pathway to trigger AGN. We present the first detection of major mergers in the Euclid Deep Fields and analyse their connection with AGN. We constructed a stellar-mass-complete ($M_*>10^{9.8}\,M_{\odot}$) sample of galaxies from the first quick data release (Q1), in the redshift range z=0.5-2. We selected AGN using X-ray data, optical spectroscopy, mid-infrared colours, and processing \IE observations with an image decomposition algorithm. We used CNNs trained on cosmological simulations to classify galaxies as mergers and non-mergers. We found a larger fraction of AGN in mergers compared to the non-merger controls for all AGN selections, with AGN excess factors ranging from 2 to 6. Likewise, a generally larger merger fraction ($f_{merg}$) is seen in active galaxies than in the non-active controls. We analysed $f_{merg}$ as a function of the AGN bolometric luminosity ($L_{bol}$) and the contribution of the point-source to the total galaxy light in the \IE-band ($f_{PSF}$) as a proxy for the relative AGN contribution fraction. We uncovered a rising $f_{merg}$, with increasing $f_{PSF}$ up to $f_{PSF}=0.55$, after which we observed a decreasing trend. We then derived the point-source luminosity ($L_{PSF}$) and showed that $f_{merg}$ monotonically increases as a function of $L_{PSF}$ at z<0.9, with $f_{merg}>$50% for $L_{PSF}>2\,10^{43}$ erg/s. At z>0.9, $f_{merg}$ rises as a function of $L_{PSF}$, though mergers do not dominate until $L_{PSF}=10^{45}$ erg/s. For X-ray and spectroscopic AGN, we computed $L_{bol}$, which has a positive correlation with $f_{merg}$ for X-ray AGN, while shows a less pronounced trend for spectroscopic AGN due to the smaller sample size. At $L_{bol}>10^{45}$ erg/s, AGN mostly reside in mergers. We concluded that mergers are strongly linked to the most powerful, dust-obscured AGN, associated with rapid supermassive black hole growth.

 - **Abstract**
 Active galactic nuclei (AGN) play a key role in galaxy evolution but are challenging to identify due to their varied observational signatures. Furthermore, understanding their impact requires quantifying their strength relative to their host galaxies. We developed a deep learning (DL) model for identifying AGN in imaging data by deriving the contribution of the central point source. Trained on Euclidised mock galaxy images with injected AGN levels, in the form of varying contributions of the point-spread function (PSF), our model can precisely and accurately recover the injected AGN contribution fraction $f_{\rm PSF}$, with a mean difference between the predicted and true $f_{\rm PSF}$ of $-0.0078$ and an overall root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.051. This method moves beyond binary AGN classification, enabling precise AGN contribution measurements. Applying our model to a stellar-mass-limited sample ($M_{\ast} \ge 10^{9.8} M_{\odot}$, $0.5 \le z \le 2.0$) from the first \Euclid quick data release (Q1), we identify $48,840 \pm 78$ AGN over 63.1 deg$^2$ ($7.8\pm0.1$%) using a threshold of $f_{\rm PSF} > 0.2$. We compare our DL-selected AGN with those identified in X-ray, mid-infrared (MIR), and optical spectroscopy and investigate their overlapping fractions depending on different thresholds on the PSF contribution. We find that the overlap increases with increasing X-ray or bolometric AGN luminosity. The AGN luminosity in the $I_{\rm E}$ filter correlates with host galaxy stellar mass, suggesting faster supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth in more massive galaxies. Moreover, the mean relative contribution of the AGN is higher in quiescent galaxies than in star-forming ones. Starburst galaxies and the most massive galaxies (across the star-formation main sequence) tend to host the most luminous AGN, indicating concomitant assembly of the SMBH and the host galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 Red quasars constitute an important but elusive phase in the evolution of supermassive black holes, where dust obscuration can significantly alter their observed properties. They have broad emission lines, like other quasars, but their optical continuum emission is significantly reddened, which is why they were traditionally identified based on near- and mid-infrared selection criteria. This work showcases the capability of the \Euclid space telescope to find a large sample of red quasars, using \Euclid near infrared (NIR) photometry. We first conduct a forecast analysis, comparing a synthetic catalogue of red QSOs with COSMOS2020. Using template fitting, we reconstruct \Euclid-like photometry for the COSMOS sources and identify a sample of candidates in a multidimensional colour-colour space achieving $98\%$ completeness for mock red QSOs with $30\%$ contaminants. To refine our selection function, we implement a probabilistic Random Forest classifier, and use UMAP visualisation to disentangle non-linear features in colour-space, reaching $98\%$ completeness and $88\%$ purity. A preliminary analysis of the candidates in the \Euclid Deep Field Fornax (EDF-F) shows that, compared to VISTA+DECAm-based colour selection criteria, \Euclid's superior depth, resolution and optical-to-NIR coverage improves the identification of the reddest, most obscured sources. Notably, the \Euclid exquisite resolution in the $I_E$ filter unveils the presence of a candidate dual quasar system, highlighting the potential for this mission to contribute to future studies on the population of dual AGN. The resulting catalogue of candidates, including more the 150 000 sources, provides a first census of red quasars in \Euclid Q1 and sets the groundwork for future studies in the Euclid Wide Survey (EWS), including spectral follow-up analyses and host morphology characterisation.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a catalogue of candidate active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the $Euclid$ Quick Release (Q1) fields. For each $Euclid$ source we collect multi-wavelength photometry and spectroscopy information from Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX), $Gaia$, Dark Energy Survey (DES), Wise-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), $Spitzer$, Dark Energy Survey (DESI), and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), including spectroscopic redshift from public compilations. We investigate the AGN contents of the Q1 fields by applying selection criteria using $Euclid$ colours and WISE-AllWISE cuts finding respectively 292,222 and 65,131 candidates. We also create a high-purity QSO catalogue based on $Gaia$ DR3 information containing 1971 candidates. Furthermore, we utilise the collected spectroscopic information from DESI to perform broad-line and narrow-line AGN selections, leading to a total of 4392 AGN candidates in the Q1 field. We investigate and refine the Q1 probabilistic random forest QSO population, selecting a total of 180,666 candidates. Additionally, we perform SED fitting on a subset of sources with available $z_{\text{spec}}$, and by utilizing the derived AGN fraction, we identify a total of 7766 AGN candidates. We discuss purity and completeness of the selections and define two new colour selection criteria ($JH$_$I_{\text{E}}Y$ and $I_{\text{E}}H$_$gz$) to improve on purity, finding 313,714 and 267,513 candidates respectively in the Q1 data. We find a total of 229,779 AGN candidates equivalent to an AGN surface density of 3641 deg$^{-2}$ for $18<I_{\text{E}}\leq 24.5$, and a subsample of 30,422 candidates corresponding to an AGN surface density of 482 deg$^{-2}$ when limiting the depth to $18<I_{\text{E}}\leq 22$. The surface density of AGN recovered from this work is in line with predictions based on the AGN X-ray luminosity functions.

 - **Abstract**
 Light emission from galaxies exhibit diverse brightness profiles, influenced by factors such as galaxy type, structural features and interactions with other galaxies. Elliptical galaxies feature more uniform light distributions, while spiral and irregular galaxies have complex, varied light profiles due to their structural heterogeneity and star-forming activity. In addition, galaxies with an active galactic nucleus (AGN) feature intense, concentrated emission from gas accretion around supermassive black holes, superimposed on regular galactic light, while quasi-stellar objects (QSO) are the extreme case of the AGN emission dominating the galaxy. The challenge of identifying AGN and QSO has been discussed many times in the literature, often requiring multi-wavelength observations. This paper introduces a novel approach to identify AGN and QSO from a single image. Diffusion models have been recently developed in the machine-learning literature to generate realistic-looking images of everyday objects. Utilising the spatial resolving power of the Euclid VIS images, we created a diffusion model trained on one million sources, without using any source pre-selection or labels. The model learns to reconstruct light distributions of normal galaxies, since the population is dominated by them. We condition the prediction of the central light distribution by masking the central few pixels of each source and reconstruct the light according to the diffusion model. We further use this prediction to identify sources that deviate from this profile by examining the reconstruction error of the few central pixels regenerated in each source's core. Our approach, solely using VIS imaging, features high completeness compared to traditional methods of AGN and QSO selection, including optical, near-infrared, mid-infrared, and X-rays. [abridged]

 - **Abstract**
 Our understanding of cosmic star-formation at $z>3$ used to largely rely on rest-frame UV observations. However, these observations overlook dusty and massive sources, resulting in an incomplete census of early star-forming galaxies. Recently, infrared data from Spitzer and the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have revealed a hidden population at $z\sim$3-6 with extreme red colours. Taking advantage of the overlap between imaging in the Euclid Deep Fields (EDFs), covering $\sim$ 60 deg$^2$, and ancillary Spitzer observations, we identified 27000 extremely red objects with $H_E-$IRAC2>2.25 (dubbed HIEROs) down to a $10\sigma$ completeness magnitude limit of IRAC2 $=$ 22.5 AB. After a visual inspection to discard artefacts and objects with troubling photometry, we ended up with a final sample of 3900 candidates. We retrieved the physical parameter estimates for these objects from the SED-fitting tool CIGALE. Our results confirm that HIERO galaxies may populate the high-mass end of the stellar mass function at $z>3$, with some reaching extreme stellar masses ($M_*>10^{11}M_\odot$) and exhibiting high dust attenuation ($A_V>3$). However, we consider stellar mass estimates unreliable for $z>3.5$, favouring a lower-z solution. The challenges faced by SED-fitting tools in characterising these objects highlight the need for further studies, incorporating shorter-wavelength and spectroscopic data. Euclid spectra will help resolve degeneracies and better constrain the physical properties of the brightest galaxies. Given the extreme nature of this population, characterising these sources is crucial for understanding galaxy evolution. This work demonstrates Euclid's potential to provide statistical samples of rare, massive, dust-obscured galaxies at $z>3$, which will be prime targets for JWST, ALMA, and ELT.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have revealed a population of sources with a compact morphology and a `v-shaped' continuum, namely blue at rest-frame $\lambda<4000$A and red at longer wavelengths. The nature of these sources, called `little red dots' (LRDs), is still debated, since it is unclear if they host active galactic nuclei (AGN) and their number seems to drastically drop at z<4. We utilise the 63 $deg^2$ covered by the quick Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1) to extend the search for LRDs to brighter magnitudes and to lower z than what has been possible with JWST to have a broader view of the evolution of this peculiar galaxy population. The selection is done by fitting the available photometric data (Euclid, Spitzer/IRAC, and ground-based griz data) with two power laws, to retrieve the rest-frame optical and UV slopes consistently over a large redshift range (i.e, z<7.6). We exclude extended objects and possible line emitters, and perform a visual inspection to remove imaging artefacts. The final selection includes 3341 LRD candidates from z=0.33 to z=3.6, with 29 detected in IRAC. Their rest-frame UV luminosity function, in contrast with previous JWST studies, shows that the number density of LRD candidates increases from high-z down to z=1.5-2.5 and decreases at even lower z. Less evolution is apparent focusing on the subsample of more robust LRD candidates having IRAC detections, which is affected by low statistics and limited by the IRAC resolution. The comparison with previous quasar UV luminosity functions shows that LRDs are not the dominant AGN population at z<4. Follow-up studies of these LRD candidates are key to confirm their nature, probe their physical properties and check for their compatibility with JWST sources, since the different spatial resolution and wavelength coverage of Euclid and JWST could select different samples of compact sources.

 The Euclid mission aims to survey around 14000 deg^{2} of extragalactic sky, providing around 10^{5} gravitational lens images. Modelling of gravitational lenses is fundamental to estimate the total mass of the lens galaxy, along with its dark matter content. Traditional modelling of gravitational lenses is computationally intensive and requires manual input. In this paper, we use a Bayesian neural network, LEns MOdelling with Neural networks (LEMON), for modelling Euclid gravitational lenses with a singular isothermal ellipsoid mass profile. Our method estimates key lens mass profile parameters, such as the Einstein radius, while also predicting the light parameters of foreground galaxies and their uncertainties. We validate LEMON's performance on both mock Euclid data sets, real Euclidised lenses observed with Hubble Space Telescope (hereafter HST), and real Euclid lenses found in the Perseus ERO field, demonstrating the ability of LEMON to predict parameters of both simulated and real lenses. Results show promising accuracy and reliability in predicting the Einstein radius, axis ratio, position angle, effective radius, Sérsic index, and lens magnitude for simulated lens galaxies. The application to real data, including the latest Quick Release 1 strong lens candidates, provides encouraging results, particularly for the Einstein radius. We also verified that LEMON has the potential to accelerate traditional modelling methods, by giving to the classical optimiser the LEMON predictions as starting points, resulting in a speed-up of up to 26 times the original time needed to model a sample of gravitational lenses, a result that would be impossible with randomly initialised guesses. This work represents a significant step towards efficient, automated gravitational lens modelling, which is crucial for handling the large data volumes expected from Euclid.

 - **Abstract**
 Euclid will detect tens of thousands of clusters and protoclusters at z>1.3. With a total coverage of 63.1deg^2, the Euclid Quick Data Release 1 (Q1) is large enough to detect tens of clusters and hundreds of protoclusters at these early epochs. The Q1 photometric redshift catalogue enables us to detect clusters out to z < 1.5; however, infrared imaging from Spitzer extends this limit to higher redshifts by using high local projected densities of Spitzer-selected galaxies as signposts for cluster and protocluster candidates. We use Spitzer imaging of the Euclid Deep Fields (EDFs) to derive densities for a sample of Spitzer-selected galaxies at redshifts z > 1.3, building Spitzer IRAC1 and IRAC2 photometric catalogues that are 95% complete at a magnitude limit of IRAC2=22.2, 22.6, and 22.8 for the EDF-S, EDF-F, and EDF-N, respectively. We apply two complementary methods to calculate galaxy densities: (1) aperture and surface density; and (2) the Nth-nearest-neighbour method. When considering a sample selected at a magnitude limit of IRAC2 < 22.2, at which all three EDFs are 95% complete, our surface density distributions are consistent among the three EDFs and with the SpUDS blank field survey. We also considered a deeper sample (IRAC2 < 22.8), finding that 2% and 3% of the surface densities in the North and Fornax fields are 3 sigma higher than the average field distribution and similar to densities found in the CARLA cluster survey. Our surface densities are also consistent with predictions from the GAEA semi-analytical model. Using combined Euclid and ground-based i-band photometry we show that our highest Spitzer-selected galaxy overdence regions, found at z~1.5, also host high densities of passive galaxies. This means that we measure densities consistent with those found in clusters and protoclusters at z>1.3.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on serendipitous \Euclid observations of previously known transients, using the \Euclid Q1 data release. By cross-matching with the Transient Name Server (TNS) we identify 164 transients that coincide with the data release. Although the \Euclid Q1 release only includes single-epoch data, we are able to make \Euclid photometric measurements at the location of 161 of these transients. \Euclid obtained deep photometric measurements or upper limits of these transients in the \IE, \YE, \JE, and \HE bands at various phases of the transient light-curves, including before, during, and after the observations of ground-based transient surveys. Approximately 70\% of known transients reported in the six months before the \Euclid observation date and with discovery magnitude brighter than 24 were detected in \Euclid $\IE$ images. Our observations include one of the earliest near-infrared detections of a Type~Ia supernova (SN~2024pvw) 15~days prior to its peak brightness, and the late-phase (435.9~days post peak) observations of the enigmatic core-collapse SN~2023aew. \Euclid deep photometry provides valuable information on the nature of these transients such as their progenitor systems and power sources, with late time observations being a uniquely powerful contribution. In addition, \Euclid is able to detect the host galaxies of some transients that were previously classed as hostless. The Q1 data demonstrate the power of the \Euclid data even with only single-epoch observations available, as will be the case for much larger areas of sky in the Euclid Wide Survey.

 - **Abstract**
 The Euclid Q1 fields were selected for calibration purposes in cosmology and are therefore relatively devoid of nearby galaxies. However, this is precisely what makes them interesting fields in which to search for dwarf galaxies in local density environments. We take advantage of the unprecedented depth, spatial resolution, and field of view of the Euclid Quick Release (Q1) to build a census of dwarf galaxies in these regions. We have identified dwarfs in a representative sample of 25 contiguous tiles in the Euclid Deep Field North (EDF-N), covering an area of 14.25 sq. deg. The dwarf candidates were identified using a semi-automatic detection method, based on properties measured by the Euclid pipeline and listed in the MER catalogue. A selection cut in surface brightness and magnitude was used to produce an initial dwarf candidate catalogue, followed by a cut in morphology and colour. This catalogue was visually classified to produce a final sample of dwarf candidates, including their morphology, number of nuclei, globular cluster (GC) richness, and presence of a blue compact centre. We identified 2674 dwarf candidates, corresponding to 188 dwarfs per sq. deg. The visual classification of the dwarfs reveals a slightly uneven morphological mix of 58% ellipticals and 42% irregulars, with very few potentially GC-rich (1.0%) and nucleated (4.0%) candidates but a noticeable fraction (6.9%) of dwarfs with blue compact centres. The distance distribution of 388 (15%) of the dwarfs with spectroscopic redshifts peaks at about 400 Mpc. Their stellar mass distribution confirms that our selection effectively identifies dwarfs while minimising contamination. The most prominent dwarf overdensities are dominated by dEs, while dIs are more evenly distributed. This work highlights Euclid's remarkable ability to detect and characterise dwarf galaxies across diverse masses, distances, and environments.

 - **Abstract**
 In the early stages of star formation, boundary layer accretion, where protostars accrete material from disks extending down to their surfaces, plays a crucial role. Understanding how a magneto-rotational-instability (MRI)-active disk connects to a protostar's surface remains a significant challenge. To investigate the mechanisms of mass and angular momentum transfer, we develop a global, three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic model of boundary layer accretion around a magnetized, convective low-mass protostar. Our results reveal that angular momentum transport mechanisms transition significantly from the outer MRI-active disk to the protostellar surface. Various mechanisms--MRI, spiral shocks, coronal accretion, jets, and disk winds--contribute to angular momentum transfer, resulting in three distinct disk structures: (1) the MRI-active disk, (2) the transition layer, and (3) the boundary layer. The simulated protostar is strongly magnetized due to the accumulation of the disk fields, wrapping by disk toroidal fields, and stellar dynamo activity. Magnetic concentrations analogous to starspots form on the protostar and interact with the rotating disk gas to generate spiral shocks. These shocks play a key role in driving accretion. These findings demonstrate the necessity of global MHD models for a comprehensive understanding of angular momentum transport. Additionally, we identify explosive events triggered by magnetic reconnection in both the protostar and the disk atmosphere. We also find decretion flows in the disk midplane, which may be important for the radial transport of refractory materials, such as Calcium-Aluminium-rich Inclusions (CAIs) precursor gas, to the outer disk.

 - **Abstract**
 Incompressible vortex flow are observed in a large variety of astrophysical plasmas such as the convection zone and the atmosphere of stars, in astrophysical jets in stellar winds and in planetary magnetospheres. More specifically, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations have shown that two large scale interlaced Alfvénic vortices structure the magnetic tail of Uranus at solstice time. Assuming identical vortices, we compute the general linear structure of the flow near their centers within the frame of ideal MHD. We then use the analytic results to interpret and qualify the vortices observed in a 3D MHD simulation of a fast rotating Uranus-type planet.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar coronal mass ejections (CMEs) directed at the Earth often drive large geomagnetic storms. Here we use velocity, magnetic field and proton density data from 152 CMEs that were sampled in-situ at 1 AU by the WIND spacecraft. We Fourier analyze fluctuations of these quantities in the quiescent pre-CME solar wind, sheath and magnetic cloud. We quantify the extent by which the power in turbulent (magnetic field, velocity and density) fluctuations in the sheath exceeds that in the solar wind background and in the magnetic cloud. For instance, the mean value of the power per unit volume in magnetic field fluctuations in the sheath is 76.7 times that in the solar wind background, while the mean value of the power per unit mass in velocity fluctuations in the sheath is 9 times that in the magnetic cloud. Our detailed results show that the turbulent fluctuation power is a useful discriminator between the ambient solar wind background, sheaths and magnetic clouds and can serve as a useful input for space weather prediction.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding what environmental conditions prevailed on early Earth during the Hadean eon, and how this set the stage for the origins of life, remains a challenge. Geologic processes such as serpentinization and bombardment by chondritic material during the late veneer might have been very active, shaping an atmospheric composition reducing enough to allow efficient photochemical synthesis of HCN, one of the key precursors of prebiotic molecules. HCN can rain out and accumulate in warm little ponds (WLPs), forming prebiotic molecules such as nucleobases and the sugar ribose. These molecules could condense to nucleotides, the building blocks of RNA molecules, one of the ingredients of life. Here, we perform a systematic study of potential sources of reducing gases on Hadean Earth and calculate the concentrations of prebiotic molecules in WLPs based on a comprehensive geophysical and atmospheric model. We find that in a reduced H$_2$-dominated atmosphere, carbonaceous bombardment can produce enough HCN to reach maximum WLP concentrations of $\sim 1-10\,\mathrm{mM}$ for nucleobases and, in the absence of seepage, $\sim 10-100\,\mathrm{\mu M}$ for ribose. If the Hadean atmosphere was initially oxidized and CO$_2$-rich ($90\,\%$), we find serpentinization alone can reduce the atmosphere, resulting in WLP concentrations of an order of magnitude lower than the reducing carbonaceous bombardment case. In both cases, concentrations are sufficient for nucleotide synthesis, as shown in experimental studies. RNA could have appeared on Earth immediately after it became habitable (about $100\,\mathrm{Myr}$ after the Moon-forming impact), or it could have (re)appeared later at any time up to the beginning of the Archean.
