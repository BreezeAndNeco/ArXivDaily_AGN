 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational Wave (GW) sources are standard sirens that provide an independent way to map the cosmic expansion history by combining with an independent redshift measurement either from an electromagnetic counterpart for a bright siren or using different statistical techniques for dark sirens. In this analysis, we perform the first Blinded Mock Data Challenge (Blinded-MDC) to test the robustness in inferring the value of Hubble constant $H_0$ for a dark siren technique which depends on astrophysical mass distribution of Binary Black Holes (BBHs). We have considered different analysis setups for the Blinded-MDC to test both statistical and systematic uncertainties and demonstrate the capabilities in inferring $H_0$ with detector sensitivity as per the fourth observation run of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA. We find that when the astrophysical population of BBHs matches with the underlying assumption of the model, a cosmological pipeline can recover the injected parameters using the observed mass distribution. However, when the mock mass distribution of the astrophysical population depends slightly on redshift and one is ignorant about it in analyzing the data, it can cause a systematic discrepancy in the inferred value of $H_0$ by about $1.5\sigma$, above the statistical fluctuations due to noise and a limited number of events. The discrepancy in $H_0$ is arising due to astrophysical mis-modeling, and in the future, elaborate studies will be required to mitigate systematic uncertainties due to unknown astrophysical populations of BBHs. This MDC framework sets the road map for inspecting the precision and accuracy of standard siren cosmology and provides the first insight into the robustness of the population-dependent cosmology inference in a blinded analysis setup.

 - **Abstract**
 ``Little Red Dots'' (LRDs) are an abundant high-redshift population newly discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). They are characterized by a red color in the rest-frame optical band, compact morphology, and broad Balmer emission lines (${\rm FWHM} \gtrsim 1000~{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$) that suggest an AGN nature. Using a method of pixel-by-pixel color selection and relaxing the compactness criteria, we identify three of the first dual LRD candidates in the COSMOS-Web survey with projected separations of $0.\!\!^{\prime\prime}2-0.\!\!^{\prime\prime}4$ (1-2 pkpc at their photometric redshifts). A comparison between existing LRD samples and mock data reveals that the projected separations of these dual LRD candidates are unlikely to result from chance projections of objects at different redshifts. In one case (CW-B5-15958), the dual LRD includes two bright sources ($m_{\rm F444W}=24.3$ and $24.8$) with characteristic V-shape spectral energy distribution (SEDs) and photometric redshifts consistent with each other. We find that CW-B5-15958 has a faint off-centered component and a companion galaxy. In the other two dual systems, the brighter LRD exhibits a V-shape SED, while the fainter LRD ($m_{\rm F444W}\gtrsim26$) is undetected in both F115W and F150W. These discoveries suggest that the angular auto-correlation function (ACF) of LRDs exhibits a significant excess ($\sim3\times10^2$ times) on sub-arcsec (kilo-parsec) separations compared to the extrapolation of a power-law ACF of JWST-found AGNs measured over $10^{\prime\prime}-100^{\prime\prime}$. Follow-up spectroscopic confirmation of their redshifts and the construction of a larger sample are essential to advance our understanding of the evolution of supermassive black holes and the importance of mergers in the early universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Early JWST observations are providing growing evidence for a ubiquitous population of accreting supermassive black holes (BHs) at high redshift, many of which appear overmassive compared to the empirically-derived local scaling relation between black hole mass and host galaxy stellar mass. In this study, we leverage predictions from the semi-analytical Cosmic Archaeology Tool (CAT) to reconstruct the evolutionary pathways for this overmassive BH population, investigating how they assemble over cosmic time and interact with their host galaxies. We find that the large $M_{\rm BH}-M_{\rm star}$ ratios can be explained if light and heavy BH seeds grow by short, repeated episodes of super-Eddington accretion, triggered by major galaxy mergers. On average, we find that BH-galaxy co-evolution starts in earnest only at $z < 8$, when $\simeq 30\%$ of the final galaxy stellar mass has formed outside the massive black hole host. Our model suggests that super-Eddington bursts of accretion last between $0.5-3$ Myr, resulting in a duty cycle of $1-4 \%$ for the target BH sample. The boost in luminosity of BHs undergoing super-Eddington accretion helps explaining the luminosity function of Active Galactic Nuclei observed by JWST. At the same time, a large population of these overmassive BHs are predicted to be inactive, with Eddington ratio $\lambda_{\rm Edd} < 0.05$, in agreement with recent observations.

 - **Abstract**
 We used random forest algorithms to classify all objects in a large portion of the sky, using optical light curves obtained, or built from images provided, by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). We compare different selection sets based on alerts or complete light curves derived from different photometric selection algorithms. The AGN candidates thus selected are cross-matched with objects in the NASA-Sloan Atlas (NSA) of local galaxies, with $M_*<2\times10^{10}M_\odot$. The AGN nature of these candidates is verified and characterized using archival optical spectra from SDSS. We further establish the fraction of candidates with counterparts in the eROSITA data release 1 catalog of X-ray sources. From an initial sample of 506 candidates, 415 have good-quality spectra. Among these 415 objects, we found significant broad Balmer lines in the spectra for $86\%$ (357) of the candidates. When considering BPT classifications, an additional 5 candidates were confirmed, resulting in $87\%$ (362) confirmed candidates. Specifically, broad Balmer lines were detected in $94\%$-$98\%$ of the AGN candidates selected from complete light curves and in $80\%$ of those selected from the less frequent ZTF alerts. The black hole masses estimated from the spectra range from $2.2\times10^6M_\odot$ to $4.2\times10^7M_\odot$, reaching lower values for the candidates selected using the more sensitive light curves. The black hole masses obtained cluster around $0.1\%$ of the stellar mass of the host from the NSA catalog. Two-thirds of the AGN candidates are classified as Seyfert or Composite by their narrow emission line ratios (BPT diagnostics) while the rest are star-forming. Almost all the candidates classified as Seyfert and over $50\%$ of those classified as star-forming have significant BELs. We found X-ray counterparts for $67\%$ of the candidates that fall in the footprint of the eROSITA-DE DR1.
#### Deep Swift/UVOT Observations of GOODS-N and the Evolution of the Ultraviolet Luminosity Function at 0.2<z<1.2

 - **Abstract**
 We present Swift Ultraviolet Optical Telescope (UVOT) observations of the deep field GOODS-N in four near-UV filters. A catalog of detected galaxies is reported, which will be used to explore galaxy evolution using ultraviolet emission. Swift/UVOT observations probe galaxies at $z \lesssim 1.5$ and combine a wide field of view with moderate spatial resolution; these data complement the wide-field observations of GALEX and the deep, high angular resolution observations by HST. Using our catalog of detected galaxies, we calculate the UV galaxy number counts as a function of apparent magnitude and compute the UV luminosity function and its evolution with redshift. From the luminosity function fits in various redshift bins, we calculate the star formation rate density as a function of redshift and find evolution consistent with past works. We explore how different assumptions such as dust attenuation corrections can dramatically change how quickly the corrected star formation rate density changes with redshift. At these low redshifts, we find no trend between UV attenuation and redshift or absolute magnitude with significant scatter in the UV spectral slope $\beta$. This dataset will complement the extensive observations of GOODS-N already in the literature.

 - **Abstract**
 UHECR are evaluated in the frame role of different nuclei composition . Most of the past and present models are considering proton or iron as their main courier. Some attention has been paid to the role of the UHECR light nuclei in recent years. We update here the lightest nuclei UHECR model, able to explain the nearest AGN or Star Burst sources with the few observed Hot Spot clustering in AUGER and TA array data. Any additional components of the heaviest nuclei with the highest energy, more bent and smeared, may also fit recent AUGER and TA homogeneous records at those energy edges.

 - **Abstract**
 With the low Earth orbit environment becoming increasingly populated with artificial satellites, rockets, and debris, it is important to understand the effects they have on radio astronomy. In this work, we undertake a multi-frequency, multi-epoch survey with two SKA-Low station prototypes located at the SKA-Low site, to identify and characterise radio frequency emission from orbiting objects and consider their impact on radio astronomy observations. We identified 152 unique satellites across multiple passes in low and medium Earth orbits from 1.6 million full-sky images across 13 selected ${\approx}1$ MHz frequency bands in the SKA-Low frequency range, acquired over almost 20 days of data collection. Our algorithms significantly reduce the rate of satellite misidentification, compared to previous work, validated through simulations to be $<1\%$. Notably, multiple satellites were detected transmitting unintended electromagnetic radiation, as well as several decommissioned satellites likely transmitting when the Sun illuminates their solar panels. We test alternative methods of processing data, which will be deployed for a larger, more systematic survey at SKA-Low frequencies in the near future. The current work establishes a baseline for monitoring satellite transmissions, which will be repeated in future years to assess their evolving impact on radio astronomy observations.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyzed a sample of $\sim$113,000 galaxies ($\rm z < 0.3$) from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, divided into star-forming, composite, Seyfert, and LINER types, to explore the relationships between UV-to-optical colors ($\rm u-r$), star formation rates (SFRs), specific star formation rates (sSFRs), stellar velocity dispersions ($\rm \sigma_{*}$), mass accretion rates onto the black hole ($\rm L_{[OIII]}/\sigma_{*}^{4}$), and Eddington ratios. Star-forming galaxies predominantly feature young, blue stars along the main-sequence (MS) line, while composite, Seyfert, and LINER galaxies deviate from this line, displaying progressively older stellar populations and lower SFRs. $\rm L_{[OIII]}/\sigma_{*}^{4}$ and Eddington ratios are highest in Seyfert galaxies, moderate in composite galaxies, and lowest in LINERs, with higher ratios associated with bluer colors, indicating a younger stellar population and stronger active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity. These trends suggest a strong correlation between sSFRs and Eddington ratios, highlighting a close connection between AGN and star formation activities. These results may imply an evolutionary sequence where galaxies transition from blue star-forming galaxies to red LINERs, passing through composite and Seyfert phases, driven primarily by gas supply, with AGN feedback playing a secondary role. While both radio luminosities ($\rm L_{1.4GHz}$) and Eddington ratios correlate with SFRs, their trends differ on the SFR$-$stellar mass ($\rm M_{*}$) plane, with radio luminosities increasing with stellar mass along the MS line, and no direct connection between radio luminosities and Eddington ratios. These findings may provide new insights into the interplay between star formation, AGN activity, and radio emission in galaxies, shedding light on their evolutionary pathways.

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate primary beam calibration is essential for precise brightness measurements in radio astronomy. The VLA Low-band Ionosphere and Transient Experiment (VLITE) faces challenges in calibration due to the offset Cassegrain optics used in its commensal observing system. This study aims to develop a novel calibration method to improve accuracy with no impact on the Very Large Array (VLA) primary science observations. We used the apparent brightness of standard candles identified in VLITE's commensal data to develop 1D and 2D primary beam response models. These models accounted for operational changes and asymmetries caused by the subreflector and were validated against holographic methods and compact source light curves. The models achieved calibration accuracy within 3 percent across the field of view, significantly improving the precision of brightness measurements. The results were consistent with holography-derived solutions and performed reliably under different operational conditions. This improved calibration technique expands VLITE's capabilities for studying active galactic nuclei, transients, and pulsars. It offers a cost-effective alternative to traditional holographic methods, facilitating broader use in commensal observing systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Weak gravitational lensing requires precise measurements of galaxy shapes and therefore an accurate knowledge of the PSF model. The latter can be a source of systematics that affect the shear two-point correlation function. A key stake of weak lensing analysis is to forecast the systematics due to the PSF. Correlation functions of galaxies and the PSF, the so-called $\rho$- and $\tau$-statistics, are used to evaluate the level of systematics coming from the PSF model and PSF corrections, and contributing to the two-point correlation function used to perform cosmological inference. Our goal is to introduce a fast and simple method to estimate this level of systematics and assess its agreement with state-of-the-art approaches. We introduce a new way to estimate the covariance matrix of the $\tau$-statistics using analytical expressions. The covariance allows us to estimate parameters directly related to the level of systematics associated with the PSF and provides us with a tool to validate the PSF model used in a weak-lensing analysis. We apply those methods to data from the Ultraviolet Near-Infrared Optical Northern Survey (UNIONS). We show that the semi-analytical covariance yields comparable results than using covariances obtained from simulations or jackknife resampling. It requires less computation time and is therefore well suited for rapid comparison of the systematic level obtained from different catalogs. We also show how one can break degeneracies between parameters with a redefinition of the $\tau$-statistics. The methods developed in this work will be useful tools in the analysis of current weak-lensing data but also of Stage IV surveys such as Euclid, LSST or Roman. They provide fast and accurate diagnostics on PSF systematics that are crucial to understand in the context of cosmic shear studies.

 - **Abstract**
 The Ly$\alpha$ emission line is a characteristic feature found in high-$z$ galaxies, serving as a probe of cosmic reionization. While previous works present various correlations between Ly$\alpha$ emission and physical properties of host galaxies, it is still unclear which characteristics predominantly determine the Ly$\alpha$ emission. In this study, we introduce a neural network approach to simultaneously handle multiple properties of galaxies. The neural-network-based prediction model that identifies Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) from six physical properties: star formation rate (SFR), stellar mass, UV absolute magnitude $M_\mathrm{UV}$, age, UV slope $\beta$, and dust attenuation $E(B-V)$, obtained by the SED fitting. The network is trained with galaxy samples from the VANDELS and MUSE spectroscopic surveys and achieves the performance of 77% true positive rate and 14% false positive rate. The permutation feature importance method shows that $\beta$, $M_\mathrm{UV}$, and $M_*$ are important for the prediction of LAEs. As an independent validation, we find that 91% of LAEs spectroscopically confirmed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have a probability of LAE higher than 70% in this model. This prediction model enables the efficient construction of a large LAE sample in a wide and continuous redshift space using only photometric data. We apply the prediction model to the JWST photometric galaxy sample and obtain Ly$\alpha$ fraction consistent with previous studies. Moreover, we demonstrate that the difference between the distributions of LAEs predicted by the model and the spectroscopically identified LAEs provides a strong constraint on the HII bubble size.

 - **Abstract**
 Merger events are thought to be an important phase in the assembly of massive galaxies. At the same time, Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) play a fundamental role in the evolution of their star formation histories. Both phenomena can be observed at work in NGC 6240, a local prototypical merger, classified as an UltraLuminous InfraRed Galaxy (ULIRG) thanks to its elevated infrared luminosity. Interestingly, NGC 6240 hosts two AGN separated by 1.5''(~ 735 pc), detected in both X-ray and radio band. Taking advantage of the unprecedented sensitivity and wavelength coverage provided by the Integral Field Unit (IFU) of the NIRSpec instrument onboard JWST, we observed the nuclear region of NGC 6240 in a FoV of 3.7'' x 3.7''(1.9 x 1.9 kpc^2), to investigate gas kinematics and InterStellar Medium (ISM) properties with a high spatial resolution of ~ 0.1'' (or ~ 50 pc). We separated the different gas kinematic components through multi-Gaussian fitting and studied the excitation properties of the ISM from the NIR diagnostic diagram based on the H_2 1-0 S(1)/BrGamma and [Fe II]1.257micron/PaBeta lines ratios. We isolated the ionization cones of the two nuclei, and detected coronal lines emission from both of them. Using H_2 line ratios, we found that the molecular hydrogen gas is excited mostly by thermal processes. We computed a hot molecular gas mass of 1.3 x 10^5 M_sun and an ionized gas mass in the range of 10^5 - 10^7 M_sun. We studied with unprecedented spatial resolution and sensitivity the kinematics of the molecular and ionized gas phases. We revealed the complex structure of the molecular gas and found a blueshifted outflow near the Southern nucleus, together with filaments connecting a highly redshifted H_2 cloud with the two nuclei. We speculate on the possible nature of this H_2 cloud and propose two possible scenarios: either outflowing gas, or a tidal cloud falling onto the nuclei.
#### MICONIC: Dual active galactic nuclei, star formation, and ionised gas outflows in NGC 6240 seen with MIRI/JWST

 - **Abstract**
 As part of the guaranteed time observations program Mid-Infrared Characterization Of Nearby Iconic galaxy Centers (MICONIC), we used the medium-resolution spectrometer (MRS) of the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) on board of the JWST to study the nearby merger NGC6240. We aim to characterise the dual active galactic nuclei (AGN), the ionised gas outflows and the main properties of the interstellar medium over a mapped area of 6.6"x7.7". We obtained integral field spectroscopic mid-infrared data of NGC6240, resolving both nuclei for the first time in the full 5-28{\mu}m spectral range. We modelled the emission lines through a kinematic decomposition, finding that the fine-structure lines in the southern (S) nucleus are broader than for the northern (N) nucleus (full width at half maximum of $\geq$1500 vs ~700 km s^{-1} on average). High excitation lines, such as [NeV], [NeVI], and [MgV], are clearly detected in the N nucleus. In the S nucleus, the same lines can be detected but only after a decomposition of the PAH features in the integrated spectrum, due to a combination of a strong mid-IR continuum, the broad emission lines, and the intense star formation (SF). The SF is distributed all over the mapped FoV of 3.5kpc x 4.1kpc (projected), with the maximum located around the S nucleus. Both nuclear regions appear to be connected by a bridge region detected with all the emission lines. Based on the observed MRS line ratios and the high velocity dispersion ({\sigma}~600 km s^{-1}), shocks are also dominating the emission in this system. We detected the presence of outflows as a bubble north-west from the N nucleus and at the S nucleus. We estimated a ionised mass outflow rate of 1.4$\pm$0.3 M yr^{-1} and 1.8$\pm$0.2 M yr^{-1}, respectively. Given the derived kinetic power of these outflows, both the AGN and the starburst could have triggered them. [Abridged]

 - **Abstract**
 We present new radio images of the supernova remnant (SNR) CTA 1 at 1420 and 408 MHz, and in the 21 cm line of H I observed with the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory Synthesis Telescope and at 1420 MHz observed with the Effelsberg 100 m telescope. We confirm previously described continuum features and elaborate further on filamentary features identified using the high-resolution (1') maps from these new observations. We investigate the abrupt change in sign of rotation measure (RM) across the SNR, using the linear polarization observations in the four bands around 1420 MHz. Following X. H. Sun et al.'s (2011) investigation, we both confirm that the distribution of signs of the RMs for extragalactic sources in the area appears to match that of the shell, as well as combine the data from the four bands to estimate the relative depolarization and the intrinsic rotation measure of the SNR. We do not conclusively reject X. H. Sun et al.'s (2011) claim of a Faraday screen in the foreground causing the distribution of RMs that we observe; however, we do suggest an alternative explanation of a swept-up stellar wind from the progenitor star with a toroidal magnetic field. Finally, we expand on the analysis of the H I observations by applying the Rolling Hough Transform to isolate filamentary structure and better identify H I emission with the SNR. Further constraining the H I velocity channels associated with CTA 1, we use more recent Galactic rotation curves to calculate an updated kinematic distance of 1.09 +/- 0.2 kpc.

 - **Abstract**
 Arp 220 is the prototypical Ultraluminous Infrared Galaxy (ULIRG), and one of the brightest objects in the extragalactic far-infrared sky. It is the result of a merger between two gas rich spiral galaxies which has triggered starbursting activity in the merger nuclear regions. Observations with the Submillimeter Array centred at a frequency of 345 GHz and with a synthesised beamsize of 0.77 x 0.45 arcseconds were used to search for polarized dust emission from the nuclear regions of Arp 220. Polarized dust emission was clearly detected at 6 sigma significance associated with the brighter, western nucleus, with a peak polarization fraction of 2.7 +/- 0.35 per cent somewhat offset from the western nucleus. A suggestive 2.6 sigma signal is seen from the fainter eastern nucleus. The dust emission polarization is oriented roughly perpendicular to the molecular disk in the western nucleus suggesting that the magnetic field responsible is orientated broadly in the plane of the disk, but may be being reordered by the interaction between the two nuclei. Unlike more evolved interacting systems, we see no indication that the magnetic field is being reordered by the outflow from the western nucleus. These observations are the first detection of dust polarization, and thus of magnetic fields, in the core of a ULIRG.

 - **Abstract**
 The driving and excitation mechanisms of decay-less kink oscillations in coronal loops remain under debate. We aim to quantify and provide simple observational constraints on the photospheric driving of oscillating coronal loops in a few typical active region configurations: sunspot, plage, pores and enhanced-network regions. We then aim to investigate the possible interplay between photospheric driving and properties of kink oscillations in connected coronal loops. We analyse two unique datasets of the corona and photosphere taken at a high resolution during the first coordinated observation campaign between Solar Orbiter and the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST). A local correlation tracking method is applied on the SST/CRISP data to quantify the photospheric motions at the base of coronal loops. The same loops are then analysed in the corona by exploiting data from the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager on Solar Orbiter, and by using a wavelet analysis to characterize the kink oscillations. Each photospheric region shows dynamics with an overall increase in strength going from pore, plage, enhanced-network to sunspot regions. Differences are also seen in the kink-mode amplitudes of the corresponding coronal loops. This suggests the photosphere is involved in the driving of coronal kink oscillations. However, the few samples available does not allow to further establish the excitation mechanism yet. Despite oscillating coronal loops being anchored in seemingly "static" strong magnetic field regions as seen from coronal EUV observations, photospheric observations provide evidence for a continuous and significant driving at their base. The precise connection between photospheric driving and coronal kink oscillations remains to be further investigated. This study finally provides critical constraints on photospheric driving that can be tested in existing numerical models of coronal loops.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic fields present in the Large Scale Structure (LSS) of the Universe change polarization of radio waves arriving from distant extragalactic sources through the effect of Faraday rotation. This effect has been recently used to detect magnetic field in the LSS filaments based on the Rotation Measure data of the LOFAR Two-Meter Sky Survey (LoTSS). We notice that the same data also constrain the strength of the volume-filling magnetic field in the voids of the LSS. We use the LoTSS data to to derive an improved upper bound on the volume-filling field. The new upper bound provides an order of magnitude improvement on the previous Faraday rotation bounds. The new Faraday Rotation bound on the scale-invariant field that may originate from the epoch of inflation is also an order of magnitude lower than the bound on such field derived from the anisotropy analysis of the Cosmic Microwave Background.

 - **Abstract**
 Astrometric microlensing events occur when a massive object passes between a distant source and the observer, causing a shift of the light centroid. The precise astrometric measurements of the Gaia mission provide an unprecedented opportunity to detect and analyze these events, revealing properties of lensing objects such as their mass and distance. We develop and test the Gaia Astrometric Microlensing Events (GAME) Filter, a software tool to identify astrometric microlensing events and derive lensing object properties. We generated mock Gaia observations for different magnitudes, number of Gaia visits, and events extending beyond Gaia's observational run. We applied GAME Filter to these datasets and validated its performance. We also assessed the rate of false positives where binary astrometric systems are misidentified as microlensing events. GAME Filter successfully recovers microlensing parameters for strong events. Parameters are more difficult to recover for short events and those extending beyond Gaia's run, where only a fraction of the events is observed. The astrometric effect breaks the degeneracy in the microlensing parallax present in photometric microlensing. For fainter sources, the observed signal weakens, reducing recovered events and increasing parameter errors. However, even for Gaia G-band magnitude 19, parameters can be recovered for Einstein radii above two mas. Observing regions with varying numbers of Gaia visits has minimal impact on filter accuracy when the number of visits exceeds 90. Additionally, even if the peak of a microlensing event lies outside Gaia's run, microlensing parameters can still be recovered. We also tested the sensitivity to contamination and found that 5 percent of binary systems were misclassified. GAME Filter characterizes lenses with astrometry-only data for lens masses from approximately 1 to 20 solar masses and distances up to 6 kpc.

 - **Abstract**
 Time-delay interferometry (TDI) suppresses laser frequency noise by forming linear combinations of time-shifted interferometric measurements. The time-shift operation is implemented by interpolating discretely sampled data. To enable in-band laser noise reduction by eight to nine orders of magnitude, interpolation has to be performed with high accuracy. Optimizing the design of those interpolation methods is the focus of this work. Previous research that studied constant time-shifts suggested Lagrange interpolation as the interpolation method for TDI. Its transfer function performs well at low frequency but requires a high number of coefficients. Furthermore, when applied in TDI we observed prominent time-domain features when a time-varying shift scanned over a pure integer sample shift. To limit this effect we identify an additional requirement for the interpolation kernel: when considering time-varying shifts the interpolation kernel must be sufficiently smooth to avoid unwanted time-domain transitions that produce glitch-like features in power spectral density estimates. The Lagrange interpolation kernel exhibits a discontinuous first derivative by construction, which is insufficient for the application to LISA or other space-based GW observatories. As a solution we propose a novel design method for interpolation kernels that respect a predefined requirement on in-band interpolation residuals and that possess continuous derivatives up to a prescribed order. Using this method we show that an interpolation kernel with 22 coefficients is sufficient to respect LISA's picometre-requirement and to allow for a continuous first derivative which suppresses the magnitude of the time-domain transition adequately. The reduction from 42 (Lagrange interpolation) to 22 coefficients enables us to save computational cost and increases robustness against artefacts in the data.

 - **Abstract**
 The direct collapse scenario, which predicts the formation of supermassive stars (SMSs) as precursors to supermassive black holes (SMBHs), has been explored primarily under the assumption of metal-free conditions. However, environments exposed to strong far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation, which is another requirement for the direct collapse, are often chemically enriched to varying degrees. In this study, we perform radiation hydrodynamic simulations of star-cluster formation in clouds with finite metallicities, $Z=10^{-6}$ to $10^{-2} Z_{\odot}$, incorporating detailed thermal and chemical processes and radiative feedback from forming stars. Extending the simulations to approximately two million years, we demonstrate that SMSs with masses exceeding $10^4~M_\odot$ can form even in metal-enriched clouds with $Z \lesssim 10^{-3} Z_{\odot}$. The accretion process in these cases, driven by "super-competitive accretion," preferentially channels gas into central massive stars in spite of small (sub-pc) scale fragmentation. At $Z \simeq 10^{-2} Z_{\odot}$, however, enhanced cooling leads to intense fragmentation on larger scales, resulting in the formation of dense star clusters dominated by very massive stars with $10^3 M_{\odot}$ rather than SMSs. These clusters resemble young massive or globular clusters observed in the distant and local universe, exhibiting compact morphologies and high stellar surface densities. Our findings suggest that SMS formation is viable below a metallicity threshold of approximately $10^{-3} Z_{\odot}$, significantly increasing the number density of massive seed black holes to levels sufficient to account for the ubiquitous SMBHs observed in the local universe. Moreover, above this metallicity, this scenario naturally explains the transition from SMS formation to dense stellar cluster formation.

 - **Abstract**
 In 2017, as the solar cycle approached solar minimum, an unusually long and large depression was observed in galactic cosmic ray (GCR) protons, detected with the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS-02), lasting for the second half of that year. The depression, as seen in the Bartel rotation-averaged proton flux, has the form of a Forbush decrease (FD). Despite this resemblance, however, the cause of the observed depression does not have such a simple explanation as FDs, due to coronal mass ejections (CMEs), typically last for a few days at 1 AU rather than half a year. In this work, we seek the cause of the observed depression and investigate two main possibilities. First, we consider a mini-cycle - a temporary change in the solar dynamo that changes the behavior of the global solar magnetic field and, by this, the modulation of GCRs. Secondly, we investigate the behavior of solar activity, both CMEs and co-rotating/stream interactions regions (C/SIRs), during this period. Our findings show that, although there is some evidence for mini-cycle behavior prior to the depression, the depression is ultimately due to a combination of recurrent CMEs, SIRs and CIRs. A particular characteristic of the depression is that the largest impacts that help to create and maintain it are due to four CMEs from the same, highly active, magnetic source that persists for several solar rotations. This active magnetic source is unusual given the closeness of the solar cycle to solar minimum, which also helps to make the depression more evident.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observational results from asteroseismic studies show that an important fraction of solar-like stars do not present detectable stochastically excited acoustic oscillations. This non-detectability seems to correlate with a high rotation rate in the convective envelope and a high surface magnetic activity. At the same time, the properties of stellar convection are affected by rotation and magnetism. We investigate the role of rotation in the excitation of acoustic modes in the convective envelope of solar-like stars, to evaluate its impact on the energy injected in the oscillations. We derive theoretical prescriptions for the excitation of acoustic waves in the convective envelope of rotating solar-like stars. We adopt the Rotating Mixing-Length Theory to model the influence of rotation on convection. We use the MESA stellar evolution code and the GYRE stellar oscillation code to estimate the power injected in the oscillations from our theoretical prescriptions. We demonstrate that the power injected in the acoustic modes is insensitive to the rotation if a Gaussian time-correlation function is assumed, while it can decrease by up to 60 % for a Lorentzian time-correlation function, for a $20 \Omega_{\odot}$ rotation rate. This result can allow us to better constrain the properties of stellar convection by studying observationally acoustic modes excitation. These results demonstrate how important it is to take into account the modification of stellar convection by rotation when evaluating the amplitude of the stellar oscillations it stochastically excites. They open the path for understanding the large variety of observed acoustic-mode amplitudes at the surface of solar-like stars as a function of surface rotation rates.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar spin is one of the fundamental quantities that characterize a star itself and its planetary system. Nevertheless, stellar spin-down mechanisms in protostellar and pre-main-sequence stellar phases have been a long-standing problem in the star formation theory. To realize the spin-down, previous axisymmetric models based on the conventional magnetospheric paradigm have to assume massive stellar winds or produce highly time-variable magnetospheric ejections. However, this picture has been challenged by both numerical simulations and observations. With a particular focus on the propeller regime for solar-mass stars, we propose a new picture of stellar spin-down based on our recent three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamic simulation and stellar evolution calculation. We show that failed magnetospheric winds, unique to 3D models, significantly reduce the spin-up accretion torque, which make it easier for the star to spin-down. Additionally, the amplitude of time variability associated with magnetospheric ejections is reduced by 3D effects. Our simulation demonstrates that the star spins down by generating a conical disk wind, driven by a rotating stellar magnetosphere. Our theoretical estimates, inspired by the numerical model, suggest that the conical disk wind is likely to play a crucial role in extracting stellar angular momentum during the protostellar phase. As magnetospheric accretion is expected to occur in other accreting objects such as proto-giant planets, this study will also contribute to the understanding of the angular momentum of such objects.
#### GA-NIFS: interstellar medium properties and tidal interactions in the evolved massive merging system B14-65666 at z = 7.152

 - **Abstract**
 We present JWST/NIRSpec IFU observations of the z=7.152 galaxy system B14-65666, as part of the GA-NIFS survey. Line and continuum emission in this massive system (log10(M*/Msol)=9.8+/-0.2) is resolved into two strong cores, two weaker clumps, and a faint arc, as seen in recent JWST/NIRCam imaging. Our dataset contains detections of [OII]3727,3729, [NeIII]3869,3968, Balmer lines (HBeta, HGamma, HDelta, HEpsilon, HZeta), [OIII]5007, and weak [OIII]4363. Each spectrum is fit with a model that consistently incorporates interstellar medium conditions (i.e., electron temperature, T_e, electron density, n_e, and colour excess, E(B-V)). The resulting line fluxes are used to constrain the gas-phase metallicity (~0.3-0.4 solar) and HBeta-based SFR (310+/-40 Msol/yr) for each region. Common line ratio diagrams (O32-R23, R3-R2, Ne3O2-R23) reveal that each line-emitting region lies at the intersection of local and high-redshift galaxies, suggesting low ionisation and higher metallicity compared to the predominantly lower-mass galaxies studied with the JWST/NIRSpec IFU so far at z>5.5. Spaxel-by-spaxel fits reveal evidence for both narrow (FWHM<400 km/s) and broad (FWHM >500 km/s) line emission, the latter of which likely represents tidal interaction or outflows. Comparison to ALMA [CII]158um and [OIII]88um data shows a similar velocity structure, and optical-far infrared diagnostics suggest regions of high Lyman continuum escape fraction and n_e. This source lies on the mass-metallicity relation at z>4, suggesting an evolved nature. The two core galaxies show contrasting properties (e.g., SFR, M*, gas-phase metallicity), suggesting distinct evolutionary pathways. Combining the NIRSpec IFU and ALMA data sets, our analysis opens new windows into the merging system B14-65666.

 - **Abstract**
 For over two decades, CORSIKA 7 and its previous versions have been the leading Monte Carlo code for simulating extensive air showers. However, its monolithic Fortran-based software design and hand-optimized code has created challenges for maintenance, adaptation to new computing paradigms, and extensions for more complex simulations. Addressing these limitations, the CORSIKA 8 project represents a comprehensive rewrite of CORSIKA 7, seeing its core functionality re-envisioned in a modern and modular C++ framework. CORSIKA 8 has now reached a "physics-complete" state, offering a robust platform that encourages expert development for specialized applications. It supports high-energy hadronic interactions using models such as Sibyll 2.3d, QGSJet-II.04, EPOS-LHC, and Pythia 8.3, alongside the treatment of electromagnetic cascades with PROPOSAL 7.6.2. Key highlights are the support for multiple interaction media, including cross-media particle showers, and an enhanced calculation of radio emissions from particle showers. This contribution provides an overview of the current functionalities, showcases validation results of its simulations, and discusses future development plans.
#### Revisiting the Classics: On the Optical Colours of Novae as Standard Crayons

 - **Abstract**
 We present a systematic study of the $BVRI$ colours of novae over the course of their eruptions. Where possible, interstellar reddening was measured using the equivalent widths of Diffuse Interstellar Bands (DIBs). Some novae lack spectra with sufficient resolution and signal-to-noise ratios; therefore, we supplement as necessary with 3D and 2D dust maps. Utilising only novae with DIB- or 3D-map-based $E(B-V)$, we find an average intrinsic $(B-V)_0$ colour of novae at $V$-band light curve peak of 0.18 with a standard deviation of 0.31, based on a sample of 23 novae. When the light curve has declined by 2 magnitudes ($t_2$), we find an average $(B-V)_0 = -0.02$ with a standard deviation of 0.19. These average colours are consistent with previous findings, although the spreads are larger than previously found due to more accurate reddening estimates. We also examined the intrinsic $(R-I)_0$ and $(V-R)_0$ colours across our sample. These colours behave similarly to $(B-V)_0$, except that the $(V-R)_0$ colour gets redder after peak, likely due to the contributions of emission line flux. We searched for correlations between nova colours and $t_2$, peak $V$-band absolute magnitude, and GeV $\gamma$-ray luminosity, but find no statistically significant correlations. Nova colours can therefore be used as standard "crayons" to estimate interstellar reddening from photometry alone, with 0.2--0.3 mag uncertainty. We present a novel Bayesian strategy for estimating distances to Galactic novae based on these $E(B-V)$ measurements, independent of assumptions about luminosity, built using 3D dust maps and a stellar mass model of the Milky Way.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the discovery of 14 new (and recovery of 4 known) low accretion rate magnetic white dwarfs in post-common envelope binaries that emit strong cyclotron emission using the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) light curves, doubling the known sample size. In addition, we discovered a candidate magnetic period bouncer and recovered three known ones. We confirmed the presence of cyclotron emission using low-resolution spectra in 19 objects. Using the ZTF light curves, follow-up spectra, and the spectral energy distribution, we measured the orbital period, magnetic field strength, and white dwarf temperature of each system. Although the phase-folded light curves have diverse shapes and show a much larger variability amplitude, we show that their intrinsic properties (e.g. period distribution, magnetic field strength) are similar to those of previously known systems. The diversity in light curve shapes can be explained by differences in the optical depth of the accretion spot and geometric differences, the inclination angle and the magnetic spot latitude. The evolutionary states of the longer period binaries are somewhat uncertain but are vary; we found systems consistent with being pre-polars, detached polars, or low-state polars. In addition, we discovered two new low-state polars that likely have brown dwarf companions and could be magnetic period bouncers.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultralight axions (ULAs) with masses $10^{-33} \lesssim m/{\rm eV} \lesssim 10^{-12}$ are well motivated in string-inspired models and can be part or all of the dark energy or the dark matter in this range. Since the ULA field oscillates at a frequency $m$ that can be much larger than the expansion rate $H$, accurate and efficient calculation of cosmological observables requires an effective time averaged treatment. While these are well established for $m\gg 10 H_{\rm eq}$, the Hubble rate at matter radiation equality, here we extend and develop these techniques to cover the mass range $10^{-33} \lesssim m/{\rm eV} \lesssim 10^{-18}$. We implement this technique in a full cosmological Boltzmann code ($\mathrm{AxiECAMB}$) with numerical precision sufficiently accurate for current and next-generation cosmic microwave background as well as large-scale structure data analysis. New effects including the time averaging of metric perturbations and hydrostatic equilibrium of the effective fluid result in many orders of magnitude improvements for power spectra accuracy over some previous treatments such as $\mathrm{AxionCAMB}$ in some extreme regions of parameter space and order unity changes of the ULA effects near $\Lambda$CDM models. These improvements may impact the model parameters that resolve various tensions in $\Lambda$CDM at a comparable level.
