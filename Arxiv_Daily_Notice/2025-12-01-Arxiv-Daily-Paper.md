 - **Abstract**
 We investigated an isolated, globule-shaped object (0.37x0.11 pc), located near the centre of the Cygnus OB2 cluster and named proplyd #7 in optical observations. The source can be a massive star (with or without disc) with a HII region or a G-type T Tauri star with a photo-evaporating disc, embedded in a molecular envelope. We obtained a map of the OI line at 63 micron with 6" angular resolution and employed archival data of the CII 158 micron line (14" resolution), using the upGREAT heterodyne receiver aboard SOFIA. We also collected IRAM 30m CO data at 1mm (11" resolution). All the lines were detected across the whole object. The peak integrated OI emission of ~5 K km/s is located ~10" west of an embedded YSO. The OI and CII data near the source show bulk emission at ~11 km/s and a line wing at ~13 km/s, while the 12CO 2-1 data reveal additional blue-shifted high-velocity emission. The KOSMA-tau PDR model can explain the emissions in the tail with a low external UV field (<350 Go, mostly consistent with our UV field estimates), but not at the location of the YSO. There, the high line intensities and increased line widths for all lines and a possible bipolar CO outflow suggest the presence of a protostellar disc. However, the existence of a thermal HII region, revealed by combining existing and new radio continuum data, points towards a massive star - and not a T Tauri-type one. We derived molecular and atomic gas masses of ~20 Msun and a few Msun, respectively. The photo-evaporation (only considering external illumination) lifetime of 1.6x10^5 yrs is shorter than the free-fall lifetime of 5.2x10^5 yrs; thus, we find that proplyd #7 might not have had the time to produce many more stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Internal magnetic fields are an elusive component of stellar structure. However, they can play an important role in stellar structure and evolution models through efficient angular momentum transport and their impact on internal mixing. We strive to explain the 9 components of one frequency multiplet, identified as a low-order quadrupole gravity mode detected in the light curve of the beta Cep pulsator HD 192575 assembled by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). We update the frequencies of the quadrupole mode under investigation using a standard prewhitening method applied to the 1951.46 d TESS light curve, showing that an internal magnetic field is required to simultaneously explain all 9 components. We implement theoretical pulsation computations applicable to the low-order modes of a beta Cep pulsator including the Coriolis force, as well as a magnetic field that is misaligned with respect to the rotation axis. We apply the theoretical description to perform asteroseismic modelling of the amplitudes and frequencies in the multiplet of the quadrupole g-mode of this evolved beta Cep star. Pulsation predictions based on the measured internal rotation frequency of the star cannot explain the observed 9-component frequency splittings of the quadrupole low-order gravity mode. By contrast, we show that the combined effect of the Coriolis force caused by the near-core rotation with a period of about 5.3 d and the Lorentz force due to an internal inclined magnetic field with a maximum strength of around 24 kG does provide a proper explanation of the 9 multiplet frequencies and their relative amplitudes. Given the stellar mass of about 12 solar masses, this work presents the detection and magneto-gravito-asteroseismic modelling of a stable internal magnetic field buried inside an evolved rotating supernova progenitor.

 - **Abstract**
 Despite being only the 19th most abundant element in the interstellar medium, chlorine's reactivity and volatility give rise to a unique interstellar chemistry, favouring the formation of several chlorine-bearing hydrides. Further, the $^{35}\text{Cl}/ ^{37}$Cl ratio probes nucleosynthesis across the Galaxy. Yet, studies of Cl-bearing molecules have remained limited to a few sightlines due to observational challenges. We systematically investigated the Galactic distribution of HCl and the [H$^{35}$Cl]/[H$^{37}$Cl] ratio in high-mass star-forming regions. As a probe of a region's nucleosynthesis history, this ratio may constrain predictions of Galactic chemical evolution models. We observed the ground-state $J=1$$-$0 lines of H$^{35}$Cl and H$^{37}$Cl toward 28 high-mass star-forming regions with SEPIA660 on APEX, more than doubling the number of known HCl detections and revealing with XCLASS models emission from both cores and outflows. H$^{35}$Cl was detected in all sources, H$^{37}$Cl in all but two, with spectral line profiles ranging from those with only emission to complex emission-absorption mixtures. We find column densities of the order of $10^{13}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ for H$^{35}$Cl and isotopic ratios between $1.6$ and $3.5$ in emission-only sources. The derived [H$^{35}$Cl]/[H$^{37}$Cl] aligns with Galactic chemical evolution models and shows no trend with Galactocentric radius. However, local variations may reflect recent nucleosynthesis. Overall, the results suggest that most Galactic chlorine was synthesized during epochs of lower average metallicity in the Galaxy. Notably, we detect H$^{35}$Cl emission arising from outflows - particularly explosive ones - hinting at its presence in a broader range of environments. The present single-dish observations cannot reveal the origin of HCl in outflows; necessitating interferometric follow-up observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Cold, dense streams of gas are predicted to penetrate deeply into massive halos (> 10^12 Msun) at cosmic noon (z=4-2), fueling galaxies to sustain high star formation rates. We investigate the prevalence of such cold streams in IllustrisTNG-50 over the range z=4-0, using a novel algorithm to automatically detect cold streams in simulated halos. We qualitatively and quantitatively characterize the geometric and physical properties of the detected streams over cosmic time. We find that cold streams are ubiquitous in massive halos at cosmic noon, occurring in more than 80 percent of such systems down to z=1, before becoming rare by z=0. At their peak prevalence (z=2-1), streams are often found in roughly co-planar, three-stream configurations. These streams generally exhibit a dense and cool core, surrounded by a diffuse and warmer envelope. However, we find that in IllustrisTNG-50, these streams typically disrupt in the outer halo and do not penetrate efficiently to the central galaxy, with the total mass inflow from streams peaking at z=2. Our results underscore the importance of cold streams in fueling galaxies at early times, but they highlight the need for higher-resolution simulations to fully capture their survival and impact at later epochs. Future cosmological zoom-in simulations, with better resolution in the CGM, will be essential to resolve turbulent mixing layers and feedback-inflow interactions that determine whether cold streams can reach the galactic disk.

 - **Abstract**
 During a tidal disruption event (TDE) the stream debris inherits the magnetic field of the star. As the stream stretches, the magnetic field evolves and can eventually become dynamically important. We study this effect by means of magnetohydrodynamic simulations and a semi-analytic model of the disruption of a main-sequence star by a supermassive black hole. For stellar magnetic fields stronger than $\sim 10^4\,\rm{G}$, magnetic pressure becomes important in a significant fraction of the mass of the stream, leading to a fast increase in its thickness, an effect that may impact its subsequent evolution. We find that this dynamical effect is associated with a phase of transverse equilibrium between magnetic and tidal forces, which causes the stream width to increase with distance to the black hole as $H \propto R^{5/4}$. In the unbound tail, this fast expansion could enhance the radio emission produced by the interaction with the ambient medium, while in the returning stream, it may qualitatively affect the subsequent gas evolution, particularly the gas dynamics and radiative properties of shocks occurring after the stream's return to pericentre. By characterizing the magnetohydrodynamic properties of the stream from disruption to the first return to pericentre, this work provides physically motivated initial conditions for future studies of the later phases of TDEs, accounting for magnetic fields. This will ultimately shed light on the role of magnetic fields in enabling angular momentum transport in the ensuing accretion disk, thereby affecting observable signatures such as X-ray radiation and relativistic outflows.

 - **Abstract**
 We use the DAWN JWST Archive to construct and characterise a sample of 116 little red dots (LRDs) across 2.3<z<9.3, selecting all sources with v-shaped UV-optical continua from NIRSpec/PRISM spectra and compact morphologies in NIRCam/F444W imaging. We show that LRD continuum spectra are ubiquitously well described by modified blackbodies across ~$0.4-1.0\mu$m, with typical T~5000K or $\lambda_{peak}$~$0.65\mu$m across 2 dex in luminosity, and a tail toward T~2000K. LRDs therefore trace a locus in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram that is directly analogous to stars on the Hayashi track, strongly supporting the picture that LRDs are AGN embedded in thermalised dense gas envelopes in approximate hydrostatic equilibrium. Hotter LRDs with $\lambda_{peak}<0.65\mu$m typically have strong Balmer breaks, redder UV slopes and high optical luminosities; other LRDs show weak or no Balmer breaks, and wide variety in $\beta_{UV}$ and $L_{5100}$. Crucially, we demonstrate that the UV-optical continuum shapes and luminosities are strongly linked to the $H\alpha,\ H\beta$, [OIII] and OI line properties. There is a tight linear relation between the H$\alpha$ and optical continuum luminosities, as well as H$\alpha$ and OI$_{8446}$, indicating that Balmer, OI and optical emission must primarily be powered by the same source. The Balmer decrement increases strongly toward higher $L_{H\alpha}$, $L_{5100}$ and Balmer break strength, providing key evidence for luminosity-dependent effects of collisional (de-)excitation and resonant scattering in the gaseous envelopes. In contrast, we show that [OIII] emission likely originates from star-forming host galaxies, and that its strong correlation with Balmer break strength arises naturally from variation in the AGN-to-host ratio. Our work presents an empirical description of the nature and structure of LRDs, defining a new benchmark for ongoing LRD model developments.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the value-added catalogue JOLINES (J-PAS optical line intensities for nebular emission galaxies), which provides emission-line fluxes in galaxies at from the spectrophotometric catalogues of miniJPAS, J-NEP and the J-PAS early data release (EDR). This catalogue will be updated with future data releases, offering a growing resource for the study of emission-line galaxies. To obtain reliable emission-line fluxes from narrow-band photometry, we employed spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting using CIGALE, a robust tool that reconstructs the continuum emission and ensures accurate flux measurements. This method effectively mitigates uncertainties associated with direct continuum subtraction techniques, and systematics such as absorption components in the emission lines. We validate our approach using simulated observations of galaxy spectra with added noise, testing the method's performance across different equivalent width (EW) regimes and emission-line strengths. Additionally, we compare the recovered emission-line fluxes with spectroscopic measurements from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Our results show a tight correlation between photometric and spectroscopic fluxes, particularly for bright emission lines, with a typical dispersion of $\sim$0.3 dex. Reliable fluxes are obtained for emission lines with EW $\gtrsim20\, \rm{\mathring{A}}$, in agreement with previous empirical studies. The current catalogue comprises approximately 13,900 sources with reliable flux measurements in the H$\alpha$+[NII] complex and 7,200 in [OIII]$\lambda 5007$, ensuring statistically robust samples for the brightest optical emission lines. This resource will be expanded in future J-PAS releases, facilitating large-scale studies of star formation, AGN activity, and galaxy evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a suite of zoom-in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of dwarf galaxies using the LYRA galaxy formation model with an extremely high mass resolution of $4\, \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$, evolved to $z=0$. The suite contains 65 haloes selected from Local Group like environments, spanning $M_{\mathrm{200c}}=10^7$ to $5\times10^9\, \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$. The sample includes small ultra-faints with $M_\ast\sim100\, \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ through to classical dwarfs with $M_\ast \sim 5\times10^6 \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$, as well as haloes that remain dark to the present day. We explore two prescriptions for the high-redshift ($z>7$) Lyman-Werner background (LWB), differing in intensity and redshift evolution. Star formation begins early ($z\gtrsim8$) in progenitors with $M_{\mathrm{200c}}\sim10^5$-$10^6 \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$, where molecular hydrogen enables warm moderate-density gas to efficiently cool. The LWB strongly influences the $z=0$ halo occupation fraction, shifting the dark-to-luminous transition from $M_{\mathrm{200c}}\sim10^7 \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ (weaker LWB) to $M_{\mathrm{200c}}\sim10^8 \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ (stronger LWB). Galaxies with $M_\ast\gtrsim10^5 \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ are mostly insensitive to the LWB choice, whereas lower mass systems respond strongly, producing markedly different stellar mass-halo mass (SMHM) relations. The weaker LWB yields a very shallow SMHM slope with nearly constant scatter, while the stronger LWB introduces a pronounced break at $M_{\mathrm{200c}}\sim10^9 \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$, where haloes of similar mass host galaxies with $M_\ast\sim10^3$ to $10^5 \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ or remain dark. Both models produce a minimum stellar mass floor at $M_\ast\sim10^3 \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$, originating from galaxies that undergo a single burst of star formation at high redshift before self-quenching from their first supernovae.

 - **Abstract**
 The recent detections of radio emission from the nearby exoplanet host, YZ Ceti, suggest that the star is possibly interacting with its rocky innermost planet. These radio emissions are characterized by strong circular polarization, and appear to repeat within consistent orbital phase windows dictated by the orbital position of YZ Ceti b. If confirmed, this interaction would provide a first means to concretely assess the magnetic field of a close-in rocky exoplanet. This kind of magnetic star-planet interaction (SPI) should depend on both the exoplanetary orbit, and the geometry of the stellar magnetic field. In this article, we report measurements of the large-scale magnetic field topology of the star YZ Ceti for the first time, and interpret the cumulative radio data sets in that context to evaluate the plausibility of magnetic SPIs. We find evidence both against and in support of the SPI hypothesis, but crucially that the measured magnetic field does not rule out SPI scenarios. However, clear evaluation of these possibilities requires more accurate assessments of the magnetic field evolution across time. We additionally suggest that YZ Ceti may be exhibiting planet-induced flaring potentially triggered by exoplanet crossings of the Alfvén surface as the planet orbit approaches the stellar magnetic equator, and YZ Ceti b experiences dramatic shifts in the ambient field, its polarity, and connectivity to the host star.
#### Intrinsic galaxy alignments in CAMELS simulations and the significant impact of baryon model

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21881

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detection of the intrinsic galaxy alignments in the CAMELS suite of hydrodynamic simulations. We find that the alignment amplitude depends significantly on cosmological and supernova feedback parameters - specifically $\Omega_m$, $\sigma_8$, $A_{\text{SN1}}$, $A_{\text{SN2}}$- while no dependence on AGN feedback is observed (due to the limited simulation volume $(25\,h^{-1}\,\text{Mpc})^3$). The dependence on $\sigma_8$ vanishes when projected correlation functions $w_{m+}$ are normalized by matter density correlations $w_{mm}$, consistent with predictions from linear alignment models. We find alignment amplitudes in quiescent galaxies to exceed those in star-forming galaxies by an order of magnitude. Moreover, examining orientation-only correlation functions from ellipticity-normalized galaxies $\tilde w_{m+}$, we confirm that alignment signals retain sensitivity to supernova feedback across full, star forming, quiescent, and ellipticity-normalized samples. Finally, we find evidence that supernova feedback impacts alignment signals differently in star-forming versus quiescent populations, suggesting that distinct alignment mechanisms operate across galaxy types. Our results offer key insights for understanding galaxy formation and alignment models for future weak gravitational lensing analyses.

 - **Abstract**
 Self-consistently modeling baryonic effects in survey-scale cosmological simulations has become increasingly important as the diversity, precision, and statistical reach of modern observations continue to improve. The advent of exascale computing now enables a new generation of simulations that couple these physical processes across full-sky volumes with excellent statistical sampling of large-scale structure tracers such as galaxies, groups, and clusters. To support these efforts, we extend the CRK-HACC framework, a GPU-accelerated cosmological hydrodynamics code, with a suite of astrophysical subgrid models that simulate radiative cooling, star formation, stellar evolution, and AGN feedback within a numerically robust formulation optimized for scalability on modern exascale architectures. The models were selected and calibrated to reproduce observed galaxy stellar mass functions over the redshift range $0 < z < 2$ and cluster populations probed by cosmological surveys, capturing the large-scale baryonic evolution relevant for multi-wavelength, cross-correlated analyses. We describe the implementation and calibration of these models and demonstrate their consistency with observed galaxy population statistics and modern hydrodynamic simulations, establishing the baseline for exascale efforts that extend this framework to survey-scale volumes.

 - **Abstract**
 The WISE and NEOWISE missions have provided the only mid-infrared all-sky time-domain data, opening a unique observational window for variability studies. Yet, a comprehensive and systematic catalog of mid-infrared variable sources has remained unavailable. In this work, we construct the first large-scale mid-infrared variability catalog based on the unTimely coadded photometry, covering tens of millions of sources. By employing a Bayesian Gaussian mixture model with a Dirichlet process, we identified 8,256,042 variable sources in the W1 band and 7,147,661 in the W2 band, significantly expanding the landscape of known mid-infrared variables. In addition to robust variability metrics, our analysis highlights rare and extreme outliers through dedicated outlier-detection algorithms, enabling the discovery of unusual classes of objects such as eruptive young stellar objects, highly variable active galactic nuclei, and other rare transients. This unprecedented dataset provides a new foundation for time-domain astronomy in the mid-infrared, offering complementary insights to optical and near-infrared surveys, and opening the door to systematic investigations of stellar evolution, accretion processes, and dust-enshrouded astrophysical environments on a Galactic and extragalactic scale.

 - **Abstract**
 Nonthermal emission observed in galaxy clusters provides a direct probe into the plasma physics of the intra-cluster medium (ICM) under extreme conditions. We report the first detailed analysis of the giant radio halo in the merging galaxy cluster Abell 2163, using upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) and Very Large Array (VLA) observations. Combining radio data (300-1400 MHz) with archival X-ray data offers a unique opportunity to study the complex ICM physics of the cluster. The sensitive uGMRT observations map the halo emission for the first time out to an extent of ~3.3 Mpc, up to $r_{500}$, and also effectively recover other diffuse sources. The radio surface brightness profile is well fitted with an exponential function up to r$_{500}$, with an evolution of e-folding radius over frequencies (larger at low frequencies). The spatially resolved spectral index map reveals fluctuations and outward radial steepening of the average spectral index. Radio and X-ray surface brightness are well correlated, with a correlation slope of $\sim$0.70 for the halo, and $\sim$0.40 for the ridge. The correlation slope varies from cluster centre to outskirts, suggesting the magnetic field and thermal gas density scaling relation (B $\propto n_{e}^{0.5}$) should be reassessed, provided that the re-acceleration efficiency is constant. We propose that diffuse lobes at the periphery could serve as a reservoir for seed electrons, behind the radio halo emission, with an estimated acceleration efficiency reaching $\sim$0.1% in the external regions. Additionally, a major E-W merger is suggested, leading to turbulence in the ICM and generating the halo.
#### Constraining the Properties of GRB Accreting Magnetar with $R/I$ Evolutionary Effects Using \emph{Swift}/XRT Data

 - **Abstract**
 A newly born millisecond magnetar has been proposed as one possible central engine of some long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) with X-ray plateau. In this work, we used a universal correlation between initial spin period ($P_0$) and surface magnetic field ($B_p$) of newborn magnetar based on an LGRB sample in \cite{Lan2025} to explore the propeller properties of accreting magnetar with $R/I$ evolutionary effects. We found that $B_p-P_0$ relation is approximately consistent with $B_p\propto P_{\rm eq}^{7/6}$. Here, $P_{\rm eq}$ is equilibrium spin period in magnetic propeller model. The $B_p-P_0$ relation indicates that $P_0$ may not be true initial spin period of newborn magnetar, but had reached an equilibrium spin period via fallback accretion in propeller model. The magnetar accretion rate in our LGRBs is in range of $\dot{M}\sim10^{-5}-10^{-2} M_{\odot} \rm s^{-1}$ by incorporating $R/I$ evolutionary effects, and using the transition relation between gravitational mass $M_g$ and baryonic mass $M_b$ in different equation of states. Such accretion rates ensure that the accreting magnetars in our sample survive until reaching the equilibrium spin period, and the accretion rate is one order of magnitude lower compared to the statistical results in \cite{Stratta2018} and \cite{Linweili2020}, which used constant $R/I/M_g$ scenario. We suggested that adopting a constant $R/I/M_g$ scenario for modeling propeller regime in accreting magnetar results in a higher mass accretion rate, which may impair our understanding of the physical nature and its surroundings of accreting magnetar, and low-metallicity progenitors can provide enough material to satisfy the accretion requirements of newborn accreting magnetar in LGRBs.

 - **Abstract**
 The mechanical feedback from the central AGNs can be crucial for balancing the radiative cooling of the intracluster medium at the cluster centre. We aim to understand the relationship between the power of AGN feedback and the cooling of gas in the centres of galaxy clusters by correlating the radio properties of the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) with the X-ray properties of their host clusters. We used catalogues from the first SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey (eRASS1) along with ASKAP radio data. In total, we identified 134 radio sources associated with BCGs of the 151 eRASS1 clusters located in the PS1, PS2, and SWAG-X ASKAP fields. Non-detections were treated as upper limits. We correlated BCG radio luminosity, largest linear size (LLS), and BCG offset with the integrated X-ray luminosity of their host clusters. To characterise cool cores (CCs) and non-cool cores (NCCs), we used the concentration parameter $c_{R_{500}}$ and combined it with the BCG offset to assess cluster dynamical state. We analysed the correlation between radio mechanical power and X-ray luminosity within the CC subsample. We observe a potential positive trend between LLS and BCG offset, suggesting an environmental effect on radio-source morphology. We find a weak trend where more luminous central radio galaxies are found in clusters with higher X-ray luminosity. Within the CC subsample, there is a positive but highly scattered relationship between the mechanical luminosity of AGN jets and the X-ray cooling luminosity. This finding is supported by bootstrap resampling and flux-flux analyses. The correlation indicates that AGN feedback is ineffective in high-luminosity (high-mass) clusters. At a cooling luminosity of $L_{\mathrm{X},~r<R_\mathrm{cool}}\approx 5.50\times10^{43}$ erg/s, on average, AGN feedback appears to contribute only about 13%-22% of the energy needed to offset the radiative losses in the ICM.

 - **Abstract**
 The regions in which stellar winds interact with the interstellar medium, also known as astrospheres, can be observed in detail through the thermal emission of the interstellar dust particles, resided in plasma. Interstellar dust is also directly observed in the vicinity of the Sun with dust detectors onboard spacecraft, and it is known to be affected by the interplanetary magnetic field. The main goal of this work is to show how the change in the interplanetary magnetic field with the solar cycle affects the infrared picture of the heliosphere. To compose a synthetic intensity map of the interstellar dust thermal emission, we used the Monte Carlo method to calculate the distribution of the dust particles inside the heliosphere. We considered the effects of the heliosphere boundaries and the non-stationary current sheet. The change in the Parker magnetic field caused by the solar activity cycle leads distinguishable features in the mid-infrared emission maps of the heliosphere. The distribution of the interstellar dust in the vicinity of the Sun we calculated suggests that small particles linger outside of the heliosphere, and medium-size particles are mostly affected by the changing interplanetary magnetic field, which leads to number density waves in the tail region of the heliosphere. Finally, large particles form a bulge behind the Sun.

 - **Abstract**
 The Solar Close Observations and Proximity Experiments (SCOPE) mission will send a spacecraft into the solar atmosphere at a low altitude of just 5 R_sun from the solar center. It aims to elucidate the mechanisms behind solar eruptions and coronal heating, and to directly measure the coronal magnetic field. The mission will perform in situ measurements of the current sheet between coronal mass ejections and their associated solar flares, and energetic particles produced by either reconnection or fast-mode shocks driven by coronal mass ejections. This will help to resolve the nature of reconnections in current sheets, and energetic particle acceleration regions. To investigate coronal heating, the mission will observe nano-flares on scales smaller than 70 km in the solar corona and regions smaller than 40 km in the photosphere, where magnetohydrodynamic waves originate. To study solar wind acceleration mechanisms, the mission will also track the process of ion charge-state freezing in the solar wind. A key achievement will be the observation of the coronal magnetic field at unprecedented proximity to the solar photosphere. The polar regions will also be observed at close range, and the inner edge of the solar system dust disk may be identified for the first time. This work presents the detailed background, science, and mission concept of SCOPE and discusses how we aim to address the questions mentioned above.

 - **Abstract**
 After six years of studies following the discovery of GSN069, a link is starting to appear between the elusive Quasi-Periodic Eruptions (QPEs) and other types of nuclear transients, among which are Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs). As such, observing strategies are adapting, with a current trend focusing on late-time X-ray follow-ups of (optical) TDEs. While these campaigns are so far proving quite successful, the inherent confirmation bias they introduce in our sample could lead the community to hasty, and perhaps erroneous, conclusions. It is thus important to still pursue the search for nuclear transients in other, more agnostic directions. In this work, we focus on the observational aspects of our field, and lay out two different methods that can be deployed in order to reveal new QPE sources. These complementary methods enable the detection of long-term ($\sim$years) and short term ($\sim$minutes) transient events, that would have otherwise been missed by the standard detection pipelines. Both of these methods can be used either for data mining in the 25 years worth of XMM-Newton archive, or to trigger real-time follow-ups upon a more recent discovery.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze a sample of\textit{ Swift} gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with extended emissions in $\gamma$-rays and/or X-ray plateaus that may be driven by magnetars. Multi-wavelength data and multi-standards have been adopted to investigate the issue jointly. First, we find that GRBs with both extended emission and X-ray plateau satisfy a three-parameter relation between the luminosity and the end time of X-ray plateaus and the $\gamma$-ray isotropic energy as $L_X\varpropto T_a^{-1.13}E_{\gamma,iso}^{0.74}$, which is consistent with that of normal GRBs. Second, we distinguish these GRBs in the plane of magnetic field versus period of neutron star and find that almost all GRBs but GRB 211024B have reasonable periods and majority of them could be powered by magnetars. Third, we standardize the X-ray afterglows with distinct characteristics and find that the standard X-ray light curves with/without plateaus are significantly different. The standardized X-ray plateaus are similar to the mean temporal profile of magnetars. Fourth, it is verified with a K-S test that all types of GRBs except short ones have the similar distributions of redshift and isotropic energy in the observer/rest frame. GRBs with internal plateaus are significantly different from those of normal long GRBs and GRBs with external plateaus and/or extended emissions. Interestingly, the isotropic energy distributions of GRBs with internal and external plateaus are identical with those of short and long GRBs, respectively. Overall, our study can bring solid evidence that the fascinating magnetars could have multi-formation channels to account for not only short but also long GRBs with either internal or external X-ray plateaus as well.

 - **Abstract**
 Sulfur-bearing molecules are central to interstellar chemistry, yet their observed abundances in the gas phase remain far below cosmic expectations in dense interstellar regions. Mixed N-S-O species such as thionylimide (HNSO) are particularly relevant, as they incorporate three key biogenic elements. The $cis$ conformer of HNSO has recently been detected in the Galactic Center cloud G+0.693-0.027, but no high-resolution data for the higher energy conformer ($trans$-HNSO) had been available until now. We report the first laboratory detection and rotational spectroscopic characterization of $trans$-HNSO. Spectra were recorded with the Center for Astrochemical Studies Absorption Cell (CASAC) free-space spectrometer employing a hollow-cathode discharge source, yielding 104 assigned transitions between 200 and 530 GHz. A Watson S-reduced Hamiltonian fit reproduced the data with an rms of 40 kHz, providing accurate rotational and centrifugal distortion constants in excellent agreement with CCSD(T) predictions. Although $trans$-HNSO lies only a few kcal/mol above the $cis$ form, it has larger dipole components, making its lines particularly intense (more than 5 times brighter, assuming equal abundances) and a very promising candidate for future astronomical detection. The new measurements enable reliable frequency predictions for astronomical searches and will be added to public databases. Combined with recent evidence for tunneling-driven $trans$-to-$cis$ isomerization at cryogenic temperatures, these results open the way to test directly whether quantum tunneling governs the interstellar distribution of HNSO isomers.

 Context. The spatial distribution of haloes in the Cosmic Web encodes a wealth of information about the underlying cosmological model. These haloes can be represented as nodes of a graph, whose structural properties reflect cosmological parameters. Aims. Using our new MAKITRA suite of cosmological magneto-hydrodynamical simulations covering a total volume of $(300\,\text{Mpc})^3$ and with 21 physical model variations (including variations of $\sigma_8$ and of different models of primordial magnetic fields, PMFs), we investigate the sensitivity of network-based statistics describing the Cosmic Web to variations in cosmological and PMF scenarios. Methods. We focus on several complementary metrics that characterise the spatial distribution of dark and baryonic matter haloes: two-point correlation functions, network-centrality statistics, and counts-in-cell measurements. We first compare the halo-halo correlation functions across different cosmological models. For the network analysis, we represent haloes as vertices of the Cosmic Web and compute multiple centrality measures, whose cumulative distributions we evaluate for universes with varying PMF strengths. Finally, we quantify halo abundances within randomly placed spheres of fixed radius to assess differences between scenarios. Results. First, we find that the statistics of the centralities of the network can serve as a novel sensitive probe of the cosmological parameter $\sigma_8$. Moreover, we find that this network analysis approach can allow us to distinguish the presence of PMFs with initial strength $\approx\,4 \text{nG}$ from the scenarios with much weaker PMFs.

 - **Abstract**
 The ALMACAL project leverages ALMA maps of calibrator-centered fields to conduct deep mm/sub-mm surveys, enabling the detection of extragalactic sources with flux densities orders of magnitude fainter than achievable with other instruments. These faint sources are critical for refining evolutionary models, as their number counts provide key constraints. In this study, we analyzed band-3 ALMACAL maps from 606 calibrator fields, employing a novel machine learning approach to mitigate the often-overlooked bias introduced by the calibrator itself. Supported by extensive simulations, we extended 100 GHz radio AGN counts by approximately 1.5 orders of magnitude in flux density and refined constraints on dusty star-forming galaxies, reaching sensitivities as low as $\sim$180 $\mu$Jy. We have improved the sampling, compared to previous results, in the region of the dominant population transition (between dusty star-forming galaxies and radio AGN). Our results are in good agreement with model predictions.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the superfluid vortex motion in the neutron star inner crust through direct three-dimensional simulations of the coupled dynamics of the vortex and the nuclear lattice. We demonstrate the pinning of an initially moving vortex to the lattice through excitation of lattice vibrations, and show that the efficiency of this process is higher for attractive than for repulsive nucleus-vortex interactions. We explore the unpinning of a vortex under the action of the applied Magnus force, and find that it is influenced by multiple parameters, including the sign of the pinning force, the lattice orientation, composition, temperature, and the energy of pinning to individual nucleus. In lattices with multiple grains, the unpinning transition is triggered inside the grains with weaker pinning, propagates along the vortex (mediated by the excited Kelvin waves) and crosses into grains with stronger pinning. This is likely to effectively decrease the critical force at which vortices unpin and to produce extended regions of unpinned vorticity. Shearing of the crust lattice (e.g., by a starquake) initiates the unpinning of the vortices that are crossing the slip plane. A close encounter of an unpinned vortex with a pinned vortex would cause the latter to unpin, perhaps initiating an unpinning avalanche of many vortices.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. In addition to the supermassive black hole Sgr A*, the inner parsec of our Galactic center is home to numerous fruitful scientific habitats. One of these environments is the S cluster, which consists of two distinct populations: the main-sequence S stars and the dusty G objects. While the majority of the brightest S stars can be classified as young B stars, the G sources can be described as dusty objects whose nature is still under debate. Aims. In this work, we focus on the most prominent G objects in the S cluster and follow their Keplerian trajectory around Sgr A*. With this, we test the predictions based on almost two decades of monitoring of the direct vicinity of our central supermassive black hole using NACO and SINFONI, formerly mounted at the Very Large Telescope (VLT). The goal is to increase the existing data baseline for G2/DSO, D9, and X7 to get insights into their evolution on their Keplerian trajectories. In addition, we revisit the massive Young Stellar Object (YSO) X3 and scrutinize the potential impact of its environment on this highly dynamic source. Methods. The successor to the two instruments is called ERIS and offers upgraded optics and improved properties, including an enhanced spectral resolution. We utilize the IFU mode of ERIS, called SPIFFIER. We search for the Doppler-shifted Br{\gamma} emission line to rediscover peculiar objects in the S cluster using SPIFFIER with the highest available spatial plate scale of 12.5 mas. Furthermore, we will derive the Br{\gamma} luminosity of G2/DSO to inspect the degree of its change more than ten years after the pericenter passage. If present, a decrease in the Br{\gamma} luminosity of G2/DSO on its descending part of the orbit would directly impact the direction of the debate about its nature.

 - **Abstract**
 We characterize the sensitivity of a double point-spread function (PSF) fitting algorithm -- employing empirical, position-dependent PSF models -- for detecting companions using the infrared channel of the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3/IR) on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The observed separation distribution of known brown dwarf (BD) binaries is potentially biased towards separations larger than the angular resolution limits of current techniques. Previous imaging analyses suffer from incompleteness at separations $<2\lambda/D$; our aim is to probe within this limit to identify previously missed companions. We evaluate the performance of our technique on artificial data across 8 WFC3/IR filters and a broad range of signal-to-noise ratios (S/N), determining our ability to accurately recover injected companions and identifying the region of parameter space where false positive fits are likely. Here, we demonstrate the capability of this technique to recover companions at sub-pixel separations on the WFC3/IR detector -- below the diffraction limit in multiple filters. For F160W at a typical S/N of 75, we resolve companions separated by 0.8 pixels (104 mas, $0.759\lambda/D$) at 1.5 magnitudes contrast with $>90\%$ confidence. We achieve the closest angular resolution for any detection method with WFC3/IR imaging to date. Compared to previous BD multiplicity surveys with WFC3/IR, we achieve a 2.5$\times$ improvement in separation sensitivity at contrasts of 0-3 magnitudes in F127M. We have demonstrated that applying our improved technique to archival HST images of field BDs will thus probe down to separations of 1 au, in one of the largest high angular resolution surveys of such objects to date.

 - **Abstract**
 Stable domain wall (DW) must decay to avoid overclose the Universe. A commonly used solution is to slightly break the PQ symmetry by introducing a bias term in the potential. In this work, we propose an alternative, symmetry-preserving mechanism: coupling the axion field to a helical primordial magnetic field (PMF) via the Chern-Simons term. Using three-dimensional lattice simulations, we evolve the DW network and demonstrate that it can successfully drive DW decay. Our quantitative results further show that the correlation length of the PMF plays a crucial role in determining the decay rate of the DW network and the resulting axion and gravitational wave radiation.

 - **Abstract**
 Bayesian inference, widely used in gravitational-wave parameter estimation, depends on the choice of priors, i.e., on our previously existing knowledge. However, to investigate neutron star mergers, priors are often chosen in an agnostic way, leaving valuable information from nuclear physics and independent observations of neutron stars unused. In this work, we propose to encode information on neutron star physics into data-driven prior distributions constructed with normalizing flows, referred to as neural priors. These priors take input from constraints on the nuclear equation of state and neutron star population models. Applied to GW170817, GW190425, and GW230529, we highlight two contributions of the framework. First, we demonstrate its ability to provide source classification and to enable model selection of equation of state constraints for loud signals such as GW170817, directly from the gravitational-wave data. Second, we obtain narrower constraints on the source properties through these informed priors. As a result, the neural priors consistently recover higher luminosity distances compared to agnostic priors. Our method paves the way for classifying future ambiguous low-mass mergers observed through gravitational waves and for continuously incorporating advances in our understanding of neutron star properties into gravitational-wave data analysis.

 - **Abstract**
 Bulk meteoritic data show isotopic variability of $slow$-neutron-capture ($s$-process) origin in a several elements heavier than Fe. One peculiar feature is that the lighter $s$-process elements (e.g., Zr and Mo) present larger anomalies than the heavier $s$-process elements (e.g., Nd and W). To address this observation, we compared Zr and Nd data to model predictions of the s-process abundances at the surface of low-mass asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars of initial metallicity from solar to twice solar. We found that the relative magnitude of the isotopic variability between these two elements can be matched by models of AGB stars of super-solar metallicity. The match is favoured by stronger convective overshoot, leading to a deeper dredge-up of the H-rich envelope into the He-rich region, and/or a smaller (~ half than standard) mass of the region rich in the $^{13}$C nuclei that produce free neutrons via the $^{13}$C($\alpha$,n)$^{16}$O reaction. We conclude that nucleosynthesis in AGB stars can match the difference in the magnitude of the bulk meteoritic variations in Zr and Nd, provided that super-solar metallicity stars are the original site of these signatures. The AGB stars that produced such variations could have belonged to the current population of old, super-solar metallicity stars seen in the galactic solar neighbourhood.

 - **Abstract**
 Large-amplitude variations are commonly observed in the atmospheres of directly imaged exoplanets and brown dwarfs. VHS 1256B, the most variable known planet-mass object, exhibits a near-infrared flux change of nearly 40%, with red color and silicate features revealed in recent JWST spectra, challenging current theories. Using a general circulation model, we demonstrate that VHS 1256B's atmosphere is dominated by planetary-scale dust storms persisting for tens of days, with large patchy clouds propagating with equatorial waves. This weather pattern, distinct from the banded structures seen on solar system giants, simultaneously explains the observed spectra and critical features in the rotational light curves, including the large amplitude, irregular evolution, and wavelength dependence, as well as the variability trends observed in near-infrared color-magnitude diagrams of dusty substellar atmospheres.

 - **Abstract**
 Feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) is believed to play a significant role in suppressing cooling flows in cool-core (CC) clusters. Turbulence in the intracluster medium (ICM), which may be induced by AGN activity or pre-existing motions, has been proposed as a potential heating mechanism based on analysis of Chandra X-ray surface brightness fluctuations. However, subsequent simulation results have found the subdominant role of turbulence in heating the ICM. To investigate this discrepancy, we perform three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of a Perseus-like cluster including both AGN feedback and pre-existing turbulence, which is stirred to the observationally constrained level in the Perseus cluster. Our results indicate that, although the velocity field is dominated by the pre-existing turbulence, AGN heating through bubbles and shocks remains significant. More importantly, analysis of the velocity structure function and the energy power spectrum shows that the turbulent heating rate is smaller than the radiative cooling rate, especially in the cluster core. Our results offer insights relevant for recent XRISM observations and indicate that turbulent heating alone cannot offset radiative cooling in CC clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 There is a group of post-AGB stars that are part of a binary system and that show a significant NIR excess. These systems are known to host disks with Keplerian or quasi-Keplerian dynamics and to drive outflows of gas escaping from the rotating disk. These binary post-AGB stars can be categorized into two subclasses depending on the predominance of specific kinematic components: disk-dominated and outflow-dominated sources. We present the survey of such sources observed in CO using the IRAM-30m telescope, in which we aim to identify the molecular gas in these circumbinary-disk-containing post-AGB nebulae. We aim to analyze the mass distribution of the disk objects studied in CO. We present high-sensitivity mm-wave observations of the CO line emission from ten binary post-AGB stars. Using the derived formulation and observational data, we calculated the mass of the total gas in the CO-emitting regions of these nebulae. The logarithmic distribution of nebular masses was analyzed using a normal model that incorporates censored data, enabling a more comprehensive analysis and yielding more accurate and representative results. CO emission is detected in six post-AGB nebulae from our sample. We have significantly increased the sample of observed sources in CO lines. Some of these objects exhibit very weak molecular emission. Within the sample of disk-containing sources, the total gas mass spans a range of 1E-4 to 1E-1 Mo. The results derived from this work, along with those from a previous CO single-dish survey and interferometric data, show that this class of binary post-AGB stars exhibits a large range of nebular masses (including both the rotating disk and the expanding component), with variations exceeding a factor of 600. The typical nebular mass of these objects, accounting for both detections and non-detections through censored data analysis, is approximately 2E-3 Mo.

Utilizing the information from optical surveys, we further divide them into isolated and accompanied subsamples by their vicinity of nearby massive galaxies. We compare the Hi gas abundance and star-forming rate (SFR) between the subsamples to assess the role of internal and external processes that may regulate the gas content in dwarf galaxies. As a result, we find that AGN are more commonly identified in accompanied dwarf galaxies than in their isolated counterparts. Meanwhile, AGN-hosting dwarf galaxies have slightly but significant lower Hi mass fraction relatively to the non-AGN control sample in accompanied dwarf galaxies. On the other hand, we find a decreasing SFR in AGN-hosting dwarf galaxies towards denser environments, as well as an extremely low incidence of quenched isolated dwarfs within both AGN and non-AGN subsamples. These results indicate that although these AGN could potentially regulate the gas reservoir of dwarf galaxies, environmental effects are likely the dominant quenching mechanism in the low-mass universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), among the most compelling astrophysical phenomena, are potential candidates for exploring the evolution of energy distribution among magnetic fields and particles through multiwavelength observations. The fraction of energy transferred between particles and the magnetic field is governed by microphysical parameters, typically assumed to be constant during relativistic shocks but may in fact vary with time. In this work, we derive the light curves and closure relations (CRs) of the synchrotron-self Compton (SSC) process from the external reverse shock (RS) with variations of microphysical parameters in a homogeneous and stellar-wind medium. We consider the evolution of the RS in the thick- and thin-shell regimes. We demonstrate that, depending on the microphysical parameters, this process can mimic plateau phases and produce temporal decay indices steeper than those predicted by high-latitude emission alone. The current model is employed to examine the evolution of the spectral and temporal indices of GRBs reported in the Second Fermi-LAT Gamma-ray Burst Catalog (2FLGC) and bursts detected at very high energies, using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 The metallicity structure of stellar halos encodes the fossil record of galaxy assembly, tracing the chemical evolution and dynamical imprint of past mergers. Using five Milky Way-mass halos from the Aquarius simulations, we introduce an information-theoretic framework to quantify spatial-chemical correlations through the mutual information (MI) between angular position and metallicity. We divide stars in each halo into high- and low-metallicity populations based on their median metallicity and examine their metallicity distribution functions (MDFs), spatial anisotropies, and angular-metallicity couplings as a function of galactocentric radius. The MDFs exhibit remarkable diversity, ranging from single-peaked distributions dominated by one or two massive progenitors to broad or bimodal forms shaped by multiple accretion events, revealing the stochastic nature of halo assembly. The low-metallicity stars, primarily contributed by disrupted satellites, display higher spatial anisotropy and stronger angular clustering than their metal-rich counterparts. After removing bound satellites, anisotropy decreases significantly, yet high-metallicity stars remain marginally more anisotropic, reflecting the lingering debris of massive, centrally deposited progenitors. The mutual information between angular position and metallicity increases with radius before saturating in the outskirts, with the difference between the data and randomized controls confined mainly to the inner halo signifying residual spatial-chemical coupling driven by incomplete phase mixing. Our results demonstrate that information-theoretic diagnostics provide a powerful and intuitive way to quantify the chemical complexity of stellar halos and offer a promising route to compare simulations with forthcoming high-dimensional Galactic survey data.
