#### easyCHEM: A Python package for calculating chemical equilibrium abundances in exoplanet atmospheres

 - **Abstract**
 For modeling the spectra of exoplanets one must know their atmospheric composition. This is necessary because the abundance of molecules, atoms, ions and condensates is needed to construct the total cross-section for the interaction between electro-magnetic radiation and matter. In addition, when solving for the temperature structure of an atmosphere the so-called adiabatic temperature gradient must be known, which describes the pressure-temperature dependence in convectively unstable regions well. Depending on the planetary properties, the composition and adiabatic gradients may be well described by equilibrium chemistry, which means that chemical reactions occur faster than any other relevant processes in the atmosphere, such as mixing. What is more, the equilibrium assumption often serves as a useful starting point for non-equilibrium calculations. Efficient and easy-to-use codes for determining equilibrium abundances are therefore needed. Here we report on our easyCHEM Python package that calculates atmospheric compositions and adiabatic temperature gradients in chemical equilibrium for any user-specified elemental composition.

 - **Abstract**
 Active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback from supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the centers of galaxy clusters plays a key role in regulating star formation and shaping the intracluster medium (ICM), often manifesting through prominent X-ray cavities embedded in the cluster's hot atmosphere. Here we show that X-ray cavities arise naturally due to AGN feedback in TNG-Cluster. This is a new suite of magnetohydrodynamic cosmological simulations of galaxy formation and evolution, and hence of galaxy clusters, whereby cold dark matter, baryon dynamics, galactic astrophysics, and magnetic fields are evolved together consistently. We construct mock Chandra X-ray observations of the central regions of the 352 simulated clusters at $z=0$ and find that $\sim$39 per cent contain X-ray cavities. Identified X-ray cavities vary in configuration (single, pairs, or multiples), with some still attached to SMBHs, while others have buoyantly risen. Their size ranges from a few to several tens of kpc. In terms of gas physical properties, TNG-Cluster X-ray cavities are underdense compared to the surrounding halo and filled with hot gas ($\sim$10$^8$K); 25 per cent of them are surrounded by an X-ray bright and compressed rim associated with a weak shock (Mach number $\sim 1.5$). Clusters exhibiting X-ray cavities are preferentially strong or weak cool-cores, are dynamically relaxed, and host SMBHs accreting at low Eddington rates. We show that TNG-Cluster X-ray cavities originate from episodic, wind-like energy injections from central AGN. Our results illustrate the existence and diversity of X-ray cavities simulated in state-of-the-art models within realistic cosmological environments and show that these can form without necessarily invoking bipolar, collimated, or relativistic jets.

 - **Abstract**
 The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed unexpectedly rapid galaxy assembly in the early universe, in tension with models of star and galaxy formation. In the gas conditions typical of early galaxies, particularly their low abundances of heavy elements (metals) and dust, the star-formation process is poorly understood. Some models predict that stars form in atomic gas at low metallicity, in contrast to forming in molecular gas as observed in higher-metallicity galaxies. To understand the very high star-formation rates at early epochs, it is necessary to determine whether molecular gas formation represents a bottleneck to star formation, or if it is plentiful even at extremely low metallicity. Despite repeated searches, star-forming molecular gas has not yet been observed in any galaxy below 7% of the Solar metallicity, leaving the question of how stars form at lower metallicities unresolved. Here, we report the detection of rotationally excited emission from molecular hydrogen in the star-forming region of the nearby, 3% Solar metallicity galaxy Leo P with the MIRI-MRS instrument onboard JWST. These observations place a lower limit on the molecular gas content of Leo P and, combined with our upper limit on carbon monoxide emission from a deep search of this galaxy, demonstrate that MIRI-MRS is sensitive to much smaller molecular gas masses at extremely low metallicity compared to the traditional observational tracer. This discovery pushes the maximum metallicity at which purely atomic gas may fuel star formation a factor of two lower, providing crucial empirical guidance for models of star formation in the early universe.
#### Model-agnostic basis functions for the 2-point correlation function of dark matter in linear theory

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21374

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.21374

 - **Abstract**
 We consider approximating the linearly evolved 2-point correlation function (2pcf) of dark matter $\xi_{\rm lin}(r;\boldsymbol{\theta})$ in a cosmological model with parameters $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ as the linear combination $\xi_{\rm lin}(r;\boldsymbol{\theta})\approx\sum_i\,b_i(r)\,w_i(\boldsymbol{\theta})$, where the functions $\mathcal{B}=\{b_i(r)\}$ form a $\textit{model-agnostic basis}$ for the linear 2pcf. This decomposition is important for model-agnostic analyses of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) feature in the nonlinear 2pcf of galaxies that fix $\mathcal{B}$ and leave the coefficients $\{w_i\}$ free. To date, such analyses have made simple but sub-optimal choices for $\mathcal{B}$, such as monomials. We develop a machine learning framework for systematically discovering a $\textit{minimal}$ basis $\mathcal{B}$ that describes $\xi_{\rm lin}(r)$ near the BAO feature in a wide class of cosmological models. We use a custom architecture, denoted $\texttt{BiSequential}$, for a neural network (NN) that explicitly realizes the separation between $r$ and $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ above. The optimal NN trained on data in which only $\{\Omega_{\rm m},h\}$ are varied in a $\textit{flat}$ $\Lambda$CDM model produces a basis $\mathcal{B}$ comprising $9$ functions capable of describing $\xi_{\rm lin}(r)$ to $\sim0.6\%$ accuracy in $\textit{curved}$ $w$CDM models varying 7 parameters within $\sim5\%$ of their fiducial, flat $\Lambda$CDM values. Scales such as the peak, linear point and zero-crossing of $\xi_{\rm lin}(r)$ are also recovered with very high accuracy. We compare our approach to other compression schemes in the literature, and speculate that $\mathcal{B}$ may also encompass $\xi_{\rm lin}(r)$ in modified gravity models near our fiducial $\Lambda$CDM model. Using our basis functions in model-agnostic BAO analyses can potentially lead to significant statistical gains.
#### Unveiling the nature of SN 2022jli: the first double-peaked stripped-envelope supernova showing periodic undulations and dust emission at late times

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.21381

 - **Abstract**
 We present optical and IR observations from maximum light until around 600 d of SN 2022jli, a peculiar SE SN showing two maxima, each one with a peak luminosity of about 3 x 10^{42} erg/s and separated by 50 d. The second maximum is followed by periodic undulations with a period of P ~ 12.5 days. The spectra and the photometric evolution of the first maximum are consistent with the behaviour of a standard SE SN with an ejecta mass of 1.5 +/- 0.4 Msun, and a nickel mass of 0.12 +/- 0.01 Msun. The optical spectra after 400 d correspond to a standard SN Ic event, and at late times SN 2022jli exhibits a significant drop in the optical luminosity implying that the physical phenomena that produced the secondary maximum has ceased to power the SN light curve. One possibility is that the second maximum is powered by a magnetar with an initial spin period of P=48.5 ms and a magnetic field of B = 8.5x10^{14} G, while the light curve periodic undulations could be produced by accretion of material from a companion star onto the neutron star in a binary system. The near-IR spectra shows clear 1st CO overtone emission from about 190 d after the first maximum, and it becomes undetected at 400 d. A significant near-IR excess from hot dust emission is detected at 238 d produced by either newly formed dust in the SN ejecta or due to a strong near-IR dust echo. Depending on the assumptions of the dust composition, the estimated dust mass is 2-16 x 10^{-4} Msun. The magnetar power of the second maximum can fit in a more general picture where magnetars are the power source of super-luminous SNe, could produce their frequent bumps and undulations, and where pulsars could produce the late time excess observed in some SE SNe. The detection of CO and the potential detection of dust formed in the ejecta of SN2022jli are important to understand the formation molecules and dust in the ejecta of SE SNe.
#### Estimating Masses of Supermassive Black Holes in Active Galactic Nuclei from the Halpha Emission Line

 - **Abstract**
 The goal of this project is to construct an estimator for the masses of supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) based on the broad Halpha emission line. We make use of published reverberation mapping data. We remeasure all Halpha time lags from the original data as we find that often the reverberation measurements are improved by detrending the light curves. We produce mass estimators that require only the Halpha luminosity and the width of the Halpha emission line as characterized by either the FWHM or the line dispersion. It is possible, on the basis of a single spectrum covering the Halpha emission line, to estimate the mass of the central supermassive black hole in AGNs, taking into account all three parameters believed to affect mass measurement: luminosity, line width, and Eddington ratio. The typical formal accuracy in such estimates is of order 0.2-0.3 dex.

 - **Abstract**
 Melnick 34 (Mk 34) is one of the most massive binary systems known and is one of the brightest X-ray point sources in the 30 Doradus region. We investigated the impact of this massive system on the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM) using the optical spectroscopic capabilities of the narrow-field mode (NFM) of the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE). MUSE-NFM spatially resolved the ISM in the vicinity of Mk 34 with a resolution comparable to that of the HST. The analysis of the [NII]$\lambda$6583 and [SII]$\lambda$6717 emission lines reveals a cone-like structure apparently originating from Mk 34 and extending southeast. Electron density maps and radial velocity measurements of the ISM lines further support an outflow scenario traced by these emissions. While no clear northwestern counterpart to this outflow was observed, we note increased extinction in that direction, towards the R136 cluster. The ISM material along the projected diagonal of the outflow on both sides of Mk 34 shows similar properties in terms of the emission line ratios seen in the Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich diagram. These results are consistent across two observational epochs. Additionally, we examined the residual maps within a 0.5" radius of Mk 34 after modeling and subtracting the point spread function. The observed variations in the residuals could potentially be linked to Mk 34's known periodic behavior. However, further observations with appropriate cadence are needed to fully monitor the 155 day periodicity of Mk 34's X-ray emissions.

 - **Abstract**
 Over the past decade, several millimeter interferometer programs have mapped the nearby star-forming galaxy M51 at a spatial resolution of ${\le}170$ pc. This study combines observations from three major programs: the PdBI Arcsecond Whirlpool Survey (PAWS), the SMA M51 large program (SMA-PAWS), and the Surveying the Whirlpool at Arcseconds with NOEMA (SWAN). The dataset includes the (1-0) and (2-1) rotational transitions of $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, and C$^{18}$O isotopologues. The observations cover the $r{<}\rm 3\,kpc$ region including center and part of the disk, thereby ensuring strong detections of the weaker $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O lines. All observations are convolved in this analysis to an angular resolution of 4$''$, corresponding to a physical scale of ${\sim}$170 pc. We investigate empirical line ratio relations and quantitatively evaluate molecular gas conditions such as temperature, density, and the CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor ($\alpha_{\rm CO}$). We employ two approaches to study the molecular gas conditions: (i) assuming local thermal equilibrium (LTE) to analytically determine the CO column density and $\alpha_{\rm CO}$, and (ii) using non-LTE modeling with RADEX to fit physical conditions to observed CO isotopologue intensities. We find that the $\alpha_{\rm CO}$ values {in the center and along the inner spiral arm} are $\sim$0.5 dex (LTE) and ${\sim}$0.1 dex (non-LTE) below the Milky Way inner disk value. The average non-LTE $\alpha_{\rm CO}$ is $2.4{\pm}0.5$ M$_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$ (K km s$^{-1}$)$^{-1}$. While both methods show dispersion due to underlying assumptions, the scatter is larger for LTE-derived values. This study underscores the necessity for robust CO line modeling to accurately constrain the molecular ISM's physical and chemical conditions in nearby galaxies.
#### Constraining bursty star formation histories with galaxy UV and H$\alpha$ luminosity functions and clustering

 - **Abstract**
 The observed prevalence of galaxies exhibiting bursty star formation histories (SFHs) at $z\gtrsim6$ has created new challenges and opportunities for understanding their formation pathways. The degenerate effects of the efficiency and burstiness of star formation on the observed UV luminosity function are separable by galaxy clustering. However, quantifying the timescales of burstiness requires more than just the continuum UV measurements. Here we develop a flexible semi-analytic framework for modeling both the amplitude of star formation rate (SFR) variations and their temporal correlation, from which the luminosity function and clustering can be derived for SFR indicators tracing different characteristic timescales (e.g., UV continuum and H$\alpha$ luminosities). Based on this framework, we study the prospect of using galaxy summary statistics to distinguish models where SFR fluctuations are prescribed by different power spectral density (PSD) forms. Using the Fisher matrix approach, we forecast the constraints on parameters in our PSD-based model that can be extracted from mock JWST observations of the UV and H$\alpha$ luminosity functions and clustering bias factors at $z\sim6$. These constraints demonstrate the feasibility of constraining the burstiness of high-$z$ galaxies solely from their one-point and two-point statistics and underscore the importance of combining tracers of both long-term and short-term SFR variations. Our flexible framework can be readily extended to characterize the SFH of high-redshift galaxies with a wider range of observational diagnostics.

 - **Abstract**
 The Seyfert 1 AGN Fairall 9 was targeted by NICER, Swift, and ground-based observatories for a $\sim$1000-day long reverberation mapping campaign. The following analysis of NICER spectra taken at a two-day cadence provides new insights into the structure and heating mechanisms of the central black hole environment. Observations of Fairall 9 with NICER and Swift revealed a strong relationship between the flux of the UV continuum and the X-ray soft excess, indicating the presence of a "warm" Comptonized corona which likely lies in the upper layers of the innermost accretion flow, serving as a second reprocessor between the "hot" X-ray corona and the accretion disk. The X-ray emission from the hot corona lacks sufficient energy and variability to power slow changes in the UV light curve on timescales of 30 days or longer, suggesting an intrinsic disk-driven variability process in the UV and soft X-rays. Fast variability in the UV on timescales shorter than 30 days can be explained through X-ray reprocessing, and the observed weak X-ray/UV correlation suggests that the corona changes dynamically throughout the campaign.
#### Dust Battery: A Novel Mechanism for Seed Magnetic Field Generation in the Early Universe

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a novel dust battery mechanism for generating seed magnetic fields in the early universe, in which charged dust grains are radiatively accelerated, inducing strong electric currents that subsequently generate magnetic fields. Our analysis demonstrates that this process is effective even at very low metallicities (approximately $ \sim 10^{-5} Z_\odot$), and capable of producing seed fields with significant amplitudes of $B \sim \rm \mu G$ around luminous sources over timescales of years to Myr and across spatial scales ranging from au to kpc. Crucially, we find that this mechanism is generically $\sim10^8$ times more effective than the radiatively-driven electron battery or Biermann battery in relatively cool gas ($\ll 10^{5}\,$K), including both neutral and ionized gas. Furthermore, our results suggest that, to first order, dissipation effects do not appear to significantly impede this process, and that it can feasibly generate coherent seed fields on macroscopically large ISM scales (much larger than turbulent dissipation scales or electron mean-free-paths in the ISM). These seed fields could then be amplified by subsequent dynamo actions to the observed magnetic fields in galaxies. Additionally, we propose a sub-grid model for integration into cosmological simulations, and the required electric-field expressions for magnetohydrodynamic-particle-in-a-cell (MHD-PIC) simulations that explicitly model dust dynamics. Finally, we explore the broad applicability of this mechanism across different scales and conditions, emphasizing its robustness compared to other known battery mechanisms.
#### Mapping the Sun's coronal magnetic field using the Zeeman effect

 - **Abstract**
 Regular remote sensing of the magnetic field embedded within the million-degree solar corona is severely lacking. This reality impedes fundamental investigations of the nature of coronal heating, the generation of solar and stellar winds, and the impulsive release of energy into the solar system via flares and other eruptive phenomena. Resulting from advancements in large aperture solar coronagraphy, we report unprecedented maps of polarized spectra emitted at 1074 nm by Fe+12 atoms in the active corona. We detect clear signatures of the Zeeman effect that are produced by the coronal magnetic field along the optically thin path length of its formation. Our comparisons with global magnetohydrodynamic models highlight the valuable constraints that these measurements provide for coronal modeling efforts, which are anticipated to yield subsequent benefits for space weather research and forecasting.
#### Rising from the Ashes II: The Bar-driven Abundance Bimodality of the Milky Way

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.21580

 - **Abstract**
 The Milky Way hosts at least two modes in its present day distribution of Fe and alpha-elements. The exact cause of this bimodality is disputed, but one class of explanations involves the merger between the Milky Way and a relatively massive satellite (Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus) at z~2. However, reproducing this bimodality in simulations is not straightforward, with conflicting results on the prevalance, morphology, and mechanism behind multimodality. We present a case study of a galaxy in the Illustris TNG50 simulation which undergoes sequential phases of starburst, brief quiescence, and then rejuvenation. This scenario results in a pronounced abundance bimodality after a post-processing adjustment of the [alpha/Fe] of old stars designed to mimic a higher star formation efficiency in dense gas. The high- and low-alpha sequences are separated in time by the brief quiescent period, which is not associated with a merger but by the formation of a bar followed by AGN activity. This galaxy indicates a novel scenario in which the alpha-bimodality in the Milky Way is caused by the formation of the bar via AGN-induced quenching. In addition to a stellar age gap in the Milky Way, we predict that abundance bimodalities should be more common in barred as opposed to unbarred galaxies.
#### Near Earth stream decoherence revisited: the limits of orbital similarity

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Orbital similarity measures, such as the D-values, have been extensively used in meteor science to identify meteoroid streams and associate meteorite falls with near-Earth objects (NEOs). However, the chaotic nature of near-Earth space challenges the long-term reliability of these measures for stream identification, and the increasing size of our fireball, meteorite fall, and NEO databases make random associations more common. Despite this, many researchers erroneously continue to use orbital similarity beyond its inherent limits. Aims. We aim to assess the statistical significance of using orbital similarity measures for identifying streams of meteoroids or asteroids and explore the implications of chaotic dynamics on the long-term coherence of these streams. Conclusions. The rapid decoherence of meteoroid streams and the chaotic dynamics of near-Earth orbits suggest that no reported stream or NEO associations of meteorites or fireballs are statistically significant according to orbital discriminates. Many are likely coincidental rather than indicative of a true physical link. However, several statistically significant clusters found within the NEO population are consistent with a tidal disruption formation. This contrast and lack of statistically significant associations amongst the impact datasets is likely due to the fireball databases being 2 orders of magnitude smaller than the NEO database and the higher intrinsic uncertainties of fireball observation derived orbits.

 - **Abstract**
 We have developed a new method of multi-wavelength data combination for the search of late-type radio dwarfs, and have put it into practice using GLEAM-X DR1 data. The initial sample is selected by cross-matching the Gaia/DR3 objects with the probability of being a star no less than 99$\%$, and removing the extragalactic objects assigned by the SIMBAD database. The late-type dwarf stars are judged according to their location in the $(BP-RP)_0/M_{\rm G}$ color-magnitude diagram and in the $(J-H)_0/(K-W1)_0$ near-infrared color-color diagram. Furthermore, stellar activity is searched by ultraviolet excess in the GALEX/NUV band and the Rossby number in the TESS light curves. In total, 12 stars are found to be late-type dwarf stars associated with radio source, which is consisted of five stars with the UV excess and seven stars with the Rossby number less than 0.13. Three of these 12 stars are previously studied to be associated with radio objects. All these 12 stars are considered to be reliable counterparts of radio sources.

 - **Abstract**
 Blind spectroscopy of massive lensing galaxy clusters with MUSE has revealed large numbers of gravitationally-lensed Lyman-$ \alpha $ emitters exhibiting asymmetric profiles at $ 2.9 \leq z \leq 6.7 $, suggesting abundant outflows from low-mass star-forming galaxies in the early universe. Are these primaeval galaxies experiencing their first bursts of star formation, or established galaxies experiencing rejuvenation? With JWST rest-frame optical/NIR continuum imaging now available for many of these objects, we can search for older stellar populations. Here, we search for spectroscopic confirmation of outflows from these galaxies, finding a few high-signal-to-noise cases in which blueshifted interstellar absorption lines are detected. Next, we analyse the star formation histories with combined HST + JWST photometry. We find most them to be well characterised by very young, low metallicity stellar populations. However, despite the rest-frame optical/NIR coverage of JWST, we cannot place strict upper bounds on the mass in old stars (age $ > 100\,\text{Myr} $).

 - **Abstract**
 Recent JWST observations have revealed a large population of intermediate/low-luminosity AGN at early times with peculiar properties, different from local AGN or luminous quasars. To better understand the physical conditions in the BLRs of these early AGN, we used the optical FeII (4434--4684 Å) and the broad $\rm H \beta$ emission, and the ratio between their equivalent widths $R_{Fe}$, as a probe on a purposefully assembled sample. Specifically, we gathered a sample of 26 high redshift ($\langle z \rangle$=6.4) AGN, observed by JWST, with broad $\rm H\beta$ detection both in the high and low luminosity regimes (respectively 14 faint AGN and 12 quasars), to investigate their optical FeII emission properties. In addition, we carefully selected control samples at lower $z$. We found that the population of faint AGN ($\rm \log(L_{H \beta} / (erg \, s^{-1}))\lesssim 44$) exhibits a significantly lower FeII emission than their local counterparts ($R_{Fe}<$0.24 versus $R_{Fe}\simeq$0.85 in the control sample), while the quasars at the epoch of reionisation observed by JWST present a FeII emission profile that closely resembles that observed at $z<3$. We argue that the weakness of the FeII bump in the faint JWST AGN might be due to the reduced metallicity of their broad line region ($\lesssim 0.5~Z_{\odot}$), while luminous quasars have already reached chemical maturity ($\sim Z{_\odot}$ or higher). Lastly, we highlight an intriguing similarity between the spectral properties of the high redshift population of faint AGN with those harboured in local metal poor dwarf galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 We present capivara, a fast and scalable multi-decomposition package designed to study astrophysical properties within distinct structural components of galaxies. Our spectro-decomposition code for analyzing integral field unit (IFU) data enables a more holistic approach, moving beyond conventional radial gradients and the bulge-plus-disk dichotomy. It facilitates comprehensive comparisons of integrated stellar ages and metallicities across various galactic structures. Our classification method naturally identifies outliers and organizes the different pixels based on their dominant spectral features. The algorithm leverages the scalability and GPU acceleration of Torch, outputting both a one-dimensional spectrum and a full data cube for each galaxy component, without relying on Voronoi binning. We demonstrate the capabilities of our approach using a sample of galaxies from the MaNGA survey, processing the resulting data cubes with the starlight spectral fitting code to derive both stellar population and ionized gas properties of the galaxy components. Our method effectively groups regions with similar spectral properties in both the continuum and emission lines. By aggregating the spectra of these regions, we enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of our analysis while significantly speeding up computations by reducing the number of spectra processed simultaneously. capivara will be freely available on GitHub.

 - **Abstract**
 Kilonovae, possible electromagnetic counterparts to neutron star mergers, provide important information about high-energy transient phenomena and, in principle, also allow us to obtain information about the source properties responsible for powering the kilonova. Unfortunately, numerous uncertainties exist in kilonova modeling that, at the current stage, hinder accurate predictions. Hence, one has to account for possible systematic modeling uncertainties when interpreting the observed transients. In this work, we provide a data-driven approach to account for time-dependent and frequency-dependent uncertainties in kilonova models. Through a suite of tests, we find that the most reliable recovery of the source parameters and description of the observational data can be obtained through a combination of kilonova models with time- and frequency-dependent systematic uncertainties. We apply our new method to analyze AT2017gfo. While recovering a total ejecta mass consistent with previous studies, our approach gives insights into the temporal and spectral evolution of the systematic uncertainties of this kilonova. We consistently find a systematic error below $1$ mag between $1$ to $5$ days after the merger. Our work addresses the need for early follow-up of kilonovae at earlier times, and improved modeling of the kilonova at later times, to reduce the uncertainties outside of this time window.

 - **Abstract**
 Robust modeling of non-linear scales is critical for accurate cosmological inference in Stage IV surveys. For weak lensing analyses in particular, a key challenge arises from the incomplete understanding of how non-gravitational processes, such as supernovae and active galactic nuclei - collectively known as baryonic feedback - affect the matter distribution. Several existing methods for modeling baryonic feedback treat it independently from the underlying cosmology, an assumption which has been found to be inaccurate by hydrodynamical simulations. In this work, we examine the impact of this coupling between baryonic feedback and cosmology on parameter inference at LSST Y1 precision. We build mock 3$\times$2pt data vectors using the Magneticum suite of hydrodynamical simulations, which span a wide range of cosmologies while keeping subgrid parameters fixed. We perform simulated likelihood analyses for two baryon mitigation techniques: (i) the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method which identifies eigenmodes for capturing the effect baryonic feedback on the data vector and (ii) HMCode2020 (Mead et al. 2021) which analytically models the modification in the matter distribution using a halo model approach. Our results show that the PCA method is robust to the coupling between cosmology and baryonic feedback, whereas, when using HMCode2020 there can be up to $0.5\sigma$ bias in $\Omega_\text{m}$-$S_8$. For HMCode2020, the bias also correlates with the input cosmology while for PCA we find no such correlation.
#### On the Ubiquity of Extreme Baryon Concentrations in the Early Universe

 - **Abstract**
 Early JWST observations have revealed the ubiquitous presence in the early Universe, up to z about16, of extreme baryon concentrations, namely forming globular clusters, extremely dense galaxies that may or may not be UV bright, and supermassive black holes in relatively low-mass galaxies. This paper is trying to pinpoint which physical conditions may have favored the formation of such concentrations, that appear to be very common at high redshifts while their formation being progressively more and more rare at lower redshifts. Building on local globular cluster evidence, it is argued that such conditions can consist in a combination of a 10 Myr extended feedback free time, coupled to low angular-momentum densities in deep local minima of the ISM vorticity field, where baryon concentrations are more likely to form. It is argued that the former condition would follow from more massive stars failing to explode as supernovae, and the latter one from low vorticity prevailing in the early Universe, in contrast to later times with their secular increase of the angular momentum density due to the cumulative effect of tidal interactions.

 - **Abstract**
 After over three decades of unsuccessful attempts, we report the first detection of molecular gas emission in Malin 1, the largest spiral galaxy observed to date, and one of the most iconic giant low surface brightness galaxies. Using ALMA, we detect significant $^{12}$CO(J=1-0) emission in the galaxy's central region and tentatively identify CO emission across three regions on the disc. These observations allow for a better estimate of the H$_2$ mass and molecular gas mass surface density, both of which are remarkably low given the galaxy's scale. By integrating data on its HI mass, we derive a very low molecular-to-atomic gas mass ratio. Overall, our results highlight the minimal presence of molecular gas in Malin 1, contrasting sharply with its extensive, homogeneous atomic gas reservoir. For the first time, we position Malin 1 on the Kennicutt-Schmidt (K-S) diagram, where it falls below the main sequence for normal spirals, consistent with previous upper limits but now with more accurate figures. These findings are crucial for constraining our understanding of star formation processes in environments characterized by extremely low molecular gas densities and for refining models of galaxy formation, thereby improving predictions concerning the formation, evolution, and distribution of these giant, elusive galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 Blazars are beamed active galactic nuclei known for their strong multi-wavelength variability on timescales from years down to minutes. We aim to investigate the suitability of the twisting jet model presented in previous works to explain the multi-wavelength behaviour of BL Lacertae, the prototype of one of the blazar classes. According to this model, the jet is inhomogeneous, curved, and twisting, and the long-term variability is due to changes in the Doppler factor due to variations in the orientation of the jet-emitting regions. We analysed optical data of the source obtained during monitoring campaigns organised by the Whole Earth Blazar Telescope (WEBT) in 2019-2022, together with radio data from the WEBT and other teams, and gamma-ray data from the Fermi satellite. In this period, BL Lacertae underwent an extraordinary activity phase, reaching its historical optical and gamma-ray brightness maxima. The application of the twisting jet model to the source light curves allows us to infer the wiggling motion of the optical, radio, and gamma-ray jet-emitting regions. The optical-radio correlation shows that the changes in the radio viewing angle follow those in the optical viewing angle by about 120 days, and it suggests that the jet is composed of plasma filaments, which is in agreement with some radio high-resolution observations of other sources. The gamma-ray emitting region is found to be co-spatial with the optical one, and the analysis of the gamma-optical correlation is consistent with both the geometric interpretation and a synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) origin of the high-energy photons. We propose a geometric scenario where the jet is made up of a pair of emitting plasma filaments in a sort of double-helix curved rotating structure, whose wiggling motion produces changes in the Doppler beaming and can thus explain the observed multi-wavelength long-term variability.
