 - **Abstract**
 Protoplanetary disks naturally emerge during protostellar core-collapse. In their early evolutionary stages, infalling material dominates their dynamical evolution. In the context of planet formation, this means that the conditions in young disks are different from the typically considered disks where infall has subsided. High inward velocities are caused by the advection of accreted material which is deficient in angular momentum, rather than being set by viscous spreading, and accretion gives rise to strong velocity fluctuations. Therefore, we aim to investigate when it is possible for the first planetesimals to form and subsequent planet formation to commence. We analyze the disks obtained in numerical 3D nonideal magnetohydrodynamical simulations, which serve as a basis for 1D models representing the conditions during the Class 0/I evolutionary stages. We integrate the 1D models with an adapted version of the TwoPopPy code to investigate the formation of the first planetesimals via the streaming instability. In disks with temperatures such that the snow line is located at ~10 AU and where it is assumed that velocity fluctuations felt by the dust are reduced by a factor of 10 compared to the gas, ${\sim}10^{-3}M_\odot$ of planetesimals may be formed already during the first 100 kyr after disk formation, implying the possible early formation of giant planet cores. The cold-finger effect at the snow line is the dominant driver of planetesimal formation, which occurs in episodes and utilizes solids supplied directly from the envelope, leaving the disk solid reservoir intact. However, if the cold-finger effect is suppressed, early planetesimal formation is limited to cold disks with efficient dust settling whose dust-to-gas ratio is initially enriched to $\epsilon_0\geq 0.03$.

 - **Abstract**
 The Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) observations of accreting X-ray pulsars (XRPs) continue to provide novel insights into the physics and geometry of these sources. We present the first X-ray polarimetric study of the persistent wind-fed XRP 4U 1538-52, based on five IXPE observations totaling 360 ks, conducted in March and October 2024. We detect marginally significant polarization in the combined data set in the full 2--8 keV energy band, with a polarization degree (PD) of 3.0+-1.1% and polarization angle (PA) of -18 degrees. The energy-resolved analysis shows a clear energy dependence of the polarization properties, with a remarkable ~70 degrees switch in PA between low and high energies. Similarly, the pulse phase-resolved spectro-polarimetric analysis reveals different signatures at low and high energies. At low (2--3 keV) energies, the PD ranges between ~2% and ~18%, with the PA varying between -16 and 70 degrees. At higher (4--8 keV) energies, the PD varies between ~3% and ~12%, with a drastically different PA behavior. Fitting the rotating vector model to the pulse phase dependence of the PA at the lower energies, we constrain the geometric configuration of the pulsar. The analysis favors a high spin-axis inclination of >50 which agrees with both previous pulse-phase-dependent spectral fitting of the cyclotron line region and the known high orbital inclination of the binary system. The magnetic obliquity is estimated to be 30 degrees and the spin position angle to be 19 degrees. A sharp switch in PA around 3 keV presents a particular theoretical challenge, as it is not consistent with the right-angle switch that was only seen in one other pulsar Vela X-1.
#### Deep Chandra observations of PLCKG287.0+32.9: a clear detection of a shock front in a heated former cool core

 - **Abstract**
 The massive, hot galaxy cluster PSZ2 G286.98+32.90 (hereafter PLCKG287, z=0.383) hosts a giant radio halo and two prominent radio relics which are signs of a disturbed dynamical state. However, despite optical and radio observations indicate a clear multiple merger, the X-ray emission of the cluster, derived from XMM-Newton observations, shows only moderate disturbance. We present new 200 ks Chandra observations of PLCKG287. We detect a shock front to the NW direction at a distance of ~390 kpc from the X-ray peak, characterized by a Mach number M~1.3, as well as a cold front at a distance of ~300 kpc from the X-ray peak, nested in the same direction of the shock in a typical configuration expected by a merger. We also find evidence for X-ray depressions to the E and W, that could be the signature of feedback from the active galactic nucleus (AGN). The radial profile of the thermodynamic quantities show a temperature and abundance peak in the cluster center, where also the pressure and entropy have a rapid increase. Based on these properties, we argue that PLCKG287 is what remains of a cool core after a heating event. We estimate that both the shock energy and the AGN feedback energy, implied by the analysis of the X-ray cavities, are sufficient to heat the core to the observed temperature of ~17 keV in the central ~160 kpc. We discuss the possible origin of the detected shock by investigating alternative scenarios of merger and AGN outburst, finding that they are both energetically viable. However, no single model seems able to explain all the X-ray features detected in this system. This suggests that the combined action of merger and central AGN feedback is likely necessary to explain the reheated cool core, the large-scale shock and the cold front. The synergy of these two processes may act in shaping the distribution of cool core and non cool core clusters. [Abridged]
#### Compact groups from semi-analytical models of galaxy formation -- VI: Evolution of the two first-ranked galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 [Abridged] Compact groups (CGs) of galaxies have proven to be unique environments for studying galaxy interactions. We propose a detailed analysis of the galaxy evolution to disentangle the relationship between the two first-ranked galaxies in CGs throughout their history as a function of the assembly channels of their hosts. Our study was performed from a semi-analytical point of view, using more than 20000 CGs. We based our analysis on studying the first- (1R) and second-ranked (2R) galaxies in CGs, where the ranking is determined using the galaxy stellar mass. The 1R galaxies have significantly reduced their star-forming capacity over time, reaching a quenching stage and often becoming bulge-dominated or elliptical. Notably, this transformation occurred earlier for 1R galaxies in early-formed CGs (around 5 to 8 Gyrs ago), while those in recently-formed CGs experienced this change more recently (around 2 to 3 Gyrs ago). The analysis of the time evolution of a variant of the Tremaine & Richstone statistics showed that the 1R galaxy in early-formed CGs began to stand out for its dominant properties around 6 Gyrs ago, almost 5 Gyrs earlier than the 1R inhabiting recently formed CGs. We observed that a large majority of the 1R galaxies have experienced at least one major merger event during their life, while we observed this only for a third of 2R galaxies. The 1R galaxies can also display several of these events and most of their last major merger events can be described as the addition of a progenitor that is the second most massive galaxy in their surroundings at the time of the merger. We find that the semi-analytical framework explored in this work describes a scenario where galaxy mergers are the main driving force in shaping the properties of the 1R galaxies in CGs. We note that this scenario is especially intensive when those galaxies inhabit CGs that had formed early on.

 - **Abstract**
 Acetone (CH3COCH3) is one of the most abundant three-carbon oxygen-bearing complex organic molecules (O-COMs) that have been detected in space. Recently, acetone ice has been reported as (tentatively) detected toward B1-c, which enables the gas-to-ice comparison of its abundances. The detection of acetone ice warrants a more systematic study of its gaseous abundances which is currently lacking. Therefore, we conducted systematic measurements of acetone gas in a dozen hot cores observed by the CoCCoA survey and investigate the chemical evolution from ice to gas of acetone in protostellar systems. We fit the ALMA spectra to determined the column density, excitation temperature, and line width of acetone, along with propanal (C2H5CHO), ketene (CH2CO), and propyne (CH3CCH), which might be chemically linked with acetone. We found that the observed gas abundances of acetone are surprisingly high compared to those of two-carbon O-COMs, while aldehydes are overall less abundant than other O-COMs (e.g., alcohols, ethers, and esters). This may suggest specific formation or destruction mechanisms that favor the production of ethers, esters, and ketones over aldehydes. The derived physical properties suggest that acetone, propanal, and ketene have the same origin from hot cores as other O-COMs, while propyne tends to trace the more extended outflows. The acetone-to-methanol ratios are higher in ice than in gas by one order of magnitude, hinting at gas-phase reprocessing after sublimation. There are several suggested formation pathways of acetone (in both ice and gas) from acetaldehyde (CH3CHO), ketene, and propylene (C3H6). The observed ratios between acetone and the relevant species are rather constant across the sample, and can be well reproduced by astrochemical simulations, but more investigations are needed to draw solid conclusions.

 - **Abstract**
 The Ultraviolet Near-Infrared Optical Northern Survey (UNIONS) is a "collaboration of collaborations" that is using the Canada-France-Hawai'i Telescope, the Pan-STARRS telescopes, and the Subaru Observatory to obtain $ugriz$ images of a core survey region of 6250 deg$^2$ of the northern sky. The $10\sigma$ point source depth of the data, as measured within a 2-arcsecond diameter aperture, are $[u,g,r,i,z] = [23.7, 24.5, 24.2, 23.8, 23.3]$\ in AB magnitudes. UNIONS is addressing some of the most fundamental questions in astronomy, including the properties of dark matter, the growth of structure in the Universe from the very smallest galaxies to large-scale structure, and the assembly of the Milky Way. It is set to become the major ground-based legacy survey for the northern hemisphere for the next decade and provides an essential northern complement to the static-sky science of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time. UNIONS supports the core science mission of the {\it Euclid} space mission by providing the data necessary in the northern hemisphere for the calibration of the wavelength dependence of the {\it Euclid} point-spread function and derivation of photometric redshifts in the North Galactic Cap. This region contains the highest quality sky for {\it Euclid}, with low backgrounds from the zodiacal light, stellar density, extinction, and emission from Galactic cirrus. Here, we describe the UNIONS survey components, science goals, data products, and the current status of the overall program.

 - **Abstract**
 Filament eruptions are magnetically driven violent explosions commonly observed on the Sun and late-type stars, sometimes leading to monster coronal mass ejections that directly affect the nearby planets' environments. More than a century of research on solar filaments suggests that the slow evolution of photospheric magnetic fields plays a decisive role in initiating filament eruptions, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Using high-resolution observations from the \textit{Chinese H$\alpha$ Solar Explorer}, the \textit{Solar Upper Transition Region Imager}, and the \textit{Solar Dynamics Observatory}, we present direct evidence that a giant solar filament eruption is triggered by a series of minifilament eruptions occurring beneath it. These minifilaments, which are homologous to the giant filament but on a smaller tempo-spatial scale, sequently form and erupt due to extremely weak mutual flux disappearance of opposite-polarity photospheric magnetic fields. Through multi-fold magnetic interactions, these erupting minifilaments act as the last straw to break the force balance of the overlying giant filament and initiate its ultimate eruption. The results unveil a possible novel pathway for small-scale magnetic activities near the stellar surface to initiate spectacular filament eruptions, and provide new insight into the magnetic coupling of filament eruptions across different tempo-spatial scales.

 - **Abstract**
 We present polarization profiles of 23 pulsars exhibiting interpulse (IP) emissions using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST). By applying the rotating vector model (RVM), we measured the inclination and impact angles for 16 pulsars, allowing us to investigate their beam geometries. Our analysis indicates that for 5 pulsars, the IP emissions likely originate from the same magnetic pole as the main pulse (MP), whereas for the remaining 11 pulsars, the IP and MP emissions originate from opposite magnetic poles. For the 7 pulsars that do not conform to the RVM, we are unable to determine whether the IP emissions originate from the same or opposite magnetic pole as the MPs. By analyzing the beam configurations of pulsars, we found that the emission within the beam is not fully active across both longitude and latitude. Filling factors ranging from 0.27 to 0.99 were obtained for pulsars with opposite pole IP emissions, suggesting an underestimation of emission height when applying the geometrical method. The emissions for MPs and IPs occur at different heights in the pulsar magnetosphere, with the difference in emission height ranging from tens to thousands of kilometers. We also found that some pulsars have wide emission beams, indicating that radio emissions may occur in regions of high altitude within the pulsar magnetosphere.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar type-II radio bursts are coherent plasma emissions arising from magnetohydrodynamic shocks produced by either coronal mass ejections (CMEs) or flares. Type-II bursts sometimes show split-band emissions in the dynamic spectrum. When these split-band emissions come from regions just upstream and downstream of the shock, type-II band-splitting can be used as an important tool for estimating magnetic fields at the shock front. Earlier studies have shown that only $\sim$20\% of the type-IIs show morphologically similar split-bands. Imaging studies can unambiguously identify such instances, though they remain very rare. Here we suggest a useful approach to augment dynamic spectra-based studies by also examining the Gradient Dynamic Spectra (GraDS) of type-II emission. We also verified the conclusions of this approach against those from an imaging study.

 - **Abstract**
 We present results from a search for radio afterglows of compact object mergers conducted with the Australian SKA Pathfinder. We used data from four epochs of the Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey to search compact binary merger localization regions observed during the LIGO/Virgo O2, and O3 observing runs. Our investigation focused on eleven events (published in the GWTC-1, GWTC-2, and GWTC-3 catalogues of gravitational-wave events) with 90\% posterior localisations smaller than $150\,°^2$ and $\ge$99\% probabilities of being of astrophysical origin, to identify potential radio afterglow-like transients up to $\lesssim$1500 days post-merger. We identified candidate afterglow-type variable sources in the 90\% localisation for events -- GW190503, GW200202 and GW200208, which were ruled out as unlikely to be related to the corresponding GW event on further analysis. Since we find no likely candidate counterparts, we constrain the inclination angle and the circum-merger density at isotropic equivalent energies ranging from $2\times10^{51} -1\times10^{54}\rm \:erg$. These constraints are based on the assumption that the electron energy distribution in the associated jets follows a power-law index of $ p = 2.2$, with 1% of the shock energy in the magnetic field ($ \epsilon_B = 0.01$) and 10% in the electrons ($\epsilon_e = 0.1$). We discuss the detectability of late-time afterglows as a function of merger distance and inclination angles with millijansky surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 The formation mechanisms of open cluster (OCs) groups remain unclear due to limited sample sizes and data precision. Recent advancements in Gaia astrometric data provide an unprecedented opportunity to study OC groups in greater detail. This study aims to extend the sample of OC groups and investigate their formation and evolution mechanisms, with a focus on the role of stellar feedback in triggering star formation. We identify four new OC groups based on Gaia data, whose member OCs are spatially proximate and kinematically coherent. Their age spreads are consistent with the timescale of continuous star formation, suggesting that their member OCs formed sequentially from the same molecular cloud. N-body simulation results further reveal that these groups will gradually disperse, evolving into independent OCs. By analyzing the correlation between OC ages and their separation from potential SN explosion sites, we predict SN explosion regions around the birthplaces of OC groups. The strong correlation between OC ages and predicted SN explosion sites supports a supernova-triggered star formation scenario. Additionally, we trace pulsar (PSR) orbits to examine their association with these regions. We detected three PSRs near Group 1 and 26 PSRs near Group 2, whose birthplaces align with the predicted SN explosions regions. The presence of PSRs associated with OC groups provides additional observational evidence for SN explosions in this region, further supporting a supernova-triggered star formation scenario for G1 and G2. We propose that multiple SN explosions in a short period triggered the formation of Group 1 and Group 2, reinforcing the hierarchical star formation model. These results highlight the multi-scale interactions driving star and OC formation and provide new insights into the role of stellar feedback in shaping OC groups.

 - **Abstract**
 The variability of Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) is a crucial tool for understanding the mechanisms driving flux changes. In this study, we present an infrared variability analysis of a large sample of over 20,000 candidate YSOs, using data from the ALLWISE and NEOWISE surveys, which span around a decade with a 6-month cadence. We applied Lomb-Scargle Periodogram (LSP) analysis and linear fitting to the light curves, classifying them into distinct categories: {\it Secular} ({\it Linear}, {\it Curved}, and {\it Periodic}) and {\it Stochastic} ({\it Burst}, {\it Drop}, and {\it Irregular}). Our findings show that 5,467 (26.2$\pm$0.3\%) of the sources exhibit variability, with most (19.7$\pm$0.3\%) showing {\it Irregular} variations, followed by {\it Curved} and {\it Periodic} variations. In addition, 235 sources of {\it Bursts} and 122 {\it Drop} sources were identified. Variability is more pronounced in Class I sources with a higher fraction of variables (36.3$\pm$0.6\%) compared to Class II (22.1$\pm$0.4\%) and Class III (22.5$\pm$1.0\%) sources. The color (W1 $-$ W2) versus magnitude analysis (W2) using linear fitting shows that the trend ``redder-when-brighter" (RWB) is more prevalent (85.4$\pm$0.5\%) among YSOs. In contrast, the trend ``bluer-when-brighter" (BWB) is more common in younger sources compared to more evolved ones, having a BWB fraction of 29.0$\pm$1.1\% for Class I to 4.0$\pm$0.9\% for Class III.

 - **Abstract**
 We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 2023ixf covering from day one to 442 days after explosion. SN 2023ixf reached a peak $V$-band absolute magnitude of $-18.2 \pm 0.07$, and light curves show that it is in the fast-decliner (IIL) subclass with a relatively short ``plateau'' phase (fewer than $\sim 70$ days). Early-time spectra of SN 2023ixf exhibit strong, very narrow emission lines from ionized circumstellar matter (CSM), possibly indicating a Type IIn classification. But these flash/shock-ionization emission features faded after the first week and the spectrum evolved in a manner similar to that of typical Type II SNe, unlike the case of most genuine SNe~IIn in which the ejecta interact with CSM for an extended period of time and develop intermediate-width emission lines. We compare observed spectra of SN 2023ixf with various model spectra to understand the physics behind SN 2023ixf. Our nebular spectra (between 200-400 d) match best with the model spectra from a 15 $\rm M_{\odot}$ progenitor which experienced enhanced mass loss a few years before explosion. A last-stage mass-loss rate of $\dot{M} = 0.01 \rm M_{\odot} yr^{-1}$ from the r1w6 model matches best with the early-time spectra, higher than $\dot{M} \approx 2.4 \times 10^{-3} \rm M_{\odot} yr^{-1}$ derived from the ionized H${\alpha}$ luminosity at 1.58 d. We also use SN 2023ixf as a distance indicator and fit the light curves to derive the Hubble constant by adding SN 2023ixf to the existing sample; we obtain H$_{0}=73.1^{+3.68}_{-3.50}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, consistent with the results from SNe~Ia and many other independent methods.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we investigate the heliospheric modulation of cosmic rays in interplanetary space, focusing on their propagation times and energy losses over the solar cycle. To perform the calculations, we employed a data-driven model based on the stochastic method. Our model was calibrated using time-resolved and energy-resolved data from several missions including AMS-02, PAMELA, EPHIN/SOHO, BESS, and data from Voyager-1. This approach allows us to calculate probability density functions for the propagation time and energy losses of cosmic protons and antiprotons in the heliosphere. Furthermore, we explore the temporal evolution of these probabilities spanning from 1993 to 2018, covering a full 22-year cycle of magnetic polarity, which includes two solar minima and two magnetic reversals. Our calculations were carried out for cosmic protons and antiprotons, enabling us to investigate the role of charge-sign dependent effects in cosmic ray transport. These findings provide valuable insights into the physical processes of cosmic-ray propagation in the heliosphere and contribute to a deeper understanding of the solar modulation phenomenon.

We apply the method developed in Paper I (Zhou et al. 2023) to the updated SWiM_v4.2 catalog, and measure the optical attenuation curve and the attenuation in three NUV bands for 2487 spaxels selected from 91 galaxies with S/N>20 and $A_V$>0.25. We classify all spaxels into two subsets: star-forming (SF) regions and non-SF regions. We explore the correlations of optical opacity ($A_V$) and the optical and NUV slopes of attenuation curves ($A_B/A_V$ and $A_{w2}/A_{w1}$) with a broad range of stellar and emission-line properties, including specific surface brightness of H$\alpha$ emission, stellar age, stellar and gas-phase metallicity, and diagnostics of recent star formation history. When comparing SF and non-SF regions, we find that $A_V$ and $A_B/A_V$ exhibit similar correlations with all the stellar population and emission-line properties considered, while the NUV slopes in SF regions tend to be flatter than those in non-SF regions. The NUV slope $A_{w2}/A_{w1}$ exhibits an anti-correlation with specific surface brightness of H$\alpha$ emission, a trend that is primarily driven by the positive correlation between $A_{w2}/A_{w1}$ and $\Sigma_\ast$. The NUV slope flattens in SF regions that contain young stellar populations and have experienced recent star formation, but it shows no obvious dependence on stellar or gas-phase metallicity. The spatially resolved dust attenuation properties exhibit no clear correlations with the inclination of host galaxies or the galactocentric distance of the regions. This finding reinforces the conclusion from Paper I that dust attenuation is primarily regulated by local processes on kpc scales or smaller, rather than by global processes at galactic scales.

 - **Abstract**
 Characterizing the temporal variability of astrophysical sources is key to understanding the underlying physical processes driving their emissions. This work introduces a gammapy_SyLC, a Python package that offers tools to simulate and fit time-domain data, with a focus on Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) variability. The package was developed taking into account possible interactions with gammapy but does not directly depend on it. gammapy_SyLC incorporates optimized implementations of the Timmer & Koenig and Emmanoulopoulos algorithms for light curve simulation, capable of generating synthetic lightcurves from specified PSDs and amplitude distribution models. It also provides functionalities for PSD fitting, histogram-based PDF interpolation, and Monte Carlo-based parameter estimation, making it a full-stack tool for investigating variable phenomena and specifically the long-term behavior of AGNs. To showcase its capabilities, the package was applied to gamma-ray light curves from the Fermi Large Area Telescope repository, reconstructing PSDs and PDFs and constraining variability models for observed sources.

 - **Abstract**
 Stars in galactic centers are occasionally scattered so close to the central supermassive black hole that they are completely disrupted by tidal forces, initiating a transient accretion event. The aftermath of such a tidal disruption event (TDE) produces a bright-and-blue accretion flow which is known to persist for at least a decade (observationally) and can in principle produce ionizing radiation for hundreds of years. Tidal disruption events are known (observationally) to be overrepresented in galaxies which show extended emission line regions (EELRs), with no pre-TDE classical AGN activity, and to produce transient ``coronal lines'', such as [FeX] and [FeXIV]. Using coupled CLOUDY-TDE disk simulations we show that tidal disruption event disks produce a sufficient ionizing radiation flux over their lifetimes to power both EELR of radial extents of $r \sim 10^4$ light years, and coronal lines. EELRs are produced when the ionizing radiation interacts with low density $n_H \sim 10^1 - 10^3 \, {\rm cm}^{-3}$ clouds on galactic scales, while coronal lines are produced by high density $n_H \sim 10^6 - 10^8 \, {\rm cm}^{-3}$ clouds near the galactic center. High density gas in galactic centers will also result in the rapid switching on of narrow line features in post-TDE galaxies, and also various high-ionization lines which may be observed throughout the infrared with JWST. Galaxies with a higher intrinsic rate of tidal disruption events will be more likely to show macroscopic EELRs, which can be traced to originate from the previous tidal disruption event in that galaxy, which naturally explains why TDEs are more likely to be discovered in galaxies with EELRs. We further argue that a non-negligible fraction of so-called optically selected ``AGN'' are tidal disruption events.

 - **Abstract**
 The analysis of state-of-the-art cosmological surveys like the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey requires high-resolution, large-volume simulations. However, the computational cost of hydrodynamical simulations at these scales is prohibitive. Instead, dark matter (DM)-only simulations are used, with galaxies populated a posteriori, typically via halo occupation distribution (HOD) models. While effective, HOD models are statistical in nature and lack full physical motivation. In this work, we explore using neural networks (NNs) to learn the complex, physically motivated relationships between DM haloes and galaxy properties. Trained on small-volume, high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations, our NN predicts galaxy properties in a larger DM-only simulation and determines which galaxies should be classified as luminous red galaxies (LRGs). Comparing the original LRG sample to the one generated by our NN, we find that, while the subhalo mass distributions are similar, our NN selects fewer low-mass subhaloes as LRG hosts, possibly due to the absence of baryonic feedback effects in DM-only simulations. This feedback could brighten or redden galaxies, altering their classification. Finally, we generate a new LRG sample by fitting an HOD model to the NN-generated LRG sample. We verify that both the HOD- and NN-generated samples preserve a set of bias parameter relations, which assume that the higher-order parameters, $b_{s2}$ and $b_{3\rm{nl}}$, are determined by the linear bias parameter $b_{1}$. These relations are commonly used to simplify clustering analyses.

 - **Abstract**
 The XMM-Newton observatory has accumulated a vast archive of over 17,000 X-ray observations over the last 25 years. However, the standard data processing pipelines may fail to detect certain types of transient X-ray sources due to their short-lived or dim nature. Identifying these transient sources is important for understanding the full range of temporal X-ray behaviour, as well as understanding the types of sources that could be routinely detected by future missions such as Athena. This work aims to reprocess XMM-Newton archival observations using newly developed dedicated software in order to identify neglected and missed transient X-ray sources that were not detected by the existing pipeline. We use a new approach that builds upon previous methodologies, by transforming event lists into data cubes, which are then searched for transient variability in short time windows. Our method enhances the detection capabilities in the Poisson regime by accounting for the statistical properties of sparse count rates, and allowing for transient search in previously discarded periods of high background activity. Our reprocessing efforts identified 32,247 variable sources at the 3-sigma level and 4,083 sources at the 5-sigma level in 12,926 XMM archival observations. We highlight four noteworthy sources: A candidate quasi-periodic eruption (QPE), a new magnetar candidate, a previously undetected Galactic hard X-ray burst and a possible X-ray counterpart to a Galactic radio pulsar. Our method demonstrates a new, fast, and effective way to process event list data from XMM-Newton, which is efficient in finding rapid outburst-like or eclipsing behaviour. This technique can be adapted for use with future telescopes, such as Athena, and can be generalised to other photon counting instruments operating in the low-count Poisson regime.

 - **Abstract**
 The tilts of bipolar magnetic regions are believed to be caused by the action of Coriolis force on rising magnetic flux tubes. Here we analysed the combined Greenwich and Debrecen observatories sunspot-group data during the period 1874-2017 and the tilt angles of sunspot groups measured at Mt. Wilson Observatory during the period 1917-1986 and Debrecen Observatory during the period 1994-2013. We find that there exists about 8-solar cycle (Gleissberg cycle) trend in the long-term variation of the slope of Joy's law (increase of tilt angle with latitude). There exists a reasonably significant correlation between the slope/coefficient of Joy's law and the slope (namely, residual covariance) of the linear relationship between the rotation residuals and meridional motions of sunspot groups in the northern hemisphere and also in the southern hemisphere during Solar Cycles 16-21. We also find that there exists a good correlation between north--south difference (asymmetry) in the coefficient of Joy's law and that in the residual covariance. We consider the residual covariance represents tentatively the coefficient of angular momentum transport. These results suggest that there exists a relationship between the surface/subsurface poleward/equatorward angular momentum transport and the Joy's law. There is a suggestion of the strength of the Joy's law depends on the strength of the poleward angular momentum transport.

 - **Abstract**
 We report measurements of the linear polarisation degree (PD) and angle (PA) for hard X-ray emission from the Crab pulsar and wind nebula. Measurements were made with the XL-Calibur ($\sim$15-80 keV) balloon-borne Compton-scattering polarimeter in July 2024. The polarisation parameters are determined using a Bayesian analysis of Stokes parameters obtained from X-ray scattering angles. Well-constrained ($\sim$8.5$\sigma$) results are obtained for the polarisation of the $\sim$19-64 keV signal integrated over all pulsar phases: PD=(25.1$\pm$2.9)% and PA=(129.8$\pm$3.2)$^\circ$. In the off-pulse (nebula-dominated) phase range, the PD is constrained at $\sim$4.5$\sigma$ and is compatible with the phase-integrated result. The PA of the nebular hard X-ray emission aligns with that measured by IXPE in the 2-8 keV band for the toroidal inner region of the pulsar wind nebula, where the hard X-rays predominantly originate. For the main pulsar peak, PD=(32.8$^{+18.2}_{-28.5}$)% and PA=(156.0 $\pm$ 21.7)$^\circ$, while for the second peak (inter-pulse), PD=(0.0$^{+33.6}_{-0.0}$)% and PA=(154.5 $\pm$ 34.5)$^\circ$. A low level of polarisation in the pulsar peaks likely does not favour emission originating from the inner regions of the pulsar magnetosphere. Discriminating between Crab pulsar emission models will require deeper observations, e.g. with a satellite-borne hard X-ray polarimeter.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we conduct a comparative analysis of the properties of Blazhko and non-Blazhko RRab stars. We identified 1054 non-Blazhko and 785 Blazhko RRab stars in the photometric data observed by K2 mission, which, combined with those 37 stars observed in the original Kepler field, constituted our study sample. Using the Fourier Decomposition method, we calculated the pulsation parameters, including phase differences and amplitude ratios, for these RRab stars, revealing significant discrepancies in the pulsation parameters between Blazhko and non-Blazhko RRab stars. However, distinguishing between Blazhko and Non-Blazhko RRab stars based on Fourier parameters remains challenging due to the significant overlap in their distributions. By cross-matching our sample with the LRS of LAMOST DR12, we identified 147 Blazhko and 111 non-Blazhko RRab stars, which exhibit similar metallicity distributions. Furthermore, cross-matching with Gaia DR3 data yielded 766 Blazhko and 950 non-Blazhko RRab stars, showing differences in color indices but not in absolute magnitudes. Our findings suggested the Blazhko effect is linked to pulsation parameters and colors, rather than metallicities or absolute magnitude.

 - **Abstract**
 We present power spectra of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy in temperature and polarization, measured from the Data Release 6 maps made from Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) data. These cover 19,000 deg$^2$ of sky in bands centered at 98, 150 and 220 GHz, with white noise levels three times lower than Planck in polarization. We find that the ACT angular power spectra estimated over 10,000 deg$^2$, and measured to arcminute scales in TT, TE and EE, are well fit by the sum of CMB and foregrounds, where the CMB spectra are described by the $\Lambda$CDM model. Combining ACT with larger-scale Planck data, the joint P-ACT dataset provides tight limits on the ingredients, expansion rate, and initial conditions of the universe. We find similar constraining power, and consistent results, from either the Planck power spectra or from ACT combined with WMAP data, as well as from either temperature or polarization in the joint P-ACT dataset. When combined with CMB lensing from ACT and Planck, and baryon acoustic oscillation data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI Y1), we measure a baryon density of $\Omega_b h^2=0.0226\pm0.0001$, a cold dark matter density of $\Omega_c h^2=0.118\pm0.001$, a Hubble constant of $H_0=68.22\pm0.36$ km/s/Mpc, a spectral index of $n_s=0.974\pm0.003$, and an amplitude of density fluctuations of $\sigma_8=0.813\pm0.005$. We find no evidence for excess lensing in the power spectrum, and no departure from spatial flatness. The contribution from Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) anisotropy is detected at high significance; we find evidence for a tilt with suppressed small-scale power compared to our baseline SZ template spectrum, consistent with hydrodynamical simulations with feedback.

 - **Abstract**
 We use new cosmic microwave background (CMB) primary temperature and polarization anisotropy measurements from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) Data Release 6 (DR6) to test foundational assumptions of the standard cosmological model and set constraints on extensions to it. We derive constraints from the ACT DR6 power spectra alone, as well as in combination with legacy data from Planck. To break geometric degeneracies, we include ACT and Planck CMB lensing data and baryon acoustic oscillation data from DESI Year-1, and further add supernovae measurements from Pantheon+ for models that affect the late-time expansion history. We verify the near-scale-invariance (running of the spectral index $d n_s/d\ln k = 0.0062 \pm 0.0052$) and adiabaticity of the primordial perturbations. Neutrino properties are consistent with Standard Model predictions: we find no evidence for new light, relativistic species that are free-streaming ($N_{\rm eff} = 2.86 \pm 0.13$, which combined with external BBN data becomes $N_{\rm eff} = 2.89 \pm 0.11$), for non-zero neutrino masses ($\sum m_\nu < 0.082$ eV at 95% CL), or for neutrino self-interactions. We also find no evidence for self-interacting dark radiation ($N_{\rm idr} < 0.134$), early-universe variation of fundamental constants, early dark energy, primordial magnetic fields, or modified recombination. Our data are consistent with standard BBN, the FIRAS-inferred CMB temperature, a dark matter component that is collisionless and with only a small fraction allowed as axion-like particles, a cosmological constant, and the late-time growth rate predicted by general relativity. We find no statistically significant preference for a departure from the baseline $\Lambda$CDM model. In general, models introduced to increase the Hubble constant or to decrease the amplitude of density fluctuations inferred from the primary CMB are not favored by our data.

 - **Abstract**
 [Abridged] Cassiopeia A (Cas A) provides a unique opportunity to study supernova (SN) dynamics and interactions with the circumstellar medium (CSM). Recent JWST observations revealed the "Green Monster" (GM), a structure with a likely CSM origin. We investigate its pockmarked morphology, characterized by circular holes and rings, by examining the role of small-scale ejecta structures interacting with a dense circumstellar shell. We adopted a neutrino-driven SN model to trace the evolution of its explosion from core collapse to the age of the Cas A remnant using high-resolution 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations. Besides other processes, the simulations include self-consistent calculations of radiative losses, accounting for deviations from electron-proton temperature equilibration and ionization equilibrium, as well as the ejecta composition derived from the SN. The GM's morphology is reproduced by dense ejecta clumps and fingers interacting with an asymmetric, forward-shocked circumstellar shell. The clumps and fingers form by hydrodynamic instabilities growing at the interface between SN ejecta and shocked CSM. Radiative cooling accounting for effects of non-equilibrium of ionization enhances the ejecta fragmentation, forming dense knots and thin filamentary structures that penetrate the shell, producing a network of holes and rings with properties similar to those observed. The origin of the holes and rings in the GM can be attributed to the interaction of ejecta with a shocked circumstellar shell. By constraining the timing of this interaction and analyzing the properties of these structures, we provide a distinction of this scenario from an alternative hypothesis, which attributes these features to fast-moving ejecta knots penetrating the shell ahead of the forward shock.

 - **Abstract**
 Star formation is a fundamental, yet poorly understood, process of the Universe. It is important to study how star formation occurs in different galactic environments. Thus, here, in the first of a series of papers, we introduce the Low-Metallicity Star Formation (LZ-STAR) survey of the Sh2-284 (hereafter S284) region, which, at $Z\sim 0.3-0.5Z_\odot$, is one of the lowest-metallicity star-forming regions of our Galaxy. LZ-STAR is a multi-facility survey, including observations with {\it JWST}, {\it ALMA}, {\it HST}, {\it Chandra} and {\it Gemini}. As a starting point, we report {\it JWST} and {\it ALMA} observations of one of the most massive protostars in the region, S284p1. The observations of shock-excited molecular hydrogen reveal a symmetric, bipolar outflow originating from the protostar, spanning several parsecs, and fully covered by the {\it JWST} field of view and the {\it ALMA} observations of CO(2-1) emission. This allows us to infer that the protostar has maintained a relatively stable orientation of disk accretion over its formation history. The {\it JWST} near-IR continuum observations detect a centrally illuminated bipolar outflow cavity around the protostar, as well as a surrounding cluster of low-mass young stars. We develop new radiative transfer models of massive protostars designed for the low metallicity of S284. Fitting these models to the protostar's spectral energy distribution implies a current protostellar mass of $\sim11\:M_\odot$ has formed from an initially $\sim100\:M_\odot$ core over the last $\sim3\times10^5$ years. Overall, these results indicate that massive stars can form in an ordered manner in low-metallicity, protocluster environments.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the velocity structure of nebular gas in the central galaxies of four clusters: Abell 1835, PKS 0745-191, Abell 262, and RXJ0820.9+0752, using data from the Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI). Velocity structure functions (VSFs) of the [OII] emission line are compared to VSFs of molecular clouds observed with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). Apart from Abell 262 where the gas is located in a circumnuclear disk, the nebular gas in the remaining galaxies lies in off-nuclear filamentary structures with VSFs steeper than the Kolmogorov slope. This steepening may be plausibly attributed to gravity although other factors, such as magnetic stresses and bulk motion,} may be significant. The VSFs of CO and [OII] emission are similar in RXJ0820 and Abell 262, indicating close coupling of the nebular and molecular gases. In contrast, the nebular and molecular gases are differentiated on most scales in PKS 0745 and Abell 1835. This discrepancy is likely due to the radio-AGN churning the gas. We compare the scale-dependent velocity amplitudes of the hot atmospheres constrained by X-ray surface brightness fluctuation analysis using Chandra observations to the nebular VSFs. The large-scale consistency in Abell 1835 and RXJ0820 is consistent with condensation from the hot atmospheres. {We explore substantial systematic biases, including projection effects, windowing, and smoothing effects when comparing VSFs using different telescopes and instruments.
