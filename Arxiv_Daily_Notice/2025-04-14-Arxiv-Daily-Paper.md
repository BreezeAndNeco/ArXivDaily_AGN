 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic filaments form the backbone of the cosmic web, yet their properties and evolution remain uncertain. Using the EAGLE hydrodynamical simulations, we investigate the dark matter density profiles in filaments and their implications for dark matter decay signals. We show that GeV-scale dark matter particles decaying into electron-positron pairs can produce detectable radio synchrotron emission. By leveraging stacked filament radio data, we place stringent constraints on the dark matter decay lifetime, improving existing limits by up to two orders of magnitude for strong filamentary magnetic fields.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we establish and calibrate mid-infrared hydrogen recombination lines observed with JWST as accretion tracers for pre-main-sequence stars that accrete from circumstellar disks. This work is part of a coordinated, multi-observatory effort that monitored the well-known binary system DQ Tau over three orbital periods, capturing its periodic accretion bursts. In this first paper, we present 9 epochs of MIRI-MRS spectra with near-simultaneous LCO photometry and VLT X-Shooter spectroscopy. This program caught exceptional accretion variability, spanning almost two orders of magnitude between the peak of the first periastron accretion burst and the following quiescent phases. The MIRI spectra show H I line luminosities that vary in step with the accretion-luminosity time series measured with LCO and X-Shooter. The tight correlation with accretion and the large line widths, which MIRI resolves for the first time, support an accretion-flow origin for mid-infrared H I transitions. Combining these three exceptional datasets, we derive accurate relations between mid-infrared line and accretion luminosities for three H I transitions (10-7, 7-6, 8-7), and improve upon a previous relation based on Spitzer spectra. These new relations equip the community with a direct measurement of the accretion luminosity from MIRI-MRS spectra. A MIRI-derived accretion luminosity is fundamental for time-domain chemistry studies, as well as for studies of accretion in embedded/distant sources that are currently inaccessible in the optical. With these new relations, we provide accretion luminosities for an archival sample of 38 MRS spectra of protoplanetary disks published to date.
#### Counting Little Red Dots at $z<4$ with Ground-based Surveys and Spectroscopic Follow-up

 - **Abstract**
 Little red dots (LRDs) are a population of red, compact objects discovered by JWST at $z>4$. At $4<z<8$, they are roughly 100 times more abundant than UV-selected quasars. However, their number density is uncertain at $z<4$ due to the small sky coverage and limited blue wavelength coverage of JWST. We present our ground-based search for LRDs at $2\lesssim z\lesssim4$, combining ultra-deep Hyper Suprime-Cam photometry and various (near-)infrared surveys within a total area of $\sim3.1\,\mathrm{deg^{2}}$. We find that for LRDs with $M_{5500}<-22.5$, their number density declines from $\sim10^{-4.5}\,\mathrm{cMpc^{-3}}$ at $z>4$ to $\sim10^{-5.3}\,\mathrm{cMpc^{-3}}$ at $2.7<z<3.7$ and $\sim10^{-5.7}\,\mathrm{cMpc^{-3}}$ at $1.7<z<2.7$. We also present the Magellan/FIRE spectrum of our first followed-up candidate, DEEP23-z2LRD1 at $z_\mathrm{spec}=2.26$, as a proof of concept for our sample selection. Similar to high-redshift LRDs, the spectrum of DEEP23-z2LRD1 exhibits broad H$\alpha$ emission with $\mathrm{FWHM}\approx2400\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ and with nearly symmetric narrow H$\alpha$ absorption. Additionally, DEEP23-z2LRD1 has extremely narrow [OIII] lines with $\mathrm{FWHM}\approx140\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, suggesting the presence of an accreting black hole in a low-mass host galaxy. Limited by the angular resolution of ground-based surveys, we emphasize that spectroscopic follow-ups are required to characterize the contamination fraction of this sample and pin down LRD number density at $z<4$.

 - **Abstract**
 Active galactic nuclei (AGN) have been proposed as environments that can facilitate the capture of extreme-mass-ratio binaries and accelerate their inspiral beyond the rate expected from gravitational wave emission alone. In this work, we explore binaries shortly after capture, focusing on the evolution of the binary parameters when the system is still far from merger. We find that repeated interactions with the AGN disk typically reduce both the inclination and semi-major axis of the orbit. The evolution of the eccentricity is more intricate, exhibiting phases of growth and decay. Nevertheless, as the binary gradually aligns with the disk plane, the system tends to circularize. Interestingly, we also identify scenarios where initially highly eccentric, nearly counter-rotating orbits can undergo a rapid transition to co-rotation while maintaining a constant eccentricity. These dynamical effects could have significant implications for the modeling and interpretation of LISA sources.

 - **Abstract**
 A subset of galaxies have dense nuclei, and when these galaxies are accreted and tidally stripped, the nuclei can masquerade as globular clusters in the halos of large galaxies. If these nuclei contain massive central black holes, some may accrete gas and become observable as active galactic nuclei. Previous studies have found that candidate stripped nuclei rarely host luminous X-ray sources, but these studies were typically restricted to both the most massive candidate nuclei and the most luminous X-ray sources. Here we use new and archival Chandra and XMM-Newton data to search for X-ray emission in a near-complete sample of massive globular clusters and candidate stripped nuclei in the nearest accessible elliptical galaxy, NGC 5128. This sample has the unique advantage that the candidate stripped nuclei are identified dynamically via elevated mass-to-light ratios. Our central result is that 5/22 ($23^{+11}_{-6}$%) of the candidate stripped nuclei have X-ray sources down to a typical limit of $L_X \sim 5 \times 10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$, a fraction lower than or comparable to that among massive clusters with normal mass-to-light ratios (16/41; $39^{+8}_{-7}$%). Hence we confirm and extend the result that nearly all X-ray sources in stripped nuclei are likely to be X-ray binaries rather than active galactic nuclei. If the candidate stripped nuclei have black holes of typical masses $\sim 2 \times 10^{5} M_{\odot}$ needed to explain their elevated mass-to-light ratios, then they have typical Eddington ratios of $\lesssim 2 \times 10^{-6}$. This suggests that it will be challenging to conduct an accretion census of wandering black holes around even nearby galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 Aims. We study the individual and cumulative impact of stellar feedback processes on massive black hole (MBH) growth in a simulated low-mass dwarf galaxy. Methods. A suite of high-resolution radiation-hydrodynamic simulations called Noctua is performed, using the ArepoNoctua numerical framework for BHs in galaxy simulations. The chemical evolution of the gas is explicitly modelled in a time-dependent non-equilibrium way. Two types of stellar feedback are considered: individually-traced type II supernova (SNII) explosions, and radiatively transferred (on-the-fly) ionising stellar radiation (ISR) from OB stars. As part of the numerical framework, we develop and apply a novel physically-motivated model for MBH gas accretion, taking into account the angular momentum of the gas in the radiatively efficient regime, to estimate the gas accretion rate from the sub-grid accretion disc. Results. Without any stellar feedback, an initial $10^4~\mathrm{M}_\odot$ MBH is able to steadily grow over time, roughly doubling its mass after 800 Myr. Surprisingly, the growth of the MBH is more than doubled when only ISR feedback is considered, compared to the no stellar feedback run. This is due to the star formation rate (SFR) being highly suppressed (to a similar level or slightly above that when SNII feedback is considered), enabling a higher cumulative net gas inflow onto the MBH from not only the cold neutral- and molecular medium phases, but also the unstable- and warm neutral medium phases. With SNII feedback included, the gas accretion onto the MBH is episodic over time, and is suppressed by more than an order of magnitude already during the first 150 Myr. When combining SNII with ISR feedback, the growth of the MBH remains suppressed due to SNII feedback, but to a lesser extent compared to the SNII-only feedback run, due to a slightly lower SFR, and hence a reduced number of SNII events.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of 13 broad-line AGNs at $z = 5 - 8$ from the first 10% data of the JWST Cycle 3 Treasury Program COSMOS-3D. These AGNs are identified by their broad H$\alpha$ or H$\beta$ emission lines through the NIRCam grism wide-field slitless spectroscopy. One object at $z = 7.646$ with broad H$\beta$ emission has an F444W magnitude of 23.6 mag, making it one of the brightest $z > 7.5$ broad-line AGNs yet known. Among the 13 AGNs, 10 objects have reddened optical continua with slopes $\beta_{\rm opt}>0$. The remaining three objects have their overall SEDs that resemble those of UV-luminous quasars at similar redshifts, but their $\beta_{\rm opt}$, though negative, are not as blue as those of unobscured quasars. We also obtain MIRI photometry at 7.7-18 $\mu$m for two AGNs and place strong constraints on their rest-frame near-IR SED. We find no significant variability in the rest-frame UV by comparing the COSMOS-3D and COSMOS-Web F115W images taken apart by 60 days in the rest-frame. We compute the H$\alpha$ luminosity functions (LFs) for the broad H$\alpha$ emitters at $z \approx 5-6$ and find a potential redshift evolution when compared with that of the $z \approx 4-5$ sample. We also derive the H$\beta$ LF at $z\sim8$ for AGNs and galaxies by combining our sample with those from the literature. The broad H$\beta$ emitters in this work suggest a number density two orders of magnitude higher than that predicted by the quasar LF based on rest-frame UV-selected samples. As a preview, our work showcases the ability of the COSMOS-3D grism survey to provide a complete view of the properties, growth, and evolution of bright broad-line AGNs at $z>5$.
#### MISTRAL: a model for radiatively efficient AGN winds in cosmological simulations

 - **Abstract**
 Feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) is crucial for regulating galaxy evolution. Motivated by observations of broad absorption line winds from rapidly accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs), we introduce the Mistral AGN feedback model, implemented in the Arepo code. Mistral comes in two versions: continuous radial (Mistral-continuous) and stochastic bipolar momentum deposition (Mistral-stochastic). Using the framework of the IllustrisTNG simulations, we explore the effect of Mistral on BH and galaxy properties, through an idealized Milky Way-mass galaxy and cosmological zoom simulations run down to $z=2$. Unlike standard thermal AGN feedback prescriptions, Mistral generates galaxy-scale winds that mimic outflows driven by BH accretion. Mistral-continuous produces short-lived galactic fountains, and is inefficient at regulating the growth of massive galaxies at $z=2$. In contrast, Mistral-stochastic efficiently suppresses star formation in massive galaxies, and reproduces the empirical stellar-to-halo mass and ($z=0$) BH-stellar mass relations. By supporting large-scale ($>50\,\rm kpc$) outflows while simultaneously preventing gas inflows, Mistral-stochastic additionally regulates the cold and hot gas fractions at both galaxy and halo scales. Mistral-stochastic therefore works self-consistently across the halo mass range explored $\left(10^{12}-3\times10^{13}\,\rm M_\odot\right)$, without adopting a SMBH-mass dependent AGN feedback scheme such as the one used in IllustrisTNG. Our model is a promising tool for predicting the impact of radiatively efficient AGN winds on galaxy evolution, and interpreting the growing population of high-redshift galaxies and quasars observed by JWST. This work is part of the "Learning the Universe" collaboration, which aims to infer the physical processes governing the evolution of the Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 The thermal structure and evolution of protoplanetary disks play a crucial role in planet formation. In addition to stellar irradiation, accretion heating is also believed to significantly affect the disk thermal structure and planet formation processes. We present the long-term evolution (from the beginning of Class II to disk dissipation) of thermal structures in laminar magnetized disks to investigate where and when accretion heating is a dominant heat source. In addition, we demonstrate how the difference in disk structures affects the water content of forming planets. We consider the mass loss by magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) and photoevaporative disk winds to investigate the influence of wind mass loss on the accretion rate profile. Our model includes the recent understanding of accretion heating; that is, the accretion heating in the laminar disks is less efficient than that in turbulent disks because of surface heating at optically thinner altitudes and energy removal by disk winds. We find that the accretion heating is weaker than irradiation heating at around 1--10 au even in the early Class II disk, whereas it can affect the temperature in the inner 1-au region. We also find that the MHD-wind mass loss in the inner region can significantly reduce the accretion rate compared with that in the outer region, in turn reducing accretion heating. Furthermore, using evolving disk structures, we demonstrate that updating accretion heating models impacts the evolution of protoplanets. In particular, we find that our model may produce a dichotomy of the planetary water fraction of 1--10 $M_\oplus$.

 - **Abstract**
 To study how massive variable stars effect their environment, we search for variability among Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) sources located within the optical extent of a nearby starburst galaxy IC 10. We present the ZTF IC 10 catalog, which classifies 1516 $r$ band sources and 864 $g$ band sources within a $225''$ radius around IC 10 into three categories: 1388 (767) $r$ ($g$) band non-variables, 150 (85) $r$ ($g$) band non-periodic variables, and 37 (12) $r$ ($g$) band periodic variables. Among them 101 (48) $r$ ($g$) band non-periodic variables, and 22 (4) $r$ ($g$) band periodic variables are inside IC 10. We verify our classification by cross-matching with previous variability catalogs and machine learning powered classifications. Various analysis including population demographics, color-magnitude diagrams, and cross matching with a set of different surveys and database such as Gaia, XMM-Newton, Chandra, and SIMBAD are also presented. Based on source density and parallax, we distinguish sources within IC 10 from non-IC 10 sources. For IC 10 sources, we highlight flaring super giants, a source with long secondary period, periodic super giants including possible S Doradus luminous blue variable and candidate Miras. For non-IC 10 sources, we present super red sources and compact objects such as a possible long period subdwarf and a periodic X-ray source. The catalog can serve as a useful database to study the connection between various type of massive stars and their host galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 Accretion flows in both stellar and supermassive black holes show a distinct spectral transition. This is seen directly in binaries and changing look AGN, and also in a recent sample of eROSITA X-ray selected, unobscured AGN where the stacked spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for a single black hole mass bin (log $M/M_{\odot} =8-8.5$) clearly show the UV bright disk appearing as the luminosity increases. In binaries, this transition is associated with a change in radio jet, from coupling to the X-ray hot flow with $L_R \propto L_X^{0.7}$ (Fundamental Plane relation), to collapsing when the X-ray hot flow collapses into a disc. We explore the radio behaviour across the transition in our AGN sample by stacking VLASS images. We significantly detect weak radio emission even after subtracting the contribution from star formation in the host galaxy. The residual radio emission remains relatively constant across the transition, despite the mean mass accretion rate changing by a factor 6 and UV flux changing by a factor 100. However, the X-rays change by only a factor 2, giving a constant radio to X-ray flux ratio as predicted by the 'fundamental plane'. We show that this is consistent with these AGN having the same compact radio jet coupling to the X-ray hot flow (not the disc) as in the binaries. The most significant difference is the persistence of the coronal X-rays across the spectral transition in AGN, whereas in binaries the coronal X-rays can be very weak in the disc dominated state.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an optical variability analysis and comparison of the samples of Seyfert 1 and 2 galaxies, selected from the \textit{Swift} 9-month BAT catalog, using the light curves from Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and All-Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN). We measured the normalized excess variance of TESS and ASAS-SN light curves for each target and performed a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test between the two samples, where our results showed significant differences. This is consistent with predictions from the unification model, where Seyfert 2s are obscured by the larger scale dust torus and their variability is suppressed. This variability difference is independent of the luminosity, Eddington ratio, or black hole mass, further supporting geometrical unification models. We searched the dependence of the normalized excess variance of Seyfert 1s on absolute magnitudes, Eddington ratio, and black hole mass, where our results are consistent with relations found in the literature. Finally, a small sub-sample of changing-look AGNs that transitioned during the time frame of the ASAS-SN light curves, with their variability amplitudes changing according to the classification, larger variability as type 1s and smaller as 2s. The change of variability amplitudes can be used to better pinpoint when the type transition occurred. The consistency trend of the variability amplitude differences between Seyfert 1s and 2s and between changing-look AGNs in 1 or 2 stages suggests that variability can be a key factor in shedding light on the changing-look AGN or the dichotomy between Seyfert 1 or 2 populations.

 - **Abstract**
 $\delta$ Scuti stars are hot, rapid rotators and are a poorly understood class of pulsators. Asteroseismology provides the only means with which to probe their interior dynamics. However, their complex and unexplained oscillation patterns restrict analyses to only a small fraction with interpretable pulsations. Here, we identify 5381 $\delta$ Scuti stars from 63 sectors of TESS observations, of which 300 had interpretable oscillations, with 24 showing rotational splittings. We inferred compositions and ages ($\tau$) for the 300 stars finding them in near-ZAMS states (Bedding et al. 2020), and measured the mean envelope rotation rates ($< f_{rot} >$) for 24 of them. Analyzing their age-dependent rotation, we found these stars essentially exhibit weak-to-no spindown, while evolving past the ZAMS across a narrow time-span during which they show regular pulsations. A quantitative fit to their spin-evolution results in a trend $f_{rot} (d^{-1}) \propto (\tau/{Gyr})^{-0.048 \pm 0.016}$, much slower than the spindown of cooler late-type stars due to magnetic braking (Skumanich's law: $f_{rot} (d^{-1}) \propto (\tau/{Gyr})^{-0.5}$). Based on stellar evolution calculations, we show this weak spindown is consistent with the gradual increase in their moment-of-inertia.

 - **Abstract**
 We explored the quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) at multiple periods during an X4.0 flare on 2024 May 10 (SOL2024-05-10T06:27), which occurred in the complex active region of NOAA 13664. The flare radiation reveals five prominent periods in multiple wavelengths. A 8-min QPP is simultaneously detected in wavelengths of HXR, radio, UV/EUV, Lya, and white light, which may be associated with nonthermal electrons periodically accelerated by intermittent magnetic reconnection that is modulated by the slow wave. A quasi-period at 14 minutes is observed in the SXR and high-temperature EUV wavebands, and it may be caused by repeatedly heated plasmas in hot flare loops. A quasiperiod at about 18 minutes is only observed by STIX, with reconstructed SXR images suggesting that the 18-min period pulsations should be considered as different flares. Meanwhile, a 3-min QPP is simultaneously detected in wavelengths of HXR, radio, and UV/ EUV, which is directly modulated by the slow magnetoacoustic wave leaking from sunspot umbrae. At last, a 2-min QPP is simultaneously detected in HXR and radio emissions during the pre-flare phase, which is possibly generated by a quasi-periodic regime of magnetic reconnection that is triggered by the kink wave.

 - **Abstract**
 Over the past decade, stellar rotation has emerged as a key factor in shaping the morphology of color-magnitude diagrams of young and intermediate-age star clusters. In this study, we use MUSE integral-field spectroscopy to investigate the stellar rotation of ~2300 stars in the 1.5 Gyr old cluster NGC 1783 in the Large Magellanic Cloud. The effective temperature, surface gravity, radial velocity, and projected rotational velocity ($v\mathrm{sin}i$) of the entire sample were obtained within a Bayesian framework to derive robust estimates of these parameters along with their associated errors. The analysis shows that stars along the extended main sequence turn-off (eMSTO) cover a wide range of rotational velocities, from values consistent with no/slow rotation up to $v\mathrm{sin}i$ ~ 250 km/s. The distribution of stellar rotation velocities appears to play a crucial role in explaining the broadening of the eMSTO in this cluster, and a correlation is observed between $v\mathrm{sin}i$ and the color of the eMSTO stars, with $v\mathrm{sin}i$ increasing as the color becomes redder. Among the eMSTO stars, we investigate the peculiar population of stars strongly dimmed in the UV (so-called UV-dim stars), recently discovered in NGC 1783. UV-dim stars show clear photometric evidence of self-extinction and mild spectroscopic signatures typically observed in shell stars, thus suggesting that they have likely a decretion disc observed nearly equator-on. Interestingly, the study also shows that a significant fraction of UV-dim stars are slow rotators. We discuss potential implications these results may have on our understanding of the formation and evolution of UV-dim stars and we propose that the rotational properties of the UV-dim stars should vary with cluster age.

 - **Abstract**
 The current generation of millimeter receivers is able to produce cubes of 800 000 pixels by 200 000 frequency channels to cover several square degrees over the 3 mm atmospheric window. Estimating the physical conditions of the interstellar medium (ISM) with an astrophysical model on such datasets is challenging. Common approaches tend to converge to local minima and typically poorly reconstruct regions with low signal-to-noise ratio (S/N). This instrumental revolution thus calls for new scalable data analysis techniques. We present Beetroots, a Python software that performs Bayesian reconstruction of maps of physical conditions from observation maps and an astrophysical model. It relies on an accurate statistical model, exploits spatial regularization to guide estimations, and uses state-of-the-art algorithms. It also assesses the ability of the astrophysical model to explain the observations, providing feedback to improve ISM models. We demonstrate the power of Beetroots with the Meudon PDR code on synthetic data, and then apply it to estimate physical condition maps in the full Orion molecular cloud 1 (OMC-1) star forming region based on Herschel molecular line emission maps. The application to the synthetic case shows that Beetroots can currently analyse maps with up to ten thousand pixels, addressing large variations of S/N, escaping from local minima, and providing consistent uncertainty quantifications. On a laptop, the inference runtime ranges from a few minutes for 100-pixel maps to 28 hours for 8100-pixel maps. The results on the OMC-1 maps are consistent with independent estimations from the literature, and improve our understanding of the region. This work paves the way towards systematic and rigorous analyses of observations produced by current and future instruments.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents a systematic study of X-ray-selected canonical tidal disruption events (TDEs) discovered in the western Galactic hemisphere of the first two eROSITA all-sky surveys (eRASS1 and eRASS2) performed between Dec 2019 and Dec 2020. We compiled a TDE sample from the catalog of eROSITA's extragalactic transients and variables eRO-ExTra, which includes X-ray sources with a variability significance and fractional amplitude over four between eRASS1 and eRASS2, not associated with known AGNs. Each X-ray source is associated with an optical counterpart from the Legacy Survey DR10. Canonical TDEs were selected based on their X-ray light-curve properties (single flare or decline), soft X-ray spectra ($\Gamma>3$), and the absence of archival X-ray variability and AGN signatures in their host photometry and spectroscopy. The sample includes 31 X-ray-selected TDE candidates with redshifts of $0.02< z<0.34$ and luminosities of $5.7 \times 10^{41}<L_X<5.3 \times 10^{44}$ erg/s in the 0.2-6.0 keV rest frame, of which 30 are canonical TDEs and one is an off-nuclear TDE candidate. The derived X-ray luminosity function is best fit by a double power law with a luminosity break at $10^{44}$ erg/s, corresponding to the Eddington-limiting prediction. This corresponds to a TDE volumetric rate of $ (2.3^{+1.2}_{-0.9})\times10^{-7}\,Mpc^{-3} yr^{-1}$ ($\approx1.2\times 10^{-5}$ events per galaxy per year). TDE host galaxies show a green-valley overdensity. In addition, 20%, 30%, and 15% of the sample exhibit flares in the optical, mid-infrared (mid-IR), or radio bands, respectively. We discuss the differences between X-ray, optical, and mid-IR TDE populations and the origins of multiwavelength flares in the context of the obscuring envelope and stream-stream collision models. Finally, we highlight TDE subpopulations that are not included in the canonical sample and should be explored in the future.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a systematic analysis of the radio properties of an X-ray selected sample of tidal disruption event (TDE) candidates discovered by the eROSITA telescope. We find radio sources coincident with half of the transient events (11 TDEs), with 8 radio sources showing statistically significant variability over a 6-month period. We model the radio spectra of 6 sources with sufficiently bright radio emission and find the sources show radio spectra consistent with optically thin synchrotron emission and radio outflow minimum radii of $10^{16}$--$10^{17}$ cm, velocities 0.01--0.05 c, and energies $10^{48}$--$10^{51}$ erg. On comparison with the radio properties of an optically-selected TDE sample at similar late times, we find no significant difference in the radio luminosity range or radio detection rate. We find a tentative positive trend with peak radio and X-ray luminosity, but require further observations to determine if this is real or due to observational bias due to the large range in distances of the events. Interestingly, none of the X-ray selected events show late rising radio emission, compared to 45% of radio-detected sources of an optically-selected sample that showed late rising radio emission. We propose that this may indicate that many TDEs launch radio outflows at or near peak X-ray luminosity, which can be significantly delayed from peak optical luminosity. This study presents the first systematic analysis of the radio properties of an X-ray selected sample of TDEs, and gives insight into the possible link between the physical processes that power X-ray and radio emission in TDEs.

 - **Abstract**
 The observation of peta-electronvolt (PeV) $\gamma$-ray photons from the Crab Nebula by LHAASO has revitalised the possibility of a secondary population of hadrons producing the highest energy emission through neutral pion decay. Despite previous studies modelling this population, the origin of such high-energy hadronic particles remains unclear. We consider possible acceleration scenarios for multi PeV particles in the Crab Nebula environment, including one in which high-energy protons produced at the supernova remnant's outer shock diffuse into the pulsar wind nebula. Particles which reach the Crab Pulsar's wind termination shock can be accelerated to the required energies, and subsequently interact with the dense filaments surrounding the nebula. We perform particle transport simulations of this scenario, including the effects of the expansion of the pulsar wind nebula into the surrounding supernova ejecta. We find that this results in PeV photons being produced over the lifetime of the Crab system, without over-estimating the flux at lower energies or exceeding the energy budget of the Crab Pulsar. This results in a reasonable match to the LHAASO data at the highest energies. We also present predictions for the resulting all-flavour neutrino flux, finding it to be approximately an order of magnitude below the sensitivity of current generation instruments.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar obliquities, or spin-orbit angles, prevalent in exoplanet systems, can impose important constraints on their formation and evolution histories. Recent studies suggest that primordial misalignments between protoplanetary disks and stellar spin axes may significantly contribute to these obliquities, as those frequently observed in systems hosting hot Jupiters. In this study, we demonstrate that misaligned protoplanetary disks combined with stellar oblateness drive complex dynamical evolution in planetary systems during their disk dispersal stages. Specifically, we identify bifurcated evolutionary pathways in multi-planet systems: systems with low star-disk misalignment angles ($\psi_{\star0}$) undergo smooth, adiabatic evolution, producing nearly coplanar, low-obliquity configurations; in contrast, systems with high misalignment angles typically experience an abrupt, non-adiabatic transition, leading to large-amplitude libration of mutual planetary inclinations and then triggering chaotic eccentricity excitation. This libration and eccentricity excitation process can propagate inward-outward in compact multi-planet systems, forming an excitation chain that can destabilize the entire system. The non-adiabatic transition arises from the dynamical bifurcation-induced effect, which occurs during disk dissipation when $\psi_{\star0}\gtrsim44.6^\circ$ (for one-planet systems). Our framework predicts that surviving typical compact multi-planet systems originating from misaligned disks evolve toward coplanar, low-obliquity configurations, consistent with observations of Kepler multi-planet systems. These results advance our understanding of planetary dynamics in misaligned disks and their evolutionary outcomes.
#### Tayler instability as possible reason for the period changes in Ap star 56 Ari

 - **Abstract**
 The physical mechanism responsible for the photometric period changes in chemically peculiar star 56 Ari was searched. It was previously shown that rate of the star's period increase is few orders of magnitude larger than the rates expected from the evolutionary changes of the angular momentum or due to magnetic braking. Also no secular changes were detected in the surface structure or visibility of chemical spots which are responsible for the rotational modulation of stellar brightness. We hypothesise that period changes in 56 Ari are caused by the drift of surface magnetic and associated abundance structures as a result of the kink-type (Tayler) instability of the background magnetic field in the radiative zone of the star. Results of the numerical simulation presented in the paper yield growth and drift rates of the most rapidly developing non-axisymmetric mode of the instability, consistent with the observed rate of period changes in 56 Ari. The surface geometry of the 56 Ari magnetic field is also reproduces in the calculations. The proposed mechanism may also be used to explain the character of period changes in other Ap/Bp stars demonstrating such an effect.

 - **Abstract**
 There is a pressing need to model X-ray Ultra-Violet (XUV: 1-30 nm) stellar irradiances, given the scarcity of current measurements. One of the measurable effects of a stellar cycle is the significant (more than one order of magnitude) variation in XUV irradiance. As a first step in modelling stellar irradiances, we present EUV irradiances in a sample of strong spectral lines formed in different layers and regions of the solar atmosphere, obtained from Solar Dynamics Observatory Extreme Ultraviolet Variability Experiment (SDO EVE). These irradiances span half a solar cycle. We present correlations with several proxies of solar activity, such as the Mg II index, sunspot numbers, and cm radio fluxes. Among these, the sunspot number proves to be the poorest proxy, whereas the Mg II index is a very good proxy for coronal lines (hotter temperature lines). We find a relatively strong linear relationship, which enables us to build a model essential for various applications. Additionally, we compare our results with the previous EUV standard solar irradiances reported by Del Zanna and Andretta 2014, derived from Solar and Heliospheric Observatory Coronal Diagnostic Spectrometer (SOHO CDS) data, as well as historical records from the literature. We have also run a DEM analysis on Quiet Sun (QS) and Active Regions (AR) and list the blends and formation temperatures for the strong lines. Finally we provide a simple routine for deriving the irradiances of the strong lines based on proxy values.
#### Hidden Twin Star Solutions from an Agnostic Speed-of-Sound Model: Confronting XTE J1814--338's Extreme Compactness

 - **Abstract**
 The twin star configuration, where two neutron stars share the same mass but exhibit different radii, arises from a strong first-order phase transition within the stellar interior. In widely used equation of state (EoS) meta-models, such as the Polytrope (PP) and Speed-of-Sound (CS) models, this first-order phase transition behavior can be naturally mimicked by tuning some model parameters. Here, we systematically explore the under-explored parameter space within one of a widely adopted CS model that leads to twin stars via a strong first-order phase transition. Within this twin-star subspace, we perform a comprehensive Bayesian analysis that integrates mass--radius (MR) constraints from X-ray observations of rotation-powered millisecond pulsars. The resultant twin star branch, situated within the 1--1.2 $M_{\odot}$ mass range and approximately 7 km in radius, surprisingly coincides with the MR ranges proposed for the recent anomaly in the Accreting Millisecond X-ray Pulsars XTE J1814--338 (J1814), suggesting a hybrid twin star configuration. Moreover, incorporating the J1814 observation as an additional constraint yields an extreme phase transition pressure $P_{\text{trans}} = 108.9_{-4.85}^{+6.46}$ MeV/fm$^3$, a transition density of $\varepsilon_{\text{trans}}/\varepsilon_0 = 4.847_{-0.134}^{+0.271}$(where $\varepsilon_0$ is the nuclear saturation energy density) and an energy density jump $\Delta \varepsilon = 558.7_{-278.7}^{+303.6}$ MeV/fm$^3$, corresponding to $\Delta \varepsilon/\varepsilon_0 = 3.716_{-1.854}^{+2.020}$. Notably, to satisfy all astrophysical constraints, the speed of sound inside of the hybrid twin star core is driven toward the speed of light ($c_s^2/c^2 > 0.9$), indicating the potential presence of strongly interacting, exotic matter in this core region.
#### Constraints on diffuse X-ray Emission from the TeV halo Candidate HESS J1813-126

 - **Abstract**
 Extended regions of very high energy $\gamma$-ray emission associated with middle-aged pulsars have been found by $\gamma$-ray observatories. These regions, called TeV halos or pulsar halos, are thought to be created when energetic electrons from a pulsar or pulsar wind nebula transport into interstellar medium and undergo inverse Compton scattering with the cosmic microwave background radiation. The same electrons are expected to emit synchrotron emission in the X-ray band in the interstellar magnetic field. HESS J1813-126 is a pulsar halo candidate from which TeV $\gamma$-ray emission with extension 0.21\degr and a hard $E^{-2}$ spectrum is observed. We searched for the synchrotron component of this pulsar halo with Swift-XRT. In particular, we observed two fields within the region covered by HESS J1813-126 for 35 ksec each and a region nearby as a background reference for 10 ksec. We find no evidence for excess X-ray emission from the two observations near HESS J1813-126 and place an upper limit differential flux of $4.32\times 10^{-4}\, \rm keV^{-1}\, cm^{-2}\,s^{-1} $ and $5.38\times 10^{-4}\, \rm keV^{-1}\, cm^{-2}\,s^{-1} $ at 1 keV assuming an $E^{-2}$ power law spectrum. The non-detection implies that the magnetic field inside the halo is not significantly enhanced compared to the average Galactic magnetic field.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Changes of the rotational period observed in various magnetized accreting sources are generally attributed to the interaction between the in-falling plasma and the large-scale magnetic field of the accretor. A number of models have been proposed to link these changes to the mass accretion rate, based on different assumptions on the relevant physical processes and system parameters. For X-ray binaries with neutron stars, with the help of precise measurements of the spin periods provided by current instrumentation, these models render a way to infer such parameters as the strength of the dipolar field and a distance to the system. Often, the obtained magnetic field strength values contradict those from other methods used to obtain magnetic field estimates. Aims. We want to compare the results of several of the proposed accretion models. To this end an example application of these models to data is performed. Methods. We reformulate the set of disk accretion torque models in a way that their parametrization are directly comparable. The application of the reformulated models is discussed and demonstrated using Fermi/GBM and Swift/BAT monitoring data covering several X-ray outbursts of the accreting pulsar 4U 0115+63. Results. We find that most of the models under consideration are able to describe the observations to a high degree of accuracy and with little indication for one model being preferred over the others. Yet, derived parameters from those models show a large spread. Specifically the magnetic field strength ranges over one order of magnitude for the different models. This indicates that the results are heavily influenced by systematic uncertainties.
