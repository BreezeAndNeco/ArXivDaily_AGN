 - **Abstract**
 Recent high-angular-resolution observations indicate the need for core growth to form high-mass stars. To understand the gas dynamics at the core scale in the very early evolutionary stages before being severely affected by feedback, we have conducted Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations toward a 70 $\mu$m dark massive clump, G337.541-00.082 as part of the Global and Local infall in the ASHES sample (GLASHES) program. Using dense gas tracers such as N$_2$H$^+$ ($J = 1-0$) and HNC ($J = 3-2$), we find signs of infall from the position-velocity diagram and more directly from the blue asymmetry profile in addition to the clump-scale velocity gradient. We estimate infall velocities from intermediate and low-mass cores to be 0.28-1.45 km s$^{-1}$, and infall rates to be on the order of 10$^{-4}$ to 10$^{-3}$ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, both are higher than those measured in low-mass star-forming regions by more than a factor of five and an order of magnitude, respectively. We find a strong correlation of the infall velocity with the nonthermal velocity dispersion, suggesting that infall may contribute significantly to the observed line width. Consistent with clump-fed scenarios, we show that the mass infall rate is larger for larger core masses and shorter distances to the clump center. Such high infall rates in cores embedded in IRDCs can be considered as strong signs of core growth, allowing high-mass star formation from intermediate-mass cores that would not initially form high-mass stars at their current mass.

 - **Abstract**
 We present Atacama Compact Array (ACA) Band-3 observations of the protocluster SPT2349$-$56, an extreme system hosting ${\gtrsim}\,12$ submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) at $z\,{=}\,4.3$, to study its integrated molecular gas content via CO(4-3) and long-wavelength dust continuum. The $\sim$30-hour integration represents one of the longest exposures yet taken on a single pointing with the ACA 7-m. The low-resolution ACA data ($21.0''\,{\times}\,12.2''$) reveal a 75% excess CO(4-3) flux compared to the sum of individual sources detected in higher-resolution Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) data ($1.0''\,{\times}\,0.8''$). Our work also reveals a similar result by tapering the ALMA data to $10''$. In contrast, the 3.2mm dust continuum shows little discrepancy between ACA and ALMA. A single-dish [CII] spectrum obtained by APEX/FLASH supports the ACA CO(4-3) result, revealing a large excess in [CII] emission relative to ALMA. The missing flux is unlikely due to undetected faint sources but instead suggests that high-resolution ALMA observations might miss extended and low-surface-brightness gas. Such emission could originate from the circum-galactic medium (CGM) or the pre-heated proto-intracluster medium (proto-ICM). If this molecular gas reservoir replenishes the star formation fuel, the overall depletion timescale will exceed 400Myr, reducing the requirement for the simultaneous SMG activity in SPT2349$-$56. Our results highlight the role of an extended gas reservoir in sustaining a high star formation rate (SFR) in SPT2349$-$56, and potentially establishing the ICM during the transition phase to a mature cluster.

 - **Abstract**
 Persistence effects in HgCdTe infrared detectors cause significant artifacts that can impact the quality of science observations for up to many hours after exposure to bright/saturating sources. This problem will have a substantially greater impact on viable observing modes for infrared cameras on future ELTs due to the leap in sensitivities that is expected. In this paper we present new results from an updated test system that was previously used to prototype ``on-detector guide windows'' to provide fast T/T feedback to AO systems, interleaved with simultaneous (slow) full-frame readouts for science. We now explore the possibility of continuously resetting these small regions of the detector that are illuminated with a compact source as a strategy for mitigating persistence, using two different detectors. While our results generally show promise for this observing strategy, we found for one of our detectors that the combination of fast localized resets with intense illumination can introduce a potentially problematic persistent change in local reset levels.

 - **Abstract**
 The geometry and kinematics of the broad-line region (BLR) in AGNs are still unclear, which is crucial for studying the physics and evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and AGNs. The broad-line profile provides valuable information on BLR geometry and kinematics. In this work, we explore the evolution of line profiles in variable AGNs based on the BLR model of Czerny \& Hryniewicz, where the BLR is driven by the radiation pressure acting on dust at the surface layers of the accretion disk. The line profiles in the low-Eddington-ratio regime show a double-peak profile, which will become a single peak at high Eddington ratios. The high metallicity of $Z\gtrsim 5Z_{\odot}$ is required to reproduce the observational anti-correlation between the peak separation of broad lines and the Eddington ratio for a sample of AGNs. For the broad lines in variable AGNs, it will take several years to several decades to change their line profile if the disk luminosity suffers strong variation in a much shorter timescale. More monitoring of the broad line and continuum in strongly variable AGNs can shed special light on BLR physics.

 - **Abstract**
 Robotic telescope networks play an important role in capturing early and bright optical afterglows, providing critical insights into the energetics and emission mechanisms of GRBs. In this study, we analyze GRB 230204B, an exceptionally energetic and multi-pulsed long GRB, detected by the Fermi GBM and MAXI detectors, with an isotropic equivalent gamma-ray energy exceeding 10$^{54}$ erg. Time-resolved spectral analysis reveals a transition in the prompt emission from hard (sub-photospheric dominated) spectra during early pulses to softer (synchrotron radiation dominated) spectra in later pulses, indicative of a hybrid jet composition. We report the discovery and characterization of the optical afterglow using the MASTER and BOOTES robotic telescope networks, alongside long-term radio observations extending to 335 days post-burst with the ATCA. At ~1.3 ks post-burst, the optical luminosity was exceptionally high, surpassing even other bright GRBs, such as GRB 221009A (the ``BOAT"). Multi-wavelength modeling, incorporating data from MASTER, BOOTES, DOT, Swift/XRT, and radio observations, was conducted using an external ISM forward-shock top-hat jet model with afterglowpy. The results reveal a narrow and highly collimated jet with a circumburst density of n$_{0}$ ~ 28.12 cm$^{-3}$, kinetic energy E$_{K}$ ~ 4.18 x 10$^{55}$ erg, and a relatively low value of $\epsilon_{B}$ = 2.14 x 10$^{-6}$, indicating shock-compression of the magnetic field in the surrounding interstellar medium. We constrained a low radiative efficiency of ~ 4.3 %. This study highlights the indispensable contribution of robotic networks to early afterglow observations and advances our understanding of GRB 230204B unique characteristics and underlying jet physics.

 - **Abstract**
 A potential difference of 1.3 Giga-Volts (GV) was inferred across a thundercloud using data from the GRAPES-3 muon telescope (G3MT). This was the first-ever estimation of gigavolt potential in thunderstorms, confirming prediction of C.T.R. Wilson almost a century ago. To infer the thundercloud potential required acceleration of muons in atmospheric electric field to be incorporated in the Monte Carlo simulation software CORSIKA. The G3MT records over 4 billion muons daily that are grouped into 169 directions covering 2.3 sr sky. This enabled changes as small as 0.1% in the muon flux on minute timescale, caused by thunderstorms to be accurately measured. But that requires high statistics simulation of muon fluxes in thunderstorm electric fields. The CORSIKA offers a choice of several generators for low- (FLUKA, GHEISHA, and UrQMD) and high-energy (SIBYLL, EPOS-LHC, and QGSJETII) hadronic interactions. Since it is unclear which combination of the low- and high-energy generators provides the correct description of hadronic interactions, all nine combinations of generators were explored, and they yielded thundercloud potentials ranging from 1.3 GV to 1.6 GV for the event recorded on 1 December 2014. The result of SIBYLL-FLUKA combination yielded the lowest electric potential of 1.3 GV was reported. Furthermore, another seven major thunderstorm events recorded between April 2011 and December 2020 were analyzed to measure the dependence of their thundercloud potential on the hadronic interaction generators. It is observed that the low-energy generators produce larger variation ($\sim$14%) in thundercloud potential than the high-energy generators ($\sim$8%). This probably reflects the fact that the GeV muons are predominantly produced in low-energy ($<$80 GeV) interactions, which effectively magnifies the differences in the meson production cross-sections among the low-energy generators.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic helicity is a key geometrical parameter to describe the structure and evolution of solar coronal magnetic fields. The accumulation of magnetic helicity is correlated with the non-potential magnetic field energy, which is released in the solar eruptions. Moreover, the relative magnetic helicity fluxes can be estimated only relying on the line-of-sight magnetic field (e.g., Demoulin and Berger Sol. Phys. 215, 203, 2003). The payload Full-disk MagnetoGraph (FMG) on the Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory (ASO-S) currently has been supplying the continuous evolution of line-of-sight magnetograms for the solar active regions, which can be used to estimate the magnetic helicity flux. In this study, we useeight hours line-of-sight magnetograms of NOAA 13273, when at which the Sun-Earth direction speed of the satellite is zero to avoid the oscillation of the magnetic field caused by the Doppler effect on polarization measurements. We obtain the helicity flux by applying Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) and local correlation tracking (LCT) methods to obtain the horizontal vector potential field and the motions of the ine-sf-sight polarities. We also compare the helicity flux derived using data from the Heliosesmic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and the same method. It is found that the flux has the same sign and the correlation between measurements is 0.98. The difference of the absolute magnetic helicity normalized to themagnetic flux is less than 4%. This comparison demonstrates the reliability of ASO-S/FMG data and that it can be reliably used in future studies

 - **Abstract**
 An instability criterion in the MHD with the open boundary of magnetic field is proposed in this paper. We use a series of linear force-free extrapolation field, in which the normal part of magnetic field is fixed, to obtain the linear fitting coefficient called relative alpha by using the co-joined value of magnetic free energy and magnetic flux at the open boundary ($E_f \Phi ^2$) and the square of relative magnetic helicity ($H_R^2$). We calculate this coefficient of the magnetic field above active regions NOAA~8210 and NOAA~11429 obtained by the photospheric-data-driven magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) model. It is found that the fitting coefficient is a good proxy of the criterion to indicate the occurrence of instability after which the magnetic reconnection happens and caused the fast release of magnetic energy. We also applied this method to the continuous evolution of three-dimension magnetic field of NOAA~11158 based on the measurement of photospheric vector magnetic field of SDO/HMI by the Non-linear Force-Free (NLFF) extrapolation method. The calculated coefficient when the major flare happened based on the extrapolation data is very close to the expected ones, which perfectly reflects the occurrence of instability and the difference is even less than 7\%. This relative alpha is very helpful to evaluate how far it is from the instability in the MHD and quantitatively estimate the occurrence of solar eruption in the space weather forecast.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a study on rotation measure (RM) of the quasar 3C 273. This analysis aims to discern the magnetic field structure and its temporal evolution. The quasar 3C 273 is one of the most studied active galactic nuclei due to its high brightness, strong polarization, and proximity, which enables resolving the transverse structure of its jet in detail. We used polarized data from 2014, collected at six frequencies (5, 8, 15, 22, 43, 86 GHz) with the Very Long Baseline Array, to produce total and linear polarization intensity images, as well as RM maps. Our analysis reveals a well-defined transverse RM gradient across the jet, indicating a helical, ordered magnetic field that threads the jet and likely contributes to its collimation. Furthermore, we identified temporal variations in the RM magnitude when compared with prior observations. These temporal variations show that the environment around the jet is dynamic, with changes in the density and magnetic field strength of the sheath that are possibly caused by interactions with the surrounding medium.

 - **Abstract**
 Blazars are often observed to flare across multiple wavelengths. Orphan flares from blazars have been only detected a few times, providing an opportunity to understand the structure of the jet in the accreting system. We report a remarkable orphan X-ray flare from a blazar candidate EP240709a, detected by Einstein Probe (EP) in July 2024. The multi-band spectral properties and variability support EP240709a as a high-energy peaked BL Lacertae-type object. The flux in 0.5-10 keV increases by at least 28 times to the value of low state in 2020, with non-detection of remarkable flaring in other bands during the same period. EP240709a exhibits the harder-when-brighter tendency in the X-ray band during the orphan flare, while its infrared-optical spectra are featureless. We employ one-zone and two-zone leptonic synchrotron self-Compton models to perform the spectral energy distribution fitting. Detecting this rare orphan flare shows the potential of EP in discovering peculiar activities from AGN in high-cadence X-ray sky surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive stars play an important role in the Universe. Unlike low-mass stars, the formation of these objects located at great distances is still unclear. It is expected to be governed by some combination of self-gravity, turbulence, and magnetic fields. In this work, we aim to study the chemical and physical conditions of dense clumps at different evolutionary stages. We performed observations towards 5 regions of massive star and stellar cluster formation (L1287, S187, S231, DR 21(OH), NGC 7538) with the IRAM-30m telescope. We covered the 2 and 3$-$4 mm wavelength bands and analysed the lines of HCN, HNC, HCO$^+$, HC$_3$N, HNCO, OCS, CS, SiO, SO$_2$, and SO. Using astrodendro algorithm on the 850 $\mu$m dust emission data from the SCUBA Legacy catalogue, we determined the masses, H$_2$ column densities, and sizes of the clumps. Furthermore, the kinetic temperatures, molecular abundances, and dynamical state were obtained. The Red Midcourse Space Experiment Source survey (RMS) was used to determine the clump types. A total of 20 clumps were identified. Three clumps were found to be associated with the Hii regions, 10 with young stellar objects (YSOs), and 7 with submillimetre emission. The clumps have typical sizes of about 0.2 pc and masses from 1 to 10$^{2}\,M_\odot$, kinetic temperatures ranging from 20 to 40 K and line widths of $\rm H^{13}CO^{+} (1-0)$ approximately 2 $\rm km\,s^{-1}$. We found no significant correlation in the line width$-$size and the line width$-$mass relationships. However, a strong correlation is observed in mass$-$size relationships. The virial analysis indicated that three clumps are gravitationally bound. Furthermore, we suggested that magnetic fields of about 1 mG provide additional support for clump stability. The molecular abundances relative to H$_2$ are approximately $10^{-10}-10^{-8}$.
#### Unveiling the Emission Mechanisms of Blazar PKS 1510-089: II. Jet-BLR Connection and Black Hole Mass Estimation

 - **Abstract**
 The flat spectrum radio quasar PKS 1510-089 is one of the most active blazars across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, displaying periods of flaring activity. This study explores its spectral variability over a decade. By employing the non-thermal dominance parameter, we analyze the H$\beta$ and $\lambda5100\text{ Å}$ continuum light curves, as well as the full width at half maximum of the H$\beta$ emission line, to identify whether the primary source of the continuum emission is the accretion disk or the jet during activity periods. Our results shows an anti-correlation between the full width at half maximum and the luminosity of the H$\beta$ emission line across all datasets. This indicates, that variations in H$\beta$ luminosity consistently reflects the canonical broad-line region, irrespective of whether the primary ionizing source is the accretion disk or the jet. The anti-correlation persisted when comparing the full width at half maximum of H$\beta$ against the luminosity at $\lambda5100\text{ Å}$ in the disk dominance regime. These findings, along with the observation that flaring events in the $\lambda5100\text{ Å}$ continuum, attributed to the jet, coincide with flares in the H$\beta$ emission line, suggest that the base of the jet is located within the broad-line region. Based on the 219 spectra within the disk dominance regime, we estimated a mean black hole mass of $M_{BH}=2.85\pm0.37\times10^{8}\: M_{\odot}$.

 - **Abstract**
 The study of high-energy gamma-ray emission from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) involves complex synchrotron radiation and synchrotron self-Compton scattering (SSC) mechanisms with multiple parameters exhibiting a wide distribution. Recent advancements in GRB research, particularly the observation of very high energy (VHE, $\rm >100~GeV$) radiation, have ushered in a new era of multiwavelength exploration, offering fresh perspectives and limitations for understanding GRB radiation mechanisms. This study aimed to leverage VHE observations to refine constraints on synchrotron + SSC radiation from electrons accelerated by forward shocks. By analyzing two external environments - the uniform interstellar medium and stratified stellar wind medium, we conducted spectral and variability fitting for five specific bursts (GRB~180720B, GRB~190114C, GRB~190829A, GRB~201216C, and GRB~221009A) to identify the optimal parameters characterizing these events. A comparative analysis of model parameter distributions with and without VHE radiation observations reveals that the magnetic energy equipartition factor $\epsilon_B$ is more concentrated with VHE emissions. This suggests that VHE emissions may offer greater constraints on this microphysical parameter. Additionally, we found that the energy budget between VHE and keV-MeV $\gamma$-ray emissions under the SSC radiation exhibits an almost linear relationship, which may serve as a tool to differentiate radiation mechanisms. We anticipate future statistical analyses of additional VHE bursts to validate our findings.
