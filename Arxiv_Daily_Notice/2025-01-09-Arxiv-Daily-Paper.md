 - **Abstract**
 The observed Lyman-Alpha (Lya) line profile is a convolution of the complex Lya radiative transfer taking place in the interstellar, circumgalactic and intergalactic medium (ISM, CGM, and IGM, respectively). Discerning the different components of the Lya line is crucial in order to use it as a probe of galaxy formation or the evolution of the IGM. We present the second version of zELDA (redshift Estimator for Line profiles of Distant Lyman-Alpha emitters), an open-source Python module focused on modeling and fitting observed Lya line profiles. This new version of zELDA focuses on disentangling the galactic from the IGM effects. We build realistic Lya line profiles that include the ISM and IGM contributions, by combining the Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations for the so called "shell model" (ISM) and IGM transmission curves generated from IllustrisTNG100. We use these mock line profiles to train different artificial neural networks. These use as input the observed spectrum and output the outflow parameters of the best fitting "shell model" along with the redshift and Lya emission IGM escape fraction of the source. We measure the accuracy of zELDA on mock Lya line profiles. We find that zELDA is capable of reconstructing the ISM emerging Lya line profile with high accuracy (Kolmogorov-Smirnov<0.1) for 95% of the cases for HST COS-like observations and 80% for MUSE-WIDE-like. zELDA is able to measure the IGM transmission with the typical uncertainties below 10% for HST-COS and MUSE-WIDE data. This work represents a step forward in the high-precision reconstruction of IGM attenuated Lya line profiles. zELDA allows the disentanglement of the galactic and IGM contribution shaping the Lya line shape, and thus allows us to use Lya as a tool to study galaxy and ISM evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 This study investigates the structural parameters of the thin-disk population by analyzing the spatial distribution of evolved stars in the solar neighbourhood. From the $\it Gaia$ Data Release 3 database, about 39.1 million stars within 1 kpc and with relative parallax errors $\sigma_{\varpi}/\varpi\leq 0.10$ were selected. The photometric data was corrected for extinction using a Galactic dust map. The sample was refined by considering the color-magnitude region $M_{\rm G}\times (G_{\rm BP}-G_{\rm RP})_0$ associated with evolved stars, applying a stricter parallax error limit of $\sigma_{\varpi}/\varpi\leq 0.02$, and yielding 671,600 stars. The star sample was divided into 36 regions based on their Galactic coordinates, with evolved stars in the absolute magnitude range of $-1< M_{\rm G}~{\rm (mag)}\leq 4$ further split into five one-unit magnitude intervals. This led to 180 subgroups whose space density profiles were modelled using a single-component Galaxy model. The analysis shows that the space densities are in agreement with the literature and that the scale heights vary with $200<H~{\rm (pc)}<600$ interval to their absolute magnitudes. Red clump stars in the solar neighbourhood were also estimated to have a scale height of $295\pm10$ pc. These findings indicate that evolved stars with bright absolute magnitudes originate from the evolution of the early spectral-type stars with short scale height, while fainter ones come from the evolution of the intermediate spectral-type stars with large scale height, suggesting variations in scale height reflect the contribution of Galactic evolution processes.

 We present the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) Survey, a 77.2 hour Director's Discretionary Early Release Science Program. CEERS demonstrates, tests, and validates efficient extragalactic surveys using coordinated, overlapping parallel observations with the JWST instrument suite, including NIRCam and MIRI imaging, NIRSpec low (R~100) and medium (R~1000) resolution spectroscopy, and NIRCam slitless grism (R~1500) spectroscopy. CEERS targets the Hubble Space Telescope-observed region of the Extended Groth Strip (EGS) field, supported by a rich set of multiwavelength data. CEERS facilitated immediate community science in both of the extragalactic core JWST science drivers ``First Light" and ``Galaxy Assembly," including: 1) The discovery and characterization of large samples of galaxies at z >~ 10 from ~90 arcmin^2 of NIRCam imaging, constraining their abundance and physical nature; 2) Deep spectra of >1000 galaxies, including dozens of galaxies at 6<z<10, enabling redshift measurements and constraints on the physical conditions of star-formation and black hole growth via line diagnostics; 3) Quantifying the first bulge, bar and disk structures at z>3; and 4) Characterizing galaxy mid-IR emission with MIRI to study dust-obscured star-formation and supermassive black hole growth at z~1-3. As a legacy product for the community, the CEERS team has provided several data releases, accompanied by detailed notes on the data reduction procedures and notebooks to aid in reproducibility. In addition to an overview of the survey and quality of the data, we provide science highlights from the first two years with CEERS data.

 - **Abstract**
 We present optical photometric and spectroscopic observations of the peculiar Type Ia supernova ASASSN-20jq/SN 2020qxp. It is a low-luminosity object with a peak absolute magnitude of $M_B=-17.1\pm0.5$ mag. Despite its low luminosity, its post-peak light-curve decline rate ($\Delta m_{15}(B)=1.35\pm0.09$ mag) and color-stretch parameter (sBV>0.82) are similar to normal SNe Ia, making it an outlier in the luminosity-width and luminosity-color-stretch relations. Early light curves suggest a "bump" during the first 1.4 days of explosion. ASASSN-20jq synthesized a low radioactive $^{56}$Ni mass of $0.09\pm0.01M_\odot$. Near-maximum light spectra reveal strong Si II absorption lines, indicating a cooler photosphere than normal SNe Ia, but lack Ti II absorption lines. Unusually strong O I $\lambda$7773 and Ca II near-infrared triplet absorption features are present. Nebular spectra show a strong, narrow forbidden [Ca II] $\lambda\lambda$7291,7324 doublet emission, rarely seen in SNe Ia except in some Type Iax events. Marginal detection of [O I] $\lambda\lambda$6300,6364 doublet emission, which is extremely rare, is observed. Both [Ca II] and [O I] lines are redshifted by $\sim2000$ km/s. A strong [Fe II] $\lambda$7155 emission line with a tilted-top profile, identical to the [Fe II] $\lambda$16433 profile, is also observed. These asymmetric [Fe II] profiles and redshifted [Ca II] and [O I] emissions suggest a high central density white dwarf progenitor undergoing an off-center delayed-detonation explosion mechanism, producing roughly equal amounts of $^{56}$Ni in deflagration and detonation phases. This distinguishes ASASSN-20jq from normal and subluminous SNe Ia. ASASSN-20jq's light curve and spectra do not align with any single SNe Ia subclass but show similarities to 2002es-like objects. Thus, we add it as an extreme candidate within the heterogeneous parameter space of 2002es-like SNe Ia.

 - **Abstract**
 Quantifying the variability, measured as the root mean square (rms), of accreting systems as a function of energy is a powerful tool for constraining the physical properties of these objects. Here, we present the first application of this method to optical spectra of low-mass X-ray binaries. We use high-time-resolution data of the black hole transient V404 Cygni, obtained with the \textit{Gran Telescopio Canarias} during its 2015 outburst. During this event, conspicuous wind-related features, such as P-Cygni profiles, were detected in the flux spectra. We find that rms spectra are rich in spectral features, although they are typically morphologically different from their flux counterparts. Specifically, we typically observe absorption components in correspondence to the presence of emission lines in the flux spectra. Similarly, when analysing segments with significant variability in the optical flux, P-Cygni line profiles appear inverted in the rms spectra (i.e., enhanced variability in the blue-shifted region, accompanied by a decrease in that associated with the red component). We discuss the possible origin of these features, which resemble those found in other objects, such as active galactic nuclei. Finally, we highlight the potential of this technique for future searches for wind-type outflows in accreting compact objects.

 - **Abstract**
 We present 2D particle-in-cell simulations of a magnetized, collisionless, relativistic pair plasma subjected to combined velocity and magnetic-field shear, a scenario typical for astrophysical black-hole jet-wind boundaries. We create conditions where only the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) and Drift-Kink (DK) instabilities can develop, while tearing modes are forbidden. We find that DKI can effectively disrupt the cats-eye vortices generated by KHI, creating a turbulent shear layer on the DK timescale. This interplay leads to a significant enhancement of dissipation over cases with only velocity shear or only magnetic shear. Moreover, we observe efficient nonthermal particle acceleration caused by the alignment of the instability-driven electric fields with Speiser-like motion of particles close to the shear interface. This study highlights the sensitivity of dissipation to multiple simultaneous instabilities, thus providing a strong motivation for further studies of their nonlinear interaction at the kinetic level.

 - **Abstract**
 We present first results of JWST Cycle 1 and 2 observations of Sgr A* using NIRCam taken simultaneously at 2.1 and 4.8 micron for a total of ~48 hours over seven different epochs in 2023 and 2024. We find correlated variability at 2.1 and 4.8 micron in all epochs, continual short-time scale (a few seconds) variability and epoch-to-epoch variable emission implying long-term ( ~days to months) variability of Sgr A*. A highlight of this analysis is the evidence for sub-minute, horizon-scale time variability of Sgr A*, probing inner accretion disk size scales. The power spectra of the light curves in each observing epoch also indicate long-term variable emission. With continuous observations, JWST data suggest that the flux of Sgr A* is fluctuating constantly. The flux density correlation exhibits a distinct break in the slope at ~3 mJy at 2.1 micron. The analysis indicates two different processes contributing to the variability of Sgr A*. Brighter emission trends towards shallower spectral indices than the fainter emission. Cross correlation of the light curves indicates for the first time, a time delay of 3 - 40 sec in the 4.8 micron variability with respect to 2.1 micron. This phase shift leads to loops in plots of flux density vs spectral index as the emission rises and falls. Modeling suggests that the synchrotron emission from the evolving, age-stratified electron population reproduces the shape of the observed light curves with a direct estimate of the magnetic field strengths in the range between 40-90 G, and upper cutoff energy, E_c, between 420 and 720 MeV.

 - **Abstract**
 Many of the current problems related to the evolution of cataclysmic variables revolve around the magnetic nature of the main sequence secondary. It is known that magnetic fields alter the structure of low mass stars. In particular, they inhibit convection, leading to inflated radii. Here we present a simple model to demonstrate the impact of magneto-convection on the evolution of short period cataclysmic variables. We find that the inclusion of magneto-convection leads to larger secondaries, longer orbital periods and smaller mass-loss rates. When including magnetic effects, the minimum orbital period is increased by 14 minutes, indicating that this could help alleviate the period minimum problem in cataclysmic variable evolution. We also examine the effect of the white dwarf mass on the minimum period. While increasing the white dwarf mass does increase the minimum period, it is not substantial. Therefore it is unlikely that the period minimum problem can be solved with a larger white dwarf mass or with mass growth of white dwarf.

 - **Abstract**
 (Abridged) While previous X-ray studies showed the dominance of regular active galactic nuclei (AGN) variability, a small fraction of sources arise from more exotic phenomena such as tidal disruption events (TDEs), quasi-periodic eruptions, or other short-lived events associated with supermassive black hole accretion. This paper describes the systematic selection of X-ray extragalactic transients found in the first two eROSITA all-sky surveys (eRASS) that are not associated with known AGN prior to eROSITA observations. We generated a variability sample from eRASS1 and eRASS2 (Dec. 2019-Dec. 2020), which includes sources with a variability significance and a fractional amplitude larger than four, located in the Legacy Survey DR10 (LS10) footprint. The properties of LS10 counterparts were used to exclude stars and known AGN. The sample was additionally cleaned using pre-eROSITA classifications, archival optical spectra, and archival X-ray data. The final catalog eRO-ExTra includes 304 extragalactic eROSITA transients and variables not associated with known AGN. More than 90% of sources have reliable LS10 optical counterparts. For each source, we provide archival X-ray data from Swift, ROSAT, and XMM-Newton; the eROSITA long-term light curve (2-2.5 years) with a light curve classification; as well as the best power law fit spectral results at the peak eROSITA epoch. Reliable spectroscopic and photometric redshifts are provided for more than 80% of the sample. Several sources in the catalog are known TDE candidates discovered by eROSITA. In addition, 31 sources are radio detected. The eRO-ExTra transients constitute a relatively clean parent sample of non-AGN variability phenomena associated with massive black holes. More than 95% of eRO-ExTra sources were discovered in X-rays with eROSITA for the first time, which makes it a valuable resource for studying unique nuclear transients.
#### The evolution of the flux-size relationship in protoplanetary discs by viscous evolution and radial pebble drift

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper we study the evolution of radiative fluxes, flux radii and observable dust masses in protoplanetary discs, in order to understand how these depend on the angular momentum budget and on the assumed heat sources. We use a model that includes the formation and viscous evolution of protoplanetary gas discs, together with the growth and radial drift of the dust component. We find that we are best able to match the observed fluxes and radii of class 0/I discs when we assume (i) an initial total angular momentum budget corresponding to a centrifugal radius of 40 au around solar-like stars, and (ii) inefficient viscous heating. Fluxes and radii of class II discs appear consistent with disc models with angular momentum budgets equivalent to centrifugal radii of both 40 au or 10 au for solar like stars, and with models where viscous heating occurs at either full efficiency or at reduced efficiency. During the first 0.5 Myr of their evolution discs are generally optically thick at a wavelength of 1.3 mm. However, after this discs are optically thin at mm-wavelengths, supporting standard means of dust mass estimates. Using a disc population synthesis model, we then show that the evolution of the cumulative evolution of the observable dust masses agrees well with that observed in young star forming clusters of different ages.

 - **Abstract**
 Using JWST Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) images of the globular cluster 47 Tucanae (or NGC 104), taken at two epochs just 7 months apart, we derived proper-motion membership down to $m_{\rm F322W2} \sim 27$. We identified an intriguing feature at the very low-mass end of the main sequence, around $\sim$ 0.08 solar masses, at magnitudes $m_{\rm F322W2} \sim 24$ and $m_{\rm F150W2} \sim 25$. This feature, dubbed "kink", is characterized by a prominent discontinuity in the slope of the main sequence. A similar discontinuity is seen in theoretical isochrones with oxygen-poor chemistries, related to the rapid onset of CH$_4$ absorption. We therefore hypothesize that the cluster hosts disproportionately more oxygen-poor stars near the bottom of the main sequence compared to the upper main sequence and the red giant branch. Our results show no strong or conclusive evidence of a rise in the brown dwarf luminosity function at faint magnitudes, in contrast to previous findings likely affected by faint red background galaxies. In our analysis, we accounted for this contamination by using proper motion membership.

 - **Abstract**
 Low- and intermediate-mass stars evolve through the asymptotic giant branch (AGB), when an efficient mass-loss process removes a significant fraction of their initial mass. A substantial increase in the mass-loss rate at the end of the AGB is observed for at least some stars for unknown reasons. This creates post-AGB objects that are completely enshrouded in thick dusty envelopes and might be associated with binary interactions. We observed the $J=2-1$ line of $^{13}$CO, C$^{17}$O, and C$^{18}$O with the Atacama Large Millimeter / submillimeter Array (ALMA) towards six obscured post-AGB stars (four C-rich and two O-rich sources) to constrain the properties of their circumstellar envelopes, recent mass-loss histories, and initial mass of the central stars. Based on the inferred $^{17}$O/$^{18}$O isotopic ratios, we find all stars to have relatively low initial masses ($< 2~M_\odot$) contrary to suggestions in the literature of higher masses for some sources. We infer a mass for HD~187885 $\sim 1.15~M_\odot$, which is relatively low for a carbon star. For all but one source (GLMP~950), we observe kinematic components with velocities $\gtrsim 30$~km~s$^{-1}$, which are faster than typical AGB wind expansion velocities. For most sources, these higher-velocity outflows display point-symmetric morphologies. The case of Hen~3-1475 is particularly spectacular, with the high-velocity molecular outflow interleaved with the high-velocity outflow of ionised gas observed at optical wavelengths. Based on the size of the emission regions of the slow components of the outflows, we derive typical kinematic ages associated with the C$^{18}$O~$J=2-1$ emission $\lesssim 1500$~years and obtain relatively high associated mass-loss rates ($\gtrsim10^{-4}~M_\odot~{\rm yr}^{-1}$). The sources with known spectral types are found to have evolved faster than expected based on stellar evolutionary models.

 - **Abstract**
 The Cygnus-X complex is a massive, nearby (1.4 kpc) star-forming region with several OB associations. As part of the Cygnus Allscale Survey of Chemistry and Dynamical Environments (CASCADE) program, we carried out 3.6 millimeter (mm) continuum and spectral line high-resolution observations ($\sim$ 3 - 4$''$) toward DR18, covering several molecular species with the Northern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) and the Institut de Radioastronomie Millimétrique (IRAM) 30m telescope. In addition, multi-wavelength archival datasets were used to provide a comprehensive analysis of the region. A comparison of the 3.6mm and 6 cm continuum emission confirms that a B2 star (DR18-05) shapes the cometary HII region in the DR18 cavity, with ionized gas escaping toward the OB2 association. On the other hand, the extended 3.6mm and 6 cm continuum emission are likely to trace photoevaporating ionized gas from ultraviolet radiation from the Cyg OB2 association, not from DR18-05. The shell structure around DR18-05 indicates photodissociation regions (PDRs) formed by the expanding HII region and photo-erosion from DR18-05 and OB2 stars. We also identified 18 compact cores with N$_2$H$^+$ emission, half of which are gravitationally bound and mostly located in colder regions behind the PDRs. The SiO emission is found only in PDRs, with narrow-line widths ( 0.8 - 2.0 km s$^{-1}$) and lower abundances (X(SiO) $\sim$ 5$\times$10$^{-11}$ - 1$\times$10$^{-10}$). Comparing with the UV irradiated shock models, we suggest that the SiO emission partially encompassing the HII region arises from the molecular gas region, marginally compressed by low-velocity shocks with $\sim$ 5 km s$^{-1}$, irradiated by external UV radiation (G$_{\rm 0} \sim 10^{2} - 10^{3}$), as they traverse through a medium with $n_{\rm H} \sim 10^{4}$ to 10$^5$ cm$^{-3}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Despite being the most common types of stars in the Galaxy, the physical properties of late M dwarfs are often poorly constrained. A trend of radius inflation compared to evolutionary models has been observed for earlier type M dwarfs in eclipsing binaries, possibly caused by magnetic activity. It is currently unclear whether this trend also extends to later type M dwarfs below theconvective boundary. This makes the discovery of lower-mass, fully convective, M dwarfs in eclipsing binaries valuable for testing evolutionary models especially in longer-period binaries where tidal interaction between the primary and secondary is negligible. With this context, we present the discovery of the NGTS-EB-7 AB system, an eclipsing binary containing a late M dwarf secondary and an evolved G-type primary star. The secondary star has a radius of $0.125 \pm 0.006 R_\odot$ , a mass of $0.096 \pm 0.004 M_\odot$ and follows a highly eccentric $(e=0.71436 \pm 0.00085)$ orbit every $193.35875 \pm 0.00034$ days. This makes NGTS-EB-7 AB the third longest-period eclipsing binary system with a secondary smaller than $200 M_J$ with the mass and radius constrained to better than $5 \%$. In addition, NGTS-EB-7 is situated near the centre of the proposed LOPS2 southern field of the upcoming PLATO mission, allowing for detection of the secondary eclipse and measurement of the companion`s temperature. With its long-period and well-constrained physical properties - NGTS-EB-7 B will make a valuable addition to the sample of M dwarfs in eclipsing binaries and help in determining accurate empirical mass/radius relations for later M dwarf stars.

 - **Abstract**
 We measure the projected angle on the plane of the sky between adjacent symmetry axes of tens of multipolar planetary nebulae and find that the distribution of these misalignment angles implies a random three-dimensional angle distribution limited to <60 degrees. We identify a symmetry axis as a line connecting two opposite lobes (bubbles) or clumps. We build a cumulative distribution function of the projected angles (alpha) and find that an entirely random distribution of the three-dimensional angles (delta) between adjacent symmetry axes, namely, uncorrelated directions, does not fit the observed one. A good fit to the observed distribution is a limited random distribution of the three-dimensional angle between adjacent symmetry axes, i.e., random distribution in the range of 20<delta<60 degrees. We assume that a pair of jets along the angular momentum axis of an accretion disk around the companion shape each symmetry axis. The limited random distribution might result from two sources of angular momentum to the accretion disks with comparable magnitude: one with a fixed direction and one with a stochastic direction variation. We discuss a scenario where the fixed-axis angular momentum source is the binary orbital angular momentum, while the stochastic source of angular momentum is due to the vigorous envelope convection of the mass-losing giant progenitor.

 - **Abstract**
 The quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) observed in the tails of magnetar giant $\gamma$-ray flares have long been interpreted as normal oscillation modes of these stars. However, most studies modelling QPOs have neglected some key features in the analyses of the signals, namely that QPOs appear to be detectable only intermittently and exhibit drifts in their frequencies. These are typical characteristics of nonlinear mode coupling, where, at leading order, the modes couple and evolve collectively as triplets. Using a representative triplet of modes we solve the system's nonlinear equations of motion analytically and argue that the coupling is likely axial-axial-polar in nature, with the observed intermittence and frequency drifts providing a way to infer details of the magnetar's internal magnetic-field geometry.

 - **Abstract**
 Resistive magnetohydrodynamics is thought to play a key role in transient astrophysical phenomena such as black hole flares and neutron star magnetospheres. When performing numerical simulations of resistive magnetohydrodynamics, one is faced with the issue that Amperes law becomes stiff in the high conductivity limit which poses challenges to the numerical evolution. We show that using a description of resistive magnetohydrodynamics based on higher form symmetry, one can perform simulations with a generalized dual Faraday tensor without having to use Amperes Law, thereby avoiding the stiffness problem. We also explain the relation of this dual model to a traditional description of resistive magnetohydrodynamics and how causality is guaranteed by introducing second order corrections.
