 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic ray (CR) electrons are key tracers of non-thermal processes in galaxies, yet their spectra are often modelled under the untested assumption of steady state between injection and cooling. In this work, we present a time-dependent modelling of CR electron spectra in a galactic context using the CREST code, applied to magnetohydrodynamical simulations of an isolated Milky Way-mass galaxy performed with AREPO. CR electrons are injected at supernova sites and evolved with adiabatic changes and cooling processes on Lagrangian tracer particles, including losses from synchrotron, inverse Compton, bremsstrahlung, and Coulomb interactions. We compare these fully time-dependent spectra to local and global steady-state models computed with CRAYON+, as well as to one-zone analytic steady-state solutions. We find that the global CR electron spectrum in the simulated galactic disk closely resembles a steady-state solution up to energies of 500 GeV, with deviations only at higher energies where cooling times become shorter than injection timescales. High-energy electrons are dominated by recently injected populations that have not yet reached equilibrium, however, producing a steeper spectrum and lower normalisation than a steady-state model predicts. Spatially, the electrons modelled on-the-fly with CREST are more confined to the star-forming disk, in contrast to the more extended distributions from steady-state post-processing models. Our results demonstrate that while steady-state assumptions capture the bulk CR electron population in star-forming disks, a time-dependent treatment is essential to describe the high-energy and outflowing components.

 - **Abstract**
 To examine how AGN feedback shapes the intracluster medium (ICM) and fuels black hole accretion in the cool-core galaxy cluster Abell 2597, we present deep ($\sim$600 ks) Chandra X-ray observations complemented by archival GMRT radio and SINFONI near-infrared data. Radio-mode AGN activity has inflated seven X-ray cavities and driven one to three potential weak shocks ($M \sim 1.05-1.14$) extending to $\sim 150$ kpc, suggesting recurrent outbursts occurring on $\sim 10^7$ year timescales. We also detect a narrow, $\sim$57 kpc X-ray surface brightness deficit-a potential plasma depletion layer-likely shaped by residual sloshing motions that amplified magnetic fields and/or displaced gas within the cluster core. Although the AGN injects $\sim 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ of energy, comparable to the cluster's cooling luminosity, radiative cooling persists at $\sim$15 M$_{\odot} $yr$^{-1}$, replenishing the billion solar mass cold gas reservoir at the heart of the brightest cluster galaxy. Sustaining this level of activity requires a continuous fuel supply, yet the estimated Bondi accretion power ($\sim 2 \times 10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$) falls an order of magnitude short of the observed cavity power, suggesting that "hot" gas fueling is insufficient. Instead, archival ALMA observations continue to support a chaotic cold accretion scenario, where turbulence-driven condensation fuels the AGN at rates exceeding Bondi accretion, sustaining a self-regulated feedback cycle that repeatedly shapes the core of Abell 2597.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate how the obscured IR-derived and the dust-corrected UV star formation rate functions (SFRFs) compare with each other, and with predictions from state-of-the-art theoretical models of galaxy formation and evolution. We derive the IR-SFRF from the ALMA A$^3$COSMOS survey, by converting the IR luminosity functions (IR-LFs) into SFRF after correcting for AGN contribution. Similarly, we obtain the UV SFRFs from literature UV LFs, corrected for dust-extinction. First, we fit the two SFRFs independently via a MCMC approach, then we combine them to obtain the first estimate of the total SFRF out to $z \sim 6$. Finally, we compare this SFRF with the predictions of a set of theoretical models. We derived the UV (dust-extinction corrected, from literature UV-LFs) and IR SFRFs (from Herschel and ALMA IR-LFs) at $0.5 < z < 6$ , finding that they are mostly complementary, covering different ranges in star formation rate (SFR$ < 10-100$ M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ for the UV-corrected and SFR$ > 100$ M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ for the IR). From the comparison of the total SFRF with model predictions we find an overall good agreement at $z < 2.5$, with increasing difference at higher redshifts, with all models missing the galaxies that are forming stars with the highest SFRs. We finally obtained the UV (dust-corrected), IR and total star formation rate densities (SFRDs), finding that there are no redshift ranges where UV and IR alone are able to reproduce the whole total SFRD.

 - **Abstract**
 We use models of spectrally resolved cosmic ray (CR) transport in TIGRESS MHD simulations of the local ISM to produce synthetic synchrotron emission and to test, on scales from a few kpc down to ~10 pc, the traditional estimate of magnetic field strength based on the assumption of equipartition between the magnetic and total CR energy densities. Our analysis shows that the traditional equipartition estimate works well at the kpc scale of the simulation box, but breaks down at smaller scales. We find that the predicted magnetic field strength can be improved at small scales by assuming a constant CR energy density across each mock radio observation. The large-scale mean CR energy density can be estimated by assuming equipartition with the large-scale mean magnetic energy density, or as a function of additional observable quantities such as the star formation rate surface density or gas weight. In addition to estimating the magnetic field strength, we use synthetic polarized emission to create maps of the magnetic field direction. We find that the true magnetic field direction can be recovered well from the mock observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Infrared-luminous galaxies are important sites of stellar and black hole mass assembly at most redshifts. Their luminosities are often estimated by fitting spectral energy distribution (SED) models to near- to far-infrared data, but the dependence of these estimates on the data used is not well-understood. Here, using observations simulated from a well-studied local sample, we compare the effects of wavelength coverage, signal-to-noise (S/N), flux calibration, angular resolution, and redshift on the recovery of starburst, AGN, and host luminosities. We show that the most important factors are wavelength coverage that spans the peak in a SED, with dense wavelength sampling. Such observations recover starburst and AGN infrared luminosities with systematic bias below $20\%$. Starburst luminosities are best recovered with far-infrared observations while AGN luminosities are best recovered with near- and mid-infrared observations, though the recovery of both are enhanced with near/mid-infrared, and far-infrared observations, respectively. Host luminosities are best recovered with near/far-infrared observations, but are usually biased low, by $\gtrsim20\%$. The recovery of starburst and AGN luminosity is enhanced by observing at high angular resolution. Starburst-dominated systems show more biased recovery of luminosities than do AGN-dominated systems. As redshift increases, far-infrared observations become more capable, and mid-infrared observations less capable, at recovering luminosities. Our results highlight the transformative power of a far-infrared instrument with dense wavelength coverage from tens to hundreds of microns for studying infrared-luminous galaxies. We tabulate estimates of systematic bias and random error for use with JWST and other observatories.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetars are the leading candidate sources of fast radio bursts (FRBs). However, the observational probes of the connections between magnetars and FRBs are severely limited by the paucity of detection of highly energetic radio events from magnetars -- to date, only one radio burst as energetic as FRBs has been detected from a Galactic magnetar. Here, we present a detailed analysis of a large sample of low-energy bursts detected from the magnetar XTE J1810$-$197, and probe their implications for FRB emission from magnetars. We report detection of over 97000 bright radio pulses from 242 observations of the magnetar XTE J1810$-$197 over 4.5 years and two decades in frequency (300 MHz to 6.15 GHz), using the Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope and the Green Bank Telescope, after its recent outburst onset in December 2018. We present detailed analysis of the burst fluence distributions and their trends with time as well as frequency, and the waiting time distribution. We show that XTE J1810$-$197 rapidly switches between pulsar-like and giant-pulse-like emission states, and magnetars like XTE J1810$-$197 remain viable and likely emitters of FRBs, in the form of giant-pulses with energies comparable to FRBs. We also demonstrate that the lack of the detection of an underlying periodicity in the bursts from repeating FRBs might be caused by emission across a wide range of spin phases.

 - **Abstract**
 A massive "dark companion"-such as an intermediate-mass black hole or other compact dark object-orbiting the supermassive black hole at the Galactic Center can dynamically reshape the surrounding dark-matter spike. Through gravitational heating and angular-momentum exchange, the companion excavates a "scoured" region that lowers the inner density and suppresses the expected annihilation signal. We quantify this effect by computing the suppression of the dark-matter annihilation $J$-factor induced by such a companion, combining an analytic scouring-radius model with full numerical integrations of the modified density profile. We scan the parameter space of companion mass, orbital separation, system age, and spike slope, explicitly including the interplay with the annihilation plateau. For canonical Gondolo-Silk spikes with $\gamma_{\rm sp} \gtrsim 2$, we find that the distribution is remarkably resilient and that the companion produces at most mild reductions of the $J$-factor. In contrast, for pre-heated or otherwise shallow spikes with $\gamma_{\rm sp} \lesssim 1.8$, even a modest $\sim 10^{4}\,M_\odot$ companion on a O(100) AU orbit and O(Gyr) age can suppress the annihilation flux by one to two orders of magnitude. The numerical results are accurately captured (typically at the $\lesssim 10\%$ level) by a simple fitting formula in terms of a dimensionless scouring parameter that measures the ratio between the scoured region and the annihilation core. Our findings demonstrate that neglecting a dark companion can lead to substantial overestimates of the Galactic Center $J$-factor, with direct consequences for interpreting gamma-ray, neutrino, and antimatter searches for annihilating dark matter.

 - **Abstract**
 We detect rapid downflows of 150-217 km/s in IRIS Si IV 1402.77 nm measurements of an X9-class solar flare on 2024 October 3rd. The fast redshift values persist for over 15 minutes from flare onset, and can be split into two distinct stages of behavior, suggesting that multiple mechanisms are responsible for the downwards acceleration of flare ribbon plasma. The first stage of rapid downflows are synchronized with peaks in emission from the Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory Hard X-ray Imager (ASO-S/HXI) and Large Yield Radiometer (LYRA) Lyman-alpha measurements, indicative that the chromospheric downflows (with a maximum redshift of 176 km/s) result from chromospheric condensations associated with impulsive energy release in the solar flare. Later in the event, strong Si IV flare ribbon downflows persist (to a maximum value of 217 km/s), despite the magnetic flux rate falling to zero, and high-energy HXR and Lyman-alpha measurements returning to background levels. This is reflective of downflows in the flare ribbon footpoints of flare-induced coronal rain. Hard X-ray spectral analysis supports this scenario, revealing strong non-thermal emission during the initial downflow stage, falling near background levels by the second stage. Despite these distinct and contrasting stages of ribbon behavior, Si IV Doppler velocities exhibit quasi-periodic pulsations with a constant ~50 s period across the 15-minute flare evolution (independently of loop length). We deduce that these pulsations are likely caused by MHD oscillations in the magnetic arcade. Finally, we utilize machine learning K-means clustering methods to quantify line profile variations during the stages of rapid downflows.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultra Fast Outflows (UFOs) are powerful, highly ionized winds launched from the innermost regions of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), reaching velocities of 0.03 -- 0.3 c and playing a key role in AGN feedback. We present a photoionization analysis of an 18 ks \xmm\ snapshot of the Seyfert 1 AGN Mrk 877, revealing three distinct UFO components with line-of-sight velocities of $0.10^{+0.005}_{-0.005}~c$ , $ 0.04^{+0.005}_{-0.004}~c$ , and $0.05^{+0.005}_{-0.004}~c$. These components span a broad range of ionization parameters and column densities, producing absorption features across both soft and hard X-ray bands. Even under the most conservative assumption for the volume filling factor, the fastest component exceeds $5\%$ of the Eddington luminosity, making it capable of driving strong galaxy-scale feedback. The soft X-ray UFO component, despite its lower ionization, shares a similar velocity as a higher-ionization component, hinting at a two-phase medium likely shaped by clumpiness or interactions with ambient material. The density profile inferred from the Absorption Measurement Distributions (AMD) and the positive trend between outflow momentum rate and radiation momentum flux suggest that wind is powered by a combination of radiative and magnetic driving.
#### Delayed radio emission in tidal disruption events from collisions of outflows driven by disk instabilities

 - **Abstract**
 Delayed radio emission has been associated with a growing proportion of tidal disruption events (TDEs). For many events, the radio synchrotron emission is inferred to originate from the interaction of mildly-relativistic outflows, launched with delay times of $\sim 100$--$1000$ d after the TDE optical peak. The mechanism behind these outflows remains uncertain, but may relate to instabilities or state transitions in the accretion disk formed from the TDE. We model the radio emission powered by the collision of mass outflows ("flares") from TDE accretion disks, considering scenarios in which two successive disk flares collide with each other, as well as collisions between the outflow and the circumnuclear medium (CNM). For flare masses of $\sim 0.01$-$0.1 M_{\odot}$, varied CNM densities, and different time intervals between ejected flares, we demonstrate that the shocks formed by the collisions have velocities $0.05c$-$0.3c$ at $\sim 10^{17}$ cm and power bright radio emission of $L_{\nu} \sim 10^{27}$-$10^{30}$ erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$, consistent with the properties inferred for observed events. We quantify how the typical peak timescale and flux varies for different properties of our models, and compare our model predictions to a selection of TDEs with delayed radio emission. Our models successfully reproduce the light curves and SEDs for several events, supporting the idea that delayed outflows from disk instabilities and state transitions can power late-time radio emission in TDEs.

 - **Abstract**
 Coronal holes (CHs) are low-activity, low-density solar coronal regions with open magnetic field lines (Cranmer 2009). In the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) spectrum, CHs appear as dark patches. Using daily hand-drawn maps from the Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC), we developed a semi-automated pipeline to digitize the SWPC maps into binary segmentation masks. The resulting masks constitute the CHASM-SWPC dataset, a high-quality dataset to train and test automated CH detection models, which is released with this paper. We developed CHASM (Coronal Hole Annotation using Semi-automatic Methods), a software tool for semi-automatic annotation that enables users to rapidly and accurately annotate SWPC maps. The CHASM tool enabled us to annotate 1,111 CH masks, comprising the CHASM-SWPC-1111 dataset. We then trained multiple CHRONNOS (Coronal Hole RecOgnition Neural Network Over multi-Spectral-data) architecture (Jarolim et al. 2021) neural networks using the CHASM-SWPC dataset and compared their performance. Training the CHRONNOS neural network on these data achieved an accuracy of 0.9805, a True Skill Statistic (TSS) of 0.6807, and an intersection-over-union (IoU) of 0.5668, which is higher than the original pretrained CHRONNOS model Jarolim et al. (2021) achieved an accuracy of 0.9708, a TSS of 0.6749, and an IoU of 0.4805, when evaluated on the CHASM-SWPC-1111 test set.
#### Large Magnetic Flux Rope Formation in an X2.1 Flare observed on September 6, 2011

 - **Abstract**
 Solar active region 11283 produced an X2.1 flare associated with a solar eruption on September 6, 2011. Observations revealed a preflare sigmoidal structure and a circular flare ribbon surrounding the typical two ribbon structure, along with remote brightenings located at a considerable distance from the main flare site. To interpret these observations in terms of the three dimensional (3D) coronal magnetic field dynamics, we conducted data constrained magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. Using a non linear force free field (NLFFF) as the initial condition, we reconstructed a realistic pre flare magnetic environment, capturing a sheared sigmoid above the polarity inversion line (PIL) surmounted by a fan spine structure. Our simulations revealed that reconnection between the sigmoidal field, the adjacent fan dome field lines, and the neighboring large loops facilitated the transfer of magnetic twist and led to the formation of a large magnetic flux rope (MFR). This transfer and propagation of twist are clearly visible throughout the MFR. As reconnection progresses, the entire fan spine structure expands along with the evolving MFR. A notable outcome of the simulation is that the footpoints of the newly formed MFR align closely with the observed circular flare ribbon and the remote brightening region. Our findings suggest that a large MFR formed during the X2.1 flare, providing a coherent explanation for the observed phenomena.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar flares effectively accelerate particles to non-thermal energies. These accelerated electrons are responsible for energy transport and subsequent emissions in HXR, radio, and UV/EUV radiation. Due to the steeply decreasing electron spectrum, the electron population and consequently the overall flare energetics, are predominantly influenced by low-energy non-thermal electrons. However, deducing the electron distribution in this energy-containing range remains a significant challenge. In this study, we apply the warm-target HXR emission model with kappa-form injected electrons to two well-observed GOES M-class flares. Moreover, we utilize EUV observations to constrain the flaring plasma properties, which enables us to determine the characteristics of accelerated electrons across a range from a few keV to tens of keV. We demonstrate that the warm-target model reliably constrains the properties of flare-associated electrons, even accounting for the uncertainties that had previously been unaddressed. The application of a kappa distribution for the accelerated electrons allows for meaningful comparisons with electron distributions inferred from EUV observations, specifically for energy ranges below the detection threshold of RHESSI. Our results indicate that the accelerated electrons constitute only a small fraction of the total electron population within the flaring region. Moreover, the physical parameters, such as electron escape time and acceleration time scale, inferred from both the warm-target model and the EUV observations further support the scenario in which electrons undergo thermalization within the corona. This study highlights the effectiveness of integrating the warm-target model with EUV observations to accurately characterize energy-containing electrons and their associated acceleration and transport processes.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic monopoles are an inevitable feature of post-inflation symmetry-breaking phase transitions in grand unified theories. Analytic estimates of their density indicate that they are compatible with standard cosmology only if their mass is less than $10^{11}$ GeV. We initiate a programme of numerical studies of monopole dynamics by simulating a gas of 't Hooft-Polyakov monopoles formed by the Kibble mechanism after a phase transition. In this paper we simulate monopoles in a radiation background, but without interactions with the radiation, in order to resolve differences between analytical models. We find that during the radiation era, the monopoles find each other and annihilate efficiently enough to keep their density fraction constant, which supports the modelling of Zel'dovich and Khlopov and Preskill in the epoch when plasma interactions can be neglected. In the matter era the density fraction decreases logarithmically. Further work is needed to quantify the effect of the thermal bath, which is expected to reduce the annihilation rate at later times.
#### Unveiling the Sources of X-ray Luminosity in DESI Galaxy Groups: Insights from the SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey

 - **Abstract**
 We use the first eROSITA all-sky survey (eRASS1) to investigate the contributions of AGN and extended gas to the total X-ray luminosity ($L_X$) of galaxy groups with different halo masses ($M_h$) at different redshifts. The presence of AGN in their central galaxies is identified using multi-wavelength catalogs, including the X-ray counterparts, the ASKAP radio catalog, and the DESI spectroscopic measurements. We apply the stacking method to obtain sufficient statistics for the X-ray surface brightness profile and the $L_X$ for groups with different central AGN properties. We find that the X-ray groups exhibit the highest $L_X$, followed by groups with QSO, radio, BPT-AGN, and non-AGN centrals. Moreover, the $L_X$ of the $M_h \lesssim 10^{13}h^{-1}M_\odot$ groups is dominated by the central AGN, while the X-ray emission from extended gas tends to be more prominent in the $M_h \gtrsim 10^{13}h^{-1}M_\odot$ groups. In groups where the AGN play a major role in X-ray emission, the contribution from extended gas is minor, resulting in significant uncertainties concerning the extended X-ray emission. When the subset containing the X-ray detected counterparts is excluded, the extended gas component becomes easier to obtain. A correlation has been identified between the X-ray luminosity of the central AGN and extended gas. However, once we account for the positional offset, their correlation becomes less prominent. Currently, the results are not conclusive enough to confirm whether there is a connection between the AGN feedback and extended gas. However, they provide a new perspective on the feedback processes in the history of group assembly.
#### Enhanced UV emission knot in the giant radio galaxy NGC 315: Hint of patchy star formation?

 - **Abstract**
 High-resolution AstroSat-UltraViolet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) observations revealed a knot of UV emission, $\sim 1.7$ kpc away from the centre of NGC 315, a nearby elliptical galaxy hosting a giant (Mpc scale) radio source with a jet. We suggest that this patchy and spatially extended UV emission is likely due to ongoing star formation (SF) in the galaxy. The estimated SF rate (SFR) averaged over 100 Myr for the UV knot ($0.23\pm0.10$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) is significantly higher compared to a typical elliptical galaxy. As the galaxy does not show the signatures of recent major mergers, the possible mechanisms for the triggered SF include AGN feedback or minor mergers. Hubble Space Telescope} (HST) observations reveal dust filaments that extend through a UV knot. The origin of dusty filaments, though not clear, could be associated with gas clouds as a result of a minor merger, cooled gas falling into the central BCG and/or condensing of the gas uplifted by AGN jet. No significant clumpy UV emission is observed in other regions along the dust filament. We speculate that mechanical feedback from the AGN jet could be playing a role in triggering SF in the UV knot.

 Observational evidence regarding the impact of AGN feedback on star formation (SF) in non-jetted galaxies is limited. With the available high-resolution UV observations from AstroSat-UVIT, complemented by GALEX, we studied the SF properties in the outskirts ($>0.5R_{25}$) of six AGN-host galaxies and compared them with four non-AGN galaxies of similar morphology. We observed a higher SF rate density ($\Sigma_{\text{SFR}}$) for the UV knots in AGN-host galaxies, and it falls off less rapidly compared to non-AGN galaxies, suggesting positive AGN feedback in the outskirts of AGN-host galaxies. Additionally, FUV attenuation (A$_{\text{FUV}}$) is also enhanced in the outer regions and falls less rapidly in AGN-host compared to non-AGN, indicating that the feedback could be coupled with dust. We speculate that the radiation-pressure-driven and/or wind mode AGN feedback could be at play even in low-luminosity nearby AGN-host galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 Non-uniformity plays an important role for MHD waves. For a uniform plasma of infinite extent the MHD waves can be subdivided in two classes with distinct properties. The first class contains the Alfvén waves. The Alfvén waves are incompressible and propagate parallel vorticity. They do not have a parallel component of displacement, they do not cause variations in pressure and are driven by magnetic tension only. The second class contains the magneto-sonic waves. They are compressible and have a parallel component of displacement. They do not propagate parallel vorticity and are driven by pressure and magnetic tension. In non-uniform plasmas the situation can be very different. The clear division between Alfvén waves and magneto-sonic waves is no longer present. In a given part of the equilibrium an MHD wave can strongly resemble a magneto-sonic wave with little or no resemblance to Alfvén waves; while in another part of the equilibrium the MHD wave is practically an Alfvén wave, which has the amazing property of being accompanied by variations in pressure.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The spectral lines of the CH molecule are a key carbon (C) abundance diagnostic in FGKM-type stars. These lines are detectable in metal-rich and, in contrast to atomic C lines, also in metal-poor late-type stars. However, only 3D LTE analyses of the CH lines have been performed so far. Aims. We test the formation of CH lines in the solar spectrum, using for the first time, 3D Non-LTE (NLTE) models. We also aim to derive the solar photospheric abundance of C, using the diagnostic transitions in the optical (4218 - 4356 Å) and infrared (33025 - 37944 Å). Methods. We use the updated NLTE model molecule from Popa et al. (2023) and different solar 3D radiation-hydrodynamics model atmospheres. The models are contrasted against new spatially-resolved optical solar spectra, and the center-to-limb variation (CLV) of CH lines is studied. Results. The 1D LTE and 1D NLTE models fail to describe the line CLV, and lead to underestimated solar C abundances. The 3D NLTE modelling of diagnostic lines in the optical and IR yields a carbon abundance of A(C)=$8.52\pm0.07$ dex. The estimate is in agreement with recent results based on neutrino fluxes measured by Borexino. Conclusions. 3D NLTE modelling and tests on spatially-resolved solar data are essential to derive robust solar abundances. The analysis presented here focuses on CH, but we expect that similar effects will be present for other molecules of astrophysical interest.

 - **Abstract**
 The polar V379 Vir is a well-known magnetic cataclysmic variable with a brown dwarf donor. Despite numerous studies of this system across various spectral ranges, a detailed investigation of the orbital variability of its optical spectra has not been carried out. In this work, we present an analysis of spectroscopic observations of V379 Vir obtained with the 6-m telescope of the Special Astrophysical Observatory of the Russian Academy of Sciences. The orbital variability of the H$\alpha$ emission indicates that the line is most likely formed in the accretion stream near the Lagrangian point L$_1$, rather than on the donor's surface as previously assumed. The analysis of the rotational variability of the Zeeman splitting of hydrogen lines reveals a complex magnetic field topology of the white dwarf, which differs from a simple dipole configuration.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar prominences, or solar filaments, are cool and dense plasma structures in the hot solar corona, whose formation mechanisms have remained a fundamental challenge in solar physics. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current theoretical, numerical, and observational understanding of prominence formation, with a focus on the origin of the dense plasma component. We begin by summarizing the magnetic field configurations that enable prominence support, followed by a classification of four representative plasma formation mechanisms: injection, levitation, evaporation--condensation, and in-situ condensation. Each mechanism is analyzed in terms of its physical basis, numerical realizations, and observational diagnostics. A central focus is placed on the evaporation--condensation scenario, which has seen significant development over the past decade through numerical simulations. We also discuss recent progress in modeling in-situ condensation triggered by magnetic reconnection and levitation dynamics. Throughout, we emphasize the complementary nature of different mechanisms and their potential coexistence in forming and maintaining prominence mass. Observational constraints and recent high-resolution data are reviewed to assess the physical plausibility of each mechanism. We conclude by highlighting open questions and future directions in connecting multi-scale physical processes to the observed diversity of prominence behaviors.

 - **Abstract**
 Faraday Rotation Measure (RM) Grids provide a sensitive means to trace magnetized plasma across a wide range of cosmic environments. We study the RM signal from the Shapley Supercluster Core (SSC), in order to constrain the magnetic field properties of the gas. The SSC region consists of two galaxy clusters A3558 and A3562, and two galaxy groups between them, at $z\simeq 0.048$. We combine RM Grid data with thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect data, obtained from the POSSUM pilot survey, and Planck, respectively. To robustly determine the gas density, its magnetic field properties, and their correlation, we study the RM scatter in the SSC region and its behavior as a function of distance to the nearest cluster/group. We compare observational results with semi-analytic Gaussian random field models and more realistic cosmological MHD simulations. With a sky-density of 36 RMs/deg$^{2}$, we detect an excess RM scatter of $30.5\pm 4.6 \, \mathrm{rad/m^2}$ in the SSC region. Comparing with models, we find an average magnetic field strength of 1-3 $\mu$G (in the groups and clusters). The RM scatter profile, derived from data ranging from 0.3-1.8 $r_{500}$ for all objects, is systematically flatter than expected compared to models, with $\eta<0.5$ being favored. Despite this discrepancy, we find that cosmological MHD simulations matched to the SSC structure most closely align with scenarios where the magnetic field is amplified by the turbulent velocity in the intercluster regions on scales $\lesssim 0.8\,r_{500}$. The dense RM grid and precision provided by POSSUM allows us to probe magnetized gas in the SSC clusters and groups on scales within and beyond their $r_{500}$. Flatter-than-expected RM scatter profiles reveal a significant challenge in reconciling observations with even the most realistic predictions from cosmological MHD simulations in the outskirts of interacting clusters.

 The ExoClock project is an open platform aiming to monitor exoplanets by integrating observations from space and ground based telescopes. This study presents an updated catalogue of 620 exoplanet ephemerides, integrating 30000 measurements from ground-based telescopes (the ExoClock network), literature, and space telescopes (Kepler, K2 and TESS). The updated catalogue includes 277 planets from TESS which require special observing strategies due to their shallow transits or bright host stars. This study demonstrates that data from larger telescopes and the employment of new methodologies such as synchronous observations with small telescopes, are capable of monitoring special cases of planets. The new ephemerides show that 45% of the planets required an update while the results show an improvement of one order of magnitude in prediction uncertainty. The collective analysis also enabled the identification of new planets showing TTVs, highlighting the importance of extensive observing coverage. Developed in the context of the ESA's Ariel space mission, with the goal of delivering a catalogue with reliable ephemerides to increase the mission efficiency, ExoClock's scope and service have grown well beyond the remit of Ariel. The ExoClock project has been operating in the framework of open science, and all tools and products are accessible to everyone within academia and beyond, to support efficient scheduling of future exoplanet observations, especially from larger telescopes where the pressure for time allocation efficiency is higher (Ariel, JWST, VLT, ELT, Subaru etc). The inclusion of diverse audiences in the process and the collaborative mode not only foster democratisation of science but also enhance the quality of the results.

 - **Abstract**
 In order to test the robustness and reliability of the new generation spectral-line identifier PyEMILI, as initially introduced in Paper I, in line identification and establish a reference/benchmark dataset for future spectroscopic studies, we run the code on the line lists of a selected sample of emission-line nebulae, including planetary nebulae (PNe), HII regions, and Herbig-Haro (HH) objects with deep high-dispersion spectroscopic observations published over the past two decades. The automated line identifications by PyEMILI demonstrate significant improvements in both completeness and accuracy compared to the previous manual identifications in the literature. Since our last report of PyEMILI, the atomic transition database used by the code has been further expanded by cross-matching the Kurucz Line Lists. Moreover, to aid the PyEMILI identification of numerous faint optical recombination lines (ORLs) of CII, NII, OII and NeII, we compiled a new dataset of effective recombination coefficients for these nebular lines, and created a new subroutine in the code to generate theoretical spectra of heavy-element ORLs at various electron temperature and density cases; these theoretical spectra can be used to fit the observed recombination spectrum of a PN to obtain the electron temperature, density and ionic abundances using the Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. We present MCMC-derived parameters for a sample of PNe. This work establishes PyEMILI as a robust and versatile tool for both line identification and plasma diagnostics in deep spectroscopy of gaseous nebulae.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the discovery of a strongly lensed galaxy at $z\sim11-12$, dubbed the ``Misty Moons'', identified in the JWST Treasury Survey, Vast Exploration for Nascent, Unexplored Sources (VENUS). The Misty Moons is gravitationally lensed by the galaxy cluster MACS J0257.1-2325 at $z=0.505$, and has five multiple images suggested by two independent lensing models. Two of the five images, ID1 and ID2 ($\mu\sim 20-30$), are very bright (F200W$\sim26$ AB mag) and exhibit blue SEDs with prominent Ly$\alpha$ breaks. In the source plane, the Misty Moons is a sub-$L^*$ galaxy ($M_{\rm UV}\sim-18.0$ mag) resolved into multiple stellar clumps, each of which has effective radius of $r_\mathrm{eff}\sim 10-70$ pc and stellar mass of $\sim10^7\ M_\odot$. These clumps dominate the stellar mass budget of the Misty Moons ($\gtrsim80\%$), similar to other high-$z$ clumps, which suggests a highly clustered mode of star formation in the early Universe, unlike seen in local dwarf galaxies. We convolve the source-plane image with the JWST/NIRCam point-spread function to produce a mock NIRCam image of the Misty Moons without lensing magnification, and find that the intrinsic galaxy has a radial surface-brightness profile comparable to those of $z\gtrsim10$ faint galaxies, such as JADES-GS-z13-0 and JADES-GS-z14-1, indicating that the Misty Moons represents a typical $z\gtrsim10$ faint galaxy. The Misty Moons, a lensed galaxy with resolved internal structures, provides an ideal laboratory for exploring the early stages of galaxy formation at $z\gtrsim10$.

 - **Abstract**
 To advance our understanding of massive star formation, it is essential to perform a comprehensive suite of simulations that explore the relevant parameter space and include enough physics to enable a comparison with observational data. We simulate the gravitational collapse of isolated, parsec-scale turbulent cores using the FLASH code, modelling stars as sink particles. Our simulations incorporate ionizing radiation and the associated radiation pressure from stellar sources, and non-ionizing radiation and its dust heating, along with self-consistent chemistry, to capture the properties of emerging ultra-compact HII regions. Dust, gas, and radiation temperature are computed independently. The initial conditions are informed by ALMAGAL observations. We assess stellar feedback, comparing ionizing radiation and radiation pressure. Ionizing radiation ultimately halts mass accretion on to sink particles, while direct radiation pressure enhances the expansion of HII regions. Heating from non-ionizing radiation suppresses fragmentation. We examine the effect of spatial resolution, finding that higher resolution leads to more sink particles which are situated in environments with higher densities. As a result, ionizing radiation remains trapped longer, allowing continued accretion and yielding a higher overall star formation efficiency (SFE). We explore the impact of varying initial conditions, including the core density profile, virial parameter, and metallicity. Our parameter study reveals that a flatter density profile, higher virial parameter, and increased metallicity promote fragmentation, potentially enhancing the SFE by slowing the growth of the most massive stars and delaying the onset of stellar feedback. Overall, we find SFEs between 35% and 57%. Stellar feedback dictates the final SFE.
#### The Eddington Ratio Distribution of Narrow Line Active Galactic Nuclei

 - **Abstract**
 We measure the Eddington ratio distribution of local optical narrow line active galactic nuclei (AGN) as a function of host galaxy properties, as a potential test of supermassive black hole growth and feedback models in galaxy formation theory. We base our sample on integral field spectroscopy from the MaNGA data in SDSS-IV's DR17. Starting with MaNGA's calibrated row-stacked spectra, we produce new spectroscopic data cubes with minimal covariance between spaxels and higher resolution point spread functions (PSF), and then extract line fluxes for the central PSF. Using the line ratio diagnostic techniques of Ji & Yan (2020), we identify AGN galaxies and determine their H$\beta$ and [O III] line luminosities. For all galaxies not identified as AGN, we determine the threshold line luminosity they would have needed to be identified as AGN. These luminosity thresholds are essential to determine, because many star forming galaxies likely host AGN of significant luminosity that are unidentified because they are outshone by star formation related emission. We show that ignoring these selection effects when measuring the Eddington ratio distribution would lead to biased results. From the H$\beta$ luminosities and luminosity detection thresholds, accounting for selection effects, we measure the luminosity and Eddington ratio distributions of Seyferts as a function of specific star formation rate (sSFR) and stellar mass. Defining $F_{\rm AGN}$ as the occurrence rate of AGN above a fixed Eddington ratio of $10^{-3}$, we find that $F_{\rm AGN}$ is constant or increasing with stellar mass for star forming galaxies and declines strongly with stellar mass for quiescent galaxies. At stellar masses $\log_{10} M_\ast > 10.25$, the occurrence rate increases monotonically with sSFR. These patterns reveal a complicated dependence of AGN activity on galaxy properties for theoretical models to explain.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis on the kinematics and physical properties of the ionized gas in the lensed galaxy RXCJ2248-ID at z=6.1 based on high-resolution JWST NIRSpec/IFU data in combination with ALMA observations. Our analysis reveals a high electron temperature ($T_e$$\sim$30000K) in the ionized gas, independent of the ionization level. We measure a wide range in the electron densities derived from [OIII]$\lambda$5008/[OIII]88$\mu$m and [ArIV]$\lambda$4713/[ArIV]$\lambda$4742 ratios (log($n_e$[cm$^{-3}$])$\sim$2.7-3.8), and previous values (log($n_e$[cm$^{-3}$])>4.8) based on high-ionization rest-UV emission lines. The ionized gas appears to be clumpy with a low filling factor ranging from about 10% to 0.2% for the low- and high-density clouds. In addition, we observe a very complex ISM kinematic structure, with the presence of two distinct broad and a very-broad components (FWHM$\sim$210 and $\sim$1000 kms$^{-1}$) in addition to the systemic one (FWHM$\sim$60 kms$^{-1}$) in [OIII]$\lambda$5008 and H$\alpha$. These broad components are heavily extinct (A$_V$$\sim$1.5 and 2.5, respectively), based on their Balmer decrements, while the gas associated to the narrow component is consistent with no extinction. The maximal velocities of these outflows ($\sim$115-500kms$^{-1}$) are such that a fraction of the total outflowing gas (0.16-2.1$\times$10$^7$M$_\odot$) could escape into the IGM. The rest of the gas will fall back to the central regions, being available for additional star formation episodes. The presence of dusty outflows and clumpy (i.e., low filling factor) ISM give support to the Attenuation-Free scenario proposed to explain the high-z UV-bright compact galaxies such as RXCJ2248-ID. On the other hand, the high densities in the ISM, together with the high SFR surface brightness, and the amount of returning outflowing mass give support to the Feedback-Free Starburst scenario.

 - **Abstract**
 Unstructured Voronoi mesh simulations offer many advantages for simulating self-gravitating gas dynamics on galactic scales. Adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) can be a powerful tool for simulating the details of star cluster formation and gas dispersal by stellar feedback. Zooming in from galactic to local scales using the star cluster formation simulation package Torch requires transferring simulation data from one scale to the other. Therefore, we introduce VorAMR, a novel computational tool that interpolates data from an unstructured Voronoi mesh to an AMR Cartesian grid. VorAMR is integrated into the Torch package, which integrates the FLASH AMR magnetohydrodynamics code into the Astrophysical Multipurpose Software Environment. VorAMR interpolates data from an AREPO simulation to a FLASH AMR grid using a nearest-neighbor particle scheme, which can then be evolved within the Torch package, representing the first ever transfer of data from a Voronoi mesh to an AMR Cartesian grid. Interpolation from one numerical representation to another results in an error of a few percent in global mass and energy conservation, which could be reduced with higher-order interpolation of the Voronoi cells. We show that the postinterpolation Torch simulation evolves without numerical abnormalities. A preliminary Torch simulation is evolved for 3.22 Myr and compared to the original AREPO simulation over the same time period. We observe similarly distributed star cluster formation between the two simulations. More compact clusters are produced in the Torch simulation as well as 2.3 times as much stellar material as in AREPO, likely due to the differences in resolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational lensing by galaxy clusters provides a powerful probe of the spatial distribution of dark matter and its microphysical properties. Strong and weak lensing constraints on the density profiles of subhalos and their truncation radii offer key diagnostics for distinguishing between collisionless cold dark matter (CDM) and self-interacting dark matter (SIDM). Notably, in the strongly collisional SIDM regime, subhalo core collapse and enhanced mass loss from ram-pressure stripping predict steeper central density slopes and more compact truncation radii--features that are directly testable with current lensing data. We analyze subhalo truncation in eight lensing clusters (Abell 2218, 383, 963, 209, 2390, and MACS J0416.1, J1206.2, J1149.6) that span the redshift range <$z_\text{spec}$>$ \simeq 0.17$-$0.54$ with virial masses $M_{200} \simeq0.41$-$2.2\times 10^{15}$ M$_\odot$ to constrain SIDM versus CDM. Our results indicate that the outer spatial extents of subhalos are statistically consistent with CDM, corroborated by redshift- and mass-matched analogs from the Illustris-TNG simulations. We conclude that the tidal radii of cluster galaxy subhalos serve as an important and complementary diagnostic of the nature of dark matter in these violent, dense environments.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational waves (GWs) from massive black hole (MBH) mergers will provide a novel way to probe the high-redshift universe and are key to understanding galactic dynamics and evolution. In this work, we analyze MBH mergers, their GW signals and detectability, as well as their population properties, using the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation - NINJA Simulation Suite. We discuss the effect of resolution and finite volume on the black hole mass function (BHMF), which in turn limits the mergers associated with low mass black holes, $M_{BH} \lesssim 10^{6.5} M_\odot$. We find the upper limit on the total mass of the MBH binaries detectable by LISA to be $\sim 10^{8.4} M_\odot$. We also find that adding time delays pertaining to dissipative processes like dynamical friction and stellar hardening during the final stages of the inspiral for which the simulation lacks sufficient resolution to model, considerably shifts the peak of redshift distribution of detectable binaries from $z\sim0.5$ to $z\sim0.1$. Time delays reduce the number of detectable GW events but on the other hand their signal-to-noise is increased. From the observational point of view, we find a strong correlation between the SFR and $L_{\rm bol}$ at high redshifts for the detectable LISA binaries. This may prove to be a future application in the coincident observation of MBH binaries by GW and electromagnetic observations.
