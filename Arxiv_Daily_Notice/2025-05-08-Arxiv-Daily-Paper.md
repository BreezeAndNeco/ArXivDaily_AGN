 - **Abstract**
 We present one of the largest uniform optical spectroscopic surveys of X-ray selected sources to date that were observed as a pilot study for the Black Hole Mapper (BHM) survey. The BHM program of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)-V is designed to provide optical spectra for hundreds of thousands of X-ray selected sources from the SRG/eROSITA all-sky survey. This significantly improves our ability to classify and characterise the physical properties of large statistical populations of X-ray emitting objects. Our sample consists of 13079 sources in the eROSITA eFEDS performance verification field, 12011 of which provide reliable redshifts from 0<z<5.8. The vast majority of these objects were detected as point-like sources (X-ray flux limit F(0.5-2 keV)>6.5x10^-15 erg/s/cm^2) and were observed for about 20 years with fibre-fed SDSS spectrographs. After including all available redshift information for the eFEDS sources from the dedicated SDSS-V plate programme and archival data, we visually inspected the SDSS optical spectra to verify the reliability of these redshift measurements and the performance of the SDSS pipeline. The visual inspection allowed us to recover reliable redshifts (for 99% of the spectra with a signal-to-noise ratio of >2) and to assign classes to the sources, and we confirm that the vast majority of our sample consists of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Only ~3% of the eFEDS/SDSS sources are Galactic objects. We also show the diversity of the optical spectra of the X-ray selected AGNs and provide spectral stacks with a high signal-to-noise ratio in various sub-samples with different redshift and optical broad-band colours. Our AGN sample contains optical spectra of (broad-line) quasars, narrow-line galaxies, and optically passive galaxies. It is considerably diverse in its colours and in its levels of nuclear obscuration.

 - **Abstract**
 The advent of JWST has opened new horizons in the study of quasar host galaxies during the reionization epoch ($z > 6$). Building upon our previous initial uncovering of stellar light from two quasar host galaxies at these redshifts, we now report the detection of the stellar light from the full Cycle 1 sample of 12 distant moderate-luminosity quasar ($M_{1450}>-24$ mag) host galaxies at $z>6$ from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP). Using JWST/NIRCam observations at 1.5 and 3.6 $\mu$m combined with 2D image decomposition analysis, we successfully detect the host galaxies in 11 out of 12 targets, underscoring the high detection rates achievable with moderate-luminosity quasars. Based on two-band photometry and SED fitting, we find that our host galaxies are massive with log~M$_*$/M$_{\odot} = 9.5\text{-}11.0$. The effective radii range from 0.6 to 3.2 kpc which is comparable to the sizes of inactive galaxies with similar masses as measured with imaging from COSMOS-Web. Intriguingly, the two quasar hosts with post-starburst features, which reside at the high-mass end of our sample and exhibit relatively compact morphologies, are consistent (at the 1-$\sigma$ level) with quiescent galaxies at $z\sim4\text{-}5$ in terms of their sizes and stellar mass surface densities. These findings support the so-called galaxy compaction scenario already being valid at the reionization epoch ($z>6$), in which gas inflows during starburst phases drive centrally concentrated star formation followed by rapid quenching, bridging the structural transition of massive galaxies from relatively extended star-forming disks to compact quiescent systems.

 - **Abstract**
 We present ALMA CO observations of the molecular gas in a sample of 41 luminous unobscured quasars at z $\sim$ 2 from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. 32 targets comprise the main sample observed in CO(3-2) and 9 targets have archival ALMA data of CO(3-2), CO(4-3) and CO(7-6). All quasars have rest-UV to optical spectra tracing ionised gas in the broad line region (e.g. CIV) and the narrow line region (e.g. [OIII]) and they cover the full range of outflow properties in the SDSS quasar population at these redshifts. 15 out of the 32 quasars in the main sample are detected in CO(3-2) and five out of the nine archival quasars are also detected in CO. The median gas mass for all 20 CO detected quasars is 8.0 $\pm$ 1.5 $\times$ 10$^9$ M$_{\odot}$ with a median M$_{dyn}$ of 1.4 $\pm$ 0.9 $\times$ 10$^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$. We find gas fractions in the range 0.02 - 0.32, which are generally lower than both inactive galaxies and obscured quasars at similar redshifts. We suggest an evolutionary trend in gas fractions of quasar host galaxies from obscured and gas rich to unobscured and gas poor. We note a tentative correlation between the gas fractions and the broad-line region properties with quasars showing high CIV blueshifts, indicating stronger broad-line region winds, having higher gas fractions. Six of the quasars corresponding to 15% of the sample also show evidence for at least one companion galaxy detected in CO at the same redshift.

 - **Abstract**
 The radiative transfer equation for spectral lines from an extended gas is derived from first principles, treating the gas as a system of many atoms/molecules rather than isolated ones. Line broadening effects are assumed to be dominated by particle motions (Doppler effect), but collisional broadening effects are included in the impact approximation. We retrieve the canonical radiative transfer equation under the condition that the optical depth over a coherence length, defined as the transition-levels lifetime times the speed of light, is much lower than unity. For other cases, the line radiative transfer equation contains a correction factor whose magnitude depends exponentially on the coherent optical depth. We compute that many-body effects affect line radiative transfer of strongly emitting and astronomically ubiquitous radio- and submillimter lines, such as the HI 21 cm line, and rotational transitions of the main isotopologue of CO. These results imply that care must be taken when interpreting observations relying on these lines, as many-body effects can significantly alter emergent line profiles and bias inferred physical conditions of the emitting gas.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Elusive intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs; $100~M_{\odot} \leq M_{\rm BH}\leq 2\times10^{5}~M_{\odot}$) can act as ``time-squeezing'' machines, enabling studies of AGN geometry through reverberation mapping (RM) on much shorter timescales than their supermassive siblings. Aims. The broad line region (BLR) radius constraints for IMBH candidates with different Eddington ratios probe the unexplored faint end of radius--luminosity ($R-L$) relations and allow us to build a robust $M_{\rm BH}$ estimator. This study aims to (a) confirm a rapidly accreting IMBH candidate; (b) demonstrate the feasibility of the first photometric BLR reverberation mapping (RM) campaign for this class of objects. Methods. The IMBH candidate J1448+16 was identified in the broad H$\alpha$-selected spectroscopic sample from SDSS. We carried out narrow-band H$\alpha$ and broad-band SDSS~g\'~monitoring to check small-scale variability and extract the time lag between the BLR and accretion disk (AD) continuum during 5 months (March--July 2024) using a 60-cm telescope at the Caucasus Mountain Observatory. Results. We confirmed the candidate as an active IMBH using XMM-Newton as a bright X-ray point source with the photon index $\Gamma = 2.32^{+0.15}_{-0.13}$, suggesting the high accretion rate. From a combination of SDSS optical spectra and XMM-Newton observations, we estimate the black hole mass in the range $\sim 0.9-2.4~\times10^{5} M_{\odot}$ and the Eddington rate from $\sim 37-112\%$. We report high-amplitude $\sim 60\%$ intra-night ($\sim 2$~h) H$\alpha$ variability in this highly accreting IMBH. In addition, we extracted a tentative measurement of a BLR RM radius $\sim 1-8~\mathrm{days}$. Conclusions. This work is a proof of concept for further IMBH variability studies and BLR RM campaigns, which will be essential for the calibration of the $R-L$ relation at the faint end.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of VLT/MUSE integral field spectroscopic observations of the Ly$\alpha\,$ emission nebulae associated with 11 high redshift ($z \geq 2.9$) radio galaxies (HzRGs) with DEC $<25^{\circ}$. When considering the other nine sources with available archival MUSE data, these observations increase the coverage to half of the currently known HzRGs. For two sources we are unable to confirm the original identification, as no Ly$\alpha\,$ emission was detected. We produce narrow band images centered on the Ly$\alpha\,$ line, extract their nuclear spectra, map their ionized gas kinematics, and derive the Ly$\alpha\,$ surface brightness profiles (SBPs). The SBPs are generally well reproduced by an exponential law with a typical scale length of $\sim 20-30$ ckpc. We measure emission line ratios finding most sources in agreement with an AGN origin for their gas ionization, with a single object hinting at strong star formation. Regarding the connection between the radio and ionized gas emission, we find that while the Ly$\alpha\,$ nebulae are preferentially aligned with the direction of the radio emission, there is no clear correlation in terms of size or gas kinematics, and only a weak trend connecting their radio and Ly$\alpha\,$ luminosities. The alignment is most likely the result of anisotropic nuclear emission rather than of a direct impact of the jets into the ionized gas.

 - **Abstract**
 Coronal rain, observed in 3D spine-fan magnetic configurations, results from thermal instability in the solar corona, where runaway in-situ cooling causes plasma to condense and drain along the magnetic lines. The reconnection of the magnetic field lines around the null point creates jets, seen as denser structures traveling along the field lines. As these dense regions evolve, thermal instability can set in and ultimately form coronal rain. In this paper we study the importance of partial ionization effects in the formation of coronal rain in the late evolution of 3D spine-fan magnetic reconnection in the solar corona. We use a two-fluid model consisting of neutral and charged particles coupled by collisions, where ionization recombination processes are taken into account. To trigger the thermal instability, we here investigate how magnetic reconnection generates flows that lead to the accumulation of higher-density structures along magnetic field lines. The dynamics associated with the spine-fan magnetic reconnection produces current sheets around the null point and flows along the field lines. Blobs similar to coronal rain start to appear after 400 seconds in the simulation domain which follow the field lines from the direction of the perturbed null point. The temperature drop is accompanied by recombination of charged particles. Recombination effects become important in coronal rain evolution when the temperature drops considerably in the condensed structures. The neutrals are slowed down by recombination, producing decoupling in velocity at the size of the blob, but inside the condensing structure, the neutrals can move faster across the field lines, creating small scale structures. This study presents a novel two-fluid approach to coronal rain, showing that incorporating two-fluid effects is essential for accurately capturing its dynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 In recent years, weak lensing shear catalogs have been released by various Stage-III weak lensing surveys including the Kilo-Degree Survey, the Dark Energy Survey, and the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program. These shear catalogs have undergone rigorous validation tests to ensure that the residual shear systematic effects in the catalogs are subdominant relative to the statistical uncertainties, such that the resulting cosmological constraints are unbiased. While there exists a generic set of tests that are designed to probe certain systematic effects, the implementations differ slightly across the individual surveys, making it difficult to make direct comparisons. In this paper, we use the TXPipe package to conduct a series of predefined diagnostic tests across three public shear catalogs -- the 1,000 deg$^2$ KiDS-1000 shear catalog, the Year 3 DES-Y3 shear catalog, and the Year 3 HSC-Y3 shear catalog. We attempt to reproduce the published results when possible and perform key tests uniformly across the surveys. While all surveys pass most of the null tests in this study, we find two tests where some of the surveys fail. Namely, we find that when measuring the tangential ellipticity around bright and faint star samples, KiDS-1000 fails depending on whether the samples are weighted, with a $\chi^2$/dof of 185.3/13 for faint stars. We also find that DES-Y3 and HSC-Y3 fail the $B$-mode test when estimated with the Hybrid-$E$/$B$ method, with a $\chi^2$/dof of 37.9/10 and 36.0/8 for the fourth and third autocorrelation bins. We assess the impacts on the $\Omega_{\rm m}$ - S$_{8}$ parameter space by comparing the posteriors of a simulated data vector with and without PSF contamination -- we find negligible effects in all cases. Finally, we propose strategies for performing these tests on future surveys such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time.

 - **Abstract**
 Striated granular edges observed in the solar photosphere represent one of the smallest-scale phenomena on the Sun. They arise from the interaction of strongly coupled hydrodynamic, magnetic, and radiative properties of the plasma. In particular, modulations in the photospheric magnetic field strength cause variations in density and opacity along the line of sight, leading to their formation. Therefore, the striation patterns can be used as valuable diagnostics for studying the finest-scale structure of the photospheric magnetic field. The Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope allows observations of the solar atmosphere with a spatial resolution of better than 0."03 with its current instrumentation. We analyze images acquired with the Visible Broadband Imager using the G-band channel to investigate the characteristics of fine-scale striations in the photosphere and compare them with state-of-the-art radiation-MHD simulations at similar spatial resolution. Both observed and synthetic images reveal photospheric striae with widths of approximately 20$-$50 km, suggesting that at least 4-meter class solar telescopes are necessary to resolve this ultrafine structure. Analysis of the numerical simulations confirms that the striation observed in the filtergrams is associated with spatial variations in photospheric magnetic flux concentrations, which cause shifts in the geometrical height where the emergent intensity forms. Some fine-scale striation in the synthetic images originate from magnetic field variations of approximately a hundred Gauss, resulting in a Wilson depressions as narrow as 10 km. This suggests that DKIST G-band images can trace footprints of magnetic field variations and Wilson depressions at a similar scale.

 - **Abstract**
 To aid the interpretation of observations of substellar atmospheres, Mukherjee et al. (2024) created the Sonora Elf Owl grid of model atmospheres, simulations that accounted for disequilibrium quench chemistry. However, Sonora Elf Owl did not accurately estimate CO$_2$ quenching because the models quenched the gas with respect to the full atmosphere equilibrium, but CO$_2$ should have instead been quenched with respect to the disequilibrium (i.e., quenched) abundance of CO. As a result, Sonora Elf Owl under-predicted the CO$_2$ abundance by several order of magnitude in some instances, an amount that JWST is sensitive to. Here, we release version two of the Sonora Elf Owl grid which has corrected CO$_2$ concentrations. Additionally, in version two we remove PH$_3$ as a spectral contributor since our spectra consistently contained too much PH$_3$ absorption. The new spectra can be found as an update to the original Zenodo postings.

 - **Abstract**
 Based on the modern understanding of MHD turbulence theory, we propose a new method for measuring the spectral properties of magnetic turbulence by synchrotron polarization gradient analysis. Using synthetic polarization observational data, we first confirm the feasibility of the gradient technique to determine the scaling properties of magnetic turbulence. We then apply this technique to the Galactic plane survey data from the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) and obtain the power-law spectral feature of the Galactic magnetic turbulence of $E\propto k^{-10/3}$. Gradient techniques open up a new way to obtain spectral properties of magnetic turbulence from polarization observations, such as the Low-Frequency Array for Radio Astronomy (LOFAR), in the presence of low-frequency and strong Faraday depolarization.
#### Leptohadronic Multimessenger Modeling of Two High-redshift (z $>$ 1) Neutrino Emission Blazar Candidates

 - **Abstract**
 The blazars are one of the leading candidate sources of high-energy neutrinos. Recently, two blazars have been found to be temporally and spatially correlated with some IceCube high-energy neutrino events. The two blazars, GB6 J2113+1121 and NVSS J171822+423948, are Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs) with redshifts greater than unity. In particular, NVSS J171822+423948 has a redshift of 2.7, which provides an important probe for studying the radiation processes of jets from active galactic nuclei in the early universe. To better understand the physical origin of the IceCube neutrinos, we adopt the one-zone leptohadronic model to fit the multimessenger emission of GB6 J2113+1121 and NVSS J171822+423948 during their $\gamma$-ray flaring periods and then calculate the high-energy neutrino detection probability. The chance of detecting a single muon neutrino from these two sources is found to be $\sim 2\%$ and $0.8\%$, respectively. Although such detection rates are not high mainly because of their high redshifts, our investigation strongly suggests that these sources are efficient PeV neutrino emitters. Our results also indicate that electromagnetic cascades produced by hadronic processes contribute significantly to X-ray and $\gamma$-ray emissions. However, high-energy $\gamma$-rays can be severely absorbed by the soft photon field from the broad-line region (BLR), which weakens the correlation between $\gamma$-rays and neutrinos, while suggesting a stronger connection between X-rays and neutrinos. We predict that IceCube will continue to detect neutrinos from FSRQs with redshifts greater than 1 in the future.
#### The ALMA-ATOMS Survey: Exploring Protostellar Outflows in HC$_3$N

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first systematic study of bipolar outflows using HC$_3$N as a tracer in a sample of 146 massive star-forming regions from ALMA-ATOMS survey. Protostellar outflows arise at the initial stage of star formation as a consequence of active accretion. In general, these outflows play a pivotal role in regulating the star formation processes by injecting energetic material in the parent molecular clouds. In such process, lower velocity components of outflows contain a significant portion of the energy. However, extraction of those component is difficult as the corresponding gas is often mixed with that of the ambient cloud. In our sample, we identified 44 bipolar outflows and one explosive outflow in HC$_3$N (J=11--10). The host clumps of these outflows are found to be at different evolutionary stages, suggesting that outflows in HC$_3$N are detectable in different stages of star formation. Also, the non-correlation of HC$_3$N outflows with clump evolutionary stages suggests that HC$_3$N is an unbiased tracer of outflows. Analyses revealed that HC$_3$N performs slightly better in detecting low-velocity components of outflows than traditionally employed tracers like SiO. The derived outflow parameters (i.e outflow mass, momentum, and energy) show moderate correlations with clump mass and luminosity. Our analysis of outflow opening angles and position-velocity diagrams across the outflow lobes show that, HC$_3$N is not only a good tracer of low-velocity outflows, but can also detect high-velocity collimated outflows. Overall, this study indicates that HC$_3$N can be used as a complementary outflow tracer along with the traditionally known outflow tracers, particularly in the detection of the low-velocity components of outflows.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetars are very rare astrophysical objects, with $\sim$31 known to date. They are best understood as highly magnetised neutron stars, but a greater number need to be found to constrain their role in stellar evolution pathways. We apply a novel approach for the detection of fast, transient X-ray sources, using a revised version of the EPIC XMM-Newton Outburst Detector (EXOD) with the aim of detecting and identifying new and rare variable compact objects. We detect a transient, variable source notable for its strong variability and hard spectrum. The emission from 4XMM J175136.8-275858 is well characterised by a blackbody, with temperatures between $\sim$1.8--5\,keV during its lower luminosity phase. Its temperature is poorly constrained during its brightest phase, and we observe an increase in luminosity by two orders of magnitude over timescales of a few ks. This is driven by increased emission of X-rays at energies above 2\,keV, with a luminosity decay potentially over weeks or months. Derived luminosities for 4XJ1751-2759 range up to $\sim10^{35} \text{\,erg s}^{-1}$ at 8\,kpc at the Galactic centre, but neutral hydrogen column densities are greater than predicted Galactic values possibly implying a greater distance to the source, still within our galaxy, further increasing its luminosity. A consideration of optical and IR information in combination with the X-ray observations allow us to exclude the possibility that 4XJ1751-2759 is a star, rotationally powered pulsar or supergiant fast X-ray transient. This rapid, hard, variability is closest to that of outbursts in magnetars than any other known class of X-ray transient.

 - **Abstract**
 The MAMMOTH-MOSFIRE program is a deep Keck MOSFIRE K-band spectroscopic follow-up of emission-line galaxies identified in the MAMMOTH-Grism HST WFC3/G141 slitless spectroscopic survey, targeting the core regions of three most massive galaxy protoclusters at cosmic noon. To introduce this program, we present a comprehensive analysis of the emission-line diagnostics for a unique sample of 43 protocluster member galaxies at $z\sim2$, investigating the impact of the overdense environment on their interstellar medium conditions. We characterize their ionization and excitation state using the $\rm [N\,II]\lambda$6584, $\rm [S\,II]\lambda\lambda$6717,6731, and $\rm [O\,I]\lambda$6300 BPT diagrams, from a full suite of rest-frame optical emission lines jointly covered by Keck MOSFIRE and HST G141 spectroscopy. Our analysis reveals a median electron density of $n_{\rm e}\approx290~{\rm cm}^{-3}$ from $\rm [S\,II]$ doublets, consistent with measurements from field galaxies at similar redshifts. Like their field counterparts at $z\sim2$, protocluster galaxies exhibit a systematic offset in the N2 BPT diagram compared to the local star-forming sequence, but no offset in the S2 BPT diagram. Notably, we find significantly enhanced $\rm [O\,I]/H{\alpha}$ ratios, which can be well explained by photoionization models incorporating both $\rm H\,II$ regions and shock excitation. This work highlights the powerful synergy between high-resolution Keck MOSFIRE K-band spectroscopy and HST G141 slitless spectroscopy, enabling comprehensive coverage of the rest-frame optical spectra of galaxies at $z\sim2$.

 - **Abstract**
 We examine the optical counterparts of the 1829 neutral hydrogen (HI) detections in three pilot fields in the Widefield ASKAP L-band Legacy All-sky Blind surveY (WALLABY) using data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Legacy Imaging Surveys DR10. We find that 17 per cent (315) of the detections are optically low surface brightness galaxies (LSBGs; mean $g$-band surface brightness within 1 $ R_e$ of $> 23$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$) and 3 per cent (55) are optically 'dark'. We find that the gas-rich WALLABY LSBGs have low star formation efficiencies, and have stellar masses spanning five orders of magnitude, which highlights the diversity of properties across our sample. 75 per cent of the LSBGs and all of the dark HI sources had not been catalogued prior to WALLABY. We examine the optically dark sample of the WALLABY pilot survey to verify the fidelity of the catalogue and investigate the implications for the full survey for identifying dark HI sources. We assess the HI detections without optical counterparts and identify 38 which pass further reliability tests. Of these, we find that 13 show signatures of tidal interactions. The remaining 25 detections have no obvious tidal origin, so are candidates for isolated galaxies with high HI masses, but low stellar masses and star-formation rates. Deeper HI and optical follow-up observations are required to verify the true nature of these dark sources.

 We review our current knowledge of thermal and viscous instabilities in accretion discs around compact objects. We begin with classical disc models based on analytic viscosity prescriptions, discussing physical uncertainties and exploring time-dependent solutions of disc evolution. We also review the ionization instability responsible for outbursting dwarf nova and X-ray binary systems, including some detailed comparisons between alpha-based models and the observed characteristics of these systems. We then review modern theoretical work based on ideas around angular momentum transport mediated by magnetic fields, focusing in particular on knowledge gained through local and global computer simulations of MHD processes in discs. We discuss how MHD may alter our understanding of outbursts in white dwarf and X-ray binary systems. Finally, we turn to the putative thermal/viscous instabilities that were predicted to exist in the inner, radiation pressure-dominated regions of black hole and neutron star discs, in apparent contradiction to the observed stability of the high/soft state in black hole X-ray binaries.

 - **Abstract**
 HD 209458 b is the first exoplanet on which an atmosphere was detected. Since then, its atmosphere has been investigated using multiple telescopes and instruments. However, many of its atmospheric constraints remain debatable. While HST observations suggested a highly sub-solar metallicity, recent JWST NIRCam observations by Xue et al. 2024 constrained a super-solar metallicity with highly sub-solar C/O. In this work, we show a detailed investigation of HD 209458 b transmission spectra observations from JWST and HST using SANSAR, a newly developed planetary atmosphere modeling framework, with free, equilibrium chemistry and self-consistent grid retrievals. The overall best-fitting model with free retrievals ($\chi^2_{\rm{red}}$=1.21) constrains its metallicity and C/O to be highly sub-solar, while equilibrium chemistry and grid retrievals ($\chi^2_{\rm{red}}$=1.27 and 1.30, respectively) are consistent with solar values using STIS+WFC3+NIRCam observations. The retrieved abundances of H$_2$O and CO$_2$ are almost three orders of magnitude lower (highly sub-solar) with STIS+WFC3+NIRCam compared to just NIRCam, using free retrievals. NIRCam observations alone also result in misleading constraints on metallicity and C/O, with equilibrium chemistry and grid retrieval. We find that the model choice of varying C/H or O/H to vary the C/O in equilibrium chemistry retrievals leads to different metallicity constraints with NIRCam, but similar constraints with STIS+WFC3+NIRCam. We conclude that NIRCam observations alone can lead to overestimation of abundances for exoplanet atmospheres and, therefore, should be used in combination with UV/Optical and near-infrared observations to obtain robust constraints on abundances, C/O, and metallicity. Specifically, even though we can detect the CO$_2$ feature with just NIRCam, we cannot constrain its abundances robustly without the optical baseline.

 - **Abstract**
 PSR J0901$-$4046, a likely radio-loud neutron star with a period of 75.88 seconds, challenges conventional models of neutron star radio emission. Here, we showcase results from 46 hours of follow-up observations of PSR J0901$-$4046 using the MeerKAT, Murriyang, GMRT, and MWA radio telescopes. We demonstrate the intriguing stability of the source's timing solution over more than three years, leading to an RMS arrival-time uncertainty of just $\sim$10$^{-4}$ of the rotation period. Furthermore, non-detection below 500 MHz may indicate a low-frequency turnover in the source's spectrum, while no secular decline in the flux density of the source over time, as was apparent from previous observations, has been observed. Using high time-resolution MeerKAT data, we demonstrate two distinct quasi-periodic oscillation modes present in single pulses, with characteristic time scales of 73 ms and 21 ms. We also observe a statistically significant change in the relative prevalence of distinct pulse morphologies compared to previous observations, possibly indicating a shift in the magnetospheric composition over time. Finally, we show that the W$_{50}$ pulse width is nearly constant from 544-4032 MHz, consistent with zero radius-to-frequency mapping. The very short duty cycle ($\sim$1.4$^{\circ}$) is more similar to radio pulsars with periods $>$5 seconds than to radio-loud magnetars. This, along with the lack of magnetar-like outbursts or timing glitches, complicates the identification of the source with ultra-long period magnetar models.
#### Probabilistic Zeeman-Doppler imaging of stellar magnetic fields: I. Analysis of tau Scorpii in the weak-field limit

 - **Abstract**
 Zeeman-Doppler imaging (ZDI) is used to study the surface magnetic field topology of stars, based on high-resolution spectropolarimetric time series observations. Multiple ZDI inversions have been conducted for the early B-type star tau Sco, which has been found to exhibit a weak but complex non-dipolar surface magnetic field. The classical ZDI framework suffers from a significant limitation in that it provides little to no reliable uncertainty quantification for the reconstructed magnetic field maps, with essentially all published results being confined to point estimates. To fill this gap, we propose a Bayesian framework for probabilistic ZDI. Here, the proposed framework is demonstrated on tau Sco in the weak-field limit. We propose three distinct statistical models, and use archival ESPaDOnS high-resolution Stokes V observations to carry out the probabilistic magnetic inversion in closed form. The surface magnetic field is parameterised by a high-dimensional spherical-harmonic expansion. By comparing three different prior distributions over the latent variables in the spherical-harmonic decomposition, our results showcase the ZDI sensitivity to various hyperparameters. The mean magnetic field maps are qualitatively similar to previously published point estimates, but analysis of the magnetic energy distribution indicates high uncertainty and higher energy content at low angular degrees l. Our results effectively demonstrate that, for stars in the weak-field regime, reliable uncertainty quantification of recovered magnetic field maps can be obtained in closed form with natural assumptions on the statistical model. Future work will explore extending this framework beyond the weak-field approximation and incorporating prior uncertainty over multiple stellar parameters in more complex magnetic inversion problems.

 - **Abstract**
 We have performed an extensive statistical investigation of how interplanetary fast forward shocks affect certain turbulence parameters, namely, the cross-helicity, $\sigma_c$, residual energy, $\sigma_r$, and magnetic helicity, $\sigma_m$. A total of 371 shocks detected by Wind at 1 au and seven shocks by Solar Orbiter at 0.3-0.5 au have been analysed. We explore how the aforementioned turbulence parameters and their variation across the shock depend on shock characteristics including the gas compression ratio, upstream plasma beta, velocity jump and shock angle. In the shock vicinity, fluctuations tend on average to show antisunward imbalance (measured as $\sigma_c>0$ when rectified to the Parker spiral direction), a dominance of magnetic energy ($\sigma_r<0$) and zero $\sigma_m$, all being typical solar wind properties . Antisunward imbalance and equipartition ($\sigma_r \sim0$) in the upstream is increasingly prevalent with increasing shock velocity jump and decreasing upstream beta and shock angle. Shocks with large velocity jumps and gas compression ratios have considerably more balanced ($\sigma_c\sim0$) and more magnetically dominated fluctuations downstream than upstream. From upstream to downstream, we also find that the occurrence of time periods fulfilling strict criteria for Alfvénic fluctuations (AFs) usually decreases, while those meeting the criteria for small-scale flux ropes (SFRs) increases. The occurrence of AF periods peaks for quasi-parallel shocks with large velocity jumps and small upstream beta. The occurrence of SFRs increases with increasing gas compression ratio and upstream beta. The shocks observed by Solar Orbiter below 0.5 au display similar distributions of turbulence parameters and upstream-to-downstream changes to those detected at 1 au. These results are relevant for understanding turbulence and charged-particle acceleration at collisionless shocks.

 - **Abstract**
 In the standard 2D model of eruption, the eruption of a magnetic flux rope is associated with magnetic reconnection occurring beneath it. However, in 3D, additional reconnection geometries are possible, in particular the AR-RF, where external reconnection involving the overlying arcades (A) and erupting flux rope (R) turns into another arcade and a flare loop (F). This process results in the drifting of the legs of the erupting flux rope. We investigated spectroscopic signatures of such AR-RF reconnection occurring in an erupting filament reconnecting with coronal arcades during a two-ribbon flare. The evolution of the erupting filament eruption is examined using observations by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) and the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS). As the filament rises into the corona, it reconnects with the surrounding arcade of coronal loops with localized brightenings, resulting in the disappearance of the coronal loops and formation of a hot flux rope, showing slipping motion of its footpoints extending to the previous footpoints of the coronal loops (AR-RF reconnection) as predicted by the 3D extensions to the Standard solar flare model. These brightenings are accompanied by the presence of strong blue-shifts in both the IRIS Si IV and Mg II lines, upto about 200 km/s. The lines are also extremely wide, with non-thermal widths above 100 km/s. Furthermore, a strongly non-Gaussian profile of the most blue-shifted component is detected at the start of the AR-RF reconnection, indicating the presence of accelerated particles and MHD turbulence, and associated with the appearance of hot plasma in the AIA 94 A passband. For the first time, an observation has been reported in which the IRIS slit successfully captures AR-RF reconnection between a filament and overlying arcades, resulting in strong blue-shifts and very broad line profiles.

 - **Abstract**
 From a series of 5 GHz VLBA radio observations taken over 1-yr span, we present the detection of compact highly-polarized radio emission from the T6 brown dwarf WISE J112254.72+255022.2 compatible with electron cyclotron maser emission. Both the total and polarized lightcurves show variability in correspondence with a rotation period of 1.95+/-0.03 hr. Comparison with models indicates that the quasi-steady radio emission of this brown dwarf is produced in circumpolar auroral rings, with remarkable similarity to the main-oval auroras in Jupiter. We have detected a large 100% polarized flare in one of the VLBA epochs (2022.82) which may imply the existence of active longitudes in the auroral rings with a non-axisymmetric beaming cone radiation pattern, similar to the dusk/dawn asymmetries seen in the Jovian radio emissions. We also present a high-precision astrometric analysis of the sky motion of WISE J112254.72+255022.2, resulting in revised values of proper motion and parallax with an improvement in precision of one order of magnitude. The common kinematics of WISE J112254.72+255022.2 with its wide companion, the M-dwarf LHS 302, is confirmed with submilliarcsecond precision, suggesting that this brown dwarf may have formed by gravitational fragmentation of the outer part of a protostellar disc around LHS 302. The astrometric analysis imposes very tight bounds to the presence of low-mass companions around WISE J112254.72+255022.2, ruling out objects more massive than Saturn. Our results strengthen the analogy between radio emitting brown dwarfs and the magnetized planets of our solar system.

 - **Abstract**
 Dwarf galaxies serve as powerful laboratories for investigating the underlying physics of galaxy evolution including the impact of baryonic feedback processes and environmental influences. We compare the visual and structural properties of dwarf galaxies in ultra-deep HSC-SSP imaging of the COSMOS field with those measured from realistic HSC-like synthetic observations of dwarfs generated by the Illustris TNG50 and NewHorizon simulations. Using Sérsic profile fitting and non-parametric morphological metrics (Gini, $M_{20}$, asymmetry, and concentration), we evaluate the diversity of structural properties in observed and simulated galaxies. Our analysis shows that NewHorizon and TNG50 galaxies lie at opposite extremes of observed structural trends: NewHorizon produces diffuse, extended galaxies with shallow Sérsic indices, while TNG50 yields compact, concentrated systems with steep indices. Both simulations reproduce observed structural trends more closely at higher stellar masses ($M_{\star}\sim10^{9.5} {\rm M_{\odot}}$) but fail to capture the full diversity of COSMOS dwarfs at lower masses. Non-parametric metrics further show that NewHorizon galaxies exhibit more uneven, clumpy light distributions while TNG50 galaxies have smoother but excessively concentrated profiles. These structural differences reflect underlying differences in their physical prescriptions and are likely driven by differing approaches to ISM physics, supernova feedback and star formation in addition to differences in numerical resolution. Our findings highlight the unique power of low-mass galaxies to constrain differences in simulation physics, especially star formation and feedback. Upcoming surveys from facilities like the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and Euclid will enable more rigorous comparisons with simulations, offering deeper insights into the physical processes shaping galaxy evolution.
#### Quantifying Suppression of Solar Surface Magnetic Flux Advection with Increasing Field Strength

 - **Abstract**
 One of the main theories for heating of the solar corona is based on the idea that solar convection shuffles and tangles magnetic field lines to make many small-scale current sheets that, via reconnection, heat coronal loops. Tiwari et al 2017 present evidence that, besides depending on loop length and other factors, the brightness of a coronal loop depends on the field strength in the loop feet and the freedom of convection in the feet. While it is known that strong solar magnetic fields suppress convection, the decrease in the speed of horizontal advection of magnetic flux with increasing field strength has not been quantified before. We quantify that trend by analyzing 24hours of HMI SHARP vector magnetograms of each of six sunspot active regions and their surroundings. Using Fourier Local Correlation Tracking, we estimate the horizontal advection speed of the magnetic flux at each pixel in which the vertical component of the magnetic field strength (Bz) is well above (greater than or equal to 150 G) noise level. We find that the average horizontal advection speed of magnetic flux steadily decreases as Bz increases, from 110 pm 3 meters per sec for 150 G (in network and plage) to 10 pm 4 meters per sec for 2500 G (in sunspot umbra). The trend is well fit by a fourth degree polynomial. These results quantitatively confirm the expectation that magnetic flux advection is suppressed by increasing magnetic field strength. The presented quantitative relation should be useful for future MHD simulations of coronal heating.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Several instances of low frequency Quasi-Periodic Oscillations (QPOs) have been reported in ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs), including three in pulsating ones (PULXs) to date. The nature of many ULXs is still unclear, as are the detailed properties of accretion in PULXs. Aims. We seek an answer to questions such as: Is there a QPO model that fits the data? Can mHz QPOs be used to constrain the magnetic field and accretion rate of the neutron stars in PULXs? Are all the low frequency QPOs in ULXs a manifestation of the same phenomenon? Methods. We apply Dong Lai's precession model to the PULX data, with the magnetic threading of the accretion disk constrained by recent simulations. Results. Based on the magnetic precession model, and on recent progress in understanding the inner structure of accretion disks, we predict an inverse scaling of QPO frequency with the neutron star period in PULXs. The theoretical curve is largely independent of the stellar magnetic field or mass accretion rate and agrees with the data for the known QPOs in PULXs. The flat-top QPOs detected in ULXs have observational properties that seem to be very different from the QPOs detected in PULXs, indicating they might have a different origin.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar populations serve as a fossil record of galaxy formation and evolution, providing crucial information about the history of star formation and galaxy evolution. The color-magnitude diagram (CMD) stands out as the most accurate tool currently available for inferring the star formation histories (SFHs) of nearby galaxies with stellar-resolved multiband data. The launch of new space telescopes, including JWST, EUCLID, and the upcoming CSST and Roman, will significantly increase the number of stellar-resolved galaxies over the next decade. A user-friendly and customizable CMD fitting package would be valuable for galaxy evolution studies with these data. We develop an open-source Python-based package named \textsc{pancake}, which is fast and accurate in determining SFHs and stellar population parameters in nearby galaxies. We have validated our method via a series of comprehensive tests. First, \textsc{pancake} performs well on mock data, meanwhile the random and systematic uncertainties are quantified. Second, \textsc{pancake} performs well on observational data containing a star cluster and 38 dwarf galaxies (50 fields). Third, the star formation rate (SFR) from \textsc{pancake} is consistent with the SFR from FUV photometry. To ensure compatibility and accuracy, we have included isochrone libraries generated using PARSEC for most of the optical and near-infrared filters used in space telescopes such as HST, JWST, and the upcoming CSST.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) exhibit scintillation and scattering, often attributed to interactions with plasma screens in the Milky Way and the host galaxy. When these two screens appear "point-like" to each other, two scales of scintillation can be observed with sufficient frequency resolution. A screen perceives a second screen as extended or resolved when the angular size of the latter is smaller than the angular resolution of the former. We define the ratio of these two as the Resolution Power (RP). Previous observational studies have argued that, in the resolving regime, scintillations disappear, assuming that a screen resolving another screen is equivalent to a screen resolving an incoherent emission region. In this theoretical and simulation-based study of resolving effects in two-screen scenarios, we argue that resolving quenches only the relatively broad-scale scintillation and that this quenching is a gradual process. We present qualitative and quantitative predictions for dynamic spectra, spectral autocorrelation functions (ACF), and modulation indices in resolved and unresolved regimes of two-screen systems. We show that the spectral ACF of a two-screen system has a product term in addition to the sum of individual screen contributions, causing the total modulation index to rise to \sqrt(3) in the unresolved regime. To aid in discovering resolving systems, we also present observable trends in multi-frequency observations of a screen resolving another screen or incoherent emission. Additionally we introduce a new formula to estimate the distance between the FRB and the screen in its host galaxy. We also show that this formula, like previous ones in the literature, is only applicable to screens that are two-dimensional in the plane of the sky.

 - **Abstract**
 We present CAPERS-LRD-z9, a little red dot (LRD) which we confirm to be a $z=9.288$ broad-line AGN (BLAGN). First identified as a high-redshift LRD candidate from PRIMER NIRCam photometry, follow-up NIRSpec/PRISM spectroscopy of CAPERS-LRD-z9 from the CANDELS-Area Prism Epoch of Reionization Survey (CAPERS) has revealed a broad $3500$ km s$^{-1}$ H$\beta$ emission line and narrow [O III]$\lambda\lambda4959,5007$ lines, indicative of a BLAGN. Based on the broad H$\beta$ line, we compute a canonical black-hole mass of $\log(M_{\textrm{BH}}/M_{\odot})=7.58\pm0.15$, although full consideration of systematic uncertainties yields a conservative range of $6.65<\log(M_{\textrm{BH}}/M_{\odot})<8.50$. These observations suggest that either a massive black hole seed, or a lighter stellar remnant seed undergoing periods of super-Eddington accretion, is necessary to grow such a massive black hole in $\lesssim500$ Myr of cosmic time. CAPERS-LRD-z9 exhibits a strong Balmer break, consistent with a central AGN surrounded by dense ($\sim 10^{10}\textrm{ cm}^{-3}$) neutral gas. We model CAPERS-LRD-z9 using CLOUDY to fit the emission red-ward of the Balmer break with a dense gas-enshrouded AGN, and bagpipes to fit the rest-ultraviolet emission as a host-galaxy stellar population. This upper limit on the stellar mass of the host galaxy ($<10^9\,{\rm M_\odot}$) implies that the black-hole to stellar mass ratio may be extremely large, possibly $>5\%$ (although systematic uncertainties on the black-hole mass prevent strong conclusions). However, the shape of the UV continuum differs from typical high-redshift star-forming galaxies, indicating that this UV emission may also be of AGN origin, and hence the true stellar mass of the host may be still lower.

 - **Abstract**
 We present ultraviolet (UV) through near-infrared (NIR) photometric and spectroscopic observations of the nearby SN 2024pxl, the third Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) in NGC 6384. SN 2024pxl is a Type Iax supernova (SN Iax) with an intermediate luminosity ($M_r = -16.99\pm0.32$ mag) and an average SN Iax light curve decline rate. SN 2024pxl was discovered $\sim$3 days after first light, and the rising light curve follows a single power law that is inconsistent with significant interaction with a companion star or circumstellar material. Our extensive NIR photometric coverage is comparable to that of the well-observed SNe Iax 2005hk and 2012Z, and we demonstrate that the $J-H$ colors of SNe Iax differ from normal SNe Ia and appear to be more homogeneous as a class. Spectroscopically, we report the earliest-ever NIR spectrum of a SN Iax as measured from maximum light ($t\approx-9$ days): a featureless continuum with similarities to a $\sim$9,000 K blackbody, and the line velocities are consistent with a mixed-ejecta structure, with C, Si, and Fe having similar velocities and velocity evolutions. We find a tentative correlation between the $H$-band break Co II velocity $\sim$20 days post-peak and absolute magnitude, with more luminous SNe Iax showing faster Co II velocities. Our observations suggest that SN 2024pxl resulted from the thermonuclear disruption of a CO white dwarf star that undergoes deflagration burning.
