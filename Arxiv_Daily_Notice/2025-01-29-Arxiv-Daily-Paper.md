 - **Abstract**
 The bursty, time-variable nature of star formation in the first billion years, as revealed by JWST, drives phases of temporary quiescence in low-mass galaxies that quench after starbursts. These galaxies provide unique probes of the burstiness of early star formation and its underlying physical processes. Using the SERRA cosmological zoom-in simulations, we analyze over 200 galaxies with $M_\star<10^{9.5}\rm M_\odot$ at $z\sim 6-8$, finding that most experience quiescent phases driven by stellar feedback, with minimal influence from environmental effects. The fraction of temporarily quiescent galaxies increases with decreasing mass and luminosity, representing the dominant population at $M_\star<10^8\rm M_\odot$ and $M_{UV}>-17$. By forward modeling their spectral energy distributions, we show that they are faint ($\langle M_{UV}\rangle = -15.6$ for $M_\star=10^{8}\rm M_\odot$), have strong Balmer breaks ($> 0.5$) and no emission lines. Comparing our predicted fractions with JWST results, we find similar luminosity-dependent trends; however, the observed fractions of temporarily quiescent galaxies at $M_{UV}\sim-20$ to $-19$ are higher, suggesting that stronger feedback or additional mechanisms beyond supernovae may be at play. We propose searching for F200W drop-outs and satellites in the proximity ($<5^{\prime\prime}$) of massive ($>10^{10}\rm M_\odot$) galaxies as effective strategies to uncover the hidden majority of faint ($M_{UV}>-17$), temporarily quiescent systems, crucial for constraining early feedback processes in low-mass galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of galaxy clusters, the most massive bounded structures in the universe, is crucial for cosmological analysis. Weak lensing signals allow us to track the distribution of all (dark and baryonic) matter regardless of its observable electromagnetic properties. Upcoming wide-field surveys like Euclid and LSST-Rubin will provide enhanced shape measurements of billions of background galaxies, presenting an unparalleled opportunity to detect galaxy clusters on a vast cosmic scale. The immense data volume generated by these surveys will require efficient and accurate analysis techniques. In this work, we introduce AMICO-WL, an extension of the optimal filtering algorithm implemented in AMICO, a well-tested code developed for optical cluster detection. AMICO-WL implements a specific linear optimal matched filter for weak lensing data in the AMICO infrastructure, using parallelisation and adding an efficient signal-to-noise ratio thresholding approach to set a desired sample purity and a cleaning procedure to deal with blended detections. The algorithm has been tested on a 25 deg$^2$ field of Euclid-like mock galaxy catalogue with the simulated shear signal produced using DUSTGRAIN-$pathfinder$ past-light-cones. We implemented a foreground removal procedure based on different cuts of low redshift galaxies from the input catalogue. To evaluate the performance of the method, we used an efficient matching procedure based on the 'blinking' of the simulation's individual redshift lensing planes. Cross-matching the AMICO-WL detections with the dark matter halo sample in the simulation having $M_{200} > 5 \times 10^{13}$ $M_{\odot}/h$ and considering a purity level of $\sim70\%$, the application of the foreground removal doubles the completeness from $6.5\%$ to $13.0\%$ and at the same time produces a significant decrease of spurious detections.

 - **Abstract**
 Common signal-processing approximations produce artefacts when timing pulsars in relativistic binary systems, especially edge-on systems with tight orbits, such as the Double Pulsar. In this paper, we use extensive simulations to explore various patterns that arise from the inaccuracies of approximations made when correcting dispersion and Shapiro delay. In a relativistic binary, the velocity of the pulsar projected onto the line-of-sight varies significantly on short time scales, causing rapid changes in the apparent pulsar spin frequency, which is used to convert dispersive delays to pulsar rotational phase shifts. A well-known example of the consequences of this effect is the artificial variation of dispersion measure (DM) with binary phase, first observed in the Double Pulsar 20 years ago. We show that ignoring the Doppler shift of the spin frequency when computing the dispersive phase shift exactly reproduces the shape and magnitude of the reported DM variations. We also simulate and study two additional effects of much smaller magnitude, which are caused by the assumption that the spin frequency used to correct dispersion is constant over the duration of the sub-integration and over the observed bandwidth. We show that failure to account for these two effects leads to orbital phase-dependent dispersive smearing that leads to apparent orbital DM variations. The functional form of the variation depends on the orbital eccentricity. In addition, we find that a polynomial approximation of the timing model is unable to accurately describe the Shapiro delay of edge-on systems with orbits less than 4 hours, which poses problems for the measurements of timing parameters, most notably the Shapiro delay. This will be a potential issue for sensitive facilities like the FAST and the forthcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA); therefore, a more accurate phase predictor is indispensable.

 - **Abstract**
 ALMA observations have shown that candidate "post-starburst" galaxies (PSBs) at z$\sim$0.6 can retain significant molecular gas reservoirs. These results would imply that -- unlike many model predictions -- galaxies can shut down their star formation before their cold gas reservoirs are depleted. However, these studies inferred star formation rates (SFRs) either from [O II] line fluxes or from spectral energy distribution modeling, and could have missed large dust-obscured contributions to the SFRs. In this study, we present Keck/NIRES observations of 13 massive ($\mathrm{M_*}\gtrsim \times 10^{11} \,\, \mathrm{M_\odot}$) PSBs, which allow us to estimate $\mathrm{H\alpha}$ SFRs in these gas-rich post-starburst galaxies. We confirm the previously inferred low SFRs for the majority of the sample: 11/13 targets show clear $\mathrm{H\alpha}$ absorption, with minimal infilling indicating dust-corrected SFRs of $<4.1 \,\mathrm{M_\odot\, yr^{-1}}$. These SFRs are notably low given the large $\mathrm{H_2}$ reservoirs ($\sim 1-5 \times 10^{10} \,\, \mathrm{M_\odot}$) present in 5/13 of these galaxies, placing them significantly offset from star-forming galaxies on the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation for star-forming galaxies. The [N II]/H$\alpha$ ratios of all 13 PSBs imply contributions from non-star-forming ionization mechanisms (e.g., AGN, shocks, or hot evolved stars) to their $\mathrm{H\alpha}$ emission, suggesting that even these low ongoing SFRs may be overestimated. These low $\mathrm{H\alpha}$ SFRs, dust-corrected using A$_v$ estimates from SED fitting, confirm that these galaxies are very likely quiescent and, thus, that galaxies can quench before their cold gas reservoirs are fully depleted.
#### Differential virial analysis: a new technique to determine the dynamical state of molecular clouds

 - **Abstract**
 Since molecular clouds form stars, at least some parts of them must be in a state of collapse. However, there is a long-standing debate as to whether that collapse is local, involving only a small fraction of the cloud mass, or global, with most mass in a state of collapse up to the moment when it is dispersed by stellar feedback. In principle it is possible to distinguish these possibilities from clouds' virial ratios, which should be a factor of two larger for collapse than for equilibrium, but systematic uncertainties have thus far prevented such measurements. Here we propose a new analysis method to overcome this limitation: while the absolute value of a cloud's virial ratio is too uncertain to distinguish global from local collapse, the differential change in virial ratio as a function of surface density is also diagnostic of clouds' dynamical state, and can be measured with far fewer systematic uncertainties. We demonstrate the basic principles of the method using simple analytic models of supported and collapsing clouds, validate it from full 3D simulations, and discuss possible challenges in applying the method to real data. We then provide a preliminary application of the technique to recent observations of the molecular clouds in Andromeda, showing that most of them are inconsistent with being in a state of global collapse.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. We use the Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS) Fourth Data Release (DR4) to identify and classify H$\alpha$-excess point sources in the Southern Sky, combining photometric data from 12 S-PLUS filters with machine learning to improve classification of H$\alpha$-related phenomena. Aims. Our goal is to classify H$\alpha$-excess point sources by distinguishing Galactic and extragalactic objects, particularly those with redshifted emission lines, and identifying variability phenomena like RR Lyrae stars. Methods. We selected H$\alpha$-excess candidates using the ($r - J0660$) vs. ($r - i$) colour-colour diagram from the S-PLUS main survey (MS) and Galactic Disk Survey (GDS). UMAP for dimensionality reduction and HDBSCAN clustering were used to separate source types. Infrared data was incorporated, and a Random Forest model was trained on clustering results to identify key colour features. New colour-colour diagrams from S-PLUS MS and infrared data offer a preliminary classification. Results. Combining multiwavelength data with machine learning significantly improved H$\alpha$-excess source classification. We identified 6956 sources with excess in the $J0660$ filter. Cross-matching with SIMBAD explored object types, including emission-line stars, young stellar objects, nebulae, stellar binaries, cataclysmic variables, QSOs, AGNs, and galaxies. Using S-PLUS colours and machine learning, we separated RR Lyrae stars from other sources. The separation of Galactic and extragalactic sources was clearer, but distinguishing cataclysmic variables from QSOs at certain redshifts remained challenging. Infrared data refined the classification, and the Random Forest model highlighted key colour features for future follow-up spectroscopy.
#### The S-PLUS 12-band photometry as a powerful tool for discovery and classification: ten cataclysmic variables in a proof-of-concept study

 - **Abstract**
 Multi-band photometric surveys provide a straightforward way to discover and classify astrophysical objects systematically, enabling the study of a large number of targets at relatively low cost. Here we introduce an alternative approach to select Accreting White Dwarf (AWD) candidates following their spectral energy distribution, entirely supported by the twelve photometric bands of the Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS). The method was validated with optical spectroscopic follow-up with the Gemini South telescope which unambiguously established ten systems as cataclysmic variables (CVs), alongside Swift X-ray observations of four of them. Among the ten CVs presented here are those that may be low-luminosity intermediate polars or WZ Sge-type dwarf novae with rare outbursts, two subclasses that can be easily missed in time-domain and X-ray surveys, the two methods currently dominating the discovery of new CVs. Our approach based on S-PLUS provides an important, complementary tool to uncover the total population of CVs and the complete set of its subclasses, which is an important step towards a full understanding of close binary evolution, including the origin of magnetic fields in white dwarfs and the physics of accretion. Finally, we highlight the potential of S-PLUS beyond AWDs, serving other surveys in the characterization of their sources.

 - **Abstract**
 In this manuscript, properties of spectroscopic continuum emissions are considered to detect potential tidal disruption event (TDE) candidates among SDSS quasars. After considering the simple blackbody photosphere model applied to describe quasar continuum emissions with parameters of blackbody temperature $T_{BB}$ and blackbody radius $R_{BB}$, SDSS quasars and reported optical TDEs occupy distinct regions in the space of $T_{BB}$ and $R_{BB}$. Then, through the dependence of $R_{BB}$ on $T_{BB}$ for SDSS quasars, 402 outliers in SDSS Stripe82 region can be collected. Among the 402 outliers, the SDSS J2308 at $z=1.16$ is mainly considered, due to its SDSS spectrum observed around the peak brightness of the light curves. With the 7.2-year-long light curves described by theoretical TDE model, the determined $T_{BB}$ and $R_{BB}$ through its spectroscopic continuum emissions are consistent with the TDE model determined values, to support the central TDE. Moreover, considering simulated results on continuum emissions of SDSS quasars around $z\sim1.16$, confidence level higher than 4$\sigma$ can be confirmed that the continuum emissions of SDSS J2308 are not related to normal quasars. Furthermore, accepted CAR process to simulate intrinsic AGN variability, the confidence level higher than $3\sigma$ can be confirmed that the long-term light curves of SDSS J2308 are related to a central TDE. Jointed the probabilities through both spectroscopic and photometric simulations, the confidence level higher than $5\sigma$ can be confirmed to support the central TDE in SDSS J2308.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the central density structure of dark matter halos in cold dark matter (CDM) and self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) models using simulations that are part of the Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE) project. For simulated halos of dwarf galaxy scale ($M_{\rm halo}(z=0)\approx 10^{10}\,M_\odot$), we study the central structure in both dissipationless simulations and simulations with full FIRE-2 galaxy formation physics. As has been demonstrated extensively in recent years, both baryonic feedback and self-interactions can convert central cusps into cores, with the former process doing so in a manner that depends sensitively on stellar mass at fixed $M_{\rm halo}$. Whether the two processes (baryonic feedback and self-interactions) are distinguishable, however, remains an open question. Here we demonstrate that, compared to feedback-induced cores, SIDM-induced cores transition more quickly from the central region of constant density to the falling density at larger radial scales. This result holds true even when including identical galaxy formation modeling in SIDM simulations as is used in CDM simulations, since self-interactions dominate over galaxy formation physics in establishing the central structure of SIDM halos in this mass regime. The change in density profile slope as a function of radius therefore holds the potential to discriminate between self-interactions and galaxy formation physics as the driver of core formation in dwarf galaxies.
#### Three Brown Dwarfs Masquerading as High-Redshift Galaxies in JWST Observations

 - **Abstract**
 We report the spectroscopic identification of three brown dwarf candidates -- o005_s41280, o006_s00089, and o006_s35616 -- discovered in the RUBIES using James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) PRISM/CLEAR spectroscopy. We fit these sources with multiple substellar atmosphere models and present the atmospheric parameters, including effective temperature ($T_\mathrm{eff}$), surface gravity, and other derived properties. The results suggest that o005_s41280 and o006_s35616, with $T_\mathrm{eff}$ in the ranges of 2100--2300 K and 1800--2000 K, are likely L dwarfs, while o006_s00089, with $T_\mathrm{eff} < 1000$ K, is consistent with a late T dwarf classification. The best-fit model spectra provide a reasonable match to the observed spectra. However, distinct residuals exist in the $Y$, $J$, and $H$ bands for the two L dwarf candidates, particularly for o006_s35616. Incorporating the extinction parameter into the fitting process can significantly reduce these residuals. The distance estimates indicate that these candidates are about 2 kpc away. The analysis of the color-color diagram using multiple JWST NIRcam photometry suggests that cooler T dwarfs, such as o006_s00089, overlap with little red dots (LRDs), while hotter L dwarfs, like o005_s41280 and o006_s35616, tend to contaminate the high-redshift galaxy cluster. These findings suggest a brown dwarf contamination rate of approximately 0.1% in extragalactic deep field surveys, with L dwarfs being more frequently detected than cooler T and Y dwarfs.
#### ATOMS: ALMA Three-millimeter Observations of massive Star-forming regions -XX. Probability distribution function of integrated intensity for dense molecular gas tracers

 - **Abstract**
 We report the observations of J=1-0 of HCN, HCO+, H13CO+, and H13CN, HC3N (J=11-10) emission towards 135 massive star-forming clumps, as part of the ATOMS (ALMA Three-millimeter Observations of Massive Star-forming regions) Survey. We present the integrated intensity probability distribution function for these molecular tracers, modeled as a combination of a log-normal distribution and a power-law tail. The molecular line luminosities for the power-law tail segment, Lmol(p), have been calculated. We have investigated the correlation between the bolometric luminosity, Lbol, and the power-law part of the molecular line luminosity, Lmol(p). Our findings suggest that the scaling relationships between Lbol and Lmol(p) for HCN and HCO+ are sublinear, indicating that these molecules might not be the most effective tracers for the dense gas. In contrast, H13CN and HC3N exhibit a nearly linear relationship between Lbol and Lmol(p), indicating that they can well trace gravitationally bound dense gas. The ratios of Lbol-to-Lmol(p), serving as indicators of star formation efficiency within massive star-forming clumps, exhibit a weak anti-correlation with the power-law index in the I-PDF. In addition, the star formation efficiency is also weakly anti-correlated with the exponent U of the corresponding equivalent density distribution. Our results implie that clumps with substantial gas accumulation may still display low star formation efficiencies.
#### BASS XLV: Quantifying AGN Selection Effects in the Chandra COSMOS-Legacy Survey with BASS

 - **Abstract**
 Deep extragalactic X-ray surveys, such as the Chandra COSMOS-Legacy field (CCLS), are prone to be biased against active galactic nuclei (AGN) with high column densities due to their lower count rates at a given luminosity. To quantify this selection effect, we forward model nearby ($z\sim0.05$) AGN from the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey (BASS) with well-characterized ($\gtrsim$1000 cts) broadband X-ray spectra (0.5-195 keV) to simulate the CCLS absorption distribution. We utilize the BASS low-redshift analogs with similar luminosities to the CCLS ($L_\mathrm{2-10\ keV}^\mathrm{int}\sim10^{42-45}\ \mathrm{erg}\ \mathrm{s}^{-1}$), which are much less affected by obscuration and low-count statistics, as the seed for our simulations, and follow the spectral fitting of the CCLS. Our simulations reveal that Chandra would fail to detect the majority (53.3%; 563/1056) of obscured ($N_\mathrm{H}>10^{22}\ \mathrm{cm}^{-2}$) simulated BASS AGN given the observed redshift and luminosity distribution of the CCLS. Even for detected sources with sufficient counts ($\geq30$) for spectral modeling, the level of obscuration is significantly overestimated. This bias is most extreme for objects whose best fit indicates a high-column density AGN ($N_\mathrm{H}\geq10^{24}\ \mathrm{cm}^{-2}$), since the majority (66.7%; 18/27) of these are actually unobscured sources ($N_\mathrm{H}<10^{22}\ \mathrm{cm}^{-2}$). This implies that previous studies may have significantly overestimated the increase in the obscured fraction with redshift and the fraction of luminous obscured AGN. Our findings highlight the importance of directly considering obscuration biases and forward modeling in X-ray surveys, as well as the need for higher-sensitivity X-ray missions such as the Advanced X-ray Imaging Satellite (AXIS), and the importance of multi-wavelength indicators to estimate obscuration in distant supermassive black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 The probability distribution, $p(\mathrm{DM})$ of cosmic dispersion measures (DM) measured in fast radio bursts (FRBs) encodes information about both cosmology and galaxy feedback. In this work, we study the effect of feedback parameters in the $p(\mathrm{DM})$ calculated from the full Latin Hypercube of parameters sampled by the CAMELS hydrodynamical simulation suite, building a neural network (NN) model that performs well in emulating the effect of feedback on $p(\mathrm{DM})$ at arbitrary redshifts at $z\leq1$. Using this NN model, we further study the parameter $F\equiv \sigma_{\rm DM} \, z^{1/2}$, which is commonly used to summarize the scatter on $p(\mathrm{DM})$. We find that $F$ does not depend monotonically on every feedback parameter; instead each feedback mechanism jointly influences the final feedback strength in non-trivial ways. Even the largest values of $F$ that we find in our entire parameter space are small compared to the current constraints from observed FRB DMs by Baptista et al. 2024, pointing at the limitations of the CAMELS suite due to the small simulation box sizes. In the future, with larger box-sizes from CAMELS-like suites, similar models can be used to constrain the parameters governing galaxy feedback in the increasing observational samples of FRBs.
#### NuSTAR detection of a hot stellar superflare with a temperature of 95 MK in hard X-rays

 - **Abstract**
 A search of the hard X-ray archive data of NuSTAR found a transient source, NuSTAR J230059+5857.4, during an observation of 1E 2259+586 on 2013 April 25. A multi-wavelength analysis using X-ray, optical, and IR data, mostly taken in its quiescent phase, was conducted to identify the origin of NuSTAR J230059+5857.4 and elucidate the phenomena associated with the flare activity. The results indicated that NuSTAR J230059+5857.4 was a stellar flare that occurred on a single M-dwarf, M-dwarf binary, or pre-main-sequence star. NuSTAR J230059+5857.4 exhibited the higher emission measure and higher temperature, 8.60+2.15/-1.73x10^54 cm^-3 and 8.21+2.71/-1.86 keV, respectively, on average than the nominal values of stellar flares reported in the past. The flare loop size estimated on the basis of the model to balance the plasma and magnetic pressures was larger than the stellar radius by a factor of several. Since based on solar flare loops, this flare loop scale is excessively large, we conjecture that the observed large emission measure is possible to be attributed to the observation of mutually-associated multiple flares simultaneously occurring on the stellar surface, known as sympathetic flares. Thanks to the large effective area of NuSTAR in the hard X-ray band, we can conduct detailed discussion about a temperature variation associated with the flare. Investigation of the temperature variation during the flare revealed that the temperature remained significantly higher than during the quiescent phase even after the count rate dropped to around 5% of the peak. The sustained high temperature over the long duration is consistent with the idea of sympathetic flares. We found that it is essential to use theoretical models to evaluate loops and assess temporal changes in temperature as done in this study to determine whether there are multiple flares or not when analyzing flare observation data.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a structural analysis of the young massive star cluster Westerlund 1 (Wd 1). With multi-epoch Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations, we measure the proper motions of $10346$ stars and determine their kinematic memberships by fitting a Gaussian mixture model to their proper motions. After correcting for extinction and completeness, we model the stellar density distribution and confirm the presence of an elongation with an eccentricity of $0.71$. The eccentricity decreases slightly with increasing mass. We fit the radial profile with the Elson, Fall, and Freeman model, observing a decrease in the core radius with increasing mass, indicative of weak but detectable mass segregation. This finding is further supported by a measured mass segregation ratio of $\Lambda_\mathrm{\rm MSR}=1.11\pm0.11$, only above $1$ by $1\sigma$, and slightly shorter minimum spanning tree length for higher mass bins. The cluster has a 1D velocity dispersion of $3.42 \pm 0.10~\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, suggesting it is subvirial. The subvirial state implies either exceptionally high star formation efficiency or inefficient stellar feedback caused by local gas expulsion before stars reach the cluster. The crossing time is $0.30$ Myr and the relaxation time is $0.26$ Gyr. Given the age of Wd 1 of $10.7$ Myr, we expect evident mass segregation for stars more massive than $10~M_\odot$, which accounts for the minor mass segregation found in the mass range of $1.00\unicode{x2013}12.14~M_\odot$ in this work. This suggests the overall mass segregation in Wd 1 is not primordial.

 - **Abstract**
 Global-scale inertial modes of oscillations have been recently observed on the Sun. They might play an important dynamic and diagnostic role for the Sun. This work aims to assess the validity of simplifying assumptions in the equation of continuity, which have often been used in the linear models of solar inertial modes. We compute the linear eigenmodes of the Sun's convection zone in the inertial frequency range using the Dedalus code. This single framework enables us to compare the sensitivity of the modes to different model setups, such as the compressible setup and the Boussinesq and anelastic approximations. We consider both the cases of uniform rotation and solar differential rotation (as given by helioseismology). We find that the compressible and anelastic models have almost identical eigenmodes under uniform rotation and solar differential rotation. On the other hand, the absence of density stratification in the Boussinesq model results in significantly different eigenmodes under these setups. The differences are most prominent for the non-toroidal modes with significant radial motions mainly due to the absence of the compressional $\beta$-effect. The anelastic approximation simplifies the calculations and reduces the numerical cost without affecting the solar inertial modes. The Boussinesq or incompressible approximations cannot be used to model the solar inertial modes accurately. Since the effects of differential rotation on the eigenmodes are very significant, an acceptable setup is to use the anelastic approximation together with the solar differential rotation.

 - **Abstract**
 DDO68-V1 is a Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) star in the eXtremely Metal-Poor (XMP) galaxy DDO68. It resides in the HII region with 12+log(O/H)~7.1 dex, or Z ~ Zo/40. Since DDO68-V1 is the only known LBV with a so low initial metallicity, its in-deep study can give the hints for understanding the LBV evolutionary stage and the nature of their powerful and highly variable mass loss in the very low-metallicity regime. Our goal is to study the optical variability of DDO68-V1 during the last 36 years, with the emphasis on the period of the last 8 years, after the LBV giant eruption. We use our published results of monitoring in B, V, R bands of the total flux of HII region 'Knot 3', containing the LBV, along with photometry of the archive Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images, obtained in May 2010 and December 2017. This data allow us to disentangle the variable light of DDO68-V1 and that of the underlying HII region. From all available photometry of Knot 3, we derive the V-band lightcurve of DDO68-V1 since 1988, with a higher cadence during the years 2015-2023, when the lightcurve resembles that of S Doradus. The new data reveal the full range of DDO68-V1 absolute magnitudes M_V of [-5.9, --10.8] mag. The LBV variations after the fading of the 'giant eruption' show the unusually large amplitude of delta_V > 3.0-3.5mag on the time-scale of ~1-1.5 year. The apparent changes of the integrated B-V colour of Knot 3 are consistent with the expected colour variations of the LBV in course of the S Doradus 'normal eruptions'. These data, along with spectra of DDO68-V1, demonstrate the need for a higher-cadence photometry of DDO68-V1, in order to probe the possible periodicity in its lightcurve and binarity of the object.

 - **Abstract**
 Star formation has often been studied by separating the low- and high-mass regimes with an approximate boundary at 8M_sun. While some of the outcomes of the star-formation process are different between the two regimes, it is less clear whether the physical processes leading to these outcomes are that different at all. Here, we systematically compare low- and high-mass star formation by reviewing the most important processes and quantities from an observational and theoretical point of view. We identify three regimes where processes are either similar, quantitatively or qualitatively different between low- and high-mass star formation. Similar characteristics can be identified for the turbulent gas properties and density structures of the star-forming regions. Many of the observational characteristics also do not depend that strongly on the environment. Quantitative differences can be found for outflow, infall and accretion rates as well as mean column and volume densities. Also the multiplicity significantly rises from low- to high-mass stars. The importance of the magnetic field for the formation processes appears still less well constrained. Qualitative differences between low- and high-mass star formation relate mainly to the radiative and ionizing feedback that occurs almost exclusively in regions forming high-mass stars. Nevertheless, accretion apparently can continue via disk structures in ionized accretion flows. Finally, we discuss to what extent a unified picture of star formation over all masses is possible and which issues need to be addressed in the future.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first polarimetric observations of a circumstellar disk in the far-infrared wavelength range. We report flux and linear polarization measurements of the young stellar object HL Tau in the bands A (53 $\mu$m), C (89 $\mu$m), D (155 $\mu$m), and E (216 $\mu$m) with SOFIA/HAWC+. The orientation of the polarization vectors is strongly wavelength-dependent and can be attributed to different wavelength-dependent polarization mechanisms in the disk and its local environment. In bands A, C, and D, the orientation of the polarization is roughly consistent with a value of 114° at the maximum emission. Hereby, the magnetic field direction is close to that of the spin axis of the disk. In contrast, in band E, the orientation is nearly parallel to the minor axis of the projection of the inclined disk. Based on a viscous accretion disk model combined with a surrounding envelope, we performed polarized three-dimensional Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations. In particular, we considered polarization due to emission and absorption by aligned dust grains, and polarization due to scattering of the thermal reemission (self-scattering). At wavelengths of 53 $\mu$m, 89 $\mu$m, and 155 $\mu$m, we were able to reproduce the observed orientation of the polarization vectors. Here, the origin of polarization is consistent with polarized emission by aligned non-spherical dust grains. In contrast, at a wavelength of 216 $\mu$m, the polarization pattern could not be fully matched, however, applying self-scattering and assuming dust grain radii up to 35 $\mu$m, we were able to reproduce the flip in the orientation of polarization. We conclude that the polarization is caused by dichroic emission of aligned dust grains in the envelope, while at longer wavelengths, the envelope becomes transparent and the polarization is dominated by self-scattering in the disk.

 - **Abstract**
 We examine the effects of a giant magnetized halo around the Galaxy on the angular distribution of the arriving ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECR) observed at Earth. We investigate three injection scenarios for UHECRs, and track them through isotropic turbulent magnetic fields of varying strengths in the Galactic halo. We calculate the resultant dipole and quadrupole amplitudes for the arriving UHECRs detected by an observer in the Galactic plane region. We find that, regardless of the injection scenario considered, when the scattering length of the particles is comparable to the size of the halo, the UHECRs skymap resembles a dipole. However, as the scattering length is increased, the dipolar moment always increases, and the quadrupolar moment increases rapidly for two of the three cases considered. Additionally, the quadrupole amplitude is highlighted to be a key discriminator in discerning the origin of the observed dipole. We conclude that, to understand the origin of the UHECR dipole, one has to measure the strength of the quadrupole amplitude as well.

 - **Abstract**
 The identification of Cosmic Ray (CR) sources represents one of the biggest and long-standing questions in astrophysics. Direct measurements of cosmic rays cannot provide directional information due to their deflection in (extra)galactic magnetic fields. Cosmic-ray interactions at the sources lead to the production of high-energy gamma rays and neutrinos, which, combined in the multimessenger picture, are the key to identifying the origins of CRs and estimating transport properties. While gamma-ray observations alone raise the question of whether their origin is hadronic or leptonic, the observation of high-energy neutrino emission directly points to the presence of CR hadrons. To identify the emission signatures from acceleration and transport effects a proper modeling of those interactions in a transport framework is needed. Significant work has been done to tune the production cross sections to accelerator data and different models exist that put the exact evolution of the Monte-Carlo generated showers into a statistical approach of a probabilistic description of the production of the final states of the showers relevant for astrophysical observations. In this work, we present the implementation of different hadronic interaction (HI) models into the publicly available transport code CRPropa. We apply different descriptions of the HI, trained on observational data in different energy regimes to a nearby, giant molecular cloud. In this case, the resulting gamma-ray flux can differ by a factor $\sim 2$ dependent on the choice of the HI model.

 - **Abstract**
 While cosmological simulations of galaxy formation have reached maturity, able to reproduce many fundamental galaxy and halo properties, no consensus has yet been reached on the impact of `baryonic feedback' on the non-linear matter power spectrum. This severely limits the precision of (and potentially biases) small-scale cosmological constraints obtained from weak lensing and galaxy surveys. Recent observational evidence indicates that `baryonic feedback' may be more extreme than commonly assumed in current cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. In this paper, we therefore explore a range of empirical AGN feedback models, within the FABLE simulation suite, with different parameterizations as a function of cosmic time, host halo properties, and/or spatial location where feedback energy is thermalized. We demonstrate that an AGN radio-mode feedback acting in a larger population of black holes, with jets thermalizing at relatively large cluster-centric distances, as exemplified by our XFABLE model, is in good agreement with the latest weak lensing + kSZ constraints across all k-scales. Furthermore, XFABLE maintains good agreement with the galaxy stellar mass function, gas fraction measurements, and all key galaxy group and cluster properties, including scaling relations and ICM radial profiles. Our work highlights the pressing need to model black hole accretion and feedback physics with a greater level of realism, including relativistic, magnetized jets in full cosmological simulations. Finally, we discuss how a range of complementary observational probes in the near future will enable us to constrain AGN feedback models, and therefore reduce `baryonic feedback' modelling uncertainty for the upcoming era of large cosmological surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 Extended very-high-energy $\gamma$-ray emission from middle-aged pulsars as revealed recently by several groundbased $\gamma$-ray experiments has strong implication on the transport of high-energy particles in the interstellar medium surrounding those pulsars. The $\gamma$-ray emission is widely believed to be produced by high-energy electrons and positrons accelerated by the pulsar wind nebulae when scattering off the interstellar radiation field via the inverse Compton process. Multiwavelength counterparts of the $\gamma$-ray halos are expected to be present, which are, however, not observed yet. In this work, we report for the first time the detection of extended X-ray emission from $\sim 0.2^{\circ}$ radius region of PSR B0656+14 with eROSITA. The spectrum of the emission can be described by a power-law function with an index of $\sim3.7$. The fluxes decrease with radius faster than the prediction of the particle diffusion and synchrotron radiation in a uniform magnetic field, suggesting the existence of a radial gradient of the magnetic field strength as $\sim r^{-1}$. The magnetic field strength in the X-ray emitting region is constrained to be $4-10~\mu$G.

 - **Abstract**
 We conduct the first systematic survey of a total of eleven optical coronal lines in the spectra of a large sample of low redshift (z < 0.8) Type 1 quasars observed by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We find that strong coronal line emission is rare in SDSS even in Type 1 quasars; only 885 out of 19,508 (4.5%) galaxies show at least one coronal line, with higher ionization potential lines ($>100$eV) being even rarer. The [Ne V] $\lambda$3426 line, which constitutes the majority of detections, is strongly correlated with the bolometric luminosity. These findings suggest that the optical coronal lines are significantly suppressed in the majority of local AGNs, possibly as a result of the presence of dust in the emitting regions. We find that the incidence of ionized outflows is significantly higher in coronal line emitters compared with non-coronal line emitters, possibly suggesting that dust destruction in outflows enhances coronal line emission in AGNs. Many coronal lines show line profiles that are broader than those of narrow lines, and are blue-shifted relative the lower ionization potential lines, suggesting outflows in the highly ionized gas. Given the limited number of detections, we do not find any statistically significant trends of detection statistics, or line ratios with black hole mass, Eddington ratio, or AGN bolometric luminosity. The catalog is publicly available and can provide a useful database of the coronal line properties of low redshift quasars that can be compared to the growing number of high-z AGNs discovered by JWST.

 - **Abstract**
 Bars are ubiquitously found in disc galaxies and are known to drive galaxy evolution through secular processes. However, the specific contribution of bars in suppression of star formation (SF) is still under inspection which we investigate in this paper using spatially resolved UV-optical colour maps & radial color profiles of a sample of 17 centrally quenched (CQ) barred galaxies in redshift range 0.02-0.06. The sample is selected based on their location in M$_{\ast}$ - SFR plane. They are classified as passive based on parameters from MPA-JHU VAC, but non-passive based on the GSWLC catalog, indicating a passive inner region & recent star formation in their extended disc. We use archival SDSS r-band and GALEX FUV & NUV imaging data and created spatially resolved (FUV-NUV vs NUV-r) colour maps to understand the nature of UV emission from different regions of these galaxies. We then analyse their NUV-r radial profiles using NUV-r colour as a proxy for stellar population (SP) age. A control sample of 8 CQ unbarred galaxies is also analysed to disentangle the effect of bulge and bar in quenching SF. The CQ barred galaxies display redder colors (NUV-r $>$ 4-4.5 mag) in inner regions, up to the length of the bar, indicating the age of stellar population in these regions to be older than $>$ 1 Gyr. Most barred galaxies in our sample host pseudo bulges and do not host AGN, emphasizing most probable reason for the internal quenching is action of stellar bar. In comparison to the unbarred, the barred galaxies show redder colors to a larger spatial extent. We conclude that bars in their later stages of evolution turn the inner regions of galaxies redder, leading to quenching, with the effect being most prominent up to the ends of the bar and creating a region dominated by older SP. This may occur when bars have already funneled gas to the galactic centre leaving behind no fuel for further SF.

 We provide a review of our current knowledge of galaxies throughout the first billion years of cosmic history. This field has undergone a transformation in the last two years following the launch of $\textit{JWST}$, and we aim to deliver an observational overview of what we have learned about $z\gtrsim 5$ galaxies. We introduce the latest selection methods of high redshift galaxies and describe new measurements of the census of continuum-selected and dusty star forming galaxies at $z\gtrsim 5$. We discuss new measurements of the UV luminosity function at $z\gtrsim 10$ and associated implications for early star formation. We then summarize what is being learned about the physical properties of early galaxies, with up-to-date discussions of the sizes, masses, ages, metallicities, abundance patterns, UV colors, dust properties, and ionizing sources in $z\gtrsim 5$ galaxies. We review observational evidence for bursty star formation histories and describe prospects for characterizing the duty cycle with future observations. We provide a brief overview of the insight being gained through new detections of AGN in early galaxies. Finally we introduce the latest constraints on the contribution of galaxies to reionziation and discuss how $\textit{JWST}$ measurements of Ly$\alpha$ emission offer the potential to probe the earliest stages of the process. This review is meant to provide a broad introduction to those new to the observational study of very high redshift galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 Close-by Earth analogs and super-Earths are of primary importance because they will be preferential targets for the next generation of direct imaging instruments. Bright and close-by G-to-M type stars are preferential targets in radial velocity surveys to find Earth analogs. We present an analysis of the RV data of the star HD 20794, a target whose planetary system has been extensively debated in the literature. The broad time span of the observations makes it possible to find planets with signal semi-amplitudes below 1 m/s in the habitable zone. We monitored the system with ESPRESSO. We joined ESPRESSO data with the HARPS data, including archival data and new measurements from a recent program. We applied the post-processing pipeline YARARA to HARPS data to correct systematics, improve the quality of RV measurements, and mitigate the impact of stellar activity. Results. We confirm the presence of three planets, with periods of 18.3142 +/- 0.0022 d, 89.68 +/- 0.10 d, and 647.6 +/- 2.6 d, along with masses of 2.15 +/- 0.17 MEarth, 2.98 +/- 0.29 MEarth, and 5.82 +/- 0.57 MEarth respectively. For the outer planet, we find an eccentricity of 0.45 +/- 0.10, whereas the inner planets are compatible with circular orbits. The latter is likely to be a rocky planet in the habitable zone of HD 20794. From the analysis of activity indicators, we find evidence of a magnetic cycle with a period around 3000 d, along with evidence pointing to a rotation period around 39 d. We have determined the presence of a system of three planets orbiting the solar-type star HD 20794. This star is bright (V=4.34 mag) and close (d = 6.04 pc), and HD 20794 d resides in the stellar habitable zone, making this system a high-priority target for future atmospheric characterization with direct imaging facilities.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar feedback is an essential step in the baryon cycle of galaxies, but it remains unconstrained beyond Cosmic Noon. We study the ionized gas kinematics, dynamical mass and gas-flow properties of a sample of 16 sub-$L^{\star}$ star-forming galaxies at $4\leq z\leq7.6$, using high-resolution JWST/NIRSpec observations. The emission lines are resolved, with velocity dispersions ($\sigma_{\rm gas}{\rm~(km~s^{-1})}\simeq38-96$) comparable to more massive galaxies at Cosmic Noon. From $\sigma_{\rm gas}$ and the galaxy size ($r_e=400-960~$pc), we estimate the dynamical mass to be $\log M_{\rm dyn}/M_{\odot}=9.25-10.25$. Stellar-to-dynamical mass ratios are low ($\log M_{\star}/M_{\rm dyn}\in[-0.5,-2]$) and decrease with increasing SFR surface density ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$). We estimate the gas surface densities assuming a star-formation law, but the gas masses do not balance the baryon-to-dynamical mass ratios, which would require a decrease in the star-formation efficiency. We find evidence of ionized outflows in five out of the sixteen galaxies, based on the need of broad components to reproduce the emission-line wings. We only observe outflows from galaxies undergoing recent bursts of star formation ${\rm SFR_{10}/SFR_{100}\geq1}$, with elevated $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ and low $M_{\star}/M_{\rm dyn}$. This links high gas surface densities to increased outflow incidence and lower $M_{\star}/M_{\rm dyn}$. With moderate outflow velocities ($v_{\rm flow}{\rm~(km~s^{-1})}=150-250$) and mass outflow rates ($\dot{M}_{\rm flow}/{\rm M_{\odot} yr^{-1}}=0.2-5$), these high-redshift galaxies appear more efficient at removing baryons than low-redshift galaxies with similar $M_{\star}$, showing mass loading-factors of $\dot{M}_{\rm flow}/{\rm SFR}=0.04-0.4$. For their given dynamical mass, the outflow velocities exceed the escape velocities, meaning that they may eventually enrich the Circumgalactic Medium.

 - **Abstract**
 Weak gravitational lensing perturbations have a non-negligible impact on strong lensing observables, and several degeneracies exist between the properties of the main lens, line of sight, and cosmology. In this work, we consider the impact of the line of sight on double-source-plane lenses (DSPLs), a rare class of lens systems in which two sources at different redshifts are lensed by the same foreground galaxy, and which enable competitive constraints on the dark energy equation of state. Generating and sampling statistically representative lines of sight from N-body simulations, we show that line-of-sight perturbations add a $\sim1\%$ uncertainty to measurements of the cosmological scaling factor $\eta$ (a ratio of angular diameter distance ratios), which is subdominant but non-negligible compared to the measurement error. We also show that the line-of-sight shear experienced by images of the two sources can differ significantly in both magnitude and direction. Including a line-of-sight error budget, we measure $w=-1.17^{+0.19}_{-0.21}$ from the Jackpot DSPL in combination with Planck. We show that the line of sight is expected to introduce an additional scatter in the constraints possible with a larger sample of DSPLs from Euclid, but that this scatter is subdominant compared to other sources of error.
