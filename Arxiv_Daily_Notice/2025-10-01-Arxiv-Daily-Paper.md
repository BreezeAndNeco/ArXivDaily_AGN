 - **Abstract**
 Stellar shells and streams are remnants of satellite galaxies visible around galaxies. Advances in low-surface-brightness observations and increasing resolution of cosmological simulations now allow investigating the properties and origin of these features. The metallicity, age, and velocity dispersion of shells and streams are investigated to infer their progenitor galaxies properties. We employed the hydrodynamical cosmological simulations Magneticum Pathfinder to extract these properties and identify the progenitors of the shells and streams. We compared to observational results from surveys and individual galaxies, matching and testing the methodology used in observations. Mock observations of shells and streams agree well with observational data regarding their morphology and spatial distribution. We find that both types of features are associated with localized depressions in stellar velocity dispersion compared to the surrounding regions. They are not as clearly distinct in metallicity and ages, though overall shells and more metal rich and streams are younger. We confirm results from idealized models that shells form commonly from radial major mergers but also through minor mergers, while streams usually form from minor mergers on circular orbits. We do not find the widths of streams to correlate with the half-mass radii of their progenitors, but the progenitors follow the mass-metallicity relation. On average, the masses measured for shells and streams approximately corresponds to 20% of the progenitor mass. We introduce a class of star-forming streams, which originate from in-situ star formation rather than the disruption of a satellite galaxy. Measuring stellar population properties of shells and streams provides the means to reconstruct the progenitor properties, and especially distinguish those streams that are not made through the disruption of a galaxy but formed in-situ.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the implementation and testing of a subgrid non-explosive pre-supernova (NEPS) feedback module for the COLIBRE model of galaxy formation. The NEPS module incorporates three key physical processes sourced by young, massive stars that act immediately following star formation: momentum injection from stellar winds and radiation pressure, and thermal energy from photoheating in HII regions. The age- and metallicity-dependent energy and momentum budgets are derived from BPASS stellar population models and are coupled self-consistently to the local gas properties. We test the model using a suite of smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of isolated, unstable gaseous disks at various numerical resolutions (gas particle masses in the range $10^4-10^6$ $\rm M_{\odot}$). We find that the NEPS module successfully regulates star formation by providing pressure support that prevents catastrophic gas collapse. This regulation improves the numerical convergence of star formation rates and disk structure. In our model, feedback from HII regions is the dominant regulatory mechanism. Furthermore, we demonstrate a crucial synergy with subsequent supernova feedback; NEPS feedback pre-processes the interstellar medium, creating a more homogeneous environment that moderates the effect of explosive feedback from supernova events. Our NEPS module thus provides a physically motivated and numerically robust framework that mitigates resolution-dependent artefacts and promotes self-regulated galaxy growth.

 - **Abstract**
 Shock fronts driven by active galactic nuclei in galaxy cluster cores represent a promising mechanism to heat the intracluster gas by converting kinetic energy into thermal energy through gas compression, thereby offsetting radiative cooling. Despite their potential importance, such shocks are challenging to detect, requiring deep X-ray exposures, and have only been identified in ten clusters. We present the first systematic detection and characterization of AGN-driven shocks in simulated clusters from the TNG-Cluster magnetohydrodynamic cosmological zoom-in simulations of galaxies. TNG-Cluster exhibits a rich variety of X-ray structures, including realistic populations of X-ray cavities, as well as shocks, produced by its AGN feedback model, without collimated, relativistic jets, nor cosmic rays. We produce mock Chandra observations with deep exposure times, for a sample of 100 clusters, mass-matched (M$_{500c}=1.2$ - $8.5 \times 10^{14}$ M$_\odot$) to the ten observed clusters with shocks. Using observational techniques, we identify shocks through surface brightness edges fitted with broken power laws and associated density and temperature jumps. We detect 50 shocks in 30 of the 100 clusters, with ~35% hosting multiple shocks. These shocks lie within a hundred kiloparsec of the central SMBH, are weak (Mach number < 2, median ~ 1.1), and are associated with cavities in about half of the cases. Both in observations and in TNG-Cluster, shocks tend to be located at larger radii than cavities, with median offsets of 46 and 27 kpc, respectively. The observationally inferred shock powers are comparable to the cluster cooling luminosities (10$^{44-46}$ erg s$^{-1}$), suggesting that shocks in the simulation are crucial heating mechanisms. Our results indicate that shocks play a role as important as cavities in balancing cooling in cluster cores, acting isotropically and up to larger distances.

 - **Abstract**
 In the past decade, Swift has performed several AGN high-cadence reverberation mapping campaigns, and generally found that the UV/optical interband lags are $\sim$3 times longer than predicted for a standard thin disk, thus coined "the accretion disk size problem". Here we present a systematic sample of Swift-monitored AGN. In this analysis, we confirm the accretion disk size problem, but find that the lag excess occurs only in the subset of obscured AGN, which show a significantly elevated mean normalization of $5.21 \pm 0.47$ ($p = 0.008$), whereas the unobscured AGN exhibit a mean excess consistent with standard disk predictions ($1.00 \pm 0.31$). Correlation and regression analyses similarly reveal X-ray column density as the strongest predictor of lag excess, explaining over 80% of its variance. We interpret these results as line-of-sight obscuration being linked to the too-long lags via additional reprocessed emission from the absorbing material itself. The consistency of lags in the unobscured subgroup with standard disk predictions suggests that the accretion disk size problem is not the result of shortcomings of standard accretion disk theory nor contamination by the broad-line region (BLR). X-ray to UV lag amplitudes and correlations show more complex and variable behavior in obscured AGN, suggesting that obscuration may disrupt or complicate the connection between high- and low-energy emission potentially through reprocessing, scattering, and/or ionization changes.

 - **Abstract**
 The hot gas in the outskirts of galaxy cluster-sized halos, extending around and beyond the virial radius into nearby accretion regions, remains among one of the least explored baryon components of large-scale cosmic structure. We present a stacking analysis of 680 galaxy clusters located in the western Galactic hemisphere, using data from the first two years of the SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey. The stacked X-ray surface brightness profile reveals a statistically significant signal extending out to 2r200m (~4.5 Mpc). The best-fit surface brightness profile is well described by a combination of terms describing orbiting and infalling gas, with a transition occurring around r200m. At this radius, the best-fit gas density is 2.5e-5 cm^-3, corresponding to a baryon overdensity of 30. By integrating the gas density profile out to r200m, we infer a gas fraction of 90% of the universal baryon fraction with the assumption of a typical halo concentration, indicating the completeness of the baryon budget within large radii. Additionally, we examine the hot gas distribution in massive clusters in the IllustrisTNG simulations from the halo center to the accretion region. This analysis reveals differences in radial gas profiles depending on whether the direction probes voids or nearby cosmic filaments. Beyond r200m, the density profile along the filament direction exceeds that along the void direction. This pattern aligns with the observed transition radius between the one-halo and two-halo terms, suggesting that r200m is the approximate radius marking the location at which cosmic filaments connect to galaxy clusters. Meanwhile, the comparisons of the gas density profile and gas fraction profile between the observation and the IllustrisTNG simulation suggest that the feedback processes in the stacking sample are more efficient than the IllustrisTNG model in distributing gas to large radii.

 - **Abstract**
 The accretion flow in AGN is not well understood, motivating intensive monitoring campaigns of multiwavelength variability to probe its structure. One of the best of these is the 3 year optical/UV/X-ray approximately daily monitoring campaign on Fairall\,9, a fairly typical moderate accretion rate AGN. The UV lightcurve shows a clear increase over $\sim 50$ days between years 1 and 2, strongly coherent with the X-ray lightcurve rise. This changes the average spectral energy distribution such that the disc component is stronger while the X-ray spectrum steepens, so that the total X-ray power remains roughly constant. Outside of this global change, we apply a Fourier resolved analysis to test stochastic models where intrinsic fluctuations in the UV disc propagate down into the hard X-ray emission region via both changing the seed photon flux for Compton scattering (short light travel timescale) and changing the electron density (longer propagation timescale). Unlike these models, the hard X-rays are not particularly well correlated with the UV, and also have the wrong sign in that the hard X-rays marginally lead the UV fluctuations. We show that this is instead consistent with uncorrelated stochastic fluctuations in both the UV (slow) and X-ray (fast), which are linked together only weakly via light travel time. These variability properties, as well as the changes in the SED, has implications for our understanding of AGN structure and physics, as well as future monitoring campaigns.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate how Milky Way-like environments influence the sizes and structural properties of low-mass galaxies by comparing satellites of Milky Way analogs from the Satellites Around Galactic Analogs (SAGA) Survey with two control samples: an environmentally agnostic population from the SAGA background (SAGAbg) sample and isolated galaxies from the SDSS NASA-Sloan Atlas. All sizes and structural parameters are measured uniformly using pysersic to ensure consistency across samples. We find the half-light sizes of SAGA satellites are systematically larger than those of isolated galaxies, with the magnitude of the offset ranging from 0.05 to 0.12 dex (10-24%) depending on the comparison sample and completeness cuts. This corresponds to physical size differences between 85-200 pc at 10^7.5 solar masses and 220-960 pc at 10^10 solar masses. This offset persists among star-forming galaxies, suggesting that environment can influence the structure of low-mass galaxies even before it impacts quenching. The intrinsic scatter in the size-mass relation is lower for SAGA satellites than isolated galaxies, and the Sérsic index distributions of satellites and isolated galaxies are similar. In comparison to star-forming satellites, quenched SAGA satellites have a slightly shallower size-mass relation and rounder morphologies at low-mass, suggesting that quenching is accompanied by structural transformation and that the processes responsible differ between low- and high-mass satellites. Our results show that environmental processes can imprint measurable structural differences on satellites in Milky Way-mass halos.
#### Supernovae Exploding within Dense Extended Material: Early Emission Regimes and Degeneracies in Parameter Inference from Observations

 - **Abstract**
 Early light curves of many core-collapse supernovae (SNe) are thought to be powered by the interaction of the shock wave with optically thick extended material, either a bound envelope or preexplosion ejected circumstellar matter (CSM). We analytically analyze the early emission produced by a shock with velocity $v$ traversing a material of mass $M_\mathrm{e}$ and opacity $\kappa$ extending to radius $R_\mathrm{e}$, and show the emission varies qualitatively with varying $\tau_\mathrm{e}=\kappa\!M_\mathrm{e}/(4\pi\!R_\mathrm{e}^2)$: For $\tau_\mathrm{e}\gg\!c/v$ a shock breakout occurs near $R_\mathrm{e}$ producing an ``edge breakout"- a UV-dominated breakout burst followed by ``cooling emission" of the shock-heated material; for $\tau_\mathrm{e}\lesssim\!c/v$ a ``wind breakout" occurs- the breakout pulse is prolonged and followed by extended emission shifting from UV to X-ray as the shock becomes collisionless. We derive the dependence on $\{v,\kappa,M_\mathrm{e},R_\mathrm{e}\}$ of the duration and luminosity characterizing the different emission phases, and show that current observations typically do not allow inference of all parameters. In particular, since the optical bands lie in the Rayleigh-Jeans tail of radiation emitted during the cooling phase, the observed cooling luminosity depends weakly on radius, $\propto\!R_\mathrm{e}^{1/4}$, leading to $1-2$ orders of magnitude uncertainty in its inferred value. This suggests, e.g., that the common day-scale light curve features in Stripped-Envelope SNe do not necessarily imply material extending to $R_\mathrm{e}\sim10^3\!R_\odot$ and are often consistent with low-mass $R_\mathrm{e}\sim\!10^2\!R_\odot$ bound envelopes. Early multiband coverage (especially in UV/X-ray) can break these degeneracies; the forthcoming \emph{ULTRASAT} UV mission will allow inferring the properties of extended material around the population of SNe progenitors.

 - **Abstract**
 Kinematic studies of young stars and star clusters have increased our understanding of the process of star formation and evolution in the Milky Way. FU Orionis objects are a specific class of young stellar object notable for their extremely high disk-to-star accretion rates. We use parallax and proper motion information from the Gaia astrometric survey to study five known FU Ori stars towards the Cygnus clouds, in the distance range ~500-900 parsecs, and seek evidence of their kinematic association with proximal stellar groups or clusters. We develop multiple search criteria within the Gaia datasets to look for nearby stellar aggregates and to reliably isolate their likely member stars. We show that V1057 Cygni and HBC 722 are kinematically consistent with the 3D locations as well as the inferred proper motion fields of the North America Nebula cluster. We show a similar association of V1515 Cygni with NGC 6914 in the Cygnus-X region, and of V2494 Cygni with stars in the dark cloud LDN 1003 and Braid Nebula. Further, we find that V1735 Cygni is consistent in both position and proper motion with the streamer structure of IC 5146, and we trace the streamer's similar proper motions to the main cluster. Color-magnitude diagrams of all identified clusters show the presence of pre-main-sequence populations, strengthening the likelihood of a physical association between the young FU Ori stars and their respective nearby clusters.
#### The Case for Space: Estimating Precise Time Delays from Ground- and Space-Based Observations of Lensed Supernovae with Glimpse

 - **Abstract**
 The delay in arrival time of the multiple images of gravitationally lensed supernovae (glSNe) can be related to the present-day expansion rate of the universe, $H_{0}$. Despite their rarity, Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (Rubin-LSST) is expected to discover tens of galaxy-scale glSNe per year, many of which will not be resolved due to their compact nature. Follow-up from ground- and space-based telescopes will be necessary to estimate time delays to sufficient precision for meaningful $H_{0}$ constraints. We present the Glimpse model (GausSN Light curve Inference of Magnifications and Phase Shifts, Extended) that estimates time delays with resolved and unresolved observations together for the first time, while simultaneously accounting for dust and microlensing effects. With this method, we explore best follow-up strategies for glSNe observed by Rubin-LSST. For unresolved systems on the dimmest end of detectability by Rubin-LSST, having peak i-band magnitudes of 22-24 mag, the time delays are measured to as low as 0.7 day uncertainty with 6-8 epochs of resolved space-based observations in each of 4-6 optical and NIR filters. For systems of similar brightness that are resolved by ground-based facilities, time delays are consistently constrained to 0.5-0.8 day precision with 6 epochs in 4 optical and NIR filters of space-based observations or 8 epochs in 4 optical filters of deep ground-based observations. This work improves on previous time-delay estimation methods and demonstrates that glSNe time delays of $\sim10-20$ days can be measured to sufficient precision for competitive $H_{0}$ estimates in the Rubin-LSST era.
#### The Stellar Mass and Age Distributions of Star-Forming Clumps at $0.5 < z < 5$ in JWST CANUCS: Implications for Clump Formation and Destruction

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the resolved properties of star-forming clumps and their host galaxies at $0.5<z<5$ in the JWST CANUCS fields. We find that the fraction of clumpy galaxies peaks near $z\sim2$ for galaxies with masses of $\log(M_{g,*}/M_\odot)\geq10$, while galaxies with masses of $8.5 \leq \log(M_{g,*}/M_\odot) < 10$ show lower clumpy fractions with little redshift evolution. We identify and measure individual clump masses, finding that the aggregated clump stellar mass function (cSMF) follows a power-law slope of $\alpha = -2$ across all redshift bins, broadly consistent with \textit{in-situ} clump formation. However, when split by galaxy masses, the cSMF is found to be flatter ($\alpha\sim-1.6$) for massive galaxies and steeper ($\alpha\sim-2.3$) for lower mass galaxies, with little redshift evolution in both cases. We explore how different formation mechanisms and disruptive processes affect the shape of the clump mass function. In particular, we find that the cSMF slope is flatter with increasing gas fractions in younger clump populations ($<300$ Myr old), suggesting that higher gas availability leads to more massive clumps forming at the time of formation. Alternatively, many high-redshift galaxies in the sample have disturbed morphologies and simulations show that clumps of \textit{ex-situ} origins can flatten the cSMF slope. We also investigate the evolution of clump populations, where we find the cSMF slope become flatter as clumps evolve and age. We interpret this as an indication of the long-term survivability of massive clumps, with feedback mechanisms preferentially disrupting low-mass clumps. Overall, the galaxy-mass dependent cSMF and age distribution point to a complex history for clumps, involving different and competing mechanisms for their formation and destruction.
#### Co-SOM: Co-training for photometric redshift estimation using Self-Organizing Maps

 - **Abstract**
 The upcoming galaxy large-scale surveys, such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), will generate photometry for billions of galaxies. The interpretation of large-scale weak lensing maps, as well as the estimation of galaxy clustering, requires reliable redshifts with high precision for multi-band photometry. However, obtaining spectroscopy for billions of galaxies is impractical and complex; therefore, having a sufficiently large number of galaxies with spectroscopic observations to train supervised algorithms for accurate redshift estimation is a significant challenge and an open research area. We propose a novel methodology called Co-SOM, based on Co-training and Self-Organizing Maps (SOM), integrating labeled (sources with spectroscopic redshifts) and unlabeled (sources with photometric observations only) data during the training process, through a selection method based on map topology (connectivity structure of the SOM lattice) to leverage the limited spectroscopy available for photo-z estimation. We utilized the magnitudes and colors of Sloan Digital Sky Survey data release 18 (SDSS-DR18) to analyze and evaluate the performance, varying the proportion of labeled data and adjusting the training parameters. For training sets of 1% of labeled data ($\approx 20{,}000$ galaxies) we achieved a performance of bias $\Delta z = 0.00007 \pm 0.00022$, precision $\sigma_{zp} = 0.00063 \pm 0.00032$, and outlier fraction $f_{\mathrm{out}} = 0.02083 \pm 0.00027$. Additionally, we conducted experiments varying the volume of labeled data, and the bias remains below $10^{-3}$, regardless of the size of the spectroscopic or photometric data. These low-redshift results demonstrate the potential of semi-supervised learning to address spectroscopic limitations in future photometric surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 Digital tracking detects faint solar system bodies by stacking many images along hypothesized orbits, revealing objects that are undetectable in every individual exposure. Previous searches have been restricted to small areas and short time baselines. We present a general framework to quantify both sensitivity and computational requirements for digital tracking of nonlinear motion across the full sky over multi-year baselines. We start from matched-filter stacking and derive how signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) degrades with trial orbit mismatch, which leads to a metric tensor on orbital parameter space. The metric defines local Euclidean coordinates in which SNR loss is isotropic, and a covariant density that specifies the exact number of trial orbits needed for a chosen SNR tolerance. We validate the approach with Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) data, recovering known objects in blind searches that stack thousands of images over six years along billions of trial orbits. We quantify ZTF's sensitivity to populations beyond 5 au and show that stacking reaches most of the remaining Planet 9 parameter space. The computational demands of all-sky, multi-year tracking are extreme, but we demonstrate that time segmentation and image blurring greatly reduce orbit density at modest sensitivity cost. Stacking effectively boosts medium-aperture surveys to the Rubin Observatory single-exposure depth across the northern sky. Digital tracking in dense Rubin observations of a 10 sq. deg field is tractable and could detect trans-Neptunian objects to 27th magnitude in a single night, with deep drilling fields reaching fainter still.

 - **Abstract**
 The surfaces of rotating stars serve as a window into their interiors, magnetic dynamos, and are important in other areas including exoplanet discovery and atmospheric characterization. While indirect techniques such as photometry and Doppler imaging have been studied for their ability to map stellar surfaces, the gold standard remains optical long-baseline interferometry. In this paper, we develop new closed-form solutions for the interferometric visibility of a rotating star with an arbitrary inhomogeneous surface. We introduce the concept of 'stellar rotation synthesis' in interferometry--an analog of Earth rotation synthesis--where stellar rotation adds information to the spherical harmonic modes representing the star's surface intensity. We implement these solutions in the open-source package harmonix, written in JAX with automatic differentiation, providing a rich ecosystem for fitting and inference. Inspired by similar studies for photometry and Doppler imaging, we use simulations of a fiducial star as observed by the CHARA Array and intensity interferometers to perform a comprehensive theoretical study of the information theory of the starspot mapping problem in interferometry. We show that adding simultaneous photometry from a space-based instrument such as TESS adds complementary spatial information to interferometry and can improve the precision on the map coefficients by over an order of magnitude, enabling the detailed mapping of nearby main-sequence stars with current facilities. Finally, we evaluate the performance of existing and proposed intensity interferometers for stellar surface mapping.
#### A Near-Infrared Extinction and Reddening Map Towards the Galactic Bulge Using UKIRT

 - **Abstract**
 The Galactic bulge is one of the most information-dense regions to study resolved stellar populations, variables, and transients, such as microlensing events. Studies toward the Galactic bulge are complicated by the large and variable extinction along the line of sight. We measure the near-infrared $A_{K_S}$ extinction and $E(H-K_S)$ reddening in this region using $H$- and $K$-band photometry obtained with the 2017 UKIRT microlensing survey. We fit the apparent magnitude and color distribution of bright giants in the bulge to recover the apparent magnitude and color of Red Clump stars, which are known to be standard candles and crayons. We present $2^\prime \times 2^\prime$ resolution maps in UKIRT fields between $-2.15^{\circ} \le l \le 2.71^{\circ}$ and $-2.69^{\circ} \le b \le 2.03^{\circ}$ of the $A_{K_S}$ extinction and the $E(H-K_S)$ reddening. We find large variations in the $K_S$-band extinction and $E(H-K_S)$ reddening on all the scales we probe. We find that a constant, standard extinction law is a poor representation of the relationship between the extinction and reddening we measure in fields of different latitudes. These maps will be useful for understanding the near-infrared extinction law for sight lines close to the Galactic plane, as well as for final field selection for the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey.

 Context: Solar flares accelerate electrons, creating non-thermal energy distributions. However, the acceleration sites and dominant acceleration mechanisms remain largely unknown. Aims: We study the characteristics of electron acceleration and subsequent non-thermal energy distribution in a 2D coronal plasmoid-mediated reconnecting current sheet. Methods: We used test particles and the guiding centre approximation to transport electrons in a static coronal 2D fan-spine topology magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) snapshot. The snapshot was from a Bifrost simulation that featured plasmoid-mediated reconnection at a current sheet. To sample initial particle conditions that lead to non-thermal energies, we used importance sampling. In this way, the characteristics of the non-thermal electrons were statistically representative of the MHD plasma. Results: The energy distribution of the electrons forms a non-thermal power law that varies with our tolerance of the guiding centre approximation's validity, from no obvious power law to a power law with an exponent of -4 (the power law also depends on the statistical weighing of the electrons). The non-thermal electrons gain energy through a gradual betatron acceleration close to magnetic null points associated with plasmoids. Conclusions: In this static, asymmetric, coronal, 2D fan-spine topology MHD configuration, non-thermal electron acceleration occurs only in the vicinity of null points associated with magnetic gradients and electric fields induced by plasmoid formation and ejection. However, the guiding centre approximation alone is not sufficient to properly estimate the shape of the non-thermal power law since, according to our results, electron acceleration is correlated with the adiabaticity of the particles' motion. The results also show that the particle power law formation is biased by the test particle sampling procedure.

 - **Abstract**
 We present \textit{JWST} NIRSpec and MIRI MRS observations of the central kiloparsec of M58 (NGC 4579), a nearby LINER galaxy hosting a low-luminosity AGN (LLAGN; $L_\mathrm{bol} \sim 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$) with a low-power jet. These data provide an unprecedented view of the warm molecular gas phase and reveal clear signatures of feedback. We detect 44 H$_2$ lines, including bright pure rotational lines (S(1)-S(18)) and rovibrational lines up to $\nu=2$, probing a wide range of excitation conditions. Excitation diagrams show that rotational lines follow a power-law temperature distribution with an exponential cutoff, consistent with heating by low-velocity shocks. H$_2$ rovibrational lines deviate from thermal models primarily because of sub-thermal excitation at low density. Additionally, there may be a 10% contribution by AGN X-ray heating in the nucleus. The dust lanes associated with the spiral inflow appear dynamically undisturbed but show signs of shock heating, while the inner $\sim$200 pc exhibits turbulent kinematics produced by outflowing molecular gas. These results reveal the subtle yet measurable impact of LLAGN feedback on the interstellar medium, demonstrating that even weak, vertically oriented jets and low radiative accretion rates can perturb molecular gas and regulate nuclear reservoirs. This study highlights JWST's transformative ability to uncover hidden modes of AGN feedback.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic fields influence the structure and evolution of protostellar systems, thus understanding their role is essential for probing the earliest stages of star formation. We present ALMA Band 3 and 6 polarized continuum observations at $\sim$0.5$^{\prime \prime}$ resolution toward the Class 0 protostellar system HH 211. Three dust filaments ($\sim$4000 au in length) are found in the HH 211 protostellar envelope, two of which are aligned with core-scale ($\sim$10,000 au) magnetic fields detected by previous JCMT observations. This result suggests that the formation of the dust filaments may be influenced by magnetic fields. In the inner envelope ($\sim$1000 au), we detect a clear hourglass-shaped magnetic field morphology near the protostar and toroidal fields along the outflow directions. We also estimate the line-of-sight-averaged temperature and column density distributions in the inner envelope and find that the temperature is higher in the east, while the column density is enhanced in the southern and western regions. The southern dense regions of the inner envelope may trace either outflow cavity walls, due to their alignment with the outflow, or possible infalling channels in the midplane, given the close correspondence between the observed magnetic fields and the predicted infall trajectories.

 - **Abstract**
 Polarization observations of the Milky Way and many other spiral galaxies have found a close correspondence between the orientation of spiral arms and magnetic field lines on scales of hundreds of parsecs. This paper presents polarization measurements at 214 $\mu$m toward ten filamentary candidate ``bones" in the Milky Way using the High-resolution Airborne Wide-band Camera (HAWC+) on the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA). These data were taken as part of the Filaments Extremely Long and Dark: A Magnetic Polarization Survey (FIELDMAPS) and represent the first study to resolve the magnetic field in spiral arms at parsec scales. We describe the complex yet well-defined polarization structure of all ten candidate bones, and we find a mean difference and standard deviation of $-74^{\circ} \pm 32^{\circ}$ between their filament axis and the plane-of-sky magnetic field, closer to a field perpendicular to their length rather than parallel. By contrast, the 850 $\mu$m polarization data from \textit{Planck} on scales greater than 10 pc show a nearly parallel mean difference of $3^{\circ} \pm 21^{\circ}$. These findings provide further evidence that magnetic fields can change orientation at the scale of dense molecular clouds, even along spiral arms. Finally, we use a power law to fit the dust polarization fraction as a function of total intensity on a cloud-by-cloud basis and find indices between $-0.6$ and $-0.9$, with a mean and standard deviation of $-0.7 \pm 0.1$. The polarization, dust temperature, and column density data presented in this work are publicly available online.

 - **Abstract**
 We present on results of a spatially resolved spectral analysis of G1.9+0.3, the youngest known supernova remnant in the Galaxy. The X-ray spectra are well described by synchrotron emission from a power-law electron distribution with an exponential cutoff. We found a cutoff energy $\epsilon_0 \sim 1 ~ \rm{keV}$ in both the radio bright rim and the X-ray bright rims. In the loss-limited case, the cutoff energy depends on the shock velocity $v_{\rm{sh}}$ and the Bohm factor $\eta$, following the relation $\epsilon_0 \propto v_{\rm{sh}}^2 \eta^{-1} $. Our analysis shows that $\eta$ ranges from 2 to 4 in the radio rim and from 12 to 15 in the X-ray rims. This suggests that the magnetic field in the radio rim is more turbulent than in the X-ray rims. The presence of CO clouds along the radio rim likely contributes to this difference. Interaction between the shock and these clouds can slow the shock down and generate turbulent eddies. The resulting turbulence eddies can amplify the magnetic field. We propose that the strong radio emission from the radio rim is primarily due to this amplified magnetic field. In contrast, a CO cloud located in the south-west appears to lie in the foreground, as indicated by its low turbulence and the absence of shock deceleration.

 - **Abstract**
 Stars captured by black holes (BHs) can be tore apart by strong tidal force, producing electromagnetic flares. Some 100 tidal disruption events (TDEs) have been observed, involving invariably normal gaseous stars whose debris falls onto the BH fueling the flares over years. White dwarfs (WDs)-the most prevalent compact stars a million times denser and thus tougher than gaseous stars-can only be disrupted by intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) of 10^2-10^5 solar masses. WD-TDEs are predicted to generate more powerful and short-lived flares, but their evidence has been lacking. Here we report observations of a fast, luminous X-ray transient EP250702a. Its one-day-long peak showed strong recurrent flares extending to several tens of MeV in gamma-rays, indicating relativistic jet emission. The jet X-rays dropped sharply from exceeding 3 x 10^49 to around 10^44 erg/s within 20 days. These characteristics are inconsistent with any known transient phenomena other than a jetted-TDE evolving within a short timespan previously unseen-indicating the disruption of a white dwarf by an IMBH. At late times, a new soft component progressively dominates the X-ray spectrum, exhibiting extreme super-Eddington luminosity, possibly from an accretion disc. WD-TDEs open a new window to study elusive IMBHs and the otherwise invisible interior of degenerate stars.

 - **Abstract**
 We consider a generalization of the classical nonrelativistic Störmer problem, describing the motion of charged particles in a purely magnetic dipole field, by taking into account the effects of the dissipation, assumed to be of friction type, proportional to the velocity of the particle, and of the presence of stochastic forces. In the presence of dissipative/stochastic effects, the motion of the particle in the magnetic dipole field can be described by a generalized Langevin type equation, which generalizes the standard Lorentz force equation. We perform a detailed numerical analysis of the dynamical behavior of the particles in a magnetic dipolar field in the presence of dissipative and stochastic forces, as well as of the electromagnetic radiation patterns emitted during the motion. The effects of the dissipation coefficient and of the stochastic force on the particle motion and on the emitted electromagnetic power are investigated, and thus a full description of the spectrum of the magnetic dipole type electromagnetic radiation and of the physical properties of the motion is also obtained. The power spectral density of the emitted electromagnetic power is also obtained for each case, and, for all considered Störmer type models, it shows the presence of peaks in the radiation spectrum, corresponding to certain intervals of the frequency.

 - **Abstract**
 The search for gamma-ray counterparts to gravitational-wave events with the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) requires accurate and robust background modeling. Previous CALET observing runs (O3 and O4) relied on averaged pre/post-event baselines or low-order polynomial fits, approaches that neglect correlated noise, temporal non-stationarity, and the propagation of background uncertainty into derived flux upper limits. These simplifications can lead to reduced sensitivity to faint or atypical transients. In this work, we present a novel Bayesian framework for background estimation based on Gaussian Process (GP) regression and change-point modeling. Our approach captures correlated structures in the detector background, quantifies predictive uncertainties, and propagates them into both detection statistics and Bayesian credible upper limits. We demonstrate, using archival CALET time-tagged event data and simulated signal injections, that our method improves sensitivity to weak short-duration bursts by up to an order of magnitude compared to traditional polynomial fits. This probabilistic background treatment enables a more physically robust interpretation of non-detections and offers a scalable, real-time compatible extension for future joint multi-messenger searches.

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) are astrophysical phenomena arising when stars are disrupted by supermassive black holes. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), with its unprecedented depth and cadence, will detect thousands of TDEs, motivating the need for robust photometric classifiers capable of efficiently distinguishing these events from other extragalactic transients. We aim to develop and validate a machine learning pipeline for photometric TDE identification in LSST-scale datasets. Our classifier is designed to provide high precision and recall, enabling the construction of reliable TDE catalogs for multi-messenger follow-up and statistical studies. Using the second Extended LSST Astronomical Time Series Classification Challenge (ELAsTiCC2) dataset, we fit Gaussian Processes (GP) to light curves for feature extraction (e.g., color, rise/fade times, GP length scales). We then train and tune boosted decision-tree models (XGBoost) with a custom scoring function emphasizing high-precision recovery of TDEs. Our pipeline is tested on a diverse simulation of transient and variable events, including supernovae, active galactic nuclei, and superluminous supernovae. We achieve high precision (up to 95%) while maintaining competitive recall (about 72%) for TDEs, with minimal contamination from non-TDE classes. Key predictive features include post-peak colors and GP hyperparameters, reflecting characteristic timescales and spectral behaviors of TDEs. Our photometric classifier provides a practical and scalable approach to identifying TDEs in forthcoming LSST data. By capturing essential color and temporal properties through GP-based feature extraction, it enables efficient construction of clean TDE candidate samples.

 - **Abstract**
 CSS100217 is considered a peculiar tidal disruption event (TDE) candidate occurring in an active galactic nucleus (AGN). Unlike typical TDEs, where the post-flare luminosity is equal to that pre-flare, CSS100217 decayed to $\sim$ 0.4 magnitudes fainter than its pre-flare V band level. In this manuscript, we propose an obscured TDE model to explain the light curve of CSS100217. Assuming that the time-dependent obscuration, caused by the TDE unbound stellar debris, or by nuclear clouds moving around the supermassive black hole (SMBH), follows a Weibull distribution, we find that the light curve of CSS100217 can be described by the tidal disruption of a $4.6_{-0.9}^{+0.9}{\rm M_\odot}$ main-sequence star by a $3.3_{-0.3}^{+0.3}\times10^7{\rm M_\odot}$ black hole. The total energy of the event derived from our fit is $7.23\times10^{53}$ ergs and about 1.38 ${\rm M_\odot}$ of debris mass is accreted by the central SMBH. The model indicates that the contribution of the host galaxy to the observed pre-flare optical luminosity is not-significant compared to that of the AGN, which is consistent with the results of the spectral analysis. These results suggest that obscuration may play an important role in explaining the unusual TDE-like variability observed in CSS100217.

 - **Abstract**
 Emission lines of FeI and NiI are commonly found in the coma of solar system comets, even at large heliocentric distances. These atoms are most likely released from the surface of the comet's nucleus or from a short-lived parent. The presence of these lines in cometary spectra is unexpected because the surface blackbody equilibrium temperature is too low to allow the sublimation of refractory minerals containing these metals. These lines were also found in the interstellar comet 2I/Borisov which has a NiI/FeI abundance ratio similar to that observed in solar system comets. On average, this ratio is one order of magnitude higher than the solar Ni/Fe abundance ratio. Here, we report observations of the new interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which were carried out with the ESO Very Large Telescope equipped with the UVES spectrograph. Spectra were obtained at six epochs, at heliocentric distances ranging from 3.14 to 2.14 au. NiI was detected at all epochs. FeI was only detected at heliocentric distances smaller than 2.64 au. We estimated the NiI and FeI production rates by comparing the observed line intensities with those produced by a fluorescence model. Comet 3I exhibits a high production rate of NiI atoms as well as a high NiI/FeI ratio, making it exceptional when compared to solar system comets and 2I/Borisov. Additionally, we found that the NiI/FeI ratio decreases rapidly with decreasing heliocentric distance, suggesting that comet 3I could soon become indistinguishable from solar system comets in this respect. We interpreted these observations assuming that the NiI and FeI atoms were released through the sublimation of Ni(CO)$_4$ and Fe(CO)$_5$ carbonyls, which supports the presence of these species in the cometary material.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the white dwarf (WD) cooling sequence of the Galactic Globular Cluster (GGC) NGC 2808 by using deep near-UV data from the Hubble Space Telescope and theoretical models, to investigate if this cluster hosts an excess of WDs. Excess in WDs is a rare phenomenon that has been found to exist only in a few GGCs. We compared star counts from different evolutionary phases on the near-UV color-magnitude diagram to evolutionary times predicted by BaSTI models. The investigation was carried out over a region within a radii of 1.5 $\arcmin$ of the cluster center and a region of similar dimension located 5$\arcmin$ away. We find a WD excess of $\approx$ 60 - 70\% when comparing star counts and evolutionary models of the WD cooling sequence to the main-sequence turn-off, and by using different values and fractions of Helium enhancement. This excess decreases to $\approx$ 30 - 40\% when the WD cooling sequence is compared to the horizontal branch. The WD excess is slightly larger in the internal field that covers the cluster center; however, the difference with the external field is compatible within the uncertainties. We argue that this excess is possibly related to the existence of SCWDs and Helium-core WDs in NGC~2808, and might be directly associated to the extended blue horizontal branch of this GGC.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent JWST/NIRSpec observations have revealed strong methane emission at 3.326 microns in the $\approx$482 K brown dwarf CWISEP J193518.59$-$154620.3 (W1935). Atmospheric modeling suggests the presence of a $\approx$300 K thermal inversion in its upper atmosphere, potentially driven by auroral activity. We present an extension of the retrieved spectra of W1935 with and without inversion spanning 1--20 microns, to identify thermal inversion-sensitive spectral features and explore the origin of the object's peculiar characteristics. Our analysis indicates that atmospheric heating contributes approximately 15% to the bolometric luminosity. The model with inversion predicts an additional similar-strength methane emission feature at 7.7 microns and tentative ammonia emission features in the mid-infrared. Wavelengths beyond $\sim$2 microns are significantly influenced by the inversion, except for the 4.1--5.0 microns CO$_2$ and CO features that originate from atmospheric layers deeper than the region where the inversion occurs. W1935 appears as an outlier in Spitzer/IRAC mid-infrared color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) based on the $m_{\rm Ch1}-m_{\rm Ch2}$ (IRAC 3.6 microns $-$ 4.5 microns) color, but exhibits average behavior in all other combinations that trace clear sequences. This anomaly is likely due to the Ch2 filter probing vertical mixing-sensitive CO$_2$ and CO features that do not correlate with temperature or spectral type. We find that the thermal inversion tends to produce bluer $m_{\rm Ch1}-m_{\rm Ch2}$ colors, so the overluminous and/or redder position of W1935 in diagrams involving this color cannot be explained by the thermal inversion. This analysis provides insights into the intriguing dispersion of cold brown dwarfs in mid-infrared CMDs and sheds light on their spectral diversity.
#### Double Power-law Electron Spectra in Solar Flares Due to Temperature Anisotropy Instabilities

 - **Abstract**
 Despite extensive observational and theoretical efforts, the physical processes responsible for shaping the diversity of accelerated electron spectra observed in solar flares remain poorly understood. We use 2D particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of magnetized plasmas subject to continuous shear-driven magnetic amplification to investigate whether electron temperature anisotropy instabilities in above-the-loop-top (ALT) regions can account for this diversity. We explore how the resulting spectra depend on key plasma parameters: the initial electron temperature $T_e$ and the initial ratio of electron cyclotron to plasma frequencies, $f_e = \omega_{ce}/\omega_{pe}$. In our simulations, the adiabatic evolution of the plasma generates electron temperature anisotropy with the electron temperature perpendicular to the magnetic field being larger than the parallel temperature. This eventually drives electromagnetic instabilities capable of scattering and accelerating electrons. The simulations consistently produce nonthermal tails in the electron spectra whose hardness increases with the initial value of $f_e$, while depending only weakly on $T_e$. For runs in which $f_e \lesssim 1.2$, the spectra exhibit double power-law shapes with downward (knee-like) breaks, and the electron scattering is dominated by OQES modes. In runs with $f_e\gtrsim 1.5$, PEMZ modes dominate and produce harder double power-law spectra with upward (elbow-like) breaks. Cases that include the $f_e\sim 1.2-1.5$ transition yield nearly single power-laws that end with bump-like breaks. Our results support the role of temperature anisotropy instabilities in accelerating electrons in ALT regions, offering a promising framework to help explain the wide range of nonthermal electron spectra reported in solar flare observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetoconvection at the solar surface governs the dynamics in the upper solar atmosphere and sustains the heliosphere. Properties of this fundamental process are poorly described near the solar poles. Here we report the first out-of-ecliptic remote-sensing observations of the south pole of the Sun from a high-latitude campaign of the Solar Orbiter spacecraft which reveal spatial and temporal evolution of supergranular convective cells. The supergranular cells have spatial scales of 20--40\,Mm. From eight days of observations starting on 2025 March 16, our analysis shows that the magnetic network migrates poleward, on average, at high latitudes (above 60\textdegree), with speeds in the range of 10--20\,m\,s$^{-1}$, depending on the structures being tracked. These results shed light on the buildup of the polar magnetic field that is central to our understanding of the solar cycle and the heliospheric magnetic field.

 - **Abstract**
 High-redshift (z > 2) massive quiescent (MQ) galaxies provide an opportunity to probe the key physical processes driving the fuelling and quenching of star formation in the early Universe. Observational evidence suggests a possible evolutionary link between MQs and dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs; or submillimetre galaxies), another extreme high-redshift population. However, galaxy formation models have historically struggled to reproduce these populations - especially simultaneously - limiting our understanding of their formation and connection, particularly in light of recent JWST findings. In previous work, we presented a re-calibrated version of the L-Galaxies semi-analytic model that provides an improved match to observationally-inferred number densities of both DSFG and MQ populations. In this work, we use this new model to investigate the progenitors of MQs at z > 2 and the physical mechanisms that lead to their quenching. We find that most MQs at z > 2 were sub-millimetre-bright ($S_{870}$ > 1 mJy) at some point in their cosmic past. The stellar mass of MQs is strongly correlated with the maximum submillimetre flux density attained over their history, and this relation appears to be independent of redshift. However, only a minority of high-redshift DSFGs evolve into MQs by z = 2. The key distinction between typical DSFGs and MQ progenitors lies in their merger histories: MQ progenitors experience an early major merger that triggers a brief, intense starburst and rapid black hole growth, depleting their cold gas reservoirs. In our model, AGN feedback subsequently prevents further gas cooling, resulting in quenching. In contrast, the broader DSFG population remains sub-millimetre-bright, with star formation proceeding primarily via secular processes, becoming quenched later.
