 - **Abstract**
 Polarized synchrotron emission from ultra-relativistic electrons spiraling the Galactic magnetic field has become one of the most relevant emissions in the Interstellar medium these last years due to the improvement in the quality of low-frequency observations. One of the recent experiments designed to explore this emission is the QUIJOTE experiment. We aim to study the spatial variations of the synchrotron emission in the QUIJOTE MFI data, by dividing the sky into physically separated regions. For such task, we firstly use a novel component separation method based on artificial neural networks to clean the synchrotron maps. After training the network with simulations, we fit both $EE$ and $BB$ spectra by assuming a power-law model. Then, we give estimations for the index $\alpha_{S}$, the amplitude, and the ratio between $B$ and $E$ amplitudes. When analyzing the real data, we found a clear spatial variation of the synchrotron properties along the sky at 11 GHz, obtaining a steeper index in the Galactic plane of $\alpha_{S}^{EE} = -3.1 \pm 0.3$ and $\alpha_{S}^{BB} = -3.1 \pm 0.4$ and a flatter one at high Galactic latitudes of $\alpha_{S}^{EE} = -3.05 \pm 0.2$ and $\alpha_{S}^{B} = -2.98 \pm 0.27$. We found average values at all sky of $\alpha_{S}^{EE} = -3.04 \pm 0.21$ and $\alpha_{S}^{BB} = -3.00 \pm 0.34$. Furthermore, after obtaining an average value of $A_{S}^{EE} = 3.31 \pm 0.08$ $\mu K^{2}$ and $A_{S}^{BB} = 0.93 \pm 0.02$ $\mu K^{2}$, we estimate a ratio between $B$ and $E$ amplitudes of $A_{S}^{BB}/A_{S}^{EE} = 0.28 \pm 0.08$. Based on the results we conclude that, although neural networks seem to be valuable methods to apply on real ISM observations, combined analyses with Planck, WMAP and/or CBASS data are mandatory to reduce the contamination from QUIJOTE maps and then improve the accuracy of the estimations.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a unified theoretical framework for induced (stimulated) scattering-parametric instabilities of electromagnetic waves, including induced Compton, stimulated Brillouin, and stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) in strongly magnetized electron-positron pair plasma. By solving the dispersion relations derived from kinetic theory, taking into account the ponderomotive force due to the beat of incident and scattered waves, we obtain analytical expressions for the linear growth rates of the ordinary, neutral, and charged modes of density fluctuations. Our results clarify which type of scattering dominates under different thermal coupling, resonance, and density conditions. In strong magnetic fields, scattering of perpendicularly polarized waves is generally suppressed, but by different powers of the cyclotron frequency. Moreover, SRS, which is forbidden in unmagnetized electron and positron pair plasma, becomes possible in the charged mode. This framework enables a comprehensive evaluation of induced scattering in extreme astrophysical and laboratory plasma, such as fast radio burst (FRB) emission and propagation in magnetar magnetospheres.

 - **Abstract**
 Can a disk orbiting a central body be eccentric, when the disk feels its own self-gravity and is pressureless? Contradictory answers appear in the literature. We show that such a disk can be eccentric, but only if it has a sharply truncated edge: the surface density $\Sigma$ must vanish at the edge, and the $\Sigma$ profile must be sufficiently steep at the point where it vanishes. If either requirement is violated, an eccentric disturbance leaks out of the bulk of the disk into the low density edge region, and cannot return. An edge where $\Sigma$ asymptotes to zero but never vanishes, as is often assumed for astrophysical disks, is insufficiently sharp. Similar results were shown by Hunter & Toomre (1969) for galactic warps. We demonstrate these results in three ways: by solving the eigenvalue equation for the eccentricity profile; by solving the initial value problem; and by analyzing a new and simple dispersion relation that is valid for any wavenumber, unlike WKB. As a byproduct, we show that softening the self-gravitational potential is not needed to model a flat disk, and we develop a softening-free algorithm to model the disk's Laplace-Lagrange-like equations. The algorithm is easy to implement and is more accurate than softening-based methods at a given resolution by many orders of magnitude.

 - **Abstract**
 Mean motion resonances (MMRs) are a generic outcome of convergent migration for bodies embedded in accretion disks around a central mass. Long studied in planetary systems, the same phenomenon should occur for stellar-mass black holes (BHs) in AGN disks. In this work, we derive simple analytic criteria describing when BH pairs are driven out of resonance, and use them to chart MMR stability across AGN parameter space, accounting for disruption from general-relativistic apsidal precession, hydrodynamic turbulence, and stellar stirring. Across plausible AGN disk models, we find three MBH mass regimes: (i) for $M/ M_\odot\gtrsim 10^{7.5}$, first order resonances are generically unstable; (ii) for $M/ M_\odot\lesssim 10^{6.5}$, stable MMRs are always present; (iii) for $10^{6.5}\lesssim M / M_\odot \lesssim 10^{7.5}$, stability depends on disk mass flux, the summed mass of the orbiters, and the nuclear-cusp slope. When present, stable MMRs commonly occur between an inner anti-trap and an outer trap set by thermal torque, a region where embedded objects migrate outward in the disk. These results imply that high-mass AGN allow convergent migration to proceed to LVK-band mergers largely without resonant chains, whereas low/intermediate-mass AGN can host MMRs, with the potential to reshape merger pathways.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic and planetary dust hold vital clues to the chemical evolution of the solar system, yet in situ analysis of their molecular and elemental composition remains technically challenging. Here we present laboratory results from HANKA (High-resolution mass Analyzer for Nano-scale Kinetic Astro materials), a compact Orbitrap-based mass spectrometer developed towards the goal of a universal dust detector for space applications. Using infrared laser ablation and plasma formation under vacuum, we analyzed solid-state samples representative of Lunar, Martian, and Meteoritic material. The resulting mass spectra - recorded at resolving powers of R=60000 - reveal complex, but characteristic element mixtures. These results demonstrate the single event sensitivity of HANKA, and its mass resolution with the ability to resolve complex mass spectra and possibly differentiate geochemical signatures across planetary bodies. The dynamic range of 3-4 orders of magnitude enables even the detection of trace compounds. The minimalistic impact sampling approach enables fast, high-precision compositional mass analysis without complex sample preparation, making the instrument well-suited for orbital, surface, or flyby missions with expected dust impacts. Our system consists of an IR-laser system that simulates impacts of nano to micron sized solid-state dust and ice particles from space. It therefore allows to perform so called analogue experiments in the laboratory. We conclude that IR- laser pulses on a solid-state material are not only well suited for ice particle impact analogues but also a good analogue experiment for solid state particle impacts on a dust detector electrode in space. Moreover, the IR laser is employed only for an optimal analogue experiment simulating the impact event - it is not necessary in space on a spacecraft detecting space dust.

 - **Abstract**
 Photometric surveys require precise point spread function (PSF) characterization, as it varies across filters and is crucial for accurate photometry and low surface brightness (LSB) studies. However, the small PSF size provided by default pipelines suits only barely resolved objects, making it difficult to analyze regions near bright stars (rendering those regions unusable). These components are then combined to generate a final PSF for each exposure and filter, spanning 15 mag arcsec-2 in surface brightness and 4 arcmin in radius in the broad bands. In narrow-band filters, the J-PLUS PSF exhibits two rings, whereas in broad-band filters, only one ring is observed. Additionally, the position of the ring shifts with filter wavelength: as the filters become redder, the ring radius increases. We find that there is no significant variation in the extended PSF observed as a function of time (within 2.5h) or position in the field of view. The radial profile of NGC 4212 (which is close to a star) is also studied before/after PSF-subtraction. We developed a novel method to determine the central coordinates of saturated stars, and classify stars without using Gaia magnitudes. Additionally, mirror reflections are automatically detected and masked. Furthermore, in combining different stars and various components of the PSF, we avoided the use of a fixed radius by introducing a new method that does not depend on radial measurements. Accurate characterization of the extended PSF and its subtraction improves sky subtraction, increases the effective area of the survey by about 10%, and enables the study of extended large LSB features in wide area surveys like J-PLUS. Our pipeline is published as free software (GNU GPLv3) an can be customized to other surveys such as J-PAS, where its impact will be even greater due to its depth. This paper is fully reproducible and produced from Commit 4860c70.

 - **Abstract**
 Astronomical time-series analysis faces a critical limitation: the scarcity of labeled observational data. We present a pre-training approach that leverages simulations, significantly reducing the need for labeled examples from real observations. Our models, trained on simulated data from multiple astronomical surveys (ZTF and LSST), learn generalizable representations that transfer effectively to downstream tasks. Using classifier-based architectures enhanced with contrastive and adversarial objectives, we create domain-agnostic models that demonstrate substantial performance improvements over baseline methods in classification, redshift estimation, and anomaly detection when fine-tuned with minimal real data. Remarkably, our models exhibit effective zero-shot transfer capabilities, achieving comparable performance on future telescope (LSST) simulations when trained solely on existing telescope (ZTF) data. Furthermore, they generalize to very different astronomical phenomena (namely variable stars from NASA's \textit{Kepler} telescope) despite being trained on transient events, demonstrating cross-domain capabilities. Our approach provides a practical solution for building general models when labeled data is scarce, but domain knowledge can be encoded in simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 The interaction of cosmic rays (CRs) with magnetic fields and the interstelar medium (ISM) leads to the production of nonthermal radiation. Although this has been a topic of study for many years, it still poses many challenges to the understanding of these processes. In this work we present a short review of recent advances in the understanding of CR propagation in magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) turbulence, in particular the process of mirror diffusion, and how it can help explain recent observational constraints for CR diffusion away from sources. We also present preliminary results from Monte Carlo simulations of CR cascading and propagation within a young massive stellar cluster (YMSC), aimed at probing the origin of very-high-energy (VHE) emission from these sources.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar coronae are believed to be the main birthplace of various stellar magnetic activities. However, the structures and properties of stellar coronae remain poorly understood. Using the Space Weather Modelling Framework with the Alfvén Wave Solar Model (SWMF-AWSoM) and dynamo-generated surface magnetic maps, here we model the coronae of four solar-type stars. By incorporating the Sun, our work covers a range of stars with the rotation varying from 1.0 to 23.3 $\Omega_\odot$ (periods of 25 to 1 days). Guided by observations, we scale the magnetic field strength with increasing rotation, covering a range between 6.0 G to 1200 G approximately. In our models, energy release associated with small-scale magnetic flux is a key source of coronal heating and is essential for reproducing realistic coronal structures. Our models capture dense (1$-$2 orders of magnitude higher than solar values) and ultra-hot ($\sim 10\,\mathrm{MK}$) coronae dominated by closed field structures. Using the CHIANTI atomic database, we also compute synthetic X-ray spectra and derive the corresponding X-ray luminosities $(L_X)$, which follow a scaling law to magnetic field $L_X \propto \langle|\mathbf{B}|\rangle^{1.75}$. Furthermore, the coronal X-ray emission is found to be rotationally modulated by the alternating presence of bright active regions and dark coronal holes. These results provide new insights into the extremely high-energy coronae of rapidly rotating solar-type stars, which differ markedly from the Sun.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new implementation of nuclear reaction networks in the \texttt{G}eneral-relativistic \texttt{mu}ltigrid \texttt{nu}merical (\texttt{Gmunu}) code, a framework for general relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamics (GRRMHD). The extended code self-consistently evolves nuclear species coupled to hydrodynamics, magnetic fields, and neutrino radiation transport under the conformal flatness approximation to Einstein's equations. Four approximate nuclear networks are included, with stiff source terms integrated using implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta schemes. Validation is performed through benchmarks including conserved-to-primitive recovery with a tabulated stellar equation of state, one-zone silicon burning, and hydrodynamic tests of shock tubes, acoustic pulses, and detonation fronts of Type Ia supernovae. These tests confirm accurate coupling between nuclear reactions and fluid dynamics, conserving electron and nuclear mass fractions to machine precision. As an application, we conduct spherically symmetric core-collapse supernova simulations. The models reproduce the expected non-exploding behavior of standard progenitors, while enhanced neutrino heating revives the shock. Including nuclear burning modifies the post-shock composition and dynamics, converting silicon and oxygen layers into iron-group nuclei and strengthening the explosion. This demonstrates the impact of explosive burning on ejecta composition and shock evolution, and establishes the stability of the coupled GR radiation-MHD-nuclear framework. The implementation is fully compatible with multidimensional GRMHD simulations and represents the first GRRMHD code combining M1 neutrino transport with fully coupled nuclear burning.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic fields are fundamental to the dynamics of the interstellar medium (ISM) in spiral galaxies and are often separated into large-scale, regular ($\boldsymbol{B}$) and small-scale, random ($\boldsymbol{b}$) components. The thermal electron density, $n_{\rm e}$, can also be divided into large-scale, diffuse, $\langle n_{\rm e} \rangle$, and small-scale, clumpy, $\delta n_{\rm e}$, components. Estimating the properties of $b$ and $\delta n_{\rm e}$ from observations, even within the Milky Way, has long been challenging. This work addresses the challenge using pulsars, which probe the Milky Way's magneto-ionic medium. Using data of more than 1200 pulsars from the Australia Telescope National Facility pulsar catalogue, we combine dispersion (${\rm DM}$) and rotation (${\rm RM}$) measures with theoretical models to estimate both small- and large-scale properties of the Galactic magnetic field and thermal electron density. We find no significant correlation between the average parallel magnetic field strength, $\langle B_{\parallel} \rangle [\mu{\rm G}] = 1.232\,{\rm RM}\,[{\rm rad\,m^{-2}}]/{\rm DM}\,[{\rm pc\,cm^{-3}}]$, and pulsar distance. For pulsars within $20\,{\rm kpc}$, we estimate $|B| \approx 1.2\,\mu{\rm G}$ and $\langle n_{\rm e} \rangle \approx 0.05\,{\rm cm}^{-3}$. More importantly, we determine correlation lengths of small-scale components, $\ell_{b} \approx 20$ -- $30\,{\rm pc}$ and $\ell_{\delta n_{\rm e}} \approx 250$ -- $300\,{\rm pc}$. At smaller distances, $B$ remains roughly constant, while $\langle n_{\rm e} \rangle$ increases and both length scales decrease. These results refine our understanding of fundamental scales in the magneto-ionic medium, aiding the interpretation of extragalactic ${\rm RM}$s and providing insights into the role of magnetic fields in galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic birefringence is a hypothesized parity violation in electromagnetism that predicts a frequency-independent polarization rotation as light propagates. This would rotate the light from the Cosmic Microwave Background, producing an unexpected EB correlation. However, cosmic birefringence angle is degenerate with instrument polarization angle, and breaking this degeneracy requires an absolute polarization calibration. We calibrate the BICEP3 telescope (a 95GHz CMB polarimeter) by observing a rotating polarized source (RPS) with both the telescope and a small test receiver called the In-Situ Absolute Angle Calibrator (ISAAC).
#### Strong Progenitor Age-bias in Supernova Cosmology. II. Alignment with DESI BAO and Signs of a Non-Accelerating Universe

 - **Abstract**
 Supernova (SN) cosmology is based on the key assumption that the luminosity standardization process of Type Ia SNe remains invariant with progenitor age. However, direct and extensive age measurements of SN host galaxies reveal a significant (5.5{\sigma}) correlation between standardized SN magnitude and progenitor age, which is expected to introduce a serious systematic bias with redshift in SN cosmology. This systematic bias is largely uncorrected by the commonly used mass-step correction, as progenitor age and host galaxy mass evolve very differently with redshift. After correcting for this age-bias as a function of redshift, the SN dataset aligns more closely with the w0waCDM model recently suggested by the DESI BAO project from a combined analysis using only BAO and CMB data. This result is further supported by an evolution-free test that uses only SNe from young, coeval host galaxies across the full redshift range. When the three cosmological probes (SNe, BAO, CMB) are combined, we find a significantly stronger (> 9{\sigma}) tension with the {\Lambda}CDM model than that reported in the DESI papers, suggesting a time-varying dark energy equation of state in a currently non-accelerating universe.

 - **Abstract**
 In these lecture notes, we describe the current state-of-the-art for numerical simulations of large-scale structure and galaxy formation. Numerical simulations play a central role in the preparation and the exploitation of large-scale galaxy surveys, in which galaxies are the fundamental observational objects. We first describe basic methods for collisionless N-body dynamics that enable us to model dark matter accurately by solving the Vlasov-Poisson equations. We then discuss simple methods to populate dark matter halos with galaxies, such as Halo and Sub-halo Abundance Matching techniques and baryonification techniques for capturing baryonic effects on the matter distribution. We finally describe how to model the gas component by solving the Euler-Poisson equations, focusing on the foundational assumptions behind these equations, namely local thermo-dynamical equilibrium, and the nature of the truncation errors of the numerical scheme, namely numerical diffusion. We show a few examples of simulations of a Milky-Way-like halo without cooling, with cooling and with star formation. We finally describe different subgrid prescriptions recently developed to model star formation, supernovae feedback and active galactic nuclei and how they impact cosmological simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 We show that the parameters used to standardize the luminosity of Type 1a supernovae in the SALT2 and SiFTO models are strongly dependent on the redshift z. Consequently, when standardized with increasing z, the average absolute magnitudes of Type 1a supernovae are artificially increased. This means that for a given apparent magnitude they are, on average, assigned larger distances than they actually are, creating the appearance of their recession with acceleration and requiring the introduction of the concept of antigravity (dark energy) to explain it. We also show that after standardization, Type 1a supernovae cease to be standard candles. We therefore argue that such a standardization is not suitable for measuring the distances to Type 1a supernovae, and hence the accelerating expansion of the Universe is called into question.

 - **Abstract**
 During October - November 2025, interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, will pass upstream of the Europa Clipper and Hera spacecraft. Here, we identify two potential opportunities for in-situ observations of 3I's ion tail by immersion, facilitated by the close alignment between the comet's hyperbolic trajectory with the ecliptic plane. During the period 30 October - 6 November 2025, it is predicted that Europa Clipper will potentially be immersed within the ion tail of 3I/ATLAS, providing the opportunity to detect the signatures of an interstellar comet's ion tail. Characteristic changes to the solar wind are also expected to be observed; a magnetic draping structure associated with the comet may be identifiable. It is further predicted that spacecraft Hera will possibly be immersed within the ion tail of 3I/ATLAS during the period 25 October - 1 November 2025.
#### Discovery of red galaxy candidates at z ~ 12: Early dust growth or significant nebular emission with high-temperature stars?

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of two z ~ 12 galaxy candidates with unusually red UV slopes (betaUV ~> -1.5), and probe the origin of such colors at cosmic dawn. From Prospector fits to the UNCOVER/MegaScience dataset -- deep JWST/NIRCam imaging of Abell 2744 in 20 broad- and medium-bands -- we identify several new z > 10 galaxies. Medium-band data improve redshift estimates, revealing two lensed (mu ~ 3.3) z ~ 12 galaxies in a close pair with beta_UV ~> -1.5 at an UV absolute magnitude of M_UV ~ -19 mag, lying away from typical scatter on previously known MUV-betaUV relations. SED fitting with Prospector, Bagpipes, and EAZY support their high-z nature, with probability of low-z interlopers of p(z < 7) < 10%. The potential low-z interlopers are z ~ 3 quiescent galaxies (QGs), but unexpected to be detected at the given field of view unless z ~ 3 QG stellar mass function has a strong turn up at log Mstar/Msun ~ 9. Unlike typical blue high-redshift candidates (beta_UV ~< -2.0), these red slopes require either dust or nebular continuum reddening. The dust scenario implies Av ~ 0.8 mag, which is larger than theoretical predictions, but is consistent with a dust-to-stellar mass ratio (log M_dust/M_star ~ -3). The nebular scenario demands dense gas (log nH /cm^3 ~ 4.0) around hot stars (log Teff [K] ~ 4.9). Spectroscopic follow-up is essential to determine their true nature and reveal missing galaxies at the cosmic dawn.

 - **Abstract**
 We performed a statistical study of two old open clusters NGC 188 and M 67 using Gaia DR3 data. No tidal tails of the clusters were detected, which most likely had been destroyed when the cluster passed through the Galactic plane. The size estimates of the clusters depend on the range of astrometric parameters and stellar magnitudes of the stars used for star counts. The mass spectra of two clusters differ significantly. NGC 188 shows a deficit of low-mass stars compared to M 67. In the halo region of NGC 188 (compared to the core region of the cluster), there is a relative excess of the low-mass stars (just as in the case of M 67) and a deficit of stars in the mass range from 0.66 to 0.9 solar masses. Comparison with the Hunt & Reffert samples showed that almost all the stars from these samples are contained among the stars we selected for counting. Moreover, the group probability of these stars belonging to clusters, estimated by the uniform background method, is higher than 60%. It is shown that the velocity dispersion of single stars (selected according to the `stellar magnitude -- color index' diagrams) is significantly smaller than the velocity dispersion of unresolved binary stars.

 - **Abstract**
 The buoyancy stability properties of the ICM are modified because of the anisotropic transport of heat along the magnetic field lines. This feature gives rise to the MTI when the temperature gradient is aligned with the gravity, which occurs in the outskirts of galaxy clusters. Most previous linear analyses of the MTI adopted a local, Boussinesq approach. However, the conduction length, which sets the characteristic length scale of the MTI, might be a non-negligible fraction of the scale height in the ICM. We want to assess the impact of locality assumptions on the linear physics of the MTI. Another goal is to unveil the deeper connections between these global MTI modes and their MRI counterparts in accretion discs. Our third objective is to provide a new benchmark against which any numerical code implementing the Braginskii heat flux in spherical geometry can be tested. We perform a global linear analysis of the MTI in a spherical stratified model of the ICM. We use a combination of analytical results, corroborated by numerical results obtained with both a pseudo-spectral solver and IDEFIX, to better explain the physics of the global MTI modes. We obtain scaling laws and approximate expressions for the growth rates of the global modes. We show that the associated functions are confined within an inner region, limited by a turning point, where the mode is allowed to grow. The most unstable local MTI modes correspond to the portion of the global mode localised near the turning point. This phenomenology is similar to that of the global MRI modes. Finally, direct simulations successfully reproduce the global MTI modes and their growth rates, with errors smaller than 1%. Overall, this study provides us with new insights on the linear theory of the global MTI in the ICM, and a useful numerical test bench for any astrophysical fluid dynamics code embedding anisotropic heat flux.

 - **Abstract**
 Reflection of X-rays at the inner accretion disk around black holes imprints relativistically broadened features in the observed spectrum. Besides the black hole properties and the ionization and density of the accretion disk the features also depend on the location and geometry of the primary source of X-rays, often called the corona. We present a fast general relativistic model for spectral fitting of a radially extended, ring-like corona above the accretion disk. A commonly used model to explain observed X-ray reflection spectra is the lamp post, which assumes a point-like source on the rotational axis of the black hole. While often being able to explain the observations, this geometric model does not allow for a constraint on the radial size of the corona. We therefore extend the publicly available relativistic reflection model RELXILL by implementing a radially extended, ring-like primary source. With the new RELXILL model allowing us to vary the position of the primary source in two dimensions, we present simulated line profiles and spectra and discuss implications of data fitting compared to the lamp post model. We then apply this extended RELXILL model to XMM-Newton and NuSTAR data of the radio-quiet Seyfert-2 AGN ESO 033-G002. The new model describes the data well, and we are able to constrain the distance of the source to the black hole to be less than three gravitational radii, while the angular position of the source is poorly constrained. We show that a compact, radially extended corona close to the ISCO can explain the observed relativistic reflection equally well as the point-like lamp post corona. The model is made freely available to the community.

 - **Abstract**
 Carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars are ancient stars enriched in carbon and heavy elements. Some of these stars exhibit enhanced s-process and/or r-process elements, hence are classified as CEMP-s, CEMP-rs, or CEMP-r. This classification is challenging due to the limited availability of heavy element abundances, particularly among r-process elements. Heavy r-process elements such as terbium, holmium, thulium, ytterbium, lutetium, tantalum, and iridium have rarely been measured because their sensitive lines are located in the ultraviolet. However, they provide sensitive diagnostics of the s-, r-, and i- nucleosynthetic processes. In this work, we aim to obtain a secure classification of CEMP-s and -rs stars and investigate whether the i-process can account for the measured abundance patterns in CEMP-rs stars. We derive the abundance profiles, notably for twelve heavy r-elements, including, in some cases, tantalum, using high-resolution UVES spectra of seventeen CEMP-s and -rs stars. Based on indicators such as the [s/r] abundance ratio or the model-independent 'abundance distance', nine stars are confirmed as CEMP-rs and six as CEMP-s. The classification of two objects remains uncertain. The i-process satisfactorily reproduces the abundance patterns of CEMP-rs stars. However, larger samples are needed to confirm trends with metallicity and clarify how CEMP-rs stars differ from CEMP-s stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, IceCube reported neutrino emission from the Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068. Using 13.1 years of IceCube data, we present a follow-up search for neutrino sources in the northern sky. NGC 1068 remains the most significant neutrino source among 110 preselected gamma-ray emitters while also being spatially compatible with the most significant location in the northern sky. Its energy spectrum is characterized by an unbroken power-law with spectral index $\gamma = 3.4 \pm 0.2$. Consistent with previous results, the observed neutrino flux exceeds its gamma-ray counterpart by at least two orders of magnitude. Motivated by this disparity and the high X-ray luminosity of the source, we selected 47 X-ray bright Seyfert galaxies from the Swift/BAT spectroscopic survey that were not included in the list of gamma-ray emitters. When testing this collection for neutrino emission, we observe a 3.3$\sigma$ excess from an ensemble of 11 sources, with NGC 1068 excluded from the sample. Our results strengthen the evidence that X-ray bright cores of active galactic nuclei are neutrino emitters.

 - **Abstract**
 Supernova 1987A was the closest supernova event to be observed in nearly 400 years. The outflowing ejecta from the explosion continues to interact with extended circumstellar material and with the equatorial ring (ER) in the triple ring system, while observations of the system have continued across the whole electromagnetic spectrum. This review mainly focuses on works published over the past ten years on Supernova 1987A and its remnant. These include (a) submillimetre, infrared and X-ray studies of molecules, ions and dust in the ejecta, and (b) infrared, optical and X-ray studies of dust and ionized gas in the ER and in the surrounding circumstellar medium, including their time evolution as the ER is shocked and eroded by the impact of high velocity ejecta. Since 2022, the James Webb Space Telescope has become available for high angular resolution infrared observations of Supernova 1987A and has made significant contributions to both (a) and (b) above. Its discovery of redshifted narrow-line emission from multiple ion species located at the centre of the ejecta strongly requires the presence there of either a cooling hot neutron star, or a pulsar wind nebula, to power the emission.

 - **Abstract**
 Traditionally, the condensation sequence of circumstellar dust is predicted based on the thermodynamic stabilities of specific condensates in the macroscopic bulk phase. However, at the (sub-)nanometer scale clusters with non-crystalline structures and significantly different properties are energetically favoured. For this reason, we study the thermodynamic stabilities of metal oxide clusters with generic stoichiometries of M$_2$O$_3$ and M$_3$O$_4$, where M represents a metal atom. With an upper size limit of 50 atoms, we consider clusters with sizes n=1$-$10 for (M$_2$O$_3$)$_n$, and n=1$-$7 for (M$_3$O$_4$)$_n$. The M$_2$O$_3$ clusters comprise alumina (Al$_2$O$_3$), Mg-rich pyroxene (MgSiO$_3$) and a size-limited sample of titanates (CaTiO$_3$), whereas the M$_3$O$_4$ clusters include spinel (MgAl$_2$O$_4$), Mg-rich olivine (Mg$_2$SiO$_4$) and calcium aluminates (CaAl$_2$O$_4$). We find that, apart from the alumina monomer, the aluminum-bearing clusters (Al$_2$O$_3$)$_n$, n=1$-$10, and (MgAl$_2$O$_4$)$_n$, n=1$-$7, are favoured over their silicate counterparts (MgSiO$_3$)$_n$, n=1$-$10 and (Mg$_2$SiO$_4$)$_n$, n=1$-$7. Also, we find that calcium aluminate clusters, CaAl$_2$O$_4$, are energetically more favourable than magnesium aluminate clusters, MgAl$_2$O$_4$. Furthermore, for a limited data set of (CaTiO$_3$)$_n$, n=1$-$2, clusters we find significantly larger stabilities than for the other considered (M$_2$O$_3$)$_n$ clusters, namely Al$_2$O$_3$ and MgSiO$_3$. Future investigations, in particular on titanates and on Ca-rich silicates, are required to draw a more thorough and complete picture of the condensation sequence at the (sub-)nanoscale.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the stellar shape and size-mass relationship of X-ray selected Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) host galaxies using the high-angular resolution and deep sensitivity in the near-infrared of the COSMOS-Web JWST survey field. We present the rest-frame 1-$\mu m$ size, stellar mass, Sersic index, axis-ratio, Gini-$M_{20}$ parameters of 690 moderate luminosity AGNs between redshift 0-3 and with stellar mass $\log M_s\sim 10.75$. We find that AGN host galaxies have an effective radius of 1-5 kpc, which is between star-forming (SFG) and quiescent galaxies (QGs) of the same stellar mass. AGN hosts have similar size-mass trends as SFG and QGs, being smaller at higher redshift for the same stellar mass. The slope of the size-mass relationship of AGN host galaxies is steeper than that of star-forming galaxies. Their rest-frame 1$\mu m$ stellar morphology indicates a significant spheroidal component. We observed a low merger fraction (6%) in our sample as well as substructures similar to disks, bars, and spiral arms in the residual images, which are in tension with evolutionary pathways that require major mergers. However, it may also be due to the different timescales between mergers and AGN activity.

 - **Abstract**
 A significant fraction of stars experience close interactions, including collisions resulting from gravitational encounters and mergers within close binary systems. These processes can produce more massive stars that may give rise to relatively rare objects such as blue stragglers. Distinguishing the outcomes of collisions and mergers is challenging yet essential for interpreting observations. This study utilizes the magnetohydrodynamics code AREPO to simulate collisions and mergers of $5$ to $10 \,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ main-sequence stars, systematically comparing the properties of the resulting products. Both collisions and mergers yield more massive, strongly magnetized, rapidly and differentially rotating stars with cores enriched in hydrogen, but notable quantitative differences emerge. Merger products exhibit core hydrogen fractions up to $10\%$ higher than those of collision products. In both scenarios, turbulent mixing amplifies magnetic field energies by $9$ to $12$ orders of magnitude. However, magnetic fields in small-impact-parameter collision products display small-scale reversals that may dissipate over time, whereas merger products and large-impact-parameter collision products develop large-scale ordered, potentially long-lived magnetic fields. Additionally, only merger products display magnetically driven, bipolar outflows with radial velocities exceeding $300$ to $400 \,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. These distinctions may result in divergent long-term evolutionary outcomes, which warrant further investigation in future studies.

 - **Abstract**
 Galactic cosmic rays (CRs) play a crucial role in galaxy formation and evolution by altering gas dynamics and chemistry across multiple scales. Typical numerical simulations of CR transport assume a constant diffusion coefficient for the entire galaxy, despite both numerical and theoretical studies showing that it can change by orders of magnitude depending on the phase of the interstellar medium. Only a few simulations exist that self-consistently calculate CR transport with diffusion, streaming, and advection by the background gas. In this study we explore three subgrid models for CR diffusion, based on popular theories of CR transport. We post-process an isolated, star-forming MHD galactic disk simulated using the RAMSES code. The resulting diffusion coefficients depend solely on the subgrid turbulent kinetic energy and the MHD state variables of the plasma. We use these models to calculate coefficients for vertical transport. We find that they depend critically on the local magnetic field tilt angle. Across models, our resulting diffusion coefficients range from $10^{26}~\rm cm^2s^{-1}$ to $10^{31}~\rm cm^2s^{-1}$, and yield CR energy densities at the midplane from $1$ to $100 ~\rm eV cm^{-3}$, suggesting varied degrees of backreaction on their environment. Using simple approximations, we show that the gamma ray luminosity of the galaxy depends primarily on the gas surface density and the turbulent confinement of CRs by the galactic corona.

 - **Abstract**
 A long-lived central engine embedded in expanding supernova ejecta can alter the dynamics and observational signatures of the event, producing an unusually luminous, energetic, and/or rapidly-evolving transient. We use two-dimensional hydrodynamics simulations to study the effect of a central energy source, varying the amount, rate, and isotropy of the energy deposition. We post-process the results with a time-dependent Monte Carlo radiation transport code to extract observational signatures. The engine excavates a bubble at the centre of the ejecta, which becomes Rayleigh-Taylor unstable. Sufficiently powerful engines are able to break through the edge of the bubble and accelerate, shred, and compositionally mix the entire ejecta. The breakout of the engine-driven wind occurs at distinct rupture points, and the outflowing high-velocity gas may eventually give rise to radio emission. The dynamical impact of the engine leads to faster rising optical light curves, with photon escape facilitated by the faster expansion of the ejecta and the opening of low-density channels. For models with strong engines, the spectra are initially hot and featureless, but later evolve to resemble those of broad-line Ic supernovae. Under certain conditions, line emission from ionized, low-velocity material near the centre of the ejecta may be able to escape and produce narrow emission similar to that seen in interacting supernovae. We discuss how variability in the engine energy reservoir and injection rate could give rise to a heterogeneous set of events spanning multiple observational classes, including the fast blue optical transients, broad-line Ic supernovae, and superluminous supernovae.

 - **Abstract**
 The cosmic 21 cm line signal of neutral hydrogen provides the possibility to constrain the matter power spectrum. Primordial magnetic fields present before decoupling have an effect on the linear matter power spectrum. The redshifted 21 cm line signal is observed at different frequencies allowing to determine multifrequency angular power spectra. These are presented for cosmological models including the adiabatic, primordial curvature mode as well as the compensated magnetic mode for different values of the magnetic field parameters. For multifrequency angular power spectra frequency ranges have been set around central frequencies of uGMRT Band 3 data as well as MeerKAT L band data. For these signal-over-noise ratios are obtained as well as for SKA1-MID which is part of the currently under construction SKAO.

 - **Abstract**
 The polarization of X-ray synchrotron emission in blazars offers a direct probe into the magnetic field geometry and particle acceleration processes operating in relativistic jets. We use particle-in-cell simulations of magnetic reconnection and magnetized turbulence, coupled to polarization-sensitive radiative transfer code, to interpret IXPE observations of Mrk 421 during a high flux state recorded in December of 2023. To evaluate the fitness of the theoretical scenarios, we rely on a quantitative comparison the statistical properties of simulated and observed X-ray flux and polarization light curves using five evaluation metrics, rather than attempting to fit individual data points. We propose a multi-zone model where jet emission is represented as the sum of the radiative output of many independent cells, each described by a simulation run viewed at different orientations. Comparison of ensembles of simulated Stokes-parameter light curves with IXPE data shows that magnetic reconnection dominated models provide the best match to the observed X-ray flux and polarization dynamics. The optimal configuration corresponds to N = 15 emitting cells, which reproduces the observed amplitudes and timescales of the X-ray flux and polarization variations. Magnetized turbulence models underpredict both the flux and polarization variability. Our results indicate that a multi-zone, reconnection-powered emission scenario can describe the X-ray polarization behavior of Mrk 421 and establish a quantitative framework for testing theoretical models against IXPE observations of other high-synchrotron-peaked blazars.

 - **Abstract**
 We present $\texttt{SBi3PCF}$, a simulation-based inference (SBI) framework for analysing a higher-order weak lensing statistic, the integrated 3-point correlation function (i3PCF). Our approach forward-models the cosmic shear field using the $\texttt{CosmoGridV1}$ suite of N-body simulations, including a comprehensive set of systematic effects such as intrinsic alignment, baryonic feedback, photometric redshift uncertainty, shear calibration bias, and shape noise. Using this, we have produced a set of DES Y3-like synthetic measurements for 2-point shear correlation functions $\xi_{\pm}$ (2PCFs) and i3PCFs $\zeta_{\pm}$ across 6 cosmological and 11 systematic parameters. Having validated these measurements against theoretical predictions and thoroughly examined for potential systematic biases, we have found that the impact of source galaxy clustering and reduced shear on the i3PCF is negligible for Stage-III surveys. Furthermore, we have tested the Gaussianity assumption for the likelihood of our data vector and found that while the sampling distribution of the 2PCF can be well approximated by a Gaussian function, the likelihood of the combined 2PCF + i3PCF data vector including filter sizes of $90'$ and larger can deviate from this assumption. Our SBI pipeline employs masked autoregressive flows to perform neural likelihood estimation and is validated to give statistically accurate posterior estimates. On mock data, we find that including the i3PCF yields a substantial $63.8\%$ median improvement in the figure of merit for $\Omega_m - \sigma_8 - w_0$. These findings are consistent with previous works on the i3PCF and demonstrate that our SBI framework can achieve the accuracy and realism needed to analyse the i3PCF in wide-area weak lensing surveys.
