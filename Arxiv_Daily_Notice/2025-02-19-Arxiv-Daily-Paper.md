#### The JWST EXCELS survey: Probing strong-line diagnostics and the chemical evolution of galaxies over cosmic time using Te-metallicities

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of the rest-frame optical spectra of 22 [OIII]$\lambda$4363 detected galaxies in the redshift range $1.65 < z < 7.92$ (with $\langle z \rangle$ = 4.05) from JWST/NIRSpec medium-resolution observations taken as part of the EXCELS survey. To supplement these high-redshift sources, we also consider a sample of 782 local [OIII]$\lambda$4363 detected galaxies from the DESI Early Data Release. Our analysis demonstrates that many strong-line calibrations are biased in the early Universe due to the systematic evolution in ionization conditions with redshift. However, the recently introduced $\widehat{R}$ calibration mostly removes the dependence on ionization state and can be considered a largely redshift-independent calibration. In a similar spirit, we introduce a new strong-line diagnostic, $\widehat{RNe}$, which can be used to robustly estimate metallicities when the [OIII]$\lambda$5007 is redshifted out of the wavelength range of JWST/NIRSpec at $z > 9.5$. We also show that strong-line diagnostics using the [NII]$\lambda$6584 emission line are likely to be biased at high-redshift due to a moderate enhancement in the average N/O abundance ratios (at fixed O/H) in these sources. Finally, we discuss the location of our new [OIII]$\lambda$4363 detected galaxies at $z \simeq 4$ on the mass-metallicity plane and investigate the redshift evolution of the fundamental metallicity relation (FMR). We find tentative evidence for an increasing deviation from the FMR at $z > 4$ which might indicate fundamental differences in the baryon cycle at these redshifts. However, more data are required as our high-redshift constraints are still based on a relatively small sample of galaxies and the significance of the deviation is strongly dependent on the assumed form of the fundamental metallicity relation.

 - **Abstract**
 We present spatially resolved dust-continuum ALMA observations from rest-frame $\sim$60 to $\sim$600 $\mu$m (bands 3-10) of the hyperluminous hot dust-obscured galaxy (hot DOG) WISE J224607.6-052634.9 (W2246-0526), at redshift $z=4.6$. W2246-0526 is interacting with at least three companion galaxies, forming a system connected by tidal streams. We model the multiwavelength ALMA observations of the dust continuum using a modified blackbody, from which we derive the dust properties (mass, emissivity index, area of the emitting region, and temperature) in the hot DOG and resolved structures across a region of nearly $\sim$50 kpc. The peak temperature at the location of the hot DOG, $\sim$110 K, is likely the consequence of heating by the central quasar. The dust temperature drops to $\sim$40 K at a radius of $\sim$8 kpc, suggesting that heating by the quasar beyond that distance is nondominant. The dust in the connecting streams between the host and companion galaxies is at temperatures between 30-40 K, typical of starburst galaxies, suggesting it is most likely heated by recent, in-situ star formation. This is the first time dust properties are spatially resolved over several tens of kpc in a galaxy system beyond Cosmic Noon --this is more than six times the scales previously probed in galaxies at those redshifts.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Survey (DESI), combined with data from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and Type Ia supernovae (SNe), challenge the $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) paradigm. They indicate a potential evolution in the dark energy equation of state (EoS), $w(z)$, as suggested by analyses that employ parametric models. In this paper, we use a model-independent approach known as high performance symbolic regression (PySR) to reconstruct $w(z)$ directly from observational data, allowing us to bypass prior assumptions about the underlying cosmological model. Our findings confirm that the DESI data alone agree with the $\Lambda$CDM model ($w(z) = -1$) at the redshift range considered. Notably, this agreement improves slightly when we exclude the data point at $z = 0.51$. Additionally, we observe similar conclusions when combining the DESI data with existing compilations of SNe distance measurements, such as Pantheon+ and the Dark Energy Survey Supernova 5-Year, regardless of the absolute magnitude prior values used. Therefore, these results suggest that it is premature to claim any statistically significant evidence for a dynamical EoS or deviations from the $\Lambda$CDM model based on the current DESI data, either alone or in combination with supernova measurements.

 - **Abstract**
 Binary black holes (BBH) are expected to form and merge in active galactic nuclei (AGN), deep in the potential well of a supermassive black hole (SMBH), from populations that exist in a nuclear star cluster (NSC). Here we investigate the gravitational wave (GW) signature of a BBH lensed by a nearby SMBH. For a fiducial GW150914-like BBH orbiting close to a $10^{8}M_{\odot}$ SMBH located at $z=0.1$, the lensed GW signal varies in a predictable manner in and out of the LISA detectability band and across frequencies. The occurrence of such signatures has the potential to confound LISA global fit models if they are not modelled. Detection of these sources provide an independent measure of AGN inclination angles, along with detecting warping of the inner disk, and measuring the SMBH spin.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a wide-field $(60\arcmin \times 30\arcmin)$ study of a dense region within the Polaris Flare, hereafter referred to as the `Polaris molecular cloud', using $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, and C$^{18}$O ($J=1-0$) observations at $20\arcsec$ resolution, obtained with the Nobeyama 45 m Radio Telescope. The analysis reveals molecular gas formation occurring at column densities up to $\sim10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$, evidenced by an anti-correlation between $\textsc{Hi}$ and CO distributions, indicating active atomic-to-molecular gas conversion. We found a threshold column density for molecular formation at $\sim5\times10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$, which is common among more evolved molecular clouds. The CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor, $X_{\rm CO}$, was found to be $0.7 \times 10^{20}$ H$_2$ cm$^{-2}$ (K km s$^{-1})^{-1}$, lower than the solar neighborhood average. Our chemical models estimate the cloud's age to be $\sim10^{5}-10^{6}$ years, suggesting an early stage of molecular cloud evolution. This interpretation is consistent with the observed low $X_{\rm CO}$ factor. While virial analysis suggests that the entire cloud is gravitationally unbound, we identified several filamentary structures extending from the main cloud body. These filaments show systematic velocity gradients of $0.5-1.5$ km s$^{-1}$ pc$^{-1}$, and analysis of the velocities shows that the molecular gas within them is falling toward the main cloud body, following a free-fall model. This suggests ongoing mass accumulation processes through the filaments, demonstrating that gravitational processes can be important even at column densities of $\sim10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$.

 - **Abstract**
 The Cosmological Principle states that the universe is statistically isotropic and homogeneous on large length scales, typically $\gtrsim 70$Mpc. A detection of significant deviation would help us falsify the simplest models of inflation. In this regard, there are potential indications of departures from this principle, e.g., observations from WMAP and Planck show signs of a preferred direction in the temperature fluctuations known as hemispherical asymmetry in CMB. Phenomenologically, this has been studied using a dipole modulation model. In addition to this, a number of possible mechanisms have been proposed in the literature to explain this anomaly. Some of these scenarios generate dipolar asymmetry or predict quadrupolar asymmetry in the primordial power spectrum of curvature perturbations. In this paper, we study both these asymmetries. To fulfill the objective, we employ 21cm intensity mapping technique post during post-reionization era, i.e., $z\lesssim 7$. We apply Fisher formalism to constrain dipolar and quadrupolar anisotropy parameters using both 21cm power and bispectra and give forecasts for three intensity mapping surveys: SKA-Mid, HIRAX and PUMA. Although 21cm intensity mapping is a very promising cosmological probe, the signals are severely affected by foregrounds. To mitigate the foreground effects, we use foreground avoidance approach. For the interferometer mode of operation, we also include the wedge effect. From our analysis, we find that PUMA, on account of its high redshift range is able to constrain both dipolar and quadrupolar parameters to better than $\sim 10^{-3}$ for redshifts $z \gtrsim 1$. This is one order of magnitude better constraints as compared to those provided by the latest CMB surveys. We also find that as compared to power spectrum, the constraining power of bispectrum is more sensitive towards foregrounds.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational lensing is a universal phenomenon: it affects both gravitational waves (GWs) and electromagnetic signals travelling through the gravitational field of a massive object. In this work, we explore the prospects of observing lensed GW signals from the mergers of massive black holes, lensed by dark matter halos composed of Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM), which form dense cores known as solitons. We focus on wave optics phenomena, where frequency-dependent signatures can be observed in the weak lensing regime (i.e. single-image). Our results show that lensing diffraction signatures differ for low-mass halos in FDM, and can reveal the presence of a solitonic core. Furthermore, we demonstrate that FDM and cold dark matter profiles can be distinguished in GW signals from binary massive black hole mergers, which will be observed by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission. However, the dense solitonic core does not substantially enhance the detectability of FDM halos at large source-lens offsets, relative to standard cold dark matter. Our analysis confirms FDM halos as a promising signature of dark matter on GW observations

 - **Abstract**
 The rapid advancement of image analysis methods in time-domain astronomy, particularly those leveraging AI algorithms, has highlighted efficient image pre-processing as a critical bottleneck affecting algorithm performance. Image pre-processing, which involves standardizing images for training or deployment of various AI algorithms, encompasses essential steps such as image quality evaluation, alignment, stacking, background extraction, gray-scale transformation, cropping, source detection, astrometry, and photometry. Historically, these algorithms were developed independently by different research groups, primarily based on CPU architecture for small-scale data processing. This paper introduces a novel framework for image pre-processing that integrates key algorithms specifically modified for GPU architecture, enabling large-scale image pre-processing for different algorithms. To prepare for the new algorithm design paradigm in the AI era, we have implemented two operational modes in the framework for different application scenarios: Eager mode and Pipeline mode. The Eager mode facilitates real-time feedback and flexible adjustments, which could be used for parameter tuning and algorithm development. The pipeline mode is primarily designed for large scale data processing, which could be used for training or deploying of artificial intelligence models. We have tested the performance of our framework using simulated and real observation images. Results demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances image pre-processing speed while maintaining accuracy levels comparable to CPU based algorithms. To promote accessibility and ease of use, a Docker version of our framework is available for download in the PaperData Repository powered by China-VO, compatible with various AI algorithms developed for time-domain astronomy research.

 - **Abstract**
 The Athena mission entered a redefinition phase in July 2022, driven by the imperative to reduce the mission cost at completion for the European Space Agency below an acceptable target, while maintaining the flagship nature of its science return. This notably called for a complete redesign of the X-ray Integral Field Unit (X-IFU) cryogenic architecture towards a simpler active cooling chain. Passive cooling via successive radiative panels at spacecraft level is now used to provide a 50 K thermal environment to an X-IFU owned cryostat. 4.5 K cooling is achieved via a single remote active cryocooler unit, while a multi-stage Adiabatic Demagnetization Refrigerator ensures heat lift down to the 50 mK required by the detectors. Amidst these changes, the core concept of the readout chain remains robust, employing Transition Edge Sensor microcalorimeters and a SQUID-based Time-Division Multiplexing scheme. Noteworthy is the introduction of a slower pixel. This enables an increase in the multiplexing factor (from 34 to 48) without compromising the instrument energy resolution, hence keeping significant system margins to the new 4 eV resolution requirement. This allows reducing the number of channels by more than a factor two, and thus the resource demands on the system, while keeping a 4' field of view (compared to 5' before). In this article, we will give an overview of this new architecture, before detailing its anticipated performances. Finally, we will present the new X-IFU schedule, with its short term focus on demonstration activities towards a mission adoption in early 2027.
#### Network of velocity-coherent filaments formed by supersonic turbulence in a very-high-velocity HI cloud

 - **Abstract**
 The warm neutral medium (WNM) was thought to be subsonically/transonically turbulent, and it lacks a network of intertwined filaments that are commonly seen in both molecular clouds and cold neutral medium (CNM). Here, we report HI~21 cm line observations of a very-high-velocity (-330 km s$^{-1}$ $<V_{\rm LSR}<$ -250 km s$^{-1}$) cloud (VHVC), using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) with unprecedented resolution and sensitivity. For the first time, such a VHVC is clearly revealed to be a supersonic WNM system consisting of a network of velocity-coherent HI~filaments. The filaments are in the forms of slim curves, hubs, and webs, distributed in different layers within the position-position-velocity ({\it ppv}) data cube. The entire cloud has skewed log-normal probability distribution of column density and the filaments themselves show asymmetrical radial density profiles, indicating shock compression by supersonic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, as is also confirmed by our MHD simulation (sonic Mach number $M_{\rm s}=3$ and Alfvén Mach number $M_{\rm A}=1$). This work suggests that hierarchical filaments can be established by shocks in a low-density WNM, where gravity is negligible, offering a viable pathway to structure formation in the earliest evolutionary phases of the interstellar medium (ISM).

 - **Abstract**
 We conducted precise measurements of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) clustering at $z\sim1$ and $z\sim2$ by measuring the two-point cross-correlation function (CCF) between galaxies and X-ray-selected AGNs, and the two-point auto-correlation function (ACF) of galaxies in the COSMOS field to interpret the CCF results. The galaxy sample was selected from the COSMOS2015 catalog, while the AGN sample was chosen from the {\sl Chandra} COSMOS-Legacy survey catalog. For the AGN samples at $z\sim1$ and $z\sim2$, we calculated AGN bias values of $b=1.16\ (1.16;1.31)$ and $b=2.95\ (2.30;3.55)$, respectively. These values correspond to typical host dark matter halo (DMH) masses of log$(M_{\rm typ}/M_{\odot})=11.82\ (11.82;12.12)$ and log$(M_{\rm typ}/M_{\odot})=12.80\ (12.38;13.06)$, respectively. Subsequently, we performed Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) modeling of X-ray-selected AGNs using the CCF and ACF of galaxies. We have found a significant satellite AGN population at $z\sim 1$ all over the DMH mass ($M_{\rm DMH}$) range occupied by AGNs. While $z\sim 2$ AGNs in our sample are associated with higher mass DMHs and smaller satellite fractions. The HOD analysis suggests a marginal tendency of increasing satellite slope with redshift, but larger samples are needed to confirm this with sufficient statistical significance. We find that the best-fit values of satellite slope in both redshift bins are greater than 0, suggesting tendencies of increasing satellite AGN number with $M_{\rm DMH}$.
#### Shear Particle Acceleration in Structured Gamma-Ray Burst Jets: II. Viewing Angle Effect on the Prompt Emission and Application to GRB 170817A

 - **Abstract**
 Multi-messenger observations suggest that the gamma-ray burst on Aug. 17, 2017 (GRB 170817A) resulted from off-axial observations of its structured jet, which consists of a narrow ultra-relativistic jet core surrounded by a wide mild-relativistic cocoon. In a serious paper, we explore the emission of shear-accelerated electrons in the mixed jet-cocoon (MJC) region in a series of papers. This paper focuses on the viewing angle effect for a structured jet by considering the emission from the shear-accelerated electrons. It is found that the observed synchrotron emission peaks at the Infrared band and the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emission peaks at the band of hundreds of keV. They are not sensitive to the viewing angle. In the off-axis observations scenario, the prompt emission spectrum is dominated by the emission of the shear-accelerated electrons. The prompt gamma-ray spectrum of GRB 170817A can be well explained with our model by setting the velocity of the inner edge of the cocoon region as 0.9c, the magnetic field strength as 21 G, the injected initial electron Lorentz factor as $10^3$, and the viewing angle as 0.44 rad. We argue that the joint observations in the Infrared/optical and X-ray bands are critical to verify our model.
#### Repeating fast radio bursts from synchrotron maser radiation in localized plasma blobs: Application to FRB 20121102A

 - **Abstract**
 The radiation physics of repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) remains enigmatic. Motivated by the observed narrow-banded emission spectrum and ambiguous fringe pattern of the spectral peak frequency ($\nu_{\rm pk}$) distribution of some repeating FRBs, such as FRB 20121102A, we propose that the bursts from repeating FRBs arise from synchrotron maser radiation in localized blobs within weakly magnetized plasma that relativistically moves toward observers. Assuming the plasma moves toward the observers with a bulk Lorentz factor of $\Gamma=100$ and the electron distribution in an individual blob is monoenergetic ($\gamma_{\rm e}\sim300$), our analysis shows that bright and narrow-banded radio bursts with peak flux density $\sim$ 1 ${\rm Jy}$ at peak frequency ($\nu_{\rm pk}$) $\sim 3.85$ GHz can be produced by the synchrotron maser emission if the plasma blob has a magnetization factor of $\sigma\sim10^{-5}$ and a frequency of $\nu_{\rm P}\sim 4.5$ MHz. The spectrum of bursts with lower $\nu_{\rm pk}$ tends to be narrower. Applying our model to the bursts of FRB 20121102A, the distributions of both the observed $\nu_{\rm pk}$ and isotropic energy $E_{\rm iso}$ detected by the Arecibo telescope at the L band and the Green Bank Telescope at the C band are successfully reproduced. We find that the $\nu_{\rm P}$ distribution exhibits several peaks, similar to those observed in the $\nu_{\rm pk}$ distribution of FRB 20121102A. This implies that the synchrotron maser emission in FRB 20121102A is triggered in different plasma blobs with varying $\nu_{\rm P}$, likely due to the inhomogeneity of relativistic electron number density.

 - **Abstract**
 The Gnevyshev-Ohl (G-O) rule, also known as the even-odd effect, is an important observational phenomenon in solar cycles, suggesting that cycles with even indices tend to be followed by stronger cycles. The rule is considered to be related to the solar dynamo, which drives the evolution of the Sun's large-scale magnetic field. However, observational studies of the G-O rule have revealed inconsistencies, particularly regarding long-term variations and the underlying physical mechanisms. In this study, we use an iterative map derived within the framework of the Babcock-Leighton (BL) dynamo to analyze the G-O rule. We investigate comprehensive and definitive forms of the G-O rule using both a sufficiently large number of solar cycles and a limited number of solar cycles. Our findings indicate a higher probability for an arbitrary cycle to be followed by a stronger cycle instead of weaker, regardless of even or odd. Over time spans comparable to historical observations, cycles exhibit periods that follow both the G-O rule and the reversed G-O rule, without a statistically significant preference, consistent with the observed variability of the G-O rule. The occurrence of the reversed G-O rule is random, rather than periodic. The G-O rule emerges as a result of the nonlinearity and stochasticity inherent in the BL mechanism. These results advance our understanding of the solar cycle and pave the way for improved solar dynamo modeling.

 Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio transients from distant galaxies. While most FRBs are singular events, repeaters emit multiple bursts, with only two-FRB 121102 and FRB 180916B-showing periodic activity (160 and 16 days, respectively). FRB 20240209A, discovered by CHIME-FRB, is localized to the outskirts of a quiescent elliptical galaxy ($z = 0.1384$). We discovered a periodicity of $\sim 126$ days in the activity of FRB 20240209A, making it the third FRB with confirmed periodicity. We used auto-correlation and Lomb-Scargle periodogram analyses, validated with randomized control samples, to confirm the periodicity. The FRB's location in an old stellar population disfavors young progenitor models, instead pointing to scenarios involving globular clusters, late-stage magnetars, or low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). Though deep X-ray or polarimetric observations are not available, the localization of the FRB and a possible periodicity point to a binary progenitor likely involving a compact object and a stellar companion.

 - **Abstract**
 Spaceborne gravitational-wave observatories utilize a post-processing technique known as time-delay interferometry (TDI) to reduce the otherwise overwhelming laser frequency noise by around eight orders of magnitude. While, in its traditional form, TDI considers the spacecraft as point masses, recent studies have enhanced this simplified scenario by incorporating more realistic metrology chain models, which include onboard optical, electronic, and digital delays. These studies have updated the TDI algorithm to include onboard delays obtained from pre-launch and in-flight calibrations. Conversely, the processing scheme presented in this article naturally treats onboard delays as part of the TDI combinations: instead of having separate calibration stages, it directly expresses all delays appearing in the algorithm in terms of onboard measurements, especially pseudo-random-noise ranging (PRNR) measurements. The only onboard delays that need to be corrected in our processing scheme are PRNR delays in the digital domain, which are determined by commandable digital-signal-processing parameters; hence, they can be easily managed in post-processing. Furthermore, our processing scheme does not require a prior interspacecraft clock synchronization, and it automatically corrects for potential relative drifts between the clocks driving local phase measurement systems. The proposed observable-based processing scheme significantly strengthens the bond between TDI and the real metrology system.
#### The blazar PKS 0605-085 as the origin of the KM3-230213A ultra high energy neutrino event

 - **Abstract**
 The KM3Net Collaboration has recently reported on the observation of a remarkable event KM3-230213A that could have been produced by an ultra high energy cosmic neutrino. The origin of this event is still unclear. In particular, the cosmogenic neutrino scenario is not favoured due to the non-observation of a similar event by the IceCube detector, and most galactic scenarios are disfavoured as well. We show that the blazar PKS 0605-085 is a viable source of the KM3-230213A event. In particular, even though this blazar is located at 2.4$^{\circ}$ from the KM3-230213A event, the association between the blazar and the event is not unlikely due to a sizable direction systematic uncertainty of $\approx 1.5^{\circ}$ reported by the KM3Net Collaboration. Furthermore, we show that the observation of a $\approx$72 PeV neutrino from PKS 0605-085 is entirely possible given that a $\approx$7.5 PeV neutrino could have been observed from another blazar TXS 0506+056. Finally, we consider $\gamma$-ray constraints on the number of observable neutrino events and show that for the case of the external photon field production mechanism these constraints could be relaxed due to the often-neglected effect of the isotropisation of the hadronically-produced electrons in the magnetic field of the blob. We encourage further multi-wavelength observations of the blazar PKS 0605-085.

 - **Abstract**
 Red supergiant stars (RSGs) are massive stars in a late stage of evolution, crucial for understanding stellar life cycles and Galactic structure. However, RSGs on the far side of our Galaxy have been underexplored due to observational challenges. In this study, we introduce a novel method and present a new catalogue comprising 474 RSGs situated on the far side of the Milky Way, sourced from the OGLE-III catalogue of Variable Stars (OIII-CVS). The identification of these RSGs was made possible by analyzing the granulation parameters extracted from OGLE I-band time-series data and the stellar parameters from Gaia DR3. Additionally, we estimate the distances to these RSGs using an empirical relation between their characteristic amplitude, absolute magnitude, and intrinsic color, achieving a distance uncertainty of 13%. These newly identified RSGs are distributed at Galactocentric distances between 0 and 30kpc, and reside roughly 1 to 4kpc above and below the Galactic plane. This distribution provides new insights into the structure of the Milky Way, particularly at its outer boundaries. Our results reveal that the vertical distribution of these RSGs is consistent with the flare structure of the Galactic disk, confirming that the far side of the Milky Way exhibits a similar flaring pattern to the near side. This catalogue offers a valuable resource for future detailed studies of RSGs and contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the Galactic structure and stellar evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 GRB 240529A is a long-duration gamma-ray burst (GRB) whose light curve of prompt emission is composed of a triple-episode structure, separated by quiescent gaps of tens to hundreds of seconds. More interestingly, its X-ray light curve of afterglow exhibits two-plateau emissions, namely, an internal plateau emission that is smoothly connected with a $\sim t^{-0.1}$ segment and followed by a $\sim t^{-2}$ power-law decay. The three episodes in the prompt emission, together with two plateau emissions in X-ray, are unique in the Swift era. They are very difficult to explain with the standard internal/external shock model by invoking a black hole central engine. However, it could be consistent with the prediction of a supramassive magnetar as the central engine, the physical process of phase transition from magnetar to strange star, as well as the cooling and spin-down of the strange star. In this paper, we propose that the first- and second-episode emissions in the prompt $\gamma-$ray of GRB 240529A are from the jet emission of a massive star collapsing into a supramassive magnetar and the re-activity of central engine, respectively. Then, the third-episode emission of prompt is attributed to the phase transition from a magnetar to a strange star. Finally, the first- and second-plateau emissions of the X-ray afterglow are powered by the cooling and spin-down of the strange star, respectively. The observational data of each component of GRB 240529A are roughly coincident with the estimations of the above physical picture.

 - **Abstract**
 The China Space Station Telescope (CSST) is a forthcoming space-based optical telescope designed to co-orbit with the Chinese Space Station. With a planned slitless spectroscopic survey spanning a broad wavelength range of $255-1000$nm and an average spectral resolution exceeding 200, the CSST holds significant potential for cosmic large-scale structure analysis. In this study, we focus on redshift determinations from slitless spectra through emission line analysis within the CSST framework. Our tailored redshift measurement process involves identifying emission lines in one-dimensional slitless spectra, aligning observed wavelengths with their rest-frame counterparts from prominent galaxy emissions, and calculating wavelength shifts to determine redshifts accurately. To validate our redshift measurement algorithm, we leverage simulated spectra generated by the CSST emulator for slitless spectroscopy. The outcomes demonstrate a remarkable redshift completeness exceeding 95 per cent for emission line galaxies (ELGs), alongside a purity surpassing 85 per cent. The redshift uncertainty remains impressively below than $\sim 0.001$. Notably, when concentrating on galaxies with more than three matched emission lines, the completeness of ELGs and the purity of measurable galaxies can reach 98 per cent and 97 per cent, respectively. Furthermore, we explore the influence of parameters like magnitude, spectral signal-to-noise ratio, and redshift on redshift completeness and purity. The discussion also delves into redshift degeneracies stemming from emission-line matching confusion. Our developed redshift measurement process will be applied to extensive simulated datasets and forthcoming CSST slitless spectroscopic observations for further cosmological and extragalactic analyses.

 - **Abstract**
 It has been proposed that coherent radio emission could be emitted during or shortly following a gamma-ray burst (GRB). Here we present a low-frequency ($170-200$ MHz) search for radio pulses associated with long-duration GRBs using the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA). The MWA, with its rapid-response system, is capable of performing GRB follow-up observations within approximately $30$ seconds. Our single pulse search, with temporal and spectral resolutions of $100\ \mu$s and $10$ kHz, covers dispersion measures up to $5000$ pc cm$^{-3}$. Two single pulse candidates are identified with significance greater than $6\sigma$, surviving a friends-of-friends analysis. We rule out random fluctuations as their origin at a confidence level of $97\%$ ($2.2\sigma$). We caution that radio frequency interference from digital TV (DTV) is most likely the origin of these pulses since the DTV frequency bands almost cover the entire observing frequency band. If they are astrophysical signals, we estimate the peak flux densities for our pulse candidates of $3.6\pm0.6$ Jy and $10.5\pm1.5$ Jy, with corresponding fluences of $431\pm74$ Jy ms and $211\pm37$ Jy ms, respectively. Based on these observations and the assumption of a magnetar origin for the pulse, we constrain the radio emission efficiency as $\epsilon_{\rm{r}}\sim10^{-3}$ for both candidates, which is consistent with pulsar observations. Our results highlight the promising potential of new-generation radio telescopes like the MWA to probe the central engines of GRBs.

 We present the magnetic field in the dense material of the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Milky Way, traced in 850 $\mu$m polarized dust emission as part of the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) B-fields In STar-forming Region Observations (BISTRO) Survey. We observe a highly ordered magnetic field across the CMZ between Sgr B2 and Sgr C, which is strongly preferentially aligned with the orbital gas flows within the clouds of the CMZ. We find that the observed relative orientations are non-random at a $>$99% confidence level and are consistent with models in which the magnetic field vectors are aligned within 30$^{o}$ to the gas flows in 3D. The deviations from aligned magnetic fields are most prominent at positive Galactic longitudes, where the CMZ clouds are more massive, denser, and more actively forming stars. Our observed strongly preferentially parallel magnetic field morphology leads us to hypothesize that in the absence of star formation, the magnetic field in the CMZ is entrained in the orbital gas flows around Sgr A$^{*}$, while gravitational collapse and feedback in star-forming regions can locally reorder the field. This magnetic field behavior is similar to that observed in the CMZ of the nuclear starburst galaxy NGC 253. This suggests that despite its current low star formation rate, the CMZ of the Milky Way is analogous to those of more distant, actively star-forming, galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 Binary stars consisting of a white dwarf and a main sequence star (WDMS) are valuable for studying key astrophysical questions. However, observational biases strongly affect the known population, particularly unresolved systems where the main sequence star outshines the white dwarf. This work aims to comprehensively simulate the population of unresolved WDMS binaries within 100 pc of the Sun and to compare the outcome with the currently most complete volume-limited sample available from Gaia data. We employ a population synthesis code, MRBIN, extensively developed by our group and based on Monte Carlo techniques, which uses a standard binary stellar evolutionary code adapted to cover a wide range of stars across all ages, masses, and metallicities. Selection criteria matching those of Gaia observations are applied to generate synthetic populations comparable to the observed WDMS sample. The synthetic data accurately populate the expected regions in the Gaia color-magnitude diagram. However, simulations predict a lower number of extremely low-mass white dwarfs, suggesting potential issues in observed mass derivations. Additionally, our analysis constrains the common envelope efficiency to 0.1-0.4, consistent with previous findings, and estimates a total completeness of about 25% for the observed sample, confirming the strong observational limitations for unresolved WDMS.

 - **Abstract**
 The latest Gaia Focused Product Release (FPR) provided variability information for $\sim$1000 long-period red giant binaries, the largest sample to date of this binary type having both photometric and spectroscopic time series observations. We cross-matched the Gaia DR3 measurements with the catalogue of long-period red giant candidates from the Gaia FPR, having photometric and radial velocity variability information. Combined with the photo-geometric distances, the extinction, bolometric magnitude, luminosity, spectroscopic radius and mass were estimated. ELL variables are characterized to be low to intermediate-mass stars, with radii as large as the Roche lobe radius of the binary. Eccentricities tend to be lower for primary stars with smaller radii, as the expected result of tidal circularization. Combined with the orbital properties, estimates for the minimum mass of the companion agree with the scenario of a low-mass compact object as the secondary star. There are at least 14 ELL binaries with orbital periods and masses compatible with model predictions for Type Ia SN progenitors. For the rotational variables, their orbital periods, enhanced chromospheric activity, smaller radii and low mass point to a different type of binaries than the original ELL sample. The velocity dispersion is much higher in ELL than in rotational binaries, probably indicating older/younger dynamical ages. The enhanced [$\alpha$/Fe] abundances for some of the ELL binaries resemble the population of young $\alpha$-rich binaries in the thick disk. An episode of mass transfer in those systems may have produced the enhanced $\alpha$ abundances, and the enhanced [Ce/Fe] abundances reported in a few ELL binaries. Luminosities, radii and masses were derived for 243 ELL and 39 rotational binary candidates, the largest Galactic sample of these variables, having chemo-dynamical and physical parameterization.
#### Mutual Validation of Datasets for Analyzing Tilt Angles in Solar Active Regions

 - **Abstract**
 The tilt angle of solar active regions (AR) is crucial for the Babcock-Leighton type dynamo models in the buildup of polar field. However, divergent results regarding properties of tilt angles were reported due to their wide scatter, caused by intrinsic solar mechanisms and measurement errors. Here, we mutually validate the magnetogram-based AR tilt angle dataset from Wang, Jiang, & Luo with the Debrecen Photoheliographic Data by identifying common data points where both datasets provide comparable tilt angles for the same AR/sunspot. The mutually validated datasets effectively reduce measurement errors, enabling a more accurate analysis of the intrinsic properties of tilt angles. Our mutually validated datasets reveal that the difference between white-light-based and magnetogram-based tilt angles has no significant difference. Also, the datasets show that an upward revision of average tilt angle ($\bar\alpha$) and a downward revision of the tilt scatter ($\sigma_\alpha$) compared to previous results are necessary, with typical values of about 7$^\circ$ and 16$^\circ$, respectively. The $\sigma_\alpha$ values demonstrate a strong correlation with AR flux and sunspot area, with the dependency functions re-evaluated using mutually validated datasets. Furthermore, both $\bar\alpha$ and the tilt coefficient for the weak cycle 24 are larger than those for cycle 23. This supports the tilt quenching mechanism, which posits an anti-correlation between the cycle-averaged tilt angle and cycle amplitude. Additionally, tilt angle from the mutually validated dataset has a weak non-monotonic relationship with magnetic flux and does not depend on the maximum magnetic field strength of ARs.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent in-situ observations and numerical models indicated various types of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves contributing to the solar wind acceleration. Among them is an MHD wave decomposition at distances closer than 50 $R_{\odot}$ using data taken by the first perihelion pass of Parker Solar Probe (PSP). However, the underlying physical processes responsible for the formation of the solar wind have not yet been observationally confirmed at distances closer than 10 $R_{\odot}$. We aim to infer the mode population of density fluctuations observed by radio occultation, which has all been attributed to slow magnetoacoustic waves. We compare the radio occultation observations conducted in 2016 using the JAXA's Venus orbiter Akatsuki with the MHD simulation. The time-frequency analysis was applied to the density fluctuations observed by the radio occultation and those reproduced in the MHD model. The time-spatial spectrum of the density fluctuation in the model exhibits two components that are considered to be fast and slow magnetoacoustic waves. The fast magnetoacoustic waves in the model tend to have periods shorter than the slow magnetoacoustic waves, and the superposition of these modes has a broadened spectrum extending in the range of approximately 20$-$1000 s, which resembles that of the observed waves. Based on this comparison, it is probable that the density oscillations observed by radio occultation include fast and slow magnetoacoustic waves, and that fast magnetoacoustic waves are predominant at short periods and slow magnetoacoustic waves are prevalent at long periods. This is qualitatively similar to the results of the mode decomposition obtained from the PSP's first perihelion at more distance regions.
#### Magnetic Fields or Overstable Convective Modes in HR 7495: Exploring the Underlying Causes of the Spike in the 'Hump & Spike' Features

 - **Abstract**
 More than 200 A- and F-type stars observed with Kepler exhibit a distinctive 'hump & spike' feature in their Fourier spectra. The hump is commonly interpreted as unresolved Rossby modes, while the spike has been linked to rotational modulation. Two competing interpretations exist for the spike: magnetic phenomena, such as stellar spots, or Overstable Convective (OsC) modes resonantly exciting low-frequency g modes within the stellar envelope. We analysed photometric data from Kepler and TESS for HR 7495, the brightest 'hump & spike' star (V=5.06), covering 4.5 years and four seasons, respectively. Additionally, radial velocity measurements and spectropolarimetric data were used to investigate magnetic fields and surface features. Furthermore, we analysed model-based artificial light and radial velocity curves to examine the influence of OsC modes on the phase-folded light curves. The phase-folded light curves show that the spike characteristics of HR 7495 align more closely with rotational modulation by stellar spots than with OsC modes. No significant magnetic fields were detected, limiting the field's possible amplitude and geometry. This supports the hypothesis of a subsurface convective layer operating a dynamo, producing low-amplitude, complex magnetic fields. The variability patterns suggest multiple evolving spots. A comparison of contemporaneously observed light and RV data with modelled OsC modes reveals a 0.5 phase offset, strongly disfavouring pulsations as the cause of the spike. While the evolutionary stage of HR 7495 does not entirely preclude the possibility of OsC modes, the observational data overwhelmingly support the stellar spots hypothesis. Our analysis, combined with previous literature, suggests that if not all A- and F-type, at least the 'hump & spike' stars, harbour an undetected weak magnetic field, likely driven by a dynamo mechanism.

 - **Abstract**
 Extreme high-synchrotron peaked blazars (EHSPs) are rare high-energy sources characterised by synchrotron peaks beyond 10$^{17}$ Hz in their spectral energy distributions (SEDs). Their extreme properties challenge conventional blazar emission models and provide a unique opportunity to test the limits of particle acceleration and emission mechanisms in relativistic jets. However, the number of identified EHSPs is still small, limiting comprehensive studies of their population and characteristics. This study aims to identify new EHSP candidates and characterise their emission properties. A sample of 124 $\gamma$-ray blazars is analysed, selected for their high synchrotron peak frequencies and $\gamma$-ray emission properties, with a focus on sources showing low variability and good broadband data coverage. Their SEDs are constructed using archival multi-wavelength data from the SSDC SED Builder service, supplemented with recent Swift-UVOT, Swift-XRT, and Fermi-LAT observations. The SEDs are modelled with a one-zone synchrotron/synchrotron-self-Compton framework, classifying sources by synchrotron peak frequency. We identify 66 new EHSP candidates, significantly expanding the known population. Their synchrotron peak frequencies are statistically higher than in previous studies, and they exhibit low Compton dominance, consistent with environments lacking strong external photon fields. A clear correlation between synchrotron peak frequency and the magnetic-to-kinetic energy density ratio is found, with the most extreme EHSPs nearing equipartition. Our analysis suggests that 9 high-synchrotron peaked/EHSPs could be observed by the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) at $>5\sigma$ (20 at $>3\sigma$) in 20-hour exposures, highlighting their potential to improve studies of extreme jet physics and cosmology.

 - **Abstract**
 The radial velocity (RV) method, also known as Doppler spectroscopy, is a powerful technique for exoplanet discovery and characterization. In recent years, progress has been made thanks to the improvements in the quality of spectra from new extreme precision RV spectrometers. However, detecting the RV signals of Earth-like exoplanets remains challenging, as the spectroscopic signatures of low-mass planets can be obscured or confused with intrinsic stellar variability. Changes in the shapes of spectral lines across time can provide valuable information for disentangling stellar activity from true Doppler shifts caused by low-mass exoplanets. In this work, we present a fixed effects linear model to estimate RV signals that controls for changes in line shapes by aggregating information from hundreds of spectral lines. Our methodology incorporates a wild-bootstrap approach for modeling uncertainty and cross-validation to control for overfitting. We evaluate the model's ability to remove stellar activity using solar observations from the NEID spectrograph, as the sun's true center-of-mass motion is precisely known. Including line shape-change covariates reduces the RV root-mean-square errors by approximately 70% (from 1.919 m s$^{-1}$ to 0.575 m s$^{-1}$) relative to using only the line-by-line Doppler shifts. The magnitude of the residuals is significantly less than that from traditional CCF-based RV estimators and comparable to other state-of-the-art methods for mitigating stellar variability.

 - **Abstract**
 Stars on the AGB can exhibit acoustic pulsation modes of different radial orders, along with non-radial modes. These pulsations are essential to the mass-loss process and influence the evolutionary pathways of AGB stars. P-L relations serve as a valuable diagnostic for understanding stellar evolution along the AGB. 3D RHD simulations provide a powerful tool for investigating pulsation phenomena driven by convective processes and their non-linear coupling with stellar oscillations. We investigate multi-mode pulsations in AGB stars using advanced 3D 'star-in-a-box' simulations with the CO5BOLD code. Signatures of these multi-mode pulsations were weak in our previous 3D models. Our focus is on identifying and characterising the various pulsation modes, examining their persistence and transitions, and comparing the results with 1D model predictions and observational data where applicable. We produced a new model grid comprising AGB stars with current masses of $0.7$, $0.8$, and $1\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. Fourier analysis was applied to dynamic, time-dependent quantities to extract dominant pulsation modes and their corresponding periods. Additionally, wavelet transforms were employed to identify mode-switching behaviour over time. The models successfully reproduce the P-L sequences found in AGB stars. Mode-switching phenomena are found in both the models and wavelet analyses of observational data, allowing us to infer similarities in the underlying pulsation dynamics. These 3D simulations highlight the natural emergence of multi-mode pulsations, including both radial and non-radial modes, driven by the self-consistent interplay of convection and oscillations. Our findings underscore the value of 3D RHD models in capturing the non-linear behaviour of AGB pulsations, providing insights into mode switching, envelope structures, and potential links to episodic mass-loss events.

 Adding a sine-type interaction to inflationary models with two fields can evoke a classical trajectory with many turns in field space. Under conditions we discuss, the enhancement of the spectrum of adiabatic fluctuations resulting from each turn adds up. A special range of scales away from the CMB-constrained region can then be enhanced by several orders of magnitude, allowing for interesting phenomenological possibilities, such as induced gravitational waves or primordial black holes. A localized version of this interaction can also be used as an add-on to conventional inflationary models, thus allowing the injection of the large peak in their power spectra. The intuition and the conclusions drawn from this simple model remain relevant for more complicated applications that usually include extra terms that obscure the simplicity of the mechanism.

 - **Abstract**
 The FIP (First Ionization Potential) bias is one of the most relevant diagnostics for solar plasma composition. Previous studies have demonstrated that the FIP bias is a time-dependant quantity. In this study, we attempt to answer the following question: how does the FIP bias evolves over time, and what are its drivers and parameters? We investigate active region (AR) observations recorded by the Extreme Ultra-Violet (EUV) spectrometer SPICE (Spectral Imaging of the Coronal Environment) instrument on-board Solar Orbiter. These observations include a set of EUV lines from ions emitting at temperatures ranging from $\log \text{T}=4.2$ to $\log \text{T}=6.0$. We focus on the period of December 20th to 22nd 2022 and look at the evolution of different physical quantities (e.g. intensity, temperature and fractionation of elements) within the passing AR present in the field of view (FOV). We investigate the time dependence of the FIP bias, particularly on the behavior of intermediate-FIP elements, sulfur and carbon, in regions of interest. We focus on the Mg / Ne ratio, which is a proxy for higher temperatures and higher heights in the atmosphere, and has been widely investigated in previous studies, and two lower temperature / upper chromosphere ratios (S/N, S/O and C/O). We investigate the FIP bias evolution with time but also with temperature and height in the solar atmosphere, and compare the observations with the ponderomotive force model. We find good correlation between the model and results, encouraging an Alfvén-wave driven fractionation of the plasma.

 Context. The Bondi spherical accretion solution has been used to model accretion onto compact objects in a variety of situations, from interpretation of observations to subgrid models in cosmological simulations. Aims. We aim to investigate how the presence of dark matter (DM) alters the dynamics and physical properties of accretion onto supermassive black holes on scales ranging from ~ 10 pc to the event horizon. Methods. In particular, we investigate Bondi-like accretion flows with zero and low specific angular momentum around supermassive black holes surrounded by dark-matter halos by performing 1D and 2.5D general relativistic hydrodynamics (GRHD) simulations using the black hole accretion code (BHAC). Results. We find notable differences in the dynamics and structure of spherical accretion flows in the presence of DM. The most significant effects include increases in density, temperature, and pressure, as well as variations in radial velocity both inside and outside the regions containing DM or even the production of outflow. Conclusions. This investigation provides valuable insights into the role of cosmological effects, particularly DM, in shaping the behavior of accretion flows and black holes (BHs). Our simulations may be directly applicable to model systems with a large black hole-to-halo mass ratio, which are expected to be found at very high redshifts.

 - **Abstract**
 The unexpectedly high nitrogen-to-oxygen (N/O) ratios observed in high-redshift (z) galaxies have challenged our understanding of early star formation. Notably, many of these nitrogen-rich galaxies show signatures of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), suggesting a possible connection between black hole formation and nitrogen enrichment. To explore this connection, we analyse stacked spectra of z=4-7 broad-line and narrow-line AGNs using deep NIRSpec data from the JADES survey. We identify a significant Niii] quintuplet and a high electron density ($\sim10^{4}\,\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$) only in the broad-line AGN stack, indicating nitrogen-rich ($\log(\mathrm{N/C})\simeq0.5$, $\log(\mathrm{N/O})>-0.6$) and dense gas similar to the high-z nitrogen-rich galaxies. Our findings suggest that dense nuclear star formation may trap nitrogen-rich gas in proto-globular clusters, in line with the high N/O observed in local globular clusters; associated runaway stellar collisions could produce intermediate-mass black hole seeds, as predicted by some models and simulations, whose accretion results into AGN signatures. These findings support scenarios connecting the early black hole seeding and growth to merging processes within and between proto-globular clusters in primeval galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 The blazar 3C 454.3 experienced a major flare in November 2010 making it the brightest $\gamma$-ray source in the sky of the Fermi-LAT. We obtain seven daily consecutive spectral-energy distributions (SEDs) of the flare in the infra-red, optical, ultra-violet, X-ray and $\gamma$-ray bands with publicly available data. We simulate the physical conditions in the blazar and show that the observed SEDs are well reproduced in the framework of a "standing feature" where the position of the emitting region is almost stationary, located beyond the outer radius of the broad-line region and into which fresh blobs of relativistically moving magnetized plasma are continuously injected. Meanwhile, a model with a single "moving blob" does not describe the data well. We obtain a robust upper limit to the amount of high-energy protons in the jet of 3C 454.3 from the electromagnetic SED. We construct a neutrino light curve of 3C 454.3 and estimate the expected neutrino yield at energies $\geq 100$ TeV for 3C 454.3 to be up to $6 \times 10^{-3}$ $\nu_{\mu}$ per year. Finally, we extrapolate our model findings to the light curves of all Fermi-LAT flat-spectrum radio quasars. We find that next-generation neutrino telescopes are expected to detect approximately one multimessenger ($\gamma + \nu_{\mu}$) flare per year from bright blazars with neutrino peak energy in the hundreds TeV -- hundreds PeV energy range and show that the electromagnetic flare peak can precede the neutrino arrival by months to years.
