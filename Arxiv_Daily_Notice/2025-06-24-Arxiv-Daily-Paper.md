 - **Abstract**
 The secondary anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) provide a wealth of astrophysical and cosmological information. Pairing measurements of the CMB temperature map obtained by DR5 of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) with the large-scale structure imaging survey conducted by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, DECaLS DR9, we investigate two effects that are sensitive to the gas density $\tau$: kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) and `patchy screening' (also known as `anisotropic screening'). In particular, we measure the stacked profiles around Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) at a mean redshift of $z \approx 0.7$. We detect the kSZ signal at 7.2$\sigma$, and we find a signal at $\sim 4.1\sigma$ for the patchy screening estimator, which is in excess relative to the kSZ signal. We attribute this excess to contamination from CMB lensing. We demonstrate the effect of lensing using $N$-body simulations, and we show that the screening signal is dominated by it. Accounting for lensing, our measurement places a 95\% upper bound on the optical depth of the Extended DESI LRG sample of $\tau <$ 2.5 $10^{-4}$ for a mean value of the sample of $\tau \approx$ 1.6 $10^{-4}$. Furthermore, via hydro simulations, we show that the underlying optical depth signal measured by both effects (after removing the CMB lensing contribution) is in perfect agreement when adopting either a Compensated Aperture Photometry (CAP) filter or a high-pass filter. Consistent with previous measurements, we see evidence for excess baryonic feedback around DESI LRGs in the patchy screening measurement. Provided both effects are measured with high signal-to-noise, one can measure the amplitude ratio between them, which is proportional to the root-mean-square velocity of the host halo sample, and place constraints on velocity-sensitive models such as modified gravity and phantom dark energy.

 - **Abstract**
 Detecting individual extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) is a major science goal of future space-based gravitational wave observatories such as Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) and TianQin. However, matched-filtering can be challenging as waveform templates are required to be accurate over tens of thousands of orbits. We introduce the time-frequency spectrum as an alternative observable that can be exploited to reveal the chirping of EMRIs at the population level. We analytically calculate this spectrum and its correlators for parameterized populations of slowly chirping sources on quasi-circular orbits, assuming a simplified model of the antenna response for a proof of concept. We then exploit this observable to distinguish between Galactic white dwarf binaries and a possible EMRI population, and quantify the precision at which EMRI population parameters can be determined through a Fisher analysis. We explore several scenarios of EMRI populations and find that this new method may allow us to determine EMRI population parameters at an accuracy level of several percent. Since white dwarf binaries have much longer chirping timescales than the EMRIs do, EMRI population properties can still be determined even if their stochastic gravitational wave background has a power spectrum two orders of magnitude weaker than that of the Galactic white dwarf binaries.
#### The AURORA Survey: Tracing Galactic Outflows at $z\gtrsim2.5$ with JWST/NIRSpec NUV Absorption Lines

 - **Abstract**
 We probe galactic-scale outflows in star-forming galaxies at $z\gtrsim2.5$ drawn from the JWST/NIRSpec AURORA program. For the first time, we directly compare outflow properties from the early universe to the present day using near-UV absorption lines. We measure ISM kinematics from Fe II and Mg II absorption features in 41 and 43 galaxies, respectively, and examine how these kinematics correlate with galaxy properties. We find that galaxies with outflows tend to have higher stellar masses, and that maximum outflow velocities increase with stellar mass, SFR, $\beta$, $E(B-V)$, and $A_V$. We also find that Mg II emission is more common in galaxies with lower masses, higher sSFRs, and less dust. These trends are consistent with those in star-forming galaxies at $z<2$ when using the same outflow tracers, suggesting that the feedback from star formation has played a persistent role in shaping galaxy evolution over cosmic time. We also directly compare near-UV and far-UV features in the same NIRSpec spectrum for a $z=5.19$ galaxy, finding consistent ISM kinematics and demonstrating that different tracers yield comparable measurements. We also detect Na D absorption in 10 galaxies, which have higher stellar mass, SFR, and dust attenuation compared to galaxies without Na D absorption, which is consistent with $z\sim0$ studies. The broad continuum coverage and sensitivity of NIRSpec will enable future studies with larger samples, allowing for robust tests of these trends across a wider dynamic range of galaxy properties.

 - **Abstract**
 Substructure in the interstellar medium (ISM) is crucial for establishing the correlation between star formation and feedback and has the capacity to significantly perturb stellar orbits, thus playing a central role in galaxy dynamics and evolution. Contemporary surveys of gas and dust emission in nearby galaxies resolve structure down to $\sim 10\,$pc scales, demanding theoretical models of ISM substructure with matching fidelity. In this work, we address this need by quantitatively characterizing the gas density in state-of-the-art MHD simulations of disk galaxies that resolve pc to kpc scales. The TIGRESS-NCR framework we employ includes sheared galactic rotation, self-consistent star formation and feedback, and nonequilibrium chemistry and cooling. We fit simple analytic models to the one-point spatial, two-point spatial, and two-point spatio-temporal statistics of the surface density fluctuation field. We find that for both solar neighborhood and inner-galaxy conditions, (i) the surface density fluctuations follow a log-normal distribution, (ii) the linear and logarithmic fluctuation power spectra are well-approximated as power laws with indices of $\approx -2.2$ and $\approx -2.8$ respectively, and (iii) lifetimes of structures at different scales are set by a combination of feedback and effective pressure terms. Additionally, we find that the vertical structure of the gas is well-modeled by a mixture of exponential and sech$^2$ profiles, allowing us to link the surface density statistics to those of the volume density and gravitational potential. We provide convenient parameterizations for incorporating realistic ISM effects into stellar-dynamical studies and for comparison with multi-wavelength observations.
#### Identifying Long Radio Transients with Accompanying X-Ray Emission as Disk-Jet Precessing Black Holes: The Case of ASKAP J1832-0911

 - **Abstract**
 Aims: In this work we investigate whether the 2 min bursts every 44 min from ASKAP J1832-0911 can be explained by Lense-Thirring precession of an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) accretion disk launching a Blandford-Znajek jet, as an alternative to magnetar or white-dwarf models. Methods: We derive the Lense-Thirring period $ P_{\rm LT}=\frac{\pi G M}{a c^3}r^3 $ and solve $P_{\rm LT}=44$ min for black-hole mass M and dimensionless radius $r=R/R_g$. We estimate the equipartition field B at r, compute the Blandford-Znajek power $P_{\rm BZ}$, and the power expected from a gap at the black hole magnetosphere, and compare the resulting jet luminosity to the observed radio and X-ray fluxes at $D\approx4.5$ kpc. We also evaluate expected high-frequency variability and the angular size for Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations. Results: For $a\sim0.3\!-\!0.9$, an IMBH with $M\sim10^3\!-\!10^5\,M_\odot$ yields $r\sim10\!-\!40\,R_g$ and $P_{\rm LT}=44$ min. Equipartition gives $B\sim10^5$ G at r, leading to $P_{\rm BZ}\sim10^{35\!-\!39}$ erg ${\rm s^{-1}}$. With radiative efficiency $\epsilon_j\sim10^{-2}\!-\!10^{-1}$, the predicted $L_{\rm jet}\sim10^{34\!-\!36}$ erg ${\rm s^{-1}}$ matches the observed $F_X\sim10^{-12}$ erg ${\rm cm^{-2}}$ ${\rm s^{-1}}$ and radio flux, variability on $\lesssim100$ s could be a smoking gun of this model. Conclusions:The IMBH precessing-jet model simultaneously explains the periodicity, energetics, and duty cycle of ASKAP J1832-0911. Only high-time-resolution X-ray timing (to check $\sim$s pulsations) and multi-frequency radio polarimetry can definitively distinguish it from magnetar or white-dwarf scenarios.
#### JWST reveals cosmic ray dominated chemistry in the local ULIRG IRAS 07251$-$0248

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze the ro-vibrational absorption bands of various molecular cations (HCO$^+$, HCNH$^+$, and N$_2$H$^+$) and neutral species (HCN, HNC, and HC$_3$N) detected in the JWST/MIRI MRS spectrum (4.9-27.9 $\mu$m) of the local ultra luminous infrared galaxy (ULIRG) IRAS~07251$-$0248. We find that the molecular absorptions are blueshifted by 160 km s$^{-1}$ relative to the systemic velocity of the target. Using local thermal equilibrium (LTE) excitation models, we derive rotational temperatures ($T_{\rm rot}$) from 42 to 185 K for these absorption bands. This range of measured $T_{\rm rot}$ can be explained by infrared (IR) radiative pumping as a byproduct of the strength, effective critical density, and opacity of each molecular band. Thus, these results suggest that these absorptions originate in a warm expanding gas shell ($\dot{M}$$\sim$90-330 $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$), which might be the base of the larger scale cold molecular outflow detected in this source. Finally, the elevated abundance of molecular cations (H$_3^+$, HCO$^+$, HCNH$^+$, and N$_2$H$^+$) can be explained by a high cosmic ray ionization rate, with log($\zeta_{\text{H}_2}$/n$_{\rm H}\, [\text{cm}^3 \text{s}^{-1}])$ in the range of -19.1 to -18.2, consistent with a cosmic ray dominated chemistry as predicted by chemical models.
#### The JWST/AURORA Survey: Multiple Balmer and Paschen Emission Lines for Individual Star-forming Galaxies at z=1.5-4.4. I. A Diversity of Nebular Attenuation Curves and Evidence for Non-Unity Dust Covering Fractions

 - **Abstract**
 We present the nebular attenuation curves and dust covering fractions for 24 redshift z=1.5-4.4 star-forming galaxies using multiple Balmer and Paschen lines from the JWST/AURORA survey. Nebular reddening derived from Paschen lines exceeds that from Balmer lines for at least half the galaxies in the sample when assuming the commonly-adopted Galactic extinction curve, implying the presence of optically-thick star formation. The nebular attenuation curves exhibit a broad range of normalizations (Rv ~ 3.2-16.4). Motivated by the offsets in reddening deduced from the Balmer and Paschen lines, and the high Rv values for the individual nebular attenuation curves, both of which suggest variations in the dust-stars geometry, we propose a model with a subunity dust covering fraction (fcov). Fitting such a model to the HI recombination line ratios indicates fcov ~ 0.6-1.0. The normalizations of the nebular attenuation curves, Rv, are driven primarily by fcov and the mix of optically-thick and thin OB associations. Thus, the diversity of nebular attenuation curves can be accommodated by assuming dust grain properties similar to that of Milky Way sightlines but with a subunity covering fraction of dust. Integrated measurements of multiple Balmer and Paschen lines can be used to place novel constraints on the dust covering fraction towards OB associations. These, in turn, provide new avenues for exploring the role of dust and gas covering fraction in a number of relevant aspects of high-redshift galaxies, including the impact of stellar feedback on ISM porosity and the escape of Ly-alpha and Lyman continuum radiation.

 - **Abstract**
 Protoplanetary discs are dynamic environments where the interplay between chemical processes and mass transport shapes the composition of gas and dust available for planet formation. We investigate the combined effects of volatile chemistry - including both gas-phase and surface reactions - viscous gas evolution, and radial dust drift on the composition of planetary building blocks. We explore scenarios of chemical inheritance and reset under varying ionisation conditions and for various dust grain sizes in the sub-mm regime. We simulate disc evolution using a semi-analytical 1D model that integrates chemical kinetics with gas and dust transport, accounting for viscous heating, turbulent mixing, and refractory organic carbon erosion. We find that mass transport plays a role in the chemical evolution of even sub-micron grains, especially in discs that have experienced strong heating or are exposed to relatively high levels of ionising radiation. The radial drift of relatively small icy grains can yield significant volatile enrichment in the gas phase within the snowlines, increasing the abundances of key species by up to an order of magnitude. Early planetesimal formation can lead to volatile depletion in the inner disc on timescales shorter than 0.5 Myr, while the erosion of refractory organic carbon can lead to markedly superstellar gas-phase C/O and C/N ratios. Notably, none of the analysed scenarios reproduce the monotonic radial trend of the gas-phase C/O ratio predicted by early models. Our results also show that a pairwise comparison of elemental ratios, in the context of the host star's composition, is key to isolating signatures of different scenarios in specific regions of the disc. We conclude that models of planet formation must concurrently account for the chemical and dynamical evolution of discs, as well as the diversity of their initial chemical and physical conditions.

 - **Abstract**
 Observing Population III (PopIII) galaxies, the hosts of first-generation stars, remains challenging even with the JWST. The current few candidates have been identified through the combination of a prominent HeII emission and the absence of metal lines, a well-known but extremely brief signature of metal-free systems. Here, we accurately model the evolution of the emission from PopIII galaxies to increase the number of candidates in JWST observations. To achieve this, we employ a locally calibrated galaxy-formation model that self-consistently follows the star formation and chemical evolution initiated by the first stars. We find that PopIII galaxies can emit metal lines in their ``self-polluted'' phase, while galaxies host only metal-free stars but the gas has been chemically-enriched by the first supernovae. In this phase, PopIII galaxies have $\rm [OIII]/H\beta \approx 1$, which opens the pool of candidates to more easily detectable sources. We predict that the high HeII emission of PopIII galaxies can last up to $\rm \approx 20 \, Myrs$ and that it is partly maintained in the ``hybrid'' phase, when PopIII and PopII stars co-exist in the host galaxy. We propose novel diagnostics involving UV metal lines to select PopIII candidates in high-z JWST surveys. In JADES, we identify 9 candidate galaxies with $>25\%$ of their stellar mass in metal-free stars, showcasing the effectiveness of our method. Ultimately, the key to discovering PopIII galaxies could be to catch them during their first episodes of chemical enrichment.
#### Standardizing a larger, higher-quality, homogeneous sample of reverberation-mapped H$β$ active galactic nuclei using the broad-line region radius-luminosity relation

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.17422

 - **Abstract**
 We present a high-quality, homogeneous sample of 157 H$\beta$ reverberation-mapped active galactic nuclei (RM AGNs) spanning redshifts $0.00308 \leq z \leq 0.8429$, which is approximately 3.8 times larger than the previously available high-quality homogeneous sample. Using the broad-line region radius$-$luminosity relation ($R-L$), which involves the broad H$\beta$ line time delay and the monochromatic luminosity at 5100\,Å\,, we show that the sample is standardizable by using six spatially flat and nonflat cosmological models. The inferred cosmological model parameters are consistent within 2$\sigma$ uncertainties with those from better established baryon acoustic oscillation and Hubble parameter measurements, with the exception of two nonflat models that are ruled out by other data. The $R-L$ relation slope is found to be flatter ($\gamma=0.428 \pm 0.025$ in the flat $\Lambda$CDM model) than the slope expected from a simple photoionization model as well as the slope found previously for the smaller homogeneous sample. In addition, we find a mild dependence of H$\beta$ $R-L$ relation parameters as well as its intrinsic scatter on the Eddington ratio by comparing the $R-L$ relations for low- and high-accreting equal-sized subsamples. A future analysis of a larger homogeneous sample containing a broader range of luminosities and Eddington ratios is necessary to confirm the standardizability of H$\beta$ AGNs.
#### X-ray emission signatures of galactic feedback in the hot circumgalactic medium: predictions from cosmological hydrodynamical simulations

 - **Abstract**
 Little is currently known about the physical properties of the hot circumgalactic medium (CGM) surrounding massive galaxies. Next-generation X-ray observatories will enable detailed studies of the hot CGM in emission. To support these future efforts, we make predictions of the X-ray emission from the hot CGM using a sample of 28 $\sim$Milky Way-mass disk galaxies at $z=0$ from seven cosmological hydrodynamical simulation suites incorporating a wide range of galactic feedback prescriptions. The X-ray surface brightness (XSB) morphology of the hot CGM varies significantly across simulations. XSB-enhanced outflows and bubble-like structures are predicted in many galaxies simulated with AGN feedback and in some stellar-feedback-only galaxies, while other galaxies exhibit more isotropic XSB distributions at varying brightnesses. Galaxies simulated without cosmic ray physics exhibit radial XSB profiles with similar shapes ($\propto r^{-3}$ within $20-200$ kpc), with scatter about this slope likely due to underlying feedback physics. The hot CGM kinematics also differ substantially: velocity maps reveal signatures of bulk CGM rotation and high-velocity biconical outflows, particularly in simulations incorporating AGN feedback. Some stellar-feedback-only models also generate similar AGN-like outflows, which we postulate is due to centrally-concentrated star formation. Simulations featuring AGN feedback frequently produce extended temperature enhancements in large-scale galactic outflows, while simulations incorporating cosmic ray physics predict the coolest CGM due to pressure support being provided by cosmic rays rather than hot CGM. Individually-resolved X-ray emission lines further distinguish hot CGM phases, with lower-energy lines (e.g., O VII) largely tracing volume-filling gas, and higher-energy lines (e.g., Fe XVII) highlighting high-velocity feedback-driven outflows.

 - **Abstract**
 The $1/f$ noise is a ubiquitous phenomenon in natural systems. Since the advent of space exploration, the $1/f$ range has been consistently observed in \textit{in situ} solar wind measurements throughout the heliosphere, sparking decades of debate regarding its origin. Recent Parker Solar Probe (PSP) observations near the Alfvén surface have revealed a systematic absence of the $1/f$ range in pristine solar wind, providing a unique opportunity to investigate its origin in solar wind turbulence. Despite numerous observations of the $1/f$ range at varying frequencies, no study has systematically examined its properties across different solar wind conditions. Here, we identify two distinct types of $1/f$ ranges in solar wind turbulence: the fast/Alfvénic wind type and the slow/mixed wind type. The fast/Alfvénic type appears to be an intrinsic feature of Alfvénic turbulence, while the slow/mixed type resembles classical flicker noise. For the fast/Alfvénic type, we find a near-perfect WKB evolution of the frequency-averaged fluctuation amplitude and an intriguing migration pattern in frequency space. For the slow/mixed type, we examine the solar cycle dependence of the $1/f$ noise using the OMNI-LRO dataset spanning solar cycles 22 to 25. We also analyze the autocorrelation function of the magnetic field vectors and identify a clear relationship between the $1/f$ range and the decline in correlation, as well as unexpected resonance peaks in the autocorrelation function.

 - **Abstract**
 The extreme magnification from galaxy clusters and microlenses therein allows the detection of individual, luminous stars in lensed galaxies as transient events, and hence provides a valuable window into the high mass stellar population in $z>1$ galaxies. As these bright stars can only be formed at specific ages, the relative abundance of transient events at blue (B) and red (R) optical wavelengths ($B/R$ ratio) can provide insights into the star formation history of lensed galaxies. Here, we forward model the transient detection rates in an idealized mock scenario to find that the $B/R$ ratio of strongly lensed $z>1$ galaxies decreases quickly with increasing age. This ratio has comparatively low sensitivity to metallicity and dust attenuation, with no significant dependency on the stellar initial mass function. As a proof-of-concept, we show that a simple starburst cannot simultaneously fit the $B/R$ and spectral energy distribution of the ``Warhol'' arc ($z = 0.94$), indicating a more complex (recent) star formation history. Although limited only to lensed higher redshift galaxies in cluster fields, this result shows that the transient $B/R$ ratio could be used as an additional, complementary constraint on the star formation history of higher redshift galaxies in future works.
#### The effect of plasma-$β$ on the heating mechanisms during magnetic reconnection in partially ionized low solar atmosphere

 - **Abstract**
 We performed numerical simulations of magnetic reconnection with different strength of magnetic fields from the solar photosphere to the upper chromosphere. The main emphasis is to identify dominant mechanisms for heating plasmas in the reconnection region under different plasma-$\beta$ conditions in the partially ionized low solar atmosphere. The numerical results show that more plasmoids are generated in a lower $\beta$ reconnection event. The frequent coalescence of these plasmoids leads to a significant enhancement of turbulence and compression heating, which becomes the dominant mechanism for heating plasma in a lower plasma-$\beta$ reconnection process. The average power density of the compression heating (Q$_{comp}$) decreases with increasing initial plasma-$\beta$ as a power function: Q$_{comp} \sim \beta_{0}^{-a}$, where the value $a$ is $1.9$ in the photosphere and decreases to about 1.29 in the upper chromosphere. In the photosphere and lower chromosphere, the joule heating contributed by electron-neutral collisions Q$_{en}=\eta_{en} J^2$ eventually dominates over the compression heating when the initial plasma-$\beta$ is larger than the critical value $\beta_{0-critical} = 8$. In the upper chromosphere, the ambipolar diffusion heating and the viscous heating will become equally important as the compression heating when the initial plasma-$\beta$ is larger than the critical value $\beta_{0-critical} = 0.5$. These results indicate that the compression heating caused by turbulent reconnection mediated with plasmoids is likely the major heating mechanism for the small-scale reconnection events with stronger magnetic fields such as active region EBs and UV bursts. However, the heating caused by the partial ionization effects can not be ignored for those reconnection events with weaker magnetic fields such as quiet Sun EBs and cold surges.
#### Binary Neutron Star Mergers as Potential Sources for Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays and High-Energy Neutrinos

 - **Abstract**
 Recent studies suggest that the most energetic cosmic rays, exceeding 100 EeV, may primarily consist of $r$-process nuclei. This highlights binary neutron star mergers and collapsars as promising sources of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). Building on these insights, we examine the conditions that facilitate the efficient production of UHE $r$-process nuclei during the prompt radiation (PR), extended emission (EE), and plateau emission phases of short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) following neutron star mergers. Our study reveals that jets associated with the PR phase, characterized by typical bulk Lorentz factors ($\gtrsim 400-500$), dissipation radii, and magnetic field strengths, can accelerate $r$-process nuclei to energies $\gtrsim 100$ EeV while preserving them during propagation within the source. Additionally, we investigate the production of HE neutrinos from photomeson and hadronic interactions, as well as from the $\beta$ decay of accelerated $r$-process nuclei. We find that the HE neutrino fluxes from sGRBs, mainly produced via photomeson interactions, are significantly limited to preserve the accelerated heavy nuclei, leading to lower fluxes than the predictions without allowing for contributions to UHECRs. Our results suggest that sGRBs may potentially contribute to UHECRs during the PR phase and to HE neutrinos during the EE phase$-$a scenario that can be tested by future neutrino observatories.

 [Abridged] We present a multi-line study of the kinematics of the molecular and ionised gas phases in the central 2 kpc of NGC6240, based on JWST/NIRSpec and ALMA observations. We devised a new spectral-line fitting approach to de-blend rotating and non-rotating gas components, which is better tailored to the extreme feedback mechanisms at work in NGC6240. We find that ~65% of the Pa$\alpha$, H$_2$, and [FeII] line fluxes within the NIRSpec field of view arise from gas components that are kinematically decoupled from the stars. The NIR H$_2$ lines show the most deviation from the stars, with peak emission between the two rotating stellar structures. The PAH 3.3$\mu$m feature does not follow the NIR H$_2$ morphology, indicating that the latter does not trace PDRs. In the non-rotating gas components, we identify a biconical wind launched from the northern AGN, expanding along the minor axis of stellar rotation. This wind is dominated by ionised gas and, although it entrains some H$_2$, it does not show a H$_2$/PAH enhancement, suggesting either high UV irradiation or expansion along a relatively gas-free path. Furthermore, we find bright non-rotating gas emission between the two AGN and around the southern AGN, which we interpret as due to an outflow launched from the southern nucleus, coinciding with the molecular outflow previously studied in cold (sub-)millimeter tracers. The strong H$_2$/PAH enhancement measured in this region, coextensive with high velocity redshifted gas ($v\sim900$ km s$^{-1}$), suggests that the shocks responsible for the high H$_2$/PAH ratios are due to the outflow rather than to the collision of media during the merger. Our results show that the bulk of the NIR line emission in NGC6240 is decoupled from the stars, and that most of the warm H$_2$ is shock-excited and embedded in a powerful outflow, where it coexists with colder molecular gas.

 - **Abstract**
 The gravothermal core collapse of self-interacting dark matter halos provides a compelling mechanism for seeding supermassive black holes in the early Universe. In this scenario, a small fraction of a halo, approximately $1\%$ of its mass, collapses into a dense core, which could further evolve into a black hole. We demonstrate that this process can account for the origin of JWST little red dots (LRDs) observed at redshifts $z\sim4-11$, where black holes with masses of $10^7{\rm\,M_\odot}$ can form within $500{\rm\,Myr}$ after the formation of host halos with masses of $10^{9}{\rm\,M_\odot}$. Even if the initial collapse region triggering general-relativistic instability has a mass on the order of one solar mass, the resulting seed can grow into an intermediate-mass black hole via Eddington accretion of baryonic gas. Subsequently, it can continue to grow into a supermassive black hole through dark Bondi accretion of dark matter particles. In this scenario, the majority of the black hole's mass originates from dark matter accretion rather than baryonic matter, naturally explaining the overmassive feature of LRDs.

 - **Abstract**
 The interstellar medium of galaxies, with temperatures reaching several million degrees, provides a pivotal perspective for understanding the physical and chemical properties of star formation, galactic evolution, and their associated feedback mechanisms. We use archival data from $Chandra$ observations to extract the diffuse X-ray emission from 23 nearby star-forming galaxies and study its correlation with star formation activity in the central region of these galaxies. The surface brightness profile of each galaxy presents a sharp decrease in the central region of $\thicksim$0.3$-$2 kpc and then varies slowly outside this range. Compared to the global relation between the diffuse thermal X-ray luminosity from hot gas ($L_{\rm 0.5 - 2\,keV}^{\rm gas}$) and the star formation rate (SFR), we found a super-linear relation of ${\rm log}(L_{\rm 0.5-2\,keV}^{\rm gas} /{\rm erg\,s^{-1}})=1.34\,{\rm log}({\rm SFR}/{M_{\rm \odot}}\,{\rm yr^{-1}})+40.15$ for the center of these sample galaxies. This result suggests that more intense stellar feedback is associated with stronger star formation activity in the central region of star-forming galaxies, where more energy output from supernovae (SNe) and stellar winds is converted into X-ray flux. Furthermore, the slope of the $L_{\rm 0.5 - 2\,keV}^{\rm gas}$$-$SFR relation anticorrelates with spatial scale in the galactic central region. This indicates that the characteristics of central hot gas emission are gradually averaged over larger areas. The diffuse X-ray luminosity also shows a good correlation with molecular gas, stellar mass, and mid-plane pressure traced by the baryonic mass, although these relations show relatively large scatter.

 - **Abstract**
 This work is the continuation of a series attempting to characterize the local warm ionized medium through both static and time dependent simulations. We build upon our three dimensional, observationally-derived simulation of the local photoionized interstellar medium - based on static photoionization simulations constrained by 3D dust maps - to include metals required to predict collisionally excited optical and infrared emission lines, providing the first all-sky prediction of a series of lines including [SII] 6716$\mathring{A}$, [NII] 6584$\mathring{A}$ and [OIII] 5007$\mathring{A}$. While these predictions only include O-star photoionization under ionization equilibrium, we also carry out a suite of radiation-hydrodynamics simulations including time-dependent metal ionization and the effects of supernova feedback to highlight missing features in our predicted skies. We use the simulations to estimate the very local (1 $\rm kpc^{2}$) Galactic star formation rate, finding a rate of 370 $\rm M_{\odot}~Myr^{-1}~kpc^{-2}$ provides the best match between the observationally-derived and ab-initio simulations. This is approximately a factor of four lower than previous estimates for the star formation rate required to support an observed layer of high-altitude diffuse ionized gas, possibly suggesting a `bursty' star formation history in the region surrounding the Sun. We also investigate the effects of O-star environments on their ability to ionize large volumes of diffuse ionized gas, and find it is likely ionized by a small number of luminous O-stars located in regions where the leakage of their Lyman continuum photons can produce the vast volumes of ionized gas observed in the midplane and at high galactic altitudes.

 - **Abstract**
 Astrometry with the very long baseline radio interferometry (VLBI) allows us to determine the position of a point close to the brightest compact detail of the source at milliarcsecond scales. For most active galactic nuclei (AGNs), this compact detail is the opaque core of the radio jet. Rare cases of sources whose brightest detail is not the core but a prominent jet feature parsecs away from the core have been reported, but such sources remained elusive. In this work, we use a novel method for a systematic search of these sources. We scrutinize the AGNs for which the offset between their coordinates determined with VLBI and Gaia is statistically significant and coincides with the vector between two dominant features in their VLBI images, using publicly available archival multi-frequency data. We find 35 sources whose VLBI coordinates are associated with a bright component of their jet separated by several to tens of mas from the radio core. Their Gaia coordinates, in turn, correspond to the jet origin and are close to the radio jet core. The previously published jet directions of most of them must be reversed. These sources exhibit atypically low brightness temperatures of the radio cores, down to 10^9 K in the host galaxy frame, and, at the same time, extreme brightness of the dominating jet components. We argue that these bright components are standing shock fronts and discuss possible physical reasons for the low core brightness, such as ineffective particle heating, atypical absorption, or differential Doppler boosting.

 We describe the discovery and characterization of TOI-7149~b, a 0.705 $\pm$ 0.075 $M_J$, 1.18 $\pm$ 0.045 $R_J$ gas giant on a $\sim 2.65$ day period orbit transiting an M4V star with a mass of 0.344 $\pm$ 0.030~$M_{\odot}$ and an effective temperature of 3363 $\pm$ 59 K. The planet was first discovered using NASA's TESS mission, which we confirmed using a combination of ground-based photometry, radial velocities, and speckle imaging. The planet has one of the deepest transits of all known main-sequence planet hosts at $\sim$ 12\% ($R_p/R_\star\sim 0.33$). Pushing the bounds of previous discoveries of Giant Exoplanets around M-dwarf Stars (GEMS), TOI-7149 is one of the lowest mass M-dwarfs to host a transiting giant planet. We compare the sample of transiting GEMS with a 200~pc Gaia colour magnitude diagram (CMD) and find that the GEMS hosts are likely to be high metallicity stars. We also analyze the sample of transiting giant planets using the non-parametric \texttt{MRExo} framework to compare the bulk density of warm Jupiters across stellar masses. We confirm our previous result that transiting Jupiters around early M-dwarfs have similar masses and densities to warm Jupiters around FGK stars, and extend this to mid M-dwarfs, thereby suggesting a potential commonality in their formation mechanisms.

 We present a systematic study of the recently reported anti-correlation between X-ray flux and photon index ($\Gamma$) in the Crab Nebula, using archival RXTE/PCA (3 - 50 keV), RXTE/HEXTE (20 - 100 keV), and NuSTAR (3 - 78 keV) observations. Spectra were extracted in soft (3 - 10 keV) and hard bands (10 - 50 keV, 10 - 78 keV, 20 - 100 keV) and fitted with an absorbed power-law model. Across all instruments and energy ranges, we confirm the existence of a persistent negative correlation -- harder spectra at higher flux levels. The correlation is stronger in the hard bands compared to the soft bands. This is consistent with synchrotron emission modulated by magnetic field variations in the pulsar wind nebula.

 We present a preliminary analysis of the largest Forbush Decrease (FD) observed in solar cycle 25 using SEVAN network data. Triggered by consecutive Earth-directed CMEs on May 30 and 31, 2025, this event produced two distinct FD minima and a prolonged recovery, with significant anisotropies in cosmic ray response across the network. The timing of interplanetary shock arrivals was confirmed by SSC signatures at 05:22 UTC on June 1 and 10:19 UTC on June 2, marking the onset of each FD phase. The depth and temporal structure of the FD varied across SEVAN detectors, providing insights into the complex heliospheric and magnetospheric dynamics during this multi-CME event.

 - **Abstract**
 The Cosmic Distance Duality Relation (CDDR), a fundamental assumption in modern cosmology, posits a direct link between angular diameter distance and luminosity distance. This study presents a comprehensive, model-independent, and data-driven test of the CDDR using a combination of cosmological observations, including Supernovae (SN), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), and Hubble parameter ($H(z)$) measurements. We employ both Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and a novel Compressed Point (CPI) method for reconstructing the CDDR, alongside four distinct parameterizations for potential deviations. Nuisance parameters, such as the supernova absolute magnitude and BAO scale, are rigorously handled via both joint numerical fitting (Method I) and analytic marginalization (Method II). Our findings reveal that while direct reconstruction of the CDDR exhibits no significant deviation (less than 1-$\sigma$) under specific prior assumptions, a notable departure emerges when the SH0ES prior is incorporated, suggesting a systematic influence from the Hubble constant tension. Independently, our parameterized analysis corroborates the consistency of CDDR and confirms the equivalence of the two constraint methodologies. We also find no significant evidence for cosmic opacity. A comparative assessment of reconstruction techniques indicates that GPR generally yields higher precision. These results emphasize the critical role of prior choices and statistical methods in CDDR analyses, providing valuable insights into fundamental cosmological principles and the ongoing Hubble tension.

 - **Abstract**
 We present initial results from the 4.8 GHz Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) survey of the JWST North Ecliptic Pole Time-Domain Field (TDF). From 106 radio sources found in the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array observations in the TDF, we detected 12 sources (11% detection rate) at 3.3 $\mu$Jy rms sensitivity and 4 mas resolution. Most detections exhibit pc-scale emission (less than 40 pc) with high VLBA/VLA flux density ratios and brightness temperatures exceeding 10$^5$ K, confirming non-thermal AGN activity. Spectral indices ($>$ -0.5) correlate with higher VLBA/VLA flux ratios, consistent with synchrotron emission from AGN coronae or jets. In the majority of our sources star formation contributes less than 50% of the total VLBA radio emission, with a few cases where the emission is almost entirely AGN-driven. Although the radio emission from radio quiet AGN is thought to be primarily driven by star formation, our VLBA observations confirm that there is also often a contribution at various levels from black hole driven AGN. Eight VLBA detections have JWST/NIRCam counterparts, predominantly early-type, bulge-dominated galaxies, which we use to get an estimate of the redshift and star formation rate (SFR). WISE colors indicate that VLBA detections are either AGN or intermediate-disk-dominated systems, while VLBA non-detections correspond to extended, star-forming galaxies. We compare SFRs derived from previous SCUBA-2 850 $\mu$m observations with new JWST-based estimates, and discuss the observed discrepancies, highlighting JWST's improved capability to disentangle AGN activity from star formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Filaments/prominences are cold plasma (~ 10000 K) embedded in the solar corona, two orders of magnitude hotter. Filament plasma is structured by the magnetic field in thin elongated threads. Counter-streaming flows have been observed. The aim of this paper is to characterize these flows. For that, we use high spatial resolution observations of spectral data obtained with THEMIS in H-alpha and with IRIS in Mg II k lines on 29 September 2023. We best detect counter-streaming flows in both the blue and red wings of these spectral lines. They are forming long Doppler shifted strands slightly inclined on the filament axis. The blue/red shift alternates across the strands at the arc second scale. H-alpha spectral profiles with large widths are interpreted as formed by multi-strands with opposite velocity directions. The absorption in the core of Mg II k line is also broader than in the chromosphere. This corresponds also to counter-streaming velocities. We derive that a fraction of the filament plasma is moving at supersonic speed (of the order of 20 km/s ) with the assumption that the filament is optically thick. We conclude that the counter-directed Doppler shifts might not be magnetic field aligned flows but rather correspond to kink transverse oscillations of the magnetic field with independent motions in nearby strands.

 - **Abstract**
 Characterizing and accurately decomposing galaxies into structural components, such as bulges and disks, is essential for understanding galaxy formation and evolution, particularly at high redshift, where galaxies are compact and faint. Leveraging the unparalleled resolution and sensitivity of JWST and imaging data from CEERs program, we simulate galaxies with bulge+disk components and assess the effectiveness of single and double Sérsic model fittings, respectively. We first evaluate the performance of single Sérsic fits, and find it can recover total magnitudes (i.e., within 0.5 mag), and size (i.e., within 0.2 dex), down to 27 mag. The features that emerged in the residual map can properly reflect the underlying two-component structures. We also show that Sérsic indices can serve as proxies for the bulge-to-total flux ratio (B/T). For double Sérsic models, we find comparable accuracy in recovering bulge and disk magnitudes (i.e., within 0.5 mag), and effective radius (i.e., within 0.2 dex), down to 26 mag. To quantitatively determine whether a double Sérsic model better describes our two-component systems compared to a single Sérsic profile, we evaluate the Bayesian Information Criterion for both model configurations. To extend the applicability of our results to other NIRCam programs, we evaluate the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the simulated galaxies and find that model parameters are reliably reproduced when the SNR exceeds 10. Our work demonstrates the detailed morphological measurement uncertainties using single and double Sérsic models, which provides an essential reference for future JWST/NIRCam-based morphological studies, especially for high-redshift galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 Strong both broad and narrow emission lines from central broad emission line regions (BLRs) and narrow emission line regions (NLRs) are fundamental spectroscopic characteristics of broad line Active Galactic Nuclei (BLAGNs). Lack of central BLRs leads to the identified true Type-2 AGNs without central hidden BLRs, providing clues on formation/suppression of AGN BLRs. Whether were there BLAGNs with lack of central NLRs is still an open question. Here, in the blue quasar SDSS J1251+0613, both blue continuum emissions and broad emission lines can be clearly detected in its SDSS spectrum, however there are no apparently detected narrow emission lines in the optical/NUV bands, leading to no central normal NLRs in the blue quasar SDSS J1251+0613. In order to explain the lack of NLRs, evolving NLRs is proposed that the radial outflows are carrying materials from BLRs to NLRs and the current narrow line emission materials are lying closer to the outer side of central BLRs in SDSS J1521+0613. The results in this manuscript can indicate a new unique subclass of BLAGNs, the BLAGNs without central normal NLRs, which will provide potential clues on physical origin/evolution of AGN NLRs.

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are expected to release much of their energy in the far-ultraviolet (UV), which we do not observe directly. However, infrared (IR) observations can observe re-radiation of the optical/UV emission from dust, and if this dust is observed in the process of sublimation, we can infer the un-observed UV radiated energy. TDEs have also been predicted to show spectra shallower than a blackbody in the IR, but this has not yet been observed. We present near/mid-IR observations of the TDE AT 2019azh spanning from -3 d before peak until >1750 d after. We evaluate these observations for consistency with dust emission or direct emission from the TDE. We fit the IR data with a modified blackbody associated with dust emission. The UV+optical+IR data are compared with simulated spectra produced from general relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamics simulations of super-Eddington accretion. We model the data at later times (> 200 d) as an IR echo. The IR data at the maximum light can not be self-consistently fit with dust emission. Instead, the data can be better fit with a reprocessing model, with the IR excess arising due to the absorption opacity being dominated by free-free processes in the dense reprocessing envelope. We infer a large viewing angle of $\sim$60$^{\circ}$, consistent with previously reported X-ray observations, and a tidally disrupted star with mass > 2 M$_{\odot}$. The IR emission at later times is consistent with cool dust emission. We model these data as an IR echo and find that the dust is distant (0.65 pc), and clumpy, with a low covering factor. We show that TDEs can have an IR excess not arising from dust and that IR observations at early times can constrain the viewing angle for the TDE in the unified model. Near-IR observations are therefore essential to distinguish between hot dust and a non-thermal IR excess.

 - **Abstract**
 Blazars, a highly energetic subclass of jetted active galactic nuclei, show a broad band spectral energy distribution (SED) with two bumps, resulting from non-thermal jet emission. In 1998, an anticorrelation between the SED luminosity and the peaks frequency was found, later confirmed in 2017, called the blazar sequence. Its origin is still unclear. This work is part of a broader effort aiming at giving a physical interpretation to the blazar sequence, by modeling the sources emission in a Synchrotron Self Compton framework, concentrating only on TeV-detected blazars of BL Lac type. Unlike the original sequence, sources were binned by synchrotron peak frequency. The SED of one representative source is modeled for each bin, using data from average activity state to ensure consistency. Here, we focus on the study of one of the selected representative sources, PKS 2155-304, a high-energy-peaked BL Lac, showing the performed data selection and preliminary modeling results.

 - **Abstract**
 A large fraction of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) in luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) remain undetected due to extremely high line-of-sight host galaxy dust extinction, and strong contrast between the SN and the galaxy background in the central regions of LIRGs, where the star formation is concentrated. This fraction of undetected CCSNe, unaccounted for by typical extinction corrections, is an important factor in determining CCSN rates, in particular at redshifts $z \gtrsim 1$, where LIRGs dominate the cosmic star formation. Our aim is to derive a robust estimate for the undetected fraction of CCSNe in LIRGs in the local Universe. Our study is based on the K-band multi-epoch SUNBIRD survey data set of a sample of eight LIRGs using the Gemini-North Telescope with the ALTAIR/NIRI laser guide star adaptive optics system. We used simulated SNe and a standard image subtraction method to determine limiting detection magnitudes for the data set. Subsequently, we used a Monte Carlo method to combine the limiting magnitudes with the survey cadence, and an adopted distribution of CCSN subtypes and their light curve evolution to determine SN detection probabilities. Lastly, we combined these probabilities with the intrinsic CCSN rates of the sample galaxies estimated based on their detailed radiative transfer modeling to derive the fraction of undetectable CCSNe in local LIRGs. For high angular resolution near-infrared surveys, we find an undetectable fraction of $66.0^{+8.6}_{-14.6}$\%, assuming that CCSNe with host extinctions up to $A_V$ = 16 mag are detectable, corresponding to the most obscured CCSN discovered in our data set. Alternatively, assuming a host extinction limit of $A_V$ = 3 mag, corresponding to typical optical surveys, we find an undetectable CCSN fraction of $89.7^{+2.6}_{-4.4}$\%.

 - **Abstract**
 Stably-stratified fluid layers are ubiquitous in gaseous planets, stellar and liquid cores, and have previously been thought not to be capable of driving a dynamo. We demonstrate that semiconvection (convection driven by a destabilising thermal gradient in an overall stably stratified region) can actually lead to dynamo action in such regions. Motivated by recent works suggesting that significant regions of Jupiter and Saturn may be prone to semiconvection, we conduct direct numerical simulations in spherical shells in the planetary relevant limit of low magnetic Prandtl numbers. We retrieve key characteristics of planetary magnetic fields, including dipolarity, magnetic field strength, and the form of the energy spectrum. This short demonstration opens the possibility for further more detailed studies of semiconvection dynamos, that can also be relevant for stellar interiors.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a long-term optical and X-ray photometric study of AN UMa, one of the prototypical polar-type cataclysmic variables, tracing more than 34 years of its accretion history. Observations from both ground-based and space-based facilities have been analysed to investigate state transitions within the system. Throughout this period, significant changes in the light curve have been observed, corresponding to different mass accretion states. From four years of TESS photometry, we derive a revised photometric period that agrees with the spectroscopic period to within 1.2$\sigma$. These optical observations further suggest switching between two accretion poles. During intervals of high accretion, dips in the X-ray light curve indicate that the primary accretion pole is obscured by an accretion stream elevated above the orbital plane, a feature also evident in the TESS light curves. Additionally, periodogram analysis reveals a periodicity of $\approx$437 days, which may be related to long-term accretion state changes. Following a 16-year high state, AN UMa entered two short-lived low states, lasting 180 and 123 days, during which it faded to a magnitude of 19.2, as recorded by the ZTF and ATLAS surveys. Using the system's low-state brightness and the distance provided by Gaia, we estimate that the system may have a white dwarf with an effective temperature of $\approx$15000~K, and a donor of spectral type M4.7. This work provides a useful reference for future studies of polars with variable accretion geometries and highlights the importance of long-term, multi-wavelength monitoring in the study of magnetic cataclysmic variables.

 - **Abstract**
 The paper discusses the possibility of implementing a plasma generation mechanism in a source of decameter radio emission associated with Ganymede and an explanation based on this mechanism of forming quasi-periodic sequences of bursts of this radiation. According to the discussed model, the registered quasi-periodic sequences of radiation pulses are a consequence of implementing in the source a pulsating mode of plasma wave conversion into extraordinary electromagnetic waves with a small refractive index. The negative frequency drift of the radiation observed in the frequency-time spectrogram is due to the group delay of waves with a small refractive index and the dispersion of the medium. Based on the plasma model, estimates of the plasma parameters in the generation region are obtained, which are in agreement with the data obtained as a result of satellite measurements.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar corona is much hotter than lower layers of the solar atmosphere-photosphere and chromosphere. The coronal temperature is up to 1MK in quiet sun areas, while up to several MK in active regions, which implies a key role of magnetic field in coronal heating. This means that understanding coronal heating requires reliable modeling of the underlying three-dimensional (3D) magnetic structure of an active region validated by observations. Here we employ synergy between 3D modeling, optically thick gyroresonant microwave emission, and optically thin EUV emission to (i) obtain and validate the best magneto-thermal model of the active region and (ii) disentangle various components of the EUV emission known as diffuse component, bright loops, open field regions, and "moss" component produced at the transition region. Surprisingly, the best thermal model corresponds to high-frequency energy release episodes, similar to a steady-state heating. Our analysis did not reveal significant deviations of the elemental abundances from the standard coronal values.

 - **Abstract**
 There exist inconsistencies between the bright and faint Gaia Celestial Reference Frame 3 (Gaia-CRF3), which manifests as a systematic rotation and needs to be independently estimated then corrected in future data releases. We collected 64 radio stars with VLBI astrometry, of which 16 have new VLBI observations with reference epochs close to Gaia. We estimated the orientation and spin biases of the bright Gaia-CRF3 by comparing VLBI radio star astrometry with their Gaia DR3 counterparts. We also attempted to estimate orientation by utilizing the a priori magnitude-dependent spin parameters derived from Gaia internal estimation. Our independent estimation of the orientation at G<10.5 is [-15\pm119, +330\pm139,+218\pm109] uas (J2016.0), and the spin ([+21\pm18, +52\pm20,-7\pm20] uas/yr) agrees with Gaia internal estimation within 1-sigma range. The orientation-only estimation suggests that the orientation bias of the bright Gaia-CRF3 may also be magnitude-dependent.

 - **Abstract**
 We observed a newly-discovered Galactic black hole X-ray binary Swift J1727.8$-$1613 with the European Very Long Baseline Interferometry Network (EVN) at 5 GHz. The observation was conducted immediately following a radio quenching event detected by the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA). The visibility amplitude evolution over time reveals a large-amplitude radio flare and is consistent with an ejection event. The data can be interpreted either as a stationary component (i.e., the radio core) and a moving blob, or as two blobs moving away from the core symmetrically in opposite directions. The initial angular separation speed of the two components was estimated to 30 mas d^{-1}. We respectively fitted a single circular Gaussian model component to each of 14 sliced visibility datasets. For the case of including only European baselines, during the final hour of the EVN observation, the fitted sizes exhibited linear expansion, indicating that the measured sizes were dominated by the angular separation of the two components. The 6-h EVN observation took place in a rising phase of an even larger 4-day-long radio flare, implying that the ejection events were quite frequent and therefore continuous radio monitoring is necessary to correctly estimate the power of the transient jet. Combined with X-ray monitoring data, the radio quenching and subsequent flares/ejections were likely driven by instabilities in the inner hot accretion disk.
