#### Living with Neighbors. VI. Unraveling the Dual Impact of Bars on Star Formation in Paired Galaxies Using DESI

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive investigation into the influence of stellar bars on star formation (SF) in galaxy pairs, using a large sample of low-redshift galaxies ($0.02$\,$<$\,z\,$<$\,$0.08$) from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys DR8. Our analysis examines whether bars enhance or suppress SF during pair interactions, and how these outcomes depend on the star-forming properties of companion galaxies. We find that bars either catalyze or inhibit SF in their host galaxies, depending on the companion's SF activity. In particular, barred galaxies paired with actively star-forming companions experience more pronounced central starbursts (with sSFR up to $\sim$\,2.5 dex higher) than unbarred counterparts, whereas those with passive companions often have suppressed SF (sometimes below isolated galaxy levels). The notion of the dual role of bars can reconcile conventional conflicting reports of bar-driven enhancement versus quenching of SF activity. Bars, well known to regulate kpc-scale dynamics, may also link to the impact of external environments: when a star-forming companion provides sufficient gas, bars drive central starbursts, whereas in gas-poor interactions, bars hasten gas depletion and contribute to SF suppression. This work highlights the necessity of accounting for both internal structure and companion properties to fully understand SF regulation in interacting galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 We use the THESAN radiation-hydrodynamics simulations to investigate how Lyman-$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) trace ionized bubble sizes during the Epoch of Reionization. We generate realistic LAE catalogs by combining accurate intrinsic Ly$\alpha$ production and intergalactic transmission with an empirical model for dust absorption and gas outflows. By calibrating to observationally-constrained Ly$\alpha$ luminosity functions, we reproduce the rapid decline in Ly$\alpha$ visibility toward higher redshifts while revealing mild tensions in LAE fractions near the end of reionization. Before the midpoint of reionization, galaxies within larger line-of-sight bubbles ($\gtrsim 10$ cMpc) have higher observed Ly$\alpha$ luminosity and equivalent width (EW), demonstrating that the evolving LAE fraction provides a practical statistical tracer for bubble size. These correlations weaken as percolation progresses and the IGM becomes increasingly ionized. In LAE selected samples with $L_{\text{Ly}\alpha} > 10^{41.5}\ \text{erg s}^{-1}$, Ly$\alpha$ properties correlate with bubble size more strongly than UV magnitude, especially at $z \gtrsim 7$. This simulation-based framework maps LAE selections to bubble-size statistics, clarifies biases in more idealized models, and will supply public catalogs to interpret current and forthcoming JWST and narrow-band LAE surveys in terms of the evolving topology of reionization.

 - **Abstract**
 The distribution of molecular gas on small scales regulates star formation and the growth of supermassive black holes in galaxy centers, yet the role of active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback in shaping this distribution remains poorly constrained. We investigate how AGN influence the small-scale structure of molecular gas in galaxy centers, by measuring the clumpiness of CO(3 - 2) emission observed with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in the nuclear regions (50 - 200 pc from the AGN) of 16 nearby Seyfert galaxies from the Galaxy Activity, Torus, and Outflow Survey (GATOS). To quantify clumpiness, we apply three different methods: (1) the median of the pixel-by-pixel contrast between the original and smoothed maps; (2) the ratio of the total excess flux to the total flux, after substracting the background smoothed emission; and (3) the fraction of total flux coming from clumpy regions, interpreted as the mass fraction in clumps. We find a negative correlation between molecular gas clumpiness and AGN X-ray luminosity (L_X), suggesting that higher AGN activity is associated with smoother gas distributions. All methods reveal a turnover in this relation around L_X = 10^{42} erg/s, possibly indicating a threshold above which AGN feedback becomes efficient at dispersing dense molecular structures and suppressing future star formation. Our findings provide new observational evidence that AGN feedback can smooth out dense gas structures in galaxy centers.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a near-infrared census of stellar large-amplitude variables (LAVs) observed by the Palomar Gattini-IR (PGIR) surveyor from 2019-2021. Over the three-year time period, PGIR performed a brightness-limited survey of the Northern sky (18,000 sq. deg) to J-band AB magnitudes of $\sim 13$ within and $\sim 15$ outside the Galactic plane. From 70 million stars detected in PGIR reference images, we provide a spectral and photometric library of the 128 largest amplitude stellar variables detected to median SNR > 10 for more than 50 epochs with more than 5 high-amplitude detections, peak-to-peak magnitudes $\geq$ 2, and von Neumann ratios $\leq$ 0.2. We obtained medium-resolution near-infrared spectra with TripleSpec on the 200-inch Hale Telescope at Palomar Observatory and SpeX at NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility. The spectral census consists of 82 evolved and dust-obscured Asymptotic Giant Branch stars, 16 R Coronae Borealis stars, 13 young-stellar or pre-main-sequence objects, 8 symbiotic binaries, 7 erratic carbon- and oxygen-rich giants, and 2 RV Tauri supergiants. The spectral and photometric dataset serves as an atlas of near-infrared LAVs and a repository of evolved stars, eruptive variables, and binary systems for future deeper infrared surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 Relativistic macroscopic plasma dynamics can be described by general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics. In many high-energy astrophysical settings, such as the interior dynamics of magnetized stars, the ideal GRMHD approximation, in which we assume infinite conductivity, provides an excellent description. However, ideal GRMHD neglects resistive effects that are essential for processes such as magnetic reconnection, dissipation, and magnetospheric dynamics. Incorporating resistivity into astrophysical plasma models accounts for the fact that plasmas in such environments are not perfect conductors. We present a resistive version of the GPU-accelerated GRMHD code GRaM-X, which evolves the full resistive GRMHD equations using the Z4c formalism for Einstein's equations. We implement a second-order implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta scheme to handle stiff source terms, obtain the primitive quantities from the conserved quantities using a one-dimensional recovery method, and employ the HLLE Riemann solver in combination with TVD and WENO reconstruction schemes. We validate the module using a range of standard tests, including 1D shocktubes, current sheets, Alfvén waves, 2D cylindrical explosions, and 3D TOV stars. The results of these tests demonstrate accurate recovery of the ideal MHD limit, correct resistive behavior, and stable evolution in dynamical spacetimes. Leveraging the GPU-accelerated resistive version of GRaM-X enables efficient large-scale simulations, paving the way for realistic studies of binary mergers, accretion flows, and relativistic jets within the framework of multi-messenger astrophysics.
#### Eccentric discs as a gateway to giant planets outward migration

 - **Abstract**
 Recent studies on planet-dominated Type II migration demonstrated the presence of a correlation between the direction of planet migration and the parameter K describing the depth of the planetary gap. It was found that high (low) value for K correspond to outward (inward) migration. In this paper we aim at understanding the mechanism driving inward/outward migration and why it correlates with the gap depth. We performed a suite of 2D, live-planet, long-term simulations of massive planets migrating in discs with the hydro-code Fargo3D. We focus on a range of planet masses (1-13 m_J) and disc aspect ratios (0.03-0.1) and analyze the evolution of orbital elements and gap structure. We also study the torque contributions from outer Lindblad resonances to investigate their role in the migration outcome. We find that, while all planets initially migrate inwards, those with high enough K eventually enter a phase in which the torque reverses sign and migration becomes outwards, until eventually stalling. This behavior is associated with eccentricity growth in the outer disc and changes in the gap structure. We identify the surface density ratio at the 1:2 and 1:3 outer Lindblad resonances as a key output diagnostic that correlates with the migration direction. This ratio regulates the migration for all the cases where the massive planet remains in an almost circular orbit and the outer gap region exhibits moderate eccentricity. This characteristic sequence of inward-reversal-outwards-stalling occurs for a variety of K values and thus further work is required to identify the simulation input parameters that determine the onset of this sequence. Our results suggest that outward migration in the planet-dominated regime is primarily governed by the relative importance of the 1:2 and 1:3 resonances and, therefore, the gap profile plays a crucial role in determining the direction of migration.
#### The Lensing Counter Narrative: An Effective Description of Small-Scale Clustering in Weak Lensing Power Spectra

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new formalism to separate large- and small-scale contributions to cosmic shear through $\textit{lensing counterterms}$ (LCT) inspired by effective field theory (EFT). Marginalizing over these LCTs isolates the large-scale cosmological signal in weak lensing power spectra while simultaneously constraining the impact of baryonic feedback or new physics (e.g. axion dark matter) at small scales. Our formalism removes the need for hard scale cuts in standard analyses, even when theoretical predictions are limited to below a physical cutoff $\Lambda$, resulting in significant improvements in constraining power -- up to $5\times$ smaller in the case of a LSST-Y10-like analysis without marginalizing over baryons when the analysis cutoff is set to $\Lambda = 1.0h$ Mpc$^{-1}$. We conduct a proof-of-principle analysis on the publicly available DES Y3 data, finding $S_8= 0.761\pm 0.045$ and $S_8 = 0.794\pm 0.040$ for analyses with cutoffs of $\Lambda = 0.5h$ Mpc$^{-1}$ and $1.0 h$ Mpc$^{-1}$, respectively, with no detection of modifications to small-scale clustering at $k > \Lambda$ beyond the predictions of collisionless dark matter in a $\Lambda$CDM universe. We make our $\texttt{JAX}$-based pipeline, $\texttt{gholax}$, integrated with intrinsic alignment predictions from the EFT of large-scale structure at 1-loop, publicly available.

 - **Abstract**
 Background: Axion-like particles (ALPs) are hypothetical particles that emerge in numerous theoretical extensions to the Standard Model. Their coupling to electromagnetic field implies that ALPs would mix with photons in the presence of external magnetic fields. As ALP phenomenology is governed by the mass and strength of its coupling, there is a subset of this parameter space in which this mixing would be expected to leave an imprint on the spectra of TeV gamma-ray sources. Data: In 2017, the VERITAS gamma-ray observatory recorded the second day of a dramatic flare of the radio galaxy NGC 1275, embedded at the center of the Perseus galaxy cluster. This serendipitous locale provides a spatially-extended magnetic field of strength O(10$\mu$G) through which escaping photons traverse, making it an excellent target to study ALPs. Methods: We analyze the VERITAS data of NGC 1275's 2017 flare with the gammapy analysis package. Extensive fitting and modeling are performed to ultimately conduct a likelihood analysis used to search for any evidence of a preference for ALPs and to explore the confidence with which constraints can be set. We adopt the CLs method for this study for its conservative approach to setting limits in regimes where the search has limited sensitivity. Results: No evidence for the existence of ALPs is found, and no combination of mass and coupling strength can be excluded at or above 95% confidence level. We provide a map showing the strength of our exclusions in the mass and coupling parameter space. The strongest exclusions are found in the mass range $2 \times 10^{-7}$eV $\lesssim m_a \lesssim 4 \times 10^{-7}$eV and at the coupling strength of $g_{a\gamma} \gtrsim 3 \times 10^{-11}$ GeV$^{-1}$ up to 80% confidence level, which are consistent with previous studies. Conclusions: We find the CLs method to be a trustworthy approach, and advocate for its...
#### Hubble tension in an anisotropic Universe

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the Hubble tension within an anisotropic cosmological framework by revisiting the Bianchi type-I model introduced in Le Delliou et al. 2020. Motivated by ongoing debates surrounding back-reaction effects and observed anomalies in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), we investigate whether a departure from isotropy in the late Universe could reconcile the observed discrepancies in Hubble constant measurements. Using a Bayesian inference framework, we constrain the model parameters employing multiple nested sampling algorithms: bilby, PyMultiNest, and nessai. We perform the analysis under both uniform and Gaussian priors, allowing us to systematically assess the sensitivity of the inferred cosmological parameters to different prior assumptions. This dual-prior strategy balances agnostic parameter exploration with constraints informed by theory and observation. Our findings demonstrate the reliability of our inference pipeline across different samplers and emphasize the crucial role of prior selection in non-standard cosmological model testing. The results suggest that anisotropic models remain viable contenders in addressing current cosmological tensions: even though the present model does not show alleviation of the Hubble tension, the data points towards anisotropies. Future work may extend this methodology to more complex anisotropic scenarios and incorporate additional cosmological probes such as CMB polarization and gravitational wave standard sirens.
#### Linking Magnetic Field Diagnostics with 3D CME Speeds in Solar Active Regions

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding how active-region properties influence coronal mass ejection (CME) dynamics is essential for constraining eruption models and improving space-weather prediction. Magnetic diagnostics derived above polarity inversion lines (PILs), including the critical height ($h_{\rm crit}$) of torus instability onset, the overlying field strength ($B_{\rm t}$), and ribbon flux ($R_{\rm f}$), provide physically motivated measures of eruption onset. The two main aims of this work are to (i) show that $h_{\rm crit}$ and $B_{\rm t}$ can equally well predict CME speeds when evaluated over the region of interest (ROI) not directly above the PIL, and (ii) assess the value of $h_{\rm crit}$, $B_{\rm t}$ and $R_{\rm f}$ in predicting CME speed. Photospheric magnetograms are modeled with potential-field extrapolations to obtain decay index profiles. Critical heights above PILs correlate strongly with 3D CME speed ($r = 0.71$). Using ROIs of $\approx$ 1.8, 3.7, and 7.3 Mm), centered on the PIL, weighted $h_{\rm crit}$ from the 7.3x7.3 ROI provides the strongest correlation ($r = 0.73$), while mean $B_{\rm t}$ at 150 Mm is weaker ($r = 0.33$). Combining both offers little improvement ($r = 0.74$), confirming $h_{\rm crit}$ as the dominant predictor. CME speed correlates moderately with $B_{\rm t} \times R_{\rm f}$ ($r = 0.44$), and highest when combined with $h_{\rm crit}$ ($r = 0.76$). Thus, in potential field models, ROI-based critical heights are as predictive as those above the PIL, indicating that the broader active-region field structure is equally valid as a diagnostic. When all parameters are considered together, $h_{\rm crit}$ alone consistently shows the highest predictive power for CME speed.
#### Fast Radio Bursts

 - **Abstract**
 Eighteen years after their discovery, the astronomical sources and radiation mechanisms of fast radio bursts remain mysterious. Their radiation is as bright as that of pulsars, with brightness temperatures as high as $\sim 10^{36}$ K, implying coherent emission, but the plasma physics that forms the coherent charge bunches, with net charges of order a Coulomb, is not understood. Some FRB have been identified with galaxies at redshifts of a few tenths, but one originated within a globular cluster in the galaxy M81 at a distance of 3.6 Mpc. A minority of FRB have been observed to repeat, in some cases thousands of times. The vast majority of FRB have not been observed to repeat, but it is not known if they are truly ``one-offs'' or repeat at unobservably long intervals. Some FRB originate within dense, rapidly varying, plasma environments, while others appear to be surrounded by high vacuum. Hypotheses for their sources include magnetars and black hole accretion discs.
#### $H_0$ Without the Sound Horizon (or Supernovae): A 2% Measurement in DESI DR1

 - **Abstract**
 The sound horizon scale $r_s$ is a key source of information for early-time $H_0$ measurements, and is therefore a common target of new physics proposed to solve the Hubble tension. We present a sub-2% measurement of the Hubble constant that is independent of this scale, using data from the first data release of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI DR1). Building on previous work, we remove dependency on the sound horizon size using a heuristic rescaling procedure at the power spectrum level. A key innovation is the inclusion of \emph{uncalibrated} (agnostic to $r_s$) post-reconstruction BAO measurements from DESI DR1, as well as using the CMB acoustic scale $\theta_*$ as a high-redshift anchor. Uncalibrated type-Ia supernovae are often included as an independent source of $\Omega_m$ information; here we demonstrate the robustness of our results by additionally considering two supernova-independent alternative datasets. We find somewhat higher values of $H_0$ relative to our previous work: $69.2^{+1.3}_{-1.4}$, $70.3^{+1.4}_{-1.2}$, and $69.6^{+1.3}_{-1.8}\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$ respectively when including measurements from i) Planck/ACT CMB lensing $\times$ unWISE galaxies, ii) the DES Year 3 6$\times$2pt analysis, and iii) Planck/ACT CMB lensing + the DES Year 5 supernova analysis. These remarkably consistent constraints achieve better than 2% precision; they are among the most stringent sound horizon-independent measurements from LSS to date, and provide a powerful avenue for probing the origin of the Hubble tension.

 - **Abstract**
 Early interaction of supernova blast waves with CSM has the potential to accelerate particles to PeV energies, although this has not yet been detected. Current models for this interaction assume the shock expands into a smooth stellar wind, although observations of many SNe do not support this assumption. We extend previous work by considering shocks expanding into complex density profiles consisting of smooth winds with dense CSM shells at various distances from the progenitor star. We aim to predict the gamma-ray and multiwavelength signatures of CSM interaction. We used the PION code to model the CSM around LBV including a brief episode of enhanced mass-loss and to simulate the formation of photoionization-confined shells around RSGs. Consequently, we used the time-dependent acceleration-code RATPaC to study the acceleration of cosmic rays in SNe expanding into these media and to evaluate the emitted radiation across the whole electromagnetic spectrum. We find that the interaction with the CSM shells can significantly boost the gamma-ray emission, with the emission peaking weeks to years after the explosion. The peak luminosity for Type-IIP and Type-IIn remnants can exceed the luminosity expected for smooth winds by orders of magnitude. For Type-IIP explosions, the light-curve peak is only reached years after the explosion. We evaluate the multiwavelength signatures expected from the interaction of the blast wave with a dense CSM shell from radio, over optical, to thermal X-rays. We identify high-cadence optical surveys and continuous monitoring of nearby SN in radio and mm wavelengths as the best-suited strategies for identifying targets that should be followed-up by gamma-ray observatories. We predict that gamma-rays from interaction with dense CSM shells may be detectable out to a few Mpc for late interaction, and tens of Mpc for early interaction.
#### WALLABY: an untargeted search for H I-bearing ultra-diffuse galaxies uncovers the first known ultra-diffuse galaxy pair

 - **Abstract**
 Using the Widefield ASKAP L-band Legacy All-sky Blind surveY (WALLABY) we performed an untargeted search for H I-bearing ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs). We identified a core sample of 10 UDGs defined by $\mu_{g,0}\ge24$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$ and $R_{e}\ge1.5$ kpc, and a broader sample including 12 additional faint diffuse galaxies ($\mu_{g,0}\ge23.7$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$ and $R_{e}\ge1.3$ kpc). Within the core sample, we highlight the first discovery of a UDG pair. Their projected separation is just 75 arcsec (22 kpc at 61.9 Mpc), with a central H I velocity difference of 34 km s$^{-1}$. The North-Western UDG (WALLABY J104513-262755-UDG-1) has a larger H I reservoir, $\log_{10}(M_{HI}/\rm M_{\odot}) = 8.95\pm0.03$, compared to the South-Eastern UDG (WALLABY J104513-262755-UDG-2), $\log_{10}(M_{HI}/\rm M_{\odot}) = 8.60\pm0.04$. UDG-1's stellar mass and star formation rate are also approximately an order of magnitude larger at $\log_{10}(M_*/\rm M_{\odot}) = 8.07\pm0.12$ and $\log_{10}(SFR/\rm M_{\odot}~yr^{-1}) = -1.26\pm0.12$ respectively. The pair has an isolated local environment, with no other galaxies or H I sources within 30 arcmin (525 kpc) and $\pm1000$ km s$^{-1}$. However, in the context of the larger-scale structure, the pair is located outside the virial radius of the Hydra cluster, with its position on the phase-space diagram indicating that it is infalling into the cluster. The identification of this H I-bearing UDG pair raises important questions around the formation of such a unique system and the evolution of UDGs in a transitional phase before ram pressure stripping and cluster infall.

 - **Abstract**
 Numerous astronomical and cosmological observations point to the existence of dark matter, which constitutes about 27% of the Universe. Despite extensive efforts, only the DAMA/LIBRA experiment, using NaI(Tl) detectors at Gran Sasso National Laboratory, has reported a positive dark matter signal. To independently verify this result, using the same NaI target is essential. This is the goal of ANAIS-112, operating with 112.5 kg of NaI(Tl) scintillators since 2017 at the Canfranc Underground Laboratory (LSC). This thesis presents work within ANAIS-112, focusing on data analysis and the development of Geant4-based simulations to reduce systematics and increase sensitivity. Efforts have focused on understanding the ANAIS-112 crystals' response to nuclear recoils. Systematic uncertainties related to the scintillation quenching factors (QFs) of sodium and iodine recoiling in NaI(Tl) must be addressed to ensure reliable comparisons with DAMA/LIBRA and other experiments. For that purpose, onsite neutron calibrations in ANAIS-112 have been performed since 2021 at LSC using 252Cf sources. This work has compared calibration data with Geant4-based neutron simulations, which has revealed Geant4 deficiencies in certain decay processes and cross sections in some versions. The simulations have proven highly sensitive to the QF used, favouring models in which the QF increases with energy and disfavouring DAMA values. In parallel, this thesis has contributed to improving the ANAIS-112 background model through a multiparametric fit of its background components. New physics searches have been conducted using ANAIS-112 data, including a reanalysis of the annual modulation signal and a search for solar axions using six years of exposure. Finally, this thesis also includes work within the COSINUS experiment, focused on background modelling and the impact of internal backgrounds on the experiment's sensitivity.

 - **Abstract**
 Jets from active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are expected to heat the surrounding intracluster medium (ICM). We investigate how the interaction between jets and the ICM appears in high-resolution X-ray observations using mock X-ray observations based on two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations. We constructed a model of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) similar to Cygnus A (Cyg A), a powerful FR II radio galaxy. Our simulations model bipolar jets propagating into a stratified ICM, forming forward shocks and low-density cocoons. Based on these results, we generate synthetic spectra that incorporate both shocked and unshocked ICM components. Then, we perform mock observations using the XRISM/Resolve X-ray spectrometer. We focus particularly on viewing angle effects. Our mock observations revealed that the smallest line broadening, observed as velocity dispersion, associated with the cocoon's bulk expansion occurs when observing along the jet direction, where the expansion velocity is highest. Although this may appear counterintuitive, it occurs because the rapidly expanding jet head contributes little to X-ray emission due to its high temperature and low density. Our results highlight the importance of considering the temperature and density structure of AGN-driven shocks and cocoons when interpreting XRISM data. These findings lay the groundwork for XRISM's observations of AGN jets and will improve our understanding of AGN feedback processes in galaxy clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 Powerful ionized accretion disk winds are often observed during episodic outbursts in Galactic black hole transients. Among those X-ray absorbers, \fexxvi\ doublet structure (Ly$\alpha_1$+Ly$\alpha_2$ with $\sim 20$eV apart) has a unique potential to better probe the underlying physical nature of the wind; i.e. density and kinematics. We demonstrate, based on a physically-motivated magnetic disk wind scenario of a stratified structure in density and velocity, that the doublet line profile can be effectively utilized as a diagnostics to measure wind density and associated velocity dispersion (due to thermal turbulence and/or dynamical shear motion in winds). Our simulated doublet spectra with post-process radiative transfer calculations indicate that the profile can be (1) broad with a single peak for higher velocity dispersion ($\gsim 5,000$ km~s$^{-1}$), (2) a standard shape with 1:2 canonical flux ratio for moderate dispersion ($\sim 1,000-5,000$ km~s$^{-1}$) or (3) double-peaked with its flux ratio approaching 1:1 for lower velocity dispersion ($\lsim 1,000$ km~s$^{-1}$) in optically-thin regime, allowing various line shape. Such a diversity in doublet profile is indeed unambiguously seen in recent observations with XRISM/Resolve at microcalorimeter resolution. We show that some implications inferred from the model will help constrain the local wind physics where \fexxvi\ is predominantly produced in a large-scale, stratified wind.
#### Revisiting the Radio Lateral Distribution Function: An amplitude dependence on $X_{\rm max}$ and primary composition

 - **Abstract**
 We show that there is a strong dependence of the radio LDF electric field amplitudes at ground level on the position of $X_{\rm max}$ in the atmosphere, even accounting for differences in the EM energy of the showers. Since an $X_{\rm max}$ dependence leads to a primary composition dependence, this implies that information on the mass composition is encoded not only in the LDF shape but also in its amplitude. This $X_{\rm max}$ dependence can be explained in terms of two competing scalings of the measured electric field: One goes with $(1/\rho)^J$, where $\rho$ is the air density at $X_{\rm max}$ and $J$ is a zenith dependent non-linearity factor describing coherence loss. This density scaling tends to decrease the geomagnetic emission of deeper showers. The other scaling goes with $(1/R)$, where $R$ is the distance from $X_{\rm max}$ to the core at ground, and instead increases the measured electric field of deeper showers. At low zenith angles, the $(1/R)$ scaling is stronger and leads to larger measured electric fields as $X_{\rm max}$ increases. The picture at higher zeniths, i.e., lower densities, is more nuanced. In this region, the deflections due to the Lorentz force are much larger and introduce extra time delays between the particle tracks, decreasing the coherence of the emission. This loss of coherence is highly dependent on the strength of the geomagnetic field and can slow down, or even reverse the increase of the radio emission with decreasing air density. This strong, yet historically overlooked LDF amplitude dependence on $X_{\rm max}$/composition could be used to directly infer, even bypassing any $X_{\rm max}$ reconstruction, the cosmic ray primary composition on an event-by-event basis. It could also have some repercussions on other radio reconstruction methods, such as a possible $X_{\rm max}$/composition bias on shower electromagnetic energy reconstruction methods.

 - **Abstract**
 The Standard Model of particle physics successfully describes all known fundamental particles and their interactions; however, it leaves several unanswered questions. Theories beyond the Standard Model typically introduce new particles and symmetries to address these issues. In the early universe, when such particles become non-relativistic, or the symmetries are broken, there are associated reductions in the equation of state of the primordial plasma. These reductions lead to an exponential enhancement in the formation rate of primordial black holes. In this paper, we calculate the equation of state for several supersymmetric and composite Higgs models, which naturally predict a large number of additional degrees of freedom. Using these equations of state, we compute some example primordial black hole abundances, which we find can be enhanced by up to 20 orders of magnitude.
#### On the origin of ~ 100 TeV neutrinos from the Seyfert galaxy NGC 7469

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of TeV-PeV neutrinos detected by IceCube remains largely unknown. The most significant individual neutrino source is the close-by Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068 at 4.2$\sigma$ level with a soft spectral index. Another notable candidate is the Seyfert galaxy NGC 7469, which has been recently proposed as a potential neutrino emitter. The likelihood fit of the IceCube data for this source returned a very hard spectral index of ~ 1.9 and the excess is dominated by two high-energy events, issued as two neutrino alerts IC220424A and IC230416A. The energies of the two neutrinos are estimated to be 100-200 TeV, implying a maximum proton energy > 2 PeV, significantly higher than that in NGC 1068. The lack of lower-energy neutrinos from NGC 7469 also suggests a neutrino spectrum harder than that of NGC 1068. In this paper, we analyze the Fermi-LAT observations of NGC 7469, which yield non-detection. By requiring the cascade flux accompanying neutrino production not to exceed the upper limit of the GeV flux, the size of the neutrino-emitting region can be constrained when the neutrino flux takes a high value of the allowed range. We suggest that protons are accelerated to PeV energies via turbulence or magnetic reconnection in the corona of NGC 7469 and interact with OUV photons from the accretion disk and X-rays from the corona through the $p\gamma$ process, producing neutrinos with energy of 100-200 TeV. In the turbulence acceleration scenario, the required maximum proton energy can be achieved with a magnetization parameter close to unity ($\sigma\sim 1$), while in the reconnection scenario, a magnetization parameter with $\sigma\sim 10$ is needed. In both scenarios, a pair dominated composition for the corona is preferred. The difference in the neutrino spectrum between NGC 7469 and NGC 1068 could be due to a different magnetization despite that they belong to the same type of AGN.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate whether combining gas and stellar kinematic maps provides measurable advantages in recovering galaxy mass profiles, compared to using single-component maps alone. While traditional methods struggle to integrate multi-tracer data effectively, we test whether deep learning models can leverage this joint information. We develop a probabilistic convolutional neural network (CNN) framework trained and tested on mock galaxy kinematic maps from multiple cosmological simulation suites. Our model is trained on gas-only, stars-only, and combined gas+stellar velocity maps, allowing direct comparison of performance across tracers. To assess robustness, we include simulations with differing feedback models and galaxy properties. Combining gas and stellar maps reduces the dispersion in the inferred mass profiles by up to a factor of $\sim$1.5 compared to models using either tracer independently. The CNN architecture effectively captures complementary information from the two components. However, we find limitations in generalizing between simulation suites, with reduced performance when applying models trained on one suite to galaxies from another.
#### The magnetic sensitivity of the Ca II resonance and subordinate lines in the solar atmosphere

 - **Abstract**
 Aims: The polarization of the Ca II resonant doublet (H and K lines) and the subordinate infrared triplet lines are key observables for diagnosing solar chromospheric magnetism. It is thus necessary to understand the physical mechanisms that shape their Stokes profiles in magnetic environments. Methods: Using the spectral synthesis module of the HanleRT-TIC code, we study the effects of anisotropic radiation pumping with partial frequency redistribution (PRD) and J-state interference (JSI) in a plane-parallel semi-empirical static solar atmospheric model. We also analyze the sensitivity of these lines to magnetic fields of varying strengths and orientations, accounting for the combined action of the Hanle and Zeeman effects. Results: Including PRD is crucial to model the polarization in the core regions of the resonant lines, while JSI strongly affects their far wings. The metastable lower levels of the subordinate lines also influence the scattering polarization of the K line. With horizontal magnetic fields, the resonant lines respond to field strengths from sub-gauss to tens of gauss, whereas the infrared triplet scattering polarization is mainly sensitive to milligauss fields. At a near-limb line of sight (LOS) with $\mu = 0.1$, the Hanle effect modifies the scattering polarization via a depolarization and a rotation in the plane of linear polarization. At disk center, horizontal fields generate linear polarization in the 1D model: for the K line, the Hanle effect dominates from sub-gauss to a few tens of gauss, and the Zeeman effect dominates in stronger fields. For vertical fields, the Hanle effect vanishes, but magneto-optical effects affect the linear polarization wings. Finally, atomic level polarization impacts the outer circular polarization lobes of the resonant lines, and the weak-field approximation overestimates the LOS magnetic component in this frequency range.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of neutrino-driven magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves and instabilities in a rotating magnetoplasma with weak neutrino interactions. We show, for the first time, that neutrino-driven shear Alfv{é}n and oblique magnetosonic waves can be coupled by the Coriolis force, forming new wave modes affected by this force, as well as neutrino beam and two neutrino flavor oscillations. Our work extends previous theories by demonstrating that shear Alfv{é}n waves are influenced by neutrino effects and by identifying instabilities resulting from resonant interactions with both a streaming neutrino beam and flavor oscillations. We find that the Coriolis force, as well as plasma density and magnetic field strength, have a significant impact on the profiles of the instability growth rates. Our findings may shed new light on the physical mechanisms underlying core-collapse supernovae.

 - **Abstract**
 Radio observations provide a window into a planet's interior and play a crucial role in studying its atmosphere and surface, key factors to find potential habitability. The discovery of thousands of exoplanets, together with advances in radio astronomy through the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), motivates the search for planetary-scale radio emissions. Here, we employ the radiometric Bode's law (RBL) and machine learning techniques to analyze a dataset of 1330 confirmed exoplanets, aiming to estimate their potential radio emission. Permutation Importance (PI) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analyses indicate that a planet's mass, radius, orbital semi-major axis, and distance from Earth are sufficient to dependably forecast its radio flux and frequency. The random forest model accurately reproduces these radio characteristics, confirming its reliability for exoplanetary radio predictions. Considering observational constraints, we find that 64 exoplanets could generate signals detectable by the SKA, 52 of which remain observable in the intermediate AA* deployment. Among these, MASCARA-1 b stands out with a predicted flux of 7.209 mJy at 135.1 MHz, making it an excellent SKA-Low target. Meanwhile, WASP-18 b, with a flux of 18.638 mJy peaking at 812.9 MHz, is the most promising candidate for SKA-Mid. These results show that the SKA can detect gas giants, such as MASCARA-1 b (SNR>400) and WASP-18 b (SNR>4236), within feasible integration times. Additionally, we identify four candidates (HATS-18 b, WASP-12 b, WASP-103 b, and WASP-121 b) that are likely affected by radio quenching, highlighting the importance of considering this effect in target selection for observation campaigns.
#### Detecting gravitational lensing by matter currents

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the observational prospects for detecting gravitational lensing induced by cosmological matter currents, a relativistic correction to the standard scalar lensing effect arising from the motion of matter. We propose to isolate this contribution by cross-correlating the weak-lensing convergence field with a reconstructed cosmic momentum field inferred from galaxy surveys. Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate that this reconstructed momentum field is uncorrelated with the scalar lensing signal, enabling a clean separation of the gravitomagnetic component. We then forecast the detectability of this signal for upcoming wide-field galaxy and weak-lensing surveys, showing that a statistically significant detection may be achievable under realistic observational conditions. Such a measurement would provide the first direct probe of the large-scale cosmic momentum field, offering a novel test of general relativity and Lorentz invariance on cosmological scales.

 - **Abstract**
 Aims: We carried out a detailed investigation of Lithium and CNO abundances, including carbon isotope ratios, in RS CVn stars to assess the role of magnetic activity in the mixing of stellar atmospheres. Methods: We obtained high-resolution spectra at the Moletai Astronomical Observatory. Lithium abundances were determined by spectral synthesis of the 6707 A line and the CNO abundances using the C2 band heads at 5135 and 5635.5 A CN bands at 6470- 6490 A and 7980 to 8005 A, and the [O I] line at 6300 A. By fitting the 13CN band at 8004.7 A, we determined the carbon isotope this http URL. We determined the main atmospheric parameters and investigated the chemical composition of 32 RS CVn stars. Lithium abundances were determined for 13 additional stars using archival spectra. We report that *iot Gem and HD 179094 have carbon isotope ratios already affected by extra-mixing, even though they are in the evolutionary stage below the red giant branch luminosity bump. About half of the low-mass giants, for which the lithium abundance was determined, follow the first dredge-up predictions; however, other stars show reduced Lithium abundances, as predicted by thermohaline-induced mixing. The intermediate-mass stars show reduced Lithium abundances reduced, as predicted by rotation-induced mixing. Conclusions. In low-mass, chromospherically active RS CVn stars, extra-mixing of lithium and carbon isotopes may begin earlier than in normal giants. The Li-rich RS CVn giant V*OP And has large C/N and carbon isotope ratios and raises questions about the origin of its lithium enhancement.

 - **Abstract**
 Among the emerging excess of massive, bright galaxies at Cosmic Dawn $z \gtrsim 9$ seen by the James Webb Space Telescope, several exhibit spectral features associated with active galactic nuclei (AGN). These AGN candidates suggest that supermassive black holes (SMBHs) grow rapidly in the early Universe. In a series of numerical experiments, we investigate how SMBHs grow within and influence the most massive galaxies at Cosmic Dawn using cosmological hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations run with the adaptive mesh refinement code RAMSES. Our suite of simulations explore how super-Eddington accretion, seed mass, and the strength of feedback influence SMBH-galaxy co-evolution in the early Universe. We find that SMBH growth is sensitive to stellar feedback which generates a turbulent-multiphase interstellar medium (ISM) that stochastically starves the SMBH. In the absence of AGN feedback, we find that the SMBH is starved $\sim 50\%$ of the time after the onset of star formation in the galaxy. SMBH growth can become self-regulated by AGN feedback if the SMBH becomes massive enough, either by accretion or seeding, for its feedback to dominate the surrounding nuclear region. We find no evidence of galaxy-scale, AGN-driven quenching in the star formation rate (SFR) across all simulations in our suite.
