#### THOR: a GPU-accelerated and MPI-parallel radiative transfer code

 - **Abstract**
 Emission and absorption line features are important diagnostics for the physics underlying extragalactic astronomy. The interpretation of observed signatures involves comparing against forward modeled spectra from galaxy formation simulations as well as more simplified geometries, while including the complex scattering radiative transfer (RT) of resonant emission lines. Here, we present thor, a modern C++ radiative transfer code focused initially on resonant emission lines. thor is a high-performance, distributed memory MPI-parallel, multi-target code, running on CPUs, GPUs and other accelerators, yielding large $\sim 10-50\rm{x}$ speed-ups compared to previous CPU-only codes. We support multiple grid-based and gridless data structures, enabling comparisons across different hydrodynamical codes as well as toy model geometries. We demonstrate its science capabilities with a number of example use cases across scales: (i) Lyman-alpha RT on simple shell-like gas distributions; (ii) Lyman-alpha RT applied to a high-resolution, high-redshift $z \sim 6$ cosmological hydrodynamical galaxy formation simulation; (iii) Lyman-alpha and Magnesium-II halos, i.e. scattering and emission from the circumgalactic medium of $z \simeq 1-2$ galaxies drawn from cosmological magnetohydrodynamical simulations; (iv) the large-scale cosmic web in gas emission, a $6144^3$ volume-element RT scaling calculation; and (v) synthetic absorption spectra of the Lyman-alpha forest. Extensive verification and benchmarking validates our approach and its computational efficiency.

 - **Abstract**
 High-redshift active galactic nuclei (AGN) have long been recognized as key probes of early black hole growth and galaxy evolution. However, modeling this population remains difficult due to the wide range of luminosities and black hole masses involved, and the high computational costs of capturing the hydrodynamic response of gas and evolving radiation fields on-the-fly. In this study, we present a new suite of simulations based on the IllustrisTNG galaxy formation framework, enhanced with on-the-fly radiative transfer, to examine AGN at high redshift (z > 5) in a protocluster environment extracted from the MillenniumTNG simulation. We focus on the co-evolution of black holes and their host galaxies, as well as the radiative impact on surrounding intergalactic gas. The model predicts that black holes form in overdense regions and lie below the local black hole-stellar mass relation, with stellar mass assembly preceding significant black hole accretion. Ionizing photons are primarily produced by stars, which shape the morphology of ionized regions and drive reionization. Given the restrictive black hole growth in the original IllustrisTNG model, we reduce the radiative efficiency from 0.2 to 0.1, resulting in higher accretion rates for massive black holes, more bursty growth, and earlier AGN-driven quenching. However, the resulting AGN remain significantly fainter than observed high-redshift quasars. As such, to incorporate this missing population, we introduce a quasar boosted model, in which we artificially boost the AGN luminosity. This results in strong effects on the surrounding gas, most notably a proximity effect, and large contributions to He ionization.

 - **Abstract**
 Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations at 1.3mm have recently revealed surprising complexity in the circumstellar environment of DFK 52, a red supergiant (RSG) located in the Stephenson 2 massive open cluster. We provide an initial characterisation of the star's mass-loss properties by studying its circumstellar emission in continuum, $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, and SiO rotational lines. We find that DFK 52 is surrounded by an extremely large outflow (up to 50,000 au in radius) that shows complex morphologies in both its molecular and dust emission. The size of the circumstellar medium is unprecedented, even when compared with other known extreme RSGs, and its lower luminosity indicates that its mass ejection mechanism may be unique among this population. The molecular emission can be partially reproduced by a two-component model consisting of a fast (27 km/s) detached equatorial component with $M{\sim}0.05$ $M_{\odot}$ and a slow (10 km/s) spherical envelope with $\dot{M}\sim3\times10^{-6}$ $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. This suggests that DFK 52 underwent a dramatic mass-loss event $\sim$4000 years ago, but has since transitioned into having a slower more symmetric mass loss. We conservatively estimate a total mass of $0.1-1$ $M_{\odot}$ in the complex extended regions of the outflow. The uncertain nature of the dramatic mass loss warrants extensive follow-up of this likely supernova progenitor.

 - **Abstract**
 The 21-cm forest, comprising narrow absorption features imprinted on the radio spectra of high-redshift radio-loud quasars by intervening neutral hydrogen, offers a uniquely sensitive probe of the thermal state of the neutral intergalactic medium (IGM) during the epoch of reionization. Although over 30 such quasars are now known at $z > 5.5$, the signal remains elusive in practice, owing to instrumental noise, the intrinsic weakness of the absorption features, and the limited brightness of available background sources. Recent studies have focused on the one-dimensional transmission power spectrum as a statistical observable, but this approach also demands high signal-to-noise ratios. Here, we present a systematic comparison of five inference pipelines for recovering IGM parameters from mock 21-cm forest spectra at $z = 6$, incorporating realistic instrumental noise and telescope characteristics. We show that likelihood-free inference based on machine learning substantially outperforms traditional Bayesian methods. In particular, our most effective method dispenses with the power spectrum entirely: we use a convolutional U-Net to extract a latent-space encoding of the input spectrum and perform parameter regression using XGBoost. This approach yields accurate constraints on the IGM neutral fraction and X-ray heating efficiency even with a single 50-hour uGMRT sightline, which is an orders-of-magnitude improvement in integration time relative to existing techniques. We publicly release our code, training data, and models. Beyond the 21-cm forest, these results underscore the promise of hybrid deep learning and gradient-boosted inference techniques for extracting physical information from low-SNR data across astrophysics.

 - **Abstract**
 Astrophysical plasmas in relativistic spacetimes, such as black hole accretion flows, are often weakly collisional and require kinetic modeling to capture non-local transport and particle acceleration. However, the extreme scale separation between microscopic and macroscopic processes limits the feasibility of fully kinetic simulations. A covariant guiding center formalism has recently been derived to address this challenge in curved spacetimes. We present a new hybrid numerical algorithm based on this formalism, which evolves the trajectories of charged particles over macroscopic timescales in GRMHD backgrounds. To address numerical instabilities in the equations of motion, we develop a semi-implicit integrator that ensures stable evolution in strong-field environments. We apply our method to GRMHD simulations of black hole accretion flows, demonstrating its accuracy and efficiency across a range of physical conditions.

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of gravitational waves (GW) by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) network has opened up a new era in astrophysics. The identification of the electromagnetic counterparts of GW sources is crucial for multi-messenger astronomy, one way of which is to use galaxy catalogues to guide optical follow-up observations. In this paper, we test the utility of galaxy-targeted approach with mass prioritised galaxy ranking for the ongoing LIGO O4 run. We have used the simulated results for the expected LIGO O4 events and the NED-LVS galaxy catalogue and based our study for small field of view telescopes, specifically the GROWTH-India Telescope (GIT). With the increase in sensitivity of LIGO/Virgo in the ongoing observing run O4, the expected number of total detections have gone up but most of these are also now poorly localised. We show that a larger volume covered in the same field-of-view (FoV) on the sky results in a large increase in the total number of galaxies in each FoV. A significant top-heaviness is observed in the mass-ranked list of galaxies, which still number to a few thousand in most cases. At larger distances, such high numbers of deep follow-up observations are infeasible in most cases rendering galaxy catalogues useful in limited cases, but these are still useful at lower distances where LVK detectors are currently sensitive and where galaxy completeness is higher. We also explore the effect of mass-filling to account for galaxy catalogue incompleteness at large distances. If mass-filled probabilities are considered as the metric for ranking and coverage, we find that the conventional 2D probability search performs better than a 3D galaxy catalogue (without mass-filling) based search at distances larger than 300 Mpc (upto which NED-LVS is ~70% complete), and using 3D mass times probability in each tile performs better for nearby events.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the chemical evolution of N/O using a sample of 45 local star-forming galaxies (SFGs) from the CLASSY survey. This sample spans a wide range of galaxy properties, with robust determinations of nitrogen and oxygen abundances via the direct-$T_{\rm e}$ method. We explore how N/O relates to density structure, stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), stellar age, compactness, and gas kinematics. In addition, we compare our results with those of galaxies at $z =2-10$ where N/O ratios were derived from optical or UV nitrogen lines, aiming to identify chemical enrichment pathways across cosmic time. Our analysis shows that the N/O-O/H relation in CLASSY galaxies aligns with the trends seen in local galaxies and extragalactic HII regions, and that galaxies at $z = 2-6$ exhibit similar N/O values, indicating no significant redshift evolution in N/O. We identify a significant correlation between electron density $n_{\rm e}$([S II]) and N/O, suggesting that density structure contributes to the scatter in the N/O-O/H relation. The CLASSY galaxies with high SFRs or compact star formation show elevated N/O, though no strong correlation with stellar mass is found. We also find that high-velocity outflows (v$_{out}$ > 350 km/s) and low mass-loading factors are linked to elevated N/O, indicating that feedback plays a significant role. These results highlight the importance of density, star formation, and feedback from young stellar populations in shaping N/O enrichment and provide key insights for interpreting high-$z$ galaxies observed with JWST.

 - **Abstract**
 Quasar sightline observations reveal that low-ionization-state gas corotates with the galaxy disk and often at sub-centrifugal velocities, suggesting that the gas is spiraling towards the galaxy disk. However, while observations ubiquitously detect O VI absorption around low-redshift, $\sim L^*$ star-forming galaxies, the relationship between O VI and the galaxy disk, especially the kinematics, is not well-established. This work focuses on the O VI kinematics and its comparison with that of the low ions and galactic disk rotation. We present observations of 18 pairs of quasars and $z\approx0.2$ star-forming galaxies. All quasar sightlines intersect the circumgalactic medium (CGM) within 45$^\circ$ from the galaxy major axes. We show that while individual O VI velocity components do not correlate with disk rotation, the bulk of O VI gas in individual sightlines rarely counter-rotates. We then match O VI velocity components with those of low ions by minimizing the difference of their velocity centroids. The O VI velocity components with successful low-ion matches are typically found at small sightline impact parameters and are more likely to corotate with the disk. We suggest that the low-ion-matched O VI velocity components trace the gas co-spatial with the low ions near the extended disk plane in the inner CGM, whereas those without low-ion matches represent the gas at large 3D radii. While the gas at large radii is theoretically expected to kinematically correlate with the disk angular momentum, this correlation is expected to be weaker due to the higher turbulent to mean rotation velocity ration at large radii, consistent with our results.
#### Granulation signatures in 3D hydrodynamical simulations: evaluating background model performance using a Bayesian nested sampling framework

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the granulation background signal is of vital importance when interpreting the asteroseismic diagnostics of solar-like oscillators. Various descriptions exist in the literature for modelling the surface manifestation of convection, the choice of which affects our interpretations. We aim to evaluate the performance of and preference for various granulation background models for a suite of 3D hydrodynamical simulations of convection across the HR diagram, thereby expanding the number of simulations and coverage of parameter space for which such studies have been made. We take a statistical approach by considering the granulation in power density spectra of 3D simulations, where no biases or systematics of observational origin are present. To properly contrast the performance of the models, we develop a Bayesian nested sampling framework for model inference and comparison. This framework was extended to real stellar data using KIC 8006161 (Doris) and the Sun. We find that multi-component models are consistently preferred over a single-component model, with each tested multi-component model demonstrating merit in specific cases. This occurs for simulations with no magnetic activity, thus ruling out stellar faculae as the sole source of the second granulation component. Like a previous study, we find that a hybrid model with a single overall amplitude and two characteristic frequencies performs well for numerous simulations. Additionally, a tentative third granulation component beyond the value of $\nu_\mathrm{max}$ is seen for some simulations, but its potential presence in observations requires further efforts. Studying the granulation signatures in these simulations paves the way to studying stars with accurate granulation models. This deeper understanding of the granulation signal may lead to complementary methods to existing algorithms for determining stellar parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 Follow-up of gravitational-wave events by wide-field surveys is a crucial tool for the discovery of electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational wave sources, such as kilonovae. Machine learning tools can play an important role in aiding search efforts. We have developed a public tool to predict kilonova light curves using simulated low-latency alert data from the International Gravitational Wave Network during observing runs 4 (O4) and 5 (O5). It uses a bidirectional long-short-term memory (LSTM) model to forecast kilonova light curves from binary neutron star and neutron star-black hole mergers in the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time filters. The model achieves a test mean squared error (MSE) of 0.19 for ZTF filters and 0.22 for Rubin filters, calculated by averaging the squared error over all time steps, filters, and light curves in the test set. We verify the performance of the model against merger events followed-up by the ZTF partnership during O4a and O4b. We also analyze the effect of incorporating skymaps and constraints on physical features such as ejecta mass through a hybrid convolutional neural network and LSTM model. Using ejecta mass, the performance of the model improves to an MSE of 0.1. However, using full skymap information results in slightly lower model performance. Our models are publicly available and can help to add important information to help plan follow-up of candidate events discovered by current and next-generation public surveys.
#### Current Helicity in Response to Coronal Mass Ejections

 - **Abstract**
 Coronal mass ejections (CMEs), powerful solar eruptions with massive plasma ejected into the interplanetary space, are caused by the release of the magnetic free enengy stored in coronal electric currents. Photospheric current helicity, defined as the integral of the product of vertical electric current density and vertical magnetic field ($H_c=\int j_zB_z\ dS$), serves as a key parameter in understanding the eruptions. Using a 3D magnetohydrodynamic model, we identify a current helicity reversal pattern associated with the eruption: a pre-eruption decrease and a post-eruption increase. This helicity reversal is attributed to the redistribution of electric currents: before the eruption, currents concentrate toward the polarity inversion line (PIL); after the eruption they move away from the PIL, consistent with the flare ribbon separation, which is caused by the upward progression reconnection site. To validate this pattern, we conducted an observational analysis of 50 $\geq$M5.0 eruptive flares. The results reveal that 58\% of cases exhibited a pre-eruption decrease and 92\% showed the post-eruption increase in current helicity. Detailed analysis of two cases with this reversal suggests that they share the same current redistribution pattern, consistent with the mechanism identified in the simulations. Moreover, the pre-eruption decrease could be observed clearly even in the long-term evolution of the two cases. Current helicity can serve as an indicator of when electric currents are built up for the subsequent eruption, and it has the potential to predict CMEs to some extent.

 - **Abstract**
 The transport of energetic particles in a spatially varying magnetic field is described by the focused transport equation. In the past two versions of this equation were investigated. The more commonly used standard form described a pitch-angle isotropization process but does not conserve the norm. In the current paper we consider the focused transport equation in conservative form also called modified focused transport equation. This equation conserves the norm but does not describe pitch-angle isotropization. We use the previously developed subspace method to solve the focused transport equation analytically and numerically. For a pure analytical treatment we employ the two-dimensional subspace approximation. Furthermore, we consider a higher dimensionality for which one needs to evaluate occurring matrix exponentials numerically. This type of semi-numerical approach is much faster than traditional solvers and, therefore, it is very useful.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational waves (GWs) have provided a new lens through which to view the universe beyond traditional electromagnetic methods. The upcoming space-based gravitational wave mission, Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), will give us the first glimpse of the sky in mHz gravitational waves, a waveband that contains a rich variety of sources including massive binary black hole (MBBH) mergers. In this work, we investigate the spatial distribution of MBBH mergers versus the galaxy distribution to determine how well LISA could be used as a unique and independent probe of large-scale structure. We compare the two-point correlation function (2pt CF) of MBBH mergers to that of galaxies within the cosmological hydrodynamic simulation IllustrisTNG. Our results show that MBBH mergers exhibit stronger clustering than galaxies at scales less than 10 Mpc $h^{-1}$, particularly at higher redshifts, and that the bias is relatively constant as a function of separation. These findings imply that the spatial distribution of MBBH mergers detectable by LISA could inform the observed galaxy distribution. In addition, this implies that searches for a cosmological background in LISA data could use a prior derived from large-scale structure observations to subtract the MBBH foreground.

 - **Abstract**
 Far-infrared (FIR) and mid-infrared (MIR) fine-structure lines (FSLs) provide key diagnostics of physical conditions in the interstellar medium (ISM). Building on empirical relations established in our previous work, we use photoionization models to systematically investigate the emission from both ionized and neutral gas phases in a coherent structure. By applying power-law fits to model parameters, we quantitatively capture how key FIR FSL ratios scale with physical properties such as density, radiation field strength and hardness, and elemental abundances. Our analysis confirms the primary dependencies behind most observed empirical trends and establishes certain FIR FSL ratios as tracers of physical parameters, while revealing that parameter marginalization-particularly in density and the O/H-$U$-$Q_1/Q_0$ relation-plays a crucial role in shaping tight correlations seen in galaxies. We also identify persistent challenges, including degeneracies between ionization parameter and radiation field hardness, uncertainties in neutral gas density, and difficulties in modeling dusty H II regions. We outline the fundamental observational and theoretical limitations of current FIR FSL diagnostics, and highlight prospects for advancing the field through comprehensive, multi-wavelength studies of diverse galaxy populations.

 - **Abstract**
 Totally eclipsing contact binaries provide a unique opportunity to accurately determine mass ratios through photometric methods alone, eliminating the need for spectroscopic data. Studying low mass ratio (LMR) contact binaries is crucial for advancing our understanding of binary star evolution and the formation of rare optical transients known as red novae. We identified 143 totally eclipsing contact binaries from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. These high-precision light curves reveal a distinct O'Connell effect, which we interpret by introducing a cool spot on the primary star. Training a neural network model that includes cool spot parameters can generate a high-precision light curve 2 orders of magnitude faster than Phoebe. Utilizing the neural network (NNnol3) model combined with the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm, we rapidly derived the fundamental parameters of these systems. By leveraging the relationship between orbital period and semimajor axis using the Random Sample Consensus algorithm, we estimated their absolute parameters. Our analysis identified 96 targets with mass ratios below 0.25, all of which were not listed in any previous catalog, thus signifying the discovery of new LMR system candidates. Assuming all 143 binary systems are affected by a third light during parameter estimation, we train a neural network (NNl3) model considering the third light. Then we calculate the residuals between the mass ratio ql3 (considering the third light) and qnol3 (neglecting it). For these residuals, the 25th percentile (Q1) is 0.012, the median (Q2) is 0.026, and the 75th percentile (Q3) is 0.05.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic reconnection is a process that converts magnetic energy into plasma energy by changing the magnetic field line topology. The outstanding question is why the reconnection rate is $\mathcal{O}(0.01 - 0.1)$ in many astrophysical phenomena, for example solar flares and terrestrial substorms. Previous studies have shown two ideas of Hall reconnection and plasmoid instability. However, there is no consensus on which process is the reason for the fast reconnection. In this paper, we discuss the formation of secondary plasmoids in \rewrite{2D antiparallel collisionless reconnection} using 2.5-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations and discuss whether plasmoid-mediated reconnection occur in collisionless systems by comparing with plasmoid instability in resistive MHD simulations. We find that in collisionless systems secondary plasmoids can indeed form. However, the mass ratio has a strong effect on the formation of secondary plasmoids, and it indicates that secondary plasmoids do not emerge using realistic ion-electron mass ratio ($m_i/m_e = 1836$). Furthermore, we find that there is no enhancement of the reconnection rate due to the secondary plasmoid in the collisionless system, as discussed in the plasmoid-mediated reconnection. Although our simulation $\mathcal{O}(100\lambda_i)$ box is not large enough to discuss astrophysical phenomena such as solar flares, it can reflect a relatively small plasma system such as the Earth's magnetotail.

 - **Abstract**
 In this Letter, taking advantage of microwave data from the Expanded Owens Valley Solar Array and extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) data from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly, we present the first microwave imaging spectroscopy diagnosis for the slow-rise precursor of a major coronal mass ejection (CME) on 2022 March 30. The EUV images reveal that the CME progenitor, appearing as a hot channel above the polarity inversion line, experiences a slow rise and heating before the eruption. The microwave emissions are found to mainly distribute along the hot channel, with high-frequency sources located at the ends of the hot channel and along precursor bright loops underneath the hot channel. The microwave spectroscopic analysis suggests that microwave emissions in the precursor phase are dominated by thermal emission, largely different from the main phase when a significant non-thermal component is present. These results support the scenario that the precursor reconnection, seeming to be moderate compared with the flare reconnection during the main phase, drives the build-up, heating, and slow rise of CME progenitors toward the explosive eruption.

 In this work we study a robust, $K_s$-band complete, spectroscopically-confirmed sample of 104 unobscured (Type-1) quasars within the COSMOS and XMM-LSS fields of the MeerKAT International GHz Tiered Extragalactic Exploration (MIGHTEE) Survey, at 0.60 < $z$ < 3.41. The quasars are selected via $gJK_s$ colour-space and, with 1.3-GHz flux-densities reaching rms ~ 3.0$\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$, we find a radio-loudness fraction of 5 per cent. Thanks to the deep, multiwavelength datasets that are available over these fields, the properties of radio-loud and radio-quiet quasars can be studied in a statistically-robust way, with the emphasis of this work being on the active-galactic-nuclei (AGN)-related and star-formation-related contributions to the total radio emission. We employ multiple star-formation-rate estimates for the analysis so that our results can be compared more-easily with others in the literature, and find that the fraction of sources that have their radio emission dominated by the AGN crucially depends on the SFR estimate that is derived from the radio luminosity. When redshift dependence is not taken into account, a larger fraction of sources is classed as having their radio emission dominated by the AGN. When redshift dependence $is$ considered, a larger fraction of our sample is tentatively classed as 'starbursts'. We also find that the fraction of (possible) starbursts increases with redshift, and provide multiple suggestions for this trend.

 - **Abstract**
 Spectroscopic studies of massive and luminous O-type stellar atmospheres and winds have primarily been done by using 1D, spherically symmetric and stationary models. Both observations and modern theoretical models show that such stars have highly structured and variable atmospheres and winds. We present first spectral synthesis based on 3D time-dependent unified RHD model atmospheres with winds for O stars. We first carried out time-dependent, 3D simulations of unified atmospheres with winds. We then used 3D radiative transfer to compute surface brightness maps for the optical continuum as well as integrated flux profiles for select diagnostic lines. To derive occupation numbers and source functions, an aNLTE method was used, as well as scattering source functions. Our continuum intensity maps of a prototypical early O star reveal a highly variable and time-dependent surface, characterised by local emergent radiation temperature variations. Our averaged synthetic line profiles of optical absorption lines have large widths, without applying any macro- or microturbulence. From the simulations we find correspondingly large velocity dispersions in the photospheric layers. Additionally, the absorption line EWs are larger than for comparable 1D models. First results using scattering source functions further demonstrate that characteristic features like the softening of the blue edge of strong ultra-violet wind lines are qualitatively well-reproduced by our models. Our 3D simulations clearly predict a highly structured and strongly variable O star surface. First line profile results further suggest that several observed features are naturally reproduced by our models without the need to introduce ad-hoc spectral fitting parameters. We also discuss how using 3D rather than 1D simulations as a basis for future studies may affect the derivation of fundamental stellar parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 The spatial diffusion of energetic particles in a magnetic field composed of a large-scale background and a small-scale turbulent component should be expected to be anisotropic. While such anisotropic diffusion has been known for quite a while in first-principle plasma physics and while it is required for an understanding of the transport of cosmic rays in the heliosphere or close to supernova remnants, only in recent years it has also become of particular interest for the modeling of Galactic cosmic ray (GCR) transport in the Milky Way in the context of their residence time and their (local) energy spectra. Also, the large-scale spatial distribution of GCRs is shaped by an anisotropic diffusion in the Galactic magnetic field, which should directly affect both the diffuse gamma-ray and the neutrino emission. We solve the anisotropic diffusive transport of GCRs in the Milky Way using the publicly available transport code CRPropa. The anisotropy of the diffusion is characterized by the ratio between the diffusion coefficient perpendicular and parallel to the local magnetic field $\epsilon = D_\perp / D_\parallel$, where we test different values reaching from nearly parallel transport ($\epsilon = 10^{-3}$) to more isotropic diffusion ($\epsilon = 10^{-1}$). From the three dimensional distribution of GCRs in the Milky Way we calculate the all-sky gamma-ray emission, using the line-of-sight integration framework HERMES. Finally, we demonstrate the impact of the anisotropy in the diffusion on the spatial distribution of the gamma-ray flux and its spectral energy distribution. It shows strong influences by the anisotropy of the diffusion and the magnetic field geometry.

 - **Abstract**
 Compact object systems exhibit Quasi-Periodic Oscillations (QPOs) as revealed by peaked features in their power density spectra. It has been known that stochastic variations in the accretion disc will propagate to the corona after a time delay and that the hard X-rays from the corona impinge back on the disc, giving reflection spectral features. Here, we show that the combination of these two effects makes a simple radiative feedback system between the corona and the disc, which naturally produces the observed QPOs whose primary frequency corresponds to the inverse of the time delay. The analytical form of the expected power spectra can be statistically compared with the observed ones. Hence, for the first time, a physical model is used to describe and fit the AstroSat observed power spectra of the black hole systems MAXI J1535-571 and GRS 1915+105, including the QPO, its harmonics, as well as the broadband components.

 - **Abstract**
 The Lyman-$\alpha$ forest of high redshift quasars is a powerful probe of the late stages of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), particularly through the presence of Gunn-Peterson troughs. These troughs span a broad range of lengths (up to $\sim 100$ Mpc), suggesting large-scale coherent structures in the intergalactic medium. We aim to gain insight into the presence, extent, and magnitude of correlations in the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest at $5<z<6.1$, and to quantify the scales over which correlations are significant to inform on the necessary volume for simulating the EoR. Using the extended XQR-30 dataset and accounting for the relevant systematics, we compute the flux correlation matrix and perform an MCMC analysis to quantify the extent and strength of the correlation. To interpret our results, we compare to $1.5^3,\mathrm{Gpc}^3$ lightcones of Lyman-$\alpha$ transmission fluxes from several reionization scenarios, including a fiducial box employing SCRIPT. We detect strong correlations at $z > 5.3$, extending at least tens of Mpc and strongly increasing with redshift. Our results suggest a redshift-dependent correlation length, from $L \leq 26.53\, (68.47)$ Mpc at 1-$\sigma$ (2-$\sigma$) limit at $z = 5.0$ to $L = 252.72^{+272.61}_{-41.61}$ Mpc at $z = 6.1$. In contrast, all simulation models predict shorter correlation lengths ($< 60$ Mpc) and a slower redshift evolution. The presence and redshift-dependence of correlations in the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest on $>200$ Mpc scales at $z=6$ indicates that cosmological simulations should be larger than this scale to adequately sample the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. Despite implementing a fluctuating UVB and numerous neutral islands at $z<6$, our fiducial SCRIPT-based simulation fails to reproduce the large-scale correlations. It may be that those ingredients are necessary, but not sufficient, to understanding the unfolding of the EoR.

 - **Abstract**
 The dark siren method exploits the complementarity between gravitational-wave binary coalescence signals and galaxy catalogs originating from the same regions of space. However, all galaxy catalogs are incomplete, i.e. they only include a subset of all galaxies, typically being biased towards the bright end of the luminosity distribution. This sub-selection systematically affects the dark siren inference of the Hubble constant $H_0$, so a completeness relation has to be introduced that accounts for the missing objects. In the literature it is standard to assume that the missing galaxies are uniformly distributed across the sky and that the galaxy magnitude distribution is known. In this work we develop a novel method which improves upon these assumptions and reconstructs the underlying true galaxy field, respecting the spatial correlation of galaxies on large scales. In our method the true magnitude distribution of galaxies is inferred alongside the spatial galaxy distribution. Our method results in an improved three-dimensional prior in redshift and sky position for the host galaxy of a GW event, which is expected to make the resulting $H_0$ posterior more robust. Building on our previous work, we make a number of improvements, and validate our method on simulated data based on the Millennium simulation.

 - **Abstract**
 The phenomenon of magnetic braking is one of the significant physical effects of the magnetic field in rotating molecular clouds. The physical characteristics of the core can affect on the core rotation rate. and one of the important parameter is the core density structure. According to observation, by regarding the power-law density distribution, $r^{-p}$, for molecular cloud cores, using smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulation, the results show that the increasing of density steepness (i.e., larger $p$) leads to the intensity of the toroidal components of the magnetic field and as a result larger $B_{\phi}$-components lead to more transfer of angular momentum to the outward. Thus, results show that the magnetic braking being stronger with increasing density slope in non-uniform molecular core. For example, the rotation of the system can approximately decrease by fifty percent from $p=0.2$ to $p=1.8$ for a non-uniform system.

 - **Abstract**
 We propose an empirical model to describe and constrain the baryon cycle process during galaxy evolution. This model utilizes the evolution of star formation rate, derived from the stellar mass-halo mass relations (SHMRs) across different redshifts, and the cold gas content, derived from the NeutralUniverseMachine model, to constrain gas accretion and recycle of gas outflow in the model galaxy. Additionally, through detailed modeling of each cycle process, particularly the recycling process, and utilizing the gas-phase mass-metallicity relation (MZR) at $z=0$ as a constraint, our model establishes a relation between the recycle fraction and halo mass. It is found that the fraction of gas recycled from the outflow is a function of halo mass, with a value of $25\%$ in galaxies with halo mass $\sim10^{10.4}M_{\rm \odot}$, increasing to $75\%$ in halos with mass $\sim 10^{12}M_{\rm \odot}$. We also find that the mass loading factor from the FIRE-2 simulation matches well with the constraints from both observational data and our model. Furthermore, using the gas content and metallicity of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) obtained from hydrodynamical simulations as constraints, our model predicts that on average $70\%$ of universal baryon accretion is accreted to the halo and $80\%$ of the non-recycled gas in the outflow has escaped from the galaxy, entering the intergalactic medium (IGM). However, we note that future observational data are needed to finally constrain the mass and metal exchange between the CGM and the IGM.

 - **Abstract**
 We present observations of the nearby extremely metal-poor galaxy I Zw 18 using the Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI) and the JWST Mid-InfraRed Instrument (MIRI) Integral Field Spectrographs (IFS). From optical and mid-IR oxygen emission lines, we measured direct-method abundances for three ionic states of oxygen, including O$^{3+}$/H$^+$. In contrast to previous studies of I Zw 18, the high spatial resolution afforded by KCWI and MIRI/MRS revealed chemical inhomogeneities on 60 pc scales in the form of metal-poor pockets and metal-enriched gas. These are located outside I Zw 18's star-forming complexes having possibly been dispersed beyond these regions via stellar feedback effects. We found that metallicities derived using a single low-ionization density tracer, and T$_{\rm e}$([O II]) derived from a temperature relationship commonly used in high-$z$ galaxy studies, exhibited the largest scatter and underestimated the metallicity compared to those derived using multi-ion densities and estimated T$_{\rm e}$([N II]). Finally, we compared O$^{3+}$/H$^+$ abundances from a theoretical ionization correction factor (ICF) against observed values and found that the oxygen ICF underestimates the O$^{3+}$/H$^+$ abundance by a factor of 2, indicating that either additional ionizing sources are needed or standard stellar population models are unable to produce the requisite ionizing flux.

 - **Abstract**
 Cold brown dwarf atmospheres are good training grounds for analyzing temperate giant planets. WISEP J173835.52+273258.9 (WISE 1738) is an isolated Y0 brown dwarf with a temperature between 350-400 K, at the T-Y transition. While its near-infrared spectrum has been studied, bulk properties and chemistry remain uncertain. We analyze new JWST MIRI medium-resolution spectra (5-18 micron), combined with near-infrared spectra (0.98-2.2 micron) from HST/WFC3 and Gemini/GNIRS, to better constrain WISE 1738's atmosphere and physical parameters. We use Neural Posterior Estimation (NPE) with a cloud-free petitRADTRANS model and evaluate results using posterior checks, coverage, and L-C2ST diagnostics. Our retrieval confirms previous constraints on H2O, CH4, and NH3, and for the first time constrains CO, CO2, and 15NH3. We find evidence of disequilibrium chemistry through CO and CO2 abundances not expected under equilibrium. Estimated properties are temperature 402 (+12,-9) K, log g 4.43 (+0.26,-0.34) cm/s2, mass 13 (+11,-7) M_Jup, radius 1.14 (+0.03,-0.03) R_Jup, and bolometric luminosity -6.52 (+0.05,-0.04) log L/L_sun. Evolutionary models suggest an age between 1 and 4 Gyr, consistent with a 6-hour rotation. We place an upper bound on 15NH3, implying a 3-sigma lower limit on the 14N/15N ratio of 275. We also derive a C/O ratio of 1.35 (+0.39,-0.31) and metallicity of 0.34 (+0.12,-0.11), without accounting for oxygen sequestration.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Dust is a fundamental component of the interstellar medium (ISM) and plays a critical role in galaxy evolution. Dust grains influence the ISM by cooling the gas, altering its chemistry, and absorbing stellar radiation, re-emitting it at longer wavelengths in the far-infrared (FIR) and sub-millimeter regimes. The cold dust component, which dominates the dust mass, is primarily heated by stellar radiation, including both young, massive stars and the diffuse emission from older stars. Understanding dust heating is essential to trace the connection between stellar populations and their environments. Aims. We aim to identify the dominant heating mechanisms of the cold dust in typical nearby spiral galaxies and explore the contributions of young and evolved stars to dust heating. Methods. Using 18 large, face-on spiral galaxies from the DustPedia project, we apply two complementary approaches: (1) correlation analysis between dust temperature (T_dust), SFR surface density (Sigma_SFR), and stellar mass surface density (Sigma_Mstar); and (2) study of the relationship between T_dust and dust mass surface density (Sigma_dust). Results. T_dust peaks at ~24 K in galaxy centers and drops to ~15 K at large radii. Galaxies with and without AGNs show similar T_dust profiles. For ~72% of the sample, both methods agree on the dominant heating source. Overall, we find that both young and evolved stars contribute to dust heating, with their relative roles varying between galaxies.
#### On the Fast-radio-burst-associated X-ray Bursts: Inverse Compton Scattering of Radio Photons by an Extreme Pair Flow During Magnetosphere Activities

 - **Abstract**
 The Galactic fast radio burst (FRB) FRB 200428 was associated with a short X-ray burst (XRB) from the magnetar SGR J1935+2154 during one of its active phases. This FRB-associated XRB exhibits distinct properties compared to other typical XRBs, including a significantly higher cutoff energy and a steeper power-law index. Its recovered X-ray light curve shows a multiple-peak structure, with the time of arrival offset from that of the FRB. These unique features imply a special physical link between the FRB and X-ray emissions. In 2022 October, a similar FRB-XRB association was detected from the same source. In this paper, we propose a model in which the observed spectral and temporal features of the associated XRBs can be attributed to the inverse Compton scattering (ICS) of FRB photons by an extreme pair flow around the light cylinder, with a bulk Lorentz factor of $\Gamma\sim10$ and a power-law distribution in the comoving frame, characterized by a typical Lorentz factor $\gamma^\prime_\mathrm{m}\sim5\times 10^4$. This extreme pair flow could originate from the compression of a transient pulse of $\sim10^{40}-10^{41}\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$ and the acceleration through magnetic reconnection in the current sheet during magnetar activity. The Doppler-boosted ICS spectra and the arrival time shifts in such a scenario can well explain the observed features of the FRB 200428-associated XRB and can also account for another associated event in 2022.
