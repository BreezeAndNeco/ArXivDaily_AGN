 - **Abstract**
 In recent years, kinetic simulations have been crucial to further our understanding of pulsar electrodynamics. Yet, due to the large-scale separation between the gyro-period vs the stellar rotation period, resolving the particle gyration has been computationally unfeasible for realistic pulsar parameters. The main aim of this work is comparing our gyro-phase-resolved model with a gyro-centric pulsar model, where our model solves the general equations of motion with included radiation reaction using a higher-order numerical solver with adaptive time steps. Specifically, we aim to (i) reproduce a pulsar's high-energy emission maps, namely one with $10\%$ the surface $B$-field strength of Vela, and spectra produced by an independent gyro-centric pulsar emission model; (ii) test convergence of these results to the radiation-reaction limit of Aristotelian Electrodynamics. (iii) Additionally, we identify the effect that a large $E_{\parallel}$-field has on the trajectories and radiation calculations. We find that we can reproduce the curvature radiation emission maps and spectra well, using $10\%$ field strengths of the Vela pulsar and injecting our particles at a higher altitude in the magnetosphere. Using sufficiently large $E_{\parallel}$-fields, our numeric results converge to the analytic radiation-reaction limit trajectories. Additionally, we illustrate the importance of accounting for the $\mathbf{E}\times \mathbf{B}$-drift in the particle trajectories and radiation calculations, validating the Harding and collaborators' model approach. Lastly, we found that our model deals very well with the high-radiation-reaction and high-field regimes present in pulsars.

 - **Abstract**
 Disentangling the rich astrophysical structure of the stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) from its cosmological component is essential for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) to access the physics of the early Universe beyond the reach of any other probe. In this work, we develop an analytical framework to compute the astrophysical contribution to the SGWB arising from an unresolved ensemble of inspiraling and merging black hole binaries. Accounting for various resolvability thresholds, we leverage this framework to predict the amplitude, spectral shape, and detection signal-to-noise ratio of the unresolved background from massive black hole binaries (MBHBs), capturing the possible diversity of its SGWB imprint across a range of astrophysically motivated populations. Through a joint analysis of astrophysical and primordial contributions to the SGWB, we determine the minimum detectable amplitude of the cosmological background across a range of spectral shapes. We demonstrate that, even under optimistic subtraction thresholds, unresolved MBHBs can degrade the detectability of a cosmological signal by multiple orders of magnitude, depending on the spectral shape of the primordial component. Ultimately, the MBHB-induced astrophysical SGWB acts both as a veil and a lens: it imposes a fundamental limit on cosmological sensitivity, yet simultaneously reveals the hidden population of massive black holes beyond the reach of individual detections. Accurate modeling of this late-Universe background is therefore a prerequisite for robust component separation and for realizing LISA's full scientific potential.
#### A new window into the sub-parsec scale magnetic field in the Milky Way? Unveiling small-scale magneto-ionic structures with Faraday complexity

 - **Abstract**
 Radio broadband spectro-polarimetric observations are sensitive to the spatial fluctuations of the Faraday depth (FD) within the telescope beam. Such FD fluctuations are referred to as "Faraday complexity", and can unveil small-scale magneto-ionic structures in both the synchrotron-emitting and the foreground volumes. We explore the astrophysical origin of the Faraday complexity exhibited by 191 polarised extragalactic radio sources (EGSs) within 5 deg from the Galactic plane in the longitude range of 20-52 deg, using broadband data from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array presented by a previous work. A new parameter called the FD spread is devised to quantify the spatial FD fluctuations. We find that the FD spread of the EGSs (i) demonstrates an enhancement near the Galactic mid-plane, most notable within Galactic latitude of +-3 deg, (ii) exhibits hints of modulations across Galactic longitude, (iii) does not vary with the source size across the entire range of 2.5"-300", and (iv) has an amplitude higher than expected from magneto-ionic structures of extragalactic origin. All these suggest that the primary cause of the Faraday complexity exhibited by our target EGSs is <2.5"-scale magneto-ionic structures in the Milky Way. We argue that the anisotropic turbulent magnetic field generated by galactic-scale shocks and shears, or the stellar feedback-driven isotropic turbulent magnetic field, are the most likely candidates. Our work highlights the use of broadband radio polarimetric observations of EGSs as a powerful probe of multi-scale magnetic structures in the Milky Way.

 - **Abstract**
 Active, low-mass stars are widely observed to have radii that are larger than predicted by standard stellar models. Proposed mechanisms for this radius inflation generally involve stellar magnetism, either in the form of added pressure support in the outer layers and/or suppression of convection via starspots. We have assembled a large sample of 261 low-mass stars in the young clusters Upper Scorpius, $\alpha$ Persei, Pleiades, and Praesepe (spanning ages 10--670 Myr) for which the data exist to empirically measure the stellar radii, rotation periods, and starspot covering fractions. We find a clear, strong relationship between the degree of radius inflation and stellar rotation as represented by the Rossby number; this inflation-rotation relationship bears striking resemblance to canonical activity-rotation relationships, including both the so-called linear and saturated regimes. We also demonstrate here for the first time that the radius inflation depends directly on the starspot covering fraction. We furthermore find that the stars' effective temperatures decrease with decreasing Rossby number as well, and that this temperature suppression balances the radius inflation so as to preserve the stellar bolometric luminosity. These relationships are consistent across the age range sampled here, which spans from the pre--main-sequence to the zero-age main sequence. The favorable comparison of our findings to the predictions of modern starspot-based stellar evolution models suggests that, while rotation is clearly the underlying driver, magnetism may be the most likely direct cause of the radius inflation phenomenon.

 - **Abstract**
 The Euclid mission and other next-generation large-scale structure surveys will enable high-precision measurements of the cosmic matter distribution. Understanding the impact of baryonic processes such as star formation and AGN feedback on matter clustering is crucial to ensure precise and unbiased cosmological inference. Most theoretical models of baryonic effects to date focus on two-point statistics, neglecting higher-order contributions. This work develops a fast and accurate emulator for baryonic effects on the matter bispectrum, a key non-Gaussian statistic in the nonlinear regime. We employ high-resolution $N$-body simulations from the BACCO suite and apply a combination of cutting-edge techniques such as cosmology scaling and baryonification to efficiently span a large cosmological and astrophysical parameter space. A deep neural network is trained to emulate baryonic effects on the matter bispectrum measured in simulations, capturing modifications across various scales and redshifts relevant to Euclid. We validate the emulator accuracy and robustness using an analysis of \Euclid mock data, employing predictions from the state-of-the-art FLAMINGO hydrodynamical simulations. The emulator reproduces baryonic suppression in the bispectrum to better than 2$\%$ for the $68\%$ percentile across most triangle configurations for $k \in [0.01, 20]\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$ and ensures consistency between cosmological posteriors inferred from second- and third-order weak lensing statistics.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the internal structure of core helium burning (CHeB) stars is crucial for evaluating transport processes in nuclear-burning regions, constructing accurate stellar population models, and assessing nucleosynthesis processes that impact the chemical evolution of galaxies. While asteroseismic observations have recently enabled detailed probing of CHeB star interiors, seismic signatures related to structural variations at the boundary between the convective and radiative core, and chemical composition gradients within the radiative core remain underexplored. This paper investigates how such gradients affect the oscillation modes of low-mass CHeB stars, focusing on mixed dipole modes and uncoupled g-modes as diagnostic tools. Using semi-analytical models calibrated with the evolutionary codes $\texttt{BaSTI-IAC}$,$ \texttt{CLES}$, and $\texttt{MESA}$, we examine the impact of density discontinuities and associated structural glitches on mode period spacings. These codes span diverse physical prescriptions, allowing us to isolate robust features relevant for calibration. Our approach enables controlled glitch insertion while preserving a realistic representation of the star. Consistent with prior works, we find that structural glitches introduce periodic components in the period spacings, providing constraints on the location and amplitude of interior variations. We compare models with smooth and sharp transitions, demonstrating how glitch sharpness affects period spacing and mode trapping. Simulations based on four-year $\textit{Kepler}$ data show that our models yield oscillation frequencies closely matching observations. Ultimately, our results offer realistic predictions of how specific structural features affect the power spectral density, validating our theoretical framework and guiding future efforts to interpret glitch signatures in high-precision asteroseismic data.
#### The role of magnetic fields in ram pressure stripping of satellite galaxies in the circumgalactic medium around massive galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 The presence of magnetic fields in galaxies and their haloes could have important consequences for satellite galaxies moving through the magnetised circumgalactic medium (CGM) of their host. We therefore study the effect of magnetic fields on ram pressure stripping of satellites in the CGM of massive galaxies. We use cosmological `zoom-in' simulations of three massive galaxy haloes ($M_{\rm{200c}} = 10^{12.5-13}$M$_\odot$), each simulated with and without magnetic fields. The fraction of gas retained after infall through the CGM across our full satellite sample shows no population-wide impact of magnetic fields on ram pressure stripping. However, for the most massive satellites, we find that twice as much gas is stripped without magnetic fields. The evolution of a galaxy's stripped tail is also strongly affected. Magnetic fields reduce turbulent mixing, significantly inhibiting the dispersion of metals into the host CGM. This suppressed mixing greatly reduces condensation from the host CGM onto the stripped tail. By studying the magnetic field structure, we find evidence of magnetic draping and attribute differences in the stripping rate to the draping layer. Differences in condensation from the host CGM are attributed to magnetic field lines aligned with the tail suppressing turbulent mixing. We simulate one halo with enhanced resolution in the CGM and show these results are converged with resolution, though the structure of the cool gas in the tail is not. Our results show that magnetic fields can play an important role in ram pressure stripping in galaxy haloes and should be included in simulations of galaxy formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Detections of Earth-analog planets in radial velocity observations are limited by stellar astrophysical variability occurring on a variety of timescales. Current state-of-the-art methods to disentangle potential planet signals from intrinsic stellar signals assume that stellar signals introduce asymmetries to the line profiles that can therefore be separated from the pure translational Doppler shifts of planets. Here, we examine this assumption using a time series of resolved stellar p-mode oscillations in HD 142091 ($\kappa$ CrB), as observed on a single night with the NEID spectrograph at 2-minute cadence and with 25 cm/s precision. As an evolved subgiant star, this target has p-mode oscillations that are larger in amplitude (4-8 m/s) and occur on longer timescales (80 min.) than those of typical Sun-like stars of RV surveys, magnifying their corresponding effects on the stellar spectral profile. We show that for HD 142091, p-mode oscillations manifest primarily as pure Doppler shifts in the average line profile -- measured by the cross-correlation function (CCF) -- with "shape-driven" CCF variations as a higher-order effect. Specifically, we find that the amplitude of the shift varies across the CCF bisector, with 10% larger oscillation amplitudes closer to the core of the CCF, and 25% smaller oscillation amplitudes for bisector velocities derived near the wings; we attribute this trend to larger oscillation velocities higher in the stellar atmosphere. Using a line-by-line analysis, we verify that a similar trend is seen as a function of average line depth, with deeper lines showing larger oscillation amplitudes. Finally, we find no evidence that p-mode oscillations have a chromatic dependence across the NEID bandpass beyond that due to intrinsic line depth differences across the spectrum.
#### Direct Collapse pre-SMBH Objects as Ly$α$ Emitters

 - **Abstract**
 Direct Collapse scenario to form the supermassive black hole (SMBH) seeds offers the most promising way to explain the origin of quasars at $z>7$. Assuming atomic primordial gas, can Ly$\alpha$ photons escape from the central regions of the collapse and serve as a diagnostic for the detection of these pre-SMBH objects? Models assuming spherical collapse have found these photons to be trapped and destroyed. We use Ly$\alpha$ radiation transfer within the inflow-outflow geometry, based on earlier zoom-in cosmological modeling involving radiation transfer and magnetic forces. Adopting geometry that includes ongoing disky and spherical accretion, and formation of bi-conical outflow funnel, we obtain formation of a dense radiatively-driven expanding shell. The Ly$\alpha$ transfer is performed through a Monte Carlo algorithm, accounting for destruction of Ly$\alpha$ photons and emergence of two-photon emission. We find that substantial fraction of Ly$\alpha$ photons can escape through the funnel, and calculate the line profiles, the line peak velocity shift, asymmetry and cuspiness, by varying basic model parameters. The escaping Ly$\alpha$ emission is anisotropic, and sensitive to overall inflow-outflow geometry. The escaping fraction of Ly$\alpha$ radiation exceeds 95% from a $z=10$ pre-SMBH object -- in principle detectable by the JWST NIRSpec in the MOS mode, during $\sim 10^4$seconds for a $10\sigma$ signal-to-noise ratio. Moreover, comparisons with line shapes from high-$z$ galaxies and quasars allow to separate them from pre-SMBH objects based on the line asymmetry -- the pre-SMBH line show a profound asymmetry and extended red tail.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a suite of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers performed with the code GR-Athena++. We investigate how a different initial magnetic field configuration, nuclear equation of state, or binary mass ratio affects the magnetic and thermodynamic evolution of the post-merger remnant and disk. We also analyze the impact of the commonly-assumed reflection (bitant) symmetry across the equatorial plane. Magnetic field amplification occurs shortly after the merger due to the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability; later, the field keeps evolving with a predominantly toroidal configuration due to winding and turbulence. The initial magnetic field topology leaves an imprint on the field structure and affects magnetic field amplification for the initial magnetic field values commonly assumed in the literature and the limited resolution of the simulations. Enforcing equatorial reflection symmetry partially suppresses the development of turbulence near the equatorial plane and impacts the post-merger magnetic field evolution. Stiffer EOSs produce larger, less compact remnants that may retain memory of the pre-merger strong poloidal field.
#### James Webb Space Telescope Observations of the Nearby and Precisely-Localized FRB 20250316A: A Potential Near-IR Counterpart and Implications for the Progenitors of Fast Radio Bursts

 - **Abstract**
 We present deep James Webb Space Telescope near-infrared imaging to search for a quiescent or transient counterpart to FRB 20250316A, which was precisely localized with the CHIME/FRB Outriggers array to an area of $11\times13$ pc in the outer regions of NGC 4141 at $d\approx40$ Mpc. Our F150W2 image reveals a faint source near the center of the FRB localization region ("NIR-1"; $M_{\rm F150W2}\approx-2.5$ mag; probability of chance coincidence $\approx0.36$), the only source within $\approx2.7\sigma$. We find that it is too faint to be a globular cluster, young star cluster, red supergiant star, or a giant star near the tip of the red giant branch (RGB). It is instead consistent with a red giant near the RGB "clump" or a massive ($\gtrsim20$ M$_{\odot}$) main sequence star, although the latter explanation is less likely. The source is too bright to be a supernova remnant, Crab-like pulsar wind nebula, or isolated magnetar. Alternatively, NIR-1 may represent transient emission, namely a dust echo from an energetic outburst associated with the FRB, in which case we would expect it to fade in future observations. We explore the stellar population near the FRB and find that it is composed of a mix of young massive stars ($\sim10-100$ Myr) in a nearby HII region that extends to the location of FRB 20250316A, and old evolved stars ($\gtrsim$ Gyr). The overlap with a young stellar population, containing stars of up to $\approx20$ M$_\odot$, may implicate a neutron star / magnetar produced in the core collapse of a massive star as the source of FRB 20250316A.

 - **Abstract**
 Type Ia-CSM supernovae (SNe) are a rare and peculiar subclass of thermonuclear SNe characterized by emission lines of hydrogen or helium, indicative of a high-density circumstellar medium (CSM). Their implied mass-loss rates of $\sim 10^{-4}-10^{-1}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ (assuming $\mathrm{ \sim 100 \ km\ s^{-1}}$ winds) from optical observations are generally in excess of values observed in realistic SN Ia progenitors. In this paper, we present an independent study of CSM densities around a sample of 29 archival Ia-CSM SNe using radio observations with the Very Large Array at 6 GHz. Motivated by the late ($\sim$2 yr) radio detection of the Ia-CSM SN 2020eyj, we observed old ($>$1 yr) SNe where we are more likely to see the emergent synchrotron emission that may have been suppressed earlier by free-free absorption by the CSM. We do not detect radio emission down to 3$\sigma$ limits of $\sim$35 $\mu$Jy in our sample. The only radio-detected candidate in our sample, SN 2022esa, was likely mis-classified as a Ia-CSM with early spectra, and appears more consistent with a peculiar Ic based on later-epochs. Assuming a wind-like CSM with temperatures between $2 \times 10^4$ K and $10^5$ K, and magnetic field-to-shock energy fraction ($\epsilon_B$) = $0.01-0.1$, the radio upper limits rule out mass-loss rates between $\sim 10^{-4}-10^{-2}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ (100 km s$^{-1}$)$^{-1}$. This is somewhat in tension with the estimates from optical observations, and may indicate that more complex CSM geometries and/or lower values of $\epsilon_B$ may be present.

 - **Abstract**
 The new Starlink V2 satellites incorporate improvements to the chassis brightness through dielectric mirrors, off-pointing solar arrays, and black paint on exposed components. For the general case in which the reflectivities are initially unknown, we simulate LSST operations and repeated photometry of every satellite in simulated model constellations. We derive a brightness model of the Starlink V2 satellite and study the simulated apparent brightness as a function of the satellite position relative to the observer and the sun. We find that the V2 Starlink satellites appear brightest at two distinct positions in the sky: when oriented toward the sun at low elevations where light is specularly reflected, and nearly overhead where the satellite is closest to the observer. A simulation of Starlink V2 satellites at 550 km height distributed across a series of Walker constellations with varying inclinations was analyzed to study the impact on the LSST observations. Some bright satellites will be visible in LSST observations. For every thousand V1.5 Starlink satellites imaged by LSST in the first hour of a summer night, we find 1.2 of them will appear brighter than 7 AB magnitude. By comparison, for every thousand V2 Starlink satellites observed, we find only 0.93 of them will appear this bright. The off-pointed solar array and reduced diffuse reflection of the chassis mitigate the brightness. Finally, we simulate lowering this Walker constellation to 350km. Only 0.56 V2 Starlink satellites per thousand brighter than 7 AB magnitude will be observed in the first hour at this height. This is a 40% reduction in number of bright satellites entering the focal plane compared to the constellation at 550km height. We find that a combination of factors yield an apparent surface brightness of these satellites for LSST operations only 5% brighter than at 550km orbit.

 - **Abstract**
 How much of Io's SO$_2$ atmosphere is driven by volcanic outgasing or sublimation of SO$_2$ surface frost is a question with a considerable history. We develop a time dependent surface temperature model including thermal inertia and the exact celestial geometry to model the radiation driven global structure and temporal evolution of Io's atmosphere. We show that many observations can be explained by assuming a purely sublimation driven atmosphere. We find that a thermal diffusivity $\alpha=2.41\times10^{-7}$ m$^2$s$^{-1}$ yields an averaged atmospheric SO$_2$ column density decreasing by more than one order of magnitude from the equator to the poles in accordance with the observed spatial variations of Io's column densities. Our model produces a strong day-night-asymmetry with modeled column density variations of almost two orders of magnitude at the equator as well as a sub-anti-Jovian hemisphere asymmetry, with maximum dayside column densities of $3.7\times10^{16}$ cm$^{-2}$ for the sub-Jovian and $8.5\times10^{16}$ cm$^{-2}$ for the anti-Jovian hemisphere. Both are consistent with the observed temporal and large-scale longitudinal variation of Io's atmosphere. We find that the diurnal variations of the surface temperature affect the subsurface structure up to a depth of 0.6m. Furthermore, we quantify seasonal effects with Io having a northern summer close to perihelion and a northern winter close to aphelion. Finally, we found that at Io's anomalous warm polar regions a conductive heat flux of at least 1.2 Wm$^{-2}$ is necessary to reach surface temperatures consistent with observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Changing-look active galactic nuclei, or CL-AGN, are AGN which appear to transition between Seyfert Type 1 and 2 over periods of months to years. Several mechanisms to trigger these transitions have been proposed, but we have yet to conclusively determine their cause. Recent studies suggest CL-AGN are hosted primarily in galaxies which are shutting down star formation (Dodd et al. 2021; Liu et al. 2021, Wang et al. 2023), which may indicate a link between galaxy quenching and changing look events. We use Prospector stellar population synthesis software (Leja et al. 2017; Johnson & Leja 2017; Johnson et al. 2021) to model non-parametric star formation histories for 39 CL-AGN host galaxies. We find that $43^{+13}_{-12}\%$ of our gold sample CL-AGN at z < 0.15 are star forming, while $29^{+13}_{-10}\%$ fall in the Green Valley of the stellar mass-sSFR diagram. At z > 0.15, $57^{+13}_{-18}\%$ of CL-AGN in the gold sample are star-forming and $29^{+19}_{-14}\%$ are in the Green Valley. CL-AGN hosts have similar star formation properties to the host galaxies of Seyfert 1 and 2 AGN at z < 0.15 and to Seyfert 2 AGN at z > 0.15. We find no statistically significant differences in the star formation properties of turn-on and turn-off CL-AGN. We also find no evidence for rapid quenching in the Green Valley CL-AGN. We conclude that CL-AGN state transitions are not associated with the formation history of CL-AGN host galaxies on large spatial scales, implying CL-AGN state transitions may instead result from nuclear-scale or accretion disk effects.

 - **Abstract**
 The last decade has witnessed significant progress in our understanding of the growth of super-massive black holes (SMBHs). It is now clear that an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN: the observed manifestation of a growing SMBH) is an "event" within the broader lifecycle of a galaxy, which can significantly influence the shape and evolution of the galaxy itself. Our view of the obscuring medium that affects the observed properties of an AGN has also undergone a revolution, and we now have a more physical understanding of the connection between the fuelling of (and feedback from) the SMBH and the broader host-galaxy and larger-scale environment. We have a greater understanding of the physics of SMBH accretion, can identify AGNs out to z = 8-10 witnessing the very earliest phases of SMBH growth, and have a more complete census of AGN activity than ever before. This great progress has been enabled by new innovative facilities, an ever-increasing quantity of multi-wavelength data, the exploitation and development of new techniques, and greater community-wide engagement. In this article we review our understanding of AGNs and the growth of SMBHs, providing an update of the earlier Alexander and Hickox (2012) review. Using citation-network analyses we also show where this review fits within the broader black-hole research literature and, adopting the previous article as a snapshot of the field over a decade ago, identify the drivers that have enabled the greatest scientific progress.

 - **Abstract**
 Using relative stellar astrometry for the detection of coherent gravitational wave sources is a promising method for the microhertz range, where no dedicated detectors currently exist. Compared to other gravitational wave detection techniques, astrometry operates in an extreme high-baseline-number and low-SNR-per-baseline limit, which leads to computational difficulties when using conventional Bayesian search techniques. We extend a technique for efficiently searching pulsar timing array datasets through the precomputation of inner products in the Bayesian likelihood, showing that it is applicable to astrometric datasets. Using this technique, we are able to reduce the total dataset size by up to a factor of $\mathcal{O}(100)$, while remaining accurate to within 1% over two orders of magnitude in gravitational wave frequency. Applying this technique to simulated astrometric datasets for the Kepler Space Telescope and Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope missions, we obtain forecasts for the sensitivity of these missions to coherent gravitational waves. Due to the low angular sky coverage of astrometric baselines, we find that coherent gravitational wave sources are poorly localized on the sky. Despite this, from $10^{-8}$ Hz to $10^{-6}$ Hz, we find that Roman is sensitive to coherent gravitational waves with an instantaneous strain above $h_0 \simeq 10^{-11.4}$, and Kepler is sensitive to strains above $h_0 \simeq $ $10^{-12.4}$. At this strain, we can detect a source with a frequency of $10^{-7}$ Hz and a chirp mass of $10^9$ $M_\odot$ at a luminosity distance of 3.6 Mpc for Kepler, and 0.3 Mpc for Roman.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze the impact of the decaying magnetic turbulence of primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) and ambipolar diffusion on the ionization and thermal history of the Dark Ages Universe ($30\le z\le300$), and its imprint on the spectral profile of the global signal in the 21 cm hydrogen line. The heating function caused by decaying magnetic turbulence monotonically decreases after cosmological recombination, its amplitude strongly depends on the strength of the PMFs $B_0$ and weakly depends on the spectral index of the initial power spectrum of PMFs $n_{\rm B}$. The heating function caused by ambipolar diffusion, in contrast, noticeably depends on the spectral index in the range $-3\lesssim n_{\rm B}\lesssim-1$, but is subdominant in the Dark Ages epoch for PMF models with $B_0\lesssim0.5$ nG. We computed the ionization and thermal history of intergalactic gas from the cosmological recombination up to the end of the Dark Ages epoch for a range of PMF parameters $0.05\lesssim B_0\lesssim0.5$ nG, $-2.9\lesssim n_{\rm B}\lesssim4$ and show the essentially distinguished thermal evolution from one in the $\Lambda$CDM model. We also show that the profile of the redshifted 21 cm hydrogen line is very sensitive to the PMF parameters from this range and can be used for their constraints in conjunction with other observational data.

 - **Abstract**
 Line resolved X-ray spectra of outflows from X-ray binaries are interesting since they provide quantifiable measures of the accreted material on to the compact object (black hole or neutron star), which can not be observed directly in the accretion disk. One such measurement that has been largely overlooked is that of the elemental abundances, which potentially provide insights into the origin of the ejected material. Using the Chandra/HETG grating spectrometer we measure and present elemental abundances in four low-mass X-ray binaries. We compare two measurement methods. One is by fitting line series of individual ions and reconstructing the absorption measure distribution (AMD), and the other is a global fit with one or two individual ionization components. All outflows feature a steep AMD strongly favoring high ionization degrees. The present abundances are consistent with previous works suggesting the abundances in the outflows are non-solar. We find a tentative trend of increasing abundances with atomic number, which fits some core-collapse supernova models, but no exact match to a specific one.

 - **Abstract**
 Metal-bearing species in diffuse or molecular clouds are often overlooked in astrochemical modeling except for the charge exchange process. However, catalytic cycles involving these metals can affect the abundance of other compounds. We prepared a comprehensive chemical network for Na, Mg, Al, Fe, K, and Si-containing species. Assuming water as the major constituent of interstellar ice in dark clouds, quantum chemical calculations were carried out to estimate the binding energy of important metallic species, considering amorphous solid water as substrate. Significantly lower binding energies (approximately 5 to 6 times) were observed for Na and Mg, while the value for Fe was roughly 4 times higher than what was used previously. Here, we calculated binding energy values for Al and K, for which no prior guesses were available. The total dipole moments and enthalpies of formation for several newly included species are unknown. Furthermore, the assessment of reaction enthalpies is necessary to evaluate the feasibility of the new reactions under interstellar conditions. These parameters were estimated and subsequently integrated into models. Some additional species that were not included in the UMIST/KIDA database have been introduced. The addition of these new species, along with their corresponding reactions, appears to significantly affect the abundances of related species. Some key reactions that significantly influence general metal-related chemistry include: $\rm{M^+ + H_2 \rightarrow M{H_2}^+ + h\nu}$, $\rm{MH + O \rightarrow MO + H}$ ($\rm{M \ = \ Fe, \ Na, \ Mg, \ Al, \ K}$), and $\rm{M_1^+ + M_2H \rightarrow M_1H + M_2^+}$ (where $\rm{M_1 \neq M_2}$, $M_1, \ M_2 \ = \ Na, \ Mg, \ Al, \ K, \ Fe$). Significant changes were observed in magnesium and sodium-bearing cyanides, isocyanides, and aluminum fluoride when additional reaction pathways were considered.
#### The evolution of chromospheric quiet-sun bright points during their lifetime

 - **Abstract**
 Bright points (BPs) are ubiquitous, small-scale energetic events with multithermal signatures, typically observed in the chromosphere and linked to both photospheric structure and coronal composition. Their evolution is influenced by various physical processes, including plasma dynamics and magnetic interactions. This paper examines BP evolution using a large statistical sample, focusing on when they reach maximum values for key attributes, and explores differences between BPs in the "Active Quiet Sun" (AQS, above the network) and the "True Quiet Sun" (TQS, above the internetwork). Observed attributes include maximum brightness (total and intrinsic), plane-of-sky (POS) speed, travel distance, acceleration, and apparent size (POS area). BPs can reach maximum brightness and size at almost any time during their lifetime, likely due to complex chromospheric interactions. AQS and TQS BPs show similar behaviour overall and tend to reach maximum POS speed around the midpoint of their lifetimes. Positive acceleration usually occurs early, while negative acceleration is more common near the end. Preliminary results suggest two distinct BP regimes with differing relationships between intrinsic brightness and area. We interpret these trends as evidence that BPs, whether due to plasma motion or a heating event, follow arched paths -- likely along short magnetic loops. In this model, the midpoint of a BP's life corresponds to the crest of the arch, producing the greatest POS speeds. Reconnection may occur at a footpoint, with the BP moving along the loop before returning to the photosphere. Deviations from this expected evolution may result from complex chromospheric interactions or BPs with highly non-linear POS motions.
#### The H$α$ line as a probe of chromospheric magnetic fields

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the diagnostic potential of the H$\alpha$ line for probing the chromospheric magnetic field using a realistic 3D radiative magnetohydrodynamic (rMHD) model. The Stokes profiles of the H$\alpha$ line are synthesized through full 3D radiative transfer under the field-free approximation, alongside the Ca II 8542 Å and Fe I 6173 Å lines for comparison. The line-of-sight (LOS) magnetic fields are inferred using the weak field approximation (WFA) for theH$\alpha$ and Ca II 8542 Å lines, while the Fe I 6173 Å line is analyzed through Milne-Eddington inversion techniques. The comparison between the inferred LOS magnetic field maps and the magnetic fields in the rMHD model revealed that the H$\alpha$ line core primarily probes the chromospheric magnetic field at log tau_500 = -5.7, which corresponds to higher layers than the Ca II 8542 Å line core, which is most sensitive to conditions at log tau_500 = -5.1. On average, the Stokes V profiles of the H$\alpha$ line core form 500 km higher than those of the Ca II 8542 Å line core. The H$\alpha$ polarization signals persist after adding noise, and with noise at the level of 10^-3 Ic, most simulated magnetic structures remain visible. These findings suggest that spectropolarimetric observations of the H$\alpha$ line can provide complementary insights into the stratification of the magnetic field at higher altitudes, especially when recorded simultaneously with widely used chromospheric diagnostics such as the Ca II 8542 Å line.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new method to calculate the polarised synchrotron emission of radio AGN sources using magnetic field information from 3-dimensional relativistic magnetohydrodynamical (RMHD) simulations. Like its predecessor, which uses pressure as a proxy for the magnetic field, this method tracks the spatially resolved adiabatic and radiative loss processes using the method adapted from the Radio AGN in Semi-analytic Environments formalism. Lagrangian tracer particles in RMHD simulations carried out using the PLUTO code are used to track the fluid quantities of each `ensemble of electrons' through time to calculate the radio emissivity ex-situ. By using the magnetic field directly from simulations, the full set of linear Stokes parameters I, Q, and U can be calculated to study the synthetic radio polarisation of radio AGN sources. We apply this method to a suite of RMHD simulations to study their polarisation properties. The turbulent magnetic field present in radio lobes influences the emission, causing a complex clumpy structure that is visible at high resolution. Our synthetic polarisation properties are consistent with observations; we find that the fractional polarisation is highest (approximately 50 percent) at the lobe edges. We show that for the same source, the integrated and mean fractional polarisation depends on viewing angle to the source. At oblique viewing angles the behaviour of the integrated and mean fractional polarisation over time depends on the morphology of the jet cocoon. Using Faraday rotation measures, we reproduce known depolarisation effects such as the Laing-Garrington depolarisation asymmetry in jets angled to the line of sight. We show that the hotspots and hence the Fanaroff-Riley classification become less clear with our new, more accurate method.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed X-ray/UV high-time resolution monitoring of the final reflaring phase of the accreting millisecond pulsar SAX~J1808.4$-$3658. During its 2022 outburst, we obtained simultaneous XMM-Newton and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations. We detected coherent X-ray pulsations down to a 0.5-10~keV luminosity of $L_{X(low)\,0.5-10} \simeq 6.21^{+0.20}_{-0.15} \times 10^{34} \, d^2_{3.5}\,\mathrm{erg \, s^{-1}}$, among the lowest ever observed in this source. The uninterrupted coverage provided by XMM-Newton enabled a detailed characterisation of the spectral and temporal evolution of the source X-ray emission as the flux varied by approximately one order of magnitude. At the lowest flux levels, we observed significant variations in pulse amplitude and phase correlated with the X-ray source flux. We found a sharp phase jump of $\sim 0.4$ cycles, accompanied by a doubling of the pulse amplitude and a softening of the X-ray emission. We interpret the changes in the X-ray pulse profiles as drifts of emission regions on the neutron star surface due to an increase of the inner disk radius occurring when the mass accretion rate decreases. The phase evolution was consistent with a magnetospheric radius scaling as $R_{m} \propto \dot{M}^{\Lambda}$, with $\Lambda = -0.17(9)$, in broad agreement with theoretical predictions. Simultaneous HST observations confirmed the presence of significant UV pulsations. The measured pulsed luminosity $-$ $L_{pulsed}^{UV} = (9 \pm 2) \times 10^{31} \, \text{erg} \, \text{s}^{-1}$ $-$ was approximately half that observed during the 2019 outburst, but the pulsed X-ray to UV luminosity ratio simultaneously measured remained consistent. Yet, such a UV luminosity exceeds the predictions of standard emission models, as further confirmed by the shape of the pulsed spectral energy distribution.

 - **Abstract**
 The nature of dark energy remains one of the most profound mysteries in modern cosmology. One intriguing proposal is that black holes (BHs) could be the astrophysical source of dark energy through a cosmological coupling mechanism, and strong evidence has been claimed via analyzing the growth of the black hole masses in the red-sequence elliptical galaxies at redshifts $\leq 2.5$. In this work, with a group of very high redshift AGNs detected by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in the red-sequence elliptical galaxies, we show that the possibility of BHs being the astrophysical source of dark energy has been rejected at a confidence level exceeding 10$\sigma$. Moreover, it turns out that the Little Red Dots recently discovered by JWST, characterized by the low accretion rates, can naturally evolve into the red-sequence elliptical galaxies hosting the relatively low mass black holes at the redshifts of $\sim 0.7-2.5$, without the need of black hole cosmological coupling.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate broad emission-line wings, reaching velocities up to 800 km/s, observed in 26 galaxies with Lyman continuum (LyC) observations, primarily from the Low-redshift Lyman Continuum Survey (LzLCS). Using Magellan/MIKE, VLT/X-shooter, and WHT/ISIS high-resolution spectroscopy, we show that this fast gas appears to probe the dominant feedback mechanisms linked to LyC escape. We find that in 14 galaxies, the wings are best fit with power laws with slopes -3.5 to -1.6, with four others best fit by Gaussians of width ~300 km/s; the remaining eight show ambiguous wing morphologies. Gaussian wings are found only at low O32 = [O III]5007/[O II]3726,3729 and high metallicity, while power-law wings span the full range of these parameters. The general evidence suggests a dual-mode paradigm for LyC escape: radiation-driven superwinds traced by power-law wings and supernova-driven feedback traced by Gaussian wings. For the former, the < 3 Myr-old, pre-supernova stellar population correlates with more luminous, faster winds. The data also show that radiation-driven wind parameters like wind luminosity and power-law slope depend on the UV luminosity more than the optically thick covering fraction, consistent with ``picket-fence" radiative transfer. Observed wing slope values flatten with both escaping LyC luminosity and higher extinction, while still preserving the anticorrelation between these two quantities. Additionally, the differential between red and blue slopes implies that extinction and dense gas are centrally concentrated relative to the wind emission. Overall, our results show that power-law emission-line wings probe LyC-driven winds and LyC escape in metal-poor starbursts.

 - **Abstract**
 Low-m inertial modes have been recently discovered in the Sun's high-latitude regions. In this study, we characterize the observational properties of the m = 1 mode by analyzing time-distance subsurface flow maps. Synoptic flow maps, constructed from daily subsurface flow maps using a tracking rate corresponding to the rotation at latitude 65 degrees, are filtered in both the spherical harmonic and Fourier domains to retain only the m = 1 mode and its dominant frequencies. Our analysis reveals a power distribution that is significantly stronger in the northern polar region. The mode's power exhibits an anti-correlation with solar activity, remaining strong and persistent during the solar activity minimum and becoming weaker and more fragmented during the solar maximum. Magnetic flux transported from low to high latitudes influences both the mode's power and lifetime, enhancing its power and shortening its lifetime upon arrival. The phases of the m = 1 mode in the northern and southern polar regions are near-antisymmetric for most of the time with short deviations. We also compute zonal and meridional phase velocities of the mode and find that it exhibits significantly less differential rotation than its surrounding plasma. The meridional phase velocity, comprising both the local plasma's meridional flow and the mode's intrinsic phase motion, is directed poleward below latitude 70 degrees and equatorward above this latitude. These observational findings underscore the need for a deeper understanding of the internal dynamics of the low-m modes, which may offer valuable insights into the structure and dynamics of the solar interior.

 - **Abstract**
 The outer regions of the protoplanetary disc surrounding the T Tauri star HD 143006 show rings, dust asymmetries and shadows. Whilst rings and dust asymmetries can arise from companions and other mechanisms, shadows and misaligned discs in particular are typically attributed to the presence of misaligned planets or stellar-mass companions. To understand the mechanisms that drive these traits, the innermost regions of discs need to be studied. Using CHARA/MIRCX and VLTI/PIONIER, we observed the sub-au region of HD 143006. We constrain the orientation of the inner disc of HD 143006 and probe whether a misalignment between the inner and outer disc could be the cause of the shadows. Modelling the visibilities using a geometric model, the inclination and position angle are found to be $i=22^\circ\pm 3^\circ$ and $\mathrm{PA}=158^\circ\pm 8^\circ$ respectively, with an inner dust sublimation radius of $\sim0.04$ au. The inner disc is misaligned by $39^\circ\pm4^\circ$ with respect to the outer disc, with the far side of the inner disc to the east and the far side of the outer disc to the west. We constrain $h/R$ (scattering surface/radius of scattered light) of the outer disc at $18$ au to be about $13\%$ by calculating the offset between the shadow position and the central star. No companion was detected, with a magnitude contrast of $4.4$ in the H-band and placing an upper mass limit of $0.17 M_\odot$ at separations of $0-8$ au. Therefore, we cannot confirm or rule out that a low-mass star or giant planet is responsible for the misalignment and dust sub-structures.

 Aims. We investigate the impact of ambipolar diffusion on the development of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability (RTI) with an oblique magnetic field in the incompressible limit. Methods. We developed a general bi-fluid framework comprising charges and neutrals with the specific feature of differing gravity between charges and neutrals. We derived the perturbed magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations and obtained an analytic dispersion relation for an oblique magnetic field. The growth rate was then evaluated using a numerical integration of the dispersion relation. In particular, we focussed on the anisotropy in the mode growth induced ambipolar diffusion. Results. In contrast to the case of a magnetic field within the interface, an oblique magnetic field is much less restrictive with respect to the wavenumbers that can develop; rather than a sharp cut-off, it results in a selection of preferred scales for mode growth. The presence of a second neutral fluid that is insensitive to gravity tends to amplify the anisotropy in the possible direction of the instability development. In particular, we show that this effect is maximal when the coupling is in an intermediate range between full and no charge-neutral coupling, specifically in the region where the ambipolar diffusion is highest.

 - **Abstract**
 Currently, achieving a balance between computational efficiency, accuracy, and numerical stability in CME simulations, particularly in the sub-Alfv{'e}nic coronal region, remains a significant challenge. This paper aims to address the challenge by integrating observational data and developing advanced numerical algorithms, focusing on reproducing large-scale CME evolutions that are consistent with observations in the coronal region. Based on the recently developed fully implicit thermodynamic MHD coronal model (Wang et al. 2025a), we further use an observation-based RBSL flux rope to trigger a CME event during CR 2111. Additionally, we improve the temporal accuracy using a 2nd-order accurate ESDIRK2 method, with the intermediate stage solutions computed by the 2nd-order accurate BDF2 pseudo-time marching method. To enhance the numerical stability of ESDIRK2, we apply approximate linearisation in the implicitly solved intermediate stages. Furthermore, we adjust the time-evolving magnetic field B1 to zero at the end of each physical time step to further validate the extended magnetic field decomposition approach proposed by (Wang et al. 2025a). It is noticed that the model successfully reproduces the CME evolution consistent with white-light coronagraph observations, enables faster-than-real-time CME propagation simulations from solar surface to 0.1 AU using only a few dozen CPU cores on approximately 1 million grid cells, and remains numerically stable in CME simulations involving low-\b{eta} regions. The simulation results show that this novel MHD coronal model, combined with an observation-based magnetic flux rope, is sufficiently numerically stable and computationally efficient to reproduce real CME events propagating through the sub-Alfv{é}nic coronal region. Thus, the observation-based CME model is well suited for practical applications in daily space weather forecasting.

 - **Abstract**
 The existence of high galactic latitude molecular clouds has been known for several decades, and studies of their dust and gas distributions reveal complicated morphological structures. Their dynamics involve turbulence even in the absence of internal energy sources such as stars. We study in detail two such clouds, MBM 3 and MBM 16, trying to recover the geometric structure and topology of the gas distribution. In particular, we address the evidence of superthermal asymmetric atomic and molecular line profiles as a result of filament superposition combined with turbulent motions. We use a variety of spectroscopic and imaging archival observations of the gas and dust components. The spectroscopic data set comprises HI 21 cm, 12CO, 13CO, and CH line profiles. We also use archival infrared images to study the dust distribution and temperature. To understand the topology of MBM 3 and MBM 16 we compare molecular and atomic spectra, along with profile decomposition of the HI 21 cm line. Standard tools such as Structure Functions of velocity centroids are used to characterise the turbulence in MBM 3, and channel maps and position-velocity diagrams are employed for elucidating the filament topology of both clouds. The unusually large linewidths previously reported for MBM 3 are due to superposition of individual filaments whose superthermal linewidths are about 1 km/s. In MBM 16, the cloud appears to decompose into two adjacent structures with similar properties. The filaments have a high aspect ratio, with lengths of about 1 pc and widths of about 0.1 pc. In general, the molecular gas is embedded within more extended neutral hydrogen structures. Velocity gradients found within these structures are not necessarily dynamical, convergent flows. Projection effects and topology of the driving flows produce signatures that mimic velocity shears even if they are simply distortions of ordered gas.

 - **Abstract**
 The O'Connell effect is a phenomenon in eclipsing binary (EB) systems that consists of unequal maxima in a light curve when out of eclipse. Despite being known for decades and with several theories proposed over the years, this effect is still not fully understood. Our goal is to find different O'Connell effect properties using a multiband approach, compare them with each other, and find correlations between these properties and the physical parameters of the systems. We present the analysis of 14 new EBs that show the O'Connell effect using multiband data extracted from the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) and Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) all-sky surveys. We measured the difference in maximum amplitudes (delta m) alongside different light curve features in different passbands via a new modeling process that uses Gaussian fits. We created a brand-new phenomenological model for O'Connell effect systems whose analysis had previously been hampered by overfitting. Although the magnitude of the O'Connell effect seems to be more pronounced at shorter effective wavelengths, supporting the idea that cool starspots cause the effect, a conclusive correlation is not found. On the other hand, we do find strong correlations between the magnitude of the effect and both the temperature and the period, both of which are inconsistent with a previous study. We also find that in systems that show both positive and negative O'Connell effects, there are different correlations with the aforementioned parameters. We conclude that, even though starspots may be one cause of the O'Connell effect, it is likely a multipronged phenomenon; for instance, the physical interaction between the components of close binary stars may be another important factor.

 - **Abstract**
 External photoevaporation of protoplanetary discs, by massive O stars in stellar clusters, is thought to be a significant process in the evolution of a disc. It has been shown to result in significant mass loss and disc truncation, ultimately reducing the lifetime of the discs, and possibly affecting potential planet populations. It is a well-studied process in the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) where the cometary morphology of proplyds is spatially resolvable due to its proximity to Earth. However, we need to study external photoevaporation in additional stellar clusters to better understand its prevalence and significance more globally. Unfortunately, more massive stellar clusters where the majority of stars form are much farther away than the ONC. In these more distant clusters the proplyds are spatially unresolvable with current facilities, hence the cometary morphology is not a useful identification of external photoevaporation. Therefore, in order to identify and interpret external photoevaporation, the only observations we have are of spatially unresolved emission lines. To resolve this issue we have used the CLOUDY code to develop an approximate general model of the emission lines emanating from the hot ionized wind of a proplyd. We have used the model to determine which line ratios are most sensitive to the distance from an OB star, and found that the most sensitive line ratios vary by multiple orders of magnitude over an FUV field of between 10$^3$ G$_0$ to 10$^6$ G$_0$. By identifying spatial gradients of line ratios in stellar clusters, we can identify regions of ongoing external photoevaporation.
