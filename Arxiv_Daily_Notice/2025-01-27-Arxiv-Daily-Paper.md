 - **Abstract**
 Extreme coronal line emitters (ECLEs) are a rare class of galaxy that exhibit strong, high-ionization iron coronal emission lines in their spectra. In some cases, these lines are transient and may be the result of tidal disruption event (TDEs). To test this connection, we calculate the rate of variable ECLEs (vECLEs) at redshift $\sim0.3$. We search for ECLEs in the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) LOWZ sample and discover two candidate ECLEs. Using follow-up spectra from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument and Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph, and mid-infrared observations from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, we determine that one of these galaxies is a vECLE. Using this galaxy, we calculate the galaxy-normalized vECLE rate at redshift $\sim0.3$ to be $R_\mathrm{G}=1.6~^{+3.8}_{-1.4}\times10^{-6}~\mathrm{galaxy}^{-1}~\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ and the mass-normalized rate to be $R_\mathrm{M}=7~^{+16}_{-6}\times10^{-18}~\mathrm{M_\odot^{-1}}~\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. This is then converted to a volumetric rate of $R_\mathrm{V}=1.8~^{+4.5}_{-1.5}\times10^{-9}~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-3}~\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. Formally, the LOWZ vECLE rates are $2-4$ times lower than the rates calculated from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Legacy sample at redshift $\sim0.1$. However, given the large uncertainties on both measurements, they are consistent with each other at $1\sigma$. Both the galaxy-normalized and volumetric rates are one to two orders of magnitude lower than TDE rates from the literature, consistent with vECLEs being caused by $5-20$ per cent of all TDEs.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze 23 spectroscopically confirmed Type-2 quasars (QSOs) selected from the WISE 22$\rm \mu$m band in the SDSS Stripe 82 region, focusing on their multi-band photometry and spectral energy distributions (SEDs). These objects were selected to be IR-luminous ($\rm flux_{W4} > 5mJy$, i.e., $12.62 < W4 < 14.62 \rm\ AB \, magnitude$), optically faint ($r > 23$) or with red color ($r - W4 >8.38$). Gemini/GNIRS observations were conducted for all 24 candidates, and 18/24 were also observed with Keck/LRIS. The observations confirm 23 to be real Type-2 QSOs in the redshift range $0.88 - 2.99$ (12 are at $z>2$). We collect multi-band photometry and conduct SED fitting. The composite photometry probes the wavelength from 0.1$\rm \mu$m to 10$\rm \mu$m at the rest frame. The IR emission is dominated by dust torus implying an average torus luminosity for the sample of $L_{\rm torus} 10^{46.84} \rm erg/s$. The origin of the rest-UV/optical light is not definitive, but we present three possible scenarios: scattered light, stellar emission, and the reddened accretion disk. Assuming an obscured:unobscured ratio of approximately 1:1, our targets have $L_{\rm bol} = 10^{46.28} \rm erg \,s^{-1} - 10^{47.49} \rm erg \,s^{-1}$ and around SMBH masses $\rm 10^{8.18} M_{\odot} - 10^{9.39} M_{\odot}$, assuming they accreate at the Eddington limit. Compared to previous Type-2 AGN SEDs, our targets have a brighter dust torus and redder optical-IR color. By comparing the SED to the results from JWST `little red dots' (LRDs), we find that these IR-selected Type-2 QSOs have similar SED shapes to the LRDs. This pilot Type-2 QSO survey demonstrates that mid-IR selection is an efficient way to find luminous Type-2 QSOs at $z>2$. Finally, the composite photometry and Type-2 QSOs SED model generated by this sample provide a guide for finding more Type-2 QSOs at higher redshift.

 - **Abstract**
 We search a sample of 9,361,613 isolated sources with 13<g<14.5 mag for slowly varying sources. We select sources with brightness changes larger than ~ 0.03 mag/year over 10 years, removing false positives due to, for example, nearby bright stars or high proper motions. After a thorough visual inspection, we find 782 slowly varying systems. Of these systems, 433 are identified as variables for the first time and 349 are previously classified as variables. Previously classified systems were mostly identified as semi-regular variables (SR), slow irregular variables (L), spotted stars (ROT), or unknown (MISC or VAR), as long time scale variability does not fit into a standard class. The stellar sources are scattered across the CMD and can be placed into 5 groups that exhibit distinct behaviors. The largest groups are very red subgiants and lower main sequence stars. There are also a small number of AGN. There are 551 candidates (~70 percent) that also show shorter time scale periodic variability, mostly with periods longer than 10 days. The variability of 191 of these candidates may be related to dust.

 - **Abstract**
 Feedback from black hole-powered jets has been invoked in many cosmological simulations to regulate star formation and quench galaxies. Despite this, observational evidence of how jets might be able to affect their hosts remains scarce, especially for low power jets in halos smaller than clusters. Recent observations of outflows around FR0 galaxies, that host compact radio-loud sources, imply that lower-power jetted active galactic nuclei (AGN) may have a significant impact on their hosts through jet interactions with the interstellar medium (ISM). Using the Arepo code, we launch jets of low and intermediate power (10$^{38}$ - 10$^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$) within a ~kpc-scale periodic box with driven turbulence to study how the jets propagate through a turbulent ISM. Our simulation results broadly fit into three different scenarios $\unicode{x2013}$ jets penetrating easily through the ISM, becoming completely stalled, or the interesting intermediate stage, when jets are highly disturbed and redirected. We suggest that intermediate power jets do not have enough ram pressure to affect the turbulent structure of the ISM, and so only fill pre-existing cavities. Low-power jets are able to drive outflows in a hot phase ($>10^{4.4}$ K). However, warm (~$10^4$ K) ionized gas outflows appear under certain conditions. This work is part of the ''Learning the Universe'' collaboration, aiming to build next-generation cosmological simulations that incorporate a new prescription for AGN feedback.

 - **Abstract**
 We test a novel method for estimating black hole masses ($M_{\rm BH}$) in obscured active galactic nuclei (AGN) that uses proxies to measure the full-width half maximum of broad H$\alpha$ (FWHM$_{\rm bH\alpha}$) and the accretion disk luminosity at 5100 Angstrom ($\lambda L_{\rm 5100 Angstrom}$). Using a published correlation, we estimate FWHM$_{\rm bH\alpha}$ from the narrow optical emission line ratio $L_{\rm [O\,III]}/L_{\rm nH\beta}$. Using a sample of 99 local obscured AGN from the Swift-BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey, we assess the agreement between estimating $\lambda L_{\rm 5100 Angstrom}$ from the intrinsic 2-10 keV X-ray luminosity and from narrow optical emission lines. We find a mean offset of $0.32 \pm 0.68$ dex between these methods, which propagates to a factor of $\sim$2 uncertainty when estimating $M_{\rm BH}$ using a virial mass formula where $L_{\rm [O\,III]}/L_{\rm nH\beta}$ serves as a proxy of FWHM$_{\rm bH\alpha}$ ($M_{\rm BH,[O\,III]/nH\beta}$). We compare $M_{\rm BH,[O\,III]/nH\beta}$ with virial $M_{\rm BH}$ measurements from broad Paschen emission lines. For the 14 (12) BASS AGN with broad Pa$\alpha$ (Pa$\beta$) detections, we find $M_{\rm BH,[O\,III]/nH\beta}$ to be systematically higher than $M_{\rm BH,Pa\alpha}$ ($M_{\rm BH,Pa\beta}$) by a factor of 0.39 $\pm$ 0.44 dex (0.48 $\pm$ 0.51 dex). Since these offsets are within the scatter, more data are needed to assess whether $M_{\rm BH,[O\,III]/nH\beta}$ is biased high. For 151 BASS AGN with measured stellar velocity dispersions ($\sigma_{\rm *}$), we find that the $\sigma_{\rm *}$-derived $M_{\rm BH}$ agrees with $M_{\rm BH,[O\,III]/nH\beta}$ to within 0.08 dex, albeit with wide scatter (0.74 dex). The method tested here can provide estimates of $M_{\rm BH}$ in thousands of obscured AGN in spectroscopic surveys when other diagnostics are not available, though with an uncertainty of $\sim$3-5.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of very metal-poor (VMP) and metal-poor stars ($-3.0 < \mathrm{Fe/H]} < -1.5$) in the Gaia BP/RP or XP catalog, which reveals two distinct metallicity distribution functions (MDFs) in regions of the Galactic disk above and below $|z| = 1.0$ kpc. The low-$|z|$ regions display a metallicity peak around [Fe/H] = -2.0 with a sharp transition in Galactocentric azimuthal velocity ($v_\phi$), a feature notably absent in high-$|z|$ regions. Using a galactic chemical evolution (GCE) model, we found that the proto-Milky Way underwent two distinct formation scenarios: a rapid star formation burst followed by quenching near the Galactic center and an extended period of steady star formation. This starburst could have been triggered by a gas-rich accretion event in the first Gyr of our Galaxy's history. Comparison with Milky Way-analog galaxies in Auriga simulations shows strong agreement in the characteristics of this starburst population. During the accretion event, gas rapidly sinks into the inner regions of these analog galaxies, producing the observed MDF peak and the low $v_\phi$ values. The simulations further indicate that most stars at the metallicity peak formed in situ, rather than through accretion. These findings identify this starburst population as the long-sought in situ component of the proto-Galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 Brown dwarfs lack nuclear fusion and cool with time; the coldest known have an effective temperature below 500 K, and are known as Y dwarfs. We present a James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) photometric dataset of Y dwarfs: twenty-three were imaged in wide-field mode, 20 using NIRCam with the F150W and F480M filters, and 3 using NIRISS with the F480M filter. We present an F480M vs. F150W $-$ F480M color-magnitude diagram for our sample, and other brown dwarfs with F150W and F480M colors synthesized from JWST spectra by Beiler et al. (2024). For one target, WISEA J083011.95$+$283716.0, its detection in the near-infrared confirms it as one of the reddest Y dwarfs known, with F150W $-$ F480M $= 9.62$ mag. We provide its updated parallax and proper motion. One of the Beiler et al. Y dwarfs, CWISEP J104756.81+545741.6, is unusually blue, consistent with strong CO absorption seen in its spectrum which the F480M filter is particularly sensitive to. The strong CO and the kinematics of the object suggest it may be very low-mass and young. We update the resolved photometry for the close binary system WISE J033605.05$-$014350.4 AB, and find that the secondary is almost as cold as WISE 085510.83$-$071442.5, with $T_{\rm eff} \lesssim 300$ K, however the F150W $-$ F480M color is significantly bluer, possibly suggesting the presence of water clouds. Astrometry is measured at the JWST epoch for the sample which is consistent with parallax and proper motion values reported by Kirkpatrick et al. (2021) and Marocco et al. (in prep).

 - **Abstract**
 The Ultraviolet Explorer (UVEX) is expected to fly in 2030 and will have the opportunity -- and the rapid near/far ultraviolet (UV) capabilities -- to glean unprecedented insight into the bright UV emission present in kilonovae like that of AT 170817gfo, the electromagnetic counterpart to binary neutron star merger GW170817. To do so, it will need to perform prompt target-of-opportunity observations following detection of binary neutron star mergers by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA gravitational observatories. We present initial simulations to develop UVEX target-of-opportunity strategies for such events and provide the community with detailed initial estimates of the prospects for and characteristics of UVEX target-of-opportunity observations following gravitational-wave events, considering fiducial scenarios for the fifth and sixth LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing runs. Additionally, in light of the relatively few binary neutron star mergers observed since GW170817, we consider variant target-of-opportunity strategies for UVEX to maximize scientific gain in the case of a lowered binary neutron star merger rate.

 - **Abstract**
 We present data processing and verification of the Southern Twenty-centimetre All-sky Polarization Survey (STAPS) conducted with Murriyang, the Parkes 64-m telescope. The survey covers the sky area of -89<Dec<0 and the frequency range of 1.3-1.8 GHz split into 1-MHz channels. STAPS was observed commensally with the S-band Polarization All-Sky Survey (S-PASS). The survey is composed of long azimuth scans, which allows us to absolutely calibrate Stokes Q and U with the data processing procedure developed for S-PASS. We obtain I, Q, and U maps in both flux density scale (Jy/beam) and main beam brightness temperature scale (K), for the 301 frequency channels with sufficiently good data. The temperature scale is tied to the Global Magneto-ionic Medium Survey (GMIMS) high-band north sky survey conducted with the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory 26-m telescope. All the STAPS maps are smoothed to a common resolution of 20 arcmin. The rms noise per channel ranges from about 16 mK to 8 mK for I, and from about 8 mK to 5 mK for Q and U at frequencies from 1.3 to 1.8 GHz. The rms noise in Q and U varies with declination and reaches minimum at declination of -89 degree. We also run rotation measure (RM) synthesis and RM clean to obtain peak polarized intensity and Faraday depth maps. The whole STAPS data processing is validated by comparing flux densities of compact sources, pixel flux density versus pixel flux density for Cen A, pixel temperature versus pixel temperature for the entire survey area, and RMs of extragalactic sources between STAPS and other measurements. The uncertainty of the flux density scale is less than 10%. STAPS delivers an L-band (20 cm) multi-frequency polarization view of the Galaxy, and will help advance our understanding of the Galactic magnetic field and magnetized interstellar medium.

 - **Abstract**
 Rapidly rotating newborn magnetars, which originate from binary neutron star (NS) mergers and serve as the central engines of short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), may leave some imprints on their prompt gamma-ray lightcurves even though they are far from their radiating fireballs. A high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) would be a unique feature for the magnetar central engine, especially a hypermassive magnetar. By conducting a systematic analysis of the prompt gamma-ray lightcurves from 605 short GRBs observed by Fermi/GBM, we have identified such QPO signals in three GRBs (e.g., GRB 120323A, GRB 181222B, and GRB 190606A). The QPOs that peaked at $1258^{+6}_{-6}$ Hz for GRB 120323A, $623^{+4}_{-4}$ Hz for GRB 181222B, and $1410^{+4}_{-5}$ Hz for GRB 190606A are all with a confidence level above 5.2 $\sigma$. The high-frequency QPO signals of those three short GRBs may be caused by a hypermassive magnetar acting as the central engine in a binary neutron star merger of binary neutron star.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are energetic millisecond radio bursts at cosmological distances, whose underlying engine is not identified. Among a sub-population that emit repeated radio bursts, a handful were associated with a persistent radio source (PRS) whose origin is unknown. Here we report the discovery of a compact flaring radio source (FRS) associated with a newly-active repeating FRB within one month after the first radio burst was detected. Its temporal and spectral characteristics differ from those of the PRSs but are similar to those of engine-powered supernovae and low-luminosity active galactic nuclei. We detected a spectral peak around $1.6\pm0.2$ GHz that is consistent with synchrotron self-absorption. Assuming equipartition, the magnetic field strength in the FRS is larger than the line-of-sight component constrained from the FRB Faraday rotation, suggesting a highly magnetized engine. The radius of the FRS is constrained to be $\sim0.03$ pc and the minimum total energy is $\sim~6.2\times{10}^{47}~{\rm ergs~}$. This FRS reveals the birth of a highly magnetized FRB engine, and hints that PRSs associated with other active FRBs may be in the later stage of evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 In autumn 2023, a series of closely timed eruptive events were observed remotely and measured in situ. We studied analogous solar events, where several CMEs were launched partly from the same (active) regions near a CH. These events occurred in two episodes, separated by a full solar rotation, covering October 31-November 3 and November 27-28, 2023. Both episodes are linked to strong geomagnetic storms on November 4-5 and December 1-2, 2023. We aim to understand the complexity of these events and how the global magnetic field, solar wind conditions, and structural interactions relate to the observed geomagnetic effects. Using the GCS 3D reconstruction method, we derived each CME's motion direction and speed. These results were input into the DBM with enhanced latitudinal information (3D DBM), aiding in connecting in-situ measurements with solar surface structures for integrated interpretation. The first episode caused SAR arcs, with a three-step Dst index drop to -163 nT on November 5, 2023. Two CME-related shocks arrived close in time, separated by a SBC, followed by a short-duration flux rope-like structure. The second episode saw auroral lights and a two-step Dst index drop to -108 nT on December 1, 2023. A shock from one CME interacted with the magnetic structure of a preceding CME, again combined with an SBC. A clear flux rope structure from the shock-producing CME was detected. Both events showed distinct magnetic field 'ripples' and fluctuations in density and temperature following the SBC. This study compares two episodes of multiple eruptive events in November and December 2023. Interacting CME structures and SBC-related magnetic modulations contributed to the stronger geomagnetic impacts, particularly in the November 4-5, 2023 event. The highly tilted heliospheric current sheet may have further influenced the CMEs' impact at Earth.

 - **Abstract**
 Polarimetric observations of X-ray pulsars (XRPs) have provided us with the key to unlocking their geometrical properties. Thanks to the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) the geometries of several XRPs have been determined, providing new insights into their emission mechanisms and magnetic field structures. Previously, Vela X-1 has proven to be exceptional in demonstrating a clear energy dependence of its polarimetric properties, showing a 90$^{\circ}$ swing in the polarization angle (PA) between low and high energies. Due to the complex energy-dependent nature of the polarization properties, it was not possible to determine the pulsar geometry. In this work, we present the results of a detailed analysis of the pulse phase-resolved polarization properties of at different energies. By separating the polarimetric analysis into low and high energy ranges, we are able to disentangle the contributions of the soft and hard spectral components to the polarization, revealing the pulse phase dependence of polarization degree (PD) and PA in each energy band. The PA pulse phase dependence at high energies (5$-$8 keV) allows us, for the first time, to determine the pulsar geometry in Vela X-1. The fit with the rotating vector model gives an estimate for the pulsar spin position angle at around 127$^{\circ}$ and for the magnetic obliquity of 13$^{\circ}$. In order to explain the 90$^{\circ}$ swing in PA between high and low energies, we discuss two possible scenarios: a two-component spectral model and the vacuum resonance.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the effect of Spontaneous Lorentz Symmetry Breaking (SLSB) on Primordial Gravitational Waves (PGWs) generated during inflation. The SLSB is induced by a time-like Bumblebee vector field which is non-minimally coupled to the Ricci tensor in the Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) background. The power spectrum and GW amplitude are computed to investigate how Lorentz violation leaves observable imprints. Our analysis contrasts the Lorentz-violating Bumblebee cosmology with standard cosmology in the context of primordial GW generation. We calculate the GW strain amplitude over frequencies $(10^{-10}~\mathrm{Hz}, 10^4~\mathrm{Hz})$, for a range of the dimensionless Lorentz-violating parameter, $ -10^{-3} \leq l \leq 10^{-4} $, which essentially comes from a slight sensitivity to the equation of state for dark energy. For positive $l$ values, the amplitude of GW shows a mild suppression compared to the standard cosmological scenario ($ l = 0 $). This effect could be observable with detectors like SKA, $\mu$-Ares, and BBO. Conversely, negative $ l $ values amplify the GW amplitude, enhancing detectability by both SKA, $\mu$-Ares, and BBO, as well as by THEIA and DECIGO. Notably, the GW strain amplitude increases by an order of magnitude as $ l $ moves from $0$ to $ -10^{-3} $, improving prospects for detection in high-sensitivity detectors like THEIA and DECIGO.

 - **Abstract**
 Three methods for computing the total star formation rate of the Milky Way agree well with a reference value of $1.65\pm0.19$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. They are then used to determine the radial dependence of the star formation rate and face-on map for the Milky Way. First, the method based on a model of star formation in Hi-GAL-defined dense clumps, adjusted for an increase in the gas-to-dust ratio with Galactocentric radius, predicts $1.65\pm0.61$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. Second, the method using the 70 $\mu$m emission, commonly used in other galaxies, with a technique to assign distances to the extended emission, predicts $1.42^{+0.63}_{-0.44}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. Finally, a method based on theoretical predictions of star formation efficiency as a function of virial parameter, with masses corrected for metallicity dependence, applied to a catalog of molecular clouds also predicts a value in agreement at $1.47$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. The three methods predict the radial variation of the star formation rate, with remarkably good agreement from the CMZ out to about 20 kpc. More differences were seen in face-on maps with a resolution of 0.5 kpc made with the three approaches and in comparisons to the local (within 3 kpc) star formation rate, indicating limitations of the methods when applied to smaller scales. The 70 $\mu$m star formation rate follows very closely the surface density of molecular gas, corrected for a metallicity-dependent CO conversion factor. A molecular gas depletion time of 1 Gyr is consistent with the data, as is a molecular Kennicutt-Schmidt relation with a power-law slope of $1.10 \pm 0.06$.

 - **Abstract**
 White dwarf-main sequence (WDMS) binary systems are essential probes for understanding binary stellar evolution and play a pivotal role in constraining theoretical models of various transient phenomena. In this study, we construct a catalog of WDMS binaries using Gaia DR3's low-resolution BP/RP (XP) spectra. Our approach integrates a model-independent neural network for spectral modelling with Gaussian Process Classification to accurately identify WDMS binaries among over 10 million stars within 1 kpc. This study identify approximately 30,000 WDMS binary candidates, including ~1,700 high-confidence systems confirmed through spectral fitting. Our technique is shown to be effective at detecting systems where the main-sequence star dominates the spectrum - cases that have historically challenged conventional methods. Validation using GALEX photometry reinforces the reliability of our classifications: 70\% of candidates with an absolute magnitude $M_{G} > 7$ exhibit UV excess, a characteristic signature of white dwarf companions. Our all-sky catalog of WDMS binaries expands the available dataset for studying binary evolution and white dwarf physics and sheds light on the formation of WDMS.

 - **Abstract**
 We compare current 1D and multi-dimensional atmosphere modelling approaches for massive stars to understand their strengths and shortcomings. We calculate averaged stratifications from selected 2D calculations for O stars -- corresponding to the spectral types O8, O4, and O2 -- to approximate them with 1D stellar atmosphere models using the PoWR model atmosphere code and assuming a fixed $\beta-$law for the wind regime. We then study the effects of our approximations and assumptions on current spectral diagnostics. In particular, we focus on the impact of an additional turbulent pressure in the subsonic layers of the 1D models. To match the 2D averages, the 1D stellar atmosphere models need to account for turbulent pressure in the hydrostatic equation. Moreover, an adjustment of the connection point between the (quasi-)hydrostatic regime and the wind regime is required. The improvement between the density stratification of 1D model and 2D average can be further increased if the mass-loss rate of the 1D model is not identical to those of the 2D simulation, but typically $\sim0.2\,$dex higher. Especially for the early type star, this implies a significantly more extended envelope with a lower effective temperature. Already the inclusion of a constant turbulence term in the solution of the hydrostatic equation sufficiently reproduces the 2D-averaged model density stratifications. The addition of a significant turbulent motion also smoothens the slope of the radiative acceleration term in the (quasi-)hydrostatic domain, with several potential implications on the total mass-loss rate inferred from 1D modelling. Concerning the spectral synthesis, the addition of a turbulence term in the hydrostatic equation mimics the effect of a lower surface gravity, potentially presenting a solution to the ``mass discrepancy problem'' between the evolutionary and spectroscopy mass determinations.

 - **Abstract**
 The interaction of TeV blazars emitted gamma-rays with the extragalactic background photons gives rise to a relativistic beam of electron-positron ($e^- e^+$) pairs propagating through the intergalactic medium, producing a cascade through up-scattering low-energy photons. Plasma instability is considered one of the underlying energy-loss processes of the beams. We employ particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations to study the plasma instabilities of ultra-relativistic pair beams propagating in a denser background plasma, using the parameters designed to replicate astrophysical jets under laboratory conditions. In an astrophysical scenario with a broad, dilute beam, electromagnetic instability can be disregarded because its growth rate is slower than that of electrostatic instability, indicating the electromagnetic modes are suppressed. We calculate the physical limit of density contrast at which a warm beam achieves suppression of electromagnetic instabilities in laboratory experiments, consistent with the physically relevant conditions for Blazar-induced beams. We have used a composite Cauchy distribution for the beam particles, which is more realistic in representing the non-Maxwellian nature of pair beams, improving upon previous studies. We investigate the interplay between the magnetic field forming from localized currents and transverse beam momentum spread. We extrapolate to the non-linear feedback of instability where the beam is energetically broadened. We observe that the instability generates a negligible angular broadening for Blazar-Induced beams.

 - **Abstract**
 Studying accretion-driven episodic outbursts in YSOs is key to understanding the later stages of star and planet formation. FU Orionis-type objects form a YSO subclass, distinguished by rapid, multi-magnitude increases in brightness at optical and near-infrared wavelengths. These outbursts may significantly impact the chemistry and molecular composition around eruptive stars. However, no comprehensive millimeter-wavelength line survey exists for more evolved (Class II) sources, unlike optical and near-infrared coverage. We conducted the first wideband millimeter spectral line survey of V1057 Cyg, a low-mass eruptive FUor with the highest observed peak accretion rate in its class. Using the IRAM 30-m telescope, we surveyed the 72-263 GHz range and complemented this with targeted spectra at 219, 227, 291, and 344 GHz with the APEX 12-m telescope. We conducted radiative transfer and population diagram analyses to get first estimates of the excitation temperatures and column densities. Several molecular species trace large-scale structures, and the position-velocity diagram of $^{12}$CO suggest episodic outburst activity, with outflow dynamical timescales on the order of tens of thousands of years. We identified simple molecules (C-, N-, O-, and S-bearing), deuterated species, molecular ions, and complex organic molecules. With over 30 molecular species (including isotopologues) detected, V1057 Cyg demonstrates rich chemistry for its evolutionary state, compared to other younger (Class 0/I) FUors. V1057 Cyg is a good candidate for future interferometric studies to resolve emission structures, to possibly constrain molecular freeze-out, and detect water and complex organic molecules. Our results highlight the importance of millimeter line surveys in complementing optical/near-infrared studies, improving statistics on molecular inventories in eruptive stars and their environments.

 - **Abstract**
 To reveal the origin of the mini-starbursts in the Milky Way, we carried out large-scale CO observations toward the RCW 106 giant molecular cloud (GMC) complex using the NANTEN2 4-m radio telescope operated by Nagoya University. We also analyzed the Mopra Southern Galactic plane CO survey and Herschel infrared continuum archival data. The RCW 106 GMC complex contains the radial velocity components of $-68$ km s$^{-1}$ and $-50$ km s$^{-1}$ reported by Nguyen et al. (2015). Focusing on the RCW 106 East and West region with the massive star formation having the bright infrared dust emission, we found that these regions have three different velocity components with $\sim 10$ km s$^{-1}$ differences. The two out of three velocity components show morphological correspondence with the infrared cold dust emission and connect with the bridge feature on a position-velocity diagram. Therefore, two molecular clouds (MCs) with $\sim 10$ km s$^{-1}$ differences are likely to be physically associated with massive star-forming regions in the GMC complex. Based on these observational results, we argue that mini-starbursts and massive star/cluster formation in the RCW 106 GMC complex are induced by supersonic cloud-cloud collisions in an agglomerate of molecular gas on the Scutum-Centurus arm.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the X-ray reverberation in active galactic nuclei (AGN) using the variational autoencoder (VAE), which is a machine-learning algorithm widely used for signal processing and feature reconstruction. While the X-ray reverberation signatures that contain the information of the accretion disk and the X-ray emitting corona are commonly analyzed in the Fourier domain, this work aims to extract the reverberation response functions directly from the AGN light curves. The VAE is trained using the simulated light curves that contain the primary X-rays from the lamp-post corona varying its height and the corresponding reflection X-rays from the disk. We use progressively more realistic light-curve models, such as those that include the effects of disk-propagating fluctuations and random noises, to assess the ability of the VAE to reconstruct the response profiles. Interestingly, the VAE can recognize the reverberation patterns on the light curves, hence the coronal height can be predicted. We then deploy the VAE model to the XMM-Newton data of IRAS 13224-3809 and directly estimate, for the first time, the response functions of this source in various observations. The result reveals the corona changing its height between $3~r_{\rm g}$ and $20~r_{\rm g}$, which is correlated with the source luminosity and in line with previous literature. Finally, we discuss the advantages and limitations of this method.

 - **Abstract**
 Space weather, driven by solar flares and Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs), poses significant risks to technological systems. Accurately forecasting these events and their impact on Earth's magnetosphere remains a challenge because of the complexity of solar-terrestrial interactions. This study applied artificial intelligence (AI) to predict the chain of events associated with the May $2024$ superstorm, including solar flares from NOAA active region 13644, Earth-directed CMEs, and a violent geomagnetic storm. Using magnetogram cut-outs, a Vision Transformer was able to classify the evolution of the active region morphologies, and a video-based deep learning method predicted the occurrence of solar flares; a physics-driven model improved the precision of CME travel-time prediction using coronal observations and solar wind measurements; and a data-driven method exploited these in situ measurements to sound alerts of the geomagnetic storm unrolled over time. The results showed unprecedented accuracy in predicting CME arrival with uncertainty as small as one minute. Moreover, these AI models outperformed traditional methods in predicting solar flares occurrences, onset, and recovery phases of the geomagnetic storm. These findings highlight the impressive potential of AI for space weather forecasting and as a tool to mitigate the impact of extreme solar events on critical infrastructure.
