 - **Abstract**
 Due to their different nucleosynthetic origin, a stellar population produces oxygen (O) and iron (Fe) on different timescales and their relative abundance can deviate strongly from solar. Galaxy formation models should treat these elements separately, as they play a distinct role in shaping physical phenomena. For example, oxygen mainly sets the gas cooling rate, while the iron abundance sets stellar atmosphere opacities impacting stellar evolution, spectra and feedback. Observations of star-forming galaxies usually only constrain gas-phase oxygen abundance, vastly limiting our capabilities of separating the cosmic evolution of oxygen and iron. Here, we present an observationally-motivated framework to scale the cosmic evolution of O and Fe abundances. We apply the relation between the alpha-enhancement and galaxies' specific star formation rate ([O/Fe]-sSFR; Chruslinska et al. 2024) to derive the Fe and O-dependent cosmic star formation history (cSFH). We find that star formation with near-solar O/Fe is rare: at least 70% of the integrated cosmic stellar mass forms at non-solar O/Fe. The cosmic average metallicity is generally lower in [Fe/H] than in [O/H] (by up to a factor 3), with the offset increasing from redshifts z=0 to z~3 and then approaching the core-collapse O/Fe ratio. We validate our results against samples that probe the Fe-dependent cSFH in different regimes such as absorption-derived <[Fe/H]> from long gamma-ray bursts. Our results impact the interpretations of stellar and galaxy spectra and the predicted rates of transients, especially those linked to metal-poor progenitors (e.g., black hole mergers).

 - **Abstract**
 Fossil groups (FGs) are groups or clusters of galaxies with a single, massive, central galaxy and with a clear lack of L* galaxies. The physical reason for their large magnitude gap (dm12) may arise from early FG formation, which allowed all L galaxies to merge with the central one, and/or it could be related to the fact that galaxies accreting on the FGs move on radial orbits, shortening their merging timescales. The latter properties could be linked with the peculiar position of FGs within the cosmic web. We determine the velocity anisotropy profile beta(r) of the fossil cluster A267, which is related to the orbital distribution of cluster galaxies. This is the first individual FG for which the orbital distribution of galaxies is determined. We aim to confirm previous findings based on stack samples that indicate that FGs, on average, host galaxies on more radial orbits than normal clusters. We started with a sample of 2315 redshifts in the field of A267 and we determined the membership for 329 of them. Of these, 174 are located within r200. We used them as tracers of the gravitational potential of the cluster to solve the Jeans equation using the MAMPOSSt algorithm. We thus obtained the cluster mass M(r) and beta(r) profiles. We also estimated M(r) from the X-ray data. A comparison of the MAMPOSSt and X-ray-determined M(r)s allows us to estimate the cluster hydrostatic mass bias, that is consistent with previous findings. The anisotropy parameter beta(r) indicates tangential orbits for the galaxies near the cluster centre and increasingly radial orbits in the external regions. We therefore confirm that FGs are characterised by more radial orbits for their member galaxies than the average cluster population. We speculate that this different orbital distribution might be an important element in creating a large dm12.

 - **Abstract**
 We develop a flexible one-dimensional code to model the escape of hydrogen and helium from a hot Jupiter as a result of photoionization from extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) radiation. We include stellar spectrum heating and ionization, radiative cooling by Lyman-$\alpha$ and H$_3^+$, heat conduction, tidal gravity, a H-He reaction network, and account for the secondary ionization of species by photoelectrons. For a fiducial hot Jupiter, we uncover a three-layer structure: an H$_3^+$-cooled layer of molecular hydrogen at the base, enveloped by a Lyman-$\alpha$-cooled layer of neutral hydrogen, which transitions into an ionized wind layer that is cooled by adiabatic expansion. The highest spectral energy photons are deposited in the molecular layer, where, after accounting for energy loss via photoelectrons and ionization, H$_3^+$ is a substantial radiative coolant. We run a grid of models, varying the distance of our fiducial planet from the star. We find that heat conduction at the base starts to have an effect at distances $\gtrsim 0.2$ au, increasing the H$_3^+$ cooling relative to the EUV input flux. At increasing stellocentric distances, the outflow becomes increasingly more neutral. The neutral hydrogen starts to decouple from the ionized outflow, free-streaming out. In pure H-He mini-Neptune/super-Earth simulations, the outflows are significantly cooler, allowing molecules to survive throughout the outflow, pointing toward the likely importance of molecular cooling in determining whether these planets can maintain massive atmospheres. The analysis in this paper provides a framework for understanding the impact of molecular radiative cooling on atmospheric outflows.

 - **Abstract**
 The classification of radio galaxies is central to understanding galaxy evolution, active galactic nuclei dynamics, and the large-scale structure of the universe. However, traditional manual techniques are inadequate for processing the massive, heterogeneous datasets generated by modern radio surveys. In this study, we present a probabilistic machine learning framework that integrates Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for feature extraction with Bayesian ensemble learning to achieve robust, scalable radio galaxy classification. The SVD approach effectively reduces dimensionality while preserving key morphological structures, enabling efficient representation of galaxy features. To mitigate class imbalance and avoid the introduction of artefacts, we incorporate a Local Neighbourhood Encoding strategy tailored to the astrophysical distribution of galaxy types. The resulting features are used to train and optimize several baseline classifiers: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, LightGBM, and Multi-Layer Perceptrons within bagging, boosting, and stacking ensembles governed by a Bayesian weighting scheme. Our results demonstrate that Bayesian ensembles outperform their traditional counterparts across all metrics, with the Bayesian stacking model achieving a classification accuracy of 99.0% and an F1-score of 0.99 across Compact, Bent, Fanaroff-Riley Type I (FR-I), and Type II (FR-II) sources. Interpretability is enhanced through SHAP analysis, which highlights the principal components most associated with morphological distinctions. Beyond improving classification performance, our framework facilitates uncertainty quantification, paving the way for more reliable integration into next-generation survey pipelines. This work contributes a reproducible and interpretable methodology for automated galaxy classification in the era of data-intensive radio astronomy.

 - **Abstract**
 To explain the properties of the local galaxy population, theoretical models require active galactic nuclei (AGN) to inject energy into host galaxies, thereby expelling outflows of gas that would otherwise form stars. Observational tests of this scenario rely on determining outflow masses, which requires measuring the electron density ($n_e$) of ionised gas. However, recent studies have argued that the most commonly used diagnostic may underestimate electron densities (and hence overestimate outflow masses) by several orders of magnitude, casting doubt as to whether ionised AGN-driven outflows can provide the impact needed to reconcile observations with theory. Here, we investigate this by applying two different electron-density diagnostics to Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectroscopy of the Quasar Feedback (QSOFEED) sample of 48 nearby type-2 quasars. Accounting for uncertainties, we find that outflow masses implied by the transauroral-line electron-density diagnostic are significantly lower than those produced by the commonly-used `strong-line' [S II](6717/6731) method, indicating a different origin of these emission lines and suggesting that these doubts are justified. Nevertheless, we show that it is possible to modify the [S II](6717/6731) electron-density diagnostic for our sample by applying a correction of $\mathrm{log}_{10}(n_{e\mathrm{,\, outflow}}\mathrm{ [cm}^{-3}\mathrm{]}) = \mathrm{log}_{10}(n_{e\mathrm{,[S\,II]}}\mathrm{ [cm}^{-3}\mathrm{]}) + 0.75(\pm0.07)$ to account for this, which results in values that are statistically consistent with those produced using the transauroral-line method. The techniques that we present here will be crucial for outflow studies in the upcoming era of large spectroscopic surveys, which will also be able to verify our results and broaden this method to larger samples of AGN of different types.

 - **Abstract**
 The existence of dark matter (DM) is supported by various macroscopic observations, but its microscopic nature remains elusive. The Galactic Center GeV gamma-ray excess (GCE) has been a leading candidate signal for particle dark matter annihilation. However, an unresolved population of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) in the bulge provides the alternative explanation for the excess. Identifying these MSPs in electromagnetic bands is difficult due to source confusion, pulse broadening, and extinction. Gravitational waves (GWs) provide a complementary probe: a steadily rotating, non-axisymmetric MSP emits a nearly monochromatic GW signal in the sensitive band of ground-based detectors, with amplitude set by its ellipticity. In this work, we systematically investigate the GW emission from the MSP population proposed to explain the GCE and its detectability with current and future detectors. We consider three major scenarios for the origin of ellipticity and model the population properties of these MSPs. We also consider both isolated MSPs and MSPs in binary systems, as well as Doppler effects in the detection. We find that while the signal is below the reach of current interferometers, next-generation detectors such as the Einstein Telescope (ET) and Cosmic Explorer (CE) can detect a fraction of those MSPs, offering a novel test of the MSP interpretation of the GCE. Future directed searches toward the Galactic Center with continued improvements in sensitivities will either uncover this long-sought MSP population or place stringent limits on their ellipticities and abundance, with important implications for both the astrophysical and dark-matter interpretations of the GCE.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the deepest HI mass Function (HIMF) ever measured, outside the Local Group. The observations are part of the MeerKAT Fornax Survey and cover a 4 x 4 deg^2 field, corresponding to ~ Rvir. The 3$\sigma$ detection limit is log(MHI/Msun) = 5.7 for a 50 km/s-wide point source. We detect HI in 35 galaxies and 44 clouds with no optical counterparts. Using deep optical images from the Fornax Deep Survey, we show that the clouds are a distinct population, separated by a four magnitude gap from the faintest HI-detected galaxies. The majority (33 out of 44) of the clouds are associated with the two galaxies with the most HI in the cluster -- NGC 1365 and NGC 1427A, although the clouds contribute a negligible amount to the total MHI budget. By performing a SNR analysis and computing the Rauzy statistic on the HI detections, we demonstrate that our catalogue is complete down log(MHI/Msun) = 6, and we are therefore able to probe the HIMF down to this level. We find an abrupt drop of the number density of HI-detected galaxies at log(MHI/Msun) = 7, signifying a clear absence of galaxies between 6 < log(MHI/Msun) < 7. We use the modified maximum likelihood method to fit a Schechter function down to log(MHI/Msun) > 7, the range where the HIMF follows a power-law. The measured low-mass slope is $\alpha$ = -1.31 $\pm$ 0.13, with a characteristic knee mass of log(M*/Msun) = 10.52 $\pm$ 1.89. The low-mass slope matches the slope in the field, while the knee is defined by a single galaxy and is unconstrained. Below log(MHI/Msun) = 7, there is a sharp departure from a Schechter function, and we report the first robust measurement of the collapse of a HIMF. For the HIMF below log(MHI/Msun) = 7 to follow a power-law, tens of galaxies are needed -- a factor ~ six higher than what is observed. The collapse of the Fornax HIMF is likely due to the rapid removal of HI from low-mass galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 We present observational constraints on large-scale white noise (LSWN) in the cosmic density field, a phenomenon predicted to arise from non-linear mode coupling during cosmological evolution. Building on the theoretical framework of Paper I, where we demonstrated that non-linearities inevitably redistribute power from small to large scales through mode mixing, we confront these predictions with current cosmological data. We modify the CLASS Boltzmann code to incorporate a white noise component $k_\mathrm{BH}/k$ in the primordial power spectrum and perform parameter estimation using current cosmological data. The non-detection of excess power on the largest observable scales places stringent upper bounds: $k_\mathrm{BH} \leq 1.80 \times 10^{-13}~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ at 99\% confidence. These constraints imply the primordial power spectrum must deviate from perfect scale invariance on small scales, either through a cutoff at $k_{\mathrm{cut}} \lesssim 3~\mathrm{pc}^{-1}$ or through running of the spectral index with $\alpha_s \lesssim -0.015$. Our results demonstrate that LSWN provides a powerful probe of the primordial spectrum at scales orders of magnitude smaller than directly observable, offering unique constraints on early-universe physics.
#### The abundance and properties of the lowest luminosity dwarf galaxies around the Milky Way: Insights from Semi-Analytic Models

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the formation and observable properties of faint satellite galaxies (M$_\rm V > -3$) in Milky Way-like halos using the semi-analytic galaxy formation model Galacticus. The ability of the smallest dark matter halos to form stars depends sensitively on the balance between gas cooling and reionization heating. To quantify how this balance shapes the abundance and properties of the faintest galaxies, we compare two model variants: a fiducial model that includes molecular hydrogen (H$_2$) cooling and UV background radiation, and a No-H$_2$ model with atomic cooling only. Both models reproduce the structural properties of brighter Milky Way satellites, but they diverge at the lowest luminosities in the hyper-faint regime. The fiducial model predicts a substantially larger population of such systems that are on average hosted in halos with lower peak masses and quenched earlier. Many of these predicted systems lie below current observational thresholds but are within reach of next-generation deep imaging surveys. The predicted size-luminosity distributions of both models overlap with the region occupied by recently discovered "ambiguous" systems, whose classification as galaxies or star clusters remains uncertain. Specifically, we find that hyper-faint satellites have line-of-sight velocity dispersions of $\sigma_{\rm los} \sim 1-3$ km/s in the fiducial model, nearly an order of magnitude higher than expected for purely self-gravitating stellar systems of the same stellar mass. This distinction underscores the diagnostic power of precise kinematic measurements for determining whether ambiguous objects are dark matter dominated dwarf galaxies or star clusters, and highlights the importance of upcoming spectroscopic campaigns in resolving the nature of the faintest satellites.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the results of the optical follow-up of a sample of $\gamma$-ray-emitting active galactic nuclei (AGN). New high-quality optical spectra were obtained using Gran Telescopio Canarias with Optical System for Imaging and low- Intermediate-Resolution Integrated Spectroscopy and the European Southern Observatory Very Large Telescope Unit Telescope 1 with the FOcal Reducer and low dispersion Spectrograph 2. From the analysis of these spectra, we confirmed the previous classification as narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) for four objects and discovered two new NLS1s, bringing the total number of optically confirmed $\gamma$-NLS1s to 26. We also identified two ambiguous cases between NLS1 and intermediate Seyfert (IS), three IS, one broad-line Seyfert 1, one Seyfert 2. Based on the new spectra, we calculated black hole masses ranging from $10^{6.25}$ to $10^{9.32}$ $M_\odot$, and Eddington ratios spanning 0.05 to 2.07. This reclassification reinforces the scenario in which AGN with relatively small black hole masses are capable of launching powerful relativistic jets, contributing to our broader understanding of $\gamma$-ray-emitting AGN.
#### CLASSY XIII. Cutting through the Clouds - Comparing Indirect Tracers of Ionizing Photon Escape

 - **Abstract**
 The Epoch of Reionization (EoR) provides critical insights into the role of early galaxies in shaping the ionization state of the universe. However, because of the opacity of the intergalactic medium, it is often not possible to make direct measurements of the ionizing photon escape fraction ($f_{\mathrm{esc}}^{\: \mathrm{LyC}}$) of high-redshift ($z \gtrsim 4$) galaxies. To explore the agreement and systematics of common indirect approaches, we applied six empirically calibrated diagnostics to predict $f_{\mathrm{esc}}^{\: \mathrm{LyC}}$ for the 45 nearby star-forming galaxies from the COS Legacy Spectroscopic SurveY (CLASSY). These methods- based on ultraviolet (UV) absorption lines, the UV continuum slope, Ly$\alpha$ kinematics, a multivariate model, radiation-hydrodynamic simulations, and nebular emission line ratios- enable us to explore systematic differences between predictions and assess how galactic properties influence inferred LyC escape. Despite significant variations in method predictions, there is broad consistency in the resulting weak and strong LyC leaker classifications, with approximately half exhibiting predicted escape fractions $>$1%. We find evidence for two different pathways of LyC escape in nearby star-forming galaxies: (1) an early escape model driven by very young stellar populations, and (2) a delayed escape model that is consistent with supernova-driven outflows and time-dependent ISM clearing. The early escape model is favored among galaxies with a single, intense burst of recent star formation. In contrast, the delayed escape model is common among galaxies with more extended starburst histories. To interpret ionizing photon escape during the EoR, it will be necessary to recognize and understand this diversity in LyC escape mechanisms.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic field is the key physical quantity in solar physics as it controls all kinds of solar activity, ranging from nanoflares to big flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). However, so far only the magnetic field on the solar surface can be more or less precisely measured, and the most important coronal magnetic field remains undetectable accurately. Without the knowledge of the coronal magnetic field, it is even more difficult to obtain secondary quantities related to magnetic field, such as the magnetic helicity and magnetic configuration, including the curvature of field lines. The prevailing approaches to obtain the coronal magnetic field include coronal magnetic extrapolation and coronal seismology. Actually there were scattered efforts to derive secondary magnetic quantities based on imaging observations of solar filaments, without the help of polarization measurements. We call this approach solar filament physiognomy. In this paper, we review these efforts made in the past decades, and point out that this approach will be promising as large telescopes are being built and more fine structures of filament channels will be revealed.
#### JWST observations of cosmic-ray-excited H$_2$ in Barnard 68: spatial variations and constraints on cosmic-ray attenuation

 - **Abstract**
 We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRSpec observations of the starless dark cloud Barnard 68 that reveal the spatially-resolved signature of cosmic-ray excited molecular hydrogen (CRXH$_2$) emissions for the first time. Following up on our initial detection of CRXH$_2$ emissions from B68 (Bialy et al. 2025), we now exploit JWST's sensitivity and spatial multiplexing to map CRXH$_2$ rovibrational lines across 16 sight lines through the cloud. By disentangling the CRXH$_2$ and UV-pumped H$_2$ components, we isolate the para-H$_2$-dominated spectrum attributable to cosmic-ray excitation. We find that there are significant spatial variations in the ratio of the CRXH$_2$ line intensity to the line-of-sight H$_2$ column density; these cannot be accounted for by dust extinction alone and demonstrate a clear attenuation of the cosmic-ray flux with increasing shielding column. Modeling B68 as a Bonnor-Ebert sphere, we constrain both the unshielded cosmic-ray ionization rate, $\zeta_{\rm H_2}$, and how it decreases with shielding column. At a reference depth of $N({\rm H}_2) = 3 \times 10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$, we infer $\zeta_{\rm H_2} \approx 1.4 \times 10^{-16}$ s$^{-1}$, a factor of $\approx 3$ higher than the average value derived from H$_3^+$ absorption studies. These results provide the most direct probe to date of cosmic-ray penetration into cold, dense gas, offering new constraints on both the microphysics of CR-H$_2$ interactions and the attenuation of low-energy cosmic rays in molecular clouds. Our findings establish CRXH$_2$ emission as a powerful new diagnostic of the cosmic-ray environment in interstellar space.
#### The PAU Survey: The $i$-band galaxy luminosity function from the present-day to $z = 2$

 - **Abstract**
 We present a measurement of the $i$-band galaxy luminosity function from the present-day to $z = 2$, using over 1.1 million galaxies from the Physics of the Accelerating Universe Survey (PAUS). PAUS combines broad-band imaging from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey with narrow-band photometry from PAUCam, enabling high-precision photometric redshifts with an accuracy of $\sigma_{68} (\Delta z) = 0.019$ down to $i_{\textrm{AB}} = 23$. A synthetic lightcone mock catalogue built using the \texttt{GALFORM} semi-analytic model is used to simulate PAUS selection effects and photometric uncertainties, and to derive a machine-learning based estimate of the $k$-correction. We recover rest-frame $i$-band luminosities using a random forest regressor trained on simulated $ugriz$ photometry and redshifts. Luminosity functions are estimated using the $1/V_{\textrm{max}}$ method, accounting for photometric redshift and magnitude errors, and validated against mock data. We find good agreement between observations and models at $z < 1$, with increasing discrepancies at higher redshifts due to photometric redshift outliers. The bright-end of the luminosity function becomes flatter at high redshift, primarily driven by redshift errors. We show that the faint-end of the luminosity function becomes more incomplete with increasing redshift, but is still useful for constraining models. We analyze the red and blue galaxy populations separately, observing distinct evolutionary trends. The model overpredicts the number of both faint red and blue galaxies. Our study highlights the importance of accurate redshift estimation and selection modeling for robust luminosity function recovery, and demonstrates that PAUS can characterise the galaxy population with photometric redshifts across a wide redshift baseline.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational scattering of small bodies (planetesimals) by a planet remains a fundamental problem in celestial mechanics. It is traditionally modeled within the circular restricted three-body problem (CR3BP), where individual particle trajectories are obtained via numerical integrations. Here, we introduce a patched-conic framework to describe the random walk of the orbital energy $x$ for an ensemble of test particles on planet-crossing orbits. We show that the evolution of each particle's orbital elements $(a, e, i)$ is fully encapsulated by the 3D rotation of the relative velocity vector $\mathbf{U}_\infty$, whose magnitude remains constant. Consequently, the system can be reduced to two degrees of freedom. By averaging over all possible flyby geometries, we derive explicit expressions for the drift and diffusion coefficients of $x$. We then solve the resulting Fokker--Planck equation to obtain a closed-form solution for the time evolution of the particle distribution. A characteristic scattering timescale naturally emerges, scaling as $(P_{p}/M_{p}^{2})/500$, where $P_{p}$ is the planet's orbital period and $M_{p}$ its mass ratio to the central star. The typical ejection speed of small bodies by a planet is estimated to be $3 v_p M_{p}^{1/3}$, where $v_p$ is the planet's orbital speed. Our analytical solution constitutes a universal law applicable to both the Solar System and exoplanetary systems, providing a computationally efficient alternative to costly $N$-body simulations for studying the orbital distributions and ejection of planetesimals and planets (e.g., Kuiper Belt, Oort Cloud, debris disks, interstellar objects, and free-floating planets).

 Bar structures are present in about half of local disk galaxies and play pivotal roles in secular galaxy evolution. Bars impose a non-axisymmetric perturbation to the rotating disk and transport gas inward to feed central starburst and, possibly, the activity of the nuclear supermassive black hole. They are believed to be long-lived structures and are now identified at redshift $z>2$. Yet, little is known about the onset and effect of bars in the early cosmic epoch because spectroscopy of distant bars at sufficient resolution is prohibitively expensive. Here, we report a kinematic study of a galactic bar at redshift 2.467, 2.6 billion years after the Big Bang. We observe the carbon monoxide and atomic carbon emission lines of the dusty star-forming galaxy J0107a and find the bar of J0107a has gas distribution and motion in a pattern identical to local bars. At the same time, the bar drives large-scale non-circular motions that dominate over disk rotation, funneling molecular gas into its center at a rate of $\approx600$ solar masses per year. Our results show that bar-driven dynamical processes and secular evolution were already at play 11.1 billion years ago, powering active star formation amid the gas-rich and far-infrared luminous growth phase in a massive disk galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 Several local ($z\lesssim 0.2$) metal-poor dwarf AGNs have remarkably similar properties to those of high-redshift Little Red Dots (LRDs), and are recently proposed to be local analogs of LRDs. We use long-term photometric and spectroscopic observations of three local LRDs spanning $\sim 20$ years to measure variability in their rest-frame optical continuum and broad H$\alpha$ emission lines. Using ZTF light curves over a rest-frame $\sim 5$ yr baseline, the $r$-band intrinsic rms variability is $(9\times 10^{-5})_{\rm -9E-5}^{+0.014}$ mag (J1022), $0.025\pm0.004$ mag (J1025) and $0.020\pm0.005$ mag (J1047), indicating low intrinsic variability ($<3-4\%$ at 3$\sigma$). These rms variability amplitudes are much lower than those for dwarf AGNs and more massive quasars. There is little structure in the optical variability structure functions for the three local LRDs, in contrast to normal AGN variability. Using available multi-epoch spectra, we constrain the broad H$\alpha$ line flux variability to be less than a few percent, without significant profile changes, over a rest-frame baseline of $\sim 15$ yrs in J1025 and J1047, respectively. The three LRDs stand out in the Balmer line properties compared with normal broad-line AGNs, with exceptionally large H$\alpha$ equivalent widths and H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ ratios far exceeding the Case B recombination value. In the context of recent theoretical models of LRDs as dense gas-enshrouded massive black holes with super-Eddington accretion, our results suggest that the photosphere emission is long-term stable and the broad Balmer lines are primarily collisonally excited. This scenario is consistent with the lack of variability, large H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ ratios and little dust extinction, as well as the expected high gas density. Virial black hole mass estimates using broad H$\alpha$ assuming photoionization are therefore highly questionable for LRDs.

 - **Abstract**
 We forecast the constraint on the Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ model from the photometric survey operated by the Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST). The simulated $3\times2$pt data of galaxy clustering, weak lensing, and galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements within 100 deg$^{2}$ are used in the analysis. The mock observational maps are constructed from a light cone, redshift sampling and noise. The angular power spectra are measured with pseudo-$C_\ell$ estimators and compared to theory in the same basis using validated weighting functions and an analytic covariance matrix that includes Gaussian, connected non-Gaussian, and super-sample terms. We model the theoretical spectra using two methods. The first one uses MGCAMB to compute the linear modified-gravity clustering power spectra, and the second one adopts the FREmu emulator with a baseline of nonlinear $\Lambda$CDM prescription. Parameter inference is performed with Cobaya, and the cosmological and modified-gravity parameters are sampled within the emulator training domain, which is jointly fitted with the systematic parameters. We find that the predictions from the two methods are in good agreement at the overlapping large scales, and the emulator method can correctly provide additional high-$\ell$ information. The $1\sigma$ upper bounds of $\log_{10}|f_{R0}|$ are found to be $<-5.42$ for cosmic shear only case and $<-5.29$ for the 100 deg$^2$ CSST $3\times2$pt probe. The full CSST photometric survey with 17,500 deg$^2$ survey area is expected to further improve the constraint precision by about one order of magnitude. Our results demonstrate that the CSST $3\times2$pt survey can deliver strict tests on $f(R)$ gravity.

 - **Abstract**
 JWST/NIRCam observations reveal dense stellar cores in high-redshift galactic bulges, indicative of sustained star formation and potential stellar accretion. We introduce accretion-modified star (AMS) as a new component in the chemical evolution of high-redshift bulges hosting active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The gas-phase chemical evolution of bulge environments containing AMS is modeled within 1 Gyr by combining population evolution and galactic chemical evolution formalisms, and observational signatures are tracked via photoionization modeling on Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) diagrams. Sustained high accretion onto AMSs leads to rapid gas-phase metal enrichment of the bulge, producing abundance peaks up to five times solar metallicity within 0.1 Gyr and significantly modifying elemental ratios in the gas phase. Atypical gas-phase abundance patterns during early, high-accretion phases and gradually diminish as the accretion rate declines. In BPT diagrams, high-AMS-accretion scenarios shift the modeled emission-line sequence toward the local AGN branch and extend into the high-metallicity regime. Super-solar narrow-line regions observed in AGNs at z>15 may reflect such AMS-driven gas-phase enrichment of host bulge under extreme gas densities. While direct detection of AMSs within AGN bulges remains challenging, the model provides testable predictions for future spectroscopic surveys and motivates further exploration of non-canonical stellar populations in AGN host bulges.

 - **Abstract**
 Spectroscopic characterization of rocky exoplanets with the James Webb Space Telescope has brought the origin and evolution of their atmospheres into the focus of exoplanet science. Time-evolved models of the feedback between interior and atmosphere are critical to predict and interpret these observations and link them to the Solar System terrestrial planets. However, models differ in methodologies and input data, which can lead to significant differences in interpretation. In this paper, we present the experimental protocol of the Coupled atmospHere Interior modeL Intercomparison (CHILI) project. CHILI is an (exo-)planet model intercomparison project within the Climates Using Interactive Suites of Intercomparisons Nested for Exoplanet Studies (CUISINES) framework, which aims to support a diverse set of multi-model intercomparison projects in the exoplanet community. The present protocol includes the initial set of participating magma ocean models, divided into evolutionary and static models, and two types of test categories, one focused on Solar System planets (Earth & Venus) and the other on exoplanets orbiting low-mass M-dwarfs. Both test categories aim to quantify the evolution of key markers of the links between planetary atmospheres and interiors over geological timescales. The proposed tests would allow us to quantify and compare the differences between coupled atmosphere-interior models used by the exoplanet and planetary science communities. Results from the proposed tests will be published in dedicated follow-up papers. To encourage the community to join this comparison effort and as an example, we present initial test results for the early Earth and TRAPPIST-1 b, conducted with models differing in the treatment of energy transport in the planetary interior and atmosphere, surface boundary layer, geochemistry, and the in- and outgassing of volatile compounds.

 - **Abstract**
 We present one of the first measurements of the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) in multiple massive protoclusters at cosmic noon, using Hubble Space Telescope (HST) G141 slitless spectroscopy from the MAMMOTH-Grism survey. We identify 63 protocluster member galaxies across three overdense structures at $z = 2\text{-}3$ with robust detections of [OIII], H$\beta$, and [OII] emission. The sample spans gas-phase metallicities of $12 + \log(\text{O/H}) = 8.2\text{-}8.6$, dust-corrected H$\beta$-based star formation rates (SFRs) of $10$-$250\,M_\odot\,\text{yr}^{-1}$, and stellar masses of $M_\ast \sim 10^{9.4}$-$10^{10.5}\,M_\odot$, derived via spectral energy distribution fitting using deep HST and ground-based photometry. We stack spectra in five $M_\ast$ bins to obtain average metallicities and SFRs. Relative to field galaxies at similar redshifts, protocluster members show elevated SFRs at $M_\ast < 10^{10.25}\,M_\odot$ and a systematically shallower MZR: $12 + \log(\text{O/H}) = (6.96 \pm 0.13) + (0.143 \pm 0.017) \times \log(M_{\ast}/M_{\odot})$. We detect a mass-dependent environmental offset: massive protocluster galaxies are metal-poor compared to field counterparts of similar mass, whereas lower-mass systems exhibit comparable or mildly enhanced metallicities. This trend is consistent with a scenario where cold-mode accretion dilutes the interstellar medium (ISM) across the full mass range, while efficient recycling of feedback-driven outflows preferentially enriches the ISM in low-mass galaxies. Finally, we assess the dependence of metallicity offsets on local overdensity and find no significant trend, likely reflecting the survey's bias toward protocluster cores.

 - **Abstract**
 We present here the results from a second epoch of phase-referenced VLBA observations of 8 Seyfert and LINER galaxies from the KISSR sample. These sources were chosen based on the presence of double peaks or asymmetries in their emission lines as observed in SDSS spectra. Parsec-scale radio emission is detected in 7 of the 8 sources in the second epoch. Jet-like features appear to persist over a $\sim4-9$ year timeline in these `radio-quiet' AGN. A few sources like KISSR1494, however, show significantly different structures after a 9 year interval. KISSR102, which was previously suggested to be a binary black hole candidate based on the presence of two compact cores, shows the tentative signatures of superluminal jet motion ($1.05\pm0.45$c). Tentative superluminal motion in a jet knot has been reported in another source, KISSR872 ($1.65\pm0.57$c). We present 1.5 GHz images from the VLA A-array of 4 sources. These images reveal core-lobe or core-halo structures. The alignment of the VLBI jet direction with the kpc-scale spectral index gradient, as well as the mismatch between the star formation rate derived from the radio and H$\alpha$ line emission, support the suggestion that the kpc-scale emission is AGN-jet-related. The jets in KISSR sources appear to lose collimation over spatial scales between 200 parsec and 1 kpc. Overall, the characteristics of the KISSR jets are reminiscent of similar properties observed in VLBI monitoring studies of `radio-loud' AGN jets even as subtle differences related to the compactness and brightness of jet features remain.

 - **Abstract**
 Our previous work identified a class of SDSS quasars exhibiting multiple Gaia detections, classifying them as candidates for various astrophysical systems such as quasar-star pairs, dual quasars, and gravitationally lensed quasars. In this paper, we present a pilot VLBI study targeting a radio-bright subsample and report the first high-resolution imaging results. By leveraging the milliarcsecond-scale resolution of VLBI and its precise astrometric coordination incorporating with Gaia, we aim to refine the classification of these multiple matched sources, search for potential dual AGNs, and assess the efficacy of the combined Gaia-VLBI approach in resolving ambiguous quasar systems. We cross-matched the SQUAB quasar sample with the FIRST and NVSS catalogs, identifying 18 radio-emitting sources. The three brightest were selected for dual-frequency (1.6 and 4.9 GHz) VLBA observations. We performed VLBI imaging at both Gaia positions, constructed spectral index maps, and estimated brightness temperatures to characterize the radio morphology and physical properties. For the three target sources, our VLBI observations reveal compact radio structures consistent with single AGN at the primary Gaia positions. No significant emission is detected at the secondary Gaia locations. These results support the interpretation of the sources as quasar$-$star pairs, in line with earlier studies. This pilot study demonstrates the value of radio-VLBI high-resolution follow-ups on Gaia-selected quasar systems with multiple counterparts, showing how they can unambiguously reveal the true nature of these systems and help remove contaminants from dual AGN candidate samples.

 - **Abstract**
 Amorphous silicate dust is a major component in the interstellar and circumstellar dust formed in the outflow of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. Although iron depletion is observed in the interstellar medium (ISM), the exact form and fraction of iron in solid remains under debate. In particular, it is unclear whether amorphous silicate dust around AGB stars contains metallic iron. We aimed to provide optical constants of amorphous silicate nanoparticles and examine the effects of metallic iron on their spectral features to better constrain the dust properties by producing amorphous silicate nanoparticles with and without metallic cores. We performed condensation experiments using an induction thermal plasma system to produce dust analogues of the CI chondritic composition in the Mg-Ca-Na-Al-Si-Fe-Ni-O and Mg-Ca-Na-Al-Si-O systems. We measured the absorbance and reflectance of the samples, observed the structure of the products, and determined the optical constants. Two types of amorphous silicate nanoparticles (10-200 nm in diameter) with nearly CI chondritic composition were produced: one contained kamacite (Fe: Ni=0.9: 0.1) cores with a diameter ratio ranging 0-0.87 (average ~0.50), and the other was iron-free homogeneous amorphous silicate. The amorphous silicates of the CI chondritic composition with various sized metallic cores may be prevalent in circumstellar and interstellar dust.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel empirical method for correcting asteroid phase curves for rotational and geometrical effects using precomputed spin-and-shape models. Our approach normalizes sparse photometric data to a pole-on geometry, enabling consistent phase-curve fitting across apparitions. We fit both the H,G1,G2 and H,G12 phase functions to the normalized data. We also numerically derive new constraints on parameter ranges that ensure physically meaningful solutions. These constraints are based on the requirement that the reduced magnitude must monotonically decrease with phase angle and remain within plausible slope bounds. Compared to earlier bounds, our new constraints are more permissive. We also compare derivative-based and derivative-free optimization methods, highlighting convergence issues with the HG12 function and offering mitigation strategies. We applied our method to over 25,000 asteroids observed by the ATLAS survey, demonstrating its usability. The new method enables the selection of the preferred spin-and-shape solution based on either statistical phase-curve model selection criteria and/or physically motivated constraints on the phase-curve shape.

 - **Abstract**
 Comet 3I/ATLAS, also known as C/2025 N1, was discovered on 2025 July 1 UT by NASA Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS), with a v$_{\infty}$ $\sim$ 58 kms$^{-1}$. This is the fastest among the three interstellar objects discovered so far. In this work, we study the interaction of the 3I/ATLAS with Mars, pre-perihelion, and Jupiter post-perihelion. We also present the results of the dynamical simulations of the orbital evolution of the comet for a hundred years in the past and future. For our analysis, we have used REBOUND, an N-Body simulation package, to study these situations. We use the adaptive size mathematical integrator \textsc{Ias15}, with a 1-day time step for long-term integration, and a 1-hour time step to study the effect of the planets on this body during the close encounters. We have seen an effect of Jupiter on the orbital parameters of the comet, which affects its post-perijove trajectory significantly. The impact of Mars on this comet is minimal compared to the effect of Jupiter. This is consistent with the point that the comet moves well past Mars's Hill radius but very close to Jupiter's Hill radius at the respective close approaches. However, the effect of non-gravitational forces will alter the results. Since the non-gravitational forces are not yet known, we predict the variation of the orbital parameters considering a range of possible magnitudes of the non-gravitational acceleration.

 - **Abstract**
 Analogous to the HR diagram for stars, the thermal equilibrium curve encodes the thermodynamics of accretion disks by expressing the local balance between heating -- primarily via viscous dissipation -- and cooling -- typically through radiative transfer. These curves are commonly plotted as surface density versus effective temperature. When an S-shaped locus appears, local annuli become bistable, and limit-cycle oscillations arise when the external mass-transfer rate falls within an unstable band. This behavior underpins the disk instability model for recurring outbursts in cataclysmic variables. This paper reviews first-principles thermal equilibrium curves for accretion disks driven by magnetorotational instability (MRI), with emphasis on dwarf novae. Unlike the parameterized $\alpha$-viscosity approach, the curves are obtained by solving the governing equations with radiation magnetohydrodynamics simulations, thereby reproducing S-shaped loci without prescribing $\alpha$. The disk instability in dwarf-nova systems and the physical origin of angular-momentum transport (shear stresses) are also briefly reviewed. Notes on the stability of radiation-dominated accretion flows are included in the Appendix.

 - **Abstract**
 The galaxy size-luminosity and size-stellar mass relations are important constraints on the galactic baryon cycle of gas accretion, star formation, and feedback. There are conflicting claims in the literature regarding how environment influences size: both direct transformative effects and `assembly bias' may contribute to observed variations with environment. We construct a large homogeneous sample of size measurements to M*~10^7 Msun. Our sample fills a gap in field galaxy size measurements around 10^7-10^8 Msun; the literature at these masses is biased towards satellites of L* galaxies and members of galaxy clusters. We use sizes from the DESI-LS, together with a published catalog that contains stellar masses and cluster positions derived from DESI-LS photometry. Our sample extends to z<0.3 and comprises 540,228 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts and 9,513,732 galaxies with photometric redshifts. We explore the environmental dependence of size for a mass-limited subset of our sample at z<0.05, based on distance to the nearest cluster center. We obtain size-luminosity and size-mass relations in good agreement with previous studies. By separating galaxies according to color and morphology, we show that the environmental variation of the overall size-mass relation on Mpc scales can be understood as the consequence of a changing mixture of subpopulations, rather than direct size transformation. For example, at fixed mass, quiescent (red) late-type galaxies within 2Mpc of a cluster have the same size as quiescent late-type galaxies 30Mpc from the nearest cluster. Our results support individual galaxy assembly histories as the primary determinant of galaxy size. The existence of significantly different, environment-insensitive size mass relations for subpopulations separated by color and Sersic index provides a clear target for calibration of the baryon cycle in cosmological simulations.
#### An observationally based wind model contemporaneous with the radio detections in $τ$ Boötis

 - **Abstract**
 Recent low-frequency array (LOFAR) radio signal detections bearing from the $\tau$ Boötis system have been cautiously attributed to auroral emissions from the hot Jupiter $\tau$ Boötis Ab. The auroral emissions are believed to be excited by interaction between the exoplanet and the winds of its host star. Since stellar winds respond to stellar surface magnetism, three-dimensional stellar wind modelling, able to account for the star's contemporaneous magnetic field geometry, can aid the interpretation of radio detections. For the first time, we present spectropolarimetric observations of $\tau$ Boötis A from the same epoch as the LOFAR detections. We derive a contemporaneous large-scale magnetic map of $\tau$ Boötis A, which shows a poloidally dominated field with mean strength 1.6 G. From our magnetic map, we create a three-dimensional numerical wind model and characterise the wind properties around $\tau$ Boötis Ab. To compute the wind power dissipated in $\tau$ Boötis Ab's magnetosphere, we apply two approaches: A) the solar system-based empirical relation called Bode's law; and B) a resolved numerical model of the planetary magnetosphere. When consistently applying best-case assumptions, we redict radio flux densities around 50 mJy and 0.68 mJy respectively. Our values are much too small to be consistent with the reported observation of $890_{-500}^{+690}$ mJy; a stellar surface magnetic field scaling $\gtrsim 10$ is required to reproduce the observed signal strength. As $\tau$ Boötis A has a rapid magnetic cycle, we speculate that wind variations cased by variation in stellar magnetism may explain the lack of detections from follow-up observations. Our work emphasises the importance of contemporaneous observations of stellar magnetism and observational signatures of star-planet interaction.

 - **Abstract**
 Transit Timing Variations (TTVs) are a powerful tool for detecting unseen companions in systems with known transiting exoplanets and for characterizing their masses and orbital properties. Large-scale and homogeneous TTV analyses are a valuable method to complement the demographics of planetary systems and understand the role of dynamical interactions. We present the results of a systematic TTV analysis of 423 systems covering 16000 transits, each with a single transiting planet first discovered by the TESS mission and afterwards confirmed or validated. The primary aim of this survey is to identify the most promising candidates for dynamically active systems that warrant further investigation. In the first stage of our analysis, precise measurements of the transit times are extracted for each system in an homogeneous way. In the second stage, we apply a decision framework to classify candidates by analyzing the resulting variations. Based on excess timing scatter and the difference in Bayesian Information Criterion of periodic models over linear ones, the TTVs are classified as significant, marginal, or non-detections. We find 11 systems with significant TTVs, 5 of which were announced in previous works, and 10 more systems with marginal evidence in our sample. We present 3-panel diagnostic plots for all the candidates, showing phase-folded light curves, the transit variations over time, and the variations folded on the recovered TTV period. A comprehensive summary table detailing the fitted parameters and TTV significance for the entire survey is also provided. This survey constitutes the largest homogeneous TTV analysis of TESS systems to date. We provide the community with updated ephemerides and a catalogue of high-quality TTV candidates, enabling targeted follow-up observations and dynamical modelling to uncover the nature of unseen companions and study system architectures.

 - **Abstract**
 In recent years, imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) have emerged as promising platforms for optical interferometry through the use of intensity interferometry. IACTs combine large segmented mirrors, photodetectors with nanosecond-scale time response capable of detecting signals from just a few photo-electrons, and array configurations with baselines of hundreds of meters. As a result, all major IACT facilities have now been upgraded to function also as optical intensity interferometers, achieving sensitivities an order of magnitude better than their predecessor, the Narrabri Stellar Intensity Interferometer. However, further improvements in sensitivity are currently limited by key IACT design constraints, namely the combination of poor optical quality and small focal ratios. Here we present three practical implementations of the "I3T concept", in which segments of the IACT primary mirror are focused onto different pixels of its camera. This approach yields several unexpected but significant advantages. Optics with larger focal ratios allow to integrate narrow-band optical filters, while lower photon fluxes enable to deploy next-generation photodetectors operating in photon-counting mode. We demonstrate that this so-called "Butterfly's Eye" configuration enhances the sensitivity of IACT-based intensity interferometers by a factor between 4 and 6. Moreover, as originally envisioned, the I3T design introduces imaging capabilities on angular scales from 2 to 40 milliarcseconds, unlocking new scientific opportunities such as direct surface imaging of nearby red giants. Besides, realistic simulations show that it can have a transformative impact on at least two key science cases: imaging the earliest stages of nova ejecta, and measuring the oblateness and circumstellar disks of fast-rotating stars.

 The eclipsing binary LL Aqr is a bright V = 9.32, detached system consisting of two solar-type stars in an eccentric orbit (P = 20.2 d). The secondary component, LL Aqr B, was previously found to have physical and atmospheric parameters very similar to the Sun. Using high-precision photometry from TESS along with previously published orbital solutions, we obtain updated model-independent stellar radii and masses: $R_A = 1.3180 \pm 0.0013~R_{\odot}$, $R_B = 0.9927 \pm 0.0008~R_{\odot}$, $M_A = 1.1947 \pm 0.0009~M_{\odot}$, and $M_B = 1.0334 \pm 0.0006~M_{\odot}$. We derive the bolometric flux and fundamental effective temperature for each component using observed magnitudes, flux ratios from light curves in multiple bands and angular diameters derived from the radii and parallax from long baseline interferometry, measuring the following values: $T_{\rm eff,A} = 6242 \pm 50$ K, $T_{\rm eff,B} = 5839 \pm 44$ K, with an additional 9 K systematic error from the flux scale zero-point. We confirm that LL Aqr displays low stellar activity by obtaining $2\sigma$ upper limits on the mean surface magnetic field strengths of 78 G and 96 G. Our results suggest an age of 2.67 - 3.01 Gyr, which is consistent with previous studies. LL Aqr now joins an ever-growing sample of well-characterised benchmark stars that can be used to test and calibrate a wide variety of methods and techniques in stellar astrophysics.

 - **Abstract**
 Extracting polarimetric information from very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) data is demanding but vital for understanding the synchrotron radiation process and the magnetic fields of celestial objects, such as active galactic nuclei (AGNs). However, conventional CLEAN-based calibration and imaging methods provide suboptimal resolution without uncertainty estimation of calibration solutions, while requiring manual steering from an experienced user. We present a Bayesian polarization calibration and imaging method using Bayesian imaging software resolve for VLBI data sets, that explores the posterior distribution of antenna-based gains, polarization leakages, and polarimetric images jointly from pre-calibrated data. We demonstrate our calibration and imaging method with observations of the quasar 3C273 with the VLBA at 15 GHz and the blazar OJ287 with the GMVA+ALMA at 86 GHz. Compared to the CLEAN method, our approach provides physically realistic images that satisfy positivity of flux and polarization constraints and can reconstruct complex source structures composed of various spatial scales. Our method systematically accounts for calibration uncertainties in the final images and provides uncertainties of Stokes images and calibration solutions. The automated Bayesian approach for calibration and imaging will be able to obtain high-fidelity polarimetric images using high-quality data from next-generation radio arrays. The pipeline developed for this work is publicly available.

 - **Abstract**
 We outline in this paper observations of the young pre-main-sequence low-mass star TWA 7, hosting a debris disk and a distant planet. Using data collected with the near-infrared SPIRou spectropolarimeter / precision velocimeter at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope from early 2019 to mid 2021, we detected the magnetic field of TWA 7 from the circularly polarized Zeeman signatures and Zeeman broadening of atomic spectral lines, and the rotational modulation of its longitudinal component at the known stellar rotation period (of 5.012+-0.007 d). We then modeled the large-scale and small-scale magnetic properties of TWA 7 using Zeeman-Doppler imaging. We found that TWA 7 hosted a mainly poloidal field that significantly evolved from 2019 to 2021, the dipole component getting stronger (increasing from 0.5 kG in 2019 to 0.7 kG in 2021) and less inclined to the stellar rotation axis (from 22° in 2019 to 15° in 2021). We also analyzed the radial velocities of TWA 7 derived from the SPIRou data, and found a tentative planet signature at a period of 15.2 d (with aliases at 20.8 and 30.4 d), very close to the detection limit of our data and that would correspond to a 0.17 Mjup planet at a distance of 0.09 au if confirmed. We finally report modulation of the 1083 nm He I and 1282 nm Pa-beta lines of TWA 7 with a period of 6.6 d, different from the rotation period and potentially hinting at the presence of a close-in planet triggering star-planet interactions.
#### Lucky Strikes: On the Origins of GW190814 Through Isolated Binary Evolution

 - **Abstract**
 The asymmetric nature of GW190814, particularly its mass ratio ($q \approx 1/10$), has made its astrophysical origin elusive. We explore isolated binary evolution as a potential explanation for GW190814's formation. Using the binary population synthesis code COSMIC, and the backpop sampling technique to map the observed parameters of GW190814 to the initial conditions of Zero Age Main Sequence binary stars while simultaneously inferring the astrophysical prescriptions for common envelope evolution, stable mass transfer and natal kick kinematics that are needed for its formation and eventual merger. We find that the initial conditions for the binary stellar population that forms GW190814 do not stand out significantly from massive star populations observed in the Local Group. Our backpop simulations recover a dominant formation pathway where the first Roche overflow phase includes a common envelope evolution and the second Roche overflow phase remains stable. Our findings suggest that natal kicks imparted during compact object formation play the strongest role in forming GW190814-like systems. Specifically, our models require a low magnitude first natal kick (independent of direction) that prevents the binary from unbinding and a large second natal kick with its direction in the plane of the orbit and toward the binary's center of mass. The second natal kick strength and direction crucially increases the orbital eccentricity, leading to shorter delay times, and thus enabling mergers within a Hubble time. We estimate the chance probability for GW190814-like events that experience such a lucky kick and find that it occurs in $\sim20\%$ of systems if natal kicks are randomly oriented. We discuss the astrophysical implications for the formation of asymmetric GW190814-like systems under the context of binary stellar evolution.
